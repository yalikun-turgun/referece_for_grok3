Relying on aggregate search frequency in Baidu, we construct a direct measure of investor attention to industries (AsVI). Our results show that an increase in AsVI predicts higher firm valuations. We prove that the price increase is an attention-induced result rather than an information-based fundamental premium, which is due to the evidence of a long-run reversal of firm valuations and worse performance of vC investments. Our findings continue to hold across a wide range of robustness checks, including sample selection, endogeneity, alternative measures of ASVI. We also find that syndicated investments and involvement of experienced venture capitalists attenuate the effect of AsVI on firm valuations, further supporting the attention-induced view.  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nThe relationship between investor attention and asset pricing in public markets has been well explored by numerous studies in recent years (Baker and Wurgler, 2006; Fang and Peress, 2009; Da et al., 2011). However, there is a dearth of empirical work regarding the impact of investor attention on the pricing in the venture capital (VC) industry. The valuation of VC-backed firms determines cost of capital for entrepreneurs (i.e., the ownership stake they give up) and ultimate return for venture capitalists (i.e., the difference between exit proceeds and the amount they invested), which is therefore vitally important to both sides (Engel and Keilbach, 2007; Hochberg et al., 2010). Existing literature on the determinants of VC valuations includes firm characteristics (Hand, 2005; Hsu, 2007), venture capital characteristics (Cumming and Dai, 2011; Collwaert and Manigart, 2016) and market conditions (Gompers and Lerner, 2000). Unlike earlier studies, our paper examines how investor attention to industries, measured by aggregate search frequency in Baidu (Search Volume Index (SVI)), influences the valuation of VC-backed firms in China.  \n\nRelying on a sample of 5621 financing rounds from 2006 to 2017, we find that firms in industries with an increase in investor attention exhibit higher valuations, which is shown to be an attention-induced result rather than an information-based fundamental premium. Moreover, we find that syndication and involvement of experienced venture capitalists can reduce firm valuations, which provides further evidence for the view of attention-induced price increases. Our paper, as far as we know, presents the first empirical evidence on how investor attention impacts the pricing in the venture capital industry.  \n\nThere are three reasons why investor attention is measured at an industry level rather than at the firm level. First, venture capitalists, as human beings constrained by limited information processing capacity (Miller, 1956), are faced with the task of choosing among thousands of start-ups. This limited capacity leads investors to allocate more attention to sector-level factors (such as industries, locations or countries) than to firm-specific factors (Peng and Xiong, 2006). Furthermore, industry is an important component in a wide range of asset pricing phenomena (Cohen et al., 2003; Hou and Robinson, 2006; Hou, 2007). Therefore, venture capitalists tend to manage the vast amount of choices by limiting their search to certain industries, which prevents them from being overwhelmed by financing requests from a large number of start-ups (Odean, 1999; Ding et al., 2017).  \n\nSecond, when venture capitalists evaluate and invest in start-ups, they tend to specialize by industry and fund firms in industries they have experience (Sahlman, 1990; Barry et al., 1990; Kaplan and Stromberg, 2003). Long-standing experience in an industry could allow venture capitalists to better identify good investment opportunities and to know how to manage and add value to these investments (Gompers et al., 2008).  \n\nThird, unlike public firms, private firms are largely exempt from disclosure requirements and thus lack of available data (Kaplan and Schoar, 2005), which leads individual investors to rarely search for firm-level information in Baidu. As a consequence, Baidu Index does not return a valid $\\mathsf{s u l}^{1}$ for the large majority of private firms. This lack of SVI data would introduce systematic biases and fail to reflect the actual relationship between investor attention and firm valuations. Therefore, we choose industry as a proxy to measure investor attentionforthisstudy.  \n\nWe propose a direct measure of investor attention to an industry using aggregate search frequency in Baidu. We first define the abnormal SVI (△sVI) for an industry by calculating the SVI during the 30 days prior to the financing minus the SVI during the previous 30 days, scaled by the SVI during the previous 30 days. To address the differences across industries and heteroscedasticity, we follow prior studies (Da et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2019) and construct our main variable, AsVI, by regressing △sVI on industry dummies, keeping the residuals, then normalizing these residuals using their standard deviations.  \n\nUsing the measure of AsVI, we investigate how investor attention to industries impacts the valuation of VC-backed firms. According to the attention theory (Ljungqvist et al., 2006; Barber and Odean, 2008; Da et al., 2011), an increase in individual investor attention drives up stock prices and IPO valuation, and eventually causes the long-run underperformance when investor attention dissipates. Consequently, we predict that firms with higher AsVI are offered higher valuations by venture capitalists and eventually exhibit worse performance when investor attention declines.  \n\nAlternatively, fundamental theory argues that positive news about an industry's prospects also result in an increase in search frequency and further push up firm valuations. Inconsistent with the attention theory, if high valuations are rational responses to fundamental information about the changing prospects, investments should be more successful and exhibit better performance.  \n\nTo test our hypothesis, we first examine the relationship between AsVI and firm valuations. Our results show that an increase in ASVI during the 30 days prior to the financing predicts higher firm valuations. Considering that prices may be affected by differences between the first and later round investors (Gompers and Lerner, 2000; Hand, 2005), we examine the results for the first financing rounds and later financing rounds (i.e., all non-first financing rounds) separately. The results suggest that the positive relationship between AsVI and firm valuations continues to hold for both the first and later financing rounds.  \n\nWe next distinguish the attention hypothesis and the fundamental hypothesis by examining the long-run performance of firm valuations following Da et al. (2011). Subject to data availability, we investigate the influence of AsVI in the current round on firm valuations in the subsequent round. Our results show that an increase in AsVI in the current round predicts a reversal in the next round. This evidence suggests that an increase in firm valuations is an attention-induced result rather than an information-based fundamental premium.  \n\nAnother natural venue to test the attention theory is the performance of VC investments. The performance of VC investments is measured by the performance of successful exits of portfolio companies and exit return multiples of venture capital (Gompers and Lerner, 2000; Hochberg et al., 2007). We find that firms with higher AsVI have a lower probability of successful exits and lower exit return multiples of venture capital, supporting the attention-induced view.  \n\nIn addition, a variety of diagnostic analyses are undertaken in our robustness tests. First, a substantial portion of financing rounds does not disclose valuation data, which may introduce systematic biases between rounds with and without valuation data (Gompers and Lerner, 2000; Cumming and Dai, 2011). We use a Heckman selection approach to address this concern and find that our main results carry through with this alternative approach. Second, the omitted variable bias may lead to inflated values for the coefficients of correlated independent variables (Judge et al., 1985), which would cause us to falsely impute significance to the measure of investor attention to industries. To rule out this endogeneity, we employ an instrumental variable approach and our results persist in instrumental regression. Third, to address the concern that a 30-day window is insufficient to measure changes of investor attention, we construct AsVI using both 60-day and 90-day windows to reexamine the baseline analyses and find that our conclusions continue to hold.  \n\nFinally, we examine the effect of syndication and involvement of experienced VCs on firm valuations. According to Cumming and Walz (2010) and Heughebaert and Manigart (2012), syndication and experience could help VCs alleviate information asymmetry and forecast firm valuations more precisely. Therefore, if an increase in firm valuations are driven by investor attention, this overvaluation could be reduced by these adjustments of investment strategies. We investigate the effect of syndicated investments and involvement of experienced VCs on firm valuations and find that both of them significantly attenuate the effect of investor attention on firm valuations, supporting the attention-induced view.  \n\nOur study contributes to two strands of literature. First, our paper extends the literature on the valuation of VC-backed firms. Previous research has analyzed the effect of various determinants on the valuation of vC-backed firms, including firm characteristics (Hand, 2005; Armstrong et al., 2006), firm founder characteristics (Hsu, 2007), market conditions (Gompers and Lerner, 2000), venture capital characteristics (Cumming and Dai, 2011; Collewaert and Manigart, 2016), the role of bargaining power (Kirilenko, 2001; Fairchild, 2004; Heughebaert and Manigart, 2012), trademarks (Block et al., 2014) and corporate venture capital type (Rohm et al., 2018). However, there is little insight into the effect of investor attention on the valuation of VC-backed firms. We fll in this gap. Our paper also contributes to emerging literature on investor attention. Investor attention can impact stock prices and behavior of publicly traded securities in the aftermarket through trading volume (Gervais et al., 2001; Hou et al., 2009), media coverage and headlines (Palomino et al., 2009; Yuan, 2015; Chahine et al., 2015; Ahmad et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2020) and social media (Danbolt et al., 2015; Leitch and Sherif, 2017; Ga0 et al., 2019; Feng and Johansson, 2019). In addition, investor attention also influences IPO valuation and initial returns in the premarket Derrien, 2005; Alimov and Mikelson, 2012; Clarke et al., 2016). However, our paper, as far as we know, is the first to present empirical evidence about how investor attention affects the pricing in the venture capital market.  \n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses institutional environment and literature review. Section 3 describes data construction and provides summary statistics. In Section 4, we report the baseline results and examine the long-run performance of firm valuations and the performance of VC investments. Section 5 examines robustness tests, including sample selection, endogeneity and alternative measures of AsVI. Section 6 investigates the effect of syndication and involvement of experienced VCs on firm valuations. Section 7 concludes the paper.  \n\n## 2. Institutional environment and literature review  \n\n### 2.1.Institutional environment  \n\nChina, as one of the largest emerging economies, has many unique characteristics including venture capital industry and listing regulations. This section first discusses some different factors related to the VC market in China. First, venture capital in China is crucially different from that in advanced economies, including the selection of firms to fund (Baum and Silverman, 2004), monitoring processes and exit strategies (Bruton and Ahlstrom, 2003). For instance, in the selection process, venture capitalists in advanced economies mainly rely on financial and accounting information to evaluate the proposed ventures (Mcgrath, 1997) while in emerging economies they tend to fund firms that are located nearby in order to understand the local regulations (Bruton and Ahlstrom, 2003), which may cause the different behavior of venture capitalists in assessing and pricing the ventures.  \n\nSecond, venture capitalists in China are not as mature as their counterparts in developed markets, especially in the U.S., given that the history of venture capital in China traces back only to the 1990s. Wang and Wang (2011) also document that foreign VCs significantly outperform domestic VCs (i.e., the Chinese VC firms) in fundraising, investment amount, the number of investment deals and portfolio company performance. The short history and the underperformance of Chinese VC firms make them less mature and more easily influenced by sentiment investors who are prone to set the prices above or below the fundamental value of an asset (Black, 1986; Ljungqvist et al., 2006).  \n\nThird, China’ VC industry experiences rapid expansion and has attracted much interest from global investors. The amount of newly raised funds increased from US\\$ 675 million in 1999 to US\\$ 104,262 million in 2015 and the number of funds increased from 87 in 1999 to 7665 in 2015 (Que and Zhang, 2020). Moreover, China is one of the most favored investment destinations of VCs in the world. The amount of investment made by foreign venture capital accounted for over $65\\%$ of the total investment in China between 2001 and 2008 (Guo and Jiang, 2013). Therefore, our study benefits not only venture capital investors in China but also global venture capital investors.  \n\nIn addition, in contrast to a mature market in which conducting an IPO is a decision made by the issuer (Kao et al., 2009), firms in China need to satisfy higher standards regarding financial indicators and obtain approvals from the CsRC in order to go public (Chen et al., 2016). Firms going public on different stock markets require different financial standards. In fact, China's A-share market consists of four main parts, including the Main Board Market, Small and Medium-sized Enterprise Board Market, Growth Enterprise Market and SSE STAR Market.? Firms going public on the Main Board Market and the Small and Medium-sized Enterprise Board Market need to meet the same financial standards. The net profits of firms should be all positive in the three consecutive years prior to  \n\nIPO and accumulatively more than 30 million RMB. Firms going public on the Growth Enterprise Market need to be profitable in the two consecutive years prior to IPO and the accumulated net profits in the two years prior to IPO are not less than 10 million RMB. There are no strict financial requirements for firms going public on the SSE STAR Market. Therefore, companies in China must be profitable in order to go public successfully on China's A-share market except SSE STAR Market.3  \n\n### 2.2. Literature review and hypothesis  \n\nValuing start-ups, especially at early stages, is challenging given the lack of historical data, considerable uncertainty and informational asymmetry (Nahata, 2008; Festel et al., 2013). Classical theory argues that valuation for start-ups, to a large extent, is determined through the negotiation between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs (Hsu, 2007; Cumming and Dai, 2011; Heughebaert and Manigart, 2012). Therefore, previous literature focuses mainly on the determinants of negotiation power on both sides, including venture quality (Armstrong et al., 2006; Hsu, 2007; Gompers et al., 2010) and VC characteristics (Hsu, 2004; Cumming and Dai, 2011). However, retail investor attention, as a precursor of retail demand for shares in the aftermarket (Barber and Odean, 2008), may contain valuable clues about latent investor demand and reflect the intrinsic quality of start-ups (Colaco et al., 2017), which influences expectations of venture capitalists and in turn venture valuations. Consequently, incorporating retail attention could lead to more appropriate valuations for venture capitalists.  \n\nInvestor attention influences the expectations of venture capitalists in two strands. First, in the premarket, an increase in retail investors or the mere presence of retail investors could lead to higher initial IPO valuation (Colaco et al., 2017), higher IPO offer prices (Cornelli et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007) or larger first-day returns for an IPO (Derrien, 2005; Bajo and Raimondo, 2017). Therefore, issuers, underwriters and institutional investors would benefit from a large IPO price run-up when they sell IPO shares to sentiment investors (Ljungqvist et al., 2006; Colaco et al., 2017), which even leads them to induce sentiment investors into the market for an IPO (Cook et al., 2006). Venture capitalists, as participants in the premarket, also benefit from these sentiment investors and thus expect to gain high exit proceeds given the high IPO valuation.  \n\nIn addition, as pointed out by Barber and Odean (2008), retail attention is a precursor of retail demand for shares in the aftermarket. An increase in retail demand causes temporary positive price pressure and drives up stock prices, which would bring VCs high returns when they sell shares in the aftermarket. As a consequence, when retail investors increasingly pay attention to an industry, VCs will anticipate strong latent investor demand and high exit returns in the aftermarket, resulting in a willingness to offer higher valuations to all firms in this industry (i.e., the “attention hypothesis\").  \n\nHowever, an increase in firm valuations is also likely explained by fundamental information reflected from favorable news about the industries. There are three aspects to illustrate our concerns. First, an industry is during the period of rapid growth or booms, such as personal computer hardware manufactures in the 1980s and Internet retailers and telecommunications concerns in the late 1990s (Gompers et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2013). Second, the government issues positive policies to support high-tech industries, such as software industry or 5G (Grilli and Murtinu, 2014). Third, there are major technological discoveries in an industry, such as development of genetic engineering (Lerner, 2002). Positive news about an industry's prospects will increase interest in online searches related to the industry and improve the expectations of all firms in the industry, which makes venture capitalists willing to pay higher prices to startups in this industry (i.e., the “fundamental hypothesis\").  \n\nThe attention hypothesis and fundamental hypothesis may be distinguished from three aspects. First, according to Barber and Odean (2008) and Da et al. (2011), over-enthusiasm of retail investors could drive up firm valuations temporarily, and the firms eventually revert to their fundamental value when investor attention dissipates, causing a long-run underperformance (Ritter and Welch, 2002; Ljungqvist et al., 2006). Therefore, if the price increase is driven by investor attention, firm valuations will increase temporarily and eventually revert in the long run. However, if the price increase is due to fundamental information, no long-run reversal is expected. As a result, the long-run performance provides us with a natural venue to examine whether an increase in firm valuations is driven by investor attention or fundamental information.  \n\nSecond, Gompers and Lerner (2000) argue that if high valuations are rational responses to fundamental information about the changing prospects, investments should be more successful and exhibit better performance. In other words, if the investments do not exhibit better performance, high valuations should be driven by investor attention rather than fundamental information. Consistent with Hochberg et al. (2007), the performance of VC investments is measured by the performance of successful exits (Brander et al.,. 2002; Sorensen, 2007) and exit return multiples of venture capital. Our tests therefore focus on whether there are high probability of successful exits and high exit return multiples.  \n\nThird, Heughebaert and Manigart (2012) argue that syndication can alleviate the information asymmetry and improve the quality of the decision (Wright and Lockett, 2003; Cumming and Walz, 2010). It is also well-documented that more experienced managers have a higher degree of skill and sophistication with respect to analyzing financial statements and forecasting firm valuations (Bushee, 1998; Cumming and Walz, 2010; Butler and Goktan, 2013). Therefore, if an increase in firm valuations is driven by investor attention, this overvaluation could be reduced by these adjustments of investment strategies that make VCs less vulnerable to investor sentiment. However, if the price increase is due to fundamental information, firm valuations could not be reduced by syndication or experience which on the contrary could help VCs pay more reasonable prices close to fundamental value. Consequently, we distinguish the attention hypothesis and fundamental hypothesis by exploring whether syndication and involvement of experienced VCs reduce the  \n\neffect of investor attention on firm valuations  \n\n## 3. Data and descriptive statistics  \n\n### 3.1. Data and sample construction  \n\nInformation about venture investments, including valuation data, comes from the CVSource database. CVSource is a professional database which provides information about both venture capital firms and their portfolio companies in the Chinese private equity market. Our observations have venture names, financing dates, stages, rounds, venture industry, post-money valuation, the amount invested in each round, ownership held by VC and establishment date of venture capital. Firms that have received financing from individual investors are excluded from our sample. Following Cumming and Dai (2011), We define the firm valuations, Ln(pre-money valuation),4 as the natural logarithm of the difference between post-money valuation and the amount of capital invested in the financing round, expressed in thousands of US dollars.  \n\nThe data used to measure investor attention comes from Baidu Index (http:/index.baidu.com). Although prior studies (Da et al., 2011; Gao et al., 2019) mainly use Google SVI to measure investor attention, we choose Baidu SVI instead of Google SVI because Baidu has the largest market share of internet search engines in mainland China (Ying et al., 2015). According to an analysis on the Chinese search engine market in 2018, Baidu makes up $70.3\\%$ of the market share for mainland China. Consequently, the search volume from Baidu is representative of the internet search behavior of the general population of mainland China. Since Baidu Index provides the daily SVI of search terms dating back to June 2006, our sample covers the period from June 2006 to December 2017. We employ a web crawling program to obtain the daily SVI of each industry and construct our measure of AsVI.  \n\nOur next concern is to identify the industries of VC-backed firms. We choose Shenwan Industry Classification to measure venture industry in our paper. Shenwan is a well-known securities company in China and takes into account the industry classification of both the government and industry management department when setting up the industries. In addition, Shenwan Industry Classification is well used in stock market in China and therefore is convenient to match public market industry index to VC-backed firms. According to Shenwan classification system, there are three levels of industry classifications and we use the third-level classification (six-digit code) to measure investor attention to an industry.  \n\nHowever, the names of some industries could not be searched directly and generate a valid sVI in Baidu Index. In addition, some industries are not appropriate to be used directly as search terms, such as industries with too few firms or that are vaguely identified. Four steps are taken to overcome these problems. First, we try to substitute the industry by using a synonym for which Baidu Index can return a valid SVI. Second, for some industries that contain too few firms, we use the second-level industry (four-digit code) as a substitute. Third, although Shenwan has well classified firm industries, there are still some industries that are vaguely identified and cannot reflect firms’ main business accurately. In this case, we manually divide the industries into existing industries or new subindustries based on firms? main business. Fourth, for industries that could not be substituted by synonyms or firms that have valuation data but no industry data, we manually match each firm to the existing industries or to sub-industries based on its main business, and keep those firms that can be assigned to specific industries. In the end, there are left 5621 rounds (i.e., including $4305~\\mathrm{firms}$ of venture capital investments? with valuation data in 229 industries with valid sVIs. We discuss our industry classifications in more detail in Appendix C.6  \n\n### 3.2. Construction of ASVI  \n\nIn this part, we discuss the construction of investor attention to an industry. Using the daily SVI for each industry, we follow Chen et al. (2013) and Jiang et al. (2016) and first define abnormal investor attention (△sVI) for industry i on financing day t in Eq (1) as:  \n\n$$\n\\Delta\\mathrm{SVI}_{i,t}=\\frac{S V I_{i,(t-30,t-1)}-S V I_{i,(t-60,t-31)}}{S V I_{i,(t-60,t-31)}}\n$$  \n\nwhere SVIis the daily search frequeny from Baidu Inexbased on the industry, $S V I_{i}$ $(t{-}30,t{-}1)$ is the SVI during the 30 days prior to the financing day t for industry i, and $S V I_{i}$ $(t{-}60{,}t{-}31)$ is the SVI during the previous 30 days for industry i.  \n\nIn addition, we observe substantial differences in abnormal attention across industries. Consistent with Da et al. (2015) and Ga0 et al. (2019), we use the following method to construct an adjusted abnormal investor attention in our paper. First, to mitigate any concern about outliers, we winsorize △sVI at the $1\\%$ level. Then, to eliminate differences across industries, we regress △sVI on industry dummies and keep the residuals. Finally, to address heteroscedasticity and make the industries comparable, we normalize these residuals by using their standard deviations. In the end, we obtain adjusted (winsorizing, eliminating industry bias, standardizing) abnormal investor attention, defined as AsVI, to measure investor attention to an industry.  \n\n### 3.3. Descriptive statistics  \n\nTable 1 reports summary statistics of the control variables for VC-backed firms between 2006 and 2017.7 The control variables in our paper consist of firm characteristics, venture capital characteristics and market conditions. First, we control for firm characteristics including the stage of ventures and the location of ventures following Gompers and Lerner (2000) and Cumming and Dai (2011). Early equals one for financing provided to ventures that have initial product, a rough business plan and an incomplete management team. The venture has usually been in business less than two years, but has not sold their product commercially. Development equals one for financing provided to ventures with product in testing or pilot production. The venture has not generated sale revenue, but starts to implement the market development plan. Expansion equals one for financing provided to ventures in need of growth and expansion capital. The venture may not break even or trade profitably. Capital is used to finance increased production capacity, for market or product development, to provide additional working capital. Profitable equals one if the venture has reached profitable operating level. The venture usually prepares to go public. $^8{\\cal B}J$ equals one if the venture is located in Beijing and zero otherwise. SH equals one if the venture is located in Shanghai and zero otherwise. $G D$ equals one if the venture is located in Guangdong province and zero otherwise. $Z J$ equals one if the venture is located in Zhejiang province and zero otherwise. We choose BJ, SH, GD and $Z J$ as control variables because the number of investment rounds in these four regions is the largest, far larger than those located elsewhere. In addition, venture capital institutions are geographically concentrated in these four regions (Que and Zhang, 2020).  \n\nSecond, we control for the following measures of VC characteristics affecting firm valuations. Ln(Investment) is defined as the natural logarithm of the amount invested in the financing round, expressed in thousands of US dollars. Ownership is the ownership held by venture capital in the financing round. Ln(Number of investors) is the natural logarithm of the number of venture capital investors in the financing round (Heughebaert and Manigart, 2012). $G V C^{9}$ is defined as one if a venture capital firm is established, controlled and operated by the central government or local government and zero otherwise (Zhang and Mayes, 2018). $C V C^{10}$ is defined as one if a venture capital firm is a subsidiary of a corporation and zero otherwise. $F V C^{11}$ is defined as one if a venture capital firm's headquarter is located overseas or its capital is from abroad and zero otherwise (Que and Zhang, 2020). Syndication equals one if there is more than one VC investor in the same round and zero otherwise (Cumming and Walz, 2010; Guo and Jiang, 2013; Hsu et al., 2020). Experience is the natural logarithm of one plus the number of years from the establishment date of venture capital that makes the largest total investment in the financing round to the financing round (Gompers, 1996; Nahata, 2008; Cumming and Walz, 2010).  \n\nThird, market conditions include two measures, an overall market index and an industry index. The overall market index is Ln(IPOs last year) which is defined as the natural logarithm of the number of IPOs in the previous year (Cumming and Dai, 2011).

When the stock market entered into a bear market in 2016, AsVI drops from 1.395 in 2015 to $-0.12$ in 2016 and pre-money valuation plunges from 244.058 in 2015 to 153.281 in 2016 (in thousands of US dollars). Similar phenomena exist in the period from the bull market in 2007 to the bear market in 2008.12 This evidence suggests that investor attention to industries is positively related to firm valuations.  \n\nTable 3 provides descriptive statistics of pre-money valuation based on firm characteristics and round size. Most of our findings are consistent with Gompers and Lerner (2000) and Cumming and Dai (2011). For instance, pre-money valuation increases with the size of financing round. The mean pre-money valuation in the largest quartile of financing rounds is 468.888, compared with 29.439 in the smallest quartile of financing rounds (in thousands of Us dollars). In addition, pre-money valuation increases with development stage; Early is the lowest and Profitable is the highest. Firms located in Beijing (BJ), Shanghai (SH), Guangdong province $(G D)$ and Zhejiang province (ZJ) have higher valuations than those located elsewhere.  \n\n## 4.

Section 4.1 examines how investor attention to industries influences firm valuations. In Section 4.2, we explore whether firm valuations are induced by investor attention or fundamental information.  \n\nTable 2 Observations by year.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Year</td><td>No.of financing rounds</td><td>ASVI</td><td>Pre-money valuation ($)</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>65</td><td>2.665</td><td>166.704</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>216</td><td>2.106</td><td>184.592</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>264</td><td>0.201</td><td>122.615</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>338</td><td>0.734</td><td>186.065</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>616</td><td>0.211</td><td>179.011</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>679</td><td>0.288</td><td>172.124</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>463</td><td>0.764</td><td>167.314</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>423</td><td>0.926</td><td>182.630</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>492</td><td>0.155</td><td>255.902</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>1050</td><td>1.395</td><td>244.058</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>729</td><td>0.120</td><td>153.281</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>286</td><td>0.717</td><td>150.063</td></tr><tr><td>ALL</td><td>5621</td><td>0.632</td><td>189.407</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table reports the number of financing rounds, the means of AsVI and the means of pre-money valuation in each year between 2006 and 2017.

Baseline regression  \n\nWe first assess the effect of investor attention to industries on the valuation of VC-backed firms. Following previous studies (Gompers and Lerner, 2000; Cumming and Dai, 2011), we adopt a hedonic regression approach to examine the effect. The dependent variable is pre-money valuation and the independent variables include firm characteristics, venture capital characteristics and market environment. We control for year and industry as fixed effects in our model. The following model in Eq. (2) is used to examine the effect of investor attention to industries on firm valuations.  \n\n$$\nV a l u a t i o n_{k,l}=\\alpha_{0}+\\alpha_{1}A S V_{k,l}+F i r m~c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s_{k,l}+V C~c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s_{k,l}+M a r k e t~c o n d i t i o n s_{k,l}+\\epsilon_{k,l}\n$$  \n\nwhere Valuationk, $t$ is the pre-money valuation of firm $k$ on financing day t, $A S V I_{k}$ $t$ is investor attention to the industry of $\\mathrm{firm}k$ on financing day t, Firm characteristics consist of stage information (Early, Development and Expansion) and location information (BJ, SH, GD and ZJ), VC characteristics include the amount invested by VC, the ownership held by VC, the number of VC investors, GVC, CVC, FVC and VC experience, Market conditions include the number of IPOs in the previous year and the industry public market index at the end of the month prior to the financing. Detailed definitions for the control variables are described in Section 3.3.  \n\nTable 4 reports the relationship between investor attention to industries and firm valuations. The dependent variable is defined as the natural logarithm of the difference between post-money valuation and the amount of capital invested in the financing round, expressed in thousands of US dollars. Table 4 Column (1) examines the relationship for the full sample. The results show that the coefficient of AsVI is significant and positive, suggesting that firms in an industry with higher investor attention experience higher premoney valuation. Specifically, one standard deviation increase in investor attention increases the valuation of the firm by $1.13\\%$ .In addition, investment size is significantly and positively related to pre-money valuation. The good public market conditions can increase firm valuations in the venture capital industry. High ownership held by VCs has significant and negative effect on pre-money valuation, which is probably due to the high bargaining power from VCs. More VC members and more experienced VCs offer lower valuations. Location and different VC types (GVC, CVC and FVC) are not significantly associated with firm valuations.  \n\nWe also divide the full sample into two groups based on financing rounds because firm valuations may be affected by differences between the first and later round investors. Lerner (1994b) argues that established VC groups tend to syndicate second and later financing rounds with less established investors. These changing syndication patterns may influence firm valuations. In addition, Gompers and Lerner (2000) and Hand (2005) document that later rounds are related to a substantial premium. From the perspective of investor attention, VCs in the first rounds are more easily affected by investor sentiment and set the price that deviates from fundamental value due to lack of historical data. To examine the difference, we segment our sample into the first round groups in Column (2) and the later round groups (i.e., all non-first financing rounds) in Column (3). We find that results for both the first round groups and later round groups are consistent with results for the full sample, supporting our notion that AsVI is positively associated with the valuation of VC-backed firms.  \n\n### 4.2.Investor attention or fundamental information?  \n\nAlthough we have shown that investor attention to industries is positively associated with firm valuations in the above analysis, fundamental information reflected by the positive news could also account for it. Favorable news about an industry's prospects will lead to an increase in search frequency (SVI) related to the industry, which could improve the expectations for all firms in an industry and in turn cause an increase of valuations for those firms. In this section, we will provide two pieces of evidence that is inconsistent with such information-based fundamental hypothesis.  \n\nThe first venue is the prediction for long-run performance. According to Da et al. (2011), if an initial price increase is driven by investor attention, firms eventually come back to their fundamental value when attention dissipates, causing the valuation to increase temporarily and then revert in the long run (Ritter and Welch, 2002; Ljungqvist et al., 2006). However, if the initial price increase is caused by positive fundamental information, no long-run reversal is expected. Consistent with these ideas, we wish to examine whether there is a long-run reversal in valuation for VC-backed firms. However, given that valuation data in the venture capital industry typically has gaps of one to two years between financing rounds (Gompers and Lerner, 20oo), we cannot investigate long-run performance as it occurs in the aftermarket. Instead, we examine whether there is a reversal in the subsequent financing rounds.  \n\nTable 5 reports the results for reversals in the subsequent financing rounds. Specifically, the main independent variable of interest, ASVI, is investor attention to industries in the current round and the dependent variable is pre-money valuation in the subsequent round with a gap of one year, i.e., more than three months and less than sixteen months. The reason why we choose a gap of one year is that the mean gap between refinancings is 12.72 months in our sample. We choose a minimum gap of more than three months as it is likely that the influence of investor attention on firm valuations in the current and subsequent round would overlap if the gap was any smaller. We choose “less than sixteen months\"’ as the maximum gap since investor attention would likely lose influences on firm valuations if the gap was any longer. Concerning that the results could be time-dependent, we control a time-interval related variable, △time, defined as the number of months from the current financing round to the next financing round. In addition, we also control the ASVI in the next financing round, labelled as ASVI Next, in our regression.  \n\nThe results show that the coefficient of AsVI is significant and negative, demonstrating that an increase in AsVI in the current round predicts a reversal of firm valuations in the subsequent round. Specifically, one standard deviation increase in investor attention in the current round predicts a decline in firm valuations in the subsequent round of $10.40\\%$ In addition, we examine the results for the first round investments and find a consistent result. Our findings, to some extent, suggest that price increase is an attention-induced result rather than an information-based fundamental premium.  \n\nThe second distinguishing feature between the attention-induced price increase and the information-based alternative is the performance of VC investments. Gompers and Lerner (2000) document that if fundamental information about the changing prospects results in high valuations, investments should be more successful and exhibit better performance. Therefore, if VC investments do not exhibit better performance, we can conclude that it is investor attention rather than fundamental information that pushes firm valuations up. Next, we investigate whether there is better performance of VC investments.  \n\nConsistent with Hochberg et al. (2007), the performance of VC investments is measured by the performance of both the VC and the VC's portfolio companies. At the portfolio company level, we examine whether the companies achieve a successful exit, following  \n\nTable4 Regression analysis of AsVI on firm valuations.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"3\">Ln(Pre-money valuation)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Full sample</td><td>First round investments</td><td>Non-first round investments</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">ASVI</td><td>0.0010***</td><td>0.0009**</td><td>0.0011***</td></tr><tr><td>(3.41)</td><td>(2.54)</td><td>(2.59)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Early</td><td>-0.5607***</td><td>-0.5424***</td><td>-0.5698**</td></tr><tr><td>(-11.21)</td><td>(10.51)</td><td>(2.57)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Development</td><td>-0.3199***</td><td>-0.3299***</td><td>-0.4393**</td></tr><tr><td>(-7.54)</td><td>(7.47)</td><td>(2.30)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Expansion</td><td>-0.1250***</td><td>-0.1418***</td><td>0.2519</td></tr><tr><td>(-2.96)</td><td>(3.23)</td><td>(1.34)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">BJ</td><td>0.0033</td><td>0.0024</td><td>0.0061</td></tr><tr><td>(0.14)</td><td>(0.10)</td><td>(0.11)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">SH</td><td>0.0314</td><td>0.0085</td><td>0.0993</td></tr><tr><td>(1.19)</td><td>(0.30)</td><td>(1.34)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">GD</td><td>0.0359</td><td>-0.0012</td><td>0.1048*</td></tr><tr><td>(1.58)</td><td>(-0.05)</td><td>(1.82)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">ZJ</td><td>0.0525*</td><td>0.0120</td><td>0.0947</td></tr><tr><td>(1.86)</td><td>(0.39)</td><td>(1.27)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Ln(Investment)</td><td>0.8903***</td><td>0.8981***</td><td>0.8542***</td></tr><tr><td>(146.55)</td><td>(136.86)</td><td>(39.11)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Ownership</td><td>-0.0723***</td><td>-0.0698***</td><td>-0.0931***</td></tr><tr><td>(123.79)</td><td>(-116.66)</td><td>(18.17)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Ln(Number of investors)</td><td>-0.0414***</td><td>-0.0346***</td><td>-0.0325***</td></tr><tr><td>(-6.77)</td><td>(-4.87)</td><td>(-2.77)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">GVC</td><td>0.0042</td><td>0.0311</td><td>-0.0543</td></tr><tr><td>(0.24)</td><td>(1.61)</td><td>(1.27)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">CVC</td><td>-0.0175</td><td>0.0048</td><td>0.0714</td></tr><tr><td>(-0.53)</td><td>(0.13)</td><td>(-1.08)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">FVC</td><td>0.0608*</td><td>0.0553</td><td>0.0500</td></tr><tr><td>(1.74)</td><td>(1.49)</td><td>(0.52)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Experience</td><td>-0.0258***</td><td>-0.0231**</td><td>-0.0140</td></tr><tr><td>(-2.69)</td><td>(2.21)</td><td>(-0.64)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Ln(IPOs last year)</td><td>0.0722***</td><td>0.0721***</td><td>0.0612</td></tr><tr><td>(4.88)</td><td>(4.82)</td><td>(0.64)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Industry public market index</td><td>0.0226</td><td>-0.0184</td><td>0.0858</td></tr><tr><td>(0.40)</td><td>(-0.30)</td><td>(0.55)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Constant</td><td>2.8138***</td><td>2.7417***</td><td>3.0273***</td></tr><tr><td>(8.39)</td><td>(7.15)</td><td>(3.62)</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>5621</td><td>4305</td><td>1316</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.902</td><td>0.916</td><td>0.890</td></tr><tr><td>Year fixed effect</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Industry fixed effect</td><td>Yes Yes</td><td>Yes Yes</td><td>Yes Yes</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table reports the influence of investor attention to industries on firm valuations.

Column (1) presents the results for the full sample. Column (2) presents the results for the subsample of the first round investments. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of the difference between post-money valuation and the amount of capital invested in the subsequent financing round, expressed in thousands of Us dollars. The gap between the current and the subsequent round is one year, i.e., more than three months and less than sixteen months. ASVI is measured by regressing △SVI on industry dummies to control for industry differences, keeping the residuals, then normalizing these residuals by using their standard deviations (△sVI is defined by calculating the SVI during the 30 days prior to the financing minus the SVI during the previous 30 days, scaled by the SVI during the previous 30 days). ASVI Next is the AsVI in the next financing round. △Time is the number of months from the current financing round to the next financing round. Early equals one for financing provided to ventures that have initial product, a rough business plan and an incomplete management team. The venture has usually been in business less than two years, but has not sold their product commercially. Development equals one for financing provided to ventures with product in testing or pilot production. The venture has not generated sale revenue, but starts to implement the market development plan. Expansion equals one for financing provided to ventures in need of growth and expansion capital. The venture may not break even or trade profitably. Capital is used to finance increased production capacity, for market or product development, to provide additional working capital. BJ equals one if the venture is located in Beijing and zero otherwise. SH equals one if the venture is located in Shanghai and zero otherwise. GD equals one if the venture is located in Guangdong province and zero otherwise. ZJ equals one if the venture is located in Zhejiang province and zero otherwise. Ln(Investment) is the natural logarithm of the amount invested in the financing round, expressed in thousands of US dollars. Ownership is the ownership held by venture capital in the financing round. Ln(Number of investors) is the natural logarithm of the number of venture capital investors in the financing round. GVC equals one if a venture capital firm is established, controlled and operated by the central government or local government and zero otherwise. CVC equals one if a venture capital firm is a subsidiary of a corporation and zero otherwise. FVC equals one if a venture capital firm's headquarter is located overseas or its capital is from abroad and zero otherwise. Experience is the natural logarithm of one plus the number of years from the establishment of venture capital that makes the largest total investment in the financing round to the financing round. Ln(IPOs last year) is the natural logarithm of the number of IPOs in the previous year. Industry public market index is defined as the simple average of monthly returns of publicly traded firms in the same industry as the venture at the end of the month prior to the financing. All the regressions control for year and industry fixed effects. T-statistics are reported in parentheses. $***$ $**$ , and \\* indicate significance at $1\\%$ $5\\%$ and $10\\%$ levels, respectively.  \n\nBrander et al. (2002), Sorensen (2007) and Humphery-Jenner and Suchard (2013) in viewing a successful exit as a signal of the investment's success. At the VC level, in the absence of available data on IRR (internal rates of returns), we instead use limited data on exit return multiples of venture capital disclosed by CVSource database to examine VC performance.  \n\nWe first analyze the effect of AsVI on the probability of successful exits of VC's portfolio companies. The venture is defined to have a successful exit if it exits via an IPO or a sale to another company (trade sell), or if it receives new financing with a gap of more than one year between the current and new financing rounds. Besides the typically successful forms of exit (via an IPO or trade sale), we view receiving new financing as a successful form considering that Hochberg et al. (2007) define survival to another funding round as an interim signal of success. We choose a gap of more than one year between refinancings for the following two reasons. First, the mean gap between refinancings is 12.72 months in our sample. Second, VC is a long-term strategic investor and provides value-adding services for the ventures. Therefore, we view the persistently performance well for a period of time after the investment to be sucessful.  \n\nIn addition, to alleviate the bias that some firms could not be defined to have a successful exit only because they have no enough time to mature to the point of being taken public (Gompers and Lerner, 2000; Cumming and Dai, 2011), our sample only examines the ultimate success of venture investments before 2013. Table 6 Column (1)-(4) report the results of a probit regression of the probability of successful exits via only IPO, only trade sale, IPO and trade sale, and receiving new financing on AsVI, respectively. The results show that firms in industries with higher investor attention exhibit a lower probability of successful exits, that is, worse performance of VC investments, supporting for the attention hypothesis.  \n\nTo further examine how AsVI and valuation jointly influence the ultimate performance of VCs' portfolio companies, we divide our sample into two parts based on the median of pre-money valuation and report the results in in Table 6 Column (5)-(6). We find that the effect of AsVI on the probability of successful exits via an IPO is significant only for firms with relatively high pre-money valuation. Together with our findings in Table 4, this result suggests that the worse performance of VC investments appears to be driven entirely by the part of high investor attention. The analysis provides stronger evidence that firm valuations are induced by investor attention rather than fundamental information.  \n\nWe next examine a sample of exit return multiples disclosed by the CVSource database. This data is available for 748 of the 5621 financing rounds in our sample. While this sample is small and not necessarily representative, it provides us with an opportunity to partially examine the relationship between AsVI and exit return multiples. Table 7 reports the results of the effect of AsVI on exit return multiples. We find that the coefficient of AsVI is insignificant but negative, suggesting that firms in an industry with higher investor attention experience lower exit return multiples to some extent. When dividing our sample into two parts based on the median of pre-money valuation, we find significant and negative relationship between AsVI and exit return multiples only among the group with relatively high pre-money valuation. In line with the evidence in Table 6, our findings demonstrate that AsVI is negatively associated with the performance of VC investments, especially for financing rounds with high pre-money valuation. This evidence supports for the attention hypothesis.  \n\nTo summarize, we find that increases in AsVI predicts increases in firm valuations. Moreover, the increase in firm valuations is an attention-induced result rather than an information-based fundamental premium due to the evidence of a long-run reversal of firm valuations and worse performance of VC investments. Our findings provide support for the attention-induced hypothesis.  \n\n## 5. Robustness tests  \n\nThis section undertakes a variety of diagnostic analyses. In Section 5.1, we use a Heckman approach to address sample selection bias. Section 5.2 addresses the endogeneity problem by introducing instrumental variables. In Section 5.3, we repeat the baseline analysis using alternativemeasures of AsVI.  \n\n### 5.1.A Heckman approach to deal with sample selection bias  \n\nThe valuation data comes from CVSource database, which collects data on firms in China that have received venture capital financing. However, a substantial portion of financing rounds in the CVSource database do not disclose valuation data, which may result in systemic biases between rounds with valuation data and those without valuation data (Gompers and Lerner, 2000; Cumming and Dai, 2011). To address this concern, we employ the Heckman sample selection approach to make sure that the omissions of valuation data do not cause selection biases in our analysis.  \n\nThe Heckman procedure suggests a correction for potential selection biases in two steps (Heckman, 1979). A first regression, the selection equation, measures the probability that there will be valuation data. Specifically, a first stage probit regression is based on the dependent variable which equals one if valuation data for a financing round is disclosed and zero otherwise. The independent variables for the first stage regression are firm characteristics including BJ, SH, GD, ZJ, Early, Development and Expansion, VC characteristics including the amount invested by venture capital, the number of investors, GVC, CVC, FVC and Experience, and market conditions  \n\nTable6 Regression analysis of AsVI on the probability of successful exits.

probability of successful exits. The venture is defined to have a successful exit if it exits via an IPO or a sale to another company (trade sell), or if it receives new financing with a gap of more than one year between refinancings. We only include the financing rounds before 2013 in order to alleviate the bias that some firms could not be defined to have a successful exit only because they have no enough time to mature to the point of being taken public. Column (1)-(4) present the results of successful exits via only IPO, only trade sale, IPO and trade sale, and receiving new financing for the full sample, respectively. Column (5)-(6) present the results of successful exits via only IPO for the subsamples of financing rounds with high pre-money valuation and low pre-money valuation divided by the median of pre-money valuation, respectively. The dependent variable equals one if the ventures exits via an IPO or a sale to another company (trade sell) or if the venture receives new financing and zero otherwise. ASVI is measured by regressing SVIon industry dummies to control for industry differences, keeping the residuals, then normalizing these residuals by using their standard deviations (△sVI is defined by calculating the SVI during the 30 days prior to the financing minus the SVI during the previous 30 days, scaled by the SVI during the previous 30 days). Early equals one for financing provided to ventures that have initial product, a rough business plan and an incomplete management team. The venture has usually been in business less than two years, but has not sold their product commercially. Development equals one for financing provided to ventures with product in testing or pilot production. The venture has not generated sale revenue, but starts to implement the market development plan. Expansion equals one for financing provided to ventures in need of growth and expansion capital. The venture may not break even or trade profitably. Capital is used to finance increased production capacity, for market or product development, to provide additional working capital. BJ equals one if the venture is located in Beijing and zero otherwise. SH equals one if the venture is located in Shanghai and zero otherwise. GD equals one if the venture is located in Guangdong province and zero otherwise. ZJ equals one if the venture is located in Zhejiang province and zero otherwise. Ln(Investment) is the natural logarithm of the amount invested in the financing round, expressed in thousands of US dollars. Ownership is the ownership held by venture capital in the financing round. Ln(Number of investors) is the natural logarithm of the number of venture capital investors in the financing round. GVC equals one if a venture capital firm is established, controlled and operated by the central government or local government and zero otherwise. CVC equals one if a venture capital firm is a subsidiary of a corporation and zero otherwise. FVC equals one if a venture capital firm's headquarter is located overseas or its capital is from abroad and zero otherwise. Experience is the natural logarithm of one plus the number of years from the establishment of venture capital that makes the largest total investment in the financing round to the financing round. Ln(IPOs last year) is the natural logarithm of the number of IPOs in the previous year. Industry public market index is defined as the simple average of monthly returns of publicly traded firms in the same industry as the venture at the end of the month prior to the financing. All the regressions control for year and industry fixed effects. T-statistics are reported in parentheses. \\*\\*, \\*\\*, and \\* indicate significance at $1\\%$ $5\\%$ and $10\\%$ levels,respectively.  \n\nincluding Ln(IpOs last year), Industry public market index. The inverse Mills ratio obtained from the first stage regression is incorporated as an additional independent variable in the second stage regression.  \n\nTable 8 reports the results of the second stage of the Heckman procedure. The second step presents a regression analysis of premoney valuation on AsVI and other control variables including the inverse Mills ratio. As shown in Table 8, the significant inverse Mills ratio indicates that selection bias is present due to the omission of valuation data. However, after controlling for the selection effect, firms in industries with higher investor attention still have higher valuations. Specifically, one standard deviation increase in investor attention predicts an increase in firm valuations of $0.79\\%$ . The significant coefficient suggests that our results are robust with this alternative approach. In addition, when we examine the first round investments, we find consistent conclusions with those for the full sample, demonstrating that our results are not affected by the sample selection.  \n\n### 5.2. An instrumental variable approach to address endogeneity problem  \n\nIn this study, although we show that the price increase is not induced by fundamental information, we may have omitted important explanatory variables that could contribute to firm valuations. Judge et al. (1985) document that omitted variable bias could inflate the coeficients of correlated independent variables. This omission may cause us to falsely impute significance to the measure of investor attention to industries. We address this problem with an instrumental variable approach. The instrumental variable should be correlated with investor attention to industries, but unrelated to the residuals in our model. We employ two methods to construct the instrumentalvariables.  \n\nWe first adopt the median AsVI of other peer industries that share the same four-digit CVSource industry (or six-digit industry when we need to divide an industry into to more specific sub-industries) with the specific venture as the instrumental variable,13 defined as ASVI_IV. We believe this is a reasonable choice of an instrumental variable for two reasons. First, it is clear that AsVI and AsVI_IV are correlated. Industries used to measure AsVI and AsVIIV belong to the same four-digit industry and thus are naturally related, such as fodder and livestock breeding, building construction and real estate development. As a consequence, when individual investors pay attention to an industry, they are also interested in another closely related industries, causing a simultaneous increase in SVI for both of them. Second, once the median AsVI is determined, it should be matched to a specific industry. Therefore, it is unlikely that the AsVI of a specific industry can directly influence the valuation of firms in another industry.  \n\nIn addition, we construct an alternative instrumental variable using the mean of advertising expenditure of all listed firms in the same industry with the specific venture. There are two reasons to choose advertising expenditure as an instrumental variable of investor attention. First, as advertising increases firms’ exposure to consumers and investors, the increased visibility may draw the attention of potential investors (Barber and Odean, 2008; Ding et al., 2017). Grullon et al. (2004) also point out that firms with high advertising expenditure are more visible to investors and attract a larger number of both individual and institutional investors. Therefore, high advertising expenditure is related to high investor attention. Second, because the advertising expenditure of a large majority of private firms is unavailable, we use advertising expenditure of all public firms in China's A-share market to construct our instrumental variable. Obviously, the mean of advertising expenditure for all public firms in an industry is not directly associated with a specific private firm valuation.  \n\nConsistent with industry classification in our sample, we choose the third-level Shenwan classification (six-digit code) for all public firms. To match with the industries in our sample, we also manually divide the vaguely identified industries of public firms into subindustries or use the second-level industries to substitute industries with too few firms. The information of advertising expenditure comes from the “Notes to financial statements\" in the CSMAR database.14 \\*Notes to financial statements\"15 records annual accounting items from 2010 to 2019 for all IPO firms in China in detail. Unlike balance sheet, there are no standard items for each firm and thus we need to extract the items related to advertising expenditure. Specifically, we choose the items that contain “advertising\", “promotion\", \"publicity” and “exhibition\" and sum their expenses as total advertising expenditure. In the end, we obtain annual advertising expenditure for each listed firm in China.  \n\nAn ideal instrumental variable should be measured using the mean of advertising expenditure in the corresponding period with AsVI, i.e.,from financing day $-60$ to $^{-1}$ .

Panel A reports the result using the instrumental variable ASVIIV. The first stage regression is presented in Column (1). We find that the coefficient of ASVI IV is significant at the $1\\%$ level, showing that ASVI IV is an appropriate instrument for investor attention to industries. The predicted values for AsVI are obtained from the first stage regression and are incorporated into the second stage regressions in Column (2). In the second stage, we find that the impact of AsVI on pre-money valuation is statistically significant and positive. Panel B reports the result using the alternative instrumental variable AsVI_IV_Adv. The first stage regression is presented in Column (3) and the second stage regresson is presented in Column (4). The result in Panel B is consistent with that in Panel A, supporting our notion that firms in industries with higher investor attention are associated with higher valuations.  \n\n### 5.3. Alternative measures of investor attention to industries  \n\nThe AsVI used above is based on the change in SVI between the 30 days prior to the financing and the previous 30 days, which captures the deviation of investor attention from the “normal' part. However, the time window used to calculate the normal level is quite arbitrary. Da et al. (2011) use the median of Google SVI during the previous eight weeks as the benchmark level. Gao et al. (2019) document that the weekly change in Google SVI could well capture investor attention. Barber and Odean (2008) employ 252 trading days over the previous one year to measure “\"normal' trading volume. Therefore, we consider alternative measures of AsVI to examine ourresults.  \n\nIn Panel A of Table 10, we define △SVI_60d as  \n\n$$\n\\Delta\\mathrm{SVI}_{-}60\\mathrm{d}_{i,t}=\\frac{S V I_{i,(t-30,t-1)}-m e d\\big(S V I_{i,(t-60,t-31)},S V I_{i,(t-90,t-61)}\\big)}{m e d\\big(S V I_{i,(t-60,t-31)},S V I_{i,(t-90,t-61)}\\big)}\n$$  \n\nwhere SVI is the daily search frequency from Baidu Index based on the industry, $S V I_{i}$ ， $(t{-}30,t{-}1)$ is the SVI during the 30 days prior to the financing day $t,$ and $M e d(S V I_{i},$ (t-60,t-31), $S V I_{i,}$ (t-90,t-61) is the median SVI during the previous two months, i.e. from day $^{-90}$ to $^{-31}$ We winsorize the outliers, eliminate industry bias and standardize the △sVI_60d in Eq. (3), and finally obtain a measure of AsVI with a 60-day window, defined as AsVI_60d.  \n\nSimilarly, In Panel B of Table 10, we define △SVI_90d with a 90-day window as  \n\n$$\n\\Delta\\mathrm{SVL}.90\\mathrm{d}_{i,t}=\\frac{S V I_{i,(t-30,t-1)}-m e d\\big(S V I_{i,(t-60,t-31)},S V I_{i,(t-90,t-61)},S V I_{i,(t-120,t-91)}\\big)}{m e d\\big(S V I_{i,(t-60,t-31)},S V I_{i,(t-90,t-61)},S V I_{i,(t-120,t-91)}\\big)}\n$$  \n\nwhere SVI is the daily search frequency from Baidu Index based on the industry, $S V I_{i}$ $(t{-}30,t{-}1)$ is the SVI during the 30 days prior to the financing day t for industry $i,$ and $M e d(S V I_{i},$ $_{(t-60,t-31),S V I_{i}}$ $_{(t-90,t-61)},S V I_{i}$ $(t{-}120,t{-}91)$ is the median SVI during the previous three months, i.e. from day $^{-120}$ to $^{-31}$ . Thus, we also obtain a measure of AsVI with a 90-day window, defined as AsVI_90d, after winsorizing the outlier, eliminating industry bias and standardizing the △sVI_9od in Eq. (4).  \n\nTable 10 reports the results of these alternative measures. We find that the coefficient estimates of AsVI for both the 60-day window and 90-day window are significant and positive, suggesting that firms in industries with higher investor attention experience higher valuations even when investor attention is measured using different time windows. For example, the first column of Table 10 shows that one standard deviation increase in investor attention predicts an increase in firm valuations of $0.34\\%$ .Consistent with the results in the baseline model, we also show that investment size and market conditions have significantly positive influences on firm valuations. Ownership and the number of investors are negatively associated with firm valuations. Location has no significant relationship with firm valuations. The evidence suggests that our main results carry through with these alternative measures.  \n\nTo summarize, we deal with sample selection bias using a Heckman approach, address endogeneity problem using an IV approach, and repeat our baseline analysis using alternative measures of AsVI. After all these robust tests, our conclusion that an increase in AsVI predicts higher firm valuations continues to hold.  \n\n## 6. Syndication, experienced VCs and overpricing  \n\nThe above analysis provides direct evidence for the attention hypothesis by examining the long-run performance of firm valuations and the performance of VC investments when investor attention dissipates. According to the attention theory, we can imply that if an increase in firm valuations is driven by investor attention, this overvaluation could be attenuated by some adjustments of investment strategies that make VCs less vulnerable to investor sentiment, such as syndication or involvement of experienced VCs. However, if the price increase is due to fundamental information, investment strategies could not reduce firm valuations, on the contrary, could help  \n\nTable9 Regression analysis of instrumental variables.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"3\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">Panel A: Median ASVI of other peer industries</td><td colspan=\"2\">Panel B:Mean of AdvertisingExpenditure</td></tr><tr><td>IV 1st stage</td><td>IV 2nd stage</td><td>IV 1st stage</td><td>IV 2nd stage</td></tr><tr><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td>ASVI</td><td></td><td>0.0043**</td><td></td><td>0.1049**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(2.02)</td><td></td><td>(2.09)</td></tr><tr><td>ASVI_IV</td><td>0.3193***</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(14.70)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>ASVI_IV_Adv</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.5839**</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(2.43)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Early</td><td>2.6016*</td><td>-0.5712***</td><td>1.4520</td><td>-0.4943***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1.68)</td><td>(11.67)</td><td>(1.30)</td><td>(3.17)</td></tr><tr><td>Development</td><td>2.3680*</td><td>-0.3290***</td><td>-1.1385</td><td>-0.2496*</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1.80)</td><td>(7.92)</td><td>(1.14)</td><td>(-1.86)</td></tr><tr><td>Expansion</td><td>3.0492**</td><td>-0.1367***</td><td>-0.6659</td><td>-0.0639</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(2.33)</td><td>(3.29)</td><td>(-0.65)</td><td>(-0.50)</td></tr><tr><td>BJ</td><td>-0.5826</td><td>0.0066</td><td>-0.6277</td><td>-0.0008</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(-0.79)</td><td>(0.28)</td><td>(1.49)</td><td>(-0.01)</td></tr><tr><td>SH</td><td>-0.3896</td><td>0.0339</td><td>-0.3636</td><td>0.0341</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(-0.48)</td><td>(1.31)</td><td>(-0.75)</td><td>(0.56)</td></tr><tr><td>GD</td><td>-0.1658</td><td>0.0379*</td><td>-0.9687**</td><td>0.1063</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(-0.24)</td><td>(1.71)</td><td>(2.40)</td><td>(1.51)</td></tr><tr><td>ZJ</td><td>-0.6330</td><td>0.0592**</td><td>-0.8761</td><td>0.1156</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(-0.72)</td><td>(2.14)</td><td>(1.56)</td><td>(1.50)</td></tr><tr><td>Ln(Investment)</td><td>-0.2228</td><td>0.8918***</td><td>-0.2053*</td><td>0.9376***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1.19)</td><td>(149.68)</td><td>(1.74)</td><td>(52.60)</td></tr><tr><td>Ownership</td><td>0.0178</td><td>-0.0724***</td><td>0.0390</td><td>0.0106</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.99)</td><td>(-126.65)</td><td>(0.29)</td><td>(0.63)</td></tr><tr><td>Ln(Number of investors)</td><td>0.0181</td><td>-0.0418***</td><td>0.0319**</td><td>-0.0756***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.10)</td><td>(-7.02)</td><td>(2.17)</td><td>(-30.28)</td></tr><tr><td>GVC</td><td>0.1431</td><td>0.0059</td><td>-0.0889</td><td>-0.0423***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(-0.26)</td><td>(0.34)</td><td>(-0.74)</td><td>(2.95)</td></tr><tr><td>CVC</td><td>0.1315</td><td>-0.0188</td><td>0.6159*</td><td>-0.0631</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(-0.13)</td><td>(-0.59)</td><td>(1.80)</td><td>(1.21)</td></tr><tr><td>FVC</td><td>0.4761</td><td>0.0589*</td><td>-0.9526</td><td>0.0727</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.44)</td><td>(1.73)</td><td>(1.44)</td><td>(0.84)</td></tr><tr><td>Experience</td><td>0.4974*</td><td>-0.0234**</td><td>1.1854</td><td>-0.0969</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(-1.68)</td><td>(2.49)</td><td>(1.19)</td><td>(-0.79)</td></tr><tr><td>Ln(IPOs last year)</td><td>0.4429</td><td>0.0707***</td><td>-0.0279</td><td>-0.0185</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.97)</td><td>(4.90)</td><td>(0.14)</td><td>(-0.80)</td></tr><tr><td>Industry public market index</td><td>1.2461</td><td>0.0156</td><td>6.7039***</td><td>-0.6722*</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.71)</td><td>(0.28)</td><td>(5.58)</td><td>(1.83)</td></tr><tr><td>Constant</td><td>-5.4056</td><td>2.8371***</td><td>1.0080</td><td>3.6456***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(-0.52)</td><td>(8.68)</td><td>(0.72)</td><td>(22.08)</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>5615</td><td>5615</td><td>4121</td><td>4121</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.117</td><td>0.900</td><td>0.016</td><td>0.539</td></tr><tr><td>Year fixed effect</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Industry fixed effect</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table reports the results of investor attention to industries on firm valuations using an instrument variable approach. Panel A reports the results using the instrumental variable ASVIIV. ASVIIV is defined as the median ASVI of other peer industries that share the same four-digit CVSource industry (or six-digit industry when we need to divide an industry into to more specific sub-industries) with the industry of the specific venture.

Therefore, we investigate whether syndicated investments and involvement of experienced VCs reduce the effect of investor attention on firm valuations to provide further support for the attentionhypothesis.  \n\nHeughebaert and Manigart (2012) argue that having more investors involved in the investment decision is expected to improve the quality of the decision and reduce the risk of ventures (Jin et al., 2020). It is also well-documented that syndication alleviates the information asymmetry (Wright and Lockett, 2003; Cumming and Dai, 2010) and reduces overpricing (Cumming and Walz, 2010). Therefore, we examine the relationship between syndication and firm valuations. Following Cumming and Walz (2010) and Guo and Jiang (2013), we define syndication as a dummy which equals one if there is more than one VC investor in the same round and zero otherwise. Table 11 reports the results of the effect of syndicated investments on firm valuations. In Column (1), we examine the interaction between AsVI and syndication and find that syndicated investments significantly attenuate the effect of AsVI on pre-money valuation.  \n\nFurther, Column (2) and Column (3) report results for the subsamples of standalone investments and syndicated investments, respectively. The results show that the significant and positive relationship between AsVI and firm valuations occurs only in standalone investments but disappears in syndicated investments. This evidence suggests that syndication indeed reduces the effect of ASVI on firm valuations, which is consistent with the attention-induced hypothesis.  \n\nCumming and Walz (2010) also argue that more experienced managers are better able to forecast valuations precisely because they have a higher degree of skill and sophistication with respect to analyzing financial statements and forecasting firm valuations (Bushee, 1998; Butler and Goktan, 2013). More importantly, experienced VC firms have fewer incentives to overvalue investments given that they have more reputational capital at stake (Cumming and Walz, 2010). Consistent with this idea, we consider whether the experience of venture capitalists attenuates the effect of investor attention on firm valuations for VC-backed firms. Table 12 reports the regression results of venture capitalists’ experience on firm valuations. Following Gompers (1996), Nahata (2008) and Cumming and Walz (2010), we define experience as the natural logarithm of one plus the number of years from the establishment of venture capital that makes the largest total investment in the financing round to the financing round. The results in Column (1) show that experience has a significantly negative effect on pre-money valuation. Furthermore, when we examine the interaction variable between experience and ASVI, we find that the coefficient is also negative and significant, demonstrating that venture capitalists? experience reduces the effect of ASVI on firm valuations. This evidence suggests that having more experience makes VCs less vulnerable to investor sentiment and alleviates the overpricing induced by investor attention, supporting for the attention hypothesis.  \n\nTo summarize, we find that both syndicated investments and involvement of experienced VCs can reduce the effect of investor attention on firm valuations, which is inconsistent with the fundamental hypothesis that information-based firm valuations cannot be attenuated by investment strategies. Overall, our evidence provides further support for the attention hypothesis.  \n\n## 7. Conclusion  \n\nThis paper explores the relationship between investor attention to industries and firm valuations in the venture capital industry. Unlike previous analyses which focus on public markets, our paper, as far as we know, provides the first empirical study on how investor attention influences the asset pricing in the venture capital market.  \n\nUsing aggregate search frequency in Baidu, we construct a direct measure of investor attention to an industry (AsVI) and find several main results. First, VC-backed firms with higher AsVI during the 30 days prior to the financing exhibit higher valuations. This result is robust to a variety of diagnostics analyses, including sample selection bias, endogeneity problem and alternative measures of ASVI. Second, an increase in firm valuations is an attention-induced result rather than an information-based fundamental premium, which is supported by the evidence of a long-run reversal of firm valuations and worse performance of VC investments. Third, syndicated investments and involvement of experienced venture capitalists can attenuate the effect of investor attention on firm valuations, which further support the attention hypothesis.  \n\nOur findings show that the prices of venture capital investments are not just determined by the quality of ventures, the charac teristics of venture capital, or market conditions, but also influenced by investor attention. There is a tradeoff between investo: attention and the valuation that ventures can get. High attention can push up firm prices, however, as a tradeoff, the performance o both successful exits and exit return multiples is worse.  \n\nOur findings also suggest that the overpricing driven by investor attention can be attenuated through some adjustments of investment strategies. These strategies make venture capitalists less vulnerable to investor sentiment and reduce the overpricing, which facilitates future performance of VC funds and subsequently their ability to raise future funds.  \n\nTable10 Alternative measures of AsVI.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">Panel A: 60-day window</td><td colspan=\"2\">Panel B: 90-day window</td></tr><tr><td>Full sample</td><td>First round investments</td><td>Full sample</td><td>First round investments</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">ASVI_60d</td><td>0.0003**</td><td>0.0003**</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>(2.36)</td><td>(2.17)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>P06SV</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.0006**</td><td>0.0007**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(2.44)</td><td>(2.47)</td></tr><tr><td>Early</td><td>-0.5635***</td><td>-0.5445***</td><td>-0.5608***</td><td>-0.5409***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(-9.25)</td><td>(-8.41)</td><td>(-9.17)</td><td>(-8.31)</td></tr><tr><td>Development</td><td>-0.3232***</td><td>-0.3297***</td><td>-0.3192***</td><td>-0.3270***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(-6.24)</td><td>(-5.89)</td><td>(6.13)</td><td>(-5.81)</td></tr><tr><td>Expansion</td><td>-0.1278**</td><td>-0.1395**</td><td>-0.1237**</td><td>-0.1393**</td></tr><tr><td>BJ</td><td>(-2.53)</td><td>(2.53)</td><td>(2.44)</td><td>(2.51)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.0031</td><td>0.0015</td><td>0.0022</td><td>0.0007</td></tr><tr><td>SH</td><td>(0.13)</td><td>(0.06)</td><td>(0.09)</td><td>(0.03)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.0335</td><td>0.0097</td><td>0.0328</td><td>0.0098</td></tr><tr><td>GD</td><td>(1.21)</td><td>(0.35)</td><td>(1.18)</td><td>(0.36)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.0369*</td><td>-0.0001</td><td>0.0363</td><td>-0.0013</td></tr><tr><td>ZJ</td><td>(1.66)</td><td>(-0.01)</td><td>(1.63)</td><td>(-0.06)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.0560**</td><td>0.0129</td><td>0.0552**</td><td>0.0112</td></tr><tr><td>Ln(Investment)</td><td>(2.12) 0.8903***</td><td>(0.47)</td><td>(2.08)</td><td>(0.41)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(106.58)</td><td>0.9000***</td><td>0.8909***</td><td>0.8984***</td></tr><tr><td>Ownership</td><td>-0.0722***</td><td>(98.78)</td><td>(106.52)</td><td>(98.50)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>-0.0698***</td><td>-0.0724***</td><td>-0.0699***</td></tr><tr><td>Ln(Number of investors)</td><td>(-70.92) -0.0418***</td><td>(-67.39)</td><td>(-70.85)</td><td>(-66.95)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>-0.1501***</td><td>-0.0422***</td><td>-0.0353***</td></tr><tr><td>GVC</td><td>(-8.29)</td><td>(-6.62)</td><td>(-8.36)</td><td>(-5.87)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.0053</td><td>0.0317</td><td>0.0044</td><td>0.0308</td></tr><tr><td>CVC</td><td>(0.30)</td><td>(1.64)</td><td>(0.25)</td><td>(1.58)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-0.0193</td><td>0.0045</td><td>-0.0181</td><td>0.0065</td></tr><tr><td>FVC</td><td>(-0.64)</td><td>(0.13)</td><td>(-0.60)</td><td>(0.18)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.0596*</td><td>0.0529</td><td>0.0594*</td><td>0.0557</td></tr><tr><td>Experience</td><td>(1.85)</td><td>(1.49)</td><td>(1.84)</td><td>(1.56)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-0.0250***</td><td>-0.0213**</td><td>-0.0253***</td><td>-0.0224**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(-2.82)</td><td>(-2.16)</td><td>(-2.85)</td><td>(-2.26)</td></tr><tr><td>Ln(IPOs last year)</td><td>0.0721***</td><td>0.0721***</td><td>0.0696***</td><td>0.0690***</td></tr><tr><td>Industry public market index</td><td>(5.32)</td><td>(5.18)</td><td>(5.16)</td><td>(4.97)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.0275</td><td>0.0146</td><td>0.0268</td><td>-0.0134</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.49)</td><td>(-0.25)</td><td>(0.48)</td><td>(-0.23)</td></tr><tr><td>Constant</td><td>2.8141***</td><td>2.7971***</td><td>2.8271***</td><td>2.7590***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(22.31)</td><td>(23.19)</td><td>(22.94)</td><td>(22.76)</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>5621</td><td>4305</td><td>5614</td><td>4298</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.902</td><td>0.916</td><td>0.902</td><td>0.916</td></tr><tr><td>Year fixed effect</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Industry fixed effect</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table reports the influence of alternative measures of investor attention to industries on firm valuations.

Column (1) presents the results for firms with more than two rounds. Column (2) presents the results for firms with more than three rounds. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of the difference between post-money valuation and the amount of capital invested in the financing round, expressed in thousands of US dollars. ASVI is measured by regressing △SVI on industry dummies to control for industry differences, keeping the residuals, then normalizing these residuals by using their standard deviations (△sVI is defined by calculating the SVI during the 30 days prior to the financing minus the SVI during the previous 30 days, scaled by the SVI during the previous 30 days). Early equals one for financing provided to ventures that have initial product, a rough business plan and an incomplete management team. The venture has usually been in business less than two years, but has not sold their product commercially. Development equals one for financing provided to ventures with product in testing or pilot production. The venture has not generated sale revenue, but starts to implement the market development plan. Expansion equals one for financing provided to ventures in need of growth and expansion capital. The venture may not break even or trade profitably. Capital is used to finance increased production capacity, for market or product development, to provide additional working capital. BJ equals one if the venture is located in Beijing and zero otherwise. SH equals one if the venture is located in Shanghai and zero otherwise. GD equals one if the venture is located in Guangdong province and zero otherwise. ZJ equals one if the venture is located in Zhejiang province and zero otherwise. Ln(Investment) is the natural logarithm of the amount invested in the financing round, expressed in thousands of US dollars. Ownership is the ownership held by venture capital in the financing round. Ln(Number of investors) is the natural logarithm of the number of venture capital investors in the financing round. GVC equals one if a venture capital firm is established, controlled and operated by the central government or local government and zero otherwise. CVC equals one if a venture capital firm is a subsidiary of a corporation and zero otherwise. FVC equals one if a venture capital firm's headquarter is located overseas or its capital is from abroad and zero otherwise. Experience is the natural logarithm of one plus the number of years from the establishment of venture capital that makes the largest total investment in the financing round to the financing round. Ln(IpOs last year) is the natural logarithm of the number of IPOs in the previous year. Industry public market index is defined as the simple average of monthly returns of publicly traded firms in the same industry as the venture at the end of the month prior to the financing.

Constructing industry classification  \n\nIn our sample, we use the third-level industries of Shenwan industry classifications in CVSource database to measure investor attention to an industry. However, the names for some industries could not be searched directly and generate a valid SVI in Baidu Index. In addition, some industries are also not appropriate to be used directly as search terms, such as industries with too few firms or that are vaguely identified. In this section, we use four steps to address these problems. First, we try to substitute the industry by using a synonym for which Baidu Index can return a valid sVI and report the results in Table C1. Second, for some industries that contain too few firms, we use the second-level industry (four-digit code) as a substitute and report the results in Table C2.  \n\nThird, although Shenwan has well classified firm industries, there are still some industries that are vaguely identified and cannot reflect firms’ main business accurately. In this case, we manually divide the industries into existing industries or new sub-industries based on firms' main business. There is a specific case. Internet information services, Software Development and Computer application are emerging high-tech industries and the main business of firms in these industries are heavily overlapping. Therefore, we view these three industries as a whole and divide it into existing or new sub-industries based on firms′ main business. Table C3 reports the results.  \n\nFourth, for industries that could not be substituted by synonyms or financing rounds that have valuation data but no industry da we manually match each firm to the existing industries or to specific sub-industries based on their main business, and keep those firms that can be assigned to specific industries. Table C4 reports the results.  \n\nIn our paper, we search the names of industries in Baidu Index using Chinese language. However, we also report each industry in English in order to make them more convenient to understand. Appendix C tabulates the names of industries in three forms: English, Chinese and Chinese phonetic alphabets.  \n\nTableC1 Using synonyms to substitute the third-level industries.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td></tr><tr><td>Cement manufacturing</td><td>Cement</td></tr><tr><td>(水泥制造)</td><td>(水泥)</td></tr><tr><td>(Shui ni zhi zao)</td><td>(Shui ni)</td></tr><tr><td>Mechanical foundation</td><td>Mechanical components</td></tr><tr><td>(机械基础件)</td><td>(机械零件)</td></tr><tr><td>(Ji xie ji chu jian)</td><td>(Ji xie ling jian)</td></tr><tr><td>Refrigeration and air conditioning equipment</td><td>Air conditioning and refrigeration equipment</td></tr><tr><td>(制冷空调设备)</td><td>(空调制冷设备)</td></tr><tr><td>(Zhi leng kong tiao she bei) Livestock and poultry breeding</td><td>(Kong tiao zhi leng she bei)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Livestock breeding</td></tr><tr><td>(畜禽养殖)</td><td>(畜牧养殖)</td></tr><tr><td>(Chu qin yang zhi)</td><td>(Chu mu yang zhi)</td></tr><tr><td>Household chemical products</td><td>Household chemicals</td></tr><tr><td>（日用化学产品）</td><td>（日用化工品）</td></tr><tr><td>(Ri yong hua xue chan pin)</td><td>(Ri yong hua gong pin)</td></tr><tr><td>Measuring instruments</td><td>Instrumentation</td></tr><tr><td>(计量仪表)</td><td>(仪器仪表)</td></tr><tr><td>(Ji liang yi biao)</td><td>(Yi qi yi biao)</td></tr><tr><td>Appliance parts</td><td>Appliance components</td></tr><tr><td>(家电零部件)</td><td>(家电配件)</td></tr><tr><td>(Jia dian ling bu. jian)</td><td>(Jia dian pei jian)</td></tr><tr><td>Bijouterie</td><td>Jewelry</td></tr><tr><td>(珠宝首饰)</td><td>(珠宝)</td></tr><tr><td>(Zhu bao shou shi)</td><td>(Zhu bao)</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical preparations</td><td>Chemical medicine</td></tr><tr><td>(化学制剂)</td><td>(化学药品）</td></tr><tr><td>(Hua xue zhi ji)</td><td>(Hua xue yao pin)</td></tr><tr><td>Professional chain</td><td>Chain</td></tr><tr><td>(专业连锁店)</td><td>(连锁店)</td></tr><tr><td>(Zhu ye lian suo dian)</td><td>(Lian suo dian)</td></tr><tr><td>Printing and packaging machinery</td><td>Printing and packaging</td></tr><tr><td>(印刷包装机械)</td><td>(包装印刷)</td></tr><tr><td>(Yin zhi bao zhuang ji xie)</td><td>(Bao zhuang yin shua)</td></tr><tr><td>Electronic parts manufacturing</td><td>Electronic parts</td></tr><tr><td>(电子零部件制造)</td><td>(电子零件)</td></tr><tr><td>(Dian zi ling bu. jian zhi zao)</td><td>(Dian zi ling jian)</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacture of paints and coatings inks</td><td>Paints and coatings inks</td></tr><tr><td>(涂料油漆制造)</td><td>(涂料油漆)</td></tr><tr><td>(Tu liao you qi zhi zao)</td><td>(Tu liao you qi)</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nTable C1 reports the results of synonyms used to substitute the third-level industries.

Executive Summary  \n\nThe acquisition of financial resources is one of the key challenges entrepreneurs face as they start and grow their ventures. Venture capital (vC) has attracted exceptional prominence as a distinctive type of financing which is expected to generate aboveaverage performance in environments of high uncertainty. VCs are frequently portrayed as special investors that create value 1) by selecting the more promising ventures in the most promising industries and 2) by providing financial resources and additional support following their investment decisions. Despite the predominant view in the literature that VC increases the success of funded firms in uncertain environments, empirical evidence on this relationship is non-conclusive.  \n\nHence, we scrutinize whether and especially under which circumstances VCs provide value for the firms they fund. Following an evidence-based research tradition, we statistically integrate 76 empirical samples on 36,567 firms in a meta-analysis. Our baseline hypothesis focuses on the relationship between VC investment and funded firm performance. Subsequently we analyze whether and to what extent industry selection effects drive this relationship and which performance dimensions (profitability, growth, stock market performance) are affected by VC funding. In a third step, we argue that the direction and magnitude of the VC-success relationship may depend on the context. More specifically, we scrutinize whether the age of the funded firm, the pre vs. post-IPO status, and the cultural uncertainty avoidance moderate the relationship between VC investment and firm performance.  \n\nWe find a small positive performance effect of VC investment; strikingly, however, the effect vanishes if researchers control for industry selection effects. Furthermore, we find that the performance effect mainly relates to firm growth while profitability is unaffected. We also uncover that performance effects are reduced when the funded firms are very young or very mature. In addition, VC funding seems to lose value after the funded firm goes public.  \n\nThe empirical evidence from this study suggests that inter-industry selection plays a dominant role compared to intraindustry selection and value-adding activities by VCs. This indicates that readily available information about the structure, status, and dynamics of industries enables VCs to select the more promising industries. As researchers isolate the effect that VCs have on funded firms within an industry the comparative performance advantages of VC funded firms vanishes. This finding suggests that proposed advantages associated with VC investments are partially offset by disadvantages. In environments of missing or asymmetrical information, high risk and uncertainty, VCs might not be able to systematically identify the most promising firms within an industry. Further, the post-investment performance benefits including the actual provision of financial resources, managerial support, and monitoring may be offset by disadvantages. For instance, the financial resources provided by VCs may create a false sense of security and reduce the need to focus on close customer interaction and fast positive cash-flow generation. In addition, the funded firms might need to absorb the substantial transaction costs given the high degrees of risk and uncertainty which lowers their resulting performance. Overall, our results highlight that performance implications of VC investments for the funded firms largely depend on the context.  \n\n## 2. Introduction  \n\nAlfred Marshal pointedly stated that: “Capital is that part of wealth which is devoted to obtaining further wealth\" (e.g.,. Marshall and Marshall, 1879). Financial resources are of special importance for the survival and growth of firms as they enable a firm to acquire other value-creating resources such as human resources or physical resources (e.g. Barney, 1986). However, obtaining financial resources is especially burdensome in the entrepreneurial context due to the high degrees of novelty, uncertainty, and instability (Knight, 1921; McMullen and Shepherd, 2006; Stinchcombe, 1965), as well as pronounced information asymmetries (Amit et al., 1998; Megginson and Weiss, 1991). In consequence, many traditional financing forms are not available for entrepreneurs. However, venture capital (VC) has attracted prominence as a distinctive financing form that is expected to generate wealth in environments of uncertainty.  \n\nTheory suggests that in environments of uncertainty, venture capitalists (VCs) can create and appropriate value for themselves by deploying special mechanisms such as screening, selecting, staging, and monitoring individual investments (Amit et al., 1998; Baum and Silverman, 2004; Kaplan and Stromberg, 2001). Moreover, they can hedge themselves against risks resulting from uncertainty by diversifying and syndicating their investments at the portfolio level (Lockett and Wright, 2o01; Manigart et al., 2006). While these mechanisms might help to improve the VC investors' performance, scholars debate whether VC investments also benefit the funded firms.  \n\nIn light of the inherent uncertainty of the entrepreneurial process (McMullen and Shepherd, 2006), scholars advocating positive performance effects of VC investments for the funded firms highlight two important functions. They suggest that VCs are uniquely apt in selecting the more promising industries and firms; in addition they can also provide value after they selected the firms (Brander et al., 2002; Dimov and Shepherd, 2005; Dimov et al., 2007; Lerner, 1994). Being selected by a VC firm provides assurance to the founders and other resource providers including employees, customers, suppliers, and other investors (e.g.. Davila et al., 2003; Megginson and Weiss, 1991). Post-investment funded firms can benefit from the provision of financial resources as well as value-added functions such as managerial resources and access to the VC's social capital (e.g., Hellmann and Puri, 2002; Kaplan and Stromberg, 2004; MacMillan et al., 1989; Sapienza, 1992). Moreover, the monitoring of the funded firms might help the respective firms in using their resources more efficiently (e.g., Amit et al., 1998; Barry et al., 1990; Gompers, 1995; Sahlman,1990).  \n\nHowever, another group of scholars challenges whether VCs are able to select the most promising ventures since the inherent uncertainty of the entrepreneurial context makes it dificult to systematically identify more promising ventures (Aldrich and Kenworthy, 1999; Baum and Silverman, 2004). Uncertainty can also lead to substantial transaction costs (Williamson, 1973) which VCs might transfer to their funded firms' post investment in order to improve their own returns. Moreover, conflicts of interests might sway VCs to pressure entrepreneurs to pursue strategies that benefit their exit-oriented interest, but are not necessarily beneficial for the funded firms. In this regard, a prominent critique comes from Gompers (1996) and is known as the 'grandstanding argument'. He postulates that VCs take their funded firms to IPOs prematurely in order to hastily realize the significantexitvalues.  \n\nAddressing the theoretical debate in the empirical domain, an immense body of empirical research has scrutinized the relationship especially in recent years. However, empirical findings on performance implications of VC investments for the funded firms are “non-conclusive\" (Barney et al., 1996; Jelic et al., 2005). While some researchers find positive effects of VC financing (e.g., Brav and Gompers, 1997), other research suggests non-significant (e.g., Busenitz et al., 2004) or negative performance implications for the financed firms (e.g., Belden et al., 2001; Jain et al., 2008). Overall, various prominent authors characterize the VC research domain as fragmented and patchy (e.g., Wright and Robbie, 1998). Strikingly, no systematic aggregation and synthesis of the extant empirical evidence has been undertaken to date. As a consequence, the controversy in the theoretical domain, as well as the disjointed findings in the empirical domain, leave the community of scholars with important questions relating to whether, how, and especially under which circumstances VC investment benefits the performance of funded firms.  \n\nIn this study, we carry out an empirical synthesis of research on the effects of VC investments for their funded firms using meta-analysis and following an evidence-based research tradition (Rousseau, 2006). Our synthesis aims at increasing our understanding regarding if and especially how and under which circumstances VCs can create value for the funded firms. While a single, testable theory linking VC investment and funded firm performance has yet to emerge, we follow salient propositions that VCs have comparative advantages as financial intermediaries in environments of uncertainty. Hence, our analysis attributes particular attention to uncertainty and the role VCs can play in mitigating this uncertainty. We offer the following three main contributions to research.  \n\nFirst, building on prior theory, we identify specific mechanisms via which VC investments can augment funded firm performance. We aim at distinguishing between selection and post-investment effects. In this respect, our analysis uncovers that a crucial aspect is frequently ignored in extant research: VCs try to select the most promising industries (e.g., Gompers, 1995). This undertaking in consequence likely improves the funded firm performance relative to non-funded firms. However, the positive industry selection effects may lead the scholarly community to believe in the VCs' capabilities to select the best firms and subsequently add value. Yet, they could also camouflage poor performance once industries are selected. This is especially problematic when researchers theorize about intra-industry effects, yet in their empirical testing, ignore potential industry selection effects. Our quantitative synthesis of extant empirical research allows an estimation of the performance differentials which are based on industry selection effects vis-a-vis intra-industry effects. Hence, our analysis provides evidence of whether VC investors can gather the necessary information and adequately interpret this information to select the more promising industries and whether there are consequently able to add value by selecting the winners in an industry and supporting them. As firms that seek funding generally have already chosen specific industries, such analysis yields important indications regarding the additional valueVCs can providefor thesefirms.  \n\nSecond, in order to further understand how VC investments affect funded firm performance, we distinguish different performance dimensions. We juxtapose growth, stock market, and profitability-oriented performance dimensions to detect how VCs generate value under uncertainty. The strategic decision of whether profitability or growth should be the primary focus for entrepreneurial firms has been actively debated in the entrepreneurship literature. Different authors stress the importance of profitability as a means to obtain own financial resources and certainty about functioning business models which subsequently facilitate growth (Davidsson et al., 2009). Drawing on insights from the VC funded firms, we can test whether externally supplied financial capital and associated supplementary resources are an effective alternative strategic approach to achieve growth in environments of uncertainty. Additionally, such distinction facilitates insights as to whether the VC funded firms are able to achieve hybrid outcomes where both profitability and growth are increased. An increase in profitability, in addition to firm growth, would open a supplementary financial resource pool that would indicate additional future performance of the funded firm (Brinckmann et al., 2011; Levesque et al., 2012).  \n\nThird, we address the specific uncertainty context in which VC investments are beneficial for the funded firm. In fact, the term 'venture' capital suggests abilities to take on risks and effectively mitigate uncertainty. To date, however, we lack systematic evidence regarding contexts when VC investment improves funded firm performance. For instance, literature documents that VCs typically avoid investments in firms that are in the earliest stages (Wright and Robbie, 1998). Yet, recently authors report that VCs increasingly invest in earlier stages. However, we do not know whether VCs are able to equally perform in these distinct environments characterized by diferent degrees of uncertainty. Similarly, the IPO event implies special documentation requirements that are established to reduce the uncertainty investors and other stakeholders face. Hence, questions arise whether VCs - as stewards of uncertainty - can contribute value in these contexts. Finally, prominent scholars propose that the perception of uncertainty varies in cultural contexts. This leads to previously unaddressed questions whether VCs' uncertainty mitigation function is affected by the cultural context they operate in. In this article, we address these questions. We commence with a reflection of the nature of VC investment vs. alternative financing forms, followed by a discussion of the direct VC investmentfirm performance effects, before turning to the contextual moderators. Our research framework is depicted in Fig. 1.  \n\n## 3. Theoretical background and hypotheses  \n\n### 3.1. Venture capital vs. other forms of equity financing  \n\nWhile no commonly accepted or regulatory definition exists with regards to VC (Amit et al., 1998), prior literature generally characterizes VCs as institutional (Bessler and Kurth, 2007), formal (Bruton et al., 2009), and professional investors (da Silva Rosa et al., 2003; Gompers and Lerner, 2001; Hellmann and Puri, 2000; Smart et al., 2003) who are actively involved in investee firms (Sahlman, 1990). VCs typically invest in longer term, un-quoted, hence less liquid, risk equity that promises high returns (Dimov et al., 2007; Wright and Robbie, 1998). They invest at early as well as later stages in the firm's life cycle (Dimov et al., 2007).  \n\nThus, we distinguish VCs from less formally organized individual angel investors or groups of angel investors who generally invest only their own funds and tend to do so only in the early funding stages (Mason and Harrison, 2002). In contrast, VCs typically raise the funds they invest from other investors. Moreover, literature suggests that angel investors frequently pursue non-economic goals with their investments such as supporting entrepreneurs while VCs are focused on generating financial returns (Wright and Robbie, 1998). Many angel investors have acquired their net worth being an entrepreneur or manager and understand their investment as a form of 'giving back' to other entrepreneurs. In consequence, they might feel less pressure to appropriate value from their funded firms, while VCs have to generate substantial returns to satisfy their own investors and assure that they can raise new financial resources for their future funds.  \n\n![](images/220fb60055f86b6ab2339f6f3e7147503ccac162bded829de9fa3171c3ab45e1.jpg)  \nFig. 1. Studied relationships.  \n\nAnother type of investor supplying firms with financial resources is leveraged buyout (LBO) firms. However, in contrast to VCs, LBO firms primarily supply debt financing to complement equity investment for more established firms. LBOs commonly collateralize the supplied debt finance drawing on assets of the firm. Because VCs supply equity finance, they generally do not demand collateral for their investments, leaving them with a greater exposure to the risks of the funded firm. LBO firms' debt usually does not have investment grade status. Hence, LBO firms need to demand respective interest rates for their investments. As a consequence, LBO firms invest in firms that have sufficient, positive cash-flow. Meanwhile, VCs generally supply financial resources to firms that do not have positive cash-flow dynamics given their growth trajectory. Another key distinction with regard to VCs is that LBo firms generally assume control of the board, but do not actively engage in the firm's management (Sahlman, 1990). Following prior literature (e.g. Bruton et al., 2010; Gompers and Lerner, 1999a), we exclude business angels and (reverse) LBOs from our subsequent theorizing and empirical analysis.  \n\n### 3.2. Venture capital and firm performance  \n\nLiterature on VC distinguishes between two theoretical linkages between VC investments and the performance of funded firms: a positive selection effect and a post-investment value-added effect (Brander et al., 2002; Dimov and Shepherd, 2005; Dimov et al.,2007; Lerner, 1994). The selection effect itself can be divided into two effects: an industry and intra-industry selection effects.  \n\nVCs do not invest in all industry sectors equally, but select specific industries. Lee and Wahal (2004) show that VC is concentrated in certain industries such as software and biotechnology whereas firms in other industries such as hotel and lodging usually do not receive any VC investments. Other research documents that VC providers specifically select high-growth markets with a strong focus on technologies (Gompers, 1995; Roberts and Barley, 2004; Zacharakis et al., 2007). These specific industries offer more promising success rates in comparison to the general economy (Shane, 2008; Zacharakis et al., 2007). Especially emerging industries could present a fertile ground for investments as competition is limited, intra-industry experience is limited while VCs possess insights from analogous industry developments, VCs have networks to foster industry creation and to position their funded firms as emerging industry leaders, and industry growth prospects are substantial.  \n\nIn addition to selecting the more attractive industries, VCs can aim at picking the most promising ventures within those industries in meticulous processes. In order to avoid adverse selection in the pre-investment stage, VCs conduct comprehensive multiple-phase evaluations of the industry, the firm, and the executive team. In particular, they assess perceived risks and expected returns (Hall and Hofer, 1993; Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984). Following the due diligence assessment, uncertainty and potential agency costs decrease (Arthurs and Busenitz, 2003). In consequence, a VC investment can serve as a positive signal to other potential resource providers such as customers, suppliers, employees, or lenders. Thus, VCs can act as vicarious selectors (Baum and Silverman, 2004). Substantial scholarly inquiry scrutinizes these intra-industry selection factors highlighting elements such as the founding team (e.g., Baum and Silverman, 2004; Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984) or product or service characteristics (e.g., Tyebjee andBruno,1984).  \n\nA major part of the literature on VC investments deals with the value VCs add after the initial investment. One of the proposed principal benefits are the financial resources provided by the VCs to the funded firms which engage in risky and dynamic markets where traditional forms of investments frequently cannot be obtained (Ueda, 2004; Wright and Robbie, 1998). In consequence, these financial resources can be deployed to acquire other value-creating resources such as human resources or physical resources. During the duration of the investment, VCs are generally expected to offer value-added services which go beyond the provision of financial resources (MacMillan et al., 1989; Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984). VCs assist their portfolio companies in networking, recruiting, and strategic decision-making (e.g., Lindsey, 2008; Makela and Maula, 2005; Thomas Hellmann, 2002). The access to a VC's network can increase firm performance by providing important contacts with stakeholders such as potential customers, suppliers, and employees. VCs also help firms to attract other types of funding in the later stages of the venture's life cycle, for example by attracting high-quality underwriters for an IPO (Bottazzi and Da Rin, 2002; Lerner, 1994; Megginson and Weiss, 1991). Moreover, VCs can ad to the professionalization of the funded firms by improving governance structures, human resource policies, and instituting stock option plans (Thomas Hellmann, 2002). VCs' knowledge and skills usually complement the capabilities of the funded firm and, thus, increase the funded firm's performance (MacMillan et al., 1989; Sapienza, 1992). Furthermore, an investment by a VC can act as an endorsement and increase the legitimacy of a firm which is an important prerequisite for future resource acquisitions and venture growth (Gulati and Higgins, 2003; Megginson and Weiss, 1991; Stuart, 1998; Zimmerman and Zeitz, 2002).  \n\nIn comparison to other owners, VCs have a monitoring incentive which provides an opportunity to decrease the probability of moral hazard in the absence of incentive compensation (Jensen and Meckling, 1976). Additionally, VCs have the expertise to control managerial actions (Gompers, 1995). In contrast to other institutional shareholders such as mutual or pension funds, VCs often have close relationships with firms which provide them with opportunities to monitor via different governance mechanisms such as representation on the boards of funded firms (Lerner, 1995). Due to the longer-term horizon of their investments and high information asymmetry, shareholder activism of VCs is high (Sapienza et al, 1996; van den Berghe and Levrau, 2002). In consequence, VCs' monitoring should positively influence the funded firms' development. These various mechanisms indicate that VCs can add value to funded firms' post investment.  \n\nStrikingly, while extant research frequently theorizes about the value of financial and value-added resources for the funded firms, many authors do not consider that the industry selection effects influence performance, leading them to overestimate the intra-industry performance effect. To shed more light on industry selection and intra-industry performance effects, we subsequently distinguish between performance effects based on all prior empirical evidence and evidence derived from studies that control for industry selection effects. We posit:  \n\nHypothesis 1. VC investments increase the performance of the funded firms.  \n\nHypothesis 2. Performance effects of VC investments are smaller in studies controlling for industry effects than in studies not controlling for industry effects.  \n\nIn sum, selection and post-investment value adding activities by VCs should lead to an increased performance of VC-backed firms. However, it can also be argued that financial resources provided by VC investors can have detrimental effects for the funded firms as they can create a false sense of security and reduce the need to focus on close customer interaction and fast revenue generation. Moreover, it is questionable whether VCs are able to identify and foster the most promising ventures in contexts of uncertainty (Amit et al., 1998; Manigart et al., 1997; Zacharakis et al., 2007), and more specifically when principal-agent problems such as adverse selection and moral hazard are present (Aldrich and Kenworthy, 1999; Cumming, 2006; Gompers, 1995; Hellman et al., 2000; Masulis and Nahata, 2011; Maula and Murray, 2002). In consequence, these challenges might lead to considerable transaction costs that need to be absorbed by the funded firm (Williamson, 1973). Moreover, conflict of interests might sway VCs to advise or pressure entrepreneurs to pursue strategies that benefit their exit-oriented interest, but are not necessarily beneficial for the funded firm itself (Gompers, 1996).  \n\nSuch disadvantages of VC investments may partially offset their benefits in specific circumstances leading to lower performance effects of the investments. Furthermore, they may lead to a higher effect on specific types of performance measures. Hence, in a next step, we further detail our base-line hypotheses and distinguish between the effects VC investments have on different performance dimensions and identify conditions under which VC investments should prove more beneficial.  \n\n#### 3.2.1. Types of performance outcomes  \n\nSeveral authors have argued that organizational performance is a multi-dimensional construct ( Combs et al., 2005; Davidsson et al., 2009; Murphy et al., 1996). Following Combs et al. (2005) three dimensions of financial performance can be distinguished: profitability, growth, and stock market success. Due to the specific characteristics of VC investments, they are likely to influence different firm success dimensions in different ways.  \n\nAs most VCs view an IPO as the preferred exit option which will raise their returns a central goal of VCs is to increase shareholder value by increasing the market valuation of their funded firms (Barry, 1994). In this respect, a strategic trade-off exists between aiming for growth or profitability of the funded firm (Davidsson et al., 2009). Extant literature suggests that firms which receive VC investments are likely to put greater emphasis on growth than on profitability (Belden et al., 2001). Literature documents that VC-funded firms aim to become market leaders in fast growth markets in order to command a premium when exiting their investments (e.g., Roberts and Barley, 2004). This has consequences for the value they add based on both selection and post-investment effects.  \n\nSelection and self-selection effects will characterize funded firms as firms in growth markets, with a likely early growth trajectory as a selection indicator used by the VCs and a strong strategic orientation towards further growth. Due to the VCs' emphasis on growth one can expect a selection process in favor of high-growth firms rather than profitable businesses.  \n\nGiven the strategic orientation towards growth and increasing the market valuation, post-investment VCs have an incentive to provide resources that enable such strong growth including access to their networks, managerial resources, effective monitoring systems, or additional financial capital. These resources can provide an added value for funded firms in their attempt to augment their growth. Furthermore, the support of VCs for the funded firms' growth strategies may be valued by other shareholders leading to an increased market valuation. Meanwhile, profitability might be of a secondary strategic concern and becomes more relevant only after a beneficial competitive position is established. Although high growth can eventually pay off in terms of higher profitability (for a review of the literature on the relationship between growth and profits see Davidsson et al., 2o09), for example, through economies of scale, economies of scope, and learning economies, we expect that VC investments have more immediate effects on growth because of the strategic preferences of VCs, selected and self-selected entrepreneurs.  \n\nFurthermore, VCs add value post-investment by sending a positive signal to potential stakeholders (Gompers, 1995; Gompers and Lerner, 1999b; Lerner, 1994; Lerner, 1995). A VC investment will attract stakeholders with similar interests who perceive the selection by VCs as a positive signal. As a consequence, their willingness to interact with the funded firm increases. Previous research has shown that firm growth accelerates in the months immediately following the VC investment event indicating a positive selection effect on growth (Davila et al., 2003). At the same time, selection effects should not result in higher profitability - at least not in the short run - as it affects the behavior of stakeholders rather than the operational efficiency of the funded firm.  \n\nBased on the above considerations, we conjecture that the selection and post-investment value-added activities primarily relate to the growth and stock market dimensions of firm performance, while operational improvements with regard to profitability are relatively smaller and follow with a substantial time lag. We posit:  \n\nHypothesis 3a. VC investments increase the funded firms' growth more than profitability of the funded firms.  \n\nHypothesis 3b. Venture capital investments increase the stock market performance more than the profitability of the fundec firms.  \n\n#### 3.2.2. Funded firm age  \n\nIt is likely that the performance implications of VC funding are also contingent on the characteristics of the firms and their operating context because VC investments and involvement may not be equally effective in all types of firms and in all types of environments. A key characteristic in this regard is the age of the funded firms as newer firms imply substantially elevated degrees of risk and uncertainty (e.g., Aldrich, 1979; Knight, 1921; Shepherd et al., 2000). A more established firm has an operating history which can help in judging its management, initial progress, the market context, and future prospects. In contrast, new firms face a liability of newness due to the absence of an operating history and lack of existing relationships with key partners such as customers, employers, investors, or suppliers (Aldrich and Wiedenmayer, 1993; Stinchcombe, 1965). Thus, potential stakeholders may be reluctant to interact with new ventures due to the uncertainty involved in such interactions. An operating history enables resource providers to better assess risks and in consequence enables financial transactions. Given that the uncertainty and risks decrease as the firms mature and information about actual operations and performance becomes available, there might be an optimal time for VCs to invest.  \n\nRegarding the selection of the most promising firms, the elevated degrees of uncertainty in the earliest days of a firm's existence may have a negative effect on the VC selection process. Nascent and new firms have a higher failure rate than their more established counterparts (Stinchcombe, 1965; Thornhill and Amit, 2003). Because uncertainty is very high, the value of the firm's future cash flows is difficult to predict even for specialized VC investors, which might limit the positive selection effects in the earliest stages. Moreover, VC investors cannot rely on an operating history of these firms, which might make it impossible to ascertain whether the TMTs function well,if the products under development are competitive, or if customers will purchase and repurchase from the new firm. Thus, the positive selection effects could be lower in the very early stages of the firm's life cycle as compared to later stages.  \n\nFurthermore, high uncertainty may lead to increased agency-problems between VC investors and managers, making the effective transfer and deployment of financial and value-added resources difficult and costly (Sapienza and Gupta, 1994). Even if the objective of managers and VC investors are similar, they may disagree about the strategies to achieve these objectives leading to a perilous situation for the funded firms (Sapienza and Gupta, 1994). Thus, the post-investment value-adding activities by VCs may not be as effective in newly established ventures as they should be later on.  \n\nYet, if the funded firms are very mature and information about the focal firms' management team, operating history, effective strategies, and market dynamics are existent, the degree of uncertainty decreases. As uncertainty decreases, VCs should be able to select the more promising firms. However, previous research has reported that accuracy in VCs' decision-making regarding investment decisions decreases when they possess a larger amount of information about the firm that seek funding (Zacharakis and Shepherd, 2001). At the same time, VCs' unique benefits vis- $\\cdot\\grave{\\mathbf{a}}$ -vis other financial intermediaries also decreases as uncertainty diminishes (Amit et al., 1998). In other words, if a long operating history is observable, various investor types might be able to select the more promising firms. In addition, VC is relatively costly if uncertainty is low. This could lead to adverse selection effects of firms aiming for VC finance in later stages when more traditional forms of financing are also available.  \n\nThe positive post-investment effects relating to financial resource acquisition should also diminish as firms mature and additional financial intermediary types provide financial resources. For instance, assets that have been accumulated previously, can serve as a collateral opening up opportunities for debt financing. Furthermore, the positive post-investment value added effects of VCs likely also decrease since firms that already have experienced high growth over an extended time should have information and systems in place to manage the growth. Moreover, during their existence the focal firms had time to build up their social capital and develop effective ties with their environment (Stinchcombe, 1965). The resulting larger resource base should decrease the need and value of resources VCs can supply. Although more information enables absolute positive selection effects, reduced relative selection effects, adverse selection effects, and reduced post VC investment effects might decrease the performance of older, more established firms that receive VC funding especially relative to firms that are able to obtain other types of financing.  \n\nOverall, if we assume that a trade-off exists between the lower value VCs can add to funded firms and their increasing absolute ability to select the most promising ventures when uncertainty decreases in the course of the firm's life cycle, there should be an optimal firm age when VC investments increases the funded firms performance the most. Following uncertainty-based arguments, we expect that very early stage investments will perform sub-optimal due to excessive levels of uncertainty resulting from a lack of information. At the same time, we conjecture that the benefits of VC investments decrease when firms mature due to the abundance of information. Hence, we hypothesize that VC investment and funded-firm performance follows an inverted U-shape with respect to funded firm age.  \n\nHypothesis 4. Firm age has an inverted U-shape relationship with the VC-funded firm performance link such that firms in growth stages benefit more from VC investments than new ventures and very mature firms.  \n\n#### 3.2.3. Pre and post-IPO effects  \n\nHaving argued that firm age has an influence on the VC-performance relationship, we now look at the effects of a unique event in a firm's life cycle: an IPO. An IPO is a preferred exit option of VC providers (Barry, 1994). At the same time, VC providers generally keep a part of their stake in the venture even after the firm goes public (Barry et al., 1990; Megginson and Weiss, 1991). Yet, it is unclear whether the link VC investment-funded firm performance link is stronger pre-IPO than post-IPO.  \n\nOne of the key differences in the post-IPO context in comparison to the private firm context is the availability of information. Public markets are regulated and demand substantial information about the listed firms in regular intervals (Benston, 1973). Hence, information asymmetry and uncertainty for stakeholders decreases once the firm goes public. Following prior arguments, the increased availability of information and the reduced levels of asymmetric information should lower the VCs' relative advantage as financial intermediary specialists with an expertise in environments of incomplete and asymmetric information (Amit et al.,1998).  \n\nAlthough potential shareholders may value the selection by VCs when making their own investment choices (Megginson and Weiss, 1991), this signaling effect, however, should decrease when firms achieve an IPO since the public listing itself is an indicator of prior success (Ritter and Welch, 2002). In other words, potential stakeholders may perceive the IPO itself as a sufficient positive signal to start engaging and interacting with the firm. Hence, a positive selection effect of VC-funding may decrease after a firm goes public.  \n\nFurthermore, an important benefit of publicly-traded firms is their greater access to financial resources (Ritter and Welch, 2002). While in private markets, VC investments are often the only source of finance for entrepreneurial firms which operate in dynamic environments and lack the collateral to secure debt-financing (Ueda, 2004; Wright and Robbie, 1998), this unique advantage of acquiring VC diminishes when the firm is listed on public markets. Furthermore, the provision of value-added managerial support or monitoring provided by VC investors are generally replaced by systems required for publically listed firms. An IPO leads to a change in ownership structure which has effects on monitoring (Ritter and Welch, 2002). Monitoring by institutional investors and efficient markets for corporate control will decrease the necessity of VC monitoring. Similarly, the need for VCs to provide access to networks and to assist with recruiting and strategic decision-making decreases (e.g., Lindsey, 2008; Makela and Maula, 2005; Thomas Hellmann, 2002) as IPO firms can now rely on other stakeholders for support.  \n\nA final argument for a weaker relationship between VC and funded-firm performance post-IPO is provided by Gompers (1996). He cautions that VC investors may urge firms to go public prematurely in order to maximize their own benefits. If the stock market participants are not ready to invest in the company because team, operations, products, and market standing are not mature enough, an IPO may have detrimental effects for firms. Thus, if Gompers' (1996) grandstanding argument applies, VCbacked firms that had an IPO should show lower performance levels after their public listing. Hence, in addition to age effects, we expect that the fact of being traded in public markets should negatively impact the VC investment-funded firm performance. We put forth:  \n\nHypothesis 5. The relationship between VC investments and funded firm performance is stronger pre-IPO than post-IPO  \n\n#### 3.2.4. Uncertainty avoidance  \n\nPrevious research indicates that the benefits of a VC investment for the funded firm additionally depend on the country in which a firm is located (Chahine et al., 2007; Sapienza et al., 1996). Such cross-country differences of the VC investmentperformance relationship might be attributable to specific characteristics of the national culture. According to Hofstede (1980), national cultures differ with respect to various dimensions. Because VCs often engage in highly uncertain businesses operating in industries that are characterized by technological disruption, varying customer needs, and changing competition (Gompers, 1995), uncertainty avoidance is a cultural dimension with a high potential to influence the outcomes of VC investments. Although uncertainty avoidance has been reported to influence VC investments (Li and Zahra, 2012) and entrepreneurial activity in general (Lee and Peterson, 2000; Wennekers et al., 2007), we are not aware of empirical findings which depict how uncertainty avoidance affects the VC investment-funded firm performance relationship.  \n\nThe degree of uncertainty avoidance of a culture affects the behavior of firms, investors, and other stakeholders in a society. This likely impacts the selection and post selection effects of VC investments on funded firm performance. Li and Zahra (2012) argue that VCs in highly uncertainty avoidant countries may on average choose less risky investments. Even though lower risk VC funded firms may have a greater likelihood to survive, the aggregate effect of selecting lower risk investments should still cumulate in lower performance because lower risk is related to lower returns (Fama and MacBeth, 1973; Markowitz, 1959).  \n\nAdditionally, VCs in countries characterized by high uncertainty avoidance likely provide less financial resources to the funded firms (Li and Zahra, 2012) as they spread their funds more broadly to achieve greater risk reduction. In consequence, the provision of less financial capital allows only more modest growth trajectories. With respect to the monitoring, uncertainty avoidance should increase the monitoring costs. In consequence, increased monitoring costs such as legal and reporting costs may lower the performance in comparison to funded firms in other countries where firms do not have to undertake these additional efforts. Furthermore, some value-added activities that VCs commonly undertake may be affected adversely by high uncertainty avoidance in a society. For example, due to high uncertainty avoidance networking and recruiting support by VCs may not be as effective because potential networking partners and key employees may be reluctant to work with VC-backed firm based on their assumption that VC funded firms take risks. In more general terms, a VC investment hence may prevent various stakeholders such as potential employees, other investors, customers, and suppliers to transact with the VC-backed firm. For example, highly skilled workers may opt for a position in an established firm which is perceived as less risky or they may demand a premium that compensates them for the greater risk perceived. Since premiums imply additional costs to the funded firms, the performance of VC-backed firms in consequence likely decreases. Drawing attention to the cultural impact on the perception of VC investments, we put forth our final hypothesis:  \n\nHypothesis 6. A higher degree of uncertainty avoidance in a culture will have an adverse effect on the relationship between the VC investment and the performance of the funded firm.  \n\n## 4. Method  \n\n### 4.1. Study identification and sample  \n\nIn order to identify empirical studies investigating the relationship between VC investments and firm performance, we followed a four-step-procedure: First, we performed computerized keyword searches in the databases Business Source Premier, EconLit, ABI Inform, and SSRN. We used combinations of the following VC-related and performance-related keywords: venture capital, financing and performance, success, profitability, growth, market valuation, and underpricing. The choice of databases which we searched enabled us to locate published as well as unpublished studies. Second, we searched relevant journals in entrepreneurship Journal of Business Venturing, Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, Venture Capital), strategy (Strategic Management Journal, Academy of Management Journal), and finance literature (Journal of Finance, Review of Financial Studies, Journal of Banking and Finance, Journal of Financial Economics) manually. We considered all volumes published after 1980. Third, we checked the reference sections of the identified studies for further work on the subject. Fourth, we contacted researchers through listservs for unpublished material in order to decrease a potential publication bias.  \n\nTo be included in this meta-analysis, the study needed to address VC investments and funded-firm performance at the organizational level. The measure of VC investment needed to be in line with our definition. We particularly excluded related types of private investments such as informal investments (e.g., angel financing) or debt finance (e.g., LBOs) studies. In order to assure that these types of financing were not included in studies investigating VC effects, we screened every paper with a special focus on the respective sample description sections. Where full text search options were available, we additionally searched the full text of each candidate study for specific keywords including angel, informal, LBO, and private equity to minimize the risk that the underlying studies included such divergent investment types. Furthermore, it was required that the empirical studies underlying this meta-analysis, report statistics that can be converted into correlation-based effects sizes. Such statistics include the results of t-tests (t-values or corresponding p-values), 2-by-2 Chi-square test values, means and standard deviations for subgroups and frequency tables. For the conversion of relevant statistics into r, we used the effect size calculator provided by David Wilson on the Campbell Collaboration's website. Furthermore, we did not include studies (e.g., Fischer and Pollock, 2004) if the bivariate statistics are based on panels with different data points per firm in order to avoid a bias resulting from the potential violation of the independence assumption. If studies matched our inclusion criteria, but did not include the necessary statistics, we contacted the authors and asked them to provide us with these statistics.  \n\nAnother problem researcher face when conducting a meta-analysis is that some articles are based on the same sample. Detecting such repeated samples ensures that the analysis does not contain a bias due to the overrepresentation of specific samples. We applied a heuristic similar to the one suggested by Wood (2008) to identify duplicate samples. As a starting point, we identified overlappings in authorships. Subsequently, we checked for similarities in study characteristics, sample sizes and effect sizes. In a second step, we carefully compared sample description to identify similar samples used by different authors due to their availability in databases. Whenever one sample was used in more than one study (e.g., Arthurs and Busenitz, 2006; Arthurs et al., 2008, 2009), we selected the study that used the largest number of firms, so as to include a sample only once and avoid potential biases (Hunter and Schmidt, 2004). Using the above-described procedure, we identified 76 independent samples that stem from 48 studies. The two numbers differ because some studies reported statistics for several independent samples.  \n\nLastly, we checked whether there are outliers in our sample. We found that three samples have produced correlations which are more than 2 standard deviations below the mean. All of the respective samples stem from the study by Wong and Wong (2008). We ran all analyses without these three samples. However, as the results did not change significantly, we report the results for the full sample.  \n\nTable 1 contains a brief description of each sample with respect to variables examined in this paper. Most of the studies compare VC-backed to non-VC-backed firms. Moreover, studies frequently include IPO events because this is one common, well-documented exit option for VCs. Five studies apply continuous measures of VC investments such as the share of equity held by VCs or the number of board members that are representatives of VC firms. A majority of researchers focuses on stock market-based measures of firm performance such as underpricing, as a short-term indicator and buy-and-hold abnormal returns for longer timeframes. Fewer studies are concerned with the effects of VC on the profitability or growth of firms. The sample is based primarily on firms from North America, Europe, and Asia.  \n\n### 4.2. Measures  \n\nWe coded dependent, independent, and moderator variables for all included studies. The dependent variable in this study is firm performance. In order to obtain a broad picture of the relationship between VC investments and firm performance, we included three dimensions of financial performance: profitability, growth, and stock market performance (Combs et al., 2005).  \n\nIn addition, we coded a dummy variable that has the value 1 if researchers controlled for industry effects in the respective primary study, and 0 if industry effects were not controlled for. It is noteworthy that the industry control dummy refers to whether the underlying study used industry control methods that affect the bivariate statistics because our meta-analytical approach is based on the bivariate statistics of the primary studies (Hunter and Schmidt, 2004). Methods addressing industry effects at the bivariate level include a focus on a single industry or a matching procedure that includes industry as a matching parameter.  \n\nMoreover, we coded the average age of the firms in the samples to assess whether the underlying studies focus on established or newer firms. While we were able to use the continuous variable in the multivariate analyses, we needed to classify the studies with regard to firm age for the bivariate analyses. In order to obtain a differentiated understanding in the bivariate analysis and facilitate a robustness test of our multivariate inverted u-shaped effects tests, we divided the studies in three groups: 1) studies investigating mature firms when the average firm age in the studies was more than 12 years (Brinckmann et al., 2010; Zahra, 1996), 2) semi-established firms if the sample firm age average was between 6 and 12 years, and 3) new firms if firms in the studies on average were less than 6 years old (Zahra et al., 20o0). Furthermore, we coded whether the sample firms are in pre-IPO (0) or post-IPo stages (1).  \n\nThird, we measured uncertainty avoidance based on the index developed by Hofstede (1980). We used the uncertainty avoidance index for the regression analysis. For the bivariate analysis, we categorized the studies in two groups based on the degree of uncertainty avoidance of the country. The threshold for the categorization was an uncertainty avoidance score of 52 which equals the mean value of all uncertainty avoidance scores in our sample. This marker implies that Australia is the country with the highest uncertainty avoidance index $\\mathrm{'UAI}=51\\$ ) in the category of cultures with low uncertainty avoidance, whereas Germany with an uncertainty avoidance score of 65 is the country with the lowest uncertainty avoidance score in the group of cultures with high uncertainty avoidance. Because there are no cultures in the sample that have uncertainty avoidance scores slightly above the threshold, the categorization leads to distinct groups. In particular, the Anglo-Saxon countries, Hong Kong and Singapore, belong to the group of countries with low uncertainty avoidance whereas Germany, France, Belgium, Taiwan and Japan are considered as cultures with high uncertainty avoidance.  \n\nIn addition, we coded three control variables. We coded whether the sample stems from a published article (o) or an unpublished work (1). Regarding the performance measure we coded whether it was assessed subjectively (1) or objectively (0). With respect to VC investment, which is the independent variable in our research, we coded whether researchers used a dummy variable or if they applied a continuous measure for VC investments. Continuous measures include the percentage of shares held by VCs (e.g., Bruton et al., 2009; Florin, 2005) or the number of board members that were sent by VCs (e.g., Thompson, 1993; Williams et al., 2006).  \n\n### 4.3. Analyses  \n\nIn this paper, we follow an evidence-based research approach to complement individual studies and narrative reviews which frequently suffer from cognitive and normative biases of researchers, sampling problems, measurement problems, stochastic effects, and questions regarding the external validity of the findings (Glass, 1976; Hedges and Olkin, 1985). Meta-analysis is a method to synthesize empirical research on important questions that have been subject to extensive research in the literature (Hunter et al., 1982). Meta-analysis offers several advantages for academic research. First, compared to narrative reviews, metaanalysis systematically quantifies the relationships between the variables. While empirical analysis in management science generally focuses only on the significance of the scrutinized relationship, meta-analysis draws attention to the effect size and hence the strength of the relationships between variables. The standardization of effect sizes in meta-analysis allows a direct comparison of different effects. Second, in comparison to small sample field studies, meta-analysis offers more statistical power. Third, meta-analytic reviews can control for a selection bias resulting from the publication review processes. Fourth, metaanalysis can scrutinize moderating variables beyond the ones identified in individual studies and hence depict novel contingencies of proposed relationships. In sum, meta-analyses provide insights that go beyond the summation of the incorporated parts. It enables researchers to obtain advanced estimates on true relations and provides a useful way to advance theory-building (Hunter and Schmidt, 2004; Rauch and Frese, 2007).  \n\nFor our analyses we used Pearson's correlation $r$ as the effect size. Whenever the $r$ was not available, we transformed other statistics such as Student t tests or means and standard deviations into the effect size $r.$ We then corrected the effect size for sampling errors before calculating the mean effect in the bivariate analyses. A $90\\%$ confidence interval indicates whether an effect is significant. If the interval does not include zero it can be assumed that the effect differs significantly from zero (Hunter and Schmidt,2004).  \n\nTable 1 Overview of studies.

We relied on several methods to detect heterogeneity and, thus, an indication for the existence of potential moderator effects. First, we calculated an $80\\%$ credibility interval which suggests a homogenous population of studies if it does not include zero (Hunter and Schmidt, 2004). Furthermore, we calculated the share of variance which is attributable to sampling errors. According to Hunter and Schmidt (2004) a share of variance attributable to sampling error above $75\\%$ indicates a homogenous population. Additionally, we calculated $\\mathsf{Q-}$ and $1^{2}$ -statistics. Both also serve as indicators of heterogeneity (Higgins and Thompson, 2002; Higgins et al, 2003). A Q-value beyond a certain threshold (depending on the degrees of freedom) indicates a heterogeneous population. Similarly, a rather high $1^{2}$ -value suggests heterogeneity between studies.  \n\nFor the moderator analyses, we divided the sample into sub-groups. Subsequently, we calculated mean effect sizes, confidence, and credibility intervals for each sub-group. If a moderating relationship exists, the confidence intervals of the subgroups do not overlap. In addition, we calculated all above-described indicators of heterogeneity for each subgroup. If a moderator effect exists, the within-sub-group variation between studies should decrease whereas there should be a significant between sub-group variation. Furthermore, the average share of variance attributable to sampling error should increase compared to the overall analysis. To further check whether the effect sizes differ significantly between sub-groups, we calculated respectivezvalues.  \n\nIn order to assure robustness of our findings, we relied on two different meta-analytic approaches: a traditional bivariate technique proposed by Hunter and Schmidt (2004) and a meta-analytic regression suggested by Lipsey and Wilson (2001). Metaanalytic regressions use moderating variables as independent variables to predict the inverse coeficient adjusted effect sizes of the individual studies. As such, meta-analytic regressions test the significance and the effect strength of multiple moderating effects simultaneously (Brinckmann et al., 2011; Rosenbusch et al., 2011). In our analyses, we predict the effect size for the relationship between VC investments and firm performance. We look at the type of performance measure, an industry control dummy variable, average firm age in a study (both as a linear and a squared term), a dummy variable indicating whether the study refers to IPOs, and the uncertainty avoidance level of the country of study location as independent variables. Furthermore, we control for publication bias by using a dummy variable that assesses whether a study was published. We also control for subjective performance measures and for the type of VC measure.  \n\n## 5. Results  \n\nTables 2 and 3 present the results of the bivariate and the regression analyses. First, we tested the general effect of VC investment on firm performance. We found support for Hypothesis 1. VC investments have a positive and significant impact on firm performance at an aggregate level $\\mathbf{\\tilde{r}}{=}0.08\\$ 0. Yet, the effect is comparatively small. Furthermore, a credibility interval including zero and a portion of variance attributable to a sampling error of only $22.0\\%$ indicate that the population of samples is heterogeneous. We can observe a similar indication when looking at the $\\mathsf Q-$ and $1^{2}$ -values. The Q-value of 342.86 suggests that the null-hypothesis of homogeneity in the population of studies is to be rejected. Similarly, a value of $78.13\\%$ for the $1^{2}$ -statistics indicates heterogeneity in the population of studies. All of these results point to third variables moderating the VC-performance link。  \n\nTable 2 Bivariate results.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>k</td><td>N</td><td></td><td>95%confidenceinterval</td><td>80%credibilityinterval</td><td>VSE</td><td>Q</td><td>12</td><td>Z</td></tr><tr><td>H1:Overallrelationship</td><td>76</td><td>36,567</td><td>0.0769</td><td>0.0553:0.0985</td><td>-0.0319:0.1857</td><td>22.22%</td><td>342.86</td><td>78.13%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>H2:Industry control</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>30.60***</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>No Industry control</td><td>33</td><td>24,823</td><td>0.0969</td><td>0.0708:0.1229</td><td>0.0107:0.1830</td><td>22.42%</td><td>147.62***</td><td>78.32%</td><td>2.7803 ***</td></tr><tr><td>Industry control</td><td>43</td><td>11,744</td><td>0.0347</td><td>-0.0005:0.0699</td><td>-0.0950:0.1644</td><td>26.37%</td><td>164.64***</td><td>74.49%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>H3a-b:Performance measure</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>16.26**</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Returns</td><td>17</td><td>2124</td><td>-0.0297</td><td>-0.0998:0.0403</td><td>-0.1795:0.1201</td><td>37.09%</td><td>45.99***</td><td>65.21%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Growth</td><td>14</td><td>3263</td><td>0.0756</td><td>0.0316:0.1195</td><td>0.0079:0.1432</td><td>60.45%</td><td>23.16**</td><td>43.86%</td><td>2.4951**</td></tr><tr><td>Market-based</td><td>49</td><td>32,185</td><td>0.0807</td><td>0.0558:0.1055</td><td>-0.0215:0.1829</td><td>19.13%</td><td>257.46***</td><td>81.36%</td><td>2.9113***</td></tr><tr><td>H4:Age</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>72.00***</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>New ventures</td><td>27</td><td>6277</td><td>0.0361</td><td>-0.0108:0.0830</td><td>-0.0993:0.1715</td><td>27.85%</td><td>99.64***</td><td>73.91%</td><td>-1.6856*</td></tr><tr><td>Growthstagefirms</td><td>22</td><td>8577</td><td>0.0990</td><td>0.0429:0.1550</td><td>-0.0605:0.2584</td><td>14.01%</td><td>155.24***</td><td>86.47%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mature firms</td><td>10</td><td>6194</td><td>0.0445</td><td>0.0129:0.0760</td><td>0.0043:0.0847</td><td>62.08%</td><td>15.98*</td><td>43.67%</td><td>-1.6598*</td></tr><tr><td>H5:IPOvs.earlier stages</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>8.94***</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>IPO firms</td><td>59</td><td>34,272</td><td>0.0746</td><td>0.0511:0.0982</td><td>-0.0311:0.1804</td><td>20.03%</td><td>295.12***</td><td>80.35%</td><td>0.0308</td></tr><tr><td>Earlier stage firms</td><td>17</td><td>3252</td><td>0.0737</td><td>0.0222:0.1252</td><td>-0.0299:0.1773</td><td>44.30%</td><td>38.80***</td><td>58.77%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>H6:Uncertainty avoidance</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>9.32***</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>High</td><td>16</td><td>2555</td><td>0.0722</td><td>0.0321:0.1123</td><td>-0.0010:0.1454</td><td>65.65%</td><td>24.33*</td><td>38.36%</td><td>-0.3582</td></tr><tr><td>Low</td><td>59</td><td>31,218</td><td>0.0821</td><td>0.0609:0.1033</td><td>-0.0319:0.1961</td><td>19.09%</td><td>309.21***</td><td>81.24%</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: First Q reported for each moderator represents the Q between groups.

To be more precise, the positive overall effect vanishes when studies incorporate industry control measures as the effect size among studies that control for industry effects is not significant. Taken together, the finding indicates that VCs choose the more promising industries, but are not able to consistently increase the funded firms' performance across all performance dimensions within an industry.  \n\nTurning to differences in the performance measures, the bivariate analyses and the meta-regression do support Hypotheses 3a and 3b. Whereas VC investments have a small, positive impact on growth $(\\Gamma=0.07$ ) and stock market performance $(\\Gamma=0.08\\$ they do not influence the profitability of the funded firms $\\mathrm{\\Delta}\\Gamma=-0.03\\$ . In many cases, VC investments are even associated with lower profitability (e.g., Jain et al., 2008; Wong and Wong, 2008). Although the confidence intervals of the sub-groups' \"profitability-based studies\" and “growth-oriented studies\" slightly overlap, the other results (z value and increase in variance attributable to sampling error) indicate that the type of performance has a moderating influence on the strengths of the VC investment-performance relationship. The results of the meta-analytic regression further support this finding.  \n\nMoreover,in additional post-hoc analyses we re-calculated the bivariate analyses of the different performance dimensions only with the studies that control for industry selection effects to determine whether additional intra-industry effects exist with respect to the different performance dimensions. We find that the effect of VC investment on growth remains significant $\\mathbf{\\tilde{r}}{=}0.09$ O,while the effect on stock-market performance turns non-significant $\\mathbf{\\tilde{r}}{=}0.03$ ), and the effect on profitability is negative $(\\Gamma=-0.09$  \n\nIn addition, we tested the effects of firm age, IPO vs. non-IPO firms and uncertainty avoidance on the effect size. According to bivariate and multivariate analyses, firm age has the hypothesized curvilinear relationship with the VC-performance link. The influence on the VC investment-performance relationship, i.e. the relationship between VC and funded-firm performance is strongest in growth stage firms $\\mathrm{\\Delta}_{\\mathrm{{I}}}=0.10$ ),ascomparedtonewventures $\\mathbf{\\tilde{r}}{=}0.04$ and to established firms $\\mathbf{\\tilde{r}}{=}0.04$ ).Themetaregression also supports Hypothesis 4 which proposes an inverted U-shaped effect as indicated by the negative coefficient for the squared term of firm age, which is significant.  \n\nAlthough we do not find a significant difference between the effect sizes for post-IPO studies in comparison to pre-IPO studies, the multivariate regression analysis which simultaneously tests age effects and IPo effects indicates a significant difference between pre-IPO performance and post-IPO performance effects. Empirical studies investigating post-IPO effects report lower effect sizes than the pre-IPO studies lending support for hypothesis 5.  \n\nFurthermore, the bivariate analysis indicates that firms in cultures with high uncertainty avoidance benefit significantly less from venturecapital $(\\Gamma=0.00)\\$ )than firms in cultures with low uncertainty avoidance $'\\Gamma=0.08$ ). Yet, the coefficient for uncertainty avoidance is not significant when we control for additional moderators in the meta-regressions. Hence, we have to reject Hypothesis 6.  \n\nOur control variables further indicate that the event of VC investment has a stronger impact on firm performance $\\mathbf{\\tilde{r}}{=}0.08$ than continuous measures of VC investment $'\\Gamma=0.01$ ). This finding is, however not supported by the meta-analytic regression. Furthermore, we do not find evidence of a publication bias overestimating the strength of the relationship. In fact, unpublished work shows higher effect sizes $\\mathbf{\\tilde{f}}=0.13$ )than published articles $\\mathbf{\\tilde{r}}{=}0.07\\$ ). Although, the confidence intervals of the two respective sub-groups overlap slightly, the z value and the results of the meta-regressions demonstrate that publication has a significantly negative impact on the effect size.  \n\n## 6. Discussion  \n\nThis study was motivated by three questions: whether, how, and especially under which circumstances VC investment benefits the funded firms. Prior research presented conflicting theoretical arguments as to how firm performance is affected by VC funding. Moreover, empirical findings were fragmented and inconclusive. Furthermore, the high variance in previous empirical findings pointed to the existence of contextual moderators. We built on prior theorizing about selection and post-investment value added effects and systematically structured our analysis according to the selection and value-added hypotheses (Brander et al., 2002; Dimov and Shepherd, 2005; Dimov et al, 2007; Lerner, 1994). Following an evidence-based research approach, we empirically synthesized research results based on 76 independent samples.  \n\nOur results show that overall vC has a positive, yet, weak effect on the funded firm's performance. However, the overall performance effect disappears if researchers control for industry selection effects. Moreover, another part of the variance in empirical results can be attributed to contextual factors including the type of performance studied, the age of the firm, and whether it is a publicly-traded or private firm. Uncertainty avoidance, however, does not moderate the relationship between VC and funded firm performance. Our findings have important theoretical and practical implications and suggest various promising avenuesforfurtherresearch.  \n\n### 6.1. Theoretical implications  \n\nTheoretical debates regarding performance effects of vC investments center on how VC investments influence funded firm performance. A prominent stream of literature proposes that VCs have comparative advantages in comparison to other financial intermediaries when operating in environments of missing or asymmetrical information (Amit et al., 1998). Further research points to two important effects that could explain a positive performance impact of VC investments on funded firms: selection and post-investment value added effects (Brander et al., 2002; Dimov and Shepherd, 2005; Dimov et al., 2007; Lerner, 1994). The empirical evidence from this study suggests that selection or more specifically, inter-industry selection, seems to play an important role for positive performance effects of VC investments. The relationship between VC and funded firm performance is significantly stronger if researchers did not control for industry. This indicates that VCs are indeed able to identify and invest in the more promising industries. Readily available information about the structure, status, and dynamics of industries appears to enable VCs to select the more promising industries. Hence, when comparing VC funded vs. non-funded firm performance across industries a positive performance effect of VC funded firms' results.  \n\nStrikingly, however, if researchers isolate the effect that VCs have on funded firms within an industry the comparative performance advantages of VC funded firms vanishes. This finding indicates that proposed advantages associated with VC investments might be partially offset by disadvantages. For example, in environments of missing or asymmetrical information, high risk and uncertainty, VCs might not be able to systematically identify the most promising firms within an industry (Amit et al., 1998). The inherent uncertainty of the entrepreneurial context might make predictions regarding who the winners within an industry dificult. Moreover, an adverse selection might cause that generally more subpar firms are willing to present themselves and take on VC investments. Taken together, our results raise doubts whether there is - on average - a positive intra-industry selectioneffect.  \n\nMoreover, the post-investment performance benefits including the actual provision of financial resources, managerial support, and monitoring may be offset by disadvantages. For instance, the financial resources provided by the VCs may create a false sense of security and reduce the need to focus on close customer interaction and fast positive cash-flow generation. Also, dependencies and strategic rigidities that are attached to financial resources provided by the VCs might particularly confine the emergent organization's ability to flexibly change strategic directions. In addition, the funded firms might also need to absorb the substantial transaction-costs given the high degrees of risk and uncertainty which would lower their resulting performance. Further, the search for VC investments requires substantial managerial time and attention that, depending on the stage of the venture, might be spent more efficiently on alternative activities.  \n\nThe non-significant overall intra-industry effect is accompanied by strong indications of heterogeneity of the aggregated performance effects. Hence, we can assume that selection and post-investment effects unfold their benefits only on specific performance dimensions and under specific circumstances. Whereas the overall analysis combines all performance dimensions which leads overall to a non-significant relationship between VC investments and firm performance, the subsequent moderator analyses reveal a more differentiated picture. VC investments mainly lead to growth and higher valuations while profitability is unaffected. This finding supports our propositions that VCs strategically position their funded ventures to pursue growth paths while profitability increases are of a lesser concern or might not be achievable at the same time.  \n\nAn important contingent effect relates to the age of the funded firms. Our findings suggest there might be a trade-off between decreasing uncertainty and, thus, higher likelihood of positive selection and a decreasing return for financial resources and valueadded activities provided by VCs as ventures mature. Hence, we find indications for an optimal age or age range which we would term the “sweet-spot\" of VC investments when these investments especially benefit the funded firms. More specifically, the inverted u-shaped relationship suggests that there is an optimal level of informational detail. If VCs invest very early, the lack of information might be excessive and lead to the VC's inability to successfully select. However, if they invest in very established firms, information is generally abundant and hence their specialized capabilities and relative advantage to operate in environments of risk and uncertainty lose value. Supporting this line of argument, we observe that the IPO event significantly alters the performance implications for the funded firms in addition to the age effects. Due to the disclosure requirements related to the IPO and as a public company, more information becomes available and information asymmetries decrease. The resulting decreasing uncertainty, in consequence, does limit VCs to provide unique value for their funded firms. Hence, our findings provide further support to scholars' theorizing that VCs have special capabilities to provide value in contexts of lacking and asymmetric information. It also suggests that the performance effects for the funded firms might depend on the availability of alternative financial resources. If access to substantial financial capital is available through other means such as the public markets, the value that VCs can provide likely diminishes.  \n\nOverall, our findings suggest the need for a more contextual understanding of the VC investment-funded firm performance phenomenon in general and the selection and post investment benefits in particular especially taking into account the uncertainty of a venture. The variance of the effect sizes further cautions researchers to be sensitive to consider a comprehensive set of positive and negative outcomes of VC investments. Furthermore, researchers should take industry-selection effects into account when designing empirical studies and when drawing implications from their results. If scholars are interested and theorize about intra-industry effects of VC investment, but do not control for industry selection effects findings are likely biased. Moreover, research needs to focus on those dependent variables that are primary objectives of vC investments such as the evaluation of the funded firms and related growth metrics and take into consideration how the context impacts the availability of information and the resulting uncertainty.  \n\nWhile our results caution to critically reflect on the far-spread assumption about the overall positive effects of VC investments, we also acknowledge that the value provided by the different VCs likely varies to a great extent (e.g., Fitza et al., 2009; Guler, 2007; Scherer et al., 2000). In consequence,first tier VCs might be more proficient in selecting the more promising ventures, providing more and more valuable resources, and bestowing the funded firms with more positive signaling effects than lower tier VCs.  \n\n### 6.2. Managerial implications  \n\nTaken together, findings presented in our study challenge the assumption that VCs systematically select the most promising ventures and add value to funded firms across different contexts. Much of the positive performance effects are due to industry selection effects. If an entrepreneur, however, has already selected an industry to operate in, these positive selection does not appear to substantiate. This suggests that entrepreneurs need to carefully consider the value a specific VC can provide for them. However, our findings also show that VC investments can be value-creating especially with regard to firm growth while their contribution to simultaneous profit improvements can be very limited or even negative. Hence, entrepreneurs should reflect on their personal priorities with regard to growth and profitability before they consider a VC investment.  \n\nWe further found that VC investments provide most value when firms are between 6 and 12 years old and when they are not yet publicly-traded. Thus, timing of the first investment and optimal duration of the investment seem to be important considerations in order to maximize the VC impact for the funded firm. At the same time, entrepreneurs should consider that in other stages VCs overall might impact the performance substantially less.  \n\n### 6.3. Limitations  \n\nDifferent limitations need to be acknowledged. First, we would like to highlight that to date no commonly accepted definition of VC exists. Prominent literature, however, argues that VCs are unique and differ from adjacent financial intermediary types such as business angels and LBO firms. In order to get a specific understanding of how VCs affect funded-firm performance, we aimed at excluding studies that included angel investments or LBO firms based on different study screening methods described in the Method section. However, a risk remains that authors of the primary studies included in this meta-analysis did not mention that these alternative financing forms are part of their samples.  \n\nSecond, a common shortcoming of meta-analyses is the publication bias (Rosenthal, 1979). While we identified a significant number of unpublished studies, overall access to unpublished studies is limited. However, we assume that a normative bias of editors to publish only significant findings or findings that highlight specific effects is limited, because the performance effects of VC financing have always been controversially discussed. This suggests that a normative publication bias is unlikely. The comparison of published vs. unpublished studies further reveals that the unpublished studies present stronger effect sizes than the published studies. This contradicts a publication bias which is generally considered an upward bias.  \n\nThird, our results could suffer from a survival bias. VC-financed firms are generally pursuing strategies that promise greater returns, yet imply also greater chances of failure. Since the primary studies frequently do not account for differences in failure rates between VC-backed and non-VC-backed firms, the underlying studies may be biased, resulting in a potential survival bias of our aggregated findings. However, survival bias could have two opposing effects. On the one hand, firms that do not obtain VC funding might go bankrupt more often. On the other hand, the VC financed firms might aim for higher growth which could increase the risk of failure. Hence, it remains uncertain how a survival bias might affect the findings. This problem should be more frequently accounted for in the primary research. As researchers incorporate survival in their models of VC-performance effects, it allows future meta-analyses of survival effects.  \n\nFourth, our research highlights that industry selection effects impact the VC investment-performance relationship. In a similar manner, other selection effects might exist that determine which firm acquires VC funding. These non-observed VC selection effects or the endogeneity of the choice of entrepreneurs to opt for VC funding could also bias our findings (Hamilton and Nickerson, 2003). However, primary studies generally do not account for these more advanced modeling techniques. Such selfselection effects could be addressed if the primary studies would use random control experiments. Yet, given the VC context, such research design has not been used. Hence, in order to contextualize our findings, future primary research should aim at analyze both positive and negative self-selection effects of firms aiming for VC.  \n\n### 6.4. Outlook  \n\nThis is the first meta-analysis analyzing the impact of VC-investment on the funded firms. The synthesis of previous literature illustrates frequent research frameworks and less scrutinized relationships. Hence, research gaps can be identified. In addition, our findings suggest opportunities for future research. We would like to highlight a few salient research opportunities. First, although this meta-analysis presented some indications regarding the value that VCs provide for their funded firm and under which circumstances these benefits unfold, further research is needed to improve our understanding of selection and post investment performance effects. The limited overall effect as well as the variance in the underlying effect sizes of the VC and funded firm performance relationship indicates that both positive and negative selection and post-investment factors are present. Further, these negative and positive effects may only unfold under specific circumstances.  \n\nHence, future research should aim at uncovering positive and negative effects for each of the two hypotheses (selection effects and post-investment performance effects), take the additional forms of a firms financing into account, and especially consider and report specific context factors such as stage of the VC investment and especially the quality of the VCs. In this regard, research frameworks that more thoroughly investigate the reputation of the different VCs, while simultaneously capturing the value of specific resources provided by VCs could advance current research. Although research on VCs reputation and their impact on funded firm performance exists (e.g., Brau et al., 2004; Campbell li and Frye, 2006; Nahata, 2008) the mechanisms behind these performance effects as well as their specific value remain unclear. For example, out of 10 studies in this analysis which look at different measures that could be somewhat related to the quality of the VCs, 7 find insignificant or mixed results. Moreover, we identified only four studies that specifically addressed the quality of the VC by having respondents rate the quality of the VC's activities. These studies obtain a non-significant average effect size of $\\Gamma=0.016$ that is comparable to the overall effect when controlled for industry. Yet, we understand these initial findings as only suggestive and believe that more research needs to be directed as this aspect aiming for a more rigorous empirical measurement regarding the VC's quality and the resources they provide as well as an incorporation of longitudinal research designs to address causality concerns. A recent study by Krishnan et al. (2011) provides a step in this direction by separating selection and value-added effects and linking them to VCs reputation. Yet, this study looks at post-IPO performance effects and, thus, misses out on important stages of VC funding prior to an IPO.  \n\nMoreover, the success of VC investments may depend on the expertise and the size of the VCs. Previous research has pointed out that the type of VC may influence strategy-making and the success of funded firms. For example, Makela and Maula (2005) argue that cross-border VC funding influences internationalization processes of funded firms. Furthermore, VCs affliated to banks or governments may have a different impact on the performance of funded firms than independent venture capitalists (e.g.,. Hamao et al., 2000; Tykvova and Walz, 2007). However, empirical research on these issues has been scarce. Another important perspective is that the individual partners of a VC might vary substantially in quality and resources they can provide. Hence, studies could focus more on the individual level to understand which individual factors of the VC partners affect the funded firm performance. In sum, more research on the characteristics of VCs and their moderating influence on the VC-performance link is needed, which in consequence would enable evidence-based researchers to address respective questions.  \n\nAnother important contingency that could not be addressed in the present study is the expertise of the funded firm's top management team. For instance, the ability of the entrepreneurs to collaborate with the VCs and to deploy capital effectively and efficiently appears to be another important yet under-researched contextual factor that impacts the VC investment performance relationship.  \n\nExtant VC research predominantly focuses on IPO events. Out of the 76 independent samples integrated in this meta-analysis 59 focused on firms that had an IPO. This leads to a shortage of studies which scrutinize the impact of VCs on smaller and newer firms. Hence, more research about firms that are in the early stage of their life cycle and are of smaller size is warranted to complement the existing empirical work. This gap in research presents a special opportunity for entrepreneurship researchers. Research on IPO performance is dominated by finance scholars whose main interest is the explanation of stock-market performance differentials at and post-IPo. Because entrepreneurship as a field of research emphasizes the discovery and exploitation of opportunities (Shane and Venkataraman, 2001) and entrepreneurship scholars have an expertise in investigating dynamics of new ventures, entrepreneurship research is well-positioned to address the gap of research regarding early-stage VC investments. In this regard, we especially believe in the potential for entrepreneurship scholars to include non-financial aspects such as cognition of the VCs or entrepreneurs, strategy constructs, or team configuration variables in the analyses.  \n\nIn our call for further non-IPO or post IPO studies we also would like to address the value of replication studies. We are concerned that in entrepreneurship and management science scholars predominantly strive for novel research frameworks at the expense of repetition studies while in other disciplines such as medicine or education science replication and empirical synthesis are a common practice. We believe that future research would benefit if researchers would more regularly report findings regarding study elements that previous research addressed even if and especially if respective findings are non-significant.  \n\nFurther, we call for a more extensive description of the sampled VCs. Our provided overview of the studies underlines this shortcoming in extant research. Only one study distinguishes between funding stages when reporting bivariate statistics (Alemany and Marti, 2005). Two more studies explicitly include only start-ups (Engel and Keilbach, 2007; Stubner et al., 2007) while another study documents the focus on pre-IPO investments in growth stages (Wang et al., 2003). We believe that a more detailed description of the sampled funded firms and the characteristics of the VCs helps scholars contextualize the findings and can help in identifying more specific effects.  \n\nUnderstanding the mechanisms via which VC investors add value to early-stage ventures still remains an under-researched, but important topic in the VC literature. Gaining further knowledge about these mechanisms and the contingencies under which they unfold their benefits would advance this stream of research. Because it is difficult to capture the performance effects of VC investments on early-stage ventures for instance due to the multi-dimensional nature of firm performance (Combs et al., 2005), researchers should use multiple measures including perceptual and objective indicators of firm performance and also consider that the importance of the performance dimensions for entrepreneurs and their investors might change as the firm develops and establishes itself in the marketplace.  \n\nOverall, this study aimed at highlighting the need for a more contextual understanding of VC investment-performance. Specific variables relating to the funded firm, the funding VC and the funding context need to be taken into consideration when determining whether a VC investment is beneficial for the funded firm. While we see substantial progress VC research made in the last decades, we hope that our study serves as a point for reflection. We further hope that the suggested avenues for future research inspire scholars to identify specific mechanisms how more generally financial management can contribute to create value for entrepreneurial firms given the different investment contexts.  \n\n## Acknowledgements  \n\nWe would like to thank Simon Parker, Dean Shepherd and three anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on earlier versions of the paper and Rebecca Ames for editorial suggestions.  \n\n## References  \n\nAldrich, H.E., 1979.

An important way VCs add value beyond the money they provide is through their close relationships with the managers of their portfolio companies. Whereas some VCs take a very hands-off approach to oversight, others become deeply involved in the development of their portfoliocompanies.  \n\nUtilizing surveys of VCs in the United States and the three largest markets in Europe (the UnitedKingdom,theNetherlands,andFrance),weexaminedthedeterminantsofinteractionbetween VCs and CEOs, the roles VCs assume, and VCs' perceptions of how much value they add through these roles.We examined the strategic,interpersonal,and networking roles through which VCs are involved in their portfolio companies, and we analyzed how successful such efforts were. By so doing we were able to shed light on how and when VCs in four major markets expend their greatest effort to provide oversight andvalue-added assistance to their investment companies.  \n\nConsistentwith prior empiricalwork,wefound thatVCs sawstrategicinvolvement as their most important role, i.e., providing financial and business advice and functioning as a sounding board.They rated their interpersonal roles(as mentor and confidant toCEOs) as next invalue.  \n\nFinally,they rated their networking roles (i.e., as contacts to other firms and professionals) as third most important. These ratings were consistent across all four markets. VCs in the United States and theUnitedKingdom werethemost involved in theirventures,and they added the mostvalue. VCs in France were the least involved and added the least value; VCs in France appeared to be least like others in terms of what factors drove their efforts. Our theoretical models explained a greater proportion of variance in governance and value added in the United States than elsewhere. Clear patterns of behavior emerged that reflect the manner in which different markets operate. Among the European markets, practices in the United Kingdom appear to be most like that in the UnitedStates.  \n\n## Determinants of Governance (Face-to-Face Interaction)  \n\nWe operationalized VC governance or monitoring of ventures as the amount of face-to-face interaction VCs had with venture CEOs. We found some evidence that VCs increase monitoring in response to agency risks, but the results were mixed. Lack of experience on the part of CEOs did not prompt significant additional monitoring as had been predicted. A more potent determinant was how long the VC-CEO pairs worked together; longer relationships mitigated agency concerns and reduced monitoring.Contrary toexpectations. perceived business risk inthe formof VCs'satisfaction with recent venture performance had litle impact on face-to-face interaction.Monitoring was greatest in early stage ventures,indicating that VCs respond to highuncertainty by increased information exchange with CEOs. We measured two types of VC experience and found different patternsforthetwo.Generally speaking.VCs with greaterexperiencein thevenure capitalindustry required less interaction with CEOs, whereas VCs with greater experience in the portfolio company's industry interacted more frequently with CEOs than did VCs without such experience.  \n\n## Determinants of Value Added  \n\nWe argued that VCs would most add value to ventures when the venture lacked resources or faced perceived business risks, when the task environment was highly uncertain, and when VCs had great investing and operating experience.Contrary to expectations,VCs added most value to those ventures already performing well.As we had predicted, VCs did add relatively more value when uncertainty was high: e.g.. for ventures in the earliest stages and forventures pursuing innovation strategies. Finally, we found that VCs with operating experience in the venture's focal industry added significantly more value than those with less industry-specific experience. These results are consistent with anecdotalevidence that entrepreneurs havea strong preference for VCs with similar backgrounds as their own. We found no evidence that experience in the venture capital industry contributed significantly to value added.Together, these results suggest that investigations of the social as well as economic dimensions of venture building may prove a fruitful avenue for future study. Overall the results showed that value-added isstrongly related to theamount offace-to-face interaction between VC-CEO pairs and to the number of hours VCs put in on each individual venture.  \n\n## Implications for Venture Capitalists  \n\nThe competition for attractive investments is heating up as economies becoine more globalized. Thus,thepressure onventure capitalfrms to operate both efficiently and effectively is also likely to build.It is as yet unclear whetherthe recent trend toward later stage, safer investments will continue, and how those venture capital firms following this path can differentiate thermselves from other sources of capital.Venture capital firms that are able to choose the appropriate bases for determininggovernanceeffort and theappropriate rolesfordeliveringaddedvalue totheirporfolio companies will be those most likely to survive.  \n\nIn the largest, most robust markets (ie., the United States and the United Kingdom), more effort is expended by venture capitalists to deliver something of value beyond the money.This sug geststhatthetradeoffpreferredbythosesucceedingistobemoreratherthanlessinvolvedintheir investments.Ourresultsindicate thatVCsclearly economizeon thetime they devotetoinvolvement in theirportfoliocompanies.However,our results also indicate that they dothis at thegreat peril ofproducingvalueinsufficienttojustifythecostof theirproduct.  \n\n## Implications for Entrepreneurs  \n\nOurfindings provide two important insights forentrepreneurs.First,they show that where and when theyobtainventurecapitalis likely to have animpact on theextent and natureofeffortdeliveredby theirventure capital investors.

Some researchers have speculated that venture capital markets in Europe have evolved in a pattern similar to that in the United States but have also noted structural differences between U.S. and European venture capital even from the outset (Ooghe et al. 1991: Sapienza. Amason, and Manigart 1994). Of considerable practical importance to venture capitalists (VCs). entrepreneurs, and policy-makers is whether the differences in these markets translate into systematic differences in VCs' efforts to govern their portfolio companies or in their efforts to add value beyond the money they provide. This study therefore was designed to examine the drivers of venture capitalist governance and value added in the United States and in the three largest markets for venture capital in Europe (the United Kingdom, France, and theNetherlands).  \n\nThis study should hold practical value for several reasons. First, knowledge of VCs' practices are of interest to entrepreneurs attempting to select the appropriate source of funding. The choice will involve both the type of funding to seek and where and when to seek venture capital funding. Advancements in communication technology and the internationalization of markets appear to make cross-border choices more feasible than ever. For venture capital firms (VCFs), knowledge of others\\* practices could prove useful in selecting their domain, planning their portfolio. choosing which competencies to develop. and seting operating policies. Finally. policy-makers could learn from the practices used in various markets how they might enhance VCFs? efforts to fuel the engines of economic growth and success.  \n\nIn a recent article, Amar Bhide (1994. p. 139) claimed that \"entrepreneurial, privately held companies have taken over as the engines of innovation and job growth.\" Bhide's view is that the ascension of the entrepreneurial firm in the United States is at least partially the result of public policies that prevent the development of close relationships between outside investors in large. public firms and the firms' inside management. In contrast. private. entreprencurial ventures may establish personal relationships with investors such as VCs who \"try to increase companies\\* value through counseling and oversight\" (p. 138). Indeed, empirical evidence shows that VCs are much more involved in their investments than outside owners in public corporations (Rosenstein 1988). However. evidence also shows that VCs' involvement varies from near passivity to deep involvement (Gorman and Sahlman 1989: MacMillan, Kulow, and Khoylian 1989), and some controversy still exists as to how or even whether VC involvement adds value to new ventures (Rosenstein et al. 1993: Sapienza 1992).  \n\nStudies of VC activity show that VCs are often actively and personally involved in their portfolio companies (Bygrave and Timmons 1992: Fried and Hisrich 1995: Rosenstein 1988). Their involvement includes activities to monitor and provide assistance' to venture management (Gorman and Sahlman 1989; MacMillan et al. 1989). However. whereas such personal contact may afford the opportunity to reduce risks or add value. greater governance may not always be cost effective. Barney et al. (1989. p. 64) point out that VCFs must balance the costs of governance against the benefits. Similarly. Gorman and Sahlman (1989. p. 241) observe that VCs seek to maximize the return on the time they put into ventures. These studies recognize the tradeoffs that VCs make. but neither one explicitly examines how they determine the appropriate level of personal involvement. MacMillan et al. (1989. p. 37) observe that \"a relevant issue in need of examination is the opportunity cost of [greater] involvemcnt.\"  \n\nBecause the value of investors personal involvement in investments may vary with circumstances. we designed this study to examine the conditions under which VCs become more involved in their portfolio companies and those under which they believe their involvement is of greatest value to these companies. Recent works in the field have applied economic and organizational theories to model variations in VCF governance (Barney et al. 1989: Sapienza and Gupta 1994). We argue here that to understand VCs choices regarding the amount of effort to expend interacting with CEOs it is important to consider the impact of the delegation of authority to the CEO (an agency issue). expectations regarding returns on investment (a business risk issue). uncertainty regarding the decision-making capacity of the VC-CEO pair (an information-processing issue). and the experience level of the VCs themselves. We also examine how and when VCs add value to their portfolio companies. Because no theory of venture capitalist value added exists. we developed a framework that posits that value added is greatest when ventures are struggling, when uncertainty is great. and when VCs have experience pertinent to the ventures.  \n\nThis research represents the broadest comparative study of this nature to date. The use of four markets provides descriptive information of practical value to entrepreneurs. VCFs, and policy-makers and provides insights into the generalizability of the theories forming the framework of the study. A portion of the data we utilize have been reported in prior studies (Sapienza 1992: Sapienza et al. 1994: Sapienza and Timmons 1989), but this study also provides new data and analyses. Differences and overlap between this and past studies are elaborated in the Method section.  \n\n# THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK  \n\nSince Berle and Means's (1932) seminal work. considerable research in both organizational and financial economics has addressed the question of the ability of a firm's owners to monitor and infiuencc the actions of its senior executives (Eisenhardt 1989; Oviatt 1988; Walsh and Seward 1990). Although most of these studies have been conducted in the context of large publicly held firms. Eisenhardt ( 1989) has suggested that these theories could be productively applied also to the governance of smaller, newer firms where there is less dispersion of ownership, where the inherent level of outcome and uncertainty is greater, and where there is a weak market for external control. Thus, closely held firms in developmental stages. cspecially those that have not yet cntered the public market, offer a potentially fruitful arena in which to examine agency and organization theory perspectives on governance and decision-making.  \n\n## Research on Venture Capitalist Involvement in Portfolio Companies  \n\nStudies of VC activity and value added have tended to be descriptive and somewhat atheoretical. Two key studies are those of Gorman and Sahlman (1989) and MacMillan et al. (1989). Gorman and Sahlman found that senior partners in VCFs spend $60\\%$ Or more of their time in postinvestment activities and contribute to ventures via financing, strategic and operational planning, management recruiting. and providing a network of contacts. MacMillan et al. (1989) built on Gorman and Sahlman by examining a more elaborate list of 20 activities. Both studies found that VCs rate their strategic activities as the most important. In the MacMillan study. the role of \"sounding board\" was rated highest: the authors speculated that this might include acting as confidant or mentor, but following Gorman and Sahlman, they did not ask VCs to rate such roles. Gorman and Sahlman found VCs most active in early stage ventures. but MacMillan et al. observed no correlation between activity and context and concluded that VC involvement is primarily a matter of personal preference or inclination.  \n\nVCs in the MacMillan et al. study were generally quite satisfied with their involvement in their portfolio companies. However, whether or not VCs actually add value through involvement remains controversial (Sapienza 1992). For example. MacMillan et al. observed both positive and negative associations between involvement and venture performance: Rosenstein et al. (1993) found that entrepreneurial CEOs rate VCs no more valuable than other outside investors. unless one of the \"top 20\" VCFs is represented on the board of directors.  \n\nThe few studies of European VC activity parallel the U.S. studies but also provide insight into the social roles VCs play. Using the MacMillan et al. (1989) framework, Harrison and Mason (1992) found that entrepreneurs in the United Kingdom rate sounding board and strategic activities as most important and that they depend more on the assistance of VCs than they do on other types of investors. A British Venture Capital Association survey (1992) found that prior to investment, entrepreneurs express a preference for passive financial assistance only, but postinvestment,they rate active, nonfinancial assistance as providing the highest value added. In the Netherlands, Van Wakeren. Van der Werf. Vonk. and Schuit (1989) found that about $60\\%$ of entrepreneurs receive important strategic assistance from VCs.and about $20\\%$ receive useful networking assistance. Studies in Nordic markets reveal the following: (1) in Finland, the activities of financing and active oversight are rated most important (Ahdekivi 1990): (2) in Sweden, one survey found entrepreneurs rate access to capital., to VC competence. to moral support, and to networks most important (Fredriksen et al. 1990): and (3) another survey in Sweden observed four styles of venture VC involvement: consultancy oriented, mentor oriented, operations oriented, and structure oriented (Landstrom 1991). The two studies in Sweden give explicit recognition to an issue raised, but not explored, in the early U.S. studies: the importance of the personal relationship between the VC and the entrepreneur.  \n\nThe importance of the relationship between the VC and the entrepreneurial CEO has also begun to receive attention in the United States. For example, Barney et al. (1994a) observed that unless the entrepreneur is receptive to VC advice, no value added can be achieved through VC involvement, and Fried and Hisrich (1995) went so far as to label the VC a \"relationship investor.\"  \n\n## Determinants of Governance through Interaction  \n\nThis new attention to VC-entrepreneur relations provides another way of viewing VC governance. The work of Barney and colleagues (1989. 1994b) shows that VCFs systematically adjust structural governance mechanisms to match agency and business risk. The first of their studies showed that the more the CEO and the managerial team have at stake in the venture and the better the venture's performance in the year of first-round financing, the less VCFs invest in structural governance mechanisms such as presence on the venture's board of directors. The second study found that if new firms experience high returns or if there are obstacles to monitoring, it is more likely that contracts will include covenants that limit venture management's discretion. But structural and contractual devices are crude mechanisms of control (Walsh and Seward 1990). A premise of this study is that VCs influence entrepreneurial behavior through their personal contact with entrepreneurial CEOs. However, because personal contact involves significant costs, we expect that VCs will consciously choose how much effort to expend depending upon their experience and their perceptions of the agency risk, business risk, and uncertainty inherent in the situation.  \n\nPersonal interactions with CEOs may serve several purposes for the VC: they allow the VC to become personally familiar with what is going on in the business. to understand how the CEO operates and thinks, to build rapport, and to influence decisions. Nonetheless. because time is a precious resource for VCs (Gorman and Sahlman 1989) and because entrepreneurs may resent excessive intrusion (Sapienza 1992), VCs will seek to limit face-to-face contact to the extent possible (Barney et al. 1989). Thus. efficiency is an underlying principle in our governance hypotheses. Given that general partners are involved on average in six or more portfolio companies (Gorman and Sahlman 1989). efficiency of oversight appears a critical issue for VCFs (Lerner 1995).  \n\n### Impact of Agency Risks on VC-CEO Interaction  \n\nWe expect that VCs will vary their personal contact with CEOs depending on the agency risk inherent in the context. We define agency risk as the risk that CEOs (agents) will take actions contrary to the wishes of their VCs (Jensen and Meckling 1976). Such risks would be higher either when CEOs have greater incentive to pursue self-serving behavior at the expense of venture outcomes (Barney et al. 1989) or when VCs lack complete faith in the judgments of the CEOs (Sapienza and Gupta 1994). Because CEOs generally hold significant equity stakes in their ventures and have great incentive to maximize venture outcomes (Sapienza and Gupta, 1994), we focus here on agency risks emanating from VC uncertainty regarding CEO judgment rather than on those associated with managerial opportunism.  \n\nAs noted by Sapienza and Gupta (1994), although VCFs expend great effort to ensure the quality of venture management before investment, the variety of demands on the CEO make it virtually impossible that any CEO or management team will be “\"perfectly\" competent in all situations. Some CEOs may have great technical experience, whereas others understand the venture building process thoroughly. VCs' continuing doubts are reflected in both Ruhnka and Young's (1987) finding that managerial competence is among the greatest of VCs' concerns and Gorman and Sahlman's finding that VCs overwhelmingly attribute venture failure to managerial incompetence: indeed, Gorman and Sahlman speculate that the nature of the venture capital process itself requires that VCs be constantly vigilant with regard to potential managerial weaknesses. Thus, a critical paradox arises: VCs must both support and question management decisions.  \n\nIn short, it appears likely that VCs will expend additional effort to interact on a faceto-face basis when they fear that a CEO's competence poses a threat to the venture's success. This reasoning is consistent with Fiet's (1995) view that, postinvestment, VCs manage agency risks through face-to-face interaction, a form of contact that provides an opportunity to gather information and to create a personal understanding of the business and its people. However. the greater VCs' confidence in CEOs' decision-making, the less their incentive to incur the costs of close, personal governance. Thus, we offer our first hypothesis:  \n\nHl: The higher the agency risks, the greater will be the face-to-face interaction between the VC and the CEO.  \n\n### Impact of Perceived Business Risk on VC-CEO Interaction  \n\nBarney et al. (1989, p. 64) define business risk for VCFs as \"the uncertainty associated with obtaining returns on an investment in a new firm due to that firm's competitive environment.\" They show that as such uncertainties increase,VCFs increase the elaborateness of their governance mechanisms to protect against adverse outcomes. Consistent with their work, we expect that VCs will also increase face-to-face governance of the CEO when business risk is high.  \n\nBecause the extent of business risk cannot be perfectly anticipated in advance, VCs will adjust their level of monitoring to fit the perceived progress of the ventures. We posit that when ventures are exceeding expectations, VCs will be less inclined to be involved. As an example, one of the VCs we interviewed said, \"When the venture is really moving, the best thing you can do is to just stay out of the way of the freight train.\" On the other hand, it seems likely that when VCs believe the ventures are doing very poorly they have a fiduciary responsibility to find out why. Whereas VCs' incentive to expend the time and effort required for face-to-face interaction with CEOs is low for ventures meeting or exceeding targets. VCs of poorly performing ventures are likely to become more involved. if only to determine whether or not venture management should be changed. Thus. we offer our second hypothesis:  \n\n$H2$ : The higher the perceived business risk faced by the venture, the greater will be the face-to-face interaction between the venture capitalist and the venture CEO.  \n\n### Impact of Uncertainty on VC-CEO Interaction  \n\nVC oversight of ventures involves not only the monitoring of CEOs' decisions but also the direct involvement of VCs in making strategic decisions (Gorman and Sahlman 1989: Lerner 1995: Rosenstein 1988). Sapienza and Gupta (1994. p. 1622) argued that the informationprocessing perspective (Galbraith 1973) could provide useful insights as to why VCs might seek more or less interaction in assisting CEOs in decision-making. The value that this perspective adds is that it provides insights as to why VCs might vary monitoring efforts even when there are no conflicts of interest among decision-makers. The information-processing theory holds that the structure of joint decision-making depends upon the level of uncertainty (i.e., the gap between the information necessary to make effective decisions and the information already possessed by the decision-makers [Galbraith 1973]). Specifically. it suggests that decision-makers will seek cost-efficient means to reduce uncertainty.  \n\nFrom an information-processing perspective, two basic alternatives exist for reducing uncertainty: decision-makers can reduce goals or they can increase their information-processing capacity. VCFs do not invest money in high risk ventures with the idea of obtaining modest but certain returns. Because VCFs seek high returns on their capital (Bygrave and Timmons 1992), it is the second of these two rationales that is apropos to most VC-CEO pairs. Thus, we expect that as the uncertainty facing ventures increases. VCs will attempt to increase ventures' information-processing capacity by stepping up their face-to-face interaction with the CEO. This expectation can be stated formally as follows:  \n\n$H3$ : The higher the uncertainty facing the venture. the greater will be the face-toface interaction between the venture capitalist and the venture CEO.  \n\n### Inpact of VC experience on VC-CEO interaction.  \n\nDirectly bearing on the issue of the amount of uncertainty facing the venture is the information-processing capacity of the VC-CEO pair responsible for many of the key decisions facing the venture. All other things being equal. we expect that the amount of information VCs bring to the table will increase directly with their experience as venture capitalists or in the venture's focal industry. Further. we also expect that greater experience will be associated with greater effciency in information processing and decision-making. Thus. for highly experienced VCs, less face-to-face interaction should be required to produce decisions of the same quality as those produced by less experienced VCs (Sapienza 1989: Williamson 1975). Given that VCs will seek to economize on the time consumed in the direct governance of ventures ( Barney et al. 1989; Fiet 1995). these arguments suggest that experienced VCs are more likely to be able to economize and still adequately perform their fiduciary responsibilities. These expectations can be formally stated as the following hypothesis:  \n\n$H4.$ The greater VCs' experience. the less frequent will be the interaction between the venture capitalist and the venture CEO.  \n\n## Determinants of Value Added  \n\nTheories of how and when VCs most add value to the ventures they fund are not well-developed. We take steps toward a theory of investor value added by developing expectations and testing them on our data set. We will rely on the information-processing perspective (Galbraith 1973) as the basis for making predictions regarding when VCs most add value to the ventures in which they invest. Our central thesis is that when CEOs lack sufficient information or information-processing capacity or when they perceive great information potential in their VCs they will seek the assistance of their VCs. Three broad conditions are expected to increase VCs' value added: (1) when venture capacities fall short of venture \"needs.\" (2) when the venture faces great uncertainties regarding what the optimal strategies are or how best to implement the chosen strategies, and (3) when the VCs themselves appear to offer a significant source of valuable information for the venture. These views are also consistent with resource dependency theory (Pfeffer and Salancik 1978): VCs will be most valued when they are able to reduce critical uncertainties for the venture (Bygrave and Timmons 1992). This greater contribution will result not only becauseVCs may help substantively in the reduction of uncertainties. but also because the CEO is likely to ask for more help in these situations and to be more receptive to the advice given by the VC (Barney et al. 1994a).  \n\n### Impact of Venture Needs on Value Added  \n\nLerner (1995. p. 301) argued recently that VCs provide the greatest assistance to new ventures \"when the need for oversight is greatlest].\" On the surface. this view may appear a near tautology. Surely, it makes great sense to argue that a venture can most benefit from outside advice when it is \"neediest.\" Won't the venture benefit most from VC involvement when the venture management team is incomplete or inexperienced or when the venture is struggling to survive? Deeper consideration of the issues, however, suggests that the converse is possible. Sapienza et al. (1994) speculated that VCs might follow \"home-run\" strategies, preferring to put greater effort and resources into ventures promising the greatest payoff. Similarly. experienced venture CEOs and management teams less in need of outside assistance may be more capable of evaluating and leveraging the input of their VCs.  \n\nIf we view the CEO-VC pair as a key decision-making unit for the venture, the information-processing perspective implies that as the venture's information-processing capacity falls below that required foreffective decisions. VCs will be motivated toincrease their input. Inexperienced CEOs are likely to have fewer contacts to critical information and to be subject to greater equivocality regarding cause and effect relations than are more experienced CEOs. The duration of the VC-CEO relationship should also have had an impact on the amount of value added during any given interval of time: the less time the venture had been in the portfolio, the less likely that the venture will have absorbed all knowledge. reputation. and network benefits offered by VCF-backing. Thus. the greatest value added probably occurs earlier on in the relationship. Finally, ventures seen to be performing poorly may attract the greatest concern of investors fearful of realizing a total loss on investment. An additional reason to expect that VCs' value will be greatest under these circumstances is that entrepreneurs may be more receptive to VCs' input when they perceive a greater need for assistance. In summary. we expect value added to be high when CEOs are less experienced, when the relationship is older. and when the venture is seen as performing poorly. These arguments lead to the following hypothesis:  \n\nH5: The greater the needs of the venture, the greater will be the value added of the VC's involvement.  \n\n### Impact of Uncertainty on Value Added  \n\nSapienza and Gupta (1994) found that the greater the uncertainties facing the venture, the greater was their face-to-face interaction. They attributed this finding both to the increased difficulty of assessing outcome causes in highly uncertain situations and to the desire on the part of both parties to improve decision-making. This interpretation is consistent with the view that a viable option for decision-makers facing great uncertainty is to increase lateral relations (Galbraith 1973). An assumption of this perspective is that decision-makers are limited in their rational capacities. The extent of limitations on individual decision-makers is a direct function of the complexity and novelty of the problems they face. When CEOs face very simple. stable conditions, the cost of interacting with outside advisors may exceed the benefits. However, we expect that as problem complexity and novelty rise, so too will the value of interacting with outside advisors. Thus, we offer the following hypothesis:  \n\nH6: The greater the uncertainty facing the venture, the greater will be the value added of the VC's involvement.  \n\n### Impact of VC Experience on Value Added  \n\nVCs' experience may be the most critical factor determining the amount of value added received through interaction. As was the case with venture need, the expected impact of VCs' experience on value added may appear obvious. Clearly, VCs who have financed and monitored hundreds of new ventures, have started some of their own, or who have years of experience in the ventures' industries are likely to have more to offer CEOs than those who have limited experience. Further. is it not likely that CEOs will be more receptive to the views of VCs with great experience? Indeed. we expect VC experience to be positively related to value added, but we also believe some caveats are in order.  \n\nImplicit in most of our arguments has been the view that greater effort on the part of VCs is associated with greater value added. However, earlier we argued that experienced VCs could satisfy their fiduciary responsibilities with less effort. Thus, the possibility exists that experienced VCs will interact less with CEOs and will therefore add less value to the ventures than inexperienced VCs. Anecdotal evidence suggests that if VCs greater experience is as a financier of new ventures (i.e., as a venture capitalist) rather than as a practitioner in the venture's industry, the danger of resentment on the part of the CEO is great (Sapienza 1989). Indeed, we heard complaints in interviews with both VCs and entrepreneurs about VCs who were \"financial MBA-types\" or who \"never started any business of their own.\"  \n\nAlthough the above dangers exist. we expect that VCs who survive to become experienced are those who are aware of these perceptions and are able to manage involvement so as to contribute value beyond the money provided. Rosenstein et al. (1993) found that VCs from the top U.S. VCFs were perceived as adding more value than other outsiders. The importance of reputation and experience are implicit in their arguments and supported by their findings. In summary, we expect that VCs with experience in the venture's industry will have a great deal to offer because of their understanding of the business, whereas VCs with a great deal of experience as venture capitalists will have much to offer because of their understanding of the venture development process. Further, though this latter group may be especially inclined to try to economize on effort, they will not do so at the expense of offering more than enough to justify the price entrepreneurs pay for their investment. Thus, our final hypothesis is as follows:  \n\nTABLE 1 Venture Capital Markets in Four Countries\"   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>U.K.</td><td>FR</td><td>NL</td><td>U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Funds raised</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>(absolute):</td><td>1249</td><td>857</td><td>91</td><td>$2.5B</td></tr><tr><td>(as a percentage of the country's gross domestic product):</td><td>0.15%</td><td>0.08%</td><td>0.04%</td><td>0.04%</td></tr><tr><td>Funds invested (absolute):</td><td>1831</td><td>968</td><td>239</td><td>$2.5B</td></tr><tr><td>(as a percentage of the country's gross domestic product):</td><td>0.23%</td><td>0.09%</td><td>0.10%</td><td>0.04%</td></tr><tr><td>Percentage of funds invested by</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VCF type</td><td>55</td><td>33</td><td>61</td><td>81 (private)</td></tr><tr><td>Independentinvestors</td><td>33</td><td>38</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Captive investors Semicaptiveinvestors</td><td>11</td><td>28</td><td>27</td><td>18 (corporate)</td></tr><tr><td>Public</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0 12</td><td>1 (SBICs)</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n\" All figures for Europe are for 1992 and come from EVCA (1993): Funds Raised and Funds Invested in Europe are in millions of ECUs.For the U.S.,Funds Raised and Funds Invested are for 1992 in billions of $\\$1$ (source.Pratt's Guide to Venture Capital Sources (1995).

Although Europe is one of the fastest growing venture capital markets in the world (Bygrave and Timmons 1992). relatively little empirical work has examined the European venture capital industry (Ooghe et al. 1991). Ooghe et al. observe that not only are the venture capital industries in the United States and Europe structurally different from one another, but that significant differences also exist among markets within Europe. For example, VCFs' sources of funds, their preferences for stage and industry sector, the fiscal climate, and even the extent of VCF market dominance may vary on a country-by-country basis. Therefore, we will briefly describe the venture capital markets in the four countries at time the data collection was done (early 1988 in the United States and mid-1992 in Europe).  \n\nReaders should keep in mind not only the difference in the time period of data collection but also differences in terminology across settings. Bygrave and Timmons (1992. p. 73) caution that definitions of venture capital vary even within countries, much less on a worldwide basis; for example, they point to the fact that what 3i (the dominant VCF in the UK) would call a \"start-up\" would not be considered one in the United States. Table 1 presents statistics on capital raised and invested in each market and the percentage of funds invested by VCF type.  \n\nWhereas the venture capital industry in the United States was larger and more developed than that of any other individual country. figures show that by 1988 Europe had caught up with and surpassed the United States in terms of funds raised and invested annually (Bygrave and Timmons 1992: Ooghe et al. 1991). The European venture capital industry reached its peak in 1989 in terms of total new funds raised for venture capital (5.8 billion ECU): this stabilized at 4.2 billion ECU in 1991 and 1992. The yearly amount invested, however. grew slowly in Europe: 4.3 billion ECU in 1989 to 4.7 billion ECU in 1992 (EVCA 1993. p. 63). The European VC industry clearly came to maturity in 1992: divestments in 1992. measured at cost. totalled 2.3 billion ECU or $17\\%$ higher than in 191. One major difference from the U.S. venture capital industry is that trade sales in Europe remain the most important means of divestment: they account for 41 % of 1992 divestments. whereas public offerings accounted for only 17% of divestments in 1992 and under 10% in 1991 (EVCA 1993, pp. 47-48). Europe lacks active IPO markets as exit routes for venture capital investments (Leleux and Manigart 1994).  \n\nIn absolute numbers, the United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands were the largest venture capital markets in Europe. Table 1 shows that the United Kingdom held a healthy lead over France, which in turn was a much larger market than the Netherlands. The venture capital industry in Europe comprised four distinct groups of organizations (EVCA 1993): (1) independent firms: (2) captive organizations, part of larger financial institutions: (3) semicaptive organizations, partially owned by larger (financial) institutions but operating independently: and (4) public firms.-In the United States. the most common way of classifying VCFs was as private firms. SBICs, and corporate subsidiaries ( Pratt's Guide to Venture Capital Sources 1988). In 1992. almost two-thirds of the investments were made by independent organizations in the Netherlands. compared with $54.7\\%$ in the United Kingdom, and only $32.3\\%$ in France. Whereas the U.S. market in 1988 was also dominated by large. private VCFs ( $81\\%$ of capital under management in 1989 was held by private VCFs. and $14\\%$ of all VCFs controlled $59\\%$ of the funds [Timmons and Sapienza 1992]), no one firm in the United States held the dominating presence that 3i did in the United Kingdom (Ooghe et al. 1991).  \n\nIn 1992, the amount of funds raised by VCFs had decreased slightly in the Netherlands and in France. but had remained relatively constant in the United Kingdom (EVCA 1993). In the United States, the $\\$4.2$ billion raised in 1987 was a high point. However. Black Monday in October of that year marked a turning point for venture capital in the United States: only $\\$2.9$ billion was raised in 1988, beginning a downward spiral that reached its nadir in 1991 at $\\$1.3$ billion before rebounding to $\\$3.8$ billion in 1994 ( Pratt's Guide to Venure Capital Sources 1995). Table 1 indicates the amount of venturc capital raised and invested in 1992 in the four markets as a percentage of each country's gross domestic product: these comparisons provide one view of the relative importance of venture capital in each country's econOmy. As may be observed, venture capital raised and invested in the United Kingdom $(0.15\\%$ and $0.23\\%$ . respectively) represents a much larger proportion of that country's economy than does venture capital elsewhere. Although representing the single largest market in absolute terms. the U.S. market for venture capital is the smallest relative to its overall economy.  \n\nThe most important sources of funds for independent VCFs in the United Kingdom and in the Netherlands were the pension funds and insurance companies. whereas institutional investors were relatively absent from the venture capital market in France. Funds raised from institutional sources in France tended to come from abroad (EVCA 1993). Moreover. in France, financial institutions and banks dominated the industry by setting up captive and semicaptive venture capital organizations. In the Netherlands. the government directly invested in venture capital; this was not the case in the United Kingdom or in France. A new phenomenon in the United Kingdom was that funds were increasingly being raised for investing in foreign markets, especially targeted for southern Europe.  \n\nTABLE 2 Venture Capital Firms and Portfolio Companies in This Study   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>U.K.</td><td>FR</td><td>NL</td><td>U.S.</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>VCF characteristics:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Number of respondents</td><td>76</td><td>43</td><td>37</td><td>65</td><td>221</td></tr><tr><td>Number of affiliates</td><td>17</td><td>26</td><td>13</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>Number of government agencies</td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>Ventureboardcharacteristics:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Number of members of the board of directors</td><td>5.36</td><td>5.81</td><td>3.25</td><td>5.71</td><td>5.16</td></tr><tr><td>Inside members</td><td>3.26</td><td>2.64</td><td>1.03</td><td>1.96</td><td>2.43</td></tr><tr><td>Venturecharacteristics:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Number of entrepreneurs with start-up exp.</td><td>26</td><td>17</td><td>12</td><td>25</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>Number of ventures by stage\"</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Early stage ventures</td><td>20</td><td>6</td><td>十</td><td>29</td><td>59</td></tr><tr><td>Late stage ventures</td><td>55</td><td>37</td><td></td><td>36</td><td>161</td></tr><tr><td>Number of ventures by sector</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturing</td><td>18</td><td>7</td><td>9</td><td>26</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>Energy/nat. resource</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>一</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Medical/health</td><td>8</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Agriculture</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Consumer products</td><td>9</td><td>7</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Computer related</td><td>15</td><td>7</td><td>1</td><td>15</td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td>Biotechnology</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>一</td></tr><tr><td>Chemicals/plastics</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>十</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Financial services</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>6</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Electronics</td><td>6</td><td>3</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Percentage of a venture's competitors withlowerlevels of innovation\"</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Technological</td><td></td><td>86</td><td>88</td><td></td><td>72</td></tr><tr><td>Marketing</td><td>73 59</td><td>63</td><td>57</td><td>56 43</td><td>53</td></tr><tr><td>Product</td><td>55</td><td>49</td><td>31</td><td>52</td><td>48</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n\"Differences hetwecn stage variables and innovation variables herc and those in Table 4 reflect the fact that cases with missingvalucs for anyvariablewere dropped in theregression analyses.

Management buyouts and buyins accounted for almost two-thirds of the amount invested in the United Kingdom; in the Netherlands and France, expansion stage financing and replacement capital was prevalent. Among the European countries of this study, only in the Netherlands was as much as $8\\%$ of investment going to very early stage companies, whereas the figure was about 28% in the United States (Timmons and Sapienza 1992): again. however, differences in terminology pose a challenge to precise comparison.  \n\nCompared with all the countries in Europe. the United Kingdom and France have the best environmental conditions (government incentives, tax structures. etc.) for venture capital, followed by the Netherlands (Tyebjee and Vickery 1988: Roure, Keeley. and Van der Heyden 1990). It is difficult to compare European fiscal policies directly with those in the United States, but some researchers have concluded that domestic VCFs in the United States are adversely impacted (in comparison with foreign entry) by fiscal policy (Timmons and Sapienza1992).  \n\nOverall, the U.K. market appears most similar with respect to size. maturity, and dominant type of VCF to that of the United States. This is not surprising given that the U.K. market developed sooner than other European markets. However, vast differences between the two exist in terms of funding preferences and governance styles. Within Europe, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom look alike with respect to the industry structure. whereas the Netherlands and France look alike with respect to investment patterns. At the time of survey administration in the United States, the market for IPOs had just experienced a setback reflected in the severe drop in venture capital funds raised. In contrast, the European venture capital industry was relatively stable at the time the survey was administered, and European VCFs tended to invest in later stage, safer ventures (Bygrave and Timmons1992).  \n\n# METHOD  \n\nThe data reported in this study were obtained in two separate collection efforts, the second a follow-up and replication of parts of the first (U.S.) study. The U.S. data were collected in 1987-1988: the procedures, sample, and methods involved in this study have been reported in detail elsewhere (Sapienza 1992: Sapienza and 1994: Sapienza and Timmons 1989). In brief. the U.S. study involved extensive interviewing of VCs and CEOs of their portfolio companies and follow-up questionnaires based on the interviews and prior empirical work. The personal interviews created a very high response rate ( $85\\%$ and $80\\%$ ,respectively) and allowed us to develop our surveys: they also provided an in-depth view of the nature of the economic and personal relationships involved. Questionnaire responses were received from VCs on 65 of their portfolio companies: matched responses were obtained from CEOs of 51 of these ventures. High correspondence between VCs and CEOs regarding the importance and value of venture capitalist involvement in the ventures as well as venture performance allowed the responses to be combined as reliable, valid measures for 51 ventures; only these 51 were used in the earlier studies. The study reported here includes all 65 responsesfromVCs.  \n\nBecause of the interrater reliability evident in the first study and because resources prevented obtaining matched responses of VC-CEO pairs in the three European countries, the follow-up study obtained survey responses from VCs only. However. this procedure allowed us to survey the entire target population. A slightly modified version of the U.S. questionnaire was prepared in English. translated into Dutch and French, and sent to all known British, French, and Dutch VCs in early 1992 (translations were retranslated into English to ensure correspondence of meaning). VCFs were identified using membership lists of national and European venture capital associations. trade journals, and Venture Economics' Guide to European Venture Capital Sources. We sent one survey to each of the VCFs identified in the three countries. Responses were 76 in the United Kingdom ( $43\\%$ response rate), 43 in France( $25\\%$ response), and 37 in the Netherlands ( $40\\%$ response), 156 in all. Analyses of the characteristics of nonresponding VCFs show no significant differences from responding VCFs; thus, the probability of nonresponse bias appears minimal.  \n\nIn the United States. personal interviews allowed us to encourage VCs to fill out surveys on two portfolio companies. preferably one doing well and one doing not so well. This procedure helped to limit possible sampling bias. In Europe, questionnaires were mailed to VCs who were asked to pick one venture only, but requirements that the VCs personally served on the boards and that the VCF's investment was at least two years old restricted their choice. The means of the performance rating in all countries was around the middle of the scale and their standard deviations were large enough to suggest that no systematic favoring of ventures by performance occurred. Table 2 presents descriptive statistics on the VCFs and portfolio companies in our sample.  \n\n## Measures for Tests of Hypotheses  \n\n### Dependent Variables  \n\nThe central concepts in this study are the governance effort expended by VCs and the roles by which they add value to their portfolio companies. As has been noted by Rosenstein (1988) and Gorman and Sahlman (1989). among others, VCs influence and help direct venture efforts through personal involvement at board meetings and other informal interactions with CEOs. Accordingly, we have measured process governance (Sapienza 1994) as the frequency of face-to-face interaction in VC-CEO pairs: ( $1=$ less than once a quarter; $2=$ once a quarter: $3=$ once a month: $4=$ twice a month; $5\\approx$ once a week; $6=$ twice a week: $7=$ every day).  \n\nTo measure value added we asked VCs to rate the importance (on a scale from $1=$ not important at all, to $5=$ of great importance) of the different roles they assumed with regard to the venture. These roles were derived from prior research (e.g., Gorman and Sahlman 1989; MacMillan et al. 1989) and our own field work. VCs also rated their effectiveness in carrying out these roles (from $1=$ not at all effective, to $10\\:=\\:$ extremely effective). By multiplying the importance by the effectiveness rating we derived a measure of value added for each role (with a possible range of $1=$ no value added to $50=$ very high value added). The overall value added then was the average score across the eight roles. Table 3 presents summary statistics on VC effort. VC-CEO interaction, individual value-added roles, and overall value added of VCs.  \n\n### Independent Variables Predicting Governance  \n\nWe used three indicators of agency risk, one of business risk, four of uncertainty. and two of VC experience to test our four hypotheses (H1-H4) regarding VC governance. As explained below. geographic distance was also used as a control variable in tests of both governance and value added. The means and standard deviations of these indicators appear in Table 4.  \n\n#### Agency Risk  \n\nAgency risk was measured by three variables: (1) the CEO's years of experience in the focal industry, (2) the CEO's previous start-up experience (coded $\\because0^{\\cdot\\cdot}$ if the CEO had no prior start-up experience, \"1\" if he/she had), and (3) the number of years the venture had been in the VCF's portfolio. We expected that VCs would perceive agency risks as high when: (1) the CEO had relatively few years' experience in the venture's industry, (2) the CEO had relatively few years\\* experience in new firms, and (3) when the venture had been in the  \n\nTABLE 3 Means and Standard Deviations of Involvement Variables\\*   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Variable</td><td colspan=\"2\">U.K.</td><td colspan=\"2\">FR</td><td colspan=\"2\">NL</td><td colspan=\"2\">U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Mean</td><td>SD</td><td>Mean</td><td>SD</td><td>Mean</td><td>SD</td><td>Mean</td><td>SD</td></tr><tr><td>Measures of involvement Face-to-face interaction</td><td>3.43</td><td>1.00</td><td>2.67</td><td>0.99</td><td>3.06</td><td>1.13</td><td>3.20)</td><td>1.05</td></tr><tr><td>VC's hours devoted 1o the ventureperyear</td><td>153.74</td><td>116.55</td><td>79.02</td><td>69.88</td><td>75.00</td><td>53.07</td><td>194.05</td><td>187.76</td></tr><tr><td>Value added in strategic roles</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Sounding board</td><td>35.74 (4.4, 8.1)</td><td>9.89</td><td>28.59 (4.2. 6.8)</td><td>11.11</td><td>34.00 (4.3, 8.0)</td><td>8.15</td><td>36.89</td><td>10.23</td></tr><tr><td>Financier</td><td>33.45 (4.2. 7.9)</td><td>12.95</td><td>35.72</td><td>10.96</td><td>33.9413.62</td><td></td><td>32.58</td><td>(4.5. 8.1) 15.50</td></tr><tr><td>Business advisor</td><td>31.50 (4.2. 7.6)</td><td>10.38</td><td>27.97</td><td>(4.4. 8.2) 9.78</td><td>(4.3. 8.0) 26.71</td><td>11.78</td><td>(3.9. 7.7) 34.40</td><td>9.20</td></tr><tr><td>Value added in interpersonal roles Mentor/coach</td><td>26.38</td><td></td><td></td><td>(4.1. 6.9)</td><td>(3.6. 7.5)</td><td></td><td>(4.4. 7.8)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Friend/confidant</td><td>(3.8. 7.0) 23.65</td><td>12.45</td><td>(3.4. 5.5)</td><td>18.3512.19</td><td>25.4110.51 (3.6.7.0)</td><td></td><td>29.71 (3.9. 7.2)</td><td>12.62</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(3.4. 6.9)</td><td>12.93</td><td>(3.0, 6.0)</td><td>18.1113.24</td><td>18.71 (3.0. 6.3)</td><td>11.85</td><td></td><td>13.67 (3.3. 6.6)</td></tr><tr><td>Value added in networking roles Source ofprofessional contacts</td><td>17.50</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(2.9. 6.1)</td><td>12.77</td><td>19.21 (3.2.6.0)</td><td>11.37</td><td>21.12 (3.1. 6.7)</td><td>10.23</td><td>20.28</td><td>11.67 (2.9. 6.1)</td></tr><tr><td>Source of industry contacts</td><td>12.63 (2.6. 4.9)</td><td>12.10</td><td>15.22</td><td>14.50</td><td>15.7611.49</td><td></td><td>13.30</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Managementrecruiter</td><td>17.49</td><td>14.71</td><td>10.50</td><td>(3.0.5.2) 12.33</td><td>(2.5. 6.3) 18.94</td><td>14.10</td><td>(2.6. 4.0) 17.47</td><td>11.45</td></tr><tr><td>Avg.value added</td><td>(2.8. 6.2) 24.79 (3.6. 6.8)</td><td>6t'9</td><td>21.17</td><td>(2.7. 3.9) 5.58</td><td>(3.1. 6.2) 24.32</td><td>5.74 (3.4. 7.2)</td><td>(2.9. 4.8) 26.41</td><td>7.58 (3.6. 7.4)</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n\" The mean importance and effectiveness ratings appear in parentheses below the mean value-added scores.

Sapienza and Gupta (1994) also used CEO experience as a proxy for perceived agency risk. Using years in the portfolio as a measure of agency risk is consistent both with Larson's ( 1992) argument that social contracting can replace economic contracts over time and with Williamson's (1975) observation that over time repeated interaction limits opportunism. The three variables we chose represent agency risks emanating from the delegation of decision-making authority. rather than from goal conflict. Significant negative coefficients on these variables in our governance equations would support H1.  \n\nConsistent with Barney et al. (1989). we measured perceived business risk as VCs' satisfaction with the venture's recent performance. We used VCs' assessments of their satisfaction with venture performance (on a Likert scale from $1=$ not at all satisfied to $5=$ extremely satisfied) rather than sales or profitability measures because of the inadequacy of financial indicators for assessing the performance of venture capital-backed firms (Gladstone 1988). Given this rating scheme, greater business risk would be indicated by lower performance evaluations; thus, significant negative coefficients for venture performance would support  \n\nTABLE 4 Means and Standard Deviations of Independent Variables   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">U.K.</td><td colspan=\"2\">FR</td><td colspan=\"2\">NL</td><td colspan=\"2\">U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Variable</td><td>Mean</td><td>SD</td><td>Mean</td><td>SD</td><td>Mean</td><td>SD</td><td>Mean</td><td>SD</td></tr><tr><td>CEO'sindustryexperience</td><td>13.43</td><td>7.42</td><td>12.95</td><td>7.47</td><td>12.62</td><td>8.47</td><td>10.69</td><td>9.01</td></tr><tr><td>CEO'sstart-upexperience</td><td>.36</td><td>.48</td><td></td><td>.50</td><td>.33</td><td>.48</td><td>.50</td><td>.51</td></tr><tr><td>Venture'syearsinVCFportfolio</td><td>3.28</td><td>2.09</td><td>3.16</td><td>2.59</td><td>3.32</td><td>2.75</td><td>4.18</td><td>4.28</td></tr><tr><td>Ventureperformance</td><td>2.86</td><td>.95</td><td>3.23</td><td>.73</td><td>3.02</td><td>.75</td><td>2.96</td><td>.78</td></tr><tr><td>Venture stage</td><td>.74</td><td></td><td>.86</td><td>.35</td><td>.89</td><td>.32</td><td>.55</td><td>.50)</td></tr><tr><td>Technicalinnovation</td><td>.5x</td><td>.50)</td><td>.65</td><td>.48</td><td>.57</td><td>.50</td><td>.43</td><td>.50</td></tr><tr><td>Marketinginnovation</td><td>.53</td><td>.50</td><td>.47</td><td>.50)</td><td>.30)</td><td>.46</td><td>.51</td><td>.51</td></tr><tr><td>Productinnovation</td><td>.86</td><td>.35</td><td>.67</td><td>.47</td><td>.78</td><td>.42</td><td>.65</td><td>.48</td></tr><tr><td>Venture capitalist's VC experience</td><td>10.17</td><td>5.81</td><td>10.50</td><td>7.43</td><td>6.59</td><td>3.47</td><td>.38</td><td>.49</td></tr><tr><td>Venturecapitalist'sventureexperience</td><td>2.31</td><td>1.24</td><td>2.79</td><td>1.17</td><td>1.86</td><td>1.15</td><td>2.14</td><td>1.22</td></tr><tr><td>Geographicdistance</td><td>92.26</td><td>104.38</td><td>80.85</td><td>t9'19</td><td>64.03</td><td>41.66</td><td>138.41</td><td>172.58</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nLegend: CEO industry experience $=$ years of experience n the venture's industry: CEO start-up experience $=1$ if CEO has had previous start-up experience. 0 if not: venture's years in VCF porttolio $=$ years since VCF's initial investment in the venture: venture performance $=$ averaged VCs'ratings of venture performance on12 different financral and nonfinancial dimensions in Europe and 15 in the U.S.: venture stage $=11$ if early stage. 1 if late stage: technical innovation $=0$ if low relative to competitors. 1 if high: marketing innovation $=0$ if low relative to competitors, 1 if high: product innovation $=$ 0 if low relative to competitors. 1 if high: venture captialist's VC experience $\\rightleftharpoons$ numher ot years in the venture capital industry (for U.S., 0 if $\\leftrightarrows$ yrs.. 1 if ${\\bf>}\\mathbf{+}$ yrs.): venture capitalist's new venture experience $=$ number of years operating experience for the VC in the venture's industry (for U.S.. the figure represents the number of rounds of financing for which the VC has worked with the venture in its industry): geographic distance $=$ number of minutes it takes the venture capitalist to travel to the venture. Abbreviations as in Table 1.  \n\nH2. Previous research comparing VCs' and CEOs' assessments of venture performance showed this measure to be highly reliable and valid (Sapienza 1992: Sapienza and Gupta. 1994).  \n\n#### Uncertainty  \n\nUncertainty (defined as the gap between the information possessed by decision-makers and the information needed to make effective decisions [Galbraith 1973]) was operationalized by venture stage and by three measures of innovation. Sapienza and Gupta (1994) argued that uncertainty is at its height in the earliest stages of venture development. Because terminology and definitions of financing stage vary across and even within countries (Bygrave and Timmons 1992), we opted for a dichotimization of this variable ( $0=$ earlystage, $1=$ late stage) to simplify interpretation and minimize the probability of observing spurious relationships. Our expectation that uncertainty is highest in early stage venture means that we were predicting a negative coefficient for the stage variable (H3).  \n\nZaltman, Duncan. and Holbek (1973) suggested that uncertainty among decision-makers about cause-effect relationships increases as the level of innovation increases. Therefore. in order to capture uncertainty emanating from cause-effect uncertainty we used three measures of innovation consistent with the three types of innovation suggested by Zaltman et al. (1973): technical, product, and marketing innovation. VCs were asked to rate ventures' level of innovation relative to their competitors' on each of these three dimensions of innovation. For each. we coded responses as $\\cdots0^{\\cdot\\cdot}$ if the innovation was rated equal to or less than competitors. \"1\" if rated greater or much greater than competitors. Because greater uncertainty here is indicated by higher numbers. positive values on these three indicators would supportH3.  \n\nIn Europe, we acquired two measures of VCs experience: (1) VC experiencc was indicated by VCs' years of experience in the venture capital industry, and (2) VCs focal industry experience was indicated by their years' operating experience in the venture's industry. In the U.S. survey, the original measures had been slightly different: VC experience had been coded as $\"0\"$ if VCs had worked in the venture capital industry for fewer than five years and \\*1\" if it was five or more: VCs' focal industry experience had been indicated by the number of rounds of financing the VC had worked with the venture in the focal industry. Significant negative coefficients for these VC experience variables would support H4.  \n\n### Independent Variables Predicting VC Value Added  \n\nAll independent variables predicting face-to-face interaction were also used to predict valueadded; the grouping of the variables varied slightly to reflect the constructs in the final three hypotheses. H5 predicts that VCs add most value when ventures are neediest; venture needs were assumed to be greatest when CEOs were inexperienced, when the venture had been in the portfolio a longer time. and when venture performance was perceived as being poor. H6 predicts that value added will be higher when uncertainty is greater. Early stage ventures face greater uncertainties regarding demand. pricing, product requirements, and channels of distribution. among others. Thus, H6 implies a negative relationship with venture stage but a positive relationship with the three types of innovation measured here. Finally. VCs' experience is predicted in H7 to be positively related to venture experience. As described in the prior sections, we measured experience as a venture capitalist and experience in the focal industry because the two represent two fundamentally different but potentially important ways in which VCs can add value.  \n\n## Tests of Governance and Value-Added Hypotheses  \n\nThe governance hypotheses and the expectations for value added were examined via ordinary least squares multiple regressions in which the 10 predictor variables and the control variable (i.e. geographic distance) were regressed against face-to-face interaction (see Table 5) and value added (see Table 6).  \n\nThese tests were first conducted for each country separately as theoretical and empirical literature have indicated that significant differences exist between the United States and Europe and within the European venture capital market (Ooghe et al. 1991). Results within the United States appear in column 5 in both tables. Results within the United Kingdom, France. and the Netherlands appear in columns 1-3, respectively. We also ran tests with aggregated European data. using the United Kingdom as the base case and entering dummy variables for France and the Netherlands: these results appear in column 4. Aggregating the data in this way allowed us to see more directly how each compares with the other countries in Europe and to see how the overall models worked in the United States versus Europe. Pooling the U.S. and European data would not have been advisable given the differences in timeframe and terminology.  \n\nIn conducting the regression analyses, we dropped all cases with missing data. Thus, missing data accounted for differences in the \\*Ns\" across our tables. We included geographic distance (travel time for the VC to the venture) as a control variable in analyses because it may have had an impact on the cost of involvement (Lerner 1995) or the probability of opportunistic behavior (Barney et al. 1994b).  \n\nTABLE 5 Governance Tests (Predicting Face-to-Face Interaction)\"   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>U.K.</td><td>FR</td><td>NL</td><td>EUR</td><td>U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Adj.

As mentioned earlier. the matched pair sampling procedure used in the original study indicated a high level of interrater reliability between VCs and entrepreneurs. This correspondence reduces, but does not eliminate. concern about common method variance. which might hinder the interpretability of the data. Because in the present study we used only a single data source for responses, we used an analytic method suggested by Podsakoff and Organ (1986) to examine the extent to which common method variance might undermine the validity of our data. We examined the factor structure of the criterion and predictor variables. If only a single factor emerged or if the variance in the data were largely explained by a single factor. the threat of common method variance would be high. For our data, at least four factors emerged in each country with eigenvalues greater than 1. and the largest single factor in any country explained only $22\\%$ of the variance; the same pattern also held when all data were pooled. Thus. common method variance did not appear to be a significant problem for our data set.  \n\n# RESULTS  \n\nTable 2 indicates the number and type of VCFs by country, the size of ventures boards of directors (including the number of inside members), and several of the characteristics of the ventures themselves. Consistent with what has been observed in prior literature (e.g.. Timmons and Sapienza 1992). our sample shows a much higher percentage of early stage ventures in the United States $(43\\%)$ than in the United Kingdom $(27\\%)$ , France $(14\\%)$ . or the Netherlands $(9\\%)$ . Because economic sectors were measured differently in the two studies, we cannot make direct comparisons of ventures by economic sector between the United States and Europe. Manufacturing, computer-related. and consumer products account for $56\\%$ of the sample in the United Kingdom. $49\\%$ in France, and $35\\%$ in the Netherlands. Biotech, chemicals. and electronics make up $32\\%$ of the ventures in the Netherlands. but only $14\\%$ of those in the United Kirgdom and France. Across the sample, the percentage of CEOs with prior start-up experience is between $30\\%$ and $40\\%$ . In all four countries ventures pursue greater relative product innovation than they do technical or marketing innovation.  \n\nTable 3 indicates that VC-CEO pairs averaged meeting slightly more than once a month. Our interviews showed that in the U.S. board meetings occur about once a month in very early stage ventures and quarterly as the venture reaches greater maturity. Thus. given that the majority of ventures in this sample are late stage ventures, the rate of faceto-face interaction in this sample probably indicates that VC-CEO pairs meet informally with some regularity. Table 3 also shows how many hours VCs devote yearly to each portfolio company. Clearly. VCs in the United States and the United Kingdom expend greater effort in monitoring and assisting their portfolio companies than do those in France and the Netherlands; this observation is true both in terms of the frequency of personal contact and the total number of hours expended on each venture.  \n\nTable 3 also displays a remarkable consistency across all four countries in regards to the value added through strategic. interpersonal, and networking roles. These roles are roughly equivalent to what Fredriksen et al. (1990. p. 251) labeled \"competence, support, and access to networks.\" Generally speaking, VCs see themselves as providing the greatest value through their strategic roles and the least through their networking assistance. These results help to clarify how VCs add value to their portfolio companies. Much of the previous literature has failed to recognize the interpersonal dimension of VC-venture partnerships. Our results indicate clearly that the social or interpersonal roles of venture capitalists are a significant element in the functioning of these partnerships. In the United States and the United Kingdom, value added through interpersonal roles is close to the level of value added in strategic roles, whereas in France and the Netherlands the value added of interpersonal roles is closer to the less important networking roles.  \n\nU.S. VCs see themselves as offering the greatest value added overall. The closeness of the average ratings between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands may be somewhat misleading in that VCs in the Netherlands place greater emphasis on networking roles. roles seen as least critical across the sample. In general. perceptions of value added correspond with effort expended ( hours devoted to the portfolio company and frequency of interaction ). Table 4 indicates that CEOs average between 11 and 13 years of experience. Venture performance ratings in all four countries are near the midpoint, indicating that the sample is not biased toward either high or low performing ventures.  \n\n## Governance Results  \n\nTable 5 presents the results of regression cquations testing our four governance hypotheses. As may be observed, face-to-face governance in the United States is much better explained by the factors examincd in this study than is such governance in Europe. Specifically. the adjusted $\\mathbf{R}^{?}$ for the model in the United States is $54\\%$ : it ranges between $13\\%$ and $18\\%$ in the European countries. and $18\\%$ Overall for Europe. We will first present the results comparing the U.S. and the pooled European sample: we will conclude with a summary of the impact of country on face-to-face interaction.  \n\n### Agency Risk and Governance  \n\nH1 (face-to-face interaction is greater when agency risks are high) receives mixed support. Less CEO experience is not related to more face-to-face contact. CEOs' industry experience is unrelated to VC-CEO contact both in the United States and in the pooled European sample; in France, contrary to expectations. VCs more frequently visit CEOs with grcater industry experience. Further. in the overall European sample (and in the Netherlands and France). CEOs with more start-up experience are visited by VCs significantly more frequently than less experienced CEOs. In the United States, the relationship is negative. as predicted, but is not significant. As predicted. fewer years in the VCF's portfolio are associated with significantly greater face-to-face contact in France and the United States. This relationship is relatively weak even in these countries and does not hold for the overall sample in Europe.  \n\n### Business Risk and Governance  \n\nH2 (face-to-face interaction is greatcr when business risk is high) is not supported. Venture performance is unrelated to governance in the United States and in the pooled sample in Europe: contrary to our prediction, it is positively related to VC-CEO interaction in the Netherlands.  \n\n### Uncertainty and Governance  \n\nH3 predicted that greater uncertainty leads to greater governance effort. This prediction is strongly supported in terms of venture stage but is not supported in terms of innovation. Earlier stage ventures receive significantly more face-to-face interaction both in the United  \n\nStates and in Europe. It should be noted that this result holds despite controlling for the number of years the ventures have been in the portfolio. All three subsamples in Europe show the same strong negative relationship; in France, the relationship is also as expected but is not significant. The results do not indicate increased governance in response to innovation as predicted in the hypothesis. For the pooled European sample, none of the three measures of innovation are significantly related to VC-CEO contact. In the United States, only marketing innovation is related to face-to-face interaction, and it is in the opposite direction of the one predicted. Further, whereas marketing innovation in France and product innovation in the Netherlands are related to face-to-face interaction in the manner predicted. both technical and product innovation in France are in the opposite direction as that predicted.  \n\n### VC Experience and Governance  \n\nAs we predicted in H4. VCs' experience in the venture capital industry is negatively related to face-to-face interaction in both Europe and the United States. However. contrary to expectations. VCs' experience in the new venture's industry is positively associated with governance in both the United States and the pooled European sample. The strong relationships in the UK between VCs' experience in the venture's industry and personal contact appear to be driving the significant results in the pooled sample. Thus, H4 receives mixed support.  \n\n### Distance and Governance  \n\nAs might be expected. geographic distance appears to reduce face-to-face contact; this effect is significant in the United States. in the pooled European sample, and in the United Kingdom.  \n\n### Governance by Country within Europe  \n\nThe significant negative coefficients in column 4 of Table 5 for the country dummy variables $(\\mathrm{FR}=-0.693;\\mathrm{NL}=-0.647)$ indicate that when compared with the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, VCs in France have significantly less face-to-face interaction with CEOs: and when compared with the United Kingdom and France, VCs in the Netherlands have significantly less interaction with CEOs. In other words, country has significant explanatory power for interaction in Europe. An inspection of Table 3 shows that what this means is that VCs in the UK interact on a face-to-face basis with their CEOs more frequently than do the VCs in the other two countries. As mentioned earlier. VCs in the United States and the United Kingdom appear to take a much more active governance role than do those in France and the Netherlands.  \n\n## Value-Added Results  \n\nTable 6 presents the results of equations regressing value added against indicators of venture need. uncertainty. and VC experience. Table 6 shows that as with governance efforts, the value-added efforts of VCs in the United States is better explained than are those of European VCs. However, in this instance the difference is not as dramatic. Specifically, the adjusted ${\\mathbf{R}}^{2}$ for the model in the United States is $35\\%$ , whereas it ranges between $15\\%$ and $25\\%$ in the European countries and is $20\\%$ for the pooled sample in Europe.  \n\n### VentureNeed andValue Added  \n\nFor the most part, H5 (that venture need is positively related to VC value added) is not supported. CEOs' industry experience is unrelated to value added in the United States and in Europe, including the subsamples in each country. As anticipated, CEOs' start-up experience is negatively related to value added in the United States, but the relationship is not significant. Start-up experience is marginally positively related to value added for the pooled sample in Europe. a result opposite that expected. Second, as predicted, fewer years in the portfolio are negatively related to value added in the Netherlands. However, this relationship is marginal, and years in the portfolio are not related to value added in the United States Or the pooled European sample. Finally, venture performance is positively related to value added both in the pooled European sample and in the United States. This result is contrary to our expectations.  \n\n### Uncertainty andValue Added  \n\nOur results indicate consistent support for the prediction that value added will be greatest when uncertainty is high (H6). As predicted, a strong negative relationship exists between venture stage and value added in the United States. No relationship exists between stage and value added for the pooled European sample, but this result is complex. The expected negative relationship between stage and value added is present in the Netherlands. but this is offset by an unexpected positive relationship in France. Interestingly, French VCs appear to interact more frequently with early stage ventures (see Table 5) but perceive greater contributions in later stage investments.  \n\nAs anticipated, the results show a positive relationship between venture innovation and value added in the pooled European sample, but innovation is not related to value added in the United States. Value-added increases significantly with increases in technical innovation and marketing innovation in the pooled sample for Europe. These results appear to be largely due to strong relationships between innovation and value added in the United Kingdom. Product innovation has no impact on value-added in any of the four countries.  \n\n### VC Experience and Value Added  \n\nH7, predicting that value added will be directly related to VC experience. receives mixed support. Contrary to expectations, VCs' venture capital industry experience is negatively related to value added in the pooled European sample; it is not related to perceptions of value added in the United States. As we predicted. however, VCs' experience in the venture's industry is positively associated with value added both in the United States and in the pooled European sample. Further, both types of VC experience are positively related to value added in the United Kingdom.  \n\n### Distance and Value Added  \n\nGeographic distance is not related to value added in the pooled European sample or in any of its subsamples. Distance marginally dampens value added in the United States.  \n\n### Value Added by Country within Europe  \n\nThe significant negative coefficient in column 4 for France (FR) indicates that when compared with the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. VCs in France add significantly less value to their ventures. As was the case with face-to-face interaction. these results indicate that country holds significant cxplanatory power for value added in Europe. An inspection of Table 3 shows that VCs in the United Kingdom offer the greatest value of the three, closely followed by those in the Netherlands and. more distantly. by those in France.  \n\n# DISCUSSION  \n\nThis study provides insight into how and when VCs in the United States and Europe vary involvement in their portfolio companies and what the value-added consequences of this variation are. We extend prior work on governance in at least two directions: (1) we examined a broader conceptual framework of governance than previously used, and (2) we developed and tested a model of VC value added. Moreover. by collecting data in four major markets for venture capital, we were able to examine what elements of VC involvement are constant across settings and which ones vary. Thus, our results help to illustrate the nature and effect of variations of VC involvement on a country-by-country basis. Knowledge of differences and similarities in norms and practices rises in importance as competition among high-potential ventures becomes increasingly global.  \n\nOur results show that agency. business risk. and information-processing perspectives are useful in predicting VC monitoring behavior in all four markets. However, the weak results with regard to agency risks suggest that problems of delegation of decision-making authority and managerial opportunism may be adequately handled by the contractual and structural arrangements between VCs and their portfolio companies. As predicted, we found that VCs engaged in greater face-to-face oversight of their investments when ventures faced the uncertainties associated with early stage ventures. when the VCs themselves had less experience as VCs. and when the VCs were in greater geographic proximity to the venture. Contrary to expectations, VCs with greater experience in the venture's industry interacted more frequently with their CEOs, and, in Europe, VCs interacted more frequently with CEOs who had greater start-up experience. Poor venture performance did not appear to prompt greater monitoring as had been expected.  \n\nWe developed a model of value added based on the expectation that VCs would add most value when ventures were relatively weak. when uncertainty was high. and when VCs were relatively more experienced. Results indicated that, as expected, VCs experienced in the focal industry provided significantly more value than those with less focal industry experience. However, contrary to expectations. VCs added more value to high performing than to poorly performing ventures. Additionally, experience in the venture capital industry was positively (but not significantly) related to value added in the United States but was negatively related to value added in Europe.  \n\nMultiple explanations appear feasible for results contrary to expectations. Our failure to observe the expected relationships between CEO experience and monitoring or value added may have to do with individual preferences or power. Barney et al. (1994a) found inexperienced CEOs more receptive to VC advice. It is possible. therefore, that VCs have to expend greater effort influencing experienced CEOs. A second possibility is that more experienced CEOs demand more attention, especially in Europe where such effort on the part of VCs appears lower. This possibility points up a potential weakness of the agency  \n\nperspective in its implicit assumption that the principal controls the nature and level of gov.   \nernance.  \n\nPerhaps the most fascinating results involve venture performance. We had argued that VCs would interact with and add more value to ventures doing poorly. Our results show that venture performance had no impact on face-to-face interaction, except in the Netherlands where the relationship is positive rather than negative. Further, venture performance was positively related to value added in both the pooled European sample and in the United States. Although business risk arguments suggest that VCs will be more involved when venture viability is threatened, an alternative view is suggested by prospect theory. In this view. decision-makers seek to avoid or limit risks when faced with a situation in which high returns are expected (Sitkin and Pablo 1992). Thus. it may be that when VCs begin to anticipate high returns from superior ventures, they do whatever they can to enhance and protect those returns—i.e., they pour more effort into adding value. This interpretation is consistent with Sapienza et al. (1994) who speculated that VCs might follow a \"home run\" strategy and focus attention on the winners in their portfolios rather than ventures that are expected to yield little return. Additionally. VCs may seek to add value to high performers because they prefer to be associated with a winner. On the other hand, we cannot rule out the possibility that when VCs are satisfied with venture performance they assume their input has been more worthwhile. Finally, we may simply have the direction of causality reversed. Perhaps when VCs add more value, the ventures do better.  \n\nDifferences in our regression equations by country indicate that VCs were driven by different factors in different markets. Further, the significant coefficients for the country variables in the European analyses demonstrate that the level of monitoring and value added of VCs is at significantly different levels in the three countries. Clearly. VCs in France are least involved and add the least value to their portfolio companies: generally speaking, VCs in the United Kingdom are most involved and add the most value. Whereas comparisons between Europe and the United States must be made with caution for reasons explained in the Method section, indications are that VC behavior in the United Kingdom is more similar to that in the United States than are the other two. The numerous similarities across markets are captured by our theoretical perspectives and detailed above. but the substantial differences are consistent with Hofstede's (1984) view that culture plays a dramatic role in the conduct of business. Further. the fact that our models best predicted the behavior of VCs in the United States lends some support to Hofstede's contention that theories are culturally bound: the theories we used were largely developed in the United States.  \n\nA close inspection of the regression equations suggests that VCs in France behave least like those elsewhere. Not only are the French VCs least involved, but their monitoring pattern is hardly captured by the variables measured here. and they are the only country in which value added is perceived as being higher for later stage ventures. One explanation of these differences is that VCFs in France are dominated by financial institutions whose VCs may be primarily former bank managers with less experience in venture building. Another factor may be that institutional investing in France is provided by investors from outside France. Whereas we can only speculate about possible cultural effects on behavior, the fact that VCs in France were least like that of the others is consistent with Hampden-Turner and Trompenaars (1993. p. 15) who place the values of managers in the United States. the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands in one group and those in France, Japan, and Germany in another.  \n\nThe most consistent result across the sample was that VCs saw their strategic roles as their most important contributions, followed by their interpersonal roles, and then their networking roles. This result is particularly notable. because so little attention has been given in the literature to the importance of the interpersonal aspects of the venture capital process (Fried and Hisrich 1995). The importance VCs accord to mentor and confidant roles provides additional insight into how VCs develop the desired receptivity in entrepreneurs (Barney et al. 1994a) and are thereby able to add value. One of the VCs we interviewed expressed the importance in this way:  \n\nIn some cases, where the relationship is really a solid one with management, we can add a lot more [than just money]. In those cases where we don't have a good relationship--when we don't have rapport—there is just nothing we can do.  \n\nAnecdotal and empirical evidence (Sapienza 1989) suggest that by and large VCs are able to create and maintain the level of understanding and rapport necessary to function effectively. The evidence here suggests that those VCs who develop only distant or adversarial relationships may be seen as uncaring \"vulture capitalists\" and may not be allowed to perform their fiduciary and advisory duties effectively.  \n\n## Implications for Practice  \n\nOur data support Bhide's (1994) contention that the personal contact of outside investors with the management of private firms plays a role in the governance of those firms, and Fiet's (1995) view that VCs try to manage agency risks through face-to-face post-investment interaction. In our sample, the more developed the venture capital market, the more personally involved VCs were in their investment companies. Further, the more involved they were. the more they contributed to these firms. These observations hold implications for all VCFs. but the implications vary by country in some instances.  \n\nOur results suggest that the high contact level for VCFs in the United States may help to protect the U.S. market somewhat from entry by foreign VCFs. However. given the growing variety of sources of financing in the United States (Timmons and Sapienza 1992). such barriers may not be sufficient to stave off competition. VCFs in the United States may be increasingly pressed to seek other ways to differentiate themselves from domestic competitors and substitutes. The importance accorded VCs interpersonal roles suggests that VCFs might build sustainable competitive advantage by selecting and developing new partners with skills and aptitudes especially suited to the strategic and human challenges faced by entrepreneurs. Our data also suggest that experienced VCs are more effcient in monitoring new ventures; however. value added appears to be most related to focal industry experience. Thus, VCFs should not expect new partners to be as efficient in these roles as they will eventually become. Of course. VC's must also learn to manage the balance between maintaining fiduciary objectivity and establishing a professional closeness. Further, it may be important for VCFs to specialize by industry or to bring in staff to supplement industry-specific knowledge.  \n\nWhereas these same implications exist for VCFs in the United Kingdom, some additional possibilities also exist. First. VCFs in the United Kingdom may be able to more fully penetrate the market for value-added money and assistance. As McNally (1994) points out. the contribution of the venture capital industry to the growth of new firms in the United Kingdom has been somewhat limited by its focus on MBO deals. By partnering with corporate investors who could add their technical expertise to the VCFs strategic and development skils, VCFs could expand into more early stage, high technology investment opportunities. Further, the relative absence of high value-added activity by VCFs on the continent suggests that U.K. VCFs could successfully penetrate that market. Geographic distance will be less an impediment for U.K. than for U.S. VCFs. Nonetheless, new entrants from either country would have to find ways of dealing with barriers posed by language and cultural differences.  \n\nAs markets become more fully global, VCFs on the continent may be forced to contend with greater outside competition. Entrepreneurs in the Netherlands and France may be in a position to demand more than mere financial involvement for a stake in their ventures. Even if such competition from the outside does not materialize, VCFs within these countries may gain significant advantage from adopting the practices of U.S. and U.K. VCFs. A question we cannot answer from our data is whether the tremendous emphasis French VCs put on their financial role is consonant with the wishes of their entrepreneurs. Previous studies (e.g., Fredriksen et al. 1990: Landstrom 1991) suggest that entrepreneurs in parts of Europe are dissatisfied with the industry and operating experience of VCs and with their relatively low level of involvement in the venture building process. Whereas such competencies may routinely develop as these markets mature. those VCFs that pioneer this direction in investor activity may reap significant experience and reputational benefits.  \n\nAnother implication of our findings is that entrepreneurs may be able to understand and anticipate the variation in their investors\\* oversight activities as well as the types of roles VCs see as most critical. Our data reveal that entrepreneurs can expect (1) more involvement when the venture is in an early stage of development: (2) more involvement when the venture is doing well; and (3) more value placed by VCs on their strategic and interpersonal roles than on their roles as contacts to outside networks. As venture capitalists do, entrepreneurs should put effort into selecting investment partners, and after selection, into developing productive exchange relationships with them.  \n\nThe absence in this study of an association between value added and the CEO's experience is consistent with our earlier study in the United States (Sapienza 1992) and suggests that VCFs can add value regardless of the experience level of entrepreneurs. The assumption in the United States that experienced entrepreneurs cannot use assistance (Sapienza et al. 1994) is not shared by European venture capitalists who are more involved with experienced CEOs. The actual transfer of knowledge, however, may depend largely on entrepreneurs remaining receptive to advice and information exchange (Barney et al. 1994a).  \n\nThis study also holds implications for policy-makers in all four countries. One implication is that if policy-makers are going to try to stimulate growth through venture capital, incentives should be aimed at stimulating more early stage venture capital where the greatest bang for the buck appears to be achieved. If entrepreneurial companies are truly the engines of economic growth and of the renewal of the industrial fber, then policy-makers should direct special attention to providing incentives for VCFs' investment in early stage ventures. In the light of our findings, the recent decision by the Dutch government to discontinue its state guarantee scheme (the so-called PPM rule. in which a portion of losses incurred by VCFs can be recovered) appears to be counterproductive. As a direct consequence of this policy change, many PPM VC funds have ceased operations. diminishing the amount of capital available for start-ups and the supply of experienced VCs. Our results suggest that. instead, the guarantee scheme should have been broadened to also encourage investment in start-ups in other European countries (e.g.. France) where VC involvement is minimal and early stage capital is unavailable.  \n\nPolicy-makers might be well advised to provide incentives for managers with industrial experience to start or join VCFs and to assist in the training of recruits from the industrial sectors. Since much of the additional value of venture capital financing appears to come from the interpersonal relations themselves, training should include information not only about the economic aspects of venture building but also about critical social and supportive roles. Finally. agencies could help entrepreneurs by establishing services that provide information on VCFs' investmcnt preferences, performance, cxperience. and reputation. In countries where VCFs follow passive invcstment strategies. policy-makers might also consider legislation reducing impediments to cross-border venture capital investing.  \n\n## Limitations and Future Research Directions  \n\nWe urge the reader to view the comparisons of the United States and European markets with extreme caution. As we stated earlier. thc separation in time of the two surveys may have caused unmeasured differences in results. Further, certain limitations exist with regard to all multiple country studies. Apart from the language difficulties, these studies have to acknowledge the differences in definitions and concepts that are used in different cultural settings. Such problems exist whether investigators are using primary or secondary data sources. Researchers would be well advised to seek to introduce variables to control for cultural differences, to include cross-country experts on their research teams. and to design into their instruments mcasures that counter existing differences in terminology or concepts. In essence, when conducting multiple country studies. knowledge of the different institutional and cultural environments is imperative to allow for a meaningful interpretation of the results.  \n\nThis study was limited by its cross-scctional design and the self-report nature of the data. Although other or additional sources would have reduced concerns about common method variance. the nature of many of the variables precluded alternative data sources. Nonetheless. where possible, future research may profitably cmploy additional data sources and measures of some of the variables. Our study could not include all variables of possible consequence. For example. we did not measure the possible moderating effects of syndication. Another important variable might be VCF typc. One might speculate that governmentsupported VCFs are hamstrung in their ability to attract high quality VCs. because they are not able to compensate VCs on a level equal to that of private VCFs. We were not able to test this possiblity given the small number of government VC firms in our sample.  \n\nA more complete understanding of investor governance and involvement might be achicved by examining how VCs and entrepreneurs use structural and behavioral factors to define their relationships. Several studies have examined how VCFs adjust governance mechanisms to cope with increased agency. business, or uncertainty risks (e.g.. Barney et al. 1989. 1994a, 1994b: Lerner 1995: Sapienza and Gupta 1994). but it remains a challenge of theoretical and practical importance to examine whether structural and behavioral mechanisms are used to complement or substitute for one another. In terms of the specific roles or activities undertaken by VCs, past studies have focused on the strategic and operational activities of VCs (e.g.. Barney et al. 1994a: Harrison and Mason 1992: MacMillan et al. 1989). The results of this study suggest that deeper investigation into the importance and formation of interpersonal roles and their impact on monitoring effectiveness, entrepreneurial receptivity, and VC value added might also be productive.  \n\nSecond, VC involvement behavior might also be more fully explained and predicted by approaching the issues from new perspectives. For example, one route might be to examine VCs as agents in addition to considering their positions as principals. VCs act as the agents of entrepreneurs in negotiating additional financing, selling the venture off to private interests, and taking ventures public. Further, VCs are agents of their limited partners. Bygrave and Shulman (1988) noted that VCFs receive annual fees based on the amount of capital under management. This scheme provides them with an incentive to raise as large a fund as possible. regardless of whether they can adequately perform their fiduciary responsibilities over a greater number of ventures. This scheme also provides them an incentive to invest in later stage ventures since fewer such investments would be required to place all of their capital. As one VC said to us. \"It doesn't take a genius to figure out that a $5\\%$ return on $\\$100$ million is better than $20\\%$ on $\\$10$ million.\" Interviews also revealed that conflict of interest is often between one investor and another investor (rather than between investors and management as is assumed by agency theory) because of different preferences in the timing of exit or valuation of the venture. In short, both agency theory and understanding of investor-investee relations might be advanced by relaxing the unidirectional assumptions inherent in current applications of the theory.  \n\nThird. more research is needed on the impact of entrepreneur-investor dynamics on the effectiveness of the board of directors. Information theory and interactional justice theory might be used to help reveal how board meetings may be effectively managed, what information is most critical. and what interactional processes best transfer knowledge and capture the value-adding potential of outside board members. Further. research is needed to investigate the impact of entrepreneur-investor dynamics on venture strategy, including the level of aggressiveness, the level of innovation pursued, and the degree of risk-taking assumed by the venture.  \n\nFinally, the growing phenomenon of cross-border investing offers an attractive arena for study. How do geographic distance. venture stage, language, and cultural factors impact the nature and value of venture capital across borders? Our framework for value added suggests that a complementarity of background would enhance value added. Does a complementarity of cultural perspective also enhance value-adding potential? If a high-potential venture aims to be internationalized from the outset, would it benefit from a board of advisors/investors representing the various regions it is targeting? Although questions of governance and value added are essentially the same for cross-border relations as they are for single country ones. finding the answers may require additional methodological complexity and additional theoretical perspectives to the ones we have applied in the past.  \n\n# REFERENCES  \n\nAlchian, A.A.. and Demsetz.

We consider three dimensions of social capital - i.e., the structural, cognitive and relational dimensions - and three stages of the financing decision - i.e., the access, negotiation and action stages. We develop a conceptual model to disentangle the impact mechanisms, namely, the information mechanism of the structural dimension in the access stage, the knowledge mechanism of the cognitive dimension and the trust mechanism of the relational dimension in the negotiation stage. Using China as our experimental setting, we find that the structural and cognitive dimensions facilitate venture capital financing, whereas the relational dimension does not. The results advance our understanding of the interrelationship among the three dimensions of social capital and their impact mechanisms on entrepreneurial financing.  \n\n## 1.Introduction  \n\nThe concept of social capital is originated from community studies. Although a number of studies acknowledge its significance, there is no consensus as to the definition of social capital. Among others, Coleman (1988) claims that social capital inheres in the structure of relations between actors and among actors. Like physical and human capital, social capital is productive and making possible the achievement of certain ends that in its absence would not be possible. Putnam (1993) defines social capital as a “public good\", suggesting that it is not private property. According to Bourdieu (1986) and Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998),however, social capital is referred to as social resources embedded in the network of relationships possessed by an individual or social unit.  \n\nNevertheless, social capital has been expanded to entrepreneurship since the pioneering work by Davidsson and Honig (2003) and Westlund and Bolton (2003). As documented in the literature, entrepreneurs often resort to their social capital to finance their start-ups, because they are endowed with few resources for new firms' survival and growth (Wang, 2016). In particular, entrepreneurs’ social capital enables them to access third-party guarantees and obtain direct or indirect financing, particularly debt financing, suggesting that social capital acts as alternative assets to loan collateral (Chua et al., 2010; Zhang, 2015). Moreover, Shane and Cable (2002) find that social capital can overcome the information asymmetry between entrepreneurs and investors and promote the flow of information among members in the network. Thus, social capital facilitates information flow and reduces financing costs (Engelberg et al., 2012; Putnam, 1993).  \n\nOne intriguing research question thus arises as to how entrepreneurs' social capital facilitates venture capital (VC) financing for their startups. For those high-tech and risky but financially constrained firms, VC provides not only monetary capital but also value-added services, such as management skills and opportunities.1 Indeed, entrepreneurs holding social capital are likely to be funded by venture capital (Shane and Cable, 2002; Wang, 2016). It is still unclear, however, how social capital affects entrepreneurs’ financing choice towards venture capital (Stuart and Sorenson, 2007).  \n\nWe note a few limitations in the extant literature. First, social capital is often regarded as unitary in explaining entrepreneurs’ financing choices. Without looking into different aspects of social capital, one might neglect their differential effects on the financing decision and obtain inconclusive or even inaccurate results. Second, there is little evidence for which dimension of social capital plays a more important role in VC financing, given that social capital is multi-dimensional.2  \n\nThird, although a majority of empirical studies focuses on entrepreneurs’ financing outcomes, a few have paid attention to their financing process. How entrepreneurs obtain VC contains a series of actions and multiple stages (Mizruchi and Stearns, 2001; Wang, 2016). It is necessary to examine entrepreneurs′ financing process, because social capital is likely to exert an effect in earlier stages.  \n\nTo overcome the aforementioned limitations, we consider three dimensions of social capital and three stages of entrepreneurs’ decisionmaking process. Specifically, we adopt the classic taxonomy of social capital by Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998), which are the structural, relational and cognitive dimensions of social capital. The structural social capital refers to the overall pattern of connections, such as who you know and how you know them.The relational social capital concerns the particular kind of personal relationships, such as friendship, which influence people's behavior. The cognitive social capital refers to the resources that provide shared representations, interpretations, and systems of meaning. Then, we divide entrepreneurs’ financing decision towards VC into three stages - i.e., access, negotiation, and action. To elucidate how each dimension of entrepreneurs? social capital affects the three decision-making stages, we construct a conceptual model and propose three mechanisms, namely, the information mechanism of the structural dimension in the access stage, the knowledge mechanism of the cognitive dimension and the trust mechanism of the relational dimension in the negotiation stage. The three mechanisms constitute our main hypotheses.  \n\nAfterwards, we test the hypotheses using data from China. We use China as our experimental setting for two reasons. Firstly, social capital plays an important role in Chinese firms’ investments and financing activities. In a typical nepotist society, such as China, individuals are highly connected by a variety of relationships. Thus, Chinese firms are surrounded by social and business networks (Gibb and Li, 2003), which significantly influence their businesses and sales growth (Park and Luo, 2010). Secondly, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in China have severe financing difficulty, although their contribution to the economic growth is nonnegligible. A majority of SMEs show incomplete financial records, high financial risks and low credibility, and are thus left with few financing channels. How to obtain financial resources for those SMEs, particularly how social capital plays a role, is thus a provocative question faced by researchers and practitioners. As social capital becomes increasingly important in other transition economies and knowledge-intensive economies, the analyses in this study can be generalizable to those economies as well.  \n\nOur main findings are twofold. First, the structural and cognitive social capital positively affects venture capital financing, whereas the relational social capital shows an insignificant effect. Second, the combination of the structural and cognitive social capital imposes a significant effect on the financing result. The results suggest that the structural social capital provides an easier access to venture capital and that the cognitive social capital promotes knowledge exchange and cooperation in the negotiation with venture capitalists. Entrepreneurs holding the structural and cognitive social capital at the same time are more likely to seek for venture capital. Thus, the structural and cognitive social capital play pivotal roles in venture capital financing.  \n\nThis study contributes to the literature of social capital, entrepreneurship and venture capital. By looking at the three dimensions of social capital and the dynamic process of venture capital financing, we are able to disentangle the impact mechanism of each dimension of social capital. The conceptual model and empirical findings advance our understanding of the interactions among the three dimensions of social capital and how they affects the venture capital financing results. Our results also provide important implications for entrepreneurs to manage socialcapital.  \n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the theoretical background, a conceptual model, and hypothesis development. Section 3 explains the empirical design. Section 4 presents empirical results. Finally, Section 5 concludes.  \n\n## 2. Theoretical background and hypothesis development  \n\n### 2.1. Social capital  \n\nSocial capital describes personal relationships that are crucial in building trust, cooperation, and collective action in communities (Jacobs, 1965). Although it has been extended to a wide range of studies and a number of studies acknowledge its significance,3 there is no consensus as to the definition of social capital. Among many others, Baker (1990) defines social capital as the structure of the relationship networks,whereas Bourdieu(1986) additionally includes the actual or potential resources that can be accessed through networks. Building on those studies, Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998) suggest that social capital can be defined as the sum of the actual and potential resources embedded in the network of relationships possessed by an individual or organization. They classify social capital into three dimensions, which are the structural, relational, and cognitive dimensions of social capital. Specifically, the structural social capital refers to the overall pattern of connections, such as who you know and how you know them (Burt, 1992). The relational social capital concerns a particular kind of personal relationships, such as friendship. Finally, the cognitive social capital refers to the resources that provide shared representations, interpretations, and systems of meaning (Cicourel, 1973). In our study, we adopt the definition and the classification by Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998).  \n\nAccording to Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998), although it is not a universally beneficial resource, social capital affects people's action at least in two ways. Firstly, social capital increases the efficiency of action by increasing the efficiency of information diffusion, diminishing the probability of opportunism and reducing transaction costs (Burt, 1992; Putnam, 1993). Secondly, social capital facilitates the adaptive efficiency and creativity. For example, social capital facilitates cooperative behavior and the development of innovative organization (Putnam, 1993). Thus, social capital is deemed a productive and valuable asset.  \n\nBased on the classification by Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998), prior literature has distinguished the effects of the three dimensions of social capital. For example, as documented in Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998), the structural social capital mainly affects the access to parties for exchanging knowledge and participating in knowing activities, whereas the cognitive and relational social capital affects the anticipation of value, motivation to combine intellectual capital, and combination capability. Yli-Renko et al. (2001) argue that the social interaction and network ties are positively associated with knowledge acquisition but that the relationship quality dimension is negatively associated with knowledge acquisition. According to Pirolo and Presutti (2010), the strong interorganizational social capital positively affects start-ups' economic performance but negatively affects their innovation performance, whereas the weak interorganizational social capital imposes positive impacts on both economic and innovation performance. Batjargal (2003) finds that the relational and resource embeddedness have direct and positive impacts on firm performance but the structural embeddedness has no direct impact. Bonfim et al. (2018) show that the relational social capital is fundamental and the structural and cognitive dimensions play secondary roles in explaining innovation.  \n\n### 2.2.Financing decision  \n\nEntrepreneurs finance their firms using long-term debt or equity capital at varying times. One of the important decisions that entrepreneurs have to make is to decide which capital and what amount of the capital to use. In general, how entrepreneurs finance their firms largely depends on the size, the life-cycle stage, and the growth prospects of the firm. For firms in the early stage having few assets as collaterals, their entrepreneurs might be turned down by banks and led to venture capital, who are specialized in financing new and risky ventures.  \n\nA burgeoning literature has discussed what impacts entrepreneurs' financing choice towards venture capital. First, projects’ characteristics, such as the stage and amount of funding and the risk-return profile, affect entrepreneurs’ financing choices. If their projects are expected a low probability of success (Landier, 2003; Schafer et al., 2004; Winton and Yerramilli, 2008), or their start-ups are embedded with better intellectual property protection (Ueda, 2004), entrepreneurs are likely to seek for venture capital. The second set of impacting factors is related to entrepreneurs’ characteristics, such as personal wealth (i.e. collateral), ability (i.e. knowledge) and preference for risk, and the financing environment. Thirdly, when entrepreneurs expect more value-added activities from investors (Brander and Bettignies, 2006), they prefer venture capital financing, because venture capitalists often participate in running the start-ups and provide general business expertise.  \n\nFinancing with venture capital involves a complex process.How entrepreneurs decide on and obtain a specific venture capital might contain a series of actions and multiple stages (Mizruchi and Stearns, 2001; Wang, 2016). Among others, Wang (2016) and Van den Bulte and Lilien (2001, 2009) identify two stages in entrepreneurs’ financing decision, namely, the attention and evaluation stages. In fact, the entrepreneurial process is an evolutionary multistage selection process (Campbell, 1969). Baum and Silverman (2004) argue that venture financing can foster staged selection events. Eckhardt et al. (2006) claim that the multistage selection process is the most suitable theoretical lens to view the venture financing process.  \n\nNote that the other side of entrepreneurs’ financing decision is venture capitalists’ investment decision, which is also a dynamic decision-making process. Given the large number of projects and the complexity of evaluating those projects, VC firms generally split their decisions into relatively simple yet structured stages (Eckhardt et al., 2006; Newell and Simon, 1972). Using a case study methodology, Fried and Hisrich (1994) develop a six-stage model in the venture capital investment process, namely, origination, venture capital firm-specific screen, generic screen, first-phase evaluations, second-phase evaluation, and closing. In other words, the investment decision for venture capitalists, which is the financing decision for entrepreneurial firms, may go through multistage selections as well.  \n\nThe multistage selection model is applicable in the following conditions. First, entrepreneurial firms differ from each other in terms of capacity utilization rules (Winter and Nelson, 1982). Second, each entrepreneurial firm has a different possibility to be selected by venture capitalists (Hannan and Freeman, 1977). Third, the selection process is staged and the selection results in latter stages depend on the results in earlier stages (Aldrich, 1999). Fourth, the selection criteria may differ at different selection stages (Campbell, 1969).  \n\nBased on the two-stage model by Wang (2016) and the six-stage model by Fried and Hisrich (1994), we identify three stages in the venture capital financing decision, namely, the access to VC, negotiation with VC and actions. The access stage comes after the preliminary screening, corresponding to the attention stage in Wang (2016)'s model and the origination stage in Fried and Hisrich (1994)'s model. In the access stage, entrepreneurs get access to investors. The negotiation stage is in line with the evaluation stage in Wang (2016)'s model and the screen and evaluation stage in Fried and Hisrich (1994)'s model. In the negotiation stage, entrepreneurs and venture capitalists exchange their information and negotiate mainly about the price of shares. If the price is agreed, entrepreneurs and venture capitalists enter the third stage - i.e., the action stage. Venture capitalists provide capital for those entrepreneurial firms and obtain shares of equity. The action stage is similar to the closing stage in Fried and Hisrich (1994)'s model.  \n\n### 2.3.A conceptual model  \n\nBuilding on the theories of social capital and financing decisions, we construct a conceptual model, presented in Fig. 1, to elucidate how entrepreneurs′ social capital affects their financing decisions towards venture capital. In the model, we adopt the classification of social capital by Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998), which are the structural, relational, and cognitive dimensions, shown on the left side. On the right side of the model, we present three stages in the venture capital financing decision, which are access, negotiation, and action.  \n\nIn addition, we identify three decision factors in the financing decision process, each relevant to a different financing stage. The first selection factor, denoted as setting, refers to the general environment in the access stage. Funding proposals often come from a variety of settings through work ties, either as a manager of a prior investment or a consultant (Fried and Hisrich, 1994). Investors are likely to consider those start-ups that have been connected with the VC community before (Stuart and Sorenson, 2005). The second one, labelled business, indicates projects, products, business models, and other negotiation details in the transaction process. VCs are likely to invest into companies with innovative capabilities (Hellmann and Puri, 200o). The third one is personality, defined as entrepreneurs’ characteristics and personal relationships. Personal similarities between investors and entrepreneurs in terms of professional background, ways of thinking, and technical capabilities can promote venture capitalists? investment (Aggarwal et al., 2015). Both the business and personality factors matter for the negotiationstage.  \n\nMore importantly, we contend that each dimension of social capital imposes an impact on the financing decision process through a different mechanism, which constitutes our hypotheses. Specifically, the structural social capital provides access to resources by the information mechanism, leading to a setting for entrepreneurs to access venture capital. The cognitive social capital facilitates knowledge sharing and identifies personality after frequent or highly consistent discussions, resulting in financing negotiations. Finally, the relational social capital establishes trust between parties and enables them to cooperate in the negotiation stage (Totterman and Sten, 2005).  \n\nThe three mechanisms proposed in the conceptual model are consistent with prior studies. As documented in the literature, entrepreneurs’ social capital can increase their bargaining power, which determines the transaction price of entrepreneurial firms (Heughebaert and Manigart, 2012). Social capital transmits corporate information to outside potential investors and alleviates the risk of adverse selection borne by venture capitalists (Granovetter, 1995; Minten and Fafchamps, 1999; Montgomery, 1991). Moreover, social capital enhances trust and reputation and thus reduces the cost of formal contracts and the risk of moral hazard (Grossman and Hart, 1986; Javakhadze et al., 2016). Finally, social capital enables entrepreneurs to obtain unique information, which triggers innovative ideas for firms’ development (Laursen et al.,2012).  \n\nThus, as shown in Fig. 1, we maintain that the structural social capital facilitates information diffusion, the cognitive social capital transfers knowledge, and the relational social capital builds trust between different parties. We further demonstrate each mechanism and hypothesis in the following subsections.  \n\n#### 2.3.1.Structural social capital and the information mechanism  \n\nThe structural social capital is mostly accumulated by entrepreneurs working experiences, such as the number of years that entrepreneurs have stayed in prior firms, the number of firms and the highest job position that entrepreneurs have been employed, and the number of industries or companies that entrepreneurs have worked for. The more working experiences that an entrepreneur has maintained, he is more likely to get the access to financing resources. In other words, entrepreneurs build the structural social capital from previous jobs and obtain information and resources from it.  \n\n![](images/5ccbf21a2c5c6b0abef53969dc057a0e84800c52895119abd7571a24b6c70222.jpg)  \nFig. 1. A conceptual model of entrepreneurs’ social capital and venture capital financing.  \n\nAmong the resources, venture capital is an important financing resource that entrepreneurs can obtain from the structural social capital. Venture capitalists generally hold considerable amount of equity shares in different firms and even stay in the board of directors. If an entrepreneur has worked for many years in one or many firms, he has an opportunity to meet with those venture capitalists. Further, the higher is his job position, the entrepreneur has more chances to meet and establish relationships with venture capitalists. The relationship may eventually evolve to a business partnership once venture capitalists invest into the entrepreneur's venture. Moreover, if an entrepreneur has working experiences in multiple industries or companies, he can easily increase the size of his social network, diversify his network members, and increase his information sources and diversities. Collectively, we argue that entrepreneurs’ structural social capital is a platform to gather a number of investors and provides a necessary setting for entrepreneurs to get access to venture capital.  \n\nAs the structural social capital refers to the social system and the network of relations as a whole, it assembles all kinds of information that provide a setting for entrepreneurs to access all resources (Burt, 1992). In particular, entrepreneurs are able to obtain a variety of resources and capabilities from the interaction and communication with their networks. Those resources and capabilities, together with the networks, enable entrepreneurs to obtain, disseminate, and use financing information. We thus posit that the structural social capital affects the financing decision through the information mechanism.  \n\nThe first hypothesis is thus stated as follows:  \n\nHypothesis 1. Entrepreneurs’ structural social capital positively affects the access to venture capital through the information mechanism.  \n\n#### 2.3.2. Cognitive social capital and the knowledge mechanism  \n\nThe cognitive social capital underscores shared knowledge, beliefs and rules and points to entrepreneurs’ knowledge background, such as their memberships in industry associations and working experiences in universities and state-owned firms. Entrepreneurs’ knowledge background is crucial to obtain venture capital (Rajan, 2012), because most entrepreneurial firms lack financial records, generate negative profits in the early stage, or even has only ideas. If their knowledge background is solid, entrepreneurs are able to sell their ideas in the negotiation with venture capitalists. Thus, entrepreneurs’ knowledge background is conducive to venture capital financing.  \n\nOne aspect of entrepreneurs′ knowledge background is their memberships in informal corporate cooperation network organizations, such as industry associations, chambers of commerce and industrial clusters. Those organizations gather companies in a formal or informal manner and aim to promote the development of enterprises and resources (Zhang and Li, 2010; Doner and Schneider, 2000). Being members of industry associations, entrepreneurs can advance their understandings of the current situations and prospects of the industry. By joining in those social organizations, entrepreneurs are able to establish relationships and share knowledge with other entrepreneurs and investors through mutual communications.  \n\nAnother aspect of entrepreneurs’ knowledge background is their working experiences in universities and state-owned firms. Entrepreneurs with working experiences in universities might have obtained professional knowledge in specific fields. Alternatively, if entrepreneurs have working experiences in state-owned firms, they may have acquired management skills and been aware of standard working system and corporate culture. Those professional knowledge and management skills are also important to manage start-ups. Such knowledge background might be attractive to venture capitalists, particularly when entrepreneurs promote their ideas to investors.  \n\nWe thus contend that the cognitive social capital affects the financing decision through the knowledge mechanism. First, it reduces costs of transferring information and knowledge from entrepreneurs to venture capitalists. According to McPherson et al. (2001), the cognitive social capital enables entrepreneurs to establish common languages and values with investors. A common vision between entrepreneurs and investors can improve their capabilities of sharing and utilizing resources. Second, the cognitive social capital builds credibility and facilitates knowledge transferring (Maurer and Ebers, 2006). The creditability and knowledge transferring between entrepreneurs and investors can alleviate investors’ concerns and reduce ventures’ uncertainty to some extent. Third, a common cognition shared by entrepreneurs and investors is likely to create intellectual capital (Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998). That is,entrepreneurs with greater knowledge are likely to establish knowledge-intensive firms, which are attractive to venture capitalists, especially those who are experts in high-tech investments. When they share common knowledge or understanding in specific fields, entrepreneurs and venture capitalists are likely to agree on investments. In knowledge-intensive industries, the common knowledge is particularly important in negotiations between entrepreneurs and VCs. Thus, we further contend that entrepreneurs’ cognitive social capital imposes a more significant effect in knowledge-intensive industries.  \n\nCollectively, the second hypothesis is stated as follows:  \n\nHypothesis 2. Entrepreneurs’ cognitive social capital positively affects the financing negotiation with VCs through the knowledge mechanism.  \n\n#### 2.3.3. Relational social capital and the trust mechanism  \n\nThe relational social capital indicates entrepreneurs’ personal relationships developed in a history of interactions with others (Granovetter, 1992), mainly about their resources and capabilities generated through personal networks. An interchangeable term is guanxi, which refers to close relationships and exchange of mutual business favors in Confucianism societies, such as China (Lee et al., 2001). Thus, guanxi can be used to indicate the relational social capital in China (Shao and Pan,2019).  \n\nAmong the relational social capital or guanxi, entrepreneurs’ personal relationships with financial and governmental institutions may affect their financing activities profoundly. Specifically, entrepreneurs holding guanxi with financial institutions are able to obtain bank loans and venture capital, even when they have few collateral assets and financial records. Similarly, having guanxi with the government, entrepreneurs are likely to gain more opportunities and preferential policies of receiving bank capital. For example, Faccio (2006) finds that political connections enable firms to obtain bank capital, suggesting a low demand for venture capital. Li et al. (2008) document that the political relationship affects firms' financing strategy and brings financing convenience in the process of obtaining guarantees.  \n\nBy establishing political relations and relations with financial institutions, entrepreneurs are able to resolve the financing difficulty confronted by their start-ups. Specifically, entrepreneurs can establish political relations by participating in the National (provincial, city, county or district) People's Congress in China. They can further build a strong guanxi with state-owned banks and thus have more opportunities to access bank capital (Bai, Lu, & Tao, 2006; Le & Nguyen, 2009), because political authorities can vouch for entrepreneurs’ creditworthiness and reliability (Zhou, 2009). Alternatively, entrepreneurs can build guanxi with financial institutions in some ways. For example, entrepreneurs might have been employed by financial institutions or investment companies, or they might have invested in financial institutions or hired senior executives with financial backgrounds. Such relationships alleviate the information asymmetry between financial institutions and entrepreneurial firms and provide implicit credit guarantees in financing for those firms.  \n\nWe note that the foundation of the relational social capital is trust and reciprocity between entrepreneurs and investors in social networks. Trust personalizes others’ preferences and motivations and expects to reduce investors’ concerns about opportunism and moral hazard behaviors (Gennaioli et al., 2015). Reciprocity means mutually beneficial behavior based on equal status and personal trust (Hwang and Kim, 2009). A trustworthy relationship can be shaped by frequent communications between entrepreneurs and investors and by their common personalities. Grounded on trust, the relational social capital facilitates the transfer of novel information within a relatively closed group and creates business opportunities. As a result, the relational social capital enables entrepreneurs and venture capitalists to act in concert. We thus hypothesize that the relational social capital or guanxi affects venture capital financing through the trust mechanism.  \n\nThe hypothesis suggests that the relational social capital affects the financing results conditional on trust, either generalized or personalized trust (Knack and Keefer, 1997). Generalized trust refers to the preconceptions that people in one identifiable group have for people in other identifiable groups, where the groups are mainly formed by rules and institutional constraints. Personalized trust is character-based, concerning the evolving relationship between two specific agents. While generalized trust is exogenous to specific micro-economic transactions, personalized trust is endogenous (Bottazzi et al., 2016). We thus maintain that each type of trust moderates the effects of the relational social capital.  \n\nSpecifically, when the generalized trust is high, the trust mechanism of entrepreneurs’ relational social capital becomes less significant. The generalized trust by regions is similar to the social trust environment, which is a universal social psychological state. It reflects the group consciousness, organizational trust interaction, mutual influence and cohesion. Thus, the generalized trust becomes an indispensable public morality to realize cooperation and reciprocity within and between social groups. The higher is the generalized trust, it is more likely for entrepreneurs and vCs to cooperate and reciprocate. Moreover, entrepreneurs are more likely to abide by their commitments in regions of high trust, reducing potential risks arising from the information asymmetry and opportunism (Niu, 2010).  \n\nSimilarly, the personalized trust also negatively moderates the effects of the relational social capital. Collewaert (2012) highlights the importance of the specific character-based trust in the relationships between entrepreneurs and investors, especially when they pursue longterm benefits from transactions. Among their characters, reputation represents entrepreneurs’ ability and prestige. It is one of the sources of trust (Herzig et al., 2010) and positively correlated with trust (Kollock, 1994). Reputation-based trust is crucial in financing negotiations, because it alleviates the information asymmetry and increases the trust between entrepreneurs and VCs. When entrepreneurs’ reputation is high, VCs are more likely to trust them and agree on the investments, suggesting that the trust mechanism of entrepreneurs’relational social capital becomes less significant.  \n\nCollectively, the third hypothesis is thus stated as follows.  \n\nHypothesis 3. Entrepreneurs’ relational social capital positively affects the financing negotiation with VCs through the trust mechanism.  \n\n#### 2.3.4. Combinations of three dimensions  \n\nHaving discussed the impact of each dimension of social capital independently, we now consider the combinations of the three dimensions. The three dimensions of social capital are likely to be interrelated in complex ways. In fact, each dimension of social capital builds on or affects other dimensions (Butler and Purchase, 2008). For example, the structural social capital is often regarded as the basic or essential form of social capital that provides channels for entrepreneurs to get access to all resources (Burt, 1992). It is thus the origin of the relational and cognitive social capital. The structural social capital alone, however, is not sufficient to affect the venture capital financing result. In other words, although the structural social capital may affect the access to venture capital, as stated in Hypothesis 1, it may not directly impact the financing result. The structural social capital, together with or through the other two dimensions of social capital, indirectly impact the venture capital financing result, leading to the fourth hypothesis below.  \n\nWe first consider the combination of the structural and relational social capital. As mentioned in the previous subsection, the relational social capital is based on the trust and reciprocity between entrepreneurs and investors in social networks, reducing venture capitalists' concerns about the opportunism and moral hazard behavior (Gennaioli et al., 2015). Thus, the relational social capital can reduce monitoring costs and facilitate knowledge flows to some extent. When VCs are more concerned about the information asymmetry, the relational social capital, together with the structural social capital, can impose a significant effect on the financing result.  \n\nWe then turn our attention to the combination of the structural and cognitive social capital. The cognitive social capital provides a type of knowledge that is difficult to be transferred and copied by competitors (Szulanski, 1996). It creates competitive advantages and excess returns to entrepreneurs and VCs. It also places firms in advantageous positions to undertake initiative actions that without such knowledge are considered risky. The cognitive social capital increases not only the propensity for entrepreneurs to obtain venture capital financing but also their ability to initiate negotiations with VCs especially on projects with high uncertainty. Thus, when VCs are more concerned about uncertainty, the combination of the structural and cognitive social capital significantly affects the financing result.  \n\nPutting together, we propose the fourth hypothesis as follows.  \n\nHypothesis 4. When information asymmetry is severe, the combination of the structural and relational social capital significantly affects venture capital financing. When uncertainty is high, the combination of the structural and cognitive social capital significantly affects venture capital financing.  \n\n## 3. Empirical design  \n\n### 3.1. Sample and data  \n\nTo test the hypotheses developed from the conceptual model, we use the data from China. Our sample begins with all listed companies on the Growth Enterprises Market Board (GEM) in China over the period of 2009-2015. After we remove companies with incomplete information of entrepreneurs, our sample contains 431 companies, of which 250 companies are backed by venture capital and 181 companies are not. The number of firms by IPO years is displayed in Table 1.  \n\nThe financial data of those firms are downloaded from the China Stock Market & Accounting Research (CSMAR) database. Data of entrepreneurs’ social capital are hand-collected from their resumes in the WIND database, which is provided by a China's financial information services company. Data of venture capital investments are retrieved from the ChinaVenture database, which is supported by the China's equity investment market information service company.  \n\n### 3.2.Variable measurement  \n\n#### 3.2.1. Dependent variable  \n\nAlthough the most concerning variables are related to the venture capital financing process, we are unable to obtain the detailed data. Instead, we measure the venture capital financing result, from which we can somehow infer the financing process. Thus, the venture capital financing result is measured by a dummy variable, VC, which is equal to one if entrepreneurial firms are invested by venture capital and zero otherwise. If VC equals one, our inference is that the financing decision goes through the three stages. If VC equals zero, we can infer that the financing process stops in the first two stages.  \n\nTable1 The number of firms in the sample by IPO year. This table reports the number of firms in the sample in each year over the period of 2009-2015. The firms are grouped into venture capital (VC) backed and non-venture capital (Non-VC) backed, respectively reported in the second and third column. The last column reports the total number of firms in each year.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>IPO years</td><td>VC</td><td>Non-VC</td><td>ALL</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>22</td><td>12</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>60</td><td>53</td><td>113</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>61</td><td>56</td><td>117</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>49</td><td>26</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>27</td><td>19</td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>31</td><td>15</td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td>total</td><td>250</td><td>181</td><td>431</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n#### 3.2.2. Independent variables  \n\nHow to measure social capital is one of the most difficult tasks. Previous literature propose four measurement methods, namely, name generator, position generator, resource-based method, and networkbased method. Specifically, the method of name generator requires respondents to fill in names of whom they have exchanged resources in the past or will exchange resources in the future. The method of position generator emphasizes individuals’ network location, assuming that the location determines how much resources one can obtain from the social network. The resource-based method mainly concerns the resources one can obtain. Finally, the network-based method refers to network characteristics. Among the four methods, the method of position generator relies on entrepreneurs’public information, while the other three methodsrequirequestionnaires.  \n\nConsidering data availability and objectivity, we employ the method of position generator to measure social capital. To measure the structural dimension, we use network ties and configuration related to entrepreneurs' work experiences, as in Florin et al. (2003). Specifically, we use three variables, which are job position, working years, and the number of firms entrepreneurs have worked for. The job position (position) refers to the highest position that the entrepreneur held before the establishment of his firm. We assign 4 points to the chairman position, 3 points to the vice chairman position, 2 points to the manager position, 1 point to the staff position 1 point, and 0 point to others. Working years (workyear) is computed as the number of years that the entrepreneur has worked before establishing his firm. The number of firms (firmnumber) refers to the number of companies that the entrepreneur has worked for before founding his firm.  \n\nTo measure the cognitive dimension, we use shared goals and common culture related to entrepreneurs’ institutions and positions. Specifically, we measure the cognitive social capital by entrepreneurs' working experiences in state-owned firms, universities and industry associations. A dummy variable (soe) takes the value of one if entrepreneurs maintain working experiences in state-owned enterprises or research institutes, and zero otherwise. A dummy variable (university) is equal to one if entrepreneurs have working experiences in universities, and zero otherwise. A dummy variable (association) is equal to one if entrepreneurs are members of industry associations, and zero otherwise.  \n\nFinally, we use political and financial guanxi to measure the relational dimension. Political guanxi (guanxi) is a dummy variable indicating whether entrepreneurs are members of the National (provincial or city or county or district) People's Congress in China. Financial guanxi or working experiences in financial institutions (fininst) indicate whether or not entrepreneurs have working experiences in financial institutions. Note that Chinese guanxi is a variant of social capital, pointing to interpersonal relationships based on mutual trust, affection and reciprocity (Yang, 2002). guanxi is intrinsically hierarchical and a power relationship, while most forms of social capital are horizontal. The vertical feature of guanxi makes its political influence more important (Hou and Zhu, 2020).  \n\nWe also define two dummy variables of social capital, cogn and rela. cogn is equal to one if entrepreneurs have none-zero cognitive social capital and rela is equal to one if they have none-zero relational social capital. In addition, we construct four dummy variables to indicate four groups of entrepreneurs, which are x, y, Z, and q. z equals one if entrepreneurs hold the structural social capital only. y equals one if entrepreneurs hold both the structural and relational social capital. x takes the value of one if entrepreneurs hold both the structural and cognitive social capital. Finally, q is equal to one if entrepreneurs hold all three dimensions of social capital.  \n\n#### 3.2.3. Moderating variables  \n\nWe test the two mechanisms related to the cognitive and relational social capital by two moderating variables, knowledge and trust. Specifically, we create a dummy variable (know) to measure knowledge. It takes a value of one if a firm belongs to knowledge-intensive industries and zero otherwise, consistent with the OECD report. We measure trust by two variables. The generalized trust (trustl) is measured at the province level by the questionnaire survey, which is conducted by Zhang and Ke (2002) on the trustworthiness of enterprises in various regions through the ‘Chinese Entrepreneur Survey System’ in 20oo.4 The character-based trust (trust2) is measured by the honorary titles awarded to entrepreneurs, including National Model Workers, Technological Innovation Awards, and Outstanding Entrepreneurs in China. Those titles reveal entrepreneurs’ quality, management ability, and social influence. trust2 takes a value of one if entrepreneurs receive one of the three awards and zero otherwise.  \n\nNote that we are unable to test the information mechanism by this method, because the structural dimension is the foundation of the other two dimensions and only indirectly affect the financing result. Besides, all entrepreneurs in our sample hold the structural social capital.  \n\n#### 3.2.4. Control variables  \n\nWe consider a battery of control variables. As human capital impacts financing choices, we control for entrepreneurs’ education and founding experiences. Entrepreneurs’ education is classified into PhD degree counting 5 points, master degree counting 4 points, bachelor degree counting 3 points, high school graduation counting 2 points, and others counting 1 point. The founding variable is an indicator, equal to one if entrepreneurs have founded other companies before and zero otherwise. Following Winton and Yerramilli (2008) and Rossi et al. (2016), we control for P/E ratio, firm size, age, region, leverage, ROA, and industry in the regressions. Specifically, P/E ratio is the ratio of price to earnings per share. Leverage is computed as the ratio of total debt to the total market capitalization in the IPO year. ROA is computed as operating profits divided by total assets in the IPO year. Firm size is the logarithm of registered capital. Firm age is defined as the number of years from the establishment to IPO. Finally, we use two dummy variables to control for firms' region and industry. We control for firms’ geographical location, because Cumming (2005) and Wu et al.(2012) find that firms' geographical location affects venture capital financing. We define region as an indicator variable, equal to one if companies are located in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, which are the most developed cities in China. Industry is classified by the guidelines for industry classification issued by the China Securities Regulatory Commission in 2001, including utility, business, real estate and synthesis industries. All variables are defined in Appendix.  \n\n### 3.3. Regression models  \n\nTo test the hypotheses, we apply the following logistic regression models. As the venture capital financing process is conceptually divided into three unobservable stages, we test the financing result instead, which enables us to infer the process. Logistic regressions describe the propensity of receiving venture capital financing. Eqs. (1), (2a), (2b), (3a), (3b) and (4) test hypothesis 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{V C=a_{1}+\\beta_{1}p o s i l i o n+\\beta_{2}w o r k y e a r+\\beta_{3}f t r m u u m b e r+c o n t r o l s+}}\\ {{}}\\ {{V C=a_{2}+\\beta_{4}s o e+\\beta_{5}u n i v e r s i t y+\\beta_{6}a s s o c i a t i o n+c o n t r o l s+e_{2}}}\\ {{}}\\ {{V C=a_{2}^{'}+\\beta_{4}^{'}c o g n+\\beta_{5}^{'}k n o w+\\beta_{6}^{'}c o g n^{*}k n o w+c o n t r o l s+e_{2}^{'}}}\\ {{}}\\ {{V C=a_{3}+\\beta_{7}g u a n x i+\\beta_{8}f n i n s t+c o n t r o l s+e_{3}}}\\ {{}}\\ {{V C=a_{3}^{'}+\\beta_{7}r e l a+\\beta_{8}^{'}t r u s t+\\beta_{9}^{'}r e l a^{*}t r u s t+c o n t r o l s+e_{3}}}\\ {{}}\\ {{V C=a_{4}^{'}+\\beta_{1}r\\left(d\\beta_{1}^{'}\\right)+\\beta_{1}r e l a^{*}t r u s t+c o n t r o l s+e_{3}}}\\ {{}}\\ {{V C=a_{4}+\\beta_{3}x+\\beta_{10}^{'}+\\beta_{1}z+\\beta_{12}q+c o n t r o l s+e_{4}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n## 4. Empirical results  \n\n### 4.1. Descriptive statistics  \n\nTable 2 reports the descriptive statistics of the main variables for 250 VC backed firms, 181 non-VC backed firms and the whole sample firms, respectively. Specifically, the means of guanxi and fininst are 0.239 and 0.084 among VC backed firms, and 0.228 and 0.067 among non-VC backed firms, suggesting that $23.9\\%$ $(22.8\\%)$ entrepreneurs among VC (Non-VC) backed firms are members of the National (provincial or city or county or district) People's Congress in China and that $8.4\\%$ $(6.7\\%)$ entrepreneurs among VC (Non-VC) backed firms have working experiences in financial institutions. The means of soe, university and association indicate that $35.9\\%$ $(22.2\\%)$ ， $17.9\\%$ $(11.1\\%)$ and $39.8\\%$ $(31.7\\%)$ entrepreneurs among VC (Non-VC) backed firms have working experiences in state-owned firms, universities and industry associations, respectively. In terms of the structural social capital variables, entrepreneurs in VC backed firms used to hold slightly higher job positions (2.586 vs. 2.406), work for less years (14.54 vs.15.76) and in a smaller number of firms (2.55 vs. 2.63) than those in non-VC backed firms. All variables are distributed in reasonable ranges.  \n\n### 4.2. Baseline regression results  \n\nTable 3 presents logistic regression results. In Model (1), we examine the effects of two measures of the relational social capital, guanxi and financial institution. We find that the coefficients on the two variables are insignificant, which implies that the relational social capital alone does not affect the venture financing result.  \n\nIn Model (2), we include three variables of the cognitive social capital into the regression, which are soe, university and industry association. The results show that the soe and association variable are significantly and positively associated with the venture capital financing result, while the coefficients on university is only marginally positive.  \n\nModel (3) examines the three variables of the structural social capital. The results show that entrepreneurs’ previous job position has a positive effect on VC financing, which implies that entrepreneurs who have held higher position are more likely to obtain venture capital financing. The working year and firm number show insignificant effect on the financing result.  \n\nFinally, in Model (4), we include all variables of the social capital into the regression. We find that the three variables of the cognitive social capital are significantly and positively associated with the venture capital financing result. The coefficients of soe, university and association are respectively estimated 0.917 $(\\mathtt{p}<1\\%)$ ，0.669 $\\left(\\mathtt{p}<5\\%\\right)$ and 0.551 $\\left(\\mathtt{p}<5\\%\\right)$ .We also find that the three variables of the structural social capital affect the venture capital financing result in different directions. Specifically, entrepreneurs′ previous job position positively impacts venture capital financing result, with a coefficient of 0.154 $\\left(\\mathtt{p}<\\right.$ $10\\%$ , whereas entrepreneurs’ working year and the number of firms they served for negatively affect the venture capital financing result, whose coefficients are estimated to -0.044 $(\\mathtt{p}<1\\%)$ and $-0.152(\\mathtt{p}<$ $5\\%$ . The relational social capital, however, shows insignificant effect, which is consistent with Model (1).  \n\nThe results suggest that the structural and cognitive social capital significantly impact the venture capital financing result, probably because the access and negotiation stages are at the core of the financing process, supporting hypotheses 1 and 2. On the contrary, the relational social capital alone shows no impact on the financing result, implying that the financing result is less likely determined at the action stage.  \n\nIn terms of control variables, we find that size and age have significant coefficients. The bigger-sized or younger firms are more likely to be invested by venture capitalists. Other control variables show insignificant impact on the venture capital financing result.  \n\nTable2 Descriptive statistics. This table reports the mean, median and standard deviations of main variables respectively for the 250 vC backed firms, 181 non-VC backed firms and the whole sample of 431 firms. Specifically, the relational social capitalis measured by guanxi and fininst, where guanxi indicates whether or not entrepreneurs are members of the National (provincial or city or county or district) People's Congress in China, and fininst indicates whether entrepreneurs have working experiences in financial institutions. The cognitive social capital is measured by soe, university and asociations, respectively indicating whether or not entrepreneurs have working experiences in state-owned firms, universities and industry associations. The structural social capital is measured by position, workyear, and firmnumber, where position indicates the highest job position entrepreneurs used to hold before establishing their firms, workyear and firmnumber indicate the number of years or firms entrepreneurs worked for before establishing their firms. Entrepreneurs' education and founding characteristics respectively measure their education level and firm founding experiences. P/E ratio is the ratio of price to earnings per share. Leverage (or market leverage) is computed as the ratio of total debt to the total market capitalization in the IPO year. ROA is defined as operating profits divided by total assets in IPO year. Firm size is the logarithm of registered capital. Firm age is defined as the years from the establishment to IPo.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"3\">VC (251)</td><td colspan=\"3\">Non-VC (180)</td><td colspan=\"3\">ALL (431)</td></tr><tr><td>Variable</td><td>Mean</td><td>Sd</td><td>Median</td><td>Mean</td><td>Sd</td><td>Median</td><td>Mean</td><td>PS</td><td>Median</td></tr><tr><td>guanxi</td><td>0.239</td><td>0.427</td><td>0</td><td>0.228</td><td>0.421</td><td>0</td><td>0.234</td><td>0.424</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>fininst</td><td>0.084</td><td>0.277</td><td>0</td><td>0.067</td><td>0.250</td><td>0</td><td>0.077</td><td>0.266</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>soe</td><td>0.359</td><td>0.481</td><td>0</td><td>0.222</td><td>0.417</td><td>0</td><td>0.302</td><td>0.459</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>university</td><td>0.179</td><td>0.384</td><td>0</td><td>0.111</td><td>0.315</td><td>0</td><td>0.151</td><td>0.358</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>association</td><td>0.398</td><td>0.491</td><td>0</td><td>0.317</td><td>0.466</td><td>0</td><td>0.364</td><td>0.482</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>position</td><td>2.586</td><td>1.367</td><td>3</td><td>2.406</td><td>1.425</td><td>2</td><td>2.510</td><td>1.392</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>workyear</td><td>14.538</td><td>8.275</td><td>14</td><td>15.756</td><td>8.390</td><td>14</td><td>15.046</td><td>8.336</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>firmnumber</td><td>2.546</td><td>1.583</td><td>2</td><td>2.628</td><td>2.222</td><td>2</td><td>2.580</td><td>1.875</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>education</td><td>3.430</td><td>0.933</td><td>4</td><td>3.358</td><td>0.976</td><td>4</td><td>3.400</td><td>0.951</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>founding</td><td>0.120</td><td>0.440</td><td>0</td><td>0.072</td><td>0.335</td><td>0</td><td>0.100</td><td>0.400</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>P/E</td><td>61.516</td><td>36.061</td><td>51.890</td><td>61.284</td><td>32.623</td><td>54.260</td><td>61.419</td><td>34.628</td><td>53.370</td></tr><tr><td>leverage</td><td>0.170</td><td>0.118</td><td>0.139</td><td>0.162</td><td>0.121</td><td>0.124</td><td>0.167</td><td>0.119</td><td>0.132</td></tr><tr><td>ROA</td><td>0.067</td><td>0.026</td><td>0.063</td><td>0.067</td><td>0.029</td><td>0.065</td><td>0.067</td><td>0.027</td><td>0.064</td></tr><tr><td>size</td><td>18.278</td><td>0.426</td><td>18.198</td><td>18.200</td><td>0.451</td><td>18.178</td><td>18.245</td><td>0.438</td><td>18.198</td></tr><tr><td>age</td><td>10.637</td><td>4.757</td><td>10</td><td>10.589</td><td>4.943</td><td>10</td><td>10.617</td><td>4.830</td><td>10</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n### 4.3. Moderating impacts  \n\nTo further examine the knowledge mechanism of the cognitive social capital and the trust mechanism of the relational social capital, we run logistic regressions with two moderating variables, know and trust. We do not examine the information mechanism of the structural social capital, which is indistinguishable among entrepreneurs, because the structural social capital is the foundation of the other two dimensions of social capital and only indirectly affects the financing result.  \n\nThe results testing the two mechanisms are reported in Table 4. In Model (1), we include the cognitive social capital, know and their interactive term into the regression. The results show that the coefficient on the cognitive social capital is significant ( $\\mathrm{\\Delta}\\mathrm{\\Theta}=0.626$ $\\mathbf{p}<5\\%$ , which is consistent with the baseline results in Table 3. The interactive term also has a significantly positive coefficient $(\\upbeta=0.813$ $\\mathtt{p}<10\\%$ ,suggesting that the impact of the cognitive social capital is intensified in knowledge-intensive industries. In other words, the impact is more significant among firms belonging to knowledge-intensive industries, supporting the knowledge mechanism of the cognitive social capital.  \n\nModels (2) and (3) test the trust mechanism. In Model (2), we include the relational social capital, generalized trust (trustl) and their interactive term into the regression and find that the coefficient on the interactive term is negative and significant $\\langle\\upbeta=-0.064$ ， $\\mathtt{p}<5\\%)$ . In Model (3), we replace the generalized trust with entrepreneurs’ reputation (trust2)and find that thecoefficient on theinteractive termis still negative and significant $\\mathrm{\\Delta}\\mathrm{\\zeta}\\beta=-1.020$ ， $\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{p}}<5\\%$ . The negative coefficients on the two interactive terms suggest that the impact of the relational social capital becomes less significant in regions of high trust or when personal trust is high, supporting the trust mechanism of the relational social capital.  \n\n### 4.4. Heterogeneity of entrepreneurs’ social capital  \n\nTo examine the heterogeneity of entrepreneurs’ social capital, we split entrepreneurs into four groups: entrepreneurs holding the structural social capital only $\\mathbf{\\check{z}}=1\\mathbf{\\check{\\rho}}$ 0, entrepreneurs holding the structural and relational social capital $\\left(\\mathbf{y}=1\\right)$ , entrepreneurs holding the structural and cognitive social capital $(\\mathbf{x}=1\\mathbf{\\dot{\\mu}}.$ 0, and entrepreneurs holding the three dimensions of social capital $(\\mathsf{q}=1)$ 0. Then, we run regressions of the venture capital financing result on each of the four variables along with controlvariables.  \n\nTable 5 presents the regression results. Model (1) shows that entrepreneurs who hold the structural and cognitive social capital are more likely to obtain venture capital financing $(\\upbeta=0.529$ $\\mathrm{~p~}<5\\%$ ,as compared with other three groups. In Models (2) and (3), entrepreneurs holding the structural and relational social capital, or the structural social capital only, show negative coefficients, implying that they do not choose venture capital financing. Finally, in Model (4), entrepreneurs holding the three dimensions of social capital do not distinguish from other groups in choosing venture capital financing.  \n\nAs compared with the results in Table 3, the structural social capital or the cognitive social capital alone does not affect venture capital financing, but they become significant when both are included into the regression. Consistent with the results in Table 3, we find that entrepreneurs holding the structural and cognitive social capital are likely to choose venture capital financing and that entrepreneurs holding the structural social capital only are not.  \n\nThe joint impacts of the structural and cognitive social capital can be explained as follows. The structural social capital determines potential investors and gathers entrepreneurs and venture capitalists in the access stage. It does not necessarily result in successful negotiation, unless the cognitive social capital plays its role through the access to the action stage. Once the structural social capital is controlled, the effect of the cognitive social capital becomes significant, suggesting that the access and negotiation stages together are important in determining the financing result. The structural and cognitive social capital are thus complementary to each other.  \n\nOverall, the cognitive social capital is of great importance in venture capital financing, suggesting that venture capitalists are concerned more about the uncertainty of products or markets than the information asymmetry between entrepreneurs and outsiders, as stated in hypothesis 4. The relational social capital, alone or with other dimensions, does not impose any positive effect on the financing result. The results suggest that venture capitalists are concerned less about the information asymmetry, as stated in hypothesis 4.  \n\nTo further distinguish the four groups of entrepreneurs, we run regressions by adding three out of the four groups each time and present the results in Table 6. In Model (1), when group q is the benchmark,  \n\nTable3 Baseline regression results. This table reports the Logistic regression results of the venture capital financing on the three dimensions of social capital. The dependent variable is a dummy variable (VC), equal to one if firms are financed by venture capital and zero otherwise. The three dimensions of social capital are respectively measured by guanxi and fininst for the relational social capital, soe, university and association for the cognitive social capital, and position, workyear and firmnumber for the structural social capital. Controlling variables include entrepreneurs’ education and firm founding experiences, entrepreneurial firms' P/E ratio (price to earnings per share), leverage ratio, ROA, firm size, and age.

In Model (2), when group z is the benchmark, which is the group of entrepreneurs holding the structural social capital only, groups x and q show significant and superior performance in choosing venture capital, whereas group y is indifferent from the benchmark. In Model (3), the benchmark is set to group y, which is the group of entrepreneurs holding structural and relational social capital, groups x and q perform better than the benchmark again, whereas the performance of group z is indifferent. Finally, we set group $\\mathbf{X}$ as the benchmark in Model (4) and find that groups y and z are inferior to the benchmark and that group q performs similarly to the benchmark. Thus, the group of entrepreneurs holding the structural and cognitive social capital performs as well as the group of entrepreneurs holding the three dimensions of social capital, and outperforms the groups of entrepreneurs holding the structural social capital alone and holding the structural and relational social capital together.  \n\n### 4.5.

This table reports the Logistic regression results testing the moderating effects of knowledge and trust on the relationship between social capital and venture capital financing result. The dependent variable is a dummy variable (VC), equal to one if firms are financed by venture capital and zero otherwise. The cognitive social capital is proxied by a dummy variable (cogn), equal to one if entrepreneurs possess cognitive social capital and zero otherwise. The relational social capital is denoted as a dummy variable (rela), equal to one if entrepreneurs possess relational social capital and zero otherwise. The moderate variable of know takes a value of one if a firm belongs to knowledge-intensive industries and zero otherwise. The moderate variable of trust is measured in two ways. Model (2) employs Trustl, the trust scores at the province level from ‘Chinese Entrepreneur Survey System'. Model (3) employs Trust2, which is entrepreneurs’ reputation.

Discussion  \n\nOur paper makes a couple of contributions. The first one is to the literature of social capital, entrepreneurship and venture capital. This study develops a conceptual model to disentangle how entrepreneurs' social capital affects venture capital financing and empirically test the impact mechanisms.

Despite the growing interests in entrepreneurs’ social capital and venture capital financing, the impact mechanisms have not been fully explained yet. In fact, a majority of those studies have not taken into account of different dimensions of social capital and the dynamic process of venture capital financing at the same time. In this study, we classify entrepreneurs’ social capital into the structural, cognitive and relational dimensions. We explain the impact of each dimension on venture capital financing through the information, knowledge and trust mechanism, respectively. The results imply that each dimension of social capital may also affect other kinds of financing in different manners. For example, the relational social capital, although irrelevant to venture capital financing, may be important to bank financing.5  \n\nThirdly, by studying entrepreneurs’ financing choices towards venture capital, our paper explains the capital structure of entrepreneurial firms. Traditional theories of capital structure apply to mature companies but not start-ups (Robb & Robinson, 2014). The relationship between social capital and start-ups’ capital structure is less-well understood (Dudley, 2020). Our study thus adds to capital structure  \n\n# Table 6  \n\nComparing the impacts of the four groups of entrepreneurs on venture capital financing.

The first implication is that, in addition to physical and human capital, entrepreneurs might consider to establish and maintain social ties, which can benefit their firms especially when they are financially constrained. Second, when entrepreneurs invest into social capital, they might need to balance among different dimensions, because each of the dimensions and their combinations impose different impacts on financing results. Third, entrepreneurs who build solid cognitive social capital are likely to obtain venture capital, because venture capitalists pay more attention to the recognition of entrepreneurs’ knowledge and capability.  \n\n### 5.2.Conclusion  \n\nThis paper examines how entrepreneurs’ social capital facilitates venture capital financing for their start-ups. In doing so, we adopt the classic taxonomy of social capital by Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998) and links each dimension of social capital as well as their combinations to venture capital financing process within a conceptual model. Specifically, we classify entrepreneurs’ social capital into the structural, cognitive and relational dimensions. We then explain their impacts on venture capital financing through three mechanisms, which are the information, knowledge and trust mechanisms. Further, we associate the  \n\nTable 7 Propensity score matched sample analysis. This table reports regression analyses using the propensity score matched sample.

Our main findings are twofold. First, the structural and cognitive social capital positively affects venture capital financing, whereas the relational social capital shows insignificant effect. Second, the combination of the structural and cognitive social capital imposes a significant impact on the financing result. The results suggest that the structural social capital provides an easier access to venture capital and that the cognitive social capital promotes knowledge exchange and cooperation in the negotiation with venture capitalists. Entrepreneurs who hold the structural and cognitive social capital at the same time are more likely to obtain venture capital. Thus, the structural and cognitive social capital play pivotal roles in venture capital financing.  \n\nOur analyses and results can be generalizable to other transition economies and knowledge-intensive economies. In transition economies, featured by immature institutional environment and inefficient market condition, the cognitive social capital is particularly important. Social capital has become increasingly important in knowledgeintensive economies as well (Westlund, 2006). Meanwhile, a majority of entrepreneurial firms are financially constrained as in China. Particularly, entrepreneurs in transition economies are likely confronted with discrimination, weak property rights protection, and financing constraints. Our findings suggest that entrepreneurs’ social capital, as a substitute for collateral, resolves their financing difficulties by channeling venture capital to their entrepreneurial firms.  \n\n### 5.3. Limitations and future directions  \n\nWe have noted several limitations of this study. First is the measurement of social capital. Although we tried our utmost to construct the measurements of social capital, still we admit the discrepancy between the theoretical concept and our measurements. The method of position generator adopted in our study has some shortcomings as well. For example, this method assumes that entrepreneurs holding higher positions obtain more resources. It cannot measure the specific composition of the entrepreneurs’ social network, such as the relationship between network members, the size and density of the network. Thus, we are able to measure only the social capital related to entrepreneurs′ positions and experiences.  \n\nThe second limitation relates to the model of the financing process. As the decision process is not observable, the way we model it into three stages is not the best but only to simplify the analysis. The financing process may vary among entrepreneurial firms. As venture capital provides more than capital resources, entrepreneurs’ financing motivation can be more complicated,6 which calls for a more complicated model.  \n\nThirdly, in the conceptual model and empirical analyses, we are unable to distinguish whether entrepreneurs or venture capitalists lead the financing result. Instead, we treat the financing result as a mutual agreement between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. In fact, using a sample of companies that are able to choose among different financing resources relieves this concern to some extent.  \n\nFinally, because the data of the access and negotiation stages are not available, we cannot fully test the conceptual model. Still, the conceptual model provides a framework, within which we are able to uncover a tip of the iceberg of the venture capital financing process.  \n\nNoting the limitations may provide ideas for future research. If social capital can be measured from different aspects, such as applying different measurement methods, or obtaining more detailed data by questionnaire surveys or interviews, it will be possible and promising to thoroughly examine the effects of social capital on different firm activities, such as bank capital financing and innovation. It will be worthy of examining the interrelationships among different aspects of social capital and their impacts on venture financing. Further, it will be inspiring and interesting if future research extends the conceptual model by including the dynamic interactions between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. In doing so, one can withdraw more realistic hypotheses and advance our understandings of venture financing. Finally, it has been documented that firms holding more social capital tend to have low debt costs (Hasan et al., 2017) and equity costs (Gupta et al., 2018). It thus becomes possible for future research to examine the impact mechanism of different dimension of social capital on other sources of financing.  \n\n## Funding  \n\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71802112).  \n\n## Declaration of Competing Interest  \n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial  \n\n## Acknowledgements  \n\ninterests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.  \n\nWe acknowledge valuable comments from two anonymous referees, Dr. Dimo Dimov at the University of Bath, and Dr. Fuguang Huang at Nankai University.  \n\nAppendix A.

We use OLS and probit regression as well as Weibull distribution of residual values, given its reliability and validity for studying lifetime analysis. Based on a sample of 8722 VC-backed ventures with the first investment dates between 1999 and 2018 in United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK), the results show that the presence of CVCs positively affects the funding amounts and the duration of the investment. CVC funds are more generous and more patient than Independent Venture Capital (IVC) funds regarding their investments in ventures. Moreover, the findings provide evidence that the exit strategies are directly influenced by the funding amounts and the duration of the investment which are influenced, in turn, by the fund type. Greater funding increases the likelihood of IPO exit which is reduced by longer investment duration. Our results are robust to alternative estimation methods, namely twostage treatment-effects regressions. These results help the various stakeholders (VC funds, investors, ventures) make crucial decisions regarding investment amounts and duration, and exit.  \n\nKeywords Corporate Venture Capital $^*$ Independent Venture Capital $.$ Funding Duration $.$ Exit strategies  \n\n# Highlights  \n\nCVCs positively affects the funding amounts and the duration of the investment.  \n\nGreater funding amounts lead to a greater likelihood of an exit through IPO.  \n\nLonger duration reduces the likelihood of IPO exit route.  \n\nInvestment decisions in VC affect the exit strategy.  \n\nCVC-backed ventures receive larger funding amounts.  \n\nVC firms consider the staging decision at each financing round as deciding between investing and delay.  \n\nJEL classification G24·G32·G34  \n\n## 1 Introduction  \n\nVenture capital (VC) is an external means for firm growth and technology development (Ma, 2020). Venture capitalists (VCs) as corporate investors and independent venture capitalists $(\\mathrm{IVCs})^{1}$ decide their funding for a venture to enhance the likelihood of their success (Guo et al., 2015). Non-financial firm pursuit in external privately held entrepreneurial com-- panies direct equity investment defined as corporate venture capital (CVC) as illustrated by Wadhwa et al., (2016) and Yang et al., (2014) for both financial and strategic objectives. The other type is IVC limited partnerships firms that strive for morally financial retrievals as defined by Chemmanur et al. (2014). After the dot.com bubble, the value ofAmerican VC investments peaked in 2018, totalling over 118 billion dollars whereas European VC deal value grew from 7 to 43 billion euros in the last ten years, reaching a new all-time high in 2020 notwithstanding the covid-19 induced macroeconomic volatility.  \n\nA stream of research examines why firms pursue CVC investments and value creation for investing firms (Anokhin et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2014). Existing literature has comparatively analysed the influence of CVC and IVC on ventures performance regarding innovation (Alvarez-Garrido & Dushnitsky, 2016; Shuwaikh & Dubocage, 2022), going public (Ivanov & Xie, 2010) and growth (Bertoni et al., 2013). Nature of funding, as well as decisions regarding investment and duration taken on by VCs, have been shown to have a direct impact on exit strategy choices and on the growth and value of ventures (Guo et al., 2015; Cumming & Johan 2010; Lindstrom, 2006; Cumming & MacIntosh, 2001). These factors ought to be optimised to effectively accomplish a desired goal, depending on the nature of the venture and of the VC. The proposed models state that exit strategies are directly impacted by funding amounts and by investment duration which, in turn, are affected by the investor type (CVC or IVC).  \n\nThis paper aims to answer the research question: Does the CVC financing program impact the investment decisions and the chosen exit strategy? Our results clearly show that staged financing is an effective mechanism for VCs to control risks. Moreover, the findings provide evidence that the exit strategies are directly influenced by the funding amounts and the duration of the investment which are influenced, in turn, by the fund type. Our paper is among a few recent papers to propose a formal model for staged financing in controlling risks in VC by staging investment decisions. Using a dataset of 8622 VC-backed companies between 1999 and 2018, this study seeks to examine different patterns within funding amounts and duration before exit amongst CVC and IVC-backed companies across the US and the UK as well as to analyse the consequent impact on exit strategy decisions undertaken by the correspondent investors.  \n\nThis study has essential approaches contributing to the literature. First, this study expands research stream on investment decisions (Aouni et al., 2013; Archibald & Possani, 2021; Franklin, 2015; Yang et al., 2009). We bring CVC investments and IVC together rather than discussing them independently, and our conclusions validate the notion that the both funding types deliver alternative styles of corporate development and business growth (Keil et al., 2008). These dynamics might influence the choices of small companies to engage in relationships with corporate investors. By doing so, this paper joins the literature regarding acquisitions by investing firms (Benson & Ziedonis, 2009), the likelihood of building investment link between a firm and an entrepreneur (Katila et al., 2008) and the selection entrepreneurs have within CVC and IVC (Maula et al., 2005; Keil et al., 2008) study acquisition and CVC funding as two governance forms by examining their differential impacts on performance consequences. This study adopts a comparative lens to analyze CVC investments and IVC empirically to study the implications of choice between them and to complement research streams (Chemmanur et al., 2014; Shuwaikh & Dubocage 2022).  \n\nSecond, this study joins the comprehensive creek of literature on financing arrangements (Dushnitsky & Shaver, 2009; Katila et al., 2008). As discussed earlier, previous research has emphasized CVC funding role in the evolution of cooperation networks (Dushnitsky & Lavie, 2010) and the value of CVC investments for innovation and learning purposes (Keil et al., 2008; Shuwaikh & Dubocage, 2022). This study improves our perception of external technology sourcing and business growth. Corporate investors need to discover technology displays and innovative growth events apart from developing their potential to examine different techniques effciently. Consequently, the firms invest for a long duration in their CVC-backed companies to acquire different experiences to understand advanced external technology and innovation as a way of initiating their innovation. Essential decisions regarding such investments are critical to creating opportunities for growth (Aouni et al., 2013). This study is in line with previous studies on linkages between acquisition and CVC investments (Capron & Shen, 2007). We highlight the function of CVC investment as real option to achieve acquisitions. Generally, IVCs are interested in liquidity events, so they have concerns about driving companies towards IPOs as quickly as possible. In contrast, corporate investors are principally interested in the acquisition exits mainly if they are interested in the underlying technology in line with our findings and consistent with the literature.  \n\nThe ensuing research has the following structure. Section two presents the literature review contemplating past findings, and section three presents the data retrieval and methodology. Section four presents the results and the discussion; this paper ends with a conclusion and some avenuesforfutureresearch.  \n\n## 2 Theoretical background  \n\n### 2.1 Funding amount  \n\nWith respect to the amount invested, CVC is second only to IVC, in addition to leading other investor groups (Cumming, 2012; Dushnitsky, 2008, 2012; Siegel et al.,1988) find that CVCs and IVCs use similar investment criteria and that CVCs face difficulties in attracting ventures, especially if they operate in an industry that is attractive to the investor. According to Dushnitsky (2012), the current fourth wave of CVC is characterized by a new change in the structure and objectives of corporate investors. At the beginning of the year 2000, the dollar volume of rounds for CVC funding participation exceeded USD 18 billion (Dushnitsky & Shaver, 2009; Gompers & Lerner, 1998a, b; Stuart & Sorenson, 2003). The following examples are enlightening. BlackBerry Partners Fund (CVC) conducted a drive in 2008 for one hundred fifty million dollars in software application ventures. At the beginning of that same year, Apple launched one hundred million dollars by the prominent VC firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. In 2009, Google Ventures (CVC) led a fifteen million dollar investment in a biotech venture (Adimab)(Cumming, 2012; Dushnitsky, 2012).  \n\nDiscrepancies in countries' VC activities are correlated with access to the stock market (Black & Gilson, 1996). Bank-centred capital markets like the UK have a more conservative and sceptic approach to lending and investing which, in turn, results in financial incentives that do not stimulate entrepreneurial activity. Thus, the US's dynamic stock-market-centred capital market presents a direct stimulus to VC activity. In comparison to Europe, the US host a much more liquid and larger market, both in terms of human resources deployed, but also in terms of deal flows for exit markets (Lindstrom, 2006; Schwienbacher, 2005; Cumming & MacIntosh, 2000) and the US's market size and maturity imply that American ventures have easier access to funding (Schwienbacher, 2005). Global Corporate Venturing 2018 report illustrates CVC investors’ view of the power of investment amount from corporate investors. VCs typically provide massive amounts of funding to companies with the potential for rapid growth. However, because investors are wary of investing in companies and innovative companies due to the enormous risks and business costs involved, they expect the supposed interest to be considerably more prominent than the risk. We suggest that corporate investors will help inject additional investments amounts:  \n\nHypothesis 1 CVC-backed ventures will obtain larger funding amounts, when compared to theirIVC-backedcounterparts.  \n\n### 2.2 Duration before exit  \n\nBesides pursuing financial returns, CVCs also seek out strategic benefits on their value chain (Dushnitsky & Lenox, 2005a; Hellmann et al., 2008). CVCs tend to then have lengthier investment horizons than IVCs and portrait an active management role, supporting ventures with R&D and different corporate matters. VCs provide their portfolio companies with monitoring and mentoring services, aiming to add value through shared knowledge and helping ventures succeed by lessening information asymmetries, agency costs, and moral hazard problems (Sahlman, 1990; Cumming & MacIntosh, 2000; Gompers & Lerner,  \n\n2001). Their expertise relates to strategic and value added services such as intellectual property advisory, legal, accounting, technology or marketing services, investors and potential acquirers sourcing, among others (Cumming & Johan, 2010). Still, VC firms are noticeably diverse in the way they are organised, namely in the type of ownership and governance they host (Dimov & Gedajlovic, 2009; Bertoni et al., 2015).  \n\nPrevious studies examine CVC activities via organizational learning theory, and scholars identify CVC as a powerful means to acquire knowledge outside of firm boundaries (Dushnitsky & Lenox, 2005b; Maula et al., 2005). Previous research focuses on the strategic outcomes linked to organizational learning in the CVC setting and identifies corporate knowledge as an inspiration for CVC actions and its powerful function for company performance, as Chesbrough & Tucci (2002) find regarding technology innovation. We expect that the duration of a CVC program is longer than that of an IVC program in firms that seek technology innovation and organizational learning.  \n\nHypothesis 2 CVC-backed ventures will host longer investment durations before exit, when comparedtoIVC-backedfirms.  \n\n### 2.3 Exit strategy  \n\nSuccessful exits, especially IPOs, have been shown to send positive signals to fund investors, delivering reputational benefits to the VC which will, thereupon, increase fund returns and financing (Lindstrom, 2006; Schwienbacher, 2005). As IVCs do not financially depend on a parent company, its additional monetary resources from investors are directly reliant on the signals they transmit to the outside market. This creates a stimulus for IVCs to showcase successful exits (Dushnitsky & Shapira, 2010), which can inadvertently result in IVCs exiting their entrepreneurial firms ahead of the optimal time, incurring in higher discount rates and shorter investment durations (Guo et al., 2015). IPOs tend to be viewed as the premium exit strategy and are associated with greater resource employment by VCs (Schwienbacher, 2005). The most promising ventures, as in the ones with a greater expected value, host a higher likelihood of attempting to go public, whilst an acquisition for a lower expected value (Schwienbacher, 2005, 2008).  \n\nA model proposed by Guo et al. (2015) reasons that larger investments positively correlate with the likelihood of going public whilst prolonged duration directs to lower IPO probability. Accurate information regarding the venture's success results in prolonged durations, reflecting the possibility of an acquisition exit. Notwithstanding, as formerly stated, IPOs have been shown to require more nurturing before going public, leading to larger investments and longer duration before exit (Guo et al., 2015). Past literature concerning the impact of CVC financing on exit strategies has shown conflicting results. CVCs have been suggested to be more likely to exit through an M&A operation due to strategic gains, aiming to avoid competition whilst IVCs were more likely to pursue an IPO, given that they are not associated with a parent company (Maxin, 2018). Furthermore, IVCs host a sharp focus on financial and reputational gains, leading to a preference for an IPO exit. Nevertheless, CVCs have been shown to have a stronger tendency to exit through an IPO given that the marginal effect from ventures? innovation productivity decreases throughout investment time (Chemmanur et al., 2014; Gompers & Lerner 1998a, b).  \n\nHypothesis a: Larger investment amounts before exit increase IPO exit.  \n\nHypothesis b: Prolonged duration before exit decrease the likelihood of anIPO  \n\n## 3 Methodology  \n\n### 3.1 Sample and data  \n\nThe study dataset comprises 8622 US and UK formerly VC-backed firms with first investment date between the 1999 and 2018. The correspondent data regarding VC activity was retrieved from Thomson One private equity database. This database encompasses firm, investors, and funds' characteristics inherent to each venture. It considers a range of investor types but, in line with previous literature, only CVC and IVC investors were filtered for the purpose of this research. Data was retrieved for formerly VC-backed firms (headquartered in the USA or UK) which have exited through an IPO, acquisition, or Write-Off and whose first investment date lies between the 1999 and 2018. This data frame was chosen to take into account the impact of the financial crisis besides the dot.com bubble on investment and exit decisions. Also, we pick 1999 to be our study year as it resembles CVC funding growth between investors and their backed ventures (Dushnitsky and Lenox, 2006) as well as the beginning of the fourth wave of CVC investments (Dushnitsky, 2012). As company names appeared differently across databases, Tickers and Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes were manually extracted from Compustat-Capital IQ. As common in VC literature, we exclude from our sample the financial firms? in order to avoid biases (Bayar & Chemmanur, 2012). Financial data was retrieved from Compustat-Capital IQ and historical industry and stock market information was respectively retrieved from Damodaran Online and from the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) database. We use PATSTAT database, European Patent Office (EPO), to get Patent data. After merging and clearing data from different sources, the final dataset consisted of a cross sectional data sample at company level of 8622 US and UK VC-backed ventures with first investment date between 1999 and 2018.  \n\n### 3.2 Variables description  \n\n#### 3.2.1 Dependent variables  \n\nAs a combination of existing literature, this study analyses three dependent variables focused on funding amount, investment duration and exit strategy (Guo et al., 2015; Schwienbacher 2005; Cumming & MacIntosh, 2000). We operationalize the dependent variables as follows:  \n\nFunding amount the total amount, in millions of US dollars, raised by the company, pondered by the number of rounds it has raised.  \n\nDuration (m) difference, in months, between first investment date in the venture and exit date.  \n\nIPO dummy variable taking the value of 1 when the companies exits through an IPO, and Ootherwise.  \n\n#### 3.2.2 Independent variables  \n\nIn order to understand the power of financing nature on the dependent variables, three variations of CVC financing variables were constructed and independently studied on each model. They are proxied as follows:  \n\nCVC Is a dummy variable that takes the value of one if there is one CVC investor or more backing the company, and O if the company is totally IVC-backed.  \n\n$C V C\\_I s t$ Is a dummy variable that takes the value of one when the first round raised by the venture contains a CVC investor, and O otherwise. As we hypothesise that CVCs provide a quality certification to ventures, this variable is constructed aiming to assess if having earlyon CVC funding magnifies results.  \n\n$\\%C V C$ This variable is a proxy for the involvement of CVC funds in the total VC funds that the company receives (Masulis & Nahata, 2009). This variable was constructed as a proxy for CVC participation in investment.  \n\n#### 3.2.3 Contro variables  \n\nFollowing the literature, we add control variables to address confounding factors that could predict funding amount, duration, and exit strategies undertaken by ventures. The variable #Funds translates the total number of investment funding in the venture as syndication may raise the potential value provided to a venture but lessen the individual effort provided by VCs, impacting funding and duration (Cumming & Johan, 2010; Dushnitsky & Shapira, 2010; Lindstrom, 2006; Cumming, 2006; Schwienbacher, 2005). Fund Size comprises the average size of the funds invested in a venture and #Rounds translates the number of funding rounds the venture has raised. Older funds are linked to a higher degree of resources, expertise and reputation which can affect funding amount, duration, and undertaken exit strategies (Bertoni et al., 2015; Schwienbacher, 2005, 2008). Thus, as a proxy for experience and expertise, VC Age captures the average age at date of investment, in years, across a venture's invested funds. The dummy variable Early_Istlnv equals one if the venture's funding is at early stages (Guo et al., 2015; Cumming & Johan 2010).  \n\nAs $41\\%$ of the sampled ventures belong to the Business Services Industry $\\mathrm{(SIC=73}$ the dummy variable Business Services equals 1 when the venture belongs to this industry, and O otherwise, in an effort to avoid industry-driven results. Likewise, the dummy variable  \n\nHigh Tech, combining methodologies of Saxenian & Societies (1996) and Markusen (1994), equals 1 if the venture's SIC code starts by 28, 357, 481, or 737, and 0 otherwise. Following Guo et al., (2015) and Cumming & Johan (2010), the variable MSCI Index controls for the stock market performance of each studied country, 3 months before the venture's exit, as potential exit valuations might be driven by market conditions. Following Guo et al., (2015) on the rationale that investment is driven by industries’ extra cash and liquidity, AvgWC measures the average working capital available in the venture's industry 5 years before first investment date, as a representation of accounting liquidity. Similarly, AvgNETCF captures the average net cash-flow in an industry, as a proxy for extra available cash in a specific industry.  \n\nOverall investment amounts sharply decline after the year 2ooo. Following Cumming & Johan (2010), the dummy variable Bubble_1stlnv is constructed to control for companies whose first investment occurred during the dot.com tech bubble. The dummy takes on the value of 1 if first investment happened either in 1999 or 2000, and 0 otherwise. Following the same logic, two dummy variables (FCrisis_IstInv, and FCrisis_Exit) are introduced, aiming to control for the Financial Crisis distressed times (years 2008 and 2009).  \n\nTo decrease the endogeneity of matters in which CVCs are experts, such as choosing superior companies over IVCs and funding further R&D plans, we added the control variable patent stock, as a representative of that company's character and innovativeness (Chemmanur et al., 2014). We use the patent stock for measuring the quality of the funded company. This is a proxy of the quality ofthe company and a step to eliminate the endogeneity concern. Following Blundell et al., (1995), patent stock is the number of all patents at a depreciatingrate $\\uplambda$ of $30\\%$ at time (t).  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{PatentStock}_{i t}=\\ln(p a t e n t s)_{i t}+(1-\\delta)P a t e n t S t o c k_{i t}\n$$  \n\nFinally, and following Shuwaikh & Dubocage (2022) we construct industry relatedness, to represent the percentage of similarity in the partners′ sectors. using Kenneth French 17 industries classification. A full description of all variables used in this research is available on AppendixB.  \n\n## 4 Empirical results  \n\n### 4.1 Descriptive statistics and correlations  \n\nTable 1 delivers descriptive statistics of our variables. The sample is composed of 8622 companies, of which $83\\%$ are located in US. In our sample, 3017 companies $(35\\%)$ are financed by CVCs. 862 companies ( $10\\%$ of the whole sample) had early-on CVC funding. Their first-round funding contains a CVC investor. On average, the CVC fund amount invested in a company represents $7\\%$ of the total VC funds. The sample average investment amount is USD 35.07 million. The average of the syndicate size i.e. funds number at the investment date is 5. On average, the number of funding rounds a venture raised is 4. Moreover, $24\\%$ of the companies have IPO exit.  \n\nTable 2 reports the matrix of correlation of our variables. The correlation between investment amount and CVC is 0.16, and that between investment duration and CVC is 0.12. The correlation between the investment amount and duration is -0.04 mitigating the concern of the highly correlated main variables. The correlations among the variables in our models are relatively small and below the critical value of 0.8, which suggests that multicollinearity is not likely to be an issue in our multivariate tests.  \n\nTable 1 — Descriptive Statistics   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"7\">Full Sample</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>N</td><td>Mean</td><td>Median</td><td>Std.Dev.</td><td>Min</td><td>Max</td></tr><tr><td>USA</td><td>8622</td><td>0.83</td><td>1</td><td>0.23</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>CVC</td><td>8622</td><td>0.35</td><td>0</td><td>0.33</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>CVC_1st</td><td>8622</td><td>0.10</td><td>0</td><td>0.20</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>%CVC</td><td>8622</td><td>0.07</td><td>0</td><td>0.23</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Funding Amount (million)</td><td>8622</td><td>35.07</td><td>6.57</td><td>37.67</td><td>0</td><td>2295</td></tr><tr><td>Duration (months)</td><td>8622</td><td>68.38</td><td>61</td><td>42.25</td><td>0</td><td>246</td></tr><tr><td>IPO</td><td>8622</td><td>0.24</td><td>0</td><td>0.32</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Merger</td><td>8622</td><td>0.81</td><td>1</td><td>0.39</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>#Rounds</td><td>8622</td><td>3.95</td><td>3</td><td>2.96</td><td>1</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>#Funds</td><td>8622</td><td>5.34</td><td>5</td><td>4.65</td><td>1</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Fund Size</td><td>8622</td><td>415.72</td><td>246.67</td><td>905.02</td><td>0</td><td>22,887</td></tr><tr><td>VCAge</td><td>8622</td><td>3.58</td><td>3.13</td><td>2.67</td><td>0</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>IVC Age</td><td>8622</td><td>3.39</td><td>3</td><td>2.49</td><td>0</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>Early 1st Inv.</td><td>8622</td><td>0.45</td><td>0</td><td>0.50</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Bubble 1st Inv.</td><td>8622</td><td>0.34</td><td>0</td><td>0.47</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Fin.

CVC-backed ventures show higher funding levels than IVCs: on average, the funding amount is US\\$ 62 million for CVC-backed ventures and US\\$ 30 million for IVC-backed ventures. The difference between both funding amounts is significant at the level of $1\\%$ . CVC and IVC demonstrate a significant difference between first investing time and exit process. CVC-backed ventures take an average of 95 months to exit compared to only 78 months for IVC-backed. Moreover, $38.5\\%$ of CVC-backed ventures exits through an IPO whilst only $34.4\\%$ of IVC-backed firms exits through an IPO. Its mean difference is significant at the level of $1\\%$ . CVC-backed ventures tend to be backed by older experienced funds which tend to have smaller sizes than those of fully IVC-backed ventures. CVC-backed ventures have more investment rounds (4.8 rounds) than IVC-backed ventures (3.8 rounds) and larger syndicate size with a difference of 4 funds. $41.1\\%$ of IVC-backed ventures’ first investment was performed at seed or early stage while it is the case for $45.1\\%$ of CVC-backed ventures.

Investors are faster at exiting US ventures, taking on average 14.4 months less to do so than UK investors. Moreover, as expected, the US reports a larger share of VC-backed IPOs, enhancing a US market which stimulates entrepreneurial activity and allows for an easier public exit (Lindstrom, 2006; Schwienbacher, 2005; Cumming & MacIntosh, 2000).  \n\n### 4.3 Investment amount model  \n\nThe following regression model assess CVC financing using ordinary least squares (OLS) on the full sample, and on US and UK sub-samples.  \n\n$$\nL n\\left(F u n d i n g A m o u n t\\right)=\\propto_{0}+\\propto_{1}C V C_{i}+\\sum_{k=1}^{15}\\propto_{k}Z_{k i}+?_{i}\n$$  \n\nTable 4 reports OLS estimations of funding amount. The results show a positive and significant relation between having CVC investor backing the venture and funding amount. This result implies that CVC-backed ventures tend to receive $17\\%$ larger funding amounts in the US and $11\\%$ in the UK than IVC-backed ones. This means that the positive impact of CVC backing on funding amount is stronger for US ventures. These findings complement research of Cumming et al., (2005) who find that additional capital is allocated to VCs provide strategic and managerial advice to ventures and results suggest that the maturity, size, capital availability and liquidity inherent to the US capital market strengthen the comparative advantages of CVC financing. Moreover, if CVC is the first investor, this will increase the funds to be $18\\%$ greater in the US and $12\\%$ greater in the UK than the IVC funding amounts. Additionally, once having multiple CVCs in the syndication, the ventures experience $19\\%$ increase in the funding amount in the US and $13\\%$ in the UK.  \n\n### 4.4 Duration model  \n\nTo estimate the duration model, we follow Guo et al. (2015) and Cumming & MacIntosh (2001), using Weibull distribution of residual values, given its reliability and validity for studying lifetime analysis. As a consequence, the survivor function $S(t)$ andthehazardrate $h(t)$ for the Weibull distribution are stated as the following:  \n\nIn the aforementioned equation, $t$ denotes months number between investment and exit, as in the variable Duration (months), $p$ represents the shape parameter whilst $e$ concerns the exponential transformation. Vectors $\\mathbf{X}$ and $\\mathfrak{a}$ symbolised independent variables and their coefficients. Failure is defined as having exited before $t_{:}$ . and this is the survival model. Since the dataset is uncensored, all ventures will have exited through an IPO or a Merger before t. Accordingly, a Failure case in the presented model is every single sampled venture. The duration variable $t$ will therefore capture time needed by each firm to exit. Ventures will host a shorter duration before exit, for a higher Failure likelihood indicated by hazard rate larger than 1. Contrarily, a hazard rate inferior to 1 will suggest a slower exiting process. The hazard rates for the normal survival estimations are portraited in Table 5. As mentioned earlier, a hazard rate larger than 1 is an indication for shorter duration before exit whilst values below 1 hint a slower exiting process.  \n\nTable 3 Univariate Analysis   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"5\">Panel A.Analysis by Investor Type</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>IVC-Backed</td><td>CVC-Backed</td><td>Difference</td><td>t-stat</td></tr><tr><td>USA</td><td>0.964</td><td>0.994</td><td>-0.03</td><td>(-1.117)</td></tr><tr><td>IPO</td><td>0.343</td><td>0.385</td><td>-0.042***</td><td>(-5.481)</td></tr><tr><td>Acquisition</td><td>0.763</td><td>0.84</td><td>-0.077***</td><td>-5.632</td></tr><tr><td>Funding Amount</td><td>30.66</td><td>62.71</td><td>-32.05***</td><td>(-3.384)</td></tr><tr><td>Duration (m)</td><td>78.026</td><td>95.446</td><td>-17.42***</td><td>(-4.178)</td></tr><tr><td>#Rounds</td><td>3.841</td><td>4.889</td><td>-1.048***</td><td>(-8.453)</td></tr><tr><td>#Funds</td><td>5.6</td><td>9.4</td><td>-3.8***</td><td>(-16.957)</td></tr><tr><td>Fund Size</td><td>324.091</td><td>228.975</td><td>95.116***</td><td>-4.637</td></tr><tr><td>VC Age</td><td>7.564</td><td>8.463</td><td>-0.899***</td><td>(-8.451)</td></tr><tr><td>IVC Age</td><td>6.058</td><td>7.463</td><td>1.405***</td><td>-4.513</td></tr><tr><td>Patent in Stock</td><td>0.451</td><td>0.671</td><td>-0.22**</td><td>-2.072</td></tr><tr><td>Early 1stInv</td><td>0.533</td><td>0.84</td><td>-0.307*</td><td>-2.138</td></tr><tr><td>Bubble_1stInv</td><td>0.08</td><td>0.086</td><td>-0.006***</td><td>(-9.122)</td></tr><tr><td>FCrisis_1stInv</td><td>0.149</td><td>0.142</td><td>0.007***</td><td>-3.487</td></tr><tr><td>FCrisis_Exit</td><td>0.405</td><td>0.442</td><td>-0.037</td><td>-1.12</td></tr><tr><td>Business Services</td><td>0.562</td><td>0.573</td><td>-0.011**</td><td>-3.037</td></tr><tr><td>High Tech</td><td>0.994</td><td>0.964</td><td>0.03</td><td>-1.623</td></tr><tr><td>N</td><td>5605</td><td>3017</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\">Panel B.

We find that CVC-backed ventures in the US tend to have longer durations $41\\%$ in the US and $25\\%$ in the UK, relatively to their IVC-backed counterparts. Capturing the effect of having CVC as first financing, this will increase the funding duration to be $43\\%$ greater in the US and $28\\%$ greater in the UK than the IVC funding duration. Additionally, we apprehend that the interpretation of these effects significantly remains the same when the independent variable is changed to grasp the majority of capital being provided by CVCs $(\\%C V C)$ , the ventures experience $45\\%$ increase in the funding duration in the US and $29\\%$ in the UK. US CVCfunded ventures host longer investment duration compared to IVC-funded ones and UK backed ventures.  \n\n### 4.5 Exit model  \n\nExit model aims to assess the effects of the CVC investment decisions on the ventures’ exit strategies. A binary logistic regression is utilised to model the likelihood of exiting through an IPO. An OLS model is run to shed a light on the magnitude of these effects following the subsequent equation:  \n\n$$\n\\mathit{I P O}=\\infty_{0}+\\infty_{1}C V C_{i}+\\infty_{2}l n\\left(\\mathit{F u n d i n g A m o u n t}\\right)_{i}+\\infty_{3}l n\\left(\\mathit{D u r a t i o n}\\right)_{i}+\\sum_{k=1}^{15}\\infty_{k}Z_{k i}+\\gamma_{i}Z_{k i}.\n$$  \n\nTable 6 reports the estimations of the effect of investment decisions on the exit route variable. Model (1.1, 2.1, 3.1) shows CVC funding impact on the exit route of backed companies for the full sample as well as in the US and the UK by controlling for CVC fund only and neither the duration nor the funding, revealing a positive impact of CVC funding on IPO route. We find that CVC funding encourages the IPO exit of backed companies. In Models (2.2, 3.2), we add the investment duration and the investment amount. The results reveal that investment duration has negatively affect impact the IPO and hence a positive direct effect on acquisition exit. For the purpose of organizational learning and innovation, investment duration has a positive impact on acquisition exit in CVC-backed companies. As we have expected, companies seeking innovation continue their investment longer before exiting in order to enhance both learning and knowledge transfer, which may then motivate the acquisition exit option. Additionally, we find a significant positive impact on IPO exit for CVC-backed companies in the US and IVC- backed companies for the UK. As a result, the amounts of follow-on investment increase the likelihood of IPO exit in CVC- and IVCbacked companies. In Models (2.3, 3.3), we control for the investor type and the results of CVC funds are not significant. The results in Models (4.1, 4.2) Panel B and using the OLS estimation approach give the same output regarding the successful exit IPO following the VC funding (CVC and IVC).  \n\nMoreover, we find that the non-linear impact of duration before exit is positive and statistically significant Models (2.4, 3.4).

Investment period is positively correlated with the mitigation of information asymmetries and agency costs amongst the venture's insiders and outside investors (Cumming & MacIntosh, 2001; Gompers & Lerner, 1998a, b; Sahlman,1990).  \n\n### 4.6 Treatment Effects Robustness tests  \n\nIn an effort to mitigate the identification concern of VCs investing in better quality firms, the model of treatment-effect regression is employed across the three previously mentioned models. This model accommodates a comprehensive selection model version two-step Heckman that contemplates omitted variables' impact that simultaneously influence investor type, funding amount, duration before exit, and exit strategies (Guo et al., 2015). In the first stage regression, CVC is the dependent variable which aims to understand the CVC financing determinants. Using Probit regression we attempt to measure the CVC fund determinants at the first stage regression. Based on the rationale that CVCs will invest in industries with more liquidity and extra cash (Guo et al., 2015), we included AvgWC which measures for five years the average working capital available in the venture's industry before first investment date, as a representation of accounting liquidity. Similarly, $A\\nu g N E T C F$ captures the average net cash-flow in an industry, as a proxy for extra available cash in a specific industry. To decrease the endogeneity of matters in which CVCs are experts, such as choosing superior companies over IVCs and funding further R&D plans, we added the variable patent stock, that covers patents number implemented by a company prior to VC funding to represent the company's character and innovativeness (Guo et al., 2015). Additionally, we added industry relatedness, to measure the similarity degree in the business sectors between the partners. Finally, we included three variables that capture whether the venture's first investment was performed at seed, early or later stage.  \n\nThe first stage equation:  \n\n$$\np r o b(C V C)_{i}=1|x_{i}^{\\prime}=\\frac{\\exp(x_{i}^{\\prime})\\beta}{1+\\exp(x_{i}^{\\prime})\\beta}\n$$  \n\nwhere $(C V C)_{i}$ is the response which equals 1 for a CVC company $i$  \n\n$(x_{i}^{\\prime})\\beta=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}\\mathrm{{AvgWC}}+\\beta_{2}$ Avg $\\mathrm{NETCF}+\\beta_{3}$ Patents in Stoc $\\mathrm{k}+\\beta_{4}$ Industry Relatedness $+\\beta_{5}$ Seed Stage $+\\beta_{6}$ Early Stage $+\\beta_{7}$ Later Stage $^+$ $\\beta_{8}$ Year Fixed Effects $+~\\beta_{9}$ Industry Fixed Effects (5)  \n\nTable 7 presents first stage regression. The results show that venture's accounting liquidity as well as its innovativeness has a statistically positive impact on the CVC funding. Corporate investors tend to fund innovative companies with higher patents applications. Moreover, the industry's characteristics such as extra available cash in a specific industry and the degree of similarity in the business sector between the CVC fund and the venture affect statistically and positively the CVC funding. However, performing the venture's first investment at seed, early or later stage has a statistically negative impact on the CVC funding. The early stage of new business development is risky and uncertain which may explain thisresult.  \n\nTable 7 Probit estimation for CVC financing   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Panel A.Probit Estimation</td></tr><tr><td>D.V: CVC</td><td>Model 1</td><td>Model 2</td><td>Model 3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">AvgWC</td><td>Full Sample</td><td>USA</td><td>UK</td></tr><tr><td>-0.036***</td><td>-0.033***</td><td>-0.066***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Avg NETCF</td><td>(0.004)</td><td>(0.004)</td><td>(0.017)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.002***</td><td>-0.002***</td><td>-0.000*</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Patents in stock</td><td>(0.000)</td><td>(0.000)</td><td>(0.001)</td></tr><tr><td>0.087***</td><td>0.054***</td><td>0.038***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Industry Relatedness</td><td>(3.071)</td><td>(2.101)</td><td>(1.081)</td></tr><tr><td>0.345**</td><td>0.415**</td><td>0.174**</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Seed Stage</td><td>(4.122) -0.838***</td><td>(3.451)</td><td>(2.412)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-0.832***</td><td>-1.054***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Early Stage</td><td>(0.066)</td><td>(0.067)</td><td>(0.368)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.950***</td><td>-0.952***</td><td>-0.912***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Later Stage</td><td>(0.038) -0.857***</td><td>(0.039) -0.860***</td><td>(0.221) -0.828***</td></tr><tr><td>(0.044)</td><td>(0.045)</td><td>(0.220)</td></tr><tr><td>YearFixed Effects</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Industry Fixed</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Effects N</td><td>8622</td><td>7156</td><td>1465</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table reports the first stage treatment effects regressions where a Probit regression is run aiming to predict the likelihood of a venture receiving any CVC funding.

The output of second stage treatment-effects estimation of funding amount is reported in Table 8. The statistically significant inverse Mills ratios throughout the treatment-effects estimations, portraited on confirm an identification problem within the estimation of investment strategies in US and UK sampled ventures. Following our control for the inverse Mills ratio, we continue to see that CVC-backed ventures host higher levels of funding, when compared to fully IVC-backed ones. In sum, results firmly support the intuition that CVC-backed ventures receive larger funding amounts (Hypothesis I) and the findings allow to understand that the positive impact of CVC financing on funding raised is stronger for the US, when compared to UK.  \n\nTable 8 Treatment Effects estimation of Funding Amount   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"7\">Panel A.

Nevertheless, the main dependent variable $C V C$ remains significant across all estimations indicating that CVC financing impacts duration before exit. CVC-backed ventures stay longer than IVC backed ventures in the investment process. Finally, the treatment-effects estimation reported at Table 10 shows a sample selection bias, though the qualitative interpretation of the estimation of exit strategies remains unchanged. Further, we find CVC-backed firms to have less probability of IPO, than their IVC peers and that this influence is stronger in the USA when compared to the UK. We find a positive impact of fund size on exit routes, and we observe that innovative companies with patents applied for before the first investment has more power to exit through IPO. This result suggests that higher innovative quality increases the possibility of IPO exit for a company.  \n\n## 5 Discussion  \n\nThe results from the funding amount models support previous literature enhancing CVCs' ability to certify firm quality and to provide confidence to outsider investors (AlvarezGarrido & Dushnitsky, 2016), thus increasing ventures′ funding amounts. Our results echo existing literature (Guo et al., 2015; Cumming 2006). However, only in the US, the VC age has a positive and significant impact of funding amount. This result suggests that older funds hold substantial resources allowing them to invest large amounts in ventures (Bertoni et al., 2015; Schwienbacher, 2005, 2008). In addition, raising funds at a seed or early stage has a negative and significant impact on the funding amount in the US. Regarding the venture's industry, we find that when the venture belongs to the business industry, this has significant positive impact on the raised funds in the US and in the UK. On the contrary, when the venture operates in the high-tech sectors, it has a significant negative impact on the funding amount. Moreover, US ventures with first investment during the dot.com bubble receive larger investment amounts, which is not the case for UK ventures. We find a significant negative relationship between financial crisis distressed times and the VC funding amount in the US. Intuitively, ventures inserted in an industry with higher working capital and net cash flow tend to have larger funding amounts (Guo et al., 2015).  \n\nThe results also show a positive and significant relation among venture’s innovativeness, assessed by the venture's patent stock, and the funding amount in both countries. This result suggests that the uncertainty about the venture's quality is reduced thanks to the number of patents implemented by the venture allowing the VC fund to increase its funding amount. This result is consistent with Guo et al. (2015). Finally, the findings show that the percentage of similarity in the business sector between the VC fund and the backed company, both in the US and in the UK, has a significant positive impact on amounts of funding. Industry relatedness mitigates uncertainty (Cefis et al., 2020) and enables VC funds to invest high amounts. In sum, results firmly support the intuition that CVC-backed ventures receive larger funding amounts, when compared to their IVC-backed counterparts (HypothesisI) and the findings allow understanding that the positive impact of CVC financing on funding raised is stronger for the US, when compared to UK.  \n\nTable 9 Treatment Effects estimation of Duration before Exit   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"7\">Panel A.

This result complements previous literature findings which state that the maturity, size and liquidity, as well as better screening and monitoring skills (Schwienbacher, 2005, 2008; Lindstrom, 2006) of the US market allow for a longer investment duration. We find that US ventures which have raised a higher number of rounds and with more invested funds have longer duration, however, fund size does not seem to play a significant role on investment duration. We find also that older VCs $(V C A g e)$ tend to have longer durations before exit as younger VCs seek to establish a track record, directly linked to shorter durations (Gompers, 1996) and premature exits (Cumming & MacIntosh, 2001; Gompers & Lerner, 1998a, b). Relative to other industries, we find that firms in business services industry and in high-tech industry tend to have slower exiting processes implying due to information asymmetry effect. As pointed out by (Cumming & MacIntosh, 2000), there is an inverse relationship between information asymmetry and the duration of investment. Technology firms are characterised by greater information asymmetry because they have large intangible assets, which are specifically hard to value in early business stages, leading to lengthier investment durations (Cumming & Johan, 2010; Cumming & MacIntosh, 2001).  \n\nWe also find a positive impact ofthe financial crisis besides the dot.com bubble on investment and exit. The duration is long when a venture's first investment was made in 1999, 2000, 2008, or 2009. This supports the fact that VC fundraising is reliant on inherent market conditions. In addition, CVC-backed ventures with a higher cash flow will host a longer duration before exit, relatively to their IVC-backed counterparts. Investment is then driven by industries' liquidity and extra cash according to Guo et al. (2015). The results show also that US ventures whose first VC investment was made during the early stages of development are associated with a shorter average duration. Indeed, information asymmetry is larger at earlier stages of business, enhancing the potential of misvalued investments which will be exited faster. Moreover, information asymmetry between VCs and entrepreneurs dissipates faster at early stages of development, leading to a quicker exit when the investment is not deemed cost-effective (Cumming & MacIntosh, 2001).  \n\nGuo et al., (2015) demonstrate that if the acquisition market is an uninformed one then it is better possible to encourage IPO exit as the information asymmetry creates the possibility of IPO valuation higher than the deal price the venture would obtain from an M&A operation, and the probability of an IPO diminishes as the duration is longer. IPOs are linked to better quality firms and to a higher degree of VC involvement to avoid failure (Schwienbacher, 2005). Hence, ventures exiting through an IPO can incur longer durations as investors seek to reduce information asymmetries with ventures to maximise potential gains. Moreover, Gompers & Lerner (1998a, b) show that IPOs are correlated with exits earlier than optimal, implying shorter durations, as inexperienced VCs seek to send positive signals to outsiders. This insight joins Guo et al., (2015) who report that CVC funding indirectly affects funding amount and duration levels. We also find that, for UK, having Multiple CVCs significantly increases the probability of a successful exit Model (3.4), reiterating CVCs′ superior skills at taking ventures public (Guo et al., 2015).  \n\nThis paper finds that high-technology companies have less probabilities to exit through an IPO and we complement the findings that strong market conditions (ln MSCI Index) increase IPO likelihood as bull markets are characterised by greater capital availability to the VC industry (Cumming & MacIntosh, 2001) and inherently provide investors a window of opportunity to obtain higher exit valuations, boosting compensation (Cumming & Johan, 2010). Likewise, firms who exited during the financial crisis (FCrisis_Exit) have less likelihood of IPO exit and the magnitude of this effect is stronger amongst UK ventures. This supports the finding that IPOs are more likely to occur amongst industries with higher signs of liquidity (Avg NetCF). Lastly, most control variables were statistically significant in the US but not in the UK, suggesting that the US and UK VC markets are yet to be entirely incorporated, and theoretical models maintain more in the US than in the UK.  \n\n## 6 Conclusion  \n\nOur paper focuses on the impact of CVC financing on funding, duration and exit strategy decisions in an international comparative context. We focus on investment decisions based on the two types of investors (CVC and IVC) that lead to their exit routes (IPO, acquisition, write-off). Both the length of involvement in a company and the level of investment are essential for an entrepreneur and VCs to increase the company's chances of success. Our results build a model that explains how investment decisions in VC affect the exit strategy. This study investigates how the presence of CVC develops more substantial dedication (high investment amounts) once uncertainty decreases (longer duration).  \n\nResults show that CVC-backed ventures receive larger funding amounts and support the rationale that the positive impact of CVC financing on funding raised by ventures is stronger for the US when compared to the UK. Findings show that US CVC-backed firms are linked to longer durations before exit than IVC-backed ones. The Funding amount is positively correlated with the likelihood of an IPO exit. Our empirical results show that CVC funding motivates higher injections of the amounts to be invested. Additionally, CVC financing motivates longer duration of funding. Our results support the impact of the investment decisions on the exit strategy, but we didn't find direct impact of the fund on the exit decision. As ventures are not randomly assigned to CVC and IVC investors, revealing endogeneity concerns, our analysis reduces bias selection. We first start by controlling for the quality of the ventures (patent stock) before being funded by a VC investor. Additionally, and to mitigate endogeneity, we employ treatment effects to consider potential unobservables.  \n\nThis research joins the CVC literature on differences induced by CVC and IVC financing, crucial to optimise decision making and align incentives between ventures, VCs, and fund investors. Moreover, this research contributes to the relatively unexplored field of differences amongst investor types in countries other than the US. This study has useful, practical implications. VC firms can consider the staging decision at each financing round as deciding between investing and delay. Regarding the funding amount and the timing of funding, while liquidity conditions, syndicate features, and portfolio company performance are all critical factors, VC firms need to assess the wider decision context and the results of real options factors such as uncertainty on the staging decision. By evaluating the effects of investments, this study has implications on the consequences of different organisational structures on exit performance, helping to align incentives between fund investors, VCs, and entrepreneurs and enabling players to choose the optimal set of investment characteristics and organisations to reach their correspondent ultimate goals. A mindful outlook on historical VC decisions and on their advantages and contingencies for both VCs and entrepreneurial firms will likewise support a conscious decision-making process regarding harvesting and divesting.  \n\nOur study offers possible directions for future research by focusing on joint ventures alliances (Keil et al., 2008). Future research can select specific industries and concentrate on collecting information on the technology of the funded company and its components at different company growth to examine the particular sources of business uncertainty more explicitly. Additionally, more research can be done to compare CVC investment across different sectors to enhance our understanding of the investment consequences in specific sector. Finally, we need to increase our understanding of the special requirements for the funded company at each stage which will impact the investment decisions of the corporate investor.  \n\n## Appendix A - CVC and IVC comparison  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>CVC</td><td>IVC</td></tr><tr><td>Definition</td><td>Minority equity investor through a subsidiary of a Limited liability partnership. parent corporation.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>ValueCreation</td><td>Strategic and financial gains through knowledge, innovation or technologies synergies.</td><td>Purely financial gains-growing and exiting at the highest pos- siblevalue.</td></tr><tr><td>Funding</td><td>Stemsfrom the parent company's assets and revenues.</td><td>Stems from capital raised from institutionalinvestors and wealthy individuals.</td></tr><tr><td>Investment Horizon</td><td>Open-ended.</td><td>Usually around 7-10 years.</td></tr><tr><td>Managers' Compensation Scheme</td><td>Reliant on parent company - salary and bonus structure.</td><td>Reliant on fund's performance - annual management fee and profit share.</td></tr><tr><td>Benefits</td><td>Complementary assets such as network, expertise, accommodations, and R&D.</td><td>Network, strategy advisory.</td></tr><tr><td>Risktolerance</td><td>Increased tolerancetofailure.</td><td>Low tolerance for venture failure.</td></tr><tr><td>Exit Strategy</td><td>Exit like an IVC though it can hold on to invest- ments for much longer and even acquire the venture an IPO, M&A operation, or</td><td>Realisation of profits through</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n### Appendix B - Variables Description  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variable</td><td>Definition</td></tr><tr><td>CVC</td><td>A variable equal one if a company has one CVC investor or more.</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variable</td><td>Definition</td></tr><tr><td>CVC_1st</td><td>AvariableequaloneifaventurehasoneCVCinvestorormoreinitsfirst investment round.</td></tr><tr><td>% CVC</td><td>CVC amounts scaled by venture capital total investment amounts.</td></tr><tr><td>Funding Amount</td><td>Disclosed equity amount received by a venture, in $ millions, summed over number ofinvestment rounds.</td></tr><tr><td>Duration (m)</td><td>First investment to completion of exit dates measured by months.</td></tr><tr><td>IPO</td><td>A variable equal to one if a company exit through an IPO.</td></tr><tr><td>#Rounds</td><td>Number of funding rounds raised by a venture.</td></tr><tr><td>#Funds</td><td>Total number of funds invested in a venture.</td></tr><tr><td>Fund Size</td><td>Average fund size, in $ millions, across all funds invested in a venture.</td></tr><tr><td>VCAge</td><td>Average VC age across all funds invested in a venture.</td></tr><tr><td>High-Tech</td><td>A variable equal to one if a venture is at the High-Tech sector (SIC=28. 357, 481, or 737).</td></tr><tr><td>Business Services</td><td>A variable where the venture belongs tobusiness service sector SIC=73.</td></tr><tr><td>Bubble_lstInv</td><td>A variable equal one if a company's first investment is made in 1999 or 2000.</td></tr><tr><td>FCrisis_1stInv</td><td>A variable equal one if a company's first investment is made in 2008 or 2009.</td></tr><tr><td>FCrisis_Exit</td><td>A variable equal one if a company exit in 2008 or 2009.</td></tr><tr><td>MSCI</td><td>Country specific O-3 months MSCI return before a venture's exit date.</td></tr><tr><td>AvgWC</td><td>Average working capital available in a venture's industry5 years before a specific year in a specific industry.</td></tr><tr><td>Avg NETCF</td><td>AverageNet Cash-flow available in a venture's industry5yearsbefore a specific year in a specific industry.</td></tr><tr><td>Early 1stInv</td><td>A variable equal to oneif a company's first investmentis made at earlystages</td></tr><tr><td>Seed Stage</td><td>The venture'sfirst investment is made at seed stage of development.</td></tr><tr><td>Early Stage</td><td>The venture's first investment is made at early stage of development.</td></tr><tr><td>Expansion Stage</td><td>The venture's first investment is made at expansion stage of development.</td></tr><tr><td>Patent Stock</td><td>Patents number implemented by a company prior to theVC funding.</td></tr><tr><td>Industry Relatedness</td><td>Degree of business similarity among partners (investor-venture).</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n## References  \n\nAlvarez-Garrido, E., & Dushnitsky, G.

A Two-Sided Matching Model of Venture Capital  \n\nMORTEN SORENSEN\\*  \n\n# ABSTRACT  \n\nI find that companies funded by more experienced VCs are more likely to go public. This follows both from the direct influence of more experienced VCs and from sorting in the market, which leads experienced VCs to invest in better companies. Sorting creates an endogeneity problem, but a structural model based on a two-sided matching model is able to exploit the characteristics of the other agents in the market to separately identify and estimate influence and sorting. Both effects are found to be significant, with sorting almost twice as important as influence for the difference in IPO rates.  \n\nVENTURE CAPITALISTS (VCs) INVEST IN PRIVATELY held entrepreneurial companies. They are actively involved in the monitoring and management of these companies (Gorman and Sahlman (1989), Sahlman (1990), Gompers and Lerner (1999)), they typically own a substantial fraction of the companies, usually in the form of convertible securities (Hellmann (1998), Casamatta (2003), Cornelli and Yosha (2003), Kaplan and Stromberg (2003)), and they are commonly represented on the boards of directors (Lerner (1995)). Kaplan and Schoar (2005) find significant persistence in the VCs’ returns and conclude that the most likely explanation is heterogeneity in the skills of these investors.  \n\nI find that companies with more experienced investors are more likely to go public. This finding is driven by two distinct effects: influence, which means that experienced VCs add more value and bring companies public at a higher rate, and sorting, which means that more experienced VCs invest in better companies. The main objective here is to develop an econometric model to distinguish these two effects and to estimate and thereby quantify their relative importance. Both effects are found to be statistically and economically significant, with sorting appearing almost twice as important as influence for explaining the observed differences in IPO rates across VC investors.  \n\nMore experienced VCs can influence and add value to companies in several ways. First, experienced VCs may be better at monitoring and managing companies. Second, they may have access to larger networks, drawing on a greater number of contacts with suppliers, customers, and potential managers (Hellmann and Puri (2002), Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu (2007)). Third, the reputation of an experienced VC may communicate unobserved qualities about the company to the market, increasing the market value of the company (Megginson and Weiss (1991). In contrast, sorting arises from the matching between VCs and companies. Companies care about the identity of the investor. When faced with multiple offers, companies routinely turn down the investor with the best financial offer in favor of an investor that adds more value in other ways (Hsu (2004)). Since companies more willingly accept financing from better VCs, these VCs have more feasible investments to choose from. Anecdotal evidence suggests that VCs consider this access to a proprietary deal flow to be a distinct competitive advantage. Sorting predicts that investments by experienced VCs perform better because the companies themselves are inherently better, not because the VCs increase the value of these companies. Clearly, sorting and influence are not mutually exclusive effects. The question is how to empirically separate these two effects and measure their relative importance.  \n\nViewed in a classical regression framework, the investor's experience becomes endogenous when sorting causes experienced investors to invest in companies that are better along a number of dimensions that are unobserved in the data. Companies with better unobserved characteristics, as captured by the error term in the regression, match with more experienced investors. The error term becomes positively correlated with experience, and the estimated coefficient is biased upwards relative to the investors? actual influence. A simple example illustrating this bias is given below. This problem is particularly severe for entrepreneurial companies. Entrepreneurial companies have short operating and financial histories. Little information is systematically observed for these companies, and VCs emphasize intangible qualities such as the quality of the management team, competition, customer adoption, and general uncertainties facing the business when they evaluate these investments (Kaplan and Stromberg (2004)). Not surprisingly, the results below indicate substantial endogeneity, and the sorting on the unobserved characteristics appears stronger than the sorting on the observed characteristics.  \n\nThe classical solution to the endogeneity problem is to estimate the model using instrumental variables. For each investment, the instrument must be independent of the outcome but related to the experience of the investor making the investment. Unfortunately, the economics underlying the decisions make it difficult to find such an instrument. The matching of a given company with an investor with a certain level of experience is determined by their mutual investment decisions, and when their characteristics only relate to the investment decision to the extent the characteristics affect expected returns, they are not valid instruments. For example, the distance between the investor and the company is one candidate instrument,1 as VCs are more likely to invest in companies that are located closer (Lerner (1995). However, because it is also easier for VCs to monitor and manage these companies, the VCs' preference for these investments may be due to the higher return from the improved monitoring and managing, in which case distance is not independent of outcome and hence it is not a valid instrument. The same argument applies to other characteristics as well.  \n\nTo overcome the problem of missing instruments, I develop a new structural model that exploits the implications of sorting to separate sorting from influence. Sorting implies that in a market with more experienced investors, a given investor is pushed down in the relative ranking and is left with worse companies. Hence, an investor's investment decisions depend on the characteristics of other agents in the market. However, the outcome of the investment is independent of these other characteristics, and the other investors’ characteristics present a source of exogenous variation. This exogenous variation is similar to an instrumental variable, and the structural model uses it to identify influence and sorting. Other papers have successfully exploited this kind of variation as a source of exogenous variation (i.e., Bresnahan (1987), Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995) although the methodology employed here differs substantially from their methodologies.  \n\nSpecifically, the structural model has two parts. The first part consists of the outcome equation, which specifies the outcome of each investment. With sorting and the resulting endogeneity problem, estimation of this equation alone yields inconsistent estimates. The second part controls for sorting, and it is based on a two-sided matching model called the college admissions model (see Gale and Shapley (1962) and Roth and Sotomayor (1990)). This model forms the basis for an empirical model of market sorting, and the resulting empirical matching model is a discrete choice model that generalizes existing models, such as the Probit model, by allowing for interactions among the choices made by different agents. Together, the two parts are analogous to the two stages of the two-stage estimator in the Heckman selection model (Heckman (1976, 1979)). The matching model controls for the sorting and the selection of the observed investments and eliminates bias in the estimation of the outcome equation. Estimation is numerically intensive, but Bayesian estimation using Gibbs sampling (Gelfand and Smith (1990), Geweke (1999)) is a feasible estimation method. The estimation procedure here is related to the procedure used by Geweke, Gowrisankaran, and Town (2003), but it extends their analysis by using the empirical matching model to control for endogeneity rather than the multinomial Probit model, which is unable to capture the sorting that is the source of identification in this paper.2  \n\nThe approach outlined above has certain limitations. The matching model is a static equilibrium model, and it does not capture dynamic features of the market or issues concerned with the timing of investments (see Inderst and Muller (2004). Second, the matching model assumes complete information, with experienced VCs having access to a superior deal flow because more companies prefer these VCs as their investors, not because these VCs are better at screening entrepreneurs (an informational issue).3 Further, the computational complexity of the structural model necessitates some compromises in the specification of the estimated model. Computation time increases substantially with the number of explanatory variables, and only simple specifications are computationally tractable. I have been unable to estimate the model with fixed effects, random effects, or other more general error structures. Finally, it should be noted that the methodological approach is a structural approach. The model explicitly imposes a number of economic restrictions on the analysis, and the validity ofthe estimated coefficients depends on these assumptions. The benefit of this approach is that the model solves the problem of missing instruments; more direct methods are unable to do this. In addition, the explicit statement of the underlying assumptions makes the identification and interpretation of the parameters transparent.4 Hopefully, future extensions of the analysis can address the remaining shortcomings.  \n\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. Section I illustrates the bias arising in markets with sorting. Section II presents the formal matching model. Section III develops the empirical model and Section IV presents the data. Section V discusses empirical findings, and Section VI concludes. A description of the estimation procedure is in the Appendix.  \n\n## 1. Bias from Two-Sided Matching  \n\nConsider a market with two investors, $i=\\mathrm{A}$ , B, and four companies, $j=1$ 2, 3, 4. Each investor has a single characteristic, say experience. Experience is observed, and let the experience of investors A and $\\mathbf{B}$ be $X_{\\mathrm{A}}=1$ and $X_{\\mathrm{B}}=$ 2, respectively. Each company also has a single characteristic, say the quality of the management team, but this is unobserved in the data. Let the qualities of the four companies? managements be $X_{1}=1$ ， $X_{2}=2$ $X_{3}=3$ , and $X_{4}=4$ Given two companies and four investors, there are eight potential matches, the outcomes of which are determined by the following outcome equation  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{Y_{i j}=\\beta_{0}+X_{i}\\beta_{1}+X_{j}\\beta_{2}+\\varepsilon_{i j}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nHere, $Y_{i j}$ is the outcome, and $X_{i}$ and $X_{j}$ are the characteristics of the investor and the company. For simplicity, let $\\varepsilon_{i j}$ always equal zero, and let the true parameters be $\\beta_{0}=0$ $\\beta_{1}=0$ , and $\\beta_{2}=10$ . Since $\\beta_{1}$ is zero, the outcome does not depend on the investor's experience, and the influence is zero. Assigning a company to a more or less experienced investor leaves its outcome unchanged.  \n\nCompany   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"5\">Investor</td><td></td><td>4 (X4=4)</td><td>3 (X3=3)</td><td>2 (X2=2)</td><td>(X=1)</td></tr><tr><td>C (Xc=3)</td><td>40</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B (XB=2)</td><td>40</td><td>30 30</td><td>20</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A (XA=1)</td><td></td><td></td><td>20</td><td>10 10</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nLet investor A invest in companies 1 and 2, and let investor B invest in companies 3 and 4. The bold numbers in Figure 1 illustrate the observed outcomes of these matches.  \n\nSince companies' qualities are unobserved, one can imagine using the four observed outcomes to estimate the short outcome equation  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{Y_{i j}=\\beta_{0}+X_{i}\\beta_{1}+\\varepsilon_{i j}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates of equation (2) are $\\hat{\\beta}_{0}=-5$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_{1}=20$ , and the estimated influence of 20 is biased upwards relative to the true value of zero. This bias arises from the systematic matching of companies 3 and 4, which have better unobserved characteristics, to the more experienced investor B. Note, that the model is symmetric. The reverse effect can be present at the same time, and an unobserved investor characteristic that is related to the matching would bias the estimated effect of the companies? characteristics.  \n\nTo solve this problem, consider observing an additional market with four similar companies, but with an additional investor C. Let $X_{\\mathrm{C}}=3$ .Thepresence of investor C reduces the other investors’ relative ranks in the market, leaving investor B with investments in companies 2 and 3. The outcomes of these investments are given by the remaining (not bold) numbers in Figure 1. Again, the estimate of influence from the short outcome equation, now with eight observed outcomes, is biased upwards. However, a direct comparison of the two markets shows that company 2 (and 4) has investors with different experiences, yet these investments have identical outcomes. It follows that the outcomes are unaffected by experience and that the influence is actually zero. Here, the change in the matching between the two markets serves the role of the exogenous variation. For the empirical application, it remains to determine which companies are comparable across different markets. This requires a matching model.  \n\n### I1. Two-Sided Matching Model  \n\nIn venture capital an investment is a mutual decision, requiring the consent of both the investor and the company. This is captured by a two-sided matching model. This model is a static equilibrium model from cooperative game theory, and the particular model developed here is a variation ofthe two-sided matching model known as the college admissions model (introduced by Gale and Shapley (1962)). Roth and Sotomayor (1990) present a broad analysis of the properties of this and related models.  \n\n#### A.Main Assumptions  \n\nBefore the formal model is presented, its main assumptions are discussed. First, the college admissions model is a one-to-many matching model. Each investor can match with several companies, but each company can only match with a single investor. In practice, it is common for companies to receive funding from multiple investors (a syndicate) over several investment rounds. One investor is the lead investor, and this investor is responsible both for the main contact with the company and for bringing other investors into the deal.5 The analysis focuses on the initial investment by this investor. Lerner (1994) finds that in the initialinvestment round VCs with similar levels ofexperience tend to syndicate, and the lead investor's experience then approximates the experience of the syndicate overall. Lerner (1994) finds further that more experienced VCs tend to enter later investment rounds of companies with better performance. However, including these later financing rounds would complicate the analysis, since the early performance cannot be attributed to these later investors, and separating companies’ performance in individual investment rounds is difficult. To the extent that later-round investors influence company performance, part of the lead investor's initial influence can be interpreted as the ability to attract these better investors in later rounds.  \n\nSecond, investors are restricted in the number of investments they make An alternative, although less tractable, assumption would be to restrict the amount of capital invested. However, the restriction on the number, rather than the amount, reflects anecdotal evidence (Quindlen (20oo)) that VCs' scarce resource is time, not money, and that deals require roughly equal amounts of time. In a systematic study ofVCs' investment analyses, Kaplan and Stromberg (2004) find that time commitment is a common concern for VCs when evaluating potential investments.  \n\nFinally, the model imposes restrictions on preferences. Each potential match has a valuation, and the valuation represents the expected net present value (NPV), at the time of the investment decision.6 Investments in better performing companies have higher valuations, and a match with a VC that adds more value also has a higher valuation. The model assumes that the investor expects to receive the fraction $\\lambda$ of the NPV, and the company expects to receive $(1{-}\\lambda)$ ,where $\\lambda$ is given. This assumption rules out transfers. For example, a weaker company cannot attract a more experienced investor by offering a higher fraction of shares. Theoretically, this is justified on two grounds. First, Holmstrom and Tirole (1997) argue that liquidity constrained entrepreneurs with potential moral hazard (i.e., shirking) have limited pledgeable expected income. If the entrepreneur initially pledges too much of the company, the incentives are muted. Second, much of the return is distributed by share allocations in later investment rounds. This ex post bargaining involves new investors and hence it is difficult ex ante to commit to transfers. In this situation, standard bargaining models predict a fixed sharing rule. The benefit of the fixed sharing rule is that it ensures that the model has a unique equilibrium. The standard college admissions model without this restriction has multiple equilibria, and it is well known that the likelihood function is not well defined for games with multiple equilibria (Bresnahan and Reiss (1991).  \n\nEmpirically, there is little evidence of transfers. Hsu (2004) finds that more reputable investors initially finance companies at somewhat lower ( $10\\%$ to $14\\%$ pre-money valuations, but it is unclear if this difference is undone in later rounds. Kaplan and Stromberg (2003) find that investment contracts specify future changes in ownership stakes depending on performance, making it difficult to interpret initial differences without accounting for these contingencies.  \n\n#### B. Agents and Matchings  \n\nThe model has two disjoint sets of agents. The set of investors is $I$ , and the set of companies is $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{I}}$ . Each company can match with a single investor, and each investor can invest in a limited number of companies. Let investor i's quota be $q_{i}$ . The set of potential investments (also known as matches in the matching literature and deals in the VC literature) is $M=I\\times J$ .A matching is a collection ofpotential investments, $\\mu\\subset M$ . Investor i's portfolio is denoted $\\mu(i)$ ， and company $j^{\\cdot}$ s investor is denoted $\\mu(j)$ . Using this notation, a match between investor $i$ and company $j$ can be stated in three equivalent ways: as $i j\\in\\mu$ , as $j\\in\\mu(i)$ , or as $i=\\mu(j)$ 7.  \n\nInvestors have preferences over investments in portfolios of companies, and companies have preferences over matches with individual investors. To state these preferences, let each potential match have a valuation, and let the valuation of the match ij be denoted $V_{i j}$ . These valuations are assumed to be distinct, and the same valuations determine the preferences of both the investors and the companies. The valuation is divided between the investor and the company according to a fixed sharing rule determined by $\\lambda\\in(0,1)$ , where the investor receives the fraction $\\lambda$ , and the company receives $(\\mathbf{1}-\\lambda)$ . Investor i's preferences over portfolios and company $j$ s preferences over investors are then represented by the two profit functions:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{\\Pi_{i}(\\mu(i))=\\lambda\\displaystyle\\sum_{j\\in\\mu(i)}V_{i j}}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{\\Pi_{j}=({\\bf1}-\\lambda)V_{\\mu(j)j}.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nAccording to these preferences, company $j$ prefers a match with investor $i^{\\prime}$ to a match with investor $i$ when $V_{i^{\\prime}j}>V_{i j}$ , and investor $i$ prefers an investment in company $j^{\\prime}$ to an investment in company $j$ when $V_{i j^{\\prime}}>V_{i j}$ . Note that these preferences do not depend on $\\lambda$ , and $\\lambda$ is not estimated by the empirical model.  \n\n#### C. Equilibrium  \n\nThe equilibrium concept used in two-sided matching models is stability. A matching is said to be stable when no agent prefers to deviate from the matching and form a new match. The simplest deviation involves a single investor and a single company. When they both prefer to abandon their existing matches and form a new match together, they form a blocking pair. A matching without any such blocking pairs is pair-wise stable.8 More complicated deviations involve larger groups of agents, and the corresponding equilibrium concept is group stability. In the college admissions model, a matching is pair-wise stable if and only if it is group stable (see Roth and Sotomayor (1990) for a formal definition and proof), thus it is without loss of generality to consider only pair-wise stability. Further, in the college admissions model, a stable matching always exists (Gale and Shapley (1962)). Since the model here is a special case of the college admissions model, these properties directly apply.  \n\nThe valuations and the fixed sharing rule impose additional restrictions on preferences, and imply two new results, namely, the equilibrium is unique, and the equilibrium condition can be expressed as a collection of inequalities. Both of these results are important for the empirical application. Without a unique equilibrium, the statistical likelihood function is not well defined (Bresnahan and Reiss (1991), and without a simple equilibrium condition, the empirical model is intractable. The propositions are given below, and their proofs are in Sorensen (2005).  \n\nPROPosITIoN 1: The college admissions model with preferences given by equations (3) and (4) and with distinct valuations has a unique equilibrium.  \n\nTo characterize the equilibrium, it is convenient to define $\\bar{V}_{i j}$ and $\\underline{{V}}_{i j}$ and the sets $S(i)$ and $\\mathrm{S}(j)$ as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\bar{V}_{i j}\\equiv\\mathrm{max}[V_{\\mu(j)j},\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{min}_{j^{\\prime}\\in\\mu(i)}V_{i j^{\\prime}}]}}\\ {{}}\\ {{\\underline{{V}}_{i j}\\equiv\\mathrm{max}\\left[\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{max}_{i^{\\prime}\\in S(j)}V_{i^{\\prime}j},\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{max}_{j^{\\prime}\\in S(i)}V_{i j^{\\prime}}\\right]}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\nS(i)\\equiv\\{j\\in J:V_{i j}>V_{\\mu(j)j}\\}\n$$  \n\n8 It is assumed that companies always prefer matching with some investor to remaining unmatched, and investors always prefer investing rather than leaving their quota unfilled. Theoretically, relaxing this assumption is straightforward (see Roth and Sotomayor (1990) and Sorensen (2005)), but it complicates the empirical model since it requires an empirical specification of agents? outsideoptions.  \n\n$$\nS(j)\\equiv\\left\\{i\\in I:V_{i j}>\\operatorname*{min}_{j^{\\prime}\\in\\mu(i)}V_{i j^{\\prime}}\\right\\}.\n$$  \n\nFor an unmatched pair $i j$ ， $\\bar{V}_{i j}$ is the opportunity cost of deviating and forming a new match together. The valuation of company $j$ s current match is $V_{\\mu(j)j}$ ， and the valuation of the worst company in investor $i$ 's portfolio is $\\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname*{min}_{j^{\\prime}\\in\\mu(i)}V_{i j^{\\prime}}}\\end{array}$ These matches are abandoned to form the new match, and the opportunity cost is the maximum of their valuations. When $V_{i j}$ exceeds $\\bar{V}_{i j}$ , investor $i$ and company $j$ both prefer to deviate and form a new match together. When $V_{i j}$ is below $\\bar{V}_{i j}$ for all unmatched pairs, no investor-company combination forms a blocking pair, and the matching is stable.  \n\nFor a matched pair $i j$ $\\underline{{V}}_{i j}$ is the opportunity cost of remaining together. The sets $S(i)$ and $S(j)$ contain the feasible deviations for investor $i$ and company $j$ , respectively. The feasible deviations for investor $i$ are the companies that prefer a match with this investor to their current match. Similarly, the feasible deviations for company $j$ are the investors that are willing to abandon one of their current matches to match with this company. The opportunity cost is the valuation of the best feasible deviation. When $V_{i j}$ exceeds $\\underline{{V}}_{i j}$ for all matched pairs, they all prefer their current match to their best feasible deviation and the matching is stable.  \n\nThe following proposition characterizes the equilibrium using both $\\bar{V}_{i j}$ and $\\underline{{V}}_{i j}$ . The conditions are equivalent, but both are important for the estimation of the model since they impose different bounds on the latent valuation variables. The first condition presents bounds for the unmatched pairs, and the second for the matched pairs (see equations (A6) and (A7) in the Appendix).  \n\nPROPOSITION 2: The matching $\\mu$ is stable if and only if $V_{i j}<\\bar{V}_{i j}$ for all $i j\\notin\\mu$ Equivalently, the matching $\\mu$ is stable if and only if $V_{i j}>\\underline{{V}}_{i j}$ for all $i j\\in\\mu$  \n\nFinally, a bit of additional notation is useful. Let the vector of all valuations in the market be $V\\in R^{|M|}$ . For a given matching $\\mu$ , the set of valuations for which $\\mu$ is the stable matching is $\\Gamma_{\\mu}\\subset R^{|M|}$ . The condition in Proposition 2 can then be stated concisely as  \n\n$$\nV\\in\\Gamma_{\\mu}\\Leftrightarrow[V_{i j}<\\bar{V}_{i j}\\:f o r\\:a l l\\:i j\\:\\notin\\mu]\\Leftrightarrow[V_{i j}>\\underline{{V}}_{i j}\\:f o r\\:a l l\\:i j\\in\\mu].\n$$  \n\n### II1. Structural Empirical Model  \n\nThe valuations represent agents? preferences. They are unobserved in the data, and in the empirical model they are latent variables. The valuation of eachpotential match $i j\\in M$ is given by the valuation equation  \n\n$$\nV_{i j}=W_{i j}^{\\prime}\\alpha+\\eta_{i j},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\eta_{i j}\\in R^{k}$ is a vector of observed characteristics for investor $i$ and company $j_{:}$ and $\\alpha\\in R^{k}$ contains parameters to be estimated. The error term $\\eta_{i j}$ contains  \n\nfactors that are unobserved in the data. Substituting the valuation equation into the equilibrium condition gives the equilibrium condition  \n\n$$\n\\mu{\\mathrm{~is~stable}}\\Leftrightarrow\\eta\\in\\Gamma_{\\mu}-W\\alpha,\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\eta\\in R^{|M|}$ are the error terms and $W\\in R^{|M|\\times k}$ are the observed characteristics for the entire market. The term $W\\alpha\\in R^{|M|}$ denotes matrix multiplication of $W_{i j}$ with $\\alpha$ for each potential match (so $W\\alpha=\\{W_{i j}^{\\prime}\\alpha,i j\\in M\\},$ . Let 1[] be the indicator function. The likelihood function of the matching model is then  \n\n$$\nL(\\mu;\\alpha)=P r(\\eta\\in\\Gamma_{\\mu}-W\\alpha)=\\int\\mathbf{1}[\\eta\\in\\Gamma_{\\mu}-W\\alpha]d F(\\eta).\n$$  \n\nWhen several independent matching markets are observed, the likelihood function is the product over these markets, and, at least in principle, $\\alpha$ canbe estimated directly by maximizing this function.  \n\nThe empirical matching model is a discrete choice model, and its parameters are only identified up to scale and level. This is natural, since the valuations represent preferences and these are unaffected by a change in the level or scale of the valuations. This means that the constant term (and other characteristics that are constant within each market) is excluded from W, since the corresponding coefficient is unidentified. This normalizes the level of the parameters. The scale is normalized by setting the variance of the error term equal to one.9  \n\nThe second part of the structural model is the outcome equation. For each $i j\\in M$ ,let  \n\n$$\nY_{i j}=X_{i j}^{\\prime}\\beta+\\varepsilon_{i j},\n$$  \n\nwhere $X_{i j}$ contains observed characteristics and $\\beta$ contains parameters to be estimated. The error term contains factors that are unobserved in the data. Some of these factors may be observed by the investor and the company at the time of the investment decision. Since only the binary outcome $I P O_{i j}$ is observed in the data, $Y_{i j}$ is a latent variable, and following a standard Probit specification, the outcome of the investment is a public offering $(I P O_{i j}=1$ when $Y_{i j}$ is greater than zero, that is,  \n\n$$\nI P O_{i j}=1[Y_{i j}\\geq0].\n$$  \n\nLike other discrete choice models, the sign and level of the coefficients are identified, but the scale is unidentified and is normalized by fixing the variance ofthe error term. Usually, this variance is set equal to one, but for computational reasons a slightly different normalization is used below.  \n\n#### A. Distribution of Error Terms and Interpretation of Parameters  \n\nThe error terms are assumed to be independent of $X$ and $W$ ,and this assumption identifies the parameters of the model. Since the outcome equation is defined for all $i j\\in M$ , the estimated parameters predict the outcomes of all potential matches, not just the observed ones. The estimated coefficient on the investor's experience reflects the predicted change in the outcome for a given company following an increase in the investor's experience. This change is the effect after controlling for the sorting in the market, and thus represents the investor's influence.  \n\nThe coefficients in the valuation equation capture preferences over matches. When the coefficient on the investor's experience is positive, matches with more experienced investors have higher valuations and rank higher in the companies’ preferences. Similarly, if the coefficient on the stage of the company is positive, investors prefer investment in late-stage companies over early-stage companies. The larger these coefficients, the stronger the preferences, and the stronger is the sorting over the observed characteristics. If the coefficients are close to zero and insignificant, then either the matching is random or it depends on characteristics not included in the valuation equation.  \n\nFor tractability, the joint distribution of $(\\varepsilon_{i j},\\eta_{i j})$ is assumed to be independent for different matches and to follow the bivariate normal distribution  \n\n$$\n\\binom{\\varepsilon_{i j}}{\\eta_{i j}}\\sim N\\left(0,\\left[1+\\delta^{2}\\begin{array}{c c}{{\\delta}}&{{\\delta}}\\ {{\\delta}}&{{1}}\\end{array}\\right]\\right).\n$$  \n\nWith a normal prior distribution (conjugate prior), the posterior distributions are also normal or truncated normal.1o However, normality is not essential for the estimation or identification of the model, and it could be relaxed. The variances of the two error terms normalize the scales of the two equations. Thevarianceof $\\eta_{i j}$ is set to one, and the variance of $\\varepsilon_{i j}$ issetto $1+\\delta^{2}$ .This normalization is convenient for the estimation and is without loss of generality (see the Appendix).  \n\nThe covariance between the error terms captures unobserved factors that affect both the outcome and the valuation of a match. For example, a company may have a particularly strong management team. This is unobserved in the data, but it is partly observed by the VC before investing and it is important for the outcome. To the extent it affects the valuation of the investment and its outcome, it enters the error terms in both the outcome and valuation equations, inducing a positive correlation between these two error terms. The covariance therefore reflects factors that are unobserved in the data, but affect the outcome and are taken into account in the initial valuation. This captures sorting over characteristics that are unobserved in the data.  \n\n#### B.Interaction, Estimation,and Identification  \n\nIn the matching model investment decisions interact. When an investor invests in a company, other investors cannot invest in this company and their investment decisions interact. Interaction leads to sorting, and interaction and sorting are fundamental properties of the model that have implications for both estimation and identification.  \n\nFor the estimation, interaction means that each agent's investment decision cannot be analyzed in isolation. Unlike the Probit model, for example, the likelihood function does not factor into a product over the likelihood of each agent's action (matching decision).1l To evaluate the likelihood function, all error terms must be integrated simultaneously. The dimensionality of this integral runs into the thousands, and currently it is not possible to evaluate such high-dimensional integrals with the speed and precision required for maximum likelihood estimation (Judd (1998). However, Bayesian estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) circumvents this integration problem. Berger (1993), Tanner (1998), and Robert and Casella (2004) provide introductions to this estimation method.  \n\nWhile interaction and sorting complicate the estimation, they also provide a solution to the endogeneity problem. As illustrated in the initial example, the endogeneity problem arises from sorting on unobserved company characteristics, captured by the error term in the matching model. Because of sorting and interaction, the presence of other agents (and their characteristics more generally) affects investment decisions and leads investors with differing experiences to invest in companies with similar unobserved characteristics (similar error terms) for exogenous reasons. Implicitly, this facilitates the direct comparison illustrated in Section I and identifies the parameters. The identifying assumption is thus that the presence and characteristics of the agents in each market are exogenously given and are independent of the error terms of the model.  \n\nBayesian estimation requires imposing prior distributions on the parameters. These are taken to be independent normal distributions, and the prior distributionsof $\\alpha$ ， $\\beta$ , and $\\delta$ are denoted $N(\\bar{\\alpha},\\Sigma_{\\alpha})$ ， $N(\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}},\\Sigma_{\\beta})$ , and $N(\\bar{\\delta},\\Sigma_{\\delta})$ , respectively. Together with normal distributions over the error terms, the normal priors mean that the distributions simulated by the estimation procedure are either normal or truncated normal, which significantly improves the numerical tractability of the model. In the estimation below, the prior distributions have means of zero and variances of 10. Other studies more carefully construct prior distributions (i.e., Geweke, Gowrisankaran, and Town (2003)), but here the primary goal is simply to use as uninformative a prior as possible while maintaining a proper posterior distribution. For all estimated parameters, the prior variances are at least 110 times greater than the posterior variance. This suggests that the prior is fairly uninformative, and that the posterior distributions and the estimated parameters primarily reflect information in the data.  \n\nFurther increases in the prior variances leave the estimated parameters and the empirical results largely unchanged.  \n\n## IV. Data Description  \n\nThe Venture Xpert data provided by SDC (now owned by Thomson Financial) are used for the estimation. SDC began compiling data on VC investments in 1977 and has supplemented their data with investments dating back to the early 1960s. These data are used in several previous studies of venture capital (e.g., Lerner (1995), Kaplan and Schoar (2005)). The completeness of the data are investigated by Gompers and Lerner (1999) and Kaplan, Sensoy, and Stromberg (2002), who find that the SDC data contain most VC investments and missing investments tend to be among the less significant ones.  \n\n### A. Description of Sample  \n\nThe full database contains 22,747 VC investments made between 1975 and 1995. I estimate the model using a restricted sample of these observations. In particular, the sample is restricted to investments received by young companies,12 with investments in restructurings or buy-outs of more mature companies eliminated. The sample contains only the first investment for each company, and in cases in which several investors participate in this round, the sample includes only the investment by the lead investor. This investor is identified as the VC firm that makes the largest total investment in the company.13 The sample is then restricted to investments made from 1982 to 1995. It takes companies several years to go public after the initial investment, and restricting the sample to investments up to the end of 1995 leaves companies 7 years to go public (the status of the companies is current as of March 2003). The 14-year-period ensures a sufficient sample size.  \n\nNext, I divide the investments in the sample into markets. Each market contains the investments in companies located in the same geographical state and receiving investments within the same half-year (January to June or July to December). The two states with the most VC investments are California (CA) and Massachusetts (MA), and the sample is restricted to companies located in these two states. This leaves 56 markets: two states, for 14 years, with two markets in each year. Finally, the sample is restricted to investments by VC firms that make a total of 10 or more investments in these 56 markets. This restriction ensures that the investors in the final sample are active VCs, and excludes investments by smaller, more idiosyncratic investors. The final sample consists of 75 investors and 1,666 investments in 1,666 companies.  \n\n# Table I Descriptive Statistics  \n\nReported figures are averages over the observed investments in the sample. The sample contains investments in 1,666 companies. The variable IPO equals one if the investment results in a public offering and zero otherwise. YEAR contains the year ofthe investment. FUND_SIZE is the amount of capital available to the investor, measured as the total amount of investments made by the fund. STATE equals zero if the company is located in Massachusetts and equals one if the company is located in California.

Description of Variables  \n\nDescriptive statistics of the variables are presented in Table I. In the model the two endogenous variables are the outcomes and the matching. The variable IPO, which records investment outcomes, equals one if the investment results in a public offering, and zero otherwise. This is a coarse measure of investment outcomes, but it is frequently used in the literature (i.e., Brander, Amit, and Antweiler (2002)). Gompers and Lerner (2000) compare this measure to broader measures that also include companies that are acquired or in registration. They find that the different measures give qualitatively similar results. The second endogenous variable is the matching of the investors and the companies. The identities of the VC and the company are observed, and this matching is observed directly in the data.  \n\nOnly a few coarse exogenous characteristics are observed for the sample companies. This reflects a general problem for studies of entrepreneurial companies. By nature, these companies have short operating and financial histories, and thus many important characteristics are difficult to summarize in a systematic way. The following variables are included in the analysis. First, YEAR captures the year of the investment. Second, STAGE contains the company's stage of development at the time of the investment. A company is an early-stage company when it is at the seed or start-up stage, and it is a late-stage company when it is at the expansion or later stage. This distinction roughly corresponds to whether the company has regular revenues or not.14 In the sample, $82\\%$ of the companies are early-stage companies. Third, INDUSTRY_GROUP divides the companies into six major industry groups: “Communications and Media,\" \"Computer Related,”“Semiconductors and other Electronics,”“Biotechnology, \"Medical, Health, and Life Sciences,” and “Other.\"  \n\nThe observed investor characteristics are the amount of available capital and investor experience. In particular, FUND_SIZE contains the size ofthe VC fund making the investment, measured in millions of dollars. VC firms are organized as collections of funds, and the funds are usually prevented from investing in the same companies to avoid conflicts of interests among the participants in different funds. The size of the individual fund is thus an appropriate measure of capital available for investing in a company. The fund size is defined as the sum of the fund's investments in the data.15 For a number of investments, only the firm and not the fund is disclosed. For these investments, the fund size is set to the average of the sizes of all the firm's funds.16  \n\nAt the time of each investment, TOTAL_EXPERIENCE measures the investor's experience by counting the number of investment rounds the VC firm has participated in since 1975. All investments in the unrestricted sample are counted, including investments in companies in all states, at all stages, across both initial and later rounds. Data for investments before 1975 are less accurate, but the VC industry was much smaller then. It expanded significantly after regulatory changes in the late 1970s, and relatively few investments are lost by excluding the earlier period. Note that since experience is calculated at the time of each investment, an investor's experience increases over the sample.  \n\nExperience is interpreted as a measure of an investor's ability to influence and add value to a company. Experienced investors may have greater ability for two reasons. First, participating in more investments allows investors to learn more about managing and monitoring companies and to expand their network with managers, suppliers, and customers. In this case, experience increases ability. Alternatively, investors may have an inherent ability, and to the extent investors with higher abilities are more likely to survive, greater experience signals higher inherent ability. While this distinction is interesting, it is not pursued here. The two reasons are not exclusive, and regardless of whether ability is caused by experience or ability causes experience, experience measures ability.  \n\nAlternative experience measures used in the literature are the age of the VC firm, the cumulative total amount invested, and the number of companies (see Gompers (1996) and Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu (2007). Age is a less attractive measure of investor ability, since it does not distinguish active and inactive investors. The number of investment rounds is also preferable to the number of companies, since some investors are involved at early stages and help companies develop and mature while others mainly invest at final stages. These two types of investors may invest in the same number of companies, but the experience of the first type is likely more relevant for influencing companies. These investors participate in more investment rounds in each company, and counting rounds rather than companies provides a simple adjustment for the involvement of the investors. Similarly, the number of investment rounds is preferable to the amount invested. Later rounds tend to involve larger amounts, and the latter measure emphasizes these rounds and is less indicative of VCs' ability.  \n\n## V. Empirical Findings  \n\nTo examine the relationship between the experience of the VCs and the outcome of their investments, the 1,666 companies are divided into 10 groups according to the experience of the investor. The first group contains companies with investors with experiences between 0 and 24, the second group contains companies with investors with experiences ranging from 25 to 49, and so forth up to the tenth and final group, which contains companies with investors with an experience greater than 225. In the sample, $95\\%$ of the investments are made by investors with an experience between 0 and 225. Figure 2 illustrates the number of companies in each group. Figure 3 illustrates the fraction of  \n\nNumber of Companies  \n\n![](images/c0782bda5b924126e07d77023ac113c8d18150724c7e7e9fe3ce5f07743d8b68.jpg)  \nFigure 2. Number of companies in each group. The 1,666 companies are grouped into 10 groups according to the experience of the investor. The figure illustrates the number of companies in each group.  \n\n![](images/8c750058e22bc3451ccada0ba32dca2dcb33ac0eaea0617a17073e709a93daeb.jpg)  \nFigure 3. IP0 rate in each group. The 1,666 companies are grouped into 10 groups according to the experience of the investor. The figure shows IPO rates of companies in each group.  \n\ncompanies in each group that go public, and it appears that investments made by experienced investors are more likely to go public. The group with the least experienced investors in the sample observes the lowest IPO rate at $19.6\\%$ .The highestIPOrate, $46.2\\%$ , is achieved by investors with experiences between 150 and 175. The decrease in the IPO rate for investors with higher experience is partly explained by the greater sampling variation due to the low number of observations for these investors. This evidence suggests a positive relationship between experience and investment outcomes.  \n\nThe experience of each investor increases over time, and thus investments by the same investor fall into increasingly higher groups. Ifthe IPO rates were also increasing over time, this would create a spurious relationship between the IPO rate and experience, similar to the pattern observed in Figure 3. The amount of capital available to an investor is also likely to increase with the investor's experience, and if, for some reason, the amount of capital contributes to the performance of the investments, this may also explain the observed pattern. To investigate these explanations, a Probit model is estimated. In this model, the probability that an investment results in a public offering is estimated as a function of the characteristics of the agents participating in the deal. Estimates of this model are presented in Tables II and II.  \n\nIn all specifications, investor experience enters positively and significantly. The first two specifications in Table II allow experience to enter linearly or in logs. The last specification allows the time of the investments to enter linearly rather than as individual year controls, and for this specification the standard errors are calculated both with and without clustering at the investor level.17 In all cases, investor experience has a positive and statistically significant effect on the outcome of the investment. Investments made by more experienced investors are thus more likely to result in public offerings.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>P-VAL 0.00*** 0.01*** P-VAL 0.01*** 0.04** Specification 3 (.000248) (690000'0) STD.

Using the estimates from Specification 1 in Table III, an investor without any experience has an estimated IPO rateof $21.4\\%$ , whereas the IPO rate for an investor with an experience of 225 is $38.9\\%$ . Thus, after controlling for the time and fund size, an investment by the more experienced investor is $82\\%$ more likely to succeed than the investment by the inexperienced investor, a substantial economic difference.  \n\nThe other coefficients in Tables II and III are not surprising. The amount of capital available to the investor has a small but significant positive effect on the investment outcome. In the specifications that include the location of the company (CA or MA), location has no effect on the outcome. More surprisingly, the year of the financing has little effect on the outcomes. In Specifications 1 and 2 in Table IHl, the year of the investment enters through controls for the individual years (the base year is 1982), and no apparent trend in the estimated coefficients obtains. In Specification 3, the time of the investment enters as a linear time trend, and the estimated coefficient is insignificant. There is no indication that the IPO rate increases with the development of the venture capital industry through this period, and there is only weak evidence that companies receiving their first financing at the end of the sample period are less likely to go public because of the subsequent downturn in the market. Apparently, the growth in the VC market over the sample period has followed proportional growth in the number of companies going public.  \n\n### A.Specification of Structural Model  \n\nEstimation of the structural model is numerically intensive, and only parsimonious specifications are numerically tractable. First, STATE, which indicates the location of the company, is insignificant in all specifications of the Probit model, and thus this variable is excluded from the estimation of the structural model.18 Next, a comparison of Specification 1 and Specification 2 in Table II suggests that letting experience enter linearly or taking the logarithm of experience is immaterial, and thus just the linear specification is estimated below. Further, there is no apparent time trend in the data, and thus the individual year dummies are replaced with a linear time variable. Finally, the structural model is derived using a simple error structure that excludes correlations between the error terms for different matches involving the same company or investor. In particular, one may suspect some correlation between investments made by the same investor. To provide one measure of the magnitude of this correlation, the Probit model in Specification 3 of Table II is estimated both with and without clustering of the error terms at the venture capital firm level. There is no indication that imposing the simpler error structure substantially affects the estimates of the model.  \n\n### B. Sorting on Observed Variables  \n\nFrom an econometric perspective there are two distinct kinds of sorting, sorting on observed variables and sorting on unobserved variables. Sorting on observed variables is straightforward to verify. Table IV presents three regressions of investor experience on the observable characteristics of the companies. Late-stage and biotechnology companies have investors with significantly more experience than other companies. In Specification 1, an investor in a late-stage company has an experience that is 19 larger than an investor in an early-stage company. This difference is $28\\%$ of the average experience, which corresponds to 69.6 past investments. On average, an investor in a biotechnology company has an experience of 12 more past investments than an investor in the “Other\" category. This difference is $17\\%$ of the sample average. Experience is increasing over time, and companies later in the data have more experienced investors. Including the average experience of the investors in the market in the regression (Specifications 2 and 3) ensures that the estimated coefficients capture sorting within each market rather than a general trend towards late-stage and biotechnology investments.  \n\n# Table IV OLS Estimates  \n\nThe table presents coefficients from three OLS regressions.

Specification 1 does not include the observed characteristics of the companies, and hence the estimated coefficient reflects the total effect, including sorting on both observed and unobserved variables and investor influence. Specifications 2 and 3 include the observed characteristics of the companies in the specification. By including these characteristics, the estimates control for sorting on observable variables. As the table reports, late-stage companies and companies in the biotechnology industry are more likely to go public, and the estimated effect of experience now captures only the sorting on the unobserved variables and investor influence. The decrease in the estimated coefficient on experience when moving from Specification 1 to Specifications 2 and 3 measures the effect of the sorting on the observed variables on the outcome of the investment. This effect is small, at roughly one-tenth of the total effect of experience, and it is smaller than one standard error of the estimated coefficient. As argued above, the observed company characteristics are coarse, and it is not surprising that sorting on these characteristics is less important than sorting on the unobserved characteristics.  \n\nThe estimate ofthe valuation equation of the structural model provides additional evidence of sorting on the observed variables. Estimates of this equation are presented in the lower half of Table V. The valuations represent the agents' preferences over matches, and the estimated coefficients in the valuation equation represent the agents′ preferences over the characteristics included in the equation.  \n\nThe estimated coefficient on experience is positive and statistically significant.19 Matches with investors with greater experience have higher valuations and are more attractive on average. Depending on the interpretation of experience, this may be because experienced investors have acquired better skills, or because experience signals higher inherent ability. Clearly, companies have additional information about investors, and any given investor may be more or less attractive than indicated by their experience. However, on average, companies prefer investors with higher experience.  \n\nIn Table V, the positive and significant coefficients on the stage and biotechnology variables show that VCs prefer late-stage and biotechnology companies to other companies. Taken together, the findings that companies prefer more experienced investors and that investors prefer late-stage and biotechnology companies imply that there is sorting in the market, with more experienced investors investing in late-stage and biotechnology companies. This is consistent with the regression of experience on company characteristics in TableIV.  \n\nIt is not obvious how to interpret the coefficients in the valuation equation. As in a Probit model, the coefficients are only identified up to scale, and they are normalized by the variance of the error term. In a Probit model, the  \n\n# TableV Bayesian Estimates of Structural Model  \n\nThe table presents Bayesian estimates of the parameters in the two equations in the structural model.

DEV. are, respectively, the mean, median, and standard deviation of the simulated posterior distributions of the parameters. The reported coefficients for the outcome equation are normalized to be comparable to standard Probit estimates. dF/dX is the marginal effect. The marginal effects are evaluated at the mean of the posterior. The marginal effects for variables marked° are effects of a discrete change. dP/dW is the marginal change in the probability of preferring one of two otherwise identical matches with a change in the variable (the precise definition is in the text). Estimates are based on 1,20o,000 simulations of the posterior distribution. The initial 40o,0o0 simulations are discarded for burn-in. \\*，\\*， $\\mathrm{and^{****}}$ denote that zero is not contained in the $10\\%$ $5\\%$ and $1\\%$ credible interval,respectively.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>MEAN</td><td>MEDIAN</td><td>dF/dX</td><td>dP/dw</td><td>STD.

An analogous concept is derived here for the matching model. Consider an investor facing a choice between two companies. If the companies have identical observed characteristics, the choice depends entirely on the unobserved factors, and the probability that the investor prefers one tothe other is $50\\%$ . If one of these otherwise identical companies is a latestage company and the other is an early-stage company, the coefficients in the valuation equation predict that the probability that the investor prefers the late-stage company is $54.7\\%$ . The marginal increase in the probability is $4.7\\%$  \n\nThese marginal probabilities are presented in Table V in the dP/dW column.20 The probability that the investor prefers to invest in a biotechnology company relative to a company in the “Other\" industry group is $57.9\\%$ .From the perspective of a company comparing two otherwise identical investors, one of which has one additional unit of experience, the company prefers the experienced investor with probability $50.82\\%$ . The marginal increase of $0.82\\%$ translates into a preference for an investor with an experience of 225 relative to an investor with no experience with probability $86.7\\%$ . These numbers indicate that companies have stronger preferences over investors with different degrees of experience than investors have over companies at different stages and in different industries. This is not surprising. Experience is a more direct measure of an investor's ability and is closely tied to companies' preferences. The stage and industry of a company are, at best, indirect measures of quality, and these characteristics appear to be less important for investors? preferences.  \n\n### C. Sorting on Unobserved Variables  \n\nSorting on unobserved variables is captured by the error term in the valuation equation. When experienced investors invest in companies with better unobserved characteristics, the error terms in the valuations of their matches are greater on average. The vertical axis of Figure 4 plots the average of the error terms in the valuations of the companies each investor invests in. A high value means that the investor invests in companies with better unobserved variables. To reduce the noise in the figure, only investors that make at least two investments in the market are included. On the horizontal axis is the relative experience of the investor, given as the percentile rank of the investor's experience in the market. The investor with the highest experience in the market has a relative experience of one.  \n\nFigure 4 shows an increasing relationshipbetween the error terms and the investors? relative experience. Investors with relatively higher experience can invest in companies with better unobserved characteristics, and this reflects the sorting on the unobserved variables. In Figure 4, the average of the error terms for investors between the 75th and 100th percentiles is 1.6, and the average for investors between 0 and the 25th percentiles is 0.8. Not only are more experienced investors more likely to invest in the more attractive latestage and biotechnology companies (reflecting sorting on observed variables), but moving from the bottom quartile to the top quartile in terms of experience increases the unobserved valuation of the investments by roughly 0.8 $\\left(=1.6-\\right.$ 0.8). This increase is comparable to the coefficients in the valuation equation. In particular, it is almost twice the valuation gained from investing in a late-stage  \n\nAverage of Error Term  \n\n![](images/d6b2b77e540d67413ae31913e7d1a912ee5e5d3b1832c33d1f3149ecbac261a6.jpg)  \nFigure 4. Error terms of matched pairs. For each investor in each market, the average of the error terms in the valuation equation is plotted as a function of the investor's experience relative to the other investors in the same market. Relative experience is the investor's experience as a percentile of the experience of all the investors in the market. For the most experienced investor in the market, the relative experience is one. The average is calculated as the average of the error terms in the matches that are made by the investor. Only investors who participate in two or more matches in the market are included in the figure.  \n\nand biotech company, $0.1657+0.2808=0.45$ (see Table V), and the magnitude of sorting on unobserved variables appears to be at least as significant as the sorting on observed variables.  \n\n### D. Testing for Sorting on Unobserved Variables  \n\nThe correlation between the error terms in the valuation and outcome equations provides a statistical measure of the sorting on unobserved variables. When an unobserved variable affects the outcome in a positive way, the error term in the outcome equation is positive. When this variable is recognized in the valuation, the error term in the valuation equation is also positive, and sorting on unobserved variables causes a positive correlation between these two error terms. Absent sorting on unobserved variables, the two error terms would be independent. Thus, a statistical test for sorting is to test whether the covariance between the error terms is significantly greater than zero. The covariance is normalized to being positive, and the appropriate test is a one-sided test. In Table V, the covariance is 0.22, which is statistically greater than zero at $1\\%$ level (one-sided). The hypothesis of no sorting on unobserved variables is therefore rejected.  \n\n### E. Estimating Influence  \n\nThe coefficients in the outcome equation (in Table V) estimate the dependence of the outcome on the agent's characteristics after controlling for sorting in the market. The coefficient on experience is positive and significant, which provides direct evidence of investor influence. The marginal effect of experience is 0.000346. An investment by an investor with no experience in an average company leads to a public offering with probability $14.3\\%$ . Holding the company fixed but replacing the investor with an investor that has an experience of 225 increases the IPO rate to $22.5\\%$ . The influence of the more experienced investor increases the probability of going public by $57.3\\%$ , a substantial improvement.  \n\nThe other estimated parameters in the outcome equation are not surprising. Fund size has a small but significant positive effect on the investment outcomes. Late-stage companies have a $4.9\\%$ larger probability of going public than earlystage companies. In the sample, biotechnology is the best performing industry, and the average biotechnology company has a $39\\%$ larger probability of going public than the average company in the “Other” industry group.  \n\nOn average, experienced investors bring companies public at a higher rate, but one may suspect individual variation across investors’ skill. To determine the magnitude of the individual components, a fixed investor effect is included in the specification. Unfortunately, the computational requirements of the model increase with the number of explanatory variables, and it is not possible to include separate effects for all 75 investors. Instead, fixed effects are included for the five most experienced investors in the sample. This specification is Specification 3 in Table VI. The estimated coefficients provide evidence of significant differences in the performance of individual investors. Specifically, INV1, the most experienced investor, and INV3, the third most experienced investor, achieve significantly better outcomes than the other investors (the base group is the 70 remaining investors); INV2 and INV4 are performance neutral, and INV5 underperforms relative to the other investors. The economic magnitudes are significant. Matching with INV1 increases the IPO rate by $17\\%$ and matching with INV5 decreases the IPO rate by $14\\%$ relative to the average investor with similar experience. This preliminary result suggests that there is a strong investor-specific component, and thus that the choice of a particular investor is important for companies.  \n\nThe finding that more experienced investors have substantialinfluence on investment outcomes complements previous empirical studies ofVCs. Hellmann and Puri (2000, 2002) compare companies that receive VC financing to other companies and find that VC-backed companies bring products to market sooner and replace management faster. However, due to endogeneity, it is not obvious whether these differences are caused by the VCs, or whether VCs favor investments in companies with products closer to shipping and with management that is easier to replace. The results here suggest that within a narrow group of VCs (i.e., rather than comparing VC to non-VC investments) there are substantial differences in influence. These differences are likely greater when comparing VCs to other investors, since these investors differ along institutional and organizational dimensions in addition to experience.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>STD.

If estimates of the Probit model in Tables II and III were interpreted as investor influence (implicitly assuming no sorting on unobserved characteristics), the impact of experience would be overstated by as muchas $90\\%$ . In the Probit analysis that controls for all observable characteristics (Table II1, Specification 2) the marginal effect of experience is 0.000657. The correct marginal effect from the outcome equation is 0.000346 (Table V), and if the first estimate were interpreted as influence, it would overestimate the effect by as much as $90\\%$  \n\n### F. Relative Magnitudes of Influence and Sorting  \n\nThe total effect of experience is now decomposed into the effect of sorting and the effect of influence. In Figure 5, experience is on the horizontal axis and the IPO rate is on the vertical axis. The solid line represents the observed IPO rate as a function of investor experience, and is calculated from the Probit estimates (Specification 1 in Table II). The slope reflects the total effect of influence and sorting. The broken line represents the IPO rate and is calculated from the estimates of the outcome equation (Table V). It reflects the IPO rate for an average company when matched with investors with different levels of experience. If the matching of the investors and the companies were random, there would be no sorting, and the two lines would be on top of each other.  \n\n![](images/1c388517ee15649b0c0cbeadf422433b80a1018eb7a4e7f6ee5e8f08f2f866cf.jpg)  \nFigure 5. Decomposition of influence and sorting. The figure shows the IPO rates from the Probit model (Specification 1 in Table III) and the outcome equation of the structural model (Table V). The solid line indicates the IPO rate predicted by the Probit model. This rate is the empirical rate of the IPOs observed in the sample. The broken line represents the IPO rate from the outcome equation ofthe structural model. This is the IPO rate after controlling for the selection of the investments, and it represents the rate that would be observed if an average company were randomly assigned to investors with different degrees of experience.  \n\nIn Figure 5, the distances $A$ and $B$ represent the impact of the sorting on the IPO rate, and distance $C$ represents the impact of influence on the IPO rate. The effect of sorting differs for more and less experienced investors. For experienced investors, sorting leads to better matches and higher IPO rates than if the matching were random. For inexperienced investors, the effect is ambiguous. On the one hand, sorting leaves inexperienced investors with a smaller set of feasible investments, as the experienced investors pick the best companies. On the other hand, sorting leads inexperienced investors to make better investments from this smaller set of feasible investments. The first effect is negative and the second is positive, and relative to a market with random investments, inexperienced investors can be either better or worse off. In Figure 5, the distance $A$ is positive, which suggests that the positive effect dominates. However, this finding is particularly sensitive to the limitations in the error structure, and should be interpreted with caution.  \n\nFor an investor with zero experience, sorting raises the IPO rate from $14.3\\%$ to $21.5\\%$ , represented by the distance $A$ . For an investor with an experience of 225, sorting raises the IPO rate from $22.5\\%$ to $38.8\\%$ relative to random matching. This increase is represented by the distance $B$ in Figure 5. The increase in the IPO rate for the experienced investor is $16.3\\%$ , which is more than twice the increase of $7.2\\%$ for the inexperienced investor. The influence of the more experienced investors is represented by the distance $C$ . Absent sorting, an inexperienced investor would have an IPO rate of $14.3\\%$ and an investor with an experience of 225 would have an IPO rate of $22.5\\%$ when investing in an average company. Here the company is held constant, and thus the increase of $8.2\\%$ measures the influence of the experienced investor. Comparing these numbers gives us a first estimate of the relative impact of sorting and influence. For an investor with an experience of 225, the combined effect raises the IPO rate from $14.3\\%$ to $38.8\\%$ , represented by $B$ plus $C$ . Influence accounts for 8.2 of the percentage points (represented by $C$ ) and sorting accounts for the remaining $16.3\\%$ (represented by $B$ ). Thus, roughly speaking, influence explains one-third and sorting explains the remaining two-thirds of the increase in the IPO rate when moving from the least to the most experienced investor.  \n\n### G. Comparing Coeffcients in Outcome and Valuation Equations  \n\nIt is interesting to note the relationship between the coefficients in the outcome and valuation equations. Both equations are only identified up to scale, and only the relative magnitudes of the coefficients are comparable. The structural empirical model does not impose any relationship between the coefficients in these two equations, and they are estimated from different endogenous variables. The outcome equation is estimated from the observed outcomes, whereas the valuation equation is estimated from the latent valuations, which are determined by the observed matches. Nothing inherent in the model or estimation leads these coefficients to be similar.  \n\nHowever, the economic assumptions underlying the model suggest that the coefficients are related. When investors and companies generate preferences and valuations from a fixed sharing rule, matches with better outcomes have higher valuations. This appears consistent with the estimated coefficients. All coefficients in the two equations have the same signs, and their relative magnitudes are somewhat similar. For example, in the valuation equation, “Biotechnology” is the most attractive and “Computer Related\" is the least attractive of the industries, and this ranking also holds in the outcome equation. This supports the model and the interpretation of the valuations as the NPV of the individual matches.  \n\n### H. Alternative Market Definitions  \n\nIn the structural model, the definition of a market is somewhat arbitrary. Table VII presents estimates of the model with alternative market definitions. Specifically, the model is estimated with four different market definitions, and the estimated coefficients are remarkably robust. In the baseline specification, a market contains investments during the same half-year in companies located in the same state (either CA or MA). In the second specification, a market is extended to a whole year rather than a half-year. In the third specification, California and Massachusetts are treated as the same market, and in the final specification a market lasts a whole year and California and Massachusetts are considered the same market. The estimated coefficients on stage and industry, and their standard errors, are robust to the different market definitions. The coefficient on experience varies between 0.0011 and 0.0014, and no apparent pattern emerges in the estimated coefficients.  \n\nEstimating the model with different market definitions provides a heuristic test of the identifying assumptions of the model. The critical identifying assumption is that investors and companies are exogenously assigned to different markets. This assumption would fail if investors and companies choose to participate in a market based on the unobserved characteristics of other agents in the market. For example, if California has particularly good companies, this could attract Massachusetts investors. Essentially, this means that investors sort between the two states, as well as within each of them, and a more appropriate market definition would treat the two states as being the same market. The results in Table VII show that changing the market definition in this way leaves the estimated coefficients largely unaffected. Similarly, investors and companies may attempt to time the market and increase their activity when the market is particularly good. This corresponds to temporal sorting. Again, Table VlI shows that extending the market definition temporally leaves the results largely unchanged. Overall, this informal test provides no indication that the identifying assumptions are violated or that the analysis is sensitive to the particular market definition.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Expanded Years and States MEAN STD.

Summary and Conclusions  \n\nThis paper develops new econometric methods to analyze the market for venture capital investments. It finds that companies with experienced investors are more likely to go public. This follows both from the influence of these investors and from sorting in the market. Influence means that experienced investors add more value than inexperienced investors. Sorting means that experienced investors invest in companies that are inherently better, and hence are associated with higher IPO rates. The results show that both sorting and influence are significant. Companies prefer experienced investors, investors prefer investments in late-stage and biotechnology companies, and these agents tend to match. Sorting also occurs based on variables that are unobserved in the data. These variables include, for example, the unobserved quality of the management team or the product. Not surprisingly, sorting on unobserved variables is at least as strong as sorting on observed variables.  \n\nDistinguishing influence and sorting is important for understanding venture capital. VCs tend to emphasize their influence and ability to work with entrepreneurs, while some entrepreneurs are less enthusiastic, some even claiming that VCs are merely \"Vulture Capitalists,” offering expensive financing and little else. The results suggest that good VCs have substantial positive influence on companies. However, the analysis considers the 75 most active VCs, and these are probably more influential than the average VC. The results indicate a decline in the influence within this sample, and extrapolating suggests that some inexperienced investors offer very little influence, in which case the epithet above may be appropriate for these investors. Of course, sorting means that entrepreneurs who are funded by these VCs are not the most promising entrepreneurseither.  \n\nThe analysis leaves interesting questions unanswered. One may ask, for instance, whether VC financing is more important for certain kinds of firms. In the specification of the outcome equation, experience enters linearly and influence applies equally to all firms. In principle, more flexible specifications can measure synergies between certain investors and entrepreneurs. However, data and computational tractability are limiting factors.  \n\nIt is also tempting to consider the efficiency of the VC market. In the structural model, the matching is inefficient, since it does not maximize the sum of the valuations. The source of the inefficiency is the restriction on transfers, and with unrestricted transfers the equilibrium would maximize this sum. It is possible to estimate the potential improvement in the valuations, but this is unlikely to give a good measure of inefficiencies for several reasons. First, for this analysis of efficiency the assumption of transferability is critical. The assumption imposes a market failure on the model, and the inefficiency is assumed rather than estimated. For the present analysis, it is sufficient that the matching model provides a good approximation of the sorting, even if the valuations are not exactly correct. Second, the main inefficiencies in this market may be institutional rather than artifacts of the matching. Sahlman (1990) argues that the contractual and organizational structures are primarily designed to overcome problems with agency, informational asymmetries, and illiquidity. Investigating the efficiency of the VC market is interesting but must address a broader range of concerns than just matching.  \n\nFinally, the empirical matching model is of independent interest, and it may help further our understanding of other markets with sorting and influence. Some examples are the labor market and the matching of employers and employees, the lending market and the matching of borrower and lenders, the market for corporate mergers and the matching of acquirers and targets, and the market for education and the matching of schools and students (see Roth and Sotomayor (1990)). A better understanding of these markets hinges on distinguishing sorting and influence, in their various forms.  \n\n## Appendix: Estimation Procedure  \n\nThe model is estimated using Bayesian estimation based on MCMC simulation, which has attractive properties for estimating discrete choice models (Geweke, Keane, and Runkle (1994)). Albert and Chib (1993) and Tanner and Wong (1987) show that treating latent variables as parameters significantly simplifies simulation of the resulting augmented posterior distribution, and the MCMC procedure known as Gibbs sampling (Gelfand and Smith (1990), Geweke (1999)) can simulate this distribution. The procedure is iterative. Each iteration produces a draw from a Markov chain, and under weak regularity conditions that are satisfied here (Roberts and Smith (1994)), the simulated distribution converges to the augmented posterior distribution. The Markov chain is generated by drawing each individual dimension of the joint target distribution conditional on the draws of the other dimensions, and the simulated univariate conditional distributions are derived below.  \n\nFor notation, let the markets be indexed by $m=1,\\ldots,N$ . Let $V_{m}\\equiv\\{V_{i j}$ ， $i j\\in$ $M_{m}\\}$ and ${Y_{m}^{*}}\\equiv\\{Y_{i j},i j\\in\\mu_{m}\\}$ be the latent valuation and outcome variables in market $m$ , and let $V$ and $Y^{*}$ contain these variables in al markets. Let $Y_{-i j}^{*}$ contain all outcome variables except $Y_{i j}$ , and define $V_{-i j}$ similarly. Let $W_{i j}$ denote the vector of exogenous variables in the valuation equation for the match between investor $i$ and company $j$ .Let $W_{m}\\equiv\\{W_{i j}$ ， $i j\\in M_{m}\\}$ contain these variables in market $m$ , and let $W\\equiv\\{W_{m}$ ， $m=1,\\ldots,N\\}$ contain these variables in all markets. Define $X_{i j},X_{m}$ , and $X$ similarly for the exogenous variables in the outcome equation. Similarly, define the outcome variables $I P O_{i j}$ $I P O_{m}$ , and IPO, and the variables containing the matchings, $\\mu_{i j},\\mu_{m}$ , and $\\mu$ (here, $\\mu_{i j}$ is a binary variable that equals one when the match is formed, and $\\mu_{m}$ is a subset of $M_{m}$ ). Let $\\boldsymbol\\theta\\equiv(\\alpha,\\beta,\\delta)$ contain the parameters of the model. Finally, the densities defined by the model are denoted $\\phi$ and the densities derived for the simulation are denoted $\\pi$  \n\nThe latent outcome variables are defined for all $i j\\in M_{m}$ . It would be natural to define $Y_{m}\\equiv\\{Y_{i j},i j\\in M_{m}\\}$ , instead of just $Y_{m}^{*}\\equiv\\{Y_{i j}$ $i j\\in\\mu_{m}\\}$ .However, because the model imposes no restrictions on the outcome variables for the unobserved matches, these can be “integrated out.\" The star superscript denotes the restriction to observed matches. This integration does not change the posterior distribution or the estimated parameters, but it reduces the number of simulated variables and it causes slight changes in the distributions derived below.  \n\nThe prior distribution is a normal distribution. Let the prior density be denoted $\\phi_{0}(\\theta)$ . This density is given by  \n\n$$\n\\phi_{0}(\\theta)=C\\times\\exp\\big(-0.5(\\theta-\\theta_{0})^{\\prime}\\Sigma_{\\theta}^{-1}(\\theta-\\theta_{0})\\big),\n$$  \n\nwhere, here and below, $C$ is a generic normalizing constant that ensures densities integrate to one. The matrix $\\Sigma_{\\theta}$ is the covariance matrix of the prior distribution, and in all estimated specifications it is 10 times the identity matrix. Further increases in the prior variance leave estimated parameters largely unchanged. Corresponding to the parameters, the covariance matrix is decomposed into $\\Sigma_{\\alpha},\\Sigma_{\\beta}$ ,and $\\Sigma_{\\delta}$  \n\nThe error term in the outcome equation can be decomposed into orthogonal terms as $\\varepsilon_{i j}=\\eta_{i j}\\delta+\\xi_{i j}$ , where the joint distribution of $\\xi_{i j}$ and $\\eta_{i j}$ is  \n\n$$\n\\binom{\\xi_{i j}}{\\eta_{i j}}\\sim N\\left(0,\\binom{1}{0}\\begin{array}{c c}{0}\\ {1}\\end{array}\\right).\n$$  \n\nThis is without loss of generality, as the joint distribution of $(\\varepsilon_{i j},\\eta_{i j})$ is still given by equation (15). Let $\\phi_{m}(V_{m},Y_{m}^{*}\\mid\\theta,X_{m},W_{m})$ be the density of the latent variables defined by the valuation and outcome equations. The valuation equation implies $\\eta_{i j}=V_{i j}^{\\prime}-W_{i j}^{\\prime}\\alpha$ and the density of the latent variables in market $m$ is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle\\phi_{m}\\bigl(V_{m},Y_{m}^{*}\\mid\\theta,X_{m},W_{m}\\bigr)=C\\times\\prod_{i j\\in{\\cal M}_{m}}\\exp\\bigl(-0.5(V_{i j}-W_{i j}^{\\prime}\\alpha)^{2}\\bigr)}\\ {\\displaystyle\\times\\prod_{i j\\in\\mu_{m}}\\exp\\bigl(-0.5\\bigl(Y_{i j}^{*}-X_{i j}^{\\prime}\\beta-(V_{i j}-W_{i j}^{\\prime}\\alpha)\\delta\\bigr)^{2}\\bigr).}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe augmented posterior density is proportional to the product of the prior density, some appropriate indicator functions, and the density of the latent variables given above. It is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle\\phi\\big(V,Y^{*},\\theta|I P O,\\mu,X,W\\big)}\\ {\\quad=C\\times\\phi_{o}(\\theta)\\times1[\\delta\\ge0]}\\ {\\displaystyle\\quad\\times\\prod_{m=1}^{N}\\big(1\\big[Y_{m}^{*}\\in\\Gamma_{I P O_{m}}\\big]\\times1[V_{m}\\in\\Gamma_{\\mu_{m}}]\\times\\phi_{m}\\big(V_{m},Y_{m}^{*}\\big|\\theta,X_{m},W_{m}\\big)\\big),}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\Gamma_{I P O_{m}}\\equiv\\{Y_{m}^{*}|I P O_{i j}=1[Y_{i j}^{*}\\geq0],\\forall i j\\in\\mu_{m}\\}$ contains the restriction on the latent outcome variables imposed by the outcome equation. It is analogous to the restriction on the latent valuation variables imposed by $\\Gamma_{\\mu_{m}}$ .The conditional  \n\ndensities derived below are all proportional to selected factors in the density in equation(A4).  \n\n### A. Conditional Distributions of Outcome Variables  \n\nThe conditional augmented posterior density for each latent outcome variable is proportional to the two terms this variable enters in $\\phi$ in equation (A4). The first is in the indicator function $1[Y_{m}^{*}\\in\\Gamma_{I P O_{m}}]$ , and the second is the corresponding term in $\\phi_{m}$ from equation (A3). There are two cases. When $I P O_{i j}$ equals one, the indicator function $1[Y_{m}^{*}\\in\\Gamma_{I P O_{m}}]$ equals one when $Y_{i j}^{*}$ is nonnegative (conditional on the other outcome variables being in $\\Gamma_{I P O_{m}}$ ), and the density of the conditional distribution is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\pi\\left(Y_{i j}^{*}\\mid V,Y_{-i j}^{*},\\theta,I P O,\\mu,W,X\\right)}\\ &{\\quad=C\\times1\\big[Y_{i j}^{*}\\ge0\\big]\\times\\exp\\bigl(-0.5\\big(Y_{i j}^{*}-X_{i j}^{\\prime}\\beta-(V_{i j}-W_{i j}^{\\prime}\\alpha)\\delta\\big)^{2}\\bigr),}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThis is the normal distribution $N(X_{i j}^{\\prime}\\beta+(V_{i j}-W_{i j}^{\\prime}\\alpha)\\delta,1)$ truncated from below at zero. When $I P O_{i j}$ equals zero, the distribution is the same normal distribution, now truncated from above at zero.  \n\n### B.Conditional Distributions of Valuation Variables  \n\nThe conditional augmented posterior distribution of $V_{i j}$ depends on whether investor $i$ and company $j$ are matched or not. When $i j\\notin\\mu_{m}$ , the density is simply  \n\n$$\n\\pi(V_{i j}|V_{-i j},Y^{*},\\theta,I P O,\\mu,X,W)=C\\times1[V_{i j}\\leq\\bar{V}_{i j}]\\times\\exp\\bigl(-0.5(V_{i j}-W_{i j}^{\\prime}\\alpha)^{2}\\bigr).\n$$  \n\nWhen $i j\\in\\mu_{m}$ , the outcome of the match is observed. Correlation between the error terms means that the outcome contains additional information about the valuation, and the conditional density is  \n\n$$\n\\pi(V_{i j}|V_{-i j},Y^{*},\\theta,I P O,\\mu,X,W)=C\\times{\\bf1}[V_{i j}\\geq V_{i j}]\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\times\\exp\\left(-0.5\\left(V_{i j}-W_{i j}^{\\prime}\\alpha-\\frac{\\left(Y_{i j}^{\\ast}-X_{i j}^{\\prime}\\beta\\right)\\delta}{1+\\delta^{2}}\\right)^{2}\\times(1+\\delta^{2})\\right).\n$$  \n\nBoth of these distributions are truncated normal distributions. The first is $N(W_{i j}^{\\prime}\\alpha,1)$ truncated from above at $\\bar{V}_{i j}$ . The second is $N(W_{i j}^{\\prime}\\alpha+(Y_{i j}^{*}-$ $X_{i j}^{\\prime}\\beta)\\delta/(1+\\delta^{2}),1/(1+\\delta^{2}))$ truncated from below at $\\underline{{V}}_{i j}$ . The expressions for $\\bar{V}_{i j}$ and $\\underline{{V}}_{i j}$ are given in equations (5) and (6).  \n\n### C. Conditional Distributions of Parameters  \n\nThe conditional distributions ofthe parameters are normal distributions. The distributions of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are not truncated. The distribution of $\\delta$ is truncated from below at zero to normalize the sign of the valuation equation. Each parameter enters all the terms in $\\phi$ , and the derivation of the distributions requires \"completing the square\" in a product of normal densities. To illustrate, let $\\gamma$ be a random vector with density  \n\n$$\n\\pi(\\gamma)=C_{1}\\times\\exp(-0.5(\\gamma^{\\prime}M_{\\gamma}\\gamma+2\\gamma^{\\prime}N_{\\gamma}+C_{2})).\n$$  \n\nHere, $M_{\\gamma}$ is a corresponding matrix and $N_{\\gamma}$ is a corresponding vector (naturally, $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ could be combined into the single normalizing constant $C=C_{1}\\times\\exp(-0.5C_{2}))$ . Completing the square in this expression shows that the distribution of $\\gamma$ is the normal distribution $N(-M_{\\gamma}^{-1}N_{\\gamma},M_{\\gamma}^{-1})$  \n\nCollecting terms in $\\phi$ involving $\\alpha$ gives $\\pi(\\alpha\\mid V,Y^{*},\\beta,\\delta,I P\\dot{O},\\mu,X,W)$ . This distribution is determined by $M_{a}$ and $N_{a}$ as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{M_{\\alpha}=\\Sigma_{\\alpha}^{-1}+\\displaystyle\\sum_{m=1}^{N}\\left[\\displaystyle\\sum_{i j\\in M_{m}}W_{i j}W_{i j}^{\\prime}+\\displaystyle\\sum_{i j\\in\\mu_{m}}\\delta^{2}W_{i j}W_{i j}^{\\prime}\\right]}\\ &{N_{\\alpha}=-\\Sigma_{\\alpha}^{-1}\\bar{\\alpha}+\\displaystyle\\sum_{m=1}^{N}\\left[\\displaystyle\\sum_{i j\\in M_{m}}-W_{i j}V_{i j}+\\displaystyle\\sum_{i j\\in\\mu_{m}}\\delta W_{i j}\\big(Y_{i j}^{*}-X_{i j}^{\\prime}\\beta-V_{i j}\\delta\\big)\\right].}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nSimilarly, collecting terms in $\\phi$ involving $\\beta$ gives  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{{\\cal M}_{\\beta}=\\Sigma_{\\beta}^{-1}+\\displaystyle\\sum_{m=1}^{N}\\sum_{i j\\in\\mu_{m}}X_{i j}X_{i j}^{\\prime}}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{\\cal N}_{\\beta}=-\\Sigma_{\\beta}^{-1}\\bar{\\beta}-\\displaystyle\\sum_{m=1}^{N}\\sum_{i j\\in\\mu_{m}}X_{i j}\\big(Y_{i j}^{*}-V_{i j}\\delta+W_{i j}^{\\prime}\\alpha\\delta\\big).}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFinally, for $\\delta$ , collecting terms gives  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{{\\cal M}_{\\delta}=\\Sigma_{\\delta}^{-1}+\\displaystyle\\sum_{m=1}^{N}\\sum_{i j\\in\\mu_{m}}(V_{i j}-W_{i j}\\alpha)^{2}}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{\\cal N}_{\\delta}=-\\Sigma_{\\delta}^{-1}\\bar{\\delta}-\\displaystyle\\sum_{m=1}^{N}\\sum_{i j\\in\\mu_{m}}\\big(Y_{i j}^{*}-X_{i j}^{\\prime}\\beta\\big)(V_{i j}-W_{i j}^{\\prime}\\alpha).}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe conditional distribution of $\\delta$ is $N(-N_{\\delta}/M_{\\delta},1/M_{\\delta})$ , truncated from below at zero.  \n\nREFERENCES   \nAckerberg, Daniel, and Maristella Botticini, 2002, Endogenous matching and the empirical determinants of contract form, Journal of Political Economy 110, 564-591.   \nAdmati, Anat, and Paul Pfleiderer, 1994, Robust financial contracting and the role of venture capitalists, Journal of Finance 49, 371-402.   \nAlbert, James, and Siddhartha Chib, 1993, Bayesian analysis of binary and polychotomous response data, Journal of the American Statistical Association 88, 669-679.   \nBarry, Christopher, Chris Muscarella, John Peavy, and Michael Vetsuypens, 1990, The role of venture capital in the creation of public companies: Evidence from the going-public process, Journal of Financial Economics 27, 447-472.   \nBerger, James, 1993, Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis (Springer-Verlag, New York).   \nBerry, Steve, James Levinsohn, and Ariel Pakes, 1995, Automobile prices in market equilibrium, Econometrica 63, 841-890.   \nBrander, James, Raphael Amit, and Werner Antweiler, 2002, Venture-capital syndication: Improved venture selection vs. the value-added hypothesis, Journal of Economics and Management Strategy 11, 423-452.   \nBresnahan, Timothy, 1987, Competition and collusion in the American automobile industry: The 1955 price war, Journal of Industrial Economics 335, 457-482.   \nBresnahan, Timothy, and Peter Reiss, 1991, Econometric models of discrete games, Journal of Econometrics 48,57-81.   \nCasamatta, Catherine, 2003, Financing and advising: Optimal financial contracts with venture capitalists, Journal of Finance 58, 2059-2085.   \nCorneli Francesca, and Oved Yosha, 2003, Stage financing and the role of convertible securities, Review of Economic Studies 70, 1-32.   \nGale, David, and Lloyd Shapley, 1962, College admissions and the stability of marriage, American Mathematical Monthly 69, 9-15.   \nGelfand, Alan, and Adrian Smith, 1990, Sampling based approaches to calculating marginal densities, Journal of the American Statistical Association 85, 398-409.   \nGeweke, John, 1999, Using simulation methods for Bayesian econometric models: Inference, development, and communication (with discussion and rejoinder), Econometric Reviews 18, 1-126.   \nGeweke, John, Gautam Gowrisankaran, and Robert Town, 2003, Bayesian inference for hospital quality in a selection model, Econometrica 71, 1215-1239.   \nGeweke, John, Michael Keane, and David Runkle, 1994, Alternative computational approaches to inference in the multinomial probit model, Reuiew of Economics and Statistics 76, 609-632.   \nGompers, Paul, 1996, Grandstanding in the venture capital industry, Journal of Financial Economics 42, 133-156.   \nGompers, Paul, and Josh Lerner, 1999, The Venture Capital Cycle (MIT Press, Cambridge).   \nGompers, Paul, and Josh Lerner, 2000.

In this paper, the number of patent application and the patent quality(invention patent applications, number of effective patents, IPC number of international patent classification, and patent claims) are used to measure the innovation performance of enterprises, and the regression results show that the innovation performance is significantly promoted by the venture capital; for industries with higher dependence on external financing and high technology intensity and areas with better protection of property rights, venture capital promotes innovation performance more significantly. In this paper, it further distinguishes the characteristics of venture capital institutions, and finds that the promotion effect of non-state-owned venture capital on innovation performance is significantly greater than that of state-owned venture capital; the venture capital institutions with high reputation and high network capital play a more significant role in promoting innovation performance.  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nInnovation is one of the most important driving forces for sustained economic growth. China is at a critical moment of industrial structure transformation, and the $18^{\\mathrm{th}}$ National Congress of the Party clearly put forward that the innovation driven development strategy “must be placed in the core position of the overall development of the country. International experience shows that establishing an effective venture capital mechanism to effectively mobilize venture capital and promote industrialization of scientific and technological achievements is an important link in implementing the innovation strategy. According to Development report of China's Venture Capital Industry in 2017,by the end of 2017, the number of venture capital enterprises registered in China had reached 3546 with total assets of 594.8 billion Yuan and a cumulative investment of 55,478 enterprises. In recent years, about $40\\%$ of the listed enterprises in the GEM and SME have venture capital backgrounds. Venture capital supported enterprises are mostly belongs to the strategic industries encouraged by the state, and are important forces to transform the economic structure.  \n\nThrough the panel data of enterprises, it analyzes the differences of the characteristics of different industries, regions and venture capital institutions. It uses international patent applications and the patent quality to measure innovation performance, which is a strong evidence to show that the venture capital significantly promotes innovation performance. For industries with higher dependence on external financing and high technology intensity and areas with better protection of property rights, venture capital promotes innovation performance more significantly. The promotion effect of non-state-owned venture capital on innovation performance is significantly greater than that of state-owned venture capital. The venture capital institutions with high reputation and high network capital play a more significant role in promoting innovation performance.  \n\nThe contributions of this paper are as follows. Firstly, venture capital is crucial to innovation and economic development. The maturity of capital markets varies from country to country, and so far, there is no empirical study to examine the influence of venture capital on innovation performance in the context of China's transition economy. The individual studies (Popov & Roosenboom, 2013) examined innovation investment only, and did not focus on the innovation performance with economic significance. This paper will make up for the above shortcomings. In particular, the development disparity of China's industries and regions is very large, which provides an ideal research space for this paper. From the perspectives of external financing dependence, high technology intensity and regional protection of property rights in the industry, it provides evidence for venture capital to promote the innovation performance of enterprises. Secondly, state-owned venture capital is a hot issue in recent years (Schertler & Tykvova, 2011). At different development stages of venture capital industry, the role of the government is not the same, and the existing literature has a very limited understanding on its investment mechanism. Thirdly, the economic system is made up of micro subjects. More and more studies are concerned about the formation and effect of relational networks. Venture capital institutions form networks through cooperative investment, and the reputation and network capital of venture capital become important factors influencing its behaviors (Grant & Yeo, 2018). The marketization degree of emerging economies is poor, and reputation and network capital have more room to play. Fourthly, the data of innovation performance with high quality collected and collated in this paper is a breakthrough. Through complex computer programs and a lot of manual work, it collects the data of 8,888, 456 invention patent applications and 7,543,543 patent applications of utility model firstly examined and published by the State Intellectual Property Office before the end of 2017, and through Google Patent, it collects 25,763,487 legal status change data of these patents before the end of December 2017, and the patent applicants are matched with the names of enterprises to form the samples.  \n\nThe rest of this paper is arranged as follows: the second part carries out theoretical analysis and puts forward 5 research hypotheses; the third part introduces the research design and describes the data; the fourth part is empirical analysis and robustness test; the fifth part summarizes the full text.  \n\n## 2. Theoretical analysis and research hypothesis  \n\n### 2.1. Venture capital and innovation performance  \n\nResearches find that venture capital is positive correlated with innovation performance in development countries (von Briel, Recker, & Davidsson, 2018), but the researches are not sufficient and the causal relationship is not clear, and there is no relevant research in China. The institutional environment of China is quite different from that of developed countries, and it is necessary to explore the mechanism of venture capital on innovation performance in China.  \n\nCompared with other traditional ways of investment and financing, venture capital can stimulate and promote innovation more for the following reasons: firstly, as an effective equity financing method, venture capital focuses on the long-term investment of early small and medium-sized enterprises, which can effectively reduce the R&D underinvestment of enterprises with strong financing constraints (Kayas, Mclean, Hines, & Wright, 2008), reduce external financing costs, and promotes innovation performance (Rosenbusch, Brinckmann, & Miller, 2013). The screening and supervising ability of venture capital institutions is stronger than that of banks, and the valuation of enterprises is more accurate. In the innovation activities with serious information asymmetry, venture capital in the form of equity can play a better advantage than debt, and can improve the efficiency of resource allocation and the innovative efficiency of innovative enterprises (Nahata, 2008). Secondly, to provide professional value-added services for enterprises, venture capital enters into the board of directors to supervise enterprises (Hochberg, Lindsey, & Westerfield, 2015; Luukkonen, Deschryvere, & Bertoni, 2013). Based on the above analysis, the hypothesis H1 is put forward as:  \n\nH1. Venture capital will promote the innovation performance of enterprises.  \n\nOn the basis of hypothesis 1, the following 4 hypotheses are further developed.  \n\n### 2.2. Influence of industrial and regional characteristics  \n\n1 Industrial characteristics: external financing dependence and high technology intensity  \n\nThe theoretical analysis of H1 emphasizes that the equity form of venture capital can ease the external financing constraints of enterprises, and venture capital is more likely to invest the innovative technology industry. On this basis, the hypothesis H2 is developed.  \n\nEquity capital can overcome information asymmetry, reduce external financing costs, ease financing constraints, and promote innovation performance. Pierrakis and Saridakis (2017) indicated that for industries with high dependence on external financing, the size of equity market can promote innovation performance, while the size of debt market has a significant negative effect. Startup enterprises with less tangible collateral have greater debt financing constraints, but increasing equity financing won't increase financial risks (Ewens, Nanda, & Rhodes-Kropf, 2018). Equity financing can overcome the problem of information asymmetry and agency more. When the capital market can effectively disperse risks, equity investors are more willing to invest innovative enterprises with high risks, helping to reduce the financing constraints of such enterprises and improve innovation performance (Dai, Jo, & Kassicieh, 2012). Accordingly, the hypothesis H2 is put forward:  \n\nH2. For industries with higher dependence on external financing, venture capital plays a more significant role in promoting innovation performance; for industries with higher concentration of high technology, venture capital plays a more significant role in promoting innovation performance.  \n\n### 2 Regional characteristics: protection degree of property rights  \n\nThe theoretical analysis of Hl emphasizes that venture capital is more likely to invest high-tech industries, and such enterprises have intensive R&D activities and need more legal protections on innovation results. On this basis, the hypothesis H3 is developed. Due to the market failure and spillover effect of innovation, the high-tech industry is facing a particularly serious risk of being occupied in the absence of good legal protection. A large number of researches have shown that property rights protection and law enforcement can effectively improve the investment and financing willingness and R&D efficiency (Andrieu & Staglian0, 2016; Hasan, Khurshed, Mohamed, & Wang, 2018). Based on the above analysis, the hypothesis H3 is put forward:  \n\nH3. In the areas with better protection degree of property rights, venture capital plays a more significant role in promoting innovation performance.  \n\n### 2.3. Ownership nature of venture capital institutions  \n\nThe theoretical analysis of H1 emphasizes the initiative and professionalization of venture capital, and the ownership nature of venture capital institutions greatly affects their initiative and professionalization. On this basis, the hypothesis H4 is developed to further compare the differences between the state-owned and non-state-owned venture capital institutions on innovation performance.  \n\nThe agency problems arising from state ownership may weaken its promotion of innovation, for their staff is less professional and it is more difficult to carry out effective incentives inside (Kshetri, 2016); stateowned venture capital institutions have obvious political objectives and cannot easily interfere with corporate governance (Buchner, Mohamed, & Schwienbacher, 2017). However, state-owned capital may also promote innovation more than non-state-owned capital. Firstly, the government involving in the emerging industries as an investor can significantly reduce the financing constraints and the insufficient R&D investment of SMEs (Barry & Mihov, 2015), and enhance their innovation performance. The venture capital supported enterprises with government background also have higher long-term growth (Kwok, Sharma, Singh Gaur, & Ueno, 2018). Secondly, state-owned venture capital institutions have a nature political relationship, so they have more opportunities to promote enterprises to improve innovation per formance. Accordingly, the research hypothesis H4 with competitiveness isproposed:  \n\nH4a. Compared with state-owned venture capital institutions, nonstate-owned venture capital institutions play a more significant role in promoting innovation performance.  \n\nH4b. Compared with state-owned venture capital institutions, the nonstate-owned venture capital institutions have less promotive effect on innovation performance.  \n\n### 2.4. Reputation and network capital of venture capital institutions  \n\nThe theoretical analysis of H1 emphasizes the human capital and value-added services of venture capital institutions. On this basis, the hypothesis H5 is developed. Venture capital with high reputation can provide more professional value-added services, and attract underwriters with high reputation and follow-up financing for enterprises through the certification effect; reputation damage is bad for venture capital institutions, for example, it is harder to raise capital in the future, and harder to get high exit returns (Lee, 2017). Therefore, venture capital institutions with high reputation have more motivations to maintain their reputations and provide value-added services, so as to improve the innovation performance of enterprises. Venture capital institutions with high network capital have the advantages of information and social networks, which can better coordinate venture capital institutions, and easier form joint venture capital with other institutions. Based on the above analysis, the hypothesis H5 is put forward:  \n\nH5. Venture capital institutions with high reputation play a more significant role in promoting innovation performance; venture capital with high network capital play a more significant role in promoting innovationperformance.  \n\n## 3. Research design, variables and samples  \n\n### 3.1. Research design  \n\nThis paper examines the above five hypotheses through panel data at the enterprise level. The empirical model to test hypothesis H1 is:  \n\n$$\nI n n o v a t i o n_{j,t}=\\gamma_{0}+\\gamma_{1}V C_{j}+\\gamma_{2}P o s t_{t}+\\gamma_{3}V C_{j}\\mathrm{}^{*}P o s t_{t}+C O N T R O L S_{j,t}+\\mu_{j,t}\n$$  \n\nAmong them, $j$ represents the enterprise; $t$ represents the year; $V C$ represents whether venture capital supported enterprises; Post represents whether the year is between the original matching enterprise's venture capital entry and exit. The definition of control variables is shown in Table 1. The multiplication item $V C^{*}P o s t$ reflects the second difference between the changes in innovation performance of venture capital supported enterprises after receiving venture capital support and the changes in innovation performance of non-venture capital supported enterprises during the same period, H1 tests the significance of the multiplication item $V C^{*}P o s t$ coefficient.  \n\nFor the test of hypothesis H2, this paper subdivides the sample into high sub-samples and low sub-samples according to the external financing dependence or industrial high-tech intensity of the industry, and carries out model (1) regression on the sub-samples. Referring to Lahr and Mina (2016), it adopted the data of listed companies to calculate the external financing dependence and high-tech intensity of the industry. The calculation method of external financing dependence of industry is as follows: 1) take each listed enterprise's capital expenditure plus R&D expenditure minus the cash flow of operating activities, divide by the sum of capital expenditure and R&D expenditure, and obtain the external financing dependence of each enterprise; 2) take the median of the external financing dependence of all enterprises in the industry for the year; 3) take the median of each industry in the time series of 2007-2015, and get the external financing dependence of the industry. The calculation method of high-tech intensity of the industry is similar, in which the high-tech intensity is measured by the annual growth rate of R&D expenditure. For the external financing dependence of the industry higher than the corporate observation value of the median in total samples, they are the high sub-samples of external financing dependence, and others are low sub-samples of external financing dependence; for the high-tech intensity of the industry higher than the corporate observation value of the median in total samples, they are high sub-samples of high-tech intensity, and others are low sub-samples of high-tech intensity. For the test of hypothesis H3, this paper divides the samples into good sub-samples and bad subsamples according to the degree of regional property rights protection, carries out model (1) regression on the sub-samples. In this paper, the degree of regional property rights protection is measured by the marketization index of the province where the invested enterprise is located. The hypothesis H4's test model is (2):  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{I n n o v a t i o n_{j,t}=\\varphi_{0}+\\varphi_{1}G V C_{j}+\\varphi_{2}N o n-G V C_{j}+\\varphi_{3}P o s t_{t}+\\varphi_{4}G V C_{j}^{*}P o s t_{t}}}\\ {{+\\varphi_{5}N o n-G V C_{j}^{*}P o s t_{t}+C O N T R O L S_{j,t}+\\nu_{j,t}}}\\end{array}\\qquad(\\mathrm{~;~}{\\begin{array}{c}{{1}}\\ {{2}}\\ {{3}}\\end{array}})\n$$  \n\nGVCand $N o n-G V C$ respectively indicate whether the enterprise is supported by state-owned venture capital institutions and whether it is supported by non-state-owned venture capital institutions; Post and CONTROLS are the same as in model (1). Model (2) examines the significance of the coefficients of the two multiplication items respectively.  \n\nThe models to test the hypothesis H5 are (3) and (4):  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{I n n o v a t i o n_{j,t}=\\varphi_{0}+\\varphi_{1}H R a n k V C_{j}+\\varphi_{2}L R a n k V C_{j}+\\varphi_{3}P o s t_{t}\\qquad}\\ {+\\varphi_{4}H R a n k V C_{j}^{*}P o s t_{t}+\\varphi_{5}L R a n k V C_{j}^{*}P o s t_{t}+C O N T R O L S_{j,t}}\\ {+\\nu_{j,t}\\qquad(3)}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{I n n o v a t i o n_{j,t}=\\varphi_{0}+\\varphi_{1}H N e t V C_{j}+\\varphi_{2}H N e t V C_{j}+\\varphi_{3}P o s t_{t}}\\ &{\\mathrm{~~}+\\varphi_{4}H N e t V C_{j}^{*}P o s t_{t}+\\varphi_{5}L N e t V C_{j}^{*}P o s t_{t}+C O N T R O L S_{j,t}}\\ &{\\mathrm{~~}+\\nu_{j,t}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nHRankVC and LRankVC respectively represent whether the enterprise is supported by the venture capital institution with high reputation and whether it is supported by the venture capital institution with low reputation; HNetVC and HNetVC respectively represent whether the enterprise is supported by the venture capital institution with high network capital and whether it is supported by the venture capital institution with low network capital; Post and CONTROLS are the same as in Model (1). Model (3) and (4) respectively test the significance of the multiplication item coefficient. In this paper, the reputation of a venture capital institution is measured by the number of its investment enterprises successfully listed in the past, and the network capital of a venture capital institution is measured by the number of venture capital institutions that have cooperated with during the previous 5 years.  \n\n### 3.2.Measurement ofinnovation performance  \n\nReferring to the existing literature, this paper measures the innovation performance (Innovation) by five indicators such as the number of patents and patent quality.  \n\n#### 1 Number of patents  \n\nTable1 Variable Definition and Descriptive Statistics.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variable Name</td><td>VariableDefinition</td><td>Observed Value</td><td>Mean Value</td><td>StandardDeviation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\">Explained Variables:</td></tr><tr><td>Patent</td><td>log(1+ number of inventions and utility model patents applied by the enterprise in the current year)</td><td>8765</td><td>0.423</td><td>0.653</td></tr><tr><td>Invention</td><td>log(1 + number of invention patents applied by the enterprise in the current year)</td><td>8765</td><td>0.132</td><td>0.443</td></tr><tr><td>Valid</td><td>log(1+ number of invention and utility model patents applied by the enterprise in the current year and still valid as of April 2014)</td><td>8765</td><td>0.187</td><td>0.509</td></tr><tr><td>IPCs</td><td>log(1+ number of invention and utility model patentsIPC(InternationalPatent Classification)</td><td>8765</td><td>0.342</td><td>0.842</td></tr><tr><td>Claims</td><td>applied by the enterprise in the current year log(1 + number of invention and utility model patent claims applied by the enterprise in the current</td><td>8765</td><td>0.511</td><td>1.112</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Explaining Variables:</td><td></td><td>8765</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VC GVC</td><td>Whether the enterpriseis a venture capital supported enterprise Whether the enterprise is an enterprise supported by the state-owned venture capital institutions</td><td>8765 8765</td><td>0.145 0.041</td><td>0.322 0.197</td></tr><tr><td>Non-GVC</td><td>Whether the enterprise is an enterprise supported by the non-state-owned venture capital</td><td>8765</td><td>0.088</td><td>0.251</td></tr><tr><td>HRankVC</td><td>institutions Whether the enterprise is an enterprise supported by the venture capital institutions with high</td><td>8765</td><td>0.041</td><td>0.188</td></tr><tr><td>LRankVC</td><td>reputation Whether the enterprise is an enterprise supported by the venture capital institutions with low</td><td>8765</td><td>0.092</td><td>0.265</td></tr><tr><td>HNetVC</td><td>reputation</td><td>8765</td><td>0.055</td><td>0.222</td></tr><tr><td>LNetVC</td><td>network capital Whether the enterprise is an enterprise supported by the venture capital institutions with low</td><td>8765</td><td>0.077</td><td>0.233</td></tr><tr><td>Post</td><td>network capital Whether the year t of the original matching enterprise is after the first entry of venture capital and</td><td>8765</td><td>0.551</td><td>0.486</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>before exit.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VC*Post GVC*Post</td><td>Multiplication item ofVC andPost Multiplication item of GVC and Post</td><td>8765 8765</td><td>0.071</td><td>0.251</td></tr><tr><td>Non-GVC*Post</td><td>Multiplication itemofNon-GVC andPost</td><td>8765</td><td>0.014</td><td>0.132</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Multiplication item ofHRankVC andPost</td><td>8765</td><td>0.041</td><td>0.224</td></tr><tr><td>HRankVC*Post LRankVC*Post</td><td>Multiplication item of LRankVC and Post</td><td>8765</td><td>0.022</td><td>0.155</td></tr><tr><td>HNetVC*Post</td><td>Multiplication item of HNetVC and Post</td><td>8765</td><td>0.051</td><td>0.221</td></tr><tr><td>LNetVC*Post</td><td>Multiplication item ofLNetVC andPost</td><td>8765</td><td>0.033</td><td>0.160</td></tr><tr><td>Control Variables:</td><td></td><td>8765</td><td>0.039</td><td>0.191</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>log(1 + age of the enterprise)</td><td>8765</td><td></td><td>0.732</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>log(1 + total assets of the enterprise (ten thousand Yuan))</td><td>8765</td><td>1.953 8.361</td><td>1.595</td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td>Enterprise's asset-liability ratio (%)</td><td>8765</td><td>0.487</td><td>0.275</td></tr><tr><td>Growth</td><td>Enterprise's revenue growthrate (%)</td><td>8765</td><td>0.352</td><td>1.242</td></tr><tr><td>Marketization</td><td>Marketization index of the provincewhere the enterpriseislocated</td><td>8765</td><td>9.065</td><td>1.611</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nIn this paper, it measures the number of patents (Patent) by the application number of invention patents and utility model patents (Tong and Frame, 1994).  \n\n#### 2 Patent quality  \n\n(1) Invention patents are the most innovative and valuable. In this paper, the application number of invention patents (Invention) is used as the first indicator to measure the patent quality. (2) Patents with low quality are more likely to expire before the specified protection period. During the effective protection period, patents have higher value (Lahr & Mina, 2016). In this paper, valid number of patents (Valid) is used as the second indicator to measure the patent quality. (3) The more international patent classifications (IPC) indicate the wider the technical field in which patents can be applied, and the higher the potential value (Ewens et al., 2018). This paper uses the patent number of IPC $(I P C s)$ as the third indicator to measure the patent quality. (4) The greater the number of claims indicates the more patent rights and the higher the value can be created (Obrimah, 2016). In this paper, the number of patent claims is used as the fourth indicator to measure the patent quality.  \n\n### 3.3. Data source and sample description  \n\nThe venture capital data and non-venture capital supported enterprise date referred in this paper are all from the CVSource database, the patent application data comes from the State Intellectual Property Office, and the patent quoted data and legal status date are from Google Patent.  \n\nIn this paper, for the 892 companies firstly supported by venture capital in 2010-2017, PSM matching is carried out according to the year, province, industry and application numbers of patents one year before receiving the venture capital, and up to 10 non-venture capital supported enterprises are obtained as control samples. The observation interval is from the first two years before venture capital entered to the exit of venture capital for each venture capital supported enterprise and its matching enterprise. The research sample of this paper is formed by matching the applicants of each patent with the sample enterprise name. Eliminating the observed value of missing control variables, a total of 8765 enterprise-annual observed values in 2010-2017.  \n\nDue to venture capital institutions may choose enterprises with better innovation performance beforehand, referring to the practice of Bengtsson and Hsu (2015) in controlling performance beforehand when matching, this paper controls the enterprise's number of patent applications one year before receiving the venture capital, and reduces the innovation differences of experimental group and control group beforehand. The t-test shows that there is no significant difference in the innovation performance of venture capital supported enterprises and non-venture capital supported enterprises one year before receiving the first round of venture capital (t value $=0.039\\mathrm{.}$  \n\nDescriptive statistics of the variables are shown in Table 1. There are no serious multicollinearity problems between regression variables.  \n\n## 4. Empirical analysis  \n\n### 4.1. Venture capital and innovation performance  \n\nTable 2 reports the test of hypothesis H1. The explained variables in column (1) are number of patents (Patent), and the explained variables form column (2) to column (5) are 4 indicators of patents’ quality respectively, and the explaining variable is $V C^{*}P o s t$ .Theresults show that the 5 measured variables of $V C^{*}P o s t$ on innovation performance are significantly positive at $1\\%$ , indicating that after the entry of venture capital, the innovation performance improvement of enterprises supported by venture capital is significantly higher than that of enterprises not supported by venture capital. The economic significance is also very significant. The regression results of control variables are basically the same as expected.  \n\nTable2 Influence of Venture Capital on the Innovation Performance of Enterprises.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>VARIABLES</td><td>(1) Patent</td><td>(2) Invention</td><td>(3) Valid</td><td>(4) IPCs</td><td>(5) Claims</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-1.111***</td><td>-0.764***</td><td>-0.944***</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Constant</td><td>(0.000)</td><td>(0.000)</td><td>(0.000)</td><td>-1.613*** (0.000)</td><td>-2.034***</td></tr><tr><td>0.031</td><td>0.043</td><td>0.036</td><td>0.045</td><td>(0.000)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">VC Post</td><td>(0.590)</td><td>(0.202)</td><td>(0.354)</td><td>(0.503)</td><td>0.077</td></tr><tr><td>-0.075***</td><td>-0.019</td><td>-0.045**</td><td>-0.102***</td><td>(0.373)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">VC*Post</td><td>(0.002)</td><td>(0.225)</td><td>(0.012)</td><td></td><td>-0.147***</td></tr><tr><td>0.22***</td><td>0.13***</td><td>0.138***</td><td>(0.002) 0.283***</td><td>(0.000)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Age</td><td>(0.002)</td><td>(0.003)</td><td>(0.006)</td><td>(0.000)</td><td>0.333***</td></tr><tr><td>0.015</td><td>0.008</td><td>0.006</td><td>0.026</td><td>(0.002)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Size</td><td>(0.410)</td><td>(0.346)</td><td>(0.663)</td><td>(0.209)</td><td>0.021</td></tr><tr><td>0.109***</td><td>0.068***</td><td>0.083***</td><td>0.146***</td><td>(0.439)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Leverage</td><td>(0.000)</td><td>(0.000)</td><td>(0.000)</td><td>(0.000)</td><td>0.193***</td></tr><tr><td>-0.045</td><td>-0.052**</td><td>-0.033</td><td>-0.052</td><td>(0.000)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Growth</td><td>(0.341)</td><td>(0.025)</td><td>(0.287)</td><td></td><td>-0.084</td></tr><tr><td>-0.009</td><td>-0.007</td><td>-0.005</td><td>(0.273) -0.013</td><td>(0.197)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Marketization</td><td>(0.381)</td><td>(0.242)</td><td>(0.468)</td><td>(0.161)</td><td>-0.014</td></tr><tr><td>0.017**</td><td>0.017***</td><td>0.012*</td><td>0.027**</td><td>(0.264)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.020)</td><td>(0.002)</td><td>(0.072)</td><td>(0.014)</td><td>0.043***</td></tr><tr><td>YearDummies</td><td>Control</td><td>Control</td><td>Control</td><td></td><td>(0.002)</td></tr><tr><td>IndustryDummies</td><td></td><td>Control</td><td>Control</td><td></td><td>Control Control</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster</td><td>enterprise</td><td>enterprise</td><td>enterprise</td><td>enterprise</td><td>enterprise</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>8765</td><td>8765</td><td>8765</td><td>8765</td><td>8765</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.1422</td><td>0.1166</td><td>0.1275</td><td>0.1406</td><td>0.1401</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.1422</td><td>0.1166</td><td>0.1275</td><td>0.1406</td><td>0.1401</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\note: the values in brackets are p statistic values of heteroskedasticity-robust after clustering adjustment at the enterprise level; \\*, \\*\\* and \\*\\*\\* respectively represen le significance level of $10\\%$ $5\\%$ and $1\\%$  \n\n### 4.2. Influence of industrial and regional characteristics  \n\n1 Industrial characteristics: external financing dependence and hightech intensity  \n\nTable 3 reports the test results of hypothesis H2. Panel A finds that for the sub-samples with high dependence on external financing, the five measured variables of $V C^{*}P o s t$ on innovation performance are significantly positive at $1\\%$ , and the economic significance is also very significant; while for the sub-samples with low dependence on external financing, the five measured variables of $V C^{*}P o s t$ on innovation performance are not significant. The results of Panel B are similar.  \n\n2 Regional characteristics: protection of property rights  \n\nTable 4 reports the test results of hypothesis H3. Table 4 shows that for the sub-samples with good protection of property rights, the three measured variables of $V C^{*}P o s t$ are significantly positive at $1\\%$ ,and the two measured variables are significantly positive at $5\\%$ ,and the economic significance is also very significant, while for the sub-samples with bad protection of property rights, $V C^{*}P o s t$ is not significant or weaker, indicating that in the areas with better protection of property rights, venture capital plays a more significant role in promoting the innovation performance of enterprises.  \n\n### 4.3.Influence of venture capital institutions’ownership nature  \n\nThe above results show that venture capital effectively promoted the innovation performance of enterprises. In this paper, it further uses model (2) to test the hypothesis H4. Table 5 shows the regression results. The five explained variables of innovation for Non-GVC\\*Post are significantly positive at $1\\%$ , and the economic significance is also significant, while the regression coefficient of $\\mathrm{GVC}^{\\ast}\\mathrm{Post}$ is not significant or weakly significant, indicating that non-state-owned venture capital plays a more significant role in promoting innovation performance, which is consistent with the existing literature (Cumming, Grilli, & Murtinu, 2014).  \n\n### 4.4. Influence of venture capital institutions'reputation and network capital  \n\nTable 6 reports the test results of hypothesis H5. Panel A shows that HRankVC\\*Post has significant positive effects on the five measured variables of innovation performance, which are all significant at $1\\%$ level, and the economic significance is also very significant, while the regression coefficient and significance are significantly higher than Post, indicating that venture capital institutions with high reputation play a more significant role in promoting innovation performance. Panel B shows that HNetVC\\*Post has very significant positive effects on the five measured variables of innovation performance, which are all significant at $1\\%$ , and the economic significance is also very significant, while the regression coefficient of LNetVC\\*Post is basically not significant or only slightly significant, indicating that venture capital institutions with high network capital play a more significant role in promoting innovation performance.  \n\n### 4.5.Endogenousness problems and other robustness tests  \n\n#### (1) Endogenousness problems  \n\nThe results above show that venture capital significantly promoted innovation performance. In the research design, through PSM matching, it controls the innovation performance of enterprises before venture capital entered, and there is no significant difference beforehand between venture capital supported enterprises and the matching non-venture capital supported enterprises. In this paper, PSM matching and multiplication items are used to estimate quadratic difference, which effectively alleviates the endogenousness problems caused by missing variables and selective bias. The above results are less likely to be caused by the reverse causality (that is, enterprises with better innovation performance are more likely to attract venture capital).  \n\nTable3 Influence of Industrial Characteristics.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>VARIABLES</td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(8)</td><td>(6)</td><td>(10)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"4\">High external financing dependence</td><td></td><td colspan=\"4\">Low external financing dependance</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Patent</td><td>Invention</td><td>Valid</td><td>IPCs</td><td>Claims</td><td>Patent</td><td>Invention</td><td>Valid</td><td>IPCs</td><td>Claims</td></tr><tr><td>VC</td><td>0.025</td><td>0.019</td><td>0.045</td><td>0.026</td><td>0.051</td><td>0.037</td><td>0.065</td><td>0.027</td><td>0.071</td><td>0.114</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.742)</td><td>(0.724)</td><td>(0.432)</td><td>(0.806)</td><td>(0.715)</td><td>(0.544)</td><td>(0.107)</td><td>(0.554)</td><td>(0.398)</td><td>(0.265)</td></tr><tr><td>Post</td><td>-0.111***</td><td>-0.046**</td><td>-0.068***</td><td>-0.161***</td><td>-0.242***</td><td>-0.027</td><td>0.018</td><td>-0.012</td><td>-0.033</td><td>-0.032</td></tr><tr><td>VC*Post</td><td>(0.000)</td><td>(0.039)</td><td>(0.009)</td><td>(0.000)</td><td>(0.000)</td><td>(0.484)</td><td>(0.574)</td><td>(0.438)</td><td>(0.401)</td><td>(0.474) 0.091</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.307***</td><td>0.262***</td><td>0.221***</td><td>0.472***</td><td>0.597***</td><td>0.089</td><td>0.013</td><td>0.061</td><td>0.119</td><td>(0.446)</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>(0.002) 3,34</td><td>(0.000)</td><td>(0.006)</td><td>(0.000)</td><td>(0.000)</td><td>(0.212)</td><td>(0.728)</td><td>(0.277)</td><td>(0.242)</td><td>3,18</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.1578</td><td>3,34 0.1427</td><td>3,34 0.1462</td><td>3,34 0.1595</td><td>3,34 0.1607</td><td>3,17 0.1289</td><td>3,17 0.0932</td><td>3,17 0.1138</td><td>3,17</td><td>0.1239</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.1241</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"9\">Panel B High-tech intensity</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VARIABLES</td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td colspan=\"4\">(2)</td><td>(10)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>High high-tech intensity</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td colspan=\"4\">Low high-tech intensity</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Patent</td><td>Invention</td><td>Valid</td><td>IPCs</td><td>Claims</td><td>Patent</td><td>Invention</td><td>Valid</td><td>IPCs</td><td>Claims</td></tr><tr><td>VC</td><td>-0.006</td><td>0.011</td><td>-0.006</td><td>0.014</td><td>0.071</td><td>0.047</td><td>0.067</td><td>0.071</td><td>0.076</td><td>0.071</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.937)</td><td>(0.708)</td><td>(0.881)</td><td>(0.902)</td><td>(0.507)</td><td>(0.501)</td><td>(0.248)</td><td>(0.252)</td><td>(0.481)</td><td>(0.592)</td></tr><tr><td>Post</td><td>-0.064**</td><td>-0.016</td><td>-0.032</td><td>-0.105***</td><td>-0.122**</td><td>-0.074**</td><td>0.022</td><td>-0.051**</td><td>-0.101**</td><td>-0.169***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.016)</td><td>(0.491)</td><td>(0.104)</td><td>(0.008)</td><td>(0.017)</td><td>(0.022)</td><td>(0.295)</td><td>(0.043)</td><td>(0.024)</td><td>(0.002)</td></tr><tr><td>VC*Post</td><td>0.24***</td><td>0.197***</td><td>0.267***</td><td>0.342***</td><td>0.482***</td><td>0.157**</td><td>0.082*</td><td>0.127**</td><td>0.142**</td><td>0.217*</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.002)</td><td>(0.004)</td><td>(0.003)</td><td>(0.011)</td><td>(0.005)</td><td>(0.019)</td><td>(0.051)</td><td>(0.011)</td><td>(0.011)</td><td>(0.071)</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>3,11</td><td>3,11</td><td>3,11</td><td>3,11</td><td>3,11</td><td>3,33</td><td>3,33</td><td>3,33</td><td>3,33</td><td>3,33</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.1297</td><td>0.1035</td><td>0.1209</td><td>0.1257</td><td>0.1252</td><td>0.1571</td><td>0.1348</td><td>0.1392</td><td>0.1595</td><td>0.1579</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nIote: the values in brackets are p statistic values of heteroskedasticity-robust after clustering adjustment at the enterprise level; \\*, \\*\\* and \\*\\*\\* respectively represer hesignificancelevel of $10\\%$ $5\\%$ and $1\\%$ . Due to space limitation, the control variables are not reported in the table, but the regression results are similar to those i 'able 2. All regressions in this paper control the annual and industrial fixed effects, and the same as below.  \n\nIn this paper, Heckman two-stage regression is adopted to reduce endogenousness and control unobservable factors.Venture capital institutions tend to invest enterprises nearby, so there is geographic clustering between the invested enterprises and venture capital institutions (Meglio, Mocciaro, Destri, & Capasso, 2017), and in this paper, the number of venture capital institutions in the province where the invested enterprises firstly obtained the venture capital in the year is selected as a instrumental variable. The number of venture capital institutions where the enterprises located will influence the possibility of venture capital entering, but will not directly influence the innovation activities of enterprises. The first-stage regression shows that the coefficient of instrumental variable is very significant (P value $=0.16\\$ and the second-stage regression has little difference from the above results, which is consistent to the conclusion.  \n\n(2) Other robustness tests  \n\nIn this paper, it also tries a lot of robustness tests, including: 1. Due to the serious lack of leverage of sample enterprises, the control variables in the original regression are deleted; 2. On the basis of original regression, some regional variables which may affect the innovation performance of enterprises are added, such as the number of high-tech enterprises in the province where the enterprises is located, R&D expenditure, GD, and number of high-end innovative talents (academicians of Yangtze River and academicians of two Academies); 3. The sample interval of venture capital supported enterprises and its matching enterprises is adjusted from three years before venture capital first entry to its exit; 4. The enterprises without any patent applications in the sample interval are removed.

Discussion and conclusion  \n\n### 5.1.Summary  \n\nAs a kind of investment and financing method that can promote innovation in theory, does venture capital promote the innovation of Chinese enterprises in the empirical? This paper examines the influence of venture capital on innovation performance by taking the panel data of manufacturing industrial enterprises in 2010-2017 as samples (Azaizah, Reychav, Raban, Simon, & McHaney, 2018; Batjargal, 2007; Gaddy, Sivaram, Jones, & Wayman, 2017). The results show that the changes in innovation performance of venture capital supported enterprises are significantly higher than that of non-venture capital supported enterprises during the same period. For industries with higher external financing dependence and higher high-tech intensity and regions with better property rights protection, venture capital promotes the innovation performance of enterprises more significantly (Adomako, Opoku, & Frimpong, 2018; Crain, 2018; Meglio et al., 2017). Further distinguishing the characteristics of venture capital institutions, it is found that the role of non-state-owned venture capital institutions in promoting innovation performance is significantly greater than that of state-owned venture institutions; venture capital institutions with high reputation and high network capital play more significant roles in promoting innovation performance (Benjamin & Delvin, 2018; McDowell, Peake, Coder, & Harris, 2018; Larsen, & Olaisen, 2013) The research conclusions of this paper provide evidence of emerging markets for venture capital to promote innovation performance, and help to understand the differences of innovation performance in different countries. It shows that China's venture capital has effectively promoted innovation performance, and has important reference significance for formulating policies in the development and structural adjustment of venture capital industry (Chemmanur, Hull, & Krishnan, 2016; Futterer, Schmidt, & Heidenreich, 2018; Mamonov & Triantoro, 2018; Meuleman, Jaaskelainen, Maula, & Wright, 2017; Otchere & Vong, 2016; Pradhan et al., 2018; Vergara, Bonilla, & Sepulveda,  2016;Anonymous, 2018; McKenzie,Satchell, & Wongwachara, 2012).  \n\n### 5.2. Contributions to theory  \n\nCurrently, due to convenient conditions and procedures, venture capital has become the main financing channel for Chinese enterprises, especially startup enterprises and it has broken through disadvantages of traditionally severe dependence on commercial bank financing. Studying the influence effect and action mechanism of venture capital on enterprise performance is of crucial practical value and important theoretical significance. Regarding the influence of venture capital on the performance of listed companies, there are positive and negative research conclusions in existing literature researches. Theories supporting the positive influence of venture capital on enterprises mainly include “screening supervision theory\", and theories supporting the negative influence of venture capital on enterprise performance mainly include “reverse choice theory\" and “grandstanding motivation hypothesis\". Due to different samples, the influence of venture capital on the performance of listed companies can be reflected in different countries and regions and in different periods to varying degrees. However, China's researches in this aspect is mainly focus on main board and SME board listed companies. The newly established GEM lacks data with few researches, and particularly very few researches involve the post-IPO performance.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">Claims Panel B Influence of venture capital institutions’network capital IPCs Invention Patent E VARIABLES Claims 5 IPCs Panel A Influence of venture capital institutions’reputation (E) Invention</td><td rowspan=\"3\">-0.051 -0.021 (0.592) -0.042 (0.496) HNetVC LNetVC Post -0.146*** 0.192 (0.202) (0.112) 0.158 -0.102*** 0.141 (0.172) (0.176) 0.103 -0.042** -0.061 (0.302) (0.122) 0.063 -0.015 (0.782) (0.103) -0.017 0.061 -0.105 (0.173) (0.202) -0.062 Patent 0.062</td><td>-0.145*** 0.512*** (0.656) (0.131) (0.000) 0.172 (0.000) 0.191 (0.142) 6,819 -0.103*** (0.451) (0.162) (0.002) 0428*** 0.124 (0.000) 0.177* (0.092) 6,843 0.1415</td></tr><tr><td>-0.062 -0.042** 0.186*** -0.012 (0.733) (0.136) (0.011) (0.011) (0.115) 0.071 0.102</td></tr><tr><td>0.241*** 0.084** (0.042) -0.012 (0.232) (0.000) 0.052 (0.352) 6,843 0.1182 -0.063** 0.285*** (0.227) (0.002) (0.000) 0.122* (0.092) 0.072 6,843 0.1411</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nRegarding the theoretical significance, analyzing the influence effect of venture capital on enterprise performance, and deeply testing the impact mechanism and acting path of venture capital on enterprise performance can help to clearly reveal the function and internal mechanism of venture capital for enterprise performance, enrich and improve enterprise theory and corporate governance theory. Increasing investment in R&D is conducive to enterprise R&D of new technologies, output of new products, and enterprise overall profitability in the market, which have been confirmed in many scholars' researches. But the risks and lagging earnings of R&D, serious information mismatch have greatly restricted the investment of R&D projects, thus influencing enterprise performance ability, which have also been confirmed by somescholars.  \n\nThe theoretical significance of the topic lies in that it can eliminate the attractiveness of enterprises with good performance enterprises to venture capital and further investigate the influence of venture capital on SME performance. Related researches in recent years have affirmed the positive correlation relationship between venture capital and SME performance, but the relationship is bidirectional. The good performance of SMEs may be the result of the influence after venture capital participation, or the result of venture capital deliberately selecting enterprises with good performance. Regarding empirical method selection, this paper adopts propensity score matching method popular in recent years, which can eliminate the attractiveness of SMEs with better performance to venture capital institutions, and analyze the influence of venture capital on SME performance unidirectionally, further understand the role of venture capital, and enrich theories in related fields.  \n\n### 5.3. Implications on practice  \n\nRegarding the practical significance, empirical analysis of the influence of venture capital on enterprise performance is conducive to scientific understanding of the influence of venture capital on performance, analysis of the problems, opportunities and challenges of venture capital in promoting enterprise development. It can provide reasonable suggestions for enterprises to obtain venture capital, promote the benign interaction between venture capital institutions and enterprises, and provide experience references and decision-making support for the government to scientifically manage the venture capital market and facilitate the role of venture capital in enterprise and economic development.  \n\nOn the one hand, it can help to improve enterprise performance. With the advent of low-profit era, micro-market individuals try their best to improve performance and obtain profit for self-protection and development in the increasingly complicated market environment. The inimitable innovation ability is an important capital to enhance enterprise competitiveness and to obtain leading position ahead of peers in the market. Generally speaking, innovation capability improvement requires for carrying out supportive activities, that is, the R &D investment at the early stage. Therefore, the measurement of the R& D intensity of a certain enterprise can manifest the level of its innovation capability. The more innovative individuals are, the more likely they are to occupy advantageous position in the market. On the other hand, it is good for guiding the benign development of venture capital institutions and promoting the growth of capital market. As the product of capital market development, venture capital has received people's different judgements. This paper collects relevant data and explores the influence of venture capital on the relationship between R&D input and performance, which can confirm the role of VCs in promoting microindividuals and even the entire market economy. In favor of future development of VC institutions, it can further perfect China's capital market, and arouse entrepreneurs’ attention to VC institutions in practice field at the same time.  \n\nThe practical significance of the topic lies in strengthening SME to pay attention to venture capital. With the gradual promotion of domestic mass entrepreneurship and innovation, venture capital has gradually exerted its value. SMEs as the main force of innovation is subject to scale under a lot of restrictions on financing. Participation of venture capital can bring urgent-needed funds to SMEs in the initial stage. Also, venture capital can also assist enterprises in internal management and external market development, thus creating added value to the enterprise. As venture capital began late in China, in addition to the imperfect domestic mechanism, defective laws and regulations, it is not necessarily applicable to study domestic venture capital with reference to foreign researches. This paper can further demonstrate the role of venture capital, and provide references for SMEs to choose whether to cooperate with venture capital and to cooperate with what kind of venture capital institutions. From the macroscopic perspective, due to the immature development of China's venture capital, GEM establishment for only several years, we need to demonstrate whether the influence of China's venture capital on GEM listed companies' performance is positive or not. The research in this paper can also reflect the short-term and long-term operational effects of China's GEM listed companies. From the microcosmic perspective, underfunded small and medium-sized enterprises need to clarify the long-term effects of venture capital on enterprises for selectively choosing venture capital institutions and better cooperation with venture capital institutions. For venture capital, verifying the existence of China's \"reverse selection effect\" in China is of practical significance. This paper studies the relationship between venture capital, its characteristics and enterprise performance for the purpose of reducing information asymmetry problems for capital market participants to a certain degree, and provide reference information for market stakeholders decision-making. (1) It can help to provide references for venture enterprise financing decisionmaking. By studying the influence of venture capital intervention and venture capital related characteristics on enterprise performance, venture companies can refer to the research results to choose different venture capitals so that venture capital can play an effective promoting role. (2) It helps the venture capital institutions to pay attention to investment effectiveness. Venture capital institutions can refer to relevant research conclusions to choose a more effective and stable investment methods and pay attention to possible problems in the investment process, which can facilitate venture capitalists’ better operation and management of venture capital, and carry out venture capital activities orderly on the basis of guaranteeing venture capitalists' benefits. (3) It can help to the judgment of risk market participants' judge venture business, reduce information asymmetry of capital market participants according to the influence of venture capital intervention, related characteristics, and results of enterprise performance, and help enterprises to make reasonable judgment on the potential of venture business.  \n\n# Declaration of interest  \n\nWe declare that we have no financial and personal relationships with other people or organizations that can inappropriately influence our work, there is no professional or other personal interest of any nature or kind in any product, service and/or company that could be construed as influencing the position presented in, or the review of, the manuscript entitled.  \n\n# Acknowledgments  \n\nThe authors thank the editor and reviewers for their insightful comments and suggestions.

I develop a framework grounded in transaction costs economics and social knowledge theories to investigate relationships between remittances and home-country (1) capital availability, (2) new business creation, and (3) economic internationalization. My framework also accounts for individual and collective immigrant attributes that may moderate the impact of remittances on these alternative indicators of the venture investment environment. Analyses of immigrant remittances to 61 developing countries from 2002-2007 indicate that they increase general and more narrowly defined venture capital availability as well as broader openness to international trade. Remittances also increase new business start-up rates when the developing country's public sector is sufficiently small. Positive venture-funding effects of remittances are magnified when coming from immigrants living in highly concentrated communities, but are diminished when coming from highly educated immigrants. Overall, results suggest that developing-country immigrants of varying backgrounds play an important role in venture funding, founding and integration with the world economy.  \n\nJournal of International Business Studies (2011） 42, l12l-I|49.doi:10.1057/jibs.2011.36  \n\nKeywords: entrepreneurship; immigrant remittances; developing countries; internationalization; venture capital  \n\n## INTRODUCTION  \n\nIn this paper, I develop and test aspects of a theoretical framework explaining whether and how developing-country immigrants significantly enhance the venture investment environment in their home countries through remittances of money and ideas. Research in international business (IB) and entrepreneurship has largely ignored this possibility, even though immigrants from many developing countries number in the millions, and remit billions of Us dollars annually. It may be that IB and entrepreneurship researchers assume this money is merely for home-country subsistence needs such as food, shelter, education and healthcare for family members. If so, then this assumption runs counter to recent speculation among development economists (e.g., Woodruff & Zenteno, 2007), public policy scholars (e.g., de Haas, 2005) and international organizations (e.g., IFAD, 2007) that immigrants abroad are increasingly important for financing new businesses in their home countries. Immigrant ideas developed abroad may also constitute “social\" remittances guiding the use of venture capital to fund, found and grow new firms internationally (Levitt, 1998; Williams, 2007). If this is true, then developingcountry immigrants could be vital players in entrepreneurship and broader economic internationalization trends. IB and entrepreneurship researchers should contribute theoretical insights and investigate empirical evidence related to immigrants and the role their transnational money and ideas may play in enhancing the venture investment environment of developing countries.  \n\nIn response, I contribute a theoretical framework to explain developing-country immigrants, remittances and home-country venture investment based on transaction cost economics (TCE) (Coase, 1937; Henisz, 2000; Williamson, 1985) and social knowledge (Kogut & Zander, 1993; Polanyi, 1966) logic. Potential investors  in developing countries  face substantial transaction costs when moving money and ideas across borders. TCE scholars from Coase (1937) to Williamson (1985) and Henisz (2000) have pointed out that these costs relate to coordination - that is, the costs of negotiating, implementing, overseeing and, in the breach, coercing transfers through formal  legal and regulatory enforcement mechanisms. Guler and Guillén (2010) provide recent evidence that such transaction costs deter venture investment activity in many developing countries with less-established formal institutions to coordinate the transfer of money and ideas.  \n\nBut their findings might not apply with substantial weight to developing-country immigrants mulling over venture investment opportunities back home. Webb, Tihanyi, Ireland, and Sirmon (2009) recently highlighted the potential of informal relationships, often grounded in shared membership in a geographic community, or in a family, ethnic or cultural group I describe collectively as a clan (Ouchi, 1980). Informal clan and community arrangements can complement if not completely replace the formal arrangements that investors typically rely on to safeguard the prudent transfer and use of scarce venture capital and ideas, and the formal arrangements that they rely on to inform and guide business partners about the effective use of scarce venture capital and ideas. I build on this logic to propose that informal, cross-country relationships can serve as bases for immigrants to identify business opportunities and business partners back home, and transfer venture capital and ideas through remittances where other investors with more “conventional\" venture capital might not.  \n\nMy TCE- and social-knowledge-based framework motivates five hypotheses about the direct and indirect  positive impact  of  developing-country immigrant remittances on new-venture funding, founding and growth through internationalization in their home countries. My empirical investigation of these hypotheses also contributes to IB and entrepreneurship research with the first broad sample statistical evidence assessing remittance effects on home-country venture investing trends.  \n\nMultivariate panel analyses of data on remittances to 61 developing countries from 2002 to 2007 yield substantial evidentiary support for all hypotheses about the direct impact of remittances on home-country venture investment indicators. I find that remittances are positively related to greater general access to capital, as well as more narrowly defined venture capital access in immigrants' home countries. Remittances are also positively related to increased home-country import and export activity, a trend I describe as economic internationalization. I find that remittances are also positively related to rates of new business creation in immigrants' home countries, but this relationship is more nuanced. They increase the new business start-up rate in a developing country, but only when that same developing country's government does not constitute too large a share of the national economy and perhaps \"crowd out\" private economic players and activities related to remittances. These direct relationships are more substantial in some of the world's least developed countries, thus suggesting an especially important role for remittances in sparking economic growth led by entrepreneurs in the private sector.  \n\nI also document significant moderator effects, at times magnifying and at other times diminishing the impact of remittances on the home-country venture investment environment. I predict that individual immigrant educational attainment will magnify the venture investment impact of remittances, but find just the opposite. Positive remittance effects on venture capital access diminish among better-educated immigrants. Similarly, I expect that remittances from immigrants living in more concentrated  communities  abroad  will  have a stronger impact on the home-country venture investment environment. Venture capital access effects are magnified but business start-up and trade effects are diminished for remittances from immigrants living in more concentrated communities abroad. These results document support for key aspects of my theoretical framework, but also suggest the need for additional theoretical refinements and empirical analyses about whether and how immigrants of diverse backgrounds materially affect the home-country venture investment environment. These results and their implications compel future research by IB and entrepreneurship scholars, who should play a greater role in debates about whether and how immigrants can help build more open, vibrant economies in the developing world.  \n\n# BACKGROUNDCONCEPTS ANDLITERATURE  \n\n### Background Concepts, Practices and Trends  \n\nAdditional explanation of immigrant and remittance concepts, practices and trends provides helpful context for my theoretical framework and follow-on empirical  investigation.  Immigrants  coming to a country, emigrants leaving a country and migrants in transit between countries share in common the experience of living outside their country of origin, most often defined by their country of birth. They may be legal or illegal residents, temporary workers, displaced persons or hold some other status in the host country, short of citizen by birth. For the purposes of this study I define individuals in any of these  non-citizen  host-country  classifications  as \"immigrants\". In the 2000s this group grew to more than 200 million, which would make immigrants the fifth largest “country” in the world (United Nations, 2008).  \n\nRemittances are commonly defined as money transfers by immigrants in host countries to individuals in their home countries. Remittances comprise three components: workers’ remittances, compensation of employees, and migrant transfers.1 Remittances flow from individuals in host countries to home countries through either standard commercial or alternative conduits. Standard commercial conduits include money transfer organizations such as Western Union, banks and post offices (IFAD, 2009). There are alternative conduits, as simple as individuals carrying cash across borders, as well as more sophisticated debt-transfer practices based on hawala principles in classical Islamic law (Qorchi, Munzele-Maimbo, & Wilson, 2003). Such alternative conduits are important, although better monitoring of remittance flows for taxation and anti-terrorism purposes has increased the percentage flowing through standard commercial conduits since 2001  to  approximately $60\\%$ of estimated total remittances in 2009 (Moneygram, 2010).  \n\nBy 2007 remittances exceeded $\\$300$ billion, triple an  estimated $\\$100$ billion total in 2000. During those same years remittances became the second largest type of foreign capital flow to developing countries after foreign direct investment (FDl). In Mexico, India and China, annual recorded remittances in the mid-2000s exceeded $\\$20$ billion. In other less-developed countries the absolute value of annual recorded remittances is generally lower, but their relative importance could be even greater. For example, their value to Moldova in the mid-2000s was equal to more than $30\\%$ of its GDP (Moneygram, 2010; United Nations, 2008).  \n\nAt least three factors favor remittances as a source of venture investment in the developing world. First, compared with FDI or portfolio flows, remittances are a more stable and reliable source of potential capital (Ratha, 2003). After a slight downturn in 2008, remittances increased to $\\$316$ billion in 2009, and are estimated to reach $\\$335$ billion by the end of 2010 (Moneygram, 2010). Second, remittances tend to be lower-value, person-to-person (not person-to-firm or person-to-government) transfers suited well to smaller, lower-technology business start-ups in the developing world. Third, immigrant remittances tend to carry with them a substantial “social\" component. Levitt (1998) points out that remittances include new ideas and underlying relationships with people, who may have suggested a new business initiative to an immigrant in his or her host country, or who may have helped get the initiative up and running in his or her home country. Indeed, immigrants may have a comparative advantage at transferring such money and ideas across borders compared with other potential investors. As nationals who have \"made it\" abroad, they have greater legitimacy with peers in their home countries. Their proposals are likely to be perceived as \"new\" and worthy of closer review (Williams, 2o07). Thus remittances are more stable flows, geared to smaller-scale investments and benefitting from a substantial social component that includes internationally tested ideas and relationships for investment guidance.2  \n\nGiven this profile of immigrants, and given the sheer size, it might seem self-evident to conclude that immigrant money and ideas are significant and substantial inputs in the funding, founding and growth of new businesses back home. Yet researchers often assume, like Brown (2006: 61), that “as a rule, the predominant share of remittances goes to the immediate consumption of foodstuffs and basic services, with health care expenditure often featuring prominently\".  \n\nAgain, at least three factors help explain why business-related remittances in developing countries have attracted little attention in previous research. First, the evidentiary basis for understanding remittance uses rests substantially on the reported experience of US-based immigrants in the 1990s.3 The composition of remittance uses might be different outside the North American experience, particularly the composition of uses for increasingly large remittance flows between developing countries - so-called “South-South\" remittances.4 Second, this survey evidence from the 1990s precedes substantial growth in remittances since 2000.5 This trend could also signal a change in the composition of remittance uses, so that the 2000s could see that “a significant portion is also available for savings, credit mobilization and other forms of investment\" (IFAD, 2007). Third, research attention on migration has focused more often on the moral, legal and political issues  affecting  developing-country  immigrants (e.g., Trachtman, 2009). Tracking business-related activities among these individuals is often a secondorder issue for such researchers and policymakers.  \n\n### Relevant Literature on Immigrants, Remittances and Home-country Venture Investment  \n\nThis research and policy context might explain why IB and related entrepreneurship scholars have not to date paid greater attention to remittances as a source of venture capital, new business ideas and increased economic internationalization for developing economies. Guler and Guillén's (2010) recent study on the internationalization of US venture capital firms is illustrative. They test several hypotheses  regarding  institutional  determinants affecting the likelihood that US venture capital firms with marquee names such as Warburg Pincus will enter a new country. That likelihood decreases in countries with weaker policy stability, legal protection (for investors) and financial liquidity. One might easily conclude that new-venture funding, founding and growth depends substantially on the decisions of established investment firms (not individuals) that will be attracted to more (not less) developed countries with stronger (not weaker) formal political, legal and financial institutions.  \n\nBut perhaps it is more than just prominent venture capital firms playing important roles in guiding capital. From 1990 to 2003 it is estimated that approximately 55 million Chinese immigrants remitted close to $\\$60$ billion to Taiwan and mainland China. One beneficiary of these remittances was the Hinschu (or Hsinchu) Science-Based Industrial Park in Taiwan, where both venture firms and individuals helped fund computer and related information technology firms, and where $40\\%$ Of these ventures were established by Chinese immigrants (Ghosh, 2006; Saxenian & Hsu, 2001). The entrepreneurial activities of Indian nationals living abroad almost certainly contributed substantially to the growth and internationalization of the Indian software industry, which grew $40\\%$ in the 1990s (Kuznetsov & Sabel, 2006). These examples suggest the importance of transnational technical communities  for directing venture finance and ideas from host to home countries (Madhaven & Iriyama, 2009).  \n\nBut, in other developing countries, transnational entrepreneurs may lack technical training or higher education, yet still serve the same purpose of transferring valuable capital and ideas. Turkish nationals moving to and from Germany since the 1960s account for a substantial increase in new business start-ups, economic growth and exports in regions surrounding the ancient city of Corum on the Black Sea. These nationals exhibit no distinctive educational or technical training advantages. Rather, their success appears to follow from how they learn basic business skills abroad and bring them back with the help of family and community ties (Disbudak, 2004). International linkages based on family, ethnicity, culture and community may matter as much as (or more than) educational advantages.  \n\nSingle-country statistical studies in the 2000s convey a similar notion.Woodruff and Zenteno (2007) report that remittances from Mexican immigrants in the US since the 1990s account for $20{-}33\\%$ of invested capital in small firms from their home Mexican states. Increasing remittance shares of overall invested capital are also associated with higher firm sales and profits, suggesting that remittances represent \"smart\" venture capital. A follow-on study by Demirguc-Kunt, Lopez Cordova, Martinez Peria, and Woodruff (2011) finds that remittances to Mexico have also increased the depth and breadth of the Mexican banking system.° Dustmann and Kirkchamp (2002) report that approximately half of all immigrants returning to Turkey from Germany in the 1990s started new businesses within four years of their return. McCormick and Wahba (2003) find that proceeds from return migrants to Egypt promote investment in small household enterprises, particularly in urban areas. Kilic, Carletto, Davis, and Zezza (2007） correlate the length of stay abroad among Albanian migrant workers in the 1990s with a greater likelihood of starting a household enterprise. That likelihood is greater as the stay abroad increases in a country with a larger economy, presumably because the enterprise they start back home is connected to a larger market abroad.  \n\nThis brief review of relevant concepts and literature paints an interesting background for my study. The sheer size of remittances suggests their importance for study by IB and entrepreneurship scholars. There is mounting case study and singlecountry statistical evidence suggesting the significance and practical substantiality of remittances for new business funding, founding and growth through internationalization. Yet there has been little, if any, IB or entrepreneurship research touching on remittances, and none addressing the possibility that remittances might enhance capital availability, new business starts and other indicators of the home-country venture investment environment. Given this background, it is timely to develop broad sample cross-country evidence grounded in a theoretical framework familiar to IB and entrepreneurship scholars.  \n\n## THEORY AND HYPOTHESES  \n\n### Theoretical Grounding and Key Assumptions  \n\nTCE and social knowledge theories motivate my framework for understanding whether and how developing-country immigrant remittances enhance the home-country venture investment environment. My framework rests on two assumptions. First, and consistent with TCE theory (Coase, 1937; Henisz, 2000; Williamson, 1985), 1 assume that capital and knowledge flows to developing countries from “standard\" sources such as MNEs, including venture firms, are stifled by high international communication and coordination costs. These high costs are tied to the less-established and fluid nature of formal legal, political and financial institutions and practices in developing countries. Second, and consistent with social knowledge theory (Kogut & Zander, 1993, 1996; Polanyi, 1966), 1 assume that immigrants have access to informal relationships, principally tied to clan and community memberships that span host and home countries. These relationships compensate for formal institutional weaknesses, and permit transactions involving remittances for venture investment to go forward. I elaborate on theoretical bases for these two assumptions, on the resulting theoretical framework they motivate, and on specific predictions that the framework generates for empirical testing.  \n\n#### Developing TCE Aspects of the Theoretical Framework  \n\nEntrepreneurial activities tend to foster prosperity and growth in developing- and developed-country contexts. As Shane and Venkataraman (2000) note, these practices introduce new products, processes and ways of organizing businesses. They open up new markets, new supply chains and new labor sources. They lead to economic growth through the private sector rather than through state planning and policy interventions. In the more resourceconstrained developing countries of the 2000s, the desirability of entrepreneur-led economic growth is magnified. Yet for reasons familiar to IB and international entrepreneurship scholars, developing countries garner but a fraction of venture funding, founding and growth worldwide. Compared with most industrialized democracies, developing countries have fewer entrepreneurs willing and able to exploit new business opportunities. This could follow from emigration of more ambitious, creative, educated nationals - the so-called “brain drain\" (Adams, 2003). Even when there are new business opportunities, and motivated individuals willing to exploit the opportunities, venture capital is scarce, credit markets are turbulent, and start-up as well as growth funding is more challenging to obtain on reasonable terms - if any (Paulson & Townsend, 2004). At a higher institutional level, basic assumptions about the nature of contracts, property rights and public regulation of businesses are more vulnerable to being overturned in developing countries (Hoskisson, Eden, & Wright, 2000).  \n\nThese and other detriments to the ventureinvesting environment of developing countries are summarized well in TCE terms. Costs associated with coordinating the transfer of venture funds and ideas to developing countries deter many potential venture investors, particularly foreign-domiciled venture investors. From a Coasean (1937) TCE perspective, the benefits of investing in many developing countries may not exceed the high costs of negotiating, implementing, overseeing and, in the breach, coercing through legal enforcement terms of a given new business investment. From a Williamsonian (1985) TCE perspective, the greater prospect of opportunistic contractual breach and costly contractual renegotiation with developingcountry entrepreneurs deters many potential venture investors. Henisz (20oo) adds to this TCE perspective with insight into the more volatile investment environment that developing countries present. Developing countries with fewer policymaking “veto points\" also see more frequent changes in public investment policies over time. Policy instability about the rules of the investment game deters investment, particularly new business investment (Guler & Guillén, 2010).  \n\n#### Developing Social Knowledge Aspects of the TheoreticalFramework  \n\nIn this context, it is fair to ask why remitting immigrants might behave differently from so many others reluctant to fund, found and guide the growth of new firms in developing countries. The summary of background literature above has already  noted  case studies and  single-country statistical analyses documenting the quantity and quality of venture investing by immigrants from Albania (Kilic et al., 2007), China (Ghosh, 2006), Egypt (McCormick & Wahba, 2003), India (Kuznetsov & Sabel, 2006), Mexico (Demirguic-Kunt, Lopez Cordova, Martinez Peria & Woodruff, 2011; Woodruff & Zenteno, 2007), and Turkey (Disbudak, 2004; Dustmann & Kirkchamp, 2002). One recurring theme in this research is immigrant interest in going abroad to accrue business capital, experience and ideas (e.g., Dustmann & Kirkchamp, 2002). Another recurring theme is immigrant advantage in venture-investing activities compared with others. Education and (business) experience lead to more new venture discovery back home, while personal wealth makes those new ventures easier to fund (e.g., Ghosh, 2006). But those advantages are more exploitable because of dyadic host-home-country relationships grounded in common family, ethnicity, culture and/or community membership (e.g., Disbudak, 2004). Together, these themes suggest that immigrants may be a special case of Kirzner's (1997) entrepreneurs with superior (to other investor types) means to discover and exploit new business opportunities back home.  \n\nThat special case may be related to the concept of transnational entrepreneurs. Since at least the 1990s, scholars explaining the location and growth of industry clusters around the world have noted the important role of immigrants as technological and business innovators. Saxenian (1999, 2002) highlighted the important role of immigrants in building computer industry clusters in the US and Greater China. Portes, Haller, and Guarnizo (2002: 287) may have been first to use the term and describe transnational entrepreneurs as “selfemployed  immigrants whose business activities require frequent travel abroad and who depend for the success of their firms on their contacts and associates in another country, primarily their country of origin\". Drori, Honig, and Wright (2009: 1001-1002) elaborate on the concept from a resource-based perspective. The ability and willingness of transnational entrepreneurs to move frequently between host and home countries lets them “creatively, dynamically and logistically maximize their resources base” of valuable business ideas and contacts.  \n\nSuch transnational entrepreneurs almost certainly possess knowledge helpful in overcoming barriers to funding, founding and promoting the growth of new businesses through remittances. Their valuable cross-country relationships could follow from some of the network factors that Madhaven and Iriyama (2009) cite in defining and measuring the strength of transnational technical communities with advanced education, professional or technical training. Yet such elites constitute only a fraction of all developing-country immigrants, and their remittances constitute but a fraction of total flows. Any theoretical framework to explain how and why immigrant remittances may be better positioned for venture investment in developing countries requires grounding in social knowledge elements with a broader application.  \n\nThe clan concept helps broaden that application. The immigrant experience may engender clan-like relationships distinguished by norms of reciprocity, social solidarity, trust, mutual support and loyalty. If so, then clans become governance mechanisms where “common values and beliefs provide the harmony of interests that erase the possibility of opportunistic behavior\" (Ouchi, 1980: 138). When opportunistic behavior decreases, so too do the transaction costs of negotiating and overseeing the transfer of money and ideas for funding, founding and growing new firms back home. Ahlstrom and Bruton (2006) posit a similar notion from a network perspective. According to them, entrepreneurs operating in countries with less-established formal institutions build personal networks with more trustworthy exchange partners. McMillan and Woodruff (1999) explain the allocation of credit in Vietnam during the 1990s in similar terms. In the absence of enforceable contracts, lenders use informal relationships based on kinship to decide whether and how much credit to extend a business.  \n\nInformal relationships facilitating entrepreneurial flows can follow not only from clan but also from geographic community links. Webb et al. (2009) develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding new business funding, founding and growth based on informal, perhaps at times even illegal, but still legitimate community practices. Their framework explains, for instance, the creation and growth of ethnic “business enclaves\" where lending and investment are often initiated and enforced in the breach without recourse to contracts and courts. Threats of reputational loss, community ostracism, even coercion may be legitimate alternative means for ensuring the flow of new business capital and ideas in such communities (Portes & Sensenbrenner, 1993).7  \n\nWith notions of clan and community linking immigrants, I can now explain the flow of entrepreneurial money and ideas from host to home countries for a range of immigrants, not just immigrant elites. That flow follows from immigrant experience, skill development and insight gained in the host country, generating capital and ideas transferred to the home country through informal relationships related to immigrant clan and community membership. As part of this flow, immigrants are able to identify suitable business partners to fund, found and grow new ventures back home. Shared clan and community membership subjects these partners to informal oversight, decreasing the likelihood of any opportunistic misuse of immigrant funds and ideas. Even if TCE assumptions of opportunism are changed - treat local partners as completely trustworthy - shared clan and community membership still increases the likelihood of effective transmission of knowledge from the immigrant, particularly tacit knowledge based on immigrant experience and insight. This view is analogous to Kogut and Zander's (1993) knowledge theory of the MNC, which they explain as a response to difficulties in the cross-country articulation and transfer of complex, often tacit, knowledge. Just as shared corporate membership within the MNC enhances cross-country understanding between individuals, so shared clan and community membership enhances cross-country understanding about new venture ideas immigrants and business partners implement. These cross-country relationships become valuable resources that immigrants maintain  through periodic transnational communication and travel.  \n\n### Derived Hypotheses for Testing  \n\nMy theoretical framework implies several testable predictions about the attributes  of developingcountry immigrants, their informal cross-country relationships, their interest in and opportunity to use remittances for entrepreneurial purposes, and the prospective impact of their remittances on the home-country venture investment environment. I leave many such predictions to future studies, but focus in this study on five specific predictions related to the direct and indirect impact of remittances on venture investment funding, founding and growth through internationalization.  \n\nI turn first to three hypotheses about the direct effects of immigrant remittances on the venture investment environment in developing countries. Consistent with my framework, I first predict that remittances from developing-country immigrants are “smart\" money, capable of enhancing the quantity and quality of scarce venture capital in their home countries. This prediction competes with a plausible null hypothesis that remittances in developing countries are dominated by non-business subsistence priorities. An alternative null hypothesis could follow from home-country intermediaries, such as developing-country governments, reducing intended entrepreneurial flows to insignificant levels through taxation or other policy diversion. Hypothesis 1 rejects these alternatives in predicting that:  \n\nHypothesis 1: There is a positive relationship between  immigrant remittances and  venture capital availability in developing countries.  \n\nMy framework also suggests that remittances represent more than just money for venture investing. They also include actionable ideas for founding new businesses. Again, this prediction competes with plausible null hypotheses about the subsistence rather than the entrepreneurial nature of remittances, and with the neutralizing effects of government intermediaries. Yet another competing null hypothesis admits the impact of remittances on venture capital funding but not on founding. It could be that the cross-country clan- and community-based relationships I have articulated limit immigrant participation to that of a passive investor or lender rather than a material player in founding new businesses. Alternatively, state policy could encourage the accumulation of venture funds to create fewer but larger enterprises, perhaps with state involvement as a co-investor. Such a scenario could see increasing access to capital without substantial increase in rates of new business starts. Hypothesis 2 rejects these alternatives in predicting that:  \n\nHypothesis 2: There is a positive relationship between immigrant remittances and new business founding rates in developing countries.  \n\nMy framework also suggests that remittances do more than connect immigrants to their home countries as venture funders and founders. These connections engender  a broader openness to trade between countries. Leblang (2010) documents greater FDI and portfolio investment between countries with stronger immigrant diaspora network links. Gould (1994) has shown that immigrant business relationships based on common ethnicity and cultural heritage are associated with an increase in bilateral international trade between US and immigrants' home countries. Tung and Chung (201o) document similar trends for Chinese immigrant businesses in Australasia. Chung (2004) and Chung, Enderwick, and Jinda-Naruemitmongkonsuk (2010) record that immigrant business executives with knowledge straddling home and host countries are vital for successful entry and adaptation strategies in international markets. Consistent with these papers and my framework, I predict that immigrant remittances will engender other economic flows, increasing the international engagement   of  developing-country businesses. Hypothesis 3 thus  connects micro individual activities to broader country-wide trends in predicting that:  \n\nHypothesis 3: There is a positive relationship between immigrant remittances and the level of economic internationalization in developing countries.  \n\nThese direct effects could be moderated by TCE and/or social knowledge characteristics of the immigrant investor or investor group. My framework highlights two such moderators. I have already noted Madhaven and Iriyama's (2009) network-related theory and  evidence  suggesting that better-educated immigrants are also more capable of conveying entrepreneurial money and ideas internationally. Their evidence contributes to a longer-running research stream on the mobility of better-skilled immigrants, and what their departure from the home country does to induce a brain drain detracting from economic growth (Docquier & Marfouk, 2006). If remittances constitute partial compensation for that brain drain, then that partial compensation is greater to the extent that the remittances come from immigrants with better education. Hypothesis 4 does not reject the importance of shared clan and community membership. It assumes that shared educational background strengthens these more broadly based connections in predicting that:  \n\nHypothesis 4: The positive impact of immigrant remittances on the developing-country venture investment environment is greater for developing countries with better-educated immigrants.  \n\nCollective  immigrant  characteristics  may  also moderate the venture investment impact of remittances. One such characteristic relates to the concentration of an immigrant community. Business enclaves analyzed by Webb et al. (2009) often develop around facilities and conventions that have public good attributes. Use by one enclave member does not exclude another's use, and often decreases the cost and increases the effectiveness of use by both. The creation and growth of major financial institutions in immigrant communities of the US follows this logic. The Bank of America originated in the Italian immigrant community of San Francisco in the early 19o0s, and Thrivent Financial for Lutherans began life as a fraternal organization in the early 19o0s serving the financial services needs of Scandinavian immigrant communities in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Both served concentrated immigrant communities. Remittance services figured in the early growth of both firms.  \n\nWell-defined   and  geographically  proximate immigrant communities also promote the development of public conventions decreasing remittance transaction costs and diffusing more readily knowledge about prospective remittance uses. Remittance transactions in Muslim communities of North Africa and the Middle East are still guided by informal debt-transfer practices based on hawala principles in classical Islamic law (Qorchi et al., 2003). Like Hypothesis 4, Hypothesis 5 builds on basic framework assumptions, and emphasizes the venture investment advantages of immigrant concentration in predicting that:  \n\nHypothesis 5: The positive impact of immigrant remittances on the developing-country venture investment environment is greater for developing countries with more concentrated  immigrant communities abroad.  \n\n![](images/7c3fb837a72400c98987be44c6cbd375beb9b4525e4c6e0c64a94b86318c0fb1.jpg)  \nFigure 1  Hypotheses derived from theoretical framework  \n\nThese five predictions are summarized in Figure 1. Informal  cross-country  relationships  decreasing transaction costs and increasing transaction knowledge permit developing-country immigrants to remit money and ideas directly, enhancing the overall venture-investing environment back home. The direct impact of remittances is, in turn, moderated positively by individual and collective factors related to immigrants in host countries.  \n\n## EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY  \n\n### Empirical Equation Terms  \n\nTo assess empirical support for these five predic tions I define the equation below:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{Y_{i j t}=\\displaystyle{\\alpha+\\sum_{k=1}^{k=9}\\lambda_{i j t,t-1}C o n t r o l s+\\beta_{1}R e m i t t a n c e s_{i j t,t-1}}}}\\ {{\\qquad+\\displaystyle{\\sum_{m=1}^{m-q}\\phi_{m}M o d e r a t o r s_{i j}}+\\displaystyle{\\sum_{t=2004}^{t=2007}\\xi_{t}Y e a r s}}}\\ {{\\qquad+\\displaystyle{\\sum_{j=1}^{j=5}\\gamma_{j}R e g i o n s+\\varepsilon_{i j t}}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nDetails regarding all individual terms of Eq. (1) are provided in Table 1. The dependent variable, $Y_{i j t},$ is measured differently depending on which hypothesis I am testing, but subscripts for country $i,$ geographic region $j$ and year $t$ remain the same. The dependent variable is regressed on an intercept $(\\alpha)$ ， a series of country $i$ controls (Controls), country $i$ remittances (Remittances), moderators to assess differences in remittance effects (Moderators), and fixed effects related to the year $t$ (Years) and geographic region j (Regions) of a given observation.  \n\nI exclude moderators from Eq. (1) for initial testing of Hypotheses 1-3 concerning the direct impact of remittances on alternative indicators of the homecountry venture investment environment. Hypothesis 1 predicts a positive relationship between remittances and capital available to entrepreneurs back home. I measure $Y_{i j t}$ as capital availability in two ways. One measure, General Capital Access, is a 0-10 ( $0{=}.$ low, $10\\mathrm{=}$ high) composite index number for country $i$ in region $j$ in year $t$ based on annual assessments of seven components by researchers at the Michael Milken Institute (Apinard et al., 2002-2008): macroeconomic environment, institutional environment, financial industry development, equity market development, bond market development, international funding and “alternative sources of capital\". In the sample described below, General Access to Capital ranges from 2.09 (Haiti in 2007) to 7.22 (Malaysia in 2004).  \n\nA second measure, Venture Capital Access, is based solely on the alternative sources of capital component of General Capital Access. It again comes from researchers at the Milken Institute (Apinard et al., 2002-2008), and is once more measured as a 0-10 index. Venture Capital Access index numbers are based on evaluation of three factors: venture capital, private placements and credit cards. Values range from 0 (Mozambique in 2006) to 6.26 (India in 2004). Thus there are both broadly and narrowly defined indicators of capital availability to evaluate Hypothesis $^{1^{\\prime}s}$ prediction that remittances enhance home-country venture funding.  \n\nTo evaluate support for Hypothesis $2^{\\prime}s$ prediction that remittances enhance home-country venture foundings, I measure $Y_{i j t}$ as the annual count of newly registered corporations  for country $i$ in region $j$ in year $t.$ This New Business Creation count includes businesses that are incorporated as a legal entity and registered in a public registry, but does not include other unregistered business starts (World Bank, 201o). Annual new business counts range from 2 (Haiti in 2002) to 529,416 (Brazil in 2007) in my sample. This count likely understates actual new business starts in less-developed countries with fewer regulatory resources or greater government corruption. I explore the implications of such understatement in analyses below.  \n\nTo evaluate Hypothesis $3^{\\prime}s$ prediction that remittances enhance broader country openness to trade, I also measure $Y_{i j t}$ as the sum of imports and exports divided by GDP for country $i$ in region $j$ in year t.  \n\nTable 1  Variables list for analyses of remittances and the developing-country venture investment environment, 2002-2007   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variablename</td><td>Variable description</td><td>Source</td><td>Expected sign</td></tr><tr><td>General Capital Access (Yijt)</td><td>0-10 integralmeasure of thebreadth,depth and vitalityofcapitalmarkets,andopennessinproviding accesswithoutdiscriminationtoentrepreneursfor country i in region j averaged over years t and t-1.</td><td>MilkenInstitute Capital Access Index(Apinard et al., 2002-2008)</td><td>H1, H4, H5: dependel variable (DV)</td></tr><tr><td>Venture Capital Access (Yijt)</td><td>0=low,10=high 0-10 integral measure depth, breadth and vitality of specific capital market sources such as venture capital, private placements and credit cards for country i in region j averaged over years t and t-1. 0=low,</td><td>Milken Institute Capital Access Index (Apinard et al., 2002-2008)</td><td>H2, H4, H5: DV</td></tr><tr><td>New Firm Creation(Yijt)</td><td>10=high The number of newlyregistered corporations for countryiinregionjinyear t</td><td>World Bank, Doing Business Database(World Bank,2010)</td><td>H2,H4, H5:DV</td></tr><tr><td>EconomicInternationalization (Yijt)</td><td>Sum of exports and imports divided by gross national income inUS dollars for countryiinregionj in yeart</td><td>World Bank,World Development Indicators</td><td>H3, H4, H5: DV</td></tr><tr><td>Economic Size()</td><td>Natural log of GDP in US dollars for country i in region javeragedoveryearst andt-1</td><td>(World Bank, 2010) World Bank,World Development Indicators</td><td>+except when DV is Economic</td></tr><tr><td>Economic Growth(2)</td><td>Real annual percentage growth in GDP for countryiin regionj averagedoveryearst andt-1</td><td>(World Bank, 2010) World Bank, World Development Indicators</td><td>Internationalization，- +</td></tr><tr><td>Inflation()</td><td>Consumer price inflation percentage for country i in region j averaged over years t and t-1</td><td>(World Bank, 2010) World Bank,World Development Indicators</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Per Capita Income (24)</td><td>Per capita gross national income for country iin region j averaged over years t and t-1</td><td>(World Bank, 2010) World Bank, World Development Indicators</td><td>+</td></tr><tr><td>Common Law (7s)</td><td>0-1 dummy,where1=commonlaw origin.

In the sample, trade openness ranges from 0.26 or $26\\%$ of GDP (Brazil in 2002) to 2.13 or $213\\%$ of GDP (Malaysia in 2002).  \n\nThe key right-hand side term of Eq. (1） for Hypotheses 1-3 is Remittances, which is measured as the per capita sum of workers' remittances, compensation of employees and migrant transfers in thousands of US dollars for country i in region $j$ averaged overyears $t$ and $t{-}1$ . As with other control terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (1), I measure Remittances as a two-year moving average to capture both contemporaneous and lagged effects on the dependent variables. In the sample, values of Remittances range from nil (Malawi in 2007） to 1.320r $\\$1320$ per home-country resident (Lebanon in 2005). Consistent with Hypotheses 1-5, I expect the coefficient on Remittances to be positive.  \n\nTo account for other factors explaining variation in dependent variables, $Y_{i j t},$ I also include nine country controls $(C o n t r o l s_{\\lambda1-9})$ used in recent management research (e.g., Vaaler, 2008) and in related political economy research (e.g., Henisz, 200o) to explain overall country attractiveness for lending, investment and new business project establishment: economic size, economic growth, per capita income, inflation, common law legal system, rule of law quality, lack of political rights, FDI inflow, and the share of GDP accounted for by government and state-owned enterprises. Table 1 describes these controls, including their measurement, data sources and expected sign in estimations. They are measured as two-year moving averages to capture both contemporaneous and lagged effects.  \n\nTo capture other unspecified effects, I also include 0-1 year (Years) and geographic region (Regions) dummies. The first year observed for the dependent variable in the sample, 2002, is omitted, and five 0-1 year dummies for years 2003-2007 are included. I also define a scheme of six geographic regions ( $1=$ East Asia & Pacific, $2{=}$ Europe & Central Asia, $3{=}$ Latin America & Caribbean, $4{=}$ Middle East & North Africa, $5{=}5$ South Asia, $6\\mathrm{=}$ sub-Saharan Africa), omit the final region, sub-Saharan Africa, and include five O-1 dummies for others.  \n\nTo test Hypotheses 4-5 regarding individual and collective immigrant factors possibly magnifying the effect of remittances on venture investment indicators back home, I include additional moderator terms, most importantly interaction terms combining Remittances with one of two terms corresponding to proposed moderator effects. The interaction terms capture differences in the impact of Remittances on the home-country venture investment environment. These moderators vary across countries i but are fixed rather than varying across yearst.  \n\nTo test Hypothesis 4's prediction that immigrant skill level magnifies the impact of remittances on various indicators of the home-country  venture investment environment, I include an interaction term combining Remittances with Immigrant Skill (IS × Remittances). Immigrant Skill is based on the fraction of immigrants from country $i$ of region $j$ living abroad in 2000 with tertiary $(+13$ years) education (Docquier & Marfouk, 2006). Measures vary from 0.09 or $9\\%$ of immigrants (Turkey) to 0.67 or $67\\%$ of immigrants (Philippines), with a mean of 0.41 $(41\\%)$ and a standard deviation of 0.15. I define Immigrant Skill as a O-1 dummy, where 1 indicates a country with more than 0.50 (top quartile of education for immigrants from all countries sampled) of immigrants in 2000 with tertiary education. Consistent with Hypothesis 4, I expect the $I S\\times$ Remittances interaction term to be positive.  \n\nTo test Hypothesis $5^{\\prime}s$ prediction that immigrant community concentration magnifies remittance impact on venture investment back home, Iinclude an interaction term combining Remittances with Immigrant Concentration（ $I C\\times R$ emittances).Immigrant Concentration is based on a HerfindahlHirschman Index (HHl) number running from 0 to 1, with values near 1 indicating greater immigrant community concentration across all host countries, and values near O indicating greater immigrant community diffuseness across all host countries. Immigrant Concentration is derived by first squaring and then summing fractions of immigrants from country i of region j living in each host country in 200o (Parsons, Skeldon, Walmsley, & Winters, 2007; United Nations, 2004). The resulting HHI numbers range from 0.075 (India) to 0.85 (Mexico), with a mean of 0.26 and a standard deviation of 0.18. 1 define Immigrant Concentration as a O-1 dummy, where 1 indicates a country with an HHI number greater than 0.35 (top quartile of concentration for immigrants from all countries sampled) in 2000. Consistent with Hypothesis 5, I expect the $I C\\times R$ emittances interaction term to be positive.  \n\n### Estimation Strategy  \n\nI use Stata Version 11.0 (StataCorp, 2009) for all analyses. For an initial understanding of cross-country trends related to Hypotheses 1-3, I present results from non-parametric, locally weighted, scatter-plot smoothed (\"Lowess\" or “lowess\" command in Stata) analyses with Remittances on the $x$ -axis and one of four different measures of the dependent variable, $Y_{i j t},$ on the $\\gamma$ -axis. Lowess analyses compute linear regressions around each observation of Remittancesijt, with neighborhood observations chosen within some sampling bandwidth and weighted by a tri-cubic function. Based on the estimated regression parameters, $Y_{i j t}$ values are computed. Combinations of Remittances $({\\romannumeral1})t$ and $Y_{i j t}$ are then connected, yielding a Lowess curve. A higher bandwidth results in a smoother Lowess curve. I use the default bandwidth, sampling $40\\%$ of the observations to the left and right of each pair of Remittancesijt and $Y_{i j t}$ values.  \n\nI then turn to multivariate estimations of Eq. (1) to test Hypotheses 1-5. 1 have unbalanced panel data with missing data for certain countries $i$ (in regions $j_{\\cdot}$ ) and years t. When the dependent variable, $Y_{i j t},$ is General Capital Access, Venture Capital Access or Economic Internationalization, I use linear estimators. I start with ordinary least-squares regression（ $\\because{\\mathrm{{OLS}^{\\prime\\prime}}}$ or $\\mathrm{^{//}r e g^{\\prime\\prime}}$ command in Stata) and the nine country controls. These OLS estimations provide an overall sense of equation explanation. I then implement several panel-feasible generalized least squares estimations $\\overset{}{}^{/\\prime}G\\mathrm{L}S^{\\prime\\prime}$ Or “xtgls\" command in Stata) with robust (to panel heteroskedasticity) standard errors and panel-specific first-order autoregressive processes. To assess the robustness of these findings to possible endogeneity issues, I also present results based on a third generalized method of moments (GMM) dynamic panel estimator based on research by Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell and Bond (1998) (\"DPDSYS\" or \"xtdpdsys\" command in Stata). The dynamic panel estimator includes plausibly exogenous instruments based on lags of left-hand-side dependent and possibly endogenous or predetermined righthand-side variables. The lagged dependent variable also acts as a “catch-all\" control capturing past effects on venture investment indicators not otherwise covered in Eq. (1).  \n\nWhen $Y_{i j t}$ is New Business Creation I am using annual count measures, thus a nonlinear estimator is appropriate. Preliminary investigation of the sample suggests over-dispersion, so I use negative binomial estimation ( $\\mathrm{^{//}N B R^{\\prime\\prime}}$ or “nbreg\" command in Stata), again with robust standards. For each set of regressions based on Eq. (1), I begin with the nine controls, then add Remittances, and then add year and region dummies. For examination of moderator effects, I add moderators to Eq. (1). I then report results for each of the four venture investment indicators after estimation with other right-hand-side controls and dummies. I use a simulation approach to assess the practical impact of these interactions.  \n\n### Sampling and Data Sources  \n\nI sample from 61 non-OECD countries and countries comprising popular developing-country investment indices (e.g., J.P. Morgan Emerging Market Bond Index) for which remittance and venture investment environment data are available from 2002 to 2007.8 This period saw steady growth in remittances between global economic shocks tied to the terrorist attacks of 2o01 and US and European financial crises in 2o08. These years also saw better monitoring of remittance flows for taxation and anti-terrorism purposes, as well as better harmonization of remittance accounting and compilation, thanks in part to work by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank (IMF, 2009; Reinke, 2007; World Bank, 2006). These attributes probably decrease potential measurement error of this key variable compared with other empirical studies using remittance data from the 1990s and earlier (e.g., Aggarwal, Demirgic-Kunt, & Martinez Peria, 2010).  \n\nData availability varies for the four dependent variable measures, thus sample size and scope of developing-country coverage also vary. In testing Hypotheses 1-3, sample scope and size decrease as the dependent variable switches from General Capital Access and Economic Internationalization(61 countries and 348 country-year observations), to Venture Capital Access (59 countries and 304 countryyear observations),to New Business Creation (45 countries and 209 country-year observations).  \n\nData for the study come from several sources. Annual data on General Capital Access and Venture Capital Access come from Milken Institute Capital Access indices, which have gained usage in recent cross-country finance research (e.g., Doidge, Karolyi, & Stulz, 2004). These indices are measured from 0 to 7 up to 2002, and then from 0 to 10 through 2007. 1 convert all General Capital Access and Venture Capital Access measures to the O-10 scale. Data on New Business Creation come from the World Bank Doing Business Database available as part of the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WD1) (World Bank, 2010). Annual data onEconomicInternationalization alsocomefrom the WDI. Annual data for the nine country controls in  \n\nEq. (1) come from the WDI (Economic Size, Economic Growth, Inflation, Per Capita Income, FDI Inflow, State Share of Economy), the CIA World Factbook (CIA, 2005) (Common Law), Freedom House (2010) (Political Rights (Lack of), and Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi (2008) (Rule of Law). Annual data on Remittances come from the World Bank Development Prospects Database and the IMF's Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. These data are again available through the WDI (World Bank, 2010).  \n\nData on Immigrant Skill come from study of mobility among skilled immigrants in 2000 generated by Docquier and Marfouk (2006). The United Nations (2004) and Parsons et al.(2007) provide bilateral country data on immigrants in 20o0 to permit generation of Immigrant Concentration values. Both data sources merit additional explanation. Parsons et al. (2007) draw on 2000 or near2000 year census data primarily from the United Nations (2004) covering 226 countries and territories, including those countries sampled in this study. The definition of a “migrant\" is often based on place of birth vs residence, but some countries use different criteria. Parsons et al. describe how such differences are harmonized and adjusted to permit better comparability of resulting figures for research and policymaking purposes. I use Version 4a (United Nations, 2004) of the bilateral migration data, generally considered the most comparable source for research purposes.  \n\nDocquier and Marfouk (2006) draw on a less sweeping range of census and registration data to estimate immigrant education levels in 2ooo for 195 countries, including those I analyze below. They work with census and registration data from all OECD countries and six non-OECD countries. Census and registration data on immigrant education for 20oo are less reliable or non-existent in many non-OECD countries. Docquier and Marfouk work on the assumption that the education level of immigrants living in non-OECD countries is, with few exceptions, quite low. Thus it is possible that they underestimate  immigrant education levels for a few developing countries with more “SouthSouth\" rather than \"South-North\" migration patterns. That said, I know of no better source for standardized cross-country data on  immigrant education and training levels.9  \n\nThe sample reveals substantial variation across developing countries. Average remittances from 2002 to 2007 are equal to at least $10\\%$ of GDP for 12 of 61 countries sampled. Average remittances over that same period for less-developed countries such as Haiti (\\$897 million), Jordan $(\\$2.428$ billion), Lebanon $(\\$4.399$ billion)and Moldova (\\$723 million) are equal to or more than $20\\%$ of each country's GDP. Average remittances over that same period for more prominent emerging-market countries such as Brazil $(\\$3.274$ billion), Russia (\\$2.388 billion), India $\\left(\\$20.497$ billion), China (\\$18.266 billion) and Mexico ( $\\$17.984$ billion) are generally much higher absolutely, but never reach even $3\\%$ of each country's GDP. Such sample characteristics suggest greater potential for enhancement of the venture investment environment in less-developed countries. I investigate this possibility in analyses below.  \n\n## RESULTS  \n\n### Descriptive Statistics, Pairwise Correlations and Non-parametric Analyses  \n\nTable 2 reports descriptive statistics and pairwise correlations for all variables used in our analyses. Remittances are, on average, approximately $\\$100$ per person (O.1o) annually, with two thirds of the countries lying between $\\$0$ and almost $\\$250$ .El Salvador (\\$350), Jordan (\\$435), Jamaica (\\$440) and Lebanon (\\$1320) exhibit the highest average annual per capita remittances in the sample. As yet another indication of their practical impact, these per capita remittance figures comprise from about one sixth (for El Salvador and Jamaica) to nearly one fourth (for Jordan and Lebanon) of total per capita income.  \n\nMost means and standard deviations for the right-hand-side terms of Eq. (1) indicate trends consistent with commonly held assumptions about the venture investment environment of developing countries. For example, sample means for General Capital Access (4.22) and Venture Capital Access (2.66) on a 0-10 scale are consistent with assumptions of relative capital scarcity in developing countries compared with mean levels of General Capital Access (7.o1） and Venture Capital Access (5.20) for developed (OECD) countries during the same years. Other mean values follow developingcountry assumptions of higher (than industrialized country) economic growth rates $(5.24\\%)$ and inflation rates $(8.18\\%)$ , and lower per capita annual income (2.45 or $\\$2450$ ) and rule of law $(-0.40)$ indicating less than average respect for law, legal processes and legal officialdom.  \n\nPairwise correlations indicate that Remittances is positively related (as expected) to General Capital Access,Economic Internationalization and Venture  \n\n7alqe1   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>0.33 0.34** -0.09</td></tr><tr><td>-0.11* 0.66** 460'0</td></tr><tr><td>-0.18** 0.46** -0.20** -0.05</td></tr><tr><td>0.29** -0.20** 0.24** 0.17** 0.23</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>0.08 -0.03 -0.09t -0.04 -0.06 0.07</td></tr><tr><td>0.16**</td></tr><tr><td>-0.11* -0.12** 0.08 -0.08 0.04 0.07</td></tr><tr><td>-0.36** 0.41** 0.21** -0.24** -0.24** -0.13** 0.04 0.09</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>0.13** -0.13** -0.11* -0.13** 0.04 -0.04 -0.10* 0.06 -0.02</td></tr><tr><td>0.09 -0.20** -0.09 -0.15** -0.16** 0.06 0.00 $60:0-</td></tr><tr><td>-0.05 -0.01</td></tr><tr><td>-0.22** 0.51** -0.29** 0.16** 0.37** 0.16** 0.25** -0.04 -0.04 0.05 0.05</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>-0.13** 0.11* 0.19** -0.10* -0.14** 0.11** 0.02 -0.00 0.04 -0.05 0.08 -0.08 0.11* 0.38** 0.60** 0.14** 0.17** -0.13** -0.11*</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nCapital Access, with the first two correlations significant at the $1\\%$ level. Remittances exhibits a negative correlation with New Business Creation, although the correlation is not significant at commonly accepted levels. Aside from interaction terms, Remittances exhibits no high pairwise correlations with other independent variables, thus indicating that severe multicollinearity affecting multivariate estimates is unlikely.  \n\nNon-parametric, bivariate Lowess analyses in Figures 2(a)-(d) expand on these initial insights, and provide preliminary evidence related Hypotheses 1-3. Below the sample average (0.10 or $\\$100$ per capita annual remittances), an increase in Remittances  leads to  steeply  increasing  General Capital Access, Venture Capital Access and Economic Internationalization in Figures 2(a), (b) and (d). The positive trend line is consistent at different corresponding values of Remittances and General Capital Access or Economic Internationalization in Figures 2(a)-(d). Indeed, the trend line starts sharply positive for corresponding values of Remittances and Venture Capital Access, but then levels off and even turns down slightly at high levels of Remittances. The trend line for corresponding values of Remittances and New Business Creation in Figure 2(c) presents an anomaly. I convert the count of new businesses into a percentage rate of new business starts to yield more intuitive linear estimates. Generally, increasing levels of Remittances lead to lower (not higher) new business start rates. Thus I observe preliminary evidence supporting Hypotheses 1 and 3. Immigrant remittances are positively related to the availability of venture capital, whether broadly or narrowly assessed. Remittances are also positively related to broader economic internationalization. But rates of new business creation exhibit trends contrary to Hypothesis $2^{\\prime}s$ prediction of increased venture foundings as immigrants remit money and ideas.  \n\n#### Multivariate Regression Results: Direct Effects (Hypotheses 1-3)  \n\nResults from multivariate regression analyses of direct effects related to Hypotheses 1-3 are presented in Tables 3-5. Table 3 presents results from multivariate regression analyses where the dependent variables are General Capital Access (columns 1-4) or Venture Capital Access (columns 5 and 6).10 They permit formal tests of Hypothesis 1 and the predicted positive relationship between developing-country remittances and home-country capital availability. OLS results in column 1 largely follow expectations. In regressing General Capital Access on an intercept and nine country controls only, I find that seven Controls exhibit the expected signs and six do so at $5\\%$ Or $1\\%$ levels of statistical significance. OLS estimation explains almost two thirds $(R^{2}{=}0.63)$ of variation in this broad indicator of capital availability. Thus I move to more refined estimators and equation specifications with substantial assurance of a well-specified base equation. In column 2, OLS is replaced with panel GLS including robust (to panel heteroskedasticity) standard errors and panel-specific corrections for firstorder auto-correlation.

OLS refers to ordinary least-squares estimation. FGLS refers to panel-feasible generalized least-square estimation with robust Huber-White sandwich standard errors and panel (country) specific first-order autoregressive processes. GCA refers to General Capital Access as the dependent variable. VCA refers to Venture Capital Access as the dependent variable. Regression results for region and year dummies are available onrequest. $^{\\star\\star}p<0.01$ ${^\\star}p{<}0.05$ $\\stackrel{\\cdot}{p}<0.10$  \n\nColumns 3 and 4 of Table 3 report panel GLS results with the addition of Remittances. In column 3,Remittances (O.81) enters with a positive sign statistically significant at the $1\\%$ level. It remains so after the addition of year and region dummies in column 4 (0.77). Both results support Hypothesis 1. Although integral in nature, General Capital Access and Venture Capital Access measures are often used in practice by researchers and analysts to rank countries and assess changes in ranking over time. Given results in columns 3 and 4, an increase of one standard deviation $0.18{=}\\$180$ ）above the mean per capita  remittance level $(0.10{=}\\$100)$ ）raises a country's General Capital Access score from the mean of 4.22 to 4.36, based on results in column 4 $(4.22+(0.18\\times0.77){=}4.36\\$ ）and 4.37 based on results in column 3 $(4.22+(0.18\\times0.81){=}4.37$ Such an increase translates into a rank increase of about four levels on the Milken Institute index. From 2004 to 2005, 33 of 99 developing countries ranked by the Milken Institute moved up or down fewer than three levels, and 56 of 99 developing countries moved up or down fewer than five levels. Thus a move of four levels has practical importance for ranking purposes.  \n\nWhen I replace General Capital Access with the more narrowly defined measure Venture Capital Access, results are mixed. Consistent with Hypothesis 1, 1 find in column 5 that Remittances (0.62) enters with a positive sign statistically significant at the $5\\%$ level. An increase of one standard deviation above the mean per capita remittance level raises a country's Venture Capital Access score from the mean of 2.63 to 2.74 $(2.76+(0.18\\times0.62){=}2.74,$ That increase in score would move a country up three rank levels on the Milken Institute index in a given year. But this supporting evidence is not confirmed in column 6, where I add year and region dummies to Eq. (1). After these additions, the coefficient for Remittances exhibits the wrong (negative) sign, and is not significant at commonly accepted levels.  \n\nTogether with the bivariate Lowess analyses, these multivariate analyses indicate substantial but not complete support for Hypothesis 1, and the claim that immigrant remittances materially  enhance home-country capital availability. The evidence is strong for general capital availability. For more narrowly focused venture capital availability, there is also supporting evidence, but additional confirmation is warranted.  \n\nColumns 1-5 of Table 4 report results for New Business Creation as the dependent variable.11 Column 1's NBR estimation of count data yields five of nine control terms with predicted signs statistically significant at $5\\%$ or $1\\%$ levels. These country-level  controls  are  jointly  significant  in explaining annual counts of newly  registered businesses (Wald $\\chi^{2}=1134.21$ ， $p{<}0.01\\$ . They also have substantial practical impact, as I demonstrate by transforming NBR coefficients into more readily interpretable terms indicating impact on the rate of new business creation. For example, I transform the column 1 NBR estimate for Economic Growth (0.10) using the following formula: $100\\%\\times$ $[\\exp(0.10)-1]{=}10.5\\%$ . Increasing annual economic growth by one percentage point increases the rate of new business creation by $10.5\\%$ , holding other factors at their mean levels. Increasing the (lack of） Political Rights in a country by one unit $(100\\%\\times[\\exp(-0.10)-1]{=}{-}9.5\\%)$ decreases the rate of new business creation by $9.5\\%$ , again with other factors held at their mean levels.  \n\nColumns 2 and 3 then add Remittances to the base equation. In neither column does the coefficient for Remittances enter with significance at commonly accepted levels of statistical significance. Reviewed with the Lowess analyses exhibited in Figure 2(c) above, these multivariate results do not support Hypothesis 2, and raise additional doubt about any direct relationship between immigrant remittances and new business founding rates in developing countries.  \n\nBut perhaps that relationship is more nuanced. In  developing  my  framework  and  formulating Hypothesis 2, I noted plausible alternative arguments that could neutralize business start-up enhancement that immigrant money and ideas could promote. One such argument related to country-level policy choices, such as the choice between lower or higher taxation, and public-sector-led or private-sector-led economic growth. Countries preferring higher state taxation rates or more involvement by state agencies or enterprises in economic development could “crowd out\" private players, including would-be venture investors living abroad. If so, then the impact of remittances on new business starts might still be positive, but only when state economic involvement is low enough to create space for cross-country immigrant ventures. I1 investigate empirical support for that possibility in columns 4-5 of Table 4. There, I interact the country-level variable State Share of the Economy with Remittances. Consistent with the conjecture above, I expect a negative sign on this interaction term. Second, I expect a positive sign on Remittances alone, thus indicating that immigrant money and ideas do stimulate home-country business creation, but only when the public sector is sufficiently small.  \n\n'able 4 Regression analyses of remittances and new business creation (columns 1-5) and economic internationalization (columns 6-9), 2002-2007   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variables</td><td colspan=\"10\">Estimators</td><td colspan=\"4\"></td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">Controls only</td><td colspan=\"6\">Controls, remittances</td><td colspan=\"2\">Controls only</td><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">Controls, remittances</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td></td><td>(4)</td><td></td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td><td></td><td>(2)</td><td>(8)</td><td></td><td>(6)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>NBR, NBC</td><td>NBR, NBC</td><td></td><td>NBR, NBC</td><td></td><td>NBR, NBC</td><td>NBR, NBC</td><td></td><td>OLS, EI</td><td></td><td>FGLS, EI</td><td>FGLS, EI</td><td></td><td>FGLS, EI</td></tr><tr><td>Constant (α)</td><td>-9.21** (1.41)</td><td>-8.72**</td><td>(1.58)</td><td>-12.72**</td><td>(1.50)</td><td>-9.31** (1.54)</td><td>-12.87**</td><td>(1.51)</td><td>3.02**</td><td>(0.35)</td><td>3.04** (0.22)</td><td>2.67**</td><td>(0.19)</td><td>2.86** (0.19)</td></tr><tr><td>Economic Size()</td><td>0.70**</td><td>(0.06) 0.68**</td><td>(0.07)</td><td>0.87**</td><td>(0.07)</td><td>0.69** (0.06)</td><td></td><td>0.87** (0.07)</td><td>-0.10**</td><td>(0.01)</td><td>-0.10** (0.01)</td><td>-0.09**</td><td>(0.01) -0.10**</td><td>(0.01)</td></tr><tr><td>Economic Growth (22)</td><td>0.10** (0.02)</td><td>0.09**</td><td>(0.02)</td><td>0.03t</td><td>(0.02)</td><td>0.09** (0.02)</td><td>0.03</td><td>(0.02)</td><td>0.01*</td><td>(0.01)</td><td>0.01** (0.00)</td><td>0.01**</td><td>(0.00) 0.00**</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>Per Capita Income(3)</td><td>-0.08** (0.03)</td><td>-0.06</td><td>(0.04)</td><td>-0.19**</td><td>(0.03) -0.07</td><td>(0.04)</td><td>-0.19**</td><td>(0.03)</td><td>0.04**</td><td>(0.01)</td><td>0.03** (0.00)</td><td>0.02**</td><td>(0.00) 0.02**</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>Inflation (24)</td><td>0.04** (0.02)</td><td>0.04**</td><td>(0.01)</td><td>0.01</td><td>(0.01)</td><td>0.04** (0.01)</td><td>0.01</td><td>(0.01)</td><td>-0.00</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>0.00** (0.00)</td><td>0.00**</td><td>(0.00) 0.00**</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>Common Law (s)</td><td>-0.05 (0.11)</td><td>-0.06</td><td>(0.11)</td><td>0.63*</td><td>(0.28) -0.10</td><td>(0.11)</td><td>0.60**</td><td>(0.26)</td><td>-0.02</td><td>(0.04) -0.10**</td><td>(0.03)</td><td>-0.08** (0.02)</td><td>0.08**</td><td>(0.03)</td></tr><tr><td>Rule of Law (6)</td><td>0.18 (0.13)</td><td>0.14</td><td>(0.14)</td><td>0.67**</td><td>(0.18)</td><td>0.23 (0.13)</td><td>0.67**</td><td>(0.17)</td><td>0.21**</td><td>(0.04)</td><td>0.17** (0.02)</td><td>0.17**</td><td>(0.02) 0.13**</td><td>(0.02)</td></tr><tr><td>Political Rights (Lack of)(27)</td><td>-0.10* (0.05)</td><td>-0.10*</td><td>(0.05)</td><td>0.02</td><td>(0.06) -0.08</td><td>(0.05)</td><td>0.01</td><td>(0.05)</td><td>0.04**</td><td>(0.01)</td><td>0.01 (0.01)</td><td>0.00</td><td>(0.01) 0.00</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>FDI Inflow(8)</td><td>0.10** (0.02)</td><td>0.09**</td><td>(0.02)</td><td>0.07**</td><td>(0.02)</td><td>0.09** (0.02)</td><td>0.07**</td><td>(0.01)</td><td>0.00</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>0.00** (0.00)</td><td>0.00**</td><td>(0.00) -0.00**</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>StateShare of Economy(g)</td><td>0.07** (0.01)</td><td>0.07**</td><td>(0.02)</td><td>0.04**</td><td>(0.01) 0.10**</td><td>(0.02)</td><td>0.05**</td><td>(0.02)</td><td>-0.01</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>0.00 (0.00)</td><td>0.01*</td><td>(0.00) 0.01**</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>Remittances(β1)</td><td></td><td>-0.30</td><td>(0.27)</td><td>0.32 (0.30)</td><td>4.39**</td><td>(1.68)</td><td>2.66</td><td>(1.65)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.51** (0.05)</td><td>0.32**</td><td>(0.07)</td></tr><tr><td>SSE×Remittances(β2)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>-0.31**</td><td>(0.11)</td><td>-0.15</td><td>(0.10)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Years (1-s) and Regions (1-5)</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td></td><td>Yes</td><td></td><td>No</td><td>Yes 209</td><td></td><td>No</td><td></td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td></td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>N Wald x² (Adj.

El refersto Economic Internationalization as the dependent variable. Regression results for region and year dummies are available on request.  \n\nResults in columns 4-5 indicate support for both expectations, consistent with Hypothesis 2.

The new interaction term（ $\\mathit{S S E}\\times R$ emittances) $(-0.31)$ enters negatively also at the $1\\%$ levelof statistical significance. After including year and region dummies in column 5, the signs on Remittances (2.66) and the interaction term, $S S E\\times R$ emittances $(-0.23)$ ， remain as predicted, although statistical significance levels have dropped.  \n\nI confirm these results with an alternative analytical approach proposed by Zelner (2009). He and others (e.g., Vaaler, 2008) note that interaction terms can yield less informative estimates when derived from nonlinear models such as NBR. An alternative approach investigates the moderator effects based on simulation methods developed by King, Tomz, and Wittenberg (2000). Their Clarify Version 2.1 software, an add-on to Stata, permits Monte Carlo simulation of remittance impact on new business start-up counts, given different percentages of state involvement in the economy. I run 1ooo NBR-based simulations, and then set variables at their mean values and the Common Law dummy variable at its modal value, except for Remittances,State Share of the Economy and $S S E\\times I$ Remittances terms. I increase Remittances by one standard deviation, and then graph expected changes in new business counts, given increasing levels of State Share of the Economy.  \n\nResults are presented in Figure 3 using Zelner's (2009) “intgph\" software, also an add-on to Stata. The trend line plots expected change in annual new business counts in response to a one standard deviation increase in Remittances as State Share of the Economy increases from $5\\%$ to $23\\%$ . Upper and lower bands are placed around that trend line, based on a $10\\%$ level of statistical significance. The trend line and non-negative lower bound of the confidence interval in Figure 3 confirm NBR-based trends indicated in columns 4-5 of Table 4. At one standard deviation lower than the sample mean of 13.37 for State Share of Economy (9.05) I expect new business starts to increase by almost 5oo0 annually, given a one standard deviation increase in Remittances. At the sample mean for State Share of Economy (13.37） the expected increase is about 2000 annually. At one standard deviation higher than that sample mean (17.69) there is no longer any expectation of increased new business starts. Such a contrast in simulated new business founding effects  again   indicates conditional  support  for Hypothesis 2.12  \n\n![](images/19901174e18b1adc237d8d0980b7900790296ab5065f31b857bb6f646376b3ef.jpg)  \nFigure 3Simulationresults given one standard deviation increase in remittances, 2002-2007.  \n\nColumns 6-9 of Table 4 present results for Economic Internationalization as the dependent variable.13 OLS results in column 6 again indicate some explanation provided by the nine Controls (adj. $R^{2}{=}0.27)$ , with seven terms showing the expected sign - recall that economic size is expected to be negative, as larger countries have less need for trade openness - and five terms with expected signs at the $10\\%$ $5\\%$ Or $1\\%$ levels of statistical significance. When I shift to panel GLS estimation in column 7 there are five of nine Controls with the expected sign, all statistically significant at the $1\\%$ level. I then add Remittances, which enters in column 8 (0.51) and column 9 (0.32) with the expected positive sign at the $1\\%$ level of statistical significance, consistent with Hypothesis 3.  \n\nRecall that Economic Internationalization is measured as the sum of a country's annual exports and imports divided by GDP. A sample mean for Economic Internationalization of 0.81 implies that imports and exports sum to about $81\\%$ of a developing country's GDP. Based on results in column 8, a one standard deviation increase (0.18) in Remittances increases that sample mean by 9.18 percentage points ( $100\\%\\times$ $[(0.28\\times0.51)$ $(0.10\\times0.51)]{=}9.18\\%)$ .In column 4, the same increase implies a 5.76 percentage point increase in trade  openness $(100\\%\\times[(0.28\\times0.32)-$ $(0.10\\times0.32)]{=}5.76\\%)$ . Immigrant remittances are linked not only to venture funding and founding, but also to broader trends opening their developing economies to the world.  \n\n#### Robustness Analyses of Direct Effects (Hypotheses 1-3)  \n\nTwo follow-up analyses assess the robustness of results related to Hypotheses 1 and 3, and address concerns of possible model misidentification. To be specific, it may be that remittances are not so much a driver as an effect of a venture investment environment back home that has benefitted from other factors, such as domestic wealth or FDI. Various methodological strategies address the possibility of reverse causation: think, for example, of the righthand-side Controls averaged with both contemporaneous and lagged values. Yet it is difficult to dismiss the possibility of reverse causation based on these strategies alone.  \n\nThus, as further assurance that the model is properly identified, I first re-estimate Eq. (1) using a GMM dynamic panel estimator (Arellano & Bover, 1995; Blundell & Bond, 1998). As a linear estimator, I can use it for three of the four venture investment environment indicators related to Hypotheses 1 and 3: General Capital Access, Venture Capital Access and Economic Internationalization. This dynamic panel estimator is particularly well suited to my panel data with broad cross-section (45-61 countries) but relatively short time-series (2002-2007). I continue to treat the Common Law dummy as well as the year (Years) and region (Regions) dummies as exogenous, but treat other righthand-side terms as endogenously determined. The estimator adds to Eq. (1) a lagged dependent variable $(Y_{i j t-1})$ that acts as a \"catch-all\" control for past effects of whatever venture investment indicator I am analyzing. This new control is particularly relevant for estimations of Venture Capital Access that may be yielding anomalous results due to model under-specification. The estimator generates plausibly exogenous instruments in the form of additional lags in levels and in differences in levels for both the lagged dependent variable and Controls treated as endogenously determined.  \n\nResults from such estimations are presented in columns 1-3 of Table 5.14 Sargan tests do not reject the null hypothesis that the generated instruments are exogenous as a group. Arellano-Bond tests do not reject the null hypothesis of no second-order autocorrelation in first-differenced errors. These diagnostics suggest sensible estimates of all relevant right-hand-side equation terms. Estimates for Remittances are uniformly positive and significant at commonly accepted levels, consistent with Hypotheses 1 and 3. These results are especially relevant for confirming the positive and significant impact of immigrant remittances on more narrowly defined venture capital availability. Substantial coefficients for Remittances with Venture Capital Access in column 2 (2.80) and General Capital Access in column 1 (1.23) suggest that earlier panel GLS estimates may be conservative.  \n\nAnother approach to dealing with possible reverse causation takes advantage of properties in a subsample of countries I analyze. In columns 4-7 of Table 5 1 implement panel GLS and NBR estimations with a subsample comprising lessdeveloped countries with lower per capita income $(<\\$1500)$ ,less inward FDI $(<\\$1.5$ billion), no extraordinarily high levels of per capita remittances $(<\\$9200)$ , and below average Rule of Law $(<0.00)$ .15 Such subsampling criteria yield a list of countries with substantial representation from Africa. For these less-developed countries it is less likely that factors other than immigrant remittances are substantially shaping the venture investment environment.  \n\nSubsample size decreases substantially, thus Eq. (1) cannot be estimated with year and region dummies.In columns 4-7，estimates for Remittances affecting General Capital Access (6.11), Venture Capital Access (16.30), New Business Creation (20.45） and Economic Internationalization (2.73) again exhibit positive signs statistically significant at the $5\\%$ Or $1\\%$ levels, consistent with Hypotheses 1-3. Indeed, the estimates increase by five to ten times full-sample estimates in Tables 3-4. When, for example, Remittances is set at the subsample mean (o.o4) for the 24 countries analyzed in column 5, the index score for Venture Capital Access jumps from the subsample mean of 1.53 to 2.35 $(1.53~+~(0.04\\times20.45){=}2.35)$ 0. This increase raises a country's rank about eight levels in this group.  \n\nTableReresionanalysesof remittances andventure investment envirnment indicators withdynamic paelestimator (colums 3 andlesdeveloped country ubale (columns 4-7), 2002-2007a   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variables</td><td colspan=\"10\">Estimators</td><td colspan=\"3\"></td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"10\"></td><td colspan=\"3\"></td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">(1)</td><td colspan=\"2\">(2)</td><td colspan=\"2\">(3)</td><td colspan=\"2\">(4)</td><td colspan=\"2\">(5)</td><td colspan=\"2\">(6)</td><td colspan=\"2\">(2)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">DPDSYS, GCA</td><td colspan=\"2\">DPDSYS, VCA</td><td colspan=\"2\">DPDSYS, EI</td><td colspan=\"2\">FGLS, GCA</td><td colspan=\"2\">FGLS, VCA</td><td colspan=\"2\">NBR, NBC</td><td colspan=\"2\">FGLS, EI</td></tr><tr><td>Constant (α)</td><td>0.01</td><td>(1.07)</td><td>-9.30**</td><td>(2.08)</td><td>0.02</td><td>(0.24)</td><td>0.96</td><td>(1.40)</td><td>-14.88**</td><td>(1.90)</td><td>-12.74</td><td>(4.27)</td><td></td><td>(0.52)</td></tr><tr><td>EconomicSize (2)</td><td>0.08*</td><td>(0.05)</td><td>0.36**</td><td>(0.09)</td><td>-0.00</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>0.20**</td><td>(0.06)</td><td>0.73**</td><td>(0.09)</td><td>0.81**</td><td>(0.21)</td><td>1.70** -0.04*</td><td>(0.02)</td></tr><tr><td>Economic Growth (22)</td><td>0.00</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>0.07**</td><td>(0.02)</td><td>-0.00</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>-0.01</td><td>(0.01)</td><td>-0.06**</td><td>(0.02)</td><td>0.10</td><td>(0.06)</td><td>0.01**</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>Per CapitaIncome(3)</td><td>0.08**</td><td>(0.02)</td><td>0.25**</td><td>(0.08)</td><td>0.01**</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>-0.13</td><td>(0.19)</td><td>-0.85</td><td>(0.36)</td><td>0.34</td><td>(1.69)</td><td>-0.13</td><td>(0.86)</td></tr><tr><td>Inflation (4)</td><td>-0.00</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>0.01t</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>-0.00**</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>-0.01**</td><td>(0.01)</td><td>0.00</td><td>(0.01)</td><td>-0.00</td><td>(0.01)</td><td>0.01**</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>Common Law (2s)</td><td>0.89**</td><td>(0.18)</td><td>-1.22</td><td>(0.82)</td><td>0.08**</td><td>(0.02)</td><td>0.19</td><td>(0.14)</td><td>-0.83**</td><td>(0.18)</td><td>0.23</td><td>(0.49)</td><td>-0.19**</td><td>(0.04)</td></tr><tr><td>Rule of Law (26)</td><td>0.64**</td><td>(0.22)</td><td>-0.02</td><td>(0.28)</td><td>-0.01</td><td>(0.03)</td><td>0.24t</td><td>(0.13)</td><td>0.18</td><td>(0.18)</td><td>3.13**</td><td>(0.47)</td><td>0.06</td><td>(0.05)</td></tr><tr><td>Political Rights (Lack of) (7)</td><td>0.01</td><td>(0.05)</td><td>0.07</td><td>(0.12)</td><td>0.01</td><td>(0.01)</td><td>-0.06</td><td>(0.04)</td><td>-0.09t</td><td>(0.05)</td><td>-0.08</td><td>(0.13)</td><td>-0.03**</td><td>(0.01)</td></tr><tr><td>FDI Inflow (g)</td><td>0.01**</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>-0.03**</td><td>(0.01)</td><td>-0.00**</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>0.03</td><td>(0.06)</td><td>-0.77**</td><td>(0.18)</td><td>0.70**</td><td>(0.18)</td><td>0.01</td><td>(0.03)</td></tr><tr><td>State Share of Economy (g)</td><td>-0.02**</td><td>(0.01)</td><td>0.11**</td><td>(0.03)</td><td>0.01**</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>0.02</td><td>(0.01)</td><td>0.07**</td><td>(0.03)</td><td>0.31**</td><td>(0.05)</td><td>0.01**</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>Remittances (β1)</td><td>1.23*</td><td>(0.51)</td><td>2.80**</td><td>(0.72)</td><td>0.34**</td><td>(0.08)</td><td>6.11**</td><td>(1.63)</td><td>16.30**</td><td>(3.27)</td><td>20.45*</td><td>(9.79)</td><td>2.73**</td><td>(0.51)</td></tr><tr><td>SSE× Remittances(β2)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>-1.79**</td><td>(0.75)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>One-Year Lagged DV (Yijt-1)</td><td colspan=\"2\">0.43**</td><td colspan=\"2\">0.16** (0.09)</td><td colspan=\"2\">0.74** (0.04)</td><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\"></td></tr><tr><td>Years (1-5) and Regions (1-5)</td><td colspan=\"2\">Yes</td><td colspan=\"2\">Yes</td><td colspan=\"2\">Yes</td><td colspan=\"2\">No</td><td colspan=\"2\">No</td><td colspan=\"2\">No</td><td colspan=\"2\">No</td></tr><tr><td>N Wald x2 (Adj.

Recall that this  subsample  comprises countries  with  official business registries that almost certainly undercount the actual number of new business starts. Thus even an estimate of this magnitude still understates the actual impact of immigrant money and ideas on rates of new business creation. Along with results in columns 4-5, these column 6 results suggest that immigrant remittances may have an even more pronounced positive impact on the venture investmentenvironmentof some of theleast developed countries. And results across Table 5 add confidence to a critical framework assumption that immigrant remittances are  causing rather than reflecting enhancement of the venture investment environment.  \n\n#### Multivariate Regression Results: Moderator Effects (Hypotheses 4-5)  \n\nResults from multivariate regression analyses of moderator effects related to Hypotheses 4-5 are presented in Table 6. Columns 1-4 of Table 6 presents results from estimating the impact of Remittances on different indicators of the venture investment environment after inclusion of individual and interaction terms related to immigrant skill level. Consistent with Hypothesis 4 and recent research findings in this journal (Madhaven & Iriyama, 2009), 1 expect the $I S\\times R$ emittancesinteraction term to enter positively, thus indicating that remittances from better-educated immigrants have a stronger positive impact on the venture investment environment back home. $I S\\times R$ emittances does not enter at commonly accepted levels of statistical significance for New Business Creation and Economic Internationalization in columns 3-4.16 Consistent with Hypothesis 1, however, I find that $I S\\times I$ Remittances is positive and statistically significant  at the $1\\%$ level for General Capital Access column 1 (1.34). Highly educated immigrants remit money and ideas that have a more positive impact on general home-country capital availability.  \n\nTo understand the practical impact of this result, I simulate the net effects of remittances from immigrant communities that are and are not highly educated. I set Remittances at its sample mean (0.10) and then multiply it by its coefficient in column 1 $(-0.76)$ $(-0.76\\times0.10{=}-0.08)$ . When $I S\\times R$ emittancesissetto $0\\:\\:-\\:$ immigrants from country $i$ and region $j$ are not highly educated - the net effect is a slightly lower index score and a decrease of approximately one rank. If the immigrants are highly educated then I add the $I S\\times R$ emittancescoefficient $(-0.08+1.34{=}1.26$ ) and change the net effect from a slight decrease to substantial increase of 25 ranks.  \n\nFor Venture Capital Access in column 2 the individual and interaction terms yield just the opposite set of effects, contrary to Hypothesis 4. Remittances exhibits a positive sign, implying slightly enhanced venture  capital availability in immigrants' home countries. But the interaction term, $I S\\times R$ emittances, enters negatively $(-2.76)$ at commonly  accepted  levels of  statistical  significance. For countries with highly educated immigrants, the net effects turn sharply negative $(0.06{-}2.76{=}{-}2.70)$ 0. The decrease in index score implies a drop of 35 ranks. These results not only contradict Hypothesis 4 but also challenge the notion that transnational technical communities (Madhaven & Iriyama, 2009) or other educated elites enjoy broad-based advantages in transferring money and ideas home for entrepreneurial purposes. Alternative cross-country connections based on clan or community may matter more.  \n\nColumns 5-8 of Table 6 present results related to one such community attribute, the concentration of that community across various host countries. Hypothesis 5 predicts a positive sign on the interaction term, $I C\\times R$ emittances. More concentrated immigrant communities are more likely to create institutions and conventions to decrease transaction costs and increase knowledge associated with cross-country transfers of venture funds and ideas back home. Results related to that prediction are mixed. The interaction term is not statistically significant at commonly accepted levels for General Capital Access in column 1 but, in line with Hypothesis 5, $I C\\times I$ Remittances is positive, statistically  significant  and practically  substantial  for Venture Capital Access in column 2 (2.75). Individually, Remittances enters without statistical significance at commonly accepted levels. This suggests that immigrants scattered about the globe are also remitters less able or willing to risk sending venture capital back home. But when that community is highly concentrated, Venture Capital Access index increases by 2.75, which takes a country at the bottom of the index to the mid-range and a midrange country to the top ranks.  \n\nTable 6Regression analysesof remitances and venture investment environment indicators with immigrant sillmoderator columns 14) and mmigrant concentraton moderator (columns 5-8), 2002-2007a

The net effects of Remittances and $I C\\times.$ RemittancesforEconomicInternationalizationin column 8 are more intuitively grasped than more complex simulation required for New Business Creation in column 7.17 in column 8, a positively signed and statistically significant Remittances term alone (0.45) captures net effects for countries with immigrant communities that are not highly concentrated. With Remittances set at its sample mean, the coefficient implies increased trade openness of  4.5  percentage  points $(100\\%\\times(0.10\\times0.45)=$ $4.50\\%)$ . In a highly concentrated immigrant community, however, the net effect is reversed from modest gain to sharp drop in trade openness of 48.5 percentage points $(100\\%\\times[(0.10\\times0.45)-0.53]=$ $-48.5\\%)$ . Geographic concentration of immigrant communities apparently  increases  the positive impact of their remittances for venture funding only, begging questions about why the same community attribute does not magnify the positive impact of remittances on venture founding and growth through internationalization. Answers to these questions are beyond the scope of this particular study, but they suggest the need for more refined theorizing about how and why immigrant remittances shape the home-country venture investment environment.  \n\n## DISCUSSION  \n\n### Key Results and Implications  \n\nIf the basic questions motivating this study are whether and how remittances from developingcountry immigrants might alter the home-country venture investment environment, then the results above suggest some novel, theoretically grounded and empirically supported answers. Perhaps most importantly, my results suggest that immigrants and their remittances enhance the development of vital entrepreneurial building blocks in immigrants' home countries. Remittances are directly associated with enhanced availability of capital to invest in new businesses, with enhanced rates of new business start-ups (unless crowded out by the state), and with enhanced internationalization of the broader economy. Far from remittances serving merely as subsistence assistance to desperately poor, sick and/ or uneducated family and friends, I find evidence that they serve as a critical source of money and ideas for developing-country entrepreneurs. If this is true, then developing-country immigrants also play roles as transnational venture investors, firm founders and agents of business expansion in a context where other players are reluctant to act.  \n\nThese core findings have important implications for IB and entrepreneurship research (Guler & Guillén, 2010; Madhaven & Iriyama, 2009) that has recently reminded us that venture capital money and ideas flow more easily overseas when recipient countries cultivate stronger property rights protections and more stable investment policies, and when educated immigrant networks connect donor and recipient countries. This view complements other IB and entrepreneurship research (Ahlstrom & Bruton, 2006; Bruton, Ahlstrom, & Obloj, 2008; Wright, Westhead, & Ucbasarana, 2007; Zahra, 2005) noting that a dearth of new venture financing and know-how undermines business development, economic growth and broader institutional modernization of many developing countries. Indeed, these countries face a “Catch $22^{\\prime\\prime}$ problem, where institutional shortcomings deter standard (to IB and entrepreneurship research) venture investment flows, which are, in turn, vital to upgrading institutions necessary for faster economic growth.  \n\nThe theoretical framework and empirical results presented here suggest a way to deal with this Catch 22 problem. TCE and social knowledge theories suggest that developing-country immigrants are well positioned to risk the transfer of money and ideas, given informal ties related to shared clan and community membership. The lack of advanced education or technical training does not appear to undermine this positioning for venture funding purposes. Indeed, greater concentration of immigrants abroad may very well strengthen that positioning. Immigrants and their remittances can play important roles in early-stage venture funding in less-developed countries with scarce capital.  \n\nAlong with the framework and these basic findings, 1 highlight the research contribution of this study's scope. I examine support for aspects of my theoretical framework across several countries and years. Most previous studies on immigrant remittances and entrepreneurship have focused on a single country. My study broadens that scope using novel panel data analytics, thus permitting closer control of specific country and time effects, and thus permitting broader inference from results.  \n\nMy study also contributes to research in economic development and public policy. While understanding the impact of immigrant remittances on home-country venture investing may be a new line of inquiry for IB and entrepreneurship scholars, investigation of immigrant remittances and their impact on economic development is not new elsewhere in the Academy. Brown (2006) surveys evidence both consistent with and contrary to the proposition that remittances contribute positively to economic development.He concludes that remittances do contribute positively when recipient countries have in place other prudent macroeconomic policies designed to prevent  local currency over-appreciation and promote easier financial transfers and communication. In this broader research context, my theoretical framework and empirical findings detail a likely path by which remittances lead to such positive development outcomes. The path is circular. Money and ideas from immigrants abroad find their way home for use in new business development that then often reaches back overseas. It is part of a transnational entrepreneurship (Drori et al., 2009; Portes et al., 2002) process apparently affecting immigrants of varied backgrounds.  \n\nFinally, findings reported here have practical implications for entrepreneurs in developing countries searching for appropriate partners to fund, found and grow new ventures. These entrepreneurs can look abroad for investors with the same passport and home town, as well as a similar ethnic and family background. They represent a growing source of “smart\" money ready to flow back home with less concern about possible misuse. Governments seeking to promote more entrepreneurial activities at home will likely benefit from developing the capacity to engage immigrant communities abroad. As Gamlen (2008) and others (World Bank, 2006) have pointed out, strategic investments in engagement capacity such as consular facilities and services might help increasingly large, wealthy and investment-oriented immigrant communities re-connect with their home countries.  \n\n### Limitations and Future Research  \n\nThis study has strengths, but also limitations. Theoretically, it provides substantial grounding in TCE and social knowledge perspectives, but this grounding could benefit from closer integration with existing concepts and theories explaining why entrepreneurs go abroad to fund, found and expand new ventures in their home countries. I see value in closer integration of my research with transnational entrepreneurship concepts (Drori et al.,  \n\n2009; Portes et al., 2002). Perhaps the conceptual and then empirical challenge here will be to articulate and then operationalize different classes of transnational entrepreneurs based on differing levels of wealth, education and home-country connection to specific clans and communities. Certain theories show promise for this closer integration. Zahra (2005) highlights the importance of networks for understanding why certain new international ventures succeed and others fail. The success of remittance-based ventures in an immigrant's home country may be explained similarly. Perhaps future research should articulate a “remittance network\" theory of informal entrepreneurship. That theory could map the path of money and ideas, the frequency with which they pass through certain individuals and institutions in host and home countries, and then their effectiveness in funding and founding new ventures in an immigrant's home country.  \n\nI analyzed associations between immigrant remittances and different indicators of the home-country venture investment environment for 61 developing countries from 2002 to 2007. Yet it is a single study awaiting confirmation or disconfirmation by others in the future. I chose not to sample prior to 2001. That was driven in part by the expectation of better-quality data with less measurement error in more recent (post-2ooo) years. As such data increase in the future, researchers will also have more estimation power. This advantage may be particularly helpful with dynamic panel estimations, where short time-series with high inter-temporal correlations maylead to underestimates of standard errors. Future researchers will also have other opportunities to improve on estimation strategies I used. One way I addressed the possibility of reverse causality between remittances and venture investing outcomes was to use dynamic panel estimation generating plausibly exogenous instruments based on lagged values of different variables (Arellano & Bover, 1995; Blundell & Bond, 1998). While diagnostic (Sargan) tests do not reject the presumption of instrument exogeneity as a whole, I cannot conclude that these instruments are the best available. Future work should search for alternative instrument sets correlated with remittances but not the venture-investing outcomes that I propose remittances affect.  \n\nI analyzed differences in the venture investment impact of remittances linked to individual and collective characteristics of immigrants. These analyses could start a broader research project aimed at understanding individual, group and broader institutional factors in the home and host countries of immigrants. The impact of remittances on the venture investment environment might be enhanced when developing countries invest more resources in immigrant community engagement policies: passing dual citizenship laws; liberalizing expatriate investment regulations; building and staffing more consulates abroad. Remittances could also have a greater impact as the prevalence of financial institutions important to remittance payout increases in home countries. This second conjecture might seem trivial, since Guler and Guillén (2010) have already recorded that venture investment business activity decreases in countries with poor financial infrastructure. As I noted earlier, however, remittance-based venture investment is almost certainly less sensitive to poor institutional development. A rather low threshold of home-country bank access may permit remittances to be paid out in quantities sufficient to enhance venture investment activities substantially.  \n\nFuture research can look more closely at broader patterns revealed in my study. Remittances can be disaggregated into components related to resident workers' remittances, compensation of nonresident employees and migrant asset transfers. Established residents overseas may be in a better position to generate capital to fund new ventures back home, whereas more transient non-residents may be better positioned to transfer venture ideas to the home country for implementation as business start-ups. This conjecture suggests that the workers′ remittances component of overall remittances may have a greater impact on home-country venture funding availability. The remittance component related to compensation of non-resident employees may have greater impact on homecountry new business starts. Future research might also disaggregate the types of venture capital derived from remittances. For example, I see value in understanding how remittances affect the availability of debt vs equity to fund new businesses in developing countries. Such follow-on research would complement public policy efforts to understand how remittances affect access to finance more generally (Beck & Demirgic-Kunt, 2008; Desai, Kapur, & McHale, 2004).  \n\nOther limitations relate to the equation specification, which assumes that remittances have only direct individual and indirect moderator effects on various indicators of the home-country venture investment environment. It may be that the effects of  remittances  on  developing-country  venture investing are not so much moderated as they are mediated by other factors. Inward FDI is a likely candidate for such mediation, particularly in more developed  emerging-market  countries  with  burgeoning investment inflows.  \n\nLater studies might develop and test other aspects of the theoretical framework proposed here. This study documented remittance trends consistent with attributes of developing-country immigrants assumed but not yet documented in broad sample studies. Future research should analyze directly immigrant attitudes toward risk and investment back home. Such research will benefit from taking an organizational behavior perspective on individual immigrant attributes, as well as from entrepreneurship scholars taking a larger organizational theory perspective on immigrant networks. These and other avenues of future research should provide further insight into the growing role of developingcountry immigrants as venture investors.  \n\n# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  \n\nThis paper benefited from seminar presentations at the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management and Humphrey Institute for Public Affairs, Texas A&M's Mays Business School, Simon Fraser University's School of Management, Universidad Pablo Olavide's Departemento de Direccion Empresas, the University of Bath's School of Management, the European Business School, and the University of Warwick Business School.

The first and usually largest component, workers' remittances, is current private transfers from migrant workers considered residents of the host country to recipients in their country of origin. If migrants live in the host country for a year or longer, they are considered residents, regardless of their immigration status. If migrants have lived in the host country for less than a year (and are not students, diplomats, military personnel, medical patients, tourists, etc.) their income becomes part of a second and usually smaller component, compensation of employees. The third component is also usually the smallest: migrant transfers are offset entries in the balance of payments to the provision of a resource such as grants and gifts in kind or financial form. For more on remittance accounting and compilation methods and issues, see IMF (2009), Nyberg-Sorenson (2004), Reinke (2007) and World Bank (2006).  \n\nZMeasuring the flow of social remittances to developing countries  is  more  difficult than measuring financial remittances, which organizations such as the World Bank have been measuring across countries since the late 1990s. For the purposes of this study I assume that socialand financial remittances flow together, and often use the term \"remittances\" to refer to both flows. In measurement for empirical study, we use financial remittances to proxy for social remittances as well.  \n\n3For example, survey evidence reported by Amuedo-Dorantes, Bansak, and Pozo (2004) indicates that Mexican immigrants in the US use the largest share of remittances  to  defray  health  expenses $(46.18\\%)$ followed by expenses for food and maintenance $(29.79\\%)$ , home construction and repair $(7.47\\%)_{\\cdot}$ debt repayment $(5.42\\%)$ , and consumer purchases $(4.46\\%)$ . According to their survey, less than half a penny of every  remittance dollar $(0.46\\%)$ goesto starting or expanding a business.  \n\n4Despite the prominence given to remittances from developed countries, so-called \"South-South\" financial remittances make up  from $30\\%$ to $45\\%$ of total financial remittances received by developing countries in the mid-2000s. The growing importance of South-South remittances reflects the fact that over half of migrants from developing countries now migrate to other developing countries (World Bank, 2006: xi).  \n\n?World Bank data indicate a steady rise in recorded remittances worldwide, from  approximately $\\$25$ billion in 1990 to nearly $\\$100$ billion in 2000. That figure approximately tripled to $\\$300$ billion by 2007. Recorded remittances flowing through standard commercial conduits capture from $50\\%$ to $60\\%$ of total (recorded and unrecorded) remittance estimates since the 2000s (Moneygram, 2010). For more on efforts to improve remittance accounting and compiling, see IMF (2009), Nyberg-Sorenson (2004), Reinke (2007) and World Bank (2006).  \n\n6Aggarwal et al. (2010) have recorded that remittances promote similar trends in banking system depth and breadth for Mexico and 106 other developing countries observed from 1975 to 2007.  \n\n7Fafchamps (2001) explains contracting patterns in  sub-Saharan African  countries without effective third-party (court) enforcement similarly.  In these settings, informal relationships based on common clan or community membership can signal reliability as a trading partner. If the costs of cheating are high enough, then contracts are self-enforcing. Relationships serve as their own surety of contractual performance.  \n\n8These 61 _ countries are  Argentina, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Cambodia, Cameroon, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Jordan, Kenya, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Macedonia, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali, Mexico, Moldova, Mongolia, Morocco, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Romania, Russia, Senegal, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine, Venezuela, Vietnam and Yemen.  \n\n\"See Docquier and Marfouk (2006) for details of their data collection and compilation methods. Six non-OECD countries included in their analyses of census and registration data are the Czech Republic, Hungary, Mexico, Poland, Slovakia and South Korea. In my sample, developing countries more vulnerable to underestimation of immigrant skill level, given more pronounced South-South migration patterns, include Bangladesh, Botswana, Egypt, Jordan, Namibia, Pakistan and Yemen. Results including Immigrant Skill terms in Eq. (1) (Table 6) are robust to exclusion of these countries. Results excluding these countries are available from the author.  \n\n10All 61 countries are sampled and analyzed in columns 1-4 (General Capital Access) of Table 3. Two of these 61 countries, Togo and Yemen, are dropped from the sample analyzed in columns 5-6 (Venture Capital Access) of Table 3.  \n\n1'The  45 countries sampled and analyzed  in columns 1-5 of Table 4 are Argentina, Armenia,  \n\nBangladesh, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Ghana, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Jordan, Kenya, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Mexico, Moldova, Morocco, Nicaragua, Oman, Pakistan, Philippines, Romania, Russia, Senegal, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine and Yemen.  \n\n$^{12}\\mathsf{A}$ related slope test available in Zelner's (2009) intgph  program  confirms  contrasts illustrated  in Figure 3. Using his slope test, I confirm that the changes in new business counts one standard deviation below and above the sample mean for State Share of the Economy are significantly different at the $1\\%$ level. This result is available from the author.  \n\n13The 59 countries sampled and analyzed in columns 1-4(Economic Internationalization)of Table 5 are Argentina, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Cambodia, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Jordan, Kenya, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Macedonia, Madagascar, Malaysia, Mali, Mexico, Moldova, Mongolia, Morocco, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Romania, Russia, Senegal, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine, Venezuela, Vietnam and Yemen.  \n\n14The  61  countrie  sampled  and  analyzed  in columns 1 and 3 (General Capital Access and Economic Internationalization) of Table 5 are the sameas previously analyzed in Tables 3 and 4. The 59 countries sampled and analyzed in column 2 (Venture Capital Access) of Table 5 are the same as previously analyzed in Table 3.  \n\n15The 29 countries sampled and analyzed in columns 4 and 7 (General Capital Access and Economic Internationalization) of Table 5 are Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Cambodia, Cameroon, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Haiti, Honduras, Indonesia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Moldova, Mongolia, Moldova, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Paraguay, Philippines, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Ukraine and Yemen. The 24 countries sampled and analyzed in column 5 (Venture Capital Access) of Table 5 are Bangladesh, Bolivia, Cambodia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Haiti, Honduras, Indonesia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Moldova, Mongolia, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Philippines, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Uganda and Ukraine. The 15 countries sampled and analyzed in column 6 (New Business Creation) of Table 5 are Armenia, Bangladesh, Ghana, Haiti, Indonesia, Kenya, Madagascar, Moldova, Pakistan, Philippines, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, Ukraine and Yemen.  \n\n16Results from simulation of different two-way interactions based on Zelner's (2009) intgph program confirm trends implied by the insignificant coefficient sign  for $I{\\mathsf{S}}\\times R$ emittances presented in column 3 of Table 6: increasing immigrant skill does not significantly  increase new business creation  effect  of remittances as Hypothesis 4 holds. These simulation results are available from the author.  \n\n17Results from simulation of different two-way interactions based on Zelner's (2009) intgph program confirm trends implied by the significant $(p<0.01)$ coefficient  sign   for $I C\\times$ Remittances presented in column 7 of Table 6: increasing geographic concentration of immigrants abroad decreases (not increases as Hypothesis 5 holds) the new business creation impact of remittances.
