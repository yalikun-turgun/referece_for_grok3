This was borne out in their empirical work. In this paper, we examine how the difference in wage losses across plant closing and layoff varies with race and gender. We find that the basic prediction by Gibbons and Katz only holds for white males. We augment their asymmetric information model with heterogeneous human capital and show that this augmented model can match the data.  \n\n# 1 Introduction  \n\nThe role of asymmetric information in labor market outcomes has long been of interest to labor economists (e.g. Akerlof, 1976, Spence, 1973, Greenwald, 1986, and Laing, 1994). Empirical studies on this topic, however, have been scarce. In a seminal paper, Gibbons and Katz (1991; hereafter GK) construct a model of asymmetric information in the labor market. They use their model to argue that if firms have discretion as to which workers to lay off, a layoff provides a signal to the outside market that a worker is of low quality. By contrast, virtually all workers lose their jobs when their plant closes so job loss from plant closing does not provide a negative signal. GK test for asymmetric information by looking at changes in wages for white collar workers.1 Since a layoff provides a negative signal about ability, one would expect wages to fall more following a layoff than for a plant closing. They confirm this prediction in the data showing that wage penalties are substantially higher for layoffs than for plant closings.  \n\nIn this paper, we take advantage of the fact that we have many more years of displaced workers data to expand on GK by looking at how the difference in wage losses across plant closing and layoff varies with race and gender. Statistical discrimination against African Americans or women occurs when employers use race and gender as a predictor for productivity.2 If this is the case, then one would expect the information contained in a layoff to vary across racial and gender groups. Empirically, we find that the differences between white males and the other groups are striking and complex. The basic prediction by GK actually only clearly holds for white males. Both black females and black males actually experience a much greater decline in earnings at plant closings than at layoffs. For white females the losses at plant closing and layoff are very similar. These results arise from two reinforcing effects. First, plant closings have substantially more negative effects on minorities than on whites. Second, layoffs seem to have more negative consequences for white men than for the Other groups.  \n\nDoes this mean that one should discard the GK model? We think clearly not. However, the simple model is not suffcient to explain all of the data, so we augment it. We propose a new model that extends the asymmetric information model of GK by including heterogeneous human capital.? In our model, different types of frms hire different types of workers. Once an employee has worked for a frm for one period, the current firm knows his/her skill level, but outside firms do not. We model layoffs and plant closings as arising when shocks hit firms. Severe shocks lead the firms to cease operation (plant closings) while less severe shocks lead them to reduce the size of their workforce (layoffs). On the one hand, plant closing may be more devastating than layoff because it may be associated with a larger negative shock to the human capital of a particular worker. On the other hand, layoffs send a bad signal to the market and thus have additional negative consequences on the worker. If layof is a substantially stronger signal for white males than for the other groups, this could lead the information hit for layoff to dominate for white males while the human capital aspect to dominate for the other groups.  \n\nWe provide some additional evidence that is suggestive that both asymmetric information and heterogeneous human capital are important. In support of both explanations we demonstrate that the racial and gender effects are surprisingly robust to inclusion of region, industry, and occupation controls. We argue that this would seem unlikely if the explanation were simply that there is variation in the type of jobs performed by different demographic groups. To further look at asymmetric information, we make use of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 which induced employers to lay off “protected\" workers in mass layoffs rather than fire them for cause. As a result, layoff should become a relatively more negative signal for blacks after 1991 than prior. Thus, if asymmetric information is important, one would expect the relative wage losses of blacks following layoffs to increase after 1991 which is precisely what we find (although the standard errors are large).  \n\nOur evidence on the importance of human capital heterogeneity arises from the distinction between two types of layoffs. In the displaced worker survey, an individual can become laid off either because of “position abolished\" or “slack work.\" In the spirit of our model, a “slack work\" layoff can be thought of as arising from a shock to one's firm type (i.e. something like an industry specific shock). By contrast, a “position abolished\" layoff can be thought of as arising from a human capital type specific shock (i.e. something like an occupation specific shock). An individual can avoid the first order effect of the former type of shock by switching sectors, but they can not avoid the first order effect of the latter type shock. Thus if the shocks are of similar magnitude, we would expect a substantially larger fall in earnings from the second type of shock than for the first, and that is precisely what we see in the data. Earnings losses are much larger when layoff is associated with “position abolished\" than when it is associated with “slack work.\" Furthermore, we find that wages losses of plant closings fall in between these two types of layoffs in terms of their magnitude. The distinction between different types of layoffs are, to our best knowledge, new to the literature on displacement and we think they are interesting in their own right.  \n\nFinally, we simulate our model and show that it can match the data. Due to sample size (and precision) considerations, we focus on the differences across gender. We show in our model that if a layoff is a substantially stronger signal for men than for women, this could lead the information hit for layoff to dominate for men while the human capital aspect dominates for women. This allows us to reconcile the result. While we can not formally prove that one needs asymmetric information and heterogeneous human capital to match the moments, we think our model provides the most plausible story.  \n\nA number of other studies have examined the comparison between layoffs and plant closings using data other than the DWS. Using data from the PSID, Stevens (1997) also finds that wage losses following layoffs are larger than those following plant closings. However, she shows that this finding can be explained by the larger wage reductions prior to displacement for plant closings than for layoffs. Her analysis does not condition on race, gender, or blue/white collar so it is difficult to directly compare to our study particularly given that it is not obvious how respondents answer the retrospective question about previous wages in the DWS. Using data from the NLSY, Krashinsky (2002) also finds that workers displaced by layoffs suffer larger wage losses than those displaced by plant closings. However, he provides an alternative explanation attributing the effect to differences in firm size of pre-displacement employers. He argues that small firms are more likely to close down when facing adverse economic shocks, while larger firms are more likely to reduce their workforce. Therefore laid-off workers tend to lose any wage premium or rents they earned from working at large firms. He shows that when firm size is included in the wage loss regression, the difference between layoffs and plant closings becomes statistically insignificant, although the confidence intervals are wide enough to include substantial differences as well. Song (2007) reexamines the GK study and argues that their findings can be partly attributed to differential recall bias for layoffs versus plant closings in the 1984 and 1986 DWS and, in later years, mostly by higher wage-tenure profile prior to displacement for layoffs than for plant closings. We view all of these paper as potentially providing alternative explanations for the main GK finding, however we do not view them as definitively establishing that GK's explanation is incorrect. The main contribution of our paper is in looking at various interactions (among race, gender, white/blue collar and types of dismissals) which these other papers do not do. Therefore we proceed taking the GK explanation of the data, but it is important for the reader to keep these alternatives in mind.  \n\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data. Empirical results are reported in Section 3. We present the model in Section 4, discuss the difference between slack work and position abolished in Section 5, and then use this information in the simulation in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 discusses the results and concludes.  \n\n# 2 Data  \n\nWe use data from the biennial Displaced Workers Surveys (DWSs) Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS) between 1984 and 2008. The DWSs were conducted as part of the January CPSs in 1984, 1986, 1988, 1990, 1992, 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008 and the February CPSs in 1994, 1996, 1998 and 2000. Each of the supplements from 1984-1992 asks workers if they lost a job at any time in the previous 5-year period, and each supplement from 1994-2008 asks this question for the previous 3-year period.4 Displacement is defined as involuntary separation based on operating decisions of the employer such as plant closing, employer going out of business, layoff from which the worker was not recalled. Other events, including quits and being fired for cause, were not considered displacement. Thus, the supplement is designed to focus on the loss of jobs that results from business decisions of firms unrelated to the performance of particular workers. If the response to the job loss question is positive, the respondent is then asked about the reason of job loss: 1) plant closing, 2) slack (insufficient) work, 3) position or shift abolished, 4) seasonal jobs ended, 5) self-employment failed, and  \n\n6) other. The data have information on workers? demographics, tenure on pre-displacement job, occupation, industry and weekly earnings, weeks of joblessness after displacement and current weekly earnings.5  \n\nWe restrict the sample to workers aged 20-64 who lost a job in the private sector in the preceding 3-year period due to plant closing, slack work or position or shift abolished, and are reemployed in the private sector at the survey date. We only focus on workers who made full time to full time job transitions (i.e. lost a full-time job and are re-employed on a fulltime job).6 We exclude workers who have re-employment weekly real earnings under \\$40. Earnings are deflated by the 1982-84=100 consumer price index (CPI). As in Gibbons and Katz, we distinguish between blue and white collar workers. The white collar sample consists of workers who were displaced from jobs as managers and administrators, professional and technical workers, clerical workers, and sales workers while the blue collar sample consists of workers who were displaced from jobs as craft and kindred workers, operatives, laborers, transport operatives, or service workers. We exclude workers in agriculture and construction industries.  \n\nDescriptive statistics of the sample are reported in Table 1. We divide the data into sixteen different groups, classifying by gender, race, blue/white collar, and layoff/plant closing. Sample means and standard deviations for all of the variables are displayed in the cells. In addition, for each group, we also report the $\\mathrm{\\Deltat}$ -statistics for testing the equality of sample means between layoffs and plant closings.  \n\n# 3 Empirical Findings  \n\n## 3.1 Basic Results  \n\nThe main focus of our empirical work is on the wage losses associated with plant closings and layoffs for various demographic groups. To a large extent, our main results can be seen from our summary statistics in the white collar section of Table 1. Note that we have a much longer history of data than Gibbons and Katz who only used 1984-1986. Since we can now extend the data until 2008, our sample size is large enough to condition on specific demographic groups. The key variable is the change in the logarithm of the real wage which is shown in the third row. First, focusing on white males one can see that the main prediction of the Gibbons and Katz model holds up. White men lose approximately $6.5\\%$ of their wages at plant closings, but this rises to around 9.3% at layoffs. This can be interpreted as evidence that asymmetric information is important. However, for the other three demographic groups the evidence is very different. In particular, for African American males and females the contrast is striking with substantially larger wage losses associated with plant closings than with layoffs. For white women wage losses are very similar between plant closing and layoff.? In the rest of Table 1 we present results for blue collar workers, and like Gibbons and Katz, we find that wage losses are similar for plant closing as for layoff. This result holds approximately for all four demographic groups.  \n\nA key question is why the relative losses at plant closing and layoff vary so much across the demographic groups in Table 1. Is it because the losses at plant closing are larger, or is it that the losses at layoffs are smaller? To add control variables and formally test for differences, we set up the model in a regression framework. The main results are presented in Table 2. The key dependent variable is the change in log wages (i.e. log of post-displacement wage minus log of pre-displacement wage). We regress that variable on black and female dummy variables interacted with layof and plant closing. Note that in columns (1)-(4) this specification is not completely free in that we do not interact race with gender so that the gender effect is constrained to be the same for the two different races.8 One can see that the results for white collar workers described above depend on differences at both layoff and plant closing. In particular, blacks experience both smaller wage losses at layoff and larger losses at plant closing than do whites. However, the plant closing effect seems to be the larger of the two and the layoff effect is not statistically significant at conventional levels.  \n\nFor women the story portrayed in Table 2 is quite different. We see only a small difference at plant closing between men and women, particularly after including control variables. However, women experience smaller wage declines following a layoff. In our simulation results below we will explore why this might be true. Estimating the interacted model in column (5) suggests that some additional interactions may exist but the basic results for white men and women remain.  \n\nA particularly striking aspect of the results is the robustness of the results in Table 2 to inclusion of control variables. While parameters change some from column (1) to (2), all of the relevant coefficients change very little between columns (2), (3), and (4). We view it as particularly surprising that region and one digit industry and occupation controls seem to make little difference in the final result. This strongly suggests that the racial and gender patterns we document are not simply due to differences in the sector of the economy or jobs in which workers were employed.  \n\nOne interesting question is whether these results could be explained by Stevens’ (1997) finding that the diference between layoff and plant closing occurs because much of the wage losses accompanying plant closing occur prior to the displacement. For this to explain our findings, one would need that relative to the other groups, white males would experience larger losses at plant closing prior to displacement. This may seem unintuitive as one might expect white males to be more mobile and thus better able to avoid these losses. We do not have a panel of wages prior to displacement so we can not look at this directly. However, our best evidence is to look at wage differences prior to displacement. One can see in Table 1 that for whites, the layof/plant closing gap in pre-displacement wages between men and women is virtually identical.9 Furthermore, we know from Table 2 that the main difference across gender occurs at layoff not at plant closing. For blacks, in Table 1 one can see that black men goes in one direction (that is the pre-displacement gap is larger than for white males while for black women it goes in the other (i.e. smaller than for white males). In Table A1 in the appendix we rerun the specifications in Table 2 but use pre-displacement wages as the dependent variable. No clear evidence in support of this hypothesis arises.  \n\nIn the rest of Table 2 we present results for blue collar workers. The interactions are virtually all smaller in absolute value than those for white collar workers, and none of the interactions are statistically significant at conventional levels. However, note that many of the signs are quite similar. Even though we can not reject that the coeffcients are zero, typically $^{10}$ we can also not reject that they are different than the coefficients for white collar workers.1  \n\nAs mentioned in footnote 1, the reason we follow GK and focus our main analysis on white collar workers is because layoff decisions for blue collar workers are often determined by seniority. But if this is the case, within a plant's blue collar work force, any high seniority blue collar worker who is laid off must on average be particularly unproductive. This implies that we should see a large lemons effect for this group.12 We verify this by rerunning the regressions of Table 2 but using a restricted sample of blue collar workers including only those who had tenure on the pre-displacement job for at least 3 years (which is about 44% of the full sample). In the specification corresponding to column (9) of Table 2, the coeffcient onlayoff is $-0.041$ with a standard error 0.020. So as predicted, there is a lemon's effect for white male high seniority blue collar workers who are laid off. All other coefficients on the interactions remain statistically insignificant.  \n\n## 3.2 Employment Discrimination Legislation  \n\nThe GK model assumes that firms maximize profits and rationally decide whom to dismiss. It also assumes that the only way for an employer to dismiss low quality workers is through a layoff. In reality, firms can also dismiss workers by firing them for cause. It is plausible that firms can fre the lowest quality workers in the initial period, and when facing a shock, lay off the next lowest quality workers in a later period. Non-economic factors, such as concerns about discrimination lawsuits, can lead employers to alter their methods of dismissal. For example, if workers are more likely to sue for wrongful termination when fired than when dismissed as a part of layoff (see for example, Donohue and Siegelman, 1993), then increases in the expected costs to frms should induce substitution toward layoffs and away from individual firings (i.e. lowering cutoff in the initial screen for those who are more likely to Sue).  \n\nOyer and Schaefer (2000) test the hypothesis by exploring the passage of the Civil Rights   \nAct of 1991 (CRA91), which increases the expected costs to firms of displacing “protected\"   \nemployees (such as blacks and females). While previous federal employment discrimination   \nlegislation typically limited plaintiff recovery to lost wages, CRA91 allows employees to sue   \nfor intentional gender and race discrimination up to $\\$1$ 300,000 in punitive damages; further  \nmore, CRA91 allows employees to claim unlawful termination on the basis of race to sue   \ndent variable. The results are reported in Table A1 in the appendix. Overall the basic pattern is similar to   \nwhitecollar. 12 We thank Charlie Brown for sugesting this idea to us.  \n\nfor unlimited punitive damages. (See Oyer and Schaefer (2000) for more details of the law.) Using data from the 1987-1993 SIPP, they find that, relative to whites, rates of overall involuntary job loss (including both layoff and firing) of black men were unaffected by CRA91.13 However, while black men were significantly more likely to be fired than white men in the pre-CRA91 period, this difference disappeared in the post-CRA91 period.  \n\nWe use CRA91 to look at the implications of asymmetric information on blacks. We do not expect the same argument to work well for women for two reasons. First, the changes in the law affect blacks to a larger extent than for women (and thus represent a larger increase in the expected costs of displacing the “protected\" workers). While punitive damages (up to \\$300,000) apply to employment discrimination for both race and gender, the CRA91 explicitly extends the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which allows plaintiff alleging racial discrimination to sue for unlimited damages, to cover both on-the-job activities and termination of employment. In other words, the CRA91 essentially removed all limits on damage awards in cases of racial discrimination in termination. So blacks could have the most to gain from the passage of the CRA91. Second, empirical evidence from Oyer and Schaefer (2000) suggests that firms responded to the CRA1991 by lowering fring rates for blacks more than whites, but the change in the difference between men and women was statistically insignificant. For both reasons, we would expect the law to have a smaller wage effect for women than for blacks.  \n\nFollowing the logic of the GK model, a layoff (as opposed to a firing) should be a more negative signal for black workers after 1991 than before. Since we are examining layoffs rather than firings, the GK model and the Oyer and Shaefer (2000) results imply that the lemon effect for black workers should be larger after the CRA91 than before. Thus, we would expect wages to fall more dramatically at layoffs for blacks relative to whites after 1991 than before.14  \n\nwhich we divide the sample into two sub-periods: 1981-1991 and 1992-2008. In Table 3 we repeat the specification of Table 2 except that we interact all of the main coefficients of interest with a dummy variable for post 1991. For white collar workers, the estimates tell a strong story that conforms with our prediction if signalling is important. Relative to whites, the wage hit for blacks associated with a layoff is substantially larger after 1991. To put it more literally, prior to 1991 whites had much larger wage declines at layoff than blacks, but that difference essentially disappeared after the CRA91. Further evidence that this is not just sporadic comes from examining the other coefficients. None substantially differ before and after the Civil Rights Act. We take this as evidence that asymmetric information plays an important role in the labor market. However, one should keep in mind that the confidence interval for the key interaction found in the first row of Table 3 is very wide. It is significant at the 5% level, but also is a very high point estimate. At the very least, we find these results highly suggestive that layoff appears to be a relatively more negative signal of quality for African American workers after the CRA91.15  \n\n## 3.3 Length of Unemployment  \n\nOur results to this point have focused only on wages. However, an obvious selection problem arises since we focus only on workers who have been subsequently hired. We are also interested in the overall well being of these individuals which depends not only on the wage impact of displacement, but also the length of the subsequent unemployment spell.  \n\nTo examine this, we follow GK by using a Weibull proportional hazard model to analyze a sample of first spells of joblessness.16 The hazard can be specified as  \n\n$$\n\\gamma t^{\\gamma-1}e^{X_{i}^{\\prime}\\beta}\n$$  \n\nwhere $X_{i}$ is observable covariates, $t$ is duration and $(\\gamma,\\beta)$ are parameters. The nice aspect of the Weibull model is that the expected value of the log duration is linear so that if $T_{i}$ represents the duration of unemployment for individual $i$  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{\\partial E(\\log(T_{i}))}{\\partial X_{i}}}=-{\\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}}.\n$$  \n\nIn Table 4 we report estimates of our model using a specification analogous to Table 2. We report the results in terms of change in average log duration $(-\\beta/\\gamma)$ . For clarity, a positive number means that the average unemployment spell would be longer.  \n\nThe main results in Table 4 are similar to those found in Table 2. First, one can see that for white collar workers, plant closing is relatively worse than layoff for women and blacks in comparison to white males. We also see that for white males, layoff is associated with significantly longer unemployment spells than plant closing. We also again see that plant closing has a much more negative impact on African Americans (and women) than on white males. The result for blue collar workers are quite similar in this case.  \n\nOther results are somewhat different than for wage differences in that we find that layoffs are associated with longer unemployment spells for women and blacks than for white males However, this should not be viewed as surprising. Our results in Table 2 were on wage differences so that we implicitly allow for a fixed effect. The length of unemployment is not analogous because there is nothing like a fixed effect. Thus the comparisons of the level of unemployment by race and gender in Table 4 do not contradict the results in Table 2 which compare wage differences by race and gender.17 It is straightforward to show in a search model (see for example Mortensen, 1987) that one would expect workers with higher wage options to experience shorter unemployment spells. Thus we do not view this result as at all surprising.  \n\nAnother result that does tell a somewhat different story than before is that in Table 2 we found that white males are the only white collar group for which layoff is substantially worse than plant closing. In terms of unemployment spells, the other three demographic groups seem to look similar to white men in the sense that unemployment spells are longer following a layoff One explanation for this result is that workers have advanced warning before a plant closing and may begin the search process at an earlier stage so that they are better prepared when it actually happens.  \n\nOverall, we view these results as telling a story similar to those in Table 2. Relative to layoffs, plant closings are associated with longer spells of unemployment for blacks and women than for white men. Note further that these results suggest that selection bias is not the main driving force behind the wage loss results. To see why, consider a simple reservation wage model in which workers accept a job when the offered wage exceeds the reservation wage. When the reservation wage increases, one would expect the average re-employment wage to go up and the length of the unemployment spell to increase. However, this does not seem to be the driving force behind our estimates. We find that in cases in which reemployment wages fall, relative unemployment spells tend to lengthen. For example, the re-employment wage between layoff versus plant closing is relatively worse for men than women and the unemployment spell is relatively longer. This suggests that the results are not driven by different behavior in the reservation wages, but rather by changes in the demand for workers. In the example the relative demand for workers who lost their job from a layoff versus plant closing is worse for men than women.  \n\n## 3.4 Discussion  \n\nTo summarize our basic results, we find that among white collar workers, plant closings have substantially more negative effects on minorities than on whites. By contrast we find that layoffs seem to have more negative consequences for white men than the other groups. The only group for which wages clearly decline more at layoff than plant closing is white males. The question arises as to what models can explain these results.  \n\nPerhaps the simplest explanation is that individuals from different demographic groups perform different types of jobs and thus have different displacement experiences. We find this difficult to reconcile with Table 2 which shows that these effects are remarkably robust to inclusion of industry and occupation controls.  \n\nThe cleanest evidence in favor of asymmetric information can be found in Table 3. As described above, if asymmetric information were important, one would expect the relative wage losses of blacks following layoffs to increase after 1991 which is precisely what we find (although with large point estimates and standard errors).  \n\nAn intriguing aspect of our empirical results is that the negative consequences of plant closing are much worse for African American white collar workers. One explanation for this result is that some firms discriminate against minorities more than others as in Becker (1971). Minority workers should be more likely to match with nondiscriminatory firms. In that case, the consequences of these nondiscriminatory plants closing is likely to have strong negative consequences for these workers. By contrast, the same argument would not hold for layoffs. If discriminatory firms hire minorities they may be more likely to be lay them off. If this is the case, one would not expect to see such an effect in layoffs.18 Formal development of this model would be relatively difficult if one wants to avoid the unrealistic prediction of perfect segregation across firms. Incorporating labor market frictions such as search frictions could be used to obtain more realistic predictions. For example one could augment a Burdett and Mortensen (1998) type model by allowing frms have heterogeneity in tastes for workers by race. However, given the small sample size of blacks in our sample and the added complication of search frictions (in addition to asymmetric information and heterogeneous human capital), we do not address the race gap in the model below.  \n\nRather we dedicate the rest of this document to the gender gap. The basic result is that the wage loss is similar for men and women at plant closing, but larger for men at layoff. In the next few sections we will show that an asymmetric model modified to include heterogeneous human capital can reconcile these results.  \n\n# 4 Model  \n\nWe develop an equilibrium model with asymmetric information as well as heterogeneous worker and firm types. We present the model in pieces. We first present an overview of the model and then discuss the agents and technology. Next we discuss the behavior of the frms and workers and then describe the equilibrium. We finish this section with a discussion of the specific parameterization we take of the model for the simulations. Derivation of the equilibrium conditions is presented in the appendix.  \n\n## 4.1 Overview of Model  \n\nOur model is characterized by the following key features:  \n\nHeterogeneous Human Capital: There are a finite number ( $L$ ) of worker types. The key feature of a worker type is that workers are perfectly substitutable with other workers of the same type, but not perfectly substitutable with workers of a different type.  \n\nHeterogeneity in Sectors: There are a finite number ( $J$ ) of sectors in the economy. Firms within each sector are identical, but firms across different sectors have different production functions. In general firms from all sectors hire all human capital types, but some sectors will hire certain types at higher rates than others. As an example, both law firms and construction firms hire both blue and white collar workers, but presumably law firms hire relatively more white collar workers.  \n\nAsymmetric Information: Within each worker type, workers are heterogenous in ability. A frm can observe the ability of its current workers, but not the ability of other potential hires.  \n\nJob Seperations: There are two distinct sources of job separation. The first, as in the model of GK, is that when the firm learns the ability of its workers, it lays off the lowest ability workers. The second source is that the firm may be hit by a negative productivity shock and choose to lay off some workers or to close its plants.  \n\nDisplacement as defined in the DWS occurs not from screening by ability, but rather by some shock to the firm (plant closing, slack work, or position abolished). Thus the focus of this model is on workers who are displaced due to a productivity shock. If the shock is not severe enough to lead to a plant closing, the firm chooses to lay off the least productive workers so there will be a lemons effect. At the same time, the nature of the technology shock will infuence the wage change since it leads not only to a job separation, but to a decline in the outside opportunity for the worker as well. Thus changes in earnings depend on both the nature and magnitude of shock that hits the economy. They affect wages through equilibrium effects as well as through an employer's inference of worker quality from the la.yof.  \n\n## 4.2 Agents and Technology  \n\nAs mentioned in the previous section, we have $J$ sectors and $L$ different types of workers. We label the sectors by $j$ for $j=\\{1,...,J\\}$ and label labor types by $\\ell$ for $\\ell=\\{1,...,L\\}$  \n\nWeuse $Y_{\\ell}$ to denote the ability of an individual of type $\\ell$ . A key aspect of the model is asymmetric information. When firms make offers to workers, they do not know their ability.  \n\nHowever, after employing the worker for a period, they learn it. At that point the frm may choose to lay off unproductive workers. As in GK we need to give the incumbent firm some comparative advantage in keeping the worker. We assume that during the first period that a worker works for a firm, his productivity is $Y_{\\ell}$ . For the second period and beyond, his productivity at that firm is $\\tau Y_{\\ell}$ where $\\tau>1$ . This parameter $\\tau$ plays an important role in the analysis. If $\\tau=1$ , no workers would be retained in the equilibrium we examine (unless there is an upper bound to the support of productivity that has a positive probability of occurring). The reason is because the worker's outside wage is essentially the expected productivity of all retained workers. With a smooth cdf, the worst retained worker must be lower than the productivity of the average retained worker, so one can not find an equilibrium. With $\\tau>1$ ， workers have more value in the current firm than in outside firms so that some workers will be retained. In general, the larger is $\\tau$ , the larger the fraction of workers who will be retained.  \n\nWehavemodeled $\\tau$ as if it is firm specific human capital. Alternatively we could interpret $(\\tau-1)Y_{\\ell}$ as a training cost (or other type of hiring cost) that results in lower productivity during the first period.19  \n\nLet $H_{t\\ell j}$ be the aggregate human capital of type $\\ell$ working in sector $j$ at time $t$ .We formally define this in the appendix. It is basically the sum of the productivity across all workers of type $\\ell$ who work in sector $j$ at time $t$ . Let $H_{t j}=(H_{t1j},...,H_{t L j})$ be the vector of inputs for a sector. The production function for sector $j$ at time $t$ takes the form  \n\n$$\nG_{t j}\\left(H_{t j}\\right).\n$$  \n\nWe assume further that each firm within the sector is large enough so that the law of large numbers holds (so that average productivity is all that matters) and that $G$ hasconstant returns to scale.20  \n\nThere are a large number of firms within each sector, free entry, and no search frictions, so the labor market for new hires will be competitive.  \n\n## 4.3 Timing  \n\nTwo different aspects of the timing are important. The first is the definition of the different periods and the second is the timing within a period. We discuss these in order.  \n\nFinite period versions of our model can have implications on wage changes that is driven by the fact that a worker is close to retirement. To avoid this problem, we allow for an infinite number of periods although only the first few periods are of interest. We essentially follow a cohort of workers and firms across time. The timing is defined as:  \n\nPeriod 1: Workers are hired by frms, but the frms have only limited information about worker quality.  \n\nPeriod 2: After learning about worker quality from the first period, during the second they only retain workers above a minimum threshold.  \n\nPeriod 3: The economy is potentially hit by a shock that leads frms to either close or lay off workers. These workers are then rehired by other firms.  \n\nPeriod 4 and beyond: Nothing additional happens as workers continue to work for frms.  \n\nIn terms of more specifics about the timing, the production function remains the same in periods 1 and 2. However, we assume that in period 3 the production process is potentially hit by a shock which may or may not affect different sectors. After period 3, the parameters Oof $G_{t j}$ remain fixed at those values forever. Thus the production function only changes between periods 2 and 3.  \n\nIn our model, frms dismiss workers at the beginning of period 2 and then again at the beginning of period 3. It is important to point out that we view these as distinct phenomena. During period 1, firms learn about the quality of a worker. They choose not to retain the worker because they have fallen below the screening value of the firm. The event that leads to the separation in this case is the firm learning about the quality of the worker. The retention decision at the beginning of period 3 is quite different. These workers have already made it beyond the initial screen, so the event that leads to workers being laid off is an adverse shock to the firm.21 Given the wording of the questions in the DWS, we assume that the data correspond to the latter type of dismissal rather than the former.  \n\nSince they are not of primary concern, workers who are below the cutoff value in period 2 leave this part of the economy permanently (which may seem reasonable given that we are focusing on the white collar sector). However, since our main goal is to focus on the displaced workers, we allow those who are not retained in period 3 to be rehired within this part of the economy.  \n\nNote that in principle a firm could fire a worker in period 4 that it hired in period 3 after learning about his ability. However, in practice this should happen only very rarely. The workers ability was high enough so that in period 2 the worker was retained, and now we are cutting off the right hand tail so the wage premium to them is even smaller. Thus for computational reasons, we ignore this possibility and just assume that workers hired during period 3 will remain forever. Thus for $t>3$ all that changes is that the productivity of the new hires improves and no worker mobility takes place.2  \n\nThe timing within a period is the following:  \n\n1. The firm observes the ability levels for all of its workers from the previous period.   \n2. It chooses whether to lay workers off or to offer them a wage to continue. We do not   \nallow the firm to make an offer that it knows will be turned down.   \n3. Outside firms make offers to both the laid off and retained workers.   \n4. Workers decide which offer to take.   \n5. Workers participate in the production process.  \n\nNote that in part 2 we are not allowing firms to make low ball offers to workers they do not want, but are forcing them to lay them off. Since firms are indifferent between laying off a worker and retaining him with a wage that is lower than the market wage, there will be multiple equilibria in the model. GK describe this class of equilibria. We focus only on the equilibria in which firms never pay a worker lower than their outside option.23  \n\n### 4.4  Behavior of Workers and Firms  \n\nWorker behavior is not particularly interesting in this model. Workers are risk neutral and simply make wage choices to maximize their present discounted value of income. We implicitly assume that workers do not know any more about their own ability than an outside firm as we are not allowing outside firms to construct contracts that might induce the worker to reveal their own ability.  \n\nFirms are much more interesting as they have essentially three things to decide a) which workers to lay off at the beginning of the period, b) the wage to offer the workers that are retained, and c) the wage to offer to outside workers.  \n\nFirst consider the layoff decision. Firms strictly prefer higher ability workers to lower ability workers. Thus, for each human capital type in each sector there exists a cutoff value such that firms only retain those workers whose productivity is above this cutoff value. Denote these cutoff values by $y_{t\\ell j}^{*}$ so that workers are laid offif $Y_{\\ell}<y_{t\\ell j}^{*}$  \n\nNext consider the offers that firms make to outside workers. We assume that outside firms know the cutoff levels of other firms in the economy, but do not know the level of productivity of individual workers. Thus, they make offers based on the expected present value of revenue from the worker conditional on $Y_{\\ell}<y_{t\\ell j}^{*}$ for workers who were laid off and conditional on $Y_{\\ell}\\geq y_{t\\ell j}^{*}$ for workers who were retained. In theory workers who are above the cutoff may be potentially poached by other firms. While this will not happen in equilibrium, this potential “poaching\" plays a key role in the analysis as it determines the outside wage.  \n\nFinally we consider the retention offer. Given the timing of the model, the current firm has no incentive to pay more than a tiny bit over the outside wage. Note that this means that the firm is going to receive rents on many workers in these periods due to the training costs $\\tau$ . However, since the hiring market is competitive, the expected value of these rents was essentially competed away in the form of higher wages given to the worker during the first period.  \n\n### 4.5 Equilibrium  \n\nEquilibrium is characterized by the following four criteria:  \n\n● Outside wages are determined so that firms earn zero profit on average for a worker. · Inside wages (after the first period a worker has worked for a firm) are chosen by the  \n\nfirm to make a worker indifferent between staying or leaving  \n\n● Firms retain workers for whom it is profitable to do so.24   \n· Workers make employment choices to maximize their expected present discounted value of earnings.  \n\nThe details and derivation of the equilibrium conditions are provided in the appendix.  \n\n### 4.6  Parameterization in Simulation  \n\nWe use a CES production function  \n\n$$\nG_{t j}\\left(H_{t j}\\right)=\\left(\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{L}\\alpha_{t\\ell j}H_{t\\ell j}^{\\rho}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\rho}}\n$$  \n\nwith the number of sectors ( $J$ ) equal to five. We assume that individuals of different genders are different worker types and allow for 10 worker types -five for each gender. A key aspect of the model is that different types of human capital are used differently in different firms. In particular we will assume that originally $\\alpha_{1\\ell j}\\in\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ . For each firm and for each gender, $\\alpha$ will take on each of these five numbers. Furthermore, the model is completely symmetric so for each labor type $\\ell$ , the share parameter $\\alpha$ takes on each of the 5 values for some sector.25  \n\nWe simulate shocks to $\\alpha_{t\\ell j}$ to occur between periods two and three. We model three different types of shocks to this economy.  \n\n1. Modest proportional change in $\\alpha_{t\\ell j}$ by $j$ (sector shock)   \n2. Large change in $\\alpha_{t\\ell j}$ by $j$ causing sector to disappear (sector shock-plant closing)   \n3. Proportional change in by $\\ell$ (human capital type shock) $\\alpha_{t\\ell j}$ The first type is a “sector specific shock” in which falls for all values of $\\ell$ in a given $\\alpha_{t\\ell j}$   \nsector $j$ . This can be thought of as a sector specific productivity shock, but could also   \nbe viewed as a demand shock to the sector. If the shock is large enough, the sector will  \n\ndisappear which we view as analogous to a plant closing. We also consider a “human capital type shock” in which $\\alpha_{t\\ell j}$ falls for all values of $j$ for a given human capital type $\\ell$ .Weview this as “skill biased\" technological shock that affects the productivity of a particular skill type. An example of this type of shock is a technological discovery that is substitutable with type $\\ell$ workers (such as the improvement of word processing software for typists).  \n\n# 5 Slack Work and Position Abolished  \n\nA very nice thing about our data is that it contains something akin to the difference between sector shocks and human capital shocks. To be in our layoff sample, an individual reported that the reason of job loss was either “slack work\" or “position abolished.\" We view these as mapping into our model well with the human capital type shock corresponding to position abolished while the firm shock relates to slack work. Intuitively in the model, if the shocks are of similar magnitude, workers who are laid off through a human capital type shock will likely experience a much larger wage loss. The reason is simply that if the shocks occur at the sector level, workers can move into a different sector that did not experience the shock. Due to the equilibrium effect, their wage will still fall but by switching sectors they avoid the first order effect of the shock. By contrast, workers laid off because of a shock to their human capital can do no such thing. Their productivity, and analogously their wage, has fallen at all firms.26  \n\nThe model does not formally imply that the wage losses associated with a human capital shock will be larger than those from a sector shock. However, intuitively one might expect this to be the case and we consistently find it for reasonable parameter values. In particular, if the magnitudes of the shocks are similar, we consistently find larger wage losses for the human capital shock. In fact, in the simulation below, the sector shock is considerably larger than the human capital shock, but the wage losses are almost twice as large for the human capital shock. Thus our intuition from the model is that we would expect to see substantially larger wage losses for those that lose their jobs by position abolished as opposed to slack work.  \n\nWe first informally look at this issue in the data by presenting analyses analogous to Table 2, but distinguishing a layoff between “slack work\" and “position abolished.” These results are shown in Table 5. Looking frst at white collar workers, one can see that in every specification, the point estimates indicate that every group experiences a larger fall in wages for position abolished than for slack work. At the bottom of the table we present the p-value of a joint test as to whether the coefficients on slack work and position abolished are jointly the same. One can see that this hypothesis is strongly rejected in every specification. Once again, one also sees the striking result that neither industry nor occupation is important in explaining these results. We believe these results in Table 5 are of interest in their own right as (to our knowledge) they have not been previously discussed in the literature on displaced worker effects. Although we do not show them explicitly, we also looked at slack work versus position abolished using the Weibull proportional hazard model. We find that for white collar workers, position abolished leads to longer unemployment spells although the effect is not statistically significant.  \n\nGK argue against using blue collar workers because their layoff decisions are determined in large part by collective bargaining decisions. This is an argument as to why one might not expect the lemons effect to arise for blue collar workers, but has little to do with the distinction between slack work and position abolished. Our argument for slack work versus position abolished should hold for blue collar workers as well. We verify this in the blue collar part of Table 5. One can see that we find similar orders of magnitude in the results. The standard errors for blue collar workers are somewhat biger leading to larger p-values.27 In fact the similarity between blue and white collar workers in Table 5 is remarkable. The simplest summary statistic is the difference between the coefficients on slack work and position abolished in columns (4) and (8). This is 0.040 in both cases (with a somewhat larger standard error for blue collar workers). Looking at the comparison with plant closing the results are again qualitatively similar. Workers experience larger wage losses at position abolished than either plant closing or slack work. The difference between plant closing and slack work is not statistically significant for either group.28  \n\nFollowing the logic of our argument, if the magnitudes of the two types of shocks were similar, we would expect to see workers who are laid off due to position abolished to be more likely to switch occupations than worker displaced for other reasons. To verify this, we looked at the probability of changing one digit occupation after displacement by job loss reason. The results, which are reported in Table 6, confirm this prediction. For both blue and white collar workers, those who lost their jobs due to position abolished are more likely to switch occupations that those who lost their jobs due to plant closing or slack work.  \n\n# 6 Reconciling Model with Data  \n\nWe now turn toward reconciling the model with the data. With this in mind, we chose six moments in the data that we hope to match based on column (3) of Table 5. As mentioned above we focus on non-black workers only. By gender, we construct the change in wages at displacement for three different types of displacement: plant closing, position abolished, and slack work. Specifically we calculate the sample average for the other control variables in the model and give this sample average to all groups.  \n\nThe 6 moments we try to fit are presented in the data columns Table 7. One can see three key features of the data that we will show can be explained by the model. The difference in wage loss by gender for plant closing is very small, and is in fact not statistically distinguishable. By contrast, for the two types of layoff we see substantially larger losses for men than for women.29 The second key feature of the data that we plan to match is the difference between slack work and position abolished. We show that with heterogeneous human capital in the model it is straightforward to match this feature of the data. The third feature is that slack work is worse than plant closing for men, but this result goes the other way for women. We should point out that this final feature for men is not statistically significant nor robust across columns in Table 5. We will discuss this issue more below in interpreting the results.  \n\ndenotes gender. Allowing the information to vary by gender is important in fitting the data. We discuss below why $\\sigma_{g}^{2}$ might vary across gender. Thus the difference in wage losses across groups is identical to what the gender $\\times$ dismissal reason would suggest.  \n\nA key piece of this thought exercise is that we restrict the model in another important way by assuming that the gender productivity does not interact with sector at all because the results in Tables 2 and 5 suggest that industry and occupation differences between men and women do not play a crucial role in explaining the results. For this reason we restrict the model so the “industry/occupation \" composition is the same for men and women. Formally, let $\\ell=\\{1,...,5\\}$ denote men and $\\ell=\\{6,...,10\\}$ denote women. We impose that for all states of theworld,  \n\n$$\n\\alpha_{t\\ell j}=\\alpha_{t(\\ell-5)j}\\mathrm{for}\\ell>5.\n$$  \n\nThus shocks hit men and women in exactly the same way. So, for example, a human capital type shock that hits skill group $\\ell=3$ for men will also hit group $\\ell=8$ for women. This means in the end we have three data moments that differ by gender but in the simulation we only have one parameter that differs by gender. Thus even though there are many parameters in the model, we are certainly not guaranteed to be able to fit the data.  \n\nWe assume that there are 16 states of the world in period 3. With probability 0.97 no shock is experienced. Then we put $0.2\\%$ probability on each of the other 15. These other 15 correspond to 5 of each type of the shock above. That is because we have 5 sectors, each sector has a $0.2\\%$ probability of getting hit by a modest proportional change in $\\alpha_{j\\ell}$ and also a $0.2\\%$ probability of getting hit by a large change in $\\alpha_{j\\ell}$ which causes it to shut down. For each gender, we also have 5 labor types and each has a 0.2% probability of getting hit by a proportional change in $\\alpha_{j\\ell}$  \n\nThe model has many different margins to complicate it. To ease the computational burden, we restrict turnover in a few ways. First, as mentioned above in Section 4, we restrict the amount of multiple layofs in two ways: a) workers that do not make the initial cut in period 2 disappear from this part of the labor market, and b) we do not allow for additional layoffs after period 3. Additionally, for the sector specific shock we only allow for layoffs in the sectors which experienced the shocks. In principal, since the outside option has changed, there could be some layoffs for other firms as well. However, this should be small, not of primary interest in this analysis, and incorporating it would make the model substantially more difficult to solve.  \n\nThis leaves us with essentially 4 types of parameters: the elasticity of substitution $(\\rho)$ , the training cost $(\\tau)$ , the standard deviation of the unknown component of ability $(\\sigma_{g})$ , and the magnitudes of the shocks. Despite the simplifications described in the previous paragraph, we found the model to be very difficult to solve. We need to solve for the firing, hiring, and wage decisions for different sectors in different states of the world for different times. Thus this is a high dimensional problem and is non-smooth as every sector turns out to be at a corner solution either in terms of layoffs or hiring or both at every point in time. We do not know which constraints will bind ex-ante. While ideally we would simultaneously solve for the parameters of the model to fit the data and solve for the equilibrium of the model, this did not work well. While we were able to find a set of parameters that fit our data perfectly, the equilibrium had some odd features. We would, of course, be happy to provide those details to any interested readers. The strange features primarily arose from the fact that we found $\\tau=1.011$ for men but 1.16 for women and $\\sigma_{g}=0.005$ for men but 0.0001 for women. This made the behavior of men and women look very different. We see no reason for $\\tau$ to differ by gender and prefer results where we fix it to be the same by gender.30 Instead we chose a more adaptive approach to find solutions for the model. As a practical matter, we found that when a plant closes, the only parameter that matters substantially for the simulated results is the elasticity of substitution. Furthermore, in practice, the wage loss with plant closing in the simulations will be very close across gender-and the difference in the data is not statistically significant. Thus we do not try to match this difference exactly, but rather choose a value of $\\rho$ that matches approximately. This process led to the value $\\rho=0.15$ . We then searched over other parameters for a version of the model that was close to the data. While we have a number of diffrent parameters, only $\\sigma_{g}$ varies by gender. Thus again we should highlight that our goal is to show that the model can reconcile the data (which it is certainly not guaranteed to) and to give a sense of the parameter values that do that.  \n\nThe results of this simulation are presented in Table 7. These simulation results are very close to the four moments that we are trying to fit. The parameters that lead to this fit are shown in the bottom panel of Table 7. The standard deviation of unobserved ability is substantially higher for men than it is for women. In the simulation, this leads the “lemon\" effect to be larger for men than for women. It essentially embodies the idea that a layoff is a stronger signal for men than it is for women. It is important that the reader not take this parameter too literally. Another interpretation of the phenomena is that the decision to lay off an individual is more complicated than in the model and involves other factors beyond just pure ability such as the value of home production which could change the threshold.31 If it were the case that the decision to layoff off a man was based purely on his market ability, but the decision to lay off a woman depended on both market ability and the value of non-market time, then the signal for a man would be stronger than the signal for a woman. We don't view this as a fundamentally different model than the one we have written down, but rather view it as a potential reason why layoff is a more informative signal for men than it is for women (which is the essence of the higher value of $\\sigma_{g}$ in the results).32  \n\nA second feature of the results is that the value of $\\tau$ is quite large. Note that in the model, this does not lead to a higher measured return to tenure in a log wage regression because the firm pays the outside wage. High values of $\\tau$ can not be avoided when asymmetric information is important and retention rates are reasonably high. Since a firm pays workers with identical observable characteristics the same-and the same as their outside market, they have a strong incentive to fire the workers with the worst unobservable attributes. If a majority of workers are retained it must be that these worst workers are relatively more productive for the current firm than for the outside labor market. Thus it must be the case that some combination of hiring costs, training costs, or specific human capital are important. Any of these can be interpreted as $\\tau$  \n\nWe simulate the effects of three types of shocks. With plant closing, one sector disappears and all workers leave for another sector. For the sector shock, sector $j^{*}$ is hit by a shock that leads to a 1.5% decline in the factor loading parameter. Formally this means that  \n\n$$\n\\alpha_{3\\ell j}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c c}{{0.985\\alpha_{2\\ell j}}}&{{j=j^{*}}}\\ {{\\alpha_{2\\ell j}}}&{{\\mathrm{otherwise}}}\\end{array}\\right..\n$$  \n\nWe see in Panel B of Table 7 that this leads $5.1\\%$ of menand $3.1\\%$ ofwomenwhowere employed in this sector to be laid off. Note that this is a somewhat larger shock than it might initially appear to be. Part of the CES production function can be written as  \n\n$\\alpha H^{\\rho}=\\left(\\alpha^{1/\\rho}H\\right)^{\\rho}$ . So multiplying $\\alpha$ by 0.985 is analogous to multiplying worker productivity by $0.985^{1/\\rho}=0.904$  \n\nFor the human capital type shock we consider a decline of $0.3\\%$ in the factor loading parameter. That is, if type $\\ell^{*}\\leq5$ is hit by the shock this means that  \n\n$$\n\\alpha_{3\\ell j}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c l}{{0.997\\alpha_{2\\ell j}}}&{{\\ell=\\ell^{\\ast}~\\mathrm{or}~\\ell=\\ell^{\\ast}+5}}\\ {{\\alpha_{2\\ell j}}}&{{\\mathrm{otherwise}}}\\end{array}\\right..\n$$  \n\nSince this is a negative shock to all sectors, the layoff probabilities are lower: 1.5% for men and $1.1\\%$ for women. This multiple is analogous to a $0.997^{1/\\rho}=0.980$ multiple on human capital. Note that while the decline in productivity of the shocks is substantially smaller in this case, the wage penalty is much larger for position abolished than for slack work. This is a more general feature that comes out of the model rather than being an artifact of the particular normalization. As mentioned above, when a sector is hit by a shock, other sectors are not. Therefore a worker can move to a sector that was not hit. However, this is not possible for a human capital shock as the worker's productivity has declined everywhere.  \n\nWe have shown in this section that our model is consistent with the data. Since the model is highly parameterized there might be a question of whether the fact that we can reconcile the data is particularly surprising or interesting. On this point we make three main comments. First, an important finding in the empirical section is that occupation and industry play little role in explaining the gender difference in plant closing and layoff. Thus we do not allow this to reconcile the difference. Second, heterogeneous human capital is crucial to explain the results. For both genders we see larger wage losses at position abolished than for slack work.  \n\nThe third and most nuanced is understanding the role that asymmetric information plays in the model. Given our parameterization, asymmetric information is important for two reasons. First, it is only $\\sigma_{g}$ that can explain the difference between men and women. Second, it is necessary to explain the fact that the loss for slack work is larger than the loss at plant closing for men. However, both of these might be regarded as weak support. We do not have a good theory as to why the standard deviation of unobserved ability varies by gender but other parameters do not. We could presumably allow all of the parameters to vary by gender and still be able to reconcile the results. The second reason is that in the model, the only way to explain the fact that men experience larger wage losses for slack work than for plant closings is because of the lemons effect. However, as noted above, the difference here is not statistically significant nor robust across specifications. A better view of the data is that the wage loss for slack work and plant closing is roughly the same. However, note that this is not what the model would predict in the absence of asymmetric information. Since a plant closing represents a much larger shock to the sector, it would lead to a larger wage loss. Thus the fact that slack work is similar to plant closing can be taken as evidence of asymmetric information. The strength of this evidence depends on one's priors of how large this difference might be. At the very least, we take the simulations as evidence that asymmetric information could be important and that the results for women should not be taken as evidence against this idea.  \n\n# 7 Conclusions  \n\nIn a seminal paper Gibbons and Katz (1991) develop and empirically test a model of asymmetric information in the labor market. They derive an implication of their model that if asymmetric information is important, one should expect a larger fall in earnings at layoff than at plant closing. Using the Displaced Worker Survey, they show this implication to be true for men. We revisit this question making use of the many more years of data that are available now. We test the hypothesis on four different demographic groups. The GK predictions stands for white men. However, for two of the four groups (black men and black women), we find the opposite of the Gibbons and Katz prediction; plant closings lead to more negative consequences than do layoffs. For white women, the losses at plant closings and layoff are very similar. We show that these differences occur for two reasons. First, white men experience larger earnings declines at layoff than the other groups. Second, black workers experience substantially larger decreases in their earnings at plant closing than do whites.  \n\nWe document four other aspects of the data. First, the basic results are remarkably robust to occupation and industry controls. Second, following Oyer and Schaefer (2000), we make use of the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (CRA91) to test an implication of the model. We show that black workers experience a relatively larger loss in earnings at layoffs after 1991 than before which is consistent with asymmetric information. We think this is the strongest evidence in favor of asymmetric information. Third, we demonstrate similar patterns when we look at the length of unemployment spells following displacement. Fourth, we document for the first time in the literature that the two types of layoffs reported in the DWS data have very different features in terms of earnings losses. In particular, we find that losses in earnings are greater when layoff is associated with “position abolished\" then when it is associated with “slack work.\"  \n\nWe develop a model that incorporates heterogeneous human capital into an asymmetric information framework based on GK. The model includes different types of firms and different types of workers. In the model, once a worker has worked for a firm for a period the current firm knows his/her skill level, but outside firms do not. We model layoffs and plant closings as resulting when shocks hit firms in which the workers work. We then numerically simulate the model and show that one can find parameters of the model to make it consistent with thedata.  \n\nWe simulate the model and show that it captures the key features of the data. In particular, asymmetric information plays the key role in explaining the gender gap in the model and this result is reconciled with the fact that in the data wage losses at both types of layoff (but not plant closing) differ substantially by gender. The basic idea is that for some reason, being laid off is a relatively more important signal for a man than for a woman. The point estimates of the model suggest that the standard deviation of unobserved ability (to the outside firm) is larger for men than for women. As we cautioned earlier, however, one does not necessarily want to take this literally. It could be standing in for some other feature of the data such as the layoff decision is more complicated for women than for men so that unobserved ability is a relatively more important factor. One interesting extension can be to extend the model to allow for layoff decisions to depend on both market ability and the value of non-market time, which in general can differ by gender, and then investigate the mechanisms directly.  \n\nAnother extension of the analysis would be to incorporate heterogeneity of taste discrimination across frms in the model to explain the fact that blacks suffer greater wage penalties from plant closings than whites.  \n\nBoth of these extensions are very interesting and important. More generally our model is overly simple in many dimensions. However, sorting out these alternatives require more data than we get in the DWS where we essentially just have the six numbers in Table 7. Other useful data sets are available and we leave this work for future research.  \n\nGibbons and Katz acknowledge at the end of their paper that “Unfortunately, the nature of asymmetric information seems to imply that direct empirical tests of its importance are not possible, so indirect tests of the kind presented here may be all that is possible.\" We share the sentiment and agree that our data are not rich enough to precisely distinguish between all potential explanations. However, we have provided additional evidence to bear on these issues and our results strongly suggest that heterogeneous human capital is important. While the evidence in support of asymmetric information is weaker, in our simulations it does play an important role. We hope that alternative data sources can be found which will shed more light on these important issues in the future research.  \n\n## Appendix: Derivation of Equilibrium Conditions  \n\nWe start by defining the aggregate human capital inputs. Let $f_{\\ell j}$ denote the fraction of workers of type $\\ell$ who work in sector $j$ at time 1 and $\\phi_{\\ell h j}$ the fraction of $\\ell$ type workers who worked for an $h$ sector firm in periods 1 and 2, were not retained by $h$ in period 3, and were hired into sector $j$ in state. In principle firms can “poach\" retained workers from other frms and we should include notation to account for this. Since this does not happen in equilibrium we do not explicitly account for it.  \n\nDuring the first period, $Y_{\\ell}$ is not revealed so there will be no sorting among workers into sectors. Thus the aggregate human capital takes the value  \n\n$$\nH_{1\\ell j}=f_{\\ell j}E\\left(Y_{\\ell}\\right).\n$$  \n\nDuring the second period some workers can be laid off. The ones who remain will be more productive by the factor $\\tau$ Sothat  \n\n$$\nH_{2\\ell j}=f_{\\ell j}E\\left(\\tau Y_{\\ell}1\\left(Y_{\\ell}\\geq y_{2\\ell j}^{*}\\right)\\right)\n$$  \n\nwhere $1\\left(\\cdot\\right)$ is the indicator function. In the third period in addition some new workers can be hired from other sectors  \n\n$$\nH_{3\\ell j}=f_{\\ell j}E\\left(\\tau Y_{\\ell}1\\left(Y_{\\ell}\\geq y_{3\\ell j}^{*}\\right)\\right)+\\sum_{h=1}^{J}\\phi_{\\ell h j}E(Y_{\\ell}\\mid y_{2\\ell h}^{*}<Y_{\\ell}\\leq y_{3\\ell h}^{*}).\n$$  \n\nWe allow firms to both dismiss workers (if $y_{3\\ell j}^{*}>y_{2\\ell j}^{*}$ )and hire new workers (if $\\phi_{\\ell h j}>0$ ).In our simulations we allow firms to do both, but never found a case in which they do. Finally for all periods after period 3,  \n\n$$\nH_{t\\ell j}=f_{\\ell j}E\\left(\\tau Y_{\\ell}1\\left(Y_{\\ell}\\geq y_{3\\ell j}^{\\ast}\\right)\\right)+\\sum_{h=1}^{J}\\phi_{\\ell h j}E(\\tau Y_{\\ell}\\mid y_{2\\ell h}^{\\ast}<Y_{\\ell}\\leq y_{3\\ell h}^{\\ast}).\n$$  \n\nWe define some additional notation. Let $\\widetilde{y}_{\\ell\\mathcal{H}}$ be the conditional expectation of the productivity of a worker of type $\\ell$ who has experienced labor market history $\\mathcal{H}$ . During the second period, a worker who worked in sector $j$ during period $1$ and was retained will have history $\\mathcal{H}=j$ and $\\widetilde{y}_{\\ell j}=E\\left(Y_{\\ell}\\mid Y_{\\ell}\\geq y_{2\\ell j}^{*}\\right)$ . During period 3 and beyond, a worker who worked in sector $j$ will have history $\\mathcal{H}=j r$ where $r$ is a dummy variable indicating whether the worker was retained. For example one history $\\mathcal{H}$ may be that a worker started at firm $j$ and were retained throughout, then $\\mathcal{H}=j1$ and $\\widetilde{y}_{\\ell j1}=E\\left(Y_{\\ell}\\mid Y_{\\ell}\\geq y_{3\\ell j}^{*}\\right)$ . Another potential history $\\mathcal{H}$ is that an individual was retained by a firm in sector $j$ in period 2, but then laid off by that firm in period 3. In that case, $\\mathcal{H}=j0$ and $\\widetilde{y}_{\\ell j0}=E\\left(Y_{\\ell}\\mid y_{2\\ell j}^{*}<Y_{\\ell}\\leq y_{3\\ell j}^{*}\\right)$  \n\nIt is easiest to solve this model by working backwards from period $t\\geq4$ . Since nothing changes after period 4, all of these periods will look identical. Consider a frm $j$ tryingto poach an $\\ell$ type worker from another firm. Then for any history $\\mathcal{H}$ , the expected marginal value of workers who are hired in period 4 is  \n\n$$\n\\widetilde{y}_{\\ell\\mathcal{H}}\\frac{\\partial G_{4j}(H_{4j})}{\\partial H_{4\\ell j}}+\\sum_{t=5}^{\\infty}\\beta^{t-4}\\tau\\widetilde{y}_{\\ell\\mathcal{H}}\\frac{\\partial G_{t j}(H_{t j})}{\\partial H_{t\\ell j}}=\\widetilde{y}_{\\ell\\mathcal{H}}\\frac{\\partial G_{4j}(H_{4j})}{\\partial H_{4\\ell j}}\\left(\\frac{1-\\beta+\\beta\\tau}{1-\\beta}\\right)\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\beta$ is the discount rate since $G_{t j}$ and $H_{t j}$ do not vary over time (after period 4). Wages will be constant across time and the wage will be determined by the best outside opportunity. This yields that the outside wage during period 4 for an individual of type $\\ell$ with labor market history $\\mathcal{H}$ is  \n\n$$\nw_{t\\ell\\mathcal{H}}=\\operatorname*{max}_{j=\\{1,\\dots,J\\}}\\widetilde{y}_{\\ell\\mathcal{H}}\\frac{\\partial G_{t j}(H_{4j})}{\\partial H_{t\\ell j}}\\left(\\frac{1-\\beta+\\beta\\tau}{1-\\beta}\\right)\n$$  \n\nfor $t\\geq4$ . Employers must keep the workers indifferent between leaving and staying and the outside wage does not change after period 4, so employers will pay the constant outside wage $w_{t\\ell\\mathcal{H}}$ in all periods after period 4.  \n\nNow consider period 3 in which there will be some turnover. We first consider the market for workers of type $\\ell$ from a frm in sector $h$ who are retained $(Y_{\\ell}>y_{3\\ell h}^{*}$ ). If a firm in sector $j$ considers hiring them, it will make expected profit  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial G_{3j}(H_{3j})}{\\partial H_{3\\ell j}}\\widetilde{y}_{\\ell h1}-w_{3\\ell h1}+\\frac{\\beta}{1-\\beta}\\left(\\frac{\\partial G_{4j}(H_{4j})}{\\partial H_{4\\ell j}}\\tau\\widetilde{y}_{\\ell h1}-w_{4\\ell h1}\\right)\n$$  \n\nwhere $w_{3\\ell h1}$ is the outside wage for such a retained worker. Since the market is competitive between firms both within and between sectors,  \n\n$$\nw_{3\\ell h1}=\\operatorname*{max}_{j=\\{1,\\dots,J\\}}\\left[\\frac{\\partial G_{3j}(H_{3j})}{\\partial H_{3\\ell j}}\\widetilde{y}_{\\ell h1}+\\frac{\\beta}{1-\\beta}\\left(\\frac{\\partial G_{4j}(H_{4j})}{\\partial H_{4\\ell j}}\\tau\\widetilde{y}_{\\ell h1}-w_{4\\ell h1}\\right)\\right].\n$$  \n\nIn determining the cutoff $y_{3\\ell j}^{*}$ , the firm has to be indifferent between keeping and retaining a worker with $Y_{\\ell}=y_{3\\ell j}^{*}$ . This yields that  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{y_{3\\ell j}^{*}=\\operatorname*{max}\\left\\{\\frac{w_{3\\ell j1}+\\frac{\\beta}{1-\\beta}w_{4\\ell j1}}{\\frac{\\partial G_{3j}(H_{3j})}{\\partial H_{3\\ell j}}\\tau+\\frac{\\beta}{1-\\beta}\\frac{\\partial G_{4j}(H_{4j})}{\\partial H_{4\\ell j}}\\tau},y_{j\\ell2}^{*}\\right\\}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFinally, consider a worker of type $\\ell$ who was displaced $(Y_{\\ell}\\leq y_{3\\ell h}^{*})$ from frm $h$ . He will be paid his best opportunity in the competitive market:  \n\n$$\nw_{3\\ell h0}=\\operatorname*{max}_{j=\\{1,\\dots,J\\}}\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial G_{3j}(H_{3j})}{\\partial H_{3\\ell j}}\\widetilde{y}_{\\ell h0}+\\frac{\\beta}{1-\\beta}\\left(\\frac{\\partial G_{4j}(H_{4j})}{\\partial H_{4\\ell j}}\\tau\\widetilde{y}_{\\ell h0}-w_{4\\ell h0}\\right)\\right\\}\n$$  \n\nwhere the expression on the right hand side comes from the zero profit constraint for each firm.  \n\nFor workers who are above the cutoffs during period 3, the firms that retain them will receive rents. Since these rents will be bid away by firms when hiring workers in earlier periods we will need to keep track of them. We define the expected rent as a function of a worker's ability $y$ as:  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_{\\textit{j}}\\left(y\\right)=E\\left\\{1\\left(y\\geq y_{3\\ell j}^{*}\\right)\\left[\\frac{\\partial G_{3j}\\left(H_{3j}\\right)}{\\partial H_{3\\ell j}}\\tau y-w_{3\\ell h1}+\\frac{\\beta}{1-\\beta}\\left(\\frac{\\partial G_{4j}\\left(H_{4j}\\right)}{\\partial H_{4\\ell j}}\\tau y-w_{4\\ell h1}\\right)\\right]\\right\\}\n$$  \n\nNext consider period 2. In this case workers who are not retained leave this labor market (and presumably go to the blue collar sector). We write the production function in sector $j$ for periods 1 and 2 as $F_{j}$ . Using notation analogous to above, we let $w_{2\\ell h}$ be the outside wage for workers who are retained in sector $h$ . The equilibrium outside wage is defined so that expected marginal proft is zero:  \n\n$$\nw_{2\\ell h}=\\operatorname*{max}_{j=\\{1,\\dots,J\\}}\\frac{\\partial G_{2j}(H_{2j})}{\\partial H_{2\\ell j}}\\widetilde{y}_{\\ell h}+\\beta E\\left(\\pi_{\\ell j}\\left(Y_{\\ell}\\right)\\mid Y_{\\ell}\\geq y_{2\\ell h}^{*}\\right).\n$$  \n\nA frm chooses the cutoff value $y_{2\\ell h}^{*}$ So that it is just indiferent about retaining the worker  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial G_{2j}(H_{2j})}{\\partial H_{2\\ell j}}\\tau y_{2\\ell h}^{*}-w_{2\\ell h}+\\beta E\\left(\\pi_{\\ell j}\\left(y_{2\\ell h}^{*}\\right)\\right)=0.\n$$  \n\nNote from equations (A-9) and (A-10) one can see the importance of $\\tau>1$ . The final part of equation (A-9) involves future profits for the average worker while the expression (A-10) involves future rents from the marginal worker which must be lower. One needs $\\tau>1$ to find a nondegenerate value of $y_{2\\ell h}^{*}$ to solve these equations.  \n\nFinally during the first period, in equilibrium firms will offer wages so that the marginal profit iszero  \n\n$$\n\\Sigma\\left(Y_{\\ell}\\right)\\frac{\\partial G_{1j}\\left(H_{1j}\\right)}{\\partial H_{1\\ell j}}+\\beta\\operatorname*{Pr}(Y_{\\ell}>y_{2\\ell h}^{\\ast})\\left[\\frac{\\partial G_{2j}\\left(H_{2j}\\right)}{\\partial H_{2\\ell j}}\\tau\\widetilde{y}_{\\ell j}-w_{2\\ell j}+\\beta E\\left(\\pi_{\\ell j}\\left(Y_{\\ell}\\right)\\mid Y_{\\ell}\\geq y_{2\\ell}\\right)\\right],\n$$  \n\nWorkers choose firms to maximize their expected present value of earnings. We assume that workers have no more information about their ability than do the firms. We do not explicitly give the form for the present value of earnings, but all of the components of the wages have been defined.  \n\nThe equilibrium of the model is characterized by equations (A-1)-(A-11)  \n\nReferences   \nAbraham, Katharine G., and James L.

More productive firms pay higher wages and exporting increases the wage paid by a firm with a given productivity. The opening of trade enhances wage inequality and can either raise or reduce unemployment. While wage inequality is higher in a trade equilibrium than in autarky, gradual trade liberalization first increases and later decreases inequality.  \n\nKEYwORDs: Wage inequality, international trade, risk, unemployment.  \n\n## 1. INTRODUCTION  \n\nTwO CORE ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE are the allocation of resources across economic activities and the distribution of incomes across factors of production. In this paper, we develop a new framework for examining the determinants of resource allocation and income distribution in which both wage inequality and unemployment respond to trade. Our framework encompasses a number of important features of product and labor markets, as a result of which it generates predictions that match features of the data. This framework is rich, fexible, and tractable, as we demonstrate by deriving a number of interesting results on trade, inequality, and unemployment. In addition, we show how this framework can be extended in various ways and how it can accommodate different general equilibrium structures. Moreover, our framework fits squarely into the new view of foreign trade that emphasizes firm heterogeneity in differentiated product sectors.  \n\nWe introduce standard Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides search and matching frictions into a Melitz (2003) model, but unlike previous work in this area, such as Helpman and Itskhoki (2010), we also introduce ex post match-specific heterogeneity in a worker's ability. Because a worker's ability is not directly observable by his employer, firms screen workers to improve the composition of their employees. Complementarities between workers? abilities and firm productivity imply that firms have an incentive to screen workers to exclude those with lower abilities. As larger firms have higher returns to screening and the screening technology is the same for all firms, more productive firms screen more intensively and have workforces of higher average ability than less productive firms. Search frictions induce multilateral bargaining between a firm and its workers, and since higher-ability workforces are more costly to replace, more productive firms pay higher wages. When the economy is opened to trade, the selection of more productive firms into exporting increases their revenue relative to less productive firms, which further enhances their incentive to screen workers to exclude those of lower ability. As a result, exporters have workforces of higher average ability than nonexporters and hence pay higher wages. This mechanism generates a wage-size premium and implies that exporting increases the wage paid by a firm with a given productivity. Both features of the model have important implications for wage inequality within sectors and within groups of workers with the same ex ante characteristics.  \n\nOur first main result is that the opening of a closed economy to trade raises wage inequality. The intuition for this result is that larger firms pay higher wages and the opening of trade increases the dispersion of firm revenues, which in turn increases the dispersion of firm wages. This result is more general than our model in the sense that it holds in a wider class of models in which firm wages are increasing in firm revenue and there is selection into export markets. We provide a proof that the opening of trade raises wage inequality for any inequality measure that respects second-order stochastic dominance, and this result holds for a class of models satisfying the following three sufficient conditions: firm wages and employment are power functions of firm productivity, exporting increases the wage paid by a firm with a given productivity, and firm productivity is Pareto distributed.2,3  \n\nOur second main result is that once the economy is open to trade, the relationship between wage inequality and trade openness is at first increasing and later decreasing. As a result, a given change in trade frictions can either raise or reduce wage inequality, depending on the initial level of trade openness. The intuition for this result stems from the increase in firm wages that occurs at the productivity threshold above which firms export, which is only present when some but not all firms export. When no firm exports, a small reduction in trade costs increases wage inequality, because it induces some firms to export and raises the wages paid by these exporting firms relative to domestic firms. When all firms export, a small rise in trade costs increases wage inequality, because it induces some firms to cease exporting and reduces the wages paid by these domestic firms relative to exporting firms.  \n\nAnother key prediction of our framework is that these two results hold regardless of general equilibrium effects. To demonstrate this, we derive these results from comparisons across firms that hold in sectoral equilibrium irrespective of how the sector is embedded in general equilibrium. It follows that our results for sectoral wage inequality do not depend on the impact of trade on aggregate variables and variables in other sectors. We use our framework to derive closed-form expressions for the sectoral wage distribution. This distribution depends on an extensive margin of trade openness (the fraction of exporting firms) and an intensive margin of trade openness (relative revenue in the export and domestic markets). We characterize the relationship between these extensive and intensive margins of trade openness and the exogenous parameters of the model such as fixed and variable trade costs.  \n\nSince workers are ex ante homogeneous, wage inequality in our model is within-group inequality. Our theoretical results are therefore consistent with empirical findings of increased within-group wage inequality following trade liberalization (see, for example, Attanasio, Goldberg, and Pavcnik (2004) and Menezes-Filho, Muendler, and Ramey (2008)). As these theoretical results hold for asymmetric countries, they are also consistent with empirical findings of increased wage inequality following trade liberalization in both developed and developing countries (see, for example, the survey by Goldberg and Pavcnik (2007)).  \n\nWhile our focus is within-group inequality, we also develop an extension in which there are multiple types of workers with different observable ex ante characteristics. We show that our results for the impact of trade on withingroup wage inequality hold in this more general framework; in particular, trade raises wage inequality within every group of workers. While betweengroup inequality of wages can rise or fall, the rise in within-group inequality can dominate when between-group inequality falls, so that overall inequality rises.  \n\nIn our framework, the opening of trade results in endogenous changes in workforce composition and measured firm productivity. The increase in revenue at exporters induces them to screen workers more intensively, while the decrease in revenue at nonexporters causes them to screen workers less intensively. It follows that more productive firms experience larger increases in average worker ability and wages following the opening of trade, which strengthens the correlation between firm productivity and average worker ability and echoes the empirical findings of Verhoogen (2008). To the extent that empirical measures of productivity do not completely control for differences in workforce composition, these endogenous changes in workforce composition also result in endogenous changes in measured firm productivity. As more productive firms experience the largest increases in average worker ability following the opening of trade, they also exhibit the largest increases in measured firm productivity.  \n\nAnother distinctive feature of our framework is the interaction between wage inequality and unemployment. The unemployment rate depends on the fraction of workers searching for employment that are matched (the tightness of the labor market) and the fraction of these matched workers that are hired (the hiring rate). While the more intensive screening of more productive firms implies that they pay higher wages, it also implies that they hire a smaller fraction of the workers with whom they are matched. As a result, the reallocation of resources toward more productive firms that occurs following the opening of trade reduces the hiring rate and increases the unemployment rate. In contrast, the tightness of the labor market can either remain constant following the opening of trade (as in Helpman and Itskhoki (2010)) or can rise (as in Felbermayr, Prat, and Schmerer (2008) and Felbermayr, Larch, and Lechthaler (2009)) depending on what happens to expected worker income, which in turn depends on how the model is closed in general equilibrium. Therefore, the net effect on the unemployment rate of opening a closed economy to trade is ambiguous. In contrast to the unambiguous results for wage inequality, our analysis suggests that unemployment can either rise or fall following the opening of trade, which is consistent with the lack of a clear consensus on the empirical relationship between trade and unemployment (see, for example, the discussion in Davidson and Matusz (2009)).  \n\nWorker ability admits two possible interpretations within our framework. One interpretation is that ability is match-specific and independently distributed across matches. Another interpretation is that ability is a general talent of a worker that does not depend on his match, but is unobservable to both workers and firms. In the static model that we develop here, the analysis is the same irrespective of which interpretation is taken. In both cases, workers do not know their ability and have no incentive to direct their search across firms or sectors. However, our preferred interpretation is that ability is matchspecific, because this interpretation makes our static model consistent with the steady state of a dynamic search and matching model, since the screening of a worker for one match reveals no information about their ability for other potential matches.4 Under the alternative interpretation that ability is a general talent of workers, wage inequality in the model has a worker component as well as a firm component. Since more productive firms screen more intensively and pay higher wages, only more able workers receive the higher wages paid by more productive firms.5  \n\nOur paper is related to a large literature on trade, wage inequality, and unemployment. One broad area of research has explored the relationship between trade and wage inequality in models with neoclassical labor markets. Yeaple (2005) and Bustos (2009) developed models of monopolistic competition in which firms make endogenous choices about production technology and observable skill composition. Ohnsorge and Trefler (2007) and Costinot and Vogel (2009) examined the relationship between trade and wage inequality in competitive assignment models. Burstein and Vogel (2009) developed a model in which both comparative advantage and skill-biased technology play a role in determining the relationship between trade and wage inequality.  \n\nAnother broad area of research has examined the implications of labor market frictions for the impact of trade on unemployment and wage inequality. One strand of this literature has considered models of efficiency or fair wages. Davis and Harrigan (2007) developed a model of firm heterogeneity and efficiency wages in which wages vary across firms because of differences in monitoring technology, and equilibrium unemployment exists to induce workers to supply effort. Egger and Kreickemeier (2009a, 2009b) and Amiti and Davis (2008) developed models of firm heterogeneity and fair wages in which the fair wage at which workers supply effort is assumed to vary with either firm productivity, revenue, or profits.  \n\nYet another strand of this literature has considered models of search and matching, which provide natural microfoundations for labor market frictions.6 In important research, Davidson, Martin, and Matusz (1988, 1999) showed that the introduction of search and matching frictions into competitive models of international trade has predictable implications for the relationship between relative goods and factor prices. Using models of firm heterogeneity with search and matching frictions, Felbermayr, Prat, and Schmerer (2008), Felbermayr, Larch, and Lechthaler (2009), and Helpman and Itskhoki (2010) examined the relationship between trade and unemployment. None of these  \n\n5Embedding this alternative interpretation in a dynamic framework would be more complicated, because screening for one match reveals information about a worker's productivity for other potential matches. As a result, the ex post distribution of worker ability among the unemployed would no longer be equal to the ex ante distribution of worker ability. Additionally, as workers gradually learn about their ability, more able workers would have an incentive to direct their search toward more productive firms.  \n\n6Seminal models of search and matching include Mortensen (1970), Pissarides (1974), Diamond (1982a, 1982b), and Mortensen and Pissarides (1994). One line of research follows Burdett and Mortensen (1998) in analyzing wage dispersion in models of wage posting and random search. Another line of research examines wage dispersion when both firms and workers are heterogeneous, including models of pure random search, such as Acemoglu (1999) and Shimer and Smith (2000), and models incorporating on-the-job search, such as Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002), Cahuc, Postel-Vinay, and Robin (2006), and Lentz (2010).  \n\npapers, however, features wage dispersion across firms, because more productive firms expand on the extensive margin of matched workers until the bargained wage rate equals the replacement cost of a worker. Our main point of departure from these studies is the introduction of ex post heterogeneity in worker ability and screening of workers by firms, which generates wage dispersion across firms that is influenced by both search frictions and trade liberalization.  \n\nOur modelling of labor market frictions is also related to the one-period search models of Acemoglu (1999) and Acemoglu and Shimer (1999), in which firms make irreversible investments in capacity or technology before being matched one-to-one with workers. Davidson, Matusz, and Shevchenko (2008) examined the impact of international trade in a model of this form, where firms choose either a high or low technology and can be matched with either a highor low-skill manager. In equilibria where high-skill managers are willing to accept jobs at low-technology firms and only high-technology firms export, the model features an exporter wage premium and trade liberalization increases the wage gap between high- and low-skill managers. One key difference between our approach and these models is that we allow for an endogenous measure of matched workers for each firm rather than assuming one-to-one matching between firms and workers. Modelling endogenous variation in firm size enables our framework to speak in a meaningful way to empirically observed correlations between productivity, employment, and wages, which is important for the within-industry reallocations induced by trade liberalization. Once this endogenous variation in firm size is introduced, differences in workforce composition play a central role in generating differences in wages across firms, as discussed above.  \n\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 outlines the model and its sectoral equilibrium. Section 3 presents our results on sectoral wage inequality. Section 4 presents our results on sectoral unemployment, and Section 5 extends our analysis to incorporate observable ex ante heterogeneity between multiple types of workers. Section 6 examines alternative ways of closing the model in general equilibrium. Section 7 concludes. The online Technical Appendix (Helpman, Itskhoki, and Redding (2010)) contains technical details, including proofs of propositions and other results.  \n\n## 2. SECTORAL EQUILIBRIUM  \n\nThe key predictions of our model relate to the distribution of wages and employment across firms and workers within a sector. In this section, we derive these distributions from comparisons across firms that hold in sectoral equilibrium for any value of a worker's expected income outside the sector, that is, his outside option. An important implication of this result is that the model's predictions for sectoral equilibrium hold regardless of general equilibrium effects. Throughout this section, all prices, revenues, and costs are measured in terms of a numeraire, where the choice of this numeraire is specified when we embed the sector in general equilibrium.  \n\n### 2.1. Model Setup  \n\nWe consider a world of two countries, home and foreign, where foreign variables are denoted by an asterisk. In each country there is a continuum of workers who are ex ante identical. Initially, we assume workers are risk neutral, but we consider risk aversion in Section 6. Demand within the sector is defined over the consumption of a continuum of horizontally differentiated varieties and takes the constant elasticity of substitution (CES) form. The real consumption index for the sector $(Q)$ is therefore defined as  \n\n$$\nQ=\\left[\\int_{j\\in J}q(j)^{\\beta}d j\\right]^{1/\\beta},\\quad0<\\beta<1,\n$$  \n\nwhere $j$ indexes varieties, $J$ is the set of varieties within the sector, $q(j)$ denotes consumption of variety $j_{:}$ , and $\\beta$ controls the elasticity of substitution between varieties. To simplify notation, we suppress the sector subscript except where important, and while we display expressions for home, analogous relationships hold for foreign. The price index dual to $Q$ is denoted by $P$ and depends on the prices $p(j)$ of individual varieties $j$ . Given this specification of sectoral demand, the equilibrium revenue of a firm is  \n\n$$\nr(j)=p(j)q(j)=A q(j)^{\\beta},\n$$  \n\nwhere $A$ is a demand shifter for the sector.7 Each firm takes the demand shifter as given when making its decisions, because it supplies one of a continuum of varieties within the sector and is, therefore, of measure zero relative to the sector as a whole. In this section we show how $A$ is determined in sectoral equilibrium, and we show in Section 6 how it is related to prices and expenditures in general equilibrium.  \n\nThe product market is modelled in the same way as in Melitz (2003). There is a competitive fringe of potential firms that can choose to enter the differentiated sector by paying an entry cost of $f_{e}>0$ . Once a firm incurs the sunk entry cost, it observes its productivity $\\theta$ , which is independently distributed and drawn from a Pareto distribution $G_{\\theta}(\\theta)=1-(\\theta_{\\mathrm{min}}/\\theta)^{z}$ for $\\theta\\geq\\theta_{\\mathrm{min}}>0$ and $z>1$ . The Pareto distribution is not only tractable, but together with our other assumptions implies a Pareto firm-size distribution, which provides a reasonable approximation to observed data (see Axtell (2001)). Since in equilibrium  \n\n7As is well known, the demand function for a variety $j$ can be expressed as  \n\n$$\nq(j)=A^{1/(1-\\beta)}p(j)^{-1/(1-\\beta)},\\quad\\mathrm{where}\\quad A=E^{1-\\beta}P^{\\beta}\n$$  \n\nnd $E$ is total expenditure on varieties within the sector, while $P$ is the sector's ideal price index.  \n\nall firms with the same productivity behave symmetrically, we index firms by $\\theta$ from now onward.  \n\nOnce firms observe their productivity, they decide whether to exit, produce solely for the domestic market, or produce for both the domestic and export markets. Production involves a fixed cost of $f_{d}>0$ units of the numeraire. Similarly, exporting involves a fixed cost of $f_{x}>0$ units of the numeraire and an iceberg variable trade cost, such that $\\tau>1$ units of a variety must be exported for one unit to arrive in the foreign market.  \n\nOutput of each variety. $(y)$ depends on the productivity of the firm $\\left(\\theta\\right)$ ,the measure of workers hired $(h)$ , and the average ability of these workers $\\left(\\Bar{a}\\right)$  \n\n$$\ny=\\theta h^{\\gamma}\\bar{a},\\quad0<\\gamma<1.\n$$  \n\nThis production technology can be interpreted as capturing either human capital complementarities (e.g., production in teams where the productivity of a worker depends on the average productivity of her team) or a managerial time constraint (e.g., a manager with a fixed amount of time who needs to allocate some time to each worker). In the Technical Appendix, we derive the production technology under each of these interpretations. A key feature of the production technology is complementarities in worker ability, where the productivity of a worker is increasing in the abilities of other workers employed by the firm.8  \n\nWorker ability is assumed to be independently distributed and drawn from a Pareto distribution, $G_{a}(a)=1-(a_{\\mathrm{min}}/a)^{k}$ for $a\\ge a_{\\mathrm{min}}>0$ and $k>1$ . Under our preferred interpretation, worker ability is match-specific and hence a worker's ability draw for a given match conveys no information about ability draws for other potential matches. The labor market is characterized by search and matching frictions which are modelled following the standard DiamondMortensen-Pissarides approach. A firm that pays a search cost of $b n$ units of the numeraire can randomly match with a measure $n$ of workers, where the search cost $^b$ is endogenously determined by the tightness of the labor market as discussed below.  \n\nConsistent with a large empirical literature in labor economics, we assume that worker ability cannot be costlessly observed when firms and workers are matched.? Instead, we assume that firms can undertake costly investments in worker screening to obtain an imprecise signal of worker ability, which is in line with a recent empirical literature on firm screening and other recruitment policies.10 To capture the idea of an imprecise signal in as tractable a way as possible, we assume that by paying a screening cost of $c a_{c}^{\\delta}/\\delta$ units of the numeraire, where $c>0$ and $\\delta>0$ , a firm can identify workers with an ability below $a_{c}$ 11 Screening costs are increasing in the ability threshold $a_{c}$ chosen by the firm, because more complex and costlier tests are required for higher ability cutoffs.12  \n\nThis specification of worker screening is influenced by empirical evidence that more productive firms not only employ more workers, but also screen more intensively, have workforces of higher average ability, and pay higher wages. Each of these features emerges naturally from our specification of production and screening, as demonstrated below, because production complementarities imply a greater return to screening for more productive firms and the screening technology is the same for all firms. Our formulation also ensures that the multilateral bargaining game between firms and workers over the surplus from production remains tractable. As the only information revealed by screening is which workers have match-specific abilities above and below $a_{c}$ neither the firm nor the workers know the match-specific abilities of individual workers, and hence bargaining occurs under conditions of symmetric information.  \n\nThe key feature of our analysis is not the precise formulation of screening. which is chosen partly for tractability, but the variation in workforce composition across firms after screening. Since more productive firms have workforces of higher average ability after screening, they pay higher wages as the outcome of the bargaining game. Other formulations in which more productive firms have workforces of higher average ability after screening would also generate the prediction that more productive firms pay higher bargained wages.  \n\n### 2.2. Firm's Problem  \n\nThe complementarities between workers’ abilities in the production technology provide the incentive for firms to screen workers. By screening and not employing workers with abilities less than $a_{c}$ , a firm reduces output (and hence revenue and profits) by decreasing the measure of workers hired $(h)$ , but raises output by increasing average worker ability $(\\bar{a})$ . Since there are diminishing returns to the measure of workers hired ( $\\overset{\\cdot}{0}<\\gamma<1$ ), output can be increased by  \n\n10For empirical evidence on the resources devoted by firms to the screening of job applicants, see, for example, Barron, Bishop, and Dunkelberg (1985), Barron, Black, and Loewenstein (1987), Pellizzari (2005), and Autor and Scarborough (2008).  \n\n1In this formulation, there is a fixed cost of screening, even when the screening is not informative, that is, when $a_{c}=a_{\\operatorname*{min}}$ . We focus on interior equilibria in which firms of all productivities choose screening tests that are informative, $a_{c}>a_{\\operatorname*{min}}$ , and so the fixed cost of screening is always incurred. As we show below, this is the case when the screening cost, $c$ , is sufficiently small.  \n\n12 Allresults generalize immediately to the case where the screening costs are separable in $a_{c}$ and $n$ ,and linear in $n$ , so that we can allow screening costs to rise with the measure of matched workers.  \n\nscreening as long as there is sufficient dispersion in worker ability (sufficiently low $k$ ).13 With a Pareto distribution of worker ability, a firm that chooses a screening threshold $a_{c}$ hires a measure $h=n(a_{\\mathrm{min}}/a_{c})^{k}$ of workers with average ability $\\bar{a}=k{{a}_{c}}/(k-1)$ . Therefore, the production technology can be rewritten as  \n\n$$\ny=\\kappa_{y}\\theta n^{\\gamma}a_{c}^{1-\\gamma k},\\kappa_{y}\\equiv\\frac{k}{k-1}a_{\\mathrm{min}}^{\\gamma k},\n$$  \n\nwhere we require $0<\\gamma k<1$ for a firm to have an incentive to screen.14  \n\nGiven consumer love of variety and a fixed production cost, no firm will ever serve the export market without also serving the domestic market. If a firm exports, it allocates its output $\\left(y(\\theta)\\right)$ between the domestic and export markets $(y_{d}(\\theta)$ and $y_{x}(\\theta)$ , respectively) to equate its marginal revenues in the two markets, which from (1) implies $[y_{x}(\\theta)/y_{d}(\\theta)]^{1-\\beta}=\\tau^{-\\beta}(A^{*}/A)$ . Therefore, a firm's total revenue can be expressed as  \n\n$$\nr(\\theta)\\equiv r_{d}(\\theta)+r_{x}(\\theta)=Y(\\theta)^{1-\\beta}A y(\\theta)^{\\beta},\n$$  \n\nwhere $r_{d}(\\theta)\\equiv A y_{d}(\\theta)^{\\beta}$ is revenue from domestic sales and $r_{x}(\\theta)\\equiv A^{*}[y_{x}(\\theta)/$ $\\tau]^{\\beta}$ is revenue from exporting. The variable $Y(\\theta)$ captures a firm's “market access,” which depends on whether it chooses to serve both the domestic and foreign markets or only the domestic market:  \n\n$$\nY(\\theta)\\equiv1+I_{x}(\\theta)\\tau^{-\\beta/(1-\\beta)}\\left(\\frac{A^{*}}{A}\\right)^{1/(1-\\beta)},\n$$  \n\nwhere $I_{x}(\\theta)$ is an indicator variable that equals 1 if the firm exports and 0   \nOtherwise.15  \n\n13Since production complementarities provide the incentive for firms to screen, the marginal product of workers with abilities below $a_{c}$ is negative for a firm with screening threshold $a_{c}$ ,as shown in the Technical Appendix. Note that in this production technology, the marginal product of a worker depends not only on his ability, but also on the ability of his co-workers. Therefore, a worker with a given ability can have a positive or negative marginal product, depending on the ability of his co-workers. While worker screening is a key feature of firms? recruitment policies, and production complementarities provide a tractable explanation for it, other explanations are also possible, such as fixed costs of maintaining an employment relationship (e.g., in terms of office space or other scarce resources).  \n\n$^{14}\\mathrm{In}$ contrast, when $\\gamma>1/k$ , no firm screens and the model reduces to the model of Helpman and Itskhoki (2010), which has no screening or ex post worker heterogeneity. We do not discuss this case here. While for simplicity, we assume a unit exponent on average ability in the production technology (2), a more general specification is $y=\\theta h^{\\gamma}\\bar{a}^{\\xi}$ , in which case the condition for firms to screen is $0<\\gamma<\\xi/k$  \n\n15Note that $[y_{x}(\\theta)/y_{d}(\\theta)]^{1-\\beta}=\\tau^{-\\beta}(A^{*}/A)$ and $y_{d}(\\theta)+y_{x}(\\theta)=y(\\theta)$ imply $y_{d}(\\theta)=y(\\theta)/Y(\\theta)$ and $y_{x}(\\theta)=y(\\theta)[Y(\\theta)-1]/Y(\\theta)$ , and hence $r_{d}(\\theta)=r(\\theta)/Y(\\theta)$ and $r_{x}(\\theta)=r(\\theta)[Y(\\theta)-$ $1]/Y(\\theta)$  \n\nAfter having observed its productivity, a firm chooses whether or not to produce, whether or not to export, the measure of workers to sample, and the screening ability threshold (and hence the measure of workers to hire). Once these decisions have been made, the firm and its hired workers engage in strategic bargaining with equal weights over the division of revenue from production in the manner proposed by Stole and Zwiebel (1996a, 1996b). The only information known by firms and workers at the bargaining stage is that each hired worker has an ability greater than $a_{c}$ . Therefore, the expected ability of each worker is $\\bar{a}=k/(k-1)a_{c}$ and each worker is treated as if they have an ability of $\\bar{a}$ . Combining (2) and (4), firm revenue can be written as $r=Y(\\theta)^{1-\\beta}{\\dot{A(\\theta\\bar{a})}}^{\\beta}h^{\\beta\\gamma}$ , which is continuous, increasing, and concave in $h$ .As the fixed production, and fixed exporting, search, and screening costs have all been sunk before the bargaining stage, all other arguments of firm revenue are fixed. Furthermore, the outside option of hired workers is unemployment, whose value we normalize to O. As a result, the solution to the bargaining game is that the firm receives the fraction $1/(1+\\beta\\gamma)$ of revenue (4), while each worker receives the fraction $\\beta\\gamma/(1+\\beta\\gamma)$ of average revenue per worker.16  \n\nAnticipating the outcome of the bargaining game, the firm maximizes its profits. Combining (3), (4), and (5), this profit maximization problem can be writtenas  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle\\pi(\\theta)\\equiv\\operatorname*{max}_{n\\ge0,0}\\bigg\\{\\frac{1}{1+\\beta\\gamma}\\bigg[1+I_{x}\\tau^{-\\beta/(1-\\beta)}\\bigg(\\frac{A^{*}}{A}\\bigg)^{1/(1-\\beta)}\\bigg]^{1-\\beta}}}\\ {{\\displaystyle I_{x}\\epsilon_{\\{0,1\\}}}}\\ {{\\displaystyle\\times A(\\kappa_{y}\\theta n^{\\gamma}a_{c}^{1-\\gamma k})^{\\beta}-b n-\\frac{c}{\\delta}a_{c}^{\\delta}-f_{d}-I_{x}f_{x}\\bigg\\}.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe firm's decision whether or not to produce and whether or not to export takes a standard form. The presence of a fixed production cost implies that there is a zero-profit cutoff for productivity, $\\theta_{d}$ , such that a firm drawing a productivity below $\\theta_{d}$ exits without producing. Similarly, the presence of a fixed exporting cost implies that there is an exporting cutoff for productivity, $\\theta_{x}$ ,such that a firm drawing a productivity below $\\theta_{x}$ does not find it profitable to serve the export market. Given that a large empirical literature finds evidence of selection into export markets, where only the most productive firms export, we focus on values of trade costs for which $\\theta_{x}>\\theta_{d}>\\theta_{\\operatorname*{min}}$ .17 The firm market access variable is, therefore, determined as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{Y(\\theta)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{1,\\quad}&{\\theta<\\theta_{x},}\\ {Y_{x},}&{\\theta\\geq\\theta_{x},}\\end{array}\\right.}\\ &{Y_{x}\\equiv1+\\tau^{-\\beta/(1-\\beta)}\\displaystyle\\left(\\frac{A^{*}}{A}\\right)^{1/(1-\\beta)}>1.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe firm's first-order conditions for the measure of workers sampled $(n)$ and the screening ability threshold $\\left(a_{c}\\right)$ are  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\beta\\gamma}{1+\\beta\\gamma}r(\\theta)=b n(\\theta),}\\ {\\displaystyle\\frac{\\beta(1-\\gamma k)}{1+\\beta\\gamma}r(\\theta)=c a_{c}(\\theta)^{\\delta}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThese conditions imply that firms with larger revenue sample more workers and screen to a higher ability threshold. While the measure of workers hired, $h=n(a_{\\mathrm{min}}/a_{c})^{k}$ , is increasing in the measure of workers sampled, $n$ , it is decreasing in the screening ability threshold, $a_{c}$ . Under the assumption $\\delta>k$ firms with larger revenue not only sample more workers, but also hire more workers. Finally, from the division of revenue in the bargaining game, the total wage bill is a constant share of revenue, which implies that firm wages are monotonically increasing in the screening ability cutoff:  \n\n$$\nw(\\theta)=\\frac{\\beta\\gamma}{1+\\beta\\gamma}\\frac{r(\\theta)}{h(\\theta)}=b\\frac{n(\\theta)}{h(\\theta)}=b{\\Bigg[\\frac{a_{c}(\\theta)}{a_{\\mathrm{min}}}\\Bigg]}^{k}.\n$$  \n\nBy adjusting employment, firms are able to push their bargained wage down to the replacement cost of a worker. As larger firms have workers of higher average ability, which are more costly to replace, they pay higher wages. Thus, firms with larger revenue have higher screening ability cutoffs and pay higher wages, but the expected wage conditional on being sampled is the same across all firms,  \n\n$$\n\\frac{w(\\theta)h(\\theta)}{n(\\theta)}=b,\n$$  \n\n17For empirical evidence of selection into export markets, see, for example, Bernard and Jensen (1995) and Roberts and Tybout (1997).  \n\nwhich implies that workers have no incentive to direct their search.18 Combining the measure of workers hired, $h=n(a_{\\mathrm{min}}/a_{c})^{k}$ , with the first-order conditions above yields the following relationship between firm wages and the measure of workers hired:  \n\n$$\n\\ln w(\\theta)=\\mathrm{constant}+\\frac{k}{\\delta-k}\\ln h(\\theta).\n$$  \n\nTherefore, under the assumption $\\delta>k$ , the model exhibits an employer-size wage premium, where firms that employ more workers pay higher wages. To match empirical findings of such an employer-size wage premium, we focus on parameter values satisfying this inequality.  \n\nUsing the firms' first-order conditions, firm revenue (4), and the production technology (3), we can solve explicitly for firm revenue as a function of firm productivity $\\left(\\theta\\right)$ , the demand shifter $(A)$ ,thesearchcost $(b)$ , and parameters:  \n\n$$\nr(\\theta)=\\kappa_{r}\\Bigl[c^{-\\beta(1-\\gamma k)/\\delta}b^{-\\beta\\gamma}Y(\\theta)^{(1-\\beta)}A\\theta^{\\beta}\\Bigr]^{1/T},\n$$  \n\nwhere ${\\Gamma}\\equiv1-\\beta\\gamma-\\beta(1-\\gamma k)/\\delta>0$ and the constant $\\kappa_{r}$ is defined in the Technical Appendix. An implication of this expression is that the relative revenues of any two firms depend solely on their relative productivities and relative market access: $r(\\theta^{\\prime})/r\\hat{(\\theta^{\\prime\\prime})}=(\\theta^{\\prime}\\dot{/\\theta^{\\prime\\prime}})^{\\beta/T}(Y(\\theta^{\\prime})/Y(\\hat{\\theta^{\\prime\\prime}}))^{\\beta/T}$  \n\nFinally, using the two first-order conditions in the firm's problem (6), firm profits can be expressed in terms of firm revenue and the fixed costs of produc. tion and exporting:  \n\n$$\n\\pi(\\theta)=\\frac{\\displaystyle{\\cal T}}{\\displaystyle1+\\beta\\gamma}r(\\theta)-f_{d}-I_{x}(\\theta)f_{x}.\n$$  \n\n### 2.3. Sectoral Variables  \n\nTo determine sectoral equilibrium, we use the recursive structure of the model. In a first block of equations, we solve for the tightness of the labor market $(x,x^{*})$ and search costs $(b,b^{*})$ in each country. In a second block of equations, we solve for the zero-profit productivity cutoffs $(\\theta_{d},\\theta_{d}^{*})$ , the exporting productivity cutoffs $(\\theta_{x},\\theta_{x}^{*})$ , and sectoral demand shifters $(A,A^{*})$ . A third and final block of equations, to be described in Section 6, determines the remaining components of the sector's variables: the dual price index $(P,P^{*})$ , the real consumption index $(Q,Q^{*})$ , the mass of firms $(M,M^{*})$ , and the size of the labor force $(L,L^{*})$  \n\n18 We note that search frictions and wage bargaining alone are not enough to generate wage variation across firms in our model. From the firm's first-order condition for the measure of workers sampled, each firm equates workers? share of revenue per sampled worker to the common search cost. In the special case of our model without worker heterogeneity and screening, all sampled workers are hired, which implies that each firm's wage is equal to the common search cost.  \n\n#### 2.3.1. Labor Market Tightness and Search Costs  \n\nFollowing the standard Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides approach,  the searchcost $(b)$ is assumed to be increasing in labor market tightness $(x)$  \n\n$$\nb=\\alpha_{0}x^{\\alpha_{1}},\\quad\\alpha_{0}>1,\\alpha_{1}>0,\n$$  \n\nwhere labor market tightness equals the ratio of workers sampled $(N)$ to workers searching for employment in the sector $(L)$ $x=N/L$ .19 Under the assumption of risk neutrality, the supply of workers searching for employment in the sector depends on their expected income outside the sector, that is, their outside option, $\\omega$ . In particular, workers are indifferent between searching for employment inside and outside the sector if their expected income in the sector, which equals the probability of being sampled $(x)$ times the expected wage conditional on being sampled $(w(\\theta)h(\\theta)/n(\\theta)=b$ from the analysis above), is equal to $\\omega$ ：  \n\n$$\n\\omega=x b.\n$$  \n\nWe discuss in Section 6 how this condition is modified when workers are risk averse. Together (10) and (11) determine the search cost and the labor market tightness $(b,x)$ for a given value of expected income $(\\omega)$  \n\n$$\nb=\\alpha_{0}^{1/(1+\\alpha_{1})}\\omega^{\\alpha_{1}/(1+\\alpha_{1})}\\quad\\mathrm{and}\\quad x=\\bigg(\\frac{\\omega}{\\alpha_{0}}\\bigg)^{1/(1+\\alpha_{1})},\n$$  \n\nwhere we assume $\\alpha_{0}>\\omega$ so that $0<x<1$ , as discussed in Section 6. Analogous relationships determine search costs and labor market tightness $(b^{*},x^{*})$ for a given value of expected income $\\left(\\omega^{*}\\right)$ in foreign. The search cost in (12) depends solely on parameters of the search technology $(\\alpha_{0},\\alpha_{1})$ and expected income $(\\omega)$ . In particular, we can make the following statement.  \n\nLEMMA 1: The search cost b and the measure of labor market tightness $x$ are both increasing in expectedworker income $\\omega$  \n\nWhen we subsequently embed the sector in general equilibrium, we specify conditions under which expected worker income $(\\omega)$ is constant and conditions under which it changes with the other endogenous variables of the model.  \n\n#### 2.3.2. Productivity Cutoffs and Demand  \n\nThe two productivity cutoffs can be determined using firm revenue (8) and profits (9). The productivity cutoff below which firms exit $\\left(\\theta_{d}\\right)$ is determined by the requirement that a firm with this productivity makes zero profits:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\varGamma}{1+\\beta\\gamma}\\kappa_{r}\\Bigl[c^{-\\beta(1-\\gamma k)/\\delta}b^{-\\beta\\gamma}A\\theta_{d}^{\\beta}\\Bigr]^{1/\\Gamma}=f_{d}.\n$$  \n\nSimilarly, the exporting productivity cutoff above which firms export $\\left(\\theta_{x}\\right)$ is determined by the requirement that at this productivity a firm is indifferent between serving only the domestic market and serving both the domestic and foreign markets:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\d{}}{\\d{}1+\\beta\\gamma}\\kappa_{r}\\Big[c^{-\\beta(1-\\gamma k)/\\delta}b^{-\\beta\\gamma}A\\theta_{x}^{\\beta}\\Big]^{1/T}\\Big[Y_{x}^{(1-\\beta)/T}-1\\Big]=f_{x}.\n$$  \n\nThese two conditions imply the following relationship between the productivity cutoffs:  \n\n$$\n\\left[Y_{x}^{\\left(1-\\beta\\right)/{T}}-1\\right]\\left(\\frac{\\theta_{x}}{\\theta_{d}}\\right)^{\\beta/{T}}=\\frac{f_{x}}{f_{d}}.\n$$  \n\nIn equilibrium, we also require the free entry condition to hold, which equates the expected value of entry to the sunk entry cost. Using the zero-profit and exporting cutoff conditions, (13) and (14), respectively, and the relationship between revenues for firms with different productivities from (8), the free entry condition can be written as  \n\n$$\nf_{d}\\int_{\\theta_{d}}^{\\infty}\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta_{d}}\\right)^{\\beta/T}-1\\right]d G_{\\theta}(\\theta)+f_{x}\\int_{\\theta_{x}}^{\\infty}\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta_{x}}\\right)^{\\beta/T}-1\\right]d G_{\\theta}(\\theta)=f_{e}.\n$$  \n\nEquations (13), (14), and (16) can be used to solve for home's productivity cutoffs and the demand shifter $(\\theta_{d},\\theta_{x},A)$ for a given value of the foreign demand shifter $(A^{*})$ , which only influences home sectoral equilibrium through exporter market access ( $(Y_{x}>1)$ .2° Three analogous equations can be used to solve for foreign variables $(\\theta_{d}^{*},\\theta_{x}^{*},A^{*})$ for a given value of $A$ . Together these six equations allow us to solve for the productivity cutoffs and demand shifters in the two countries $(\\theta_{d},\\theta_{x},A,\\theta_{d}^{*},\\theta_{x}^{*},A^{*})$ for given values of search costs $(b,b^{*})$ ， which were determined in the previous block of equations. Having solved for the productivity cutoffs and demand shifters, firm market access in each country $(Y(\\theta),Y^{*}(\\theta))$ follows immediately from (5).  \n\nThe productivity cutoffs and demand shifter depend on two dimensions of trade openness in (13), (14), and (16). First, they depend on an extensive margin of trade openness, as captured by the ratio of the productivity cutoffs $\\rho\\equiv\\theta_{d}/\\theta_{x}\\in[0,1].$ , which determines the fraction of exporting firms $[1-G_{\\theta}(\\theta_{x})]/[1-G_{\\theta}(\\theta_{d})]=\\rho^{z}$ . Second, they depend on an intensive margin of trade openness, as captured by the market access variable, $\\boldsymbol{Y_{x}}>1$ ,which determines the ratio of revenues from domestic sales and exporting, as discussed in footnote 15. These two dimensions of trade openness are linked through the relationship between the productivity cutoffs (15).  \n\n### 2.4. Firm-Specific Variables  \n\nIn this section, we use the solutions for sectoral equilibrium to solve for firmspecific variables. We show that the model's predictions for firm-specific variables are consistent with empirically observed relationships between wages, employment, workforce composition, productivity, and export participation. To solve for firm-specific variables, we use two properties of the model. First, from firm revenue (8), the relative revenue of any two firms depends solely on their relative productivities and relative market access. Second, from firm profits (9), the lowest productivity firm with productivity $\\theta_{d}$ makes zero profits. Combining these two properties with the firm's first-order conditions above allows all firm-specific variables to be written as functions of firm productivity $\\left(\\theta\\right)$ , firm market access $\\left(Y(\\theta)\\right)$ , the zero-profit productivity cutoff $\\left(\\theta_{d}\\right)$ ,search costs $(b)$ , and parameters,  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{r(\\theta)=Y(\\theta)^{(1-\\beta)/r}\\cdot r_{d}\\cdot\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta_{d}}\\right)^{\\beta/r},~r_{d}=\\frac{1+\\beta}{T}}}\\ {{}}\\ {{h(\\theta)=Y(\\theta)^{(1-\\beta)(1-\\beta)/r}\\cdot h_{d}\\cdot\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta_{d}}\\right)^{\\beta(1-k/\\delta)/r},}}\\ {{}}\\ {{h_{d}=\\frac{\\beta}{T}\\frac{f_{d}}{b}\\bigg[\\frac{\\beta(1-\\gamma k)}{T}\\frac{f_{d}}{c a_{\\mathrm{min}}^{\\beta}}\\bigg]^{-k/\\delta},}}\\ {{}}\\ {{w(\\theta)=Y(\\theta)^{k(1-\\beta)/\\delta r}\\cdot w_{d}\\cdot\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta_{d}}\\right)^{\\beta/\\delta/\\delta r},}}\\ {{}}\\ {{w_{d}=b\\bigg[\\frac{\\beta(1-\\gamma k)}{T}\\frac{f_{d}}{c a_{\\mathrm{min}}^{\\beta}}\\bigg]^{k/\\delta},}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere market access $\\left(Y(\\theta)\\right)$ is determined as a function of firm productivity in (7). Combining these expressions with the Pareto productivity distribution, firm revenue and employment are also Pareto distributed, with shape parameters that depend on the dispersion of firm productivity, the dispersion of worker ability, and product and labor market parameters that influence workforce composition.21  \n\n![](images/883f5cb7ee3c6d4f26fc0d6bfca8e7c7035e1fb4d7203358e2aba2e761c901bb.jpg)  \nFIGURE 1.—-Wages as a function of firm productivity.  \n\nFrom the firm-specific solutions (17), more productive firms not only have higher revenue, profits, and employment, as in the benchmark model of firm heterogeneity of Melitz (2003), but also pay higher wages as shown in Figure 1. These results are consistent with empirical evidence on rent sharing, whereby higher firm revenue and profits are shared with workers through higher wages (e.g., Van Reenen (1996)), and with the large empirical literature that finds an employer-size wage premium (see the survey by Oi and Idson (1999)).  \n\nAdditionally, the differences in wages across firms are driven by differences in workforce composition. More productive firms have workforces of higher average ability, which are more costly to replace in the bargaining game, and, therefore, they pay higher wages. These features of the model are consistent with empirical findings that the employer-size wage premium is in part explained by differences in the unobserved characteristics of workers across firms.22 The reason more productive firms have workforces of higher average ability in the model is that they screen more intensively, which also receives empirical support. An emerging literature on firm recruitment policies provides evidence of more intensive screening policies for larger firms and higher-wage matches.23  \n\nFinally, firm characteristics are systematically related to export participation in the model. As a result of fixed costs of exporting, there is a discrete increase in firm revenue at the productivity threshold for entry into exporting $\\left(\\theta_{x}\\right)$ ,where $Y(\\theta)$ increases from 1 to $\\boldsymbol{Y_{x}}>1$ , which implies a discrete increase in all other firm variables except for profits. Therefore, exporters not only have higher revenue and employment than nonexporters, as in the benchmark model of firm heterogeneity of Melitz (2003), but also pay higher wages, as found empirically by Bernard and Jensen (1995, 1997). While exporting increases the wage paid by a firm with a given productivity, so that the model features an exporter wage premium conditional on firm productivity, it does not feature an exporter wage premium conditional on firm size, because both firm wages and firm size increase discretely at the productivity threshold for entry into export markets.24 The wage differences between exporters and nonexporters in the model are accompanied by differences in workforce composition, as found empirically by Schank, Schanbel, and Wagner (2007), Munch and Skaksen (2008), and Frias, Kaplan, and Verho0gen (2009).  \n\n## 3. SECTORAL WAGE INEQUALITY  \n\nWhile workers are ex ante identical and have the same expected income, there is ex post wage inequality because workers receive different wages depending on the employer with whom they are matched. In this section, we consider the within-sector distribution of wages across employed workers. This sectoral wage distribution is a weighted average of the distributions of wages for workers employed by domestic firms, $G_{w,d}(w)$ , and for workers employed by exporters, $G_{w,x}(w)$ , with weights equal to the shares of employment in the two groups of firms:  \n\n$$\nG_{w}(w)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{S_{h,d}G_{w,d}(w),}\\ {\\qquad\\mathrm{~for~}w_{d}\\le w\\le w_{d}/\\rho^{\\beta k/(\\delta T)},}\\ {S_{h,d},\\quad\\mathrm{~for~}w_{d}/\\rho^{\\beta k/(\\delta T)}\\le w\\le w_{d}Y_{x}^{k(1-\\beta)/(\\delta T)}/\\rho^{\\beta k/(\\delta T)},}\\ {S_{h,d}+(1-S_{h,d})G_{w,x}(w),}\\ {\\qquad\\quad\\mathrm{~for~}w\\ge w_{d}Y_{x}^{k(1-\\beta)/(\\delta T)}/\\rho^{\\beta k/(\\delta T)},}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\n23For example, Barron, Black, and Loewenstein (1987) found that expenditures on screening workers are positively and significantly related to employer size, while Pellizzari (2005) found that matches created through more intensive screening pay higher wages.  \n\n24One potential explanation for an exporter wage premium conditional on firm size emerges from the extension of our model (discussed below) to incorporate multiple types of workers with different observed characteristics. Differences in workforce composition across these types between exporters and nonexporters that are imperfectly controlled for in empirical studies can give rise to such an exporter wage premium conditional on firm size.  \n\nwhere $\\rho$ and $\\varUpsilon_{x}$ are the extensive and intensive margins of trade openness defined above, $w_{d}=w(\\theta_{d})$ is the wage paid by the least productive firm in (17), $w_{d}/\\rho^{k\\beta/(\\delta{\\cal{T}})}=w(\\theta_{x}^{-})$ is the wage paid by the most productive nonexporter, and $w_{d}Y_{x}^{k(1-\\beta)/(\\delta{\\cal T})}/\\rho^{k\\beta/(\\delta{\\cal T})}=w(\\theta_{x}^{+})$ is the wage paid by the least productive exporter. Note that $w_{d}$ depends solely on parameters and search costs $(b)$ , which in turn depend on expected worker income $(\\omega)$ . The share of workers employed by domestic firms, $S_{h,d}$ , can be evaluated using the Pareto productivity distribution and the solution for firm-specific variables (17) as  \n\n$$\nS_{h,d}=\\frac{1-\\rho^{z-\\beta(1-k/\\delta)/T}}{1+\\rho^{z-\\beta(1-k/\\delta)/T}[Y_{x}^{(1-\\beta)(1-k/\\delta)/T}-1]},\n$$  \n\nwhich depends on the extensive and intensive margins of trade openness.  \n\nThe distributions of wages across workers employed by domestic and exporting firms can also be derived from the solutions for firm-specific variables (17). Given that productivity is Pareto distributed, and both wages and employment are power functions of productivity, the distribution of wages across workers employed by domestic firms is a truncated Pareto distribution  \n\n$$\nG_{w,d}(w)=\\frac{1-\\left(\\frac{w_{d}}{w}\\right)^{1+1/\\mu}}{1-\\rho^{z-\\beta(1-k/\\delta)/I}}\\quad\\mathrm{for}\\quad w_{d}\\leq w\\leq w_{d}/\\rho^{k\\beta/(\\delta T)}.\n$$  \n\nSimilarly, the distribution of wages across workers employed by exporters, $G_{w,x}(w)$ , is an untruncated Pareto distribution  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{G_{w,x}(w)=1-\\bigg[\\frac{w_{d}}{w}Y_{x}^{k(1-\\beta)/(\\delta T)}\\rho^{-k\\beta/(\\delta T)}\\bigg]^{1+1/\\mu}}\\ &{\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad}\\ &{\\mathrm{for}\\quad w\\geq w_{d}{Y_{x}}^{k(1-\\beta)/(\\delta T)}/\\rho^{k\\beta/(\\delta T)}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe wage distributions for workers employed by domestic firms and by exporters have the same shape parameter, $1+1/\\mu$ ,where $\\mu$ is defined as  \n\n$$\n\\mu\\equiv\\frac{\\beta k/\\delta}{z T-\\beta},\\quad\\mathrm{where}\\quad{\\cal T}\\equiv1-\\beta\\gamma-\\frac{\\beta}{\\delta}(1-\\gamma k).\n$$  \n\nFor the mean and variance of the sectoral wage distribution to be finite, we require $0<\\mu<1$ and hence $z{\\cal{I}}>2\\beta$ , which is satisfied for sufficiently large $z$ (a not too dispersed productivity distribution).25 The dispersion of firm wages is systematically related to the dispersion of firm revenue in the model, because larger firms have workforces of higher average ability and hence pay higher wages. While this mechanism is more general than our distributional assumptions, the assumption of Pareto distributions of firm productivity and worker ability enables closed-form solutions for the wage distribution to be derived. While the log normal distribution is generally believed to provide a closer approximation to the empirical wage distribution, the Pareto distribution provides a close approximation for the upper tail.  \n\n### 3.1. Sectoral Wage Inequality in the Closed Economy  \n\nThe closed economy wage distribution can be obtained by considering the case of arbitrarily large values of trade costs, which imply $\\rho\\to0$ in (18). In the closed economy, the share of employment in domestic firms is equal to 1, and the sectoral wage distribution across workers employed by domestic firms is an untruncated Pareto distribution with lower limit $w_{d}$ and shape parameter $1+1/\\mu$ . Given an untruncated Pareto distribution, all scale-invariant measures of inequality, such as the coefficient of variation, the Gini coefficient, and the Theil index, depend solely on the distribution's shape parameter. None of these measures depends on the lower limit of the support of the wage distribution $(w_{d})$ , and they therefore do not depend on search costs $(b)$ and expected worker income $(\\omega)$ . While these variables affect the mean of the wage distribution, they do not affect its dispersion. An important implication of this result is that the model's predictions for wage inequality do not depend on the equilibrium value of expected worker income $(\\omega)$ and hence are robust to alternative ways of closing the model in general equilibrium.  \n\nPROPOsITION 1: In the closed economy, $\\mu$ is a sufficient statistic for sectoral wage inequality. In particular, (i) the coefficient of variation of wages is $\\mu/\\sqrt{1-\\mu^{2}}$ ; (ii) the Lorenz curve is represented by $s_{w}=1-(1-s_{h})^{1/(1+\\mu)}$ ,where $s_{h}$ is the fraction of workers and $s_{w}$ is the fraction of their wages when workers are ordered from low- to high-wage earners; (ii) the Gini coefficient is $\\mu/(2+\\mu)$ ; and (iv) the Theil index is $\\mu-\\ln(1+\\mu)$  \n\nThe existence of a sufficient statistic for wage inequality in the closed economy is more general than our model in the sense that it holds for a wider class of models in which firm wages and employment are power functions of productivity, and productivity is Pareto distributed. Together these features imply that the wage distribution in the closed economy is an untruncated Pareto distribution and, hence, the shape parameter of this distribution is a sufficient statistic for wage inequality. In our model, this shape parameter is linked to the underlying structural parameters of the model that influence workforce composition and, hence, enter the derived parameter $\\mu$ . Evidently, sectoral wage inequality is monotonically increasing in $\\mu$ (the lower the shape parameter of the wage distribution $1+1/\\mu$ , the greater the wage inequality).  \n\nPROPOsITION 2: In the closed economy, inequality in the sectoral distribution of wages is increasing in firm productivity dispersion (lower $z$ )andincreasingin worker ability dispersion(lower $k$ )ifandonlyif $z^{-1}+\\delta^{-1}+\\gamma>\\beta^{-1}$  \n\nSince more productive firms pay higher wages, greater dispersion in firm productivity (lower $z$ ) implies greater sectoral wage inequality. In contrast, greater dispersion in worker ability (lower $k$ ) has an ambiguous effect on sectoral wage inequality because of two counteracting forces. On the one hand, a reduction in $k$ increases relative employment in more productive firms (from (17)) that pay higher wages, which increases wage inequality. On the other hand, a reduction in $k$ decreases relative wages paid by more productive firms (from (17), which reduces wage inequality. When the parameter inequality in the proposition is satisfied, the change in relative employment dominates the change in relative wages, and greater dispersion in worker ability implies greater sectoral wage inequality.  \n\nThe model's prediction that sectoral wage inequality is closely linked to the dispersion of firm productivity receives empirical support. In particular, Davis and Haltiwanger (1991) showed that wage dispersion across plants within sectors accounts for a large share of overall wage dispersion and is responsible for more than one-third of the growth in overall wage dispersion in U.S. manufacturing between 1975 and 1986. Additionally, they found that between-plant wage dispersion is strongly related to between-plant size dispersion, which in our model is driven by productivity dispersion. Similarly, Faggio, Salvanes, and Van Reenen (2007) showed that a substantial component of the increase in individual wage inequality in the United Kingdom in recent decades has occurred between firms within sectors and is linked to increased productivity dispersion between firms within sectors.  \n\nWhile greater firm productivity dispersion (associated, for example, with innovations such as information and communication technologies (ICTs)) is one potential source of increased wage inequality in the model, another potential source is international trade as considered in the next section. Indeed, both greater firm productivity dispersion and international trade raise wage inequality through the same mechanism of greater dispersion in firm revenue and wages within industries, and both raise measured productivity at the industry level through reallocations of resources across firms.  \n\n### 3.2. Open versus Closed Economy  \n\nThe sectoral wage distribution in the open economy depends on the sufficient statistic for wage inequality in the closed economy $(\\mu)$ and the extensive and intensive measures of trade openness ( $\\mathrm{\\bf\\ddot{\\rho}}$ and $\\varUpsilon_{x}$ , respectively). In the two limiting cases where trade costs are sufficiently high that no firm exports $(\\rho=0)$ and trade costs are sufficiently low that all firms export $(\\rho=1)$ , the open economy wage distribution is an untruncated Pareto distribution with shape parameter $1+1/\\mu$ . From Proposition 1, all scale-invariant measures of inequality for an untruncated Pareto distribution depend solely on the distribution's shape parameter. Therefore, the same level of wage inequality exists in the open economy when all firms export as in the closed economy.  \n\nTo characterize sectoral wage inequality in the open economy when $0<\\rho<$ 1 (only some firms export), we compare the actual open economy wage distribution $(G_{w}(w))$ to a counterfactual wage distribution $\\left(G_{w}^{c}(w)\\right)$ . For the counterfactual wage distribution, we choose an untruncated Pareto distribution with the same shape parameter as the wage distribution in the closed economy $(1+1/\\mu)$ , but the same mean as the wage distribution in the open economy. An important feature of this counterfactual wage distribution is that it has the same level of inequality as the closed economy wage distribution. Therefore, if we show that there is more inequality with the open economy wage distribution than with the counterfactual wage distribution, this will imply that there is more wage inequality in the open economy than in the closed economy.  \n\nThe counterfactual wage distribution has two other important properties, as shown formally in the Technical Appendix. First, the lowest wage in the counterfactual wage distribution $(w_{d}^{c})$ lies strictly in between the lowest wage paid by domestic firms $(w_{d})$ and the lowest wage paid by exporters $\\left(w(\\theta_{x}^{+})\\right)$ in the actual open economy wage distribution. Otherwise, the counterfactual wage distribution would have a mean either lower or higher than the actual open economy wage distribution, which contradicts the requirement that the two distributions have the same mean. Second, the counterfactual wage distribution has a smaller slope than the actual wage distribution at $w(\\theta_{x}^{+})$ . Otherwise, the counterfactual wage distribution would have a greater density than the actual wage distribution for $w\\geq w(\\theta_{x}^{+})$ , and would, therefore, have a higher mean than the actual wage distribution.  \n\nTogether, these two properties imply that the relative location of the cumulative distribution functions for actual and counterfactual wages is as shown in Figure 2.26 The actual and counterfactual cumulative distributions intersect only once, and the actual distribution lies above the counterfactual distribution for low wages and below it for high wages.27 This pattern provides a sufficient condition for the counterfactual wage distribution to second-order stochastically dominate the wage distribution in the open economy. Therefore, for all measures of inequality that respect second-order stochastic dominance, the open economy wage distribution exhibits greater inequality than the counterfactual wage distribution. It follows that the wage distribution in the open economy exhibits more inequality than the wage distribution in the closed economy. This result holds independently of whether the opening of trade affects expected worker income $\\mathbf{\\Pi}(\\omega)$ ,because $\\omega$ affects the lower limit of the actual open economy wage distribution (and hence the lower limit of the counterfactual wage distribution), but does not affect the comparison of levels of inequality between the two distributions.  \n\n![](images/bb19197b5798d51565f86030d24b62c61c7286f09924d4cdbf5aa2b191639e92.jpg)  \nFIGURE 2.—Cumulative distribution function of wages.  \n\nPROPOsITION 3: (i) Sectoral wage inequality in the open economy when some but not all firms export is strictly greater than in the closed economy and (i) sectoral wage inequality in the open economy when all firms export is the same as in theclosedeconomy.  \n\nProposition 3 highlights a new mechanism for international trade to affect wage inequality that is absent from neoclassical trade theories such as the Heckscher-Ohlin model; namely, the participation of some but not all firms in exporting. This generic mechanism applies in any heterogeneous firm model in which firm wages are related to firm revenue and there is selection into export markets. As a result of this mechanism, Proposition 3 holds in models in which the following three conditions are satisfied: (i) firm wages and employment are power functions of firm productivity, (i) there is firm selection into export markets and exporting increases wages for a firm with a given productivity, and (iii) firm productivity is Pareto distributed.  \n\nAn important implication of Proposition 3, which applies for symmetric and asymmetric countries alike, is that the opening of trade can increase wage inequality in all countries. In contrast, the Stolper-Samuelson theorem of the Heckscher-Ohlin model predicts rising wage inequality in developed countries but falling wage inequality in developing countries. Proposition 3 is, therefore, consistent with empirical findings of increased wage inequality in developing countries following trade liberalization, as reviewed by Goldberg and Pavcnik (2007). Similarly, Proposition 3 is consistent with empirical evidence that much of the observed reallocation in the aftermath of trade liberalization occurs across firms within sectors and is accompanied by increases in within-group wage inequality.28  \n\nSince sectoral wage inequality when all firms export is the same as in the closed economy, but sectoral wage inequality when only some firms export is higher than in the closed economy, the relationship between sectoral wage inequality and the fraction of exporters is at first increasing and later decreasing.  \n\nCOROLLARY TO PROPOsITION 3: An increase in the fraction of exporting firms raises sectoral wage inequality when the fraction of exporting firms is sufficiently small and reduces sectoral wage inequality when the fraction of exporting firms is sufficiently large.  \n\nThe intuition for this result is that the increase in firm wages that occurs at the productivity threshold above which firms export is present only when some, but not all, firms export. When no firm exports $(\\rho=0)$ , a small reduction in trade costs that induces some firms to start exporting raises sectoral wage inequality because of the higher wages paid by exporters. When all firms export( $(\\rho=1)$ , a small increase in trade costs that induces some firms to stop exporting raises sectoral wage inequality because of the lower wages paid by domestic firms. Furthermore, as the proof follows from that for Proposition 3 above, this corollary holds for any measure of wage inequality that respects second-order stochastic dominance and for asymmetric countries. One important implication of these results is that the initial level of trade openness is a relevant control for empirical studies examining the relationship between wage inequality and trade.  \n\nOur closed-form expression for the wage distribution (18) in terms of the extensive and intensive margins of trade openness ( $\\overset{\\cdot}{\\boldsymbol{\\rho}}$ and $\\boldsymbol{Y_{x}}$ , respectively) holds both in the extreme cases of autarky and frictionless trade, as well as in a trade equilibrium where only a fraction of firms export. While both fixed and variable trade costs influence sectoral wage inequality, they do so through slightly different mechanisms, because they have different effects on $\\rho$ and $\\varUpsilon_{x}$ . This can be seen most clearly for symmetric countries, where the intensive margin depends on variable trade costs alone ( $\\begin{array}{r}{Y_{x}=1+\\tau^{-\\beta/(1-\\beta)}\\big)}\\end{array}$ , and changes in the fixed costs of exporting affect only the extensive margin $(\\rho)$ . To illustrate the relationship between sectoral wage inequality and trade openness in the model, Figure 3 graphs the variation in the Theil index of wage inequality with symmetric countries as we vary the fixed cost of exporting $(f_{x})$ and hence the extensive margin of trade openness $(\\rho)$ . A similar pattern of at first increasing and then later decreasing wage inequality can emerge as we vary variable tradecosts $(\\tau)$ . While we have not been able to show analytically that the relationship between wage inequality and the fraction of exporting firms is single peaked, as shown in Figure 3, this pattern emerged from all of our simulations of the model for a wide range of different parameter configurations.  \n\n![](images/a886c114f63fad41ffc3edd8ebf9b8a3639991fa77058ed3c58f8b847b7271ee.jpg)  \nFIGURE 3.——Trade openness and sectoral wage inequality.  \n\nIn our framework, the relationship between firm wages and revenue arises from differences in average worker ability across firms. As the opening of trade changes the dispersion of firm revenue, this in turn changes the dispersion of average worker ability across firms and, hence, changes the dispersion of wages.  \n\nPROPOsITION 4: The opening of the closed economy to trade amplifies differences in workforce composition across firms.  \n\nAs a result of the opening of trade, the revenue of exporters increases, which induces them to screen more intensively, while the revenue of domestic firms decreases, which induces them to screen less intensively. Hence a worker with a given ability who would be hired by a high productivity firm in the closed economy may not be hired by this firm in the open economy if it becomes an exporter. The opening of trade, therefore, strengthens the correlation between firm productivity and average worker ability, which echoes the empirical findings of greater wage and skill upgrading at more productive exporting firms in Verhoogen (2008). To the extent that empirical measures of productivity do not adequately control for worker ability, changes in average worker ability are reflected in changes in measured firm productivity. As the opening of trade amplifies differences in workforce composition across firms, it, therefore, also magnifies differences in measured firm productivity.  \n\n## 4. SECTORAL UNEMPLOYMENT  \n\nIn the model workers can be unemployed either because they are not matched with a firm or because their match-specific ability draw is below the screening threshold of the firm with which they are matched. Both components of unemployment are frictional in the sense that workers cannot immediately achieve another match. The sectoral unemployment rate $u$ includes both of these components and can be written as 1 minus the product of the hiring rate $\\sigma$ and the tightness of the labor market $x$  \n\n$$\nu=\\frac{L-H}{L}=1-\\frac{H}{N}\\frac{N}{L}=1-\\sigma x,\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\sigma\\equiv H/N,H$ is the measure of hired workers, $N$ is the measure of matched workers, and $L$ is the measure of workers seeking employment in the sector.  \n\nThe sectoral tightness of the labor market $(x)$ in (12) depends on the search friction parameter $\\left(\\alpha_{0}\\right)$ and expected worker income $(\\omega)$ . Therefore, the tightness of the labor market is not directly affected by trade openness and is only indirectly affected insofar as trade openness influences $\\omega$ . In contrast, the sectoral hiring rate $(\\sigma)$ depends directly on trade openness, which influences firm revenues and hence screening ability thresholds. Using the Pareto productivity distribution, the sectoral hiring rate can be expressed as a function of the extensive and intensive margins of trade openness ( $\\mathrm{\\bf\\ddot{\\rho}}$ and $Y_{x}$ , respectively), the suffcient statistic for wage inequality $(\\mu)$ , and other parameters, as shown in the Technical Appendix:  \n\n$$\n\\sigma=\\varphi(\\rho,Y_{x})\\sigma^{A},\\quad\\sigma^{A}=\\frac{1}{1+\\mu}\\biggl[\\frac{\\displaystyle{\\cal T}}{\\displaystyle\\beta(1-\\gamma k)}\\frac{c a_{\\mathrm{min}}^{\\delta}}{f_{d}}\\biggr]^{k/\\delta},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\sigma^{A}$ is the hiring rate in autarky, the term in square brackets is the hiring rate of the least productive firm $\\left(h_{d}/n_{d}\\right)$ ,and  \n\n$$\n\\varphi(\\rho,Y_{x})\\equiv\\frac{1+[Y_{x}^{\\scriptscriptstyle(1-\\beta)(1-k/\\delta)/T}-1]\\rho^{z-\\beta(1-k/\\delta)/T}}{1+[Y_{x}^{\\scriptscriptstyle(1-\\beta)/T}-1]\\rho^{z-\\beta/T}}.\n$$  \n\nEvidently, we have $\\varphi(0,Y_{x})=1$ and $0<\\varphi(\\rho,Y_{x})<1$ for $0<\\rho\\leq1$ ,since $\\boldsymbol{Y_{x}}>$ 1 and $\\delta>k$  \n\nSearch and screening costs have quite different effects on the closed economy unemployment rate. For a given expected worker income, a rise in the search friction $\\alpha_{0}$ raises search costs $(b)$ , which reduces the sectoral tightness of the labor market $(x)$ and increases the sectoral unemployment rate. In contrast, as the screening cost $(c)$ increases, firms screen less intensively, which increases the sectoral hiring rate $(\\sigma)$ and thereby reduces the sectoral unemployment rate.  \n\nThe opening of the closed economy to trade affects the sectoral unemployment rate through two channels. The first channel is through expected worker income $(\\omega)$ and the tightness of the labor market $(x)$ . When we embed the sector in general equilibrium, we show that expected worker income can either remain constant or rise following the opening of trade. As a result, the tightness of the labor market is either unaffected by the opening of trade (as in Helpman and Itskhoki (2010)) or rises (as in Felbermayr, Prat, and Schmerer (2008), Felbermayr, Larch, and Lechthaler (2009)).  \n\nThe second channel is through the hiring rate $(\\sigma)$ , which depends on firms' screening decisions and is distinctive to our approach. As firms' screening decisions determine both firm wages and hiring rates, this second channel introduces a two-way dependence between wage inequality and unemployment. The opening of trade results in an expansion in the revenue of exporters and a contraction in the revenue of nonexporters, which changes industry composition toward more productive firms that screen more intensively. Therefore, the opening of trade reduces the hiring rate, which increases sectoral unemployment.  \n\nPROPOsITION 5: The opening of the closed economy to trade has an ambiguous overall effect on the sectoral unemployment rate: (a) The tightness of the labor market can either remain constant or rise following the opening of trade, which leaves unchanged or reduces the rate of unemployment. (b) The hiring rate is strictly lower in the open economy than in the closed economy, which raises the rateofunemployment.  \n\nWhile the model's predictions for the impact on sectoral wage inequality of the opening of the closed economy to trade are unambiguous irrespective of how expected worker income is determined in general equilibrium, its predictions for sectoral unemployment are ambiguous and depend on general equilibrium effects. This ambiguity of the results for unemployment is consistent with the absence of a clear empirical consensus on the relationship between trade and unemployment, as discussed, for example, in Davidson and Matusz (2009).  \n\nThe sectoral distribution of income depends on both the sectoral distribution of wages and the unemployment rate, where unemployed workers all receive the same income of zero. As the opening of trade raises wage inequality and has an ambiguous effect on unemployment, income and wage inequality can move in opposite directions in the model. Therefore, our framework highlights that conclusions based on wage inequality can be misleading if the ultimate concern is income inequality.  \n\n## 5. OBSERVABLE WORKER HETEROGENEITY  \n\nIn this section, we introduce ex ante heterogeneity across workers. We consider a setting in which there are multiple occupations and occupation-specific supplies of workers, where workers from one occupation cannot perform the tasks of workers from another occupation. There are observable differences in ex ante worker characteristics across the occupations, which introduces a distinction between within-group wage inequality (among workers with the same ex ante characteristics) and between-group wage inequality (across workers with different ex ante characteristics). Although, for expositional simplicity, we confine the discussion to two occupations only, it will become clear how the main specification can be generalized to any number of occupations.  \n\nTo demonstrate in a simple way the robustness of our results to the introduction of ex ante heterogeneity, we concentrate on a Cobb-Douglas production technology. We show that the opening of trade raises within-group wage inequality for each group of workers, whereas between-group wage inequality can rise or decline with trade. When between-group wage inequality declines, the rise of within-group wage inequality can dominate, so that overall wage inequality still rises. To illustrate the flexibility of our framework, we also briefy discuss at the end of this section some implications of technology-skill complementarity.  \n\n### 5.1. Main Specification  \n\nThere are two types of labor, $\\ell=1,2$ , with $h_{\\ell}$ denoting a firm's employment of labor of type $\\ell$ and $n_{\\ell}$ denoting a firm's measure of matches with labor of this type. Labor markets are occupation-specific and each one of them is similar to the labor market specified above. In particular, search and matching occurs separately for every occupation. We allow the expected income of a type- $\\ell$ worker $\\omega_{\\ell}$ , the resulting hiring costs $b_{\\ell}$ , and tightness in the labor market $x_{\\ell}$ to vary across occupations. The ability of every group is Pareto distributed with shape parameter $k_{\\ell}$ and lower bound $a_{\\mathrm{min}\\ell}$  \n\nThe generalized production function is  \n\n$$\ny=\\theta(\\bar{a}_{1}h_{1}^{\\gamma_{1}})^{\\lambda_{1}}(\\bar{a}_{2}h_{2}^{\\gamma_{2}})^{\\lambda_{2}},\\lambda_{1}+\\lambda_{2}=1.\n$$  \n\nThis is a Cobb-Douglas extension of the production function (2) that allows for two occupation-specific tasks (e.g., engineers and managers). As before, the revenue function is $r=A y^{\\beta}$ for nonexporting firms and $\\overset{\\cdot}{r}=\\overset{\\cdot}{Y_{x}^{1-\\beta}}A y^{\\beta}$ for exporting firms. The wage rates are determined in a Stole-Zwiebel bargaining game. This results in a wage bill for every type of worker which is a constant fraction of revenue,29  \n\n$$\nw_{\\ell}h_{\\ell}=\\frac{\\beta\\gamma_{\\ell}}{1+\\beta\\bar{\\gamma}}\\lambda_{\\ell}r\\quad\\mathrm{for}\\quad\\ell=1,2,\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\bar{\\gamma}\\equiv\\lambda_{1}\\gamma_{1}+\\lambda_{2}\\gamma_{2}$ . Therefore, the problem of the firm, which is a generalization of (6), yields the following wage and employment schedules for the two occupational groups (see the Technical Appendix for details)30:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle h_{\\ell}(\\theta)=h_{d\\ell}Y(\\theta)^{(1-\\beta)(1-k_{\\ell}/\\delta)/T}\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta_{d}}\\right)^{\\beta(1-k_{\\ell}/\\delta)/T}},}\\ {{\\displaystyle w_{\\ell}(\\theta)=w_{d\\ell}Y(\\theta)^{k_{\\ell}(1-\\beta)/(\\delta T)}\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta_{d}}\\right)^{\\beta k_{\\ell}/(\\delta T)}},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere now  \n\n$$\n{\\cal T}\\equiv1-\\beta\\bar{\\gamma}-\\frac{\\beta}{\\delta}[1-(\\lambda_{1}\\gamma_{1}k_{1}+\\lambda_{2}\\gamma_{2}k_{2})].\n$$  \n\nWe next use this generalized solution to discuss wage dispersion within firms, and wage inequality within and between groups.  \n\nIt is evident from the equations for the firm-specific variables above that employment and wages are rising with firm productivity in every occupation (provided that $k_{\\ell}<\\delta$ for both groups). However, the relative wage bills of the two types of workers are the same in every firm. Under these circumstances, relative wages are inversely proportional to relative employment across firms. In particular, we have  \n\n$$\n\\frac{h_{1}(\\theta)}{h_{2}(\\theta)}=\\frac{h_{d1}}{h_{d2}}Y(\\theta)^{(1-\\beta)(k_{2}-k_{1})/(\\delta T)}\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta_{d}}\\right)^{\\beta(k_{2}-k_{1})/(\\delta T)}\n$$  \n\n29This results from asolutiontothe systm of diferential quations $\\partial(r-w_{1}h_{1}-w_{2}h_{2})/\\partial h_{\\ell}=$ $w_{\\ell}$ for $\\ell=1$ , 2. See the Technical Appendix for details.  \n\n30The constants $h_{d\\ell}$ and $w_{d\\ell}$ $\\ell=1,2$ ) are generalizations of those provided in equation (17) for the baseline model without ex ante heterogeneity. They are  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{w_{d\\ell}\\equiv b_{\\ell}\\bigg[\\frac{\\lambda_{\\ell}\\beta(1-\\gamma_{\\ell}k_{\\ell})}{{\\cal T}}\\frac{f_{d}}{c a_{\\mathrm{min}\\ell}^{\\delta}}\\bigg]^{k_{\\ell}/\\delta},}\\ &{h_{d\\ell}\\equiv\\frac{\\lambda_{\\ell}\\beta\\gamma_{\\ell}}{{\\cal T}}\\frac{f_{d}}{b_{\\ell}}\\bigg[\\frac{\\lambda_{\\ell}\\beta(1-\\gamma_{\\ell}k_{\\ell})}{{\\cal T}}\\frac{f_{d}}{c a_{\\mathrm{min}\\ell}^{\\delta}}\\bigg]^{-k_{\\ell}/\\delta}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n\\frac{w_{1}(\\theta)}{w_{2}(\\theta)}=\\frac{w_{d1}}{w_{d2}}Y(\\theta)^{(1-\\beta)(k_{1}-k_{2})/(\\delta T)}\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta_{d}}\\right)^{\\beta(k_{1}-k_{2})/(\\delta T)}.\n$$  \n\nIt follows that more productive firms employ relatively more of type-1 workers if and only if $k_{1}<k_{2}$ , that is, if and only if the ability of type-1 workers is more dispersed than the ability of type-2 workers. In what follows, we assume this to be the case. Under these circumstances, more productive firms pay relatively higher wages to type-2 workers.31 The intuition for this relationship between relative wages and employment across firms of different productivities is as follows. Since more productive firms employ relatively more of type-1 workers, this weakens their bargaining position relative to type-2 workers, and hence more productive firms pay relatively higher wages to type-2 workers.  \n\nNote that the occupation-specific degree of decreasing returns $\\gamma_{\\ell}$ only affects the relative wages and employment of firms through the composite derived parameter $\\varGamma$ . Note also that the relationship between relative wages and employment across firms of different productivities does not depend on the levels of human capital of workers in each group. High human capital of workers in group $\\ell$ (high $a_{\\mathrm{min}\\ell}$ ) only affects relative employment and wages of the two groups through the cutoffs $h_{d\\ell}$ and $w_{d\\ell}$ , which are common to all firms.  \n\n#### 5.1.1. Within-Group Inequality  \n\nWe can use the above solutions to calculate the distribution of wages within every occupation, as described in Section 3. As before, the distribution of wages within an occupation is an untruncated Pareto in the closed economy. This distribution now has an occupation-specific shape parameter $1+1/\\mu_{\\ell}$ ,where $\\mu_{\\ell}=\\beta k_{\\ell}/[\\delta(z T-\\beta)]$ . It follows that $k_{1}<k_{2}$ implies $\\mu_{1}<\\mu_{2}$ , so that there is more wage dispersion in group 2. Group 1 has a steeper employment schedule, but a flatter wage schedule across firms. The second effect dominates, leading to less wage inequality within group 1.  \n\nAs in Section 3, the open economy wage distribution within an occupation has two components: a truncated Pareto among workers employed by firms that serve only the domestic market and an untruncated Pareto among workers employed by exporters, with $1+1/\\mu_{\\ell}$ being the common shape parameter of these distributions. As a result, we can use the same method as in Section 3 to prove that within every occupation, there is more wage inequality in the trade regime than in autarky, as long as some, but not all, firms export (see Proposition 3). Similarly, within every occupation, wage inequality rises with trade openness initially and later declines (see Corollary to Proposition 3). Therefore our results for within-group inequality naturally generalize to the case of multiple occupations with ex ante differences in worker characteristics across occupations.  \n\n#### 5.1.2. Between-Group Inequality  \n\nNext consider the impact of trade on wage inequality across occupations. Average wages for an occupation are given by32  \n\n$$\n\\bar{w}_{\\ell}=(1+\\mu_{\\ell})w_{d\\ell}\\cdot\\frac{1+\\rho^{z-\\beta/T}[Y_{x}^{(1-\\beta)/T}-1]}{1+\\rho^{z-\\beta(1-k_{\\ell}/\\delta)/T}[Y_{x}^{(1-\\beta)(1-k_{\\ell}/\\delta)/T}-1]},\\quad\\ell=1,2.\n$$  \n\nIn the case where $k_{1}<k_{2}$ and expected worker income is unchanged as a result of the opening of trade, it is straightforward to show that trade causes the average wage in occupation 2 to rise relative to occupation 1 (i.e., $\\bar{w}_{2}/\\bar{w}_{1}$ increases).33 As discussed earlier, there are two effects of trade openness on the average wage for an occupation: the higher wages paid by exporting firms and the reallocation of employment toward high-wage exporting firms. The first effect is stronger for the high- $k_{\\ell}$ group, while the second effect is stronger for the low- $k_{\\ell}$ group. The first effect dominates and the relative average wage of the high- $k_{\\ell}$ occupation rises.  \n\nHow do these results affect between-group inequality? With two occupations, different measures of between-group inequality (including the Theil index and the Gini coefficient) achieve their minimum when $\\bar{w}_{2}/\\bar{w}_{1}=1$ , and inequality rises in $\\bar{w}_{2}/\\bar{w}_{1}$ if and only if $\\bar{w}_{2}>\\bar{w}_{1}$ . It follows that trade raises between-group inequality when $\\bar{w}_{2}>\\bar{w}_{1}$ in autarky. This occurs, for example, when $w_{d1}=w_{d2}$ , because $k_{1}<k_{2}$ implies $\\mu_{1}<\\mu_{2}$ . In contrast, trade reduces between-group inequality when $\\bar{w}_{1}>\\bar{w}_{2}$ in both autarky and the trade equilibrium. This happens when labor market tightness for group 1 is sufficiently larger than for group 2, so that $b_{1}/b_{2}$ and, hence, ${w_{d1}}/{w_{d2}}$ are sufficiently large, where $b_{1}/b_{2}$ depends on relative expected incomes for the two groups of workers $\\left(\\omega_{1}/\\omega_{2}\\right)$ . From this discussion, it is clear that between-group inequality can either rise or fall as a result of the opening to trade. But even if between-group inequality falls, its decline can be dominated by the rise in within-group inequality, so that the opening of trade raises overall wage inequality.  \n\nThis analysis of between-group inequality has so far abstracted from effects of trade on the relative expected incomes of the two groups of workers $\\left(\\omega_{1}/\\omega_{2}\\right)$ , as analyzed in the section on general equilibrium below. A movement in $\\omega_{1}/\\omega_{2}$ can, however, be a dominant force behind the change in betweengroup inequality by affecting $w_{d1}/w_{d2}$ through relative search costs $b_{1}/b_{2}$ .Our framework can be nested in a two-sector Heckscher-Ohlin model in which trade and the relative supply of the two types of workers determine the relative expected incomes of the two groups (see the Technical Appendix). In this specification, within-group inequality responds to trade according to Proposition 3 while the response of between-group inequality is shaped by the standard Stolper-Samuelson forces. Our predictions for within-group inequality are, therefore, robust to these extensions of our model to multifactor multisector environments.  \n\n### 5.2. Technology-Skill Complementarity  \n\nWhile the Cobb-Douglas production technology provides a tractable framework within which to demonstrate the robustness of our results to the introduction of ex ante heterogeneity, it implies that the relative wage bills of the two types of workers are constant across firms. This feature imposes a tight link between differences in ability dispersion between the two groups of workers, $k_{2}-k_{1}$ , and variation in the relative wages and employment of the two groups of workers across firms of different productivities. It, therefore, also imposes a tight link between $k_{2}-k_{1}$ and differences in wage dispersion between the two groups of workers. To break this tight link, the model can be generalized to a more fexible CES production technology34:  \n\n$$\ny=[\\lambda_{1}(\\theta_{1}\\bar{a}_{1}h_{1}^{\\gamma})^{\\nu}+\\lambda_{2}(\\theta_{2}\\bar{a}_{2}h_{2}^{\\gamma})^{\\nu}]^{{1}/{\\nu}},\\quad0<\\nu\\leq\\beta,\\lambda_{1}+\\lambda_{2}=1.\n$$  \n\nInterpreting $\\ell=1$ as skilled labor and $\\ell=2$ as unskilled labor, we can treat $\\theta_{1}=\\theta$ as the productivity level and set $\\theta_{2}\\equiv1$ . This specification exhibits technology-skill complementarity, which is a known feature of the data. To focus on this feature, we also assume $k_{1}=k_{2}=k$ . The limit $\\nu\\to0$ results in the Cobb-Douglas case studied above, while we have imposed $\\nu\\leq\\beta$ to insure that employment of both types of labor increases with firm productivity.  \n\nIn the Technical Appendix, we show that in this case, the Stole-Zwiebel bargaining game yields the equilibrium wages  \n\n$$\nw_{\\ell}h_{\\ell}=\\frac{\\beta\\gamma}{1+\\beta\\gamma}\\chi_{\\ell}r,\\quad\\chi_{\\ell}\\equiv\\frac{\\lambda_{\\ell}(\\theta_{\\ell}\\bar{a}_{\\ell}h_{\\ell}^{\\gamma})^{\\nu}}{\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=1}^{2}\\lambda_{j}(\\theta_{j}\\bar{a}_{j}h_{j}^{\\gamma})^{\\nu}},\\chi_{1}+\\chi_{2}\\equiv1.\n$$  \n\n34 Alternatively,to address this ssue, one can study a model where firms of different productivity choose different technologies which use the two types of labor with different intensities. We discuss this extension in the Technical Appendix.  \n\nAs before, the aggregate wage bill is a fraction $\\beta\\gamma/(1+\\beta\\gamma)$ of revenue $r$ and now the wage bill of input $\\ell$ is a fraction $\\chi_{\\ell}$ of the total wage bill. Using this wage structure, we show in the Technical Appendix that in this case, the solution to the firm's problem, which is a generalization of (6), yields  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\displaystyle\\frac{h_{1}(\\theta)}{h_{2}(\\theta)}=\\kappa_{h}\\theta^{(\\nu/\\Lambda)(1-k/\\delta)},}\\ &{\\displaystyle\\frac{w_{1}(\\theta)}{w_{2}(\\theta)}=\\kappa_{w}\\theta^{k\\nu/(\\delta A)},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\kappa_{h}$ and $\\kappa_{w}$ are constants that depend on parameters and the relative equilibrium search costs for the two groups of workers $\\left(b_{1}/b_{2}\\right)$ ,and $\\varLambda\\equiv1-$ $\\nu\\gamma-\\nu(1-\\gamma k)/\\delta>0.$ In words, more productive firms employ relatively more skilled workers and skilled workers are paid relatively more by more productive firms. That is, the share of group-1 workers in the total wage bill increases with firm productivity, in contrast to the constant share imposed by the Cobb-- Douglas specification.  \n\nAs in the single input case, we show in the Technical Appendix that more productive firms pay higher wages to both types of workers and they employ more workers of each type. More productive firms also select into exporting, and there is a discontinuous upward jump in revenue and, hence, wages and employment for each group of workers at the productivity cutoff $\\theta_{x}$ above which firms export. This jump in wages contributes to wage inequality in the trade equilibrium when not all firms export, although we cannot directly apply the arguments from Section 3 so as to extend Proposition 3 to this case.35  \n\nAn interesting special case arises when $\\nu=\\beta$ . In this case, all nonexporters pay the same wages to the unskilled workers and employ the same number of these workers, and, similarly, all exporters pay the same wages to the unskilled and employ the same number of these workers, except that exporters pay higher unskilled wages than nonexporters. Additionally, in this case, wages and employment of skilled workers are power functions of firm productivity $\\theta$ Therefore, Proposition 3 applies. It follows that in the closed economy, wage dispersion is greater for skilled workers than unskilled workers, and the opening of the closed economy to trade increases within-group wage inequality for both skilled and unskilled workers.  \n\n## 6. GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM  \n\nIn this section, we return to our benchmark model with a single type of worker and embed the sector in general equilibrium to determine expected workerincome $(\\omega)$ , prices, and aggregate income. We use this characterization of general equilibrium to examine the impact on worker welfare of opening the closed economy to trade.  \n\nIndividual workers in the differentiated sector experience idiosyncratic income risk as a result of the positive probability of unemployment and wage dispersion. We assume that preferences are defined over an aggregate consumption index $(\\mathcal{C})$ and exhibit constant relative risk aversion (CRRA):  \n\n$$\n\\mathbb{U}=\\frac{\\mathbb{E}\\mathcal{C}^{1-\\eta}}{1-\\eta},\\quad0\\leq\\eta<1,\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathbb{E}$ is the expectation operator. Expected indirect utility is therefore  \n\n$$\n\\mathbb{V}=\\frac{1}{1-\\eta}\\mathbb{E}\\bigg(\\frac{w}{\\mathcal{P}}\\bigg)^{1-\\eta},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathcal{P}$ is the price index of the aggregate consumption index $\\mathcal{C}$ . While we initially assume that workers are risk neutral $(\\eta=0)$ , we discuss the implications of introducing risk aversion below $(0<\\eta<1)$  \n\nTo demonstrate the robustness of our sectoral equilibrium results, we consider several approaches to embedding the sector in general equilibrium. First, we adopt a standard approach from international trade of introducing an outside good, which is homogeneous and produced without search frictions.36 This approach allows for the possibility that some sectors of the economy are best characterized by neoclassical assumptions and is particularly tractable. Expected worker income is pinned down by the wage in the outside sector as long as countries are incompletely specialized across sectors. As a result, the opening of trade leaves expected worker income unchanged as long as countries remain incompletely specialized.  \n\nSecond we consider a single-sector economy where expected worker income responds to the opening of trade. While the model's predictions for sectoral wage inequality are the same for both approaches to closing the model, the impact of opening the closed economy to trade on sectoral unemployment depends on what happens to expected worker income, as discussed above.  \n\n### 6.1. Expenditure, Mass of Firms, and the Labor Force  \n\nBefore considering the above two approaches to closing the model in general equilibrium, we first provide some additional conditions for sectoral equilibrium that can be used to solve for other sectoral variables of interest. While  \n\n36While we assume no search frictions in the outside sector, Helpman and Itskhoki (2010) showed in a model without worker heterogeneity or screening that introducing search frictions in the outside sector generates an expected income $\\omega_{0}$ that is independent of features of the differentiated sector. Augmenting the model here to incorporate search frictions in the outside sector would generate a similar result.  \n\nthese variables have not been needed for the analysis so far, they are used be.   \nlow when we embed the sector in general equilibrium.  \n\nRecall that the system of equilibrium conditions discussed in Section 2 allowed us to solve $(\\theta_{d},\\theta_{x},A,\\theta_{d}^{*},\\theta_{x}^{*},A^{*})$ for each differentiated product sector. From utility maximization across varieties within each sector, the demand shifter $(A)$ depends on total expenditure on the sector's varieties $(E)$ and the sector's ideal price index $(P)$ as $\\overset{\\cdot}{A}=E^{1-\\beta}P^{\\beta}$ . Additionally, utility maximization across sectors implies that total expenditure on the sector's varieties depends on the sectoral price indices and aggregate income $\\varOmega$ . Therefore, utility maximization implies that the demand shifter for each sector $i$ is a function of sectoral price indices and aggregate income:  \n\n$$\nA_{i}=\\tilde{A}_{i}({\\bf P},\\mathcal{Q}),\n$$  \n\nwhere the function $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{A}}(\\cdot)$ is derived from the structure of preferences, $\\mathbf{P}$ is a vector of sectoral price indexes $P_{i}$ ,and $\\varOmega$ is aggregate income. Given the sectoral demand shifters for each sector determined above, equation (23) for each sector provides a system of equations that can be used to solve for the sectoral price indices as a function of aggregate income.  \n\nNext consider a particular sector $i$ , for which we now have both $A_{i}$ and $P_{i}$ we now drop the subscript $i$ . In this sector, the real consumption index $(Q)$ follows from utility maximization across varieties, which implies  \n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{Q}=(\\boldsymbol{A}/P)^{1/(1-\\beta)}\n$$  \n\nand yields total expenditure within the sector $E=P Q$ .Similar relationships determine the foreign price index, real consumption index, and total expenditure within the sector $(P^{*},Q^{*},E^{*}$ ,respectively).  \n\nThe mass of firms within the sector $(M)$ can be determined from the market clearing condition that total domestic expenditure on differentiated varieties equals the sum of the revenues of domestic and foreign firms that supply varieties to the domestic market:  \n\n$$\nE=M\\int_{\\theta_{d}}^{\\infty}r_{d}(\\theta)d G_{\\theta}(\\theta)+M^{*}\\int_{\\theta_{x}^{*}}^{\\infty}r_{x}^{*}(\\theta)d G_{\\theta}(\\theta).\n$$  \n\nFrom $r_{d}(\\theta)=r(\\theta)/Y(\\theta)$ $r_{x}(\\theta)=r(\\theta)(Y(\\theta)-1)/Y(\\theta),^{3/2}$ and total firm revenue (8), domestic and foreign revenue can be expressed in terms of variables that have already been determined $\\left(\\theta_{d},\\theta_{x},Y(\\theta)\\right)$ . Therefore, we can solve for the mass of firms in each country $(M,M^{*})$ from (25) and a similar equation for foreign.  \n\n37See footnote 15.  \n\nThe mass of workers searching for employment in the sector $(L)$ canbe determined by noting that total labor payments are a constant fraction of total revenue from the solution to the bargaining game:  \n\n$$\n\\omega L=M\\int_{\\theta_{d}}^{\\infty}w(\\theta)h(\\theta)d G_{\\theta}(\\theta)=M\\frac{\\beta\\gamma}{1+\\beta\\gamma}\\int_{\\theta_{d}}^{\\infty}r(\\theta)d G_{\\theta}(\\theta),\n$$  \n\nwhere we have solved for the mass of firms $(M)$ and total firm revenue $\\left(r(\\theta)\\right)$ above, and where a similar equation determines the sectoral labor force in foreign $(L^{*})$ . Finally, we also require that the sectoral labor force is less than or equal to the supply of labor $(\\overset{\\cdot}{L}\\leq\\overset{\\cdot}{L})$ , as discussed below.  \n\n### 6.2. Economy With an Outside Sector  \n\nHaving solved for the remaining components of sectoral equilibrium, we now turn to our first approach to embedding the sector in general equilibrium. The aggregate consumption index $(\\mathcal{C})$ is defined over consumption of a homogeneous outside good $(q_{0})$ and a real consumption index of differentiated varieties $(Q)$  \n\n$$\n\\mathcal{C}=[\\vartheta^{1-\\zeta}q_{0}^{\\zeta}+(1-\\vartheta)^{1-\\zeta}Q^{\\zeta}]^{1/\\zeta},\\quad0<\\zeta<\\beta,\n$$  \n\nwhere $Q$ is modelled as in Section 2 and workers are assumed to be risk neutral. The parameter $\\vartheta$ determines the relative weight of the homogeneous and differentiated sectors in consumer preferences.38 While for simplicity we consider a single differentiated sector, the analysis generalizes in a straightforward way to the case of multiple differentiated sectors.  \n\nIn the homogeneous sector, the product market is perfectly competitive and there are no labor market frictions. In this sector, one unit of labor is required to produce one unit of output and there are no trade costs. Therefore, as we choose the homogeneous good as the numeraire ( $p_{0}=1,$ ), the wage in this sector is equal to 1 in both countries.  \n\nTo determine expected worker income in the differentiated sector, we use an indifference condition between sectors, which equates the expected utility of entering each sector in an equilibrium where both goods are produced. Under risk neutrality, this Harris-Todaro condition implies that expected worker income in the differentiated sector equals the certain wage of 1 in the homogeneous sector (see (11)),  \n\n$$\nx b=\\omega=1,\n$$  \n\n38 While in the analysis here we assume that workers have CRRA-CES preferences and experience income risk, Helpman, Itskhoki, and Redding (2008a, 2008b) considered an alternative specification with quasilinear preferences and income insurance within families.  \n\nwhere incomplete_specialization can be ensured by appropriate choice of labor endowments $(\\bar{L},\\bar{L}^{*})$ , and relative preferences for the homogeneous and differentiated goods $(\\vartheta)$ . Positive unemployment occurs in the differentiated sector for a sufficiently large search friction $\\alpha_{0}$ , such that $\\alpha_{0}>\\omega=1$ and, hence, $0<x<1$ in (12). Given an expected income of 1 in each sector, each country's aggregate income is equal to its labor endowment:  \n\n$$\n\\varOmega=\\bar{L}.\n$$  \n\nTo determine the price index in the differentiated sector $(P)$ ,weusethe functional relationship (23), which, with CES preferences between the homogeneous and differentiated sector, takes the form  \n\n$$\nA^{1/(1-\\beta)}=\\frac{(1-\\vartheta)P^{(\\beta-\\zeta)/((1-\\beta)(1-\\zeta))}\\varOmega}{\\vartheta+(1-\\vartheta)P^{-\\zeta/(1-\\zeta)}},\n$$  \n\nwhere the right-hand side is monotonically increasing in $P$ . Therefore, this relationship uniquely pins down $P$ given the demand shifter $(A)$ and aggregate income $(\\varOmega)$  \n\nTo determine general equilibrium, we use the conditions for sectoral equilibrium in Sections 2 and 6.1 (where (28) replaces (23)), and combine them with the Harris-Todaro condition (26) and aggregate income (27). Together these relationships determine the equilibrium vector $(x,b,\\theta_{d},\\theta_{x},A,Q,P,M,L$ $\\omega,\\varOmega)$ . The model has a recursive structure and the equilibrium vector is unique as shown in the Technical Appendix. Having determined this equilibrium vector, the price index $\\mathcal{P}$ dual to the aggregate consumption index $\\mathcal{C}-$ and consumption of the homogeneous good $q_{0}$ follow from CES demand. Finally, equilibrium employment in the homogeneous sector follows from labor market clearing $(L_{0}=\\stackrel{\\rightharpoonup}{L}-L$ , where incomplete specialization requires $L<\\bar{L}$ 一  \n\nHaving characterized general equilibrium, we are now in a position to examine the impact of the opening of trade on ex ante expected welfare. Note that differentiated sector workers receive the same expected indirect utility as workers in the homogeneous sector when both goods are produced:  \n\n$$\n\\mathbb{V}=\\frac{1}{\\mathcal{P}}\\quad\\mathrm{for}\\quad\\eta=0.\n$$  \n\nTherefore, the change in expected welfare as a result of the opening of trade depends solely on the change in the aggregate price index $(\\mathcal{P})$ , which, with our choice of numeraire, depends solely on the change in the price index for the differentiated sector $(P)$ . These comparative statics are straightforward to determine. From the free entry condition (16), the opening of trade raises the zero-profit productivity cutoff $\\left(\\theta_{d}\\right)$ . Using the Harris-Todaro condition (26) and labor market tightness (12), search costs $(b)$ remain constant as long as both goods are produced, because expected worker income equals 1. Therefore, from the zero-profit cutoff condition (13), the rise in $\\theta_{d}$ implies a lower value of the demand shifter $(A)$ . Given constant aggregate income $(\\varOmega)$ and a lower value of $A$ , CES demand (28) implies that the opening of trade reduces the price index for the differentiated sector $(P)$ , which implies higher expected welfare in the open economy than in the closed economy. We, therefore, can make the following statement.  \n\nPROPOSITION 6: Let $\\eta=0$ . Then in the two-sector economy, every worker's ex ante welfare is higher in the open economy than in the closed economy.  \n\nWith constant expected worker income $(\\omega)$ , labor market tightness $(x)$ is unchanged as a result of the opening of trade and, hence, the change in the sectoral unemployment rate $(u)$ depends solely on the change in the hiring rate $(\\sigma)$  \n\n### 6.3. Single-Sector Economy  \n\nWe now turn to our second approach to embedding the sector in general equilibrium. The aggregate consumption index $(\\mathcal{C})$ is defined over consumption of a continuum of horizontally differentiated varieties,  \n\n$$\n{\\mathcal{C}}=Q,\n$$  \n\nwhere $Q$ again takes the same form as in Section 2.  \n\nAll search, screening, fixed production, and fixed exporting costs are denominated in terms of the aggregate consumption index, which implies that these activities use the output of each differentiated variety in the same way as is demanded by final consumers. While for simplicity we again focus on a single differentiated sector, the analysis generalizes in a straightforward way to the case where the aggregate consumption index is defined over the consumption of many sectors, each of which contains a continuum of horizontally differentiated varieties.  \n\nTo determine general equilibrium, we follow the same approach as for sectoral equilibrium in Sections 2 and 6.1, where these equations now apply to the economy as a whole and we also solve for expected worker income $(\\omega)$ and aggregate income $(\\varOmega)$ . With a single sector, the analysis in Section 6.1 is slightly modified. Expenditure and the mass of firms in the two countries are determined by three equations for each country: total expenditure is the sum of expenditure on home and foreign varieties, total revenue is the sum of domestic expenditure on home varieties plus foreign expenditure on home varieties, and total expenditure equals total revenue.  \n\nLabor market clearing requires that total employment in the sector equals the economy's supply of labor, and expected worker income is determined from the requirement that total labor payments are a constant share of total revenue. Aggregate income follows immediately from expected worker income times the economy's supply of labor. Finally, we choose the aggregate consumption index in one country as the numeraire $(P=1)$ and solve for the dual price index in the other country. $(P^{*})$ using the sectoral demand shifter $(A^{*})$ , total expenditure $(E^{*})$ , and CES demand ( $\\overset{\\cdot}{A}\\v{U}^{*}=(E^{*})^{1-\\beta}(P^{*})^{\\beta}\\big)$  \n\nIn the case of symmetric countries, the single-sector model can be solved in closed form, as shown in the Technical Appendix. The closed-form solution for expected worker income is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\omega=\\alpha_{0}^{\\gamma\\beta/((1-\\beta)\\varDelta)}c^{\\beta(1-\\gamma k)(1+\\alpha_{1})/(\\delta(1-\\beta)\\varDelta)}\\theta_{d}^{-\\beta(1+\\alpha_{1})/((1-\\beta)\\varDelta)}\\bar{L}^{-(1+\\alpha_{1})/\\varDelta}\\kappa_{b}^{(1+\\alpha_{1})/\\varDelta},}\\ &{\\varDelta\\equiv(1+\\alpha_{1})-\\displaystyle\\frac{\\beta\\gamma\\alpha_{1}}{(1-\\beta)}<0,}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\kappa_{b}$ is defined in the Technical Appendix.39  \n\nAs the opening of trade increases the zero-profit cutoff productivity below which firms exit $\\left(\\theta_{d}\\right)$ , it increases expected worker income and, hence, ex ante welfare.  \n\nPROPOSITION 7: Let $\\eta=0$ . Then in the one-sector economy the opening of trade (i) increases expected worker income $(\\omega)$ and, hence, ex ante welfare, and (ii) increases labor market tightness $(x)$ and search costs $(b)$  \n\nWhile the predictions of the model without the outside sector for wage inequality are the same as those of the model with the outside sector, there is a new general equilibrium effect for unemployment through the tightness of the labormarket $(x)$  \n\n### 6.4. Risk Aversion  \n\nIncome risk in the differentiated sector arises from random search, which implies a positive probability of unemployment and uncertainty over a worker's employer, and, hence, uncertainty over the wage received in employment. In this section, we introduce risk aversion by considering the case where utility is concave in the aggregate consumption index ( $\\quad0<\\eta<1 $ ). In the model with an outside sector, this implies that workers will require a risk premium to enter the differentiated sector rather than receiving a certain wage of 1 in the outside sector.  \n\nTo determine general equilibrium in the model with the outside sector, we follow a similar approach as in Section 6.2 above.40 Risk aversion changes the  \n\n39The stabity o the qgibrium reguires $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{\\beta\\gamma}{1-\\beta}\\frac{\\alpha_{1}}{1+\\alpha_{1}}>1}\\end{array}$   \nvex search costs (sufficiently high $\\alpha_{1}$ ) and sufficiently high elasticities of substitution between varieties $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{\\dd{\\beta}}}$ sufficiently close to but less than 1). For parameter values satisfying this inequality, the equilibrium vector is again unique.  \n\n40Introducing risk aversion in the model with a single differentiated sector has little effect, because there is no riskless activity to or from which resources can move.  \n\nequilibrium share of revenue received by workers in the bargaining game, but does not otherwise affect the determination of sectoral equilibrium within the differentiated sector.41 Additionally, risk aversion modifies the Harris- Todaro condition for indifference between sectors, which equates expected utility in the differentiated sector to the certain wage of 1 in the outside sector:  \n\n$$\nx\\sigma\\mathbb{E}w^{1-\\eta}=x\\sigma\\int_{w_{d}}^{\\infty}w^{1-\\eta}d G_{w}(w)=1,\n$$  \n\nwhere expected utility in the differentiated sector equals the probability of being matched $(x)$ times the probability of being hired conditional on being matched $(\\sigma)$ times expected utility conditional on being hired.42  \n\nTo determine expected worker income in the differentiated sector ( $\\mathbf{\\chi}_{,\\omega=x b}^{\\prime}$ we use the modified Harris-Todaro condition above and the search technology (10), which together imply  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\omega=(\\alpha_{0})^{\\eta/(1+(1-\\eta)\\alpha_{1})}[(1+\\mu\\eta)\\phi_{w}^{\\eta}]^{(\\alpha_{1}+1)/(1+(1-\\eta)\\alpha_{1})}}}\\ {{\\quad\\times\\varLambda(\\rho,Y_{x})^{-(1+\\alpha_{1})/(1+(1-\\eta)\\alpha_{1})},}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\varLambda(\\rho,Y_{x})$ and $\\phi_{w}$ are defined in the Technical Appendix, and satisfies $\\varLambda(0,Y_{x})=1$ and $0<\\varLambda(\\rho,Y_{x})<1$ for $0<\\rho\\leq1$ . A sufficiently large search friction $\\left(\\alpha_{0}\\right)$ ensures positive unemployment ( $0<x<1$ in (12)) and a positive risk premium in the differentiated sector $\\left(\\omega-1>0\\right)$  \n\nAs shown in the analysis of sectoral equilibrium in Sections 2-4 above, the opening of trade increases sectoral wage inequality and unemployment for a given value of $\\omega$ . This increase in wage inequality and unemployment enhances income risk in the differentiated sector, which implies that risk averse workers require a higher risk premium to enter the differentiated sector. This “risk effect”’ raises expected worker income $(\\omega)$ following the opening of trade (since $\\varLambda(0,Y_{x})=1$ and $0<\\varLambda(\\rho,Y_{x})<1$ for $0<\\rho\\leq1$ in (29). This increase in expected worker income in turn increases labor market tightness $(x)$ and search costs $(b)$  \n\nPROPOSITION 8: Let $0<\\eta<1$ . Then in the two-sector economy, the opening of trade (i) increases expected worker income $(\\omega)$ , and (ii) increases labor market tightness $(x)$ and search costs $(b)$  \n\n41In the Technical Appendix, we derive the solution to the Stole and Zwiebel (1996a, 1996b) bargaining game when workers are risk averse. We show that with CRRA-CES preferences, the solution takes a similar form as when there are differences in bargaining weight between the firm and itsworkers.  \n\n42The terms in the price index $(\\mathcal{P})$ and $1/(1-\\eta)$ cancel from the Harris-Todaro condition equating expected utility in the two sectors.  \n\nWhile the predictions of the model with risk aversion for wage inequality are the same as those of the model with risk neutrality, there is again a new general equilibrium effect for unemployment through the tightness of the labor market $(x)$  \n\n## 7. CONCLUSION  \n\nThe relationship between international trade and earnings inequality is one of the most hotly debated issues in economics. Traditionally, research has approached this topic from the perspective of neoclassical trade theory with its emphasis on specialization across industries and changes in the relative rewards of skilled and unskilled labor. In this paper, we propose a new framework that emphasizes firm heterogeneity, Diamond-MortensenPissarides search and matching frictions, and ex post heterogeneity in worker ability.  \n\nIn this framework, the participation of some, but not all, firms in international trade provides a new mechanism for trade to affect wage inequality. We derive two results that hold in a class of models for which firm wages and employment are power functions of firm productivity, exporting increases the wage paid by a firm with a given productivity, and firm productivity is Pareto distributed. We show that the opening of the closed economy to trade raises sectoral wage inequality for any measure of inequality that respects secondorder stochastic dominance, because the opening of trade increases the dispersion of firm revenue, which in turn increases the dispersion of firm wages. Once the economy is open to trade, wage inequality is at first increasing and later decreasing in trade openness. Therefore, a given change in trade openness can either raise or reduce wage inequality, depending on the initial level of trade openness.  \n\nThe relationship between firm wages and revenue in our framework is derived from search and matching frictions and heterogeneity in ex post worker ability. Larger firms screen workers more intensively and have workforces of higher average ability, who are more costly to replace in the bargaining game and are, therefore, paid higher wages. As the opening of the closed economy to trade reallocates resources toward more productive firms that screen more intensively, it also affects unemployment. While the fraction of matched workers that are hired necessarily falls, the fraction of workers searching for employment that are matched can either remain unchanged or rise. Therefore, in contrast to the model's unambiguous predictions for wage inequality, its predictions for unemployment are more nuanced, and measures of wage and income inequality can yield quite different pictures of the impact of trade liberalization.  \n\nWhile for most of our analysis we concentrate on within-group wage inequality among ex ante identical workers, we show that our results on within-group wage inequality are robust to introducing multiple worker types with different ex ante observable characteristics. While trade raises wage inequality within every group of workers, it may increase or reduce wage inequality between different groups of workers. But even when between-group wage inequality falls, the rise of within-group inequality can dominate so that the opening of trade raises overall wage inequality.  \n\nOur model thus provides a unified framework for analyzing the complex interplay between wage inequality, unemployment and income inequality, and their relation to international trade. In popular discussion, the effects of international trade on income distribution are sometimes viewed as largely transitory, because it takes time for resources to be reallocated. In contrast, our framework identifies a systematic mechanism through which the opening of trade can raise equilibrium wage inequality across workers within sectors. This mechanism is founded in the new view of foreign trade that emphasizes firm heterogeneity in differentiated product markets and is consistent with observed features of firm and worker data. The tractability and flexibility of our framework lend themselves to a variety of further applications.  \n\n# REFERENCES  \n\nABOWD, J. M., R. H. CREECY, AND F.

We develop and analyze an alternative to the existing bargaining framework: Firms compete for labor by publicly posting long- term contracts. In such a competitive search setting, firms achieve faster growth not only by posting more vacancies, but also by offering higher lifetime wages that attract more workers which allows to fill vacancies with higher probability, consistent with empirical regularities. The model also captures several other observations about firm size, job flows, and pay. In contrast to bargaining models, efficiency obtains on all margins of job creation and destruction, both with idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks. The planner solution allows a tractable characterization which is useful for computational applications.  \n\nJEL Classification: E24, J64, L11  \n\nKeywords: labor market search, multi-worker firms, job creation and job destruction  \n\nCorresponding author:  \n\nLeo Kaas   \nDepartment of Economics   \nUniversity of Konstanz   \n78457 Konstanz   \nGermany   \nE-mail: leo.kaas@uni-konstanz.de  \n\n# 1 Introduction  \n\nSearch models of the labor market have traditionally treated the production side very simplistically: Either a firm has only one job, or large firms operate with constant marginal product, which is usually equivalent.1 While successful in many dimensions, these models are silent about all aspects that relate to employer size, even though firm size and firm dynamics are important for wages, job flows and aggregate employment.2  \n\nfocus due to the current perception that efficiency cannot be obtained in decentralized equilibrium, irrespective of the workers’ bargaining power; inefficiencies arise because each individual firm employs too many workers so as to depress the wages of its existing workforce.  \n\nThis work proposes and characterizes an alternative framework to think about firm dynamics in a frictional labor market. Firms can commit to long-term wage contracts, and can publicly post these contracts in order to attract unemployed workers (competitive search). Commitment allows firms to offer wage policies that are independent of the hiring of other workers, which remedies within-firm externalities. Posting introduces a competitive element into the labor market. Since workers can choose which contract to search for, those firms that want to hire faster raise the attractiveness of their offer in order to induce more workers to apply for the job. Posting and administering additional vacancies becomes increasingly costly, partially due to the fact that recruitment takes up time of the existing workers (e.g., Shimer (2010)), leading to a slow buildup of the workforce over time.  \n\nThis view of the hiring process generates equilibrium outcomes that are very different in positive and normative implications from the ones under bargaining described above. For one, the ability to post contracts means that firms fill their vacancies at different speeds depending on the wages that they offer, generating a connection between firm growth rates and job-filling rates. Moreover, commitment implies that wages do not need to fall as a frm grows larger (wages stay constant in our baseline model in Section 3). Finally, these factual implications on firm dynamics are indeed socially optimal: A social planner would choose the same path of job fows for each of the firms. Efficiency arises also in the presence of idiosyncratic and aggregate productivity shocks. Multi-worker firms create and destroy jobs efficiently both on the ertensive margin of firm entry/exit and on the intensive margin of firm expansion/contraction. The fact that firms can commit eliminates the intra-firm externalities, and the ability to publicly post contracts leads to inter-firm optimality via a modified Hosios condition. This suggests a plausible environment where a decentralized market achieves effciency despite decreasing returns to scale and labor market frictions, giving a justification for the study of the planner's solution and a benchmark against which to judge actual labor market outcomes. In this respect, our work extends the ideas of the competitive theory of Hopenhayn and Rogerson (1993) to an environment with a frictional labor market.  \n\nWe show analytically that the qualitative properties exhibit many of the empirical connections between firm size, growth and pay. We also demonstrate the applicability of this theory in a calibrated example and show that the model replicates several relevant cross-sectional relationships. It captures the negative relation between firm size and job fows on the extensive as well as the intensive margin, as well as the distribution of employment across firms with different growth rates. We also find that wages are positively correlated with firm size and firm growth. Faster-growing firms indeed generate more hires through both higher job-filling rates and more vacancy postings.  \n\nOne major advantage of this theory is that it provides tractability not only in steady state but also in the presence of business-cycle shocks. This is due to the fact that entry of new firms renders the firms’ policy functions independent of the firm distribution. They depend only on the firm's productivity, its current workforce, and on the aggregate state. This substantially reduces the state space, making it feasible to compute the model without the need to resort to approximation techniques, such as those of Krusell and Smith (1998), that have been applied in the heterogeneous-firm search models of Elsby and Michaels (2010) and Fujita and Nakajima (2009) to analyze aggregate labor market dynamics.  \n\nThe tractability is related in spirit but different in technique and implications from the notion of block recursivity introduced by Shi (2009) and Menzio and Shi (2009, 2010). In our environment, and in contrast to theirs, firms are not indifferent between contracts, matching rates for different contracts are not pinned down by a free-entry condition, and most contracts are offered only by a small subset of the existing firms. Nevertheless, existing firms compete for workers with new entrants, and workers choose to apply to either new or existing firms, which gives rise to an aggregate arbitrage condition. If firms always enter, this arbitrage ties the hiring of existing firms to the hiring of entrant firms and takes out the dependence on the prevailing frm distribution.6 Importantly, while the frms’ policy functions are independent of the frm distribution, aggregate labor-market variables such as the workers’ job-finding rate crucially depend on mix between new and old firms. This feature introduces a sluggish response of the job-finding rate to aggregate shocks, which has been documented in the data (e.g. Fujita and Ramey (2007). In standard labor search models, the job-finding rate is a jump-variable which is perfectly correlated with aggregate productivity.  \n\nThe basis for this work is the notion of competitive search developed for one worker-perfirm models by, e.g., Montgomery (1991), Peters (1991), Moen (1997), Acemoglu and Shimer (1999a,b), Burdett, Shi, and Wright (2001), Shi (2001), Shimer (2005a), Eeckhout and Kircher (2010). One original motivation for competitive search was to link firm characteristics such as profitability and capital-labor ratios to hiring rates and wages (e.g., Montgomery (1991)), but initial work was only able to talk about different jobs, lacking a notion of firm size. Our work defines a firm by its production function. It retains the idea that firms offer higher life-time wages when they want to fill a vacancy faster. They can also post more vacancies to increase their numbers of hires, yet frms’ capacity to create more vacancies is limited, for example because recruitment takes up labor which makes job creation increasingly expensive. As firms have different recruitment tools on hand, they use both higher wages and more vacancy postings to achieve faster growth. We characterize the dynamics of the workforce adjustment in this setting, and establish a non-trivial positive relation between productivity and vacancy-filling rates.7  \n\nEfficiency on the extensive margin of firm entry has long been established in competitive search with one worker per firm, yet efficiency on the intensive margin of output per firm has not been as conclusive: For example Guerrieri (2008) introduces an intensive margin through moral hazard and finds efficiency in steady state but not out of steady state. We show that in our model effciency on all margins obtains in and out of steady state.8  \n\nAfter a brief review of further related literature, especially Hawkins (2006) and Schaal (2010), we first present in Section 3 a simplified setup without aggregate or idiosyncratic productivity shocks. This allows for a teachable representation, it establishes the most important insights for dynamics of employment, job-filling rates and wage offers, and it demonstrates the efficiency of the decentralized allocation. In Section 4, we lay out the notationally more complex analysis that takes account of aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks, we prove the equivalence between the efficient and the decentralized allocations, and we characterize them using our aggregate arbitrage condition. Beyond the focus on these theoretical contributions, we consider a calibrated numerical example in Section 5 to illustrate the workings of the model and to point at its potential to capture the connections between firm dynamics and the labor market. We conclude in Section 6 with a discussion how risk aversion and worker heterogeneity might be introduced into this framework.  \n\n# 2 Further Related Literature  \n\nIn the labor search literature with large firms operating under decreasing returns to scale, lack of commitment to future wages has been the prevailing assumption. Our contribution, alongside contemporaneous contributions by Hawkins (2010) and Schaal (2010), is the first to introduce long-term contracts in a search setting where firms face decreasing returns.  \n\nIn the existing work, three features generate the intra-firm externalities mentioned above: lack of commitment, bilateral bargaining, and random search. If instead the firm either bargains about long-term contracts at the first time it meets a worker (Hawkins (2010)) or if it bargains multilaterally with a union comprising all workers at once (Bauer and Lingens (2010)) it can overcome this within-firm externality such that the firm and its workers take jointly efficient decisions taking the rest of the labor market as given. Nevertheless, these recent contributions point out that in neither case the market achieves overall efficiency. With long-term bargaining, firms still grow too big under convex vacancy costs: Large firms have small marginal product relative to the average firm on which they induce externalities by posting vacancies. This means that the social benefit of vacancy postings at large firms is smaller, so that efficiency would require them to obtain a smaller share of the surplus which is not possible with a single bargaining power parameter (unless vacancy costs are linear, or unless vacancies are posted in different submarkets resembling a competitive search setup). With union bargaining, there is a hold-up problem since firms’ job-creation costs are sunk at the time of bargaining, generating too little job creation on the intensive margin.  \n\nCompetitive search dispenses with bargaining weights and generates a surplus split through explicit competition for labor. Its micro-foundations usually combine Betrand-style contract posting with coordination frictions: sometimes multiple workers apply for the same job and only one of them can be hired (e.g. Peters (1991), Burdett, Shi, and Wright (2001), Galenianos and Kircher (2010)). These micro-foundations can be extended to a multi-worker firm setting if one assumes that excess applicants for one position cannot fill another position at the same firm. This arises if different vacancies relate to different qualifications: for example, vacancies for an electrician cannot be filled by applicants for the position of a mechanic or a carpenter, even though each position yields roughly the same contributions in terms of marginal product (therefore labor input is modeled homogeneously). An alternative interpretation is that workers are literally identical and excess capacity can be substituted from one job to another, which means that posting additional jobs exhibits increasing returns; see Burdett, Shi, and Wright (2001), Hawkins (2006) and Lester (2010) for variations along these lines. In accordance with most work on large firms, we adopt the first interpretation and abstract from possible increasing returns in hiring.  \n\nHawkins (2006) considers a one shot competitive search model with multi-worker firms and concave production. He assumes that firms employ finitely many workers after receiving a stochastic number of applications. Since the number of applicants is stochastic, he shows that posting a wage alone is not sufficient to induce effciency. Rather, the posted contract has to condition on the realized number of applicants. These contingencies make the model quite complicated, and results on efficiency and firm dynamics out of steady state are missing.  \n\nAll worker fows in our model are transitions between unemployment and employment. Work following the lines of Burdett and Mortensen (1998), Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002), Moscarini and Postel-Vinay (2010), Shi (2009), Menzio and Shi (2009, 2010), Garibaldi and Moen (2010) and recently Schaal (2010) focused additionally on worker fows between firms. Except for the last contribution, firm size in these models is not restricted by the operated technology, though, circumventing considerations induced by the difference between average and marginal product.9 Closely related to our contribution is the work by Garibaldi and Moen (2010) who also consider a competitive search model with heterogeneous firms, deriving a number of new insights for onthe job search. As they assume constant-returns in production, the only determinant of firm size arises from convex vacancy creation costs, which are assumed to be independent of firm size or productivity. By implication, the current size of the firm ceases to be a state variable, and therefore firm growth and wages depend only on the productivity type but are independent of firm size. That is, their model is silent about the role of frm size and age for job creation; it also abstracts from idiosyncratic and aggregate productivity shocks.10  \n\nA major tractability result is achieved in Shi (2009) and Menzio and Shi (2009, 2010): They show that under free entry matching rates do not depend on the distribution of workers across jobs. In particular, in equilibrium firms are exactly indifferent regarding which contract to post. This technique extends to our setup only in the special case where recruitment costs are linear: Then all firms share the same preferences over which contracts to offer independently of their size or growth.ll Schaal (2010) uses this insight to allow for on-the-job search with heterogeneous firms based on the techniques of Menzio and Shi (2009). The drawback of the firms′ indifference is that firm characteristics are not linked to the contracts it offers, implying for example that firm growth is not linked to job-filling rates or to the life-time wages offered. Firms immediately jump to their optimal size without dynamic adjustment. Further, the job-finding rate for unemployed workers is a jump variable, perfectly correlated with aggregate productivity and independent of the frm distribution. In our work, in contrast, frms face limitations to expand the workforce by posting more vacancies, so that they have to rely on posting higher wages if they want grow fast. They are no longer indifferent between contracts, and job-filling rates are linked to firm characteristics. Furthermore, many important aggregate variables, such as unemployment and job-finding rates, do depend on the firm distribution, which induces a sluggish response to business-cycle shocks. The reason is that unemployed workers search for jobs both at existing and at new firms, the hiring rates between these firms differ, and the mix between new and existing firms varies over time.  \n\nIn further relation to the random-search multi-worker-firm models mentioned in the introduction, it is worth pointing out that current applied work on business cycles only focuses on the intensive margin of hiring by considering a fixed number of firms (Elsby and Michaels (2010), Fujita and Nakajima (2009)). Similarly, Cooper, Haltiwanger, and Willis (2007) assess business cycle implications for a fixed number of frms, assuming zero bargaining power for workers. Our paper addresses additionally the entry and exit of firms, and this feature is in fact decisive to obtain a tractable solution. The problem that bargaining might introduce unwarranted inefficiencies by assumption has also spurred other solutions than ours. For example, Veracierto (2008) and Samaniego (2008) consider general-equilibrium versions of the Hopenhayn and Rogerson (1993) model with frictionless labor markets and competitive wage setting. These approaches eliminate involuntary unemployment altogether. Veracierto (2009) introduces unemployment in an adaptation of the Lucas-Prescott island model that includes recruitment technologies. In contrast, competitive search allows the market to operate through decentralized wage setting, which attracts workers that optimally choose between search markets and are matched according to a standard matching function.  \n\n# 3A Stationary Model of Firm Creation and Firm Growth  \n\n## 3.1 The Environment  \n\nThe model is set in discrete time and is stationary; that is, there are neither idiosyncratic nor aggregate shocks. These will be introduced in Section 4.  \n\n### Workers and Firms  \n\nThere is a continuum of workers and firms, and workers are negligibly small relative to frms. That is, every active frm employs a continuum of workers.12 The mass of workers is normalized to one. Each worker is infinitely-lived, risk-neutral, and discounts future income with factor $\\beta<1$ . A worker supplies one unit of labor per period and receives income $b\\geq0$ when unemployed. On the other side of the labor market is an endogenous mass of firms. Firms are also risk neutral and have the same discount factor $\\beta$ . Upon entry, the firm pays a set-up cost $K>0$ and draws productivity $x$ with probability $\\pi_{0}(x)$ from the finite set $x\\in X$ . In this section, productivity stays constant during the life of the firm. In each period, a firm produces output $x F(L)$ with $L\\geq0$ workers, where $F$ is a twice differentiable, strictly increasing and strictly concave function satisfying $F^{\\prime}(\\infty)=0$ . Firms die with exogenous probability $\\delta>0$ in which case all its workers are laid off into unemployment. Furthermore, each employed worker quits the job with exogenous probability $s\\geq0$ . Thus, workers’ separation probability is exogenous at $\\eta\\equiv1-(1-\\delta)(1-s)$  \n\n### Recruitment  \n\nSearch for new hires is a costly activity. A firm with current workforce $L$ that posts $V$ vacancies incurs recruitment cost $C(V,L,x)$ . An often used benchmark is the case where firms pay some monetary recruitment cost $C(V,L,x)=k(V)$ that is strictly increasing and strictly convex, but independent of the current size or productivity (for applications of this specific case, see e.g. Cooper, Haltiwanger, and Willis (2007), Koeniger and Prat (2007), Garibaldi and Moen (2010)). The convexity captures adjustment costs that prevent the firm from immediately growing large just by posting many vacancies. A deeper micro-foundation for the convexity arises when recruitment costs are in terms of labor rather than goods, as proposed in Shimer (2010). This naturally leads to strictly convex costs even if the inputs into recruitment are linear. For example, if each vacancy costs $c\\geq0$ units of output but also requires $h>0$ units of recruitment time from existing workers, then the total recruitment costs $C(V,L,x)=x F(L)-x F(L-h V)+$ $c V$ , comprising lost output and pecuniary costs, are strictly convex.13 Taking no stance on either specification, we allow recruitment costs of the form $C(V,L,x)=x F(L)-x F(L-h V)+k(V)$ with at least one of the inequalities $h\\geq0$ and $k^{\\prime\\prime}(V)\\geq0$ strict. Our results can be extended to other cost functions as long as they obey the concavity and cross-partial restrictions that we outline in the proofs and that arise naturally for this specification.  \n\n### Search and Matching  \n\nA recruiting firm announces a fat fow wage income $w$ to be paid to its new hires for the duration of the employment relation. The assumption that the frm offers the same wage to all its new hires is no restriction. Indeed, it is straightforward to show that it is profit maximizing for the frm to post vacancies with identical wages at a given point in time.14 Further, because of risk neutrality, only the net present value that a firm promises to the worker matters. Flat wages are one way of delivering these promises.15  \n\nwhere a submarket is indexed by wage $w$ and unemployment-vacancy ratio $\\lambda$ 16  The latter is an equilibrium object that depends on how attractive this wage is relative to the other wages that are offered. In any of these submarkets, unemployed workers and vacant jobs are matched according to a constant-returns matching technology, and the associated wage is paid every period that the worker is employed. The matching probabilities depend on the unemploymentvacancy ratio $\\lambda$ : a vacancy is matched with a worker with probability $m(\\lambda)$ and a worker finds a job with probability $m(\\lambda)/\\lambda$ . The function $m$ is differentiable, strictly increasing, strictly concave, and it satisfies $m(0)=0$ and $m(\\lambda)\\leq\\operatorname*{min}(1,\\lambda)$ for all $\\lambda\\in[0,\\infty)$ . In particular, this means that a market that attracts more workers per vacancy induces higher matching rates for the firms and lower matching rates for workers.  \n\nAs discussed in the previous section, we follow most of the literature by assuming that each vacancy has its independent matching rate. Then the law of large numbers convention together with the assumption that workers are small relative to firms ensures that firms know with certainty that they hire $m(\\lambda)V$ workers when they post $V$ vacancies in some submarket with worker-job ratio $\\lambda$ 17  \n\n### Timing  \n\nEvery period is divided into four stages. First, new firms are created and draw their productivity. Second, production and search activities take place. Third, vacancies and unemployed workers are matched, and a fraction $s$ of workers leave their firm. And fourth, a share $\\delta$ Offirms dies. Newly hired workers may never work (and receive no wage income) in the unlucky event that their employer exits the market at the end of the period.  \n\n## 3.2 Equilibrium  \n\nGiven that there are no aggregate shocks, we characterize a stationary equilibrium where a constant number of firms enters the market in every period and where the workers? reservation wage is constant over time.  \n\n### Workers’ Search Problem  \n\nIn a stationary environment, a worker who is looking for a job in a particular submarket in one period is willing to search in that submarket in every period. Consider a worker who is always searching for a job in a submarket characterized by wage $w$ and unemployment-vacancy ratio $\\lambda$ . Within this market the worker follows a simple sequential search process which has been analyzed extensively going back to McCall (1965). Standard arguments give rise to the following equation determining the workers′ reservation wage:18  \n\n$$\nR=b+\\beta\\underbrace{\\frac{m(\\lambda)}{\\lambda}(w-R)\\frac{1-\\delta}{1-\\beta(1-\\eta)}}_{\\equiv\\rho}.\n$$  \n\nThis means that the reservation wage equals the current period payof from unemployment together with an option value from searching, denoted by $\\rho$ . The search value is the probability of finding a job to the next period multiplied with the worker's job surplus, which is the present discounted value of flow gains $w-R$  \n\nWorkers have a choice which submarket they want to search in. In equilibrium all markets have to deliver the same search value $\\rho$ . If a market would be more attractive than others, then more workers would join that market and drive up the unemployment-vacancy ratio, making the market less attractive. Similarly, if a market is less attractive than others and still has $\\lambda>0$ workers would leave this market, reducing the unemployment-vacancy ratio and making this market more attractive. Therefore, when workers choose between all combinations $(w,\\lambda)\\in\\Omega$ where $\\Omega$ is the set of equilibrium submarkets, all markets have the same search value $\\rho$ if they attract applicants. Rearranging means that $(w,\\lambda)\\in\\Omega$ has to fulfill  \n\n$$\nw=R+\\frac{\\lambda}{m(\\lambda)}\\frac{1-\\beta(1-\\eta)}{1-\\delta}\\rho\\quad\\mathrm{whenever}\\quad\\lambda>0.\n$$  \n\nThis condition says that a firm can only recruit workers when its wage offer matches the workers' reservation wage plus a premium which is needed to attract workers into a submarket with jobfinding probability $m(\\lambda)/\\lambda$ . This premium is increasing in $\\lambda$ . This is a crucial insight. If a firm wants to attract more workers per vacancy in order to fill its vacancy at a faster rate, it has to offer a higher wage. This means that wages are always monotonically related to the job-filling rate. The relationship between worker-job ratios and wage offers is standard in the competitive search literature (e.g., Moen (1997), Acemoglu and Shimer (1999b)).  \n\n### Firms’ Recruitment Policy  \n\nLet $J^{x}(L,W)$ be the profit value of a frm with productivity $x$ , an employment stock of $L$ workers and a commitment to a total wage bill of $W$ . An entrant firm's profit value is then $J^{x}(0,0)$ . The firm's recruitment choice involves deciding the number of posted vacancies $V$ as  \n\nwell as the submarket where these vacancies are posted, characterized by the tuple $(w,\\lambda)$ .Its recursive profit maximization problem is expressed as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{J^{x}(L,W)}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{max}_{(w,\\lambda,V)}x F(L)-W-C(V,L,x)+\\beta(1-\\delta)J^{x}(\\hat{L},\\hat{W})~,}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{\\mathrm{s.t.}~\\hat{L}=L(1-s)+m(\\lambda)V~,~\\hat{W}=W(1-s)+m(\\lambda)V w~,}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe frst line refects the value of output minus wage and hiring costs, plus the discounted value of continuation with an adjusted workforce and its associated wage commitment. The second line captures that employment next period consists of the retained workers and the new hires. For the wages, since separations are random they reduce the wage bill proportionally, and new commitments are added for the new hires. The last line connects the offered wage to the worker-vacancy ratio through the workers’ search problem.  \n\nThe solutions to problem (3) are characterized by one intra-temporal and one inter-temporal optimality condition, equations (4) and (5) below, that we derive in the Appendix (proof of Proposition 1). We also show that the firm's recruitment strategy is independent of past wage commitments and can be described by two policy functions: $\\lambda^{x}(L)$ denotes the number of applicants that a firm of size $L$ and productivity $x$ wants to attract per vacancy. This directly determines the wage it has to post according to (2). Given a choice of $\\lambda$ , the firm decides on the number of number of posted vacancies. We denote this policy function by $V^{x}(L,\\lambda)$  \n\nThe intra-temporal optimality condition describes the choice between the two recruitment tools of the firm within a period: the number of posted vacancies $V$ on the one hand, and the worker-jobratio $\\lambda$ (and thus the posted wage $w$ ) on the other:  \n\n$$\nC_{1}(V,L,x)\\geq\\beta\\rho\\frac{m(\\lambda)-\\lambda m^{\\prime}(\\lambda)}{m^{\\prime}(\\lambda)}\\mathrm{~,~}V\\geq0\\mathrm{~,~}\n$$  \n\nwith complementary slackness. This condition can be derived by minimizing the sum of recruitment costs and wage costs conditional on the requirement of hiring a given amount $H=m(\\lambda)V$ of workers this period. The left-hand side gives the marginal cost of posting one more vacancy. When a firm posts more vacancies, it can lower its wage offer and the associated hiring rate while keeping the total number of hires constant. The net present value of wage savings are represented by the right-hand side, an increasing function of $\\lambda$ . From the assumptions on $C$ follows that the left side is (weakly) decreasing in $L$ and strictly increasing in $V$ . Hence the implicit solution to this equation yields the policy function $V=V^{x}(L,\\lambda)$ which is increasing in $\\lambda$ and (weakly) increasing in $L$ . Intuitively, with higher $\\lambda$ the probability to fill a vacancy increases, and hence the firm is willing to bear higher marginal recruitment costs by advertising more jobs. And with higher $L$ , marginal recruitment costs fall and hence the firm is inclined to post more vacancies. Clearly, if costs are linear in vacancies and independent of the other variables, then the optimal job-filling rate according to (4) is independent of any firm or size characteristics. In that case the model loses the connection between the desire to expand and the attractiveness of the job offers that are posted, because any adjustment can be achieved through vacancy creation on which there are no bounds even for the smallest firms. Equation (4) also provides an intuition why it is never optimal for a firm to offer different wages at a given point in time: the firm compares the wage costs against the vacancy costs, and there is a unique value that balances this trade-off.  \n\nThe inter-temporal optimality condition describes how the firm grows over time. For a firm which hires in the current and in the next period $(\\lambda,\\hat{\\lambda}>0)$ , we obtain the Euler equation  \n\n$$\nx F^{\\prime}(\\hat{L})-C_{2}(\\hat{V},\\hat{L},x)-R=\\frac{\\rho}{1-\\delta}\\Big[\\frac{1}{m^{\\prime}(\\lambda)}-\\frac{\\beta(1-\\eta)}{m^{\\prime}(\\hat{\\lambda})}\\Big].\n$$  \n\nHere $\\hat{L}$ $\\hat{V}$ ,and $\\hat{\\lambda}$ are next period's values of employment, vacancy postings and worker-job ratio. Since next period's employment and vacancy creation are fully determined by the worker-job ratios in this and the next period (through (4) and the frst constraint in (3)), this condition links the worker-job ratio and the related hiring rate inter-temporally. The left-hand side of this equation captures the marginal benefit of a higher workforce in the next period. If this is high, then the firm rather hires more workers now than to wait and hire them next period. This is captured by the right-hand side, which is increasing in the current worker-job ratio but decreasing in next period's worker-job ratio. In particular, this means that a more productive firm wants to achieve fast growth by offering a more attractive contract, thus raising the workerjob ratio and the job-filling rate.  \n\nThe following proposition and its corollaries provide comparative statics results for the jobfilling rate and the growth rate of firms. The job-filling rate is linked to the earnings offer, so that these comparative statics carry over to the offered net present value of wages to new hires. These characterization results depend crucially on the supermodularity of the value function, which renders this proof non-trivial. While standard techniques (Amir (1996)) can be applied when the cost function is independent of firm size and productivity, this is no longer true in the more general setting.  \n\nProposition 1: For any value $\\rho>0$ , the frm's value function $J^{x}(L,W)$ is strictly increasing and strictly concave in $L$ , increasing in $x$ , strictly supermodular in $(x,L)$ , and continuous and decreasing in $\\rho$ . The frm's policy functions are independent of wage commitments $W$ .For a hiring firm the policy function $\\lambda^{x}(L)$ is strictly increasing in $x$ and strictly decreasing in $L$ Posted vacancies $V^{x}(L,\\lambda)$ are increasing in $L$ and strictly increasing in $\\lambda$  \n\nProof: Appendix.  \n\nSince these results hold for any search value $\\rho$ , they also apply when this value is determined in general equilibrium. These results directly imply  \n\nCorollary 1: Conditional on size, more productive frms pay higher wages and have a higher job-filling rate. Conditional on productivity, younger (and smaller) frms pay higher wages and have a higher job-filling rate.  \n\nIn the Appendix, we also prove  \n\nCorollary 2: If parameter h in the recruitment technology is sufficiently small, more productive firms have a higher growth rate, conditional on size; and larger frms have a lower growth rate, conditional on productivity.  \n\nA useful illustration how firms grow over time can be provided in a special case. Consider a firm with productivity $x$ that enters in some period $\\tau$ . Its job creation policy is then described by a sequence $(L_{t},\\lambda_{t},V_{t})_{t\\geq\\tau}$ starting from $\\boldsymbol{L}_{\\u{\\tau}}~=~0$ . Posted vacancies $V_{t}=V^{x}(L_{t},\\lambda_{t})$ are the implicit solution of equation (4). The employment stock accumulates according to  \n\n$$\nL_{t+1}=(1-s)L_{t}+m(\\lambda_{t})V^{x}(L_{t},\\lambda_{t}).\n$$  \n\nIn the example with recruitment cost $\\mathcal{O}(V,L,x)=x F(L)-x F(L-h V)+c V$ , equations (5) and (4) can be further simplified to an equation which is independent of $L_{t}$  \n\n$$\n\\beta\\rho\\Big[m(\\lambda_{t+1})-\\lambda_{t+1}m^{\\prime}(\\lambda_{t+1})\\Big]-[R h+c]m^{\\prime}(\\lambda_{t+1})=\\frac{\\rho h}{1-\\delta}\\Big[\\frac{m^{\\prime}(\\lambda_{t+1})}{m^{\\prime}(\\lambda_{t})}-\\beta(1-\\eta)\\Big]\n$$  \n\nIn Lemma 3 of the Appendix, we show that this equation has a unique steady state $\\lambda^{*}>0$ if recruitment costs are low enough, and $\\lambda_{t}$ converges to $\\lambda^{*}$ from any initial value $\\lambda_{\\tau}>0$ . Figure 1 shows the phase diagram for the system (6) and (7). The curve where the employment stock is constant ( $L_{t}=L_{t+1}$ ) is downward sloping since (4) implies that $V^{x}(L,\\lambda)/L$ is increasing in $L$ . If the condition  \n\n$$\nx F^{\\prime}(0)>R+\\frac{\\rho[1-\\beta(1-\\eta)]}{(1-\\delta)m^{\\prime}(\\lambda^{*})}\n$$  \n\nholds, there exists a unique stationary employment level $L^{*}>0$ . The corresponding dynamics imply further that there is a downward-sloping saddle path converging to the long-run employment level. Graphically, the firm's policy function $\\lambda^{x}(L)$ traces this saddle path.  \n\nIt follows from these considerations that the firm's recruitment policy is characterized by a path of declining wage offers and job-filling rates along the transition to the firm's longrun employment level. Concavity of the firm's production function implies that the firm wants to spread out its recruitment costs across several periods. This statement remains true for other forms of the recruitment technology. Only when recruitment costs are linear in vacancies, $C(V)=c V$ , the firm would choose a constant $\\lambda^{*}$ (and hence post the same wage in all periods). In that case, it would immediately jump to its optimal size by recruiting $L^{*}$ workers in the entry period and then keep the employment level constant. As soon as recruitment costs are strictly convex, such a policy is not optimal, and it may not be feasible due to the capacity constraint on labor input in recruitment. A further insight of this example is that the stationary firm size depends positively on $x$ : a more productive firm grows larger and offers higher lifetime wages on its transition to the long-run employment level.  \n\n![](images/8a8bfed8f0becc830f5133a063a9445f98ab34dd5a0d7954ed4eea3a9cd4a6ae.jpg)  \nFigure 1: The firm's optimal recruitment policy follows the declining saddle path.  \n\n### Firm Creation  \n\nNo entrant makes a positive profit when the expected profit income of a new firm equals the entry cost, that is,  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{x\\in X}\\pi(x)J^{x}(0,0)=K.\n$$  \n\nThis condition implicitly pins down the worker's job surplus $\\rho$ and therefore, via the frm's optimal recruitment policy, worker-job ratios in all submarkets. In a stationary equilibrium, a constant mass of $N_{0}$ firms enters the market in every period, so that there are $N_{a}=N_{0}(1-\\delta)^{a}$ frms of age $a$ in any period. Let $(L_{a}^{x},\\lambda_{a}^{x},V_{a}^{x},w_{a}^{x})_{a\\geq0}$ be the employment /recruitment path for a firm with productivity $x$ . Then, a firm of age $a$ with productivity $x$ has $L_{a}^{x}$ employed workers, and $\\lambda_{a}^{x}V_{a}^{x}$ unemployed workers are searching for jobs in the same submarket where this firm searches for workers, offering wage $w_{a}^{x}$ . Therefore, the mass of entrant firms $N_{0}$ is uniquely pinned down from aggregate resource feasibility:  \n\n$$\n1=\\sum_{a\\ge0}N_{0}(1-\\delta)^{a}\\sum_{x\\in X}\\pi(x)[L_{a}^{x}+\\lambda_{a}^{x}V_{a}^{x}].\n$$  \n\nThis equation says that the unit mass of workers is either employed or unemployed.  \n\n### General Equilibrium  \n\nWe now define a stationary equilibrium with positive firm entry. When $K$ is large enough, there may also be an uninteresting equilibrium without frms which is ignored in the following.  \n\nDefinition: A stationary competitive search equilibrium is a list  \n\n$$\n\\left(\\rho,R,N_{0},(L_{a}^{x},\\lambda_{a}^{x},V_{a}^{x},w_{a}^{x})_{x\\in X,a\\geq0}\\right)\n$$  \n\nsuch that  \n\n(a) Unemployed workers? job search strategies maximize utility. That is, the reservation wage $R$ satisfies (1) and the relationship between wages and worker-job ratios satisfies (2) for all submarkets $(w_{a}^{x},\\lambda_{a}^{x})$   \n(b)  Firms' recruitment policies are optimal. That is, given $\\rho$ and $R$ ,and for all $x\\in X$ ， $(L_{a}^{x},\\lambda_{a}^{x},V_{a}^{x})_{a\\geq0}$ describes the firm's growth path, obtained from the policy functions solving problem (3).   \n(c) There is free entry of frms, equation (8).   \n(d) The number of entrant frms is consistent with aggregate resource feasibility, equation (9).  \n\nSince frms' behavior has already been characterized, it remains to explore equilibrium existence and uniqueness.  \n\nProposition 2: A stationary competitive search equilibrium exists and is unique. There is strictly positive firm entry provided that $K$ is sufficiently small and $F^{\\prime}(0)$ is sufficiently large.  \n\nProof: Appendix.  \n\nIt is worthwhile to briefy summarize some cross-sectional implications of our theory. Different firms in the equilibrium cross-section $(x,L)$ have different recruitment and wage policies. Corollaries 1 and 2 point out that job-filling rates and firm growth rates depend positively on $x$ and negatively on $L$ . Hence, when recruitment time input $h$ is small enough, firm growth rates correlate positively with job-flling rates. Such a relationship has been documented by Davis, Faberman, and Haltiwanger (2010) who find that firms that grow faster do so through a higher job-filling rate on top of expanding the number of vacancies. Furthermore, since job-filling rates relate directly to the earnings of new hires, the two corollaries also imply that faster-growing firms offer higher lifetime wages. Belzil (200o) documents such patterns after controlling for size and worker characteristics; he shows that wages, particularly those of new hires, are positively related to a firm's job creation. Lastly, a well established fact in labor economics is the positive relationship between size, productivity and pay (e.g., Brown and Medoff (1989), Oi and Idson (1999)). In our model, wages of new hires depend positively on $x$ and negatively on $L$ .Since more productive firms grow larger, a positive wage size relation emerges in our model if the dispersion in productivity is large enough.19 Moreover, such a relation also obtains if sufficiently many firms are close to their long-run employment level (which happens if the exit rate $\\delta$ is rather low): Among those firms with nearly constant employment, the larger (and more productive) firms need to hire more to keep their workforce constant. Therefore, among the cross-section of established firms the larger ones offer higher life-time wages.20  \n\n## 3.3 Efficiency  \n\nThe social planner decides at each point in time about firm creation, job creation and workerjob ratios in different submarkets of the economy. The planner takes as given the numbers of firms that were created in some earlier period, as well as the employment stocks of all these firms. Formally, the planner's state vector is  \n\n$$\n\\sigma=(N_{a},L_{a}^{x})_{a\\geq1,x\\in X},\n$$  \n\nwhere $N_{a}$ is the mass of firms of age $a\\geq1$ , and $L_{a}^{x}$ is employment of a firm with productivity $x$ and age $a$ . It is no restriction to impose that all firms of a given type $(a,x)$ are equally large. The planner maximizes the present value of output net of opportunity costs of employment and net of the costs of firm and job creation. With $\\hat{\\sigma}$ to denote the state vector in the next period, the recursive formulation of the social planning problem is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{max}_{N_{0},(V_{a}^{x},\\lambda_{a}^{x})_{a\\geq0}}\\left\\{\\displaystyle\\sum_{a\\geq0}N_{a}\\sum_{x\\in X}\\pi(x)\\Big[x F(L_{a}^{x})-b L_{a}^{x}-C(V_{a}^{x},L_{a}^{x},x)\\Big]\\right\\}-K N_{0}+\\beta S(\\hat{a})}\\ &{\\mathrm{s.t.}L_{0}^{x}=0,\\hat{L}_{a+1}^{x}=(1-s)L_{a}^{x}+m(\\lambda_{a}^{x})V_{a}^{x},a\\geq0,x\\in X,}\\ &{\\displaystyle\\hat{N}_{a+1}=(1-\\delta)N_{a},a\\geq0,}\\ &{\\displaystyle\\sum_{a\\geq0}N_{a}\\sum_{x\\in X}\\pi(x)\\Big(L_{a}^{x}+\\lambda_{a}^{x}V_{a}^{x}\\Big)\\leq1.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nqueuing up for a job at this firm $\\lambda_{a}^{x}V_{a}^{x}$ , may not exceed one. We say that a solution to problem (10) is socially optimal.  \n\nProposition 3: The stationary competitive search equilibrium is socially optimal.  \n\nProof: Appendix.  \n\nThe effciency of equilibrium can be linked to a variant of the well-known Hosios (1990) condition. It says that efficient job creation requires that the share of the surplus that firms get upon matching with a worker is equal to the elasticity of the job-finding rate with respect to the job-workerratio $1/\\lambda$ (which is one minus the elasticity of $m$ ). For a hiring firm ( $V>0,\\lambda>0)$ we can exploit the first-order conditions for problem (3) (equations (54) and (55) in the Appendix) toobtain  \n\n$$\nC_{1}(V,L,x)=\\Bigl[1-{\\frac{\\lambda m^{\\prime}(\\lambda)}{m(\\lambda)}}\\Bigr]m(\\lambda)(1-\\delta)\\beta\\Bigl\\{J_{1}^{x}(\\hat{L},\\hat{W})-{\\frac{R}{1-\\beta(1-\\eta)}}\\Bigr\\}.\n$$  \n\nThis equation compares the marginal cost of a vacancy on the left-hand side to the marginal benefit on the right-hand side. The term in squared brackets captures the surplus share accruing to the firm, and the last terms capture the expected discounted total surplus of a vacancy. With probability $m(\\lambda)(1-\\delta)$ , the vacancy is filled and survives to the next period. The term in curly brackets represent the marginal surplus of a filled job, which is the difference between the expected discounted marginal increase in net output, $J_{1}^{x}(\\hat{L},\\hat{W})$ , and the discounted value of the worker's opportunity cost for the duration of the job. Overall, the equation states that frms create vacancies exactly to the point where their marginal benefit coincides with the value specified by the appropriate Hosios condition for large firms.21  \n\n# 4 Productivity Shocks and Firm Dynamics  \n\nWe now extend the previous model to include both idiosyncratic (firm-specific) and aggregate productivity shocks. This extension allows us to explore not only two margins of job creation (firm entry and firm growth), but also the two margins of job destruction (firm exit and firm contraction). Output of a firm with $L$ workers is $x z F(L)$ where $x\\in X$ is idiosyncratic productivity and $z\\in Z$ is aggregate productivity. Both $x$ and $z$ follow Markov processes on finite state spaces $X$ and $Z$ with respective transition probabilities $\\pi(x_{+}|x)$ and $\\psi(z_{+}|z)$ . An entrant firm pays fixed cost $K$ and draws an initial productivity level $x_{0}\\in X$ with probability $\\pi_{0}(x_{0})$ . For a firm of age $a\\geq0$ , let $x^{a}=(x_{0},\\ldots,x_{a})\\in X^{a+1}$ denote the history of idiosyncratic productivity, and let $z^{t}=(z_{0},\\dots,z_{t})$ be the history of aggregate shocks at time $t$ .Write $\\psi(z^{t})$ and $\\pi(x^{a})$ for the unconditional probabilities of aggregate and idiosyncratic productivity histories.  \n\nWe assume that an active firm incurs a fixed operating cost $f\\geq0$ per period. This parameter is required to obtain a non-trivial exit margin.22 In this section we are as agnostic as possible about the recruitment cost function; we only assume that $C$ is strictly increasing and convex in posted vacancies. Firms exit with exogenous probability $\\delta_{0}\\geq0$ which is a lower bound for the actual exit rates $\\delta\\geq\\delta_{0}$ . Similarly, workers quit a job with exogenous rate $s_{0}\\geq0$ which provides a lower bound for the actual separation rates $s\\geq s_{0}$ .23  \n\nThe timing within each period is as follows.24 First, aggregate and idiosyncratic productivities are revealed, new frms enter, and all frms decide about separations and exit. Second, firms decide about recruitment, and recruiting firms are matched with unemployed workers. An unemployed worker who has just left another job (due to firm exit, quit or layoff) can search for reemployment within the same period. And third, production takes place. In the following, we first describe the planning problem before we show its equivalence to a competitive search equilibrium in Section 4.4.  \n\n## 4.1 The Planning Problem  \n\nThe planner decides at each point in time about firm entry and exit, layoffs and job creation, as well as worker-job ratios in different submarkets. In a given aggregate history $z^{t}$ , we denote by $N(x^{a},z^{t})$ the mass of firms of age $a$ with idiosyncratic history $x^{a}$ . Similarly, $L(x^{a},z^{t})$ is the employment stock of any of these firms. At every history node $z^{t}$ and for every firm type $x^{a}$ ， the planner decides an exit probability $\\delta(x^{a},z^{t})\\geq\\delta_{0}$ , a separation rate $s(x^{a},z^{t})\\geq s_{0}$ , vacancy postings $V(x^{a},z^{t})\\geq0$ , and a worker-job ratio $\\lambda(x^{a},z^{t})$ for the submarket in which vacancies of that firm are matched with unemployed workers.25 The numbers of firm types change between  \n\nperiods $t-1$ and $t$ according to  \n\n$$\nN(x^{a},z^{t})=[1-\\delta(x^{a},z^{t})]\\pi(x_{a}|x_{a-1})N(x^{a-1},z^{t-1}),\n$$  \n\nand the employment stock at any of these frms adjusts to  \n\n$$\nL(x^{a},z^{t})=[1-s(x^{a},z^{t})]L(x^{a-1},z^{t-1})+m(\\lambda(x^{a},z^{t}))V(x^{a},z^{t}).\n$$  \n\nTo simplify notation, we define $L(x^{a},z^{t})\\equiv[1-s(x^{a},z^{t})]L(x^{a-1},z^{t-1})$ as the employment stock after separations and before recruitment, which is an argument of the firm's recruitment cost function $C(V,\\overline{{L}},x)$  \n\nAt time $t=0$ , the planner takes as given the numbers of firms that entered the economy in some earlier period, as well as the employment stock of each of these firms. Hence, the state vector at date $0$ , prior to the realization of productivities, is summarized by the initial firm distribution $(N(x^{a-1},.),L(x^{a-1},.))_{a\\geq1,x^{a-1}\\in X^{a}}$ . In a given history $z^{t}$ , the planner also decides the massof new entrants $N_{0}(z^{t})\\geq0$ , so that  \n\n$$\nN(x_{0},z^{t})=[1-\\delta(x_{0},z^{t})]\\pi_{0}(x_{0})N_{0}(z^{t})\\mathrm{and}L(x_{0},z^{t})=m(\\lambda(x_{0},z^{t}))V(x_{0},z^{t}).\n$$  \n\nThe planning problem is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}{\\lefteqn{\\operatorname*{max}_{\\delta,\\boldsymbol{S},\\boldsymbol{V},\\lambda,\\boldsymbol{N}_{0}}\\sum_{t\\ge0,z^{t}}\\beta^{t}\\psi(z^{t})\\Bigg\\{-K N_{0}(z^{t})+}}\\ &{}&\\ &{}&{\\sum_{a\\ge0,x^{a}}N(x^{a},z^{t})\\Big[x_{a}z_{t}F(L(x^{a},z^{t}))-b L(x^{a},z^{t})-f-C(V(x^{a},z^{t}),\\overline{{L}}(x^{a},z^{t}),}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nsubject to the dynamic equations for $N$ and $L$ , namely (11), (12) and (13), and subject to the resource constraints, for all $z^{t}\\in Z^{t+1}$  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{a\\geq0,x^{a}}N(x^{a},z^{t})\\Big[\\overline{{L}}(x^{a},z^{t})+\\lambda(x^{a},z^{t})V(x^{a},z^{t})\\Big]\\leq1.\n$$  \n\nThis constraint says that the labor force (employment plus unemployment) cannot exceed the given unit mass of workers. The first part of the sum, namely  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{a\\geq0,x^{a}}N(x^{a},z^{t})\\overline{{{L}}}(x^{a},z^{t}),\n$$  \n\nare the workers that are employed in some firm after separations have taken place. The remaining part of the sum are unemployed workers queueing up for employment in one of the active firms posting $V(.)$ vacancies in submarkets with worker-job ratios $\\lambda(.)$ . For instance, there are $N(x^{a},z^{t})$ active firms with productivity history $x^{a}$ , each of which posts $V(x^{a},z^{t})$ vacancies that meet $\\lambda(x^{a},z^{t})V(x^{a},z^{t})$ unemployed workers in a particular submarket. We summarize a solution to the planning problem by a vector $(\\mathbf{N},\\mathbf{L},\\mathbf{V},\\lambda,\\mathbf{s},\\delta)$ , with ${\\bf N}=(N(x^{a},z^{t}))_{a,t\\geq0}$ etc.  \n\n## 4.2  Characterization of the Planning Solutions  \n\nThere is a convenient characterization of a planning solution which says that exit, layoff, and hiring decisions follow a recursive equation at the level of the individual firm. Let $\\beta^{t}\\psi(z^{t})\\mu(z^{t})\\geq$ 0 be the multiplier on the resource constraint (15) in history node $z^{t}$ . Intuitively, $\\mu(z^{t})$ is the social value of a worker in history $z^{t}$ . Let $G_{t}(L,x,z^{t})$ denote the social value of an existing firm with employment stock $L$ , idiosyncratic productivity $x$ and aggregate productivity history $z^{t}$ The sequence $G_{t}$ obeys the recursive equations  \n\n$$\n\\therefore,x,z^{t})=\\operatorname*{max}_{\\delta,s,V,\\lambda}(1-\\delta)\\Bigg\\{x z_{t}F(\\hat{L})-b\\hat{L}-\\mu(z^{t})[(1-s)L+\\lambda V]-C(V,(1-s)L,x,z^{t})\\Bigg\\}.\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}{\\lefteqn{\\cup_{t\\mid L,\\lambda,\\zeta,\\lambda^{\\prime}}\\mathrm{-}\\jmath_{\\mathrm{mint},\\lambda^{\\prime}}(\\lambda^{-}\\delta)}\\Bigg\\{\\underset{\\delta\\in X}{\\scriptscriptstyle\\downarrow}\\chi_{t+1\\mid L}\\mathrm{-}\\jmath_{\\mathrm{L}}-\\mu_{\\mathrm{L}}-\\jmath_{\\mathrm{U}}(\\lambda)\\psi(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1}\\mid\\boldsymbol{z}_{t})G_{t+1}(\\lambda,\\boldsymbol{\\hat{x}},\\boldsymbol{z}^{t+1})\\Bigg\\}}\\ &{}&{\\qquad-\\boldsymbol{f}+\\beta\\sum_{\\boldsymbol{\\hat{x}}\\in X}\\sum_{\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1\\in Z}}\\pi(\\boldsymbol{\\hat{x}}\\vert\\boldsymbol{x})\\psi(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1}\\vert\\boldsymbol{z}_{t})G_{t+1}(\\boldsymbol{\\hat{L}},\\boldsymbol{\\hat{x}},\\boldsymbol{z}^{t+1}))\\Bigg\\}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{\\mathrm{s.t.}}&{\\hat{L}=(1-s)L+m(\\lambda)V,}\\ &{\\delta\\in[\\delta_{0},1],s\\in[s_{0},1],\\lambda\\ge0,V\\ge0.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe interpretation of these equations is rather straightforward. The planner wants a firm with characteristics $(L,x)$ to stay active in aggregate history $z^{t}$ whenever the term in braces is nonnegative, otherwise he sets $\\delta\\:=\\:1$ . The term in braces gives the value of an active firm. In the current period, this value encompasses the frm's output net of the opportunity cost of employment, net of fixed costs and recruitment costs, and net of the social cost of workers tied to the firm in this period; these workers include those that are retained from the previous period, namely $(1-s)L$ , and also $\\lambda V$ unemployed workers who aim to find a job at the firm (of which $m(\\lambda)V\\leq\\lambda V$ eventually find a job).  \n\n### Proposition 4:  \n\n(a) For given multipliers $\\mu(z^{t})$ , there ecist value functions $G_{t}:\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\times X\\times Z^{t+1}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ $t\\geq0$ ， satisfying the system of recursive equations $(16)$  \n\n(b) If $\\mathbf{X}=(\\mathbf{N},\\mathbf{L},\\mathbf{V},\\lambda,\\mathbf{s},\\delta)$ is a solution of the planning problem (14) with multipliers ${\\pmb\\mu}=$ $\\left(\\mu(\\boldsymbol{z}^{t})\\right)$ , then the corresponding firm policies also solve problem (16) and the complementaryslacknesscondition  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{x\\in X}\\pi_{0}(x)G_{t}(0,x,z^{t})\\leq K,N_{0}(z^{t})\\geq0\n$$  \n\nis satisfied for all $z^{t}$ . Conversely, if $\\mathbf{X}$ solves for every firm problem $(16)$ with multipliers $\\pmb{\\mu}$ ， and if condition (17) and the resource constraint (15) hold for all $z^{t}$ , then $\\mathbf{X}$ is a solution of the planning problem $(14)$  \n\nWhilst Proposition 4 is a useful characterization of planning solutions, it cannot be applied for computational purposes. The difficulty is that the multipliers $\\mu(z^{t})$ are non-stationary and depend on the initial firm distribution. However, a much more powerful characterization can be obtained under the provision that firm entry is positive in all states of the planning solution, so that the first inequality in (17) is binding. When this is the case, the firm-level value functions and the social value of a worker are independent of the frm distribution. This is our aggregatearbitrage property, which we discuss in the introduction and which relates to the concept of block recursivity introduced by Shi (2009) and Menzio and Shi (2009, 2010).  \n\nTo gain intuition for the independence from the distribution of existing frms, envision only a single period. The planner can assign unemployed workers either to existing firms or to new firms. If there are many existing firms, there are fewer workers left to be assigned to new firms. Nevertheless, the social value of any worker that is assigned to a new firm does not change: Each new firm has an optimal size, and if less workers are assigned to new firms, then proportionally less new firms will be created, leaving the marginal value of each worker unchanged. Therefore, as long as any new firms are created, efficient hiring by existing firms requires their marginal social benefit of hiring to be equal to the social benefit at the new firms. This logic extends to the case with many periods. A new firm today may also hire workers tomorrow, but its marginal social benefit of tomorrow's hires has to equal the marginal benefit of hiring at tomorrow's new firms, which depends on the next aggregate state but is again independent of the firm distribution. Thus, the social value of assigning a worker to any firm is tied to the social benefit created at new firms which depends on the aggregate state alone. While this ensures that job creation and destruction policies of individual firms are independent of the distribution of existing firms, the firm distribution does matter for the dynamics of aggregate labor market variables, such as the workers? job finding probability: If there are more existing firms, then more of the workers queue for their jobs and obtain a different probability of getting hired.  \n\nTo see the independence of value functions from the firm distribution formally, suppose there are $n$ aggregate states $z_{i}$ ， $i=1,\\dots,n$ ,and let $\\mu=(\\mu_{1},\\ldots,\\mu_{n})\\in\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}$ be a vector of social values in these states. Let $G^{\\imath}(L,x,\\mu)$ be the social value of a firm with employment stock $L$ , idiosyncratic productivity $x$ and aggregate productivity $z_{i}$ , for $i=1,\\ldots,n$ $G=(G^{\\i}):$ $\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\times X\\times\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}$ satisfy the Bellman equations  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l l}{{G^{i}(L,x,\\mu)~=~\\displaystyle{\\operatorname*{max}(1-\\delta)\\bigg\\lbrace x z_{i}F(\\hat{L})-b\\hat{L}-f-\\mu_{i}[(1-s)L+\\lambda V]}}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{\\qquad-C(V,L(1-s),x)+\\displaystyle{\\beta\\sum_{\\hat{x}\\in X}\\sum_{z_{j}\\in Z}\\pi(\\hat{x}|x)\\psi(z_{j}|z_{i})G^{j}(\\hat{L},x)^{2}}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere maximization is subject to the same constraints as in problem (16). Positive entry in all  \n\naggregate states requires that the expected social value of a new firm is equal to the entry cost,  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{x\\in X}\\pi_{0}(x)G^{i}(0,x,\\mu)=K.\n$$  \n\nThis characterization of planning solutions by $(G^{\\imath},\\mu_{i})_{i=1,\\ldots,n}$ is particularly helpful for numerical applications. Despite considerable firm heterogeneity, the model can be solved by a recursive problem on a low-dimensional state space (18) and the (simultaneous) solution of a finite dimensional fixed point problem (19). Importantly, the distribution of firms is irrelevant for this computation. After the corresponding policy functions have been calculated, the actual number of entrant firms $N_{0}(z^{t})$ is obtained as a residual of the economy's resource constraint in a simulation of the model, and thus it does depend on the distribution of existing firms. Therefore, the evolution of aggregate employment, output and job fows depend on the frm distribution as well.  \n\nAlthough it cannot be guaranteed that the planning solution has positive entry in all state histories, in quantitative applications this possibility should not be relevant. Analytically, we prove that any solution of (18)-(19) which gives rise to positive entry in all state histories coincides with a solution to the planner's problem. We also find that a unique solution of these equations exists for small aggregate shocks.  \n\n### Proposition 5:  \n\n(a)Suppose that a solution of (18) and (19) exists which defines an allocation $\\mathbf{X}=(\\mathbf{N},\\mathbf{L},\\mathbf{V},\\lambda,\\mathbf{s},\\delta)$ satisfying $N(z^{t})>0$ for all $z^{t}$ .Then $\\mathbf{X}$ is a solution of the planning problem (14).   \n(b) If $K$ ， $f$ , and b are suffciently small and if $z_{1}=...=z_{n}=z$ , equations $(1\\delta)$ and (19) have a unique solution $G(L,x,\\mu)$ with $\\mu_{1}=\\ldots=\\mu_{n}$ . Moreover, if the transition matrix $\\psi(z_{j}|z_{i})$ is strictly diagonally dominant and if $|z_{i}-z|$ is suffciently small for all $i$ ,equations (18) and (19) have a unique solution.  \n\n## 4.3  Recruitment and Layoff Strategies  \n\nThe reduction of the planning solution to problem (18) permits a straightforward characterization of the optimal layoff and hiring strategies. A firm with productivity $x$ and employment stock $L$ should dismiss workers (that is, $s>s_{0}$ )in state $i=1,\\ldots,n$ iff  \n\n$$\nx z_{i}F^{\\prime}(L(1-s_{0}))-b-\\mu_{i}+\\beta\\sum_{\\hat{x}}\\sum_{z_{j}}\\pi(\\hat{x}|x)\\psi(z_{j}|z_{i})G_{1}^{j}(L(1-s_{0}),\\hat{x},\\mu)<0.\n$$  \n\nThis expression is the marginal social surplus of a worker at the employment stock $L(1-s_{0})$ after worker turnover. If marginal worker surplus is negative, the firm lays off some workers until the marginal worker surplus is nil.  \n\nConversely, for the firm to recruit workers, it must be that $\\lambda>0$ and $V>0$ . In that case, it follows from the first-order conditions for $\\lambda$ and $V$ that26  \n\n$$\nC_{1}(V,L(1-s_{0}),x)=\\mu_{i}\\lambda\\Bigl({\\frac{m(\\lambda)}{\\lambda m^{\\prime}(\\lambda)}}-1\\Bigr).\n$$  \n\nAs in the previous section, it follows from concavity of $m$ and convexity of $C$ that there is an increasing relation between the worker-job ratio and the number of posted vacancies at the firm. With higher $\\lambda$ , the probability to fill a vacancy increases, and hence the planner is willing to post more vacancies at higher marginal recruiting cost. Denote the solution to equation (21) by $V=V_{i}(\\lambda,L,x)$ , which is positive for $\\lambda>\\underline{{\\lambda}}_{i}(L,x)$ . The planner's optimal choice of $\\lambda$ for firm $(L,x)$ in aggregate state $i$ satisfies  \n\n$$\nx z_{i}F^{\\prime}(\\hat{L})-b+\\beta\\sum_{\\hat{x}}\\sum_{z_{j}}\\pi(\\hat{x}|x)\\psi(z_{j}|z_{i})G_{1}^{j}(\\hat{L},\\hat{x},\\mu)=\\frac{\\mu_{i}}{m^{\\prime}(\\lambda)},\n$$  \n\nwith $\\hat{L}=L(1-s_{0})+m(\\lambda)V_{i}(\\lambda,L,x)$ .Therefore, the firm recruits workers,if and only if  \n\n$$\nx z_{i}F^{\\prime}(L(1-s_{0}))-b+\\beta\\sum_{\\hat{x}}\\sum_{z_{j}}\\pi(\\hat{x}|x)\\psi(z_{j}|z_{i})G_{1}^{j}(L(1-s_{0}),\\hat{x},\\mu)>\\frac{\\mu_{i}}{m^{\\prime}(\\lambda_{i}(L,x))G_{1}^{j}(\\lambda_{j},\\mu)}.\n$$  \n\nThe two conditions (20) and (22) illustrate how the frm's strategy depends on its characteristics $(L,x)$ . Small and productive firms recruit workers and grow, whereas large and unproductive firms dismiss workers and shrink. Depending on the functional forms of $C(.)$ and $m(.)$ ,there can also be an open set of characteristics where frms do not adjust their workforce.27 Similar patterns for employment adjustment are obtained in the models of Bentolila and Bertola (1990) and Elsby and Michaels (2010).  \n\n## 4.4 Decentralization  \n\nWe now describe a competitive search equilibrium and demonstrate that competitive search gives rise to the same allocation as the planning solution characterized in Proposition 4. Firms offer workers a sequence of state contingent wages, to be paid for the duration of the match. They also commit to cohort-specific and state-contingent separation probabilities. Contracts are contingent on the idiosyncratic productivity history of the firm at age $k$ ， $x^{k}$ , and on the aggregate state history $z^{t}$ at time $t$ . Formally, a contract offered by a firm of age $a$ at time $^{\\prime}I^{\\prime}$ takes the form  \n\n$$\n\\mathcal{C}_{a}=\\left(w_{a}(x^{k},z^{t}),\\varphi_{a}(x^{k},z^{t})\\right)_{k\\geq a,t=T+k-a},\n$$  \n\nwhere $w_{a}(x^{k},z^{t})$ is the wage paid to the worker in firm history $(x^{k},z^{t})$ , conditional on the worker being still employed by the firm in that instant. $\\varphi_{a}(x^{k},z^{t})\\geq\\delta_{0}+(1-\\delta_{0})s_{0}$ , for $k>a$ , is the probability of a job separation prior to the production stage in history $x^{k}$ . In the hiring period, a separation cannot occur, so $\\varphi_{a}(x^{a},z^{T})=0$ by definition.  \n\n### The Workers’ Search Problem  \n\nLet $U(z^{t})$ be the utility value of an unemployed worker in history $z^{t}$ , and let $W(\\mathcal{C}_{a},x^{k},z^{t})$ be the utility value of a worker hired by a firm of age $a$ in contract $\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{C}}_{a}$ who is currently employed at that frm in history $x^{k}$ , with $k\\geq a$ . The latter satisfies the recursive equation  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{W(\\mathcal{C}_{a},x^{k},z^{t})}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\varphi_{a}(x^{k},z^{t})U(z^{t})+(1-\\varphi_{a}(x^{k},z^{t}))\\Big[w_{a}(x^{k},z^{t})}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{\\displaystyle+\\beta\\sum_{x_{k+1}}\\sum_{z_{t+1}}\\pi(x_{k+1}|x_{k})\\psi(z_{t+1}|z_{t})W(\\mathcal{C}_{a},x^{k+1},z^{t+1})\\Big].}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nAn unemployed worker searches for contracts which promise the highest expected utility, considering that more attractive contracts are less likely to sign. The worker observes all contracts $\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{C}}_{a}$ and he knows that the probability to sign a contract is $m(\\lambda)/\\lambda$ when $\\lambda$ is the worker-job ratio in the submarket where the contract is offered. That is, potential submarkets are parameterized by the tuple $(\\lambda,\\mathcal{C}_{a})$ . Unemployed workers enter those submarkets where expected surplus is maximized:  \n\n$$\n\\rho(z^{t})=\\operatorname*{max}_{(\\lambda,\\mathcal{C}_{a})}\\frac{m(\\lambda)}{\\lambda}\\Big[W(\\mathcal{C}_{a},x^{a},z^{t})-b-\\beta E_{z_{t}}U(z^{t+1})\\Big]~.\n$$  \n\nBecause an unemployed worker gets one chance to search in every period, his Bellman equation reads as  \n\n$$\nU(z^{t})=b+\\rho(z^{t})+\\beta E_{z_{t}}U(z^{t+1})~.\n$$  \n\n### The Firms' Problem  \n\nA firm of age $a$ in history $(x^{a},z^{t})$ takes as given the employment stocks of workers hired in some earlier period, $(L_{\\tau})_{\\tau=0}^{a-1}$ , as well as the contracts signed with these workers, $({\\mathcal{C}}_{\\tau})_{\\tau=0}^{a-1}$ . The firm chooses an exit probability $\\delta$ and cohort-specific layoff probabilities $s_{\\tau}$ . For these probabilities to be consistent with separation probabilities specified in existing contracts, it must hold that $\\delta\\leq\\varphi_{\\tau}(x^{a},z^{t})$ for all $\\tau\\leq a-1$ , and $s_{\\tau}=1-(1-\\varphi_{\\tau}(x^{a},z^{t}))/(1-\\delta)$ when $\\delta<1$ , with arbitrary choice of $s_{\\tau}$ when $\\delta=1$ . The firm also decides new contracts $\\scriptstyle{C_{a}}$ to be posted in $V$ vacancies in a submarket with worker-job ratio $\\lambda$ . It is no restriction to presuppose that the firm offers only one type of contract and searches in only one submarket. When $J_{a}$ is the value function of a  \n\nfirm of age $a$ , the firm's problem is written as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}{J_{a}\\Big[(\\mathcal{C}_{\\tau})_{\\tau=0}^{a-1},(L_{\\tau})_{\\tau=0}^{a-1},x^{a},z^{t}\\Big]}&{=}&{\\underset{(\\delta,\\lambda,V,C_{a})}{\\operatorname*{max}}(1-\\delta)\\Bigg\\{x_{a}z_{t}F\\Big(\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{a}\\hat{L}_{\\tau}\\Big)-W-C(V,\\overline{{L}},}\\ &{}&{-f+\\beta E_{x_{a},z_{t}}J_{a+1}\\Big[(\\mathcal{C}_{\\tau})_{\\tau=0}^{a},(\\hat{L}_{\\tau})_{\\tau=0}^{a},x^{a+1},z^{t+1}\\Big]\\Bigg\\}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\hat{L}_{a}=m(\\lambda)V,\\lambda\\ge0,V\\ge0,\\hat{L}_{\\tau}=L_{\\tau}\\frac{1-\\varphi_{\\tau}\\left(x^{a},z^{t}\\right)}{1-\\delta},\\tau\\le a-1,}\\ &{\\delta\\in[\\delta_{0},\\displaystyle{\\operatorname*{min}_{0\\le\\tau\\le a-1}\\varphi_{\\tau}(x^{a},z^{t})]},s_{0}(1-\\delta)\\le\\left(1-\\varphi_{\\tau}(x^{a},z^{t})\\right),}\\ &{W=\\displaystyle{\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{a}w_{\\tau}(x^{a},z^{t})\\hat{L}_{\\tau}},\\overline{{L}}=\\displaystyle{\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{a-1}\\hat{L}_{\\tau}},}\\ &{W(\\mathcal{C}_{a},x^{a},z^{t})=b+\\beta E_{z_{t}}U(z^{t+1})+\\frac{\\lambda\\rho(z^{t})}{m(\\lambda)}\\mathrm{when}\\lambda>0.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe last condition is the workers' participation constraint; it specifies the minimum expected utility that contract $\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{C}}_{a}$ must promise in order to attract a worker queue of length $\\lambda$ per vacancy.  \n\nDefinition: A competitive search equilibrium is a list  \n\n$$\n{}^{t}),\\rho(z^{t}),\\mathcal{C}_{a}(x^{a},z^{t}),\\lambda(x^{a},z^{t}),V(x^{a},z^{t}),\\delta(x^{a},z^{t}),J_{a}(.),L_{\\tau}(x^{a},z^{t}),N(x^{a},z^{t}),N_{0}(z^{t},z^{t}),\n$$  \n\nfor all $t\\geq0$ ， $a\\geq0$ ， $x^{a}\\in X^{a+1}$ ， $z^{t}\\in Z^{t+1}$ ， $0\\leq\\tau\\leq a$ , and for a given initial frm distribution, such that  \n\n(a) Firms’ exit, hiring and layoff strategies are optimal.

Given risk neutrality, the firm can set the wages following any future history exactly equal to the reservation wage which is the sum of unemployment income and the worker's shadow value $b+\\mu(z^{t})$ . It can achieve any initial transfer to attract workers through a hiring bonus. In this decentralization, the costs of an existing worker are always equal to his social value in the alternative: unemployment and search for another job. Since the fow surplus for any retained worker equals his shadow value, the frm's problem in this case coincides with the planner's problem (16), so that firing and exiting will be exactly up to the socially optimal level even though the firm does not commit to separation rates. Workers do not have any incentive to quit the job unilaterally, either, because they are exactly compensated for their social shadow value from searching.  \n\nSimilarly, given employment commitment the wage-tenure profiles for individual workers are arbitrary because of risk-neutrality. As we show in the proof of Proposition 6, firms do not need to discriminate in separation rates between workers in different cohorts. Nonetheless, such equilibria are also possible; then workers with higher separation rates will be compensated through higher wage transfers, whereas workers with more stable jobs earn lower wages. Put differently, this model cannot say anything about individual wage-tenure profiles. It only pins down the surplus split between workers and firms.  \n\nIn our numerical examples, we consider the benchmark case where wage profiles are not dispersed within the firm. That is, all workers within firm $(L,x)$ in history $z^{t}$ earnthe same flowwage $w(L,x,z^{t})$ . In a competitive search equilibrium, such a wage profile can be easily calculated using (23) and condition (30).  \n\n# 5 A Calibrated Example  \n\nWe study the implications of this model by calibrating it to the U.S. labor market. The calibration proceeds in two steps. First, we choose model parameters to match selected long-run features of the U.S. labor market. Second, we feed this model with aggregate productivity shocks replicating the standard deviation and persistence of empirical labor productivity. For illustration purposes we adopt as basic a specification as possible for the firm productivity process and for the vacancy cost function, even though in their general form they allow substantial additional degrees of freedom whose exploration might be useful in future applications.  \n\nWe choose the period length to be one month and set $\\beta=0.996$ so that the annual interest rate is about 5 percent. We assume a CES matching function $m(\\lambda)=(1+k\\lambda^{-r})^{-1/r}$ and set the two parameters $k$ and $r$ to target a monthly job-finding rate of 0.45 (Shimer (2005b)) and an elasticity of the job-finding rate with respect to the vacancy-unemployment ratio of 0.5 which belongs within the range of reasonable values reported in Petrongolo and Pissarides (2001). Since we also target the aggregate vacancy-unemployment ratio at $1/\\lambda=0.72$ , we calculate the parameters $k$ and $r$ to attain the two targets at $\\lambda=1/0.72$  \n\nTable 1: Parameter choices.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Parameter</td><td>Value</td><td>Description</td><td>Target</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.996</td><td>Discount factor</td><td>Annual interest rate 5%</td></tr><tr><td>k</td><td>1.623</td><td>Matching fct. scale</td><td>Job-finding rate</td></tr><tr><td>r</td><td>1.475</td><td>Matching fct. elasticity</td><td>Pissarides and Petrongolo (2001)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.7</td><td>Prod. fct. elasticity</td><td>Labor share</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>0.1</td><td>Vacancy cost parameter</td><td>Hiring cost 14% of quarterly wage</td></tr><tr><td>Xmin</td><td>0.31</td><td>Lowest productivity</td><td>Firm size (mean relative to min)</td></tr><tr><td>T</td><td>0.65</td><td>Transition probability</td><td>Job-creation rate</td></tr><tr><td>b</td><td>0.2</td><td>Flow value of leisure</td><td>Vacancy-unemployment ratio = 0.72</td></tr><tr><td>K</td><td>13.09</td><td>Entry cost</td><td>Job creation at opening firms</td></tr><tr><td>f</td><td>0.6</td><td>Flow operating cost</td><td>Job destruction at closing firms</td></tr><tr><td>80</td><td>0.0011</td><td>Exogenous exit rate</td><td>Job destruction at closing large firms</td></tr><tr><td>S0</td><td>0.02</td><td>Quit rate</td><td>Monthly quit rate</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThe production technology is Cobb-Douglas with $x L^{\\alpha}$ and a simple Markov process for idiosyncratic productivity. Particularly, we let idiosyncratic productivity attain one of ten equally distant values in the range $[x_{m i n},1]$ , uniformly drawn upon entry. The transition process is such that idiosyncratic productivity changes from one month to the next with probability $\\pi$ and switches to a neighboring state with identical probabilities. Parameter $\\alpha$ is set to 0.7 which gives rise to a labor share of 2/3.The parameters $x_{m i n}$ and $\\pi$ are chosen to match two targets. Given that labor is a continuous variable in our model, we identify the labor input of one worker with the minimum firm size in the sample distribution, and we target the ratio between the mean frm size and the minimum firm size at 21.6, which is the average number of workers per frm in the Business and Employment Dynamics (BED) data set of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Second, we target quarterly firm-level rates of job creation and job destruction of around 6.5% which is the average in BED data for the period 1990-2005, see Helfand, Sadeghi, and Talan (2007).  \n\nWe deliberately choose a quadratic vacancy cost function $C(V)=c V^{2}$ and we set parameter $c$ so that recruiting cost per hire are about 14 percent of quarterly wage income, following Hall and Milgrom (2008) and Elsby and Michaels (2010). We set the opportunity cost of employment (parameter $b$ ) to target a vacancy-unemployment ratio of 0.72 which is the number chosen by Pissarides (2009), based on the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). We set the entry cost parameter $K$ and the operating fow cost parameter $f$ to target the extensive margins of job creation and job destruction. Based on BED data between 1990 and 2005, 16.6% of all quarterly job gains occur at opening frms and 17.2% of all job losses occur at closing firms (see Helfand, Sadeghi, and Talan (2007)).28 With this choice of parameters, all firms with the lowest idiosyncratic productivity $x=x_{m i n}$ leave the market, whereas all others stay. By implication, only the smallest frms (those at the lowest four productivity levels) can make a transition to the lowest productivity state (and thus leave the market) from one quarter to the next. Nonetheless, in BED data 0.33 percent of jobs are lost at firms whose employment is larger than mean employment (i.e. 20 workers or more). Hence we set the exogenous monthly exit rate at $\\delta_{0}=0.0011$ to account for job destruction at exiting larger firms. The exogenous worker quit rate is set at $s_{0}=0.02$ , which is roughly the monthly quit rate in JOLTS (Davis, Faberman, and Haltiwanger (2006)). Table 1 summarizes these parameter choices.  \n\nDue to the non-linearity of the model, we cannot match all targets exactly, but the fit is rather close (see Table 2). The job-finding rate is a bit lower than the target which is due to the fact that the matching function is concave and vacancy-unemployment ratios are dispersed acrosssubmarkets.  \n\nFigure 2 shows value and policy functions (separations and recruitment policies) for firms in the nine active productivity states $x>x_{m i n}$ . These policy functions confirm the insights from Section 3: conditional on size, more productive firms advertise more vacancies and fill any of them with a higher rate. And conditional on productivity, smaller firms recruit faster and create more jobs. The figure also shows that, for any productivity, there is a range of employment  \n\nTable 2: Data moments and model statistics.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variable</td><td>Data</td><td>Model</td></tr><tr><td>Job-creation rate (quarterly)</td><td>6.7%</td><td>6.9%</td></tr><tr><td>Job-destruction rate (quarterly)</td><td>6.3%</td><td>6.9%</td></tr><tr><td>Labor share</td><td>0.67</td><td>0.68</td></tr><tr><td>Workers per firm</td><td>21.6</td><td>21.3</td></tr><tr><td>Hiring cost (share of quart. wage)</td><td>0.14</td><td>0.14</td></tr><tr><td>Share of JC at openings (quarterly)</td><td>16.6%</td><td>17.5%</td></tr><tr><td>Share of JD at closings s (quarterly)</td><td>17.2%</td><td>16.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Vacancy-unemployment ratio</td><td>0.72</td><td>0.72</td></tr><tr><td>Job-finding rate (monthly)</td><td>45%</td><td>44%</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNotes: The model statistics are calculated as a stationary frm distribution obtained from a simulation of 10000 entrant firms where each firm is subject to the idiosyncratic shock process and exits at productivity $x=x_{m i n}$ This gives a total of about $8\\cdot10^{5}$ observations.  \n\nlevels where firms neither shed workers nor recruit new workers, and hence shrink by the natural turnover $s_{0}L$  \n\nIn a simulated stationary frm distribution, we find positive relations between firm growth and the two means of recruitment, vacancy postings and vacancy fill rates. The two relationships are shown in Figure $3(\\mathrm{a})$ for the vacancy rate (i.e., vacancies as a share of employment) and in Figure 3(b) for the monthly job-filling rate (hires per vacancy). Qualitatively, these graphs correspond to the findings of Davis, Faberman, and Haltiwanger (2010) who also document a positive relationship between employer growth, the monthly vacancy rate and the job-filling rate in JOLTS data. In their study, vacancy postings seem to play a smaller role in accounting for differences in employment growth, whereas they are a more important factor in our simulation. As discussed earlier, convexity in the recruitment technology is the key factor for a positive relationship between firm growth and job-filling rates; with a linear recruitment technology, this relationship disappears.29  \n\nThe model performs reasonably well in matching the dispersion of employment growth rates across frms. Using the Longitudinal Business Database (1992-2005), Davis, Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda (2006) obtain a cross-sectional dispersion (employment-weighted standard deviation) of annual employment growth rates for continuing firms of 0.37 (see Figure 8 in their paper). In our simulated stationary distribution, this dispersion measure is somewhat larger at 0.44. Table 3 also shows that the model does a good job in matching the distribution of employment growth rates.  \n\n![](images/1d142fe510d717db7c9e02289bf1b7efa3aca9532447fa89b4958d4dd46de175.jpg)  \nFigure 2: The frms′ value functions (upper left), and the policy functions for separation rates $s$ (upper right), for vacancies (lower left), and for job-filling rates $m(\\lambda)$ (lower right).  \n\nBecause our calibration of idiosyncratic productivity does not target the cross-sectional employment distribution, it does not replicate the large variance and skewness of the firm-size distribution. Nonetheless, when we rank firms along the percentiles in the employment distribution, the model reproduces the negative relation between firm size (as measured by the rank in the size distribution) and rates of job creation and job destruction, and it also captures the negative relation between firm size and the rates of job creation and destruction at the extensive margin; see Figure 5.  \n\nWe can also compare wages between firms, using the wage profiles where all workers within a firm earn the same. We find that wage dispersion across firms is rather small, with a standard deviation of log wages equal to $3.6\\%$ , in line with other work that abstracts from on-the-job search Notes: The table reports employment shares for intervals of quarterly employment growth rates. The empirical distribution is taken from Table 2 of Davis, Faberman, Haltiwanger, and Rucker (2008). The model statistics are calculated from a stationary firm distribution with $8\\cdot10^{5}$ observations.  \n\n![](images/734f8730f1fa90445b88d7fbb9296031775646f2a3a700e1d8c01abd43c6c975.jpg)  \nFigure 3: Vacancy rates (vacancies relative to employment) and job-filling rates (monthly hires per vacancy) across firm growth rates.

The model does link wage dispersion to firm size and firm growth. For instance, the wage difference between firms with log employment one standard deviation above average to those with log employment one standard deviation below average is 2.5% percent. Differences in firm growth account for more variation in wages: the differential between wages at firms that grow by more than 20 percent and those that do not grow or shrink is 6.7 percent (almost two standard deviations).  \n\n![](images/3c25be5311df2ec7d576b8bef82ef7ee0861c25a52fd8d395af139cca6bc4191.jpg)  \nFigure 4: Quarterly job creation and job destruction rates (total and extensive margins) across firm sizes (percentiles of the employment distribution). Notes: The dashed curves are based on the nine reported firm-size classes in the BED. The solid curves are calculated from a simulated firm distribution with $8\\cdot10^{5}$ observations and 20 equally spaced intervals of the employment distribution. When firms change size classes, job fows are attributed according to the dynamic-size allocation of the BLS (see Moscarini and Postel-Vinay (2009).  \n\nTo explore the impact of aggregate shocks, we first compute the model's impulse response to a permanent productivity increase. We find that our model accounts for a sluggish response of labor market aggregates. In a reduced-form vector autoregression, Fujita and Ramey (2007) show that the vacancy-unemployment ratio is much more persistent than labor productivity and that productivity shocks propagate gradually to market tightness and employment. Fujita and Ramey (2007) and Shimer (2005b) argue that standard search and matching models cannot replicate this pattern because market tightness is a jump variable which correlates perfectly with aggregate productivity. Our model with heterogenous firms and convex recruitment costs yields some propagation of unemployment and vacancies. Figure 5 shows the impulse response to a permanent one-percent increase in aggregate labor productivity. As higher productivity makes entry more attractive, wages must rise sufficiently to balance the gains from entry to its cost. We find that the reservation wage rises by 1.4% (and hence by more than productivity) which implies that optimal firm size falls, which induces a larger number of firms to enter. The impact response to the productivity and wage increase is that existing firms shed some of their workers so that unemployment rises in the frst quarter.30 Over time, however, more and more firms enter and vacancies rise gradually to a higher level, following a hump-shaped pattern. After the first three months, unemployment sluggishly declines to a permanently lower level. Figure 5(c) also shows that the job-finding rate responds only gradually to the aggregate productivity shock. After the initial decline (due to the rise in unemployment), the job-finding rate takes about a year to adjust to the permanently higher level. We emphasize again that this sluggish response is entirely driven by the convex recruitment costs at the firm level. With linear vacancy costs, the job finding rate would immediately jump to its new steady-state level.31 This result is different from Elsby and Michaels (2010) who obtain a less sluggish response of the job-finding rate in a random search model with linear recruitment costs. It also crucially differs from the competitive search model with linear vacancy costs of Schaal (2010) who finds that the job-finding rate is a jump variable.  \n\nTo study the model's business cycle properties, we presuppose that entry is positive in all periods and solve the model as explained in Section 4.2. Aggregate productivity attains five equally distant values in the interval $[z_{m i n},2-z_{m i n}]$ , and the Markov process for $z$ is a meanreverting process with transition probability $\\psi$ , as described in Appendix C of Shimer (2005b). The two parameters $(z_{m i n},\\psi)$ are set to target a quarterly standard deviation and autocorrelation of labor productivity around trend of 0.02 and 0.85. Starting from a stationary firm distribution, we simulate the evolution of these firms over 2000 months, using the policy functions from the numerical solution of (18) and (19). In every simulation period, the number of frm entrants is obtained as a residual of the economy's resource constraint. We compare two calibrations. In the first, the entry cost $K$ does not vary with aggregate productivity. With this specification, firm entry turns out to be more than 10 times as volatile as in the data. Therefore, we consider a second calibration where the entry costs are allowed to vary procyclically to match the empirical standard deviation of job creation at opening frms.32 To match this target, we set the elasticity of $K$ with respect to $z$ to 0.44.  \n\nTable 4 shows the outcome of this exercise for volatility and comovement with aggregate output. For both calibrations, the model clearly has too low amplification: all labor market variables are less volatile than in the data, as is the case in Shimer's (2005b) calibration of the search and matching model with homogeneous (constant return) firms and socially efficient job creation. One way to understand low amplification is the gap between productivity and the opportunity cost of work; the larger this gap is, the smaller should be the response of job creation to productivity shocks (see Hagedorn and Manovskii (2008), Hall and Milgrom (2008)). In fact, in our calibration, aggregate labor productivity (which is obviously identical to the employmentweighted average product of labor across firms) is 0.45 and the employment-weighted marginal product is 0.315, so that the opportunity cost of work (parameter $b$ )is just 44% of average product and 66% of marginal product. When we double parameter $b$ to 0.4 (and adjust the operating cost to $f=0.19$ so as to make sure that again only firms with $x=x_{m i n}$ leave the market), average firm size falls, the average and marginal products of labor increase (albeit by a factor less than two), so that $b$ is at $55\\%$ of average product and at 78% of marginal product. In the calibration with variable entry costs, the relative volatility of the vacancy-unemployment ratio nearly doubles (from 1.2 to 2.1). In alternative search and matching models with large firms and intra-firm bargaining, Krause and Lubik (2007) and Faccini and Ortigueira (2010) also find little amplification of neutral technology shocks, whereas Elsby and Michaels (2010)  \n\n![](images/759bff12fa08ddf16d2acc0d2fa323b700421caa764c21aee8859723216142dd.jpg)  \nFigure 5: Impulse response to a permanent $1\\%$ increase in aggregate labor productivity. The graphs show the average response of 600 simulated model responses where each simulation starts from a cross-section of $4\\cdot10^{5}$ firms.  \n\nobtain more volatility. Their models differ from ours in several dimensions. Which of those is the reason for the variation between the results remains the subject of future research.  \n\nDespite low amplification, our model generates a correlation pattern with aggregate output which is consistent with the data. On the one hand, the model captures a downward-sloping Beveridge curve, that is, a strong negative comovement of unemployment and vacancies. This is despite the feature that job destruction is endogenous in this model. On the other hand, in the calibration with procyclical entry costs, the job-finding rate is strongly procyclical and more volatile than the separation rate which correlates negatively with output.  \n\nTable 4: Business cycle statistics   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">Data</td><td colspan=\"2\">Model (Fixed entry cost)</td><td colspan=\"2\">Model (Variable entry cost)</td></tr><tr><td>Relative</td><td>Corr.</td><td>Relative</td><td>Corr.</td><td>Relative</td><td>Corr.</td></tr><tr><td>Productivity</td><td>volatility 0.764</td><td>w. output 0.686</td><td>volatility 0.969</td><td>w. output 0.999</td><td>volatility 0.964</td><td>w.output 0.999</td></tr><tr><td>Unemployment rate</td><td>7.665</td><td>-0.888</td><td>0.948</td><td>-0.464</td><td>0.544</td><td>-0.918</td></tr><tr><td>Vacancies</td><td>7.333</td><td>0.762</td><td>1.016</td><td>0.949</td><td>0.715</td><td>0.984</td></tr><tr><td>Job-finding rate</td><td>4.398</td><td>0.819</td><td>0.568</td><td>0.842</td><td>0.446</td><td>0.995</td></tr><tr><td>Separation rate</td><td>2.685</td><td>-0.646</td><td>0.537</td><td>0.051</td><td>0.104</td><td>-0.252</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNotes: All variables are logged and HP filtered with parameter $10^{5}$ .

Data are for the U.S. labor market (1948Q1-2007Q1, Vacancies: 1951Q1-2006Q3); the job-finding rate and separation rate series were constructed by Robert Shimer (see Shimer (2007) and his webpage http: / /sites.google.com/site/robertshimer/research/fows).

Monthly series are converted into quarterly series by time averaging.  \n\n# 6 Conclusion  \n\nThe introduction of multi-worker firms into labor-search models bridges the separate literatures on firm dynamics and labor market frictions. It has the potential to address issues in both fields, and most importantly to create new insights into the interplay between firm heterogeneity, worker and job fows, and the levels and fuctuations in employment. This particular project proposes a wage formation process for such environments that incorporates standard competitive elements adjusted for the fact that search frictions prevent perfect market clearing. The model turns out to be tractable, it matches several stylized facts regarding firm growth, pay and recruitment strategies, and it implements socially efficient allocations both in and out of steady state. It can be viewed as a benchmark against which to judge actual labor market allocations.  \n\nTo conclude, it is worthwhile to note that this framework is fexible for extensions. On the one hand, it is easy to allow for variable capital investment, as long as the firm-level production functions retain decreasing returns in all variable inputs. On the other hand, it is straightforward to introduce worker heterogeneity provided that vacancies are specific to the type of worker that the firm searches for.3 An extension along this line would yield insights into the sorting of different worker types across heterogeneous firms and the interactions between the employment dynamics of different worker types. Another interesting extension concerns the emergence of endogenous worker heterogeneity due to on-the-job learning. When workers build up human capital on the job, firms (and the planner) are no longer indifferent between firing workers with longer or with shorter job tenure, as they are in this paper. Workers hired in later stages of a firm's life must then be compensated for the higher risk of job loss in the event of a downturn.  \n\nA further extension is to allow for risk aversion and incomplete markets in our framework. In constant-return environments with exogenous separation rates, Acemoglu and Shimer (1999a) and Rudanko (2010) introduce long-term contracting and analyze the implications for risk sharing, unemployment insurance and labor market dynamics. Our model with exogenous separations could also be augmented along these lines. If workers are risk averse and have no access to capital markets, risk neutral frms offer fat wage contracts. Similar to our exposition in Section 3, firms solve a recursive problem subject to a workers? participation constraint which takes into account $u(w)$ insteadof $w$ . But different from our results, equilibrium ceases to be socially efficient, provided that the planner is allowed to redistribute income to the unemployed. Lack of unemployment insurance induces workers to search too much for low-paying but easyto-get jobs (as in Acemoglu and Shimer (1999a)), and should lead to excess employment in low-productivity firms and therefore to a misallocation of labor between heterogeneous firms. Overall, the current setup still provides the relevant benchmark: if perfect risk sharing is available, workers care only about expected income values as analyzed in this paper and competitive search equilibrium achieves socially efficient firm dynamics.  \n\n# Appendix  \n\nProof of Proposition 1:  Note that our cost function fulfills the conditions $C_{1}>0$ ， $C_{11}>0$ ， $C_{12}\\leq0$ , and $C_{13}\\geq0$ ,and that $x F(L)-C(V,L,x)$ is concave in $(V,L)$ and supermodular in $(L,x)$ . Additional requirements that are listed in Lemma 2 below are also satisfied for our cost function.  \n\nThe observation that the firm's objective and constraints in problem (3) are separable in $L$ and $W$ and linear in $W$ suggests that the value function takes the form $J^{x}(L,W)=$ $-B W+G(L,x;\\rho)$ for some constant $B>0$ . The envelope condition with respect to $W$ yields  \n\n$$\nB=1+\\beta(1-\\eta)B,\n$$  \n\nwhich implies $B=1/[1-\\beta(1-\\eta)]$ . Further, $G(L,x;\\rho)$ satisfies the recursive problem  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{\\mathfrak{x}(L,x;\\rho)}&{\\:=\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{max}_{(\\lambda,V)\\geq0}x F(L)-C(V,L,x)-\\beta[\\lambda\\rho+(1-\\delta)B m(\\lambda)R(\\rho)]V+\\beta(1}\\ &{\\:\\mathrm{s.t.}\\:\\hat{L}=L(1-s)+m(\\lambda)V,V\\geq0,}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $R(\\rho)$ makes explicit that the reservation value $R$ depends on $\\rho$ via (1). This problem is equivalently defined on a compact state space $L\\in[0,\\overline{{L}}]$ where $\\bar{L}$ is so large that it never binds. This is possible because of the Inada condition $\\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname*{lim}_{L\\to\\infty}F^{\\prime}(L)=0}\\end{array}$ . The RHS in problem (34) defines an operator $T$ which maps a continuous function $G_{0}(L,x;\\rho)$ , defined on $[0,\\overline{{L}}]\\times[0,\\overline{{x}}]\\times[0,\\overline{{\\rho}}]$ into a continuous function $G_{1}(L,x;\\rho)~=~T(G_{0})(L,x;\\rho)$ defined on the same domain. This operator is a contraction and it maps functions which are increasing in $L$ and $x$ and decreasing in $\\rho$ into functions with the same property. Moreover, the fixed point must be decreasing in $\\rho$ and strictly increasing in $x$ , which follows from differentiation of $G$ with respect to $\\rho$ and $x$ . Differentiability follows from straightforward application of the approach by Benveniste and Scheinkman.  \n\nTo prove concavity and supermodularity of the value function, we rewrite (34) in terms of hirings $H=m(\\lambda)V$ , noting that for a given level of hiring only the second and third term on the right hand side of (34) depend on the remaining choice variables and capture the hiring costs. Dropping argument $\\rho$ from $G$ , we can equivalently write (34) as  \n\n$$\nG(L,x)=\\operatorname*{max}_{H}x F(L)-{\\mathcal{C}}(H,L,x)+\\beta(1-\\delta)G(L(1-s)+H,x)\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\mathcal{C}(H,L,x)~\\equiv~\\operatorname*{min}_{\\lambda}C\\Bigl(\\frac{H}{m(\\lambda)},L,x\\Bigr)+\\beta(1-\\delta)B R H+\\beta\\rho\\frac{\\lambda}{m(\\lambda)}H~.\n$$  \n\nAs will become clear, the per period return $x F(L)-{\\mathcal{C}}(H,L,x)$ is supermodular in $(L,H)$ but for $h>0$ (which implies $C_{13}>0$ )strictly submodular in $(H,x)$ and in $(\\hat{L},x)$ when one writes  \n\n$H=\\hat{L}-(1-s)L$ , which renders standard tools to prove supermodularity (e.g., Amir (1996)) inapplicable. To proceed, the optimality condition for problem (36) is  \n\n$$\nC_{1}\\Bigl(\\frac{H}{m(\\lambda)},L,x\\Bigr)=\\beta\\rho\\frac{m(\\lambda)-\\lambda m^{\\prime}(\\lambda)}{m^{\\prime}(\\lambda)}.\n$$  \n\nDifferentiate this equation to obtain  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{\\displaystyle\\frac{d\\lambda}{d H}}&{=}&{\\displaystyle\\frac{C_{11}}{C_{11}H\\frac{m^{\\prime}}{m}-\\frac{\\beta\\rho m^{\\prime}m^{2}}{(m^{\\prime})^{2}}}>0,}\\ {\\displaystyle\\frac{d\\lambda}{d L}}&{=}&{\\displaystyle\\frac{C_{12}m}{C_{11}H\\frac{m^{\\prime}}{m}-\\frac{\\beta\\rho m^{\\prime\\prime}m^{2}}{(m^{\\prime})^{2}}}=\\frac{C_{12}m}{C_{11}}\\frac{d\\lambda}{d H}\\leq0,}\\ {\\displaystyle\\frac{d\\lambda}{d x}}&{=}&{\\displaystyle\\frac{C_{13}m}{C_{11}H\\frac{m^{\\prime}}{m}-\\frac{\\beta\\rho m^{\\prime\\prime}m^{2}}{(m^{\\prime})^{2}}}=\\frac{C_{13}m}{C_{11}}\\frac{d\\lambda}{d H}\\geq0.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nTherefore, we can express the derivatives of cost function $\\mathit{c}$ as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{{C}_{1}}&{=\\frac{\\beta\\rho}{m^{\\prime}(\\lambda)}+\\beta(1-\\delta)B R,}\\ {{C}_{2}}&{={C}_{2},}\\ {{C}_{11}}&{=-\\frac{\\beta\\rho m^{\\prime}}{(m^{\\prime})^{2}d H}=\\frac{{C}_{11}}{{C}_{12}m}{C}_{12}>0,}\\ {{C}_{12}}&{=-\\frac{\\beta\\rho m^{\\prime}}{(m^{\\prime})^{2}d L}\\leq0,}\\ {{C}_{22}}&{={C}_{22}-{C}_{11}\\frac{H m^{\\prime}}{m^{2}}\\frac{d\\lambda}{d L}={C}_{22}-\\frac{{C}_{11}^{2}}{{C}_{11}}+\\frac{m{C}_{12}}{{C}_{11}}{C}_{12},}\\ {{C}_{13}}&{=-\\frac{\\beta\\rho m^{\\prime}}{(m^{\\prime})^{2}d L}\\frac{d\\lambda}{\\mathrm{C}_{13}}{C}_{12}\\geq0,}\\ {{C}_{23}}&{={C}_{23}-{C}_{12}\\frac{H m^{\\prime}}{m^{2}}\\frac{d\\lambda}{d L}={C}_{23}-\\frac{{C}_{12}}{{C}_{11}}\\Big[{C}_{13}-m{C}_{13}\\Big].}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nLemma 1: The recursive problem (35) defines a value function $G(L,x)$ which is  \n\na concave in $L$ if the following condition holds:  \n\n$$\n\\mathcal{C}_{12}^{2}+\\mathcal{C}_{11}[x F^{\\prime\\prime}-\\mathcal{C}_{22}]\\leq0.\n$$  \n\n(b) supermodular in $(x,L)$ if the following condition holds:  \n\n$$\n\\mathcal{C}_{12}\\mathcal{C}_{13}+\\mathcal{C}_{11}[F^{\\prime}-\\mathcal{C}_{23}]\\geq0.\n$$  \n\n### Lemma 2:  \n\n(a)  Condition (46) holds under the following condition on the original cost function $C$  \n\n$$\nC_{12}^{2}+C_{11}[x F^{\\prime\\prime}-C_{22}]\\leq0.\n$$  \n\n(b)Condition (47) holds under the following condition on the original cost function $C$  \n\n$$\nC_{12}C_{13}+C_{11}[F^{\\prime}-C_{23}]\\ge0.\n$$  \n\nProof of Lemma 1: Write (35) as $G(L,x)=(T G)(L,x)$ where $T$ is an operator mapping continuous functions on $[0,\\overline{{L}}]\\times R_{+}$ into another continuous function on the same domain, which has the same properties as the one described above.  \n\nPart (a).

The second term is zero when $h=0$ , and negative but small if $h$ is small. Thus, $d$ JCR/ $(d x)$ is positive if $h$ is sufficiently small.  \n\nDifferentiation of the job-creation rate with respect to $L$ implies  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{d\\mathrm{JCR}}{d L}}=m^{\\prime}{\\frac{d\\lambda^{x}}{d L}}{\\frac{V^{x}}{L}}+{\\frac{m(\\lambda^{x})}{L}}{\\frac{d V^{x}}{d L}}+{\\frac{m(\\lambda^{x})}{L}}{\\frac{d V^{x}}{d\\lambda}}{\\frac{d\\lambda^{x}}{d L}}-m{\\frac{V^{x}}{L^{2}}}.\n$$  \n\nIn this expression, the frst, the third and the fourth term are strictly negative. The second term is zero when $h=0$ , and positive but small if $h$ is small. Thus, $d\\mathrm{JCR}/(d L)$ is negative if $h$ is sufficiently small. 口  \n\nLemma 3: Equation (7) has a unique steady state solution $\\lambda^{*}>0$ if, and only if,  \n\n$$\nh<\\frac{\\beta(1-\\delta)\\overline{{{m}}}}{1-\\beta(1-\\eta)},\n$$  \n\nwith $\\begin{array}{r}{\\overline{{m}}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\lambda\\to\\infty}m(\\lambda)-\\lambda m^{\\prime}(\\lambda)>0}\\end{array}$ . Under this condition, any sequence $\\lambda_{t}>0$ satisfying this equation converges to $\\lambda^{*}$  \n\nProof of Lemma 3: A steady state $\\lambda^{*}$ must satisfy the condition  \n\n$$\n\\beta\\rho[m(\\lambda)-\\lambda m^{\\prime}(\\lambda)]=\\frac{\\rho h[1-\\beta(1-\\eta)]}{1-\\delta}+[R h+c]m^{\\prime}(\\lambda).\n$$  \n\nThe LHS is strictly increasing and goes from $0$ to $\\beta\\rho\\overline{{m}}$ as $\\lambda$ goes from $0$ to $+\\infty$ . The RHS is decreasing in $\\lambda$ with limit $\\rho h(1-\\beta(1-\\eta))/(1-\\delta)$ for $\\lambda\\to\\infty$ . Hence, a unique steady state $\\lambda^{*}$ exists iff (57) holds. Furthermore, differentiation of (7) at $\\lambda^{*}$ implies that  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\lambda_{t+1}}{d\\lambda_{t}}\\Big|_{\\lambda^{*}}=\\frac{h}{\\beta(1-\\delta)m(\\lambda^{*})+h\\beta(1-\\eta)},\n$$  \n\nwhich is positive and smaller than one iff  \n\n$$\nh<\\frac{\\beta(1-\\delta)m(\\lambda^{*})}{1-\\beta(1-\\eta)}.\n$$  \n\nBut this inequality must be true because (58) implies  \n\n$$\nh=\\displaystyle\\frac{\\beta\\rho[m(\\lambda^{*})-\\lambda^{*}m^{\\prime}(\\lambda^{*})]-c m^{\\prime}(\\lambda^{*})}{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\rho[1-\\beta(1-\\eta)]}{1-\\delta}+R m^{\\prime}(\\lambda^{*})}<\\displaystyle\\frac{\\beta(1-\\delta)m(\\lambda^{*})}{1-\\beta(1-\\eta)}.\n$$  \n\nTherefore, the steady state $\\lambda^{*}$ is locally stable. Moreover, equation (7) defines a continuous, increasing relation between $\\lambda_{t+1}$ and $\\lambda_{t}$ which has only one intersection with the 45-degree line. Hence, $\\lambda_{t+1}>\\lambda_{t}$ for any ${\\lambda}_{t}<{\\lambda}^{*}$ and $\\lambda_{t+1}<\\lambda_{t}$ for any ${\\lambda}_{t}>{\\lambda}^{*}$ , which implies that $\\lambda_{t}$ converges to $\\lambda^{*}$ from any initial value $\\lambda_{\\tau}>0$ 口  \n\n### Proof of Proposition 2:  \n\nIt remains to prove existence and uniqueness. From Proposition 1 follows that the entrant's valuefunction $J^{x}(0,0)$ is decreasing and continuous in $\\rho$ . Hence the expected profit prior to entry,  \n\n$$\n\\Pi^{*}(\\rho)\\equiv\\sum_{x\\in X}\\pi(x)J^{x}(0,0)\n$$  \n\nis a decreasing and continuous function of $\\rho$ . Moreover, the function is strictly decreasing in $\\rho$ whenever it is positive. This also follows from the proof of Proposition 1 which shows that $G(0,x;\\rho)$ is strictly decreasing in $\\rho$ when the new firm $x$ recruits workers $(V^{x}(0,\\lambda)>0$ ). If no new firm recruits workers, expected profit of an entrant cannot be positive. Hence, equation (8) can have at most one solution for any $K>0$ . This implies uniqueness, with entry of firms if (8) can be fulfilled or without entry of firms otherwise. A solution to (8) exists provided that $K$ is sufficiently small and $F^{\\prime}(0)$ is sufficiently large. To see this, if $F^{\\prime}(0)$ is sufficiently large, $\\Pi^{*}(0)$ is strictly positive: some entrants will recruit workers since the marginal product $G_{1}(m(\\lambda)V,x;\\rho)$ is sufficiently large relative to the cost of recruitment and relative to the wage cost which are, for $\\rho=0$ , equal to $m(\\lambda)V b$ (see equation (34). But when $\\Pi^{*}(0)>0$ , a sufficiently small value of $K$ guarantees that (8) has a solution since $\\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\rho\\to\\infty}\\Pi^{*}(\\rho)=0}\\end{array}$ 口  \n\n### Proof of Proposition 3:  \n\nWe will show that the first-order conditions that uniquely characterize the decentralized allocation are also first order conditions to the planner's problem. The same auxiliary problem that we employ in the proof of Proposition 4 part (b) then establishes that the planner cannot improve upon this allocation. We denote by $S_{N,a}$ the derivative of $S$ with respect to $N_{a}$ and by $S_{L,a,x}$ the derivative of $S$ with respect to $L_{a}^{x}$ . The multiplier on the resource constraint is $\\mu\\geq0$ First-order conditions with respect to $N_{0}$ ， $V_{a}^{x}$ , and $\\lambda_{a}^{x}$ ， $a\\geq0$ , are  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}&{}&{\\displaystyle\\sum_{x\\in X}\\pi(x)\\Big[x F(0)-C(V_{0}^{x},0,x)\\Big]-K+\\beta(1-\\delta)S_{N,1}-\\mu\\displaystyle\\sum_{x\\in X}\\pi(x)\\lambda_{0}^{x}V_{0}^{x}=0~,}\\ &{}&{\\quad\\quad\\quad-N_{a}\\pi(x)\\Big[C_{1}(V_{a}^{x},L_{a}^{x},x)+\\mu\\lambda_{a}^{x}\\Big]+\\beta S_{L,a+1,x}m(\\lambda_{a}^{x})\\leq0~,~V_{a}^{x}\\geq0~,}\\ &{}&{\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\beta S_{L,a+1,x}m^{\\prime}(\\lambda_{a}^{x})-\\mu N_{a}\\pi(x)=0~.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nHere condition (60) holds with complementary slackness. The envelope conditions are, for $a\\geq1$ and $x\\in X$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{{}}&{{=N_{a}\\pi(x)\\Big[x F^{\\prime}(L_{a}^{x})-C_{2}^{\\prime}(V_{a}^{x},L_{a}^{x},x)-b-\\mu\\Big]+\\beta(1-s)S_{L,a+1,x}~,}}\\ {{}}&{{=\\displaystyle\\sum_{x\\in X}\\pi(x)\\Big[x F(L_{a}^{x})-C(V_{a}^{x},L_{a}^{x},x)-b L_{a}^{x}\\Big]-\\mu\\displaystyle\\sum_{x\\in X}\\pi(x)\\Big(L_{a}^{x}+\\lambda_{a}^{x}V_{a}^{x}\\Big)+\\beta(1-s)\\frac{(x-x)L_{a}^{x}}{(2-x)L_{a}^{x}}~.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nUse (61) to substitute $S_{L,a,x}$ into (62) to obtain  \n\n$$\nx F^{\\prime}(L_{a+1}^{x})-C_{2}(V_{a+1}^{x},L_{a+1}^{x},x)-b-\\mu=\\frac{\\mu}{\\beta}\\Big[\\frac{1}{(1-\\delta)m^{\\prime}(\\lambda_{a}^{x})}-\\frac{\\beta(1-s)}{m^{\\prime}(\\lambda_{a+1}^{x})}\\Big].\n$$  \n\nThis equation describes the planner's optimal recruitment policy; it coincides with equation (5) for $\\mu=R-b=\\beta\\rho$ . This is intuitive: when the social value of an unemployed worker $\\mu$ coincides with the surplus value that an unemployed worker obtains in search equilibrium, the firm's recruitment policy is efficient. Next substitute (61) into (60) to obtain the socially optimal vacancy creation, for $a\\geq0$ and $x\\in X$  \n\n$$\nC_{1}(V_{a}^{x},L_{a}^{x},x)\\ge\\mu\\left[{\\frac{m(\\lambda_{a}^{x})}{m^{\\prime}(\\lambda_{a}^{x})}}-\\lambda_{a}^{x}\\right],V_{a}^{x}\\ge0.\n$$  \n\nAgain for $\\mu=\\beta\\rho$ , this condition coincides with the frm's choice of vacancy postings in competitive search equilibrium, equation (4). Lastly, it remains to verify that entry is socially effcient  \n\nwhen the value of a jobless worker is $\\mu=R-b$ . The planner's choice of frm entry, condition (59), together with the recursive equation for the marginal firm surplus $S_{N,a}$ ,equation (63), showsthat  \n\n$$\n\\displaystyle{\\mathrm{\\calK}}=\\sum_{a\\geq0}[\\beta(1-\\delta)]^{a}\\sum_{x\\in X}\\pi(x)\\Big[x F(L_{a}^{x})-b L_{a}^{x}-C(V_{a}^{x},L_{a}^{x},x)-\\mu(L_{a}^{x}+\\lambda_{a}^{x}V_{a}^{x})\\Big]~.\n$$  \n\nOn the other hand, the expected profit value of a new firm is  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{x\\in X}\\pi(x)J^{x}(0,0)=\\sum_{a\\geq0}[\\beta(1-\\delta)]^{a}\\sum_{x\\in X}\\pi(x)\\Big[x F(L_{a}^{x})-W_{a}^{x}-C(V_{a}^{x},L_{a}^{x},x)\\Big].\n$$  \n\nHence, the free entry condition in search equilibrium, equation (8), coincides with condition (65) for $R=b+\\mu$ if, for all $x\\in X$  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{a\\geq0}[\\beta(1-\\delta)]^{a}\\Big[(b+\\mu)L_{a}^{x}+\\mu\\lambda_{a}^{x}V_{a}^{x}-W_{a}^{x}\\Big]=0.\n$$  \n\nNow after substitution of  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{{\\cal L}_{a}^{x}}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\sum_{k=0}^{a-1}(1-s)^{a-1-k}m(\\lambda_{k}^{x})V_{k}^{x}~,~\\mathrm{and}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{W_{a}^{x}}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\sum_{k=0}^{a-1}(1-s)^{a-1-k}V_{k}^{x}\\biggl[\\frac{\\rho\\lambda_{k}^{x}}{(1-\\delta)B}+m(\\lambda_{k}^{x})R\\biggr]}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\ninto (66), it is straightforward to see that the equation is satisfied for $\\mu=R-b=\\beta\\rho$  \n\n### Proof of Proposition 4:  \n\nPart (a): The RHS in the system of equations in (16) defines an operator $T$ which maps a sequence of bounded functions $G~=~(G_{t})_{t\\geq0}$ ，with $G_{t}:[0,\\overline{{{L}}}]\\times X\\times Z^{t}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\|G\\|\\equiv\\operatorname*{sup}_{t}\\|G_{t}\\|<\\infty$ , into another sequence of bounded functions $\\tilde{G}=(\\tilde{G}_{t})_{t\\geq0}$ with $\\|{\\tilde{G}}\\|=$ $\\mathrm{sup}_{t}\\|\\tilde{G}_{t}\\|<\\infty$ . Here $\\overline{{L}}$ is sufficiently large such that the bound $\\hat{L}\\leq\\overline{{L}}$ does not bind for any $L\\in[0,\\overline{{L}}]$ . The existence of $\\overline{{L}}$ follows from the Inada condition for $F$ : the marginal product of an additional worker $x z F^{\\prime}(\\hat{L})-b$ must be negative for any $x\\in X$ ， $z\\in Z$ , for any $\\hat{L}\\ge\\overline{{L}}$ with sufficiently large $\\bar{L}$ ; hence no hiring will occur beyond $\\bar{L}$ . Because the operator satisfies Blackwell's sufficient conditions, it is a contraction in the space of bounded function sequences $G$ . Hence, the operator $T$ has a unique fixed point which is a sequence of bounded functions.  \n\nPart (b): Take first a solution $\\mathbf{X}$ of the planning problem, and write $\\beta^{t}\\psi(z^{t})\\mu(z^{t})\\geq0$ for the multipliers on constraints (15). Then $\\mathbf{X}$ maximizes the Lagrange function  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\beta^{t}\\psi(z^{t})\\Bigg\\{-K N_{0}(z^{t})+\\displaystyle\\sum_{a\\geq0,x^{a}}N(x^{a},z^{t})\\bigg[x_{a}z_{t}F(L(x^{a},z^{t}))-b L(x^{a},z^{t})}\\ &{\\cdot}\\ &{(x^{a},z^{t}),\\overline{{L}}(x^{a},z^{t}),x_{a})-\\mu(z^{t})\\Big[(1-s(x^{a},z^{t}))L(x^{a-1},z^{t-1})+\\lambda(x^{a},z^{t})V(x^{a},z^{t})\\Big]\\Bigg\\}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFor each individual frm, this problem is the sequential formulation of the recursive problem (16) with multipliers $\\mu(z^{t})$ . Hence, firm policies also solve the recursive problem; furthermore, the maximum of the Lagrange function is the same as the sum of the social values of entrant firms plus the social values of firms which already exist at $t=0$ ,namely,  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{\\mathcal{L}}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{max}_{N_{0}(\\cdot)}\\sum_{t,z^{t}}\\beta^{t}\\psi(z^{t})N_{0}(z^{t})\\Big[-K+\\sum_{x}\\pi_{0}(x)G_{t}(0,x,z^{t})\\Big]}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{\\displaystyle+\\sum_{z\\in Z}\\psi(z^{0})\\sum_{a\\geq1,x^{a-1},x_{a}}\\pi(x_{a}|x_{a-1})N(x^{a-1},.)G_{0}(L(x^{a-1},.),x_{a},z^{0}).}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThis also proves that the complementary-slackness condition (17) describes optimal entry.  \n\nTo prove the converse, suppose that $\\mathbf{X}$ solves for every firm the recursive problem (16) with multipliers $\\mu(z^{t})$ , and that (17) and the resource constraints (15) are satisfied. Define an auxiliary problem (AP) as an extension of the original planning problem (14) which allows the planner to rent additional workers (or to rent out existing workers) at rental rate $\\mu(z^{t})$ in period $t$ . Formally, the (AP) differs from the original problem in that the resource constraint (15) is replaced by  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{a\\geq0,x^{a}}N(x^{a},z^{t})\\Big[\\overline{{{L}}}(x^{a},z^{t})+\\lambda(x^{a},z^{t})V(x^{a},z^{t})\\Big]\\leq M(z^{t})~,\n$$  \n\nwith $M(z^{t})-1>0$ workers hired or $M(z^{t})-1<0$ workers hired out. Further, the rental cost (rental income) term $-\\mu(z^{t})[M(z^{t})-1]$ is added into the braces in the objective function (14). Then it follows immediately that the multiplier on constraint (67) is equal to $\\mu(z^{t})$ .We further claim that allocation $\\mathbf{X}$ solves problem (AP), and hence also solves the original planning problem. To see this, suppose that there is an allocation $(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime},\\mathbf{M})$ which is feasible for problem (AP) and which strictly dominates $\\mathbf{X}$ .Write  \n\n$$\nO(x^{a},z^{t})\\equiv x_{a}z_{t}F(L(x^{a},z^{t}))-b L(x^{a},z^{t})-f-C(V(x^{a},z^{t}),\\overline{{L}}(x^{a},z^{t}),x_{a})\n$$  \n\nfor the net output created by firm $(x^{a},z^{t})$ in allocation $\\mathbf{X}$ and write $O^{\\prime}(x^{a},z^{t})$ for the same object in allocation $\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}$ .Further, write $S$ for the total surplus value in allocation $(\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{1})$ and write $S^{\\prime}>S$ for the surplus value in allocation $(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime},\\mathbf{M})$ . Then  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{'}&{=}&{\\displaystyle\\sum_{t\\geq0,z^{t}}\\beta^{t}\\psi(z^{t})\\Bigg\\{-K N_{0}^{\\prime}(z^{t})+\\sum_{a\\geq0,x^{a}}N^{\\prime}(x^{a},z^{t})O^{\\prime}(x^{a},z^{t})-\\mu(z^{t})[M(z^{t})-1]}\\ &{\\leq}&{\\displaystyle\\sum_{t\\geq0,z^{t}}\\beta^{t}\\psi(z^{t})\\Bigg\\{-K N_{0}^{\\prime}(z^{t})+\\mu(z^{t})}\\ &&{+\\displaystyle\\sum_{a>0,x^{a}}N^{\\prime}(x^{a},z^{t})\\Big[O^{\\prime}(x^{a},z^{t})-\\mu(z^{t})\\Big(\\overline{{L}}^{\\prime}(x^{a},z^{t})+\\lambda^{\\prime}(x^{a},z^{t})V^{\\prime}(x^{a},z^{t})\\Big)\\Big]\\Bigg\\}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{\\le}&{\\displaystyle\\sum_{t\\ge0,z^{t}}\\beta^{t}\\psi(z^{t})N_{0}^{\\prime}(z^{t})\\Big[-K+\\sum_{x}\\pi_{0}(x)G_{t}(0,x,z^{t})\\Big]}\\ &{+\\displaystyle\\sum_{z\\in Z}\\psi(z^{0})\\displaystyle\\sum_{a\\ge1,x^{a-1},x_{a}}\\pi(x_{a}|x_{a-1})N(x^{a-1},.)G_{0}(L(x^{a-1},.),x_{a},z^{0})+\\displaystyle\\sum_{t,z^{t}}\\beta^{t}\\psi(z^{t}}\\ {\\le}&{\\displaystyle\\sum_{t\\ge0,z^{t}}\\beta^{t}\\psi(z^{t})N_{0}(z^{t})\\Big[-K+\\sum_{x}\\pi_{0}(x)G_{t}(0,x,z^{t})\\Big]}\\ &{+\\displaystyle\\sum_{z\\in Z}\\psi(z^{0})\\displaystyle\\sum_{a\\ge1,x^{a-1},x_{a}}\\pi(x_{a}|x_{a-1})N(x^{a-1},.)G_{0}(L(x^{a-1},.),x_{a},z^{0})+\\displaystyle\\sum_{t,z^{t}}\\beta^{t}\\psi(z^{t}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nHere the first inequality follows from resource constraint (67). The second inequality follows since the discounted sum of surplus values for an individual new firm, namely  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{\\tau\\geq t}\\beta^{\\tau-t}E_{t}\\Big[O^{\\prime}(x^{\\tau-t},z^{\\tau})-\\mu(z^{\\tau})[\\overline{{L}}^{\\prime}(x^{\\tau-t},z^{\\tau})+\\lambda^{\\prime}(x^{\\tau-t},z^{\\tau})V^{\\prime}(x^{\\tau-t},z^{\\tau})]\\Big]~,\n$$  \n\nis bounded above $G_{t}(0,x_{0},z_{t})$ (for new firms） or by $G_{0}(L(x^{a-1},.),x_{a},z^{0})$ (for firms existing at $t=0$ ）by definition of $G_{t}$ . The third inequality follows from the complementary-slackness condition (17): either the term $\\begin{array}{r}{-K+\\sum_{x}\\pi_{0}(x)G_{t}(0,x,z^{t})}\\end{array}$ is zero in which case the first summand is zero on both sides of the inequality; or it is strictly negative in which case $N_{0}(z^{t})=0$ and $N_{0}^{\\prime}(z^{t})\\geq0$ . The last equality follows from the definition of surplus value $S$ and the assumption that allocation $\\mathbf{X}$ solves problem (16) at the level of each individual firm. This proves $S^{\\prime}\\leq S$ and hence contradicts the hypothesis $S^{\\prime}>S$ 口  \n\n### Proof of Proposition 5:  \n\nPart (a): For the multipliers defined by $\\mu(z^{t})=\\mu_{i}$ for $z_{t}=z_{i}$ , the unique solution of (16) coincides with the one of (18), i.e. $G_{t}(L,x,z^{t})=G^{\\imath}(L,x,\\mu)$ for $z_{t}=z_{i}$ , and also the firm-level policies coincide. If they give rise to an allocation $\\mathbf{X}$ with positive entry in all aggregate states $z^{t}$ , (19) implies that (17) holds for all $z^{t}$ . Hence Proposition 4(b) implies that $\\mathbf{X}$ is a solution of the planning problem.  \n\nPart (b): Solving (18) in the stationary case involves to find a single value function $G(L,x,\\mu)$ Application of the contraction mapping theorem implies that such a solution exits, is unique, and is continuous and non-increasing in $\\mu$ and strictly decreasing in $\\mu$ when $G(.)>0$  \n\nTherefore, the function $\\begin{array}{r}{\\Gamma(\\mu)\\equiv\\sum_{x}\\pi_{0}(x)G(0,x,\\mu)\\geq0}\\end{array}$ is continuous, strictly decreasing when positive, and zero for large enough $\\mu$ . Furthermore, when $f$ and $b$ are sufficiently small, $\\Gamma(0)>0$ ; hence when $K>0$ is sufficiently small, there exists a unique $\\mu\\geq0$ satisfying equation (19).  \n\nFor any given vector $(\\mu_{1},\\ldots,\\mu_{n})\\in R_{+}^{n}$ , the system of recursive equations (18) has a unique solution $G=(G^{\\i})$ . Again this follows from the application of the contraction-mapping theorem.  \n\nFurthermore, $G$ is differentiable in $\\mu$ , and all elements of the Jacobian $(d G^{\\iota}/(d\\mu_{j}))$ are nonpositive. The RHS of (18) defines an operator mapping a function $G^{\\imath}(L,x,\\mu)$ with a strictly diagonally dominant Jacobian matrix $(d G^{\\iota}/(d\\mu_{j}))$ into another function ${\\tilde{G}}_{j}$ whose Jacobian matrix $(d\\Tilde{G}_{i}/(d\\mu_{j}))$ is diagonally dominant. This follows since the transition matrix $\\psi(z_{j}|z_{i})$ is strictly diagonally dominant and since all elements of $(d\\Tilde{G}_{i}/(d\\mu_{j}))$ have the same (non-positive) sign. Therefore, the unique fixed point has a strictly diagonally dominant Jacobian. Now suppose that $\\left(z_{1},\\ldots,z_{n}\\right)$ is close to $\\big(z,\\dots,z\\big)$ and consider the solution $\\mu_{1}=...=\\mu_{n}=\\mu$ from part (a). Since the Jacobian matrix $d G^{\\iota}(0,x,\\mu)/(d\\mu_{j})$ is strictly diagonally dominant, it is invertible. By the implicit function theorem, a unique solution to equation (19) exits. 口  \n\nProof of Proposition 6: The proof proceeds in two steps. First, substitute the participation constraint (30) into the frm's problem and make use of the contracts’ recursive equations (23) to show that the firms’ recursive profit maximization problem is identical to the maximization of the social surplus of a firm. Second, show that the competitive equilibrium is socially optimal.  \n\nFirst, define the social surplus of a frm with history $(x^{a},z^{t})$ and with predetermined contracts and employment levels as follows:  \n\n$$\n'\\gamma_{\\tau=0}^{a-1},(L_{\\tau})_{\\tau=0}^{a-1},x^{a},z^{t}\\Big]\\equiv J_{a}\\Big[(\\mathcal{C}_{\\tau})_{\\tau=0}^{a-1},(L_{\\tau})_{\\tau=0}^{a-1},x^{a},z^{t}\\Big]+\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{a-1}L_{\\tau}\\Big[W(\\mathcal{C}_{\\tau},x^{a},z^{t})-U(z^{t},x^{a},z^{t})\\Big],\n$$  \n\nUsing (23) with $\\varphi_{a}(x^{a},z^{t})=0$ and the participation constraint (30), the wage in the hiring period can be expressed as  \n\n$$\nw_{a}(x^{a},z^{t})=b+\\beta E_{z_{t}}U(z^{t+1})+\\frac{\\lambda\\rho(z^{t})}{m(\\lambda)}-\\beta E_{x_{a},z_{t}}W(\\mathcal{C}_{a},x^{a+1},z^{t+1})~.\n$$  \n\nNow substitute this equation, (23) and (26) into (68), and write  \n\n$$\nS\\equiv\\left[(\\mathcal{C}_{\\tau})_{\\tau=0}^{a-1},(L_{\\tau})_{\\tau=0}^{a-1},x^{a},z^{t}\\right]\\mathrm{~and~}\\hat{S}\\equiv\\left[(\\mathcal{C}_{\\tau})_{\\tau=0}^{a},(\\hat{L}_{\\tau})_{\\tau=0}^{a},x^{a+1},z^{t+1}\\right],\n$$  \n\nwith $\\hat{L}_{\\tau}$ as defined in (27), to obtain  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{\\displaystyle_{x}(S)}&{=}&{\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{max}_{\\delta,\\lambda,V,C_{a}}(1-\\delta)\\Biggl\\{x_{\\alpha}z_{t}F(\\hat{L})-f-C(V,\\overline{{L}},x)}\\ &&{\\displaystyle-\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{a-1}\\frac{1-\\varphi_{\\tau}(x^{a},z^{t})}{1-\\delta}L_{\\tau}w_{\\tau}(x^{a},z^{t})-m(\\lambda)V\\left[b+\\beta E_{z_{t}}U(z^{t+1})+\\frac{\\lambda\\rho(z^{t})}{m(\\lambda)}\\right]}\\ &&{\\displaystyle+\\beta E_{x_{\\alpha,\\tau}}\\left[J_{a+1}(\\hat{S})+m(\\lambda)V W(C_{a},x^{a+1},z^{t+1})\\right]\\Biggr\\}}\\ &&{\\displaystyle+\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{a-1}L_{\\tau}(1-\\varphi_{\\tau}(x^{a},z^{t}))\\Biggl[w_{\\tau}(x^{a},z^{t})-U(z^{t})+\\beta E_{x_{\\alpha,\\tau}}W(C_{\\tau},x^{a+1},z^{t+1},\\cdots)}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{{}}&{{=\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{max}_{\\delta,\\lambda,\\nu,C_{a}}(1-\\delta)\\bigg\\{x_{a}z_{t}F(\\hat{L})-b\\hat{L}-f-\\rho(z^{t})\\lambda V-\\rho(z^{t})\\displaystyle\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{a-1}L_{\\tau}(1-\\varphi_{\\tau}(x^{a},z^{t}))}}\\ {{}}&{{\\quad-C(V,\\overline{{L}},x)+\\beta E_{x_{a},z_{t}}\\Big[J_{a+1}(\\hat{S})+\\displaystyle\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{a}\\hat{L}_{\\tau}\\Big(W(\\mathcal{L}_{\\tau},x^{a+1},z^{t+1})-U(z^{t+1})\\Big)\\Big]\\bigg\\}}}\\ {{}}&{{=\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{max}_{\\delta,\\lambda,\\nu,C_{a}}(1-\\delta)\\bigg\\{x_{a}z_{t}F(\\hat{L})-f-C(V,\\overline{{L}},x)-\\rho(z^{t})\\Big[\\lambda V+\\hat{L}-m(\\lambda)V\\Big]-b\\hat{L}}}\\ {{}}&{{\\quad+\\beta E_{x_{a},z_{t}}G_{a+1}(\\hat{S})\\bigg\\}.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nHere maximization is subject to (27) and (28), and the second equation makes use of (25). This shows that the firm solves a surplus maximization problem which is identical to the one of the planner specified in (16) provided that $\\rho(z^{t})=\\mu(z^{t})$ holds for all $z^{t}$ ，where $\\mu$ is the social value of an unemployed worker as defined in section 4.2. The only difference between the two problems is that the firm commits to cohort-specific separation probabilities, whereas the planner chooses in every period an identical separation probability for all workers (and he clearly has no reason to do otherwise). Nonetheless, both problems have the same solution: they are dynamic optimization problems of a single decision maker in which payoff functions are the same (with $\\rho(z^{t})=\\mu(z^{t}),$ and the decision sets are the same. Further, time inconsistency is not an issue since there is no strategic interaction and since discounting is exponential. Hence solutions to the two problems, with respect to firm exit, layoffs and hiring strategies, are identical. In both problems the decision maker could discriminate between different cohorts in principal. Because such differential treatment does not raise social firm value, there is also no reason for competitive search to produce such an outcome. Nonetheless, there can be equilibria where different cohorts have different separation probabilities, but these equilibria must also be socially optimal because they maximize social frm value.  \n\nIt remains to verify that competitive search gives indeed rise to socially effcient firm entry.When $\\mu(z^{t})=\\rho(z^{t})$ $G_{0}(x,z^{t})$ as defined in (68) coincides with $G_{0}(0,x,z^{t})$ , as defined in (16). Hence, the free-entry condition (31) coincides with the condition for socially optimal firm creation (17). Because of aggregate resource feasibility (32), the planner's resource constraint (15) is also satisfied. Since the allocation of a competitive search equilibrium satisfies all the requirements of Proposition 4(b), it is socially optimal. 口  \n\n# References  \n\nACEMOGLU, D., AND W.

This study explores whether learning is symmetric or asymmetric, i.e., whether potential employers have the same information about worker ability as the incumbent firm. I develop a model of asymmetric learning that nests the symmetric learning case and allows the degree of asymmetry to vary, yielding testable implications for the prevalence of asymmetric learning. I then show how predictions in the model can be tested using compensation data. Using the NLSY, I test the model and find strong support for asymmetric information. I first exploit the fact that groups of workers differ in their variances in ability - based on economic conditions at time of entry into a firm - to show that incumbent wages track differences in ability distributions more closely than do outside firm wages. Second, I show that learning about ability is more symmetric for occupations that require more communication outside the firm. Finally, I show how to uncover the key parameter of interest in my model representing the degree to which information is asymmetric. My estimates imply that in one period, outside firms reduce the average expectation error over worker ability by roughly a third of the reduction made by incumbent firms. Thus outside firms retain sizeable expectation errors due to asymmetric information.  \n\nJEL Classification: D21, D83, J33  \n\nKeywords:   employer learning, asymmetric information, personnel economics  \n\nCorresponding author:  \n\nLisa Kahn   \nYale School of Management   \n135 Prospect St   \nPO B0x 208200   \nNew Haven, CT 06510   \nUSA   \nE-mail: lisa.kahn@yale.edu  \n\n## 1 Introduction  \n\nThe sorting of workers into firms is an important aspect of the labor market. A significant part of this sorting involves both worker and firm learning about the quality of workers over time. For example, many patterns observed in the job mobility literature - that young workers change jobs often (Topel and Ward 1992) yet long-term employment relationships are common and the probability of remaining at a frm rises with tenure (Farber 1999) - are consistent with learning over time about overall or match-specific worker quality. However, the extent to which information about workers spreads across the market is less clear. Asymmetric information exists when incumbent employers have more information about worker quality than potential employers do. Consider a team of research assistants working for a professor. The professor can see exactly which worker performed each task and who contributed important ideas, yet the outside world observes only what appears on the bottom of an academic paper: the professor is grateful for the excellent research assistance Of...  \n\nUnder asymmetric information, inefficiencies can arise in both allocating workers to jobs and investing in worker human capital. First, the asymmetric information model implies that lower-ability workers are more likely to leave the firm (Greenwald 1986 and Gibbons and Katz 1991) since the incumbent employer but not the outside employer has learned that these workers are low ability. Higher quality workers might leave firms at inefficiently low rates. Second, Waldman's 1984 model assumes that outside firms can observe promotions but not wages and implies that a worker's outside option changes sharply upon promotion.1 The incumbent firm must offer a large wage increase to keep a promoted worker so there are fewer promotions than would be optimal.2 Third, several theoretical papers point out that under asymmetric information, workers could underinvest in general skills.3 When outside firms cannot observe workers’ investments, the incumbent firm need not fully compensate the worker.4 It is necessary to understand the importance of asymmetric information to know whether these inefficiencies should be of concern.  \n\nThis paper seeks to identify whether asymmetric information is prevalent in the labor market. That an employer learns more quickly than the outside market about its own workers’ abilities is intuitive, yet little empirical evidence exists. A small number of papers provide empirical support for asymmetric learning but usually require strong assumptions or look in specialized settings.5 Several papers use AFQT score to provide evidence that employer learning is indeed prevalent, but they assume that learning is symmetric across employers.6 A few papers extend this methodology to the asymmetric learning case. For example, Schonberg (2007), the closest to the current paper, looks at whether the relationship between AFQT and earnings increases with firm tenure, controlling for the increased effect of AFQT across levels of experience. This would imply that incumbent employers learn more about worker productivity than does the rest of the market; however, with noisy estimates, she does underpromote minority workers to retain their informational advantage.  \n\n3See, for example, Chang and Wang (1996), Katz and Ziderman (1990) and Waldman (1990).  \n\n4 Alternatively, Acemoglu and Pischke (1998) show that providing general training might be optimal under asymmetric information because it allows high-quality workers to signal their type by selecting into a firm that provides such training.  \n\n5 Gibons and Katz (1991) show that laid off workers experience larger earnings losses, relative to workers who lost their jobs due to plant closings, consistent with the presence of asymmetric information and a layoff being a negative signal of ability. DeVaro and Waldman (2012) test an extended version of the Waldman (1984) model, using proprietary data from a single firm, and find support for asymmetric information. Using data on apprentices in Germany, Acemoglu and Pischke (1998) link employer-provided training to asymmetric information and von Wachter and Bender (2006) show that workers released by firms are negatively selected.  \n\n6In their canonical paper, Farber and Gibbons (1996) argue that the Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT), administered to respondents in the NLSY in 1980, is unobservable to employers yet highly correlated with ability. They show that the effect of AFQT on wages becomes stronger over time and that of education becomes weaker, providing evidence that employers learn about worker ability. Altonji and Pierret (2001) expand this methodology to study statistical discrimination and Lange (2007) provides an estimate for the speed of employer learning.  \n\nnot find a significant AFQT-tenure-earnings profile and therefore fails to reject the symmetric learning model, except possibly among college graduates.7 Though the AFQT approach presents an obvious advancement in the study of employer learning, it also brings with it an undesirable set of assumptions: first that the econometrician has information the firm does not but would have been valuable to collect; second, since AFQT was measured prior to labor market entry, this approach cannot distinguish between employer learning and models of idiosyncratic human capital accumulation.8 Furthermore, the papers using AFQT to test for asymmetric learning identify off of the interaction of AFQT score and tenure, thus additionally requiring strong assumptions about worker mobility.  \n\nIn this paper, I contribute a new methodology for identifying employer learning, using compensation. My approach arguably lays fewer demands on a dataset and does not rely on the assumptions required by the AFQT approach. I derive a learning model with endogenous mobility and asymmetric information that nests symmetric learning as a special case. I then test the model using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY) and find strong support, both economically and statistically, in favor of asymmetric learning. Finally, I uncover the key parameter of interest in my model, the degree to which employer learning is asymmetric, using a linear regression framework. This is the frst such estimate, to my knowledge. I conclude that asymmetric information between employers is prevalent in the labor market and that the effects are large in magnitude.  \n\nSpecifically, I consider a two-period model in which workers have stochastic ability that is initially unobservable to all parties. Workers randomly match to firms at the beginning of period 1 and information about their ability is revealed. This model nests both the symmetric and asymmetric learning cases by allowing for outside employers to receive a noisier signal of worker ability than that of the incumbent employer. Based on new information, profit maximizing firms make wage offers. Workers then choose whether to stay at the incumbent firm or take an outside wage offer, based on the size of the offers and the realization of a random preference shock specific to the incumbent firm (a la Acemoglu and Pischke 1998). In the second period workers earn either the incumbent firm's wage offer or the outside offer and then retire.9  \n\nThis model yields two important implications about the pay change distributions of movers and stayers. These are of interest since wage changes reflect how much an employer has learned between periods and a pay change distribution refects learning about a group of workers. First, the variance of wage changes is increasing in the variance in ability, but under asymmetric information this relationship is stronger for wage changes of stayers than for movers - this reflects the fact that incumbents have learned more about differences in worker ability between periods than have outside employers. Second, the variance of wage changes is declining in the degree of asymmetry in the market, but this relationship is stronger for wage changes of movers than for stayers - the greater the degree of asymmetry, the less outside firms have learned about worker ability relative to the incumbent, and therefore the more compressed their wage offers will be.  \n\nI test the model using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979. These tests require variation in the dispersion of worker ability and the degree of asymmetry. For cross-group differences in the variance in worker ability I use labor market conditions at time of entry into a firm. I provide evidence that workers who enter firms in recessions have a lower variance in ability than workers who enter firms in booms. During a recession, voluntary quits fall substantially;10 hence, the share of job-seekers who are unemployed or leaving bad jobs increases relative to boom-times. In consequence, the variance of worker ability will be lower for workers who enter firms in recessions - these workers are more likely to be of lower quality. Consistent with their lower variance in ability, workers who enter firms in recessions do indeed have a lower variance in wage changes within the firm but less so when they subsequently switch firms. This finding supports the asymmetric learning model because it indicates that outside wage offers are less linked to worker ability.  \n\nAs a source of variation in the degree of asymmetry, I compare workers across job types that vary in the importance of communicating to people outside the firm, a classification created using O $^*$ NET task measures. I hypothesize that information will spread more symmetrically across employers when jobs involve more external interaction. I find that, consistent with my asymmetric information model, the variance in wage changes is smaller in the more asymmetric markets (with less outside communication) and this relationship is smaller in magnitude for stayers.  \n\nFinally, I use my estimates and some plausible calibration assumptions to quantify how relevant asymmetric information is in the economy as a whole. I find signals of worker quality received by outside firms are substantially noisier than what incumbents observe. I use this to calculate the differential speed of employer learning (as in Lange 2007) by outside firms, relative to the incumbent. I find that in one period, outside firms can reduce their initial expectation errors over worker quality by roughly a third of what the incumbent firm can reduce theirs by. Thus, asymmetric information, has a sizeable impact on expectation errors of firms.  \n\nThe remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents a theoretical model and derives the predictions to be tested in the paper. Section 3 shows how to empirically implement these predictions. Section 4 describes the data and the empirical methodology. Section 5 presents the results and shows that the predictions of the asymmetric information model are supported in the data. Section 6 concludes.  \n\n![](images/8c052246c4d03ccddcc60852bb50a46ad6866c5d10de916f7fe41abb53924d7a.jpg)  \nFigure 1: Timeline  \n\n# 2 Theory  \n\nThe purpose of this section is to motivate the two comparative statics tested in the paper. In order to keep the model tractable, I make several simplifying assumptions. In particular, there is no match quality or human capital accumulation and the worker's turnover decision is reduced to a function of just a few variables, described below. In the next section, I discuss how I can empirically estimate the parameters of interest, despite these simplifying assumptions.  \n\n## 2.1 Basic Setup and Timing  \n\nIn this two-period model, I assume a competitive labor market where firms are profit maximizing and both workers and frms are risk neutral with no discounting. The timing of events is summarized in figure 1. At time 0, worker $i$ draws ability $\\mu_{i}$ from a distribution with cumulative distribution and probability density functions $\\Phi$ and $\\phi$ . To simplify the analysis, I assume that ability is normally distributed, i.e., $\\phi(\\cdot)\\sim N(m,\\sigma^{2})$ 11 I also assume that output equals ability in all firms in all periods. Thus there is no match quality or human capital accumulation after labor market entry.  \n\nAlso at time O, workers are randomly matched to firms. Call the hiring firm the incumbent. At that point ability is unobservable to all parties, both workers and firms. Thus all workers earn the same first period wage, $w_{0}$  \n\nDuring period 1, information is revealed. I assume the incumbent firm learns $\\mu_{i}$ perfectly, while outside employers do not. Instead, they observe a public, noisy signal of ability for each worker, $s_{i}$ .12 Let $s_{i}=\\mu_{i}+\\epsilon_{i}$ where $\\epsilon$ $\\sim N(0,r\\sigma^{2})$ ， $r\\geq0$ and $\\epsilon\\perp\\mu$ . If $r=0$ then $s=\\mu$ with certainty and we are in the perfectly symmetric learning case. As $r$ approaches $\\infty$ , the signal becomes meaningless and we approach the perfectly asymmetric learning case. From Baye's Rule, the posterior on ability, $\\mu$ , conditional on the realized signal, $s$ ， $\\begin{array}{r}{\\sim N(\\frac{m r+s}{1+r},\\frac{r\\sigma^{2}}{1+r})}\\end{array}$ (DeGroot 2004).  \n\nThroughout the paper, I will be primarily interested in $\\begin{array}{r}{X=\\frac{r}{1+r}}\\end{array}$ , which is strictly increasing in $r$ and ranges between O and $^{1}$ $X$ has a natural interpretation as the weight outside firms place on their prior when updating beliefs about worker ability after receiving a new signal, or 1 minus the speed of employer learning defined in Lange (2007). I call $X$ the degree of asymmetry because it represents the relative noisiness of the signal outside firms receive.  \n\nBased on this information, firms make wage offers. The incumbent firm's strategy is a mapping $w(\\mu,s):\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\longrightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ while an outside firm's strategy is a mapping $v(s):\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\longrightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ , both yielding period 2 wage offers. I further assume that outside firms cannot observe incumbent wage offers, otherwise ability, $\\mu$ could be perfectly inferred.  \n\nMobility is driven by wage offers and a random disutility shock, $\\theta_{i}$ , which workers receive during period 1 (following Acemoglu and Pischke 1998). I assume $\\theta$ is uniformly distributed over the interval $[-{\\bar{\\theta}},{\\bar{\\theta}}]$ and is independent of $\\mu$ and $s$ . It is the worker's ex-post evaluation of the workplace (e.g., dislike of coworkers) and workers must bear this cost if they stay with the incumbent, or get a new draw (with mean O) if they move firms. Workers maximize income minus the disutility shock in making quit decisions. $\\theta$ is meant to represent the level of random turnover in the economy, otherwise moving would be perfectly revelatory of the incumbent's wage offer so no one would find it worthwhile to move. I assume that $\\theta$ cannot be credibly revealed to employers and therefore cannot be incorporated into wage offers.  \n\n## 2.2 Calculating the Equilibrium  \n\nThe perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) consists of an incumbent firm wage schedule, $w^{*}(\\mu,s)$ , an outside firm wage schedule, $v^{*}(s)$ , and the worker's quit decision, such that: (1) the incumbent frm maximizes profits conditional on outside firm behavior, (2) outside frms maximize profits subject to beliefs about worker turnover behavior, (3) workers maximize income minus $\\theta$ in making their quit decision and (4) all beliefs are consistent with these strategies.  \n\nIn the PBE, incumbent firms take the outside wage offers as given and maximize expected profits for each $(\\mu,s)$ pair, calculating the expectation over all realizations of $\\theta$ . Competition dictates that outside firms set a wage schedule, $v(s)$ , equal to a worker's expected productivity conditional on leaving the firm and on $s$ 13  Thus the solution for $v^{*}(s)$ falls straightforwardly from Baye's Rule. Both wage offers are represented below and derived in Appendix A.1.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{v^{\\ast}(s)}}&{{=}}&{{m X+s(1-X)-c}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{w^{\\ast}(\\mu,s)}}&{{=}}&{{{\\frac{1}{2}}(\\mu+v^{\\ast}(s)-\\bar{\\theta})}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nEquation 1 shows that $v^{*}(s)$ equals the posterior expectation of $\\mu$ conditional on $s$ (DeGroot 2004) - simply a weighted average of the prior and the new signal - minus a constant. The constant reflects that outside firms also update on the information revealed by a worker's willingness to accept the outside wage offer. The value of the constant is unimportant here since we are concerned with variances in pay. However, it is worth noting that $c>0$ (see appendix A.1). Outside wage offers, equaling expected productivity conditional on $s$ and moving, are thus lower than the expectation of $\\mu$ given $s$ unconditional on moving $(m X+s(1-X))$ . Therefore movers are on average negatively selected, a point made clearer in the discussion of the incumbent firm's wage offer, next.  \n\nIn equation 2 the incumbent frm's wage schedule is the average of true productivity and outside firm expectations (plus a constant related to the distribution dictating random turnover). This formulation of the incumbent wage offer is quite intuitive. Having learned $\\mu$ , the incumbent holds an information rent over the worker, the value of which is $\\mu-w^{*}(\\mu,s)$ . The firm could set the wage equal to the worker's outside option, $v^{*}(s)$ , and capture the entire information rent. However it then risks losing workers who have a high realization of $\\theta$ , the disutility shock. Instead the firm could set the wage equal to $\\mu$ and have a higher chance of outweighing $\\theta$ for high quality workers. The firm would thus be more likely to keep high quality workers, but would lose the entire information rent. Facing these trade-offs (wanting to keep high quality workers while still capturing some of the value of the information rent), the firm chooses to set pay equal to the average of the two.14  \n\nTherefore incumbent wage offers are linked to true ability, $\\mu$ ,eventhough outside firms cannot observe it. Furthermore, wage offers are increasing in $\\mu$ , implying the worker's probability of staying is also increasing in $\\mu$ .Thus this model yields that classic lemons effect (a la Greenwald 1986) that worse workers are more likely to leave.  \n\nFinally, the period 1 wage can be calculated by adding a zero ex-ante profit condition (see appendix A.2). Since at the beginning of period 1 ability is unknown, $w_{0}$ is simply a constant.  \n\n## 2.3 Comparative Statics  \n\nIn this section, I derive comparative statics relating to the variance of wage changes. This is of interest because the wage change incorporates new information firms have learned about worker ability. The degree to which this distribution is correlated with the true underlying ability distribution reflects how well firms have learned. Note equations 1 and 2 take as arguments $\\mu$ and $s$ . However, when calculating their variances, I integrate over the actual probabilities that a given $(\\mu,s)$ pair accepts that offer. Therefore, the propositions derived below hold for the accepted wage distribution, not the distribution of wage offers.  \n\nThe change in wages between periods 1 and 2 for workers who stay with the incumbent frm, $\\Delta w^{s t a y}$ , is by definition, $w^{\\ast}(\\mu,s)-w_{0}$ , while the wage change for movers, $\\Delta w^{m o v e}$ , is $v^{\\ast}(s)-w_{0}$ . In appendix A.3, I calculate the variance of $\\Delta w^{s t a y}$ among those who accept $w^{*}(\\mu,s)$ and the variance of $\\Delta w^{m o v e}$ among those who accept $v^{*}(s)$  \n\nFor ease of notation, I will express the variance of wage changes for stayers (equation 8 in the appendix) as $V^{s t a y}$ and the variance of wage changes of movers as $V^{m o v e}$ (equation 9 in the appendix). A closed form solution to $V^{s t a y}-$ $V^{m o v e}$ is expressed in appendix A.3 (equation 10), though here I simply note that it is a function of $\\sigma^{2}$ ， $X$ , and $\\theta$ (respectively, the variance in ability, the degree of asymmetry, and the distribution parameter for the random disutility shock). To see how the variance in wage changes is affected by the underlying variance in ability across movers and stayers, I need to sign expression 3.  \n\n$$\n\\partial_{\\sigma}={\\frac{\\partial(V^{s t a y}-V^{m o v e})}{\\partial\\sigma^{2}}}\n$$  \n\nIn appendix A.3, I show that $\\partial_{\\sigma}$ is always positive, i.e., the derivative is larger for the variance in wage changes of stayers than for movers. Under asymmetric information, the incumbent firm has learned more about worker ability so the distribution of wage changes can more closely track the distribution of ability. Intuition for this result can be gleaned from considering equations 1 and 2, respectively $v^{*}(s)$ and $w^{*}(\\mu,s)$ . Variation in the incumbent wage offer comes from $\\mu$ and $s$ , while variation in the outside wage offer comes only from $s$ . Recall $s$ is noisily related to $\\mu$ , with the amount of noise being dictated by $X$ , the degree of asymmetry. Therefore the variation in these wage offers will be positively related to variation in $\\mu$ (i.e., $\\sigma^{2}$ ). However, since the outside wage offer is only noisily related to $\\mu$ , its variance will be less related to $\\sigma^{2}$ Indeed, as $X$ approaches 1 and we approach the pure asymmetric case, outside firms place no weight on the new signal, so the wage change for movers has no variance. At the same time, it is easy to show that when $X=0$ , all firms have the same information set, and outside firms place full weight on the new signal. Since, in this case, the new signal equals true ability, $\\mu$ , perfectly, wage distributions of both incumbents and outside firms will be equally related to $\\sigma^{2}$ . Proposition 1 summarizes this finding.  \n\nProposition 1 Under asymmetric information, the variance in wage changes responds more to differences in the variance of ability for stayers than for movers $\\partial_{\\sigma}\\mathrm{~>~0~}$ ). Under symmetric information, the response is the same across movers and stayers ( $\\partial_{\\sigma}=0$ 一  \n\nTo see how the variance in wage changes is affected by changes in $X$ ,the degree of asymmetry in the market, across movers and stayers, we need to sign expression 4.  \n\n$$\n\\partial_{X}={\\frac{\\partial(V^{s t a y}-V^{m o v e})}{\\partial X}}\n$$  \n\nIn appendix A.3, I show that $\\partial_{X}$ is always positive. A higher degree of asymmetry, $X$ , compresses the distributions of wage changes for both movers and stayers, but more so for movers. The intuition is that the outside wage offer, $v^{*}(s)$ , is less related to true ability when information is more asymmetric, that is when $s$ is more noisily related to $\\mu$ . Since $v^{*}(s)$ is a component of period 2 wages for both movers and stayers, period 2 wages will be less linked to true ability, implying wage changes will be less dispersed. However, this compression will have a larger impact on the variance for movers. This is because variation in wages of movers is entirely driven by variation in $v^{*}(s)$ which is only one component of the variance for stayers (recall from equation 2 that the period 2 wage for stayers is the average of $\\mu$ and $v^{*}(s)$ ). This result is summarized in proposition 2.  \n\nProposition 2 The variance in wage changes for movers responds more negatively to the degree of asymmetry than does the variance for stayers ( $\\partial_{X}>0$ 一  \n\n# 3 Implementation  \n\nThe goal in this section is to show how I can empirically identify expressions 3 and 4. This requires credible variation in both $\\sigma^{2}$ and $X$ ,two variables not readily observable in most datasets. In addition, I need to discuss factors outside the scope of the model that could influence these expressions empirically.  \n\nSuppose we have two groups of workers, one with a higher variance ability distribution than the other. Let $\\sigma_{H}^{2}$ and $\\sigma_{L}^{2}$ express the variances in ability for each group, where $\\sigma_{H}^{2}>\\sigma_{L}^{2}$ .Similarly, suppose there are two types of jobs that vary in the degree to which outside firms can observe worker quality. Let $X^{A}$ and $X^{S}$ represent the degree of asymmetry for the two groups, where $X^{A}>X^{S}$ , i.e., the noise term on the signal of worker quality that outside firms observe is higher variance for the former, relative to the latter. Finally, suppose each type of worker can be in either type of job.  \n\nEquation 5 expresses the variance in wage changes for both worker types $(i\\in H,L)$ and both job types $(j\\in A,S)$ . It uses the indicator variable, $I^{s t a y}$ (equaling one if the worker stayed at the firm between periods) to combine the expressions for the variances in pay changes for movers and stayers. Equation 5 further contains three additional terms: $\\gamma^{s t a y},\\gamma^{\\sigma_{i}}$ , and $\\gamma^{r^{j}}$ . I explain these terms next.  \n\n$$\nV a r(\\Delta w)=I^{s t a y}*V^{s t a y}+(1-I^{s t a y})*V^{m o v e}+\\gamma^{s t a y}+\\gamma^{\\sigma_{i}}+\\gamma^{X^{j}}\n$$  \n\nFirst, $\\gamma^{s t a y}$ allows the variance in pay changes to be different for stayers than for movers for reasons beyond the scope of the model. For example, changing firms also involves a new mix of amenities, a new realization of match quality and changing compensating differentials, all of which will impact pay and will likely cause the variance in pay changes to be larger for movers than for stayers. Also, search theory motivates an additional friction resulting in inefficient worker mobility that would have an impact on pay. Finally, the asymmetric information model predicts that movers will be negatively selected. However, evidence suggests that workers often move to better opportunities and experience wage growth upon doing so (Topel and Ward 1992), or learn about their own abilities and sort into better matches over time (Gibbons, Katz, Lemieux and Parent 2005). All of these factors and more are incorporated into $\\gamma^{s t a y}$ . This is a sizeable advancement over the previous literature since, to the best of my knowledge, none of the previous papers relying on the interaction of AFQT and tenure to test asymmetric information account for these factors. My key assumption is the weaker one that these turnover factors do not interact with worker or job type.  \n\nIn addition, $\\gamma^{o_{i}}$ and $\\gamma^{X^{j}}$ allow the variances in pay changes to be different for workers with different variances in ability and jobs that differ in the degree to which information is asymmetric. One motivation for these fixed effects is that groups may accumulate human capital at differing rates, which would result in differing degrees of pay dispersion.15 Their importance will become clear below, when I discuss the empirical analogues for groups that differ in variance in ability and jobs that differ in the degree of asymmetry.  \n\nTo test propositions 1 and 2 above, we need to empirically estimate expressions 3 and 4, which represent the differences in the derivatives of pay changes between movers and stayers with respect to $\\sigma^{2}$ and $X$ , respectively. Let us begin with the identification of $\\partial_{\\sigma}$ (equation 3, above).  \n\nEquations 6-9 show the formulas for the variances in pay changes for four groups: those in the high variance ability distribution who stay, those in the high variance ability distribution who move, those in the low variance ability distribution who stay and those in the low variance ability distribution who move, respectively. These come directly from equation 5. Importantly, as indicated, I assume $X$ and $\\theta$ are held constant and $\\gamma^{s t a y}$ does not vary across high- and low-variance ability groups.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{V a r(\\Delta w)_{s t a y}^{H}}}&{{=}}&{{V^{s t a y}(\\sigma_{H}^{2},X,\\bar{\\theta})+\\gamma^{s t a y}+\\gamma^{\\sigma_{H}}+\\gamma^{X}}}\\ {{V a r(\\Delta w)_{m o v e}^{H}}}&{{=}}&{{V^{m o v e}(\\sigma_{H}^{2},X,\\bar{\\theta})+\\gamma^{\\sigma_{H}}+\\gamma^{X}}}\\ {{V a r(\\Delta w)_{s t a y}^{L}}}&{{=}}&{{V^{s t a y}(\\sigma_{L}^{2},X,\\bar{\\theta})+\\gamma^{s t a y}+\\gamma^{\\sigma_{L}}+\\gamma^{X}}}\\ {{V a r(\\Delta w)_{m o v e}^{L}}}&{{=}}&{{V^{m o v e}(\\sigma_{L}^{2},X,\\bar{\\theta})+\\gamma^{\\sigma_{L}}+\\gamma^{X}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIt should already be clear that we will be able to difference out most of these terms. The difference-in-differences expression is shown below. To get to equation 10, I approximate the change in $V^{s t a y}-V^{m o v e}$ associated with an increase in $\\sigma^{2}$ by the derivative of $V^{s t a y}-V^{m o v e}$ with respect to $\\sigma^{2}$ times the size of the increase, where here $\\triangle\\sigma^{2}=(\\sigma_{L}^{2}-\\sigma_{H}^{2})$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}{d d_{\\sigma}}&{=}&{(V a r(\\Delta w)_{s t a y}^{L}-V a r(\\Delta w)_{m o v e}^{L})-(V a r(\\Delta w)_{s t a y}^{H}-V a r(\\Delta w)_{m o v e}^{H})}\\ {d d_{\\sigma}}&{\\approx}&{\\partial_{\\sigma}*\\triangle\\sigma^{2}(10)}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nSince $\\triangle\\sigma^{2}<0$ and proposition 1 tells us $\\partial_{\\sigma}>0$ under the asymmetric learning model, we should expect an empirical estimate of $d d_{\\sigma}<0$ . That is, the decrease in the variance in wage changes seen in the low variance group compared to the high variance group is larger in magnitude for stayers than for movers. In contrast, under symmetric information, period 2 wage offers are equally linked to ability for both movers and stayers, hence so are the variances and $d d_{\\sigma}=0$  \n\nNow let's turn to identifying $\\partial_{X}$ (expression 4, above). We can write a set of equations, analogous to 6-9, where we vary $X$ (between $X^{A}$ and $X^{S}$ ) and hold constant $\\sigma^{2}$ . I can then derive the difference-in-differences estimate in a similar manner. This is shown below, where equation 11 approximates the change in $V^{s t a y}-V^{m o v e}$ associated with an increase in $X$ by the derivative with respect to $X$ times the size of the increase, where $\\triangle X=(X^{S}-X^{A})$ . Since $\\triangle X<0$ and proposition 2 tells us $\\partial_{X}\\mathbf{\\Omega}>0$ under the asymmetric learning model, we should expect an empirical estimate of $d d_{X}<0$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l l l}{{d d_{X}}}&{{=}}&{{(V a r(\\Delta w)_{s t a y}^{S}-V a r(\\Delta w)_{m o v e}^{S})-(V a r(\\Delta w)_{s t a y}^{A}-V a r(\\Delta w)_{m o v e}^{A})}}\\ {{d d_{X}}}&{{\\approx}}&{{\\partial_{X}*\\triangle X~(11)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nHaving shown how to identify the expressions of interest using a differencein-differences strategy, I now describe the data and show how to empirically estimate $d d_{\\sigma}$ $d d_{X}$ , and how I use these estimates to quantify $X$  \n\n## ? Data and Methodology  \n\nThe primary dataset used in this paper is the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) from 1979-2000.16 These data allow me to follow a nationally representative sample of workers over a long period of time. The sample is restricted to the male cross-section sample (3,003 respondents), omitting women and the oversamples.17 The NLSY is particularly useful because it allows respondents to list up to five employers in the past year and these employer-employee relationships can be tracked across survey years. In each year, the survey records wage, occupation, industry, tenure for each job, and reason for having left the job if the worker is no longer there. For a job spell to be included in the sample, all wage observations at that employer must refect full-time, non-enrolled, non-self-employed work of workers who have completed their transition from school into the labor force.18 I allow workers to hold only one such job at a time, excluding the shorter duration job for those held concurrently. The data also include the Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT) score, an aptitude test administered to all NLSY respondents in 1981.19 This test has been shown to correlate with earnings, but is likely unobservable to employers, making it a useful variable in past studies of employer learning.2o Though I use the AFQT as supporting evidence, my paper provides a new methodology that does not rely on the AFQT and the several assumptions required of that approach. Appendix table B.1 summarizes the creation of the main variables used in this analysis.  \n\nDifferences in $\\sigma^{2}$ In order to test proposition 1, that the variance in wage changes is more closely linked to the variance in ability for stayers than for movers, it is necessary to identify groups with different variances in ability. For this, I use labor market conditions at time of entry into a firm. Specifically, I use the national unemployment rate in the year the worker entered the firm, divided into quartiles over the sample period.21 I exploit the empirical phenomenon that workers who enter firms during worse economies have a lower variance in observable characteristics (and therefore, plausibly, lower variances in unobserved ability) than workers who enter firms in booms. This is due to the fact that job seekers are negatively selected in recessions relative to boomtimes. This negative selection also implies a lower variance, for most ability distributions.  \n\nTo build intuition, consider the following broad categorization of job seekers: 1. voluntary movers, 2. involuntary movers and the unemployed and 3. new labor market entrants. The first group are positively selected, the second group are negatively selected and the third group is probably close to random.2 During a recession, voluntary quits fall dramatically, while involuntary separations rise. For example, in the Great Recession, the quit rate fell by nearly $50\\%$ , from a peak of 2.3 in December 2006, to a trough of 1.2 in September, 2009, while the layoff and discharge rate rose from 1.2 to 2.0 over a similar period.23 Thus the composition of job seekers is more strongly loaded on the second and third groups. Negative selection in the second group may become less pronounced, since in order to make larger workforce reductions, firms may have to layoff workers who are higher up on the ability ladder. However, empirically, it looks as though the reduction in voluntary quits is the stronger force.  \n\nFigure 2 helps to illustrate this point for the top and bottom national unemployment rate quartiles, which should refect the starkest comparison. Here I show kernel densities of age-adjusted AFQT score for each group, as well as vertical lines at their means. As can be seen the high unemployment rate group (solid red line) has both a lower mean value and a more compressed distribution.  \n\nTable 1 shows that these differences are statistically significant. Here I show means and variances for a range of characteristics across job-entry unemployment rate quartiles. The table includes highest grade completed, age-adjusted AFQT score and a log wage residual from the first wage observation at the employer (though very similar findings are obtained from any number of other variables contained in the NLSY).24 These are useful measures in that education is observable to both the employer and the econometrician, while AFQT score is likely only observable to the econometrician and a first wage residual incorporates information available to the employer but not the econometrician. Patterns found in these measures, which are to varying degrees observable, are suggestive that similar patterns would hold with unobserved ability as well.  \n\nPanel A shows differences in means, while panel B shows differences in variances, where the first row in each panel compares the highest quartile unemployment rate (worst economy) to the lowest, yielding the sharpest contrast.25 As can be seen, workers entering frms in economic slumps have less education, lower test scores and a lower frst wage residual. They also have lower variances along all of these dimensions, and these differences are all statistically significant at the 10% level or better. In the next section, I use these job-entry cohorts as a source of variation in $\\sigma^{2}$ (the variance in ability).  \n\nDifferences in $X$ In order to test proposition 2, that the variance in pay changes is decreasing in the degree of asymmetry in the market but more so for movers, we must identify markets where information spreads more and less easily. My identification comes from differences in the degree to which communicating with outsiders is an important task for the job. The idea is that when a worker is interacting with clients or others outside the firm, information about that worker's quality can spread. For example, in professional service occupations (e.g., consultants, and lawyers in law firms), interacting with clients is common and can be quite valuable for career prospects in that many workers in these jobs are in-housed by their clients.26 In addition, the marketing literature emphasizes that in the professional services sector, longterm relationships between service providers and clients are common, in large part because clients can generate referrals and increase outside credentials (see for example Halinen 1997).  \n\nTo measure the importance of this communication task I use O\\*NET 4.0 (formerly the Dictionary of Occupation Titles), which contains information on the task content of jobs.27 The task of interest for my purposes is \"Communicating with Persons Outside Organization.\" All occupations are rated in both the level and relative importance of this work activity on a scale from 0 to 7. To gain some intuition on this measure, appendix table B.2 shows the average rating for somewhat aggregated 3-digit 1970 Census Occupation codes, sorted from highest to lowest in the relative importance of communicating outside the firm, with the level of communication also shown.28 As can be seen, salespeople and service workers (such as counselors, lawyers, teachers, and health care workers) are towards the top, while scientists, engineers, operatives, craftsmen and cleaners are towards the bottom. In this paper, I divide occupations into four groups representing quartiles of this measure, hereafter called communication groups, and use these as my source of variation in $X$ (the degree of asymmetry). I use the measure of relative importance, rather than level, because I believe that is closest in spirit to $X$ . However, these measures are highly correlated and results are similar when the level of importance is used.29  \n\n$^{29}$ In a previous version of this paper, I compared professonal service workers to professional non-service workers, arguing that service workers have more outside communication and therefore should be in more symmetric markets. Results using this strategy are very similar and are available upon request.  \n\ndicts that lower ability workers are more likely to leave whereas the symmetric learning model predicts turnover is random. Therefore, I look at whether workers who leave jobs with higher levels of outside communication appear less negatively selected (when compared with stayers) than workers who leave jobs with less outside communication.  \n\nTable 2 summarizes regressions yielding differences in characteristics between movers and stayers, within communication group, relative to the lowest quartile group.30 The table also shows the main effect for moving and shows movers are indeed negatively selected; they have lower AFQT scores, years of school, and tenure in the year before they moved, relative to stayers. This is consistent with the asymmetric information model and also with Schonberg (2007) who finds a roughly similar effect for AFQT in these same data. However, I also find movers have larger log wage changes between periods, consistent with work by Topel and Ward (1992), and many others, who show young workers tend to move to better opportunities and obtain higher pay increases upon moving.  \n\nMore importantly, the coefficients on moving interacted with communication group are for the most part positive and significant. That is, the mover effects for workers in jobs with higher outside communication are less negative than workers who left jobs in lower communication groups. In addition, the final column of table 2 looks at the probability of being laid off or fired conditional on moving between periods. It reveals that workers in higher communication groups are less likely to leave their jobs involuntarily, another indication that they are less negatively selected. This finding that movers from markets with less outside communication are more negatively selected reinforces my hypothesis that they are in more markets where information is more asymmetric.  \n\n## 4.1 Methodology  \n\nFirst, I estimate a pay-change regression of the form specified in equation 12 and obtain the residuals.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{L w a g e_{i j t}-L w a g e_{i j,t-1}}}&{{=}}&{{\\alpha_{0}+\\alpha_{1}I_{i j t}^{\\mathrm{stay}}+\\alpha_{2}^{\\prime}I_{i j}^{\\mathrm{unemp}}+\\alpha_{3}^{\\prime}I_{i j}^{\\mathrm{comm}}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{+\\alpha_{4}^{\\prime}[I_{i j t}^{\\mathrm{stay}}*I_{i j}^{\\mathrm{unemp}}]+\\alpha_{5}^{\\prime}[I_{i j t}^{\\mathrm{stay}}*I_{i j}^{\\mathrm{comm}}]}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{+\\alpha_{6}^{\\prime}Y_{i}+\\alpha_{7}^{\\prime}Z_{i j t}+\\alpha_{8}^{\\prime}[I_{i t}^{\\mathrm{comm}}*I_{i t-1}^{\\mathrm{comm}}]+\\varepsilon_{i j t}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFor a worker, $i$ , holding job, $j$ , in year $t-1$ (but not necessarily in year $t$ ), I regress log wage change on an indicator for whether the worker stayed in job $j$ between periods $t$ and $t-1\\left(I_{i j t}^{\\mathrm{stay}}\\right)$ vectors of entry unemployment rate group fixed effets $(I_{i j}^{\\mathrm{unemp}})$ and communication group fixed effets $\\big(I_{i j}^{\\mathrm{comm}}\\big)$ where both refer to the job held in $t-1$ , interactions of each of these with whether the worker stayed, a main effect for staying and a set of control variables.31 $Y_{i}$ is a vector of time-invariant controls, while $Z_{i j t}$ is a vector of time-varying controls.32 Lastly, I control for interactions of communication group in year $t$ with communication group in year $t-1$ . Appendix table B3 shows summary statistics.  \n\nThe goal with the first-stage equation is to condition on characteristics the employer can observe at the start of the employment relationship. The residuals obtained from this regression arguably yield a better empirical analogue to the spirit of the model (than simply using log wage changes), where ability,  \n\nμ, is unobservable.33  \n\nI then measure the variance of these log wage-change residuals using the squared residuals from the first-stage regression. The variance of wage-change residuals for a particular group of workers, $g$ ,equals $E[\\varepsilon_{i j t}^{2}|g]-(E[\\varepsilon_{i j t}|g])^{2}$ The residuals are purged of group fixed-effects in the first-stage regression (where group is job-entry cohort or communication group, each interacted with staying), so $E[\\varepsilon_{i j t}|g]=0$ . Thus the variance can be characterized by the $\\varepsilon_{i j t}^{2}$  \n\nTo be precise, equation 13 shows the second-stage regression. This regression includes some of the controls from the first stage and is robust to the inclusion of others.35 Because employer learning should be most prevalent early in a worker's career, I also present results where this and the first-stage equation are restricted to workers with very low tenure (those who have been with their employer less than 2 years when the $t-1$ wage is measured).  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}{\\mathrm{\\Lambda}_{i j t}^{\\mathrm{2}}}&{=}&{\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}I_{i j t}^{\\mathrm{stay}}+\\beta_{2}^{\\prime}I_{i j}^{\\mathrm{unemp}}+\\beta_{3}^{\\prime}I_{i j}^{\\mathrm{comm}}+\\beta_{4}^{\\prime}\\big[I_{i j t}^{\\mathrm{stay}}*I_{i j}^{\\mathrm{unemp}}\\big]+\\beta_{5}^{\\prime}\\big[I_{i j t}^{\\mathrm{stay}}*I_{i j}^{\\mathrm{comm}}}\\ &{}&{+\\beta_{6}^{\\prime}Y_{i}+\\beta_{7}^{\\prime}\\big[I_{i t}^{\\mathrm{comm}}*I_{i t-1}^{\\mathrm{comm}}\\big]+\\nu_{i j t}}\\ &{}&{(13\\\n$$  \n\nThe difference-in-differences estimates, $\\beta_{4}^{\\prime}$ , correspond to $d d_{\\sigma}$ from equation 10, while the $\\beta_{5}^{\\prime}$ correspond to $d d_{X}$ from equation 11. Recall from the previous section, a finding of $d d_{\\sigma}<0$ and $d d_{X}<0$ are consistent with asymmetric information. The former implies that the decreased ability variance seen in cohorts matching to a firm in a recession compared to those matching in a boom has a larger compressing effect on the distribution of pay changes for stayers relative to movers. The latter implies that the decrease in the degree of asymmetry seen in jobs with more outside communication, relative to less, has a larger widening effect on the wage change distribution of movers compared to that of stayers.  \n\nAs noted above, the spread of wage changes may differ for movers, relative to stayers for reasons outside the scope of the model. Furthermore, there is surely non-random selection into job-entry cohorts and communication groups, so we might expect the spread of wage changes to differ as well. My differencein-differences strategy allows me to control for all of these factors with fixed effects for each group (represented by $\\gamma^{s t a y},\\gamma^{\\sigma}$ ,and, $\\gamma^{X}$ in equation 5). Importantly, the key identifying assumption is that there is no differential selection in turnover across groups outside that specified in the model, i.e., $\\gamma^{s t a y}$ is the same across job-entry cohorts and is the same across communication groups. Below I provide evidence that similar turnover is a reasonable assumption in this case.  \n\nOne way in which job-entry or communication groups could differ is in their human capital investments, an issue left unaddressed in the model. The impact of group-level diferences in human capital accumulation on the wage will be absorbed in the group fixed effects, however differential accumulation within groups across movers and stayers would not. I therefore control for self-reported investments in training in the first stage (results are very similar when I also include training in the second stage regression).36  \n\nOne final note on clustering. For the job cohorts analysis, the right level of clustering is the entry year. For the communication group analysis, clustering at the 3-digit 1970 Census occupation level makes most sense. One could also make the case for clustering at the individual level since workers can appear in multiple jobs over the sample period. As a general rule of thumb, clustering at the most aggregated level is most conservative. I thus cluster at the entry year level. This is indeed the more conservative choice since I find that statistical significance always weakly increases when clustering on three-digit occupation or at the individual level.  \n\n# 5 Results  \n\nIn this section, I test propositions 1 and 2, and address the main identifying assumption that turnover rates do not differ systematically across groups, except via mechanisms specified in the model. I also use these estimates to provide two approximations for $X$ , the degree of asymmetry, in the economy as a whole. Proposition 1 says that under asymmetric information, the variance in wage changes of stayers responds more to different variances in ability than does the variance of wage changes for movers. This is because the wage offers of outside firms are less linked to individual workers’ abilities. I test this by exploiting variation in ability distributions across job-entry cohorts, where those who entered in worse economies have a lower variance in ability - likely due to their negative selection since a smaller share of them were voluntary quitters on their previous job. Proposition 2 says that under asymmetric information, the variance in wage changes of stayers responds less to different levels of asymmetry than does the variance of wage changes for movers. This is because the degree of asymmetry impacts outside firm expectations, a larger component of outside wage offers than incumbent wage offers. The empirical implementation is to compare jobs with different degrees of communication outside the firm (using measures from O $^*$ NET), hypothesizing that more information about worker quality is transmitted to outside firms in jobs with higher communication levels.  \n\n## 5.1 Propositions 1 and 2  \n\nTable 3 summarizes the core set of results for this paper, regressions of the form specified in equation 13. The dependent variable is squared residuals from the log wage change regression and the goal is to estimate differences in the variance in wage changes. Recall the interactions of staying at the firm and job-entry cohort or communication group ( $\\beta_{4}^{\\prime}$ and $\\beta_{5}^{\\prime}$ )test propositions 1 and 2 in the model. I report these interactions, as well as the main effect for staying, and highlight in particular the highest unemployment rate and communication groups, relative to the lowest, since these should yield the sharpest contrast.  \n\nNote first that the coefficient on staying is always negative and significant. This is expected since there are many match-specific factors outside the scope of themodel $(\\gamma^{s t a y})$ which remain constant when a worker stays at a firm (for example, compensating differentials) and vary when workers move firms. These are important to control for through the inclusion of this main effect for staying.  \n\nThe first two columns show results for the full sample and the low tenure sample, respectively. Here we see that the difference-in-differences estimate for the worst economy entry cohorts, relative to the best, are negative and statistically significant at the 1% level. The magnitude is larger in the low tenure sample, where employer learning should be more important. I find, in the low tenure sample, that the variance in log pay changes is 0.056 more compressed for stayers, relative to movers, among those entering in the worst, compared to the best, economy. The coefficients on the other entry cohort interactions fall in magnitude, basically as would be expected, given these groups should be more similar to the lowest unemployment rate group. Wage changes are thus lower variance for workers who enter firms in a bad economy than a good one and stay, relative to this comparison among movers. Since these entrants are also lower variance in ability, this finding is consistent with proposition 1, that differences in worker ability distributions are more strongly reflected in the wage change distributions of stayers, relative to movers.  \n\nThe first two columns of table 3 also present results consistent with proposition 2. The difference-in-difference estimates for the highest communication group, relative to the lowest, are negative and, in the low tenure case, statistically significant at the 5% level. $^{37}$ I find, in the low tenure sample, that the variance in log pay changes is 0.083 more compressed for stayers, relative to movers, among those in the highest, compared to the lowest, communication group. Moving to lower communication groups also reduces the magnitude of the coefficients in an expected way, given these groups are more similar to the lowest group. Wage changes are thus more compressed for stayers, relative to movers, in the more symmetric market. Or, moving to a more symmetric market, widens the wage change distribution for movers more than for stayers, supporting proposition 2.  \n\nTable 3 also provides estimates separately by education, a BA or more in the second set of columns and less than a BA in the third set of columns. This is of interest since Schonberg finds some evidence in favor of asymmetric learning among college graduates but not among high school graduates. My findings here are inconclusive.  \n\nThe estimates of $d d_{X}$ (communication groups） are larger in magnitude, negative and statistically significant (consistent with proposition 2) for the high education group, but for the low education group, though magnitudes are sizeable, estimates are not statistically significant. These estimates thus lend some support to the Schonberg finding, that asymmetric information may be present in the college graduates market. On the other hand, the estimates of $d d_{\\sigma}$ are large in magnitude, negative and statistically significant (consistent with proposition 1) in the low education group, but not in the high one (though the magnitude in the low tenure case is sizeable). However, though not shown, I find that variances in the characteristics shown in table 1 do not differ significantly across groups among the high educated. Therefore we would not expect the same predictions for the dispersion of wage changes. This particular identification strategy is therefore not well-suited to identifying differences in the degree of asymmetry across education groups.  \n\nI would therefore note my findings are broadly consistent with the pre vious literature, since most papers find support for asymmetric information. Schonberg, on the other hand, fails to reject the symmetric learning model overall, though has some weak evidence in favor among college graduates. Several factors could be contributing to the differences in our findings. First, as I noted in the introduction, the AFQT approach requires several strong assumptions that my approach does not. This could easily yield different conclusions. A particularly important assumption in Schonberg's analysis is that turnover is only driven by the mechanisms specified in her model. She does not account for the impacts of compensating differentials, search theory, match quality, and ability sorting (among others) on the turnover decision. My model also abstracts away from these factors, but I have shown that I can empirically account for them via $\\gamma^{s t a y}$ , the fixed effect for staying. I rely on the weaker assumption that these factors do not differentially impact turnover across job entry groups or communication groups. An additional assumption of the AFQT approach, which Schonberg notes, is that it is best suited to test whether firms learn about cognitive ability of workers, while my approach does not have such a restriction. It could therefore be the case that asymmetric learning about non-cognitive skills is most important. Lastly, I would say that though Schonberg cannot reject the symmetric learning model, her standard errors are large enough that she cannot rule out a large role for asymmetric learning either.  \n\nMore generally, the AFQT approach can only evaluate employer learning about the component of worker productivity measured before workers begin their labor market experience (since the AFQT was administered in the NLSY when most respondents were teenagers). Lange (2007) finds, using a symmetric learning model, that employers learn quite quickly about productivity differences that exist at the beginning of the career. Therefore, we might not expect much scope for asymmetric learning about these initial productivity differences. However, Kahn and Lange (2012) find, using proprietary data on pay and repeat performance evaluations, that productivity continues to evolve in unpredictable ways as workers age and show that employer learning is important at all stages of the life-cycle. It is therefore plausible that asymmetric learning is also an important mechanism in the labor market, even if asymmetric learning about productivity differences contained in AFQT score is not.  \n\n## 5.2 Turnover Rates  \n\nAs highlighted above, my empirical strategy identifies $d d_{\\sigma}$ and $d d_{X}$ basedon the interactions of job-entry group or communication group and staying at the firm. Thus, I cannot have differential mobility across groups, outside that which is specifically modeled. Looking directly at turnover rates across these groups is tempting, since that will give some indication. However, it is easy to show that in my asymmetric information model, turnover is higher among workers with lower variance ability and in markets where learning less asymmetric. Thus, we should expect to see higher turnover rates among those who matched to firms in the worst economies and those in the highest communication group.  \n\nTable 4 summarizes regression results where I estimate the probability of staying at the firm on the job-entry and communication group main effects. Columns labeled $\"1\"$ include the same set of controls used in the wage change equations (except the second period variables). Though not statistically significant, these coefficients on the highest unemployment rate group are negative in both samples, consistent with the model. $38$ I will use the estimates in my second approximation of $X$ , below. The coefficients on the highest communication group are positive, though very close to zero. Note, I do not view this as a direct test of my model since I have not shown that the derivatives of the probability of staying with respect to $\\sigma^{2}$ and $X$ are empirically identified - recall the importance of $\\gamma^{s t a y},\\gamma^{\\sigma}$ , and $\\gamma^{X}$ in the implementation section.  \n\nColumns labeled $\"2\"$ in table 4 additionally control for age-adjusted AFQT and log wage in $t-1$ . The hope is that these variables help to pick up the mobility effects specified in the model. AFQT can give some indication of unobserved ability and should thus control for the negative selection of movers predicted in the model. Wages in the model incorporate incumbent and outside firm expectations, which are both a function of the degree of asymmetry and worker ability. The relationship is obviously rough at best. Still, we see in most instances, the magnitudes on the coefficients of interest reduce with the inclusion of these controls.  \n\nGiven the lack of statistical significance and the relatively small magnitudes (compared to the sample mean for staying of $65\\%$ ) presented in table 4, I find little evidence that is inconsistent with my identifying assumption.39 Turnover in this sample is obviously important to account for, beyond the mechanisms of adverse selection and the random disutility shock specified in my model, especially because workers in this sample are young and move jobs often (see for example Topel and Ward 1992). In fact, the average worker in my sample has held slightly more than 6 jobs. However, because workers in my sample are young and move jobs often, my identifying assumption that workers across job entry and communication groups do not face differential turnover decisions (beyond those specified in the model) may be less worrisome.  \n\n## 5.3 The Size of $X$  \n\nTable 3 provides evidence consistent with propositions 1 and 2, and therefore consistent with asymmetric learning being prevalent in the labor market. The question, then, is how prevalent, or how important? To answer that question, we would like to estimate $X$ , the degree of asymmetry. In this subsection, I provide two rough approximations of $X$ , implied by my model. Both have advantages and disadvantages, discussed in more detail below, and are meant to serve as a guide for interpreting the coefficients in table 3. Interestingly, though, methods 1 and 2 arrive at roughly similar values for $X$ . Both are described in detail in appendix A.4.  \n\nMethod #1   One way to solve for $X$ is by taking the ratio of $\\partial_{\\sigma}$ and $\\partial_{X}$ , the derivatives of $V^{s t a y}-V^{m o v e}$ with respect to $\\sigma^{2}$ and $X$ , respectively (equations 11 and 12 in the appendix) and solving. It is easy to show that $\\textstyle{\\frac{\\partial_{\\sigma}}{\\partial_{X}}}={\\frac{X}{\\sigma^{2}}}$ ， which yields a nice, tractable equation for finding $X$ . In section 3, above, I showed how the empirical analogues, $d d_{\\sigma}$ and $d d_{X}$ , relate to these derivatives. Substituting in and solving for $X$ , we get equation 14.  \n\n$$\nX=\\frac{d d_{\\sigma}}{d d_{X}}\\frac{\\sigma^{2}\\triangle X}{\\triangle\\sigma^{2}}\n$$  \n\nWe have empirical estimates of $d d_{\\sigma}$ and $d d_{X}$ . Specifically, I take $\\beta_{4}$ from the highest unemployment rate group and $\\beta_{5}$ from the highest communication group (see regression equation 13) estimated on the low tenure sample. However we do not have estimates of the other terms. In particular, we would like to know the relative sizes of variation in $\\sigma^{2}$ and $X$ (normed by $\\sigma^{2}$ )induced by moving from highest to lowest national unemployment rate entry cohorts and communication groups, respectively. Unfortunately, my measure of the degree of asymmetry is categorical - the importance of communication outside the firm ranges from 0 to 7. Thus I cannot measure which exercise results in a larger shift. Instead, I provide a plausible range for $X$ by varying $\\textstyle{\\frac{\\sigma^{2}\\Delta X}{\\Delta\\sigma^{2}}}$ from 0.8 to 1.2. That is, I vary the relative magnitudes from a shift across entry cohorts having 80% the impact on $\\sigma^{2}$ that a shift across communication groups has on $X$ (normed by $\\sigma^{2}$ ) to the reverse.  \n\nTable 5 shows these approximations of $X$ . I find that the degree of asymmetry ranges from 0.54 to 0.81. This range of estimates implies a large role for asymmetric learning. However, the ad hoc calibration of $\\textstyle{\\frac{\\sigma^{2}\\Delta X}{\\Delta\\sigma^{2}}}$ is somewhat unsatisfying as it produces a fairly wide range of estimates. I therefore provide an additional approximation of $X$ , below, which uses a series of equations from my model to solve for $X$ and the additional unknowns.  \n\nMethod #2  This method uses the difference-in-differences equation for $d d_{\\sigma}$ (derived by combining equations 6-9, above). This is a function of four unknowns: $\\sigma_{H}^{2},\\sigma_{L}^{2},X$ and $\\theta$ . I therefore need 3 other equations or identifying assumptions to obtain a solution for $X$ . I start with the probability that a group of workers stays with the incumbent firm, which is empirically estimable and is analytically a function of $X,\\theta$ , and the relevant $\\sigma^{2}$ . Using two groups of workers, the high unemployment rate group and the low unemployment rate group, I can easily estimate the probability that each group stays with their incumbent, and have done so in table 4. This yields two more equations to be used in identifying $X$ . I then employ one more empirical assumption, explained next, to pin down $\\triangle\\sigma^{2}=\\sigma_{L}^{2}-\\sigma_{H}^{2}$ , leaving me with 4 equations and 4 unknowns. Equation 18 in the appendix uses these to solve for $X$ .40  \n\nTo pin down $\\triangle\\sigma^{2}$ , the difference in the variance in ability between the high- and low-variance groups, I take advantage of AFQT score. As discussed above, AFQT is an aptitude test score that has been shown to be correlated with productivity.41 I showed in table 1 that the highest unemployment rate entry cohort has a substantially smaller variance in AFQT score, compared to the lowest unemployment rate entry cohort and I use that difference here.42  \n\nrange of estimates.  \n\nDiscussion  Translating these estimates into differential speeds of employer learning provides a useful interpretation. Lange (2007) defines the speed of employer learning as the relative weight employers place on the first new signal of ability. Though his is a multi-period model and mine is a two-period model, we could roughly borrow his definition and in this case, the speed of employer learning equals $1-X$ . As Lange points out, the speed of employer learning is nicely interpreted as the reduction in expectation errors over worker productivity in one period of learning. In my case, reduction in expectation errors is relative to the incumbent whose initial expectation errors decline by $100\\%$ ,by assumption.  \n\nThe second row of table 5 shows that the speed of employer learning ranges from 0.19 to 0.46, in method #1, and equal to 0.31 in method $\\#2$ .Thus expectation errors over initial productivity decline by roughly $31\\%$ of their decline in incumbents. In other words, I estimate that outside firms learn only roughly a third of what incumbents learn. Thus, using either method, I find a sizeable role for asymmetric information.  \n\nRoughly speaking, we could extend the learning process specified in my model to a multi-period model where outside firms receive a signal of worker quality each period that contains the same noise structure. As shown in the third row, my estimates would imply that in 5 periods outside frms have learned 54%-81% of what incumbents learned in the first period. In other words, after 5 periods, outside firms have learned roughly 70% (from method #2) of what incumbents learned in the first period.  \n\nThe two methods produce remarkable consistent estimates despite their different identifying assumptions. Method #2 has the advantage of being able to pin down one estimate of $X$ , as opposed to the range produced in method $\\#1$ . It has the disadvantage that I need to use equations from the model that I have not shown to be empirically identified. It also requires a further assumption on $\\triangle\\sigma^{2}$ , for which I use AFQT score. Method #1 is nice in that it only uses empirical estimates which I have shown are identified ( $d d_{\\sigma}$ and  \n\n$d d_{X}$ )and it takes advantage of empirical variation in both $\\sigma^{2}$ and $X$ ,while method #2 only exploits variation in $\\sigma^{2}$ . However, it requires an assumption Babout $\\frac{\\sigma^{2}\\triangle X}{\\triangle\\sigma^{2}}$   \nof estimates as a way of interpreting the main coefficients of interest in table 3, though I caution against taking them too literally.  \n\n# 6 Conclusion  \n\nThis paper seeks to establish whether asymmetric employer learning is prevalent in the labor market. I derive a model which embeds both symmetric and asymmetric learning and develop empirical predictions about the variance in pay changes to test for the prevalence of asymmetric learning. I then test the model using two identification strategies. The first exploits differences in job-entry cohorts to test comparative statics over the variance in ability. The second tests comparative statics over the degree of asymmetry in the market, using variation across occupations in the degree to which communicating outside one's firm is an important task. Both predictions are supported in the data. Finally, I show that the magnitude of the degree of asymmetry is economically important. I find that outside firms have sizeable expectation errors over worker ability, relative to the incumbent. In one period, outside firms reduce expectation errors by roughly a third of the incumbent's reduction.  \n\nThese results are consistent with most of the previous empirical work in this area, though there have only been a few papers. Despite examining very different samples, Gibbons and Katz (1991), DeVaro and Waldman (2012), and Acemoglu and Pischke (1998) all find strong support for asymmetric information.4 Pinkston (2009) and Zhang (2007) use the NLSY (comparing the return to AFQT score across tenure versus experience) and find evidence consistent with asymmetric learning. However, as previously discussed, Schonberg (2007) does not. Besides differences in assumptions, my methodology allows me to test for asymmetric learning about both cognitive and non-cognitive ability and about ability as it evolves over time, while the use of AFQT score is best thought of as a correlate of cognitive ability measured before labor market entry. A fruitful avenue for future research would be to investigate the relative importance of learning about each of these components of ability.  \n\nThe previous literature and the current paper, therefore, largely support the existence of asymmetric information and its prevalence. These findings then beg the question: what is the impact of asymmetric information on worker mobility, investments in human capital and allocating workers to jobs and tasks? Furthermore, what policies have firms already implemented to take advantage of their information rents? The model presented in this paper is useful in that it provides a methodology to study learning in a variety of settings without requiring particularly demanding datasets. Extensions could clarify thinking about the effects asymmetric information has on contracting, promotion policy, human capital investment and turnover behavior and perhaps policies that could alleviate inefficiencies.  \n\n# References  \n\n[1] Acemoglu, D. and J.-S.

Denote the equilibrium outside wage offer as $v^{*}(s)$ . The incumbent firm's problem and solution are as follows.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}&{}&{\\operatorname*{max}F_{\\theta}(w(\\mu,s)-v^{*}(s))(\\mu-w(\\mu,s))}\\ &{}&{w(\\mu,s)}\\ &{}&{w^{*}(\\mu,s)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{\\frac{v^{*}(s)+\\mu-\\bar{\\theta}}{2}}&{\\mu-v^{*}(s)\\in[-\\bar{\\theta},3\\bar{\\theta}]}\\ {v^{*}(s)+\\bar{\\theta}}&{\\mu-v^{*}(s)>3\\bar{\\theta}}\\end{array}\\right\\}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIt is easy to show that the objective function is strictly quasi-concave when $w(\\mu,s)-v(s)\\in[-\\bar{\\theta},\\bar{\\theta}]$ . Thus the interior solution is indeed a maximum and is unique. We also have a corner solution for large $\\mu$ . Below, I discuss how I deal with $\\mu$ Outside the middle range.  \n\nOutside firms set a wage schedule, $v(s)$ , equal to expected productivity conditional on leaving the firm and on $s$ , taking incumbent firm behavior $(w^{*}(\\mu,s))$ , as given. Bayes' rule yields the following expression, where $\\pi(.)$ is the posterior pdf of $\\mu$ conditional on $s$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{v^{*}(s)}&{=E(\\mu|\\mathrm{move})=\\frac{\\displaystyle\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\mu*(1-F_{\\theta}(w^{*}(\\mu,s)-v(s))*\\pi(\\mu|s)d\\mu}{1-F_{\\theta}(w^{*}(\\mu,s)-v(s))}}\\ &{=\\frac{\\displaystyle\\int_{-\\infty}^{v^{*}(s)-\\bar{\\theta}}\\mu*1*\\pi(\\mu|s)d\\mu+\\int_{v^{*}(s)-\\bar{\\theta}}^{v^{*}(s)+3\\bar{\\theta}}\\mu*\\frac{-w^{*}(\\mu,s)+v(s)+\\bar{\\theta}}{2\\bar{\\theta}}\\pi(\\mu|s)d\\mu}{\\displaystyle\\int_{-\\infty}^{v^{*}(s)-\\bar{\\theta}}1*\\pi(\\mu|s)d\\mu+\\int_{v^{*}(s)-\\bar{\\theta}}^{v^{*}(s)+3\\bar{\\theta}}\\frac{-w^{*}(\\mu,s)+v(s)+\\bar{\\theta}}{2\\bar{\\theta}}\\pi(\\mu|s)d\\mu}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIn order to obtain a closed-form solution, let us only focus on the portion of the distribution s.t. $\\mu|s\\in[v^{*}(s)-\\bar{\\theta},v^{*}(s)+3\\bar{\\theta}]$ . For now, let us assume that the entire distribution, $\\pi(.)$ , falls in this interval. In this case, I can replace equation 1 with equation 2. In other words I assume that all types have some probability of leaving that is strictly between O and 1. When the variance over the distribution of $\\mu|s$ is small, relative to the variance of $\\theta$ , this will be true for almost all workers. I formalize this condition in the following subsection. By plugging in for Pr(staylμ,s) = u(u-3)-(s)+0 and $\\begin{array}{r}{w^{\\ast}(\\mu,s)=\\frac{v^{\\ast}(s)+\\mu-\\theta}{2}}\\end{array}$ I solve for $v^{*}(s)$ as follows.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{v^{*}(s)}&{=}&{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\mu*\\frac{-w^{*}(\\mu,s)+v(s)+\\bar{\\theta}}{2\\bar{\\theta}}\\pi(\\mu|s)d\\mu}{\\displaystyle\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{-w^{*}(\\mu,s)+v(s)+\\bar{\\theta}}{2\\bar{\\theta}}\\pi(\\mu|s)d\\mu}}\\ &{=}&{\\displaystyle\\frac{E(\\mu|s)(3\\bar{\\theta}+v^{*}(s))-E(\\mu^{2}|s)}{3\\bar{\\theta}+v^{*}(s)-E(\\mu|s)}}\\ {0}&{=}&{\\displaystyle(v^{*}(s))^{2}+v^{*}(s)(3\\bar{\\theta}-2E(\\mu|s))-E(\\mu|s)3\\bar{\\theta}+E(\\mu^{2}|s)}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nUsing the quadratic formula, I solve for the roots of this equation. This is shown below where we know from DeGroot (2004) that the posterior distribution of $\\mu$ , conditional on $s$ , is normal with mean $m X+s(1-X)$ and variance $X\\sigma^{2}$  \n\n$$\nv^{*}(s)=m X+s(1-X)-\\frac{3}{2}\\bar{\\theta}\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-X\\sigma^{2}}\n$$  \n\nThe model yields two pure-strategy equilibria, both of which are intuitive.1 The right root implies high period 2 wages and high turnover while the left root yields low period 2 wages and low turnover. If many workers leave the incumbent firm then outside firms attribute high ability to them and offer a high wage, thus the incumbent must offer high wages to keep workers. In contrast, if only a few workers leave the firm, outside firms attribute a low ability to them and offer them a low wage, allowing the incumbent to offer a low wage. However, the left root is not stable, since if another outside firm offers a slightly higher wage, that firm will attract workers AND earn a positive profit. The right root is stable since if another outside firm offers a slightly higher wage, that firm will attract all workers but make negative profit. Whereas, if an outside firm offers a slightly lower wage, that firm would attract no workers. Thus, I restrict attention to the right root for the rest of the analysis -though all results hold for the left root as well.  \n\n### A.1.1  Placing a condition on $X\\sigma^{2}$  \n\nTo obtain a closed form solution to equation 1 above, I assumed that all values of the distribution of $\\mu|s$ fall in the interval $[v^{\\ast}(s)-\\bar{\\theta},v^{\\ast}(s)+3\\bar{\\theta}]$ . That is, I solved for $v^{*}(s)$ assuming that the probability of moving was strictly between $0$ and 1 for all types of workers. This will be nearly correct if the distribution of $\\theta$ is much higher variant than the distribution of $\\mu|s$ . If so then even a very high- $\\mu$ worker could be induced to leave due to a negative utility shock and a low- $\\mu$ worker could be induced to stay due to a positive utility shock.  \n\nI now formalize this notion by deriving conditions under which a large portion of the distribution of $\\mu|s$ falls in the above interval. I define \"large portion\" as 99% of the distribution (or within $\\pm3$ standard deviations since $\\mu|s$ is normally distributed). When this is the case, any error created by assuming $100\\%$ is minimal and will not affect the comparative statics derived below.  \n\nDefine $\\Delta(\\mu,s)=w^{*}(\\mu,s)-v^{*}(s)$ and plug in the solutions from above to  \n\nget the following.  \n\n$$\n\\Delta(\\mu,s)={\\frac{1}{2}}(\\mu-m X-s(1-X)+{\\frac{1}{2}}\\bar{\\theta}-\\sqrt{{\\frac{9}{4}}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-X\\sigma^{2}})\n$$  \n\nFor values of $\\mu$ and $s$ such that $-\\bar{\\theta}\\leq\\Delta(\\mu,s)\\leq\\bar{\\theta}$ , the probability of moving is strictly greater than O and strictly less than 1 and we will therefore be in the desired interval. Let us define a new variable, $z=\\mu-m X-s(1-X)$ It is easy to show that $z\\sim N(0,X\\sigma^{2})$ . For ease of notation define $\\sigma_{z}^{2}=X\\sigma^{2}$ Therefore we are interested in the probability that the following inequality holds. We now want to solve for the relationship between $\\sigma_{z}$ and $\\theta$ such that the interval $z\\in[-3\\sigma_{z},3\\sigma_{z}]$ (3 standard deviations of $z$ ) always lies within the above inequality, or such that equation 3 holds.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l l}{{-\\displaystyle{\\frac{5}{2}}{\\bar{\\theta}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}{\\bar{\\theta}}^{2}-\\sigma_{z}^{2}}}}&{{\\leq}}&{{z\\leq\\displaystyle{\\frac{3}{2}}{\\bar{\\theta}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}{\\bar{\\theta}}^{2}-\\sigma_{z}^{2}}}}\\ {{-\\displaystyle{\\frac{5}{2}}{\\bar{\\theta}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}{\\bar{\\theta}}^{2}-\\sigma_{z}^{2}}}}&{{\\leq}}&{{-3\\sigma_{z}~\\mathrm{AND}~3\\sigma_{z}\\leq\\displaystyle{\\frac{3}{2}}{\\bar{\\theta}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}{\\bar{\\theta}}^{2}-\\sigma_{z}^{2}}}}\\ {{i f f~\\sigma_{z}}}&{{\\leq}}&{{\\bar{\\theta}(\\displaystyle{\\frac{15-\\sqrt{65}}{20}})\\approx\\displaystyle{\\frac{7}{20}}{\\bar{\\theta}}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIt is easy to show that the solution is as given in equation 4. This is easily interpreted considering the standard deviation of $\\theta$ (a uniformly distributed variable in the interval [0, 0]) is · Therefore when the standard deviation over the posterior of $\\mu$ conditional on $s$ is approximately $60\\%$ of the standard deviation of $\\theta$ or less, 99% of workers will have a probability of leaving strictly greater than O and less than 1. The remainder of the theory appendix assumes that $100\\%$ of works do.  \n\nNote also that if this condition holds, ${\\textstyle\\frac{9}{4}}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}>X\\sigma^{2}$ , and $v^{*}(s)$ has only real solutions.  \n\n## A.2 Solving for the first-period wage, $w_{0}$  \n\nAssuming no discounting, the incumbent firm's ex-ante expected profits, II, are as follows.  \n\n$$\n\\Pi=E[\\mu]-w_{0}+E[(\\mu-w(\\mu,s))|s t a y]\n$$  \n\nSetting $\\Pi=0$ allows me to solve for $w_{0}$ as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{w_{0}}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle{m+\\frac{\\displaystyle\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}(\\mu-w(\\mu,s))\\operatorname*{Pr}(s t a y|\\mu,s)\\operatorname*{Pr}(\\mu|s)\\operatorname*{Pr}(s)d\\mu d s}{\\operatorname*{Pr}(s t a y)}}}}\\ {{}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle{m+\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{X\\sigma^{2}}{\\frac{5}{2}\\bar{\\theta}-\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-X\\sigma^{2}}}+\\frac{5}{2}\\bar{\\theta}-\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-X\\sigma^{2}})}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nNote that $w_{0}$ equals ex-ante expected ability, $m$ , plus a positive constant. In period 2, the incumbent makes positive profits due to its information rents and must therefore pay the worker above average productivity in period 1 to balance this. It is easy to show that $w_{0}$ is increasing in $X$ , the degree to which information in the market is asymmetric. When outside firms have less information, the period 2 quasi rent of the incumbent firm is larger.  \n\n## A.3 Variance in wage changes  \n\nIn this subsection, I derive the variance of pay changes for workers who stay at the firm (i.e., workers who accept offer $w^{*}$ ) and workers who move firms (accept $v^{*}$ ). I then prove propositions 1 and 2. Starting from the following expression for $\\Delta w^{s t a y}$ , I derive the variance.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{\\Delta w^{s t a y}}}&{{=}}&{{\\frac{1}{2}(\\mu+m X+s(1-X)-\\frac{5}{2}\\bar{\\theta}+\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-X\\sigma^{2}})-w_{0}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{\\mathit{\\zeta}_{a r}(\\Delta w^{s t a y})}}&{{=}}&{{\\frac{1}{4}(V a r(\\mu|s t a y)+(1-X)^{2}V a r(s|s t a y)+2(1-X)C o v(\\mu,s|s t a y)-\\bar{\\theta}-\\bar{\\theta})}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nTaking each piece at a time, I first solve for $V a r(\\mu|s t a y)$ . This uses the fact that the variance of the posterior distribution of $\\mu$ $V a r(\\mu|s)$ , is a constant,  \n\nthanks to the normality assumptions. Using the law of iterated expectations, $V a r(\\mu|s t a y)=E[E(\\mu^{2}|s t a y,s)|s t a y]-(E[E(\\mu|s t a y,s)|s t a y])^{2}.$ Therefore we have  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{\\gamma_{a r}(\\mu|s t a y)}&{=}&{\\displaystyle\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\mu^{2}\\frac{\\mathrm{Pr}(s t a y|\\mu,s)\\mathrm{Pr}(\\mu|s)\\mathrm{Pr}(s)}{\\mathrm{Pr}(s t a y|s)}d\\mu d s}\\ &&{\\displaystyle-(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\mathrm{Pr}(s t a y|\\mu,s)\\mathrm{Pr}(\\mu|s)\\mathrm{Pr}(s)}{\\mathrm{Pr}(s t a y|s)}d\\mu d s)^{2}}\\ &{=}&{\\displaystyle\\frac{E(\\mu^{3})-E[E(\\mu^{2}|s)E(\\mu|s)]-V a r(\\mu|s)E(\\mu)}{\\frac{5}{2}\\bar{\\theta}-\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-X\\sigma^{2}}}-\\frac{(V a r(\\mu|s))}{(\\frac{5}{2}\\bar{\\theta}-\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-\\frac{9}{4}})^{\\frac{2}{2}}}}\\ &{=}&{\\displaystyle\\frac{E((\\mu-E(\\mu|s))^{3})}{\\frac{5}{2}\\bar{\\theta}-\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-X\\sigma^{2}}}+\\sigma^{2}-\\frac{(X\\sigma^{2})^{2}}{(\\frac{5}{2}\\bar{\\theta}-\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-X\\sigma^{2}})^{2}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nBut the $E((\\mu-E(\\mu|s))^{3})=E[E((\\mu-E(\\mu|s))^{3}|s)]$ by the law of iterated expectations. The latter expression is the skew of the posterior distribution. Since the posterior is normally distributed, its skew is 0. Therefore equation 5 gives the variance of $\\mu$ conditional on staying.  \n\n$$\nV a r(\\mu|s t a y)=\\sigma^{2}-\\frac{(X\\sigma^{2})^{2}}{(\\frac{5}{2}\\bar{\\theta}-\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-X\\sigma^{2}})^{2}}\n$$  \n\nI now derive the variance of $s$ conditional on staying.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l l l}{\\gamma a r(s|s t a y)}&{=}&{\\displaystyle\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}s^{2}\\frac{\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left(s t a y|\\mu,s\\right)\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left(\\mu|s\\right)\\operatorname*{Pr}(s)}{\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left(s t a y|s\\right)}d\\mu d s}\\ &&{\\displaystyle-(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}s\\frac{\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left(s t a y|\\mu,s\\right)\\operatorname*{Pr}(\\mu|s)\\operatorname*{Pr}(s)}{\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left(s t a y|s\\right)}d\\mu d s)^{2}}\\ &{=}&{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}s^{2}(\\frac{5}{2}\\bar{\\theta}-\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-X\\sigma^{2}})\\operatorname*{Pr}(s)d s}{\\frac{5}{2}\\bar{\\theta}-\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-X\\sigma^{2}}}-(\\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}s(\\frac{5}{2}\\bar{\\theta}-\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-X}d\\sigma)}{\\frac{5}{2}\\bar{\\theta}-\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-X}}}\\ &{=}&{E(s^{2})-(E(s))^{2}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe conditional variance of $s$ equals the unconditional variance of $s$ .Because both outside employers and incumbent employers see $s$ , the incumbent will  \n\nset wages so that, conditional on $s$ , the worker is indifferent between staying and leaving. Since $s=\\mu+\\epsilon$ and $\\mu\\perp\\epsilon$ , the variance is just the sum of these variances, shown in equation 6.  \n\n$$\nV a r(s|s t a y)=\\frac{1}{1-X}\\sigma^{2}\n$$  \n\nLastly, I solve for the covariance of $s$ and $\\mu$ conditional on staying.  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{l l l}{{\\mathcal{I}}o v(\\mu,s|s t a y)}&{=}&{E(\\mu*s|s t a y)-E(\\mu|s t a y)E(s|s t a y)}\\ &{=}&{{\\frac{V a r(\\mu|s)E(s)}{{\\frac{5}{2}}{\\bar{\\theta}}-{\\sqrt{{\\frac{9}{4}}{\\bar{\\theta}}^{2}-X\\sigma^{2}}}}}+E[E(\\mu|s)*s]-({\\frac{V a r(\\mu|s)E(s)}{{\\frac{5}{2}}{\\bar{\\theta}}-{\\sqrt{{\\frac{9}{4}}{\\bar{\\theta}}^{2}-X\\sigma^{2}}}}}+}\\ &{=}&{E[E(\\mu|s)*s]-E(\\mu)E(s)}\\ &{=}&{\\sigma^{2}}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nPlugging in equations 5-7 into the above formula for the variance in wage changes conditional on staying at the firm yields equation 8, the variance of wage changes of stayers.  \n\n$$\nV a r(\\Delta w^{s t a y})=\\sigma^{2}+\\frac{1}{4}(-3X\\sigma^{2}-\\frac{(X\\sigma^{2})^{2}}{(\\frac{5}{2}\\bar{\\theta}-\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-X\\sigma^{2}})^{2}})\n$$  \n\nI next derive the variance in wage changes among movers. Starting from the following expression for $\\Delta w^{m o v e}$ , I derive the variance.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{\\Delta w^{m o v e}}}&{{=}}&{{m X+s(1-X)-\\frac{3}{2}\\bar{\\theta}+\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-X\\sigma^{2}}-w_{0}}}\\ {{V a r(\\Delta w^{m o v e})}}&{{=}}&{{(1-X)^{2}V a r(s|m o v e)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nBut above I showed that the variance of $s$ conditional on staying equals the unconditional variance of $s$ . Therefore the variance of $s$ conditional on moving also equals the unconditional variance (since workers can only either stay or move). Since $\\begin{array}{r}{v a r(s)=\\frac{1}{1-X}\\sigma^{2}}\\end{array}$ , we get equation 9:  \n\n$$\nV a r(\\Delta w^{m o v e})=(1-X)\\sigma^{2}\n$$  \n\nPropositions 1 and 2 involve the derivative of $V a r(\\Delta w^{s t a y})-V a r(\\Delta w^{m o v e})$ with respect to $\\sigma^{2}$ a.nd $X$ , respectively. Therefore equation 10 subtracts equation 9 from equation 8 (where I use the abbreviated notation $V^{s t a y}$ and $V^{m o v e}$ for the variances in wage changes of stayers and movers, respectively).  \n\n$$\nV^{s t a y}-V^{m o v e}=\\frac{1}{4}(X\\sigma^{2}-\\frac{(X\\sigma^{2})^{2}}{(\\frac{5}{2}\\bar{\\theta}-\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-X\\sigma^{2}})^{2}})\n$$  \n\nProposition 1 $\\frac{\\partial(V^{s t a y}-V^{m o v e})}{\\partial\\sigma^{2}}>0$  \n\nProof. In order to prove proposition 1, we need to sign the derivative with respectto $\\sigma^{2}$ which is shown in equation 11 and for ease of notation, written at $\\partial_{\\sigma}$  \n\n$$\n\\partial_{\\sigma}={\\frac{1}{4}}X(1-{\\frac{2X\\sigma^{2}}{({\\frac{5}{2}}\\bar{\\theta}-\\sqrt{{\\frac{9}{4}}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-X\\sigma^{2}})^{2}}}+{\\frac{(X\\sigma^{2})^{2}}{\\sqrt{{\\frac{9}{4}}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-X\\sigma^{2}}({\\frac{5}{2}}\\bar{\\theta}-\\sqrt{{\\frac{9}{4}}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-X\\sigma^{2}})^{3}}})\n$$  \n\nIt can be shown that as long as $\\theta$ is large compared to $X\\sigma^{2}$ (the condition derived in section A.1.1. is more than sufficient), $\\partial_{\\sigma}$ is always positive.  \n\nProposition 2 $\\frac{\\partial(V^{s t a y}-V^{m o v e})}{\\partial r}>0$  \n\nProof. In order to prove proposition 2, we need to sign the derivative with respect to $X$ , shown in equation 12 and for ease of notation, written as $\\partial_{X}$ But if proposition 1 holds then $\\partial_{X}$ must also be greater than $0$ , since both $X$ and $\\sigma^{2}$ are positive.  \n\n$$\n\\partial_{X}=\\frac{1}{4}\\sigma^{2}(1-\\frac{2X\\sigma^{2}}{(\\frac{5}{2}\\bar{\\theta}-\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-X\\sigma^{2}})^{2}}+\\frac{(X\\sigma^{2})^{2}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-X\\sigma^{2}}(\\frac{5}{2}\\bar{\\theta}-\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-X\\sigma^{2}})^{3}})\n$$  \n\n## A.4 Estimating X  \n\nThe frst metho for empirial aproximating $X$ isto take theraio $\\frac{\\partial_{\\sigma}}{\\partial_{X}}$ the ratio of equations 11 and 12. It is easy to show that most of the terms  \n\ncancel out and we are left with equation 13.  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{\\partial_{\\sigma}}{\\partial_{X}}}={\\frac{X}{\\sigma^{2}}}\n$$  \n\nIn the empirical implementation I show that I can empirically estimate $d d_{\\sigma}$ and $d d_{X}$ and that $d d_{\\sigma}\\approx\\partial_{\\sigma}\\Delta\\sigma^{2}$ and $d d_{\\sigma}\\approx\\partial_{X}\\Delta\\sigma^{2}$ . Substituting these expressions into equation 13 and solving for $X$ yields equation 14.  \n\n$$\nX=\\frac{d d_{\\sigma}}{d d_{X}}\\frac{\\sigma^{2}\\Delta X}{\\Delta\\sigma^{2}}\n$$  \n\nI explain in section 5.3 how I then use my empirical estimates of $d d_{\\sigma}$ and $d d_{X}$ plus a plausible range of values for $\\textstyle{\\frac{\\sigma^{2}\\Delta X}{\\Delta\\sigma^{2}}}$ to obtain a range of values of $X$  \n\nThe second method for empirically approximating $X$ begins with the equation for $d d_{\\sigma}$ , combining equations 6-9 in the text. This is shown in equation 15, where recall $\\Delta\\sigma^{2}=\\sigma_{L}^{2}-\\sigma_{H}^{2}$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l c l}{{d d_{\\sigma}}}&{{=}}&{{(V a r(\\Delta w)_{s t a y}^{L}-V a r(\\Delta w)_{m o v e}^{L})-(V a r(\\Delta w)_{s t a y}^{H}-V a r(\\Delta w)_{m o v e}^{H})}}\\ {{}}&{{=}}&{{{\\frac{1}{4}}(X\\Delta\\sigma^{2}+{\\frac{(X\\sigma_{H}^{2})^{2}}{({\\frac{5}{2}}\\bar{\\theta}-{\\sqrt{{\\frac{9}{4}}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-X\\sigma_{H}^{2}}})^{2}}}-{\\frac{(X\\sigma_{L}^{2})^{2}}{({\\frac{5}{2}}\\bar{\\theta}-{\\sqrt{{\\frac{9}{4}}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-X\\sigma_{L}^{2}}})^{2}}})(15)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThis expression has 4 unknowns, $X$ ， $\\theta$ ， $\\sigma_{L}^{2}$ and $\\Delta\\sigma^{2}$ , and the goal is to empirically estimate $X$ . I now take advantage of other aspects of the model, which can be easily estimated. Specifically, I turn to the probability that a group of workers stays with the incumbent. It is easy to write down the closed-form solution for this probability as a function of $X$ ， $\\theta$ and the relevant $\\sigma^{2}$ . Furthermore, the probability of staying is easy to estimate empirically, although I note that I have not made the careful identification argument I made for $d d_{\\sigma}$ and $d d_{r}$ in section 3. These exercise should therefore be taken with a large grain of salt.  \n\nI next derive an analytical solution for the probability that a worker in the high variance ability group stays with the incumbent.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l c l}{{\\displaystyle\\mathrm{Pr}(s t a y)}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\mathrm{Pr}(s t a y|\\mu,s)d\\mu d s=\\displaystyle\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\mu-v^{*}(s)+\\bar{\\theta}}{4\\bar{\\theta}}d\\mu d s}}\\ {{}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\mu-m X-s(1-X)+\\frac{5}{2}\\bar{\\theta}-\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-X\\sigma_{H}^{2}}}{4\\bar{\\theta}}d\\mu d s}}\\ {{}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{4\\bar{\\theta}}(\\frac{5}{2}\\bar{\\theta}-\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-X\\sigma_{H}^{2}})}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nSimilarly, we can derive the probability that someone in the low variance ability group stays. Furthermore, let $\\gamma_{H}$ and $\\gamma_{L}$ be the empirical probabilities that a worker stays with the incumbent firm for the high- and low-variance ability groups, respectively. We therefore have equations 16 and 17.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{\\gamma_{H}}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{4\\bar{\\theta}}(\\frac{5}{2}\\bar{\\theta}-\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-X\\sigma_{H}^{2}})}}\\ {{\\gamma_{L}}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{4\\bar{\\theta}}(\\frac{5}{2}\\bar{\\theta}-\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}\\bar{\\theta}^{2}-X\\sigma_{L}^{2}})}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFirst, these equations help in simplifying the expression for $d d_{\\sigma}$ (equation 15). We can plug in $4\\theta\\gamma_{H}$ for $(\\textstyle{\\frac{5}{2}}{\\bar{\\theta}}-\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}{\\bar{\\theta}}^{2}-X\\sigma_{H}^{2}})$ and $4\\theta\\gamma_{L}$ for $\\left({\\frac{5}{2}}{\\bar{\\theta}}-\\right.$ $\\sqrt{\\textstyle{\\frac{9}{4}}{\\bar{\\theta}}^{2}-X\\sigma_{L}^{2}})$ . In addition, I can use either of these two equations to solve for $\\bar{\\theta}^{2}$ and plug that back into equation 15. For example, using equation 17, $\\bar{\\theta}^{2}=$ $\\scriptstyle\\frac{-X\\sigma_{L}^{2}}{16\\gamma_{L}^{2}+4-20\\gamma_{L}}$ . Then, I can use the two equations to solve for $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{\\sigma_{H}^{2}}{\\sigma_{L}^{2}}=\\frac{16\\gamma_{H}^{2}+4-20\\gamma_{H}}{16\\gamma_{L}^{2}+4-20\\gamma_{L}}}\\end{array}$ For ease of notation, let us denote this ratio with $p$ . What $\\mathrm{I}$ am doing here is using the differences in mobility probabilities to infer something about the underlying variances in ability, assuming that $\\theta$ and $X$ are held constant across the two groups. Finally, if $\\Delta\\sigma^{2}=\\sigma_{L}^{2}-\\sigma_{H}^{2}$ and $\\begin{array}{r}{p=\\frac{\\sigma_{H}^{2}}{\\sigma_{L}^{2}}}\\end{array}$ , we must have $\\begin{array}{r}{\\sigma_{L}^{2}=\\frac{\\Delta\\sigma^{2}}{1-p}}\\end{array}$  \n\nMaking these substitutions we get expression 18 where $X$ is a function of empirical knowns and $\\Delta\\sigma^{2}$ . Estimating $\\Delta\\sigma^{2}$ requires an additional empirical assumption, which I explain in the text.2 I also discuss how a specifically empirically estimate $d d_{\\sigma}$ ， $\\gamma_{L}$ ， $\\gamma_{H}$ , and $\\Delta\\sigma^{2}$ , which are all I need to find the  \n\nsolution to $X$  \n\n$$\n4d d_{\\sigma}=X\\Delta\\sigma^{2}(1-\\frac{1}{16(1-p)}(\\frac{p^{2}}{\\gamma_{H}^{2}}-\\frac{1}{\\gamma_{L}^{2}})(16\\gamma_{L}^{2}+4-20\\gamma_{L}))\n$$  \n\n![](images/6b1d2ffba1bd8cb5ce8f0b91e48eae35cabc80bb07f86e8022f2f2adcdc0c8e4.jpg)  \nFigure 2: AFQT Distribution and Mean, by Job Entry Cohort  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"></td></tr><tr><td>Highest Grade</td><td>AFQT</td><td>FirstWage Residual?</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">A: Means (relative to lowest quartile)</td></tr><tr><td>75-100%ileUERate -0.397** [0.0995]</td><td>-0.0573+ [0.0317]</td><td>-0.0346+ [0.0180]</td></tr><tr><td>50-75%ileUERate -0.169 [0.106] 25-50%ileUERate -0.345*</td><td>-0.0562+ [0.0291]</td><td>-0.00602 [0.0140]</td></tr><tr><td>[0.160]</td><td>-0.0905* [0.0340]</td><td>0.0242 [0.0177]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">B: Squared Residuals?

    "reference_markdown": "# Accounting for Market Frictions and Power Asymmetries in Online Labor Markets  \n\nSara Constance Kingsley,\\* Mary L. Gray and Siddharth Suri  \n\nAmazon Mechanical Turk (AMT） is an online labor market that defines itself as \"a marketplace for work that requires human intelligence.\" Early adoocates and developers of crowdsourcing platforms argued that crowdsourcing tasks are designed so people of any skill level can do this labor online. However, as the popularity of crowdsourcing work has grown, the crowdsourcing literature has identified a peculiar issue: that work quality of workers is not responsive to changes in price. This means that unlike what economic theory would predict, paying crowdworkers higher wages does not lead to higher quality work. This has led some to believe that platforms, like AMT, attract poor quality workers. This article examines different market dynamics that might, unwittingly, contribute to the inefficiencies in the market that generate poor work quality. We argue that the cultural logics and socioeconomic values embedded in AMT's platform design generate a greater amount of market power for requesters (those posting tasks) than for individuals doing tasks for pay (crowdworkers). We attribute the uneven distribution of market power among participants to labor market frictions, primarily characterized by uncompetitive wage posting and incomplete information. Finally, recommendations are made for how to tackle these frictions when contemplating the design of an online labor market.  \n\nKEY WORDs: market friction, crowdsourcing, quality, Amazon Mechanical Turk, imperfect competition, online labor markets  \n\n## Introduction  \n\nCrowdsourcing is task-orientated labor distributed online through an open call on the Internet (Brabham, 2013; Howe, 2006). Firms look to distribute tasks to crowdsourcing platforms to reduce labor and capital costs, increase the scale of production, and to reach large subject pools quickly. Firms and individuals may tap into \"the crowd\" to conduct usability testing, research surveys, medical studies (Ranard et al., 2014), and even investigate black market prices for street drugs (Dasgupta et al., 2013). Large firms like AOL, Google, Unilever,3 and Netflix\\* all depend on the product of crowdsourcing labor done by hundreds of thousands of people across the globe to curate content, improve search results, survey potential consumers, and optimize the services they offer people who consume their services and products.  \n\nAmazon.com's Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), launched in 2005, is one of the earliest iterations of a publicly accessible crowdwork platform, making it an ideal focus for a case study of crowdsourcing market dynamics. Studies evaluating crowdsourcing labor on the AMT platform often recount a particular narrative about AMT's production levels and work quality. This narrative suggests that wages offered in this crowdsourcing market attract the worst quality of workers (Dow, Kulkarni, Klemmer, & Hartmann, 2012; Ipeirotis, 2010). Worker characteristics related to skill, educational attainment, motivation, and socioeconomic status are then said to explain the dearth of work quality or accuracy rather than the structural features or the design of the AMT labor market (for crowdsourcing literature see, Rogstadius et al., 2011; Shaw, Horton, & Chen, 2011; for economics literature see, Reich, Gordon, & Edwards, 1973).  \n\nAlternatively, this article argues that the structure of the platform produces market inefficiencies which channel the vast majority of market power to employers,6 which is, in turn, at least partially responsible for the poor quality Work observed. Our key contribution is to demonstrate the features of the AMT platform that produce market inefficiencies and impact work quality. First, we show there is an information asymmetry between workers and requesters, which creates an uneven power dynamic between workers and requesters. Second, we evidence how the AMT platform is a highly concentrated labor market: a few requesters post the overwhelming majority of tasks. This limits the ability of workers to compete for tasks that best match their skills. Finally, we show that the platform AP17 dictates that requesters (\"employers\") post wages, exacerbating market pressures that limit workers' ability to negotiate wages offered to them.  \n\nA key implication of these aspects of the AMT market is that employers wield far more market power than workers. As a result, worker characteristics do not adequately explain production quality on AMT. Instead market asymmetries mediated and reinforced through the API design work to degrade the quality of market outcomes, including employee-employer matches. For example, we argue the API design structures participant interactions in such a way that workers disproportionately absorb the cost of searching for tasks (e.g., labor recruitment costs).8  \n\n## AMT as an Online Labor Market  \n\nOur analysis focuses on the AMT labor market, because AMT is \"the crowdsourcing site with one of the largest subject pools\" (Mason & Suri, 2012, p. 1). Employers, called requesters, post tasks to the AMT marketplace for individuals to do for pay. Individuals, who call themselves or are often referred to as \"Turkers\" do task-based labor in exchange for a Wage set by requesters. Tasks posted to AMT are called Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs). A HIT Group consists of similar micro-tasks or HITs posted by the same requester (Kittur, Smus, Khamkar, & Kraut, 2011).  \n\nThe general workflow on AMT is as follows: A requester posts a group of tasks (HITs) for a set wage. Workers search for and do the tasks available to them. Requesters then review the work submitted by individual workers, accept the good work, and unilaterally reject any poor quality work. AMT delivers the requester's posted payment only for the work that the requester deems acceptable and approves through the API. The overall fraction of tasks that a worker has had approved over his or her lifetime is that worker's approval rating. A worker's approval rating serves as a type of reputation score that determines the jobs they will be able to access in the AMT marketplace. Two different types of accounts are available to workers on the AMT platform: a general account offered to all workers, and a Master's account that is, in principle, only offered to workers who maintain a reputation for high job performance. Amazon sets the parameters for establishing all accounts and standards for performance and reputation. Amazon has not disclosed how it defines \"high job performance reputation\" and does not make its parameters for Masters accounts and standards or criteria for general accounts public or transparent to requesters or workers. Since some tasks are only available to Masters accounts, in practice, AMT determines who may enter this marketplace and who is qualified to access different work opportunities on the platform.  \n\nWe generally think of online labor markets as places where, \"(1) labor is exchanged for money, (2) the product of that labor is delivered\" online, \"and (3) the allocation of labor and money is determined by a collection of buyers and sellers operating within a price system\" (Horton, 2010, p. 516). Commercial crowdsourcing platforms like AMT \"serve as the meeting place and market\" where micro-task labor is exchanged online for pay (Mason & Suri, 2012, p. 2). This is a critical distinction because legally speaking crowdsourcing sites like AMT have no employment relationship with the people who supply labor on the platform. For this reason AMT differs from employers who typically hire (\"buy\") labor in offline labor markets. Amazon's primary role is to determine the boundaries of the online labor market. In practice this role does substantially affect labor market outcomes. Amazon's user agreement determines who and how people may participate. Only participants based in the United States may post work and only those registered as workers living in the United States and India may be paid in cash. Workers living in other countries are paid in Amazon. com credit. Thus, while Amazon is not legally an employer, the way Amazon designed the AMT platform does shape the market dynamics of this online labor market.  \n\n## Research Methodology and Data Sources  \n\nWe draw on several data sets from a longitudinal study of crowdwork to support our claims about crowdsourcing quality and labor market supply on AMT.? Data sets include: (1) responses to a survey posted to the AMT platform between July 2013 and 2014; (2) ethnographic data collected from 48 interviews and participant observations conducted in person from September 2013 to July 2014; and (3) results from a geographic mapping task (also called a HIT) posted toAMT.10  \n\nFor this article, we examined a total of 317 survey responses from AMT Workers (collected for the longitudinal study cited above), including 180 completed surveys from people living in the United States and 137 from people living in India. Since merely posting the survey on AMT may oversample workers who typically do surveys as tasks for work, the larger study embedded the survey into separate image-labeling tasks and email classification tasks. After a worker did 10 email classifications a link appeared asking if they would like to do our survey for additional pay. Since the survey was a vehicle to recruit interview participants this methodological innovation allowed us to reach workers who might not typically do surveys on AMT.  \n\nComplementing survey data and ethnographic interviews are measurements of the worker population gathered from tasks posted to AMT. Specifically, this article draws on data from a simple geographic mapping task. The mapping task paid participants to self-report their geo-location and then asked how they found out about the task. A map of the world (via the Bing maps API) was first displayed to workers who were then asked to place a pin where they were located. Our mapping task was posted to AMT for 5 weeks and collected 4,856 pins. Since Amazon does not publish statistics about the people who use and work on its platform, measurements like the mapping task allowed us to approximate the geographic distribution of workers on AMT.  \n\n## Evidence of Market Power Imbalances  \n\nFirst, we discuss labor market frictions in regard to: (1) whether labor market information is equally available to all participants (e.g., perfect); and (2) the high degree of market concentration evidenced by the fact that a small minority of requesters post the majority of tasks to the platform (Ipeirotis, 2010). Then we turn to an assessment of AMT wage structures broken down by: (1) how wages are determined (ex ante vs ex post wage posting); (2) whether Wage bargaining or negotiation occurs; and (3) if requesters pay the same wage to all workers who have equivalent job performance. All of these factors, mediated by the API, shape the labor market supply dynamics of this online labor market.  \n\n### LaborMarketFrictions  \n\nIn labor economics, market frictions refer to different \"transaction costs\" that people and firms incur when participating in a given market (Coase, 1937; Williamson, 1979). For the AMT market we focus on the cost of labor market information. We will show that workers bear the brunt of the cost of the information in this market, which exacerbates the imbalance in market power.  \n\nImperfect Information. When labor market information is costly rather than costless, labor economists call information \"imperfect.\" Imperfect information is a known source of market frictions (Autor, 2001). Imperfect information violates assumptions given by economic theories that depend on all parties having equal access to the information that people require to make decisions  (Stigler & Sherwin, 1985). As we will describe below, AMT's API distributes task and reputation information unevenly among participants to favor requesters at the expense of crowdworkers.  \n\nAmazon's reputation system is one-sided in that it only signals to requesters how well crowdworkers have performed in the past, assigning each worker an approval rating based on previous requesters' reported acceptance of workers' tasks. AMT does not indicate to crowdworkers how well requesters have behaved as employers. Pertinent information not made available to workers on AMT include requesters' past rejection rates, responsiveness to worker attempts to communicate, and payment history. This means crowdworkers lack mechanisms on the AMT platform to hold requesters accountable for the work they post, in the same way that requesters are able to hold crowdworkers accountable for the worktheydo.  \n\nSo while requesters can penalize crowdworkers they deem to be bad actors by blocking workers from doing tasks, withholding payments, rejecting work without reason (though sometimes keeping the output submitted by workers), or reporting Workers to Amazon.com (which can lead to suspension of worker accounts), crowdworkers have no mechanism to remedy concerns about requesters. For crowdworkers this makes the cost of finding good tasks to do on AMT higher than if sufficient information about requesters was made available (for relevant treatment of information costs in the economics literature, see Stigler, 1982).  \n\nIn response to this information asymmetry researchers Irani and Silberman (2013) developed a browser extension (Turkopticon)l that allows crowdworkers to rate requesters and view ratings submitted by fellow workers. Turkopticon works by collecting and publicly releasing the labor market data workers share through their use of the plug-in that Amazon.com otherwise withholds from market participants. Our surveys and ethnographic data indicate that workers have widely adopted this tool. Several participants noted during interviews that Turkopticon was one of the first tools they read about in online worker forums and the one that they adopted early on to more efficiently identify the \"good jobs.\"  \n\nWorkers, particularly newer platform participants with less experience or connections to other workers, are left most vulnerable to incurring added costs exacted by the lack of equally available information. While tools like Turkopticon have helped mitigate some information asymmetries generated by the AMT platform's \"algorithmic authority\" (see Gillespie, 2014; Lustig & Nardi, 2015), Turkopticon does not solve the asymmetry of market power. Requesters can still unilaterally reject work and block workers. Turkopticon also does not provide any method for workers to have their reputation repaired or to regain lost wages (Irani & Silberman, 2014).  \n\nOnline forums frequented by crowdworkers have noticeably proliferated in recent years (Martin, Hanrahan, O'Neill, & Gupta, 2014). Crowdworkers realize the cost of market information asymmetries or frictions when they use online forums to share information about the quality of tasks available on AMT, and sWap recommendations about requesters. As in the case with Turkopticon, online forums have helped mitigate the information asymmetry between workers and requesters generated by the AMT API but these forums do not solve the market power asymmetry. Indeed, the online forum traffic specifically illustrates the recruitment costs that requesters shift to workers searching for tasks to do on AMT. Since AMT does not post labor market information directly on the platform, crowdworkers spend substantial amounts of time searching for information on the Internet (Yuen, King, & Leung, 2012).1² Most economists will agree that time spent searching for work is a cost or rent job seekers bear in order to secure future employment. Normally wages and salaries are considered the return workers receive for investments made when searching for jobs (Diamond, 2011; Mortensen, 2011; Pissarides, 2011).  \n\nWe wanted to assess the value of online forums as a resource that could offset a lack of perfect information about AMT for this reason. We posted an experimental mapping task to AMT to evaluate what fraction of workers came to our task via online forums and what fraction came to our task via other methods, such as by searching the AMT website using AMT's built-in search functionality.  \n\nFigure 1 displays the traffic flows to our experimental mapping task by the information source workers used to discover it. The $x\\cdot$ -axis denotes time starting at April 23, 2014, which is when the mapping HIT was launched, and indicates each 8hour-period until May 28, 2014, which is when the mapping HIT was taken down. Thus the HIT ran for 5 weeks in total. The y-axis shows how many workers did our task during a given day. So the height of each bar indicates the total number of workers who did our HIT in a given 8-hour period. The coloring of the bar indicates how the workers who did the HIT learned about the HIT. The length of the black portion of each bar represents the number of workers who were directed to the task from online forums and the length of the blue portion indicates the number of workers who found the task by using the search bar tool on the AMT platform. These were the two predominant channels by which workers found our HIT. Figure 1 shows that many of the bars, especially the higher ones, have large black portions. This indicates that a large fraction of traffic, in fact almost half, came to our experimental mapping task from online forums. If sufficient information about AMT was available to market participants we would expect the overwhelming majority of workers to have arrived via searching the AMT site. That tens of thousands of registered AMT users generate traffic on multiple forums dedicated to finding good tasks highlights the scale of the inefficiency that an information-starved market creates. As such, we argue that online crowdsourcing forums signal the transfer of labor recruitment costs to crowdworkers.  \n\n![](images/41e0310a20f27bac06d0e612536550c2a988a75dbddb889c816ae72fc016b0f7.jpg)  \nFigure 1. Online Forum Use by Crowdworkers to Find HITs on AMT. Note: Just under half of the workers came to this HIT via an online forum. Based on 4,856 responses from April 23, 2014 to May 28, 2014. Graph credits: Gregory Minton.  \n\nEconomic theory posits that searching for a job is a rent that workers pay now in order to find income earning opportunities in the future (Manning, 2003). However, the nature of crowdsourcing labor is iterative, meaning workers must constantly search for new tasks to do because no long-term employment contract exists between workers and requesters. Arguably this means workers continue to pay search or labor market entry costs without receiving a full return from the wages they earn. Data about forum traffic are indicators of market entry costs incurred by crowdworkers for this reason. Ultimately for crowdsourcing labor markets it is critical to understand that workers' search efforts are far from free. Search time is a cost or rent borne by those who are actively looking to find decent work online, and these workers' costs should be factored into the valuation of this market.  \n\nSearch activity within  labor markets marred by  imperfect  information produce another telling outcome: poor employer-employee matches (Benson, 2013; Priest, 2008). Matches in labor markets with patchy information about past performances or human capital are typically bad because parties exchanging pay for labor do not have the information needed to make optimal choices about who to hire and what jobs to accept. Put another way, prices are not set at a level where \"the quantity that the buyers want to purchase is exactly that which sellers are willing to provide\" (Mortensen, 2011, p. 1074). This might explain why AMT's reported work quality is not responsive to changes in price (Mason & Watts,2010).  \n\nWhile it may be fair to suggest that forums register as an aberration in a wellfunctioning market, we do recognize that forums also serve a range of other important functions, which go beyond providing market information. They also offer social cohesion, mentorship, help workers build a sense of identity, and offer them entertaining breaks from work routines (Martin et al., 2014). Forums represent the trade-offs between efficiency and social interaction found in a marketplace (Lehdonvirta & Castronova, 2014, p. 130, figure 7.2) and crowdsourcing platforms are no exception. However, not all workers interviewed were aware of this resource. And without a mechanism on the platform itself to right the imbalance of market power produced by AMT's reputation system, the costs associated with AMT market participation remains a significant impediment for manyworkers.  \n\nMarket Concentration on AMT. Ipeirotis (2010, p. 17) found that the \"top requesters\" generate \"more than 30 percent of the overall activity in the market\" yet comprise a sparse $^{\\prime\\prime}0.1$ percent of [.. .] total requesters\" on AMT. This trend is consistent with monopsonistic or oligopsonistic features of labor markets with imperfect competition (Manning, 2003; Ransom & Sims, 2008). We evaluated market power among AMT requesters in our sample by looking to see if the number of income-earning opportunities or tasks posted to the platform are limited to a small number of requesters. We evaluated a data set produced by scraping information about HIT Groups posted to AMT on August 8, 2014.13 Market level information for AMT in this data set includes the wages requesters set for tasks, how many tasks each HIT Group contained, and a description of each task that requesters were asking workers to do. From this data set we calculated the distribution of tasks posted by the top 10 percent of requesters. We defined the top 10 percent of requesters by the frequency at which requesters posted tasks to the market. We then estimated the distribution of tasks by HIT Group size. For our sample, HIT Group size ranged from those HIT Groups with only one task to a maximum size of 39,588 tasks posted to a single HIT Group by an individual requester.  \n\nFindings from our data analysis of requester and task distribution on AMT are illustrated by Figures 2 and 3. Figure 2 shows that 10 percent of all requesters post approximately 98-99 percent of all tasks to the AMT platform. Figure 3 shows that approximately 98-99 percent of all tasks on AMT are posted to only 10 percent of HIT Groups. A HIT Group is a collection of similar tasks posted by the same requester each for the same pay.  \n\nAlthough the total number of requesters posting tasks to AMT seems large, our data demonstrates that the fraction of requesters posting tasks most frequently to the platform is highly concentrated to a small percent of all requesters, supporting claims found in the existent crowdsourcing literature. Ipeirotis (2010, p. 17), for example, notes that this \"high concentration is not unusual for any online community\" and that \"there is always a long tail of participants\" who have \"significantly lower activity than the top contributors.\" While it may be unsurprising to see such a concentration in this market, since this happens in an online labor market this concentration has an important effect. We argue that this concentration of requesters could hold a significant degree of market power. Requester concentration implies that workers have fewer wage earning opportunities outside this top percent of requesters. In economic terms, this means that a small fraction of the total number of requesters likely capture the majority of labor supply on AMT.  \n\n![](images/853fd44cf9a4a2840b7aa82a739c31f79add544270f27e71168cd2ad9674689c.jpg)  \nFigure 2. Market Concentration by Requesters.  \n\n![](images/01fe489ccb2767488405b67202323742618670bc5aa383b500c1211f8c4958a8.jpg)  \nFigure 3. Market Concentration by HIT Groups.  \n\nAMT Wage Structures  \n\nOne of the strongest indications of prevailing imbalances in market power comes from analysis of AMT's site design itself (Ipeirotis, 2010; Khanna, Ratan, Davis, & Thies, 2010; Silberman, Ross, Irani, & Tomlinson, 2010). As Figure 4 shows, AMT's design requires requesters to post tasks to the AMT market and list the wage for each task (HIT) that they wish to offer crowdworkers on the platform before any work is done. Requesters log onto the platform and post tasks within a group of similar tasks (a so-called HIT Group), predetermining and unilaterally setting wage rates through the API. In other words, Figure 4 clearly shows that requesters set wages ex ante. This means wages for tasks are determined before requesters interact with the crowdworkers who end up taking on the requesters' posted tasks. In labor economics wage determinations set by firms who do not negotiate with workers beforehand are called ex ante wage postings (Manning, 2003).  \n\n![](images/cc9fb871b054e0f216e85150befbc569089514043c6b68fca2308f9766167665.jpg)  \nFigure 4. Screenshot of the Amazon Mechanical Turk Marketplace.  \n\nThat requesters set wage rates ex ante and do so uniformly for each individual task they post suggests that crowdworkers have little to no ability to negotiate their wages with requesters on AMT. Economic theory about imperfect competition assumes market distortions (\"frictions\"), which limit the ability of workers to negotiate wages, produce market power that favors employers since employers rather than the market set wage rates (Ashenfelter, Farber, & Ransom, 2010a, 2010b; Manning, 2003; Staiger, Spetz, & Phibbs, 2008). Since we cannot provide evidence that employers are systematically posting wages below the expected marginal product of a worker, we cannot conclusively state that ex ante wage posting causes employers to have market power. However, we do believe market concentration, discussed previously, suggests that ex ante posting gives requesters a greater degree of market power than they might have had otherwise.  \n\nEx ante wage posting has additional market implications. First, since wages are predetermined and posted by requesters, crowdworkers have few alternatives to accepting the wages requesters offer, aside from searching for other tasks to do on AMT and incurring added search costs or walking away from the AMT platform altogether (for a related discussion in the economics literature, see Dixon, 1987). Once a worker has spent time learning how to search and do specific tasks on the AMT platform, they are hard-pressed to find alternatives, which will allow them to capture surplus profits or extract rent from their experience. This limits the ability of workers to transfer their skills to another workplace.  \n\nSecond, ex ante wage posting also means workers with higher productivity rates cannot be proportionately compensated for their work when the wage rate is set ahead of time. That requesters do not pay crowdworkers according to their job performance for each individual task they do or the investments they make in obtaining higher skills and education evidences the noncompetitive nature of wage structures on AMT.  \n\n## Implications of Market Power Imbalance  \n\nWe have established that requesters have far more market power due to the presence of asymmetric reputation systems, the concentration of tasks supplied by small number of firms or individuals providing work, and the ability to set Wages and unilaterally reject work. Next we describe some implications of these phenomena. Since there is no version of AMT or a competitor available for comparison that is free from these market power imbalances, we turn to economic theory to illustrate the effects of the market power imbalances. Because there is no reputation mechanism for requesters that is a default on the AMT system, workers are forced to either pay the cost of exploring different requesters by installing third party browser plug-ins like Turkopticon and browsing online forums or take on the risk of working for requesters of unknown reputation. In either case, workers bear the costs of the information asymmetry.  \n\nSince requesters have to uniformly set wages across the worker population, they cannot preferentially set higher wages for the good workers and lower Wages for the bad workers. This makes it more difficult for good workers to find the good requesters and requesters to pay according to the quality that they might expect from a worker, which contributes to poor worker-requester matches. The concentration of work among a small fraction of all requesters means less diversity of tasks are available to workers. This makes it harder for a new worker to find a task suited to them. Again, this contributes to poor workerrequester matches. Finally, we give some evidence that requesters are already experiencing poor matches with workers. Mason and Suri (2012) advocate recruiting a panel of trusted workers to participate in research studies, which has been used to great effect in follow up work (Mason & Watts, 2012; Suri & Watts, 2011; Wang, Suri, & Watts, 2012). Furthermore, Crowdflower and SpeechInk (now called SpeechPad), companies that once posted tasks on AMT on behalf of other companies, implemented their own reputation systems for its workers. One can surmise that Crowdflower and SpeechInk did this because they found the AMT reputation system insufficient for finding the optimal workers for sets of tasks. In summary, we see that the asymmetrical distribution of market power between workers and requesters created by the AMT API has a real and felt impact on the quality of worker-requester matches. For this reason, we next consider how to remedy asymmetrical market power in online, commercial crowdsourcing markets like AMT.  \n\n## Conclusion: Remedies for Online Market Power  \n\nThis article primarily seeks to understand the balance of market power in the AMT crowdsourcing labor platform through a detailed, multimodal analysis of the labor market supply dynamics on AMT. We scrutinize AMT as a longstanding player and point of reference for others designing crowdsourcing platforms to understand what features might produce a consequential degree of unchecked (and unrecognized) market power. A few different technical remedies for these market power imbalances are possible for crowdsourcing labor markets. The solutions presented are given according to the most probable causes of unchecked market power in the AMT market; that is, noncompetitive wage structures, and labor market frictions, specifically imperfect information.  \n\n### Solutions for Noncompetitive Wage Structures  \n\nFirst, wage structures on AMT could be made more competitive by instituting mechanisms that allow for wage bargaining—negotiations—between requesters and crowdworkers. One solution might be to allow a double auction between workers and requesters, which would encode the bargaining over wages and jobs into a wellstudied mechanism.14 A second and preliminary example of how this could work is illustrated by Dynamo, a platform built by researchers to support crowdworkers' efforts to share information, collaborate, and determine guidelines for academic requesters setting wages and task design.15 The guidelines speak specifically to the issue of fair payment for crowdwork on Dynamo. Workers are given a central role (voice) on Dynamo in deciding what constitutes fair pay.  \n\nThat said, the Dynamo platform does not enable face-to-face or real-time Wage negotiation. In online labor markets where speed is an essential factor, information and communication delays are costly, and real-time negotiation mechanisms become critical to correcting skewed market power between those paying for labor and the people supplying it. Crowdsourcing platforms could incorporate online chat services directly into the platform, permitting requesters to talk directly to crowdworkers in real-time. Scalability, however, may limit the feasibility of this solution. Requesters typically need large subject pools to complete their tasks, and for this reason, it is hard to imagine requesters chatting with each individual crowdworker they need to hire. Alternative tools can communicate information quickly to all parties working in a virtual system. Answers to a prompt about what constitutes fair pay for a particular task could rapidly circulate opinions among participants. Some researchers have started to explore the role that systems-level visualizations can play in this regard.16 Either way, innovations like Dynamo offer examples of what it could look like to explore and create spaces for requesters and crowdworkers to work together to determine wage rates, reduce market frictions and correct imbalances of power between AMT participants.17  \n\n### Solutions for Imperfect Labor Market Information  \n\nOn the surface it might seem as though Amazon's internal platform reputation system offers an effective quality control mechanism, accurately signaling to requesters what they can expect from a worker's job performance.  \n\nHowever, AMT's reputation system creates more information asymmetries than clarity. As argued above, this is strongly evidenced by the widespread awareness and adoption of external remedies like Turkopticon, the plug-in that seeks to provide crowdworkers with information about the quality of requesters and tasks being posted to the market. However, even Turkopticon is not a sufficient fix for the information asymmetries on AMT, as data from online forums for workers who crowdsource make abundantly clear. As mentioned, crowdworkers on forums frequently discuss the unscrupulous behavior of many requesters. This is also why remedies like Dynamo have sought to, first and foremost, provide basic guidelines to particular categories of requesters.18 As helpful as these additional tools are, we argue that the dynamics of a healthy market demand that information be made readily available to participants through information tools directly embedded in the infrastructure of the marketplace to ensure equal access for all participants.  \n\nVital pieces of information, from requester reputations to a real-time list of jobs and workers in the system, remain scattered across the Internet. Crowdwork labor market participants must therefore absorb the costly scavenger hunt to make informed decisions about their participation on AMT. Crowdsourcing labor markets are doomed to reproduce labor market inequalities and generate market frictions if they fail to supply all market participants with the same information needed to fairly compete. To correct this problem, communication and reputation systems on platforms like AMT need to be made more transparent and inclusive of key constituents if they are to incorporate the \"voice\" of workers (see Freeman, 1980). This could take the form of crowdworkers being able to rate requesters directly on the AMT platform without needing to install additional software, while also allowing crowdworkers to determine the metrics or standards by which these ratings are constructed. Then, hopefully, crowdworkers would have equal opportunity to hold requesters accountable for their on-platform behavior, and the quality of tasks they design, as requesters are already able to hold crowdworkers to account for the work that they do.  \n\nOther solutions could include real-time communication tools made directly available to both requesters and crowdworkers on the AMT platform. This would reduce the amount of time crowdworkers spend in online forums, searching for good tasks to do on the AMT platform. Some platforms already try to implement in-platform communication tools. The Lead Genius (formerly MobileWorks) platform, for example, provides a chat service to crowdworkers so that they may communicate with each other in real-time when doing projects together. Legal implications, however, might currently prevent AMT from adopting similar measures. For this reason, in the next section we discuss policy and legal concerns relevant to online, crowdsourcing labor markets.  \n\n### Policy Consideration for the AMT Labor Market  \n\nTechnical remedies for imbalance in market power are severely limited by policy and legal frameworks. As much as Amazon's technological systems shape the kind of information exchanged directly on the platform, legal systems shape the parameters and rules for permissible activities and actors in labor markets. For this reason, the interplay between technological choices, and how our legal institutions either broaden or limit those options, should not be ignored. For instance, if platform providers like AMT are defined as employers, legally speaking, many platform providers would likely opt out of the market, and no longer provide the environment necessary for the online exchange of labor to occur. Conversely, if the people who post tasks to online, crowdsourcing labor markets are defined as employers, they will face prohibitive costs associated with the legal obligations of being an employer. This outcome would not only harm people posting tasks, but the hundreds of thousands of people who rely on the income they earn from the work they do online. How, then, might we imagine a future that expands the opportunity to earn money through flexible, short-term contracts while still offering fair payment for quality work?  \n\nToday, platform providers are incentivized to minimize the risk of being deemed to be an employer under the law. Most platform providers will not integrate technical fixes to their systems that support workers through training, collaboration, and information sharing, as such enhancements may suggest that the platform curates a workforce. As the class action lawsuitl9 brought against the editorial crowdsourcing site, Crowdflower, suggests, we have yet to legally decide what kind of employment crowdwork, technically, is (see NewScientist, 2013). Additionally, most platforms do not directly set wage rates, and instead leave wage setting to people posting tasks. Horton (2010, p. 517) suggests, however, and We agree that, \"the influence of the market creator is so pervasive that their role in the market is closer to that of a government...they determine the space of permissible actions within the market, such as what contractual forms are allowed and who is allocated decision rights.\" The AMT platform is the location where online labor takes place. And today, at least in the United States, it is hard to think of many workplace environments that are not at least minimally regulated to ensure the well-being and safety of both employers and their employees.  \n\nMany platforms strive to thoroughly integrate computational infrastructure and \"humans-as-a-service,\" potentially eliminating the interactivity that we traditionally associate with labor markets. We would argue that the cultural logics that currently orient most of society's members to employment are permeated with expectations of professional and personal relationships that we all associate with work environments. These expectations require us to rethink what constitutes meaningful employment rather than assume that interactivity is no longer necessary. Delegating the management of workflows through an API does not eliminate workers' needs for these relationships. Indeed, the expansive use of forums amplifies the value of these relationships as workers and requesters seek other means to communicate and collaborate with each other. In consideration of these points, we argue that the effort that platform providers make to avoid costly legal responsibilities contributes to the market power imbalances we observe. Therefore, the following policy fixes are recommended. First, treat crowdsourcing labor markets according to their needs, and not those of traditional, offline markets. Doing so requires policymakers to enact new rules, which will define employment relationships in crowdsourcing labor markets, and protect crowdworkers who exchange their labor for pay online. Second, institute enforcement mechanisms to hold bad actors on platforms like AMT accountable for their actions, especially those requesters who commit cybercrimes, and violate best practices, such as researchers not abiding by ethical standards of universities and Institutional Review Boards. Finally, consider mechanisms to make the role of platform providers similar to those of a fiduciary, in that they should act in the best interest of all parties on the platform, and not the select interests of a few.  \n\nNumerous crowdsourcing studies, particularly those focused on AMT, offer preliminary evidence that online labor markets feature power imbalances between workers and requesters. We argue that power imbalances are a result of platform design, specifically how the AMT API influences: (1) employer-based Wage setting; (2) the number of requesters posting tasks on the platform (market concentration); and (3) reputation, and other costly market frictions caused by asymmetric information problems. We emphasize that as new online markets emerge, the discipline of economics will need to consider the implications of online labor market design for the standard models employed by economics. In doing so, economics, as a whole, will require a new framework to understand the contexts in which people exchange labor online for pay.  \n\nSara Constance Kingsley, B.A., University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts [saraki@microsoft.com].   \nMary L.

Lang TheKenan-Flagler Business School The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3490, and Visiting Professor, University of Queensland Brisbane,Australia  \n\nKarl V. Lins David EcclesSchool of Business University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112-9303  \n\nDarius Miller Kelley School ofBusiness Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 47405  \n\nFirst Draft: December 2001 This Draft: April 2002  \n\n## Abstract  \n\nThis paper investigates the relation between cross listing in the U.S., with its resulting commitment to increased disclosure, and the information environment of non-U.S. firms. We find that firms that cross-list on U.S. exchanges have greater analyst coverage and increased forecast accuracy relative to firms that are not cross listed. A time-series analysis shows that the change in analyst coverage and forecast accuracy occurs around cross listing. We also document that firms that have more analyst coverage and higher forecast accuracy have higher valuations. Further, the change in firm value around cross listing is correlated with changes in analyst following and forecast accuracy suggesting that cross listing enhances firm value through its effect on the firm's information environment. Our findings support the hypothesis that crosslisted firms have better information environments, which are associated with higher market valuations.  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nIn this paper, we examine cross listing in the U.S. and its relation to the information environment of non-U.S. firms. A large literature on international cross listing suggests that information considerations are a key factor in cross-listing decisions. However, there is little direct empirical evidence on the relation between cross listing and the information environment of the firm. We document several empirical findings on this subject. First, we show crosssectionally that non-U.S. firms that are listed on U.S. exchanges have greater analyst coverage and increased forecast accuracy relative to other non-U.S. firms. Second, we perform time series analyses and find that a change in analyst coverage and forecast accuracy occurs around crosslisting. Third, we document that analyst coverage and forecast accuracy are both positively related to firm value. Finally, we show that the change in value around cross listing is correlated with changes in analyst following and forecast accuracy, suggesting that cross listing increases firm value through its effect on the firm's information environment. Our results are robust to adjustments for the potential endogeneity of the listing decision and simultaneity between analyst following and forecast accuracy. Overall, our findings support the hypothesis that there are important informational effects that occur with cross listing and that these effects are positively associated with firm value.  \n\nPapers by Foerster and Karolyi (1999) and Miller (1999) document positive average abnormal returns for non-U.S. firms that issue exchange-listed American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). These papers and others offer a number of explanations for why cross listing on U.S.  \n\nstock exchanges adds value.2 However, a crucial component in almost all of these explanations is the firm's information environment. The notion that the information environment should be a function of cross listing is natural, as one of the most salient features of exchange-listed ADRs is that their issuance requires the non-U.S. firm to comply with SEC regulations and reconcile their accounts to U.S. GAAP. Firms that list in U.S. markets are, in effect, committing to an increased level of disclosure and scrutiny because of U.S. filing regulations and stock exchange requirements. These changes in transparency could affect firm value by decreasing the cost of capital, increasing the cash flows that ultimately accrue to shareholders, or both.  \n\nFor the cost of capital, Merton's (1987) investor recognition hypothesis is often used to argue that a U.s. listing creates value because the enhanced disclosure environment reduces the cost of following the firm. This increases the investor base and, therefore, the demand for the firm's securities. Barry and Brown (1985) suggest that cost of capital is a function of \"estimation risk’ and the better investors are able to assess the prospects for a company, the lower its expected cost of capital. Along this line of reasoning, Lang and Lundholm (1996) show that analysts’ forecasts are more accurate for firms that disclose more, while Gebhardt, Lee, and Swaminathan (2000) find that firms with more accurate forecasts enjoy a lower implied cost of capital in valuation. Thus, if investors are able to more accurately assess the prospects for a cross-listed firm, its cost of capital should be reduced. Taken together, these investor recognition and estimation risk hypotheses suggest that a firm's information environment can play an important role in determining its cost of capital.  \n\nThe literature also suggests that information the information increase associated with cross listing can influence value through pure cash flow effects by reducing agency costs. For example, cross listing may be associated with improved firm-level corporate governance because it bonds a firm to greater transparency, which should reduce the potential diversion of a firm's cash flows to managers and controlling shareholders [Coffee (1999) and Stulz (1999)]. Consistent with this hypothesis, recent research by Doidge, Karolyi and Stulz (2001) documents that a U.S. listing creates the most value for firms with higher growth opportunities located in countries that have poor disclosure and investor protections. Lins, Strickland, and Zenner (2001), Reese and Weisbach (2002), and Pagano, Roell, and Zechner (2002) argue that cross-listing adds value because the associated disclosure and regulatory discipline increases even local investors? willingness to commit capital.  \n\nDespite its theoretical importance, there is surprisingly little direct evidence on the relation between a firm's information environment and cross listing.’ One factor that makes testing this relation difficult is that it is not possible to directly measure a firm's information environment. For instance, Bailey, Karolyi, and Salva (2002) use price volatility and volume reaction to earnings announcements to conduct tests on the information environment of crosslisted firms. Baker, Nofsinger, and Weaver (2002) test whether “visibility” increases around cross listing with measures of analyst following and media coverage. Our approach is to follow prior research by Lang and Lundholm (1996), Healy, Hutton and Palepu (1999) and Gebhardt, Lee, and Swaminathan (2000) and use the characteristics of analyst forecasts as a proxy for the information environment. In particular, we focus on two measures: the number of analysts following the firm and the accuracy of analyst forecasts. Previous studies suggest that having more analysts with more accurate forecasts is indicative of a firm with a better information environment.t  \n\nAnalyst following should be related to cross listing and value for several reasons. First, to the extent that cross listing increases the quantity of information available to the market, it should reduce the cost of following a firm, which could lead to increased coverage by investment analysts. Second, cross listing widens the potential investment base of a firm. This should be associated with increased analyst activity because analysts are likely to focus on firms which investors find interesting and investors are more likely to consider firms followed by analysts. These predictions are also consistent with the investor relations literature, which suggests that a benefit of increased disclosure is increased analyst following.? Finally, additional analyst following should also bring about more scrutiny, which, in the presence of agency costs, should improve firm value by increasing the cash flows that accrue to shareholders. In summary, increased analyst following around cross-listing can influence aspects of the firm's information environment that have been argued to affect both cash flows and the cost of capital.  \n\nThe above arguments suggest that the firm's disclosures and the information production by analysts are complements. Consistent with this hypothesis, Lang and Lundholm (1996) and Healy, Hutton, and Palepu (1999) find that, for U.S. firms, increased disclosure is associated with higher analyst following. Bushman, Piotroski, and Smith (2001) find similar results internationally.  \n\nOur paper also examines the ex post accuracy of analyst forecasts. To the extent that cross listing increases the amount of information available about the firm, it can be argued that it will improve the accuracy of analyst forecasts. Improved accuracy should then reduce the cost of capital through its effect on estimation risk.  As noted earlier, Gebhardt, Lee, and Swaminathan (2000) find that firms with lower forecast errors have lower implied costs of capital. Improved accuracy may also lessen agency problems to the extent that managers are held more accountable for the details of their firm's cash flows.  \n\nTo sum up the theoretical arguments on cross listing, much of the literature implies that cross listed firms have a richer information environment relative to non-cross listed firms. Empirically, there is support for the notion that a richer information environment for a firm leads to more analysts with more accurate forecasts. This paper adds to the literature by examining analyst activity around cross listing to see if, in fact, the activity is consistent with the hypothesis that cross-listing is associated with improvements in the firm's information environment. We then, in turn, investigate whether these changes in the information environment are linked to firm value.  \n\nIt is important to note that while there exists empirical support for the positive relation between analyst activity and increased disclosure, the association is not obvious. For instance, Lang and Lundholm (1996) note that to the extent that extra disclosure levels the playing field among analysts, it could reduce any one analyst's competitive advantage, which would lessen incentives to cover the firm. Botosan (1997) finds that when firms already have a high analyst following, increased disclosure is not associated with a reduction in the cost of capital.  \n\nSimilarly, the prediction that the required US GAAP reconciliation by exchange-listed firms leads to higher forecast accuracy is not obvious. While cross-listed firms are not required to change local GAAP reporting when they list on US markets, Lang, Raedy, and Yetman (2001) suggest that firms change in ways that make earnings more volatile and more similar to US firms.? For example, firms may adopt more market-value-based reporting to be closer to US GAAP, which might make earnings harder to predict. Similarly, non-U.S. analysts may find it harder to predict earnings following a movement toward US GAAP because they are more familiar with the local GAAP. To the extent that earnings become less predictable around cross listing, it should bias against our finding results.7 Further, we explicitly include controls for earnings surprise in our analysis, which should mitigate the effects of increased volatility. However, it is not obvious ex ante how cross listing will affect analyst activity.  \n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the data. Section 3 examines the impact of cross listing on analyst following and forecast accuracy. Section 4 details the impact of analyst following and performance on firm value. Section 5 offers concluding remarks.  \n\n## 2. Data  \n\nTo examine the firm's information environment, we focus much of our analysis on the levels of our information variables and consider our changes analysis as supplementary. We take this approach for several reasons. First, the predictions from the prior literature for the level of the information environment following cross listing are clearest. In particular, depending on the view of cross listing, it is possible to envision situations in which information environment is important, but is not necessarily reflected in changes around cross listing. For example, as argued in papers like Leuz and Verrecchia (2000) and Coffee (1999), the important aspect of cross listing from a valuation perspective is the commitment (or “bonding\") to increased disclosure rather than the increase in disclosure itself. Cantale (1998), Fuerst (1998), Moel (1999), and Huddart, Hughes, and Brunnermeier (1999) argue that a firm that has history of transparency will still have an incentive to list because it signals its commitment to continuing that policy, even when it faces circumstances under which it might wish not to disclose. Following this reasoning, in Doidge et al (2001) the decision to cross list is indicative of a firm with well-aligned incentives that is therefore willing to submit itself to scrutiny. It is important to note, however, that the firm may have also had a rich information environment prior to the cross listing.  \n\nClosely related, even if the information environment explicitly changes because of the cross listing, the timing may not be clear. For example, it is unlikely that a firm anticipating a US listing would increase disclosure suddenly following the listing or that analysts would suddenly increase their activity. Rather, based on prior research, it seems likely that firms increase disclosure gradually in anticipation of the listing, moving their accounting closer to US GAAP and increasing their footnote disclosure.α  As a result, it is difficult to know the window over which to compute the change. We consider long windows to increase the probability that we capture the entire effect, recognizing that longer windows increase the probability of confounding effects. Finally, evaluating changes substantially reduces sample size and our ability to include historical control variables since the I/B/E/S international dataset only begins large-scale coverage in the early to mid 1990s, and most cross listed firms became listed prior to the mid 1990s.  \n\nTo examine the extent and accuracy of analyst activity, we utilize data from the Historical I/B/E/S International database. The main results of the paper are for the year 1996. This year was chosen because the year-to-year increase in I/B/E/S coverage of firms begins to slow substantially after 1996 and we want to capture any benefits of ADR listings as far back in time as possible. We use data from the eleventh month of the fiscal year to calculate the number of analysts following a company and the forecast accuracy, as O'Brien and Bhushan (1990) document that analyst activity levels off after the eleventh month.” Forecast accuracy is defined as the negative of the absolute value of the analyst forecast error, deflated by stock price:10  \n\nActual earnings (t)- Estimated earnings (t) Forecast Accuracy (t)= - StockPrice (t)  \n\nTo identify firms listing on US markets, we gather information on ADR listings on the NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ. This information is obtained from the Bank of New York, the NYSE, NASDAQ and the CRSP databases. Exchange-listed foreign firms are required to register their offering under the 1933 Securities Act and their reports under the 1934 Exchange Act. That is, the company must meet some SEC disclosure requirements and reconcile to U.S. GAAP. We treat direct listings by Canadian and Israeli firms that cross-list in the U.S. as “ADRs” since these firms must also comply with U.S. GAAP. We verify that all of our results hold if these two countries are removed from the sample.  \n\nSince we are also interested in how the characteristics of analyst forecasts translate into value, we obtain valuation data from Worldscope. We use Tobin's $Q$ as a measure of firm value in regressions that feature analyst activity and accuracy as well as control variables.1? Tobin's $Q$ is computed as total assets less the book value of equity plus the market value of equity in the numerator and book value of assets in the denominator.  \n\nOur potential sample of firms from countries covered by I/B/E/S in 1996 that also have one or more exchange-listed ADR firms contains 8937 observations. When we match firms from I/B/E/S with Worldscope, we use the reference IB/E/S tickers and Worldscope SEDOLs listed in the Datastream database. We augment this process with hand matches based on firm names across the I/B/E/S and Worldscope databases. Inclusion of Worldscope variables reduces our sample substantially. Overall, the sample with I/B/E/S analyst forecast data for fiscal year 1996 includes 4859 firms from 27 countries.  \n\nTable 1 provides summary statistics for the sample based on a firm's country of domicile. Of the 4859 sample firms, 235 firms have exchange-listed ADRs as of the end of 1996. Consistent with Chang, Khanna, and Palepu (2000), we find wide variation across counties in analyst following and forecast accuracy. The median earnings forecast error is 0.52 percent of market value and the median firm is followed by 4 analysts. Table 1 also reports sample statistics for the portion of the sample that has three years of historical earnings data. This sample will be used to control for historical volatility in earnings and returns-earnings correlation, which may affect our basic regression results. In general, the two samples are similar in terms of forecast acuracy and analyst following.  \n\n## 3. The Effect Of Cross Listing On Analyst Coverage and Performance  \n\n### 3.1 Empirical Methodology  \n\nIf there are information effects associated with cross-listing, we expect to see a relation between cross-listing and the characteristics of a firm's information environment.'3 It is clearly important to control for other factors besides cross listing that are also likely to affect the information environment across firms. As such, we follow the models used in Lang and Lundholm (1993, 1996) for our primary specifications and estimate OLS regression models of the following form:  \n\n# Informatim Variables = β。 +β,XLIST+ β,Firm size $+{\\upbeta}_{3}$ Return STD $+\\upbeta_{4}$ (Return to earnings correlation) $+\\upbeta_{5}$ Earnings surprise $+$ Industrycontrols  \n\nwhere:  \n\nInformation Variables $=$ Number of Analysts, Forecast Accuracy  \n\nXLIST $=$ An indicator variable that takes on the value one if the firm has an ADR traded in the U.S that requires reconciliation to U.S. GAAP.  \n\nFirm size $=$ The log of total assets converted to millions of U.S. dollars.  \n\nReturn STD $=$ The standard deviation of returns over the previous three years (winsorized at the $95^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile).  \n\nReturns-earnings correlation $=$ The correlation between returns and earnings over the previous three years.  \n\nEarnings surprise $=$ The absolute value of the difference between current earnings per share and earnings per share from the prior year, divided by the firm's stock price.  \n\nIndustry controls: Indicator variables for IBES industry classification (over 100 classifications that broadly correspond to 2-digit SIC codes).  \n\nWe estimate our first set of regression models with a relatively parsimonious set of control variables in order to maximize the number of observations and power of our tests. Because we are interested in whether cross listing improves the information environment of a firm, we focus on the coefficient of XLIST. Firm size, measured as the log of total assets converted to U.S. dollars, is included in all regressions since larger firms are likely to have more analysts covering them (Bhushan, 1989 and Brennan and Hughes, 1991) and a better disclosure policy (Lang and Lundholm, 1996), leading to better accuracy.14 To control for industry effects, we include IBES industry classification dummies that broadly correspond to 2-digit SIC codes. To control for cross-country effects, we estimate all the regression models using country random effects. We verify that the Hausman test does not reject the null that country effects are random.  \n\nWe estimate a second set of models with control variables suggested by Lang and Lundholm (1996). These additional controls are the standard deviation of returns, the historical correlation between returns and earnings, and the earnings surprise. These are likely to affect forecasts because they affect analysts’ incentives to gather information. Lang and Lundholm (1996) find that return variability is negatively related to the number of analysts following a U.S. firm, indicating that analysts prefer to follow firms with less performance variability. King, Pownall, and Waymire (1990) find that analyst following is positively related to the returnsearnings correlation for U.S. firms, indicating that the incentives for private information gathering are greater when earnings and returns are highly correlated. Lang and Lundholm (1996) find the opposite relation. Finally, Lang and Lundholm (1996) include the percentage earnings surprise to control for the fact that forecast characteristics are likely to be affected by the magnitude of the earnings information to be disclosed. As a result, the effect on accuracy can be interpreted as the value that analysts bring in forecasting earnings relative to a naive random walk model.  \n\nWe estimate one final regression model that has additional control variables found in Alford and Berger (1999) and Lev and Thiagarajan (1993). These papers postulate that the amount of new equity raised during the year might affect analyst coverage of a firm. We proxy for this measure, called \"stock,\" in our analyst regression using the difference in book equity between years. Both papers also use a \"fundamental\" variable intended to capture signals plausibly related to forecast accuracy. Following Alford and Berger (1999), we include in our accuracy regression a composite \"fundamental\" variable that sums the number of fundamental variables in the extreme quartiles of the distribution in year t-1 and is divided by the number of available variables. The fundamental variables are taken from Lev and Thiagarajan (1993), and comprise an inventory signal (the percentage change in inventory minus the percentage change in sales), an accounts receivable signal (the percentage change in accounts receivable minus the percentage change in sales), a gross margin signal (the percentage change in sales minus the percentage change in gross margin), a sales efficiency signal (the percentage change in selling and administration expenses minus the percentage change in sales) and a tax rate signal.'s  \n\n### 3.2 The Relation between Cross Listing and Analyst Coverage  \n\nTo examine the relation between cross listing and analyst coverage, we estimate variants of our basic equation with the number of analysts as the dependent variable. Table 2 reports the coefficient estimates. Model 1 shows that after controlling for firm size, country, and industry, firms that cross-list in the U.S. and reconcile to U.S. GAAP have an average of 3.28 more analysts covering the firm. The model has an adjusted $\\mathsf{R}^{2}$ Oof $30\\%$  \n\nModel 1 does not include any historical earnings data, which increases sample size. In models 2 and 3 we investigate whether our results are robust when we require data on these additional control variables. In all specifications, the coefficient on XLIST is significant and similar in magnitude to the full sample results. For example, Model 2 indicates that firms that cross-list in the U.S. have an average of 3.27 more analysts covering the firm (compared to 3.28 in Model 1). Overall, the control variables have the expected signs and are generally significant. For example, analyst coverage is positively related to firm size. Model 2 also shows that analyst coverage is positively related to the correlation between returns and earnings and negatively related to the standard deviation of returns and the size of the earnings surprise. Model 3 shows that the coefficient on our proxy for new equity issues is correctly signed and significant. The relation between XLIST and analyst coverage remains positive and significant.  \n\nOverall, the results contained in Table 2 suggest that cross listing is associated with greater analyst following. This finding is consistent with the notion that cross listing lowers the cost of following the firm, which, in turn, leads to increased coverage of the firm by investment analysts. In addition, the finding of increased analyst activity is consistent with an increase in the firm's shareholder base, since Bhushan and O'Brien (1990) document a strong correlation between institutional investors and analyst following. Therefore, our findings provide support for the hypothesis that cross listing improves the information environment of the firm, at least as measured by analyst following. Furthermore, since changes in the shareholder base have been linked to changes in stock returns around cross-listing (Foerster and Karolyi, 1999), the increase in analyst activity may indeed lead to an increase in shareholder value. We return to this possibility later.  \n\n### 3.3 The Relation between Cross-Listing and Forecast Accuracy  \n\nIn this section, we investigate the association between cross listing and the information environment of the firm by examining analysts’ forecast accuracy. If cross listing increases the type and quantity of financial information disclosed by the firm, then analysts should be able to more accurately predict the earnings of foreign firms. We test this by re-estimating our basic equation (1) with forecast accuracy as the dependent variable.  \n\nModel 1 of Table 3 shows that after controlling for firm size, country, and industry effects, the coefficient on XLIST is positive and significant (0.0056, p-value $=0.04$ ). This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that the increased disclosure associated with cross-listing provides analysts with more complete and reliable information with which to predict earnings. It also provides international support for the findings of Lang and Lundholm (1996) that increased disclosure reduces analyst earnings forecast errors for U.S. firms.  \n\nModels 2 and 3 confirm that these results are robust when we include the additional historical earnings controls. Again, signs on the control variables are generally consistent with the prior literature. Forecast accuracy is greater for larger firms and firms with a higher correlation between returns and earnings, and is lower for firms with more volatile returns and in years in which there are large earnings surprises.  \n\n### 3.4 Endogeneity issues  \n\nA potential concern with the preceding analysis is endogeneity. Suppose, for example, that firms with high analyst following or high forecast accuracy tend to cross list for reasons unrelated to their information environment, and that this is not captured by our controls or country and industry effects. Then, we might infer a link between information variables and cross listing when none exists. For example, suppose that  \n\n$$\n\\Upsilon=\\beta\\mathrm{{x}}+\\updelta\\mathrm{{C}}+\\mathfrak{\\varepsilon},\n$$  \n\nwhere C is the indicator variable that takes on the value one if the firm lists in the US. Since firms decide whether to cross list based on various factors, we can model this decision as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\mathrm{C^{*}=\\gamma_{w}^{'}+u}}\\ {\\mathrm{C=1}\\quad\\quad\\mathrm{if~C^{*}>0,~0~o t h e r w i s e}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIf the typical firm selects to cross list because of some expected benefit in Y, then OLS estimates of & will not correctly measure the effect of cross-listing. This problem of self-selection is often handled empirically with a treatment effect model (see e.g., Greene 1990).  \n\nTo mitigate this potential issue, we apply a self-selection model that controls for this bias and re-estimate Tables 2 and 3. Similar to Doidge et al. (2001), we model the decision to cross list as a function of the country-level variables, including the legal origin and the aggregate liquidity ratio. We also include firm size as an explanatory variable since it is likely to be the most important firm-level effect. We obtain consistent estimates via full Maximum Likelihood estimation.16  \n\nTable 4 reports results for the forecast accuracy and analyst following regressions after controlling for potential selection bias. The explanatory variables are generally significant in the listing regression. Consistent with expectations, cross listing firms tend to be larger firms from countries with an English legal tradition (the indicator variable excluded from the regression) with less liquid local markets. More important, with the selection bias correction, results remain very similar to those reported earlier, with forecast accuracy and analyst following still significantly associated with cross listing. In particular, XLIST in both models is correctly signed and is significant at the $1\\%$ critical level. Subject to the limitations of this approach, it does not appear that endogeneity drives the previous OLS empirical results.  \n\nAnother potential concern is that we have misspecified our models by estimating the analyst following regression separately from the forecast accuracy model. In particular, Alford and Berger (1999) suggest that analyst forecast accuracy and analyst following may be simultaneously determined. To assess this, we specify two models similar to those contained in Alford and Berger (1999). We model analyst coverage as a function of forecast accuracy, cross listing and stock, and we model forecast accuracy as a function of analyst coverage, cross listing, the standard deviation of returns and fundamentals. Results are presented in Table 5. Again, the simultaneous equations results are consistent with our main results in Tables 2 and 3. In particular, the positive relation between cross listing and analyst following and forecast accuracy remains significant and very similar to the earlier results even after taking into account potential simultaneity.  \n\n### 3.5 Time-Series Estimation  \n\nOur cross sectional analysis establishes a link between cross listing and a firm's information environment. Further, the results are robust to our adjustments for potential endogeneity and simultaneity. However, a cross sectional analysis is unable to shed light on the extent to which the information environment changes around cross listing. For example, it could still be case that only firms with high analyst following and accurate forecasts choose to crosslist and our controls have not successfully mitigated that effect. An alternate approach that allows us to assess to what extent observed differences between ADR and non-ADR firms are due to self selection is to use time-series data for ADR firms to examine how the information environment changes before and after cross-listing. If we are simply documenting self selection, we should not observe significant changes in information production around the cross-listing period.  \n\nOur time-series tests consist of regressions estimated using panel data on analyst activity around the time of the ADR listing. As noted earlier, a problem with this approach is determining the window over which to expect the change. For instance, it can be argued that cross-listing firms will incrementally change their reporting strategies in advance of the formal adoption of US GAAP. We choose to use a long “event' window, including the three years prior to and after cross listing, to increase our confidence that we do in fact capture the entire effect and have enough observations to ensure reliable measures of our dependent variables. The cost of this approach is that it reduces our sample size to 59 firms, which lessens the power of our statistical tests.  \n\nThe dependent variable in our regressions is either the number of analysts or forecast accuracy. To capture whether there has been a change in analysts or accuracy, we construct a \"Post-ADR” dummy variable set equal to one for the years in the panel dataset that fall after the firm has issued its exchange-listed ADR. Since the event is centered on the year of the ADR, that year is removed from the regressions. All regressions include firm fixed effects and are reported with robust standard errors with firm clusters that account for a lack of independence between the observations of each firm. Firm fixed effects implicitly control for the calendar year of each ADR firm, which helps to ensure that our results are not driven by a subset of years in which analyst fllowing or forecast accuracy increased for other reasons.17  The time-series distribution of our sample ADRs is as follows (number of ADRs per year is in parentheses): 1990 (5), 1991 (10), 1992 (7), 1993 (9), 1994 (14), 1995 (10), 1996 (4).  \n\nIt would be optimal to also control for contemporaneous changes in the historical earnings variables, standard deviation of returns and returns-earnings correlation, in our time series models. Unfortunately, we cannot include these controls from our cross-sectional regressions because each variable requires three years of historical data to compute, and our time-series analysis already requires three years of data prior to the ADR listing date.  The I/B/E/S data do not go back far enough to make these controls feasible. Further, we cannot include total assets because doing so requires matching to Worldscope, which substantially reduces sample size. We include the firm's prior year stock return as a simple contemporaneous control to capture the possibility that analysts may be drawn to firms with higher returns to shareholders. We also include earnings surprise in these models since it, too, requires only one year of historical earnings data. Including these two control variables causes us to lose the initial pre-ADR observation for 14 of our firms. We also lose three observations due to fiscal month changes. Thus, our panel for the 59 firms is slightly unbalanced (337 observations compared to an expected 354 observations). For robustness, we re-estimate our models using only the first two post-ADR years when the initial pre-ADR year is missing due to data omissions (thus obtaining a balanced panel), and find that our results are unchanged (not tabulated).  \n\nTable 6 shows that our information variables significantly increase around cross listing. Model 1 of Panel A shows that firms pick up an additional 3.81 analysts after cross listing. This coefficient is larger than the analyst coefficients of Tables 2, 4, and 5. Our results are consistent with Baker, Nofsinger, and Weaver (2002) who also document that analyst coverage increases substantially following cross listing. Model 2 of Table 6 shows analyst forecasts become more accurate after cross-listing, and the coefficient is again larger than those of Tables 3, 4 and 5. Overall, the evidence contained in Table 6 indicates that self-selection is not exclusively driving the previous cross-sectional results. We interpret these findings as additional support for our cross-sectional analysis that the information environment, as represented by the increased analyst coverage and forecast accuracy, improves around a U.S. crosslisting.  \n\nIn sum, the evidence in the preceding sections suggests that cross listing in the U.S. and the associated commitment to increase disclosure allow firms to enjoy greater analyst coverage and increased forecast accuracy relative to other firms that are not cross-listed. Taken together, these findings provide empirical support for the notion that the cross-listing is associated with a significantly improved informational environment relative to those firms that are not cross-listed. The requirement that foreign firms must adhere to U.S. GAAP is one of the most visible aspects of cross-listing on a U.S. exchange. Our findings suggest that U.S. listing does indeed positively affect the ability of analysts to gather and process information regarding the firm. We next investigate whether this increase in information production translates into a higher firm value.  \n\n## 4. The Relation between Analyst Coverage and Performance and Firm Value  \n\nTobin's $Q$ is our proxy for firm value and this data is obtained for our sample firms from Worldscope. There are 5539 firms with 1996 I/B/E/S analyst data for which fiscal-year 1996 Tobin's $Q$ can be computed. Table 7 reports the results of regression models in which Tobin's $Q$ is regressed on both forecast accuracy and the number of analysts as well as controls. Since country level factors such as investor protections can have important implications for firm value (LLSV 2002, Doidge, Karolyi and Stulz, 2001), we employ country controls. Again, we implement the treatment effect model to account for potential endogeneity using the same decision criteria as in Table 4.  \n\nTable 7 shows that after controlling for firm size, industry, and country of domicile, the coefficient on forecast accuracy is positive and significant (1.0911, p-value $:=0.02$ ). This finding suggests that when analyst forecasts are more accurate, firm values are higher. This higher valuation is consistent with Gebhardt, Lee, and Swaminathan (2001) results suggesting that firms with lower forecasts errors tend to have a lower implied cost of capital or higher expected cash flows. It also supports the hypothesis that firm value is a function of estimation risk, and that the better investors are able to assess the prospects of a company, the greater is firm value.  \n\nTable 7 also shows that the coefficient on the number of analysts is positive and significant (0.025, p-value ${\\mathrm{:=}}0.00$ ). This evidence indicates that firm value is increasing in analyst following. Since analyst following is likely to be correlated with investor following, the higher valuation is consistent with a lower cost of capital or with reduced agency costs. Since both forecast accuracy and analyst coverage are positively and significantly related to firm value, this suggests that cross-listing may indeed increase value by improving the information environment of the firm. For example, if firms that cross-list pick up an additional 3.81 analysts and a 0.015 increase in accuracy (from the time-series analysis in Table 6), this would translate into an increase of $11.2\\%$ in firm value.19  These results are robust to the inclusion of the cross listing variable, suggesting that it is not simply the case that we are capturing the higher valuations of cross-listed firms documented in Doidge et al. (2001). On the other hand, the cross listing variable is also significant in the presence of forecast accuracy and the number of analysts, indicating that information effects (at least as we measure them) do not alone explain the higher valuations of cross-listed firms.  \n\n### 4.1 Time-Series Estimation  \n\nTo document an incremental effect of analyst following and forecast accuracy on firm value around the cross listing, we need tests that control for other factors associated with cross listings and increased disclosure, which may, in turn, affect firm value. For instance, our prior analysis indicates that analyst following and forecast accuracy increase around cross listing and we know from prior research that cross-listing firms, in general, have positive returns. Therefore, we are concerned that a documented positive relation between changes in information variables and changes in value could simply capture that phenomenon.  \n\nThe crux of our valuation question is whether firms that experience the greatest improvement in their information environment enjoy the greatest valuation benefits to cross listing. To answer this question, we implement a two-stage approach. In the first stage, we use our models that explain analyst following and forecast accuracy to predict the expected levels of these measures for each firm for each year from 1990 to 1998. Next, for our cross-listed sample firms, we obtain the residuals from these models, which correspond to the levels of \"excess analysts\" and \"excess forecast accuracy\" for each cross-listed firm by year. Since the coefficients of these models are determined from the full sample of firms, we are able to determine the cross-listed firm's \"expected\" information environment (in terms of analyst following and forecast accuracy) based on its overall firm attributes.  \n\nOur specific approach to obtain predicted and residual values in each year is to regress either analyst coverage or forecast accuracy on firm size, the standard deviation of returns, the return to earnings correlation, and the earnings surprise. The models used correspond to Model 2 of Tables 2 and 3, with the exception of our size control, which uses the market value of equity from I/B/E/S rather than a firm's total assets. This substitution avoids a substantial loss of observations in the early years due to poor Worldscope coverage.  \n\nWe next compute Tobin's $Q$ values for our cross-listed firms for each year from 1990 to 1998. Finally, we conduct a regression analysis (estimated with heteroskedastic-consistent standard errors) in which the dependent variable is the change in Tobin's $Q$ from the year before the ADR to the year after the ADR. This two-year window allows us to include 66 firms in the analysis - enlarging the window beyond two years is not feasible, as it would reduce the sample by half. The independent variables in the regression are the changes in the residual levels of analyst coverage and forecast accuracy from the year before the ADR to the year after the ADR. Our argument is that if changes in the information environment are important benefits to cross listing, we should see a positive association; firms that benefit the most from cross listing should be those for which cross listing more significantly improves their information environment.  \n\nTable 8 presents results from this analysis. Our results show that an improved information environment around cross listing is associated with an increase in firm valuation. In particular, there is a positive association between the change in Tobin's Q and the change in \"excess analysts\" and “excess forecast accuracy.\" Models 1 and 2 in the table estimate the effects separately, and Model 3 indicates that changes in both “excess analysts” and “excess forecast accuracy”’ are important in explaining changes in firm value. We conclude from this valuation analysis that cross listing does indeed enhance firm value through its effect on the firm's information environment.  \n\n## 5. Conclusion  \n\nIn this paper, we examine whether cross listing on U.S. stock exchanges improves the information environment, and, ultimately, the valuation of non-U.S. firms. We document several interesting findings: First, we show that non-U.S. firms that cross list enjoy greater analyst coverage and increased forecast accuracy relative to other firms that are not cross-listed. Second, a time series analysis shows that the change in analyst coverage and forecast accuracy occurs around the cross-listing period. Third, we document that firms that have more analyst coverage and higher forecast accuracy have a higher valuation. Finally, we show that ADR firms with greater improvements in information environment around cross listing also experience larger increases in valuations, which is consistent with these firms enjoying a lower cost of capital or improved corporate governance.  \n\nThese findings have important implications for several strands of research. The large literature on international cross-listings suggests that information disclosure plays a key role in the cross-listing decision. While theory predicts firms that cross-list on a more transparent exchange should be valued more highly, there has been little direct empirical evidence regarding the role of information disclosure and its impact on cross-listing. Our findings provide evidence that important changes occur in the information environment of firms around cross-listing and that these changes are rewarded with higher valuations by the market. In addition, since other factors such as investor protection and agency problems have been argued to be important to the cross-listing decision, our findings suggest control variables that may allow for a more detailed examination of other benefits to cross-listing.  \n\nOur findings also are consistent with the literature that links disclosure to the cost of capital. Theoretical research like Diamond and Verrecchia (1991) and Baiman and Verrecchia (1996) indicates that a commitment to increase disclosure (and, hence, to reduce information asymmetries) will be rewarded with a reduced cost of capital. Our findings that link analyst activity and firm value around cross-listing are consistent with these theories and complement recent empirical work such as Leuz and Verrecchia (2000) and Gebhart, Lee, and Swaminathan (2001).  \n\nFinally, our results can also be viewed as additional indirect evidence in the debate on the costs and benefits of high-quality accounting standards. While not a direct test of the effects of disclosure requirements, our results on the economic impact of increased disclosure around cross-listing should at least be of interest to policy makers considering a change in reporting standards, since much of the debate centers on the benefits of disclosure.  \n\n## References  \n\nAlexander, Gordon, Cheol S.

Our model explains the difference between blacks and whites in the relations between education and AFQT and between wages and education. It cannot easily explain why, conditional only on AFQT, blacks earn no more than do whites. It does, however, suggest, that when comparing the earnings of blacks and whites, one should control for both AFQT and education in which case a substantial black-white wage differential reemerges. We explore and reject the hypothesis that differences in school quality between blacks and whites explain the wage and education differentials. Our findings support the view that some of the black-white wage differential reflects the operation of the labor market.  \n\nKevin Lang   \nDepartment of Economics   \nBoston University   \n270 Bay State Road   \nBoston, MA 02215   \nand NBER   \nlang @ bu.edu  \n\nMichael Manove Department of Economics Boston University 270 Bay State Road Boston, MA 02215 manove @ bu.edu  \n\n### 1 Introduction  \n\nIn a highly infuential article, Derek Neal and William Johnson (1996) argue that wage differentials between blacks and whites can be explained by productivity-related personal characteristics (premarket factors). They show that the black-white differential is dramatically reduced, and in some cases eliminated, by controlling for performance on the Armed Forces Qualifications Test (AFQT). Since, for their sample, AFQT was administered before the individual entered the labor market, it cannot be affected directly by labor market discrimination. Therefore, either premarket factors explain wage differentials or AFQT must be affected by anticipated discrimination in the labor market. However, Neal and Johnson (hereafter NJ) show that the effect of AFQT on the earnings of blacks is at least as large as on the earnings of whites. Therefore blacks should not anticipate a smaller return to investment in cognitive skills. Thus they conclude that premarket factors and not labor market discrimination account for black-white earnings differentials.1  \n\nThis paper shows that in comparison with controlling for AFQT alone, wage differentials are substantially larger when we control for both education and AFQT. The reason is that conditional on AFQT, blacks get significantly more education than do whites. This raises two questions. Why do blacks obtain more education than whites with the same AFQT? Can we attribute the wage differential to labor-market discrimination.  \n\nWe focus primarily on the first question. One possible explanation for the additional education obtained by African Americans is that they attend lower quality schools than whites do. If AFQT is mostly determined by school inputs, and blacks get less of an AFQT benefit from schooling than do whites, then for a given amount of schooling, blacks will have lower AFQT scores. This means that for a given AFQT score, blacks will have more education than whites. We test this hypothesis directly by controlling for measurable differences in school quality, and we find that school quality cannot explain the education differential.  \n\nWe therefore explore an alternative hypothesis: that education is generally a more valuable signal of productivity for blacks than for whites. As a result blacks invest more heavily in the signal and get more education for a given level of ability. Our signalling model, developed below, implies that blacks within a broad range of intermediate ability levels should obtain more education than equally able whites, though blacks with either low or high levels of ability should obtain the same education as whites do. This is confirmed in the data when we use an appropriate measure of AFQT as a proxy for ability.  \n\nIn interpreting these results, we do not consider the AFQT to be a measure of innate ability;  \n\nrather we view it as a measure of both innate and acquired personal traits. We do not attempt to explain the behavior of children and adolescents prior to the administration of the AFQT, nor do we assume such behavior takes account of the value of investment in education or human capital. But we do assume that students act as rational agents after the administration of the AFQT, who, aside from wanting to invest in their human capital, are motivated by a desire to signal.  \n\nUnfortunately, our model does not explain why blacks have earnings that are similar or somewhat lower than those of whites conditional on only AFQT unless education is a pure signal at the margin, an assumption that we find somewhat extreme. Since for a given AFQT, blacks get more education than do whites, they should also earn more than whites not somewhat less. The remaining difference could reflect either missing variables or labor market discrimination. This is an old debate that precedes NJ, and it is not one we will pretend to resolve. We do explore whether the wage differential can be explained by differences in the quality of schools attended by blacks and whites and find no evidence to support this hypothesis.  \n\nThe paper is organized as follows. We begin with the principle empirical finding: that conditional on AFQT, blacks get more education than do whites. We show that this differential cannot be explained by differences in the quality of the schools attended by blacks and whites. We then present our model of statistical discrimination/educational sorting and show that it implies that blacks get more education than whites except at very low and very high levels of ability. We also develop the implications of the model for wage/education profiles. We then return to the data and test the implications of the model. Next we turn our attention to the Neal/Johnson findings and show that, as would be expected from the earlier results, a substantial black-white wage differential reemerges when we control for education as well as AFQT. In the conclusion we explore the implications of the failure of our model's prediction that blacks will earn more than whites conditional only onAFQT.  \n\n### 2 Educational Attainment: Empirical Findings  \n\n#### 2.1 The Data  \n\nAlthough our initial focus is on differences in educational attainment not wages, later in the paper we will want to place our results in juxtaposition with those of Neal and Johnson. Therefore to a large extent, we mimic their procedures. Following NJ, we rely on data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79). Since 1979 the NLSY has followed individuals born between 1957 and 1964. Initially surveys were conducted annually. More recently, they have been administered every other year. The NLSY oversamples blacks and Hispanics as well as people from poor families and the military. We drop the military subsample and use sampling weights to generate representative results.2  \n\nEducation is given by the highest grade completed as of 2000. For those missing the 2000 variable, we used highest grade completed as of 1998 and for those missing 1998 as well, we used the 1996 variable. Where available we used the 1996 weight. For observations missing the 1996 weight, we imputed the weight from the 1998 and 2000 weights using the predicted value from regressions of the 1996 weights on the 1998 and/or 2000 weights.  \n\nWe determined race and sex on the basis of the sub-sample to which the individual belongs. Thus all members of the male-Hispanic cross-section sample were deemed to be male and Hispanic regardless of how they were coded by the interviewer.  \n\nIn 1980, the NLSY administered the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) to members of the sample. A subset of the ASVAB is used to generate the Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT) score. The AFQT is generally viewed as an aptitude test comparable to other measures of general intelligence. Like other such measures, it is generally regarded as refecting a combination of environmental and hereditary factors. The AFQT was recalibrated in 1989. The NLSY data provide the 1989 AFQT measure. Following NJ, we regressed the AFQT score on age (using the 1981 weights) and adjusted the AFQT score by subtracting age times the coefficient on age. We then renormed the adjusted AFQT to have mean zero and variance one.  \n\nIn the later part of the paper, we also examine wages. Because of the difficulties in addressing differential selection into labor force participation of black and white women (Neal, 2004), we limit our estimates using wages to men. In order to minimize the problem of missing data, we used hourly earnings data from the 1996, 1998 and 2000 waves of the survey. Next we took all observations with hourly wages between $\\$1$ and $\\$100$ in all three years and calculated (unweighted) mean hourly earnings for this balanced panel. We used the average changes in hourly wages to adjust 1996 and 2000 wages to 1998 wages. Note that this adjustment includes both an economy-wide nominal wage growth factor and an effect of increased experience. We then used the adjusted 1996, 1998 and 2000 wages for the entire sample to calculate mean adjusted wages for all respondents. We limited ourselves to observation/years in which the wage was between $\\$1$ and $\\$100$ .If the respondent had three valid wage observations, we used the mean of those three. If the respondent had two observations, we used the average of those two. For those with only one observation, the wage measure corresponds to that adjusted wage. There were 237 observations of men who were interviewed in at least one of the three years but who did not have a valid wage in any of the three years. In the quantile regressions, these individuals are given low imputed wages except for a five cases coded as missing for which the reported wage in at least one of the three years exceeded $\\$100$ per hour and for which there was no year with a valid reported wage.  \n\n#### 2.2 Findings  \n\nMost labor economists are aware that average education is lower among blacks than among whites. In our sample blacks get about three-quarters of a year less education than do whites. It is less well known that conditional on AFQT, blacks get more education than whites do. This is shown in Table 1.3 In the first and fourth columns, we show the difference in educational attainment between blacks and non-Hispanic whites among men and among women conditional on age and AFQT. Black men get about 1.2 years more education than do white men with the same AFQT. Among women the difference is about 1.3 years. There are also smaller but statistically significant differences between Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites.  \n\nWhy should blacks, and to a lesser extent Hispanics, obtain more education than whites with the same measured cognitive skills? There are, of course, a large number of potential hypotheses. We will focus on two. The first is that AFQT is largely determined by schooling. The second is that statistical discrimination in the labor market leads them to over-invest in education.  \n\nThe first explanation can be summarized as follows. Since blacks attend lower quality schools, on average they gain fewer cognitive skills from a given level of education. Under this view, it is not surprising that blacks have more schooling given their AFQT; they require more schooling to reach a given level of cognitive skills. When we regress education on AFQT, we are, in effect, estimating a reverse regression.  \n\nFor lower school quality among blacks to explain their greater education given their AFQT, it is important that the effect of schooling on AFQT be sufficiently large. To see this, let us consider the opposite extreme. Suppose that AFQT were fully determined before age 15 (the youngest age at which members of the sample were tested) and therefore before students typically dropout. Then AFQT would be exogenous to the dropout decision. The question then would only be whether raising school quality increases or decreases educational attainment. Put differently, of two people with IQ's of 100 (or normalized AFQT's of 0), would we expect the one in a higher quality school to get more or less education than the one in the lower quality school?  \n\nMost labor economists would expect that holding other factors constant, lower school quality would lower years of education. Standard theoretical models do not offer us unambiguous results about the effect of school quality on years of schooling. In these models, the sign of the effect depends on second derivatives. The data, however, suggest a positive correlation between school quality and years of schooling (e.g. Card and Krueger 1992a&b).  \n\nTo summarize, if AFQT is heavily infuenced by education and if most sample members had completed their education at the time that they took the AFQT, then school quality differences would provide a plausible explanation for the higher education among blacks given their AFQT. If school quality has little effect on AFQT or if most sample members had not completed schooling, then we would expect blacks to get less education given their AFQT or given their AFQT and completed schooling at the time they took the test. Our own view is that the AFQT measures skills that are more heavily affected by preadolescent and early adolescent education so that the endogeneity of AFQT to ultimate educational attainment is not likely to be a major issue. However, others certainly disagree. Therefore we address the question empirically.  \n\nOur first approach is to measure the education differential conditional on measured school inputs. Because the NLSY was unable to obtain school quality information for a significant minority of respondents, the middle column of each panel of table 1 replicates the first column for the sample with school input information. The principal results do not change. The estimated black/white education gaps differ by a couple of hundredths. For Hispanic men, the estimate education gap does increase.  \n\nThe third column in each panel controls for standard inputs into the education production function. Almost none of the individual coefficients is statistically significant. Among men, attending a school with more highly educated teachers is associated with greater educational attainment. Among women this variable and attending a school with more library books is associated with getting more education. In part, the paucity of individually significant factors refects multicollinearity among the measured inputs. In both cases, the coefficients on the school inputs are jointly significant. More importantly, controlling for these factors has almost no effect on the estimated education gaps.  \n\nTable 2 repeats the exercise for individuals born after 1961 (the sample used by NJ). Only about 5% of this sample had completed schooling when they took the AFQT. While their AFQT may have been influenced by their education up to this point, future education should be caused by skills acquired up to this point and not the other way around. In addition to controlling for AFQT, we now control for grade completed as of 1980. As can be seen, the coeffcient on completed schooling, although statistically significant, is small. Not surprisingly therefore, the results are similar when we do not control for completed schooling as of 1980, and we therefore do not show the results.  \n\nFor women, the education differences are similar to those obtained in table 1. Relative to nonHispanic white women, black women get about 1.3 years more education and Hispanic women get about half a year more education. For men, the numbers are somewhat different from those in table 1. For blacks, the education differential is somewhat smaller than in table 1 but still quite large. For Hispanics the differential is larger and the somewhat puzzling difference between those with and without school quality data remains.  \n\nBecause inputs may be a very poor proxy for school quality, in table 3 we control for measures of school composition and student behavior. These are designed to capture some of the elements that people think about when they think about struggling schools: high proportions of disadvantaged students, high dropout rates and poor attendance. The results are very similar to those we obtained in tables 1 and 2. Among all men, the estimated education differentials are similar to those obtained with all men without controls for both blacks and Hispanics. For the younger cohorts the estimated differential for blacks is somewhat larger than is obtained without controls. For women there is little difference from the results we obtain without controls both for all women and for the younger women.  \n\nMoreover, consistent with Cameron and Heckman (2002), the findings in tables 1-3 are robust to including measures of family background (not shown). Controlling for mother's and father's education, number of siblings and father's and mother's occupation (12 categories) has little or no effect on either the coefficient on black or on AFQT. Controlling for parental education does noticeably increase the Hispanic/non-Hispanic white education differential. Based on parental education, Hispanics would be predicted to get much less education than they actually obtain.  \n\nBefore we move on, it is important to make it clear what we are not claiming. As stated in the introduction, we are not claiming that AFQT is innate or even unaffected by education and school quality. And we are not claiming that school quality is unrelated to educational attainment. To the contrary, individuals who attend higher quality schools both have higher AFQT's and get more education. It is beyond the scope of the paper to address whether these relations are causal. However, from our perspective, the simplest and most probable explanation for our results is that the effect of school quality on AFQT and the effect of school quality on educational attainment roughly cancel so that AFQT given educational attainment is roughly independent of school quality.  \n\n### 3 Why Blacks Get More Education than Whites: A Signaling Model  \n\nWhy then do blacks get more education than do whites with the same measured ability? In this section, we argue that statistical discrimination against blacks creates incentives for them to signal ability through education. We believe that ethnographic evidence supports the view that blacks see education as a means of getting ahead. Newman (1999) finds that blacks in low-skill jobs in Harlem view education as crucial to getting a good job and that blacks with low levels of education have difficulty obtaining even jobs that we would not normally think of as requiring a high school diploma. Kirschenman and Neckerman (1991) also find that employers are particularly circumspect in their assessment of low-skill blacks, a finding consistent with our approach.  \n\nOur theoretical model merges the standard model of statistical discrimination (Aigner and Cain, 1977) with a conventional sorting model. In a sense, it stands Lundberg and Startz (1983) on its head, by dealing with observable investment in contrast with the unobservable investment in that paper. As is standard in the statistical discrimination literature, we assume that the productivity of blacks is less easily observed than the productivity of whites. However, consistent with our reading of the ethnographic literature, we make one nonstandard assumption. We assume that as education levels increase, the ability of firms to assess the productivity of black and white workers converges.  \n\nOur strategy for analyzing statistical discrimination is to develop a game-theoretic signaling model of educational attainment and apply it separately to blacks and to whites, by setting appropriate parameters for each group. Then we compare the equilibrium outcomes of the two groups. We assume that the ability of firms to observe worker productivity increases with the worker's education and that for sufficiently high levels of education, firms observe productivity precisely. The results would not change substantively if at that level there were additional uncertainty about productivity, provided that the uncertainty was orthogonal to information available to either workers or firms. Economics departments may have considerable uncertainty about the future productivity of a freshly-minted Ph.D., but their predictions are likely to be as accurate as those of the job candidate. We assume that, in contrast, without information revealed by the level of education itself, employers hiring workers with lower levels of education would not know as much about potential employees’ productivity as those workers do.  \n\nThe principal result is that since they have greater diffculty observing blacks’ productivity, employers put more weight on the observable signal of productivity, education, when making offers to blacks than they do when making offers to whites. In response, blacks choose to get more education.  \n\n#### 3.1 The Signaling Game  \n\nConsider a game between a continuum of workers of different ability levels $a$ , where $a$ is continuously distributed over some fixed interval. Each worker must choose a level of education $s$ . Because we assume that education and ability are complementary inputs in the creation of productivity (in a sense defined below), we shall search for a separating equilibrium in which the workers’ strategy profile is described by a continuous and differentiable function $S(a)$ , strictly increasing in $a$ , where $s=S(a)$ is the education obtained by a worker of ability $a$ . Firms in our model simply follow the rules of a competitive labor market—they play no strategic role in the game. (But employers beliefs about $S$ in equilibrium are required to be correct.)  \n\nSuppose that a worker's productivity $p^{*}$ , conditional on his education level $s$ and ability $a$ ,has the log-normal distribution given by  \n\n$$\np^{*}=Q(s,a)\\hat{\\varepsilon},\n$$  \n\nwhere $Q(s,a)$ is a deterministic function of education and ability and where $\\varepsilon\\equiv\\ln\\hat{\\varepsilon}$ is a normal random variable with mean O and variance $\\sigma_{\\varepsilon}^{2}$ . Letting $q(s,a)\\equiv\\ln Q(s,a)$ denote the mean of $\\ln{p^{*}}$ ， we can write log productivity as  \n\n$$\n\\ln p^{*}=q(s,a)+\\varepsilon.\n$$  \n\nWe assume that the effect of education on log-productivity is characterized by diminishing returns $q_{s s}<0$ ) but that ability complements the productivity-increasing effects of education ( $q_{s a}\\geq0$  \n\nA potential employer can observe a worker's education level $s$ but not his true productivity $p^{*}$ However, the employer does observe a productivity signal $p$ given by  \n\n$$\n\\ln p=\\ln p^{*}+u,\n$$  \n\nwhere $u$ is a random error of observation. The error term $u$ has variance $\\sigma_{u}^{2}(s)$ , which is common to all frms, continuous and decreasing in $s$ . We assume that $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ and $u$ are independently distributed.  \n\nLet $\\lambda(s)\\in[0,1]$ be given by  \n\n$$\n\\lambda(s)\\equiv\\frac{\\sigma_{\\varepsilon}^{2}}{\\sigma_{\\varepsilon}^{2}+\\sigma_{u}^{2}(s)}.\n$$  \n\nIf $\\lambda(s)$ is near $0$ ,then $\\sigma_{u}^{2}(s)$ must be large, in which case the employer's ability to observe worker productivity directly is poor. Conversely, if $\\lambda(s)=1$ ,then $\\sigma_{u}^{2}(s)=0$ , and the employer can observe  \n\nworker productivity perfectly. In the latter case, workers would have no incentive to signal their productivity to employers, and they would obtain the efficient level of education.  \n\n#### 3.1.1 The Equilibrium Competitive Wage  \n\nIn the candidate separating equilibrium described by the workers’ strategy profle $S$ , an employer can infer a worker's ability $a$ from his knowledge of the worker's education $s$ .If ${\\hat{q}}(s)$ denotes the employer's equilibrium inference about the value of $q(s,a)$ conditional on $s$ ,it follows that $\\hat{q}(s)\\equiv q(s,A(s))$ , where $A\\equiv S^{-1}$  \n\nProposition 1 From the point of view of an employer who has observed a worker's productivity signal $p$ andeducationlevel $s$ , the conditional mean and variance of the unobservable random element $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ isgivenby  \n\n$$\nE[\\varepsilon|p,s]=\\lambda(s)(\\ln p-\\hat{q}(s))\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n\\sigma^{2}[\\varepsilon|p,s]=\\left(1-\\lambda(s)\\right)\\sigma_{\\varepsilon}^{2}.\n$$  \n\nProof. Because the values of $\\ln p-{\\hat{q}}(s)$ and $s$ uniquely determine $p$ , we know that any expectation conditioned on $p$ and $s$ will remain unchanged if conditioned on $\\ln p-{\\hat{q}}(s)$ and $s$ instead. Therefore we can write  \n\n$$\nE[\\varepsilon|p,s]\\equiv E[\\varepsilon|\\ln p-\\hat{q}(s),s].\n$$  \n\nMoreover, (2) and (3) imply that  \n\n$$\n\\ln p-{\\hat{q}}(s)=u+\\varepsilon\n$$  \n\nin equilibrium. The proposition now follows from (6) and from standard results for the sum of independent normal random variables. ■  \n\nIn a competitive labor market, an employer will offer the wage $\\hat{w}(p,s)\\equiv E[p^{*}|p,s]$ to a worker with observed characteristics $p$ and $s$ .We show:  \n\nProposition 2 The log of the equilibrium competitive wage is given by  \n\n$$\n\\ln\\hat{w}(p,s)=\\lambda(s)\\ln p+(1-\\lambda(s))\\bigl(\\hat{q}(s)+.5\\sigma_{e}^{2}\\bigr).\n$$  \n\nProof. We calculate the expected values of the terms of equation (2) conditional on the observed $p$ and $s$ . This yields  \n\n$$\n{\\cal E}[\\ln p^{*}|p,s]=\\hat{q}(s)+{\\cal E}[\\varepsilon|p,s].\n$$  \n\nApplying Proposition 1 give us  \n\n$$\nE[\\ln p^{*}\\mid p,s]=\\lambda(s)\\ln p+\\left(1-\\lambda(s)\\right)\\hat{q}(s)\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n\\sigma^{2}[\\ln p^{*}|p,s]=\\left(1-\\lambda(s)\\right)\\sigma_{\\varepsilon}^{2}.\n$$  \n\nA lognormally-distributed random variable $x$ satisfies  \n\n$$\n\\ln E[x]=E[\\ln x]+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}[\\ln x],\n$$  \n\nwhich, applied to $\\hat{w}(p,s)\\equiv E[p^{*}|p,s]$ , yields the proposition.  \n\n#### 3.1.2 Workers? Equilibrium Strategies  \n\nEach worker knows his own ability $a$ . But a worker must choose his level of education $s$ before $\\varepsilon$ and $u$ are realized. When other workers have the strategy profile $S(a)$ , a designated worker's expectation of his wage, conditional on his own $s$ and $a$ , is given by $E_{\\varepsilon,u}[\\hat{w}(p,s)]$ ,where $E_{\\varepsilon,u}$ integrates over $\\varepsilon$ and $u$  \n\nAs a first step in deriving the best response of a worker with characteristics $(s,a)$ to the profile $S(a)$ , we compute the value of $\\ln E_{\\varepsilon,u}[\\hat{w}(p,s)]$ . From (8), (2) and (3), we see that  \n\n$$\n\\ln\\hat{w}(p,s)=\\lambda(s)(q(s,a)+u+\\varepsilon)+(1-\\lambda(s))\\big(\\hat{q}(s)+{.5\\sigma_{e}^{2}}\\big),\n$$  \n\nwhich is a normally distributed random variable with mean  \n\n$$\nE_{\\varepsilon,u}[\\ln\\hat{w}(p,s)]=\\lambda(s)q(s,a)+(1-\\lambda(s))\\big(\\hat{q}(s)+.5\\sigma_{e}^{2}\\big)\n$$  \n\nand variance  \n\n$$\n\\sigma^{2}[\\ln\\hat{w}(p,s)]=\\lambda(s)^{2}\\bigl(\\sigma_{e}^{2}+\\sigma_{u}^{2}(s)\\bigr)=\\lambda(s)\\sigma_{e}^{2}.\n$$  \n\nAgain, from the standard properties of log-normal random variables, we have  \n\n$$\n\\ln E_{\\varepsilon,u}[\\hat{w}(p,s)]=E_{\\varepsilon,u}[\\ln\\hat{w}(p,s)]+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}[\\ln\\hat{w}(p,s)],\n$$  \n\nso that  \n\n$$\n\\ln E_{\\varepsilon,u}[\\hat{w}(p,s)]=\\lambda(s)q(s,a)+\\left(1-\\lambda(s)\\right)\\hat{q}(s)+.5\\sigma_{e}^{2}.\n$$  \n\nThis confrms the intuition that a designated worker's expected wage depends both on his actual ability and the ability level inferred by the employer, which in turn depends on $S(a)$  \n\nWorkers maximize expected discounted net income. Assume that the only cost of education is its opportunity cost in terms of lost income while in school. If $r$ is the worker's discount rate, the expected present value at time $t=0$ of the future income of a worker with characteristics $(s,a)$ is givenby  \n\n$$\nv(s,a)\\equiv\\int_{s}^{\\infty}e^{-r t}E_{\\varepsilon,u}[\\hat{w}(p,s)]d t\\equiv\\frac{1}{r}e^{-r s}E_{\\varepsilon,u}[\\hat{w}(p,s)]\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n\\ln v(s,a)\\equiv-r-r s+\\ln E_{\\varepsilon,u}[\\hat{w}(p,s)].\n$$  \n\nThe first-order condition for maximizing $v(s,a)$ with respect to $s$ is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s}\\ln E_{\\varepsilon,u}[{\\hat{w}}(p,s)]=r.\n$$  \n\nThis restates the well-known proposition that when the only cost of schooling is the student's opportunity cost, the worker will continue to obtain information so long as rate of return to additional education exceeds the discount rate $r$ . We restrict the class of equilibria we consider to those for which (11) has a unique solution.  \n\nWe are now in a position to describe a separating equilibrium of the wage/education game among the class of strategy profles that are “well behaved\"” (continuous, differentiable, monitonically increasing and specify a unique best response for every worker type).  \n\nProposition 3 If the support of worker abilities is the interval $[a_{0},a_{1}]$ , then any well-behaved separating equilibrium $S$ has the property that the education level $S(a_{0})$ of the lowest-type worker must be effcient and not influenced by signaling.  \n\nProof. In an equilibrium with $S(a)$ strictly increasing in $a$ , the employer would infer that a worker with education $S(a_{0})$ has ability $a_{0}$ , the lowest level in the support. If $S(a_{0})$ were inefficiently high, the worker of ability $a_{0}$ could safely deviate to the lower efficient level of education without lowering the employer's inference of his ability, and so raise his payoff. If $S(a_{0})$ were inefficiently low, the worker of ability $a_{0}$ would deviate to $s>S(a_{0})$ even without consideration of the positive payoff from signaling. ■  \n\nWe can now provide a complete description of any well-behaved equilibrium.  \n\nProposition 4 $S u p p o s e[a_{0},a_{1}]$ is the support of worker abilities. If a workers’ equilibrium strategy profile $S(a)$ is well behaved, then its inverse $A(s)$ must satisfy the differential equation  \n\n$$\nq_{s}+\\left(1-\\lambda\\right)q_{a}A^{\\prime}=r.\n$$  \n\nFor $0\\leq\\lambda<1$ , this equation is equivalent to  \n\n$$\nS^{\\prime}={\\frac{\\left(1-\\lambda\\right)q_{a}}{r-q_{s}}}.\n$$  \n\nFor $\\lambda=1$ , the equilibrium condition is given by the solution for s of the equation  \n\n$$\nq_{s}(s,a)=r.\n$$  \n\nThis solution of (14) defines the efficient level of education, which we denote by $S^{*}(a)$ . Furthermore, we have $S(a_{0})=S^{*}(a_{0})$ for any function $\\lambda(s)$ . Therefore each $\\lambda(s)$ corresponds to eractly one wellbehaved equilibrium.  \n\nProof. Substituting (10) into (11) yields the differential equation  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s}\\big(\\lambda(s)q(s,a)+(1-\\lambda(s))\\hat{q}(s)+.5\\sigma_{e}^{2}\\big)=r,\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n'(s)q(s,a)+\\lambda(s)q_{s}(s,a)-\\lambda^{\\prime}(s)\\widehat{q}(s)+(1-\\lambda(s))\\big(q_{s}(s,A(s))+q_{a}(s,A(s))A^{\\prime}(s)\\big)=r.\n$$  \n\nThis equation implicitly defines the best response $s$ of a worker with ability $a$ to the strategy profile $S$ . Consequently, $a=A(s)$ and $q(s,a)={\\hat{q}}(s)$ in equilibrium, and (15) reduces to (12).  \n\nEquation (13) follows from the fact that the derivative of $S$ is the reciprocal of the derivative of $A$ Proposition 3 implies that $S(a_{0})=S^{*}(a_{0})$  \n\nThe left-hand side of equation (12) represents the worker's rate of return to a marginal unit of education, which, given appropriate concavity conditions and the strategy-profile-inverse $A$ ,must beequatedto $r$ . This rate of return arises from the direct and indirect effects of education.  \n\nFirst, consider the direct effect of additional education on the employer's inference of productivity when infered ability is held constant. The direct effect works through two channels. For any given productivity signal $p$ , additional education leads the employer to infer higher productivity, which increases the return to education by $(1-\\lambda)q_{s}$ . But additional education also increases the expected value of the $p$ signal, and the increase in $p$ causes the expected return to education to increase by $\\lambda q_{s}$ . These effects sum to $q_{s}$ , the first term of (12).  \n\nSecond, in equilibrium, an increase in education causes the employer to increase inferred ability. The rate of increase of inferred ability with respect to education is $A^{\\prime}$ , the effect of increased ability on expected log productivity is $q_{a}$ and the weight that the employer puts on this inference (as opposed to his signal) is $1-\\lambda$ . The second term, $(1-\\lambda)q_{a}A^{\\prime}$ , is the product of these effects.  \n\nIn (12), the term $(1-\\lambda)q_{a}A^{\\prime}$ is always nonnegative so that for any equilibrium $S(a)$ , we have $q_{s}(S(a),a)\\subseteq r$ . Because we have assumed that $q_{s s}$ is negative, and because the effcient level of education $S^{*}(a)$ is defined by $q_{s}(S^{*}(a),a)=r$ , the following proposition holds:  \n\nProposition5 Let $S(a)$ describe any separating equilibrium of the workers’ signaling game. Then for all $a\\in[a_{0},a_{1}]$ $S(a)\\geq S^{*}(a)$  \n\nBecause an equilibrium strategy profile satisfies $q_{s}(s,a)=r$ whenever $\\lambda(s)=1$ (seProposition 4), and because that equation characterizes full-information level of education, we have:  \n\nProposition 6 Let $s^{*}$ be the lowest value of s such that $\\lambda(s)=1$ for all $s\\geq s^{*}$ , and let $\\boldsymbol a^{*}=A(\\boldsymbol s^{*})$ Then for $a\\ge a^{*}$ ， $S(a)$ is the same as in the case where information about productivity is perfect at all levels of education.  \n\n#### 3.1.3 Example: Ability as the capacity to be educated  \n\nWe now analyze a special case of this model in which ability is viewed as the capacity to be educated. Let productivity $p^{*}$ be givenby  \n\n$$\np^{*}=\\operatorname*{min}\\{s,a\\}\\hat{\\varepsilon},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\hat{\\boldsymbol\\varepsilon}=\\exp(\\varepsilon)$ is a lognormal random variable. This yields a special case of (2) in which $q(s,a)$ isdefined by  \n\n$$\nq(s,a)=\\operatorname*{min}\\{\\ln s,\\ln a\\}.\n$$  \n\nIn this example, additional education is productive only when $s<a$ .But when $s<a$ , additional ability is not productive, so that the worker has no incentive to use additional education to signal ability.When $s>a$ , additional ability is productive but additional education is not, so if the  \n\nworker obtains additional education, signaling can be his only purpose. Therefore, in this example, we have decoupled the productivity and signaling effects of added education.  \n\n![](images/a0442c0a2aae5e5107a86a8f43e90ac6b7535d58dc5a51d11463a28df6c07049.jpg)  \nFigure 1.  \n\nWe now find the efficient level of education in this framework. From (16) we have  \n\n$$\nq_{s}(s,a)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c c c}{{1/s}}&{{\\mathrm{for}}}&{{s<a}}\\ {{0}}&{{\\mathrm{for}}}&{{s>a}}\\end{array}\\right.,\n$$  \n\nwhich defines the social rate of return to education. Additional education is efficient so long as $q_{s}(s,a)>r$ . This means that the efficient level is given by  \n\n$$\nS^{*}(a)=\\operatorname*{min}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{r},a\\right\\}.\n$$  \n\nThis is the equilibrium level of education when information is perfect ( $\\lambda=1$ 一  \n\nFor $\\lambda(s)<1$ and $s>a$ , equation (13) yields the equilibrium condition  \n\n$$\nS^{\\prime}(a)=\\frac{1-\\lambda(s)}{r}\\frac{1}{a}.\n$$  \n\nLet $\\tilde{S}(a)$ be a solution of (18) From (17) we see that the efficient level of education $S^{*}(a)$ increases along the 45-degree line until $s=16$ and is constant at 16 thereafter. From Proposition 5, it follows that for $a\\leq16$ ， $S(a)=\\tilde{S}(a)$ whenever $\\tilde{S}(a)>a$ and $S(a)=a$ otherwise.  \n\nFor Figure 1 we specify $r=.0625$ $1/r=16$ ), and we normalize $a$ So that the lowest level of ability is given by $a_{0}=1$ .

This is graphed in Figure 2 for $b=14$ . Note that $S(a)$ becomes equal to $S^{*}(a)$ before $s=14$ when perfect information is obtained.  \n\n#### 3.2  Statistical Discrimination  \n\nWe are now in a position to model statistical discrimination. The literature on statistical discrimination suggests that firms observe the productivity of blacks less accurately than that of whites. This is almost a convention in the literature, but it can be justified on the grounds that blacks have poorer networks than do otherwise comparable whites or on the basis of language differences. Considerable research shows that blacks and whites use different nonverbal listening and speaking cues and that this can lead to miscommunication (Lang, 1986).  \n\nGiven that firms can observe the race of applicants, differences in the accuracy of productivity observations induce firms to put a relatively higher weight on education and a lower weight on observed productivity for black workers as compared with white workers. Therefore, education is a more valuable signal of ability for blacks than it is for whites, which leads us to expect blacks to obtain more education than whites of equal ability. This means that at any level of education, blacks will be of lower ability and have lower wages. However, at any level of ability, since blacks get more education, they should have higher wages if we do not hold education constant. We derive these results formally below.  \n\nLet the subscript $b$ denote black workers and $w$ white workers. If black productivity is observed less accurately than white productivity for $s~<~s^{*}$ ，then $\\lambda_{b}(s)<\\lambda_{w}(s)$ there.The following proposition shows that under these circumstances, blacks will get more education than whites of equal ability for all intermediate ability levels.  \n\nProposition 7 Given $\\lambda_{b}(s)<\\lambda_{w}(s)$ for all $s<s^{*}$ , we have $S_{b}(a)>S_{w}(a)$ for all $a\\in(a_{0},a^{*})$ in equilibrium.  \n\nProof. $>$ From (13) we know that for $\\lambda_{i}(s)<1$ , the equilibrium $S_{b}$ and $S_{w}$ are characterized by  \n\n$$\nS_{i}^{\\prime}(a)=\\frac{\\left(1-\\lambda_{i}(s)\\right)q_{a}(s,a)}{r-q_{s}(s,a)},\n$$  \n\nwhere $i$ is either $b$ or $w$ . If for $s<s^{*}$ blacks and whites have the same values of $a$ and $s$ , then from $\\lambda_{b}(s)<\\lambda_{w}(s)$ we know that $S_{b}^{\\prime}(a)>S_{w}^{\\prime}(a)$ . By the continuity of $S_{b}$ and $S_{w}$ and the fact that $S_{b}(a_{0})=S_{w}(a_{0})$ , we can infer that $S_{b}(a)>S_{w}(a)$ in a neighborhood of $a_{0}$ . If $\\hat{a}$ is the smallest value of $a$ greater $a_{0}$ at which $S_{b}(a)=S_{w}(a)$ , it must be true that $S_{b}^{\\prime}(\\hat{a})\\leq S_{w}^{\\prime}(\\hat{a})$ , because $S_{b}(a)$ is converging to $S_{w}(a)$ from above. But by (20), this is possible only if $\\lambda_{b}(s)=\\lambda_{w}(s)$ , which implies that $\\hat{a}=a^{*}$ . The proposition follows. ■  \n\nWe can now show that at any education level (except the lowest) at which black productivity is observed less accurately than white productivity, the expected equilibrium earnings of blacks is less than that of whites with the same level of education.  \n\nProposition 8 In equilibrium, for $s\\in(s_{0},s^{*})$ $E_{\\varepsilon,u}[\\hat{w}_{b}(p,s)]<E_{\\varepsilon,u}[\\hat{w}_{w}(p,s)].$  \n\nProof. Equation (10) implies that in equilibrium we have  \n\n$$\n\\ln E_{\\varepsilon,u}[\\hat{w}_{i}(p,s)]=\\lambda_{i}(s)q(s,A_{i}(s))+\\left(1-\\lambda_{i}(s)\\right)\\hat{q}_{i}(s)+.5\\sigma_{e}^{2},\n$$  \n\nwhich reduces to  \n\n$$\n\\ln E_{\\varepsilon,u}[\\hat{w}_{i}(p,s)]=\\hat{q}_{i}(s)+.5\\sigma_{e}^{2},\n$$  \n\nbecause $\\hat{q}_{i}(s)\\equiv q(s,A_{i}(s))$ . From the previous proposition, we know that ${\\hat{q}}_{b}(s)<{\\hat{q}}_{w}(s)$ for $s\\in$ $(s_{0},s^{*})$ and the theorem follows.  \n\n#### 3.3  Empirical Implications of the Model  \n\nLet us suppose that the productivity of black workers with low and intermediate levels of education and ability cannot be observed as accurately as the productivity of white workers with the same levels education and ability, whereas observations of the productivity of workers with high levels of education and ability are equally accurate for both races.  \n\nThe primary implication of our model is that under these circumstances, black workers with low or intermediate levels of ability will obtain more education than their white counterparts, but black workers of high ability will obtain the same levels of educations as high-ability whites.  \n\nThe model also has implications about the measured return to education. If we measure the return to education by comparing wages at an intermediate level of education with wages at the lowest level of education, our model predicts that the measured return to education should be lower for blacks than for whites. However, if we measure the return to education by comparing wages at an intermediate education level with wages at high levels of education, the measured return to education should be higher for blacks than it is for whites. This suggests that as the level of education increases, the measured return to education, not controlling for ability, should initially be lower for blacks than for whites and then become higher for blacks than for whites. Of course, this conclusion refers to the measured return. The actual private return to education is the common interest rate, $r$ , for all workers.  \n\nSince, relative to whites with the same ability, blacks with intermediate levels of ability get more education, our model predicts that at these ability levels, blacks should earn more than whites do. At low and high ability levels, blacks and whites should have similar earnings. Put differently, the return to ability (not controling for education) should be higher for blacks than for whites at relatively low levels of ability and lower for blacks than for whites at somewhat higher ability levels.  \n\nWe note that the “ability to learn\"” example above demonstrates that our results apply more generally than simply to the case in which there is no asymmetric information beyond some level of education. In the case graphed in Figure 1, with imperfect information, the wage paid to workers with a given level of education is lower than it is with perfect information whenever the two education levels diverge. Relative to the case of perfect information, with imperfect information, the estimated return to education would be lower at low levels of education and higher at high levels of education.  \n\n### 4 Evidence  \n\nWe begin with the prediction about the relation between educational attainment and ability. We have already seen that conditional on AFQT, blacks get more education relative to whites. Our model suggests that this should be true at intermediate levels of ability but not at very low or very high levels of ability.  \n\nTable 4 shows the relation between education and AFQT, separately for men and women. Within each sex the younger cohorts, who had not completed school at the time that they took the AFQT, are shown separately, both with and without a control for their completed education at the time they took the test. In every specification, the interaction of race and the AFQT-squared term has its predicted negative sign. This is true for Hispanics as well as for blacks.  \n\nAlthough the individual interaction terms are generally not statistically significant when we limit the sample to the younger cohorts, in no case are the differences between the young and older cohorts in the three black interaction terms, the three Hispanic interaction terms or the six interaction terms statistically significant.4 Thus the results are not driven by the causal impact of education on AFQT.  \n\nFor men, the black-white education differential is maximized at an AFQT about one-sixth standard deviation below the mean where it is about 1.3 years. Educational attainment is equal for blacks and whites at almost two standard deviations below the mean and at one and twothirds standard deviations above the mean. For women, the black-white education differential is maximized just about at the mean AFQT where it is about 1.4 years. The education levels of blacks and whites are estimated to be equalized pretty much at the extremes of the AFQT distribution.  \n\nFigure 3 shows the smoothed relation between education and AFQT for men. The nonparametric approach (which ignores the relation between age and education) confirms the parametric approach. Education levels for blacks and whites converge around a standardized AFQT of -2 and a little above 1.5. Figure 4, for women, is less consistent with the parametric estimates. It shows that education levels converge at a standardized AFQT between -2 and -2.5. However, education levels for black women remain higher than for white women even at very high AFQT levels. One potential explanation for this difference is the very high rate of labor force participation of high-skill black women relative to white women discussed in Neal (2004).  \n\nBecause of the complications associated with differences in the selection of black and white women into the labor force, our discussion of the wage predictions is restricted to men. Our model implies that the wages of blacks and whites will be similar at low levels of education and at high levels but that blacks will have lower wages at intermediate levels of education. To test this prediction, we regress the log wage on education and its square and interactions with race and ethnicity as well as direct effects of age, race and ethnicity. Table 5 shows the results. As predicted, the return to education is initially lower for blacks than for whites and then turns more positive. Wages for blacks and whites are estimated to be equal for those with a fifth grade education and those with nineteen years of completed education although these points of equality are imprecisely estimated. The results of the comparison of Hispanics with white non-Hispanics are similar. If we control for school quality, the coefficients (not shown) are similar but more imprecisely estimated. With either set of school quality measures, wages for blacks and whites converge at nineteen years of education and at either six or seven years of education.  \n\n![](images/c56ad9e500fcf3f3a5cf1bc3892a99bde0bce631d3ce59dc6d049e79e1444ecb.jpg)  \nFigure 3. Education and AFQT by Race: Men  \n\nFigure 5 shows this nonparametrically. It plots average wages (on a log scale) for men by education and race. There are very few individuals without any high school education and very few blacks with more than eighteen years of education. The estimates suggest that, as predicted by the model, wages are very similar for blacks and whites at low and high levels of education  \n\nTo the extent that AFQT is a good proxy for ability, the one prediction of our model that does not hold is that blacks should receive higher wages than whites with the same ability except at very low and very high levels of ability. Like NJ we find that conditional on AFQT, blacks earn less than whites although the difference is generally small and often insignificant depending on the specification.5  \n\n![](images/e7ff1bdab9e6b9dbcc37fff0388f34d50b7f59d95a8d9b7e1e72776fa93ec785.jpg)  \nFigure 4. Education and AFQT by Race: Women  \n\n### 5 Neal and Johnson Revisited  \n\nTable 6 replicates the results in NJ with our data. Many of the results can be anticipated on the basis of our discussion so far, but we believe it is helpful to present them in the same form as in the original NJ paper. In order to ensure that the AFQT score is not affected by labor market experience, NJ limited their sample to younger cohorts who would, for the most part, still have been in school when they took the AFQT. The first panel of table 1 limits the sample in the same way. In the absence of any controls (row 1), there are large differences in the average log wages of blacks, Hispanics and whites. In fact, the differences reported here are somewhat larger than those reported in NJ.6  \n\nThe second row shows the effect of controlling for years of education completed, this reduces both the black-white and Hispanic-white wage differentials. However, the differentials remain significant. The third row adds AFQT instead of education.7 This produces a very substantial reduction in the estimated black-white wage differential and turns the Hispanic-white wage differential insignificant.  \n\nRow (3) is the basic result in NJ. Since all the variables in this row were determined before individuals entered the labor market, this result seems to create a strong prima facie case that the black-white wage differential is largely due to premarket factors that lower the AFQT of blacks relative to whites.  \n\n![](images/82d84d6d620c2c559fd7292c8e0b6c933d9579b4df56390ded3e4150494c3d2a.jpg)  \nFigure 5. Education and Wages by Race: Men  \n\nRow (4) presents the principal result of this paper. If we control for AFQT and education, the black-white wage differential increases again. The $15\\%$ wage differential implied by row (4) is both statistically and socially significant. The Hispanic-white differential remains small and insignificant. Put differently, after controlling for education, accounting for AFQT differences explains slightly less than half of the black-white wage differential While the premarket factors captured by AFQT are an important component of the black-white wage differential, there remains a substantial diferential that could be attributable to labor market discrimination.  \n\nThe difference between rows (3) and (4) is a simple application of the omitted variables bias formula since we have established that blacks get about one year more education than do whites with the same AFQT. Yet blacks earn about the same as whites with the same AFQT. Blacks do not appear to be rewarded for their additional year of education relative to whites, or, equivalently, must spend an extra year in school to attain the same level of compensation.8  \n\nRestricting the sample to the younger cohorts substantially reduces the number of observations. The middle panel in table 6 explores what happens when we remove this restriction. There are few substantive differences between the top and middle panel It remains true that controlling for education significantly reduces the Hispanic-white differential but leaves a substantial black-white differential. Controlling for AFQT alone, reduces or eliminates both differentials. Controlling for both variables simultaneously eliminates the Hispanic-white differential but leaves a black-white wage differential equal to roughly half that observed when we control for education and not AFQT. Because the results are unaffected by cohort restriction, for the remainder of this paper, we focus On the full sample.  \n\nThe bottom panel of table 6 addresses the problem of nonparticipation. We treat nonparticipants as having a low wage and estimate the wage equation by least absolute deviations. Not surprisingly since nonparticipation is greater among blacks than among whites, this increases the estimated black-white wage differential. However, in the final specification, the effect is modest. Controlling for both educational attainment and AFQT, we find a residual black-white wage differential of about 16% or again about half of the differential that remains when we control only for education.  \n\nIf, as is generally accepted among labor economists, education is rewarded in the labor market, then in the absence of labor market discrimination, blacks should earn more than whites with the same AFQT. Given the education differential, the absence of a wage differential favoring blacks when we control only for AFQT suggests that blacks are not rewarded fully for their skills.  \n\nAlthough NJ explore the effect of also controlling for education to some extent, they explicitly reject including education in their main estimating equation. They provide two arguments for their position. First, they maintain that we should examine black-white wage differentials without conditioning on education because education is endogenous. Their argument would be much more compelling if blacks obtained less education than equivalent whites. In that case, we might argue that blacks get less education because they expect to face discrimination in the labor market, and therefore controlling for education understates the importance of discrimination.  \n\nHowever, if blacks obtain more education because they anticipate labor market discrimination as we argue in this paper, failing to control for education understates the impact of discrimination. Consider the following example. Suppose that the market discriminates against blacks by paying them exactly what it would pay otherwise equivalent whites with exactly one less year of education. Then, to a first approximation,9 all blacks will get one year more education than otherwise equivalent whites. Controlling only for ability, we find that blacks and whites will have the same earnings, but controlling for education as well as ability, we see that blacks earn less than whites by an amount equal to the return to one year of education.  \n\nNote that even if the higher educational attainment among blacks refects premarket factors, it may still be appropriate to control for education when measuring discrimination in the labor market. After all, we would still anticipate that the labor market would compensate blacks for their additional education regardless of their reason for getting more education.  \n\nThe second argument that NJ make is that education is a poor proxy for skills. In particular.  \n\non average, blacks attend lower quality schools than do whites. Whites will have more effective education than do blacks with the same nominal years of completed education. We have already noted that students who attend lower quality schools tend to get less education. Therefore if blacks attend lower quality schools, for any given level of education, they will have higher unmeasured ability. Differential school quality could lead to a spurious positive or negative coefficient on race.  \n\nWe address this question directly in table 7 by controlling for measures of school quality in the wage equation. Most of the coefficients have the anticipated sign. Holding other resources constant, larger schools are associated with lower wages. Holding enrollment constant, having more guidance counsellors, more teachers and more library books are associated with higher wages. Having more educated teachers and higher paid teachers is associated with higher student earnings while teacher turnover has a negative effect.  \n\nYet, controlling for inputs indicates that there is almost no effect on the measured black-white wage differential. The difference between the coefficients with and without school quality controls reflects differences in the sample rather than the effect of adding the controls. The coefficient on black using the observations for which we have school input measures is -0.14. At least as measured by inputs, differences in school quality do not account for the black-white wage differential.  \n\nThe right-side of table 7 controls for measures of student composition and behavior. Perhaps surprisingly, this effort is in some ways less successful than the estimation using school inputs. While higher fractions of disadvantaged students and dropouts are associated with lower wages, average absenteeism and the fraction of students who are black are not. The results are again quite similar to those obtained without controls for school quality.  \n\nThus we find no evidence that the wage and education differentials are driven by differences in school quality. It is important to note that the absence of evidence for the role of these premarket factors does not depend on a causal interpretation of the relation between education quality and outcomes. It is entirely possible that attending a school with a higher dropout rate does not make any individual more likely to dropout. Students who attend schools with high dropout rates may have characteristics that make them more likely to dropout. Even if the dropout rate were merely a proxy for these unmeasured characteristics, we would expect including the dropout rate to lower the black-white education differential. The fact that it does not, supports the view that such premarket differences do not explain the wage and education differentials.  \n\nWe have reproduced all of the estimates in the tables adding controls for father's and mother's education and number of siblings. Although in many cases the parameter estimates are more imprecise, the principal results are unchanged. The major effect of adding these controls is that the estimated black-white wage differential typically falls by about three percentage points and falls short of significance in the specifications controlling for AFQT but not education. However, it is not obvious how to interpret specification which control for these factors, and since controlling for them does not change the substance of the results, we focus on the estimates without these additional controls.  \n\n### 6 Discussion and Conclusion  \n\nWhile some of the principal predictions of the theory we presented are consistent with the data, it is important to recognize that the combination of statistical discrimination and educational sorting that we discuss cannot fully explain the data. Our model implies that, conditional on ability, relative to whites, blacks get more education. This, in turn, implies that conditional on AFQT, blacks should earn more than whites. But neither our results nor those of Neal and Johnson support that conclusion for men.  \n\nOne potential explanation is that education is a pure signal at the margin. This is the case in our “ability to learn\" example. In that example, while education is productive up to some point that depends on the worker's ability, it is unproductive beyond that point. In order to signal their ability, most workers invest in education beyond the point at which it increases their productivity. However, we view this model as extreme.  \n\nOur model and the supporting empirical evidence identifies statistical discrimination as one source of differences in outcomes for blacks and whites. Altonji and Pierret (2001) also provide evidence of its importance. We have focused our attention on only one effect, increased investment in the observed signal. Blacks may also invest less in unobservable skills as in Lundberg and Startz which would lead to them have lower wages even conditional on AFQT. In addition, the work of Bertrand et al (2004) on names and job applications suggests to us that statistical discrimination is of particular importance in the presence of search frictions. They find that applicants with African American names are less likely to receive calls for interviews than are similar applicants with names common among whites. If evaluating workers is costly, statistical discrimination may prevent large numbers of African American workers from consideration for many jobs. We expect that in this setting our principal results would hold: African Americans would have greater incentives to signal their productivity and would earn less conditional on their education. However, it is also likely that they would earn less conditional on their ability.  \n\nThus the results in this paper cast doubt on an emerging consensus that the origins of the blackwhite wage differential lie in premarket rather than labor market factors. Blacks earn noticeably less than whites with the same education and cognitive score. The evidence is not consistent with the view that the unexplained differential reflects differences in school quality, the principal premarket explanation. Thus, there are good grounds for believing that at least some of the black-white wage differential reflects differential treatment in the labor market.  \n\n### References  \n\nAigner, Dennis, and Cain, Glen, “Statistical Theories of Discrimination in Labor Markets,” Industrial and Labor Relations Review, 30 (1977): 175-87.   \nAltonji, Joseph G. and Pierret, Charles R., “Employer Learning and Statistical Discrimination, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 116 (February 2001): 313-50.  \n\nBertrand, Marianne and Mullainathan, Sendhil, “Are Emily and Brendan More Employable than Lakisha and Jamal?

Executive summary  \n\nPeople are the key to organization competitiveness and the quality of core human resources in a firm impacts organizational growth and well-being. Understanding how organizations can acquire the right type of talents is therefore of prominent interest to organizational scholars and practitioners alike, which is why the notion of “fit’ is a dominant theme in human resource literature. Yet what is “fit' is under constant debate. Integrating and extending extant literature on HRM and entrepreneurship, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional, multi-contingent fit model in examining how the practices adapted by entrepreneurial firms in acquiring their core talents may change during different developmental phases of the firm. The general proposition is that entrepreneurial firms adapt different network strategies in acquiring their core human resources at different stages due to multiple considerations of fit.  \n\nThe overarching theoretical framework of our model is based on the “system approach\" of contingency theory, stressing the interactions among multiple contingencies and structural characteristics in the organization system. Due to the lack of internal resources, including a well-structured HR system, entrepreneurial firms may not have the luxury of choosing a “buy” or “make” employment mode in accordance with their business strategies, as suggested in the mainstream HRM literature. Saddled with the liabilities of newness and smallness, the more relevant questions to entrepreneurial firms are “what to buy” and “how to buy\", taking into account their needs and constraints.  \n\nThrough examining how environmental constraints, strategic needs and interpersonal dynamics in entrepreneurial firms interact during different developmental phases, our study highlights some unique features in human resource acquisition in those firms. While recruitment through networks seems to be the predominant practice, the type of networks entrepreneurs tap in to acquire their core talents vary from a mixed pattern during the startup phase to an overwhelming reliance on business networks during the growth phase. Yet the use of strong ties in acquiring talents persisted during both phases. Our analysis of the contingents indicated that the change in the network pattern may be attributed to the need for different types of talents due to the changing environmental conditions and strategic needs of the firm; whereas the stability in tie strength may reflect the persistent emphasis on value and goal congruence when entrepreneurs choose their core team members.  \n\nOur findings carry important implications for future research in human resource management by integrating inter-personal, strategic and environmental considerations into the “fit’ picture, thus bridging the invisible barrier between macro- and micro-HRM research. Our examination of the recruitment practices through networks, and how they change over time, enhances the understanding of network effects and their strategic bearings in the entrepreneurial process, specifically in the acquisition of human resources. Understanding the various factors affecting the “fit’ dynamics of organizational practices may help entrepreneurs and managers in formulating strategies and making decisions in human resource acquisition.  \n\n## 2. Introduction  \n\nLiterature on human resource practices in entrepreneurial firms is still relatively underdeveloped (Baron, 2003; Katz and Welbourne, 2002). This is unfortunate considering the significant contribution entrepreneurial firms make to our economy, and the importance of human resource in determining those firms’ success or failure (Katz et al., 20o0; Katz and Welbourne, 2002). Due to generally sparse human resource practices, recruitment and selection are considered as prominent HR functions (Hornsby and Kuratko, 1990) and the key components of overall effective management of a firm's human resources in entrepreneurial firms (Cardon, 2003). While several studies have examined recruiting and staffing issues in entrepreneurial firms (see Cardon and Stevens, 2004 for a comprehensive review), little has been done to examine the “fit' between the hiring practices and the changing contextual factors of the firm over different developmental stages (Heneman et al.,2000; Leung,2003).  \n\nAddressing the research gap, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional, multi-contingent fit model in examining how changing contextual factors during different developmental phases of the firm may lead to changes of practices in acquiring core talents. Our overarching theoretical framework is the “system approach\" of contingency theory which stresses the interactions among multiple contingencies and structural characteristics in the organization (Drazin and Van de Ven, 1985; Van de Ven and Drazin, 1985). Since we are venturing into a relatively unexplored field, the nature of this study is exploratory, focusing more on building a new theoretical perspective than on theory testing. Instead of trying to find additional evidence of the well-debated theme of \"fit’ and performance, we try to bring out the various factors organizations have to consider in trying to acquire talents with the right “fit'.  \n\n## 3. Theoretical background and proposed conceptual framework  \n\n### 3.1.Extant“fit’literatureinHRMresearch  \n\nThe most frequently applied theory in the human resource literature addressing the \"fit’ issue in talent acquisition is the person-environment (P-E) fit (or P-O fit when applied to organizations) theory. The P-O fit framework argues that organizational behavior and effectiveness are ultimately a joint function of characteristics of the organizational environment and the individual (Kristof, 1996; Schneider et al., 2001). Empirical research for over a decade has provided strong support for the positive effects of P-O fit on individual work attitudes such as job satisfaction, organizational commitment, organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), task performance and turnover; and individual well-being (Schneider et al., 2001). Such findings are mainly based on bivariate or highly circumscribed multivariate relationships. For example, Chatman and colleagues focus on value and goal congruence in predicting job satisfaction and organizational commitment of individuals (Chatman, 1991; O'Reilly et al., 1991). Using the same measurements, Vandenberghe (1999) suggests that the congruence of individual values with organizational culture predicts turnover. However, in most of the P-O fit literature, the organizational context is very often represented by a set of static organizational characteristics for individuals to fit in, rather than dynamic factors which change with time. Organizational dynamics such as changes in institutional environment and strategic needs over time are rarely taken into consideration (Schneider et al., 1997; Schneider,2001).  \n\nStrategic human resource management (SHRM) literature, on the other hand, focuses almost exclusively on how human resource practices can “fit’ organizational strategies in generating the necessary human capital pool to sustain superior performance (Barney and Wreight, 1998; Wright et al., 2001). The key argument under this stream of literature is that a “fit' between strategy and HRM system of the organization will result in sustainable competitive advantage based on its unique human capital, thus resulting in superior organizational performance. The “make\" or “buy” employment modes are mapped with different types of organizational strategies based on Miles and Snow's typologies, from prospectors to defenders (Miles and Snow, 1978, 1984). “Make\" oriented organizations primarily hire at entry level, and develop employees within the internal labor market, while “buy” oriented organizations acquire needed skills from the open market (Delery and Doty, 1996; Heneman et al., 1994). Amidst the contradictory empirical findings of the type of strategy to map with each employment mode, Lepak and Snell (1999, 2002) proposed that there can be multiple employment modes within the same organization, depending on the type of employees and their roles in the organization. However, both the strategy-practice fit and the human capital-practice fit approaches argue at a broad conceptual level that a certain set of HR practices will suit a specific strategic orientation of the firm. How organizations may have to take into consideration factors other than competitive strategies in formulating their HR practices isseldomtouched.  \n\n### 3.2. Unique challenges on human resource acquisition for entrepreneurial firms  \n\nDefined as young, small, and growing (Baker and Aldrich, 2000; Markman and Baron, 2002), entrepreneurial firms in general are saddled with the “liabilities of newness and smallness\" (Aldrich and Auster, 1986; Ranger-Moore, 1997; Stinchcombe, 1965). They may not have the abundant resources at their disposal as in large, established firms. The organizational practices they adapt are more often than not the result of “improvisation\" (Baker and Aldrich, 20oo) and “effectuation\" (Sarasvathy, 2001). Instead of having the choice of various means to achieve a specific goal, entrepreneurial firms usually have to “make do\" with the limited resources they have in hand to attain the best outcomes they can get (Sarasvathy, 2001). With regard to hiring practices, the mainstream “make\" or “buy” option in the HRM literature may not be applicable to these firms. Since entrepreneurial firms, in general, do not have the HRM system and the organizational resources to provide internal training and career development (Katz et al., 2000), adapting the “internal system\" of staffing is seldom an option. The “market system\" is deemed to be more appropriate (Cardon, 2003; Delery and Doty, 1996; Heneman and Tansky, 2002). However, recruiting “strangers” from the market is an enormous challenge to entrepreneurial firms with their highly uncertain future, and a general lack of resources and organizational reputation (Williamson, 2000; Williamson et al., 2002). Entrepreneurial firms may have to enact unique strategies and practices to overcome such environmental constraints (Williamson et al., 2002). Therefore, in considering the overall “fit’ picture in human resources acquisition in entrepreneurial firms, we need to incorporate these environmental contingents into the equation.  \n\n### 3.3. Towards a “system approach” of fit  \n\nEach stream of the literature reviewed above represents one dimension of fit consideration in the process of human resource acquisition: how different individual characteristics may fit into different organizational settings (P-O fit); how different business strategies may need different HRM systems (strategic fit); and how different HRM practices may be an outcome of the environmental constraints firms face (environmental fit). While each stream of the extant literature provides a unique angle for our understanding of the rationales for a specific set of human resource practices, a holistic integration of such dimensions is yet to be developed.  \n\nUnderlying the contingency approach is the proposition that performance is a consequence of the “fit', or congruence, between several factors: structure, people, technology, strategy, and culture (Nightingale and Toulouse, 1977; Tosi and Slocum, 1984; Van de Ven and Drazin, 1985); although the traditional contingency approach applied in strategic management, organizational theory and organizational behavior studies rarely examine “fit' at such a “system\" level (Drazin and Van de Ven, 1985). However, the “system approach\" of contingency theory is arguably a more realistic representation of organizational reality (Drazin and Van de Ven, 1985; Miller, 1981). Under this approach, fit is defined as “the internal consistency of multiple contingencies and multiple structural characteristics” (Drazin and Van de Ven, 1985, p. 515). Such an approach advocates the simultaneous consideration of the interaction among environmental, strategic and people variables within a certain structure (Miller, 1981; Van de Ven and Drazin, 1985).  \n\nAdapting the “system approach\", we propose a multi-dimensional, multi-contingent model of “fit' to examine why recruitment through networks (RTN) becomes the most commonly adapted practice among entrepreneurial firms. Our model suggests that environmental, strategic and inter-personal considerations all play a part in influencing the hiring practices for core talents in entrepreneurial firms. The contingents in these multiple dimensions change as firms evolve from their startup to their growth phase. As a result, although firms may persistently rely on network ties to recruit talents, the network ties utilized may vary with changing organizational context represented by the two different developmental phases. In this study, the startup phase is defined as the inception and survival stages of the firm, and the transition to the growth phase is signified by the emergence of a clear growth strategy, followed by consecutive years of rapid growth (Churchill and Lewis, 1983; Hanks et al., 1993; Hite and Hesterly, 2001). Fig. 1 summarizes our conceptual framework.  \n\n3.3.1. Environmental fit —hiring practice as a response to environmental constraints Liabilities of newness and smallness are generally quoted as the main constraining factors for entrepreneurial firms to compete in the talent market (Cardon and Stevens, 2004; Williamson, 2000; Williamson et al., 2002). Such liabilities are manifested in the lack of financial and material resources (Hannan and Freeman, 1984), the lack of organizational legitimacy (Williamson, 2000) and a high level of uncertainty (Gartner et al., 1992). The lack of financial resources may hamper entrepreneurial firms' ability to offer attractive remuneration packages. Resource constraints also cause them to shy away from investment-intensive methods such as college recruitment (Barber et al., 1999). Unlike established firms, entrepreneurial firms often cannot rely on their name, their reputation, or their market share to attract talents (Aldrich, 1999). The HR function is also limited in smaller firms. In addition to their other roles, owners or line management have to recruit staff and they are less likely to employ sophisticated recruitment and selection programs (Barber et al., 1999; Heneman and Berkley, 1999). The deviation from institutionalized recruitment practices, together with the general absence of well-defined job descriptions for positions, reduce entrepreneurial firms’ legitimacy as employers-of-choice (Williamson, 2000). From the potential recruit's perspective, committing one's career to a relatively young and small firm can be a high-risk undertaking due to the relatively high mortality rate of firms at their early and adolescence stages (Bruderl and Schussler, 1990; Hannan and Freeman, 1989).  \n\n![](images/12f555331157dd2cb10c1215d6b0363daf7af49fae5d004d46e74b09129faff8.jpg)  \nFig. 1. A multi-dimensional framework of fit considerations in hiring.  \n\nProposition 1a.Liabilities of newness and smallness are the key environmentai constraints faced by entrepreneurial firms in human resource acquisition.  \n\nExtant literature on staffing practices in entrepreneurial firms suggests that informal recruitment practices through networks generally prevail in such firms (Aldrich, 1999; Aldrich and Langton, 1997; Barber et al., 1999). RTN provide a “convenient and inexpensive” way of acquiring talents (Barber et al., 1999). Network recruitment may also help to address the issue of organizational legitimacy. Through networks, potential employees can obtain private information on the firm (Shane and Cable, 2002), thus becoming more open to consider joining the firm. Similarly, individuals with existing ties to entrepreneurs are more likely than strangers to join ventures operating in highly uncertain conditions (Hite and Hesterly, 2001; Uzzi, 1996). More importantly, in the absence of sophisticated selection processes, using networks in recruitment and selection will help achieve better “fit\", be it personality, ability or attitude (Brass, 1995, p. 52 and 62-63). Therefore, we can see the pragmatic as well as strategic rationales in entrepreneurial firms adapting recruitment practices through networks.  \n\nAs entrepreneurial firms transit from the startup phase to the growth phase, however, we can expect an improvement in resource availability as their businesses grew to a sustainable size. The establishment of a certain track record also improves their organizational legitimacy. At this stage, there should also be a reduction in the degree of uncertainty since the firms have moved beyond survival to growth (Hite and Hesterly, 2001). Such improvements, together with the need for expanding the core team to cope with the growth pace, may ster entrepreneurial firms to turn more to the market for talents (Cardon, 2003; Williamson, 2000), reducing the reliance on RTN.  \n\nProposition 1b. Recruitment through networks is the predominant practice in acquiring human resource in entrepreneurial firms, although the extent of its predominance will decreaseduringthegrowthphase.  \n\n#### 3.3.2. Strategic fit — meeting strategic needs through hiring practices  \n\nDuring the startup phase, organizational structure is relatively simple, and the owner/ manager is synonymous with the business, with highly centralized decision-making authority. The focus of the firm at this phase is to turn identified opportunities into viable business, and to survive with limited resources. Fast decision making and actions are imperative. Schneider et al. (1997), quoting from Miller's work (1991) suggested that homogeneity in the management team at this early phase can bring about the cohesiveness and cooperation required to achieve those short-term goals. In their study of new venture teams, Chandler and Hanks (1998) also found that shared background and interests, rather than functional diversity, tend to be the predominant selection criteria for team members at this stage.  \n\nAs the firm transits to the growth phase, its strategic focus shifts from short term survival to longer term growth and sustainability. As business size grows, and business demands become more intense and diversified, entrepreneurs need to decide what tasks they focus on to bring about maximum benefits for the organization, and delegate other roles (Johnson and Bishop, 2002). Gradually, as the organizational structure shifts from an owner-run firm to professional management with increased specialization, diversity of skills becomes necessary (Churchill and Lewis, 1983; Hanks et al., 1993). Chandler and Hanks (1998) found that the development of distinctive functional area competencies by team members is associated with sales growth performance as firms go beyond their founding years.  Management  heterogeneity  facilitates  growth  and organizational transition, in that it increases the knowledge and perspectives available to the core team, enabling the team to go into issues more deeply and develop a more complete understanding of problems, and develop alternative solutions to these problems (Foo et al., 2005; Pelled et al., 1999). Debates among team members based on their different perspectives lead to increased decision comprehensiveness, and are particularly important in situations characterized by change and uncertainty (Eisenhardt, 1989b; Simons et al., 1999).  \n\nProposition 2a. Contingent on the strategic needs of the firm, entrepreneurs stress background similarity during the startup phase and functional diversity during the growth phaseinacquiringtheircoreteammembers.  \n\nPersonal social networks, in general, comprise families, kin, friends and other affiliations through various social interactions (Dubini and Aldrich, 1991). Apart from family members, individuals are also more likely to affiliate themselves and share similar values with people from similar socioeconomic backgrounds (Aldrich, 1999; Schneider et al., 1998). Therefore, a focus on background similarity may be achieved through hiring from the personal social networks of the entrepreneurs. To tap into more diverse talents during the growth phase, however, entrepreneurs may need to reach beyond their own social circles (Aldrich, 1999) and seek people who are dissimilar to themselves. Business networks established during the process of building up the firm, be that with suppliers, customers or service providers, form a rich pool for entrepreneurial firms to search for people with diverse backgrounds and perspectives (Leung, 2003). For example, professional managers from larger corporations may possess very different backgrounds and perspectives from entrepreneurs (Busenitz and Barney, 1997), and such people can become the source of diversity for entrepreneurial firms at the growth phase.  \n\nProposition 2b. The network ties utilized in acquiring core team members evolve from personal social ties during the startup phase to business related ties during the growth phaseofthefirm.  \n\n5.5.5. inrer-personat Juu — screening jor ine rignt type oJ peopie wun niring pracuices Utilizing different network pools to search for talents in accordance with varying strategic needs does not automatically translate into getting people with the “right fit'. The essence of person-organization fit lies in value and goal congruence between the person and the organization (Chatman, 1989; Kristof, 1996), within which the “fit\" content may also change over time (Schneider et al., 1997). Empirical studies have found that during the startup phase of new firms, entrepreneurs make recruitment decisions based mainly on the mutual compelling interests among team members or their common aspirations to start a venture (Chandler and Hanks, 1998; Kamm and Nurick, 1993). Rather than just having a clear business vision as a common ground, entrepreneurs and their team members are being drawn to each other based on similar beliefs, interests, and personal chemistry (Bird, 1988). As firms move to the growth phase, business vision and strategic goals become more well-defined and stable (Churchill and Lewis, 1983). From the P-O fit perspective, during this phase entrepreneurial firms need to have members with diverse perspectives and complementary competencies and also members who share the vision of the organization. This mix of complementary competencies and shared vision facilitate effective communications and execution of organizational tasks (Schneider et al., 1997).  \n\nProposition 3a. For value and goal congruence, entrepreneurs tend to seek talents with shared personal aspirations in the startup phase and with shared business visions during thegrowthphaseofthefirm.  \n\nTo identify people who share similar values requires a prolonged period of repeated interactions between the parties concerned (Jones and George, 1998). The key elements during the process are the exchanges of knowledge and information. Values are manifested through strings of consistent attitudes and behaviors over time, and the information used in the judgment is tacit rather than explicit. Uzzi (1996) suggested that embedded ties are more effective in transferring fine-grained, tacit information. Therefore, in the context of hiring core team members, we expect the preference for direct, strong ties to persist through the startup phase to the growth phase of entrepreneurial firms.  \n\nRelying on strong ties does not necessarily limit the diversity of information and competencies entrepreneurial firms need, especially for their growth phase. It is probable that, if we consider only personal networks, strong ties tend to breed homogeneity, since such ties tend to link people with similar background and perspectives together (Aldrich, 1999, p. 82). However, during the course of building up their businesses, entrepreneurs are likely to come across business counterparts who are different from themselves. For example, professional managers from larger corporations are very different from entrepreneurs (Busenitz and Barney, 1997). They come into contact with entrepreneurial firms mainly through business relationships as customers, suppliers, and resource or service providers. Entrepreneurs may form strong ties with some of these business associates through repeated interactions over a prolonged period of time. These business associates may also come to understand and share the firms' business visions. Having them on board provides the diversity of perspectives and competencies entrepreneurial firms need for facilitating growth. The networks of such people may in turn bring in diverse information which is not obtainable through the entrepreneurs’ personal networks, performing the structural-hole function for entrepreneurial firms (Bian and Ang, 1997; Burt, 1992).  \n\nProposition 3b. The network ties utilized in recruiting core team members are likely to be strong ties at both the startup phase and the growth phase of the firm.  \n\n## 4. Methodology  \n\n### 4.1. Samples and data collection  \n\nSince this was an exploratory study on why and how entrepreneurial firms might come to adapt different types of networks in acquiring their human resources, a case study approach was used (Yin, 1984). A multiple-case study approach and a “theory-based\" sampling design (Chandler and Hanks, 1998; Yin, 1984) were adopted to allow replication within the same group and comparison across groups. Data were collected from two cohorts of 10 entrepreneurial firms each, through interviews with the owner-managers. The first cohort consisted of firms between 2 and 3 years old at the time of the interview. The second cohort consisted of firms between 6 and 30 years old, with an average age of 16.7 years. With the first group, we captured the recruitment of initial team members other than the founders. With the second group, we captured data on how they recruited their core team members during both the startup and the growth phases. Data from the first group acted as a validity check on the retrospective data collected from the second group on their recruitment practices during the startup phase, since entrepreneurs from older firms might be recollecting events that happened 10 to 20 years ago. The second group of firms allowed us to collect data that captured the transition from the startup phase to the growth phase. Our sample firms came from a wide range of industries including manufacturers of food products, printed products, mechanical tooling, and electronic components; internet service providers, software developers, trading companies, and pet stores (services and products).  \n\nThe bulk of the interviews were conducted between the periods of mid-2002 to mid2003, with some follow-up interviews conducted in 2004. A combination of open-ended and structured questions was used. The length of the interviews ranged from $45~\\mathrm{min}$ to90 min. Before the questionnaires were administered, the concepts of core team members (for both cohorts) and the differentiation between the startup and the growth phases (for the second cohort only) were explained to the entrepreneurs. With reference to the definitions of top management team and core talents (Hambrick and Mason, 1984; Lepak and Snell, 1999), we defined core team members as people who hold key positions in the company and are involved in the company's management and strategic decision process. For the transition from the startup to the growth phase, we used four contingents from the stagemodel literature (Churchill and Lewis,1983; Hanks et al.,1993; Smith et al.,1985)to identify the dividing line between the startup and the growth phases: the formation of a clearly articulated growth strategy, additional capital injection, expansion of the general work force and the core team, rapid positive growth for the 3 years after transition. Entrepreneurs made their own decisions on the transition point based on one or more of the dimensions.  \n\nThe open-ended questions aimed to capture the contingents leading to the adaptation of the recruitment practices through networks, and the structured questions helped trace the channels the owner-manager used to recruit their core team members, and the characteristics of the ties used. A total of 71 hires were captured from the two cohorts of firms, 33 from the startup phase and 38 from the growth phase.  \n\n### 4.2. Measures of key concepts and data analysis  \n\nOur study adopted the strategy of building pre-defined constructs and propositions based on existing literature, as recommended by Yin (1984, p. 100-101) and Eisenhardt (1989a, p. 536). Such an approach provides a well-defined focus when we go into organizations, facilitating the systematic collection of specific kind of data. The constructs and propositions also serve as guides for data analysis along clearly defined theoretical ground.  \n\nIn line with the definitions for core concepts used in this paper, various contingents affecting the choice of recruitment practices were categorized through theme coding of the transcripts for testing Propositions la, 2a and 3a. Liabilities of newness and smallness was coded when entrepreneurs referred to uncertainty (or risky, unpredictable environment), the lack of organizational legitimacy (e.g., reputation, recognition, and track record), and the lack of financial, organizational and material resources. Similarity in background or functional diversity were coded with reference to the demographics of the recruits, and shared personal aspirations or shared business vision were coded when entrepreneurs referred to dreams and passion or shared view point on business and identification with firm's goals as reasons for choosing a certain member.  \n\nFor data analysis, we took the steps recommended by Yin (1984) and Eisenhardt (1989a) to conduct both within-case analysis and cross-case pattern searching. The transcript from each single firm was analyzed, noting all the contingents related to the use of different recruitment channels, and then sorted by the pre-defined themes. Repeat occurrences of any emergent themes, as in the case of trust and attitude, were also noted and categorized. Coupled with within-case analysis, we searched for repeated patterns among the same group of firms, and for similarities and/or differences across groups (startup firms versus growth firms) based on the dimensions we established from existing literature. Themes were considered established only if there were multiple occurrences within and across cases, reducing to a certain extent the danger of reaching false conclusions based on isolated evidence and information process biases (Eisenhardt, 1989a, p. 540). Quotations that were representative of the generated themes were then selected to “add voice\" to our text (Wolcott, 1990), as reported in our findings. The matching of proposed themes at the proposed developmental phase (startup or growth) was the basis for supporting our propositions.  \n\nFor coding, data analysis and testing of Propositions 1b, 2b and 3b, we relied mainly on numerical tabulation based on pre-defined variables and measures to capture patterns and relationships between variables, combining qualitative coding and quantitative analyses (Bettenhausen and Murnighan, 1985). Hires in the startup phase and hires in the growth phase were grouped into two separate groups. Recruitment channels were coded into four categories, i.e., recruitment through social ties, recruitment through business ties, internal promotion, and recruitment from the open market. Recruitment through social ties was coded when the recruit was (or was introduced by) a family member or a friend; a schoolmate or an acquaintance from social activities. Recruitment through business ties was coded when the recruit was (or was introduced by) a business associate (e.g., supplier, customer, service provider of the firm, or former colleague). Internal promotion was coded when the position was filled by an existing employee. Recruitment from the open market was coded when the person was a stranger recruited through job advertisement, employment agency, etc. Three commonly used measures for tie strength are duration of the relationship, intimacy of the relationship, and frequency of interaction (Brass, 1995; Burt and Knez, 1995). In this paper, the strength of ties was coded into dichotomies of strong (coded as 1) and weak ties (coded as O) utilizing two of the three measures developed by Burt and Knez (1995). The two items capturing the duration of the relationship (How many years have you known each other before the recruitment?) and intimacy level of the relationship (To what extent do you agree that you keep a close relationship with each other prior to the recruitment?) were used as guidelines to code tie strength. The third item concerning meeting frequency was dropped due to the high possibility of recall error for such a detail. Prior studies have revealed a high correlation between frequency and closeness (Hansen, 1999), hence we do not expect the omission to affect the assessment of tie strength. Following Granovetter's (1973) definition, indirect ties were classified as weak ties. Some examples coded as indirect weaktiesare:  \n\nHe was a former acquaintance introduced by a friend — weak social tie (G2- 250503); He came to sell us leased lines — weak business tie. (G1-090402)  \n\nMulti-dimensional $\\chi^{2}$ tests were used to test Propositions 1b, 2b and 3b. The first $\\chi^{2}$ test differentiated RTN (social and business ties) and other recruitment channels. The second differentiated the types of networks used among the positions recruited through networks, and the third tested the strength of ties used in the two groups of positions hired during the startup and the growth phase.  \n\n## 5. Findings  \n\nAs predicted in Proposition 1a, the “liability of newness and smallness\" was mentioned as a key constraint in attracting people by entrepreneurs from both groups:  \n\nMost of the good technical resources (talents) who are home grown in Singapore don't really want to work for small companies like ours (young and small with high risk of failure). They prefer MNCs or large local companies. (G1-200602)  \n\nIn competing with more established employers for talents, we sometimes can't afford to match their salaries.(G2-050602)  \n\nThe point is that you also have to build your company to a certain size to be able to attract people to join you. When the company is very small, people look at the company, they don' see a career path. They will never come. But when your company starts to grow, and you've got a good vision, they get to know you, then they will say, “hey this company will grow, and I want to be part of this growth'. (G2-250703)  \n\nThe results of the multi-dimensional $\\chi^{2}$ test (Table 1) conducted on the two groups of positions with regard to their recruitment channels supported Proposition 1b. Of the total number of hires in both the startup and the growth phases, $76.1\\%$ were through networks. While there was a significant difference between the two groups of hires in the different phases $\\scriptstyle(\\chi^{2}=4.732$ ， $p{=}0.015$ 0, RTN was the predominant trend in both $87.9\\%$ during the startup phase, and $65.8\\%$ during the growth phase). However, the reliance on RTN decreased in the growth phase relative to the startup phase.  \n\nTable 1 Multi-dimensional $\\chi^{2}$ test for recruitment channels for positions   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"6\">Growthphases*recruitment channels cross-tabulation</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">Recruitment channels</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Other recruitment channels</td><td>Recruitment through networks</td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"9\">Growth phases</td><td rowspan=\"9\">Startup phase</td><td>Count</td><td>4</td><td>29</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>Expected count</td><td>7.9</td><td>25.1</td><td>33.0</td></tr><tr><td>% Within growth phases</td><td>12.1%</td><td>87.9%</td><td>100.0%</td></tr><tr><td>% Within recruitment</td><td>23.5%</td><td>53.7%</td><td>46.5%</td></tr><tr><td>channels % of Total</td><td>5.6%</td><td>40.8%</td><td>46.5%</td></tr><tr><td>Count</td><td>13</td><td>25</td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td>Expected count</td><td>9.1</td><td>28.9</td><td>38.0</td></tr><tr><td>%Withingrowthphases</td><td>34.2%</td><td>65.8%</td><td>100.0%</td></tr><tr><td>% Within recruitment channels</td><td>76.5%</td><td>46.3%</td><td>53.5%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"5\">Total</td><td>% of Total</td><td>18.3%</td><td>35.2%</td><td>53.5%</td></tr><tr><td>Count</td><td>17</td><td>54</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Expected count</td><td>17.0</td><td>54.0</td><td>71.0</td></tr><tr><td>%Withingrowth phases</td><td>23.9%</td><td>76.1%</td><td>100.0%</td></tr><tr><td>%Within recruitment channels</td><td>100.0%</td><td>100.0%</td><td>100.0%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>% of Total</td><td>23.9%</td><td>76.1%</td><td>100.0%</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n$N{=}71,\\gamma^{2}{=}4.73,d f{=}1,p{=}0.015.$  \n\nPropositions 2a and 3a were closely related and were often mentioned together during our conversations with the entrepreneurs. Consistent with our predictions, firms at the startup phase focussed more on similarity in background for team members, than on functional qualifications. This was closely linked to a preference for people who had shared personal aspirations and values with the entrepreneurs:  \n\nEither they are friends that I know for many years or a friend's friend who have known one another for many years. So, there is (a) certain bond and confidence in one another. (G1-090902)  \n\n... even if the person has very good qualifications or lots of experience,it doesn't mean that the person can work with me. I think the chemistry is very important, whether they can work with me, whether they can work with their colleagues, whether they find that the office is right for them, I think that is very important. I choose my partners from previous colleagues. They know me very well — my management skill and my background. Me too. We need a cohesive team to work together and overcome the difficulties together, not blame each other. (G2-140703)  \n\nOf coursethey don't know the technology in detail,soI have to train them up.That's why I put them at the middle (level). ... So, last three years we trained them up, they are the best persons. ... (In contrast) those guys who are looking at the money, although they have a strong technology background, are not welcomed.(This is) because those startup (members) have to suffer together in the process of the companygrowth.(G2-120602)  \n\nAt the growth phase, however, entrepreneurs tended to make their recruitment choices based more on complementary competencies than on a common background:  \n\nWe have to ask ourselves why this person will benefit the organization.... So it's not just because he's a friend or that we have known each other for 10 years. No, it's more than that.It's more becauseweknewhim or her,weknew thathe has the particular knowledge or function that we want him or her to fill. That's why we offered to do this job together.

He was being laid off, and I brought him in to give the company some new ideas.(G2-210307)  \n\nCompetency match alone is not sufficient. The core people who joined the firm during the growth phase also need to identify with the company's vision. Professional managers joined the firm because they could see where the company was going, not just because they believed in the entrepreneur:  \n\nThese people have worked with me before. They have a feel for what the company is like. They know the direction of the company. They know the vision. And I believe because of all these, they stay very motivated. And they are confident in how things will be done.(G2-250703)  \n\nBefore they join your company, they already obtained an understanding of your product, not just based on knowing me. They do not join the company because they have faith on (in) me. They know my character, they also know the recognition of the company and its products in the market, then,they join.

Rather, in absolute numbers, business ties seemed to be more frequently used than social ties (16 vs. 13). However, a separate $\\chi^{2}$ test on the positions recruited through networks during the startup phase showed no distinctive preference between social and business networks $(\\chi^{2}=0.310$ $p{=}0.577,$ .A validity check on positions hired during the startup phase in the first and second cohort of firms showed no significant difference in recruitment channels used between the two groups of firms $(\\chi^{2}=0.214$ $p{=}0.519,$  \n\nTable 2 Multi-dimensional $\\chi^{2}$ test for types of networks used in hiring   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"6\">Growth phases*types of network cross-tabulation</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">Types of networks</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Socialnetworks</td><td>Business networks</td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"9\">Growth phases</td><td rowspan=\"9\">Startup phase</td><td>Count</td><td>13</td><td>16</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Expected count</td><td>7.5</td><td>21.5</td><td>29.0</td></tr><tr><td>%Within growth phases</td><td>44.8%</td><td>55.2%</td><td>100.0%</td></tr><tr><td>%Withintypesofnetworks</td><td>92.9%</td><td>40.0%</td><td>53.7%</td></tr><tr><td>% of Total</td><td>24.1%</td><td>29.6%</td><td>53.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Count</td><td>1</td><td>24</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Expected count</td><td>6.5</td><td>18.5</td><td>25.0</td></tr><tr><td>% Within growth phases</td><td>4.0%</td><td>96.0%</td><td>100.0%</td></tr><tr><td>%Within types of networks</td><td>7.1%</td><td>60.0%</td><td>46.3%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"5\">Total</td><td>% of Total Count</td><td>1.9%</td><td>44.4%</td><td>46.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Expected count</td><td>14 14.0</td><td>40 40.0</td><td>54</td></tr><tr><td>% Within growth phases</td><td>25.9%</td><td>74.1%</td><td>54.0 100.0%</td></tr><tr><td>%Within types of networks</td><td>100.0%</td><td>100.0%</td><td>100.0%</td></tr><tr><td>% of Total</td><td>25.9%</td><td>74.1%</td><td>100.0%</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n$N{=}54,\\gamma^{2}{=}11.653,d f{=}1,p{<}0.001.$  \n\nThe mixed network pattern used during the startup phase may be interpreted from the angles of availability and preference. In many cases, family members or friends might not be available, or were unwilling to take up positions in the startups (Aldrich and Langton, 1997). They might be holding positions with more established firms and were reluctant to makethe move:  \n\nWhen my account manager resigned, I asked if she (my niece) can do the account. She worked for HL (an established financial company). She said HL is better.... I even talked to my classmates,university classmates ...at least four or five of them: \"please come and join me, I need someone to help\". He came (a university classmate),he came alone. (G1-120602)  \n\nIn such cases, entrepreneurs may have no choice but to utilize whatever other channels available to them in line with the “improvisation\" and “effectuation\" theory of the entrepreneurial process (Baker and Aldrich, 2000; Sarasvathy, 2001). On the other hand, some entrepreneurs might not want to hire from their social circle when they had a choice:  \n\nI do not believe in running the business with family members. I believe in getting outsiders.(G2-250503)  \n\nI seldom take friends'recommendations. I try to avoid (that because) there will be a lot of power and politics problems. If you want to fire him, (someone hired) based on a friend's recommendation, (it) can be a lot of problems. No family members. Also, staff's family members cannot be here. (G2-140703)  \n\nIt is difficult to do business with family members — emotions tend to get in the way. A lot of people run the company with family management. It does not work. Having close friends working with you is the same thing. Better remain as good friends (than mixing friendship and business together). (G2-250703)  \n\nDuring the growth phase, the network utilization pattern was much clearer. Of the 25 hired through networks, 24 $96\\%$ were from business networks. Proposition 2b was partially supported.  \n\nThe multi-dimensional $\\chi^{2}$ test on positions recruited through networks and tie strength (Table 3) showed no significant difference between the startup and the growth phase $(\\chi^{2}=0.207$ $p{=}0.325,$ . There seemed to be a tendency towards strong ties for both phase $(62.1\\%$ of the hires during the startup phase, and $68\\%$ of the hires during the growth phase were strong ties). A separate $\\chi^{2}$ test on hires through strong ties showed no significant difference between the two phases $\\scriptstyle\\chi^{2}=0.029$ ， $p{=}0.866,$ . Proposition 3b, with regard to the strength of ties utilized in RTN, was supported.  \n\nOn top of the themes of shared personal values or business vision, additional themes captured from dialogues with the entrepreneurs provided further explanation as to why strong ties were generally preferred. One emerging theme was the issue of trust. From firms at the startup phase, we hear repeated references to the importance of trust:  \n\nFor those people we know, we know what we can expect and what they can deliver. (G1-080402)  \n\nI think that (trust) is the most important.... You must at least get people who are competent.Buthe may not be aligned with you.He may not have the commitment, and ask why he must work so hard. (G1-110902)  \n\nFrom firms at the growth phase, emphasis on trust is apparent:  \n\nSo, there is trust, you can trust him. We knew each other (through working as counterparts for 10 years). (There was) no need to go through the process of building up trust.... Trusting the person means trusting him to manage for the company... (lf) you believe the person has the sense of responsibility to do the job well, has the ability, then you give him the job. (G2-140703)  \n\nWhen I talk to people in the interview, I must feel that I am confident in the person, and can trust him. I believe that if you cannot trust a person, do not hire him.(G2-210703)  \n\nAnother emerging theme closely related to trust was the stress on attitude:  \n\nIn business, I still think the attitude is more important than qualification(s) (G1-110902)  \n\nTable3 Multi-dimensional $\\chi^{2}$ test on strength of ties used in hiring   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"6\">Growth phases*tie strength cross-tabulation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">Tie strength</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"></td><td>Weak</td><td>Strong</td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"10\">Growth phases</td><td>Startup phase</td><td>Count</td><td>11</td><td>18</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Expected count</td><td>10.2</td><td>18.8</td><td>29.0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>%Withingrowthphases</td><td>37.9%</td><td>62.1%</td><td>100.0%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>%Within tie strength</td><td>57.9%</td><td>51.4%</td><td>53.7%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>% of Total</td><td>20.4%</td><td>33.3%</td><td>53.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Growth phase</td><td>Count</td><td>8</td><td>17</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Expected count</td><td>8.8</td><td>16.2</td><td>25.0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>% Within growth phases</td><td>32.0%</td><td>68.0%</td><td>100.0%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>% Within tie strength</td><td>42.1%</td><td>48.6%</td><td>46.3%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>% of Total</td><td>14.8%</td><td>31.5%</td><td>46.3%</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Total</td><td>Count</td><td>19</td><td>35</td><td>54</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td>Expected count</td><td>19.0</td><td>35.0</td><td>54.0</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td>%Withingrowth phases</td><td>35.2%</td><td>64.8%</td><td>100.0%</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td>% Within tie strength</td><td>100.0%</td><td>100.0%</td><td>100.0%</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td>% of Total</td><td>35.2%</td><td>64.8%</td><td>100.0%</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n$N{=}54$ $\\chi^{2}=0.207$ $d f=1$ ， $p=0.325$  \n\nExperience is not important.... If the basic attitude of the person is right, can be trusted, keen to learn, he can overcome the handicaps. (G2-210703)  \n\nJudgment  of  both  trustworthiness  and  atitude  required fine-grained information transfer, which is best achieved through the utilization of strong ties (Krackhardt, 1992; Uzzi, 1996). Therefore, entrepreneurs who are looking for such qualities in their core team members will lean towards strong ties.  \n\n## 6. Discussion  \n\nIn this study, we explored multiple “fit' considerations linking RTN practices, and their evolution over different phases of organizational development, to the changing environmental, organizational and interpersonal dynamics of entrepreneurial firms. Our findings support our general proposition that entrepreneurial firms adapt different network strategies in acquiring their core human resources at different developmental phases due to multiple considerations of fit. Our effort represents an initial attempt to adapt a “system approach\" of contingency theory (Miller, 1981; Van de Ven and Drazin, 1985） to understand the underlying dynamics of HR practices.  \n\n### 6.1. Implications  \n\nMainstream HRM literature suggests that organizations should choose between “buy\" (market system) or “make”\" (internal system) for their HRM practices contingent on the type of business strategies adopted (e.g., Delery and Doty, 1996; Miles and Snow, 1984).  \n\nOur study suggests that, due to their specific needs and constraints, the strategic choices entrepreneurial firms need to make with regard to their HRM practices is “how to buy” the right types of talents they need at different developmental phases of the firm with the means available to them. Specifically, they “buy\" from social and business networks during the startup phase, and “buy” almost exclusively from business networks during the growth phase. Such an understanding highlights the need to study human resource practices in entrepreneurial firms in their specific context.  \n\nOur examination ofthe recruitment practices through networks, and how they change over time, enhances the understanding of network effects in the entrepreneurial process, specifically in the acquisition of human resources. Extant studies on the utilization of networks in resource acquisition by entrepreneurial firms seem to suggest that strong ties contribute more to firm survival, and weak ties are more important in facilitating growth (Bruderl and Preisendorfre, 1998; Hite and Hesterly, 2001; Stearns, 1996). While such studies have solid theoretical ground in the strength of weak ties theory (Granovetter, 1973) and structure-holes theory (Burt, 1992), our findings suggest that the use of strong ties in acquiring core team members persists throughout the startup and the growth phases of the firm. We bring additional insights to the debate on the effects of strong/weak ties by showing that, instead of switching from strong ties to weak ties to achieve diversity in perspectives and competencies, entrepreneurial firms shift from personal social networks to business networks. This is consistent with the concept of stability versus change when studying network effects and organizational transition (Burkhardt and Brass, 1990). While shifting their network pool in search of talents with diverse competencies, entrepreneurs cling to strong ties to find talents who are different from themselves, and yet still share certain common ground and values.  \n\nOn the practical front, our study broadens the understanding of recruitment practices of entrepreneurial firms. The limited literature on the topic thus far focuses more on what the practices are, rather than on why such practices are employed. By taking a “system approach\" in examining how network recruitment practices of entrepreneurial firms emerge and evolve, this study highlights the importance of strategic alignments among multiple contexts and practices. Such an understanding is of reference value for strategic decisions of entrepreneurial firms on human resource acquisition. Decision-makers need to be conscious of the multiple fit dynamics in considering what type of people they need and how they are going to get them.  \n\nSpecifically, our study suggests that entrepreneurs, in seeking people to join their firms, may utilize strong ties during both the startup and growth phases. These strong ties could come from a mix of business and social networks in the startup phase and from business networks in the growth phase. Such findings may have certain implications for job seekers as well. While Granovetter's study (1974) suggests that weak ties lead to better job prospects for managers, professionals and technical positions, our findings suggest that to become a core member in an entrepreneurial firm, more direct relationships (either in a business or social context) may have to be established before one will be considered for the job.  \n\n### 6.2. Limitations and future research  \n\nGiven that this is an exploratory study done on a small sample of entrepreneurial firms, we need to be cautious in generalizing the findings. While the main purpose of this study is to build new theoretical perspectives, further studies with more robust research designs are needed to validate our propositions. The retrospective longitudinal approach employed in this study also has its limitations. Entrepreneurs may have cognitive and perceptual limitations that reduce the validity and reliability of their retrospective accounts (Chandler and Lyon, 2001). We have taken measures to improve validity by comparing the retrospective data from firms at the growth phase with those collected from a separate cohort of startup firms. Nevertheless, longitudinal panel studies should be conducted in the future to validate our findings.  \n\nCollecting multi-dimensional data from a single informant also has its inherent weaknesses, although there is little dispute that owner-managers are the most appropriate people to provide data on the firm and the team. Given time and accessibility, collecting a separate set of data from team members of the respective firms can certainly further enhance our understanding of the fit dynamics, and increase the validity of the findings.  \n\nOf the two general types of network studies highlighted by Brass (1995), the egocentric network approach focuses on the networks of a focal individual, and the whole network approach captures the comprehensive structure linking all members together. In this study, we focused on the egocentric networks of the entrepreneurs. To generate a more comprehensive understanding of the network effect recruitment and selection of talents in entrepreneurial firms, capturing the dynamics of the whole network structure among core team members of the firm should be an important agenda for future studies.  \n\nThere is also the possibility of country specific bias in our findings, since all the firms in our study are Singaporean local enterprises. Singapore is a predominantly Chinese society, and there will inevitably be a strong influence of the Chinese business culture. The preference for direct, strong ties even in business settings, for example, may be related to the specific Chinese perspectives on relationships (guanxi) and trust. According to Brunner et al. (1989), “the reliability of a guanxi varies directly with its closeness: the closer the guanxi, the more reliable it is; the more distant, the less reliable\". Nonetheless, network recruitment practices can also be found in Western societies. For example, Inc., a magazine on fast-growing entrepreneurial firms (Caggiano, 1998; Fenn, 1997) reported similar network strategies used in the recruitment practices of entrepreneurial firms in the US. Hence, the implications of our findings may reach beyond the Chinese cultural context. Comparative studies across cultures should be done in future to test the generalizability of the findings from thisstudy.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nWe would like to thank Ron Rodgers, Dan McAllister, S.

However, the success of enterprise digitalization heavily depends on a variety of complementary human capital and employee capabilities. We focus on whether and to what extent enterprise digitalization affects employee upgrading, and whether digitalization is more valuable in firms where digitalization matches with human capital. Our analysis measures employee upgrading using detailed employee-level data (i.e., experience and education) and matches these data to metrics on enterprise digitalization to determine whether a firm's digitalization facilitates employee upgrading. Using the data of A-share listed companies from two Chinese exchanges between 2007 and 2020, we find that firms that undergo digital transformation have a greater demand for more highly technologically skilled and highly educated employees but experience a decrease in the demand for production workers. We also find that digitalization helps firms to create new demand for more skilled and higher educated labor and the re-training of existing manufacturing workers. Furthermore, we find that firms that undergo digital transformation receive higher value benefits from their complementary relationship between enterprise digitalization and labor skills, indicating that digitalization can increase firm value through upgrading their employees’ labor skills. These results shed light on the fact that firms aiming to digitally transform successfully not only need to have digital assets but also must develop or acquire human capabilities related to digital technologies.  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nThe digital economy is expanding with steady momentum, and the organizational structure, management methods, and business activities of enterprises have undergone major changes due to the widespread use of big data, artificial intelligence, the internet of things, cloud computing, and other digital technologies. The digital transformation of firms has garnered substantial attention from policymakers, practitioners, and academia because it is not only the most important part of enterprise management but is also a critical choice that firms must consider in the digital era (Gartner, 2018; Deloitte et al., 2021; KPMG, 2021).  \n\nThere is contradictory and mixed evidence in the literature regarding how digital transformation affects employment. The sharp decline in the labor share of national income in the United States has been regarded as evidence that sociality is being transformed by digital intelligence (Karabarbounis and Neiman, 2014; Oberfield and Raval, 2021). As digital and intelligent machines become more prevalent (Li et al., 2021; Xu and Ye, 2021; Chen and Srinivasan, 2023), new technologies will eliminate labor (e.g., Autor and Dorn,  \n\n2013; Goos et al., 2014; Graetz and Michaels, 2018; Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018; Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2020). Conversely, digitalization will not only improve enterprise productivity but also enable the accumulation of long-term capital and the deepening of automation, increasing the additional demand for labor in other aspects (David, 2015; Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2019) and creating new job opportunities (Mokyr et al., 2015; Akerman et al., 2015; Gaggl and Wright, 2017; Wilson and Daugherty, 2018). Most existing studies pertaining to digitalization and the workforce have been based on theoretical models (DeCanio, 2016; Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018), case studies (Kokina et al., 2021), or survey data and industry-level data (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2020; Zhang et al., 2023). However, the extent to which enterprise digitalization affects employees and the potential mechanism by which it does so has not yet been verified by empirical evidence. Furthermore, the effect of enterprise digital transformation on employment structure adjustment remains underexplored given the lack of firm-level data.  \n\nChinese listed companies disclose unique detailed information about staff-level positions (e.g., the number of workers in different positions) and educational qualifications (e.g., the number of employees at each educational level). The novel data on firm-level human capital for Chinese listed companies are provided by the RESSET database, which can help us to measure the firm-level labor structure directly and examine labor upgrading. In addition, following prior literature, we define transformation in firms based on the disclosure of digital terms in the text of their annual reports (Niu et al., 2023; Chen and Srinivasan, 2023). In this study, we use Chinese publicly listed A-share companies from 2007 to 2020 to investigate the impact of enterprise digitalization on labor upgrading. Specifically, we use firm-level employee details (i.e., the number and proportion of highly skilled workers, highly educated workers, and production workers) to measure labor upgrading. We also measure digital transformation through text analysis.  \n\nWe find that firms that undergo digital transformation employ more highly technologically skilled and highly educated personnel while employing fewer manufacturing workers, indicating that digital transformation facilitates labor upgrading. The results are robust to the difference-in-differences (DID) estimation, using the implementation reform of Broadband China at the city level as an exogenous shock2 and to alternative measures of key variables. Next, we test two plausible mechanisms through which digital transformation affects labor upgrading. We find that digital transformation promotes the transformation and upgrading of internal staff (i.e., an increase in internal training costs) and increases the hiring of highly technologically skilled and highly educated personnel.  \n\nHowever, we do not find that digitalization alone can improve labor investment efficiency and firm value. Only when enterprise digital transformation is implemented in conjunction with labor upgrade, can it improve labor investment efficiency and firm value. To further support our hypothesis, we conduct a battery of cross-sectional tests. We find that the effects of digital transformation on labor upgrading become salient when the potential labor adjustment cost is higher (e.g., for more labor-intensive firms and state-owned enterprises [SOEs]) for high-tech firms and those headquartered in the eastern region of China, where there are more high-tech personnel and advanced digital technologies.  \n\nOur study makes two main contributions. First, while many existing studies explore digital transformation, our study specifically relates to the debate on whether the digital transformation of firms increases or decreases the workforce (Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2014; Akerman et al., 2015; Gaggl and Wright, 2017; Wilson and Daugherty, 2018; Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018; Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2020). Some extant literature shows that new technologies will render labor redundant for tasks previously completed by workers (DeCanio, 2016; Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018; Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2020). Other studies show that the digital transformation of a firm's operations does not necessarily reduce the number of employees. This is suggested by the substantial increase in demand for labor in other aspects (David, 2015; Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2019) and the creation of new job opportunities (Mokyr et al., 2015; Akerman et al., 2015; Gaggl and Wright, 2017; Wilson and Daugherty, 2018) due to the introduction of new technologies. Our study supports the research that finds digital transformation increases the workforce by providing direct empirical evidence that digital transformation facilitates labor upgrading.  \n\nSecond, the evidence concerning the effect of enterprise digitalization on firm value is inconsistent (Chen and Srinivasan, 2023). Digitalization can increase a firm's market value to higher than its peers. However, there is also weak evidence that although nearterm, positive improvements in fundamental performance due to digitalization increase interim productivity, there is a loss in sales growth. Our paper reveals that the real final effect of enterprise digitalization on firm performance depends on the complementary relationship between related higher-skilled human capital and enterprise digitalization. Digitalization can increase firm value only when a firm possesses digital technologies and skilled workers.  \n\nOur study also makes smaller but significant contributions in other ways. First, it expands the body of literature on the role of digitalization in shaping a firm's employment quality and structure. Currently, many scholars mainly focus on the effect of enterprise digitalization on employment quantity (Gali, 1999; Wei et al., 2010; Arntz et al., 2017; Graetz and Michaels, 2018; Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018; Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2019; Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2020) and firm performance (Chen and Srinivasan, 2023). However, the exploration of the impact of digital transformation on employment upgrading remains largely neglected. We measure employee upgrading at the firm level and demonstrate whether and to what extent is impacted by digitalization. Furthermore, our paper contributes to the literature on the consequences of digitalization. The extant literature has examined the effects of digitalization on the capital market (Wu et al., 2022), auditing (Zhang et al., 2023), and credit risk (Cheng and Qu, 2020; Niu et al., 2023). Thus far, it is unclear how digitalization influences labor upgrading. This study helps fill this knowledge gap.  \n\nThe rest of the study is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the development of digitalization—both globally and in China—-reviews related literature about digitalization and employment and develops our research hypothesis. Section 3 describes the data source, sample period, and key variable measurements. It also reports the descriptive statistics of the data sample. Section 4 presents the baseline empirical results and a battery of robustness checks. Section 5 provides additional analyses of mechanisms and consequences. Section 6 explains the cross-sectional tests. Section 7 concludes the study.  \n\n2. Institutional background, literature review, and hypothesis development  \n\n### 2.1. Digital transformation around the world  \n\nEnterprise digitalization, as an important engine of global economic growth, has led to the reshaping of global value chains. MIT and Forbes surveyed more than 400 large mainstream companies around the world and found that digital firms are $26\\%$ more profitable than their peers within the same industry. To maintain growth during crises (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic), must embark on a digital transformation. With the increasing development of computer hardware and digital technologies, information technology has contributed to the development of the global internet since digital transformation was popularized in the 1980s and 1990s. The development of the internet and information technology not only allows people to contact each other more easily but also lowers information search costs and reduces information asymmetry.  \n\nDuring the rapid development of digitalization, manufacturing and service industries have begun to integrate with digital technology on a large scale. Digitalization does not only increase the production eficiency of manufacturing enterprises and reduce investment and development costs; it also saves social resources. Data has become increasingly essential with the development of digital products. Since 2016, big data and artificial intelligence have greatly improved the capabilities of enterprises to analyze and use their data. At the same time, the rise of user-scale platforms, such as those from Tencent, Ali Cloud, and Siemens, has created new service and product carriers. This stage highlights the importance of platforms as the foundation of intelligent transformation.  \n\nIn 2022, against the backdrop of the still severe COVID-19 pandemic, major countries adopted the digital economy as a means to improve their economic development and cope with the effects of the pandemic. In 2021, the digital economy added $\\mathrm{US}\\$38.1$ trillion in value in 47 countries, a $15.6\\%$ increase in growth compared to the previous year, accounting for $45.0\\%$ of the combined GDP for these countries. Developing countries have a faster growth rate, reaching $22.3\\%$ in 2021. China, the United States, and Europe illustrate three major patterns of global digital economy development. In terms of size, the United States ranks first, with a digital economy scale of ${\\mathrm{US}}\\$15.3$ trillion, followed by China with $\\$0S7.1$ trillion. In Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, the digital economy accounts for more than $65\\%$ of each country's GDP. From 2005 to 2021, the scale of the Chinese digital economy (i.e., the proportion of the digital economy in terms of GDP) increased by 15.08 times from RMB2.6 trillion $(14.2\\%)$ to RMB45.5 trillion $(39.8\\%)$  \n\nAccording to the statistics released by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, a government authority, data production reached 6.6ZB (1ZB is equal to 1 trillion GB), accounting for $9.9\\%$ of the global total data production (67ZB), second only to the United States and ranked second in the world. Since 2019, the data output of China has maintained an annual growth rate of approximately $30\\%$ and the data center market scale has also maintained a high growth rate of more than $25\\%$ Aspart of its 19th National Congress report, the Communist Party of China recommended promoting the deep integration of the digital economy with the real economy and energetically developing the digital economy. Digital transformation and the development of physical enterprises have therefore become crucial to China's innovation development.  \n\n### 2.2. Digital transformation and employment  \n\nCurrently, the effect of enterprise digitalization on employment and wages in the labor market is a hotly debated topic. Opponents argue that digital transformation is harmful, as it decreases the need for human labor due to automation or digital technologies, especially caused unemployment to rise in the low-skilled workforce. However, digital transformation is beneficial, as it bolsters a new demand for labor that can only completed by humans, thereby creating many new job opportunities.  \n\nSome scholars predict there will be widespread unemployment in the future due to the ever-prevalent use of big data, industrial robots, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and other digital technologies (Kunst, 2020). Early industrial revolution innovations, such as spinning and weaving machines, led to widespread displacement (Mokyr, 1990). In the second half of the 19th century, agricultural workers were displaced by agricultural machines such as horse-powered reapers, harvesters, and plows. This continued through the 20th century with tractors and combine harvesters (Olmstead and Rhode, 2001). Society is in an era of rapid automation. Jobs once completed by production workers are being eliminated by the widespread use of digital technologies such as industrial robots (Graetz and Michaels, 2018). Some traditional workers in service or manufacturing are also seeing some of the work they used to do being replaced by digital technologies and artificial intelligence. Digital transformation has been realized through the application of big data (Brynjolfsson and Mitchell, 2017), which automates or eliminates some tasks once undertaken by employees. This reduces the demand for and the number of production and operation employees, thus reducing the cost of labor incurred by firms (Brynjolfsson and Mitchell, 2017; Babina et al., 2024). Using industrial robot data in the United States from 1990 to 2007 to measure human capital at the industry level, Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020) find that with an increase of one robot per 1000 workers, the oloyment ratio decreased by $0.18\\%{-}0.34\\%$ and the cost of labor was reduced by $0.25\\%{-}0.5\\%$  \n\nOther scholars, however, provide opposite findings and show that the apparent increasing the demand of many new jobs despite the recent increase in digital transformation. Digitalization increases the number of new tasks and new job titles, which accounts for a substantial fraction of employment growth in the United States (Acemoglu and Autor, 2011). Although enterprise digitalization creates a displacement effect among production workers, a reinstatement effect is also produced through the introduction of new tasks in which humans have a comparative advantage over robots (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2019). These new tasks include RPA manager and research staff of high-technology. Thus, digitalization leads to the creation of more jobs (Mokyr et al., 2015; Akerman et al., 2015; Gaggl and Wright, 2017; Wilson and Daugherty, 2018; Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018). Graetz and Michaels (2018) find that the more robots are used in society, the higher labor productivity and wage income; however, the increased use of robots has no significant impact on the total working time of workers. Cooper et al. (2019) show that those employees believe that robotic process automation (RPA) is positively changing the higher-level employees perform and improving these employees’ career prospects, whereas no such improvements are received by lower-level employees. Zhang et al. (2023) also find that RPA is unlikely to lead to unemployment for highly skilled accountants.  \n\nIn addition, scholars have also found that a non-linear relationship exists between technological progress and workers with different skills. Job polarization is an increased employment trend of high-skilled and low-skilled laborers occurring with a significant decline in the employment ratio of middle-skilled laborers. Some studies shed light on this phenomenon by showing that low-skilled workers are redeployed from traditional labor-intensive jobs to service occupations and the wages of employees at both ends of the distribution of occupational skills increase significantly (Acemoglu and Autor, 201l; Autor and Dorn, 2013). Based on a theoretical model, Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018) find that automation of both low-skill and high-skill tasks will compress workers? wages due to a displacement effect. Moreover, because of a ripple effect, the wages of other workers who are not completely replaced will also decline. This will eventually aggravate wage inequality. Dixon et al. (2021) document that robots predict decreases in employment for middle-skilled workers but increases in employment for low- and high-skilled workers.  \n\n### 2.3. Hypothesis development  \n\nThe underlying assumption of previous studies that show that enterprise digitalization or intellectualization will reduce employee hiring is that enterprises can flexibly adjust the hiring and firing of employees (Brynjolfsson and Mitchell, 2017; Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018; Agrawal et al., 2019; Babina et al., 2024). However, different from Western developed markets, the employment behavior of Chinese listed companies (especially in SOEs) is strongly affected by policy burden (Lin and Tan, 1999; Gu et al., 2020); thus, it is difficult for enterprises to lay off or recruit a large number of employees in a short time according to their own digital transformation and development needs.3 Therefore, to alleviate the shortage of technical personnel or labor force during digital development, enterprises rationally choose to make up for the scarce technical and highly educated personnel in the process of digital transformation through internal adjustment and external employment.  \n\nInternal adjustment involves firms conducting a cost-benefit analysis when deciding whether to fire or hire employees. The production of human capital emerges when the economic benefit of an employee is much greater than that of specific asset investment. Internal personnel training can greatly improve employee efficiency. Existing studies have shown that there is a large gap in the need for highly skilled and educated workers in the external labor market, and the accumulation of human capital related to digital technologies requires the cultivation of either higher education or more work experience (Dranove et al., 2014; Babina et al., 2024). Lowering the supply of efficient technology and talent will limit the positive effect of digital transformation on enterprises (Zhang et al., 2023). Therefore, firms cannot rely solely on limited external talent recruitment; they must also strengthen the cultivation of digital capability among their current workers.  \n\nBased on actual business needs, enterprises should build a talent development system suitable for enterprise digital transformation, and smooth the internal talent development and supply channels. First, the progress of digital technology is accompanied by the redistribution of internal resources. Digitalization is not only conducive to improving the automation level of enterprise production but also helps to save labor costs (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018), providing financial resources for employee training and R&D investment. As mentioned in Section 2.2, most studies show that the impact of technological progress on workers with different skills is nonlinear, causing job polarization (Autor et al., 2006; Acemoglu and Autor, 2011). This will intensify employees awareness of a crisis, and further strengthen their motivation and desire for training and independent study to upgrade their skills. Some studies also find that human resource management practices that include employee training can maximize enterprise performance (Pfeffer, 1994).  \n\nDue to the introduction of a large number of digital and intelligent systems, software, and machine equipment with RPA and the creation of new jobs during the digitalization process, firms cannot effectively meet their increased demand for non-automated, highly skilled and highly educated labor through the internal mechanism of employee training alone (Autor, 2015; Mokyr et al., 2015; Akerman et al., 2015; Gaggl and Wright, 2017; Daut et al., 2018; Wilson and Daugherty, 2018; Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2019). Thus, the demand for external talent willintensify for firms during digital transformation. In addition, from the employee supply perspective, with the process of digital technology penetrating all aspects of economic activities (Goldfarb and Tucker, 2019), competition among enterprises for digital talents will intensify. Digital transformation will spur a capital market response by improving enterprise operations and management efficiency and increasing information disclosure (Wu et al., 2022). The introduction of new technologies, new artificial intelligence equipment, and blockchain projects will also attract excellent technical talent to firms. As mentioned in Section 2.2., Dixon et al. (2021) document that robots predict decreases in employment for middle-skilled workers but increases in employment for low- and high-skilled workers. Based on the above arguments, we present the following hypothesis:  \n\nH1. Digital transformation can enhance laborupgrading (i.e., decrease the number of production workers and increase the number of higher-skilled or educated workers).  \n\nHowever, we also note that digital transformation may not directly promote labor upgrading. Unlike in the United States, where enterprises are more likely to be unable to lay off workers because of their union protections, China's enforcement of labor protection laws is generally inefficient even though it has undergone several major revisions to the labor protection law because of the highly competitive labor force. Thus, enterprises may lay off workers and hire new ones more quickly. In this situation, firms have enough flexibility to fire or hire workers as necessary during digital transformation; thus, digital transformation may not lead to direct labor upgrading and instead lead to an employee adjustment.  \n\n## 3. Research design and sample  \n\n### 3.1. Sample selection  \n\nThe labor protection laws of China underwent major revisions in 2007, which had a significant impact on the dismissal and employment of workers. Moreover, in 2007, listed companies began disclosing detailed data about their employees’ education and staff-level positions through the RESSET database. This availability of information allowed us to delve deeper into the relationship between educational backgrounds, job positions, and digitalization. And other financial data are obtained from the China Stock Market and Accounting Research (CSMAR) database. Thus, we select publicly listed companies from 2007 to 2020 as the initial sample. We start with 32,960 firm-year observations from 2007 to 2020 and delete the observations of firms in the finance industry since their operations differ from other firms. We also drop extreme observations of firms faced with delist risk (special treatment) and observations of firms missing values for the regression variables. After imposing these screens, we are left with more than 26,360 firm-year observations (the number of observations varies with different explained variables).  \n\n### 3.2. Research design  \n\nTo test our hypothesis, following Wu et al. (2022) and Chen and Srinivasan (2023), we employ the following model to examine the effect of digitalization on labor upgrading:  \n\n$$\nL a b o r U p g r a d e_{i,t}=\\alpha+\\beta_{1}L N D T_{i,t}+\\gamma C o n t r o l_{i,t}+\\varepsilon_{i,t}\n$$  \n\nwhereLaborUpgrad $e_{i,t}$ denotes the labor upgrading proxied by several variables: the natural logarithm of the total number of employees (LNEMP), the natural logarithm of the number of technical employees (LNTECH), the ratio of technical employees to the total number ofemployees $(T E C H\\_R A T E)$ , the natural logarithm of the number of employees holding a bachelor's degree or higher (LNBACH), the proportion of employees holding a bachelor's degree or higher (BACH RATE), the natural logarithm of the number of production employees (LNPROD), and the proportion of production employees (PROD_RATE).  \n\nThe key variable we are interested in is digital transfer, and we proxy for this variable by identifying digital terms in firms textual disclosures. Following the method of Chen and Srinivasan (2023) and Niu et al. (2023), independent variable digital transformation (LNDT) is measured as the natural logarithm of the frequency of occurrence of digital keywords plus 1 in the financial reports. Specifically, we use Python software to obtain the annual reports of all Chinese A-share listed companies and use Java PDF box to extract all text content from the annual reports. We also follow prior literature (Wu et al., 2022; Chen and Srinivasan, 2023) to construct a digital transformation dictionary. Based on this, we exclude terms with negative words such as “no, “none,” and “not' in front of them. We also exclude words that are not related to the company itself. Based on the dataset extracted from the text of listed companies' annual reports using Python, the keywords relevant to digital technology are categorized into five genres: artificial inteligence, chain blocks, cloud computing, big data, and digital technology application. We next add the frequency of the above keywords to determine the final digital transformation keyword frequency. We present the dictionary of digital transformation keywords in Appendix B.  \n\nIf enterprise digitalization upgrades the labor force, the coefficient on LNDT is expected to be significantly positive when the dependent variables are LNTECH, TECH RATE, and LNBACH, BACH RATE. The coefficient on LNDT is expected to be significantly negative when the dependent variables are LNPROD and PROD_RATE. We control for some firm characteristics that have been shown to affect labor structure in prior literature: size (SIZE), defined as the natural logarithm of the total market value; profitability (ROA), calculated as net income divided by total assets at the end of a year; firm age (AGE), calculated as the natural logarithm of the years that firm establishment; leverage (LEV), which is total liabilities divided by total assets; market-to-book ratio (MTB), calculated as the market value of equity divided by net equity value; and ownership attribute (OWN), which is a dummy variable that equals 1 if a firm is an SOE and O otherwise. We further control for some governance variables: the percentage of independent directors (INDIR), the natural logarithm of the number of board directors (BOARD), the ownership of the largest shareholder (LARGE), and the ratio of institutional investors shares (INST). We also control for whether the audit firm is among the top 10 in China (TOP10) and the natural logarithm of the number of analysts covering firm i in year t (LNANA).  \n\nLast, we add firm and year fixed effects to control for some omitted variables resulting from firm time-invariable characters and time trend effects. Statistical significance is determined using robust standard errors clustered at the firm level. We winsorize all continuous variables at the 1st and 99th percentiles to mitigate the impact of outliers.  \n\n### 3.3.Summary statistics  \n\nTable 1 provides the summary statistics of our primary variables. The mean of LNEMP is 1.283 and the maximum is 11, indicating that the total number of employees in listed companies varies greatly. The average values of LNPROD and PROD_RATE are 6.661 and 0.512, respectively, suggesting that employees in the production departments of listed companies account for the vast majority of all employees. The means of LNTECH and TECH RATE are 5.739 and 0.195, respectively; thus, technical employees account for $19.5\\%$ of the total employees in firms. The mean of BACH RATE is 0.247, indicating that $24.7\\%$ of employees hold a bachelor's degree or higher. The means of LNDT and DTDUM are 1.772 and 0.540, respectively, which indicates that digital transformation is prevalent and differs in different firms. Substantial cross-firm variations exist in terms of SIZE, LEV, AGE, LNANA, and so on.  \n\nPanel A of Table 2 shows that on average $54.00\\%$ of enterprises have implemented digital transformation $(D T D U M=1)_{\\.}$ in our research sample. The rate of enterprise digital transformation has increased over time, with this ratio growing from1 $3.79\\%$ in2007to $79.74\\%$ in2020.  \n\nPanel B of Table 2 shows the distribution of digital transformation (DTDUM) by industry (using the industry classification of the China Securities Regulatory Commission issued in 2oo1). The percentage of firms having undergone digital transformation within an industry is fairly even, ranging from a low of $28.25\\%$ (mining and minerals) to a high of $83.20\\%$ (information technology). Other industries with a relatively high percentage of firms undergoing digitalization include communication and culture $(76.83\\%)$ and wood and furniture $(69.27\\%)$ 4.  \n\n## 4. Empirical results  \n\n### 4.1. Main results  \n\nTable 3 presents the regression results of the digital transformation of enterprises on labor upgrading. In column (1),the coefficient on LNDT is significantly positive at the $5\\%$ level, indicating that the total number of employees has increased with digital transformation. Reflecting the economic significance of the coefficient's estimate, the number of total employees increases by $0.01\\%$ for every $1\\%$ increase in the degree of enterprise digital transformation.  \n\nColumns (2) and (3) show the impact of enterprise digitalization on technical employees and indicate that enterprise digitalization significantly increases both the number (LNTECH, coeff. $=0.023.$ and the proportion (TECH RATE, coeff. $=0.004\\$ of technical employees. Specifically, the number (ratio) of highly skilled technical employees increases by $0.023\\%$ $\\left(0.004\\%\\right)$ forevery $1\\%$ increase in the degree of enterprise digital transformation. This indicates that $0.41\\%$ (0.023/5.739) of highly skilled technical employees increased per standard deviation unit change in digital transformation relative to the sample mean.  \n\nColumns (4) and (5) show the impact of enterprise digitalization on highly educated employees (those holding a bachelor's degree or higher), suggesting that enterprise digitalization significantly increases the number (LNBACH, coeff. $=0.014\\$ ) and proportion (BACH_ RATE, coeff. $=0.003^{}$ of highly educated employees. This indicates that the number (ratio) of highly educated employees increases by $0.014\\%$ $\\left(0.003\\%\\right)$ for every $1\\%$ increase in the degree of enterprise digital transformation. Thus, $0.23\\%$ (0.014/6.004) of highly educated employees increased per standard deviation unit change in digital transformation relative to the sample mean. However, as predicted, columns (6) and (7) show a negative relationship between digitalization and production employees, both in terms of number (LNPROD, coef. $=-0.036)$ and ratio $(P R O D\\_R A T E$ coeff. $=-0.007)$ . This suggests that the number (ratio) of production employees decreased by $0.036\\%$ $(0.007\\%)$ for every $1\\%$ increase in the degree of enterprise digital transformation and indicates that $0.54\\%$ (0.036/6.661) of production employees decreased per standard deviation unit change in digital transformation relative to the sample mean. In summary, increases in the number and proportion of technologically skilled and highly educated employees coupled with the reduction of the production workforce during enterprise digitalization indicate that the digital transformation of enterprises promotes labor upgrading.  \n\n### 4.2. Robustness checks  \n\n#### 4.2.1. Difference-in-differences (DID) analysis  \n\nIn August 2013, the State Council announced its plan to implement Broadband China. A total of 120 cities (covering $80\\%$ ofChina's population) were staggered in three stages as pilot sites for Broadband China from 2014 to 2016 by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the National Development and Reform Commission. Theoretically, the areas in which Broadband China was implemented will have experienced an increase in the construction of information infrastructure and a significant improvement in the coverage range and speed of local broadband, thus promoting the digital transformation of enterprises headquartered in these cities. Therefore, this study uses these pilot cities of Broadband China as an exogenous shock to enterprise digitalization.  \n\nTable 1 Descriptive statistics.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Obs.</td><td>Mean</td><td>S.D.</td><td>Min</td><td>p25</td><td>p50</td><td>p75</td><td>Max</td></tr><tr><td>LNEMP</td><td>30,560</td><td>7.664</td><td>1.283</td><td>4.174</td><td>6.824</td><td>7.616</td><td>8.462</td><td>11.000</td></tr><tr><td>LNPROD</td><td>26,513</td><td>6.661</td><td>2.003</td><td>0.000</td><td>5.911</td><td>6.898</td><td>7.857</td><td>10.430</td></tr><tr><td>PROD_RATE</td><td>26,510</td><td>0.512</td><td>0.238</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.359</td><td>0.561</td><td>0.696</td><td>0.905</td></tr><tr><td>LNTECH</td><td>27,339</td><td>5.739</td><td>1.319</td><td>1.946</td><td>4.905</td><td>5.710</td><td>6.562</td><td>9.148</td></tr><tr><td>TECHRATE</td><td>27,333</td><td>0.195</td><td>0.165</td><td>0.009</td><td>0.088</td><td>0.144</td><td>0.242</td><td>0.822</td></tr><tr><td>LNBACH</td><td>26,363</td><td>6.004</td><td>1.328</td><td>2.773</td><td>5.100</td><td>5.908</td><td>6.831</td><td>9.611</td></tr><tr><td>BACH_RATE</td><td>26,360</td><td>0.247</td><td>0.172</td><td>0.024</td><td>0.116</td><td>0.199</td><td>0.339</td><td>0.768</td></tr><tr><td>DTDUM</td><td>30,869</td><td>0.540</td><td>0.498</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.000</td><td>1.000</td><td>1.000</td><td>1.000</td></tr><tr><td>LNDT</td><td>30,869</td><td>1.772</td><td>2.685</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.693</td><td>2.485</td><td>15.040</td></tr><tr><td>SIZE</td><td>30,869</td><td>22.130</td><td>1.307</td><td>19.090</td><td>21.200</td><td>21.960</td><td>22.880</td><td>26.090</td></tr><tr><td>LEV</td><td>30,869</td><td>0.445</td><td>0.211</td><td>0.060</td><td>0.280</td><td>0.440</td><td>0.601</td><td>1.000</td></tr><tr><td>ROA</td><td>30,869</td><td>0.035</td><td>0.067</td><td>-0.322</td><td>0.013</td><td>0.035</td><td>0.065</td><td>0.219</td></tr><tr><td>AGE</td><td>30,869</td><td>2.831</td><td>0.353</td><td>1.386</td><td>2.639</td><td>2.890</td><td>3.091</td><td>3.466</td></tr><tr><td>MTB</td><td>30,869</td><td>2.112</td><td>1.441</td><td>0.862</td><td>1.252</td><td>1.649</td><td>2.395</td><td>9.802</td></tr><tr><td>SOE</td><td>30,869</td><td>0.416</td><td>0.493</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.000</td><td>1.000</td><td>1.000</td></tr><tr><td>INDIR</td><td>30,869</td><td>0.374</td><td>0.053</td><td>0.300</td><td>0.333</td><td>0.333</td><td>0.429</td><td>0.571</td></tr><tr><td>BOARD</td><td>30,869</td><td>2.141</td><td>0.201</td><td>1.609</td><td>1.946</td><td>2.197</td><td>2.197</td><td>2.708</td></tr><tr><td>LARGE</td><td>30,869</td><td>0.347</td><td>0.149</td><td>0.086</td><td>0.230</td><td>0.327</td><td>0.450</td><td>0.748</td></tr><tr><td>INST</td><td>30,869</td><td>0.086</td><td>0.116</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.007</td><td>0.039</td><td>0.118</td><td>0.569</td></tr><tr><td>LNANA</td><td>30,869</td><td>2.410</td><td>1.858</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.000</td><td>2.565</td><td>4.007</td><td>5.687</td></tr><tr><td>TOP10</td><td>30,869</td><td>0.580</td><td>0.493</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.000</td><td>1.000</td><td>1.000</td><td>1.000</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nThis table presents descriptive statistics of main variables. The full variables are defined in Appendix A.  \n\nFollowing Wu et al. (2022), we match listed companies according to their location and employ a staggered DID model to rule out omitted variables and confounding effects. pecifically, if cityj, the location of a listed company's headquarters, is a pilot site in yeart, the variable BD is equal to 1 after the year $t+1$ andO otherwise.  \n\nPanel A of Table 4 presents the DID results, the coefficients on BD are significantly positive in columns (1) to (5) when the dependent variables are LNEMP, LNTECH, TECH RATE, LNBACH, and BACH RATE, respectively. In contrast, columns (6) and (7) show that the coefficients on BD are significantly negative when the dependent variables are LNPROD and PROD_RATE, respectively. Overall, these results indicate that the implementation of the Broadband China strategy significantly promotes labor upgrading, thereby reinforcing the causal impact of digitalization on labor upgrading. Furthermore, the parallel trend check presented in Panel B of Table 4 also reinforces our causal inference based on the DID analyses.  \n\n#### 4.2.2. Matching DID  \n\nTo further address the concern that our results are driven by omitted firm or industry variables, we further design a matching DID model, with the matching performed on the control variables in Eq. (1) (including SIZE, LEV, ROA, AGE, MTB, OWN, INDIR, BOARD, LARGE, INST, LNANA, and TOP10). Panel C of Table 4 presents the results for the matched sample regression results. Before the matching of sample enterprises, there were significant differences between the treatment group and the control group for most characteristic variables. However, after the matching, there were no significant differences between the two samples for many control variables (untabulated for the sake of brevity).  \n\nPanel C of Table 4 reports the matching DID results $(\\mathrm{PSM}+\\mathrm{DID})$ . The coefficients on BD are also significantly positive when using LNEMP, LNTECH, TECH RATE, LNBACH, and BACH RATE as the dependent variables (columns [1]-[5]). The coefficient on $B D$ is significantly negative in column (7) when the dependent variable is PROD_RATE. Collectively, the results here support our hypothesis that digital transformation significantly increases the demand for highly skilled and highly educated employees while decreasing the need for production employees, thus promoting labor upgrading.  \n\n#### 4.2.3. Alternative measurements of digital transformation and labor upgrading  \n\nThe independent variable for digital transformation that we used before is LNDT (Wu et al., 2022). Following Wu et al. (2022), we use an alternative measure of digital transformation, DTPNT, which is the frequency of occurrence of the corresponding digital keywords in the annual reports published by listed companies over the total number of textual words (in thousands). We also use alternative measures for labor upgrading. Highly educated employees are defined as those holding a master's degree or higher. Thus, LNMASTER represents the natural logarithm of the number of employees with at least a master's degree, and MASTER_ RATE represents the proportion of employees holding a master's degree or higher. Highly skilled employees are defined as technical and R&D employees. Thus, LNTECH1 represents the natural logarithm of the number of technical and R&D employees, and TECH1_RATE represents the ratio of technical and R&D employees to the total number of employees. We employ these alternative measures to enhance the robustness of our results. The results are shown in Panels D and E of Table 4, which reaffirm the findings from the main tests.  \n\nTable 2 Sample distribution.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"7\">Panel A: Yearly distribution of whether an enterprise is undergoing digital transformation</td></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td colspan=\"2\">DTDUM=0</td><td colspan=\"2\">DTDUM =1</td><td>Total</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Obs.</td><td>%</td><td>Obs.</td><td>%</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>975</td><td>86.21</td><td>156</td><td>13.79</td><td>1131</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>1080</td><td>86.19</td><td>173</td><td>13.81</td><td>1253</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>1110</td><td>82.34</td><td>238</td><td>17.66</td><td>1348</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>1126</td><td>77.18</td><td>333</td><td>22.82</td><td>1459</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>1298</td><td>72.51</td><td>492</td><td>27.49</td><td>1790</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>1358</td><td>66.18</td><td>694</td><td>33.82</td><td>2052</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>1276</td><td>58.05</td><td>922</td><td>41.95</td><td>2198</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>1062</td><td>48.08</td><td>1147</td><td>51.92</td><td>2209</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>867</td><td>37.10</td><td>1470</td><td>62.90</td><td>2337</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>858</td><td>33.66</td><td>1691</td><td>66.34</td><td>2549</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>795</td><td>29.58</td><td>1893</td><td>70.42</td><td>2688</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>882</td><td>27.94</td><td>2275</td><td>72.06</td><td>3157</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>818</td><td>25.11</td><td>2440</td><td>74.90</td><td>3258</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2020 Total</td><td>697</td><td>20.26</td><td>2743 16,667</td><td>79.74 54.00</td><td>3440 30,869</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"7\">14,202 46.01</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"7\"></td></tr><tr><td>Industry</td><td></td><td>DTDUM=0</td><td></td><td>DTDUM=1</td><td></td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td>Obs.</td><td>% 50.00</td><td>Obs.</td><td>%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Agriculture,forestry,animalhusbandry,and fishery Mining and minerals</td><td>195 630</td><td>71.75</td><td>195 248</td><td>50.00 28.25</td><td>390 878</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Food and drink</td><td>592</td><td>46.29</td><td>687</td><td>53.71</td><td>1279</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Textiles, apparel, and footwear</td><td>278</td><td>39.60</td><td>424</td><td>60.40</td><td>702</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Wood and furniture</td><td>55</td><td>30.73</td><td>124</td><td>69.27</td><td>179</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Paper and printing</td><td>246</td><td>49.80</td><td>248</td><td>50.20</td><td>494</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Oil, chemicals, and plastics</td><td>1900</td><td>65.38</td><td>1006</td><td>34.62</td><td>2906</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Metals and non-metals</td><td>1522</td><td>63.31</td><td>882</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Machinery,equipment,and instrument</td><td>2651</td><td>42.63</td><td>3567</td><td>36.69</td><td>2404</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Medicine andbiologicalproducts</td><td>1290</td><td>64.24</td><td>718</td><td>57.37 35.76</td><td>6218</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Other Manufacturing</td><td>44</td><td>43.56</td><td>57</td><td></td><td>2008</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Producers and suppliers of electricity,coalgas,and water</td><td>856</td><td>67.67</td><td>409</td><td>56.44 32.33</td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Construction</td><td>467</td><td>56.33</td><td>362</td><td>43.67</td><td>1265 829</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td>452</td><td>44.18</td><td>571</td><td>55.82</td><td>1023</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Transportation and warehousing Information Technology</td><td>814</td><td>16.80</td><td>4032</td><td>83.20</td><td>4846</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Wholesale and retail</td><td>578</td><td>33.59</td><td>1143</td><td>66.41</td><td>1721</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td>845</td><td>61.28</td><td>534</td><td></td><td>1379</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Real estate</td><td>611</td><td>37.76</td><td>1007</td><td>38.72 62.24</td><td>1618</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Public service</td><td>111</td><td>23.17</td><td>368</td><td></td><td>479</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Communication and culture</td><td>65</td><td>43.33</td><td>85</td><td>76.83 56.67</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Comprehensiveindustry</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nThis table presents yearly Panel A) and industry Panel B) distribution of whether an enterprise undergone digital transformation. DTDUM is taking a value of 1 if enterprise establishing digitization, and 0 otherwise.  \n\n## 5. Additional analyses  \n\nThe theoretical analysis in Section 2.3 points out that the employment behavior of Chinese listed companies is strongly affected by policy burden (Lin and Tan, 1999; Gu et al., 2020). Therefore, it is difficult for enterprises (both SOEs and non-SOEs) to lay off employees or recruit a large number of employees in a short period of time according to their digital transformation and development needs. Therefore, to alleviate the shortage of technical talent or labor supply during enterprise digitalization, firms can do one of the following: (1) enterprises will improve the skills and knowledge of their current workforce by increasing the training expenditure for internal employees or; (2) enterprises will increase the employment of external employees to make up for scarce technical and highly educated talent during digital transformation.  \n\n### 5.1.Enterprise digitalization and internal training expense  \n\nFirst, we examine whether enterprise digitalization will upgrade the internal employee proxy through the increased training expenses for employees. Therefore, we design two training cost variables, LNTCOST denotes the natural logarithm of the training cost, and TCOST_SIZE represents the training cost scaled by the size of enterprises to avoid the firm size difference. We replace the dependent variables with LNTCOST and TCOST_SIZE in Eq. (1).  \n\nTable3 Regression of enterprise digitalization and labor upgrading.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">D.V.=</td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td><td>(2)</td></tr><tr><td>LNEMP</td><td>LNTECH</td><td>TECHRATE</td><td>LNBACH</td><td>BACHRATE</td><td>LNPROD</td><td>PROD_RATE</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">LNDT</td><td>0.010**</td><td>0.023***</td><td>0.004***</td><td>0.014***</td><td>0.003***</td><td>-0.036***</td><td>-0.007***</td></tr><tr><td>(2.06)</td><td>(4.56)</td><td>(4.47)</td><td>(3.04)</td><td>(3.39)</td><td>(-3.74)</td><td>(-6.22)</td></tr><tr><td>0.648***</td><td>0.638***</td><td>0.006**</td><td>0.690***</td><td>0.006</td><td>0.510***</td><td>-0.009*</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">SIZE LEV</td><td>(31.35)</td><td>(26.30)</td><td>(2.17)</td><td>(38.26)</td><td>(1.64)</td><td>(12.07)</td><td>(1.75)</td></tr><tr><td>0.215***</td><td>0.104</td><td>-0.026**</td><td>0.107</td><td>-0.032***</td><td>0.523***</td><td>0.046***</td></tr><tr><td>(3.09)</td><td>(1.27)</td><td>(-2.52)</td><td>(1.57)</td><td>(2.94)</td><td>(4.73)</td><td>(2.95)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">ROA</td><td>-0.210**</td><td>-0.027</td><td>0.021</td><td>-0.057</td><td>0.020</td><td>0.107</td><td>0.036*</td></tr><tr><td>(-2.36)</td><td>(-0.27)</td><td>(1.55)</td><td>(-0.69)</td><td>(1.18)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0.0770</td><td>0.0710</td><td>-0.040**</td><td>-0.181**</td><td>-0.043***</td><td>(0.61) 0.754***</td><td>(1.71) 0.061***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">AGE</td><td>(0.83)</td><td>(0.64)</td><td>(2.28)</td><td>(-2.03)</td><td>(-2.87)</td><td>(4.41)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0.004</td><td>0.005</td><td>0.001</td><td>0.005</td><td>0.001</td><td>-0.012</td><td>(2.69)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">MTB</td><td>(0.54)</td><td>(0.69)</td><td>(0.54)</td><td>(0.76)</td><td>(0.48)</td><td></td><td>-0.003**</td></tr><tr><td>0.050</td><td>0.011</td><td>-0.002</td><td>0.028</td><td></td><td>(-0.85)</td><td>(-2.25)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">SOE INDIR</td><td></td><td>(0.29)</td><td>(-0.30)</td><td>(0.83)</td><td>-0.002</td><td>-0.045</td><td>-0.008</td></tr><tr><td>(1.31)</td><td>0.127</td><td>-0.014</td><td>-0.070</td><td>(-0.38)</td><td>(-0.89)</td><td>(-1.08)</td></tr><tr><td>0.046 (0.29)</td><td>(-0.62)</td><td>(0.46)</td><td>(-0.48)</td><td>-0.029</td><td>0.080</td><td>0.027</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">BOARD</td><td>0.153***</td><td>0.033</td><td>-0.017*</td><td>0.222***</td><td>(1.04)</td><td>(0.23)</td><td>(0.66)</td></tr><tr><td>(2.60)</td><td>(0.45)</td><td>(1.84)</td><td>(3.89)</td><td>-0.005</td><td>0.155</td><td>-0.004</td></tr><tr><td>0.076</td><td>0.053</td><td>-0.007</td><td>0.078</td><td>(-0.54)</td><td>(1.47)</td><td>(0.31)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">LARGE</td><td>(0.61)</td><td>(0.37)</td><td>(-0.36)</td><td>(0.67)</td><td>-0.005 (0.24)</td><td>-0.060</td><td>-0.047</td></tr><tr><td>-0.125**</td><td>-0.141**</td><td>0.006</td><td>-0.034</td><td>0.009</td><td>(-0.27)</td><td>(1.58)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">INST</td><td>(2.24)</td><td>(-2.07)</td><td>(0.66)</td><td>(-0.67)</td><td></td><td>-0.306***</td><td>-0.032**</td></tr><tr><td>0.010**</td><td>0.018***</td><td>0.002***</td><td>0.024***</td><td>(0.90)</td><td>(2.97)</td><td>(2.46)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">LNANA</td><td>(2.53)</td><td>(3.78)</td><td>(2.69)</td><td>(5.88)</td><td>0.002*** (3.29)</td><td>-0.010</td><td>-0.004***</td></tr><tr><td>-0.009</td><td>0.013</td><td>0.003</td><td>0.003</td><td>0.000</td><td>(1.38)</td><td>(-3.56)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">TOP10</td><td>(-0.59)</td><td>(0.76)</td><td>(1.12)</td><td>(0.21)</td><td>(0.15)</td><td>-0.038</td><td>-0.005</td></tr><tr><td>-7.173***</td><td>-8.570***</td><td>0.188**</td><td>-9.579***</td><td></td><td>(1.40)</td><td>(1.42)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Constant</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.210***</td><td>-6.412***</td><td>0.631***</td></tr><tr><td>(15.11)</td><td>(15.21)</td><td>(2.50)</td><td>(22.17)</td><td>(2.58)</td><td>(-6.79)</td><td>(5.36)</td></tr><tr><td>Year/Firm</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Obs.</td><td>30,560</td><td>27,339</td><td>27,333</td><td>26,363</td><td>26,360</td><td>26,513</td><td>26,510</td></tr><tr><td>R²</td><td>0.463</td><td>0.360</td><td>0.025</td><td>0.605</td><td>0.109</td><td>0.111</td><td>0.079</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTable 3 presents the results on the enterprise digitalization and labor upgrading. The dependent variables in columns (1)-(7) are the natural logarithm of the total number of employees (LNEMP), the natural logarithm of the number of technical employees (LNTECH), the number of technical employees over the total number of employees (TECH RATE), the natural logarithm of the number of employees with bachelor degree at least (LNBACH), the proportion of employees with bachelor degree at least (BACH_ RATE), the natural logarithm of the number of production employees (LNPROD) and the proportion of production employees (PROD_RATE), respectively. Independent variable digital transformation (LNDT) is an indicator denotes the natural logarithm of the frequency of occurrence of the corresponding digital keywords in the annual reports published by listed companies. See Appendix A for variable definitions. $\\yen8$ , \\*\\*, \\* denote significance at the $1\\%$ $5\\%$ and $10\\%$ levels, respectively. Tstatistics are based on robust standard errors clustered at the firm level.  \n\nThe results are reported in the Table 5. Both the coefficients on LNDT in columns (1) and (2) and the coeficients on DTPNT in columns (3) and (4) are significantly positive, sugesting that when enterprises implement digitalization, they will spend more on employee training to improve employees? skills to meet the digital-related labor demand. This supports our plausible channel of internal training.  \n\n### 5.2. Enterprise digitalization and external employees’demand  \n\nWe further examine whether the digitalization of enterprises affects the employment of external employees. Specifically, One the one hand, we use the annual number of employees coming from different sectors in the Chinese stock market to help us calculate the employment growth rate for different employees. Therefore, we define RLNTECH (RTECH RATE) as the growth in the number (ratio) of technical employees growth. Likewise, RLNBACH (RBACH RATE) represents the growth in the number (ratio) of highly educated employees, and RLNPROD (RPROD_RATE) is the growth in the number (ratio) of production employees. This makes it convenient for us to observe the demand for different employees through the change in employee growth. The results from columns (1)-(4) in Panel A of Table 6 show that the coefficients on LNDT are also significantly positive, suggesting that a higher degree of digitalization has a significantly positive impact on the external hiring of highly skilled and highly educated labor. However, columns (5) and (6) in Panel A of Table 6 respectively show that the coefficients on LNDT are significantly negative when the dependent variables are RLNPROD and RPROD_RATE. This indicates that enterprise digitalization decreases the external employment of production employees, which further supports our external hiring argument.  \n\nIn addition, we conducted a web crawl of Zhaopin, a national recruitment website. We analyzed job demand titles and calculated the natural logarithm value of employee demand for high-technology and traditional manufacturing positions. Specifically, we further defined LNHIGHTECDEMAND as the natural logarithm value of employee demand on high-technology plus 1, which calculated based  \n\nTable 4 Robustness check tests.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>D.V.=</td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(9)</td><td>()</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>LNEMP</td><td>LNTECH</td><td>TECHRATE</td><td>LNBACH</td><td>BACHRATE</td><td>LNPROD</td><td>PROD_RATE</td></tr><tr><td>BD</td><td>0.069***</td><td>0.064**</td><td>0.005**</td><td>0.027**</td><td>0.004**</td><td>-0.021</td><td>-0.007**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(3.06)</td><td>(2.36)</td><td>(2.23)</td><td>(2.42)</td><td>(2.17)</td><td>(-1.03)</td><td>(-2.54)</td></tr><tr><td>Controls</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Year/Firm</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Obs.

Enterprise digitalization, labor upgrading, and labor investment efficiency  \n\nLabor investment efficiencies can be further affected by digital transformation if enterprise digitalization has a substantial impact on labor structure. Theoretically, there may exist a mismatch between digitalization and the workforce in the early stages of digital transformation, thus reducing labor investment efficiency. However, the adverse effect of digitalization on labor investment efficiency  \n\nTable6 Enterprise digitalization and external employees' demand.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"7\">Panel A:Employees (ratio) growth evidence</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">D.V.=</td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td></tr><tr><td>RLNTECH</td><td>RTECHRATE</td><td>RLNBACH</td><td>RBACHRATE</td><td>RLNPROD</td><td>RPROD_RATE</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">LNDT</td><td>0.002**</td><td>0.001***</td><td>0.001***</td><td>0.011***</td><td>-0.005***</td><td>-0.028***</td></tr><tr><td>(2.51)</td><td>(3.19)</td><td>(2.67)</td><td>(2.66)</td><td>(-5.50)</td><td>(-2.86)</td></tr><tr><td>Controls</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Year/Firm</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Obs.</td><td>23,209</td><td>23,204</td><td>22,071</td><td>22,068</td><td>21,747</td><td>21,745</td></tr><tr><td>R2</td><td>0.420</td><td>0.099</td><td>0.522</td><td>0.064</td><td>0.299</td><td>0.096</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nPanel B: Obs demand analyses   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">D.V.=</td><td>(1)</td><td>(6)</td></tr><tr><td>LNHIGHTECDEMAND</td><td>LNPRODDEMAND</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">LNDT</td><td>0.013***</td><td>-0.005*</td></tr><tr><td>(2.99)</td><td>(-1.77)</td></tr><tr><td>Controls</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Year/Firm</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Obs.</td><td>6627</td><td>6627</td></tr><tr><td>R²</td><td>0.051</td><td>0.039</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTable 6 presents the regression results of enterprise digitalization and external employees' demand.

(2014), we use abnormal net hiring based on a formal regression model to measure labor investment inefficiencies. Abnormal net hiring conceptually denotes the difference between the actual change in a firm's workforce and the expected change based on a fundamental prediction model.  \n\nFollowing the design of Pinnuck and Lillis (2007) and Jung et al. (2014), we first construct a primary estimate of expected net hiring, which is a regular regression of the percentage change in employees on several underlying economic characteristics at the firm level:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{N R T\\_H R E_{i}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}S A L E S.E V K W U E_{i-1}+\\beta_{2}S A L E S.G R O W T H_{i}+\\beta_{3}\\Delta R O A_{i\\prime}+\\beta_{4}\\Delta R O A_{i\\prime-1}+\\beta_{5}R O A_{i\\prime}}\\ &{\\qquad+\\beta_{6}R E T U R N_{i}+\\beta_{7}S U Z E.R_{i-1}+\\beta_{8}Q U I C K_{i-1}+\\beta_{9}\\Delta Q U I C K_{i-1}+\\beta_{10}\\Delta Q U I C K_{i}+\\beta_{11}L E V_{i-1}}\\ &{\\qquad+\\beta_{12}L O S S B I N_{1i-1}+\\beta_{13}L O S S B I N_{2i-1}+\\beta_{14}L O S S B I N_{3i-1}+\\beta_{15}L O S S B I N4_{i-1}+\\beta_{16}L O S S B I N S_{i-1}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere NET_HIRE represents the percentage change in total employees. SALES_REVENUE is the percentage change in sales revenue. ROA is defined as net income divided by total assets at the beginning of year t. AROA denotes the change in profitability. RETURN is the annual stock return for firm i at the end of year t. SIZE_R is defined as the ranked percentiles of the natural logarithm of the market value of equity at the beginning of year t. QUICK represents the sum of cash and short-term investments plus receivables divided by current liabilities. △QUICK represents the change in liquidity. LEV denotes the ratio of long-term debt to total assets at the beginning of year t. The LOSSBIN variables are indicators that are defined according to the ROA in the prior year. Specifically, LOSSBIN is equal to a different count number N for each 0.005 interval of ROA in the prior year from 0 to $-0.025$ (i.e., LOSSBIN1 equals 1 if ROA in the previous year is between $-0.005$ and 0, LOSSBIN2 equals 1 if prior year's ROA is between $-0.010$ and - 0.005, and so on). Following the prior literature (Pinnuck and Lillis, 2007; Jung et al., 2014), the model also includes industry fixed effects. Detail definitions for all variables are also summarized in Appendix A.  \n\nAfter estimating Eq. (2), we can obtain expected net hiring by estimating the coefficients for each firm-year observation. In addition, we employ the following model (3) to investigate the relationships between enterprise digitalization, labor upgrading, and labor investment efficiency:  \n\n$$\nA B_{-}N E T.H I R E|_{i t}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}L N D T_{i-1}+\\beta_{2}L a b o r U p g r a d e_{i-1}+\\beta_{3}L N D T_{i-1}\\times L a b o r U p g r a d e_{i-1}+\\gamma C o n t r o l_{i-1}+\\varepsilon_{i}\n$$  \n\n$\\left|A B_{-}N E T_{-}H I R E\\right|$ is defined as the absolute difference between actual net hiring and the expected one, which also includes OINV (defined as overinvestment when abnormal net hiring is positive) and UINV (defined as underinvestment when abnormal net hiring is negative). LaborUpgrade denotes the several variables of labor upgrading, specifically, we define DLNPROD, which is taking value of 1  \n\nTable7 Enterprise digitalization, labor upgrading and labor investment

T statistics (in parentheses) are based on robust standard erors clustered at the firm level.  \n\nif the production employee is decreased in year t. DLNTECH is equal to 1 if the technical employee is increased in year t. DLNBACH is taking value of 1 if the employees with bachelor degree at least is increased in year t. In line with our story, we expect the coefficients On $\\beta3$ is negatively significant if labor upgrading after digitalization can improve labor investment efficiency (both OINV and UINV).  \n\nThe control variables in model (3) include MTB, SIZE, DIVDUM, STD_CFO, STD_SALES, TANGIBLE, LOSS, INSTI, STD_NET_HIRE, LABOR INTENSITY. MTB is the market-to-book value of common equity at the beginning of year t. SIZE is the natural logarithm of equity market value at the beginning of year t. DIVDUM takes the value of 1 if a firm pays dividends in year t - 1; otherwise, it equals 0. STD_CFO is the standard deviation of the cash flow from operations in the past five years (i.e., from years $t-5$ to t -1). Likewise, STD_SALES is defined as the standard deviation of the sales revenue of the previous five years. TANGIBLE represents property, plants, and equipment divided by total assets in year t - 1. LOSS equals 1 if a firm suffers a loss in year $t-1$ ; otherwise, it equals O. INSTI is the ratio of outstanding common shares held by institutional investors in year t - 1. STD_NET HIRE is the standard deviation of the percentage change in employees over the past five years. LABOR INTENSITY is the ratio of the number of employees divided by total assetsinyear $t-1$ . All other variables are the same with the model (2). The model also includes industry and year fixed effects to control for some omitted variables. Statistical significance is determined using robust standard errors clustered at the firm level.  \n\nThe results of this analysis are reported in Table 7. Column (1) shows that the coefficient on LNDT (0.o01) is significantly positive at the $5\\%$ level, which indicates that digitalization reduces labor investment efficiency (especially overinvestment) on average because of the mismatch between digitalization and the workforce (the coefficient on LNDT [O.o01] in column [2] is significantly positive at the $5\\%$ level). However, the coefficient on $L N D T{\\times}D L N P R O D$ is significantly negative when the dependent variable is OINV in column (4) and insignificantly negative when the dependent variable is UINV in column (5). This shows that labor investment efficiency does significantly improve because of digitalization reduces the overfiring of production employees. Consistent with our arguments, labor investment efficiency increased the underhiring of the highly skilled and the highly educated. The coefficients on LNDTxDLNTECH and $L N D T{\\times}D L N B A C H$ are both significantly negative when the dependent variable is UINV in columns (7) and (9), respectively. Our findings strongly support our hypothesis that digitalization is most effective when complemented by a skilled workforce. In other words, the presence of related human capital is essential for digitalization technologies to have a positive impact on organizational performance.  \n\n### 5.4. Enterprise digitalization, labor upgrading, and market value  \n\nNext, we examine how firm book value and market value are affected by the digital transformation of enterprises and its labor upgrading effect. Following the method of Chen and Srinivasan (2023), we replace the dependent variables with firm book value (ROA, defined as the return on total assets of firm i in year $t+1$ ) and market value (TOBINQ, defined as the market value divided by the book value of firm i in year $t+1$ )in Eq. (3).  \n\nTable 8 presents the regression results and shows that the coefficients on LNDT are significantly negative in columns (1) and (6),  \n\nTable8 Enterprise digitalization, labor upgrading and market value.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">D.V.=</td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td></tr><tr><td>ROA</td><td></td><td></td><td>TOBINQ</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">LNDT</td><td>-0.002</td><td>-0.002***</td><td>-0.002***</td><td>0.025***</td><td>-0.020***</td><td>-0.021***</td></tr><tr><td>(1.18)</td><td>(-4.06)</td><td>(-3.81)</td><td>(10.97)</td><td>(-2.60)</td><td>(2.72)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">DLNPROD</td><td>0.001</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.002</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>(1.37)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.58)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">LNDTxDLNPROD</td><td>0.000</td><td></td><td></td><td>-0.003***</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>(0.38)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(-3.21)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">DLNTECH</td><td></td><td>0.004***</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.027**</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(4.65)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(2.16)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">LNDTxDLNTECH</td><td></td><td>0.001***</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.013***</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(3.53)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(3.11)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">DLNBACH</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.009***</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.023</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(7.42)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(1.23)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.001***</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.013***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(4.40)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(3.21)</td></tr><tr><td>Controls Year/Firm</td><td>YES YES</td><td>YES YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Obs.</td><td>19,332</td><td></td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>R²</td><td>0.067</td><td>19,975 0.071</td><td>19,056 0.076</td><td>19,332 0.528</td><td>19,975 0.367</td><td>19,056 0.373</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTable 8 presents theregressionresults of enterprise digitalization, laborupgrading and market value.

T statistics (in parentheses) are based on robust standard errors clustered at the firm level.  \n\nTaken together, these results shed light on the fact that enterprise digitalization successfully improves labor investment efficiency and firm value conditional on matched or complementary relationships between human capabilities and digital technologies.  \n\n## 6. Cross-sectional tests  \n\nTo map associations between enterprise digitalization and labor upgrading across multifaceted aspects, we perform cross-sectional tests to examine some heterogeneous effects.  \n\n### 6.1. Labor adjustment cost  \n\nFirst, we examine whether or not our main effect is strengthened in firms with greater labor adjustment costs. We use two variables to proxy the variation in adjustment costs: SOEs and labor-intensive firms. The employment decisions of SOEs are strongly affected by policy burden (Lin and Tan, 1999; Gu et al., 2020). Therefore, it is difficult for enterprises to lay off or recruit a large number of employees (e.g., quasi-official, limited positions) in a short time. SOE is an indicator variable that equals 1 for firms controlled the by government and O otherwise. The impact of digitalization on labor upgrading may be more salient for labor-intensive firms due to their abundant workforce that can quickly be upgraded during digitalization. However, a surplus in the workforce may suppress labor upgrading in labor-intensive enterprises because humans in labor-intensive firms have a comparative advantage over robots (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2019). Therefore, it is important to empirically investigate how digitalization affects labor upgrading in laborintensive enterprises. Labor intensity $(L I)$ is the number of employees divided by total assets for firm i in year t.  \n\nPanel A of Table 9 reports the regression results based on the labor adjustment cost perspective. As expected, the coefficients on $L N D T{\\times}S O E$ are significantly negative in columns (1) and (2) when the dependent variables are LNTECH and LNBACH, respectively. The coefficient is insignificantly negative in column (3) when the dependent variable is LNPROD. These results indicate that SOEs are even less likely to hire highly skilled and highly educated employees due to a lack of employee flexibility caused by policy burden. Policy burden also insignificantly reduces the number of production workers (Lin and Tan, 1999; Gu et al., 2020). However, the coefficienton $L N D T{\\times}L I$ is significantly positive in columns (4) and (5) when the dependent variables are LNTECH and LNBACH, respectively. The coefficient is insignificantly positive in column (6) when the dependent variable is LNPROD. These results suggest that digitalization promotes labor-intensive enterprises to hire more highly technical and educated workers relative to non-laborintensive enterprises. However, this effect is not seen when the dependent variable is LNPROD.  \n\n### 6.2. High technology  \n\nThe pace of digital transformation of enterprises may be affected by the level of a firm's technical talent reserves and acquired resources (Wu et al., 2022). High-tech enterprises possess more technical talent reserves and acquired resources relative to non-hightech enterprises. We further examine whether the effect of digitalization on labor upgrading is more pronounced in high-tech enterprises relative to non-high-tech enterprises. HIGHTEC is a dummy variable that equals 1 for firms categorized as high-tech by the government and O otherwise. We further include the interaction term LNDT $^{\\bullet}\\times$ HIGHTEC in the regression model.  \n\nThe results are reported in Panel B of Table 9. The coefficient on LNDT $\\cdot_{\\times}$ HIGHTEC is significantly positive in columns (1) and (2) when the dependent variables are LNTECH and LNBACH, respectively. The coefficient is significantly negative in column (3) when the dependent variable is LNPROD. These results reveal that enterprise digitalization has a more pronounced impact on labor upgrading in high-tech enterprises than in non-high-tech enterprises. Thus, high-tech enterprises have a strong incentive to adopt digital transformation and quickly update their labor force.  \n\n### 6.3. The effect of different regions  \n\nFinally, to investigate whether the digitalization of firms headquartered in different regions of China has different effects on labor upgrading, we construct a regression model according to whether an enterprise is headquartered in the eastern region of China (Wu et al., 2022). We define EAST as an indicator that equals 1 for firms that are headquartered in the eastern region and 0 otherwise (i.e., headquartered in the central or western regions).  \n\nThe results are reported in Panel C of Table 9. In contrast to the central and western areas, the coefficients on $L N D T\\times E A S T$ in columns (1) and (2) are positive and pronounced in the eastern region when the dependent variables are LNTECH and LNBACH, respectively. The coefficient is insignificantly negative in column (3) when the dependent variable is LNPROD. This reveals that enterprise digital transformation has a greater impact on labor upgrading in the eastern region than in the central and western areas. This may be because firms in the eastern region have relatively advanced digital technology and a richer workforce that digital firms urgentlyneed.  \n\n## 7. Conclusions  \n\nPrior literature mainly focuses on how the rise of digitalization technologies or RPA affects the labor market. In addition, extant studies often focus more attention on developed regions and countries such as Europe and the United States (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2020). Thus, there is a relative lack of direct evidence from developing countries. China, as the world's second-largest economy, is a typical representative of developing countries. A small number of studies have looked at robotics and artificial intelligence development in China and its economic impact (Cheng and Qu, 2020; Wu et al., 2022); however, they mainly focus on theoretical discussions and lack systematic empirical analyses. In this study, we fill this research gap by investigating how enterprise digitalization affects labor upgrading.  \n\nWe find that firms that have undergone a digital transformation have a greater demand for highly skilled and highly educated workers and a decreased demand for production workers. This indicates labor upgrading. We also find that digitalization helps firms to create an external labor demand for more skilled and highly educated labor, and promotes the additional training of existing employees. Further analyses show that digital transformation can improve labor investment efficiency and firm value (both book value and market value) of an enterprise only if the firm upgrades its labor force. Our study highlights the fact that the ability of firms to exploit digitalization successfully depends on a variety of complementary human capital and employee capabilities. In other words, the success of enterprise digitalization depends not only on digital assets but also on acquiring related human capabilities in the areas of digital technologies, digital networking, and big data analytics.  \n\n# CRediT authorship contribution statement  \n\nWencong Li: Data curation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review & editing.

We show firms with less information asymmetry have lower labor adjustment costs (LACs). Moreover, this relation is stronger for firms with lower financing constraints and stronger financial performance and growth, which suggests these attributes are particularly appealing to employees. Our difference-in-difference tests based on two exogenous asymmetric information shocks around broker mergers and closures, and decimalization indicate the link is likely causal. Finally, we show that LACs are an important channel through which information asymmetry impacts firm value.  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nWe consider whether a change in the information environment affects an index of three established proxies for labor adjustment costs (hereafter LACs). These costs, which include costs associated with adding and removing employees are a substantial expense for firms. Ghaly, Dang, and Stathopoulos (2017) note that LACs can equate to the oneyear payroll costs for the average worker. They are also an important economy-wide cost, which is reinforced by the Donangelo, Gourio, Kehrig, and Palacios (2019) observation that labor costs account for morethan $50\\%$ of GDP, and the fact that many advanced economies have shifted employment toward labor-intensive service industries in recent decades (e.g., Whited, 2019). However, the various components of LACs are difficult to measure (e.g., Golden, Mashruwala, & Pevzner, 2020) so proxies are used. We, therefore, adopt three LAC proxies from the literature and combine them to form a LAC Index.  \n\nA firm's information environment affects many aspects of corporate policies and there is reason to expect it to be a determinant of LACs. Hall and Lazaer (1984) note that information asymmetry is an important aspect of labor-firm relations given workers are not aware of all firmrelated information.? Firms operating in a poorer information environment are likely to find it more costly to attract new staff due to worker concerns about involuntary unemployment risk and its impact on their future earnings (e.g., Couch & Placzek, 201o). Hence, it seems most plausible that a reduction in information asymmetry reduces LACs. On the other hand, it is also possible that an improved information environment could increase LACs. For instance, if a reduction in opaqueness reveals information that is negative for employees (e.g., cash-flow shortage, competitive weakness, or poor workplace safety), firms may lose workers and find it more costly to attract new workers. This is consistent with the Ji and Tan (2016) finding that firms strategically modify their disclosure policies due to labor unemployment concerns. They are more likely to provide bad news forecasts when workers are likely to be less concerned about unemployment, especially when firms are financially constrained.  \n\nWe acknowledge that LACs are a broad concept relating to different stages in hiring, training, retaining, firing, and replacing an employee, which are difficult to quantify. Hence, we suggest that it is difficult to comprehensively capture LACs by a single metric. We, therefore, create a LAC Index based on three LAC proxies from the current literature. The first input (\\*\"Tightness Cost') is based on the return sensitivity to the labor market conditions. Kuehn, Simutin, and Wang (2017) show that firms with higher loadings on changes in the labor market tightness variable face higher LACs. The second component (\"Skills Cost\") follows Ghaly et al. (2017) and Golden et al. (2020) and relates to how highly skilled a firm's workers are. As the replacing process is more difficult for highly skilled positions, it is more costly for firms to fire skilled workers because of the likelihood of loss of firm-specific capital. The final factor (\"Hiring Cost\") is based on the hiring rate of new workers as Varejao and Portugal (2007, p. 162) note that “adjustment costs do influence the frequency of adjustment” with adjustment more likely in workforces with more temporary workers and low-tenure workers (where LACs are lower). We calculate the LAC Index using an approach that is similar to the method Lang, Lins, and Maffett (2012) use to construct their transparency index. We first rank firms based on Tightness Cost, Skills Cost, and Hiring Cost into percentile ranks yearly and then take the average of these across the three rank variables to construct the LAC Index.  \n\nWe follow Maskara and Mullineaux (2011) and form an index based on information asymmetry proxies that capture different aspects of a firm's information environment. The components of the information asymmetry index comprise of the market- and accounting-based proxies including (1) a measure of the responsiveness of stock prices to earnings changes, (2) the number of analysts following a firm, (3) the forecast dispersion of analyst estimates,(4) firm size,(5） the readability of financial statements, (6) a price delay measure, (7) serial correlation in stock returns, (8) the Llorente, Michaely, Saar, and Wang (2002) measure of information asymmetry, and (9) the bid-ask spread. We follow the Lang et al. (2012) index computation approach to calculate our information quality index (Info_Qual Index) by ranking firms for each of the nine variables into percentile ranks on a yearly basis and then taking the average of these across the nine variables.3 The percentile rank approach has two benefits. First, the three labor adjustment cost measures have a different unit of measurement so the aggregation using their raw values would introduce the biased index with higher weighting toward measures with a high unit of measurement. The percentile rank approach solves this issue and can create an unbiased index of the three measures. Second, the percentile rank approach reduces the impact of outliers on the analysis.  \n\nWhile our LAC Index is based on established LAC measures from the literature, we acknowledge that it is not a definitive measure of the true LACs faced by firms. Therefore regardless of whether we refer to our results on the LAC Index or, for brevity, just LACs we are referring to the LAC Index measure we use in this paper. We leave it to the reader to decide whether the results are generalizable to other aspects of LACs. To that end, our results indicate there is a negative and statistically significant relation between information quality and the LAC Index. Firms with better information quality have lower LACs even after controlling for a comprehensive list of firm characteristics that may be correlated with both of the variables of interest, including size, profitability, leverage, liquidity (i.e., cash holdings), tangibility, growth potential (i. e., research and development expenditure), and labor intensity. Moreover, the effect is not sensitive to the inclusion of year and industry/firm fixed effects to account for macro-economic conditions and timeinvariant industry/firm factors which possibly drive LACs. In a robustness check, we use the inverse bid-ask spread as a proxy for information quality with larger sample size and find consistent evidence.  \n\nOur result holds in general but is stronger when the increased information quality occurs in firms with lower financing constraints and better financial performance and growth prospects. This suggests that employees view companies with these attributes as more appealing workplaces. It is likely that employees perceiving these firms to have a high chance of success, and hence have a lower risk of having to fire staff or more ability to pay higher wages. We also show that LACs are a channel through which information asymmetry impacts firm value. In particular, increases in information quality improve firm value but this effect is more (less) pronounced if LACs are low (high).  \n\nOur findings thus far, despite being robust, can at best only reveal a negative correlation (not causation) between the quality of a firm's information environment and its LACs. To better establish causality we examine two exogenous shocks to information asymmetry in a difference-in-difference setting. First, we use the natural experiment of Kelly and Ljungqvist (2012) involving broker closures. Analysts reduce information asymmetry by collecting and disseminating information from private and public sources (e.g. Brennan & Subrahmanyam, 1995; Lang, Lins, & Miller, 2003, 2004). We also use broker mergers, which are first used by Hong and Kacperczyk (2010). As Chen and Lin (2017) note, broker mergers are typically followed by a reduction in broker number due to analysts being fired. Second, we treat the move to decimalization in 2001 as an exogenous information asymmetry shock. Decimalization improves liquidity (e.g., Fang, Noe, & Tice, 2009) and liquidity increases encourage larger shareholdings and block formation (e.g., Edmans, 2009), which in turn, leads to greater management disclosure and less information asymmetry (e.g., Boone & White, 2015). Edmans and Manso (2011) show that liquidity makes blockholders more effective monitors through disciplinary trading, which results in the more managerial effort. The threat of blockholder exit is an important consideration for management (e.g., Bharath, Jayaraman, & Nagar, 2013; Edmans,Fang, & Zur, 2013).  \n\nThe difference-in-difference (DiD) results show that an increase in asymmetric information following broker closures and mergers causes an increase in LACs of treated firms relative to their control firm counterparts. The treated (control) firms are those that are (not) impacted by broker closures and mergers. Likewise, the decimalization-induced decline in asymmetric information results in a reduction in the LACs of treated firms relative to control firms. The treated (control) firms are those that experience the most (least) improvements in liquidity and reductions in information asymmetry following the decimalization. Note that in both DiD analyses we use the propensity score matching (PSM) technique to ensure treated and control firms have similar control characteristics immediately before entering an experiment. We, therefore, are more confident the observed relative changes in treated firms' LACs are most likely due to their changes in information quality around thetreatment shock.  \n\nWe contribute to two strands of the literature. The first is literature regarding the impacts of the information environment on firms. Billett, Garfinkel, and Yu (2017) find weaker industry-adjusted sales growth follows an increase in information asymmetry. Chen and Lin (2017) find increases in information asymmetry results in more aggressive tax avoidance, while Li, Li, Lin, and Zhan (2019) find an increase in information asymmetry causes firms to shift from equity and public debt financing to bank debt. Kim, Lu, and Yu (2018) show that increased information asymmetry increases firm expected crash risk. Our study extends the understanding in this area by showing a significant influence of information quality on a firm's relationship with one of its most important stakeholders, i.e., employees. In particular, we argue and provide evidence that an improved information environment facilitates the hiring, retaining, and hiring process, which leads to lower LACs in general. Given the heavy burdens of LACs on a firm's resources, such a reduction in this kind of cost is warmly welcomed by shareholders in the form of higher firm value.  \n\nThe second is literature on the link between corporate finance and labor market outcomes. Michaels, Page, and Whited (2019) find that increased financing costs lead to a reduction in employment and wages. Benmelech, Frydman, and Papanikolaou (2019) document that difficulties in accessing credit caused a large proportion of the decline in employment during the Great Depression. Caggese, Cunat, and Metzger (2019) suggest that financing constraints distort the trade-off between firing and hiring costs and worker productivity, resulting in firms choosing tofire workers with a short tenure even if they have high future expected productivity. Prabowo, Hoogiemstra, and Veen-dirks (2018) find that managers of state-owned enterprises can be influenced by the state when making decisions about laying off employees when sales decline. We add to this emerging literature by documenting a crucial role of a firm's information quality which enhances its success in adjusting labor forces. The effect is even more pronounced if the increased transparency reveals financially favorable news that is of the employee interests, such as high financial strength and growth opportunities. Our identification of information asymmetry based on two plausibly exogenous shocks (around decimalization, and broker mergers and closures)boosts our confidence that the link between information environment and LACs is likely causal.  \n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides more detail on LACs and the relation between LACs and information asymmetry. Section 3 contains a description of the data, variables, and descriptive statistics. The results are presented in Section 4, while Section 5 concludes the paper.  \n\n## 2. Related literature  \n\n### 2.1. Labor adjustment costs  \n\nThere are different dimensions to LACs with no single measure capturing all aspects of the costs incurred by firms when there are personnel changes. The LAC literature, which dates back to Oi (1962) has, to date, used many LAC proxies. Cross-country studies typically use variation in employment protection legislation (EPL) provisions as these are a useful source of variation in the firing cost dimension of LACs. For instance, Banker, Byzalov, and Chen (2013) find that cost stickiness at the firm level varies with the strictness of EPL provisions at the country level. Within country LAC studies have, in recent times, typically used one of three LAC proxies. In this paper, we create an index based on all three measures. Kuehn et al. (2017) suggest that the impact of changes in the tightness of the labor market on a firm's stock returns is an indication of that company's LACs. When the labor market tightens and the number of job vacancies to the number of unemployed workers decreases, all firms find it more difficult to attract new staff. However, some firms find it more difficult than others. It is these firms that have higher LACs relative to their peers. We refer to this LAC proxy as TightnessCost.  \n\nThe intuition behind the second LAC measure (Skills Cost) is anchored in the notion that firms with more highly skilled staff face higher LACs (e.g., Ghaly et al., 2017). For example, the skills required to be an effective cleaner are more prevalent to the general workforce than the skills required to be an effective nuclear physicist so a company looking to fill a nuclear physicist position finds it more challenging (and incurs higher LACs) than a company looking to recruit a new cleaner.  \n\nThe third LAC measure is Hiring Cost. Many factors influence the hiring activity of companies. For instance, firms that are growing rapidly will likely look to hire more staff than firms that have stable levels of sales. However, there is evidence (e.g., Varejao & Portugal, 2007) that LACs are one factor that influences the hiring activity of firms. Firms that have difficulties searching for and training new staff are less likely to hire new staff than firms that are identical in all respects but have lower LACs.  \n\n### 2.2. Asymmetric information and labor adjustment costs  \n\nInformation asymmetry is an important principle in financial economics with far-reaching implications. Akerlof (1970) describes the impact of a mismatch of information around second-hand car quality between sellers and buyers and the implications of “lemons” on the functioning of markets. Hall and Lazaer (1984) point out that information asymmetry is an important aspect of labor-firm relations. Firms do know ex-ante the productivity of their workers and workers are not aware of all firm-related information, which can create uncertainty regarding their employment. Wesp and Dickersin (2010) suggest that firms use signing bonuses to help mitigate employee concerns and signal that they believe the employee will be a good “fit' for the firm, while Xu and Yang (2016) find that larger signing bonuses are evident in firms with greater information asymmetry. The existence of organized labor also plays a role in the information environment. Kenno and Free (2018) show that unions and management use accounting information to further their interests in negotiations. Hilary (2006) finds that strong organized labor is associated with higher information asymmetry in the form of larger bid-ask spreads, which they suggest is due to management's reluctance to reveal information that weakens their position in collective bargaining. Moreover, Bova (2013) finds unionized firms are more likely to disclose negative information and miss targets. More recently,Aobdia and Cheng (2018) show that non-unionized firms operating in unionized industries engage in the strategic disclosure of good news when their unionized competitors are engaging in labor renegotiations. We contribute to this literature around the impact of asymmetric information on labor in many ways. First, we focus on the impact that asymmetric information exerts on LACs across the entire firm rather than one dimension of LACs, such as signing bonuses for a group of workers. Second, we use accepted shocks to the information environment which allows us to reach conclusions about causality.  \n\nOur paper also sits within a broader literature regarding the impact of asymmetric information on firms and markets. Copeland and Galai (1983) and Glosten and Milgrom (1985) show that asymmetric information impacts the cost of trading, and Kelly and Ljungqvist (2012) suggest this is the main channel through which information asymmetry impacts asset pricing. Asymmetric information also impacts the cost of capital. Easley and O'Hara (2004) find investors require a larger return to hold stocks when there is greater private information, while Lee and Masulis (2009) show that poor accounting quality is associated with higher SEO flotation costs due to higher uncertainty about the firm's financial condition. Billet and Yu (2016) show that open-market share repurchases result in much larger positive abnormal returns in opaque firms than transparent firms.  \n\n## 3. Data, variable measurement, and descriptive statistics  \n\n### 3.1. Measuring labor adjustment costs  \n\nWe include all common stocks listed on NYSE, Nasdaq, and Amex from CRSP in our sample and provide all variable definitions in Appendix 1. The LAC proxy we consider is a LAC Index based on Tightness Cost, Skills Cost, and Hiring Cost. Following Kuehn et al. (2017), Labor Market Tightness is calculated by dividing the vacancy index by the product of the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate. The monthly labor force participation and unemployment rates are from the Current Population Survey of the Bureau of Labor Statistics,5 while the vacancy index is from the Conference Board. We then regress each stock's excess return on the market excess return and the change in Labor Market Tightness and measure Labor Market Tightness Sensitivity as the coefficient of the Labor Market Tightness variable. Firms that experience the lowest return when the labor market is tight (i.e., those with negative Labor Market Tightness Sensitivity coefficients) have the largest LACs. However, for consistency across our LAC proxies, we report the negative of Labor Market Tightness Sensitivity (Tightness Cost) which has a positive relation with LACs.6  \n\nThe second LAC Index input is the Labor Skills Index, which as Ghaly et al. (2017) note, is an industry-level index (p. 3643) \"that measures the weighted-average skill level of the occupations within an industry, ranging from one to five.\" The index is calculated using OES data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics7 and the U.S. Department of Labor $\\mathsf{O}^{*}\\mathrm{NET}$ occupation classification based on skill levels.8 The Labor Skills Index is calculated by the industry as follows: First, the number of employees in each of five job “zones” is counted, where zone 1 includes roles that require little skill, and zone 5 covers roles that require an extensive skill. Second, the number of employees in each zone is multiplied by the job zone classification number (1 to 5). Third, this product is divided by the total number of employees in the industry. As Belo, Li, Lin, and Zhao (2017) highlight, various aspects of the employment process, including worker screening and selection, are more difficult in jobs with requirements for specialist skills so there is a positive relation between the Labor Skills Index (Skills Cost) and LACs.  \n\nThe third LAC Index factor is based on the Hiring Rate. We obtain the Compustat employee number data (item EMP) and divide the change in employee numbers by the number of employees at the start of the period to arrive at the Hiring Rate. Varejao and Portugal (2007) point out that labor force adjustments are less likely in workplaces with more skilled  \n\n2003). Third, companies that prepare more readable financial statements have a better information environment, so we follow Loughran and McDonald (2014) and measure readability based on the file size of firm1o-K disclosures (File_Size),wherelowerlevels of File_Sizeindicate more readability. Companies are likely to be more efficiently priced if they are more transparent, so we include the Hou & Moskowitz (2005) price delay measure (Delay) and also the serial correlation in stock returns (Corr) to capture pricing efficiency. Larger firms tend to be more efficiently priced and more transparent, so we also include a proxy for firm size (Size) (e.g., Lesmond, Schill, & Zhou, 2004). We also include the Llorente et al. (2002) measure of information asymmetry (LMSW). Last, we include bid-ask spreads (Spread) as more transparent firms can be expected to have lower spreads (e.g., Diamond & Verrecchia, 1991). We multiply these variables by $^{-1}$ where appropriate to ensure that higher values always indicate higher information quality then, following Lang et al. (2012), we compute the Info_Qual Index by ranking firms for each of the nine variables into percentile ranks every year and then taking the average of these across the nine variables as per Eq. (2). Note that, similar to the construction of the LAC Index,we divide all the rank variables by 1oo before taking the average so that all variables in Eq. (2) including Info_Qual Index are bounded between zero and one, which facilitates the presentation of estimation results.  \n\nInfo-Qual Index $=$ [Trans-Earns Rank + Num-Analysts Rank +(- 1) × Analyst-Disp Rank +(- 1) × File_Size Rank +(- 1) × Delay Rank +(- 1) × Corr Rank+ Size Rank+(- 1) × LLSW Rank+(- 1) × Spread Rank] /9  \n\nworkers and higher LACs. This results in a negative relation between Hiring Rate and LACs, so we report the negative of Hiring Rate (Hiring Cost), which has a positive relation with LACs. We acknowledge that LACs are a broad item and more or less unobservable. Our measures, therefore, are imperfect proxies individually but supplement each other in capturing different aspects of $L A C s$ and demonstrating the robustness ofourresults.  \n\nWe calculate the LAC Index using an approach that is similar to the method Lang et al. (2012) use to construct their transparency index, as shown in Eq. (1) below:  \n\nLACIndex $=$ [Tightness Cost Rank + Skills Cost Rank $^+$ Hiring Cost Rank]/3  \n\nWe first rank firms based on Tightness Cost, Skills Cost, and Hiring Cost into percentile ranks on a yearly basis and then scale the percentile ranks by 1o0 before taking the average of these across the three variables. All the variables included in Eq. (1) are, therefore, bounded between zero andone.  \n\n### 3.2. Information quality  \n\nWe follow Maskara and Mullineaux (2011) and form an information quality index. We include nine proxies. Barth, Konchitchki, and Landsman (2013) note that more transparent companies have faster stock price reactions to earnings changes and develop a measure (Trans_Earns) to capture this, where higher levels of Trans_Earns indicate improved information quality. This is our first proxy. Second, we follow Lang et al. (2012) and include analyst measures. Firms with more analysts following them (Num_Analysts) and less dispersion in analyst estimates (Analyst Disp) are less informationally opaque (e.g., Roulstone,  \n\n### 3.3. Natural experiments  \n\nWe investigate the existence of a causal link between the information environment and LACs using two exogenous shocks to asymmetric information. As Jiang (2017) notes, exogenous shocks that happen naturally are a superior mechanism to the instrumental variable approach which is widely used in the literature. First, we use the broker closure natural experiment of Kelly and Ljungqvist (2012) and broker mergers as per Hong and Kacperczyk (2010). Kelly and Ljungqvist (2012) suggest that decisions around broker firm closures are independent of the prospects of the firms followed by the brokers and are, therefore, exogenous. Our broker closure sample is as per Chen and Lin (2017).9 This includes 30 brokerage closures impacting 1425 stocks over the 2000-2010 period. The sample is derived from searching the IBES database for a list of brokers who exit and then searching Factiva to confirm the disappearance is due to the closure. This is then complemented with the list of broker closures provided by Kelly and Ljungqvist (2012).  \n\nBroker mergers typically result in a reduction in broker number (e.g., Chen & Lin, 2017), so these events can expectedly lead to a reduction in coverage and an increase in asymmetric information. Our broker merger sample is also from Chen and Lin (2017). This is generated by searching the Thomson Reuters SDC M&A database for transactions where both the acquirer and target primary Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes are6211 or6282 and $100\\%$ of the target is acquired. The acquirer and target names are then matched with the broker names in IBEs. This results in a sample of 24 merger events. Following Chen and Lin (2017) we group broker merger and closure samples and generate results for 54 broker exits. We also impose the restrictions of requiring the firms covered by the brokers who close. To remain in the IBES sample in year t $^{+1}$ , and for broker mergers, we only include firms that are covered by both the acquirer and target broker before the merger and by the merged entity following the merger.  \n\nOur second asymmetric information shock is the 2o01 move to decimalization. This improves liquidity (e.g., Fang et al., 2009) and improved liquidity makes a company more attractive to large shareholders and those wanting to form blocks (e.g., Edmans, 2009). This typically leads to less information asymmetry (e.g., Boone & White, 2015), as the threat of blockholder exit is an important consideration for management (e.g., Bharath et al., 2013). As Brogaard, Li, and Xia (2017) note, the SEC required all U.S. stock markets to convert all quotes from fractional pricing (the previous minimum increment had been 1/16 of a dollar) to decimal pricing with a minimum price change of $\\$0.01$ by April 2001. This event is well suited to our analysis as while liquidity, in general, improved following decimalization (e.g., Bessembinder, 2003), there is a larger cross-sectional variation in the liquidity improvement across stocks (e.g., Brogaard et al., 2017).  \n\nWhile decimalization is a static single shock that exogenously reduces asymmetric information, the broker closures and mergers are staggered multiple shocks that exogenously increase asymmetric information. Hence, the two shocks together help establish the robustness of the results and boost the confidence in our causal interpretation. Finally, we use a short window before and after each of the three shocks as significant changes in unobserved variables are less likely to simultaneously occur over shorter windows.  \n\n### 3.4. Control variables  \n\nWe include many control variables including Size, which is the natural logarithm of total assets; ROA, which is the ratio of operating income before depreciation to total assets; Leverage, which is the ratio of total debt to total assets; Cash, which is the ratio of cash to total assets; PPE, which is the ratio of property, plant and equipment to total assets; R&D, which is the ratio of research and development expenditure to total assets10; and Employees, which is the number of employees to total assets. We carefully select these control variables which are likely  \n\nTable 1 Summary statistics.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variable</td><td>Obs</td><td>Mean</td><td>Std.Dev.</td><td>P25</td><td>P75</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">PanelA:LACvariable</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>LACIndex</td><td>21,806</td><td>0.505</td><td>0.165</td><td>0.390</td><td>0.617</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">PanelB:InformationQualityvariable</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Info_QualIndex PanelC:Controlvariables</td><td>23,763</td><td>0.563</td><td>0.111</td><td>0.487</td><td>0.646</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Size 64,679</td><td>4.594</td><td>7.592</td></tr><tr><td>ROA</td><td>64,679</td><td>6.146 0.027</td><td>2.159 0.353</td><td>0.016</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td>64,679</td><td>0.216</td><td>0.247</td><td>0.014</td><td>0.150</td></tr><tr><td>Cash</td><td>64,679</td><td>0.207</td><td>0.232</td><td>0.035</td><td>0.334</td></tr><tr><td>PPE</td><td>64,679</td><td>0.234</td><td>0.243</td><td></td><td>0.302</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>0.058</td><td>0.135</td><td>0.045</td><td>0.352</td></tr><tr><td>R&D</td><td>64,679</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.000</td><td>0.059</td></tr><tr><td>Employees</td><td>64,679</td><td>5.255</td><td>8.804</td><td>1.010</td><td>5.991</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table contains summary statistics for the LAC index, the asymmetric information index, and control variables. The data covers the 1999-2016 period. The LAC Index is based on the rank of firms into Tightness Cost, Skills Cost, and Hiring Cost percentiles. The Info_Qual Index is a proxy for information quality based on nine variables. Size is the natural logarithm of total assets. ROA is the ratio of operating income before depreciation to total assets. Leverage is the ratio of total debt to total assets.Cashis the ratio of cash to total assets.PPE is the ratio of property, plant and equipment to total assets. $R\\mathcal{\\&}D$ is the ratio of research and development expenditure to total assets.

For example, firms with bigger size and higher profitability may have both higher transparency and lower LACs at the same time. These data are sourced fromCompustat.  \n\nOur analysis commences in 1999. As Ghaly et al. (2017) note, the $\\mathsf{O}^{*}\\mathrm{NET}$ program uses the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) taxonomy to define occupations. However, the OES data set only began to use the same S0C taxonomy in 1999. Our final year is 2016, except for Tightness Cost as we use the vacancy rate data from Kuehn et al. (2017), which is only updated through to the end of 2014.  \n\nThe summary statistics reported in Table 1 indicate that the LAC Index has a mean of 0.505 and a relatively high standard deviation of 0.165, while the Info_Qual Index has a mean of 0.563 and a standard deviation of 0.111. There are sizable differences in the variation of the control variables with ROA having a standard deviation of 0.353 compared to a mean of 0.027, while Size has a standard deviation of just 2.159 compared to a mean of 6.146.  \n\n## 4. Results  \n\nIn this section, we present a regression analysis that establishes whether there is a relation between information quality and the LACs Index. We then consider possible factors that may influence the information quality - LAC Index relation. Previous papers document a link between information quality and firm value so in the third section, we consider whether LACs play a role in this. Finally, we use two natural experiments to determine whether there is a causal link between information quality and LACs.  \n\nTable2 Regressions of LAC index on information quality index.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>LACIndex</td><td>LACIndex</td><td>LACIndex</td><td>LACIndex</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Info_QualIndex</td><td>-0.123***</td><td>-0.146***</td><td>-0.148***</td><td>-0.092***</td></tr><tr><td>[0.00]</td><td>[0.00]</td><td>[0.00]</td><td>[0.00]</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>0.008***</td><td>0.011***</td><td>0.011***</td><td>-0.029***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">ROA</td><td>[0.00]</td><td>[0.00]</td><td>[0.00]</td><td>[0.00]</td></tr><tr><td>-0.067***</td><td>-0.070***</td><td>-0.090***</td><td>-0.134***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Leverage</td><td>[0.00]</td><td>[0.00]</td><td>[0.00]</td><td>[0.00]</td></tr><tr><td>-0.040***</td><td>-0.046***</td><td>-0.028***</td><td>-0.008</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Cash</td><td>[0.00]</td><td>[0.00]</td><td>[0.01]</td><td>[0.64]</td></tr><tr><td>0.048***</td><td>0.055***</td><td>0.029***</td><td>0.080***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">PPE</td><td>[0.00]</td><td>[0.00]</td><td>[0.01]</td><td>[0.00]</td></tr><tr><td>-0.056***</td><td>-0.058***</td><td>0.010 [0.39]</td><td>0.132***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">R&D</td><td>[0.00]</td><td>[0.00]</td><td></td><td>[0.00]</td></tr><tr><td>0.145***</td><td>0.147***</td><td>0.134***</td><td>0.017 [0.73]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Employees</td><td>[0.00]</td><td>[0.00]</td><td>[0.00]</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>-0.002***</td><td>-0.002***</td><td>-0.001***</td><td>-0.003***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Year FE</td><td>[0.00]</td><td>[0.00]</td><td>[0.00]</td><td>[0.00]</td></tr><tr><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Industry FE</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Firm FE</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>9391</td><td>9391</td><td>9389</td><td>9020</td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted R-</td><td>0.082</td><td>0.096</td><td>0.188</td><td>0.397</td></tr><tr><td>squared</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table contains level regression results for LAC Index against the information quality index(Info_Qual Index)and control variables.The data covers the 1999-2016 period. The LAC Index is based on the rank of firms into Tightness Cost, Skills Cost, and Hiring Cost percentiles. The Info_Qual Index is a proxy for information quality based on nine variables. Size is the natural logarithm of total assets. ROA is the ratio of operating income before depreciation to total assets. Leverage is the ratio of total debt tototal assets.Cash is the ratio of cash to total assets. PPE is the ratio of property, plant and equipment to total assets. R&D is the ratio of research and development expenditure to total assets. Employees are the number of employees to total assets. P-values based on robust standard errors are reported in square brackets, and \\*, \\*\\*, and $^{***}$ indicate statistical significance at $10\\%$ $5\\%$ and $1\\%$ levels, respectively.  \n\n### 4.1. Information quality and LACs: Panel regression analysis  \n\nThe regression results that we use to establish whether there is a link between information quality and LACs are generated with the following specification:  \n\n$$\nL A C I n d e x_{i,t}=\\alpha+\\beta I n f o\\_Q u a l I n d e x_{i,t}+\\gamma C o n t r o l s_{i,t}+\\varepsilon_{i,t},\n$$  \n\nThe controls are Size, ROA, Leverage, Cash, PPE, R&D, and Employees. The subscripts $i,$ and t represent firms and years, respectively. We run various specifications including year, industry, and firm fixed effects to control for macro-economic conditions as well as the time-invariant firm characteristics that may affect LACs.Table 2 results indicate there is a negative and statistically significant relation between the LAC Index and information quality.11 We also re-run Eq. (3) with Tightness Cost, Skills Cost, and Hiring Cost (raw values) in place of the LAC Index. These results, which are reported in Appendix 4, show consistent results for the Skills Cost and Hiring Cost proxies. Data limitations mean that the Info_Qual Index cannot be calculated for some firms, so we also run a regression using the inverse bid-ask spread as a single proxy for information quality. Appendix 5 results indicate that larger inverse spreads are associated with a lower LAC Index, which is further evidence of a negative relation between information quality and LACs. Our sample includes the global financial crisis during the years 2008 and 2009, so we generate results to determine whether this has an impact. In Eq. (3) we include a dummy variable, GFC, that equals 1 for months in the global financial crisis and 0 otherwise. The results in Appendix 6 show that LACs are higher during the global financial crisis but the crisis has no impact on the relation between information quality and LACs.12  \n\nThe negative relation between information quality and LACs suggests that firms with poorer information environments can expect to find it more difficult to retain and attract workers. This is consistent with the notion that employees are concerned about their future job security and earnings when they are uncertain about the financial health of their employer. The negative information quality - LAC relation points against LACs being lower in firms with weaker information environments and the explanations that could support this. These may include it being a benefit that employees do not know the true condition of the firm if this is generally negative. Alternatively, a more opaque environment may be seen as a positive from the perspective of their being less risk of competitors obtaining firm intellectual property and this having an impact on firm profitability and their ability to maintain staffinglevels.  \n\n### 4.2.Possible factors influencing the information quality -LAC index relation  \n\nIn this section, we consider whether financing constraints, financial performance, and firm growth influence the relation between asymmetric information and the LAC Index. As Bushman and Smith (2001) note, transparency around financial accounting information reveals both good and bad opportunities for potential and current employees to invest their human capital. Indeed, such employee behaviors come with no surprise because Brown and Matsa (2016) document that job seekers carefully base their decisions on the potential employers’ financial conditions, and firms with financial difficulties (i.e., distress) experience a reduction in both quantity and quality of job applicants. It is, therefore, possible that information environment improvement leading to the revelation of less financial constraints, stronger firm performance, and greater firm growth makes employees more likely to join and less likely to leave a company, resulting in a greater impact of information quality increases onLACs.  \n\nPapers such as Michaels et al. (2019) find that financial constraints impact wages and employment. Employees are therefore likely to be more attracted to firms with low financing constraints due to them perceiving these companies to offer more stable employment prospects and better opportunities for increased wages. Improved information quality that reveals this information would therefore be expected to lead to a larger reduction in LACs.  \n\nWe use three proxies for financial constraints, including the size and age (SA) index of Hadlock and Pierce (2010), the Whited and Wu (2006) (WW) index, and the Kaplan and Zingales (1997) (KZ) index.13 We define firms with SA, WW, and KZ indices above the median (SA High, WW High, and KZ High, respectively) as being financially constrained. SA Low, WW Low, and KZ Low firms with indices below the median are defined as unconstrained. Table 3 results indicate that the negative relation between LAC and information quality is more pronounced in firms with less financial constraints based on both the KZ and Ww indices. For instance, as the KZ index moves from below to above the median the joint impact with the effect of Info_Qual Index on LAC Index increasesby $24\\%$ (0.022/0.093).  \n\nFirms generating stronger current financial performance and growth may be more appealing to current and potential employees. We measure financial performance as return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), and return on sales (ROs), and growth as asset growth, sales growth, and research and development (R&D) expenditure. The results in Table 3 Panels B and C indicate the impact of information quality on LACs is stronger when the improved information quality reveals stronger financial performance and growth. Our results indicate that increased information quality is associated with a larger reduction in LACs in firms where transparency reveals less financial constraints, better financial performance, and faster growth. However, improved information quality that reveals firms with more financial constraints, and weaker performance and growth does not increase LACs.  \n\n### 4.3.Firm value  \n\nThere is evidence that firm information quality is linked to value. For instance, Lang et al. (2012) show improved transparency is reflected in higher firm valuation and suggest that firm transparency is particularly important in the presence of other factors such as concentrated ownership. Diamond and Verrecchia (1991) suggest that increased disclosure can reduce a firm's cost of capital due to increased demand from large investors, and, given the inverse relation between cost of capital and  \n\nTable3 Financing constraints, performance, growth and the information quality -

The data covers the 1999-2016 period. The LAC Index is based on the rank of firms into Tightness Cost, Skills Cost, and Hiring Cost percentiles. The Info_Qual Index is a proxy for information quality based on nine variables. In Panel A, SA refers to the size and age index of Hadlock and Pierce (2010), WW refers to the Whited and Wu (2006) index, and KZis the Kaplan and Zingales (1997) index. In Panel B, ROA, ROE, and ROS refer to return on assets, return on equity, and return on sales respectively. In Panel C, Asset Growth and Sales Growth are the yearly percentage change in total assets and sales, respectively, while R&D is research and development expenditure scaled by total assets.Each firm variable is denoted High (Low)ifit is above (below)the median. $P$ -values based on robust standard errors are reported in square brackets, and $^*$ $^{**}$ , and $\\yen8$ indicate statistical significance at $10\\%$ ， $5\\%$ ,and $1\\%$ levels, respectively.  \n\nvaluation, this suggests that increased disclosure should be associated with increases in firm value.  \n\nWe consider whether LACs also influence the information quality - firm value relation using an approach similar to Lins, Servaes, and Tamayo (2017).

The control variables used by Fang et al. (2009) are also included.

The data covers the 1999-2016 period. The LAC Index is based on the rank of firms into Tightness Cost, Skills Cost, and Hiring Cost percentiles. The Info_Qual Index is a proxy for information quality based on nine variables. In each instance, the sample is split based on the median LAC Index, and results are generated for high and low groups. Q is the ratio of market value of assets (MVA) to book value of assets (BVA), where MVA is defined as the market value of equity plus BVA minus the book value of equity and minus balance sheet deferred taxes. DUM_SP500 is a dummy variable that equals 1 if a firm is in the S&P 500 index and O otherwise. LOG_AGE is the log of firm age. LOG_BVTA is the log of book value divided by total assets. IDIORISK is a firm idiosyncratic risk. LOG_#ANALYSTS is the log of the number of analysts following the firm. CUMRET is the stock's six-month return momentum. P-values based on robust standard errors are reported in square brackets, and \\*, \\*\\*, and $\\yen8$ indicate statistical significance at $10\\%$ $5\\%$ and $1\\%$ levels, respectively.  \n\n(DUM_SP500), the log of firm age (LOG_AGE), the log of book value divided by total assets (LOG_BVTA), firm idiosyncratic risk (IDIORISK), the log of the number of analysts following the firm (LOG #ANALYSTS), and the stock's six-month return momentum (CUMRET).14  \n\nThe results in Table 4 confirm that information quality is positively associated with firm value and show that this positive correlation is more (less) pronounced for firms with relatively low (high) LACs. For example, as the LAC Index decreases from above to below the median level, the positive effect of the Info_Qual Index on Q increases by 0.249 from 1.567 to 1.816 (in firm fixed effect model), or an increase of $16\\%$ $(=0.249/1.567)$ in firm value. The results indicate that LACs are a channel through which information quality impacts firm value.  \n\n### 4.1. DiD analysis  \n\nIn an attempt to establishing the causality between information quality and LACs, we now use the staggered broker closures and mergers and the 2001 decimalization described in section 3.3 as exogenous shocks to information quality. In this section, the results generated by the DiD method has at least two advantages over the standard regression analysis. First, it guards against the possibility of an omitted variable influencing  both  asymmetric  information and $L A C s;$ hence,being responsible for a spurious relation in the regression analysis. Second, the DiD approach allows us to establish whether there is a causal relation between asymmetric information and LACs and rule out the possibility of reverse causality.  \n\nWe begin by considering whether the two shocks we utilize have an impact on information quality using the following DiD regression:  \n\n$$\nI n f o.Q u a l I n d e x_{i,t}=\\alpha+\\beta_{l}T r e a t e d^{\\ast}P o s t+\\beta_{2}T r e a t e d+\\beta_{3}P o s t+\\gamma C o n t r o l s_{i,t}+\\varepsilon_{i,t}\n$$  \n\nwhere Treated is a dummy variable that equals one (zero) if a firm is in the treated (control) group. We apply propensity score matching (PSM) using the controls of Size, ROA,Leverage, Cash, PPE, R&D,and Employees measured in the year immediately before the event year. The predicted probabilities or propensity scores are then used to match firms in the two groups, with each firm in the treated group matched to a firm with the same three-digit SIC code in the control group with a propensity score within 0.01 caliper without replacement. Post is a dummy variable that is equal to one for the post exogenous asymmetric information shock (either the broker mergers and closures or the decimalization) year and zero for the pre-shock year. Treated\\*Post is an interaction variable that captures the change in information quality of treated firms relative to that of control firms in the post-shock year compared to the pre-shock year and the controls.  \n\nTo ensure an accurate test, we require treated and matched control firms to have similar firm characteristics before the exogenous shocks but a different degree of change in asymmetric information after the shocks. The results in Table 5 Panel A indicate that we can reject the null hypothesis that firm characteristics are statistically significantly different before the exogenous shock. For broker mergers and closures, the treatment group consists of firms experiencing a reduction in broker coverage (i.e., those who lose coverage by at least one analyst due to the brokerage house closures and mergers) and a corresponding increase in asymmetric information. The control group contains firms with no change in broker coverage (i.e., those who do not experience any analyst loss) or asymmetric information. Our definitions of treated and control firms in the broker mergers and closures settings are consistent with those adopted in prior studies (e.g. Billett et al., 2017; Chen & Lin, 2017; Li et al., 2019).  \n\nIn the decimalization sample, the treatment group is made up of companies with the largest improvement in liquidity (i.e., top tercile of  \n\nTable5 PSM match and exogenous information quality shock.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"7\">Panel A:PSM Match Quality</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Treated</td><td>Control</td><td>P-value</td><td>Treated</td><td>Control</td><td>P-value</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"3\">Broker Closures &Mergers</td><td colspan=\"3\">Decimalization</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>6.619</td><td>6.692</td><td>0.48</td><td>5.466</td><td>5.273</td><td>0.10</td></tr><tr><td>ROA</td><td>0.075</td><td>0.056</td><td>0.29</td><td>0.036</td><td>0.024</td><td>0.58</td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td>0.191</td><td>0.196</td><td>0.57</td><td>0.204</td><td>0.185</td><td>0.50</td></tr><tr><td>Cash</td><td>0.245</td><td>0.236</td><td>0.46</td><td>0.241</td><td>0.248</td><td>0.78</td></tr><tr><td>PPE</td><td>0.260</td><td>0.290</td><td>0.25</td><td>0.212</td><td>0.213</td><td>0.98</td></tr><tr><td>R&D</td><td>0.065</td><td>0.064</td><td>0.11</td><td>0.087</td><td>0.078</td><td>0.50</td></tr><tr><td>Employees</td><td>6.554</td><td>6.246</td><td>0.12</td><td>6.122</td><td>7.061</td><td>0.39</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nPanel B: Information Quality Shock   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Broker Closures&Mergers</td><td>Decimalization</td></tr><tr><td>Treated*Post</td><td>-0.020**[0.04]</td><td>0.081***[0.00]</td></tr><tr><td>Post</td><td>0.005 [0.58]</td><td>-0.046**[0.03]</td></tr><tr><td>Treated</td><td>0.038***[ [0.00]</td><td>0.017 [0.23]</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>0.036*** [0.00]</td><td>0.038***[0.00]</td></tr><tr><td>ROA</td><td>0.095***[0.01]</td><td>0.200***[0.00]</td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td>-0.058***[0.00]</td><td>-0.032 [0.37]</td></tr><tr><td>Cash</td><td>0.011 [0.46]</td><td>0.075***[0.01]</td></tr><tr><td>PPE</td><td>-0.005 [0.72]</td><td>0.058*[0.05]</td></tr><tr><td>R&D</td><td>-0.051 [0.28]</td><td>0.192**[0.03]</td></tr><tr><td>Employees</td><td>0.001*[0.08]</td><td>0.000 [0.63]</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>1398</td><td>241</td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted R2</td><td>0.355</td><td>0.467</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table reports the mean levels of each variable used in the PSM match in the year before each exogenous shock in Panel A. The difference-in-difference analysis of the information quality index (Info_Qual Index) for treated and control firms around the exogenous shocks of broker mergers and closures, which occurred between 2000 and 2010, and around decimalization, which occurred in 2001 are reported in Panel B.

We measure the change in Spread from the pre-decimalization year to the post-decimalization year (△Spread--1 $_{t o+1~t o+1})$ where year zero is the year of 2001 in which decimalization occurred.15 We then sort the 2327 sample firms into terciles of Spread change and retain 775 firms experiencing the largest decline in Spread (treated firms) and 775 firms experiencing the smallest decline in Spread (control firms) before performing the PSM procedures. Our classification procedures of treated and control firms are similar to those used in extant papers (e.g., Brogaard et al., 2017; Fang, Tian, & Tice, 2014).  \n\nTable 5 Panel B results indicate that the natural experiments cause the expected change in information quality. The Info_Qual Index decreases in treated firms relative to their control firm counterparts around broker mergers and closures. It is also clear that the asymmetric information decrease around decimalization causes information quality to increase, with the Info_Qual Index increasing in treated firms relative to their control firm counterparts over the period from one year before to  \n\nTable6 Difference-in-difference analysis of the effect of information quality on LACs.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Broker Closures&Mergers</td><td>Decimalization</td></tr><tr><td>Panel A:Standard DiD</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Treated*Post</td><td>0.028*[0.07]</td><td>-0.106***[0.01]</td></tr><tr><td>Post</td><td>-0.024 [0.12]</td><td>0.005 [0.84]</td></tr><tr><td>Treated</td><td>0.003 [0.81]</td><td>0.073**[0.01]</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>0.000 [0.90]</td><td>0.008 [0.16]</td></tr><tr><td>ROA</td><td>-0.043**[0.04]</td><td>0.026 [0.70]</td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td>0.047**[0.05]</td><td>-0.087**[0.01]</td></tr><tr><td>Cash</td><td>0.040 [0.18]</td><td>-0.089**[0.04]</td></tr><tr><td>PPE</td><td>-0.110***[0.00]</td><td>-0.205***[0.00]</td></tr><tr><td>R&D</td><td>0.152**[0.01]</td><td>0.161 [0.10]</td></tr><tr><td>Employees</td><td>-0.003***[0.00]</td><td>-0.002**[0.02]</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>980</td><td>323</td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted R2</td><td>0.146</td><td>0.110</td></tr><tr><td>Panel B:Dynamic DiD</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Treated*Before-1</td><td>-0.011 [0.49]</td><td>-0.036 [0.29]</td></tr><tr><td>Treated*Current</td><td>0.019 [0.36]</td><td>-0.115***[0.00]</td></tr><tr><td>Treated*After1</td><td>0.033**[0.05]</td><td>-0.143***[0.00]</td></tr><tr><td>Before-1</td><td>-0.011 [0.54]</td><td>0.042*[0.09]</td></tr><tr><td>Current</td><td>0.015 [0.22]</td><td>0.027 [0.27]</td></tr><tr><td>Afterl</td><td>0.011 [0.48]</td><td>0.093***[0.00]</td></tr><tr><td>Treated</td><td>0.017 [0.29]</td><td>0.101***[0.00]</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>-0.001 [0.77]</td><td>0.008**[0.04]</td></tr><tr><td>ROA</td><td>-0.062**[0.03]</td><td>0.020 [0.52]</td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td>0.046**[0.04]</td><td>-0.082***[0.00]</td></tr><tr><td>Cash</td><td>0.022 [0.40]</td><td>-0.117***[0.00]</td></tr><tr><td>PPE</td><td>-0.140***[0.00]</td><td>-0.249***[0.00]</td></tr><tr><td>R&D</td><td>0.086 [0.14]</td><td>0.164***[0.00]</td></tr><tr><td>Employees</td><td>-0.003***[0.00]</td><td>-0.002***[0.00]</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>1877</td><td>649</td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted R2</td><td>0.137</td><td>0.142</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table contains a difference-in-difference analysis of the LAC Index for treated and control firms around the exogenous shocks of broker mergers and closures, which occurred between 2000 and 2010, and around decimalization, which occurred in 2001. The LAC Index is based on the rank of firms into Tightness Cost, Skills Cost, and Hiring Cost percentiles. In Panel A, the Post dummy variable equals one in the year following each shock and zero in the pre-shock year. Treated is a dummy variable that is equal to one for treated firms and zero for PSM-matched control firms. In Panel B Before-I is a dummy variable that equals one in the year before the shock and zero otherwise. Current is a dummy variable that equals one in shock year and zero otherwise. After is a dummy variable that equals one in the post-shock year and zero otherwise. Treated is a dummy variable that is equal to one for treated firms and zero for PSM-matched control firms.Sizeis the naturallogarithm of total assets.ROA is the ratio of operating income before depreciation to total assets.

We use both standard and dynamic DiD analysis. The standard analysis has the following specification:  \n\nLAC Indexi = α+β,Treated\\*Post+β2Treated +βsPost+Controls:, + Ei:  \n\nThe variables on the right-hand side of the regression are the same as those defined above for Eq. (4). The only difference is that the dependent variable is now the LAC Index rather than the Info_Qual Index.  \n\nThe results in Table 6 Panel A indicate that there is an increase in LACs following the reduction in information quality that coincides with broker closures and mergers in treated relative to control firms. Whereas on the other hand, there is a reduction in LACs in the cohort of firms that have the largest  improvement in their  information environment following decimalization. The differential LAC impact across treated and control firms around the information environment shocks is of an economically meaningful magnitude. Together with the results in Table 5, Panel B, the Treated\\*Post coefficient in Table 6 indicates that a one standard deviation decrease in the Info_Qual Index following broker mergers and closures generates a 0.94 standard deviation increase in in the LAC Index for treated firms in the broker closure and merger sample.16 Moreover, a one standard deviation increase in the Info_Qual Index following decimalization results in a 0.88 standard deviation decline in the LAC Index for treated firms one year after.17  \n\nRoberts and Whited (2013) point out that the parallel trends assumption, which is the key assumption behind the DiD model, is untestable, so several robustness tests should be conducted. We adopt a number of their suggestions to ensure that our results are robust. The first of these is their falsification test number 1, which we refer to as dynamic DiD analysis as specified in Eq. (6). This is run separately for the broker merger and closure and decimalization exogenous shocks:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{L A C~I n d e x_{i,t}=\\alpha+\\beta_{I}T r e a t e d^{\\ast}B e f o r e^{-I}+\\beta_{2}T r e a t e d^{\\ast}C u r r e n t}\\ &{\\qquad+\\beta_{3}T r e a t e d^{\\ast}A f t e r^{I}+\\beta_{4}B e f o r e^{-I}+\\beta_{s}C u r r e n t+\\beta_{6}A f t e r^{I}}\\ &{\\qquad+\\beta_{7}T r e a t e d+\\gamma C o n t r o l s_{i,t}+\\varepsilon_{i,t},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere Before-1 is a dummy variable that is equal to one for the year before a shock and zero otherwise, Current is a dummy variable that is equal to one for the year of the shock and zero otherwise, and $A f t e r^{I}$ is a dummy variable equal to one for the year after the shock and zero otherwise. The base year is two years before the shock. The coefficients of the interaction terms, Treated\\*Before-1, Treated\\*Current, and Trea$t e d^{*}A f t e r^{l}$ , therefore, measure the relative change in LACs of treated firms in the year before, with and following the shock, respectively, compared to the base year. By counterfactually assuming that the treatment onset occurs one or two years before it does, we can observe whether the treatment effect is indistinguishable from zero in these years. Such a finding can help allay concerns that the change observed in and after the event year can be attributed to some force other than the treatment.  \n\nOur results in Table 6 Panel B indicate we can be confident in this regard. In particular, the Treated\\*Before-I variable is not statistically significant, which is a confirmation that the information asymmetry of the treated and control firms is not different before the asymmetric information shock, or in other words, the parallel trends assumption is satisfied. Broker mergers and closures result in an increase in asymmetric information in the year of the event and the following year, while decimalization results in a decrease in asymmetric information in the year of the event and the following year. In the broker mergers and closures sample, the Treated\\*After? variable is positive and statistically significant for the LAC Index, which indicates that LACs increase in treated firms relative to control firms from the year following such events. In the decimalization sample, the Treated\\*Current and Trea$t e d^{\\ast}A f t e r^{l}$ variables are negative and statistically significant, which indicates that the decline in LACs begins occurring from the year of decimalization.  \n\n## 5. Conclusions  \n\nLabor adjustment costs (LACs) represent important friction in labor markets and impose a substantial financial burden on companies. The costs associated with hiring, training, firing, and lost productivity can equate to the payroll costs for one year. However, these costs are difficult to measure so proxies need to be used. Our contribution is determining whether a firm's information environment has an impact on an index based on three LAC proxies from the literature. Past papers have noted that information asymmetry is an important feature of labor markets with prospective employees having incomplete information about the firm. However, the impact of the information environment on LACs has not been addressed which may be due to empirical challenges regarding LACs measurement and endogeneity.  \n\nWe create a LAC Index based on three components: First, the sensitivity of firm returns to the tightness of the labor market (Tightness Cost). Firms that experience low returns when the labor market is tight have higher LACs. Second, the Skills Cost, or the weighted average skill levels of workers in an industry. Higher skilled workers are more difficult to replace so firms in industries with a higher Skills Cost have higher LACs. Third, given that adjustment costs influence the frequency of adjustment (hiring rate) with less frequent adjustment in firms where LACs are higher, we use a hiring rate variable, Hiring Cost.  \n\nGiven there is no consensus on the best measure of information quality, we form an information quality index (Info_Qual Index), which includes the following: A measure of the responsiveness of stock prices to earnings changes, the number of analysts following a firm, the forecast dispersion of analyst estimates, the readability of financial statements, a price delay measure, serial correlation in stock returns, a measure of information asymmetry and the bid-ask spread.  \n\nWe find a negative relation between information quality and the LAC Index. This result holds in general but is stronger when the increased information quality relates to firms with low financing constraints, stronger financial performance, and growth, which suggests that these employer qualities are particularly attractive to employees. We also find that LACs are a channel through which information quality impacts firm value. An increase in transparency has a stronger positive impact on firm value when LACs are lower.  \n\nWe use two natural experiments to capture changes in the information environment. These are broker closures and mergers, and decimalization. Broker closures and mergers result in a reduction in the number of analysts following a firm which, due to the role analysts play in improving the information environment, reduces information quality. Decimalization improves liquidity and liquidity increases encourage the formation of block holdings which, in turn, leads to greater management disclosure and improvements in information quality. The results from this analysis indicate that the link between information quality and the LAC Index is causal.  \n\n# Acknowledgments  \n\nWe thank Andrea Bennett, Hamish Anderson, Henk Berkman, Toby Daglish, Steve Easton, Michael Keefe, Doowon Lee, John Lee, Abul Shamsuddin, Avandar Subrahmanyam, David Tripe, Van Vu, Martin Young, Tom Smith, Toni Whited, seminar participants at Auckland University of Technology, Deakin University, Massey University, the University of Auckland, the University of Newcastle, Victoria University of Wellington, and participants at the 2018 International Conference on Accounting and Finance in Vietnam, the 2019 Vietnam International Conference in Finance, the 2020 New Zealand Finance Colloquium, and the 2020 FMA Conference for valuable suggestions.We also thank Tao Chen for providing the broker merger and closure data and Rui Ma for excellent research assistance.

Trans Earns is the responsiveness of returns to earnings changes as per Barth et al. (2013). Num_Analysts is the number of analysts following each stock. Analyst Disp is the standard deviation of forecasts/mean of forecasts. File_Size is the file size of firm 10-K disclosures as per Loughran and McDonald (2014). Delay is the Hou & Moskowitz (2005) price delay measure. Corr is the correlation between contemporaneous and one-week lagged stock returns. LMsW is the information asymmetry measures of Llorente et al. (2002). Spread is the natural logarithm of the monthly average of daily spreads where the daily spread is the difference between the closing bid and ask prices divided by the average of these two prices. Correlations are based on the percentile rank of each variable. We multiply variables by -1 where appropriate to ensure that higher values always indicate higher information quality. The Info_ Qual Index is a proxy for information quality based on these nine variables.  \n\nAppendix C.
