Introduction  \n\nInvestments in human and social capital are widely believed to improve the performance of employees (Arthur, 1994; Bishop, 1994; Boselie, Paauwe and Jansen, 2001; Gelderblom and de Koning, 1996; Huselid, 1995; MacDuffie, 1995). Similarly, many authors advocate that this is also the case for entrepreneurial performance (Blanchflower and Oswald, 1998; Briderl and Preisendorfer, 1998; Cooper, Gimeno-Gascon and Woo, 1994; Pennings, Lee and Van Witteloostuijn, 1998; Van Praag and Cramer, 2001; Van Praag, 2002). This is easy to understand since entrepreneurship is a fundamental characteristic of modern knowledge-based economic activities. This is because the potential value of new ideas and knowledge is inherently uncertain. This uncertainty can be absorbed by a large amount of people starting new firms to pursue, explore and implement new ideas (Audretsch and Thurik, 2000, 2001).  \n\nThe objective of the present paper is to answer the question: to what extent does investment in human and social capital, besides the widely believed determining effect of “talent\", enhance entrepreneurial performance? We distinguish between three types of investment in both human and social capital: general, industry-specific and entrepreneurship-specificinvestment.Wewill investigate to what degree these types of initial investment contribute to the performance of the small business founder, our empirical equivalent of the entrepreneur. The analysis is based on a representative panel survey amongst almost 1,000 new business founders in the Netherlands in the years 1994-1997. We employ three measures of performance: survival, profit, and generated employed.  \n\nOur main finding is that the endowed level of talent of a small business founder is not the unique determinant of performance. Rather, investment in industry-specific  and  entrepreneurship-specific human and social capital contributes significantly to the explanation of the cross-sectional variance of the performance of small firm founders. More precisely: industry-specific investments in human capital such as experience in the specific industry enhance performance, irrespective of the performance measure used. In addition, human and social entrepreneurship-specific capital investments, such as earlier experience in starting up a business and the membership of an association for small business founders generate more promising start-ups.  \n\nThis paper attempts to further our understanding about effective general and specific investments in human and social capital of small business founders. We seek to contribute to a policy-relevant and ongoing debate in the entrepreneurship literature. Empirical studies into the effect of human capital (Cooper, Gimeno-Gascon and Woo, 1994; Van Praag and Cramer, 2001) and social capital (Briderl and Preisendofer, 1998; Pennings, Lee and Van Witteloostuijn, 1998) on the performance of business founders are no novelty. The small holds for the distinction between the effect on performance of general and specific investments (Cooper, Gimeno-Gascon and Woo, 1994; Pennings, Lee and Van Witteloostuijn, 1998) in human and social capital. The contribution of this study is twofold. First, we systematically test the effect of general, industry-specific and entrepreneurship-specific human and social capital on three distinct performance measures while controlling for a rich set of other factors. Second, we explicitly analyze the meaning of our result by exploring alternative explanations tha1 are often not considered (Pennings, Lee and Van Witteloostuijn, 1998; Cooper, Gimeno-Gascon and Wo0,1994).  \n\n## 2. Theory and hypotheses  \n\nIt is argued that the firm founder's performance is determined not only by his talent, the circumstances and good luck, but also by his human, social, and financial capital. We measure the impact of human, social and financial capital on the firm's performance, while we control as much as possible for the other factors mentioned. In our view firm performance can be used as a proxy for the performance of the firm's founder because usually no other human capital than that of the single founder is present in the first year of a business  startup. Pennings, Lee andVan Witteloostuijn (1998) propose two reasons for a positive association between ownership share and the relative contribution of capital to firm performance: First, owners are residual claimants and therefore have a stronger incentive to use their human capital to the benefit of the firm. Second, the rents associated with investments in general assets completely accrue to the firm in case of an owner, whereas this is less so in case of a fixed claimant with outside options.  \n\nOur focus is on the impact of human and social capital. We are particularly interested in the entrepreneurship-specific and industry-specific investments in these types of capital.  \n\n### Human capital  \n\nThe positive impact of human capital on employee performance is well accepted and was formalized by Mincer (1974). Van Praag and Cramer (2001) made a first attempt to formalize this impact for the business founder's case. Several authors, including Cooper, Gimeno-Gascon and Woo (1994), Taylor (1999), Pennings, Lee and Van Witteloostuijn (1998), Van Praag (1996, 1999, 2002) as well as De Wit and Van Winden (1989) have put forth empirical support for the theoretical foundation.  \n\nHypothesis 1: Higher levels of human capital are associated with stronger performance by business founders  \n\n### Social capital  \n\nAs far as we know, the impact of social capital on a business founder's performance has not yet been put in a proper theoretical perspective. However, its impact has been supported empirically by Blumberg and Pfann (1999), Briderl and Preisendorfer (1998) and Pennings, Lee and Van Witteloostuijn (1998). A theory of investment in individual social capital has recently been developed by Glaeser, Laibson and Sacerdote (2000). For the benefit of identifying determinants of social capital formation, Glaeser, Laibson and Sacerdote first seek to understand the social capital investment decision of individuals. This understanding leads to seven propositions of which a subset is relevant: (i) a rational individual's investment in social capital is higher in occupations with greater returns to social skills, (ii) social capital declines with expected mobility, (i) people who invest in human capital also invest in social capital. Since small business founders need to have stronger or weaker ties with all the (prospective) stakeholders in their firm, such as clients, investors, debtors and, subcontractors, the expected benefits pertaining to social skills are high in the “occupation'” of business founding. Furthermore, we know that business founders are less mobile than employees are (Blanchflower, 2000). This implies by proposition (ii) of Glaeser, Laibson and Sacerdote that the expected returns to social capital are higher than average for business founders. The third proposition of Glaeser, Laibson and Sacerdote implies that individuals for whom the net return to human capital is high also might expect a relatively high net return to social capital. Taken together, these three propositions imply that social capital should enhance the performance of a business founder.  \n\nHypothesis 2: Higher levels of a business founder's social capital are associated with greater performance of the firm.  \n\n### Productivity and signaling  \n\nThe impact of human and social capital on the performance of the firm is likely to be caused by two underlying forces: productivity and signaling. First, the more capital is embedded in the firm's founder, the greater is the firm's productivity, and second, prospective stakeholders such as clients, subcontractors, and investors are likely to have imperfect information about the type of firms they consider dealing with. Therefore, these parties evaluate firms (and the prices involved in for instance buying their services) based on observable characteristics that they presume to be correlated with the unobserved type/quality of the firm and its founder. Investment in social and human capital might be a signal (Spence, 1974) as long as a high investment in these types of capital is the preferred choice of talented people, whereas a low level of investment is the most preferred choice for people with less talent (Milgrom and Roberts, 1992). We shall return to this interpretation when discussing the self-selection interpretation.  \n\n### Specificity of investments  \n\nWe differentiate the firm founder's capital investments with respect to the specificity of the investment. It is well known both from human capital theory (Becker, 1964) and from resource-based theories of the firm (Montgomery, 1995) that the more specific an investment is to its current use, the higher the expected returns, i.e., its contribution to firm performance should be. According to the human capital theory, the returns to a deliberate specific investment is a current activity should be sufficiently large to outweigh the cost attached to the investment. Contrarily, the returns to an investment in a more general asset might accrue to the investor during a longer period of time while performing various activities. Moreover, according to resource-based theories of the firm, success of firms is determined by the extent to which Richardian rents are earned by the accumulation and deployment of non-imitable resources. The probability of resources to be nonimitable is higher when they are obtained through specific investment than when by more general investment. We contrast general investments with two types of specific investments in human and social capital: industry-specific next to entrepreneurship-specific investments.' Industry-specific investments lose (part of) their value outside the industry in which the business venture is started whereas  entrepreneurship-specific  investment loses its return outside the entrepreneurial environment. Our next hypothesis results:  \n\nHypothesis 3: Industry-specific and entrepreneurship-specific investments in the business founder's human and social capital are more influential on firm performance than are general investments in human and social capital.  \n\n### Self-selection and unobserved heterogeneity \"Knowledge industries\"  \n\nTheoretically, investment behavior is in line with the comparative advantages hypothesis: individuals who experience more than average net gains from a particular investment, are more likely to choose that investment option. In other words, individuals self-select themselves into certain \"treatment groups\". The comparative advantage underlying the type of investment decisions that we study depends on individual characteristics that remain partly unobserved. The unobserved part of these characteristics about which the investor has private information, such as talent and intelligence, however, probably not only affects the outcome of the investment decision but also the performance of the business venture.  \n\nFrom a more technical point of view, the above implies that the unexplained part of the cross-sectional variation in business founders’ performance is correlated with the levels that these individuals invest in human and social capital. This correlation can be positive or negative. Most probably, the cost pertaining to the investment is lower for business founders with “higher” abilities than for business  founders  with “lower'’ abilities. Therefore, given a fixed difference in benefits accruing to the business founder of either ability level, a positive correlation between the error term and the investment levels in human and social capital is expected. If the level of benefits has the same association with the unobserved factors as business performance has, the correlation is surely positive. However, if lower ability business founders expect higher benefits from their investment than do higher ability entrepreneurs, because the latter group might judge that they “don't need\" these investments and, if this effect is stronger than the opposite effect at the cost-side, a negative correlation between the error term and the investment might result.  \n\nSummarizing, failing to implement the deliberate investment decision in the empirical model could generate a misspecified model with biased estimates.  \n\nHypothesis 4: The choice of firm founders for specific investments is partly dependent on unobserved talent of the firm founders. This would lead tobiased estimates of the effect of these investments.  \n\nThe relative contribution to production of human capital and knowledge has rapidly increased over the past decade (Audretsch and Thurik, 20o0). This is the case particularly in the so-called \"knowledge industries\", such as the ICT industry. Hence, one might argue that specific investments in human and social capital are particularly relevant in these “knowledge industries\". In the most extreme case, the effect of human capital on performance that we interpret as a general effect, might be the pure result of the supposedly strong effect in this growing industry, whereas the effect of human capital on performance in other industries might be insignificant.  \n\nHypothesis 5. Industry-specific and entrepreneurship-specific investments in the business founder's human and social capital are more influential in the “knowledge industries\" than they are in other industries.  \n\n## 3. Method  \n\n### Sample  \n\nThe panel consists of annual questionnaires conducted on a sample of Dutch entrepreneurs that started their business in 1994. The sample was taken from all newly registered firms in the first quarter of 1994 as reported in the database of the Dutch Chamber of Commerce. Initially 10,627 firms were contacted by telephone. A total of 3,00o firm founders agreed to participate in the survey. Approximately 2,000 firm founders finally completed the 1994 questionnaire. From 1995 onwards, a questionnaire was sent to the remaining group of business founders. The 1997 questionnaire was completed by over 1,100 respondents, implying a cumulative attrition rate of $45\\%$ . The firm size and sector distribution of the 1994 and 1997 respondents were comparable to those of the initial sample.  \n\nAs nearly half of the firm founders left the panel between 1994 and 1997, either due to nonresponse or the firm's exit, one could suspect that this could lead to biased results. We constructed an explicit model to investigate possible biases and found no significant ones.  \n\nThe measures for entrepreneurial performance are constructed from the questionnaires in 1995, 1996 and 1997, whereas the possible determinants are derived solely from the 1994 questionnaire. In this way we prevent problems of reversed causality.  \n\n### Measures of entrepreneurial performance  \n\nThe dataset used provides three performance measures. The first one deals with profit and is equated to the profit made in 1997. The entrepreneur has then been active for three years. Especially in the first two years profit may be somewhat misleading, as initial (sunk) costs often have to be gained back, which reduces profit. For entrepreneurs that are known to have terminated their businesses the profit variable is equated to zero. The second measure used is the cumulative employment created in the period 1994-1997.2 While profit is mainly an individual performance measure, the employment created by an entrepreneur can be seen as a society performance measure. The third performance measure is the hazard out of business ownership. Information is available on the survival time of the firms in the panel. We have constructed a variable measuring the number of months that a firm has been active. A survival model will be applied when investigating this performance measure.  \n\n### Determinants of entrepreneurial performance  \n\nFrom the 1994 firm founders questionnaire, we derived possible determinants of performance as set out in Table I. The variables are grouped horizontally by measure of specificity and vertically by the form of capital. Following the arguments made earlier, we focus on the five variables listed in italics in Table I.  \n\nWe include seven human capital variables. Experience of the business founder is measured in different dimensions: experience in business ownership itself, experience in activities related to business ownership (e.g. experience in leadership), and experience in the industry in which the founded business is active. For analyzing the effect of age, the inclusion of age and age squared enables a nonlinear relation. Education enters the analyses as a dummy variable, differentiating the high-educated business founders from the less educated ones. Like in many other studies, a dummy variable indicating whether the respondent has experience as an employee is also included.  \n\nThe three social capital variables are the following. If the business founder is engaged in an organized network of entrepreneurs (like a rotary club) this is indicated. Also, the emotional support of the business foudner's spouse may be important for entrepreneurial performance. To measure this effect properly, the presence of a spouse is also included as a dummy variable. Finally, the way the entrepreneur plans his way of information gathering may be influential for his performance. In the questionnaire ten possible actions were shown to the entrepreneurs. The respondents indicated whether they frequently, sometimes or never made use of these actions. Some of these actions are closely related. Factor analysis revealed four major strategies with respect to planned information gathering among the Dutch business founders:  \n\nTABLEI Potential determinants of entrepreneurial performance   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Human capital</td><td>Social capital</td><td>Financial capital</td><td>Controls</td></tr><tr><td>Entrepreneurship- specificinvestments</td><td>Experiencein business ownership Experiencein activitiesrelevant tobusiness ownership</td><td>Contactwith entrepreneursin networks Wayofinformation gathering</td><td>Experienced problems getting start capital</td><td>Various controls such as gender, roots of the firm, initialobjectives andambitionsof the founder,labor</td></tr><tr><td>Industry-specific investment</td><td>Experiencein industry</td><td></td><td></td><td>market histories, etcet</td></tr><tr><td>Generalinvestment</td><td>Age Age squared Higheducation Experience as an</td><td>Emotional support from spouse Presence of spouse</td><td>Otherincomesources</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n1. Focus on the branch in general (main actions: keep up with literature; attending conferences, courses and industry exchanges);   \n2. Focus on direct business relations (main actions: information from customers and suppliers);   \n3. Focus on commercial relations (main actions: information from banks; commercial cooperation; advise from experts);   \n4. Focus on fellow entrepreneurs.  \n\nFrom the financial angle, two variables are distinguished. The amount of the remaining income available in the household of the business founder may affect his/her performance. Thus, we include the amount of remaining income received by the business owner. We also identify the business founders that experienced a financial capital constraint by a unique dummy variable with value 1 if the business founder experienced problems obtaining start capital.  \n\n### Estimatemethods  \n\nBoth the profit and the employment measure have a zero lower bound. Negative profits are not observed, while negative employment is non-interpretable. Therefore, both equations are estimated using tobit regressions. For the expected survival time, we apply a different model than for profit and employment. In this survival model the (logarithm of the) expected survival time is modeled as a function of the characteristics of the entrepreneurs. For the underlying expected distribution of the probability to exit, we assume a loglogistic distribution (Lancaster, 1992, p. 8). See the Appendix to this paper for details.  \n\n## 4. Results  \n\nEstimation results are presented in Table II. From this table we will draw some conclusions concerning hypotheses 1, 2 and 3 of section 2. We will also make some additional observations. Section 5 will deal with additional analyses meant to test the remaining hypotheses 4 and 5.  \n\nHuman capital appears to influence our entire set of performance measures. To be more specific, former experience of the business founder in the industry in which he starts his business appears to improve all performance measures. Moreover, experience in activities relevant to business ownership (e.g. experience in leadership) increases the firm's survival time. Age appears to affect none of the performance measures. Finally, higheducated people make more profits, while those who have experience as an employee create more employment. Leaving out the human capital variables results in a model that according to the likelihood ratio tests performs significantly worse for all three performance measures. We conclude that hypothesis 1 - human capital influences  the performance - is confirmed, though the specific aspects of human capital that influence each performance measure are not similar.  \n\nSocial capital also appears to influence performance. If business owners plan to gather their information via commercial relations, this improves several performance measures. Furthermore, information gathering via general channels further increases the survival time and the generated employment. Contact with other entrepreneurs in networks, such as rotary clubs, has a positive effect on the employment the business founder generates. The effect of these formal networks is insignificant on the other performance measures. Finally, the emotional support of a spouse appears also to be of importance: those who enjoy it earn approximately $40\\%$ more than their fellow entrepreneurs who experience no support. On the whole, we conclude that there is sufficient support for hypothesis 2: social capital positively affects entrepreneurial performance.  \n\nThe specific investments in human and social capital are printed in italics in Table II. It appears that making specific investments matters in explaining performance. Exclusion of variables related to specific investments results in a model with a significantly lower likelihood than the model with these variables included. However, as can be seen from the table, general investments in human and social capital are also of importance - be it somewhat less.3 Thus, there is some support for hypothesis 3: specific investments are more influential than general investments.  \n\nTABLEII Estimation results: Impact of human and social capital on performance   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">Survival</td><td colspan=\"2\">Profit</td><td colspan=\"2\">Employment</td></tr><tr><td>Estimate</td><td>st.err</td><td>Estimate</td><td>st.err</td><td>Estimate</td><td>st.err</td></tr><tr><td>HUMANCAPITAL</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Experienceinbusinessownership</td><td>-0.15</td><td>0.37</td><td>0.40*</td><td>0.21</td><td>0.42</td><td>0.37</td></tr><tr><td>Experienceinactivitiesrelevant to</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.27</td></tr><tr><td>business ownership</td><td>0.50** 0.50**</td><td>0.22 0.21</td><td>0.17 0.62**</td><td>0.14 0.13</td><td>0.00 0.49**</td><td>0.23</td></tr><tr><td>Experienceinindustry</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Age divided by 10</td><td>-0.94</td><td>1.04</td><td>-0.28</td><td>0.55</td><td>-0.47</td><td>1.14</td></tr><tr><td>Age divided by 10, then squared</td><td>0.15</td><td>0.12</td><td>0.04</td><td>0.06</td><td>0.03</td><td>0.13</td></tr><tr><td>High education</td><td>0.04</td><td>0.22</td><td>0.25**</td><td>0.12</td><td>-0.23</td><td>0.23</td></tr><tr><td>Experience as an employee</td><td>0.36</td><td>0.37</td><td>0.41</td><td>0.26</td><td>1.18**</td><td>0.57</td></tr><tr><td>SOCIAL CAPITAL</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Contactwithentrepreneursinnetworks</td><td>-0.23</td><td>0.27</td><td>-0.16</td><td>0.16</td><td>0.81**</td><td>0.28</td></tr><tr><td>Wayofinformationgathering: -generalchannels</td><td>0.28**</td><td>0.09</td><td>0.01</td><td>0.06</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>-direct business relations</td><td>-0.04</td><td>0.10</td><td>0.06</td><td>0.06</td><td>0.32**</td><td>0.11</td></tr><tr><td>-commercialrelations</td><td>0.20*</td><td>0.12</td><td>0.16**</td><td>0.06</td><td>-0.07 0.33**</td><td>0.10</td></tr><tr><td>-fellow entrepreneurs</td><td>0.10</td><td>0.09</td><td>0.15**</td><td>0.06</td><td>0.05</td><td>0.09</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.10</td></tr><tr><td>Emotional support from spouse Presence of spouse</td><td>0.57**</td><td>0.27 0.35</td><td>0.40** 0.04</td><td>0.18 0.23</td><td>-0.17</td><td>0.33</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-0.59*</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.81*</td><td>0.43</td></tr><tr><td>FINANCIALCAPITAL</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Other income available</td><td>0.00</td><td>0.06</td><td>-0.05*</td><td>0.03</td><td>-0.13**</td><td>0.06</td></tr><tr><td>Experienced problems getting started</td><td>-0.66**</td><td>0.33</td><td>-0.47**</td><td>0.22</td><td>-0.09</td><td>0.40</td></tr><tr><td>CONTROLVARIABLES</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Gender</td><td>0.47**</td><td>0.21</td><td>0.43**</td><td>0.13</td><td>0.54**</td><td>0.26</td></tr><tr><td>No affiliations with other businesses</td><td>0.94**</td><td>0.34</td><td>0.75**</td><td>0.23</td><td>-0.33</td><td>0.36</td></tr><tr><td>Goal: employment growth</td><td>-0.03</td><td>0.28</td><td>0.44**</td><td>0.17</td><td>2.39**</td><td>0.33</td></tr><tr><td>Motive: higher income</td><td>-0.28</td><td>0.25</td><td>0.26*</td><td>0.14</td><td>-0.10</td><td>0.27</td></tr><tr><td>Number of hours worked at the start</td><td>0.38**</td><td>0.11</td><td>0.34**</td><td>0.07</td><td>0.83**</td><td>0.14</td></tr><tr><td>Constant</td><td>3.71*</td><td>2.10</td><td>-2.56**</td><td>1.17</td><td>-5.12**</td><td>2.33</td></tr><tr><td>#observations</td><td colspan=\"2\">821</td><td colspan=\"2\">896</td><td colspan=\"2\">758</td></tr><tr><td>Log likelihood</td><td colspan=\"2\">-935.66</td><td colspan=\"2\">-1217.53</td><td colspan=\"2\">-639.97</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nBusiness founders spending 40 hours or more on other paid activities are left out. $^{**}$ Significant at $5\\%$ level; $^*$ Significant at $10\\%$ level.  \n\nWith respect to  the influence of financial capital, we find that capital constraints at the start have a negative impact on survival time and earnings. Those business owners who already have another source of finance perform worse as regards to generating employment.  They are probably not as dedicated to their business than their fellow entrepreneurs.  \n\nWith respect to our controls, the following results are worth mentioning. Gender matters, at least for this particular sample of 1994 Dutch business founders. Male business founders perform better on all performance measures. Having no affiliations with other businesses works out positive: it increases the survival time as well as the profits generated. Finally, people indicating that one of their goals is achieving employment growth, indeed generate more employment and people who indicate that a higher expected income is an important motive to become self-employed indeed make more profits.  \n\n## 5. Final discussion  \n\nIn the previous section we found that specific investments of firm founders in human or social capital enhance their performance. However, as explained in Section 2, without further explorations one cannot be sure whether this positive effect is solely due to the investment itself or partly due to the fact that more talented firm founders invest more in their human and social capital. In the latter case it would be incorrect to assign the credits of the better performance solely to the investment. In other words, we would have found an upwardly biased effect.  \n\nThis problem is widely recognized in the schooling literature (Ashenfelter, Colm and Oossterbeek, 2000) and can be solved with instrumental variables estimation techniques. In this technique, the model is enhanced with an additional equation describing the investment decision of the firm founders in a particular form of human or social capital. The additional investment equation should contain at least one variable, the \"instrument\", which (i) has a significant effect on the investment decision, while (ii) it cannot influence the performance of the firm founder on theoretical grounds. In this way it is possible to sort out the “real\"” investment effect. For, if the instrument is found to have an effect in the performance equation, it is then clear that this effect can only be due to the investment because by assumption the instrument has no direct effect on performance.  \n\nUnfortunately, as is commonly known, it is notoriously difficult to find appropriate instruments. Although we tried various ones, we were not able to find satisfying instruments. So potential biases in this way cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, we do not suspect large biases to occur because of the following two reasons. First, using our rich data set we already control for talent in our regression with several proxies. This leaves less room for unobserved talent correlated with the investment decision of the firm founder. Second, on theoretical grounds we do not suspect large biases for most of our investments variables. For example, we find that firm founders with experience in the industry in which they start their businesses, perform better. It is unlikely that this effect would be due largely to unobserved talent of these firm founders. Hence, though we are not able to reject hypothesis 4 unreservedly - there are biases because of unobserved talent - we are not afraid for large biases in our results because Of it.  \n\nAnobvious competitorfor the influence of human and social capital on performance is the use of strategies which again needs to be controlled for types of uncertainty (Van Gelderen, Frese and Thurik, 2000). A certain strategy may dictate what types and levels of human and social capital are needed. Alternatively, available types and levels of human and social capital may induce to application of certain strategies. Future research needs to take into account the interrelationships between the portfolio of human and social capital, types of strategy, forms of uncertainty and performance.  \n\nFor exploring the role of the knowledge industries in explaining performance (hypothesis 5), dummy variables for these industries (i.e. business services and other services) are implemented. For the specific investment variables, cross products are generated and included in the analysis. However, the hypothesized industry effects does not emerge from the estimation results. On these grounds, we reject hypothesis 5.  \n\nWe conclude that specific investments in human and social capital enhance entrepreneurial performance substantially. This is true for all three distinguished performance measures: survival, profits, generated employment.  \n\n# Acknowledgement  \n\nThis paper has been written in the framework of the research programme SCALES (Scientific AnaLysis of Entrepreneurship and SMEs), which is financed by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs.

The model to be estimated then reads as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\ln\\Pi_{i}=\\upalpha^{\\Pi}+\\sum_{j=1}^{J}\\B A_{j}^{\\Pi}x_{i j}+\\p\\pounds_{i}^{\\Pi},\\quad\\mathrm{~where~}\\pounds_{i}^{\\Pi}\\sim N(0,\\upsigma_{\\Pi}^{2},).\n$$  \n\nThe model for employment is analogous to that for profit. Let $L_{i}$ be the cumulated employment (in full time equivalents) generated by respondent $i$ between 1994 and 1997, and $\\Pi_{i j}$ respondent $i^{*}$ s value of determinant $j$ in 1994. The regression equation then reads:  \n\n$$\n\\ln{\\cal L}_{i}=\\mathrm{\\sf{Q}}^{L}+\\sum_{j=1}^{J}\\beta_{j}^{L}x_{i j}+\\pounds_{i}^{L},\\quad\\mathrm{~where~}\\pounds_{i}^{L}\\sim N(0,\\bar{\\sigma}_{L}^{2}).\n$$  \n\nBoth the profit and the employment measures have zero as the lower bound. Negative profits are not observed, while negative employment is non-interpretable. Therefore, both equations are estimated using tobit regressions.  \n\nFor duration, we apply a different model than for profit and employment, viz., a survival model. In this model the (logarithm of the) expected survival time is modeled as a function of the characteristics of the entrepreneurs.A description of this model is given below.  \n\nIn the survival model, firm founders start their business at time $t=0$ . Exits are described by a random process governed by a probability density function $f(t)$ and adjoining distribution function $F(T)$ . Thus, the probability of a firm existing between $t$ and $t+\\mathrm{d}t$ is denoted by $f(t)\\mathrm{d}t$ and the chance that a firm exists in the first $T$ months is denoted by $F(T)$  \n\nConsequently, the survivor function $S(T)$ , defined as the probability that a firm survives the first $T$ months, is equivalent to $1-F(T)$ . Also, the hazard rate $\\uptheta(t)$ ,specifying the conditional probability that a firm that has remained in business for a period from O to $t$ ,exists in the short interval $[t,t+d t]$ , is equivalent to  \n\n$$\n\\Theta(t)=\\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}.\n$$  \n\nThehazardfunctionismodeledasafunctionofasetof exogenous person specific regressors, the vector $x$ ，andof time $t$ to permit duratoion dependence.Assuming the absence of regressors, the hazard is a non-monotonic function of $t$ The assumption was shown to hold by a first inspection of the duration data. A simple hazard specification that permits non-monotonic behavior is the log-logistic (Lancaster, 1992, p.44):  \n\n$$\n\\Theta(t,x)=\\frac{k(x)\\alpha t^{\\alpha-1}}{1+k(x)t^{\\alpha}}.\n$$  \n\nLet $k(x)=\\exp(\\beta^{\\prime}x)$ . Then, it can be demonstrated that  \n\n$$\nE[\\ln t/x_{i}]=-\\beta^{\\prime}{x_{i}}^{4}\n$$  \n\nThese are the coefficients (i.e. $-\\upbeta)$ that are shown for duaration in Table II. The likelihood function to be maximized is the following:  \n\n$$\nL_{i}=S(t_{i})\\Theta_{i}(t_{i})^{d_{i}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $d_{i}=1$ if individual $i^{:}$ s exist is observed at $t_{i}$ and $d_{i}=0$ if $i^{*}$ s length of time in business is right censored. As Equation (1) can be rewritten as  \n\n$$\n\\Theta(t)=\\frac{-d\\ln S(t)}{d(t)},\n$$  \n\nit follows that  \n\n$$\nS(t)=\\exp\\left(-\\int_{0}^{t}\\Theta(u)d u\\right).\n$$  \n\nThe logarithm of the likelihood function can now be written in terms of the hazard function as  \n\n$$\n\\ln{\\cal L}_{i}=-\\mathrm{d}\\int_{0}^{t_{i}}\\Theta_{i}(u)d u+d_{i}\\ln{\\Theta}_{i}(t_{i}).\n$$  \n\n# Notes  \n\n1  We refrain from making any other distinctions than the ones made already with respect to types of human and social capital. Cressy (1996) distinguishes between formal (education) and informal (age, experience) human capital. The effect of these distinguished forms of human capital on venture performance is, though very interesting, not considered within our framework as shown in Table I, just for the sake of focus ofexposition.  \n\n2 Other employment measures have also been investigated. These include employment growth and the employment in 1997. Both measures produced results that did not differ significantly from those pertaining to the performance measure \"cumulated employment\". We therefore included cumulated employment as the single employment measure in this paper. 3  More precisely, exclusion of the variables related to general investments decreases the likelihood less than exclusion of the variables related to specific investments.  \n\nSee Greene (2000), p. 993.  \n\n# References  \n\nArthur, J.

Firms choose their operating leverage trading off higher fixed costs for lower variable costs. Operating leverage governs frms’ exposures to an aggregate labor productivity shock. In equilibrium, firms exhibit excessive operating leverage as they do not internalize that an economy with higher aggregate operating leverage is more likely to fall into a recession following a negative productivity shock. Welfare losses coming from firms' failure to coordinate production are amplified by suboptimal risk-taking, which magnifies the impact of productivity shocks onto aggregate output.  \n\nKeywords: Operating leverage; Labor leverage; Coordination failure; Global games;   \nAggregate risk.  \n\nJEL classifcation: D24; D62; G01; E32  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nLabor leverage is a first-order determinant of firms’ risk as it creates a rigid cost structure that cannot be easily adjusted to demand shocks. For instance, Danthine and Donaldson (2002) note that the obligations originated by frms' labor force dwarf their financial obligations and provide evidence consistent with labor leverage generating undiversifiable risk. A subsequent stream of literature in asset pricing (e.g., Merz and Yashiv, 2007; Donangelo, Gourio, Kehrig, and Palacios, 2019; and Faviloukis, Lin, and Zhao, 2020) has shown that labor leverage has explanatory power in the pricing of equity and debt, both in the cross-section and in aggregate. In this paper, we endogenize frms' labor leverage decisions and study how these firm-level choices compound into aggregate risk. Specifically, labor leverage affects the likelihood that the economy falls into a Pareto-inferior equilibrium in which output is depressed and welfare is low. These episodes of coordination failure are interpreted as economic crises, in line with a long tradition in economics. While these crises are self-fulfilling in nature, the global games approach (e.g., Morris and Shin, 2000) suggests that their occurrence is anchored to fundamentals through firms′ exposure to a common productivity shock. We illustrate how this transmission channel operates through labor leverage and evaluate its implications for the risk of recessions and more broadly for welfare.  \n\nWe consider an imperfectly competitive economy with aggregate demand spillovers as in Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny (1989). The economy is populated by consumers who supply labor to firms in different sectors. Labor is subject to a productivity shock, which is the only source of risk in this economy. Firms are collectively owned by consumers and use labor as their sole input to produce final goods. Each sector has a competitive fringe of firms with a constant returns to scale technology and a unique large firm with an increasing returns to scale technology. Increasing returns to scale generates strategic complementarities across sectors: higher profits in one firm trickle down to consumers and stimulate their demand for goods in other sectors. Higher demand, in turn, allows firms in other sectors to leverage their increasing returns to scale technologies and increase their own profits.  \n\nImportantly, we allow large firms to adjust their cost structure ex ante. For instance, in Chaney and Ossa (2013), firms organize production by choosing their division of labor, which trades off fixed versus marginal costs. A greater division of labor is associated to higher labor leverage. We interpret labor leverage as an enduring technological and organizational choice, consistent with the idea that adjustments to the size and structure of the labor force within a firm requires time and involves sizeable costs. More specifically, at the initial date, each firm chooses its labor leverage, trading off higher fixed labor costs for lower variable labor costs. Labor leverage determines the exposure of a frm's profits to the aggregate productivity shock. On the one hand, when demand is high, a firm benefits from higher leverage as it can produce at a lower average cost. On the other hand, higher leverage, by raising fixed labor costs, makes a firm more vulnerable to a drop in demand. At that final date, the productivity shock is realized and large firms set prices to maximize profits given the threat from the competitive fringe. A firm, however, retains the option to leave the market following a negative productivity shock if it expects demand to be insufficient  \n\nto cover its fixed costs.  \n\nFinally, we assume that tasks in large firms are subject to moral hazard. This is consistent with the idea that in larger and more complex organizations, information frictions create room for opportunistic behavior. Similar to Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny (1989), it is the combination of demand externalities and this labor friction that ultimately creates scope for coordination failures. Specifically, the presence of moral hazard requires large frms to pay a premium over the wage in the competitive fringe, and these firms fail to internalize the demand spillovers that higher wages have on the rest of the economy. As a result, in the final date, the economy can be trapped in an equilibrium in which large firms exit and output is inefficiently low.  \n\nThe main contribution of the paper is to show that coordination failures at the production stage contaminate ex ante risk-taking decisions and generate excessive labor leverage in aggregate. We derive this result in two steps. First, we study production decisions at the final date and show that when labor productivity falls below a threshold, coordination motives generate a sharp transition from a Pareto-optimal production outcome in which large firms reap the benefits of increasing returns to scale, to a Pareto-inferior outcome in which large firms cease to operate. Importantly, we also show that this endogenous operating threshold is higher when firms? aggregate labor leverage increases, that is, an increase in labor leverage increases the likelihood of a coordination failure.  \n\nWe then turn to ex ante labor leverage decisions. When setting their labor leverages, firms take into account their option to cease operations when demand is low. Because of this option, frms optimize leverage over the states in which they anticipate being active. Coordination problems make it less likely for large firms to survive a bad productivity shock, which tilts each firm's optimization program towards higher-productivity states. In these states, the return to labor leverage is higher, so that aggregate labor leverage rises when the production-stage coordination problem worsens. We show that the equilibrium labor leverage is constrained inefficient: a social planner that takes the production-stage equilibrium as given could increase welfare by forcing all frms to lower their labor leverage. The welfare loss caused by excess labor leverage occurs through a shift of the output distribution towards high-productivity states that comes at the cost of higher downside risk and lower expected output. Intuitively, each firm chooses its labor leverage taking the aggregate labor leverage as given. Hence, firms do not internalize that their collective decision to increase labor leverage raises the coordination threshold, making it more likely that the economy coordinates on a Pareto-inferior regime with depressed output.  \n\nThe excessive labor leverage is inherently related to the existence of a coordination failure. To formally make this point, we also study a case without coordination failures, that is, a case in which we allow firms to coordinate on the Pareto-superior equilibrium at the production stage. As mentioned earlier, atomistic frms do not internalize that a collective decrease in leverage would widen the range of states in which production takes place. However, when firms coordinate on the Pareto-superior equilibrium, production decisions are optimal ex post and hence, the social value of producing in the marginal state (at the production threshold) is exactly zero. Therefore, a marginal decrease in aggregate labor leverage would extend production to a state where it brings no social value. In that case, the equilibrium leverage is constrained effcient. By contrast, when there is a coordination failure at the production stage, there exists a region just below the production threshold where the net value of all frms switching from inaction to production is strictly positive.  \n\nOur paper builds on a stream of literature in economics that grounds low aggregate output realizations into coordination failures. (See Diamond, 1982; Hart, 1982; and Weitzman, 1982, for early contributions.) Cooper and John (1988) provide a general framework to analyze economies in which agents’ actions are strategic complements. In our paper, demand complementarities originate from a combination of imperfect competition and increasing returns to scale technologies as in Shleifer and Vishny (1988), Kiyotaki (1988) and Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny (1989). Lamont (1995) shows that coordination failures arise with imperfect competition but constant returns to scale economy when firms can suffer from debt overhang. The common feature in these papers is the existence of multiple self-fulfilling equilibria that can be Pareto-ranked. While this illustrates how economies can be trapped into inferior low-output equilibria, equilibrium indeterminacy precludes a meaningful analysis of firms’ ex ante risk-exposure decisions, the objective of our paper.  \n\nTo overcome this problem, we take advantage of global games techniques. As shown in Carlsson and Van Damme (1993), introducing dispersed information in games of strategic complementarities can lead to a unique equilibrium prediction pinned down by the realization of an underlying economic fundamental. Chamley (1999) and Bebchuk and Goldstein (2011) use this insight to study economies in which agents’ investment decisions exhibit a generic form of complementarity. Schaal and Taschereau-Dumouchel (2018) introduce global games in a dynamic model with demand complementarities and show how transitory shocks can trigger long-lasting periods of depressed investment and recession. Guimaraes and Morris (2008) show that risk-averse agents’ exposures to an underlying source of risk affect the outcome of the coordination game they play. Our contribution to this body of literature is to endogenize risk-taking; that is, agents’ exposures to the underlying common risk factor.  \n\nOur paper is also related to the literature on operating leverage and firms’ risk initiated by Lev (1974). More specifically, a stream of papers in fnance focuses on labor leverage, building on the premise that labor is the main fixed component of firms′ cost structures. Danthine and Donaldson (2002) note that labor generates obligations for firms that are of an order of magnitude greater than their financial obligations, and that the labor share is countercyclical. These empirical observations motivate a general equilibrium model in which labor leverage creates nondiversifiable risk for equity holders. Subsequent papers have shown labor leverage to be positively related to CAPM beta, stock volatility, credit risk, and procyclicality of profits in a cross-section of firms. (See, for instance, Donangelo, Gourio, Kehrig, and Palacios, 2019 and Faviloukis, Lin, and Zhao, 2020.) Merz and Yashiv (2007) show that the shape and magnitude of labor adjustment costs effectively makes hiring conceptually similar to an investment. These empirical findings lend support to the mechanism at play in the model where operating leverage is driven by labor costs and constitutes a structural long-term choice that affects a frm's exposure to aggregate risk.  \n\nFinally, there is a large body of literature that studies the relation between financial frictions and economic crises. (See, for instance, Bernanke and Gertler, 1989; Kiyotaki and Moore, 1997; Lorenzoni, 2008; Gorton and Ordonez, 2014; and He and Kondor, 2016.) This literature highlights the role of fnancial frictions (e.g., credit constraints arising from contract incompleteness） in generating and amplifying crises. While the role of financial leverage in economic crises has been extensively studied, the role of operating leverage has received less attention. This is despite the fact that financial distress is typically preceded by economic distress, and despite the importance of frms non-financial obligations in comparison to their financial obligations. For instance, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, employee compensation for US non-financial corporations in 2018, \\$5,946 billions, amounted to 17 times their net interest payments, \\$33 billions. The nature of operating leverage and fnancial leverage are also markedly distinct: frms may change their capital structure by going to the capital market or through renegotiation, whereas operating leverage is a structural choice that cannot be adjusted in the short run. Moreover, frms can use financial markets to hedge against the costs associated to financial risk. In contrast, financial markets are of limited use in managing operating risk as hedging does not change the cost structure and therefore, whether firms create or destroy value. Our paper suggests that these fundamental technological and organizational choices at the frm level can have outsized aggregate effects in economies subject to coordination failures.  \n\n## 2. Model  \n\nWe consider a unit interval of identical consumers with a utility function $\\begin{array}{r}{\\exp\\left[{\\int_{0}^{1}\\ln x(q)d q}\\right]}\\end{array}$ defined over a unit interval of goods indexed by $q$ . Each consumer is endowed with $L$ units of labor that he supplies inelastically, so $L$ is also the total amount of labor in the economy. $L$ is drawn from a uniform distribution over $[0,\\overline{{L}}]$ , and the realization of $L$ is interpreted as an economy-wide labor productivity shock, the only source of risk in this economy. To ensure the existence of equilibria in which agents’ optimization problems have interior solutions, we take the upper bound, $\\overline{{L}}$ , to be large enough, in a sense we make precise in the Appendix (for most results, $\\overline{{L}}>2$  \n\nEach good $q$ is produced by a sector, and each sector consists of two types of frms. A competitive fringe of firms with a constant returns to scale technology in which one unit of output requires one unit of labor, and a unique firm, a monopolist, with access to an increasing returns to scale technology. To produce, monopolist $q$ incurs a fixed cost of $\\begin{array}{r}{F(s_{q})=\\frac{s_{q}}{\\alpha-s_{q}}}\\end{array}$ units of labor and a constant marginal cost of $\\alpha-s_{q}$ units of labor per unit of output. We assume $\\alpha<1$ , and take $s_{q}\\in[0,\\alpha]$ to be a choice variable that captures operating leverage: by increasing $s_{q}$ , monopolist $q$ reduces its marginal labor cost $\\alpha-s_{q}$ at the expense of inflating its fixed labor cost $F(s_{q})$ 1  The model is closed by assuming that consumers own all the profits and that each frm maximizes expected profits where the workers’ wage per unit of labor is taken as the numeraire.2  \n\nConsistent with the literature on labor leverage surveyed in the introduction, we interpret levera.ge $s_{q}$ as a structural, long-term choice that regulates monopolist $q$ 's cost structure in future production periods. As originally illustrated by Adam Smith's famous pin factory example, a key decision in the organization of production is the division of labor, which he argued to be limited by the market size. Chaney and Ossa (2013) provide a formalization of Adam Smith's argument. In their model, frms choose their division of labor trading off fixed and marginal costs. Specifically, a greater number of teams, which would allow for a greater division of labor, is associated with higher fixed costs but lower marginal costs. (Each team bears a fixed cost but having more teams allows each team to perform a narrower range of tasks around a core competency.) As the expected size of the market increases, firms choose a greater division of labor, that is, a production technology with higher operating leverage.  \n\nTo capture the enduring quality of these long-term technological and organizational choices and therefore, that frms cannot respond to a productivity shock by swiftly changing their production technologies, we assume that each monopolist $q$ chooses $s_{q}$ at $t=0$ , before the realization of the productivity shock and the production decisions at $t=1$ .At $t=1$ ， the final period, $L$ , is realized, and all firms decide how much to produce and at which price to sell. Note that monopolist $q$ may decide not to produce upon learning $L$ . In that case, it saves the fixed cost $F(s_{q})$ , but abandons production in sector $q$ to the competitive fringe. Hence, labor cost $F(s_{q})$ is fixed rather than sunk as, for instance, in Maskin and Tirole (1988): “Ficed costs (measured as a flow) persist only as long as production continues, but are, strictly speaking, independent of scale. Pure sunk costs . . . are incurred with or without production.\"” Therefore, the irreversibility in the model is in the labor leverage choice, $s_{q}$ that is, in the frm's choice of its technology.  \n\nFinally, we assume that production by monopolists requires monitoring that needs to be incentivized. Specifically, a subset of the workers hired by each monopolist performs supervisory functions, where each supervisor is responsible for a share of the firm's production. If a supervisor exerts monitoring effort, each unit produced under his supervision is functional, but he incurs a personal cost $\\beta$ per unit.3 If a supervisor does not exert effort, units are defective and worthless to consumers. Quality is contractible, and we assume that $\\alpha+\\beta<1$ , So that the overall marginal cost is still lower when a monopolist produces than when the competitive fringe does. This specification is consistent with monopolists being larger, more sophisticated organizations in which division of labor and information frictions require supervisory tasks of a different nature than the tasks required in small fringe firms. For instance, Garicano and Van Zandt (2012) reviews a body of literature in which hierarchies and division of labor jointly emerge as a response to costly information processing. This monitoring friction is also isomorphic to the assumption in Murphy,  \n\nShleifer, and Vishny (1989) who posit that workers experience a disutility when working for monopolist firms rather than for firms in the competitive fringe, as we discuss in Section 5.1. The disutility in Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny (1989) is in the spirit of Rosenstein-Rodan (1943), capturing the idea that to bring farm laborers to work in a factory, a frm must pay them a wage premium. While their specification is tailored to developing economies where a \"big push” can jump-start development, our specification has a more natural interpretation in developed economies where business cycles are amplified by coordination failures. As in Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny (1989), the role of this assumption is to generate equilibrium multiplicity and the possibility of a coordination failure at the production stage. This allows us to study the relation between coordination failures in production at $t=1$ and risk-taking decisions at $t=0$ , the objective of this paper. As will become clear below (Proposition 4), our results are not related to the monitoring friction per se, but to the possibility of a coordination failure.  \n\nFig. 1 below illustrates the timing of events. Notice that production only takes place at $t=1$ , after the realization of the productivity shock $L$ . A setup in which firms produce both at $t=0$ and at $t=1$ would produce qualitatively similar results, provided that monopolists cannot change their chosen technologies between the two periods. (See the Online Appendix for such case.) In other words, what is important for our results is that monopolists cannot respond to the productivity shock by quickly changing their production technologies at $t=1$ ; that is, that firms’ technological and organizational choices are long lasting. As we will show, this causes monopolists’ choices of operating leverage ex ante ( $t=0$ ) to affect the probability of a coordination failure ex post ( $t=1$  \n\n![](images/7b738b8ba323e32c90dd80baa842ed334e7337762ecbf69e3c7f985d4974693f.jpg)  \nFig. 1.

A reader familiar with their analysis could jump to Lemma 1 below, which summarizes a result equivalent to the one in their paper, and which we take as a building block.  \n\nEach consumer buys the consumption basket $\\{\\boldsymbol{x}(\\boldsymbol{q})\\}_{\\boldsymbol{q}\\in[0,1]}$ that maximizes his utility given prices $\\{p(q)\\}_{q\\in[0,1]}$ and his available income $y$  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{max}_{\\{x(q)\\}_{q\\in[0,1]}}\\exp\\left[\\int_{0}^{1}\\ln x(q)d q\\right]\\mathrm{s.t.}\\int_{0}^{1}p(q)x(q)=y.\n$$  \n\nAt optimum, consumers spend equally on each good,that is they buy quantity r(q) = of good $q$  \n\nMonopolist $q$ sets price $p(q)$ to maximize profit given demand  \n\n$$\nx(q)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{\\displaystyle{\\frac{y}{p(q)}}}&{\\mathrm{if}p(q)\\leq1,}\\ {\\quad}\\ {0}&{\\mathrm{if}p(q)>1.}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nNote that the monopolist is priced out if it sets $p(q)>1$ : since the competitive fringe can produce one unit of good $q$ with one unit of labor whose wage is the numeraire, the price in the competitive fringe is equal to one. Given the demand function in Eq. (2), if monopolist $q$ is active, it sets the highest price that generates a positive demand, $p(q)=1$ ， and produces $x(q)=y$ units of output. Because monitoring requires effort, supervisors have to be paid a premium over the wage in the competitive fringe. Since quality is contractible, and since the probability of producing a functional unit without monitoring effort is zero, promising a bonus $\\beta$ conditional on delivering a functioning unit is sufficient to incentivize monitoring, and only compensates the supervisor for his monitoring cost. The profit of an active monopolist, given that $p(q)=1$ and $x(q)=y$ , is then  \n\n$$\n\\pi_{q}=(1-\\beta-\\alpha+s_{q})y-F(s_{q}).\n$$  \n\nMonopolist $q$ is active when $\\pi_{q}\\geq0$ . Consumption and production decisions endogenously determine aggregate income at $t=1$ . Specifically, aggregate income, or equivalently, aggre  \n\ngate output, is the sum of corporate profits and labor income,  \n\n$$\ny=\\int_{q\\in{\\mathcal{A}}}\\left[\\left(1-\\beta-\\alpha+s_{q}\\right)y-F(s_{q})\\right]d q+L+\\int_{q\\in{\\mathcal{A}}}\\beta y d q,\n$$  \n\nwhere ${\\mathcal{A}}\\subset[0,1]$ is the set of sectors in which a monopolist is active at $t=1$ ：From Eq. (4), monitoring does not affect aggregate income $y$ for a given set of active monopolists $\\mathcal{A}$ : monitoring reduces the profit of each active monopolist by $\\beta y$ but increases labor income by the same amount. Rearranging Eq. (4) we obtain  \n\n$$\ny=\\frac{L-\\int_{q\\in A}F(s_{q})~d q}{1-\\int_{q\\in A}[1-\\alpha+s_{q}]~d q}.\n$$  \n\nFrom Eq. (5), we can derive the marginal impact on output $y$ of monopolist $i$ joining the set of active monopolists $\\mathcal{A}$ 4..  \n\n$$\nd y=\\frac{\\pi_{i}(y)+\\beta y}{1-\\int_{q\\in\\cal{A}}[1-\\alpha+s_{q}]d q}d i.\n$$  \n\nThis expression captures an important intuition for production decisions at $t=1$ :the contribution of the marginal active monopolist $i$ to output is that monopolist's profit $\\pi_{i}(y)$ plus the paid wage premium $\\beta y$ amplified by a multiplier $\\textstyle(1-\\int_{q\\in{\\cal A}}1-\\alpha+s_{q}d q)^{-1}$ , which is strictly greater than one as long as the set of active monopolists $\\mathcal{A}$ has a positive mass. This multiplier captures a demand ecternality: when $\\pi_{i}(y)+\\beta y$ is positive, the profit and the wage premium stimulates demand for other goods, which allows other active monopolists to take advantage of their increasing returns to scale technologies and increase their own profits.  \n\nNote that monopolist $i$ , by becoming active, generates $\\beta y$ as compensation for the supervisors′ monitoring cost, in addition to profit $\\pi_{i}(y)$ . Factoring in this monitoring cost $\\beta y$ in Eq. (6), the net impact of monopolist $\\imath$ 's decision to become active on consumers′ utility is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi_{i}(y)+\\beta y}{1-\\int_{q\\in\\cal A}[1-\\alpha+s_{q}]d q}-\\beta y.\n$$  \n\nThis expression shows how the demand multiplier $\\textstyle(1-\\int_{q\\in{\\cal A}}1-\\alpha+s_{q}d q)^{-1}$ and the monitoring cost $\\beta y$ combine to create a wedge between private and social incentives. The sign of a monopolist's profit $\\pi_{i}(y)$ and the sign of its impact on welfare (i.e., the sign of Eq. (7)) coincide if there is no multiplier (i.e., ${\\mathcal{A}}=\\{\\emptyset\\}$ $\\begin{array}{r}{(1-\\int_{q\\in\\mathcal{A}}1-\\alpha+s_{q}d q)^{-1}=1}\\end{array}$ ) in which case Eq. (7) reduces to $\\pi_{i}(y)$ . The misalignment of private and social incentives arises when $\\beta>0$ and a strictly positive mass of monopolists is active. In that case, monopolist $i$ internalizes the monitoring cost $\\beta y$ through the wage premium it pays, but not the multiplier effect of that additional compensation on the demand to other active monopolists $\\mathcal{A}$ . Specifically, if $\\begin{array}{r}{\\pi_{i}(y)<0<(\\pi_{i}(y)+\\beta y)(1-\\int_{q\\in A}1-\\alpha+s_{q}d q)^{-1}-\\beta y}\\end{array}$ , it is individually optimal for monopolist $i$ to leave the market, yet its net effect on consumers’ utility if it were to produce would be positive (i.e., Eq. (7) would be greater than zero).  \n\nThis misalignment creates scope for coordination failures. Consider the case in which all monopolists choose the same operating leverage $s$ at $t=0$ . Then, combining Eq. (3) and Eq. (4), a monopolist does not operate if no other monopolist operates (if ${\\mathcal{A}}=\\lbrace\\emptyset\\rbrace$ )when  \n\n$$\nL<{\\frac{F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}}.\n$$  \n\nConversely, a monopolist operates if all other monopolists operate (if $\\mathcal{A}=[0,1]$ )when  \n\n$$\nL>\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}.\n$$  \n\nTherefore, if  \n\n$$\nL\\in\\left({\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}},{\\frac{F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}}\\right),\n$$  \n\na high-output equilibrium in which all monopolists are active coexists with a low-output equilibrium in which the fringe takes over production. That second equilibrium is Paretodominated and embodies a coordination failure: each monopolist does not internalize that its individual decision to produce and pay a wage premium increases demand and hence, the other monopolists’ profits from producing. We summarize this discussion in the next lemma.  \n\nLemma 1. If all monopolists choose the same operating leverage at $t=0$ , then at $t=1$ : (i) $\\begin{array}{r}{L>\\frac{F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}}\\end{array}$ all monopolists operate;(i）if $\\begin{array}{r}{L<\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}}\\end{array}$ , no monopolist operates; and (i）i $\\begin{array}{r}{L\\in\\left(\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s},\\frac{F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}\\right)}\\end{array}$ , there is one equlibrium in which all monopolists operate  \n\n### 3.2. Global games and the production threshold  \n\nWhile the presence of multiple equilibria captures the idea of a coordination failure, the indeterminacy at the production stage at $t=1$ precludes the analysis of the operating leverage decision at $t=0$ .To resolve this indeterminacy, we now depart from Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny (1989) and apply a global games treatment. This is done by introducing dispersed information: at $t=1$ , each monopolist $q$ observes a noisy signal of $L$ ， $\\boldsymbol{l}_{q}=\\boldsymbol{L}+\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{q}$ ， where $\\xi_{q}$ is independent across monopolists and uniformly distributed on $[-\\varepsilon,\\varepsilon]$ . One can show there is no loss of generality in restricting attention to threshold strategies in which monopolist $q$ operates at $t=1$ if $l_{q}$ is above a threshold $l^{*}$ . Then, for a given $L$ , the mass of active monopolists is  \n\n$$\nn(L)\\equiv\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{{1}}&{{\\mathrm{if}L>l^{*}+\\varepsilon}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{\\frac{L+\\varepsilon-l^{*}}{2\\varepsilon}}}&{{\\mathrm{if}L\\in[l^{*}-\\varepsilon,l^{*}+\\varepsilon]}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{0}}&{{\\mathrm{if}L<l^{*}-\\varepsilon}}\\end{array}\\right..\n$$  \n\nWhen observing ${\\mathit{l}}_{q}={\\mathit{l}}^{*}$ , monopolist $q$ must be indifferent between producing or not,  \n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2\\varepsilon}\\int_{l^{*}-\\varepsilon}^{l^{*}+\\varepsilon}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)\\frac{L-n(L)F(s)}{1-n(L)(1-\\alpha+s)}-F(s)d L=0,\n$$  \n\nwhich uniquely pins down $l^{*}$ . Finally, a well-known property of global games is that equilibrium uniqueness carries over to the asymptotic case in which the noise in the signals vanishes, $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow0$ , and the information structure becomes arbitrarily close to common knowledge. In that case, solving for $l^{*}$ in Eq. (12) delivers the threshold on the underlying state $L$ above which production takes place,  \n\n$$\nL^{T}(s)\\equiv\\frac{F(s)}{1-\\alpha+s}+\\frac{\\beta F(s)}{(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha-s}\\right)}.\n$$  \n\nProposition 1. If all monopolists choose operating leverage s at $t=0$ and $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow0$ , then all monopolists operate at $t=1$ f $L\\geq L^{T}(s)$ and no monopolist operates at $t=1$ if $L<L^{T}(s)$  \n\nThe production equilibrium in Proposition 1 has two important features. First, the equilibrium bears an economically intuitive relation to fundamentals: monopolists are more likely to operate for higher realizations of the productivity shock $L$ . Notice that the production threshold belongs to the region in which multiple equilibria previously coexisted: $\\begin{array}{r}{L^{T}(s)\\in\\left(\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s},\\frac{F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}\\right)}\\end{array}$ inferior equilibrium for (@-F, LT(s), that is, for the lower realizations of the productivity shock, thereby maintaining scope for coordination failures. Second, the production threshold $L^{T}(s)$ is increasing in aggregate operating leverage $s$ :a more levered economy needs a higher productivity shock to coordinate on the production equilibrium at $t=1$ ; that is, operating leverage aggravates the coordination problem. Note also that, if monopolists were to choose zero operating leverage, there would no coordination failures at $t=1$ as monopolists would always produce (i.e., $L^{T}(0)=0$ ). Therefore, coordination failures will endogenously arise in the model because of monopolists? incentives to take on operating leverage. Next, we build on Proposition $^{1}$ to analyze these incentives and to derive the equilibrium operating leverage at $t=0$  \n\n### 3.3. Equilibrium operating leverage  \n\nThe distinct feature in our model is to allow each monopolist $q$ to calibrate its exposure to the aggregate shock $L$ through the choice of operating leverage $s_{q}$ ; that is, we endogenize risk-taking. To build intuition on the relation between operating leverage and risk, we start with two simple observations.  \n\nFirst, monopolist $q$ only produces at $t=1$ if $\\pi_{q}\\geq0$ , which, from Eq. (3), requires demand to be high enough: y ≥ 1-a-β+sa F-8)s. This income threshold, 1-a-B+sa' , increases with $s_{q}$ :a monopolist with higher operating leverage needs higher demand to cover its fixed cost $F(s_{q})$ ， and hence is more likely to exit the market at $t=1$ . The adverse effect of operating leverage on profits can extend to states in which demand is high enough to allow the monopolist to operate (i.e., $\\pi_{q}\\geq0$ ) yet too low for the lower marginal costs to outweigh the higher fixed costs: $\\frac{\\partial\\pi_{q}}{\\partial s_{q}}<0$ $\\begin{array}{r}{y<\\frac{\\alpha}{(\\alpha-s_{q})^{2}}}\\end{array}$ However, as dmad irea futh, highe lvera oms beneficial: $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{\\partial\\pi_{q}}{\\partial s_{q}}>0}\\end{array}$ >Oify> $\\begin{array}{r}{y>\\frac{\\alpha}{(\\alpha-s_{q})^{2}}}\\end{array}$ . Intuitively, operating leverage magnifies the impact of demand shocks on profts, ,  = Sq, and therefore is more aluable when demand is high. Second, shocks to demand $y$ are driven by shocks to labor productivity $L$ , as is apparent in Eq. (5). Operating leverage affects the relation between monopolists’ profits and this  \n\n$\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{\\partial\\pi_{q}}{\\partial L}=\\frac{\\partial\\pi_{q}}{\\partial y}.\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial L}}\\end{array}$ g = sq, is the direct exposure of profits $\\pi_{q}$ to demand $y$ , as discussed in the previous paragraph. The second one, $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial L}=(1-\\int_{i\\in A}1-\\alpha+s_{i}d i)^{-1}}\\end{array}$ , captures that shocks to $L$ are amplified by the demand multiplier, which itself depends on all active monopolists? leverages, $\\{s_{i}\\}_{i\\in\\mathcal{A}}$ . Hence, through demand externalities, a monopolist's leverage affects the transmission of productivity shock $L$ to aggregate demand $y$ , and therefore, the sensitivity of all other monopolists’ profits to this productivity shock. Via this demand externality channel, firms’ leverage decisions become interdependent and jointly determine aggregate risk.  \n\nWe analyze operating leverage decisions, focusing on symmetric equilibria. Specifically, suppose all monopolists choose non-cooperatively the same operating leverage $s$ at $t=0$ From Proposition 1, aggregate income is then given by  \n\n$$\ny(s,L)\\equiv\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{{\\frac{L-F(s)}{\\alpha-s}}}&{{\\mathrm{if~}L\\geq L^{T}(s)}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{.}}&{{}}\\ {{L}}&{{\\mathrm{if~}L<L^{T}(s)}}\\end{array}\\right..\n$$  \n\nIf monopolist $q$ were to choose operating leverage $s_{q}$ while all other monopolists choose $s$ monopolist $q$ would make a profit, and hence, produce when  \n\n$$\n\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}\\right)y(s,L)-F(s_{q})\\geq0,\n$$  \n\nor equivalently, when  \n\n$$\nL\\geq\\hat{L}(s_{q},s)\\equiv\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{\\operatorname*{max}\\bigg\\{(\\alpha-s)\\frac{F(s_{q})}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}}+F(s),L^{T}(s)\\bigg\\}}&{\\mathrm{if~}s_{q}\\geq s,}\\ {~}\\ {L\\geq\\hat{L}(s_{q},s)\\equiv\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{\\mathrm{id}_{\\alpha}\\geq0}&{\\mathrm{id}_{\\beta}\\leq s_{q}}\\ {~}\\ {\\mathrm{id}_{\\alpha}\\geq\\beta+s_{q}}&{\\mathrm{id}^{T}(s)\\leq s.}\\end{array}\\right.}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nThen $s^{*}$ is an equilibrium if and only if  \n\n$$\ns^{*}\\in\\underset{s_{q}}{\\mathrm{argmax}}\\int_{\\operatorname*{min}\\{\\hat{L}(s_{q},s^{*}),\\overline{{L}}\\}}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}\\right)y(s^{*},L)-F(s_{q})d L.\n$$  \n\nThe next proposition follows from this condition.  \n\nProposition 2. There exists a unique symmetric equilibrium $s^{*}$ definedby  \n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[y|L\\ge L^{T}(s^{*})\\right]-F^{\\prime}\\left(s^{*}\\right)=0.\n$$  \n\nTo understand the condition in Eq. (18), note that, from Eq. (17), operating leverage $s_{q}$ affects monopolist $q$ 's profit through two margins. The frst one is an extensive margin: changing $s_{q}$ affects monopolist $q$ 's production threshold $\\hat{L}(s_{q},s^{*})$ at $t=1$ , namely, the lower bound of the integral in Eq. (17). The extensive margin, $\\hat{L}(s_{q},s^{*})$ , does not enter the monopolist's frst order condition in Eq. (18). Intuitively, at $\\hat{L}(s^{*},s^{*})=L^{T}(s^{*})$ , monopolist $q$ 's profit is strictly positive only because other monopolists also produce. As $L$ falls below $L^{T}(s^{*})$ and other monopolists stop producing, monopolist $q$ 's profit from producing turns strictly negative, and the monopolist is better off stopping production as well. This holds when $s_{q}=s^{*}$ , but also, by continuity, for a range of values of $s_{q}$ below $s^{*}$ . Conversely, monopolist $q$ is better off producing at $L^{T}(s^{*})$ for a range of values of $s_{q}$ above $s^{*}$ . The rigidity of $\\hat{L}(s_{q},s^{*})$ with respect to $s_{q}$ around $s^{*}$ reflects the strength of strategic complementarities around the production threshold, which underlines the coordination failure. Consequently, the only relevant margin is an intensive one: changing $s_{q}$ affects monopolist $q$ 's profit taking the states in which it produces (i.e., the bounds of the integral in Eq. (17) as fixed. The condition in Eq. (18) states that there are no marginal gains in terms of profits along that intensive margin when monopolist $q$ chooses $s^{*}$ and produces for $L$ above $L^{T}(s^{*})=\\hat{L}(s^{*},s^{*})$ Note that this marginal reasoning only provides a necessary condition for optimality. Specifically, gains along the extensive margin become non-negligible as $s_{q}$ moves further away from $s^{*}$ . The proof of Proposition 2 in the Appendix shows that these large deviations can also be ruled out.  \n\nA key aspect in the above analysis is that the coordination failure at $t=1$ is unaffected by a unilateral change in leverage; that is, the leverage and production decisions of a single monopolist have a negligible effect on the aggregate income and therefore, on the production decisions of all the other monopolists at $t=1$ . We now ask whether welfare could improve if a social planner were to choose all monopolists' leverage. Specifically, we define the optimal leverage $s^{o p t}$ as the one maximizing consumers′ expected utility at $t=0$ given that monopolists behave at $t=1$ as per Proposition 1. Our social optimum is therefore constrained efficient: the social planner chooses leverage at $t=0$ but cannot avoid coordination failures at $t=1$ . Note finally that the extra labor income $\\beta y$ earned by supervisors in states in which monopolists are active merely compensates them for their effort cost and, therefore, labor income net of monitoring disutility always sums up to $L$ . Consequently, maximizing consumers′ expected utility amounts to maximizing their expected income from corporate profits:  \n\n$$\ns^{o p t}\\in\\underset{s}{\\arg\\operatorname*{max}}\\int_{\\operatorname*{min}\\{L^{T}(s),\\overline{{L}}\\}}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s\\right)y(s,L)-F(s)d L.\n$$  \n\nProposition 3. In the symmetric equilibrium, there is eccessive operating leverage: $s^{*}>$ sopt.  \n\nTo understand why equilibrium leverage is excessive, consider the first order derivative of the social planner objective function in Eq. (19) with respect to $s$ 5  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle\\int_{L^{T}(s)}^{\\overline{{L}}}y(s,L)-F^{\\prime}(s)d L+\\displaystyle\\int_{L^{T}(s)}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s\\right)\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial s}(s,L)d L}\\ {-\\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial L^{T}(s)}{\\partial s}[(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)y(s,L^{T}(s))-F(s)].}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThis derivative has three terms. The first one corresponds to the impact of leverage on each monopolist's profit, given that a monopolist produces for $L\\geq L^{T}(s)$ . From Eq. (18), this term is zero at $s=s^{*}$ : each monopolist optimizes along the intensive margin in equilibrium. The second term captures the demand externality that each monopolist exerts by stimulating demand $y$ for other active monopolists when $L\\geq L^{T}(s)$ .From Eq. (7), the equilibrium impact of monopolist $q$ on $y$ is $\\pi_{q}+\\beta y$ times a demand multiplier $(\\alpha-s^{*})^{-1}$ .(The equilibrium demand multiplier is $(\\alpha-s^{*})^{-1}$ for $L\\geq L^{T}(s)$ and $^{1}$ for $L<L^{T}(s)$ ) The monopolist does not internalize that the demand multiplier, $(\\alpha-s^{*})^{-1}$ , amplifies the contribution of its profit to output. However, because the equilibrium demand multiplier is constant for $L\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})$ , monopolist $q$ , when choosing $s_{q}$ to maximize its expected profit $\\pi_{q}$ along the intensive margin, also maximizes the expected externality it exerts on other monopolists across all states $L\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})$ . As a result, the second term in Eq. (20) also cancels out when evaluated at the equilibrium leverage: $\\begin{array}{r}{\\int_{L^{T}(s^{*})}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial s}(s^{*},L)d L=0}\\end{array}$ ， The equilibrium ineffciency goes through the impact of leverage on the lower bound of the monopolists’ production region $L^{T}(s)$ , which is captured by the third term in Eq. (20). As discussed earlier, if a monopolist were to unilaterally lower its leverage marginally, it would not produce in the neighborhood below $L^{T}(s^{*})$ at $t=1$ , as it anticipates all other monopolists will remain inactive. However, if a social planner constrains all monopolists to lower their operating leverage, coordination in production at $t=1$ changes: $\\frac{\\partial L^{\\prime}(s)}{\\partial s}>0$ . Specifically,. at the equilibrium leverage $s^{*}$ , a marginal decrease in the leverage of all monopolists lead them to switch from inactivity to production just below $L^{T}(s^{*})$ . Because $L^{T}(s^{*})$ belongs to the region in which monopolists being inactive is Pareto-dominated, inducing all of them to produce in that marginal state improves welfare by the corresponding aggregate profit $(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s^{*})y(s,L^{T}(s^{*}))-F(s^{*})>0$ . In other words, if monopolists could collectively commit to lowering their leverage at $t=0$ , they would increase their expected profits and raise welfare by expanding the range of states in which they coordinate on the Paretosuperior production decision at $t=1$ . They, however, have no unilateral incentive to do SO.  \n\nIt follows from the above discussion, that the excessive leverage result in Proposition 3 is inherently related to the monopolists? failure to coordinate production below $L^{T}(s)$ at $t=1$ In fact, our model establishes a direct relationship between the possibility of coordination failures at $t=1$ and the efficiency of the risk-taking decision at $t=0$ . To see this, consider the equilibrium in Lemma 1 and instead of applying a global games treatment, suppose monopolists always coordinate on the Pareto-superior production equilibrium; that is, assuming that for any common lverage s, frms produce at t =lif and only if L≥  \n\nProposition 4. If frms coordinate on the Pareto-superior production equilibrium at $t=1$ and a symmetric operating leverage equilibrium exists, it is unique and socially optimal.  \n\nProposition 4 highlights that constrained inefficiency in Proposition 3 is not related to the monitoring friction per se: equilibrium leverage is socially optimal with $\\beta>0$ as long as monopolists coordinate on the Pareto-superior equilibrium at $t=1$ . Hence, the possibility of coordination failures at $t=1$ , rather than their origin in itself, is what really matters for the excessive leverage result. In other words, the role in the model of the monitoring cost $\\beta$ is to create scope for these inefficient production outcomes at $t=1$ , but other sources of coordination failures can lead to the same result. Intuitively, absent coordination failures, the net social value of monopolists producing in the marginal state, that is at $\\begin{array}{r}{L=\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}}\\end{array}$ is equal to zero. By contrast, the net social value of monopolists producing at $L^{T}(s^{*})$ is strictly positive, which refects the coordination failure. This strictly positive value at  \n\n$L^{T}(s^{*})$ creates the social benefit of lowering aggregate leverage to extend production below $L^{T}(s^{*})$ , which monopolists fail to internalize.  \n\nThe inefficiency in Proposition 3 is a statement on the first moment of the output distribution: excessive operating leverage causes expected output to be lower in equilibrium than in the constrained optimum. Our model also shows that this loss in expected output compounds differential effects across states: output is actually higher than in the social optimum for high realizations of the productivity shock, but lower for low realizations. In addition, the transition from a Pareto-superior equilibrium with high production to the Pareto-inferior one with low production occurs through a larger drop in output in equilibrium than in the constrained optimum. This result is the combination of two forces: first, the economy is more levered in equilibrium than in the social optimum, $s^{*}>s^{o p t}$ ; and second, the drop into a low-production regime occurs for a higher realization of the productivity shock, $L^{T}(s^{*})>L^{T}(s^{o p t})$ . Summing up, the welfare loss caused by excess leverage occurs through a shift of the output distribution towards high-productivity states that comes at the cost of higher downside risk and lower expected output.  \n\n### 3.4. Evidence and empirical implications  \n\nIn the model, strategic complementarities are associated with demand spillovers, which is in line with the Keynesian narrative that attributes the bulk of business cycles to shifts in aggregate demand. Blanchard and Quah (1989) use structural VARs to provide evidence in support of the idea that business cycles are driven by shifts in aggregate demand. The same idea is corroborated by recent work that exploits the regional variation in business cycles, such as Mian and Suf (2014) and Beraja, Hurst, and Ospina (2019). Low aggregate demand is also considered to be an important force behind the Great Recession and the slow recovery from it. (See, for instance, Hall, 2011; Eggertsson and Krugman, 2012; and Mian, Rao, and Sufi, 2013.)  \n\nThe particular way in which frms gain exposure to aggregate shocks in the model, namely through increasing labor leverage, has the empirical advantage of being more directly observable when in general, risk-taking by firms is notoriously difficult to identify and may only be indirectly inferred from the variability of profit measures. Moreover, as we discuss below, the literature has identified labor leverage as a first-order determinant of firm risk. The starting points are two simple observations (see the discussion in Danthine and Donaldson, 2002): (i) labor costs are typically the main component of frms’ cost structures; and (i) labor costs are in large part fixed costs and consequently tend to vary less than income. For example, Donangelo, Gourio, Kehrig, and Palacios (2019) show that on average, a 1% reduction in sales leads to a 0.99% reduction in non-labor costs, but only to a 0.69% reduction in labor costs. Our model captures these two features by focusing on labor as a production factor and by assuming that firms’ organizational and technological choices generate costs that cannot be readily adjusted to demand shocks. At the same time, it is important for our results that labor leverage be a decision variable that can be calibrated in the long run. Holzhacker, Krishnan, and Mahlendorf (2015) and Aboody, Levi, and Weiss (2018) provide empirical evidence consistent with managers having the ability to rebalance operating leverage in response to changes in the regulatory environment. Merz and Yashiv (2007) present a structural model in which frms’ decisions to adjust their labor force are subject to a convex adjustment cost. Consistent with our setup, in their model, labor cost structures are both rigid in the short term and structural decision variables in the long term. Merz and Yashiv (2007) show that this framework helps to explain the volatility of firm values.  \n\nThe link between labor leverage and firm risk is an empirically well-documented relation that provides support for the transmission channel of the aggregate shock in our model. Beyond the previously discussed papers Danthine and Donaldson (2002) and Merz and Yashiv (2007), a growing literature in asset pricing and macro-finance seeks to explain asset prices through the magnifying impact of labor leverage. Donangelo, Gourio, Kehrig, and Palacios (2019) show that firms with higher labor leverage are more sensitive to aggregate shocks, and therefore have stocks with higher expected return. In fact, they argue that half of the value premium can be explained through labor leverage. While we do not model capital structure, the risk induced by labor leverage should be embedded into any claim that is junior to labor obligations, which includes not only equity, but also debt. Consistent with this idea, Faviloukis, Lin, and Zhao (2020) show that labor leverage forecasts credit spreads as well as credit risk in the cross-section of firms. The literature has also used structural breaks to assess the causal relation between labor leverage and firm risk. For instance, Simintzi, Vig, and Volpin (2015) find that frms tend to reduce financial leverage when employment protection rises; and Serfing (2016) finds that labor protection laws that make workers more costly to dismiss cause frms operating profts to be more volatile. Overall, there is consistent and widespread evidence of the importance of labor leverage for firm risk. This evidence lends support to the mechanism at play in our model and suggests that distortions to labor leverage are likely to have a material impact on output and, ultimately, welfare.  \n\nIn the paper, the distortion of operating leverage from a constrained optimum is tied to the possibility of coordination failures across firms. On the positive side, this leads to novel predictions. First, operating leverage is higher when demand spillovers are more important. In the model, the monitoring cost $\\beta$ and the compensation associated with it calibrates the magnitude of demand spillovers when monopolies start producing, and operating leverage is increasing in $\\beta$ . Identifying these spillovers is then a key empirical challenge. One possibility is to exploit firms’ geographical locations. For instance, Dougal, Parsons, and Titman (2014) show that firms′ investments are sensitive to investment by frms located in the same area even if those firms are in different industries. They argue this is suggestive of spillovers that could be rooted in consumption externalities between residents, like those at play in our model. Therefore, variations in geographical location could be used to proxy for the intensity of these spillover effects, with the caveat that location is in part endogenous. (See also Tuzel and Zhang, 2017.) Second, the effect of operating leverage is particularly pervasive when coordination failures are more likely to arise. Testing this prediction requires measures of firms’ ability to coordinate production and investment. For instance, common ownership can serve as a coordination device by inducing shareholders to internalize the demand externality. Weinstein and Yafeh (1995) show that Japanese firms that belong to a Keiretsu behave differently from those that do not. Their results suggest that the pattern of cross-ownership that characterizes these large multiindustry corporate groups induce them to produce at a higher level than those maximizing individual frms profits, consistent with coordination motives. Recent studies on common ownership (e.g., Azar, Schmalz, and Tecu, 2018) argue that large institutional investors play a coordinating role within and across industries. Interestingly, this literature also identifies plausibly exogenous shocks to common ownership -mergers between asset managers- that could help with identification. Finally, government intervention and a strong public sector can also have a role in preventing economic crises by reducing the likelihood of a coordination failure. For instance, a countercyclical public policy of stimulating the economy in the low productivity states can have a stabilizing effect by means of coordinating production. The role of public policy is explored in detail in Section 4 below. On the normative side, our model predicts that in the presence of demand externalities, operating leverage is inefficiently high in that expected output is too low. The model also predicts that this depressed output is related to an excessive exposure of the economy to recession risk. Taking this prediction to the data would likely require a structural approach, where one could run counterfactuals and obtain an estimate of the output loss. One step in that direction are quantitative models of business cycles that embed coordination problems such as Schaal and Taschereau-Dumouchel (2018, 2019). These models can quantitatively account for the slow recovery that follows large aggregate shocks as agents coordinate on inefficient low-output equilibria. Incorporating a labor leverage decision would be the next step. Nonetheless, there is evidence supporting the idea that volatility is harmful in terms of economic growth, particularly in developing economies. For instance, Hnatkovska and Loayza (2005) show that the volatility due to crises has outsized effects on the growth of developing countries relative to the volatility due to normal fuctuations. More generally, the relation between recession risk and growth is consistent with a stream of papers initiated by the finding in Ramey and Ramey (1995) that output volatility and output growth are negatively correlated.  \n\n## 4. Public policy  \n\nThis section analyzes the role of public policy: how government intervention at the production stage feeds back into firms’ production and operating leverage decisions. Specifically, we assume the government can intervene at $t=1$ to coordinate production among an $m$ mass of monopolists where $m\\in[0,1)$ . The rest of the monopolists, of mass $(1-m)$ ,are as in the baseline model. The $m$ -mass of monopolists differ from the other $(1-m)$ -mass of monopolists in the economy in two ways. First, the $m$ -mass of monopolists can share their private signals $\\boldsymbol{l}_{q}=\\boldsymbol{L}+\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_{q}$ with the government which, therefore, learns $L$ perfectly. Second, the government can commit to having the $m$ -mass of monopolists produce in a given set of states -realizations of $L-$ even if producing in some of these states yields negative profits. In that case, the government could finance these losses through a lump-sum tax.  \n\nNatural interpretations of the $m$ -mass of monopolists are the size of the public sector, the number of government-controlled firms, or the number of sectors in which the government has the capacity to infuence production decisions, possibly through subsidies or investment tax credits. Note that this extension nests the baseline model, which corresponds to the case with $m=0$ . As in the baseline model, we use global games techniques to pin down the production strategy of the $m$ -mass of monopolists not controlled by the government, and we focus on the case in which the noise in the private signals about $L$ vanishes: $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow0$ The following proposition characterizes the resulting equilibrium of the production game at $t=1$  \n\nProposition 5. Suppose all monopolists choose operating leverage $s$ at $t=0$ . There ecists a government strategy such that when $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow0$ , all monopolists produce if  \n\n$$\nL\\geq\\frac{F(s)}{1-\\alpha+s}+\\frac{\\beta(1-m)F(s)}{(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)\\ln\\left(\\frac{1-m(1-\\alpha+s)}{\\alpha-s}\\right)}\\equiv L^{T}(s,m),\n$$  \n\nand no monopolist produces if $L<L^{T}(s,m)$ . The threshold $L^{T}(s,m)$ is strictly decreasing in m from $L^{T}(s,0)=L^{T}(s)$ , the production threshold in the baseline model in Eq. (13), to LT(s, 1) = (-β)F(, , the Pareto-optimal production threshold.  \n\nThe main insight of Proposition 5 is that government control over the production of a fraction $m$ of monopolists alleviates the coordination problem at $t=1$ for all monopolists. Indeed, the government's commitment to have an $m$ -mass of monopolists produce for $L\\geq L^{T}(s,m)$ creates a positive demand externality on the other $(1-m)$ -mass of monopolists, which induces them to produce as well. Specifically, for $L\\in[L^{T}(s,m),L^{T}(s,0))$ , the government's commitment shifts the economy from an equilibrium in which no monopolist produces to a Pareto-improving equilibrium in which all monopolists produce and are making strictly positive profits.  \n\nProposition 5 also shows that if $m<1$ , the government's strategy alleviates the coordination problem but does not eliminate it completely: for (F,LT(s, m)) monopolists are still not producing, which is Pareto-dominated by all monopolists producing. However, the equilibrium in Proposition 5 is the best government can do at $t=1$ to coordinate production. Corollary 1. Suppose all monopolists choose operating leverage s at $t=0$ .When $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow0$ ， monopolists producing if and only if $L\\geq L^{T}(s,m)$ is constrained effcient at $t=1$  \n\nIntuitively, while the government can coordinate production among an $m$ -mass of monopolists, the other $(1-m)$ -mass of monopolists still face a coordination problem. Because of this coordination problem, the $(1-m)$ -mass of monopolists do not produce below $L^{T}(s,m)$ , even if they expect the $m$ -mass of government-controlled monopolists to produce. Then, given that the $(1-m)$ -mass of monopolists never produce below $L^{T}(s,m)$ , it is Pareto-optimal for the government to have the $m$ -mass of monopolists also abstain from producing below $L^{T}(s,m)$ : their producing in that region would generate losses that decrease welfare with no effect on the behavior of the other $(1-m)$ -mass of monopolists. Note finally that in this constrained optimum, no monopolist ever makes losses when it operates, including the $m$ -mass controlled by the government, and hence no taxation is required in equilibrium. In that sense, while the government's commitment to production by the $m$ -mass of monopolists is useful in shifting the behavior of the $(1-m)$ -mass of monopolists, it does not generate costs for the former monopolists or the government.  \n\nWe now turn to the choice of operating leverage at $t=0$ . Monopolists choose their operating leverage to maximize expected profits. Since all monopolists produce if and only if $L\\ge$ $L^{T}(s,m)$ at $t=1$ , they all face the same optimization problem at $t=0$ , which is equivalent to the one in Eq. (17) except for the fact that now $\\hat{L}(s_{q},s^{*})$ depends on threshold $L^{T}(s,m)$ The following proposition characterizes the equilibrium operating leverage at $t=0$  \n\nProposition 6. There is a unique equilibrium operating leverage $s^{*}(m)$ which is the solution to  \n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[y|L\\geq L^{T}(s^{*}(m),m)\\right]-F^{\\prime}(s^{*}(m))=0.\n$$  \n\nThis equilibrium $s^{*}(m)$ is strictly decreasing in $m$  \n\nProposition 6 is equivalent to Proposition 2 in the main model and has the same interpretation. More specifically, similar to condition in Eq. (18), condition in Eq. (22) states that there are no marginal gains in terms of profits along that intensive margin when monopolist $q$ chooses $s^{*}(m)$ and produces for $L$ above $L^{T}(s^{*}(m),m)$ . Proposition 6, however, has the additional implication that $s^{*}(m)$ is decreasing in $m$ . Therefore, the government's commitment to inducing production above $L^{T}(s,m)$ at $t=1$ has two effects: (i) improving coordination at $t=1$ for a given operating leverage $s$ (i.e., from Proposition 5, $L^{T}(s,m)<L^{T}(s,0)$ for $m>0$ ); and (i) reducing operating leverage at $t=0$ (i.e., Proposition 6, $s^{*}(m)<s^{*}(0)$ for $m>0$ ). As we show next, these two effects increase welfare.  \n\nSince maximizing welfare is akin to maximizing corporate profits (see Eq. (19), let $W(s,m)$ be the welfare function for an economy with operating leverage $s$ andan $m$ -massof  \n\ngovernment-controlled monopolists:  \n\n$$\nW(s,m)\\equiv\\int_{\\operatorname*{min}\\{L^{T}(s,m),\\overline{{L}}\\}}^{\\overline{{L}}}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)\\frac{L-F(s)}{\\alpha-s}-F(s)d L.\n$$  \n\nProposition 7 below shows that welfare increases in $m$  \n\nProposition 7. $W(s^{*}(m),m)$ is strictly increasing in m. When $m\\to1$ , operating leverage and production decisions tend to the first-best optimal.  \n\nThe intuition for Proposition 7 is directly related to the two above-mentioned effects. First, the government's intervention prevents coordination failures in production at $t~=~1$ for a given $s$ (i.e., oW(sm) > 0).  Second, the government's intervention that mitigates the coordination problem at $t=1$ has the additional benefit of curbing excessive operating leverage at $t=0$ (i.e, $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{\\partial W(s,m)}{\\partial s}\\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial m}>0.}\\end{array}$ ). Therefore, a government that can credibly commit to stimulating the economy in low productivity states has a stabilizing effect by both avoiding abrupt transitions between high- and low-production regimes ex post and inducing lower leverage ex ante. Importantly, government intervention at $t=1$ can only be fully effective if it is anticipated at $t=0$ and, therefore, if it has the effect of reducing the equilibrium operating leverage at $t=0$ . In other words, a lack of credibility to intervene in the future generates excess operating leverage ex ante, which in turn, magnifies the need for government intervention ex post. Note also that Proposition 7 is a statement on expected profits, but the increase in welfare compounds differential effects across states: there is a decrease in downside risk at the cost of a worse economic performance in high productivity states.  \n\nOverall, our results indicate that public policy can be an efficient instrument to curb risktaking and prevent crises. Rodrik (1998） provides evidence consistent with the idea that government spending plays a risk-reducing role in economies exposed to a significant amount of external risk.  \n\nFinally, note that we have allowed for the government to intervene at $t=1$ to coordinate production but not at $t=0$ to lower operating leverage. (The lower operating leverage at $t=0$ when goverment can coordinate production among an $m$ -mass of monopolists at $t=1$ , i.e., $s^{*}(m)<s^{*}(0)$ , is the byproduct of monopolists anticipating a lower production threshold at $t=1$ ) In doing so, this section highlights the stabilizing effect that a policy of stimulating the economy in low-productivity states has by means of coordinating production. Naturally, however, the excessive leverage result we focus on in the baseline model generalizes to this extension: lowering all monopolists’ operating leverage from the equilibrium level in Proposition 7 can also raise welfare. This suggests that another lever for government intervention would be to directly induce the $m$ -mass of monopolists to lower their operating leverage to below the equilibrium level in Proposition 7.  \n\n## 5. Discussion  \n\n### 5.1. Sources of coordination failure  \n\nAs previously discussed, the role of the monitoring friction is to generate equilibrium multiplicity and the possibility of a coordination failure at the production stage. Our assumption is isomorphic to one in Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny (1989) but it also lends itself to a natural extension in which workers perceive a rent.6 Suppose that when supervisors do not exert effort, there is now a small but strictly positive probability $p$ that the product is functional. In that case, if supervisors are protected by limited liability, incentivizing monitoring requires leaving each supervisor with a pay equal to $\\beta/(1-p)>\\beta$ per unit, which is strictly higher than the supervisor's monitoring cost. The severity of the moral hazard friction (i.e., the magnitude of this rent) aggravates equilibrium inefficiencies through two channels. First, a higher rent makes monopolists more likely to coordinate on the non-productive equilibrium at $t=1$ . This is because monopolists internalize the rent as a real cost, while it merely is a redistribution of surplus from shareholders to workers. The higher incidence of coordination failures at $t=1$ lowers consumers’ expected utility, keeping operating leverage constant. Second, the incremental production inefficiency at $t=1$ induces monopolists to increase their operating leverage at $t=0$ . Intuitively, more frequent coordination failures make all monopolists less likely to survive a bad shock, which increases the weight of high-productivity states in each monopolist's leverage optimization problem. As a result equilibrium operating leverage moves further away from the social optimum, amplifying the ex post production inefficiency and depressing welfare. The following proposition formalizes this discussion.  \n\nProposition 8. In any symmetric equilibrium, there is excessive operating leverage, and an increase in p increases operating leverage and decreases welfare.  \n\nProposition 8 establishes that rents increase operating leverage and decrease welfare by creating a misalignment between firms’ objective functions and consumers’ welfare. Note that this misalignment aggravates the inefficiency in risk-taking but is not necessary to generate it. As Proposition 3 shows, even when rents are absent ( $p=0$ )and maximizing aggregate corporate profits coincide with maximizing consumers′ welfare (see Eq. (19)), the coordination problem between firms persists, which makes production and operating leverage decisions suboptimal.  \n\nFinally, Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny (1989) provide other mechanisms beyond moral hazard that lead to equilibrium multiplicity in the presence of demand externalities, for instance, when firms invest to generate future labor savings. Therefore, while our modelling choice is both technically convenient as well economically relevant -information frictions are pervasive in large organizations-, it is not the only way to generate a coordination failure in the context of the modelled economy. Moreover, as emphasized by Proposition 4, the excessive operating leverage at $t=0$ is caused by the coordination failure at $t=1$ in itself, rather than by the specific origin of the coordination failure.  \n\n### 5.2. State-dependent multiplier  \n\nIn our model, the inefficiency operates through the impact that monopolists leverage decisions have on the probability of a coordination failure, that is, it operates through the extensive margin. However, monopolists’ leverage decisions also affect each other's profitability in every state $L\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})$ in which they produce, that is, it affects the intensive margin. So far, the incentives of monopolists and the social planner have been aligned along the intensive margin because the demand multiplier has been constant across all states in which monopolists produce. (See Eq. (20) and the discussion that follws.) Shleifer and Vishny (1988) show that a misalignment of public and private incentives to produce can arise along the intensive margin if the demand multiplier is not constant across states. By shutting down this channel, our model is designed to isolate the effect of ex post coordination failures on ex ante risk-taking (Proposition 3). We explore next how a misalignment along the intensive margin would affect operating leverage decisions.  \n\nAs will become clear below, one way to endogenously make the demand multiplier statecontingent is to introduce heterogeneity among monopolists.7 Specifically, we assume that all monopolists have the same fixed cost, $\\textstyle F(s_{q})={\\frac{s_{q}}{\\alpha-s_{q}}}$ , but a proportion $n_{i}$ of monopolists have marginal cost $\\alpha+\\Delta_{i}-s_{q}$ , where $i=1,2$ ， $n_{i}+n_{j}=1$ ， $\\alpha+\\Delta_{i}<1$ , and $\\Delta_{1}\\neq\\Delta_{2}$ . To isolate the effect of heterogeneity on operating leverage decisions, we rule out coordination failures at the production stage by assuming that $\\beta=0$ . The next proposition characterizes the efficiency of the equilibrium operating leverage at $t=0$  \n\nProposition 9. Any symmetric equilibrium in which type- $i$ monopolistschoose $s_{i}^{*}$ isconstrained inefficient: the equilibrium features insufcient operating leverage in that increasing  \n\nTo understand the intuition behind Proposition 9, note first that, since there are no coordination failures at $t=1$ （ $\\beta=0$ ), production is ex post efficient. As a result, monopolists' and social planer's incentives to take on operating leverage are aligned along the extensive margin. However, private and public incentives no longer align along the intensive margin. While in the main model all monopolists have the same operating threshold, here, the production threshold depends on the monopolist's type. Assume without loss of generality that type $i$ monopolists have a lower production threshold $L_{i}^{T}$ than type $j$ monopolists $L_{j}^{T}$ , that is, for $L\\in[L_{i}^{T},L_{j}^{T})$ only type $i$ monopolists operate while for $L\\in[L_{j}^{T},\\overline{{L}}]$ both types operate. This implies that the demand multiplier is no longer constant across states in which a monopolist is active: it is equal to $(1-n_{i}(1-\\alpha-\\Delta_{i}+s_{i}^{*}))^{-1}$ for $L\\in[L_{i}^{T},L_{j}^{T})$ and $(1-n_{i}(1-\\alpha-\\Delta_{i}+s_{i}^{*})-n_{j}(1-\\alpha-\\Delta_{j}+s_{j}^{*}))^{-1}$ for $L\\in[L_{j}^{\\prime},L]$ . Since $(1-n_{i}(1-\\alpha-\\Delta_{i}+s_{i}^{*})-n_{j}(1-\\alpha-\\Delta_{j}+s_{j}^{*}))^{-1}>(1-n_{i}(1-\\alpha-\\Delta_{i}+s_{i}^{*}))^{-1},$ a marginal unit of profit has a higher welfare impact when $L\\in[L_{j}^{T},\\overline{{L}}]$ than when $L\\in[L_{i}^{T},L_{j}^{T})$ . As a result, maximizing expected profit is no longer equivalent to maximizing expected welfare. Relative to a monopolist, a social planner has a higher willingness to shift profits from $[L_{i}^{T},L_{j}^{T})$ to $[L_{j}^{T},\\overline{{L}}]$ because the welfare impact per unit of profit is higher in $[L_{j}^{I},L]$ than in $[L_{i}^{T},L_{j}^{T})$ Thic ic ovactly what highor onoratino lovoravo achiovee 8  \n\nOverall, contrasting the insuffcient leverage result in Proposition 9 with our main result of excessive leverage in Proposition 3 stresses that coordination failures have a distinct directional effect on ex ante risk-taking decisions. While the analysis in the current section suggests that risk-taking decisions can be distorted in more than one way, the importance of the excessive leverage result of Proposition 3 is commensurate to the role that coordination failures play in explaining crises and recessions, as discussed at the end of Section 3. In that sense, the inefficiencies in Proposition 3 and Proposition 9 speak to different concerns about the distribution of output across states of the economy. In Proposition 9, insuffcient leverage prevents the economy from fully exploiting demand spillovers after a positive productivity shock, while in Proposition 3, excessive leverage makes the economy too exposed to a negative productivity shock. To the extent that recessions and crises infict material and long-lasting damages, that second channel ought to be of particular significance.  \n\n### 5.3. Operating leverage specification  \n\nIn the paper, frms decide their cost structure by trading off higher fixed labor costs for lower variable costs. Specifically, monopolist $q$ incurs a fixed cost of $\\begin{array}{r}{F(s_{q})=\\frac{s_{q}}{\\alpha-s_{q}}}\\end{array}$ units of labor and a constant marginal cost of $\\alpha-s_{q}$ units of labor per unit of output, where $s_{q}\\in[0,\\alpha]$ is choice variable that captures operating leverage. The function $F(s_{q})$ is increasing, convex, and tends to infinity as $s_{q}\\to\\alpha$ , which guarantees that the equilibrium operating leverage $s^{*}$ is smaller than $\\alpha$ (and hence, that variable costs are positive).  \n\nBecause the monopolist's optimization problem with respect to $s_{q}$ in Eq. (17) is not convex, local optimality conditions are not sufficient for global optimality, and large deviations also need to be ruled out. The function we chose for $F(s_{q})$ ， $\\frac{s_{q}}{\\alpha-s_{q}}$ provides the necessary analytical tractability for studying large deviations to determine existence. (See the proof of Proposition 2 in the Appendix.) However, the local necessary condition that characterizes the equilibrium in Proposition 2 holds for a generic increasing and convex function. Moreover, around this local equilibrium condition, there is excessive operating leverage, as in Proposition 3. The logic is also identical to the one previously discussed for Proposition 3: at the equilibrium leverage $s^{*}$ , a marginal decrease in the leverage of all monopolists lead them to switch from iactivity to production just below $L^{T}(s^{*})$ (ie, LT(s > 0), which improves welfare. This highlights once again that the excessive leverage result is driven by the monopolists’ failure to coordinate production below $L^{T}(s^{*})$ at $t=1$ , and not by the chosen functional form for the fixed cost. The following proposition formalizes this discussion.  \n\nProposition 1o. Consider a generic increasing and convex function $F(.)$ ,any symmetric interior equilibrium $s^{*}$ at $t~=~1$ satisfies condition in Eq. (18) in Proposition $\\mathcal{L}$ ,and a collective marginal decrease in operating leverage around $s^{*}$ increases welfare.  \n\n## 6. Conclusion  \n\nCoordination failures are often invoked to explain periods of recession and crises in which economies appear to be trapped in down-cycles of low output, trading, and investment. In essence, the literature views economies as interdependent systems in which agents need to coordinate their investment and consumption decisions. We show that these economies leature excessive operatig ieverage ds lrnis uo not iternaize tie enect tnat tnelr lisK choices have on the probability of the economy suffering a coordination failure. The excessive operating leverage increases downside risk and causes expected output to be lower than in the social optimum. The loss in expected output compounds differential effects across states: There is a shift in output towards high-productivity states that comes at the cost of more frequent and severe economic crises. The analysis has implications for public policy: a countercyclical policy that stimulates the economy in low productivity states has a stabilizing effect by both, avoiding coordination failures ex post and curving excessive risk ex ante. While our model emphasizes the role of demand externalities because of its economic importance, strategic complementarities across economic agents have been shown to arise through a broad variety of channels (e.g., thick market externalities, technological complementarities, and imperfect information). These other sources of strategic complementarities can also generate multiple equilibria and create scope for coordination failures. In general, we expect the same economic forces to apply in setups with these alternative sources. Indeed, as long as risk increases the probability of a coordination failure and agents do not internalize this effect, agents will tend to engage in excessive risk-taking. Strategic complementarities are notably important in the financial system as ilustrated by recurrent financial crises. Specifically, the liquidity transformation role of financial institutions combined with the fact that these institutions form a highly interconnected network makes financial systems particularly vulnerable to coordination failures. Our analysis suggests that a concentrated financial system is more stable in that financial institutions internalize, to a larger extent, the effect that their risk choices have on the probability of a systemic financial crisis. Alternatively, it also suggests that a more disperse financial system requires stricter regulation to curve excessive risk-taking. The analysis of these effects in the specific context of an economy with a financial system is an interesting avenue for future research.  \n\n# References  \n\nAboody, D., Levi, S., Weiss, G., 2018.

For most of our results, this assumption boils downto $\\overline{{L}}>2$  \n\n## Proof of Proposition 1  \n\nSuppose all firms choose $s$ , and firm $q$ observes a noisy signal of $L$ : a signal $\\boldsymbol{l}_{q}=\\boldsymbol{L}+\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{q}$ where $\\xi_{q}$ is uniform on $[-\\varepsilon,\\varepsilon]$ . Suppose firm $q$ produces iff ${\\mathit{l}}_{q}>{\\mathit{l}}^{*}$ . Then, for a given realization of $L$ , the number of frms that produce is  \n\n$$\nn(L)\\equiv\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{{1}}&{{\\mathrm{if~}L>l^{*}+\\varepsilon}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{\\underbrace{L+\\varepsilon-l^{*}}_{2\\varepsilon}}}&{{\\mathrm{if~}L\\in[l^{*}-\\varepsilon,l^{*}+\\varepsilon]}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{0}}&{{\\mathrm{if~}L<l^{*}-\\varepsilon}}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nThe firm with signal $l^{*}$ must be indifferent:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2\\varepsilon}\\int_{l^{*}-\\varepsilon}^{l^{*}+\\varepsilon}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)\\frac{L-n(L)F}{1-n(L)(1-\\alpha+s)}-F d L=0.\n$$  \n\nConsider the follwing change of variable: $\\begin{array}{r}{z=\\frac{L+\\varepsilon-l^{*}}{2\\varepsilon}\\Leftrightarrow L=2\\varepsilon z+l^{*}-\\varepsilon}\\end{array}$ Eq. (A.2) becomes  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{2\\varepsilon}\\int_{0}^{1}\\left\\{(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)\\frac{2\\varepsilon z+l^{\\ast}-\\varepsilon-n(2\\varepsilon z+l^{\\ast}-\\varepsilon)F}{1-n(2\\varepsilon z+l^{\\ast}-\\varepsilon)(1-\\alpha+s)}-F\\right\\}2\\varepsilon d z=0}\\ &{\\displaystyle\\Leftrightarrow\\int_{0}^{1}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)\\frac{2\\varepsilon z+l^{\\ast}-\\varepsilon-z F}{1-z(1-\\alpha+s)}-F d z=0.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nTaking the limit when $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow0$ and defining $L^{T}(s)$ as the limit of $l^{*}$ when $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow0$ ,Eq. (A.4) writes  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\int_{0}^{1}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)\\frac{L^{T}(s)-z F}{1-z(1-\\alpha+s)}-F d z=0}\\ &{\\Leftrightarrow\\frac{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}{1-\\alpha+s}\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{(1-\\alpha+s)L^{T}(s)-z(1-\\alpha+s)F}{1-z(1-\\alpha+s)}d z-F=0}\\ &{\\Leftrightarrow\\frac{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}{1-\\alpha+s}\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{(1-\\alpha+s)L^{T}(s)-F}{1-z(1-\\alpha+s)}d z-\\frac{\\beta}{1-\\alpha+s}F=0}\\ &{\\Leftrightarrow-\\frac{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}{(1-\\alpha+s)^{2}}\\left[(1-\\alpha+s)L^{T}(s)-F\\right]\\ln(\\alpha-s)-\\frac{\\beta}{1-\\alpha+s}I}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nTherefore  \n\n$$\nL^{T}(s)={\\frac{F}{1-\\alpha+s}}+{\\frac{\\beta F}{(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)\\ln\\left({\\frac{1}{\\alpha-s}}\\right)}}.\n$$  \n\nIt is apparent that the RHS of Eq. (A.4) is increasing in $l^{*}$ , which guarantees the uniqueness of an equilibrium in threshold strategies for any $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ . Now, iterated deletion of strictly dominated strategies ensure global uniqueness in a setting with global strategic complementarities (see, e.g., Morris and Shin, 2003). One potential concern here is that monopolists' actions are not complement if $L$ is small enough. Specifically, letting $n$ be the fraction of  \n\nmonopolists who produce,  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{\\partial\\pi}{\\partial n}}\\geq0\\Leftrightarrow L\\geq{\\frac{F(s)}{1-\\alpha+s}}.\n$$  \n\nNote however, that  \n\n$$\n\\frac{F(s)}{1-\\alpha+s}<\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s},\n$$  \n\ni.e., the region where the frms' actions are not strategic complement is strictly smaller than the upper bound of the lower-dominance region. Therefore if  \n\n$$\n2\\varepsilon<\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}-\\frac{F(s)}{1-\\alpha+s},\n$$  \n\na private signal $l_{q}$ consistent with $\\begin{array}{r}{L\\ge\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}}\\end{array}$ rules out L< 1-α+s Fs (ie., ensures that L is in the region where actions are complement). This, in turn, allows to apply the standard iterated deletion of strictly dominated strategies. It follows that the threshold equilibrium derived in Eq. (A.4) is the unique equilibrium for $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ small enough, hence when $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow0$ $\\it Q.E.D$  \n\n## Proof of Proposition 2  \n\n### Part I. Proof of Proposition 2: Local Conditions.  \n\nSuppose monopolist $q$ chooses $s_{q}$ and all other monopolists choose $s^{*}\\in(0,\\alpha)$  \n\n(a) If no other monopolist operate, monopolist $q$ operates if  \n\n$$\nL>L_{-}(s_{q})\\equiv\\frac{F(s_{q})}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}}.\n$$  \n\nSince (i) $\\alpha+\\beta<1$ ， $L_{-}^{\\prime}(s_{q})>0$ ; (ii) $\\beta>0$ ， $L_{-}(s^{*})>L^{T}(s^{*})$ (from Eq. (A.9)); and (ii) $L_{-}(0)=0<L^{T}(s^{*})$ , there is a unique $s_{-}$ such that $L_{-}(s_{-})=L^{T}(s^{*})$ and $s_{-}<s^{*}$ If $L<L^{T}(s^{*})$ and $s_{q}<s_{-}$ ， $q$ operates iff $L>L_{-}(s_{q})$ .If $L<L^{T}(s^{*})$ and $s_{q}>s_{-}$ ， $q$ never operates.  \n\n(b)  If all other monopolist operate, monopolist $q$ operates if  \n\n$$\nL>L_{+}(s_{q})\\equiv(\\alpha-s^{*})\\frac{F(s_{q})}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}}+F(s^{*}),\n$$  \n\nSince (i) $L_{+}^{\\prime}(s_{q})>0$ ;(i) $\\beta>0$ ， $L_{+}(s^{*})<L^{T}(s^{*})$ (from Eq. (A.9)); and $\\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\to\\alpha}L_{+}(s)=}\\end{array}$ $+\\infty$ , there is a unique $s_{+}<\\alpha$ such that $L_{+}(s_{+})=L^{T}(s^{*})$ and $s_{+}>s^{*}$ . If $L>L^{T}(s^{*})$ and $s_{q}>s_{+}$ ， $q$ operates if $L>L_{+}(s_{q})$ . If $L>L^{T}(s^{*})$ and $s_{q}<s_{+}$ ， $q$ always operates.  \n\n(a) and (b) implies that  \n\n$$\nL\\geq\\hat{L}(s_{q},s^{*})\\equiv\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{(\\alpha-s^{*})\\displaystyle\\frac{F(s_{q})}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}}+F(s^{*})}&{\\mathrm{if~}s_{q}\\geq s_{+},}\\ &{\\mathrm{if~}s_{q}\\in(s^{*},s_{+}),}\\ {L^{T}(s^{*})}&{\\mathrm{if~}s_{q}\\in(s^{*},s_{+}),}\\ {L^{T}(s^{*})}&{\\mathrm{if~}s_{q}\\in(s_{-},s^{*}),}\\ {\\displaystyle\\frac{F(s_{q})}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}}}&{\\mathrm{if~}s_{q}\\leq s_{-}.}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nThe monopolist optimization problem writes (see Eq. (17))  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{max}_{s_{q}}\\int_{\\operatorname*{min}\\{\\hat{L}(s_{q},s^{*}),\\overline{{L}}\\}}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}\\right)y(s^{*},L)-F(s_{q})d L,\n$$  \n\nand therefore, since the optimal $s_{q}$ is such that $\\hat{L}(s_{q},s^{*})<\\overline{{L}}$ , and since Eq. (A.15) implies that $\\begin{array}{r}{\\left|\\frac{\\partial\\hat{L}(s_{q},s^{*})}{\\partial s_{q}}\\right|_{s_{q}=s^{*}}=0}\\end{array}$ , the first-order condition for an interior solution to the monopolist optimization problem writes  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{E\\left[y|L\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})\\right]-F^{\\prime}\\left(s^{*}\\right)=0}\\ &{\\Leftrightarrow\\left(\\frac{\\overline{{L}}+L^{T}(s^{*})}{2}-F(s^{*})\\right)\\frac{1}{\\alpha-s^{*}}-F^{\\prime}(s^{*})=0}\\ &{\\Leftrightarrow\\overline{{L}}=\\frac{1}{\\alpha-s^{*}}\\left[2(\\alpha+s^{*})-\\frac{s^{*}}{1-\\alpha+s^{*}}-\\frac{\\beta s^{*}}{(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s^{*})\\ln{\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha-s^{*}}\\right)}}\\right]}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIf $s^{*}=0$ , the RHS of Eq. (A.19)) is equal to 2. If $s^{*}\\to\\alpha$ , the RHS of Eq. (A.19) tends to $+\\infty$ . It follows that if $\\overline{{L}}>2$ , Eq. (A.19) has at least one solution. Rewrite, Eq. (A.19) as  \n\n$$\n\\alpha\\overline{{L}}=2\\alpha+s^{\\ast}\\underbrace{\\Bigg(2+\\overline{{L}}-\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha+s^{\\ast}}-\\frac{\\beta}{(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s^{\\ast})\\ln{\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha-s^{\\ast}}\\right)}}\\Bigg)}_{\\equiv f(s^{\\ast})}\n$$  \n\nSince $f^{\\prime}(.)>0$ and $\\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\to\\alpha}f(s)=1+L>0}\\end{array}$ implies there exists $\\hat{s}$ (possibly equal to $0$ such that $f(s)>0$ if $s>\\hat{s}$ $L>2$ implies that at $s=0$ , the RHS is lower than $2\\alpha$ and therefore, $s\\in[0,\\hat{s})$ cannot be a solution to Eq. (A.20) since for $s\\in[0,\\hat{s})$ , the RHS is also lower than $2\\alpha$ . If $s>\\hat{s}$ , then $f(s)>0$ and $f^{\\prime}(s)>0$ imply that the RHS of Eq. (A.20) is strictly increasing. Therefore, Eq. (A.20) has a unique solution. Hence, if there exists a symmetric equilibrium, this equilibrium is unique, interior (i.e., $s^{*}\\in(0,\\alpha)$ ) and defined by the f.o.c. in Eq. (A.17).  \n\nThe frst-order condition in Eq. (A.17) gives a necessary condition for a symmetric equilibrium to exists as otherwise firm $q$ would have incentive to deviate locally from $s^{*}$ . Next we analyze the possibility of non-local deviations from $s^{*}$ by firm $q$  \n\n### Part II. Proof of Proposition 2: Large Deviations  \n\n\\*Consider frst a deviation to $s_{q}<s^{*}$  \n\nReminder: let $s_{-}\\in(0,s^{*}]$ be the unique solution to $L_{-}(s_{-})=L^{T}(s^{*})$ , where $L_{-}(.)$ is defined in Eq. (A.13). If $\\beta>0$ then $s_{-}<s^{*}$ , and  \n\n- if sq ≤s-, then q invests iff L≥ L-(s) = 1-a-8+sa\\* -if $s_{q}>s_{-}$ , then $q$ invests iff $L\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})$  \n\nMonopolist $q$ chooses $s_{q}$ to maximize profits  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle\\pi(s_{q})=\\int_{L^{T}(s^{*})}^{\\overline{{L}}}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q})\\frac{L-F(s^{*})}{\\alpha-s^{*}}-F(s_{q})~d L}\\ {\\displaystyle\\qquad+\\int_{\\operatorname*{min}\\{L_{-}(s_{q}),L^{T}(s^{*})\\}}^{L^{T}(s^{*})}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q})L-F(s_{q})~d L.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe first derivative with respect to $s_{q}$ is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\pi(s_{q})}{\\partial s_{q}}=\\int_{L^{T}(s^{*})}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\frac{L-F(s^{*})}{\\alpha-s^{*}}-F^{\\prime}(s_{q})d L+\\int_{\\operatorname*{min}\\{L-(s_{q}),L^{T}(s^{*})\\}}^{L^{T}(s^{*})}L-F^{\\prime}(s_{q})d L.\n$$  \n\nTwo observations:  \n\n1. If $s_{q}\\in[s_{-},s^{*})$ ， $\\pi^{\\prime}(s_{q})$ simplifies to  \n\n$$\n\\int_{L^{T}(s^{*})}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\frac{L-F(s^{*})}{\\alpha-s^{*}}-F^{\\prime}(s_{q})d L>0\n$$  \n\nsince $F^{\\prime\\prime}>0$ . Therefore, monopolist $q$ does not deviate an $s_{q}\\in[s_{-},s^{*})$  \n\n2. $\\pi^{\\prime}(.)$ is continuous (though not differentiable at $s_{-}$ ), which implies that when $s_{q}\\to s_{-}$ from below, $\\pi^{\\prime}(s_{q})>0$  \n\nSuppose now $s_{q}<s_{-}$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})=-\\displaystyle\\int_{L_{-}(s_{q})}^{\\overline{{L}}}F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})~d L-\\left[L_{-}(s_{q})-F^{\\prime}(s_{q})\\right]L_{-}^{\\prime}(s_{q})}}\\ {{=\\displaystyle-[\\overline{{L}}-L_{-}(s_{q})]F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})+\\displaystyle\\frac{[F^{\\prime}(s_{q})-L_{-}(s_{q})]^{2}}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}},}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere we are using (and will use repeatedly) that  \n\n$$\nL_{-}^{\\prime}(s_{q})=\\frac{(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q})F^{\\prime}(s_{q})-F(s_{q})}{(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q})^{2}}=\\frac{F^{\\prime}(s_{q})-L_{-}(s_{q})}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}}.\n$$  \n\nNext, we calculate the sign of the second derivative $\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}(s)$ in Eq. (A.25). Since $F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})>0$ ， $\\operatorname{sign}(\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})){=}\\operatorname{sign}(\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})/F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q}))$  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})}{F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})}=-\\overline{{L}}+\\underbrace{L_{-}(s_{q})+\\frac{[F^{\\prime}(s_{q})-L_{-}(s_{q})]^{2}}{(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q})F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})}}_{\\equiv G(s_{q})}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{G^{\\prime}(s_{q})=\\frac{F^{\\prime}(s_{q})-L_{-}(s_{q})}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}}}\\ &{\\qquad+\\frac{2[F^{\\prime}(s_{q})-L_{-}(s_{q})][F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})-L_{-}^{\\prime}(s_{q})](1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q})F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})}{[F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q})]^{2}}}\\ &{\\qquad-\\frac{[F^{\\prime}(s_{q})-L_{-}(s_{q})]^{2}[F^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q})+F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})]}{[F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q})]^{2}}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nSince $F^{\\prime}(s_{q})>L_{-}(s_{q})$ ， $G^{\\prime}(s_{q})$ has the sign of  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{|F^{\\prime}(s_{k})|^{1}:=-\\Delta^{\\prime}+s_{k}|}\\ &{+2|F^{\\prime}(s_{k})|^{2}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta\\right)(1-\\alpha-\\beta)+s_{k}|^{F^{\\prime}}(s_{k})}\\ &{-\\left(F^{\\prime}(s_{k})-L_{-}(s_{k})\\right)|(F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{k})|(1-\\alpha+s_{k})+F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{k})|}\\ &{-|F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{k})|^{2}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta\\right)+s_{k}|^{F^{\\prime\\prime}}(s_{k})-L_{-}(s_{k})|F^{\\prime}(s_{k})|}\\ &{-3|F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{k})|^{2}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{k}\\right)-2|F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{k})-L_{-}(s_{k})|^{F^{\\prime}}(s_{k})}\\ &{-\\left(F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{k})-L_{-}(s_{k})\\right)|(F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{k})|(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{k})+F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{k})|}\\ &{-3|F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{k})|^{2}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{k}\\right)}\\ &{-\\left(F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{k})-L_{-}(s_{k})\\right)|F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{k})\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{k}\\right)+3F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{k})|}\\ &{-\\frac{12\\alpha^{2}}{(\\alpha-s_{k})^{3}}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{k}\\right)-\\frac{6\\alpha^{2}}{(\\alpha-s_{k})^{2}}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{k}\\right)}\\ &{+\\frac{6\\alpha^{2}}{(\\alpha-s_{k})^{3}}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{k}\\right)-\\frac{6\\alpha^{2}}{(\\alpha-s_{k})^{3}}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{k}\\right)}\\ &{+\\frac{6\\alpha^{2}}{(\\alpha-s_{k})^{4}}\\frac{1}{(\\alpha-s_{k})^{3}}-\\frac{6\\alpha^{2}}{(\\alpha-s_{k})^\n$$  \n\nwhich, in turn has the sign of  \n\n$$\ng(s_{q})\\equiv\\alpha(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q})^{2}-(1-\\alpha-\\beta)(\\alpha-s_{q})^{2}\n$$  \n\nThere are two possible cases:  \n\n(I) $2\\alpha+\\beta-1\\le0$  \n\nThen $g(.)$ is concave, $g(\\alpha)>0$ and $g(0)\\geq0$ , therefore, $g(.)>0$ for $s_{q}\\in(0,s_{-})$ . It follows that $\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}$ is increasing for $s_{q}=0$ and is strictly increasing for $s\\in(0,s_{-})$  \n\n(I1) $2\\alpha+\\beta-1>0$ Then $g(.)$ is convex, $g(\\alpha)>0$ and $g(0)<0$ .

Indeed, in (I), $\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{-})<0$ and $\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}$ increasing imply $\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}(.)<0$ on $[0,s_{-})$ . Then since $\\pi^{\\prime}(s_{-})>$ 0, $\\pi^{\\prime}(.)>0$ on $[0,s_{-})$ In (II), $\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{-})<0$ implies either $\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}(.)<0$ on $[0,s_{-})$ (then back to previous case), or $\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}(.)$ is first positive and then negative.

D.  \n\nAssume that for any (common) leverage $s$ , monopolists coordinate on the Pareto-superior equilibrium in the production game, that is, from Eq. (9) monopolists produce at $t=1$ if and only if  \n\n$$\nL\\geq L^{+}(s)\\equiv(1-\\beta)\\frac{F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}.\n$$  \n\nConsider a deviation by monopolist $q$ : monopolist $q$ chooses $s_{q}$ when all other monopolists choose leverage $s$ . Monopolist $q$ produces if and only if  \n\n$$\nL\\geq L^{+}(s_{q},s)\\equiv\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{{\\displaystyle{\\operatorname*{min}\\left\\{\\frac{F(s_{q})}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}},L^{+}(s)\\right\\}}}}&{{\\mathrm{if~}s_{q}<s}}\\ {{\\displaystyle(\\alpha-s)\\frac{F(s_{q})}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}}+F(s)}}&{{\\mathrm{if~}s_{q}\\geq s}}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nThe f.o.c. of $s_{q}$ when all other monopolists choose $s^{*}$ writes:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s_{q}}\\int_{L^{+}(s_{q},s^{*})}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\frac{L-F\\left(s^{*}\\right)}{\\alpha-s^{*}}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q})-F\\left(s_{q}\\right)d L\\bigg|_{s_{q}=s^{*}}=0.\n$$  \n\nSince ${\\cal L}^{+}(s,s)={\\cal L}^{+}(s)$ , and for any $s$ ，  \n\n$$\n\\frac{L^{+}(s)-F\\left(s\\right)}{\\alpha-s}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)-F\\left(s\\right)=0,\n$$  \n\na marginal change in $s_{q}$ around $s^{*}$ only affects the integral in Eq. (A.61) through its inte  \n\ngrand. Therefore, Eq. (A.61) writes:  \n\n$$\n\\int_{L^{+}(s^{*})}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\frac{L-F\\left(s^{*}\\right)}{\\alpha-s^{*}}-F^{\\prime}\\left(s^{*}\\right)d L=0.\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\Leftrightarrow\\left(\\frac{\\overline{{{L}}}+L^{+}(s^{*})}{2}-F(s^{*})\\right)\\frac{1}{\\alpha-s^{*}}-F^{\\prime}(s^{*})=0\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\Leftrightarrow\\overline{{{L}}}=2(\\alpha-s^{*})F^{\\prime}(s^{*})+\\left(2-\\frac{1-\\beta}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s^{*}}\\right)F(s^{*})\n$$  \n\nIf $s^{*}=0$ , the RHS of Eq. (A.65) is equal to 2. If $s^{*}\\to\\alpha$ , the RHS of Eq. (A.65) tends to $+\\infty$ . It follows that if $\\overline{{L}}>2$ , Eq. (A.65) has at least one solution. Rewrite Eq. (A.65) as  \n\n$$\n\\overline{{L}}\\alpha=2\\alpha+s^{\\ast}\\underbrace{\\left(\\overline{{L}}+2-\\frac{1-\\beta}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s^{\\ast}}\\right)}_{\\equiv h(s^{\\ast})}\n$$  \n\nSince $h^{\\prime}(.)>0$ and $\\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow\\alpha}h(s)=\\overline{{L}}+1>0}\\end{array}$ , there exists $\\hat{s}$ (possibly equal to $0$ ） such that $h(s)>0$ iff $s>\\hat{s}$ $\\overline{{L}}>2$ implies that at $s=0$ , the RHS is lower than $2\\alpha$ and therefore, $s\\in[0,\\hat{s})$ cannot be a solution to Eq. (A.66) since for $s\\in[0,\\hat{s})$ , the RHS is also lower than $2\\alpha$ . If $s>\\hat{s}$ ,then $h(s)>0$ and $h^{\\prime}(s)>0$ imply that the RHS of Eq. (A.66) is strictly increasing. Therefore, Eq. (A.66) has a unique solution. Hence, if there exists a symmetric equilibrium, this equilibrium is unique, interior (i.e., $s^{*}\\in(0,\\alpha)$ ) and defined by the f.o.c. in Eq. (A.63).  \n\nAs explained in the main text, maximizing consumers′ expected utility amounts to maximizing their expected income from corporate profits. Therefore, the social planner's problem  \n\nmaximizes  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{max}_{s}\\frac{1}{\\overline{{L}}}\\int_{\\operatorname*{min}\\{L^{+}(s),\\overline{{L}}\\}}^{\\overline{{L}}}y(s,L)(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)-F\\left(s\\right)d L,\n$$  \n\nwhere, as earlier, $\\begin{array}{r}{y(s,L)=\\frac{L-F(s)}{\\alpha-s}}\\end{array}$ . Since at the social optimum $s^{**}$ $L^{+}(s^{**})<\\overline{{L}}$ , and using Eq. (A.62) again, the f.o.c of the problem in Eq. (A.67) writes  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\quad\\frac{1}{\\overline{{L}}}\\int_{L^{+}(s^{**})}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\frac{\\partial y(s^{**},L)}{\\partial s}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s^{**})+y(s^{**},L)-F^{\\prime}(s^{**})d L=0}\\ &{\\Leftrightarrow\\int_{L^{+}(s^{**})}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\frac{-F^{\\prime}\\left(s^{**}\\right)+y(s^{**},L)}{\\left(\\alpha-s^{**}\\right)}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s^{**})+y(s^{**},L)-F^{\\prime}\\left(s^{**}\\right)d L=0}\\ &{\\Leftrightarrow\\int_{L^{+}(s^{**})}^{\\overline{{L}}}y(s^{**},L)-F^{\\prime}\\left(s^{**}\\right)d L=0}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nTherefore, Eq. (A.70) holds at $s^{**}=s^{*}$ (i.e., the equilibrium leverage satisfies the frst-order condition of the social planner). Notice also that (i) as $s\\rightarrow\\alpha$ then $L^{+}(s)\\to+\\infty$ and the objective function in Eq. $(\\mathrm{A.67}){\\rightarrow}0$ ; and (ii) if $\\overline{{L}}>2$ , the first derivative (see Eq. (A.70)) evaluated at $s^{**}=0$ is positive:  \n\n$$\ns i g n\\left\\{\\int_{L^{+}(0)}^{\\overline{{L}}}y(0,L)-F^{\\prime}\\left(0\\right)d L\\right\\}=s i g n\\left\\{\\int_{0}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\frac{L}{\\alpha}-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}d L\\right\\}=s i g n\\left\\{\\frac{\\overline{{L}}}{2}-1\\right\\}>0,\n$$  \n\nthen there is at interior optimum $s^{**}\\in(0,\\alpha)$ , which needs to satisfy f.o.c. in Eq. (A.70). Since Eq. (A.63) and Eq. (A.70) coincide, and since we showed above that there is a unique interior solution, $s^{*}$ , to Eq. (A.63), it follows that $s^{**}=s^{*}$ . In words, if there is a symmetric equilibrium, it is unique and maximizes welfare. $\\it Q.E.D$  \n\n## Proof of Proposition 5  \n\nConsider first the case where the government commits to have the $m$ -mass of monopolists produce for $\\begin{array}{r}{L\\ge\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}}\\end{array}$ @Fs , that is, whenever it is Pareto-optimal for all monopolists to produce. (It would never be optimal to commit to produce below $\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}$ as in such case, the $m$ -mass of monopolists would exert a negative demand externality on the rest of the economy: when $\\begin{array}{r}{L<\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}}\\end{array}$ monopolists would be making a loss with probability one.) Turn to the other $(1-m)$ -mass of monopolist. As in Proposition 1, assume that monopolist $q$ produces if and only if ${\\mathit{l}}_{q}>{\\mathit{l}}^{*}$ . Then for a given $L$ and for $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ small enough, the mass of active monopolists is  \n\n$$\nn(L)\\equiv\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{{1}}&{{\\mathrm{if~}L>l^{*}+\\varepsilon}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{m+(1-m)\\frac{L+\\varepsilon-l^{*}}{2\\varepsilon}}}&{{\\mathrm{if~}L\\in[l^{*}-\\varepsilon,l^{*}+\\varepsilon]}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{0}}&{{\\mathrm{if~}L<l^{*}-\\varepsilon}}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nA monopolist with signal $l^{*}$ must be indifferent between producing and not producing:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2\\varepsilon}\\int_{l^{*}-\\varepsilon}^{l^{*}+\\varepsilon}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)\\frac{L-n(L)F}{1-n(L)(1-\\alpha+s)}-F d L=0.\n$$  \n\nEq. (A.73) implicitly defines a unique $l^{*}(\\varepsilon)$ , which is strictly greater than (1-β)F( for m E $[0,1)$ .(For $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ small enough, $l^{*}(\\varepsilon)-\\varepsilon$ is also strictly greater than (-β)F( ) Note that under the government's proposed strategy (i.e., to coordinate production among the $m$ -mass of $\\begin{array}{r}{L\\ge\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s})}\\end{array}$ $L$ close enough to $\\textstyle{\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}}$ from above:in the aseaneof positivedemand exteralitis from the $(1-m)$ -mass of monopolists, production by the $m$ -mass of monopolists for $L$ close to $\\textstyle{\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}}$ carries a loss. To mitigate this problem, suppose that instead of producing for $\\begin{array}{r}{L\\ge\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}}\\end{array}$ government commits to produce for $L\\geq l^{\\ast}(\\varepsilon)-\\varepsilon$ where $l^{*}(\\varepsilon)$ is still defined by Eq. (A.73). Note that investing if and only if ${\\mathit{l}}_{q}>{\\mathit{l}}^{*}(\\varepsilon)$ still is the unique equilibrium of the production game among the $(1-m)$ -mass of monopolists. Next we characterized $l^{*}(\\varepsilon)$ as $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow0$ . Start from Eq. (A.73) and consider the following change of variable: :L+e-\\*  L = 2ez+l\\*-. Eq. (A.73) becomes  \n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)\\frac{2\\varepsilon z+l^{*}-\\varepsilon-(m+(1-m)z)F}{1-(m+(1-m)z)(1-\\alpha+s)}-F~d z=0.\n$$  \n\nTaking the limit when $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow0$ and defining $L^{T}$ as the limit of $l^{*}$ when $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow0$ ,Eq.

Q.E.D.  \n\n## Proof of Corollary 1  \n\nRecall that the production threshold $L^{T}(s,m)$ of the $(1-m)$ -mass of monopolists is derived in the proof of Proposition 5 from the limit when $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow0$ of the indifference condition in Eq. (A.73). That indifference condition states that the marginal independent monopolist should be indifferent between producing and not producing given the strategy of the other independent monopolists (mass $1-m$ ) and assuming that all government-controlled monopolist (mass $m$ ) produce. It follows that $L^{T}(s,m)$ is the smallest realization of $L$ above which the $(1-m)$ -mass of monopolists produce for any strategy followed by the $m$ -mass of monopolists.  \n\nConsider next the condition that implicitly defines $L^{T}(s,m)$ in Eq. (A.79):  \n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)\\frac{L^{T}(s,m)-(m+(1-m)z)F}{1-(m+(1-m)z)(1-\\alpha+s)}-F~d z=0\n$$  \n\nThe function 1-s(1-α+s) is strictly increasing in c for L > 1-a+s and $\\begin{array}{r}{L^{T}(s,m)>\\frac{F}{1-\\alpha+s}}\\end{array}$ Therefore, Eq. (A.84) implies  \n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s){\\frac{L^{T}(s,m)-m F}{1-m(1-\\alpha+s)}}-F d z=(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s){\\frac{L^{T}(s,m)-m F}{1-m(1-\\alpha+s)}}-F<0\n$$  \n\nThat is, at $L^{T}(s,m)$ and a fortiori for $L<L^{T}(s,m)$ ,the $m$ -mass of monopolists make strictly negative profits if they produce and the $(1-m)$ -mass of independent monopolists do not. Therefore, the optimal government strategy for $L<L^{T}(s,m)$ is for the $m$ -mass of monopolists not to produce. It follows that all monopolists producing if and only if $L\\geq L^{T}(s,m)$ is the highest output the government can induce for any production strategy of the $m$ -mass of monopolists it controls. Q.E.D.  \n\n## Proof of Proposition 6  \n\nThe proof of Proposition 6 follows the same line as the proof of Proposition 2 of the baseline model. We just show here the comparative statics with respect to $m$ . Eq. (A.19) in the proof of Proposition 2 is equivalent to  \n\n$$\n\\alpha\\overline{{L}}=2\\alpha+s^{\\ast}\\underbrace{\\Bigg(2+\\overline{{L}}-\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha+s^{\\ast}}-\\frac{(1-m)\\beta}{(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s^{\\ast})\\ln{\\left(\\frac{1-m(1-\\alpha+s^{\\ast})}{\\alpha-s^{\\ast}}\\right)}}}_{\\equiv f(s^{\\ast},m)}\\Bigg)}_{\\qquad\\equiv f(s^{\\ast},m)}\n$$  \n\nAs in the baseline model, if $\\overline{{L}}>2$ , Eq. (A.86)) has a unique solution. Furthermore, $f(s^{*},m)>0$ $f_{1}(s,m)>0$ and $f_{2}(s,m)>0$ .Total differentiation of Eq. (A.86) with  \n\nrespect to $m$ yields  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial s^{*}(m)}{\\partial m}f(s^{*},m)+s^{*}\\left[f_{1}(s^{*},m)\\frac{\\partial s^{*}(m)}{\\partial m}+f_{2}(s^{*},m)\\right]=0\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\Leftrightarrow\\frac{\\partial s^{*}(m)}{\\partial m}=-\\frac{f_{2}(s^{*},m)}{f(s^{*},m)+s^{*}f_{1}(s^{*},m)}<0.\n$$  \n\nQ.E.D.  \n\n## Proof of Proposition 7  \n\nThe first derivative of the $W(s,m)$ in Eq.

(A.91), monitoring does not affect agregate income $y$ for a given set of active monopolists $\\mathcal{A}$ : monitoring reduces the profit of each active monopolist by $\\beta^{\\prime}y$ but increases labor income by the same amount. Hence, the expression for $y$ obtained from Eq. (A.91) is as in Eq.

(3), Eq. (8), Eq. (9), and Eq. (10) are identical to Eq. (A.90), Eq. (A.93), Eq. (A.94), and Eq. (A.95) except that the first four equations depend on parameter $\\beta$ and the last four depend on parameter $\\beta^{\\prime}$ . Therefore, an equivalent to Proposition 1 still holds, that is, if monopolists choose $s$ , they operate at $t=1$ if $L\\ge L_{\\beta^{\\prime}}^{T}(s)$ where  \n\n$$\nL_{\\beta^{\\prime}}^{T}(s)\\equiv\\frac{F(s)}{1-\\alpha+s}+\\frac{\\beta^{\\prime}F(s)}{(1-\\alpha-\\beta^{\\prime}+s)\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha-s}\\right)}.\n$$  \n\nTherefore, aggregate income is then given by  \n\n$$\ny_{\\beta^{\\prime}}(s,L)\\equiv\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{\\frac{L-F(s)}{\\alpha-s}}&{\\mathrm{if~}L\\geq L_{\\beta^{\\prime}}^{T}(s)}\\ {L}&{\\mathrm{if~}L<L_{\\beta^{\\prime}}^{T}(s)}\\end{array}\\right..\n$$  \n\nSuppose monopolist $q$ chooses operating leverage $s_{q}$ while all other monopolists choose $s$ Monopolist $q$ produces when it makes a profit, that is, when  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta^{\\prime}+s_{q}\\right)y_{\\beta^{\\prime}}(s,L)-F(s_{q})\\geq0,}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nor equivalently, when  \n\n$$\nL\\ge\\hat{L}_{\\beta^{\\prime}}(s_{q},s)\\equiv\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{{\\displaystyle{\\operatorname*{max}\\left\\{(\\alpha-s)\\frac{F(s_{q})}{1-\\alpha-\\beta^{\\prime}+s_{q}}+F(s),L_{\\beta^{\\prime}}^{T}(s)\\right\\}}}}&{{\\mathrm{if~}s_{q}\\ge s,\\displaystyle{\\medskip}}}\\ {{\\displaystyle{\\operatorname*{min}\\left\\{\\frac{F(s_{q})}{1-\\alpha-\\beta^{\\prime}+s_{q}},L_{\\beta^{\\prime}}^{T}(s)\\right\\}}}}&{{\\mathrm{if~}s_{q}<s.}}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nThen $s_{\\beta^{\\prime}}^{*}$ is an equilibrium if and only if  \n\n$$\ns_{\\beta^{\\prime}}^{*}\\in\\underset{s_{q}}{\\mathrm{argmax}}\\int_{\\operatorname*{min}\\{\\hat{L}_{\\beta^{\\prime}}(s_{q},s_{\\beta^{\\prime}}^{*}),\\overline{{L}}\\}}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}\\right)y_{\\beta^{\\prime}}(s_{\\beta^{\\prime}}^{*},L)-F(s_{q})d L.\n$$  \n\nNotice that Eq.

(A.102) is different from the problem in Eq. (19). In Eq. (19), the extra labor income $\\beta y$ earned by supervisors in states in which monopolists are active merely compensates them for their effort cost and therefore, labor income net of monitoring disutility always sums up to $L$ . Consequently, in Eq. (19) maximizing consumers’ expected utility amounts to maximizing their expected income from corporate profits. However, in Eq. (A.102) the extra labor income $\\beta^{\\prime}y$ earned by supervisors in states in which monopolists are active more than compensates them for their efort cost $\\beta y$ .Consequently, in Eq. (A.102) maximizing consumers′ expected utility amounts to maximizing the sum of the expected income from corporate profits plus the expected supervisors’ rent.

If $s_{q}=s^{*}$ then, at $L=L^{T}(s^{*})$ monopolist $q$ makes a strictly positive profit if all other monopolist operate and makes a strictly negative profit if no other monopolist operates. This implies that we can define an interval $[s^{*}-\\tau,s^{*}+\\tau]$ for some $\\tau>0$ such that if $s_{q}\\in[s^{*}-\\tau,s^{*}+\\tau]$ monopolist $q$ produces if and only if $L\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})$ .

Q.E.D.  \n\n## Online appendix: Production at t=0 and at t=1  \n\nIn the main model, monopolists choose their operating leverage at $t=0$ , before uncertainty about $L$ is realized at $t=1$ . This captures the idea that firms’ technological and organizational choices are long lasting and therefore, that frms cannot respond to a productivity shock by swiftly changing their production technologies. In this section, we extend the model to show that our results remain unchanged when monopolists also produce at $t=0$ and can condition their choice of operating leverage to the current ( $t=0$ ) productivity level, provided that they cannot rapidly adjust their operating leverage to accommodate realizations of future ( $t=1$ ) productivity shocks. Formally, this requires the following changes to the main model. We assume that production also takes place $t=0$ . That is, a productivity shock $L_{0}$ is realized at $t=0$ .Then, knowing $L_{0}$ , each monopolists makes an operating leverage decision, a production decision and the game moves on to $t=1$ .At $t=1$ , a new shock $L_{1}$ is realized and monopolists make a second production decision. Importantly, a monopolist cannot adjust its operating leverage between the two production decisions at $t=0$ and $t=1$ . The productivity shocks $\\left\\{L_{0},L_{1}\\right\\}$ are uniformly distributed over $[0,\\overline{{L}}]$ and independent. Similar to the main model, the consumer's utility is given by  \n\n$$\nU=\\exp\\left[\\int_{0}^{1}\\ln x_{1}(q)d q\\right]+\\theta\\exp\\left[\\int_{0}^{1}\\ln x_{2}(q)d q\\right],\n$$  \n\nwhere $x_{t}(q)$ is the consumption at $t$ defined over a unit interval of goods indexed by $q$ and $\\theta\\in(0,1]$ is a time discount factor. Everything else remains the same as in the main model:  \n\n(i) Each good $q$ is produced by a sector, and each sector consists of two types of firms. A competitive fringe of firms with a constant returns to scale technology in which one unit of output requires one unit of labour, and a monopolist with access to an increasing returns to scale technology; (ii) In each period $t$ , monopolist $q$ incurs a marginal cost of $\\alpha-s_{q}$ and a fixed cost of $F(s_{q})$ to produce, where $F(s_{q})$ is increasing, convex, and tends to infinity as $s_{q}\\to\\alpha$ ; and (i) Production by monopolists requires a monitoring effort $\\beta$ per unit of output.  \n\nThis extension poses a minor technical challenge. In the baseline model, the equilibrium of the production game is pinned down as the limit of a dispersed information game in which monopolists imperfectly observe $L$ after their choices of operating leverage but before their production decisions. (See Section 3.2.) However, the point of the current extension is to let monopolists observe $L_{0}$ before deciding their operating leverages at $t=0$ , which precludes having dispersed information about $L_{0}$ when monopolists make their production decisions at $t=0$ . To circumvent this problem while keeping the global games treatment of the production game identical to the baseline model, we assume that all monopolists perfectly observe $L_{t}$ at the beginning of each period $t$ . However, in each period, the realization of the shock is altered to be $L_{t}+\\mathcal{L}_{t}$ , where $\\mathcal{L}_{t}$ is normally distributed with mean O and variance $\\sigma^{2}$ . Furthermore, in each period, monopolist $q$ also observes a private noisy signal of $\\mathcal{L}_{t}$ ， ${{l}_{q,t}}={{\\mathcal{L}}_{t}}+{{\\xi}_{q,t}}$ , where $\\xi_{q,t}$ is normally distributed with mean O and variance $\\sigma_{\\xi}^{:2}$ . Importantly, at $t~=~0$ ，monopolist $q$ observes $l_{q,0}$ after its operating leverage decision but before its production decision. This design has the appealing property that we can take the limit to  \n\n0 of both $\\sigma_{\\xi}^{:2}$ and $\\sigma^{2}$ in a way that (i) maintains equilibrium uniqueness; (ii) leaves $L_{t}$ as the only shock at time $t$ (since $\\sigma^{2}\\rightarrow0$ ， $\\mathcal{L}_{t}$ is $0$ almost surely); and (ii) has monopolists producing at $t$ if and only $L_{t}\\geq L^{T}(s)$ , where $L^{T}(s)$ is the same threshold as in the baseline model. Fig. OA1 illustrates the timing of events.  \n\n![](images/caec140705bbe1166c179c9401fd8173b1c8c3529f35561955a9a202c80de17b.jpg)  \nFig. OA1. Timing of events.  \n\nProposition OA.1 below formally states the result that the global games treatment that we consider in this section delivers the same prediction for the production game as the prediction of the baseline model. (For the proofs of Propositions OA.1 and OA.2 below, see at the end of this appendix.)  \n\nProposition OA.1. Suppose all monopolists choose operating leverage s at $t=0$ ，thenif $\\sigma\\to0$ and ${\\frac{\\sigma_{\\xi}}{\\sigma^{2}}}\\to0$ , monopolists operate in period t if and only if $L_{t}\\geq L^{T}(s)$ ,where $L^{T}(s)$ is defined as in Eq. (13).  \n\nNext, we build on Proposition OA.1 to analyze the equilibrium operating leverage at $t=0$ Suppose monopolist $q$ chooses $s_{q}$ while all other monopolists choose $s^{*}\\in(0,\\alpha)$ . If $s_{q}=s^{*}$ and $L=L^{T}(s^{*})$ , a monopolist $q$ makes a strictly positive profit at $t=1$ if all other monopolist operate and makes a strictly negative profit if no other monopolist operates. This implies that we can define an interval $[s^{*}-\\tau,s^{*}+\\tau]$ for some $\\tau>0$ such that if $s_{q}\\in[s^{*}-\\tau,s^{*}+\\tau]$ monopolist $q$ produces if and only if $L\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})$ . Then, $s^{*}$ being an equilibrium requires OA.3  \n\nthat  \n\n$$\ns^{*}\\in\\underset{s_{q}\\in[s^{*}-\\tau,s^{*}+\\tau]}{\\arg\\operatorname*{max}}\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}{\\mathbf{1}_{\\{L_{0}\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})\\}}\\left[\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}\\right)y(s^{*},L_{0})-F(s_{q})\\right]+}\\ {+\\theta\\int_{L^{T}(s^{*})}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}\\right)y(s^{*},L_{1})-F(s_{q})d L_{1}}\\end{array}\\right\\},\n$$  \n\nwhere ${\\bf1}_{\\{L_{0}\\ge L^{T}(s^{*})\\}}$ is an indicator function that takes a value of one when $L_{0}\\geq L^{T}\\big(s^{*}\\big)$ From Eq. (OA.2), the local necessary first order condition for an interior solution writes  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathsf{l}_{\\{L_{0}\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})\\}}\\left[y\\left(s^{*},L_{0}\\right)-F^{\\prime}\\left(s^{*}\\right)\\right]+\\theta\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left(L_{1}\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})\\right)\\left[E\\left[y\\big|L_{1}\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})\\right]-F^{\\prime}\\left(s^{*}\\right)\\right]=0.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe next proposition shows that around this local equilibrium condition, there is excessive operating leverage. The logic is identical to the one previously discussed for Proposition 3 and Proposition 10: at the equilibrium leverage $s^{*}$ , a marginal decrease in the leverage of all monopolists lead them to switch from inactivity to production just below $L^{T}(s^{*})$ (i.e., oLr(s) > 0) which improves welfare.  \n\nProposition OA.2. Consider a generic increasing and convec function $F(.)$ any symmetric interior equilibrium $s^{*}$ at $t=1$ satisfies condition in Eq. (0A.3), and a collective marginal decrease in operating leverage below $s^{*}$ increases welfare.  \n\n### Proof of Proposition OA.1  \n\nSuppose all monopolists choose $s$ at $t=0$ and monopolist $q$ with signal $l_{q,t}$ produces if and only if ${\\mathit{l}}_{\\mathit{q},t}>{\\mathit{l}}^{*}$ at time $t$ , for $t=1,2$ . Consider a monopolist who observes the signal $l^{*}$ . Its  \n\nOA.4  \n\nposterior of $\\mathcal{L}_{t}$ is normally distributed with mean $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{\\sigma^{2}+\\sigma_{\\xi}^{2}}l^{*}}\\end{array}$ and variance $\\frac{\\sigma^{2}\\sigma_{\\xi}^{2}}{\\sigma^{2}+\\sigma_{\\xi}^{2}}$ Finally, for a given realization of $\\mathcal{L}_{t}$ , the mass of monopolists that produce at time $t$ is  \n\n$$\nn(\\mathcal{L}_{t})\\equiv1-\\Phi\\left(\\frac{l^{*}-\\mathcal{L}_{t}}{\\sigma_{\\xi}}\\right)\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\Phi(.)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1.

Suppose monopolist $q$ chooses $s_{q}$ while all other monopolists choose $s^{*}\\in(0,\\alpha)$ . If $s_{q}=s^{*}$ and $L=L^{T}(s^{*})$ , monopolist $q$ makes a strictly positive profit at $t=1$ if all other monopolist operate and makes a strictly negative profit if no other monopolist operates. This implies that we can define an interval $[s^{*}-\\tau,s^{*}+\\tau]$ for some $\\tau>0$ such that if $s_{q}\\in[s^{*}-\\tau,s^{*}+\\tau]$ , monopolist $q$ produces if and only if $L\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})$ . Then, $s^{*}$ being an equilibrium requires that  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}&{}&{s^{*}\\in\\underset{s_{q}\\in[s^{*}-\\tau,s^{*}+\\tau]}{\\mathrm{argmax}}\\mathbf{1}_{\\{L_{0}\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})\\}}\\left(\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}\\right)y(s^{*},L_{0})-F(s_{q})\\right)+}\\ &{}&\\ &{}&{\\qquad+\\theta\\int_{L^{T}(s^{*})}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}\\right)y(s^{*},L_{1})-F(s_{q})d L_{1},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere ${\\bf1}_{\\{L_{0}\\ge L^{T}(s^{*})\\}}$ is an indicator function that takes the value of one when $L_{0}\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})$ If $L_{0}\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})$ , the local necessary condition for an interior solution to the monopolist optimization problem in Eq. (0A.27) writes:  \n\n$$\ny\\left(s^{*},L_{0}\\right)-F^{\\prime}\\left(s^{*}\\right)+\\theta\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left(L_{1}\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})\\right)\\left[E\\left[y|L_{1}\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})\\right]-F^{\\prime}\\left(s^{*}\\right)\\right]=0.\n$$  \n\nIf $L_{0}<L^{T}(s^{*})$ , the local necessary condition for an interior solution to the monopolist  \n\noptimization problem in Eq.

(0A.30) would be greater than zero.  \n\n$L_{1}^{T}(s^{*})$ is implicitly given by the indifference condition  \n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s^{*})\\hat{y}(L^{T}(s^{*}),s^{*},z)-F(s^{*})~d z=0\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\hat{y}(L,s,z)\\equiv\\frac{L-z F(s)}{1-z(1-\\alpha+s)}.\n$$  \n\na(LT(s),s\\*,)has the sign of (1-α+ s)T(s) F(s) which,from Eq. (13),is strictly positive. It follows that for any $z\\in(0,1)$  \n\n$$\n\\hat{y}(L^{T}(s^{*}),s^{*},z)<\\hat{y}(L^{T}(s^{*}),s^{*},1)=y(L^{T}(s^{*}),s^{*})<F^{\\prime}(s^{*})\n$$  \n\nwhere the last inequality just repeats Eq. (OA.31)  \n\nNext, for any $z\\in(0,1)$ $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{\\partial\\hat{y}(L,s,z)}{\\partial s}(L^{T}(s^{*}),s^{*},.)}\\end{array}$ has the sign of $y(L^{T}(s^{*}),s^{*},z)-F^{\\prime}(s^{*})$ which, from Eq. (0A.34), is strictly negative.  \n\nFinally, total differentiation of the indifference condition in Eq. (OA.32) with respect to $s^{*}$ yields  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\int_{0}^{1}\\hat{y}(L^{T}(s^{*}),s^{*},z)-F^{\\prime}(s^{*})~d z}\\ &{+\\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{1}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s^{*})\\frac{\\partial\\hat{y}(L,s,z)}{\\partial s}(L^{T}(s^{*}),s^{*},.)~d z}\\ &{+\\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{1}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s^{*})\\frac{\\partial\\hat{y}(L,s,z)}{\\partial L}(L^{T}(s^{*}),s^{*},.)\\frac{\\partial L^{T}(s^{*})}{\\partial s^{*}}~d z=0.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nEq. (OA.34) implies that the frst line of this equation is strictly negative. We have shown (LT(s),,)<forany(O 1) whichmlies that thescod line salsonegative.

The social welfare function is not continuos at ${\\cal L}_{0}={\\cal L}^{T}(s^{*})$ as an increase in $s$ beyond $s^{*}$ leads monopolists not to produce at $t=0$ . Consider first the case in which ${\\cal L}_{0}\\rightarrow{\\cal L}^{T}(s)^{+}$ .Using Eq. (0A.28), Eq. (0A.41） evaluated at $s^{*}$ writes as in Eq (0A.44):  \n\n$$\n-\\theta\\left[(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s^{*})\\frac{L^{T}(s^{*})-F(s^{*})}{\\alpha-s^{*}}-F(s^{*})\\right]\\frac{\\partial L^{T}(s^{*})}{\\partial s}\n$$  \n\nSince at the operating threshold (i.e., at $L=L^{T}(s)$ ) frms make a strictly positive profit,  \n\n$$\n(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)\\frac{L^{T}(s)-F(s)}{\\alpha-s}-F(s)>0\n$$  \n\nfor any $s$ , and using Lemma OA.1 (i.e. LT(s > O), it follows the frst derivative for $L_{0}=L^{T}(s^{*})$ when $L^{T}(s)\\to L^{T}(s^{*})^{+}$ (that is, when $s\\to s^{*-}$ since e oLT(s) > O) is negative, that is, a marginal decrease in $s$ around $s^{*}$ from below increases welfare. Consider now the case in which ${\\cal L}_{0}\\rightarrow{\\cal L}^{T}(s)^{-}$ (that is, in which $s\\to s^{*+}$ ).Since $L^{T}(s^{*})$ is increasing in $s^{*}$ (Lemma OA.1) and since monopolists make strictly positive profits at the threshold, $L=L^{T}(s^{*})$ , it follows there is a discrete increase in the welfare function at $s^{*}$ when $s$ approaches $s^{*}$ from above and monopolists start producing at $t=0$ , that is,  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow s^{*+}}W(s,L^{T}(s))<W(s^{*},L^{T}(s^{*})).\n$$  \n\nTherefore, an increase in operating leverage beyond $s^{*}$ decreases  welfare in an interval $(s^{*},s^{*}+\\delta)$ for some $\\delta>0$ . In summary, at $L_{0}=L^{T}(s^{*})$ , a decrease in $s^{*}$ increases welfare and an increase in $s^{*}$ decreases welfare. Q.E.D.  "

Introduction  \n\nOne of the most significant stylized facts in the U.S. economy since the 197Os has been the decline in the share of national income accruing to labor. In this paper, we explore the causes of the decline in the labor share in the United States. Building on a theme that consistently appears in the literature, we argue that the reduction in workers? bargaining power has caused the labor share to fall. We empirically measure and analyze the effect of the reduction in workers? bargaining power using multiple measures of the cost of job loss—the one-year income loss due to unemploymentfor the 1960-2016 sample, which is determined data availability. Our baseline cost of job loss measure can be seen in Figure 1, along with an index of the labor share.  \n\n![](images/d3d72f9e6ba743ab138c74c3708cbd093ea151d66d7238b2f0180a1071571897.jpg)  \nFigure 1: Wage Share and Real Weekly Cost of Job Loss, 1960-2016  \n\nChanges in the cost of job loss over time can be linked to other hypotheses advanced in the literature: structural and institutional changes in the U.S. economy, such as deunionization and deindustrialization; globalization; financialization; increased corporate market power; and technological change and automation. The importance of bargaining power as a channel through which structural changes in economic and institutional relationships can impact the labor share has previously been recognized by Cardenas and Fernandez (2020) and Stansbury and Summers (2020). Most other studies in this literature, discussed in Section 2, show how individual structural changes have directly or indirectly negatively affected the labor share.  \n\nThe novelty of our approach is twofold. First, we treat structural change as a single process, as opposed to focusing on individual components of this process mentioned above. We view this as a more appropriate approach, both theoretically and empirically, because many of these individual components are closely related in terms of causality and timing, and therefore difficult to differentiate. Second, we use the cost of job loss as proxy for bargaining power. We view this as a more comprehensive measure than alternative variables. To our knowledge, it has not previously been used in analyses of labor share dynamics.  \n\nAlthough the importance of labor bargaining power is intuitive and even explicit in many previous studies of the labor share, we view this as a valuable contribution to the literature. In addition to highlighting the commonality in this expansive literature, focusing on the labor bargaining power channel through which many other factors affect the labor share provides a straightforward theoretical explanation that can likely apply to many different contexts beyond the experience of the U.S. over the past few decades. Admittedly, emphasizing one empirical determinant of the labor share leaves out some of the nuance in the broader literature, wherein various factors that affect the labor share through labor bargaining power are explored in more depth. However, a more parsimonious empirical explanation can be valuable in some contexts, such as multi-equation models examining several interrelationships, wherein degrees of freedom can be limited and including many different explanatory factors for the labor share may not be posible.  \n\nOur empirical results suggest that structural changes in the U.S. economy have contributed to a falling labor share and rising functional inequality through a bargaining power channel. We first examine the relationship between the labor share and the cost of job loss. Using a bounds-testing approach, we find a significant negative relationship between the cost of job loss and the labor share in both the short run and long run. Although the significance of the short-run effects is sensitive to the inclusion of control variables representing the aggressiveness of fiscal and monetary policy, the long-run relationship is robust to a number of different specifications.  \n\nGiven that we find the cost of job loss to be a strong determinant of the labor share, we next examine what drives the behavior of the cost of job loss. In particular, we examine how it is impacted by both the business cycle and long-term structural changes in the economy. To explore the latter, we create a structural index combining proxies for deindustrialization, globalization, financialization, increased corporate power, and technological change. We find that the cost of job loss varies countercyclically and that the business cycle fluctuations in bargaining power are greater in magnitude as the result of these structural and institutional changes. Moreover, we find that higher levels of structural change have increased the cost of job loss overall. Together, these results suggest that structural changes in the U.S. economy and weaker economic performance have reduced the labor share by lowering worker's bargaining power.  \n\n### 2. Literature Review  \n\nThe literature examining the behavior of the labor share can be divided into two groups: studies identifying factors contributing to the long-term decline in labor's share of national income and studies estimating the relationship between the labor share and economic activity, usually over the course of the business cycle. The former typically highlights explanatory factors that fall into five (non-mutually exclusive) broad sub-categories: structural and institutional changes in labor markets, such as deunionization, deindustrialization, and wage-suppressing policy; globalization; financialization; increased corporate power with monopoly and monopsony market structures; and technological change and automation. Studies in the latter group generally show that the labor share increases with economic activity.  \n\nWe attempt to synthesize the many wide-ranging elements of this discussion by highlighting the central commonality in all of the determinants of the labor share that have been identified in the literature: they all operate through a channel related to labor bargaining power. The business cycle affects the labor share because labor bargaining power is procyclical, and the factors identified as causes of the long-term decline in the labor share have all, in various ways, lowered labor's bargaining power. Our hypothesis and results are novel because we show that these varied explanatory factors can be comprehensively and parsimoniously captured by movements in the cost of job loss and use this finding to argue that it has caused the decline in the labor share.  \n\nStructural and institutional changes in the U.S. economy, particularly in labor markets, have worked to decrease labor's bargaining power and their share of national income. Stansbury and Summers (2020) find that the decline in unionization rates in the U.S. economy reduced workers bargaining power, explaining the decrease in labor's share of income. Using aggregate-, industry-, individual-, and state-level data, they show how declining worker bargaining power since the 1980s shifted rents from labor to capital, resulting in decreases in the labor share and increases in the profit share, in addition to a lower NARIU, which is caused by the employment-incentivizing effects of lower wages. They state:  \n\nThe decline in unionization rates and union bargaining power was driven by a combination of institutional factors, which weakened labor law and its enforcement, and economic factors, which increased the elasticity of demand for labor and so weakened workers? ability to bargain for higher wages. Institutional factors included the breakdown of pattern bargaining in the 1980s, the expansion of the number of right-to-work states, and decreasing political support for and enforcement of labor laws. Economic factors that reduced worker bargaining power included increased import competition for manufactured goods and deregulation of transportation and telecoms, both of which reduced firms’ abilities to compete while paying high wages. (p. 10)  \n\nBased on their argument, the causes of decreased worker bargaining power stem from three sources: institutional change, specifically declining union membership and strike activity; outsourcing or offshoring firm activities to increase profits; and technological change, automation, and low-wage foreign competition resulting from increased globalization. They argue that institutional changes are the main cause of lower worker bargaining power and thus labor's share of income. “Overall, we conclude that the decline in worker power is one of the most important structural changes to have taken place in the U.S. economy in recent decades. Our emphasis on the decline of worker power is justified both by the strength of the direct evidence, and by its ability to provide a unified explanation for a variety of macroeconomic phenomena,” including changes in the labor share (p. 7). Additionally, their results “suggest that a large share of the decline in labor rents was a result of a redistribution of rents from labor to capital, rather than a destruction of rents as a result of increased competition or market pressure” (p. 24).  \n\nInstitutional changes since the 1970s, such as reduced collective bargaining agreements and fewer labor law protections, which weakened labor's bargaining power, are documented in Levy and Temin (2007) and Bivens, Mishel, and Schmitt (2018). Similarly, Mishel and Bivens (2021) highlight key changes in labor markets in recent decades—-actively sought by capital and enabled by policymakers—-that have dramatically limited labor bargaining power and suppressed wages. These changes include macroeconomic austerity policies that generate excessive unemployment, corporatedriven globalization policies, judicial decisions undermining collective bargaining, weaker labor standards, new contract provisions, and changing corporate structures; and these changes they find to be more important in affecting the labor share than other forces, such as automation. Ramskogler (2021), Brancaccio, Garbellini, and Giammetti (2018), and Ciminelli et al. (2018) argue that the rise of temporary employment contracts, labor market deregulation, and weakened employment protections more generally decrease workers? bargaining power, lowering wage growth and reducing the labor share. Blanchard and Giavazzi (2003) similarly argue that labor market deregulation decreased real wages, but also equilibrium unemployment. The importance of institutional arrangements like collective bargaining agreements is also emphasized by Cardenas and Fernandez (2020). They argue that changes in factors such as collective bargaining arrangements, market structure, and labor movement mobilization during the Francoist developmentalism period in Spain raised the labor share by increasing labor bargaining power. Although they do not test this empirically, focusing instead on the effects of the distributional change, their argument centers on the same mechanisms that we do. Whereas they contend that structural changes in Spain raised the labor share through a bargaining power channel, we argue that a different set of structural changes has caused the opposite to happen in the U.S. Elsby, Hobijn, and Sahin (2013), however, find that changes in bargaining power, measured by the decline in unionization rates across industries, explains only a small fraction of the decrease in the labor share.  \n\nAnother important structural change in labor markets has been deindustrialization and increasing service sector employment. Beqiraj, Fanti, and Zamparelli (2019) find that the rise of the service sector can help explain the falling labor share in multiple countries. Using U.S. state-level data, Mendieta-Munoz et al. (2020b) also find support for the deindustrialization hypothesis as real wages become decoupled from productivity and where decreases in the labor share were first seen in goods-producing states, subsequently spreading to all states.  \n\nIncreases in international trade activity and globalization have had a negative effect of the labor share. Elsby, Hobijn, and \\$ahin (2013) show that the “decline of the labor share over the last 25 years is largely driven by U.S. producers facing increased import competition” (p. 32). The “import exposure” (p. 27) of industries, where the labor-intensive parts of the production process are offshored to lower-wage foreign countries, lead to lower wages for U.S. workers, decreasing the labor share. Oyvat, Oztunah, and Elgin (2019) argue that an increased international trade lowers the probability of a country experiencing wage-led growth, leading to a decrease in the labor share. Jayadev (2007) and Furceri and Loungani (2018) examine capital account liberalization using a crosscountry data set and find a negative effect of the labor share. The rise of import competition from Chinese firms from 1990-2007 served to reduce wages and manufacturing employment in affected sectors (Autor, Dorn, Hansen 2013).  \n\nFinancialization has also reduced both labor bargaining power and the labor share. Kohler, Guschanski, and Stockhammer (2019) summarize the related literature and identify four different channels through which financialization can affect the labor share, all of which are related to power relationships among classes. These included greater exit options for firms, due to increased capital mobility and the ability for firms to earn profits without hiring workers, higher markups due to financial payments, increased focus on shareholder value and short-term profitability, and rising household debt. Empirically, they find that financial iberalization and financial payments by nonfinancial corporations have a negative effect on the wage share. Similarly, Pariboni and Tridico (2019) find that financialization has largely been a “redistributive process\" (p. 1081) between capital and labor, based on data for 28 OECD countries since 1973, and Stockhammer (2017) finds that financialization, in addition to globalization and the decline of the welfare state, are significant factors in explaining the decline in labor shares in a panel of both developing and developed economies. Ignacio (2015) argues, for the French economy, that increased non-financial firm reliance on profits from the financial sector has lowered labor's bargaining power, which decreases the labor share. Using industry-level data for the U.S. economy, Wood (2017) finds a similar result, and estimates that financialization can account for approximately half of the decrease in the labor share. Dunhaupt (2016) finds that increased dividend payments, which are a result of financialization, depressed the labor share for a panel 13 countries. Financialization is also likely to reduce bargaining power by accelerating deindustrialization and reducing growth of aggregate demand, as Tori and Onaran (2017) show that financialization has had a negative effect on physical investment.  \n\nBeginning in the 1980s, corporate power has increased, giving firms more monopoly power in product markets and monopsony power in factor markets. De Loecker, Eeckhout, and Unger (2020) find increasing average markups for large U.S. firms leading to a decrease in the labor share. Autor et al. (2017, 2020) argue that increasing market concentration and the rise of superstar firms drive downward movement in the labor share. Firms that experienced rising market share also had the largest profit share, leading to a decrease in the labor share. Azar, Marinescu, and Steinbaum (2019) estimate that monopsonistic power in labor markets for firms reduces interquartile wages by an average of 17 percent. Although not directly related to firm power, Elsby, Hobijn, and Sahin  \n\n(2013) find that the variation in the labor share across industries is larger than the variation in aggregate measures. Falling labor shares in manufacturing, for example, can be offset by increasing labor shares in finance, technology, and health care. Furthermore, since the labor share includes incomes for both payroll and self-employment, where self-employment income is imputed from payroll income, they find that overestimating the decrease in self-employment income artificially decreased the labor share.  \n\nAutomation and technological change have also worked to decrease labor's share of income (Ray and Mookherjee 2020). Rising levels of automation decrease both the labor share and labor demand, despite increasing productivity (Acemoglu and Restrepo 2019). Ohanian, Orak, and Shen (2021) find that labor share dynamics can be explained by the substitutability between unskilled labor and capital and the complementarity between skilled labor and capital. In a cross-country analysis, Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) find that the fall in relative prices of investment capital, which induce substitution of capital for labor, decreases the labor share. But Elsby, Hobijn, and Sahin (2013) find that the decrease in the cost of investment capital has not had a significant effect On the decline in the labor share.  \n\nThere is thus general consensus in the existing literature on the long-term determinants of the labor share that the primary cause underlying the decline in the labor share is the erosion labor bargaining power, due to a number of different factors, although there is disagreement about which are most important. A related and occasionally overlapping strand of the literature examines the relationship between the labor share and economic activity, typically over the course of the business cycle. Although the effect of the labor share on aggregate demand remains a matter of some debate, results throughout the literature generally suggest the presence of “profit-squeeze” effects, wherein the labor share varies procyclically with aggregate demand. (Blecker 2016; Cauvel 2019; BarralesRuiz et al. 2020). These effects are likely attributable to changes in labor bargaining power over the course of the business cycle, through channels such as the reserve army of the unemployed (Barrales-Ruiz et al. 2020). Stirati and Paternesi Meloni (2021) demonstrate the importance of this reserve army effect empirically, as their analysis for a number of different countries shows that labor market slack has a negative effect on the labor share.  \n\nSome studies in this strand of the literature examine both the short-run relationship between demand and the labor share, as well as changes in this relationship over the long-run. These studies typically identify structural economic changes related to labor bargaining power, such as those discussed above, as explanations for changes in the relationship over the long run. For example, Rada and Kiefer (2015) argue that public policy related to globalization has created a “race to the bottom,’' as international competition drives down wages and reduces the equilibrium labor share. This effect is amplified by deunionization, the falling price of investment goods, and contractionary monetary policy. Mendieta-Munoz et al. (2020a) examine how demand, wages, and productivity shocks affect the evolution of the labor share. From 1948-1984, positive productivity, demand, and wage shocks led to the increase in labor's share of national income. But from 1985-2018, negative wage shocks caused by structural and institutional changes in U.S. labor markets were the main driver of the fall in the labor share.  \n\nDespite the considerable breadth of the existing literature, which has examined numerous explanatory factors and relationships in both the short and long run, it seems that the behavior of the labor share can be explained quite succinctly: it is driven by changes in labor bargaining power. Cyclical fluctuations in the labor share are driven by profit-squeeze effects that occur because bargaining power varies with demand for labor over the course of the business cycle, while the longrun decline of the labor share in the U.S. is the result of an erosion of labor bargaining power due to various structural changes in labor markets and the macroeconomy. We argue in the subsequent section that a single measure of labor bargaining power—-the cost of job loss, the one-year income loss resulting from unemployment—-can broadly capture these macroeconomic effects, providing a simple method for empirically capturing much of the variation in the labor share. The cost of job loss is a more comprehensive proxy for labor's bargaining power than other measures such as union power. To our knowledge, this proxy has not been used in the context of explaining the behavior in the labor share. In a two-step process, we show empirically that the cost of job loss and the labor share are negatively related, and that the cost of job loss captures both cyclical changes in bargaining power and the effects of long-run structural changes occurring in the U.S. economy.  \n\n### 3. Data and Measurement  \n\nThe cost of job loss is a comprehensive proxy for labor's bargaining power because it includes preand post-displacement income, labor market dynamics that include dimensions beyond the unemployment rate, and the generosity of income-support programs. It is defined as the total income loss for the one-year period following job loss, expressed as weekly amount. The cost of job loss can be thought of as the “employment rent,”' or the value of a job to a worker (Schor and Bowles1987).  \n\nFollowing job loss, a worker loses their pre-displacement income, part of which is replaced by income-support programs, such and unemployment insurance benefits for the fraction of the year they are unemployed. This is defined as a worker's unemployment income. Once rehired, the worker will earn a percentage of their pre-displacement income for the remaining portion of the year. This is defined as reemployment income.  \n\nThe cost of job loss, in constant 2018 CPI-U dollars, is estimated by subtracting the sum of a worker's weekly unemployment and reemployment income, adjusted for the expected length of unemployment and reemployment, from a worker's weekly pre-displacement income. 1 With a higher cost of job loss, there is a greater value to the employee of keeping their job, which reduces their bargaining power and ability to demand wage increases because of a lower fallback position.  \n\nMathematically, the cost of job loss is defined as:  \n\n$$\nc j l=w-[(U D)w_{u}+(1-U D)w_{r}],\n$$  \n\nwhere w is pre-displacement income; $U D$ is the average duration of unemployment in weeks, expressed as a percentage of one year; $w_{u}$ is the total sum of unemployment income; $(1-U D)$ is the average duration of reemployment in weeks, expressed as a percentage of one year; and $w_{r}$ is reemployment income, or the income a worker can expect to receive if rehired by another firm (Bowles 1985).2  \n\nThe cost of job loss can be transformed to generate two additional specifications. The normalized cost of job loss expresses the cost of job loss as a percentage of a worker's predisplacement income, which controls for movements in the pre-displacement wage. To account for the probability of experiencing unemployment, the expected cost of job loss is estimated by interacting the real weekly cost of job loss and the unemployment rate. As will be shown in the next section, the five forces that have acted to reduce bargaining power, and thus the labor share, can be more parsimoniously and accurately captured by the costs of job loss, presented in Figure 2.  \n\n![](images/61f082271f07f65edb0ea073fc3d4fef5e1aeef078dbc428b4354b20b57b880e.jpg)  \nFigure 2: Costs of Job Loss, 1960-2016  \n\nTo empirically model structural change, we create a weighted index using proxies for the five forces discussed in Section 2—deindustrialization; globalization; financialization; increased corporate power with monopoly and monopsony market structures; and technological change and automation. Deindustrialization is measured inversely by the manufacturing share of total employment, which is calculated as the ratio of manufacturing employment to total private employment. We proxy for globalization using a measure of trade openness for the U.S. economy, defined as the ratio of real imports and exports to GDP. To capture financialization, we calculate the ratio of stock buybacks and dividends to GDP, using the measures for stock buybacks and dividends described in Gruber and Kamin (2017). This measure likely captures two of the channels through which financialization may affect the labor share: increased exit options for firms and increased focus on short-term shareholder value. Markup effects are considered separately, and although we do not directly include a measure of household debt to account for the fourth channel, it is likely to be correlated with this measure of financialization. Our proxy for corporate market power comes from De Loecker, Eeckhout, and Unger (2020), who estimate of the average markup of price over marginal costs for the U.S.4 Finally, we proxy for technological change using the capital to labor ratio.  \n\nTaking the raw values for each of these five variables, we transform them to an index value, ranging between zero (minimum structural change) and one (maximum structural change) (United Nations 2000 and Setterfield and Lovejoy 2006).5 To generate the weights for each index value, we use a principal component analysis, following Bernstein (2014). The weights from this analysis are applied to the index values and we take the average of the five weighted components to calculate our final weighted index. The resulting structural change index is shown in Figure 3.  \n\n![](images/7be6d9e2165c2db1778a1d156f915b715ea412f64d4c51496fe1559300a3630e.jpg)  \nFigure 3: Structural Change Index, 1960-2016  \n\nOur analysis also incorporates the labor share, measured using the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) index for the business sector, and the growth rate of real GDP. For comparison to results found using measures of the cost of job loss, we make use of an alternative proxy for labor bargaining power—a measure of union activity showing the number of major work stoppages. Finally, to control for the effects of macroeconomic policy, we construct proxies for the aggressiveness of fiscal and monetary policy. Our proxy for the fiscal policy stance builds upon the methodology of Mahedy and Wilson (2018) for separating the cyclical and structural components of the deficit. They estimate the cyclical deficit as the predicted values of a regression of the primary deficit on the output gap. As we are interested in capturing broader attitudes towards fiscal policy, independent of the business cycle, we use the residuals of this regression—-reflecting the structural deficit-as a proxy for the fiscal policy stance. Increases in this series represent greater levels of government spending across the business cycle We employ a similar strategy to proxy for the monetary policy stance, taking the residuals of a regression of the change in the federal funds rate on the output gap. Increases in this variable represent more hawkish monetary policy across the business cycle. However, given that monetary policy is limited by the zero-lower bound, this series should not be interpreted as purely reflecting the attitudes of policymakers, but rather the willingness and ability of policymakers to use expansionary monetary policy. 7  \n\n$$\n\\frac{x_{t}-x_{m i n}}{x_{m a x}-x_{m i n}}\n$$  \n\n### 4. Empirical Analysis  \n\nOur empirical analysis proceeds in two stages. In the first stage, we estimate the relationship between the cost of job loss and the labor share, first with no control variables and then controlling for the fiscal and monetary policy stance variables.8 To do so, we use Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) models and the bounds testing method developed by Pesaran and Shin (1998) and Pesaran, Shin, and Smith (2001), using the helpful guide created by Giles (2015). We selected this approach because we suspected that the cost of job loss and the labor share may be cointegrated, and this method allows us to model the relationship in levels and examine both short-run and long-run dynamics “irrespective of whether the underlying regressors are purely I(O), purely I(1) or mutually cointegrated\" (Pesaran, Shin, and Smith 2001). Unlike other error-correction approaches, this method works even if some variables are I(O) and others are I(1). This is particularly useful because unit root tests of most of our variables, including the labor share and cost of job loss series, are not completely conclusive.? We therefore use this method to test for cointegration and estimate both short-run and long-run relationships between the labor share and the other variables.  \n\nThis process involves three steps. First, we estimate an ARDL model in levels, using an algorithm that selects the optimal lag length for each variable by choosing the model that minimizes the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), subject to the constraint that the lag length cannot exceed four for any variable.10 We then run various diagnostic tests to ensure a valid econometric specification.11 Next, we estimate the conditional error correction equation associated with the  \n\nARDL specification.12 These estimates are used for bounds testing, wherein the null hypothesis is no long-run relationship in levels. If the test statistic exceeds the I(1) critical value the null hypothesis is rejected. If it falls below the I(O) critical value the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, and if it falls somewhere in between the two critical values the results are inconclusive. Coefficients indicating the long-run relationships are calculated based on estimates of the conditional error correction equation.13 In the final step, a basic error-correction model (ECM) is estimated to examine the shortrun dynamics.  \n\nWe estimate four different specifications, one for each of the three measures of the cost of job loss and one that uses union activity as an alternative measure of labor bargaining power. Each specification includes a constant and a trend. The results are presented in the next section.  \n\nIn the next stage of our empirical estimation, we examine how both aggregate demand and the five long-term explanatory forces for the declining labor share, as identified in the literature and measured using the structural change index, affect the cost of job loss.  \n\nTheory would suggest that structural and institutional changes in the U.S. economy, including deunionization and deindustrialization; globalization; financialization; increased corporate market power; and technological change and automation will lower both pre- and post-displacement wages. Decreased collective bargaining agreements and displaced manufacturing workers who likely find employment in lower-paying service sector jobs; competition with lower-paid foreign and domestic workers; depressed investment in the non-financial economy; increased market power for firms; and a more elastic demand for labor because of automation will, holding constant all other variables unaffected by wages, increase the cost of job loss.  \n\nBut, as found by Pacitti (2020, 2011), rising costs of job loss have been caused by both secular and cyclical increases in unemployment duration and, by definition, a decrease in reemployment duration, along with lower re-employment earnings, which can persist for decades.14 The five forces above can be argued to have a similar effect on these variables. Sectoral shifts in economic production, due to deindustrialization, globalization, corporate market power, and automation require the acquisition of costly skills by displaced workers, leading to longer unemployment durations. However, with greater unemployment duration, workers are more willing to accept lower reemployment wages due to the pressures of economic necessity. Together, these forces increase all measures of the cost of job loss, and thus better capture the fall in labor's bargaining power.  \n\nIt is clear from the data in Figure 2 that the cost of job loss is a cyclical variable, but its relationship to the business cycle appears to have changed over time, as it has risen more during recessions in recent decades. We hypothesize that structural changes in the economy-—the five factors identified in Section 2—-have both increased the mean cost of job loss and changed the relationship between bargaining power and the business cycle, leading to larger cyclical fluctuations in the cost of job loss.  \n\nWe test these hypotheses by estimating ARDL models in which the various measures of the cost of job loss serve as the dependent variable and are regressed on their own lags as well as contemporaneous and lagged values of GDP growth, the structural change index, and the fiscal and monetary policy stance variables.15, 16 To test whether structural changes have affected the relationship between the cost of job loss and the business cycle, we also interact the structural change index and GDP growth.17  \n\nThis approach is similar to the one we use for the labor share estimates. However, it differs in two ways. First, we do not model these relationships using the bounds testing approach and error correction methods.18 Second, although we continue to use an algorithm to select the optimal lag length for each variable, subject to the constraint that the lag length cannot exceed four for any variable, here we use the Schwarz Criterion (SC) rather than the AIC, because using the AIC leads to models with large lag lengths that are potentially overfitted.19 We prefer the more parsimonious specifications suggested by the SC because they enable easier modeling and interpretation of the  \n\ninteraction terms.0 The same diagnostic tests used for the labor share estimates are used for these specifications as well.21  \n\n### 5. Results  \n\nTable 1 presents the estimates for the labor share equation, including long-run coefficients, shortrun coefficients, and bounds test results. Eight specifications are reported, two apiece for the three measures of the cost of job loss and two for the alternative bargaining power proxy of union activity. We first estimate the relationship between each of these variables and the labor share with a constant, a trend, and no control variables other than the dummy to account for the structural break. This allows us to test for cointegration between these variables and the labor share. As a sensitivity test, we estimate another specification for each bargaining power variable that controls for the fiscal and monetary policy stance variables.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"9\"></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(1) (2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(#</td><td></td><td>(8)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Levels Equation (Long Run) - Dependent Variable: In Labor Share</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(#</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>In Cost of Job Loss</td><td>-0.108***</td><td>-0.073***</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>In Normalized Cost of Job Loss</td><td>(0.028)</td><td>(0.013)</td><td>-0.112***</td><td>-0.065***</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>In Expected Cost of Job Loss</td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.027)</td><td>(0.012)</td><td>-0.038**</td><td>-0.024***</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>In Union Activity</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.017)</td><td>(0.007)</td><td>0.007</td><td>0.028** (0.011)</td></tr><tr><td>Fiscal Policy Stance</td><td></td><td>0.804***</td><td></td><td>0.922***</td><td></td><td>0.883***</td><td>(0.014)</td><td>1.760***</td></tr><tr><td>Monetary Policy Stance</td><td></td><td>(0.143) -0.005** (0.002)</td><td></td><td>(0.157) -0.005** (0.002)</td><td></td><td>(0.166) -0.004* (0.002)</td><td></td><td>(0.329) -0.013*** (0.004)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"8\">ECM Regression (Short Run) ) - Dependent Variable:  In Labor Share</td></tr><tr><td>Constant</td><td>2.443*** (0.457)</td><td>3.037*** (0.357)</td><td>1.643*** (0.277)</td><td>2.739*** (0.325)</td><td>1.743*** (0.519)</td><td>2.973*** (0.369)</td><td>1.653*** (0.435)</td><td>1.665*** (0.215)</td></tr><tr><td>Trend</td><td>-0.000* (0.000)</td><td>-0.001*** (0.000)</td><td>-0.000** (0.000)</td><td>-0.001*** (0.000)</td><td>-0.000* (0.000)</td><td>-0.001*** (0.000)</td><td>-0.000 (0.000)</td><td>0.000 (0.000)</td></tr><tr><td>Speed of Adjustment</td><td>-0.460*** (0.086)</td><td>-0.590*** (0.069)</td><td>-0.358*** (0.060)</td><td>-0.586***</td><td>-0.360##</td><td>-0.616***</td><td>-0.351**</td><td>-0.366*** (0.047)</td></tr><tr><td>△ ln Labor Share</td><td>0.082</td><td>N/A~</td><td>N/A~</td><td>(0.070) N/A~</td><td>(0.107) N/A~</td><td>(0.076) N/A~</td><td>(0.093) 0.244*</td><td>N/A~</td></tr><tr><td>△ In Cost of Job Loss</td><td>(0.105) -0.035***</td><td>-0.013</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.130)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>△ ln Normalized Cost of Job Loss</td><td>(0.012)</td><td>(0.010)</td><td>N/A~</td><td>-0.009</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>△ In Expected Cost of Job Loss</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.010)</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.007 (0.006)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td> ln Expected Cost of Job Loss (-1)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.006) -0.015*</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>△ In Union Activity</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.008)</td><td></td><td>N/A~</td><td>N/A~</td></tr><tr><td>△ Fiscal Policy Stance</td><td></td><td>N/A~</td><td></td><td>N/A~</td><td></td><td>N/A~</td><td></td><td>N/A~</td></tr><tr><td> Monetary Policy Stance</td><td></td><td>-0.001 (0.001)</td><td></td><td>-0.001</td><td></td><td>-0.000</td><td></td><td>-0.002*** (0.001)</td></tr><tr><td>△ Monetary Policy Stance (-1)</td><td></td><td>0.003*** (0.001)</td><td></td><td>(0.001) 0.003*** (0.001)</td><td></td><td>(0.001) 0.002***</td><td></td><td>0.003*** (0.001)</td></tr><tr><td>2007Dummy</td><td>-0.006 (0.005)</td><td>0.002 (0.004)</td><td>-0.007 (0.005)</td><td>-0.001 (0.004)</td><td>-0.015** (0.006)</td><td>(0.001) -0.008** (0.004)</td><td>-0.021*** (0.007)</td><td>0.002 (0.004)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"8\">ARDL Lag Structure</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>In Labor Share Bargaining Power Variable</td><td>2 lags</td><td>1 lag</td><td>1 lag</td><td>1 lag</td><td>1 lag</td><td>1 lag</td><td>2 lags</td><td>1 lag</td></tr><tr><td>Fiscal Policy Stance</td><td> 0-1 lags</td><td>0-1 lags</td><td>0lags</td><td>0-1 lags</td><td>0-2 lags</td><td>0-1 lags</td><td>0 lags</td><td>0 lags 0 lags</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>0lags 0-2 lags</td><td></td><td>0 lags 0-2 lags</td><td></td><td>0 lags 0-2 lags</td><td></td><td>0-2 lags</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"8\">Monetary Policy Stance</td></tr><tr><td>ARDL Adjusted R2</td><td>0.935</td><td>0.959</td><td>Diagnostics 0.931</td><td>0.959</td><td>0.934</td><td>0.955</td><td>0.909</td><td>0.949</td></tr><tr><td>ECMAdjusted R2</td><td>0.409</td><td>0.638</td><td>0.370</td><td>0.638</td><td>0.405</td><td>0.603</td><td>0.168</td><td>0.548</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>14.032***</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Bounds Test F-statistic</td><td></td><td>17.004***</td><td>17.288***</td><td>16.682***</td><td>5.531</td><td>15.283***</td><td>7.073*</td><td>14.069***</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n#### Table 1. Labor Share Estimates, 1960-2016  \n\nSignificance levels: $\\scriptstyle***=1\\%$ $\\ast\\ast=5\\%$ $\\scriptstyle*=10\\%$ . Values in parentheses are Newey-West standard erors. In the case of the bounds test F-statistic, the null hypothesis is no levels relationship, based on the I(1) critical value. For allreported specifications, significance levels for this test are identical regardless of whether the asymptotic or finite sample critical values are used. The significance levels for the speed of adjustment parameter are based on the t-bounds test I(1) critical value.  \n\n\\~Coefficients for $\\Delta$ In labor share are only calculated if there is more than one lag of the dependent variable. The first lag of the dependent variable enters the error correction model through the error correction term, for which the speed of adjustment parameter is the coefficient. Similarly, short-run coefficients are only calculated for independent variables if they have more than one lag. Variables with no lags are not included in the estimates, but the contemporaneous values are treated as the sum of the lagged variable and the change in the variable so that they can be properly included in the error correction term (EViews 2020b).   \ntThe addition of the second lag of the expected cost of job loss limits the sample size to 1961-2016.   \ntt This parameter is not significant based on the I(1) critical values but is above the I(O) critical value for the $10\\%$ significance level.  \n\nThe first specification suggests a strong relationship between the baseline cost of job loss measure and the labor share in both the short and long run.22 The bounds test F-statistic is above the upper critical value, suggesting cointegration and a long-run relationship. Both the short-run and long-run coefficients are significant at the $1\\%$ level, suggesting that the cost of job loss can explain both the short-run and long-run behavior of the labor share. The levels equation coefficient indicates that a $1\\%$ increase in the cost of job loss would lead to a roughly $0.11\\%$ reduction in the labor share in the long run. This relationship has the expected sign, as reductions in labor bargaining power as measured by increases in the cost of job loss are associated with lower levels of the labor share. The speed of adjustment parameter suggests that about $40\\%$ of disequilibrium is corrected within a year. Results are similar when using the normalized cost of job loss measure, although the speed of adjustment is slower and the short-run coefficient on the normalized cost of job loss is not estimated because no lags of this variable are included in the underlying ARDL model.  \n\nRelationships between the labor share and either the expected cost of job loss or the union activity variable appear to be considerably weaker. The bounds test $\\mathrm{F}$ -statistic in the expected cost of job loss specification with no control variables is below both the I(1) and I(O) critical values, suggesting no long-run cointegrating relationship between this measure and the labor share. As such, no inference should be drawn from the coefficients relating this measure and the labor share (in either specification), which are reported only for the sake of completeness.  \n\nIt is possible that the expected cost of job loss is not a strong measure of labor bargaining power since the unemployment rate may overstate the health of the labor market because it does not account for the duration of a jobless spell, income-assistance program generosity, or reemployment income. Moreover, it is possible that the decline in the unemployment rate overstates the health of the labor market following the Great Recession due to declining labor force participation. Therefore, interacting it with the cost of job loss weakens the results, suggesting the cost of job loss is a more robust proxy for bargaining power when it is included in its original form. In the case of the union activity proxy for bargaining power, there is weak evidence of cointegration, as the bounds test Fstatistic is above the I(1) critical value for the $10\\%$ level. However, the long-run coefficient is insignificant and no short-run coefficient is calculated because no lags of union activity are included in the ARDL model.  \n\nIn all specifications including the fiscal and monetary policy control variables, the long-run coefficients on these variables have the expected signs and are statistically significant. A more expansionary fiscal policy stance is associated with a higher long-run labor share, while a more hawkish monetary policy stance is associated with a lower long-run labor share. The contemporaneous short-run coefficient on the monetary policy variable is insignificant in most specifications. The lagged short-run coefficient is significant in all specifications in which it is  \n\nincluded, but it has an anomalous positive sign. Including these variables increases the speed of adjustment parameter in the error correction model, and the short-run coefficient on either the baseline cost of job loss or normalized cost of job loss is insignificant in these specifications.  \n\nOne interpretation of this result is that the distributional effects of short-term fluctuations in labor bargaining power, driven by changes in aggregate demand, can be attenuated by government policies, although the long-run equilibrium relationship remains strong. However, we can't rule out the possibility that our method of constructing these policy variables does not completely remove business cycle effects, such as the lagged effects of the output gap on the federal funds rate or the primary deficit. If this is the case, these variables may be capturing some of the effects of demand on distribution that operate through the bargaining power channel, making our bargaining power variable insignificant in the short run. A final possibility is that the aggressiveness of government responses to the business cycle affects the cost of job loss, suggesting colinearity between these variables. We include the fiscal and monetary stance variables in the cost of job loss regressions discussed below to test this possibility. However, given that including these variables increases the adjusted- $\\mathbf{\\nabla}\\cdot\\mathbf{R}^{2}$ values, it is likely that the cost of job loss does not fully capture the distributional effects of monetary and fiscal policy responses.  \n\nThe long-run coefficients on the baseline and normalized cost of job loss measures are also somewhat reduced when including these control variables, but they remain significant at the $1\\%$ level. Conversely, the significance of the union activity measure changes when adding these control variables, as it becomes significant at the $5\\%$ level. However, it remains fairly weak, as a $1\\%$ increase in union activity is associated with only a $0.03\\%$ increase in the labor share. Moreover, the adjusted$\\mathrm{R}^{2}$ values are higher in specifications including the cost of job loss measures than the proxy for union activity. As such, the results suggest that the cost of job loss may be a better measure for empirically explaining the behavior of the labor share than narrower measures like union activity that capture only one aspect of bargaining power.  \n\nThe results above suggest that the cost of job loss is a strong determinant of the labor share. In the next step of our empirical analysis, we examine the determinants of the cost of job loss in order to explore the underlying factors that influence the labor share through this bargaining power channel. The cost of job loss equation estimates are shown in Table 2. In these estimates, the individual, “short-run” coefficients represent the direct effects of current (in the case of contemporaneous variables) or past (in the case of lagged variables) changes in the independent variable on the dependent variable in time period t, whereas the “long-run” coefficients represent the cumulative effect, including both the direct contemporaneous and lagged effects (if lags are included) of the independent variable, as well as the indirect effects that it has through lags of the dependent variable in future periods (time $\\mathsf{t}{+}1$ through $_{\\mathrm{t}+4}$ in the case of the specification with the baseline cost of job loss, because it includes four lags of the dependent variable).23  \n\nTable 2.

 \n\nSignificance levels: $***=1\\%$ $\\ast\\ast=5\\%$ $*=10\\%$ . Values in parentheses are Newey-West standard errors. Longrun coefficients represent the sum of contemporaneous and any lagged coefficients for the independent variable, divided by one minus the sum of coefficients on the lags of the dependent variable. Their significance levels are based on Wald tests of the null hypothesis that the long-run coefficient equals zero, and their standard errors are calculated based on the Delta method.  \n\n+ The sample period for this specification is 1960-2016. The other two specifications are limited to a sample of 1962-2016 due to the addition of three lags of the dependent variable.  \n\nFocusing first on the specification using the baseline cost of job loss measure, the results support the hypothesized relationships. The structural change index is found to be positively associated with the cost of job loss, and both the short-run and long-run coefficients are statistically significant. This finding supports the hypothesis that the various macroeconomic changes captured in the index have reduced labor bargaining power. The long-run coefficient indicates that a $1\\%$ increase in the structural change index leads to a $0.47\\%$ increase in the cost of job loss. As expected, GDP growth is found to have a negative effect on the cost of job loss, reflecting improvements in labor bargaining power as the economy grows and labor markets tighten.  \n\nHowever, coefficients on the interaction term are significant, indicating that the size of these business cycle effects on the cost of job loss are influenced by structural changes in the U.S. economy. The effect of GDP on the cost of job loss is considerably stronger when the structural change index has a higher value. For example, plugging in the average log-structural change index for the 1960s, a one percentage point decrease in the growth rate of GDP would increase the cost of job lossby about $6.2\\%$ , but based on the value of the log-structural change index from 2000-2016, the same decrease in the GDP growth rate would increase the cost of job loss by about $38.1\\%$ These results suggest that structural changes in the U.S. economy have both raised the cost of job loss overall and made it more sensitive to the business cycle. As such, the higher average cost of job loss throughout the 2000s can likely be explained by a combination of direct effects of the various structural changes on labor bargaining power, greater sensitivity of labor bargaining power to the business cycle as the result of these structural changes, and slower average GDP growth.  \n\nThe fiscal and monetary policy stance variables have the expected signs but are insignificant. This result suggests that the cost of job loss is likely not collinear with these variables in the labor share estimates. However, it is still possible that these variables are capturing some business cycle effects.24  \n\nWe find that the cost of job loss is a strong determinant of the labor share and that the responsivenes of the cost of job loss to the business cycle increases with the structural change index, suggesting that the responsiveness of the labor share to the business cycle should increase along with structural changes in the U.S. economy. The variance of the labor share is 5.7 times larger in the second half of our sample period, relative to the first even though business cycle fluctuations were smaller in magnitude (the variance of GDP growth in the second half of the sample period was Only about $49\\%$ that of the first half). Our results therefore provide some explanation for the increased volatility of the labor share.  \n\nMost of the results found using the baseline cost of job loss measure are robust to using the normalized cost of job loss instead. However, there is one key difference—the long-run coefficient on the structural change index is found to be insignificant. Although the individual, short-run coefficient is weakly significant, suggesting that the structural change has some impact on the  \n\nnormalized cost of job loss, the cumulative effect becomes insignificant when accounting for effects through the lagged dependent variable. However, the interaction term remains significant, suggesting that structural changes have stil increased the responsiveness of the normalized cost of job loss to the business cycle.  \n\nResults are considerably weaker when using the expected cost of job loss. In fact, no longrun coefficients are found to be significant. Even the cumulative effects of GDP growth are insignificant, although the short-run coefficients are significant. This further suggests that interacting the cost of job loss with the unemployment rate, which overstates the strength of the labor market, is not a strong proxy for bargaining power. It can also help to explain why no strong relationship was found between this measure and the labor share, as the underlying factors that we suspect impact the labor share through a bargaining power channel are not strongly related to the expected cost of job loss.  \n\nTaken as a whole, the results of our analysis support the hypothesis that both the business cycle and structural changes in the U.S. economy affect the labor share through a bargaining power channel. Bargaining power, as measured by the cost of job loss, is found to be a strong determinant of the labor share in both the short run and long run, although we do find that the short-run effects can be overridden by government policy. The cost of job loss itself is found to be impacted by GDP growth, the structural change index capturing a number of key macroeconomic changes, and the interaction of these two variables. As such, our findings suggest that these macroeconomic changes, along with fluctuations in GDP, influence the functional distribution of income through their effect on labor bargaining power. Our results also suggest that the cost of job loss can better explain the behavior of the U.S. labor share than our alternative bargaining power measure, union activity.  \n\n### 6. Conclusion  \n\nWe find that structural changes in the U.S. economy since 1960—deindustrialization, globalization, financialization, rising market concentration, and technological change—-have had a strong effect on workers bargaining power, as proxied by the cost of job loss. Our results, based on various specifications of an ARDL model, suggest that these factors, which we capture using an index of structural change, have not only increased the cost of job loss directly, but also increased its sensitivity to business cycle fluctuations. As such, we argue that the combination of these direct and indirect effects of structural changes, along with slower average GDP growth, have caused a reduction in labor bargaining power, as measured by a higher average cost of job loss in the $21^{\\mathrm{st}}$ century.  \n\nThis reduction in bargaining power can explain much of the fall in labor's share of national income. Using the bounds testing method, we find that the cost of job loss is a strong determinant of the labor in both the short and long run. However, the short-run effects are sensitive to the inclusion of variables capturing the agressiveness of fiscal and monetary policy responses to the business cycle, suggesting that government policy may override the distributional effects of changes in bargaining power in the short run. Our finding that the cost of job loss has become more sensitive to the business cycle as a result of various structural changes in the U.S. economy also provides a potential explanation for increasing volatility in the labor share, although a full exploration of this issue is beyond the scope of this paper.  \n\nOur findings provide a potential framework for future research. We argue that subsequent analyses should use comprehensive summary measures, as opposed to individual variables, when looking at long-term structural dynamics because many variables reinforce each other. For example, deindustrialization and deunionization are accelerated by globalization, in addition to automation. Financialization and automation support the rise of large firms, increasing market concentration.  \n\nThese feedback effects suggest a multivariate measure of structural change could provide a more useful empirical approach to analyzing the changes in labor's share of income. A similar approach is also warranted for bargaining power. Although union membership and the unemployment rate are broad measures of workers ability to claim a share of national income, they omit critical labor market dynamics that also affect bargaining power, such as the secular increase in unemployment duration, the generosity of income-support programs, and the potential for lower reemployment wages. Finally, although our paper does not examine the effects of the falling labor share, its insights might be useful for the vast literature that does, as explicitly modeling this bargaining power channel could improve our understanding of the complex interactions between the labor share and macroeconomic outcomes.  \n\nThese findings also suggest a large role for policy in shaping economic outcomes, both in terms of equity and efficiency. In the short run, strong fiscal and monetary policy responses can reduce the impact of the business cycle on both output and the income distribution. In the long run, policies that have shaped the U.S. experience with the various structural changes discussed in this paper have resulted in both lower bargaining power for labor and higher inequality. Although an examination of the effects of these changes on output is beyond the scope of this paper, the sharp decline in the labor share and sluggish rates of economic growth in recent decades suggest that these policies have primarily benefitted capital at the expense of labor, rather than creating widely shared benefits. Economists and policymakers should more carefully consider these distributional impacts when examining potential policies. We argue that focusing on bargaining power can be a helpful way to frame these issues. Our analysis suggests that policies that increase workers? bargaining power such as more expansive income-support programs, guaranteed employment, and pro-union legislation—could be implemented to reduce inequality between capital and labor.  \n\n### Appendix  \n\nThe appendix contains data definitions and sources, and supplemental estimates used in the empirical analysis.  \n\nTable A1.

Labor's share is an important indicator of the primary distribution of national income, and its fall has drawn significant attention from researchers and policymakers. As China's many regions have different development levels and economic structures, it is very likely that labor's share will differ across regions. Thus, it is important to examine the regional disparity of labor's share. In this paper, we develop a conceptual framework based on existing theories to identify the factors that influence labor's share. We, then, use Chinese provincial data from 1997 to 2007 to describe the regional differentials in labor's share and its evolution over the 10-year period and to explain regional disparity in labor's share. We take into consideration spatial correlations across regions and employ spatial cross-sectional and panel models in the empirical analysis. We found that industrial composition and ownership structure were the two key factors that influence labor's share. We also found that the average labor income was lower but labor's share was higher in western areas compared to eastern areas. The higher levels of labor's share in western provinces may be explained by a higher share of agricultural industries and state-owned enterprises, as agriculture and state-owned sectors tend to distribute more income to labor than to capital.  \n\nKey words: labor share; income distribution; regional disparity  \n\nJEL codes: J24 J30 R11  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nDespite the recent growth miracle experienced in China, labor's share, i.e., the share of GDP income attributed to labor, has decreased. Labor's share is an important indicator of the primary distribution of national income. Previous research has indicated that the recent widening of income inequality in China is related to the primary distribution of national income and, specifically, a low labor share (Li et al., 2009). Moreover, China has recently attempted to transform its economy from an investment- and export-led system toward a consumption-driven structure.  Increasing labor's share and hence raising domestic consumption levels are crucial if China wishes to successfully transform its economy. Therefore, it is not surprising that since 2005, China's falling labor's share has drawn significant attention from both researchers and policymakers (Li S., 2007; Cai, 2005, 2006; Li D., 2007).  \n\nWhile several studies have examined the decrease in labor's share in China at a national level (Bai et al., $2009\\mathrm{a}$ ; Li et al., 2009), there is little research on regional disparity regarding labor's share. As China's regions display varying levels of development and economic structure, it is likely that labor's share will also vary among regions. Thus, it is important to examine the regional disparity in labor's share to develop regional-specific policies.  \n\nFirst, using provincial panel data from 1997 to 2007, we describe the regional differentials in labor's share and its evolution over the 10-year period. We created spatial maps for each year and our results show that despite the lower levels of labor income, labor's share was high in western provinces from 1997 to 2007. Second, we attempt to explain regional disparity in labor's share. We estimated cross-sectional spatial regression models and spatial panel models. We found that industrial structure and ownership structure are the two main factors that influence labor's share. The higher levels of labor's share in the western provinces are significantly related to a higher share of agricultural industries and state-owned enterprises.  \n\nThe structure of this paper is as follows: In Section 2, we review empirical studies on labor's share in the international literature and in China. Section 3 presents a conceptual framework to explain the driving forces of labor's share, and discusses why they are relevant in the context of China. Section 4 explains the data source and describes regional disparity regarding labor's share and its evolution from 1997 to 2007. Section 4 presents spatial models and empirical results. Section 5 summarizes and discusses the results.  \n\n## 2. Related studies  \n\n2.1 Review of international studies on labor's share  \n\nThe stability of labor's share has been labeled as a “stylized fact of growth\" by David Ricardo (Kruger, 1999). However, researchers have surprisingly found a downward trend of labor share from the 1970s to early 2000, yet the absolute value and the change in labor share were quite different across Euro zone countries (De Serres et al., 2001; Moral and Genre, 2007). In the U.S., although studies suggest that from the 1960s to 1990s, the share of labor's income in U.S. GDP had been relatively stable or even slightly increased (Poterba, 1997; Raffalovich et al., 1992), this increase was mostly attributed to the expansion of workers′ non-cash benefits, while wage share had fallen by three percentage points. This pattern was also a result of the two offsetting effects: on the one hand, the share of labor income in the manufacturing sector had decreased sharply; on the other hand, labor share in the service industry had increased (Young, 2006).  \n\nWith regard to the factors that influence labor's share, technology progress, and labor bargaining power have been found to be important explanatory variables of labor's share (Bentolila and Saint-Paul, 2003; Blanchard et al., 1997; Rafflaovich et al., 1992). In addition, labor's share has been shown to be highly correlated with the sectoral composition of the economy (Young, 2006; De Serres et al., 2001; Moral and Genre, 2007). Measurement errors and the different methods used to calculate employee compensation may also contribute to the different labor shares reported across countries (Gollin, 2002; Krueger, 1999). Other factors proposed by researchers to explain labor share include globalization and international trade (Harrison, 2002).  \n\n### 2.2  Review of studies on China's labor share  \n\nEmpirical studies in China concerning labor's share are relatively new. Cai (2005, 2006) was amongst the first to notice the falling trend in China's labor share. Most of the existing studies believed that the declining labor share in China was driven by economic forces, whereas Bai and Qian (2010) argued that measurement issues were behind a significant proportion of the decline in China's labor share, and that the reported fall in labor share was largely overstated.  \n\nThe main explanations for the declining labor share in China, proposed by previous studies, include: (1) the shift in the industrial composition from agriculture to non-agriculture (Bai and Qian, 2010; Li et al., 2009); (2) privatization, restructuring of SOEs, and the change in the ownership structure of the economy (Bai and Qian, 2010; Bai et al., 2008; Luo and Zhang, 2009; Zhou et al., 2010); (3) foreign direct investment (Luo and Zhang, 2009; Shao and Huang, 2010). Other factors, such as relative price changes, the factor input ratio, and biased technology progress, are generally insignificant in explaining the falling labor share (Bai and Qian, 2010).  \n\nIn contrast to most of the studies that have been focused on the falling of the labor share, Li et al. (2009) proposed a U-shaped pattern regarding the movement of labor's share in China. The explanation they gave for the U-shaped pattern is related to the shift in the sectoral composition. They built a theoretical model to show that as labor moves from agriculture to non-agriculture, labor's share will first decline than increase.  \n\nAlthough there are several studies, as mentioned above, that have analyzed China's labor share, most of these studies have used data at either country or firm-level. Compared to the country level studies, the provincial or firm level studies could utilize more variation to examine the causes of the falling labor share. To date, the few provincial-level studies have not considered the spatial correlation in economic variables between provinces, nor have they specifically addressed the regional disparity in labor's share in China. Since spatial externality is very likely to exist in the provincial data, it is necessary to use spatial econometric models in the estimation. For example, Tian et al. (2010) demonstrated the externality in economic growth between regions in China.  \n\nMoreover, China is a country with vast territory. Different regions have different levels of economic and social development. Regional economic disparity has been intensively discussed. The previous studies have examined regional disparity regarding economic growth and regional wage differentials (Jian et al., 1996; Fleisher and Chen, 1997; Wang and Yao, 2001; Cai et al., 2002; Tian et al., 2010; Démurger et al., 2012), but not in terms of the primary distribution of national income and labor's share.  \n\nOur study attempts to contribute to the existing literature by first demonstrating the regional differences in labor's share and, second, by using spatial econometric models to explain regional disparity. Our study provides a robustness check to the prior studies that use OLS models to analyze provinces’ labor share. We also consider the explanatory variables that have not been examined by previous provincial-level studies, such as international trade, patents, and human capital.  \n\n## 3. Conceptual framework  \n\nIn this subsection, we provide a conceptual framework for understanding the factors that influence labor's share. To guide the empirical analysis, we focus on the factors that are included in our later empirical model, specifically, industrial composition, state ownership, technology progress, international trade, and human capital. Rather than proposing new theories, we apply the existing theories to develop the conceptual framework.  \n\nIn the neoclassical economic theory, the constant factor share is a stylized fact. Under perfect competition, the total wage bill will adjust at the same rate as the productivity of labor, and the labor's share in the total output will be constant. However, different industries and countries could have different production elasticities and hence different labor shares. Solow (1958) demonstrated a significant variation in labor's share across industries and the change in the labor share within an industry, while Douglas (1976) showed a variation in labor's share across countries. ² The fact that a country's aggregate labor share is relative stable could be due to the counter-shift in the weight of the sector when the sectoral labor share shifts, e.g. the low-share industry gaining in weight when the sectoral labor share rises (Solow, 1958). The later studies showed that a shift towards industries with a lower labor share has been the most important underlying force driving the downward trend in the labor share in Europe (de Serres et al, 2001; Arpaia et al., 2009).  \n\nIn China, provinces have different industrial compositions. Some provinces are still traditional agricultural provinces, while others have developed a large industrial sector. The industrial composition is also moving in different directions for different provinces: the less-developed provinces are shifting from agriculture to manufacturing, while the more developed areas are moving towards a service economy. The regional disparity in industrial composition could contribute to the regional disparity in the level and trend of labor's share.  \n\nLabor institutions, such as unions, could affect labor's share through the effect on labor's bargain power. Blanchard et al. (1997) incorporated firm and employee bargaining power in the model to explain a country's movement in labor's share. Rafflaovich et al. (1992) did not find evidence that a tight labor market increased labor income shares by increasing the bargaining power of labor. In the empirical analysis, the power of labor, relative to that of capital, cannot be directly measured. However, in firms with different ownership structures, the collective power of labor may be different. Azmat et al. (2007), in their theoretical model, linked the worker's bargaining power to privatization, and then to labor's share. Privatization and state ownership are also important in the context of China. Presumably in the state sector, workers may have a greater voice than those in private and foreign sectors. If a region has a larger state sector, we predict that labor's share is higher.  \n\nTechnology progress is another important driving force of the movement of labor's share. Bentolila and Saint-Paul (2003) pointed out that when capital and labor were highly substitutable, technical progress, specifically a capital-augmenting technical progress, will negatively influence labor's share, because capital-augmenting technical improvements would increase the marginal productivity of capital rather than that of labor. Lawless and Whelan (2011) suggested that the change in technology be an important underlying factor behind the declining labor share in many industrial sectors in Europe.  \n\nGlobalization is believed to be an influential factor of labor share movement in developing countries. Openness to trade is often associated with a fall in the protection of domestic labor-intensive goods (e.g., agricultural products), and is thus expected to lower labor's share (Harrison, 2002). Using cross-country data, Harrison (2002) found that the trade share had indeed a significantly negative effect on labor's share.  \n\nFinally, human capital may be an explanatory factor of labor's share. According to the existing studies, human capital has two opposing effects on labor's share. On the one hand, a higher labor share may be found for regions with a more educated workforce, as in these regions a higher share of labor compensation would go to high-skilled workers, and the wages of high-skilled workers are generally higher. On the other hand, a higher share of high-skilled workers is often associated with greater capital intensity and advanced technology, and thus a lower labor share. Evidence from Poland appears to support the second hypothesis (Growiec, 2009).  \n\nIn China, technology progress, international trade, and human capital, are all relevant factors in explaining regional disparity in labor's share. Regardless of the indicator used, patents, R&D investment, or productivity efficiency, provinces all displayed a significant variation in technology progress. Moreover, despite the overall trade surplus, some provinces had large net imports while others had net exports.? The human capital level also varied significantly across provinces. For example, in Beijing, college-educated workers accounted for $34\\%$ of the labor force in 2007, while they accounted for only $3\\%$ in Anhui. 4 All these three factors could explain a portion of the variation in the labor's share across provinces, and thus should be included in the empirical analysis, in addition to industrial composition and state ownership.  \n\n## 4. Data  \n\n### 4.1 Data source  \n\nData used in this study are sourced from China Statistical Yearbooks, China Labor Statistical Yearbooks and China Statistical Yearbooks on Science and Technology, from 1997 to 2007. Total labor compensation, GDP, total outputs from the agricultural, industrial, and service sectors, net export, size of labor force, the number of employees working for enterprises of different ownership type, fixed-capital investment, foreign direct investment,? and provincial patent applications are selected from the China Statistical Yearbooks. Since 1996, the educational attainment of workers has been reported in Labor Statistical Yearbooks. The R&D investment data is drawn from the China Statistical Yearbooks on Science and Technology. In Appendix, the mean and standard deviation of key variables are reported.  \n\nA spatial coordinate matrix for spatial regression models is generated using X-Y coordinates obtained from the fundamental geographic information system in the National Geomatics Center of China (NGCC). The fundamental geographic information system was built by NGCC to provide basic geographic information including geographic coordinates, provincial boundaries, administrative areas, rivers, and roads.  \n\n### 4.2 Regional disparity in labor share  \n\nWe follow previous studies and calculate labor's share as the share of the total labor compensation in national income. The total labor compensation, sourced from National Statistical Yearbooks, is defined as “all the compensation paid to labor for their productive activities.\" In this definition, labor's compensation contains all forms of wages, bonuses, and allowances. For self-employed workers, due to difficulty in distinguishing labor compensation and operation profit, both are classified as labor compensation. ′ Gollin (2002) stated that an incorrect measurement of self-employed income represented the majority of bias in the calculation of labor share. By including the operation profit of self-employed workers, we tend to overestimate labor share in China. Even with a positive bias, the estimated labor share is still relatively low compared to such countries as the US and Japan.  \n\nWe calculate the average labor compensation for each province by dividing the total labor compensation by total employment. Total employment is defined by the National Bureau of Statistics of China as “the population above 16 years of age who are engaged in work and earn labor income and operating income.\" It includes both urban and rural workers. In Table 1 we show the average labor compensation and labor's share for 31 provinces and municipal cities for selected years. Shanghai, the most developed city in China, had the highest average labor compensation (28.6 thousand Yuan per year per worker), but the lowest labor share for 1997-2007. In contrast, labor's shares for Guangxi and Tibet were greater than 0.6, indicating that over $60\\%$ of provincial GDP  was distributed to labor, rather than to capital and government. In these two provinces, the average labor compensation was relatively low.  \n\nTo show the movement of labor share in different regions, we select five provinces and municipal cities from five major regions in China, Beijing (representing northern China), Liaoning (northeast China), Shanxi (central China), Guangdong (southeast China), and Chongqing (western China). The labor shares for the five provinces and municipal cities are plotted for 1997-2007. Figure 1 suggests that not only are the levels of labor's share different across the regions, but also the movement of labor's share. Generally speaking, the five provinces all experienced a decrease in labor share between 1997 and 2007. However, the magnitude and timeline of the decrease is different for different provinces. Beijing shows that labor's share was in decline prior to 2003 and then increased after that date.  \n\nFigures 2 and 3 show the spatial maps of the average labor compensation and labor's share of provinces. Each year provinces are classified into five quantiles based on the average labor compensation (Figure 2) or labor's share (Figure 3). The maps show five shades of blue from light to dark, corresponding to the five quantiles. As shown in Figure 2, there exists a large variation in the average labor compensation across the country. The coastal areas had significantly higher average labor compensation than central and western areas. Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Liaoning had the highest average labor compensation levels, and their leading positions have not changed over time.  \n\nCompared with Figure 2, the spatial maps in Figure 3 show the different patterns of labor's share across the regions. While the coastal provinces had relatively high average labor compensation, they had lower labor share compared with western provinces. Sichuan and Guangdong clearly demonstrate this contradiction.  Figure 3 also captures the movement of spatial distribution regarding labor's share. After 2003, as a whole, China experienced a decrease in labor share. However, the most significant fall in labor share occurred in the north and northeast areas. Take Inner Mongolia as an example—it was in the first tier of provinces in terms of labor share from 1998 to 2003, and then fell to the bottom in the following 5 years.  \n\n## 5. Spatial regression results  \n\n### 5.1 Estimation of cross-sectional models  \n\nIn geographical data, neighboring areas often share more common characteristics than those that are far apart due to the interaction and spillover effects between regions. Traditional OLS regressions assume that observations are independent and uncorrelated. Spatial dependence clearly violates these assumptions, thus rendering conventional OLS analysis invalid. Therefore, a spatial econometric method is required in regional studies (Anselin, 1988; Baltagi et al., 2003; Anselin et al., 2008).  \n\nChina is a country with an extensive land area. Economic variables such as GDP, employment, and fixed-capital investment are likely to be subject to spatial dependence (Tian et al., 2010). The spatial maps in Figure 3 already suggest the spatial dependence of labor's share between neighboring regions. To further justify the adoption of spatial regressions, we calculate Moran's $I$ for labor's share and other key explanatory variables for 1997 to 2007. Moran's $I$ is commonly used to test the presence of spatial dependence. It is calculated as follows:  \n\n$$\nM o r a n^{\\prime}s~I=\\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n}~\\sum_{j=1}^{n}W_{i j}(Y_{i}-\\bar{Y})(Y_{j}-\\bar{Y})}{\\displaystyle S^{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}~\\sum_{j=1}^{n}W_{i j}}~,\n$$  \n\nIwhcre $S^{2}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{n}W_{i j}(Y_{j}-\\bar{Y}),\\mathrm{and}\\bar{Y}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_{i}.Y_{i}1$   \nprovince $i;~n$ represents the total number of provinces. $W_{i j}$ denotes the binary spatial weight matrix, which defines the adjacent relationship between provinces $i$ and $j$ $W_{i j}$ equals one if two provinces have a common border line and zero otherwise. As shown in Table 2, Moran's $I$ is significant for most variables. These results suggest that labor's share and other major explanatory variables are all significantly spatially correlated. Therefore, we use spatial regressions, including cross-sectional models and panel models, to estimate the regional disparity of labor's share.  \n\nThe commonly used spatial regression models are Spatial Lag Model (SLM) and Spatial Error Model (SEM). The difference between SLM and SEM lies in whether spatial dependence is modeled by the spatially lagged dependent variable or introduced in the disturbance term. We estimate both models with SEM defined as:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{l s=\\beta_{1}+\\beta_{2}X+\\varepsilon}}\\ {{\\varepsilon=\\lambda W\\varepsilon+\\mu}}\\ {{\\mu\\sim N(0,\\sigma^{2})},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nand SLM as:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{l s=\\rho W l s+\\beta_{1}+\\beta_{2}X+\\varepsilon}}\\ {{\\varepsilon\\sim N(0,\\sigma^{2})}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$l s$ : labor share, which is the ratio of the total labor compensation to GDP in a province.   \nSince the ratio lies in the interval [o, 1], we apply the logistical transformation to it. $X$  \n\nrefers to the factors that influence labor share.  \n\nXs include the following variables: (1) Industry represents the economic structure of a province, which is measured by the share of the outputs of the agricultural, industrial, and service sectors in GDP; (2) In patent is used to measure a province's technology progress. It is calculated as the logarithm of the number of invention patent applications per 10,0o0 population in a province. We have also used the total R&D investment of a province to indicate investment in technology; (3) Ownership indicates the ownership structure of a provincial economy, which is measured by “State\" and “non-state\", representing,  the percentages  of employees working  in  state-owned   and collectively-owned firms, and those in the non-state-owned, respectively. The non-state-owned enterprises include private, foreign, and joint-stockholding enterprises. (4) International trade denotes a province's share of net exports in GDP. (5) $H C$ refers to human capital variables. Specifically, we use three measures for human capital, “Tertiary', \"Secondary\", and “Primary\", which denote the percentage of workers with tertiary, secondary, and primary educational attainment; (6) In FCI is the logarithm of fixed-capital investment in a province in a year, and (7) Inemployee is the logarithm of the number of employees in the labor force. As in previous empirical studies (Bentolila and Saint-Paul, 2003; Li et al., 2009), fixed-capital investment and the size of the labor force are included as control variables in the models.  \n\nW is the $n\\times n$ spatial weight matrix. The parameter for the spatial error term and the spatially lagged dependent variable is represented by $\\lambda$ and $\\rho$ . To ensure the robustness of the results, we use several spatial weight matrices including a contiguity matrix,  \n\nK-nearest neighbor (KNN) matrix, and spatial coordinate matrix. α Estimations using different matrices provide robust results; the result using the KNN matrix is reported.  \n\nTable 3 reports both OLS and spatial regression estimates of the impact of industrial composition on labor's share. Columns (1) through (3) document OLS estimates without control variables. The OLS results with control variables are listed in Columns (4) to (6). Columns (7) to (12) report SEM and SLM estimates, respectively, with control variables. Several important findings emerge from Table 3: industrial composition is a crucial factor in explaining the regional disparity of labor's share in China. The coefficient estimates for agriculture in the labor's share regression are significantly positive, while those for industrial are significantly negative. This result implies that provinces that have a larger share of the agricultural sector and a smaller share of the industrial sector tend to distribute more income to labor than to capital. A further finding is that the effect of the agricultural sector on labor's share has decreased in the last 5 years. We also observe that the impact of the service sector on labor's share increased between 2003 and 2006. As predicted by Bentolila and Saint-Paul (2003), the growth of the service sector, which is a labor-intensive industry, had a positive effect on labor's share.  \n\nComparing spatial estimates to OLS estimates, we find that they are generally similar. However, spatial estimates are more statistically significant for some years. For example, service is insignificant in the OLS model in Column (6) for 2003, but is significant at the $5\\%$ level in the corresponding SEM model in Column (9). In general, the log likelihood of OLS models is smaller than the log likelihood of the corresponding spatial models. We also conduct Likelihood Ratio (LR) and Breusch-Pagan tests to compare the different models more rigorously. The results show that for recent years such as 2006 and 2007 spatial models significantly outperform OLS models, and that SLM models are more significant than SEM models.  \n\nTable 4 reports the effect of ownership structure on labor's share. The coefficient estimates are generally positive, indicating that a larger state sector is associated with a higher labor share, which supports the theory purported earlier. However, the estimate was only significant for 1999-2003, and after 2005 the estimate declined significantly. This may be due, in part, to the decline of labor's bargaining power and/or increase in both technology and capital intensity in the state sector.? The comparison of different models suggests that spatial models perform better than OLS in terms of the log likelihood and the differences are statistically significant for several years based on the LR test. Between the two spatial models, SLM seems to be better, as the LR test for SLM is significant in more number of years than SEM.  \n\nBesides the ownership structure, the FDI inflow could also demonstrate significant regional disparity. As shown in Appendix Table B, after controlling for the effect of FDI, the share of the state sector still has a significantly positive impact on labor's share for 1999-2003. FDI has a negative effect on labor's share, which is similar to the finding of Shao and Huang (2010). The regressions are also conducted for the effect of human capital, technology progress, and international trade on labor share. For brevity, the cross-sectional results are not reported. The results are generally consistent with the theory.  \n\nSince GDP is the denominator of both the dependent variable, labor's share, and several key explanatory variables that are measured as the ratios to GDP, such as agriculture, industrial, service, and international trade, we adopt the method used in Barro (1991) to correct for this potential simultaneous bias. We include GDP per capita in 1988 in the spatial regressions to control for the effect of the initial income level. Appendix Table C shows that with the inclusion of GDP per capita in 1988, the effect of agriculture, state, patent and international trade becomes smaller and insignificant, while the effect of industrial remains negative and significant. These findings suggest that the simultaneous bias does affect the estimate to a certain extent, but the effect of the industrial sector on labor's share is not impacted.  \n\nFinally, we consider potential endogeneity in the spatial cross-sectional model. The endogeneity problem may be less serious in the fixed effect specification because the fixed effect model controls for unobserved time-invariant provincial characteristics that affect labor's share. The cross-sectional model, however, is subject to the endogeneity bias because explanatory variables may be correlated with the error term. Correcting for endogeneity in the cross-sectional model is difficult because of the lack of proper instrumental variables. To test endogeneity in our model, we employ the spatial 2SLS method proposed by Kelejian and Prucha (1999). Following Dall'erba and Le Gallo (2008), we use two kinds of IVs. One is the spatial lag of all the explanatory variables; and the other is defined by the 3-group method, where the IV for an endogenous variable takes the value of 1, O, and $^{-1}$ based on whether the value of the original variable is in the top, middle, or bottom third of its ordinal ranking. By construction, this IV is correlated with the endogenous variable. In addition, Fingleton and Le Gallo (2008) proved that this kind of IV is relatively independent from the error term in spatial models.  \n\nWe estimate spatial 2SLS models for each year from 1997-2007. However, for brevity, we report the estimates only for 1997, 2003, and 2007 in Table 5. For each year, the first column uses the spatial lag of all the explanatory variables as IVs, and the second column uses the IVs defined by the 3-group method. Table 5 shows that the sign of coefficient estimates of spatial 2SLS models are, in general, consistent with OLS, SEM, and SLM estimates. However, spatial 2SLS estimates are smaller and statistically less significant.  \n\n### 5.2 Estimation with panel data models  \n\nPanel data are viewed as being more informative than cross-sectional or time-series data. With more variation and less collinearity among variables, panel data models often provide more efficient estimates (Hsiao, 1986). Elhorst (2003) developed panel models for spatial regression. Based on different decompositions of error terms, panel spatial models can be divided into fixed-effect and random effect models. Baltagi (2001) pointed out that if the data are limited to specific samples (such as the 31 provinces in this study), fixed-effect models are usually the better choice. We built a fixed-effect spatial error model, which included all the explanatory factors used in the cross-sectional estimation. In this model, the unobserved spatial fixed effects are controlled for. Spatial fixed-effects refer to the effects that vary across regions but do not change over time, for example, factor endowment.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{l s_{i t}=\\beta_{1}X_{i t}+\\eta_{i}+\\mu_{i t}}\\ &{}\\ &{\\mu_{i t}=\\lambda W\\mu_{i t}+\\nu_{i t},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\eta_{i}$ represents the spatial fixed-effects for sub-area i. W is the neighboring weighted matrix.  \n\nThe estimates of the fixed-effect spatial error model are reported in Table 6. Controlling the spatial fixed-effects, the model can well explain the movement of labor's share in China. The fixed-effect estimates are consistent with the cross-sectional spatial estimates, indicating that a province's higher agricultural and state sector share is associated with a higher labor share. Compared with provinces that have a larger share of primary level educated workers, provinces with more college-educated workers have a lower labor share when patents or R&D is not controlled for, but have a higher labor share when patents, R&D, and FCI is included in the regression. This result supports Growiec (2009), who argued that higher human capital is complementary to capital and technology, and thus is more likely to be associated with a lower labor share when capital or technology is not controlled for. But when the regression controls for capital and technology specifically, the effect of the higher human capital level on labor's share is positive.  \n\nThe negative impact of international trade on labor's share is shown in the spatial fixed-effect estimates, which confirms Harrison (2002), but the estimates are not statistically significant. Lnpatent and InR&D, which measures the extent of technology progress in a province, have a significantly negative coefficient estimate. It provides some supporting evidence to the theory that capital-augmenting technology progress is associated with a lower labor share. LnFCI has a negative effect on labor's share. Finally, the estimate for the spatial autocorrelation coefficient is also reported in Table 6. It is significant for all the specifications, which justifies the use of the spatial fixed-effect models.  \n\nWe further introduced the lagged dependent variable into the spatial fixed effect model.  \n\nAppendix Table D demonstrates that the one-year lagged labor share has a significantly positive coefficient estimate, suggesting a high degree of persistence in a province's labor share. The estimates for other explanatory variables are similar to those in Table 6, except that the estimate for patent and $R\\&D$ is less significant and that the effect of tertiary becomes positive for all the models.  \n\nIn the fixed effect models, the simultaneous bias stemming from the fact that GDP is the common denominator of both labor's share and several key explanatory variables is less severe, because the provincial fixed effect captures all the unobserved province-specific and time-invariant factors that affect the province's labor share. The effect of the level of GDP would be incorporated in the provincial fixed effect and would be dropped out in the fixed effect estimation.  \n\n## 5. Conclusions  \n\nThis paper addressed the important issues of the pattern and determinants of regional disparity in labor's share in China. Although there have been many studies on regional income disparity in China, few have considered regional disparity regarding the primary distribution of income between labor and capital. With respect to labor's share in China, further regional level studies are still required. Our study used detailed provincial data and spatial econometric methods to estimate the effect of industrial composition, ownership structure, and other provincial economic factors on labor's share.  \n\nEmpirical analysis identified several important findings. First, despite the lower average labor compensation, labor's share in western and central areas was high. In contrast, coastal areas with higher GDP and average labor incomes had lower labor shares. As labor's share is an important proxy for the primary distribution of national income, this finding implied that the distribution of aggregate output in underdeveloped areas is  \n\nweighted more toward labor than capital.  \n\nSecond, we examined the factors that explain the regional disparity and movement of labor's share, and found that the industrial composition and ownership structure of a province are the two most important factors. The higher labor share in western provinces is strongly related to the greater share of agricultural industry and the state sector. Moreover, a lower trade share and less-advanced technology may also contribute to the higher labor share in the western provinces. We also drew the important conclusion that an increase in an economy's share of the service sector will have a positive effect on labor's share.  \n\nOur finding of a higher labor's share in the less developed provinces in China stands in contrast to the stylized fact in the international literature that poor countries usually have a lower labor share than rich countries. A plausible explanation is still related to industrial composition. The developed countries usually have a large share of the service sector, while the service sector, as suggested by our results, leads to a higher labor's share. In contrast, the more developed area in China typically has a large concentration of the industrial sector while the less developed provinces are mostly agricultural. Our results indicate that the agricultural sector tends to distribute more to labor than the industrial sector.  With a large share of agriculture in the local economy, the less developed provinces tend to have a higher labor share than the more developed provinces in China.  \n\nBased on these empirical results, we predict that as industrialization and trade openness increase and technology advances in less-developed western regions, these regions may first experience the same downward trend in labor's share that eastern and northern regions have experienced. To avoid a falling labor's share, while maintaining rapid economic growth, western regions may, rather than following the traditional path of development from agriculture to manufacturing and then to service, take measures to boost the service sector, especially regarding high-waged professional services, as the service sector has a positive effect on labor's share.  \n\n## References:  \n\n[l] L.

It follows that these firms are likely to increase their cash holdings to reduce the risk of financial distress when employment protection is strengthened. Consistent with this prediction, we find that labor-intensive firms in China significantly increase their cash holdings following the enactment of China's Labor Contract Law; other contemporaneous shocks do not seem to drive the finding. We also find that two events prior to the enactment that increase the likelihood of enacting the law have a similar effect. Further analysis shows that the impact of the law is concentrated on areas with strict law enforcement, state-owned enterprises, and industries that employ large numbers of migrantworkers.  \n\n$\\circledcirc$ 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nEmployment protection through various regulations on labor is widespread globally. Given that human capital has become an increasingly important asset for firms (Zingales, 20oo), it is of great importance to study whether and how employment protection influences firms. Early studies have documented that it exerts a direct and significant impact on firms' real activities and performance.1 More recent studies begin to relate employment protection to corporate financial policies, and we are particularly interested in the work of Klasa et al.(2009). They use U.s. data and find that employment protection provided by unionization reduces corporate cash reserves. Their explanation is that unionization increases the collective bargaining power of workers, so firms in more unionized industries strategically hold less cash to shelter their income from labor unions' demands.  \n\nHowever, employment protection is a multi-dimensional concept. While the collective bargaining power of labor unions leads to a decrease in cash holdings, other institutions of employment protection may exert different impacts on cash holdings through alternative mechanisms. In particular, many measures of employment protection, including labor unions, increase firms' labor adjustment costs, which may also influence corporate cash policies but are not studied by Klasa et al. (2009). Thus, a more complete account of the role played by employment protection entails further investigation. In this paper, we complement the existing literature by examining how employment protection affects corporate cash holdings through the “labor adjustment costs\" channel.  \n\nOpler et al. (1999) show that a firm's cash level is mainly determined by the tradeoff between the costs and benefits of cash holdings. Under this tradeoff framework, we argue that the “labor adjustment costs\" channel of employment protection increases corporate cash holdings. Specifically, by raising firms’ adjustment costs of labor, employment protection increases the expected costs of financial distress (total costs of financial distress times its probability) through two effects. First, it is a common practice for financially distressed firms to discharge workers to cover cash flow shortfalls, so the increase in labor adjustment costs leads to an increase in the total costs of financial distress. Second,the increase in labor adjustment costs reduces firms'incentives to adjust their labor force in responses to economic conditions and hence increases their operating leverage, which implies a higher probability of financial distress, ceteris paribus. Both effects increase the expected costs of financial distress and firms' marginal benefits of holding one more dollar of cash. Therefore, firms rationally hoard more cash when employment protection is strengthened, which is also consistent with the precautionary motive of holding cash suggested by Keynes (1936). Furthermore, if this “labor adjustment costs\" channel indeed exists, the positive effect of employment protection on cash holdings should vary with labor intensity; it should be stronger for firms that are more labor intensive as labor costs account for a larger portion of their total costs.  \n\nWe take advantage of a policy change in China to test the above hypothesis. In 2007, China passed the Labor Contract Law (\"the LC Law\" hereafter), which came into effect on January 1, 2008. It specifies the nature of contracts that employers are obligated to provide to employees, increases severance payments to laid-off workers and, for the first time, specifies explicit penalties for firms that do not comply with the law. Compared to previous labor regulations, the LC Law significantly increases employment protection and makes firing workers costlier.  \n\nFor the purpose of empirical analysis, this policy change provides an ideal setting to test our hypothesis because the LC Law does not involve a collective bargaining mechanism and allows us to isolate the “labor adjustment costs\" channel. Furthermore, the law's passage is not due to firms' lobbying, and it can be considered a quasi-natural experiment from the perspective of individual firms. Using the law's enactment to identify exogenous variation in employment protection, we take a difference-in-differences approach to test our hypothesis and find supportive evidence. Specifically, we compare the changes in cash holdings of firms with high labor intensity (\"treatment group\" or “treated firms\") and those with low labor intensity (\"control group\" or “\"control firms\") before and after the enactment of the law. Our empirical analysis suggests that the treatment group experiences a relative increase of 2.1 percentage points in cash holdings as measured by the cash to noncash assets ratio, or a $10\\%$ increase as compared to the average ratio.  \n\nOur main finding is in sharp contrast to that of Klasa et al. (2009),who use U.s. data and find that employment protection provided by unionization reduces corporate cash holdings. Their explanation is that firms facing stronger unions strategically maintain low cash balances to gain bargaining advantages over organized labor. In fact, unionization is also likely to exert a positive impact on cash holdings by increasing labor adjustment costs, but it is dominated by the negative effect through the “collective bargaining power\" channel (Schmalz, 2015). By contrast, the LC Law of China, while offering more protections to workers, does not provide a collective bargaining mechanism. It implies that, with respect to the impact of this law, the “collective bargaining power\" channel that reduces corporate cash holdings is virtually nonexistent, and the “labor adjustment costs\" channel dominates. That is why employment protection provided by the LC Law of China increases corporate cash holdings. The contrast reveals that while they all aim to protect the rights of workers, different forms of employment protectionmaywork through different mechanisms and have diverse implications for firms. It also underscores the importance of analyzing institutional details before discussing the role of employment protection.  \n\nWe interpret our empirical results as the LC Law increasing the cash holdings of labor-intensive firms through the “labor adjustment costs\" channel. A potential concern is that our results are not caused by the LC Law, but by the difference in pretreatment trends of cash holdings between the treatment group and the control group. To address this concern, we examine the dynamics of cash holdings around the enactment of the Labor Contract Law.  \n\nThe dynamic analysis shows that there is no significant difference in cash holdings between the two groups prior to the enactment of the law, while cash holdings of treated firms experience a significant relative increase one and two years after the enactment of thelaw.  \n\nOur results could also be driven by other confounding factors. In particular, if there is a contemporaneous shock that also increases the cash holdings of labor-intensive firms, our results would suffer from the omitted variables bias. We adopt a number of strategies to tackle this endogeneity concern. First, we explicitly control for time-varying industrial and regional shocks, and the results are qualitatively unchanged. We then consider two prominent macroeconomic shocks around the enactment of the LC Law, the global financial crisis triggered by the 2007-2008 U.S. subprime mortgage crisis and China's implementing a stimulus plan to counter the global financial crisis. Our analysis shows that they do not cause the main finding.  \n\nTofurther reduce the concern that other contemporaneous shocks around the enactment of the LC Law drive our results, we examine twolegislation eventsprior to2008that may alsohave treatment effects. In 2o03, the Chinese government announced that the Labor Contract Law would be included in future legislation plans and started to organize discussions to seek public opinions. In 2005, the State Council passed a draft LC Law and submitted it to the Standing Law Committee of the National People's Congress for review. Both the discussion and the review of the draft increase the likelihood of implementing the LC Law and hence the expected firing costs of firms. If our hypothesis is true, the treatment group should rationally increase their cash holdings relative to the control group following the two events. The empirical analysis confirms this prediction, which mitigates the concern that our previous results are due to other contemporaneous shocks around 2008 and provides additional support for our hypothesis.  \n\nWe then conduct several cross-sectional tests to add more evidence to our argument. In particular, if labor-intensive firms indeed increase cash holdings after the enactment of the law due to the increase in labor adjustment costs, such an effect should vary cross-sectionally, depending upon the government's enforcement, firms' compliance with the law, and their ability to adjust cash reserves.  \n\nFirst, although the law should be effective everywhere in China, the actual extent of the employment protection it provides depends on local judicial practices. Given the large disparity of law enforcement in different areas of China, we expect that the effect of the LC Law on the cash holdings of the treatment group is stronger in areas with stronger law enforcement. Indeed, laborintensive firms in the subsample with strong law enforcement increase cash holdings significantly after the enactment of the LC Law, while such an effect is not observed in the subsample with weak law enforcement. Second, a firm should be more affected by the LC Law if it is more compliant with laws. Using state ownership as a proxy for compliance with laws, we find that the positive impact of the LC Law on the cash holdings of labor-intensive firms only appear in the group of state owned enterprises (SOEs） but not in the group of non-SOEs. Third, the LC Law increases employment protection more for migrant workers (temporary employees) than for formal employees, so the effect of the LC Law should be stronger for firms with a higher proportion of migrant workers, which is confirmed by our empirical analysis. Overall, the crosssectional tests corroborate our hypothesis.  \n\nOne underlying channel of our hypothesis is that the LC Law makes labor adjustment costlier for firms and hence increases their operating leverage. We directly test this mechanism to provide further evidence for our hypothesis. Using the elasticity of a firm's operating income with respect to its sales as a proxy for operating leverage, we find that the operating leverage increases after the enactment of the LC Law.  \n\nOur results also hold under other robustness checks. Using alternative measures for cash holdings and labor intensity, different sample periods, and other model specifications, we continue to find similar results.  \n\nIn a contemporaneous study, Karpuz et al. (2017) show that the changes of employment protection laws in 20 OECD countries have a positive impact on corporate cash holdings, which lends support to our findings. Our paper is also closely related to the recent study of Ghaly et al. (2017). They show that firms with a larger fraction of skilled workers, and thus higher costs to adjust their labor force in response to cash flow shocks, hold more cash for precautionary purposes. This provides additional evidence for the relationship between labor adjustment costs and cash holdings that underlies our hypothesis.  \n\nOur study contributes to the literature that relates corporate cash holdings to a country's institutional characteristics. Dittmar et al. (2003), Pinkowitz et al. (2003), and Ferreira and Vilela (2004) show that firms in countries with poor protection of investor rights hold more cash because of agency problems. On the other hand, Huang et al. (2013) find the opposite using a sample of cross-listed firms in the U.s., and they attribute their finding to investors valuing excess cash significantly more for firms with better investor protection in recent years. From the perspective of government quality, Caprio et al. (2013) document that if weak investor protection allows corrupt politicians to extract cash from firms, they tend to hold less cash and more physical assets, which makes it harder for politicians to extract rents. Kusnadi et al. (2015） reach the same conclusion by showing a positive relationship between local institutional development and cash holdings among Chinese listed companies. Additionally, by analyzing Chinese data but using a different proxy for local institutional development, Chen et al. (2014) note a negative relationship between local government quality and corporate cash reserves, and their explanation is that a good government helps mitigate firms' financial constraints and hence reduces their precautionary need for cash savings. There are also studies that examine the relationship between informal institutions and corporate liquidity. Chen et al. (2015) argue that national culture also explains corporate cash policies around the world by documenting a negative association of corporate cash holdings with individualism and a positive association with uncertainty-avoidance. Dudley and Zhang (2016) find that firms in countries with low levels of societal trust (are forced to) hold less cash due to shareholders' concerns of agency problems.2 We complement this line of research by linking a particular institutional dimension, employment protection, to corporate cash policies.  \n\nOur paper also adds to the growing literature that examines the influences of labor markets on other corporate policies, such as capital structure (Matsa, 2010; Berk et al., 2010; Bae et al., 2011; Chemmanur et al.，2013; Simintzi et al.,2015; Schmalz, 2015; Serfling, 2016), corporate financing decisions (Agrawal and Matsa, 2013), corporate governance (Atanassov and Kim, 2009), investment (Bai et al., 2017), mergers and acquisitions (John et al., 2015; Dessaint et al., 2016), and technological innovation (Acharya et al.,2013,2014; Bradley et al., 2017).  \n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the institutional background of China's Labor Contract Law. Section 3 develops our main hypothesis. Section 4 describes our empirical methodology and data. Section 5 presents the empirical results and discusses their implications. Section 6 concludes.  \n\n## 2. Institutional background  \n\nChina began to implement the “reform and opening up\" policy in 1978. Since then, factories and construction sites in Chinese urban areas have hired a huge number of low-skilled migrant workers from rural regions. As most migrant workers had no employment contract and limited access to legal protections, many worked under “sweatshop\" conditions, suffered from unhealthy work environments and the delay or even default of wages, and often lacked the basic social insurance in the early period of the reform. In 1995, the Chinese government implemented the Labor Law to set requirements on labor contracts, minimum standards of work conditions, and modes of resolving labor disputes. However, there is a major disconnect between the letter of the law and practice, and the law experienced compliance failures on a wide scale in China (Greenfield and Pringle, 2002; Pringle and Frost, 2003; Solinger, 1999; Zheng, 2009). Lee (2007) and Cooney (2007) argue that it did not penalize employers for violations sufficiently to induce compliance and thus provided little protection toworkers.  \n\nStarting from the 1990s, migrant workers began to protest and fight for their rights by engaging in more mass activities such as strikes, blocking roads, and occupying work sites (Li and Freeman, 2015). This gradually became a major headache for the government. Recognizing that the workers' increasing grievances about their unfair treatment was threatening social stability, China announced in 2003 that the LC Law would be included in future legislation plans; in 2005, a draft of the LC Law was proposed, and comments and suggestions were solicited; in 2007, the National People's Congress of China passed the LC law, which came into effect on January 1, 2008. The new law is considered to be highly protective of workers' rights, and it makes three significant improvements in labor protection compared to the Labor Law of 1995.  \n\nFirst, the LC Law emphasizes the fundamental rights of workers and requires companies to sign formally written contracts with workers “on the date the worker is recruited\". Contracts in written form are of key importance because it is the premise of winning a labor dispute arbitration. The LC Law also obligates employers to buy social insurance for their workers, obey the minimum wage policy and ensure a safe working environment. With respect to severance, the LC Law requires a 30-day written notice in advance before discharging the labor contract; the severance pay is obliged to be at least equal to one month's salary for each year of service (a half month's salary if the worker was employed for less than 6 months) and is doubled for unfair dismissal. According to the LC Law, employers are not allowed to discharge the labor contract unilaterally when the worker (1) acquires or is suspected of having acquired an occupational disease, (2) is injured on the job, (3) is pregnant, on maternity leave or is nursing, or (4) has worked for the employer for more than 15 years and has less than 5 years before his or her legal retirement age.  \n\nSecond, the LC Law presents a clear definition about the time limit of labor contracts, especially for the probationary period that had been abused by employers to reduce labor costs. The law states that \"when the term of a labor contract is greater than three months but less than one year, the probation period thereof shall not be more than one month\", “an employer can only stipulate one probation period with the same worker\",and“no probation period may be stipulated in a labor contract with a period to complete the prescribed work or in a labor contract with a fixed period of less than three months\". The LC Law also requires that after a worker completes two fixed-term contracts or ten years of employment, the labor contract must be made open-ended or permanent. Therefore, firms cannot save labor costs by deliberately extending the probation period and face more restrictions in recruiting temporaryworkers.  \n\nLast, the LC Law explicitly specifies penalties for violations, a feature not found in the labor law of 1995. It also increases workers' incentives to monitor their employers' compliance and report non-compliance by requiring that a sum be awarded from noncompliant employers to their workers whose legal rights are violated (Ji and Wei, 2013).  \n\nIt is a general consensus that the LC Law effectively improves protections for labor in China. Analyzing data from repeated crosssectional surveys of workers in the Pearl River Delta in 2006, 2008 and 2009,Li and Freeman (2015） provide evidence that the LC Law increased the percentage of workers with written contracts, raised social insurance coverage, and reduced violations of workers' rights and wage arrears. Park et al. (2012), Ji and Wei (2013), and Gallagher et al. (2014) also report similar findings.  \n\nWhile improving employment protection, the LC Law also increases labor costs. Chen and Funke (2009） analyze the interlinkages between labor market regulation and employment and suggest that the LC Law would increase the firing costs of employers in China compared to many other developing countries. This is also confirmed by a survey conducted by the Research Department of the People's Bank of China in 2009: most firms who answered the survey reported that the LC Law had increased labor costs and affected their hiring and firing decisions.  \n\nMost important to our study, the enactment of the LC Law is plausibly exogenous to individual firms. While some laws in the U.S. are passed due to lobbying by firms, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for firms to lobby legislators in China. Furthermore, no firm wishes for this law to pass because it increases labor costs. The above introduction also indicates that the passage of the LC Law was mainly due to the government's concern for social stability. Therefore, we can use the enactment of the LC Law to identify plausibly exogenous variation in labor adjustment costs and its causal impacts on corporate cash holdings.  \n\n## 3. Hypothesis development  \n\nOpler et al. (1999) empirically test two models of cash holdings: the static tradeoff model vs. the pecking order model. The former indicates that the level of cash holdings is optimally determined by the marginal costs and marginal benefits of cash. The latter is derived from the pecking order model of capital structure, which states that firms simply prefer internal finance to external finance and that there is no optimal leverage. It implies that there is no optimal level of cash; changes in cash reserves are driven by changes in internal funds, but it is a matter of indifference whether a firm uses the internal funds to accumulate cash or repay debts. Opler et al. (1999) find supportive evidence for the static tradeoff model.  \n\nUnder the static tradeoff framework of cash holdings, we argue that strengthening employment protection through the LC Law is likely to increase corporate cash holdings, especially for laborintensive firms. Specifically, as discussed in the last section, the LC Law makes labor adjustment costlier. This increases the expected costs of financial distress, which are the total costs of financial distress times its probability, in two ways. First, financially distressed firms usually have to lay off workers to cover cash flow shortfalls (Ofek, 1993; Kang and Shivdasani, 1997), so the increase in labor adjustment costs resulted from employment protection increases the total costs of financial distress. Second, higher labor adjustment costs makes firms less likely to adjust their labor force in response to economic conditions (Messina and Vallanti, 2007; Kugler and Pica, 2008). The labor costs of firms thus become more fixed due to the reduction in labor flexibility, which leads to higher operating leverage and a higher probability of financial distress, ceteris paribus (Mandelker and Rhee, 1984; Mauer and Triantis, 1994; Kahl et al., 2014). Therefore, reinforcing employment protection through the LC Law has a positive effect on the expected costs of financial distress, which in turn increases firms' marginal benefits of holding one more dollar of cash and strengthens their precautionary motive for hoarding cash. The positive effect of the LC Law on cash holdings should be particularly strong for labor-intensive firms given that the labor costs account for a large share of their total costs. Thus, our main hypothesis is as follows:  \n\nThe enactment of the LC Law increases cash holdings of laborintensivefirms.  \n\n## 4. Methodology and data  \n\n### 4.1. Research design  \n\nWe take advantage of a policy change in China, the enactment of the LC Law, to estimate the effect of employment protection on corporate cash holdings. As the passage of this law is plausibly exogenous to individual firms, we greatly reduce the concerns of endogeneity. Our hypothesis argues that the LC Law exerts a relatively larger impact on firms with high labor intensity than those with low labor intensity. We test this hypothesis by employing a difference-in-differences approach as follows:  \n\n$$\nC a s h_{i t}=\\gamma_{i}+\\lambda_{t}+\\beta(L C L a w_{t}\\times L a b o r I n t e n s i t y_{i})+\\delta^{\\prime}{\\bf X}_{i t}+\\varepsilon_{i t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $i$ and $t$ index the firm and year, respectively. The dependent variable $C a s h_{i t}$ represents firm i's cash holdings in year t, measured by the ratio of cash and marketable securities to total noncash assets (total assets minus cash and marketable securities） as in Opler et al. (1999). $\\gamma_{i}$ and $\\lambda_{t}$ indicate firm and year fixed effects, respectively. Labor Intensity; denotes firm i's labor intensity as measuredby the ratio of the number of employees to totalassets(in million yuan). To reduce endogeneity concerns, we measure this variable using the data of the beginning year of our sample period, which means it is constant for firm i. LC Lawt is a dummy variable that equals 1 if the LC Law is effective in year t and 0 otherwise.  \n\n$\\bf{X}_{i t}$ is a vector of control variables, including a number of variables considered to be the determinants of corporate cash holdings in the literature (Opler et al., 1999; Bates et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2012). They are as follows. Size is measured by the natural logarithm of sales; Leverage is the ratio of short-term debt plus longterm debt to total noncash assets; Operating Cash Flow is operating cash flow scaled by total noncash assets; Net Working Capital is calculated as noncash current assets minus current liabilities deflated by total noncash assets;Cash FlowVolatility denotes the cashflow volatility as measured by the standard deviation of cash flow from operations across all firms in the same industry;3 Capital Expenditure is capital expenditures scaled by total noncash assets; Age is the natural logarithm of the years of the firm being a publicly listed company; Market to Book is the ratio of the market value of assets to the book value of assets,where the market value of the assets equals the book value of assets minus the book value of equity plus the market value of equity; IPO Dummy is a dummy variable that equals 1 if the company had gone public in the last two years and 0 otherwise; Dividend Dummy is a dummy variable that is equal to 1 if the firm pays cash dividends in a given year and O otherwise; and Special Treatment is a dummy variable that is equal to 1 if the firm receives a special treatment (ST) designation from the stock exchange.4 Table 1 provides the detailed definitions of the variables.  \n\nTable 1 Variable definitions.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variables</td><td>Definitions</td></tr><tr><td>Cash</td><td>The ratio of cash and marketable securities to total noncash assets(total assets minus cash and marketable securities).</td></tr><tr><td>Laborintensity</td><td>availableyearbefore2008.</td></tr><tr><td>LC law</td><td>A dummyvariablethatequals1if theLCLawiseffectiveand0otherwise.</td></tr><tr><td>Firm size</td><td>Thenaturallogarithmofsales.</td></tr><tr><td>Firm age</td><td>Thenumberofyearssincethefirmwentpublic.</td></tr><tr><td>Operatingcashflow</td><td>Operatingcashflowscaledbytotalnoncashassets.</td></tr><tr><td>Cashflowvolatility</td><td>Thestandard deviationofcashflowfrom operationsacross allfirmsinthesameindustry.</td></tr><tr><td>Networking capital</td><td>Noncashcurrentassetsminuscurrentliabilitiesdeflatedbytotalnoncashassets.</td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td>Theratio of short-termdebtpluslong-term debtto total noncashassets.</td></tr><tr><td>Market tobook</td><td>Themarket value of assets(thebookvalue of assets minus thebook value of equityplus themarket value of equity)divided by the book value of assets.</td></tr><tr><td>Capitalexpenditure</td><td>Capitalexpendituresscaledbytotalnoncashassets.</td></tr><tr><td>IPOdummy</td><td>A dummyvariablethatequals1if thefirmwentpublicin thelast twoyears andOotherwise.</td></tr><tr><td>Dividend dummy</td><td>A dummy variable that equals 1 if the firm pays cash dividends in a givenyear and 0 otherwise.</td></tr><tr><td>Specialtreatment</td><td>A dummy variable that equals 1 if the firm receives a special treatment (ST) designation from the stock exchange.</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nIn this difference-in-differences specification, we can consider the treatment group to be firms with high labor intensity and the control group as firms with low labor intensity. The treatment effect is captured by $\\beta$ ，the coefficient of the interaction term LC $L a w\\times L a b o r$ Intensity, which is also our main interest. According to our hypothesis,we should have $\\beta>0$ if the enactment of the LC Law increases the cash holdings of high labor intensity firms relative to low labor intensity firms.5  \n\n### 4.2. Data  \n\nOur data are retrieved from the CSMAR database, a major financial data provider in China. The initial sample covers all listed companies in the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges from 2005 to 2010, a period that is symmetric to the effective date of the LC Law, January 1, 2008. We choose this 6-year window because it provides enough bandwidth to evaluate the impact of the policy change without introducing many confounding effects. If the time window is too large,our estimation maybe contaminated by other shocks. If it is too narrow, we may not be able to observe the influence of the LC Law because it takes time for firms to make adjustments and for the governments to fully implement the LC Law. Thus, there is a tradeoff here.6  \n\nStarting from the initial sample, we exclude financial and utility firms and firm-year observations with missing values on the regression variables discussed above. A firm's labor intensity is fixed at its value in 2005, the beginning year of the sample period. If the firm enters the sample in a later year bur prior to 2008, we use the labor intensity measured in that year. The firm is excluded if it enters the sample in 2008 or later, which ensures that the labor intensity is not affected by the LC Law.7 To increase the accuracy of the labor intensity measure, we also drop firms whose reported number of employees in 2005 is less than 50.8 We then winsorize all continuous variables at the 1st and 99th percentiles to mitigate the influence of outliers. Our final sample consists of 7258observations.  \n\nPanel A of Table 2 presents the summary statistics of all variables used in our baseline regression analysis. The mean level of corporate cashholdingsamounts to $20.8\\%$ of thetotalnoncash assets, and the standard deviation is 0.219, which suggests a remarkable variation in cash reserves across firms. The two statistics are sufficiently close to Chen et al.(2012), who use Chinese data to analyze the sensitivity of cash holdings to corporate governance. The average level of labor intensity is 1.374, indicating that publicly listed companies hire 1.374 workers per million yuan of the total assets. There is also wide variation in labor intensity across firms, as suggested by a standard deviation of 1.207. The distributions of the other variables are generally reasonable.  \n\nIn our difference-in-differences specification, the treatment group consists of firms with high labor intensity and the control group consists of firms with low labor intensity. Thus, it is interesting to compare the two groups before we conduct formal analysis. Panel B of Table 2 reports the means and standard deviations of all the regression variables separately for the two groups and tests the significance of the differences in means. On average, high labor intensity firms hold less cash, are smaller, have higher operating cash flows, lower cash flow volatility, lower leverage, and higher market-to-book ratios, and are more likely to pay dividends than low labor intensity firms. This comparison shows that the treatment and control groups are different in several aspects, which justifies controlling for firm characteristics in our difference-in-differences specification that intends to estimate the impact of the LC Law on corporate cash holdings.  \n\n## 5. Empirical analysis  \n\n### 5.1. Main results  \n\nTable 3 tabulates the main results of our regression analysis. All regressions control for firm and year fixed effects. The t statistics are reported under the coefficient estimates and are adjusted for heteroskedasticity and within-firm clustering. Column (1） includes only the interaction term $L C L a w\\times L a b o r$ Intensity as the explanatory variable, and column (2) adds the control variables described in the last section. The interaction term is positive and highly significant at the $1\\%$ level in both regressions, which is consistent with our hypothesis that employment protection increases the cash holdings of labor-intensive firms.  \n\nldvie 4 Summary statistics.

Column (3) uses the interaction LCLaw $\\times$ High Intensity to replace $L C L a w\\times L a b o r$ Intensity in the regression. The coefficient of the new interaction term is 0.021 and is significant at the $5\\%$ level.It has a straightforward interpretation as the treatment effect of the LC Law, suggesting that firms with high labor intensity increase their cash holdings (the cash to noncash assets ratio) by 2.1 percentage points on average relative to firms with low labor intensity after the enactment of the LC Law. This increase is not only statistically significant but is also economically meaningful; it amounts to $10\\%$ of the sample average, which is 0.208.  \n\nThe coefficient estimates of the control variables are broadly consistent with prior research using Chinese data (e.g., Chen et al., 2012). Firms hold less cash when they are larger, spend more on capital expenditures, or are under special treatment, while they hold more cash when they have higher cash flows, cash flow volatility, leverage, or market-to-book ratios, are newly listed, or are dividend payers.  \n\nColumn (4) investigates the dynamic effect of the LC Law by replacing $L C L a w\\times L a b o r$ Intensity with the interaction terms of Labor Intensity with five dummies, Before2, Beforel, Aftero, Afterl and  \n\nAfter2, where Beforei (Afteri) is equal to 1 for observations $j$ years before (after) the implementation of the LC Law.9  \n\nThis specification allows us to examine whether high labor intensity firms increase cash holdings relative to low labor intensity firms prior to the adoption of the LC Law. In the terminology of the difference-in-differences approach, it is a test for the “parallel trend\" assumption that underlies the validity of this approach. In particular, if it is the LC Law rather than other macroeconomic shocks prior to the LC Law that induces the incremental increase in the cash holdings of labor-intensive firms, we should observe significantly positive coefficients only for the interaction terms with theAfter dummyvariablesbut not for thosewith theBefore dummies.  \n\nColumn (4) shows that before the implementation of the LC Law, the coefficients of the two interaction terms with the Before dummies are close to zero and are statistically insignificant. This is supportive of the “parallel trend\" assumption. In contrast, the coefficients of the interaction terms with After°,Afterl and After2 are 0.007, 0.018 and 0.014, respectively, with the first one being closetothe $10\\%$ significance level $\\overset{\\v}{t}=1.61\\$ )and the other two being highly significant. The regression results generally confirm our hypothesis. Moreover, the coefficient estimates suggest that the effect of the LC Law is relatively small in the first year of the law's implementation and becomes stronger in later years. This is consistent with the argument that, due to the adjustment costs, laborintensive firms gradually increase their cash holdings to an optimal level following the LC Law's enactment. Another possible explanation isthatthe enforcementof theLCLawbecomesstricter over time as the local governments gradually implement the LC Law (which might involve a learning curve). It then follows that the impact of the LC Law increases in later years.  \n\nlavicJ Employment protection, labor intensity, and cash holdings.

(2009), who use U.s. data and find that employment protection provided by unionization leads to decreased cash holdings of affected firms. They interpret the negative relationship between unionization and cash holdings as evidence that firms in more unionized industries strategicallyhold less cash to shelter their income from labor unions' demands. However, as pointed out by Schmalz (2015),unionization can also exert a positive impact on corporate cash holdings through the “labor adjustment costs\" channel. The negative relationship between unionization and cash holdings does not negate the “labor adjust costs\" channel; it just implies that “collective bargaining power\" effect dominates the “labor adjustment costs\" effect and the latter is not easy to identify.  \n\nBy contrast,the LC Law of China does not provide a collective bargaining mechanism while offering more protections to workers. It implies that, with regard to the influence of the LC Law, there does not exist the “collective bargaining power\" effect that reduces corporate cash holdings, and the “labor adjustment costs\" effect dominates. This explains why employment protection provided by the LC Law increases corporate cash holdings and why our main finding is contrary to that of Klasa et al. (2009). The comparison reveals that, while they all aim to protect the rights of workers, different types of employment protection may work through various mechanisms and have diverse implications for firm policies. It also underscores the importance of analyzing institutional details before discussing the role of employment protection.  \n\n### 5.2. Identification tests  \n\nThe regression results of Table 3 are consistent with the main hypothesis that employment protection increases the cash holdings of labor-intensive firms by increasing labor adjustment costs. However, this is not the only explanation. The findings may also be driven by other shocks. In particular, our results may suffer from the omitted variables bias if (1) a contemporaneous shock is correlated with the enactment of the LC Law; (2) the shock has a positive impact on corporate cash holdings; and (3) such an effect is stronger for labor-intensive firms. We thus perform various analyses to address this concern and provide further support for our hypothesis.  \n\n#### 5.2.1. Other contemporaneous shocks  \n\nTime-varying industrial and regional shocks: All our regressions control for firm fixed effects, which automatically accommodate industry fixed effects. However, time-varying industrial and regional characteristics or shocks are not captured and may affect our results if they satisfy the three conditions mentioned above. To rule out this possibility, column (1) of Panel A, Table 4 includes industry-year fixed effects in our basic regression specification, where firms are classified into 22 industries according to the definition of China Securities Regulatory Commission; column (2) includes province-year fixed effects, where a firm's province is  \n\nTable4 Employment protection, labor intensity, and cash holdings: Other contemporaneous shocks  \n\nPanel A of this table controls for other contemporaneous shocks around the enactment of the LC Law. Column (1) includes Industry $\\times$ Year fixed effects, column (2) includes Province $\\times$ Year fixed effects, and column (3) includes both types of fixed effects. Column (4) includes the new interaction term Financial Crisis $\\times$ labor intensity, where financial crisis equals 1 for year 2008 and 0 otherwise.

In all three regressions, the interaction term $L C$ $L a w\\times L a b o r$ Intensity continues to be significantly positive, suggesting that time-varying industrial or regional characteristics cannot explain our main finding. However, it is still possible that a contemporaneous macroeconomic shock other than the enactment of the LC Law is the driving force of the results,so we consider two prominent macroeconomic shocks next.  \n\nGlobal financial crisis of 2008: When the LC Law was implemented in 2008, the global financial crisis triggered by the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis hit China's economy badly. Could it drive our results? We think it is unlikely. The crisis is a negative shock that dampens demand, which in turn reduces firm revenue and decreases cash holdings because they cannot save as much cash from cash flows as before the crisis. Given that the labor costs are quasifixed in the short run, the negative impact of the financial crisis on corporate cash holdings is likely to be more pronounced for laborintensive firms. That is, the financial crisis and the LC Law have opposite impacts on corporate cash holdings.  \n\nTo test the above conjecture, we directly control for the financial crisis in our regression analysis to ensure that it does not drive our results.We construct a dummy variable Financial Crisis that is equal to 1 for year 2008 and 0 otherwise. Column (4) of Panel A, Table 4 includes the interaction between Financial Crisis and Labor Intensity to control for the influence of the financial crisis on labor-intensive firms. Consistent with our conjecture that the two events have opposite effects on corporate cash holdings, the interactionterm $L C L a w\\times L a b o r$ Intensity continues to enter the regression positively and significantly, while Financial Crisis $\\times$ LaborIntensity is significantly negative. This confirms that our main finding is not due to the financial crisis.10  \n\nChina's stimulus plan: In response to the global financial crisis, the Chinese government announced a stimulus package in November 2008, which involved investment of a total of 4 trillion yuan (equivalent to 586 billion dollars) in infrastructure and social welfare from December 2008 to the end of 2010, mainly in the form of bank loans and government subsidies. If more funds were allocated to labor-intensive firms, what we have found may be driven by this stimulus plan. In other words, the LC Law dummy may be a proxy for the stimulus plan, and the interaction term just captures its heterogeneous effect across firms with high and low labor intensity.  \n\nTo differentiate this alternative explanation from our explanation based on increased employment protection, we expand the sample period up to 2013, construct a dummy Post Stimulus that is equal to 1 during 2011-2013 and 0 otherwise, and include the interaction between Post Stimulus and Labor Intensity in the regression. If the alternative explanation is true, the new interaction term should be negative or insignificant because the stimulus plan ended in 2010 and the monetary policy was tightened. On the other hand, it should be significantly positive if our hypothesis is true as the LC Law continues to be effective in 2011-2013. The regression results in column (5) of Panel A, Table 4 show that Post Stimulus $\\times$ Labor Intensity is significantly positive, which supports ourhypothesis.  \n\nTo provide further evidence that our results are not driven by the stimulus plan,Panel B of Table 4 directly examines the bank loans and government subsidies of our sample firms, through which the stimulus plan injected funds into the economy. Columns (1), (2),(3), and (4) of Panel B regress the interaction term LC $L a w\\times L a b o r$ Intensity on short-term loans, long-term loans, total loans and government subsidies, respectively, all scaled by total assets.11 The three regressions control for firm size, market-to-book ratio,operating cash flow, cashflow volatility, asset tangibility, and a dummy indicating whether the firm incurs a loss in the previous year. If the alternative explanation is true, we should observe that labor-intensive firms experience an increase in either loans or subsidies relative to other firms after 2008; that is, the coefficient of the interaction term should be positive in at least one regression. The results do not support this prediction; the coefficient of the interaction term is insignificant in all four regressions.12  \n\nThe above analysis suggests that our main finding is unlikely to have been driven by the 2007-2008 financial crisis or the government's stimulus. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that our results are attributed to other unobservable cotemporaneous shocks during 2008-2010. To reduce this concern, we further examine “treatment\" events prior to the enactment of the LC Law in Section 5.2.2 and conduct cross-sectional tests in Section 5.2.3.  \n\n#### 5.2.2. Prior treatments due to a change in the likelihood of enacting theLClaw  \n\nBefore the passage of the LC Law, Chinese legislators had organized discussions to solicit opinions from the public. Specifically, in 2003, it was announced that the LC Law would be included in future legislation plans. In 2005, the State Council passed a draft LC Law and submitted it to the Standing Law Committee of the National People's Congress for review.  \n\nThese two events raised firms' expectations about the likelihood of enacting the LC Law and hence the expected labor adjustment costs. Thus, they can be considered two additional “treatments\" on labor-intensive firms similar to the enactment of the LC Law. According to our main hypothesis, labor-intensive firms should also increase their cash holdings relative to their peers in response to the two events. If there is supportive evidence for this prediction, we can greatlymitigatethe concern that other shocks in 2o08- 2010 drive our main results.  \n\nThe above introduction suggests that the legislation process of the LC Law can be classified into three stages. The period of 2003- 2004 is the first stage (discussion stage), 2005-2007 is the second stage (review stage), and 2008 and after is the third stage (enactment stage). The likelihood of implementing the LC Law monotoni  \n\nThis table presents regressions that estimate the treatment effects of two events (the announcement of the legislation plan in 2003 and the submission of the LC Law draft for review in 2005） prior to the enactment of the LC Law. LC Law Discussion equals 1 in 2003-2004 and 0 otherwise; LC Law Review equals 1 in 2005-2007 and 0 otherwise. The other variables are defined in Table 1. Columns (1) and (2) examine the sample periods of 2000-2007 and 2000-2010, respectively. All regressions control for firm and year fixed effects.

Based on this classification, we construct two additional dummies to capture the two events prior to the enactment of the LC Law. The first dummy LC Law Discussion is equal to 1 for the period of 2003-2004 and 0 otherwise. The second dummy LC Law Review is equal to 1 for 2005-2007 and0otherwise.  \n\nTo identify the treatment effects of the two events on laborintensive firms, we choose the sample period of 2000-2007, which immediately precedes the implementation of the LC Law, and perform regression analysis using the same specification as in Column (2) of Table 3, except that Labor Intensity interacts with LC Law Discussion and LC Law Review.As shown in column(1) of Table 5,both interaction terms are significantly positive, suggesting that the two events also increase the cash holdings of labor-intensive firms. The results are similar to our previous findings, but the sample period is prior to 2008. This provides further support for our hypothesis and reduces the concern that our previous findings are due to contemporaneous shocks around the implementation of the LC Law.  \n\nColumn (2) of Table 5 includes LC Law $\\times$ LaborIntensityaswell as the two interaction terms in column (1） and uses the sample period of 2000-2010. The coefficients of all the interactions are significantly positive,indicating that the three events independently exert significant impacts on the cash holdings of laborintensive firms.  \n\nMore importantly, the regression results of column (2) allow us to test a prediction derived from the legislation process, which can provide additional evidence for our main hypothesis. Specifically, the likelihood of implementing the LC Law monotonically increases from 0 to 1 from the announcement of the legislation plan to the review of the draft and the subsequent enactment of the law, which implies that the expected change in labor adjustment costs also monotonically increases during this legislation process as compared to the period prior to the announcement of the legislation plan. If the increase in labor adjustment costs indeed leads to an increase in corporate cash holdings, as suggested by our hypothesis, we should observe the strongest treatment effect for the enactment of the LC Law and the weakest for the announcement of the legislation plan.We denote the coefficients of LC Law Discussion $\\times L a b o r$ Intensity,LCLawReview $\\times$ Labor Intensity,and LC $L a w\\times L a b o r$ Intensity as $\\beta_{1},\\beta_{2}$ , and $\\beta_{3}$ , respectively, and the above prediction implies that $\\beta_{3}>\\beta_{2}>\\beta_{1}>0$ 13 A formal $F$ test supports this prediction at the $5\\%$ significance level, which substantiates our main hypothesis.  \n\n#### 5.2.3. Cross-sectional tests  \n\nTo provide further evidence for our main hypothesis and rule out alternative mechanisms for our findings, we conduct crosssectional tests derived from our main hypothesis.  \n\nLaw enforcement: If the LC Law indeed increases cash holdings of labor-intensive firms by raising their labor adjustment costs, the effect should vary with the strictness of law enforcement, and we should observe a stronger effect in areas with stricter enforcement. To test this argument, we split our sample into two subsamples based on the legal environment index of Fan et al. (2011), which is an aggregate index that is averaged over a number of factors related to judicial quality, such as the number of lawyers as a percentage of the population, the efficiency of local courts, and protection of property rights, etc. Although it is not a direct measure for law enforcement, we believe that they are positively correlated. The index is constructed annually at the provincial level, and we use the 2o05 index to split our sample. Firms located in provinces with an index higher than the median level are classified as the high judicial quality group, whereas the rest are considered to be in the low judicial quality group.  \n\nColumns (1) and (2) of Table 6 report the regression results for the high and low judicial quality groups, respectively. The coefficient estimate of the interaction term is 0.017 and is highly significant in column (1), while it is 0.004 and statistically insignificant in column (2). This is consistent with our prediction that the impact of the LC Law on labor-intensive firms is stronger in areas with high judicial quality.  \n\nState ownership:The above analysis shows that labor-intensive firms in some regions are more affected by the LC Law because these regions enforce the law more strictly than other regions. Similarly, some firms are more compliant with the LC Law than others and should see a stronger impact. To test this conjecture, we use state ownership to proxy for a firm's compliance with the LC Law. Our previous discussion suggests that the LC Law increases labor adjustment costs, which incentivizes firms to take measures to circumvent it. State-owned enterprises (SOEs), however, are controlled by the government, and their management is directly monitored and evaluated by the government, so they are more compliant with the LC Law than non-SOEs in general. We thus split the sample into SOEs and non-SOEs and present the regression results in columns (3) and (4) of Table 6 for the two groups. The interaction term is significantly positive for the SOE subsample but not for the non-sOE subsample, which is consistent with the prediction derived from our main hypothesis.  \n\nMigrant workers: If our hypothesis is true, an immediate prediction is that, for a given level of employment, the effect should be stronger as the percentage of migrant workers or temporary workers increases because there is a larger increase in protection for migrant workers than formal employees after the enactment of the LC Law. It is ideal to test this prediction using firm-level data on migrant workers, but only industry-level data are available, unfortunately. We thus classify sample firms into two groups using the median of the industry's migrant worker ratio. Columns (5) and (6) of Table 6 report the regression results of the subsamples with high and low ratios of migrant workers, respectively. The interaction term is positive and highly significant in column (5), while it is insignificant in column (6). This is consistent with our prediction.  \n\nAll these cross-sectional tests are derived from our hypothesis that the LC Law increases the cash holdings of labor-intensive firms. Generally speaking, the results provide further support for this hypothesis and reduce the concern that our main findings are driven by alternative mechanisms.  \n\n#### 5.2.4. Operating leverage  \n\nWe have argued that one channel through which the LC Law increases corporate cash holdings is that the increase in labor adjustment costs leads to higher operating leverage, which raises the expected costs of financial distress. If we can find evidence for higher operating leverage after the enactment of the LC Law, our hypothesis would be substantiated. Following Serfling (2016), we use the elasticity of a firm's operating income with respect to its sales as a proxy for operating leverage and estimate the following specification:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{\\Delta\\mathrm{Ln}(E B I T_{i t})=b_{0}+b_{1}\\Delta\\mathrm{Ln}(S a l e s_{i t})+b_{2}L C L a w_{t}\\times}&{\\Delta\\mathrm{Ln}(S a l e s_{i t})}\\ {\\quad}&{\\quad+C o n t r o l s_{i t}+e_{i t},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nWhere $\\Delta\\mathrm{Ln}(E B I T)$ is the change of the logarithm of earnings before interest and taxes and $\\Delta\\mathrm{Ln}(S a l e s)$ is the change of log sales. Controls is a vector that includes firm size, market-to-book ratio, asset tangibility, and leverage. The coefficient $b_{1}$ measures the firm's operating leverage prior to the implementation of the LC Law, and $b_{2}$ captures the impact of the LC Law on operating leverage. If the aforementioned mechanism exists, $b_{2}$ should be greater than 0. This prediction is confirmed by the regression results presented in column (1) of Table 7; the coefficient estimate of the interaction term L $\\hat{\\textmd{c L a w}}\\times\\Delta L n(S a l e s)$ is significantly positive, suggesting that the LC Law indeed increases operating leverage.  \n\nThe change in operating leverage affects a firm's probability of becoming financially distressed and hence its cash holdings, but the impact is likely to depend on the level of operating leverage due to the potential nonlinearity between operating leverage and the probability of financial distress. Specifically, when a firm's operating leverage is at a low level, increasing it may only lead to a small change on the probability of financial distress. On the contrary, when it is at a high level, the same increase is likely to substantially raise the probability of financial distress. If this is true, the impact of the LC Law on corporate cash holdings should be larger for firms with higher operating leverage.  \n\nTo test this prediction, we classify firms into two subsamples based on their operating leverage in 2005, the beginning year of  \n\nTable6 Employment protection, labor intensity, and cash holdings: cross-sectional tests. This table presents subsample analyses that split the entire sample into subsamples based on variations in law enforcement across regions, law compliance across firms, and the fraction of migrant workers across industries. The dependent variable is cash holdings. Columns (1) and (2) examine subsamples with strong and weak legal enforcement, respectively. Columns (3) and (4) examine the subsamples of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and non-SOEs, respectively. Columns (5) and (6) examine the subsamples of industries with the migrant worker ratio above and below the industrial median, respectively. The variables are defined as in Table 1.

The high (low) operating leverage group consists of firms with operating leverage above (below) the sample median. As in Chen et al. (2011) and Mandelker and Rhee (1984), operating leverage is measured by the elasticity of a firm's sales with respect to EBIT, which is estimated using the 16 consecutive quarterly observations immediately preceding 2005.14 We then conduct cross-sectional tests as in Table 6 by separately estimating the impact of the LC Law on corporate cash holdings for each group. The regression results are presented in columns (2) and (3) of Table 7. The coefficient estimate of the interaction term LC $L a w\\times L a b o r$ Intensity is positive and significant for the high operating leverage group, while it is relatively small and insignificant for the low operating leverage group. These results are consistent with the prediction that the impact of the LC Law on corporate cash holdings is larger for firms with higher operating leverage.  \n\n### 5.3.Robustness checks  \n\nOur results are robust to alternative measures for cash holdings and labor intensity. In untabulated regressions, we use two alternative proxies for cash holdings: the natural logarithm of the cash ratio and the pure cash ratio that excludes marketable securities, and two alternative proxies for labor intensity: the ratio of the number of employees to total revenue and wage expenses normalized by total assets. Our results continue to hold.  \n\nTo make our sample firms more comparable, we keep only manufacturing firms and find similar results. Our results remain unchanged if we do not limit our sample to only firms with more than 50 employees or if we use a balanced panel and keep only firms that have observations in the whole sample period.  \n\n## 6. Conclusion  \n\nThe interaction of employment protection and corporate finance has received much attention recently. In this paper, we contribute to the literature by examining the relationship between employment protection and corporate cash holdings. Employment protection makes firing workers costlier, thus significantly increasing the expected costs of financial distress for labor-intensive firms. As a result, labor-intensive firms are likely to hold more cash as precautionary savings to reduce the likelihood of financial distress. That is, the cash holdings of labor-intensive firms are positively associated with employment protection.  \n\nTo test this theoretical prediction, we use the implementation of China's Labor Contract Law in 2008 to identify exogenous variation in employment protection in China. Using a difference-indifferences approach, we show that labor-intensive firms significantly increase their cash holdings after the enactment of the law, which is consistent with the hypothesis. Further analysis suggests that the effect varies across areas and firms: it mainly appears in areas with high judicial quality and in labor-intensive firms that are financially unconstrained.  \n\nOur findings shed new light on the determinants of cash holdings. Since the seminar work of Opler et al. (1999), the determinants of corporate cash holdings have been studied extensively. We complement the literature by showing that labor market regulations, especially employment protection, affect corporate cash reserves by increasing the adjustment costs of labor.It should be noted that labor market regulations are only one dimension of the institutional environment that surrounds firms. Other legal, political, economic, and social institutions may also influence firms' motives for hoarding cash through other mechanisms. It is promising for future research to analyze alternative mechanisms through which different institutions affect corporate cash holdings.  \n\nThis paper also deepens our understanding of the influence of labor market regulations. It suggests that employment protection not only affects the labor market but also exerts a significant impact on corporate financial policies. Thus, policy makers should also take this into account when evaluating the overall effects of labor market regulations.  \n\n## References  \n\nAcharya, V.V., Baghai, R.P, Subramanian, K.V., 2013.

The views expressed do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago or the Federal ReserveSystem.  \n\n# The Cross-Section of Labor Leverage and Equity Returns\\*  \n\nAndres Donangelot Francois Gourio\\* Matthias Kehrig\\* Miguel Palacios  \n\n## ABSTRACT  \n\nUsing a standard production model, we demonstrate theoretically that, even if labor is fully flexible, it generates a form of operating leverage if (a) wages are smoother than productivity and (b) the capital-labor elasticity of substitution is strictly less than one. Our model supports using labor share-the ratio of labor expenses to value added-as a proxy for labor leverage. We show evidence for conditions (a) and (b), and we demonstrate the economic significance of labor leverage: High labor-share firms have operating profits that are more sensitive to shocks, and they have higher expected asset returns.  \n\nLabor compensation is the largest expense for firms: Despite its documented secular decline, labor share still represents over $50\\%$ of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the United States.1 Magnitude, however, is not the only distinguishing property of labor compensation. For asset pricing, an arguably equally important property of labor compensation is its smoothness relative to firms' cash inflows. This smoothness leads to a labor-induced form of operating leverage (henceforth labor leverage), which amplifies firm risk in a way that is analogous to financial leverage. While financial leverage has been extensively studied, there has been less study on labor leverage, likely because a theoretically supported empirical proxy is lacking. This paper fills this gap and provides theoretical support and empirical validation for labor share (i.e., the ratio between labor expenses and the value added by a firm) as a new measure of firm-level labor leverage. Moreover, this paper presents new evidence for the economic significance of labor leverage in explaining cross-sectional differences in the riskiness of cash flows and asset returns.  \n\nWe first motivate the theoretical link between labor leverage, labor share, and the cross-section of stock returns in a simple setting. There are two sufficient conditions for the existence of the labor leverage mechanism: (a) Wages must be smoother than shocks to a firm's output (e.g., productivity or demand shocks), and (b) labor and capital must be strict complements in a firm's productive technology.? The data support these two conditions for the existence of labor leverage. Aggregate wages are less volatile than productivity, as is well known in the macroeconomics literature; however, we also document that labor costs are significantly less variable than other costs: For instance, in our sample, a $1.0\\%$ reduction in sales leads, on average, to a $0.6\\%$ reduction in staff (labor) expenses but also leads to a $1.2\\%$ reduction in all other costs. We also provide evidence that the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor is strictly lower than one, which is consistent with a large body of literature in economics.3 Specifically, we propose a novel, theoretically motivated procedure to estimate the elasticity of substitution and to obtain point estimates that range from 0.4 to 0.6, depending on the subsample of Compustat firms used.  \n\nWe construct two novel alternative firm-level measures of labor share using Compustat data. These two measures are closely related to the measure used in our model. We validate our two alternate measures of labor share by showing that these are in fact positively related to the sensitivity of operating profits to economic shocks. In particular, we show that the sensitivity of profits to real GDP and aggregate TFP shocks is positive for the average firm, and is cross-sectionally increasing in labor share. Consistent with the model, we also find that the sensitivity of profits to aggregate shocks to wages is negative for the average firm and increasing in magnitude in labor shares. However, this result is not significant at conventional levels.  \n\nAfter documenting the relation between labor share and operating leverage, we proceed to study the implications that our proposed mechanism holds for expected returns. Our theory predicts a positive relation between labor share and expected returns, as long as a firm's productivity has a greater systematic risk loading than its wage rate. An equivalent sufficient condition is the greater volatility and procyclicality of productivity with respect to wages. To address the challenge that expected returns are not directly observable in the data, we use two different types of proxies for expected returns: realized asset returns and systematic risk loadings (i.e., betas on risk factors). We find supporting evidence that expected asset returns are increasing in labor share. In particular, we find that high labor share firms earn, on average, higher realized asset returns, and we find that these firms have higher betas.  \n\nWe next show that a production model that nests our simple general setting is able to generate results that are not only qualitatively but also quantitatively consistent with what we observe in the data. We present such a model and calibrate it using standard moments for risky-asset returns, as well as novel moments presented in the empirical section such as the elasticity of substitution between labor and capital. This calibration delivers a set of results that closely match relevant moments found in the data, giving credence to our proposed mechanism. The success of the calibration of the model also supports the hypothesis that labor leverage is a first-order driver of cross-sectional variation of firms’ exposure to fundamental sources of risk and thus of crosssectional variation in expected returns.  \n\nThis paper considers the simplest set of conditions that would generate a positive labor leverage that varies across firms. However, it is important to note that many other mechanisms can generate similar results.4 We view alternative mechanisms as complementary, since multiple channels are likely present in reality. Regardless of the channel, previous literature has not empirically documented the relation between labor leverage and asset prices. The most significant contribution of our paper is the empirical evidence we provide for this relation.  \n\nThis paper contributes to the literature that studies the relation between operating leverage and stock returns.5 Within this literature, our paper is more closely related to the strand that discusses the relation between labor-induced forms of operating leverage and asset prices. Examples of this literature include Danthine and Donaldson (2002); Belo, Lin, and Bazdresch (2014); Donangelo (2014); Zhang (2014); and Favilukis and Lin (2016). Danthine and Donaldson (2002) discuss a mechanism in which countercyclical capital-to-labor share leads to labor-induced operating leverage in a general equilibrium setting. In their model, wages are less volatile than profits, due to the limited market participation of workers, and firms insure workers through labor contracts against labor risk. Stable wages act as an extra risk factor for shareholders, as markets are incomplete in their model. Donangelo (2014) proposes a model that establishes a positive connection between labor mobility and labor leverage. Labor intensity and labor mobility are two complementary mechanisms that affect a firm's operating leverage. In a cyclical industry, the effect of labor mobility on firm risk is increasing in labor share, and the effect of labor share on firm risk is increasing in labor mobility. Most recently, Zhang (2014) derives predictions similar to our model based on the optimal implicit contract between workers and firms. Overall, the key difference is that our model dynamics stems from simple “spot\" labor markets with realistic assumptions about labor demand and labor supply, while this literature focuses on “implicit contracts\"” and the ensuing insurance arrangements. We view these analyses as complementary, since both channels are likely present in reality.6  \n\n## 1 Theoretical Motivation  \n\nIn this section, we present and analyze the labor leverage mechanism, and demonstrate why the labor share is a valid proxy for labor leverage. In the interest of clarity, this section makes many simplifying assumptions and focuses on a two-period setting. The last section of the paper presents and estimates a dynamic model.  \n\nConsider a firm that produces value added $Y$ according to  \n\n$$\nY_{\\mathrm{t}}=X_{\\mathrm{t}}F[K_{\\mathrm{t}},L_{\\mathrm{t}}],\n$$  \n\nwhere $X$ denotes the firm's total factor productivity (TFP), $L$ denotes labor, $K$ denotes capital, and F represents an homogeneous function of degree 1.7 The firm takes the wage rate $W$ , which is set in an implicit perfect labor market. Capital adjustment costs are sufficiently high as to make it constant in the instant considered, $K_{\\mathrm{t}}=K$ . The firm's profit maximization problem at time t defines optimized operating profits $\\Pi$ as given by  \n\n$$\n\\Pi_{\\mathrm{t}}=\\operatorname*{max}_{L_{\\mathrm{t}}}\\{X_{\\mathrm{t}}F[K,L_{\\mathrm{t}}]-L_{\\mathrm{t}}W_{\\mathrm{t}}\\},\n$$  \n\nwhere $W$ denotes the market wage, which is possibly correlated with the firm's TFP. We define labor leverage as the (rescaled) ratio of the elasticity of operating profit to productivity and the elasticity of value added to productivity.8 Formally,  \n\nProposition 1 (Labor Leverage) For a constant-returns-to-scale production function, labor leverage is given by  \n\n$$\n\\ell\\equiv\\frac{d\\Delta\\pi_{\\mathrm{t}}/d\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{t}}}{d\\Delta y_{\\mathrm{t}}/d\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{t}}}-1=\\frac{(1-\\gamma)\\frac{S_{\\mathrm{t}}}{1-S_{\\mathrm{t}}}\\left(1-\\frac{\\partial\\Delta w_{\\mathrm{t}}}{\\partial\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{t}}}\\right)}{1+\\gamma\\frac{S_{\\mathrm{t}}}{1-S_{\\mathrm{t}}}\\left(1-\\frac{\\partial\\Delta w_{\\mathrm{t}}}{\\partial\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{t}}}\\right)},\n$$  \n\n7That is,the production technology has the constant-returns-to-scale property. Also, note that we refer throughout thepaperto $X$ as TFP for simplicity, but it may actually also capture shifts in the demand for the product.  \n\n8The intuition behind this definition is that labor leverage captures the extent to which productivity or demand shocks are transformed into operating income shocks. Note that the definition of labor leverage in this setting is analogous to the definition of the broader operating leverage (e.g., see Garcia-Feijoo and Jorgensen (2010). The reason is that, in our setting, only labor leads to operating leverage. In the Appendix we briefly discuss the case in which the firm is also subject to fixed operating costs to illustrate how the definition of labor leverage is nested within the broader definition of operating leverage.  \n\nWhere Y = FKuLjFkL[(Ki,L] is the elasticity of substitution between labor and capital, $\\begin{array}{r}{S\\equiv\\frac{L W}{Y}}\\end{array}$ is labor share, and iower-case variables are expressed in logs (e.g. $\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{t}}\\equiv\\log[X_{\\mathrm{t}}/X_{\\mathrm{t-1}}])$ 9.  \n\nProposition (1) shows that labor leverage is a function of the firm's labor share, the elasticity of substitution of capital and labor, and the response of wages to productivity changes. In particular, note that if wages respond one-fo-one with productivity (i.e, $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{\\partial\\Delta w_{\\mathrm{t}}}{\\partial\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{t}}}=1\\mathrm{|}}\\end{array}$ ), then all firms have zero labor leverage. Hence, smooth wages are a necessary condition for labor leverage to exist.  \n\nThe following assumptions are necessary and sufficient for the existence of strictly positive labor leverage in our setting:  \n\nAssumption 1 (Smoothness of Wages and Strict Complementarity of Labor and Capital) a. Wages are smooth relative to productivity: $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{\\partial\\Delta w_{\\mathrm{t}}}{\\partial\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{t}}}<1}\\end{array}$ b. The elasticity of substitution between labor and capital is less than one: $\\upgamma<1$  \n\nIt is common to assume a Cobb-Douglas production function, $F(K,L)=K^{\\alpha}L^{1-\\alpha}$ . In this case, labor share is constant, profits are a constant share of output, $\\Pi=(1-\\alpha)Y$ ; hence the elasticity of profit equals the elasticity of value added, so that labor leverage $\\ell=0$ . However, as the next proposition shows, this case turns out to be knife-edged (and, as we will argue later, not empirically relevant).  \n\nThe proposition that follows shows that Assumption 1 represents a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the validity of labor share as its proxy.  \n\nProposition 2 (Labor Leverage and Labor Share) Assumption 1 implies:  \n\na. The existence of labor-induced operating leverage: $\\frac{\\partial\\Delta\\pi_{\\mathrm{\\ell}}/\\partial\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{\\ell}}}{\\partial\\Delta y_{\\mathrm{\\ell}}/\\partial\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{\\ell}}}>1$ b. Labor-induced operating leverage increasing in labor share: $\\frac{\\partial\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\Delta\\pi_{\\cdot}/\\partial\\Delta x_{\\cdot}}{\\partial\\Delta y_{\\cdot}/\\partial\\Delta x_{\\cdot}}\\right)}{\\partial S_{\\mathrm{t}}}>0$  \n\nThe corollary below shows how the capital-labor elasticity of substitution is related to the elasticities of value added growth and operating profit growth to shocks.  \n\nCorollary 1 (Useful Relation Involving Capital-Labor Elasticity of Substitution) The elasticities of value added growth and operating profits growth to shocks are linearly related through the elasticity of substitution between labor and capital, as given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\partial\\Delta y_{\\iota}/\\partial\\Delta x_{\\iota}-1=\\gamma(\\partial\\Delta\\pi_{\\iota}/\\partial\\Delta x_{\\iota}-1).}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nWe will later use the relation formalized in Corollary 1 to estimate the elasticity of substitution between labor and capital in the data.  \n\nSo far, the discussion shows that labor leverage makes operating profits relatively more sensitive to shocks. In order for labor leverage to also lead to higher expected returns, we should consider the relative systematic risk exposure of TFP $X$ and wages $W$ . For simplicity, here we make the additional simplifying assumptions that there are only two periods and that the economy has a single source of priced risk.10 Let $M$ denote the value of an asset that is only exposed to priced risk and that has a risk loading $\\upbeta^{\\mathrm{M}}=1$ Let $\\begin{array}{r}{\\upbeta_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{X}}\\equiv\\frac{\\partial\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{t}}}{\\partial\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{t}}}}\\end{array}$ and $\\begin{array}{r}{\\beta_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{w}}\\equiv\\frac{\\partial\\Delta w_{\\mathrm{t}}}{\\partial\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{t}}}}\\end{array}$ denote the systematic risk loadings of portfolios of securities that perfectly replicate TFP growth and wage growth.  \n\nAssumption 2 (Positive and high systematic risk loading of TFP relative to wages) $\\upbeta_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{X}}>0$ and $\\mathsf{B}_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{X}}>\\mathsf{B}_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{W}}$  \n\nThe proposition below shows that Assumption 2 implies that asset betas are increasing in labor share.  \n\nProposition 3 (Systematic Risk Exposure and Labor Share)  \n\na. Cash fow beta: $\\begin{array}{r}{\\beta_{\\mathrm{t}}\\equiv\\frac{\\partial\\Delta\\pi_{\\mathrm{t}}}{\\partial\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{t}}}\\frac{\\partial\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{t}}}{\\partial\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{t}}}+\\frac{\\partial\\Delta\\pi_{\\mathrm{t}}}{\\partial\\Delta w_{\\mathrm{t}}}\\frac{\\partial\\Delta w_{\\mathrm{t}}}{\\partial\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{t}}}=\\beta_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{x}}+\\frac{S_{\\mathrm{t}}}{1-S_{\\mathrm{t}}}(\\beta_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{x}}-\\beta_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{w}}).}\\end{array}$ b. Assmption2 impliesthat $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{\\partial\\beta_{\\mathrm{t}}}{\\partial S_{\\mathrm{t}}}>0}\\end{array}$  \n\n## 2 Empirical Evidence  \n\nWe first summarize our testable hypothesis. We then discuss how we construct the labor share variable. Next, we present evidence for the smoothness of labor costs, the strict complementarity between labor and capital, and for the sensitivity of profits to aggregate shocks as increasing in labor share. At the end of this section, we explore the cross-sectional relation between labor share and expected returns.  \n\n### 2.1 Testable Hypothesis  \n\nThis section presents empirical support for main testable implications of the theoretical discussion from the previous section: (1) Firms with high labor share exhibit higher sensitivity of cash flows to aggregate shocks (Proposition (2), and (2) firms with high labor shares have higher expected returns (Proposition (3)).  \n\n### 2.2 Data  \n\nOur main empirical measure of labor share (hereafter LS) is given by the ratio of labor costs to value added. It is defined from Compustat items as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{LS}_{i t}\\equiv\\frac{\\mathrm{XLR}_{i t}}{\\mathrm{OIBDP}_{i t}+\\mathrm{XLR}_{i t}+\\mathrm{\\DeltaAINVFG}_{i t-1,t}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $X L R$ is the Compustat variable “Staff Expense - Total' (which we use as a proxy for labor costs), OIBDP is the Compustat variable “Operating Income Before Depreciation,’ and $\\Delta\\mathrm{INVFG}_{t-1,t}\\equiv\\mathrm{INVFG}_{\\mathrm{t}}-\\mathrm{INVFG}_{t-1}$ is the change in the Compustat variable “Inventories -Finished Goods. We include the change in inventories of final goods to make the empirical measure consistent with the theoretical one. The reason is that, unlike in our model, some of the goods produced over a given year are not sold during that year and, likewise, a portion of the goods sold by the firm in a given year were produced in previous years.11  \n\nA limitation of the LS measure is that, since the variable XLR is a supplementary income statement item, it is only available for roughly $12\\%$ of firm-year observations in our sample. To address this limitation, we use a second measure, which we denote as “extended\" labor share (hereafter ELS). We define ELS as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathrm{ELS}_{i t}\\equiv\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{\\mathrm{LS}_{i t}}&{\\mathrm{if}X L R\\mathrm{is~non-missing}}\\ {\\frac{\\mathrm{LABEX}_{i t}}{\\mathrm{OIBDP}_{i t}+\\mathrm{LABEX}_{i t}+\\mathrm{AINVFG}_{i t-1,t}}}&{\\mathrm{if}X L R\\mathrm{is~missing},}\\end{array}\\right.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere LABEX is a constructed variable defined as the product of the Compustat variable EMP (\"Number of Employees\") and the average annual labor compensation per employee in the industry during that year. We estimate the average labor compensation per employee as the average ratio of  \n\nXLR and EMP in the industry, calculated using the firms that do report XLR.12 We exclude from our sample firm-year observations where ELS is negative or greater than one.  \n\nTable 1 reports time-series averages of median characteristics for portfolios of firms sorted on LS (Panel A) and ELS (Panel B). We present the statistics both for simple sorts and for withinindustry sorts. (This is motivated by the evidence in Novy-Marx (2011) that intra- as opposed to inter-industry differences in book-to-market ratios are more closely related to cross-sectional variation in operating leverage intensity.) By construction, the second and third columns of Panel A are identical, since ELS is defined as LS in the subsample of firms where the latter is extant. More telling is the fact that the second and third columns of Panel B are quite similar as well. We interpret this fact as evidence that the distribution of ELS conditional on missing LS is not significantly different from the distribution of ELS conditional on non-missing LS. The fourth column reports that the number of employees per unit of plant, property, and equipment (PPE) (which represents an additional measure of labor intensity used in the literature) is increasing in both LS and ELS.  \n\nColumns 5 to 11 of the two panels show how firm characteristics vary across labor market quintiles. High labor share firms tend to have higher book-to-market ratios than low labor share firms, particularly in industry-adjusted sorts. Table 1 also shows a negative relation between labor share and both the market value of equity and the book value of assets. The negative trend in the market value of equity is consistent with the hypothesized greater riskiness of high labor share firms. A possible explanation for the negative trend in asset values is a downward bias in asset value reporting, in particular since high labor share firms are both less capital intensive and have less tangible assets.13 Consistent with a reporting bias, the panels report that the value of organizational capital, which is not considered in a firm's financial reports, is increasing in labor share. Profitability ratios and (to some extent) financial leverage ratios seem fairly unrelated to labor share. All these patterns are qualitatively similar across our two measures of labor share.  \n\n# << Table 1 here >>  \n\n### 2.3 Evidence for the Labor Leverage Mechanism  \n\nIn this section, we present empirical support for the existence of the labor leverage mechanism. We start by verifying the two sufficient conditions discussed in the theoretical motivation section. The first condition, which is sufficient for the existence of the labor leverage mechanism, is for wages to be smoother and less procyclical than productivity. We also investigate the smoothness of total labor costs, which is an implication of the model. The second condition is that labor share is countercyclical, or equivalently, that the capital-labor elasticity of substitution is less than one. The two conditions combined guarantee that labor leverage amplifies expected equity returns.  \n\n#### 2.3.1 Evidence for Labor Cost Smoothness  \n\nTable 2 gives some statistics that support the hypothesis that wages are smoother and less procyclical than output, profits, and TFP. The table shows that the volatility of the growth rate of before-tax profits is 3.54 times the volatility of the growth rate of GDP, and the slope coefficient in a regression of profit growth on GDP growth, used as a proxy for procyclicality, is 2.22. On the other hand, the volatility of real wage growth is 0.51 times that of GDP growth, thus significantly smoother than profits. Moreover, the slope coefficient of wages on GDP growth is 0.14, which supports the assumption that wages are less procyclical than profits. TFP is slightly more volatile (volatility 0.57 times that of GDP growth) and significantly more procyclical (slope coefficient of TFP growth on GDP growth is 0.49) than wages.14  \n\nNext, we investigate the elasticity of total labor costs to changes in sales directly. The advantage of analyzing labor costs is that we can conduct the analysis at the firm level. Table 3 shows that, for each dollar change in sales, staff expenses change $9\\phi$ while all other operating costs (i.e., the sum of costs of goods sold and sales, general, and administrative expenses minus staff expenses) change $72\\phi$ . The table also shows that for each percentage point change in sales, staff expenses changeby $0.43\\%$ , which is half of the change in all operating expenses $(1.07\\%)$ and a third of that of non-labor operating expenses $(1.46\\%)$ . These findings support the hypothesis that labor costs are relatively inelastic, which is consistent with the existence of the labor leverage mechanism.  \n\n#### 2.3.2 Evidence for the Countercyclicality of Firm-Level Labor Share  \n\nThe previous section shows that labor costs are relatively smoother than output and other types of costs. This section takes a step forward and investigates a direct implication of this finding, which is the countercyclicality of firm-level labor share. In order to establish the cyclicality of labor share, we run the following panel data regressions with firm-fixed effects:  \n\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{i,t}}^{\\mathrm{g}}=\\mathsf{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{0,i}}+\\mathsf{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{1}}x_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{g}}+\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{i,t}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $S^{\\mathrm{g}}$ is the annual percentage growth in the measure of labor share under consideration (LS or ELS) and $x^{\\mathrm{g}}$ is the percentage growth in our business cycle proxy (GDP growth, TFP growth, or market returns).  \n\nTable 4 documents the estimates from regression (6) in our samples of firms with non-missing LS and non-missing ELS. The table shows that our two measures of labor share are in fact timevarying and countercyclical. This result is consistent with the previous finding that wages are smooth and that the capital-labor elasticity of substitution is less than one, since in that case labor share and productivity are negatively related. Moreover, this result indicates that labor leverage is countercyclical and thus potentially significant for asset pricing. But, before investigating the relation between labor share and expected returns, we investigate the hypothesis that labor and capital are strictly complements, which could at least partially explain the relative smoothness of laborcosts.  \n\n#### 2.3.3 Evidence for Strict Complementarity Between Labor and Capital  \n\nRecall from our theoretical motivation section that smoothness of wages alone does not guarantee smoothness of labor costs, thus the existence of the labor leverage mechanism proposed in this paper.15 Proposition (2) shows that, in a frictionless setting with relatively smooth wages and a perfectly elastic and homogeneous labor supply, labor share is countercyclical and labor costs are smoother than output, but only if capital and labor are strict complements. Before proceeding, we should note that, while our theoretical motivation is based on perfect and homogeneous labor markets, a strict complementarity between labor and capital should make labor and capital smoother even without this assumption. Also, please note that in our theoretical motivation, the strict complementarity between labor and capital does not rule out that labor market imperfections or heterogeneity also explain the labor leverage mechanism.  \n\nTo estimate the capital-labor elasticity of substitution of firms in our sample, we use the theoretically motivated relation formalized in Corollary (1). In particular, we first estimate the elasticity of value added to aggregate shocks, and the elasticity of operating profit growth to aggregate shocks. We use three proxies for aggregate shocks (i.e., sources of risk that affect the firm): GDP growth, TFP growth, and aggregate market returns. Specifically, we run the time-series regressions given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{p r o f_{\\mathrm{i,t}}^{\\mathrm{g}}=\\upbeta_{\\mathrm{0,i}}^{\\mathrm{II}}+\\upbeta_{\\mathrm{1,i}}^{\\mathrm{II}}x_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{g}}+\\upvarepsilon_{\\mathrm{i,t}}^{\\mathrm{II}},\\quad\\mathrm{and}}\\ &{\\nu a d d_{\\mathrm{i,t}}^{\\mathrm{g}}=\\upbeta_{\\mathrm{0,i}}^{\\mathrm{Y}}+\\upbeta_{\\mathrm{1,i}}^{\\mathrm{Y}}x_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{g}}+\\upvarepsilon_{\\mathrm{i,t}}^{\\mathrm{Y}},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $x$ is the aggregate shock (GDP growth, TFP growth, or market returns), prof is percentage growth of operating profit before interest and depreciation, and vadd is percentage growth in value added. The use of percentage growth for operating profit restricts the sample to positive observations. We define value added (using the denominators of LS and ELS from (4) and (5)) to be consistent with the proxy for labor share that we use. Note that $\\upbeta_{1}^{\\Pi}$ and $\\upbeta_{1}^{\\mathrm{Y}}$ from regressions (7a) and (7b) are conceptually similar to $\\partial\\Delta\\pi/\\partial\\Delta x$ and $\\partial\\Delta y/\\partial\\Delta x$ from the theoretical section. This fact allows us to use the result from Corollary (1) to estimate the effective capital-labor elasticity of substitution from the data in the cross-sectional second pass:  \n\n$$\n(\\hat{\\mathsf{B}}_{\\mathrm{1,i}}^{\\mathrm{Pi}}-1)=\\gamma_{0}+\\gamma(\\hat{\\mathsf{B}}_{\\mathrm{1,i}}^{\\mathrm{Y}}-1)+\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{i}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\hat{\\upbeta}_{1,\\mathrm{i}}^{\\Pi}$ and $\\hat{\\upbeta}_{1,\\mathrm{i}}^{\\mathrm{Y}}$ are the estimated slopes from (7a) and $(7\\mathfrak{b})$  \n\nTable 5 shows the results of the two passes described below. The table shows results for the subsample of non-missing XLR-based value added (Panel A) and the non-missing LABEX-based value added (Panel B). We find that, across the two panels and across the three different proxies for aggregate shock, the estimated effective capital-labor elasticity of substitution ranges from 0.40 to 0.57. This result is consistent with the existing literature and with our hypothesis that labor and capital are strictly complements, which at least partially explains the observed smoothness of labor costs and thus the existence of the labor leverage mechanism.  \n\n#### 2.3.4 Sensitivity of Profits to Macroeconomic Shocks  \n\nSo far, we have presented evidence that supports labor share as a proxy for labor leverage. In this section, we take a step further and present evidence that operating profits of high labor share firms are exposed to a higher level of operating leverage. A telltale sign that a firm has a high level of operating leverage (labor induced or otherwise) is a high sensitivity of operating profits (before interest and depreciation) to exogenous shocks. To investigate whether labor share is positively related to the sensitivity of operating profits to shocks, we use three proxies for aggregate sources of shocks that are exogenous to individual firms: GDP growth, TFP growth, and aggregate market returns. Our hypothesis, which is formalized in Proposition (2), is that the sensitivity of profits to such shocks is increasing in labor share. To test this hypothesis we run the following panel data regressions with firm-fixed effects and interaction terms:  \n\n$$\np r o f_{\\mathrm{i,t}}^{\\mathrm{g}}=\\upbeta_{\\mathrm{0,i}}+\\upbeta_{\\mathrm{1}}x_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{g}}+\\upbeta_{\\mathrm{2}}x_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{g}}\\times S_{\\mathrm{i,t}}+\\upbeta_{\\mathrm{3}}S_{\\mathrm{i,t}}+\\upvarepsilon_{\\mathrm{i,t}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $x$ is the aggregate shock (GDP growth, TFP growth, or market returns), profs is percentage growth of operating profit before interest and depreciation, and $S$ is the proxy of labor share under consideration, LS or ELS.  \n\nTable 6 shows the results, which are generally consistent with the hypothesis. The positive exposure of profits to aggregate shocks is positive and increasing in magnitude in labor share. This  \n\nfinding suggests that the operating profits of labor intensive firms are more sensitive to aggregate shocks, and it further supports the economic significance of the labor-induced operating leverage mechanism and also the validity of labor share as its proxy.  \n\n### 2.4 Expected Asset Returns  \n\nOur theoretical model predicts that, under relatively mild assumptions, expected returns should be increasing in labor share. In this section, we investigate this prediction and explore the empirical relation between labor share and expected returns. To address the challenge that expected returns are not observable, we use two different types of proxies for them: realized stock returns and stock return loadings on risk factors (i.e., betas).  \n\n#### 2.4.1 Realized Asset Returns  \n\nTable 7 presents average post-ranking annual excess equity returns of quintile-portfolios of firms sorted on LS, and ELS, as well as a zero-investment portfolio (H-L portfolio). H-L is a yearly rebalanced portfolio that is long stocks in the highest LS or ELS quintile and short stocks in the lowest LS or ELS quintile. The H-L portfolio earns excess returns of between $4.82\\%$ and $4.06\\%$ per year for LS-sorted portfolios and $3.29\\%$ and $3.25\\%$ per year for ELS-sorted portfolios. Ttests using Newey-West standard errors with four lags confirm that the LS-premium is statistically different from zero, although the ELS-premia is not statistically significant at conventional levels.  \n\nTable 8 provides additional supporting evidence for this finding. The panel reports results of panel data regressions of annual returns on lagged values of LS and ELS. All independent variables are standardized so that they have a mean of O and a standard deviation of 1 in the sample. This standardization allows for a more direct comparison of the slopes across specifications. A one standard deviation cross-sectional increase in LS and ELS leads to a cross-sectional increase in annual returns of $1.10\\%$ and $0.69\\%$ , respectively, after controlling for financial leverage and the size of the asset base. We do not control for book-to-market ratio and market value, since, as we show in the model, these variables subsume the effect of operating leverage on expected returns.  \n\nTaken together, these results support the economic significance of the relation between labor share and expected asset returns.  \n\n#### 2.4.2 Risk Factor Loadings  \n\nUnder a rational expectation and full information setting, realized asset returns are an unbiased, albeit noisy, proxy for unobservable expected asset returns.16 In this section, we use loadings on traditional risk factors (i.e., risk factor betas) as an alternative proxy for expected asset returns. Note, however, that the use of empirical estimates of risk factor betas as proxies for expected returns does not imply that this paper takes a stand on whether the empirical implementations of the CAPM or other traditional asset pricing models are well specified. In fact, our model is agnostic in regard to the source of systematic risk in the economy, which is represented by $d Z^{\\Lambda}$ fromEquation (10). The only additional required assumption in this section is that the empirical risk factors are merely correlated to the true source(s) of risk in the economy. Under this assumption, empirical estimates of risk factor betas will be positively related to expected asset returns. And in that case, the hypothesis that expected returns are increasing in labor share is equivalent to the hypothesis that systematic risk loadings are increasing in labor share.  \n\nTable 9 reports the average conditional betas constructed as in Lewellen and Nagel (2006) for portfolios of firms sorted on both measures of labor shares. The table shows betas with respect to the market portfolio (MKT) as well as the SMB (small minus big) and HML (high minus low) risk factors related to size and value from Fama and French (1993). The table also includes betas with respect to the real macro variables described in Table 2 (e.g., GDP, TFP, and wage growth rates).  \n\nPanels A and B of the table show that average MKT, SMB, HML, GDP, and TFP betas are increasing in magnitude across the LS- and ELS-based portfolios, respectively. This finding is consistent with the existence of the labor-induced operating leverage mechanism that amplifies a firm's exposure to aggregate shocks. The difference in the average wage growth beta between the highest and lowest labor share quintiles is positive but not statistically significant. The fact that HML betas are negative and increasing in magnitude across the LS-based (although not ELSbased) portfolios is also consistent with the proposed mechanism, since it implies that loadings on -HML are positive and increasing. In fact, Kogan and Papanikolaou (2014) suggest that -HML is a risk factor that is related to investment-specific (IST) shocks and thus carries a negative price of risk.17  \n\n## 3 Model  \n\nThe results from the previous section uncover an empirical link between a firm's labor share and its expected return. We now rationalize those results by replicating them via a structural partial equilibrium model. The model is a specific application of the more general framework presented in Section 1. Some additional structure allows us to estimate moments for quantities and prices and compare them to the empirical results from Section 2. We show that this simple model can explain the main findings presented in Section 2, further highlighting the role of labor leverage in firms? cash flow dynamics and, consequently, in their expected returns.  \n\n### 3.1 Setup  \n\nWe take the stochastic discount factor (SDF) as exogenous. The dynamics of the SDF, which wedenoteby $\\Lambda$ ,are given by  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{t}}}{\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{t}}}=-r d t-\\eta d Z_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\Lambda},\n$$  \n\nwhere $r>0$ is the instantaneous risk-free rate, $d Z^{\\Lambda}$ is a Wiener process that represents the single source of systematic risk in the economy, and $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{n}}$ represents the aggregate price of risk.  \n\nWe assume perfect competition, so that the firm takes as given both its output price and the real wage it must pay its employees. The dynamics of the real wage $W$ are givenby  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d W_{\\mathrm{t}}}{W_{\\mathrm{t}}}=\\mu_{\\mathrm{w}}d t+\\sigma_{\\mathrm{w}}\\uprho_{\\mathrm{w}}d Z_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\Lambda}+\\sigma_{\\mathrm{w}}\\sqrt{1-\\uprho_{\\mathrm{w}}^{2}}d Z_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{w}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $d Z^{\\mathrm{W}}$ is a Wiener process orthogonal to $d Z^{\\Lambda}$ (i.e., $\\mathrm{E}[d Z^{\\mathrm{w}}d Z^{\\Lambda}]{=}0;$ $\\mu_{\\mathrm{W}}$ and $\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{w}}$ are the drift and volatility of the wage growth process, respectively; and $\\uprho_{\\mathrm{W}}$ is the priced portion of the wage growth risk.  \n\nThe firm's productive technology is represented by a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function. Value added is given by  \n\n$$\nY_{\\mathrm{t}}=X_{\\mathrm{t}}\\left(\\propto L_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{p}}+\\left(1-\\upalpha\\right)K^{\\mathrm{p}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{p}}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $L$ and $K$ denote the labor and capital employed in production, $\\upalpha\\in(0,1)$ captures the relative importance of labor in total production, $X$ denotes the level of total factor productivity (TFP), and the parameter $\\uprho$ detemin lasttyofsubstbewcaia alb $\\begin{array}{r}{\\gamma\\equiv\\frac{1}{1-\\uprho}}\\end{array}$ The limit $\\uprho\\rightarrow-\\infty$ represents the case in which capital and labor are perfect complements, while the other extreme case, $\\uprho=1$ , represents the case in which capital and labor are perfect substitutes. The case in which $\\uprho\\rightarrow0$ represents the Cobb-Douglas production function. We focus on the empirically relevant case in which labor and capital are strictly complements $(\\uprho<0)$ .18 To focus on the implications of the labor share for firm risk, we abstract away from investment and depreciation so that capital $K$ is fixed.  \n\nIt is convenient to further decompose the firm's TFP $X$ into two components: aggregate TFP $(X^{\\mathrm{A}})$ and the idiosyncratic component of TFP $(X^{\\mathrm{I}})$ , such that $X=X^{\\operatorname{A}}X^{\\operatorname{I}}$ . Aggregate TFP $X^{\\mathrm{A}}$ follows the diffusion process  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d X_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{A}}}{X_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{A}}}=\\mu_{\\mathrm{X}}d t+\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{X}}\\uprho_{\\mathrm{X}}d Z_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\Lambda},\n$$  \n\nwhile the idiosyncratic component of TFP $X^{\\mathrm{I}}$ follows the diffusion process  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d X_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{I}}}{X_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{I}}}=\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{X}}\\sqrt{1-\\uprho_{\\mathrm{X}}^{2}}d Z_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{X}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $d Z^{\\mathrm{X}}$ is orthogonal to both $d Z^{\\Lambda}$ and $d Z^{\\mathrm{W}}$ (i.e., $\\mathrm{E}[d Z^{\\mathrm{X}}d Z^{\\Lambda}]{=}0$ and $\\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname{E}[d Z^{\\mathrm{X}}d Z^{\\mathrm{W}}]=0,}\\end{array}$  \n\nIn addition to idiosyncratic TFP shocks, each firm faces a risk of death, in which the produc. tivity and value of the firm both fall to zero.19 Firm death is modeled as a Poisson event with mean arrival rate $\\uplambda$  \n\nProfit maximization drives the firm to set its labor demand $L^{\\mathrm{D}}$ such that the marginal profitability of labor $\\bigl({\\frac{d Y}{d L}}\\bigr)$ is equated to the real wage (W). Labor demand $L^{\\mathrm{D}}$ is given by:  \n\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{p}}=(1-\\upalpha)^{1/\\uprho}\\left(\\left(\\frac{W_{\\mathrm{t}}}{\\upalpha X_{\\mathrm{t}}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\uprho}{1-\\uprho}}-\\upalpha\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{\\uprho}}.\n$$  \n\nEquation (15) implies that, consistent with intuition, the firm will demand more labor when its productivity is high relative to the real wage. In what follows, we always assume that the firm sets labor optimally.  \n\nWedefine labor share $S$ as the ratio of labor costs to value added, $S\\equiv{\\frac{L^{\\mathrm{D}}W}{Y}}$ Intuitively, labor share is a measure of how value added is split between workers and the firm (capital) owners. Using Ito's Lemma we find the dynamics of $S$  \n\nwhere:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{\\displaystyle\\frac{d S_{\\mathrm{t}}}{S_{\\mathrm{t}}}=\\mu_{\\mathrm{s}}d t+\\Phi_{\\mathrm{s}\\mathrm{A}}d Z_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{A}}+\\Phi_{\\mathrm{sw}}d Z_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{w}}+\\Phi_{\\mathrm{sc}}d Z_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{X}},}}\\ {{\\displaystyle\\mu_{\\mathrm{s}}~\\equiv-\\left(\\frac{\\Theta}{\\Theta-1}\\right)\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{a}}-\\mu_{\\mathrm{w}}-\\Theta_{\\mathrm{s}}^{2}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{\\Theta}{\\Theta-1}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\Theta_{\\mathrm{x}}^{2}}{2\\Theta}-\\Theta_{\\mathrm{w}}\\rho_{\\mathrm{x}}\\Phi_{\\mathrm{w}}\\Phi_{\\mathrm{x}}+\\frac{\\Theta_{\\mathrm{w}}^{2}}{2\\Theta}\\right)},}}\\ {{\\displaystyle\\Phi_{\\mathrm{sa}}~\\equiv-\\left(\\frac{\\Theta}{\\Theta-1}\\right)\\left(\\rho_{\\mathrm{x}}\\sigma_{\\mathrm{x}}-\\rho_{\\mathrm{w}}\\sigma_{\\mathrm{w}}\\right),}}\\ {{\\displaystyle\\sigma_{\\mathrm{sw}}~\\equiv~\\left(\\frac{\\Theta}{\\Theta-1}\\right)\\circ_{\\mathrm{w}}\\sqrt{1-\\Theta_{\\mathrm{w}}^{2}}},~\\mathrm{and}}}\\ {{\\displaystyle\\sigma_{\\mathrm{sx}}~\\equiv-\\left(\\frac{\\Theta}{\\Theta-1}\\right)\\sigma_{\\mathrm{x}}\\sqrt{1-\\Theta_{\\mathrm{x}}^{2}}.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nEquation (16) implies that labor share is affected differently by shocks to wages and shocks to productivity. In the empirically relevant case in which labor and capital are strictly complements $(\\uprho<0)$ ,labor share $S$ is decreasing in idiosyncratic productivity (i.e., $\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{{SX}}}<0$ ).20 Equation (16) also shows that, despite the fact that labor demand decreases with wages, the labor share $S$ is increasing in wages (i.e., $\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{sw}}>0$ because the price effect dominates the quantity effect. Figure 1 illustrates the negative relationship between labor share and idiosyncratic productivity and shows the positive relationship between labor share and wages.21 Finally, the effect of aggregate productivity (i.e., the priced shock $\\uplambda$ ) on the labor share reflects a combination of the two effects described above. On the one hand, higher aggregate productivity leads to a lower labor share; but on the other hand, higher aggregate productivity is associated with a higher real wage (according to $\\uprho_{\\mathrm{W}}$ ), which increases the labor share. The overall effect is negative (i.e., $\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{{S}\\Lambda}}<0\\$ 0, provided that real wage response is not too large, which is the empirically relevant case, as we discuss below.  \n\n![](images/89f3a0226e3e120aba37b7fdce26f3b4904169765be023f7907b27ee434a8d70.jpg)  \nFig. 1. Determinants of labor share. Labor share as a function of productivity and wages in the production model. The figure shows the numerical solution for the firm's labor share as a function of productivity and wages. The top panel shows that labor share is decreasing in productivity. The bottom panel shows that labor share is increasing in economy-wide wages. The chosen values for $\\uprho$ result in elasticities of substitution of .5 and .7, values in the range of what many empirical studies find for the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor. Parameter values used in numerical solution: $\\upalpha=0.67$ $W=0.5$ (left panel), and $X=1$ (right panel).  \n\nOperating profits are defined as the residual cash fows of the firm after labor expenses are paid, $\\Pi\\equiv Y-L W$ . For simplicity, we assume that firms can frictionlessly suspend and resume production (and thus operating costs) over time.22 Operating profits under at the optimal labor demand can then be expressed as a function of productivity $X$ and labor share $S$  \n\n$$\n\\Pi_{\\mathrm{t}}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{(1-\\alpha)^{\\frac{1}{\\rho}}X_{\\mathrm{t}}K\\left(1-S_{\\mathrm{t}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\rho-1}{\\rho}},}&{\\mathrm{if}\\quad S_{\\mathrm{t}}<1,}\\ {0,}&{\\mathrm{if}\\quad S_{\\mathrm{t}}\\geq1,}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nwhere the second region reflects the fact that the firm will optimally suspend production before operating profits become negative, which happens when $S\\geq1$ . Figure 2 shows the negative relation between labor share and operating profits (holding productivity $X$ fixed). For instance, an increase in the real wage leads to an increase in labor share, so that a larger share of revenues is used to compensate labor, and operating profits decline.23 On the other hand, higher productivity increases operating profits both by reducing the labor share and by changing the scale of the firm (according to Equation (17)). The dynamics of profit growth are given by:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\Pi_{\\mathrm{t}}}{\\Pi_{\\mathrm{t}}}=\\mu_{\\Pi}[S_{\\mathrm{t}}]d t+\\mathfrak{\\sigma}_{\\Pi\\Lambda}[S_{\\mathrm{t}}]d Z_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\Lambda}+\\mathfrak{\\sigma}_{\\Pi\\mathrm{W}}[S_{\\mathrm{t}}]d Z_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{w}}+\\mathfrak{\\sigma}_{\\Pi\\mathrm{X}}[S_{\\mathrm{t}}]d Z_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{X}},\n$$  \n\nwhere:  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{II}}[S_{\\mathrm{I}}]}&{\\equiv\\left({\\cfrac{1}{1-S_{\\mathrm{I}}}}\\right)\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{X}}-S_{\\mathrm{I}}\\mu_{\\mathrm{w}}+\\left({\\cfrac{\\uprho}{1-\\uprho}}\\right)\\left({\\cfrac{S_{\\mathrm{r}}}{1-S_{\\mathrm{r}}}}\\right)\\left({\\cfrac{\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{X}}^{2}}{2}}-\\uprho_{\\mathrm{w}}\\uprho_{\\mathrm{x}}\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{w}}\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{x}}+{\\cfrac{\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{w}}^{2}}{2}}\\right)\\right),}\\ {\\Phi_{\\mathrm{In}}[S_{\\mathrm{I}}]}&{\\equiv\\left({\\cfrac{1}{1-S_{\\mathrm{I}}}}\\right)\\left(\\uprho_{\\mathrm{x}}\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{x}}-\\uprho_{\\mathrm{w}}\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{w}}S_{\\mathrm{t}}\\right),}\\ {\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Inv}}[S_{\\mathrm{I}}]}&{\\equiv-\\left({\\cfrac{S_{\\mathrm{r}}}{1-S_{\\mathrm{r}}}}\\right)\\left({\\sqrt{1-\\uprho_{\\mathrm{w}}^{2}}}\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{w}}\\right),\\quad{\\mathrm{and}}}\\ {\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Inv}}[S_{\\mathrm{I}}]}&{\\equiv\\left({\\cfrac{1}{1-S_{\\mathrm{I}}}}\\right)\\left({\\sqrt{1-\\uprho_{\\mathrm{x}}^{2}}}\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{x}}\\right).}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nEquation (18) shows that, since the capital stock is fixed, the dynamics of operating profits follow only from systematic and idiosyncratic TFP shocks and from shocks to the real wage. It also shows that the sensitivity of profit growth to the three shocks $(d Z^{\\Lambda},d Z^{\\mathrm{w}}$ and $d Z^{\\mathrm{X}}$ )are increasing in magnitude in labor share $S$ . This fact, which we formalize next, is at the heart of the link between labor share and labor-induced operating leverage.  \n\n![](images/fba12483bcbbeac4b3ed0ba7a14cbde751b8d798b3df1354b31132eae5319a52.jpg)  \nFig. 2. Operating profits and labor share. Operating profits a function of labor share in the production model. Parameter values used in numerical solution: $W=0.5$ ， $\\upalpha=0.67$ ， $K=1$ $\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{{X}}}=0.2$ $\\uprho_{\\mathrm{X}}=0.5$ ${\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{w}}}=0.05$ , and $\\uprho_{\\mathrm{W}}=0.1$  \n\n### 3.2 Labor Leverage  \n\nHaving derived the dynamics of cash flows, we can now formalize the labor leverage mechanism. The “traditional' operating leverage arises from the existence of fixed operating expenses. In contrast, the labor leverage mechanism is not based on the existence of fixed costs. (Note that all costs in the model are variable.) Instead, the labor leverage mechanism is based on the relative smoothness of wages and the imperfect correlation between wages and productivity.  \n\nTo see this, note that the response of profits to the aggregate productivity shock (i.e., the priced shock $\\uplambda$ )equals $\\begin{array}{r}{\\left(\\frac{1}{1-S}\\right)\\left(\\uprho_{\\mathrm{X}}\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{X}}-\\uprho_{\\mathrm{W}}\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{W}}S\\right)}\\end{array}$ according to Equation (18), hence in the special case in which wages respond one-for-one to productivity (i.e., $\\begin{array}{r}{\\pmb{\\uprho}_{\\mathrm{X}}\\pmb{\\upsigma}_{\\mathrm{X}}=\\pmb{\\uprho}_{\\mathrm{W}}\\pmb{\\upsigma}_{\\mathrm{W}})}\\end{array}$ , the response of operating profits to the shock is the same for all firms, and it responds one-to-one with the productivity shock. In contrast, in the case in which wages respond less than one-for-one to productivity shocks (i.e., $\\uprho_{\\mathrm{X}}\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{X}}>\\uprho_{\\mathrm{W}}\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{w}})$ , then the response of operating profits to the shock is greater than 1 for all firms. Firms cash flows “lever up'’ the smoothness of wages, making operating profits more procyclical. Moreover, this leverage effect is larger when the labor share $S$ is larger.  \n\nThe assumption $\\uprho_{\\mathrm{X}}\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{X}}>\\uprho_{\\mathrm{w}}\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{w}}$ is consistent with standard stylized facts. In aggregate data, corporate profits (or earnings) are highly procyclical and more volatile than total factor productivity (TFP) or GDP. It is well understood that an important reason for this fact is that labor compensation is relatively smooth and weakly correlated with TFP or GDP growth.24  \n\nTo quantify the effect of labor share on firm risk amplification, we define two measures of the sensitivity of operating profits to each of its two sources of shocks: productivity and wages. The first is a measure of the sensitivity of cash fow growth to TFP shocks, $\\Theta$ , which we denote simply as operating leverage. Operating leverage, $\\Theta$ , is defined (as in Donangelo (2014)) as the scaled covariance of equilibrium operating profit growth and TFP growth (i.e., $\\begin{array}{r}{\\Theta\\equiv\\mathrm{Cov}\\left[\\frac{d\\Pi}{\\Pi},\\frac{d X}{X}\\right]\\Big/\\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\frac{d X}{X}\\right]-}\\end{array}$ 1).25 Operating leverage is then given by  \n\n$$\n\\Theta[S_{\\mathrm{t}}]=\\frac{S_{\\mathrm{t}}}{1-S_{\\mathrm{t}}}\\left(1-\\frac{\\mathsf{\\Gamma}\\rho_{\\mathrm{w}}\\mathsf{\\uprho}_{\\mathrm{x}}\\Phi_{\\mathrm{w}}}{\\Phi_{\\mathrm{X}}}\\right).\n$$  \n\nEquation (19) shows that the sensitivity of operating profits to TFP shocks is positive and monotonically increasing in labor share $S$ , as long as TFP is more volatile than the component of wage growth correlated with TFP growth.26 This result is summarized in the proposition below:  \n\nProposition 4 (Monotonic relationship between operating leverage and labor share) Thecondition $\\pmb{\\upsigma}_{\\mathrm{X}}>\\uprho_{\\mathrm{W}}\\uprho_{\\mathrm{X}}\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{W}}$ implies that operating leverage is positive and increasing in labor shareS:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\Theta[S_{\\mathrm{t}}]>0a n d\\frac{d\\Theta[S_{\\mathrm{t}}]}{d S_{\\mathrm{t}}}\\geq0.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nProposition 4 follows directly from Equation (19). The main message of Proposition 4 is that, under strict complementarity of labor and capital, labor share can be used as a proxy for the degree of labor leverage experienced by the firm.  \n\nWe also define a related measure $\\Theta^{\\mathrm{W}}$ as the sensitivity of operating profits to changes in economy-wide wages (i.e., $\\begin{array}{r}{\\Theta^{\\mathrm{w}}\\equiv\\mathrm{Cov}\\left[\\frac{d\\Pi}{\\Pi},\\frac{d W}{W}\\right]\\Big/\\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\frac{d W}{W}\\right]-1)}\\end{array}$ The measure $\\Theta^{\\mathrm{W}}$ isgiven by  \n\n$$\n\\Theta^{\\mathrm{w}}[S_{\\mathrm{t}}]=-\\frac{1}{1-S_{\\mathrm{t}}}\\left(1-\\frac{\\mathsf{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{w}}\\uprho_{\\mathrm{x}}\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{x}}}{\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{w}}}\\right).\n$$  \n\nEquation (20) shows that the sensitivity of operating profits to wages shocks is negative, and its magnitude is monotonically increasing in labor share S. This result is summarized in the corollary below:  \n\nCorollary 1 (Sensitivity of operating profits to wage shocks)   \nThecondition $\\pmb{\\upsigma}_{\\mathrm{X}}>\\uprho_{\\mathrm{W}}\\uprho_{\\mathrm{X}}\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{W}}$ implies that the sensitivity of operating profit growth to wage growth   \nis negative and increasing in magnitude in labor share $S$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\Theta^{\\mathrm{w}}[S_{\\mathrm{t}}]<0a n d\\frac{d\\Theta^{\\mathrm{w}}[S_{\\mathrm{t}}]}{d S_{\\mathrm{t}}}\\leq0.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nCorollary 20 follows directly from Equation (20).  \n\nFigure 3 illustrates the relation of labor share to the exposure of operating profits to the two sources of uncertainty: productivity and wages. The figure shows that the magnitudes of the positive sensitivity of operating profits to productivity and the negative sensitivity of operating profits to wage shocks is increasing in labor share. This effect, which is directly related to labor leverage, is an intuitive result: Higher labor share is related to lower profit margins, which buffer the firm against either type of shocks. Productivity is positively related to operating profits, so that the exposure to productivity shocks is always positive and increasing in labor share. Labor expenses are negatively related to operating profits, so that the exposure to wages shocks is always negative, and its magnitude is increasing in labor share.  \n\n![](images/057ba3c6d031c0778ebae1be87869655dfa5dbdb78cc2ecfd2029166b5406b2f.jpg)  \nFig. 3. Labor leverage and labor share. Sensitivity of operating profits to productivity and wage shocks in the production model. The figure shows the relation of labor share to the exposure of operating profits to the two sources of uncertainty: productivity and wages. The figure shows that the magnitudes of the positive sensitivity of operating profits to productivity and the negative sensitivity of operating profits to wage shocks is increasing in labor share. Parameter values used in numerical solution: $W=0.5$ ， $\\upalpha=0.67$ ， $K=1$ $\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{{X}}}=0.2$ $\\uprho_{\\mathrm{X}}=0.5$ ${\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{w}}}=0.05$ , and $\\uprho_{\\mathrm{W}}=0.1$  \n\n### 3.3 Valuation and Expected Returns  \n\nIn equilibrium, firm value $(V)$ equals the value of the discounted stream of optimized operating profits:  \n\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{t}}=\\mathrm{E}_{\\mathrm{t}}\\left[\\int_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{s}}}{\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{t}}}\\Pi_{s}d s\\right].\n$$  \n\nUnder technical conditions, the solution to Equation (21) exists, and it is given by  \n\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{t}}=(1-\\upalpha)^{1/\\uprho}X_{\\mathrm{t}}K\\nu[S_{\\mathrm{t}}],\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\nu$ is a monotonically decreasing function of labor share, such that $\\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname*{lim}_{S\\to0}\\nu[S]=1}\\end{array}$ and $\\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname*{lim}_{S\\to1}\\nu[S]=0}\\end{array}$ . The explicit solution is given in the Appendix.  \n\nThe solution for the firm value is intuitive. First, when labor costs become negligible relative to the value added generated by the firm $(S\\rightarrow0)$ ), the value of the firm converges to that of a firm with a perpetual dividend governed by a geometric Brownian motion, in which the current dividend equals $(1-\\alpha)^{1/\\uprho}A K$ . As the cost of labor increases relative to the value added generated by the firm, the dividend falls and, consistently, the value of the firm falls. When labor costs equal the valueadded $(S\\rightarrow1$ ), operating profits are zero, so the firm shuts down production and all firm value arises from the option to resume production when operating profits become positive again.  \n\nThe negative relation between labor share and firm value is driven by two complementary channels: a cash flow channel and a discount rate channel. The cash fow channel consists in labor intensive firms having lower operating profits due to higher labor expenses per unit produced (i.e., higher marginal profitability of labor). The discount flow channel is related to the higher loading on systematic risk of a labor-intensive firm relative to a capital-intensive one. Figure 4 illustrates the negative relation between labor share and firm value.  \n\n![](images/b88c1cb5d55895acb9c016d1bb9be0a458137a8eac4a9abd286d2d0d52f682dc.jpg)  \nFig. 4.

Thus, Equation (23), in conjunction with our assumption that $\\uprho<0$ implies that the relationship between risk and labor share depends on the sign of $\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathsf{\\Gamma}\\mathsf{P}_{\\mathrm{X}}\\pmb{\\upsigma}_{\\mathrm{X}}-\\mathsf{\\uprho}_{\\mathrm{w}}\\pmb{\\upsigma}_{\\mathrm{w}}}\\end{array}$ This is formalized below:  \n\nProposition 5 (Asset returns and labor share) For $S_{\\mathrm{t}}\\in(0,1)$ $\\mathsf{p}_{\\mathrm{X}}\\bar{\\mathbf{o}}_{\\mathrm{X}}>\\mathsf{p}_{\\mathrm{W}}\\bar{\\mathbf{o}}_{\\mathrm{W}}$ is a sufcient condition for $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{d\\mathrm{E_{t}}[R_{\\mathrm{t}}]}{d S_{\\mathrm{t}}}\\geq0}\\end{array}$  \n\nIf the condition is satisfied, wages are less procyclical than productivity, and labor intensive firms have higher exposure to systematic risk (and narrower profit margins).  \n\nEquation (23) shows that the firm's excess returns over the risk-free rate depends on two sources of priced risk. The first source is a premium paid for the riskiness coming from the covariance between the firm's productivity and the stochastic discount factor $(\\uprho_{\\mathrm{X}}\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{X}})$ .We call this source of risk productivity risk. Productivity risk affects expected returns both directly, through its impact on overall productivity, and indirectly, through its impact on the relative productivity of capital and labor. It is this second, indirect, component that depends on the firm's labor share. The direct impact of productivity risk for an average firm will be positive in good times, as the average firm produces more, or finds that the prices of its products increase. The indirect impact is also positive, since our assumption about complementarity between labor and capital implies that a positive shock to the firm's productivity will amplify the impact on profits.  \n\nThe second source of risk captures the the firm's exposure to aggregate wages $(\\uprho_{\\mathrm{w}}\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{w}})$ .We call this component the wage hedge, as it depends only on the firm's exposure to wages and will likely reduce risk for the average firm. The wage hedge is linked to labor share, since variations in wages will have a larger effect on firms for which most of their value added is used to pay for labor. This component is a hedge because, on average, wages fall in bad times, which is precisely when a firm's profits are also falling due to systematic decreases in its own productivity.  \n\nCombining the two sources of risk-one positive, the other a hedge-delivers the relation between the firm's labor share and expected returns. This relation will be positive if the firm's systematic component of productivity is procyclical enough relative to wages. For instance, the systematic risk loadings of a firm whose productivity is uncorrelated with the stochastic discount factor $\\mathrm{\\Delta}\\mathrm{\\tilde{p}_{X}}=\\mathrm{0}\\mathrm{\\check{,}}$ is decreasing in its labor share. This is because, in this case, the hedge effect of wages is uncontested: Wages go up in good times, so profits fall; wages go down in bad times, so the firm's profits increase.  \n\nThe hedging impact of wages, though, is muted when the firm's productivity is sufficiently procyclical $(\\pmb{\\uprho}_{\\mathrm{X}}\\pmb{\\upsigma}_{\\mathrm{X}}>\\uprho_{\\mathrm{W}}\\pmb{\\upsigma}_{\\mathrm{w}})$ . In this case, even though wages are a hedge, the procyclical variation in the firm's sales price dominates, making the firm riskier as its labor share increases.  \n\nFigure 5 shows that asset betas are increasing in labor shares. The figure also shows that the positive relation between betas and labor share implies a positive relation between betas and wages and implies a negative relation between betas and productivity. The last panel shows that betas are insensitive to productivity once we control for labor share.  \n\n![](images/4f5c49df10eb5ab33033c45bcac4e0230d65f708c7135fdf58664d6f97458a0b.jpg)  \nFig. 5.

In this section, we take a step further and investigate the quantitative properties of the model via a calibration exercise. By simultaneously simulating the dynamics of many different firms—their labor share, cash flow, valuations, and expected returns endogenously varying over time—we impose discipline on our parameter choice so that relevant moments for the distribution of firms’ characteristics match the data. We can then further analyze the model's implications for the cross-section of stock returns, as well as validate some of our indirect measurements from the empirical section, such as the estimation of the elasticity of substitution between labor and capital. We find that, despite its qualitative nature, our model is able to generate results that are consistent with many of  \n\nour empirical findings.  \n\n#### 3.4.1  Calibration procedure  \n\nThe calibration exercise is as follows. We use a given set of parameters to generate time-series paths for 10,000 firms over 1,200 months. Firms are identical at the beginning of each simulation. We record firm characteristics and valuations on the penultimate month, and we record returns and volatilities using changes that occurred between the penultimate month and last month in the simulation. Next, we calculate relevant moments for the distribution of firm characteristics and returns, and perform cross-sectional regressions similar to those conducted in Section 2. We repeat this process 10,000 times and then average the resulting moments and coefficients from the regressions. Finally, we compare the moments used for the calibration with the moments found in the data using a loss function and then use a Simulated Annealing algorithm to find parameters that minimize the value of the loss function.27  \n\nOne challenge in the calibration of the model is that the distribution of firm valuations and characteristics is not constant. We deal with this issue in two ways. First, we include a Poisson process for death of firms to the model solution. When a firm dies, it exits the market and it is replaced by a new firm with the same original characteristics that all firms had a time zero. Once we add this feature to the model, long-term distributions will be stationary. Second, the simulated time period is purportedly long to ensure that the distribution of firms becomes stable.  \n\nTable 10 shows the target moments used in the calibration. We target macroeconomic moments, firm-level cash fows moments, and firm-level average unlevered stock returns. We choose the macroeconomic moments to ensure that the aggregate behavior of our simulated firms corresponds to well-known aggregate moments of the US economy. In particular, we target the volatilities of GDP, aggregate TFP, and aggregate wage growth. Since covariances are key components of asset prices, we also target the correlations between GDP growth and aggregate TFP growth, the correlation between GDP growth and aggregate wage growth, and the correlation between aggregate TFP growth and aggregate wage growth.  \n\nThe firm-specific moments we target are those that link labor shares with expected returns through leverage, namely the sensitivity of cash flows to GDP and TFP growth, as well as the change in the sensitivity of cash fows to GDP and TFP growth as a function of labor share.  \n\nThe asset-pricing moments we target are those that link differences in expected asset returns to labor share. Given that, in the empirical section, we report returns for quintiles of stocks ranked by labor share, we target the average return for the low-labor-share quintile portfolio, the high-laborshare quintile portfolio, as well as the difference in returns between these two portfolios.  \n\nTable 10 reports the weights attached to each of the moments targeted in the calibration. We give the highest weight to the aggregate volatility of our simulated firms—-with half as much weight on their correlations. We assign a high weight to the cross-sectional standard deviation of valueadded growth, given the relatively low number of other firm-level moments. We set a relatively low weigh to the slope coefficients from the regressions, since these are subject to significantly more serious estimation problems. Finally, we give a relatively high weight to the return of the low-labor-share quintile portfolio to obtain realistic stock returns, and we give a lower weight to the spread in portfolio returns between high and low labor share firms, given that this difference also suffers from potential estimation problems.  \n\n# << Table 10 here >>  \n\n#### 3.4.2   Calibration results  \n\nTable 11 shows the resulting parameters that are required to match the moments discussed above. Consider first the implications for the “representative” technology in the economy; in particular the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor, given the wide attention it has received in the literature. The resulting parameter, .40, is squarely in the range of values obtained by other estimations performed with very different methodologies, and very close to our own estimate derived in the empirical section.  \n\nThe calibration delivers the expected results for the observed shocks and drift for wage growth and productivity growth in the U.s., but it yields interesting results related to unobservable variables: in particular, the priced portion of wage and productivity shocks. The implied priced portion of wage shocks with the stochastic discount factor is .535, a value that, combined with a wage volatility of .021 and a price of risk of .80, implies a risk-premium for a claim to aggregate wages of about $8\\%$ . This result is consistent with the common assumption about human capital being a \"low-risk” asset. The implied priced portion of productivity shocks, .384, suggests that the largest component of the productivity shocks received by firms is purely idiosyncratic.  \n\nFinally, the calibration implies a risk-free rate of $1\\%$ and a Sharpe ratio of .8. These values, particularly the risk-free rate, fall within the range of their widely-used estimates. Note that the only asset pricing moments we used were the average returns of the low- and high-labor-share portfolios. So we consider it a success that the calibration aligns with empirical observations for the risk-free rate and the market price of risk.  \n\n# << Table 10 here >>  \n\nBeyond point estimates for certain parameters, the calibration can be used to investigate the model's capacity to replicate other relevant data. Table 12 contrasts a large number of moments derived from the calibration with those found in the data. Those explicitly targeted in the calibration are presented in bold, while the remaining ones are not targeted.  \n\nTable 12, Panel A, contrasts moments for macroeconomic variables in the data and in the model. We highlight the result for the comovement—-captured as a slope coefficient—-of wage and GDP growth. The model delivers a coefficient of .171, which implies that wages are relatively \"smooth\" in the model, just as they are in the data. This is relevant because wage “smoothness\" is one of the conditions we identify in Section I as being conducive to labor leverage.  \n\nPanels B and C contain moments related to the cross-section of firm cash flows. Since we target the cross-sectional standard deviation of firm-level value-added growth, it is not surprising that the resulting moment in the data is close to that one in the data. We do not explicitly target the average and the standard deviation of labor share, which is a moment our model must match in order to be credible. Fortunately, Panel C shows that our model does match this.  \n\nPanels D and E contrast the model and the resulting data for the sensitivities relevant to the labor leverage mechanism. The elasticity of substitution between capital and labor was not one of the calibrated parameters. Hoever, the fact that the estimated value for this elasticity (O.405) is remarkably close to the value used as input (O.40), is useful at validating our proposed new estimation methodology based solely on a panel of firm-level cash flow data.  \n\nFinally, Panel F links asset prices related to labor leverage found in the data with those found in the model. The model and the data imply a spread of $1.89\\%$ between high- and low-labor-share portfolios. Panel F closes our exercise by closely replicating the returns of portfolios sorted by labor share.  \n\nTaken as a whole, the results summarized in Table 12 imply that our simple, partial equilibrium model for firm dynamics, relating labor share and asset returns via a labor leverage mechanism, succeeds in explaining the patterns for returns observed in the data.  \n\n<< Table 12 here >>  \n\n## Conclusion  \n\nThis paper proposes that labor share is a promising new firm characteristic that explains the cross-section of returns. We develop a simple production-based model of a firm to study the labor leverage mechanism. This model provides theoretical motivation for the use of labor share as a firm-level measure of the degree of labor leverage. The model shows that the two sufficient conditions for the use of labor share as a proxy for labor leverage are: (a) Labor and capital are strict complements, and (b) economy-wide wages are smoother than aggregate productivity. These two sufficient conditions are generally supported in the data. Moreover, this paper provides modelagnostic empirical evidence that validates labor share as a measure of labor leverage. In particular, we document that the sensitivity of operating profits to shocks is cross-sectionally increasing in labor share. We further confirm a positive relation between labor leverage and expected asset returns. For instance, we show that average realized stock returns and average loadings on traditional systematic risk factors are increasing in labor share.  \n\n## REFERENCES  \n\nArias, Andres, Gary D.

The solution to the value of a firm can be expressed as a function of its TFP $X$ and its labor share $S$ $V[X_{\\mathrm{t}},S_{\\mathrm{t}}]$ . Given that operating profits (Equation (17)) are homogeneous of degree one in $X$ and $S$ . we conjecture and later verify that the value of the firm is also homogeneous of degree one in $X$ and S. That is, we assume the existence of a function $\\nu[S]$ such that $V[X,S]=X K\\nu[S]$ The homogeneity of the value of the firm allows us to simplify the PDE into the following ordinary differential equation (ODE):  \n\n$$\nh[S_{\\mathrm{t}}]-c_{0}\\nu[S_{\\mathrm{t}}]+c_{1}S\\nu^{\\prime}[S_{\\mathrm{t}}]+c_{2}S^{2}\\nu^{\\prime\\prime}[S_{\\mathrm{t}}]=0,\n$$  \n\nwhere:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\mathfrak{I}_{\\mathfrak{t}}]\\equiv\\frac{\\Pi_{\\mathfrak{t}}}{X_{\\mathfrak{t}}K}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{(1-\\upalpha)^{\\frac{1}{\\rho}}(1-S_{\\mathfrak{t}})^{1-\\frac{1}{\\rho}},}&{\\mathrm{if}\\quad S_{\\mathfrak{t}}<1,}\\ {0,}&{\\mathrm{if}\\quad S_{\\mathfrak{t}}\\geq1,}\\end{array}\\right.}\\ &{c_{0}\\equiv r-\\lambda+\\upeta\\uprho_{\\mathtt{X}}\\upsigma_{\\mathtt{X}}-\\mu_{\\mathtt{X}},}\\ &{c_{1}\\equiv\\frac{\\Theta\\big(2\\upeta\\uprho\\big(\\uprho_{\\mathrm{X}}\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{X}}-\\uprho_{\\mathrm{W}}\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{W}}\\big)+2\\upeta\\uprho_{\\mathrm{w}}\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{W}}-2\\upeta\\uprho_{\\mathrm{X}}\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{X}}-2\\mu_{\\mathrm{W}}\\big(1-\\uprho\\big)+2\\mu_{\\mathrm{X}}\\big(1-\\uprho\\big)-2\\uprho_{\\mathrm{w}}\\big\\{\\left(1-\\uprho\\big)+2\\uprho_{\\mathrm{X}}\\Bar{\\left(1-\\uprho\\big)}+\\frac{2\\uprho_{\\mathrm{W}}\\Bar{\\left(1-\\uprho\\right)}}{2}\\right\\}\\big)^{\\frac{1}{\\rho}}}{2\\big(1-\\uprho\\big)^{2}}}\\ &{c_{2}\\equiv\\frac{\\Theta^{2}\\big(\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{w}}^{2}+\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{x}}^{2}-2\\uprho_{\\mathrm{w}}\\uprho_{\\mathrm{X}}\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{w}}\\upsigma_{\\mathrm{X}}\\big)}{2\\big(1-\\uprho\\big)^{2}}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe value of the firm as $S\\rightarrow0$ converges to the value of a firm with a dividend of $X_{\\mathrm{t}}K(1-\\upalpha)^{\\frac{1}{\\uprho}}$ ， a growthrteofts, and a disoun ate of + pxOx, hich resut n lims-od(S  (e) There are three other boundary conditions. The first one corresponds to $\\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\to\\infty}\\nu[S]=0}\\end{array}$ , since the value of a firm that further deviates from the region where it produces positive operating profits (i.e., its its “active region\") should approach O. The other two conditions are the smooth-pasting conditions when $S=1$ (\"active-inactive threshold\"). At this point $\\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname*{lim}_{S\\to1^{-}}\\nu[S]=\\operatorname*{lim}_{S\\to1^{+}}\\nu[S]}\\end{array}$ and $\\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname*{lim}_{S\\to1^{-}}\\nu^{\\prime}[S]=\\operatorname*{lim}_{S\\to1^{+}}\\nu^{\\prime}[S].}\\end{array}$  \n\nThe solution to Equation (29) in each of the two regions, active $S<1$ and inactive $S\\geq1$ ,has  \n\nthe general form:  \n\n$$\n\\nu[S]=\\nu_{h}[S]+\\nu_{p}[S],\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\nu_{h}[S]$ and $\\nu_{p}[S]$ are the homogeneous and particular solutions to ODE (29).  \n\nWe start by finding two linearly independent solutions to the corresponding homogeneous differential equation:  \n\n$$\n\\nu_{h}[S]=C_{1}S^{x_{1}}+C_{2}S^{x_{2}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are given by:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle x_{1}=\\frac{c_{2}-c_{1}+\\sqrt{(c_{2}-c_{1})^{2}+4c_{0}c_{2}}}{2c_{2}},}\\ {\\displaystyle x_{2}=\\frac{c_{2}-c_{1}-\\sqrt{(c_{2}-c_{1})^{2}+4c_{0}c_{2}}}{2c_{2}}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nSince, by assumption, $c_{0}c_{2}>0$ , it follows that $x_{1}>0>x_{2}$ . This observation will be used below.  \n\nWe are looking for a particular solution of the following type:  \n\n$$\n\\nu_{p}[S]=g_{1}[S]S^{x_{1}}+g_{2}[S]S^{x_{2}}.\n$$  \n\nWithout loss of generality, assume $g_{1}^{\\prime}[S]S^{x_{1}}+g_{2}^{\\prime}[S]S^{x_{2}}=0$ , then substitute the particular solution into the ODE. Thus, we obtain the following system of equations:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{g_{1}^{\\prime}[S]S^{x_{1}}+g_{2}^{\\prime}[S]S^{x_{2}}=0}}\\ {{g_{1}^{\\prime}[S]x_{1}S^{x_{1}-1}+g_{2}^{\\prime}[S]x_{2}S^{x_{2}-1}=\\displaystyle\\frac{(1-\\upalpha)^{\\frac{1}{9}}\\left(1-(1-S)^{1-\\frac{1}{9}}\\right)}{c_{2}S^{2}}.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nSolving for $g_{1}^{\\prime}[S]$ and $g_{2}^{\\prime}[S]$ we find:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{g_{1}^{\\prime}[S]=\\displaystyle\\frac{\\left(1-\\upalpha\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\Theta}}\\left(1-\\left(1-S\\right)^{1-\\frac{1}{\\Theta}}\\right)S^{-1-x_{1}}}{c_{2}\\left(x_{1}-x_{2}\\right)},}}\\ {{g_{2}^{\\prime}[S]=\\displaystyle-\\frac{\\left(1-\\upalpha\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\Theta}}\\left(1-\\left(1-S\\right)^{1-\\frac{1}{\\Theta}}\\right)S^{-1-x_{2}}}{c_{2}\\left(x_{1}-x_{2}\\right)}.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nTherefore, the solution to the particular equation therefore is:  \n\n$$\n\\nu_{p}[S]=\\frac{(1-\\alpha)^{\\frac19}}{x_{1}-x_{2}}\\left(S^{x_{1}}\\int_{k_{1}}^{S}(1-(1-\\tau)^{\\frac{p-1}{9}})\\tau^{1-x_{1}}d\\tau-S^{x_{2}}\\int_{k_{2}}^{S}(1-(1-\\tau)^{\\frac{p-1}{9}})\\tau^{1-x_{2}}d\\tau\\right),\n$$  \n\nfor arbitrary constants $k_{1}$ and $k_{2}$ . What remains is a choice of $k_{1}$ and $k_{2}$ so that the solution is well defined and the boundary conditions are satisfied. An easy choice is to take $k_{1}=1$ and $k_{2}=0$ , then the particular solution is  \n\n$$\n\\nu_{p}[S]=\\frac{\\left(1-\\alpha\\right)^{\\frac{1}{9}}}{x_{1}-x_{2}}\\left(-S^{x_{1}}\\int_{S}^{1}\\left(1-\\left(1-\\tau\\right)^{\\frac{p-1}{9}}\\right)\\tau^{1-x_{1}}d\\tau-S^{x_{2}}\\int_{0}^{S}\\left(1-\\left(1-\\tau\\right)^{\\frac{p-1}{9}}\\right)\\tau^{1-x_{2}}d\\tau\\right)\n$$  \n\nThe general solution will be the sum of the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. Since the value of the homogeneous solution can not grow without bound as $S\\rightarrow0$ or as $S\\to\\infty$ the constants in the homogeneous solution associated with $S^{x_{2}}$ in the active region $S<1$ and $S^{x_{1}}$ in the inactive region $S\\geq1$ must be zero. Thus, the solution in the active region $S<1$ is:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle\\nu[S]=D_{1}S^{x_{1}}-}}\\ {{\\displaystyle\\qquad\\frac{2\\bigl(1-\\alpha\\bigr)^{\\frac{1}{9}}}{\\Phi_{s}^{2}\\bigl(x_{1}-x_{2}\\bigr)}\\left(S^{x_{1}}\\int_{S}^{1}\\bigl(1-\\bigl(1-\\tau\\bigr)^{\\frac{9-1}{9}}\\bigr)\\tau^{-1-x_{1}}d\\tau+S^{x_{2}}\\int_{0}^{S}\\bigl(1-\\bigl(1-\\tau\\bigr)^{\\frac{9-1}{9}}\\bigr)\\tau^{-1-x_{2}}d\\tau\\right),}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nand the solution in the inactive region $S\\geq1$ is  \n\n$$\n\\nu[S]=D_{2}S^{x_{2}}.\n$$  \n\nWhat remains is to find the constants $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ such that the smooth-pasting conditions hold. The limit of $\\nu_{p}[S]$ as $S\\rightarrow0$ is O, so meeting the boundary condition for $S=0$ will come from the solution to the homogeneous differential equation.  \n\nDefine $\\begin{array}{r}{A_{2}\\equiv\\int_{0}^{1}\\big(1-\\big(1-\\uptau\\big)^{\\frac{\\uprho-1}{\\uprho}}\\big)\\uptau^{-1-x_{2}}d\\uptau.}\\end{array}$ Itis asy to se that $\\begin{array}{r}{\\nu_{p}[1]=\\frac{-2(1-\\alpha)^{\\frac{1}{\\rho}}A_{2}}{2c_{2}(x_{1}-x_{2})}}\\end{array}$ and $\\nu_{p}^{\\prime}[1]=$ -( Thus from the soot-pasting conditions we otain  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}{\\lefteqn{\\frac{-2(1-\\upalpha)^{\\frac19}A_{2}}{2c_{2}\\left(x_{1}-x_{2}\\right)}+D_{1}+\\frac{\\left(1-\\upalpha\\right)^{\\frac19}}{c_{0}}=D_{2}}}\\ &{}&{\\frac{-2(1-\\upalpha)^{\\frac19}x_{2}A_{2}}{2c_{2}\\left(x_{1}-x_{2}\\right)}+D_{1}x_{1}=D_{2}x_{2}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nSolving for $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{D_{1}=\\displaystyle\\frac{\\frac{(1-\\alpha)^{\\frac{1}{\\rho}}}{c_{0}}x_{2}}{x_{1}-x_{2}}}}\\ {{D_{2}=\\displaystyle\\frac{\\left(1-\\alpha\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\rho}}}{2c_{2}(x_{1}-x_{2})}\\left(-2A_{2}+\\frac{2c_{2}x_{1}}{c_{0}}\\right).}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe complete solution to the value of the firm is, therefore In the active region $S<1$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle\\nu[S]=\\frac{2(1-\\upalpha)^{\\frac{1}{\\uprho}}}{2c_{2}c_{0}(x_{1}-x_{2})}\\left((x_{1}-x_{2})\\frac{2c_{2}}{2}+\\frac{2c_{2}}{2}x_{2}S^{x_{1}}-\\right.}\\ {\\displaystyle\\left.c_{0}S^{x_{1}}\\int_{s}^{1}{(1-(1-\\uptau)^{\\frac{{\\uprho}-1}{\\uprho}})\\uptau^{1-x_{1}}d\\uptau}-c_{0}S^{x_{2}}\\int_{0}^{S}{(1-(1-\\uptau)^{\\frac{{\\uprho}-1}{\\uprho}})\\uptau^{1-x_{2}}d\\uptau}\\right).}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIn the inactive region $S\\geq1$  \n\n$$\n\\nu\\left[S\\right]=\\frac{2(1-\\upalpha)^{\\frac{1}{\\uprho}}}{2c_{2}c_{0}(x_{1}-x_{2})}\\left(-A_{2}c_{0}+\\frac{2c_{2}x_{1}}{2}\\right)S^{x_{2}}.\n$$  \n\n# Table I Summary Statistics  \n\nPanels A and B report time series averages of median characteristics of portfolios of firms sorted on labor share (LS) and the extended measure of labor share (ELS), respectively. $L S$ is ratio of labor expenses over the sum of labor expenses, operating profits, and the change in inventories of final goods. The construction of ELS is identical to that of $L S$ , except that, for firms that do not report labor expenses, we proxy them by the product of the number of employees in the firm and the average wage in the industry. Log. L/K is the logarithm of the ratio of the number of employees over PPE. B/M is the shareholders’ book value of equity divided by the market value of equity. Log Size is the logarithm of market value of equity. Log. Asset is the logarithm of the book value of assets. Tang. is tangibility, and is defined as the ratio of plant, property, and equipment (PPE) over assets. Org. Cap is organizational capital, constructed as in Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou (2013). Lev. is leverage, and is defined as the ratio of the book value of debt minus cash and marketable securities over the book value of assets minus cash and marketable securities. Prof. is the measure of gross profitability as defined by Novy-Marx (2013). All variables are adjusted for inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index.

We proceed in two stages. In the first stage, we estimate the elasticity to shocks of operating profit growth $(\\Theta^{\\Pi})$ and value added growth $(\\Theta^{\\mathrm{Y}})$ . The table shows estimates of time-series regressions of firm-level measures of real operating profit $\\Pi$ growth and real value added $Y$ growth on aggregate GDP growth, TFP growth, and the returns on the market portfolio. In the second stage, we regress $\\hat{\\Theta}^{\\Pi}$ on $\\bar{\\Theta^{\\mathrm{Y}}}$ from the first pass to obtain estimates of the elasticity of substitution between labor and capital. A value added is constructed as the sum of labor expenses, operating profits before interest and depreciation, adjusted for changes in the inventories of final goods. In Panel A, the labor expenses used are staff expenses (XLR), and in Panel B, the product of the number of employees (EMP) and the industry average of (XLR/EMP) is used if XLR is missing. $g d p^{\\mathrm{g}}$ is annualized growth calculated as the change of the logarithm of real GDP. tfp\\* is annualized growth calculated as the change of the logarithm of TFP.

    "reference_markdown": "# Untangling the Value Premium with Labor Shares  \n\nAndres Donangelo University of Texas at Austin  \n\nSeptember 28, 2019  \n\nThis paper quantifies the relative importance of labor-induced operating leverage at explaining the value premium. I extend a traditional variance decomposition methodology using labor shares to disentangle labor leverage from the value premium and from the value spread and from the variation in profitability levels and growth. My extended decomposition shows that labor leverage explains approximately 50% of the value premium, whereas profitability and growth-based mechanisms explain the other $50\\%$ .I propose a tractable production-based asset-pricing model that qualitatively and quantitatively explains this finding, as well as the relation between book-to-market ratios, discount rates, profitability, and future growth. (JEL G11, G12, E22, E23, J23)  \n\nFirms with high book-to-market (B/M) ratios have higher average stock returns than frms with low B/M ratios, a regularity known as the value premium. Far from being puzzling, this regularity is consistent with the fundamental inverse relation between present values and discount rates.1 However, the fact that the value premium is not anomalous does not imply that it is well understood. In reality, the literature still has not reached a consensus on the relative importance of the many plausible drivers of the value premium documented over the last decades. This paper takes a first step in the direction of untangling the micro-foundations of the value premium.  \n\nThis paper proposes a new empirical methodology to untangle the value premium by exploring its interrelations with the value spread (i.e., the cross-sectional variation of B/M ratios), and the profitability level and growth spreads (i.e., the cross-sectional variation in contemporaneous levels and future growth of return on equity ratios, ROE hereafter). The proposed methodology reinterprets and extends the value spread decompositions from Vuolteenaho (1999, 2002) and Cohen, Polk, and Vuolteenaho (2003) (CPV hereafter).² The results of the proposed methodology show that operating leverage explains around 50% of the value premium but less than $20\\%$ of the variation in profitability growth. The contrast in the explanatory power of operating leverage on the value premium and the profitability growth spread is a finding that supports the hypothesis that growth-based mechanisms drive the remaining $50\\%$ of the value premium.  \n\nOperating leverage is a broad concept that denotes cash fow risk amplification due to the imperfect elasticity of operating costs relative to output (see Lev (1974) for a seminal discussion of the concept). Of the different possible forms of operating leverage, this paper focuses on the labor-induced form (labor leverage hereafter) as a main driver of the value premium. Growing evidence suggests that labor leverage is the predominant form of operating leverage for the firm. For instance, Donangelo et al. (2019) document that, relative to labor costs, nonlabor costs are almost fully elastic and thus have almost no impact on firms’ operating leverage: a $1\\%$ reduction in sales leads, on average, to a $0.69\\%$ reduction in staff expenses but a 0.99% reduction in all other costs. This evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that operating leverage is labor leverage.  \n\nThe proposed methodology, which is inspired by the method of instrumental variables (IV), uses labor share (i.e., the ratio of labor expenses to value added) as the variable of choice to untangle the value premium. Drawing on an analogy with IV, I note that the use of labor share in the methodology is akin to the use of an instrument for labor leverage.? Extending the analogy even further, labor share is an appropriate variable to use in the methodology because it satisfies the equivalent of the “exclusion restriction\" in IV. Specifically, labor share is a variable that is related to operating leverage but that is not ex ante related to other drivers of the value premium (e.g., growth opportunities).4  \n\nThe paper proposes a highly tractable production-based asset pricing model that rationalizes the empirical findings presented. In the model, firms have access to perfect labor markets, in which wages are smoother than productivity and use a productive technology in which labor and capital are complements (i.e., the labor-capital elasticity of substitution is strictly less than one). The strict complementarity between labor and capital and the smoothness of wages are sufficient conditions that jointly imply the existence of labor leverage and the validity of labor share as a proxy for labor leverage.  \n\nreturns, profitability levels, and profitability growth. I make the model more general by introducing three additional components. The first additional component is capital accumulation through investments. The investment activity is subject to capital adjustment costs and (partial) investment irreversibility. The second additional component is a mechanism based on investment-specific technological (IST) shocks that simultaneously drive the purchase price of capital and the market price of risk.5 The third additional component is based on firm-specific regime-switching shocks that drive cross-sectional differences in productivity growth rates, which in turn generate a wedge in the future cash fow growth between value and growth firms. Taken together, these three additional components represent the many proposed drivers for the value premium that are not directly related to operating leverage.?  \n\nWhen calibrated under reasonable parameter values, the proposed model is able to not only qualitatively but also quantitatively explain the empirical findings of the paper. In particular, the calibrated model rationalizes the results of the proposed methodology as well as those of the traditional value spread decomposition results from CPV.? The model explains the finding in Fama and French (1995) that growth firms have higher profitability levels than value frms and that this difference tends to mean revert (i.e., the wedge in ROEs between growth and value frms tends to increase in the years before and decrease in the years after portfolio formation). In addition, the model is able to rationalize the failure of the conditional and unconditional versions of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) to explain the value premium.  \n\nand Giammarino (2004) and Novy-Marx (2011).8 Carlson et al. (2004) propose two variations of a model in which operating leverage and a finite number of growth options jointly drive the value premium and the size effect. The findings in Novy-Marx (2011) suggest that cross-sectional variation in operating leverage is a main determinant of the value premium. This paper complements and contributes to this literature by quantifying the relative importance of operating leverage, and in particular labor leverage, at explaining the value premium.  \n\nA growing strand of the literature considers the interconnection between labor markets and equity risk.? Within this literature, my paper is closest to the strand that studies the cross-sectional implications of labor leverage. Donangelo (2014) proposes a model in which labor mobility and wage smoothness lead to a labor-induced form of operating leverage. Gourio (2007), which is now partially subsumed by Donangelo et al. (2019), shows that labor leverage arises from the combination of wage smoothness and the strict complementarity of labor and capital and presents the theoretical motivation for the use of labor share as a proxy for labor leverage. The model in this paper extends the model from Donangelo et al. (2019), in which labor leverage is the only form of operating leverage, by adding capital accumulation, cross-sectional dispersion in future productivity growth rates, and IST shocks as additional drivers of the value premium while retaining most of the tractability of the original model.  \n\nlibrium model of firms subject to sticky wages and labor leverage to the otherwise standard long-run risk model from Kaltenbrunner and Lochstoer (2010). While it mostly focuses on aggregate moments, the model in Favilukis and Lin (2016b) incorporates many additional determinants of operating leverage, such as fixed operating costs that are unrelated to firmspecific scale and decreasing-returns-to-scale technologies, to also generate a value premium. In contrast, the cross-sectional scope of the model proposed in this paper allows for a more parsimonious and standard set of assumptions. In addition, the model in this paper is consistent with the aforementioned growing evidence that labor leverage is the only form of operating leverage needed in an asset pricing model.  \n\nThis paper makes a number of empirical contributions to the labor-asset pricing literature, which include the new decomposition methodologies and a new set of stylized facts that relate labor leverage to the contemporaneous value spread and the value premium and profitability spreads at different time horizons. In addition, this paper makes a theoretical contribution to the labor-asset pricing literature by proposing a new class of model that combines the breadth of macro-finance finance models at explaining financial and nonfinancial cross-sectional moments from the data (e.g., Belo et al. 2014) with the high tractability of models from the real options literature (e.g., Abel and Eberly 1994, 1997).  \n\nFinally, this paper contributes to the broad asset pricing literature that studies the value premium. A common focus in this literature is the study of the value premium as a pricing factor.1° A more closely related paper in this literature is Gerakos and Linnainmaa (2018), who explore a different extension of CPV's methodology to study the dynamic nature of the value premium. The decomposition in that paper produces B/M components that are effectively parallel to and orthogonal to discount rates, which is consistent with the different focus of studying the value premium as a risk factor. My approach is agnostic about the identity of the sources of priced risk in the economy. In fact, consistent with the argument in Berk (1995), the working assumption in this paper is that any determinant of crosssectional variation in expected stock returns, whether or not documented by the literature, is embedded in the value premium.  \n\n## 1 Value Spread Decompositions  \n\nThis section presents the methodology to decompose the value spread and to decompose the components of the value spread (e.g., the value premium). The methodology proposed in this paper is based on, and extends, the value spread decomposition methodology from Vuolteenaho (1999), Vuolteenaho (2002), and Cohen et al. (2003, CPV). I frst present the baseline value spread decomposition, which is a variant of the original methodology in CPV. I then present the ectended value spread decomposition, which is used to untangle the value premium with labor shares.  \n\n### 1.1 Baseline value spread decomposition  \n\nThis section presents the baseline value spread decomposition which is a variant of the original methodology from CPV. The original decomposition methodology, as well as the variant proposed in this paper, explore an accounting identity that relates a firm's book-tomarket ratio to future earnings and stock returns. In this sense, these methodologies are related to those in the literature that explore accounting identities based on price-to-dividend ratios or price-to-earnings ratios (e.g., Campbell and Shiller 1988). While the objective of the decompositions in this literature is the study of the time-series variation of the price-todividend ratios or price-to-earnings ratios, the objective of the value spread decompositions is the study of the cross-sectional variation of book-to-market ratios (i.e., the value spread).  \n\nThe starting point of the baseline value spread decomposition is the following assumption about the relation between earnings, dividends, and book-to-market growth:  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{P}_{t}=\\mathrm{D}_{t}+\\mathrm{B}_{t}-\\mathrm{B}_{t-1},\n$$  \n\nwhere $P$ $D$ , and $B$ represent earnings, dividends, and the book value of equity, respectively. The definition above is consistent with clean surplus accounting, and it implies that earnings generated by the firm can be paid back to their owners as dividends or be reinvested by the firm, which is represented by the change in book value $\\mathrm{B}_{t}-\\mathrm{B}_{t-1}$ in Equation (1).1 Equation (1) implies that the book-to-market ratio can be expressed as  \n\n$$\n\\frac{B_{t}}{M_{t}}=\\left(\\frac{1+R_{t+1}}{1+E_{t+1}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1+^{D_{t+1}}/B_{t+1}}{1+^{D_{t+1}}/M_{t+1}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{B_{t+1}}{M_{t+1}}\\right),\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\begin{array}{r}{R_{t}\\equiv\\frac{\\Delta M_{t}+D_{t}}{M_{t-1}}}\\end{array}$ represents the net stock return and Et = B- represents the return on equity (ROE). After taking logs to both sides of Equation (2), log-linearizing the right-hand side of the resultant equality, and assuming stationarity in the book-to-market ratio, I obtain  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathrm{bm}_{t}\\approx r_{t+1}-e_{t+1}+\\rho\\mathrm{bm}_{t+1},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathrm{bm}\\equiv\\mathrm{Log}\\left[B_{t}\\right]-\\mathrm{Log}\\left[M_{t}\\right]$ ， $r_{t}\\equiv\\mathrm{Log}\\left[1+R_{t}\\right]$ , and $e_{t}\\equiv\\mathrm{Log}\\left[1+E_{t}\\right]$ are the logarithms of the book-to-market ratio, gross stock returns (i.e., one plus net stock returns), and (one plus) ROE, and where $\\rho\\leq1$ is a positive constant. Equation (3) is obtained by approximating Log $[1+D_{t}/{\\cal M}_{t}]\\approx(d_{t}-m_{t})\\rho$ and $\\log{[1+D_{t}/\\boldsymbol{B}_{t}]}\\approx(d_{t}-b_{t})\\rho$ ,where $d_{t}\\equiv\\operatorname{Log}\\left[D_{t}\\right]$ ， $m_{t}\\equiv$ $\\mathrm{Log}\\left[M_{t}\\right]$ , and $b_{t}\\equiv\\log\\left[B_{t}\\right]$ 1² Iterating forward bm in Equation (3) by $N$ periods, I obtain  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{bm}_{t}\\approx\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\rho^{j}r_{t+j}-\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\rho^{j}e_{t+j}+\\rho^{1+N}\\mathrm{bm}_{t+1+N}.\n$$  \n\nThe term $\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\rho^{j}r_{t+j}$ in the expression above represents the component of bm that is attributed to higher future discount rates between years $t$ and $t$ +1+N. The term $-\\textstyle\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\rho^{j}e_{t+j}$ is the component attributed to lower ROE levels, lower ROE growth between years $t$ and  \n\n$t$ +1+N,or a combination of the two The term $\\rho^{1+N}\\mathrm{bm}_{t+1+N}$ representsthecomponent attributed to discount rates, ROE levels, and ROE growth after year t+1+N, all of which arecapturedby $\\mathrm{bm}_{\\mathrm{t+1+N}}$ (i.e., the bm that prevails at year t+1+N).  \n\nOne departure point from the original methodology in CPV is that I further decompose the term related to ROE into a term related to the contemporaneous level of ROE and a term related to future growth in ROE, as given by  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{bm}_{t}\\approx\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\rho^{j}r_{t+j}-e_{t}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\rho^{j}\\right)-\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\rho^{j}e g_{t,t+j}+\\rho^{1+N}\\mathrm{bm}_{t+1+N},\n$$  \n\nwhere $e g_{t,t+j}\\equiv e_{t+j}-e_{t}$ is related to the growth in ROE from period $t$ to period $t+j$ Equation (5) tells us that a high bm today might be explained by high future asset returns (i.e., high discount rates), low contemporaneous ROE levels, low future ROE growth, and high future B/M ratios.13  \n\nThe last step is to apply the cross-sectional covariance of today's log book-to-market ratios, $b m_{t}$ to both sides of Equation (5):  \n\n![](images/fc479f125811134e6efb989372347c8ced54d6df0420324f728760202e00b882.jpg)  \n\nwhere the covariance and variances are cross-sectional (i.e., across portfolios of firms).  \n\nThe economic interpretation of each of the components of Equation (6) is important for the interpretation of the decomposition procedure. First, note that the term value spread is sometimes defined as the difference between the book-to-market ratios of a value firm and a growth frm.14 This last definition is not general, because it relies on possibly arbitrary book-to-market ratio breakpoints to define value and growth firms. This paper employs the more general definition from CPV. Specifically, I define the value spread simply as the cross-sectional variance of log book-to-market ratios (bm), which is the left-hand side of Equation (6). I denote the first component of the right-hand side of Equation (6) by value premium. Note that this label is more commonly used to refer to the stock return spread between value and growth firms. In this paper, I define the value premium more generally as the cross-sectional variation in expected returns explained by the cross-sectional variation in bm. In other words, the value premium is defined here as the projection of the cross-section of returns on the value spread. This definition is aligned with the definition of value spread employed in this paper, as discussed above. More importantly, this definition allows me to conduct a simple extension of the value spread decomposition methodology from CPV to study the value premium. I denote the second component of the right-hand side of Equation (6) as the ROE level spread, because it represents the portion of the value spread explained by contemporaneous variation in ROE. I denote the third component of the right-hand side of Equation (6) as ROE growth spread, because it represents the projection of the crosssection of future ROE growth on the value spread. Finally, I denote the fourth component on the right-hand side of Equation (6) as Value spread persistence, because it relates to the portion of the value spread that is expected to persist far into the future.15  \n\nOne can transform the four components on the right-hand side of Equation (6) to weights by dividing both sides of the equation by the cross-sectional variance of $b m_{t}$ ,which leads to  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\prime\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\rho^{j}r_{t+j},\\mathbf{bm}_{t}\\right]}{\\mathbf{Var}\\left[\\mathbf{bm}_{t}\\right]}-\\frac{\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\rho^{j}\\right)\\mathrm{Cov}\\left[e_{t},\\mathbf{bm}_{t}\\right]}{\\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\mathbf{bm}_{t}\\right]}-\\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\rho^{j}e g_{t,t+j},\\mathbf{bm}_{t}\\right]}{\\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\mathbf{bm}_{t}\\right]}+\\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}\\left[\\rho^{1+N}\\mathbf{bm}_{t+1+N},\\mathbf{bm}_{t}\\right]}{\\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\mathbf{bm}_{t}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nThe expression above shows that the cross-sectional variation in bm (i.e., the value spread)  \n\nis explained by the cross-sectional variation of discount rates projected on bm (i.e., the value premium), by the cross-sectional variation in the level and future growth of ROE (i.e., the ROE level and ROE growth spreads), and by a residual term related to the value spread persistence. In what follows, I refer to these four terms as weights, given that their sum equals one in the absence of approximation errors.  \n\nTo estimate each of the weights in Equation (7), I run the following cross-sectional regressions:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}&{}&{\\sum_{\\mathrm{j}=1}^{\\mathrm{N}}\\rho^{j}\\tilde{r}_{t+j}=\\beta_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\mathrm{r}}\\widetilde{\\mathrm{bm}}_{t}+\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\mathrm{r}},}\\ &{}&{-\\left(\\sum_{\\mathrm{j}=1}^{\\mathrm{N}}\\rho^{j}\\right)\\tilde{e}_{t}=\\beta_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\mathrm{e}}\\widetilde{\\mathrm{bm}}_{t}+\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\mathrm{e}},}\\ &{}&{-\\sum_{\\mathrm{j}=1}^{\\mathrm{N}}\\rho^{j}\\widetilde{e}_{\\mathcal{G}_{t,t+j}}=\\beta_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\mathrm{eg}}\\widetilde{\\mathrm{bm}}_{t}+\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\mathrm{eg}},}\\ &{}&{\\rho^{1+\\mathrm{N}}\\widetilde{\\mathrm{bm}}_{\\mathrm{t+1+N}}=\\beta_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\mathrm{bm}}\\widetilde{\\mathrm{bm}}_{t}+\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\mathrm{bm}},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere the tildes denote cross-sectionally demeaned log-linearized variables and N represents the time horizon considered.16 Finally, the estimated weights represented by the four components on the right-hand side of Equation (7) are simply the time-series averages of the estimated slopes from the four regressions in Equation (8). I discuss the implementation details of the procedure in Appendix C.  \n\n#### 1.1.1 Results of the baseline decomposition.  \n\nTable 1, panel A, shows the results of the baseline decomposition. Figure 7, panel A, graphically shows the point estimates. The table and figure show that, despite the different samples used, the results are qualitatively similar to those in CPV. The first column of the first group of rows shows that, at 15-year horizons, 11.3% of the cross-sectional variation in the log book-to-market ratios (bm) is due to variation in discount rates. The second and third columns show that, at the 15-year horizon, 62% of the cross-sectional variation in bm is due to the two ROE spreads: -53.6% is due to the ROE growth spread and $115.6\\%$ is due to the ROE level spread. The interpretation of this last result is that low bm firms (i.e., growth firms) tend to have high contemporaneous ROE levels that tend to decline (i.e., mean revert) in the future. Overall, the results of the baseline decomposition confirm the finding in CPV that, at all horizons, the component of the value spread related to the ROE spreads dominates the component related to the value premium. Also consistent with the findings in CPV, the table and figure show that the component related to the persistence of the value spread explains most of the value spread in the shorter-window decompositions, although the relative importance of this component steadily declines across horizons.  \n\n### 1.2 Decomposition of the value spread components  \n\n#### 1.2.1 Motivation.  \n\nEquation (5) shows that one should expect that determinants of expected returns to also determine B/M ratios. Similarly, the equation shows that determinants of ROE levels and future ROE growth should also determine B/M ratios. However, note that the converse of these statements is not necessarily true. That is, one should not expect that all determinants of B/M ratios to also simultaneously determine expected returns, ROE levels, or future ROE growth. For instance, a determinant of future ROE growth is conceivably unrelated to stock returns (i.e., the first right-hand side term of the equation) and vice versa. Equations (6) and (7) can be used to extend the argument above to the cross-section. These equations show that any determinants of the value premium or of the ROE spreads (i.e., the second and third right-hand side terms of Equation (5)) should also determine the value spread. However, just as before, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. For instance, there are likely determinants of the value spread that determine the future ROE growth spread, but not the value premium. Similarly, there are likely determinants of the value spread that determine the value premium, but not the future ROE growth spread.  \n\nThe discussion above is at the core of the procedure that I will use to show that the value premium cannot be explained solely by a growth-based driver. The starting point of the extension is to find a determinant of the cross-section of returns that is unlikely to be significantly related to future growth variation. Operating leverage—and in particular labor leverage—is a mechanism that serves well for this purpose and can be proxied by firm-level labor shares.17 One should expect that a frm that has a high labor share and risky cash fows today will continue to have a high labor share and thus risky cash fows for at least some time in the future. Although labor share should be related to the level of ROE, it is not clearly related to future ROE growth. I will explore this property of labor shares to disentangle labor leverage from the value premium and from the ROE growth spread.  \n\n#### 1.2.2 Methodology.  \n\nTo analyze the relation between labor share (LS), the value premium, the ROE level, and growth spreads, I extend CPV's methodology and decompose the left-hand side variable in the identity in Equation (5) into two orthogonal terms: one explained by labor share and the other orthogonal to labor share. This extra decomposition is implemented through crosssectional regressions of bm (i.e., the logarithm of B/M) on contemporaneous LS, as shown below:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathrm{bm}_{i,t}=\\underbrace{\\beta_{0,\\mathrm{t}}+\\beta_{1,\\mathrm{t}}\\mathrm{LS}_{\\mathrm{i,t}}}_{\\mathrm{bm}_{i,t}^{\\parallel}}+\\underbrace{\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{i,t}}}_{\\mathrm{bm}_{i,t}^{\\perp}},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere LS denotes labor share, defined as  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{LS}_{i t}\\equiv\\frac{\\mathrm{XLR}_{i t}}{\\mathrm{OIBDP}_{i t}+\\mathrm{XLR}_{i t}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $X L R$ is the Compustat variable Staff Expense-Total, which I use as a proxy for labor costs,and $O I B D P$ is the Compustat variable Operating income before depreciation. The numerator and denominator in Equation (10) are proxies for labor expenses and value added, respectively. I exclude from the sample all observations in which LS is negative or greater than one.18  \n\nI denote the components of bm explained by and orthogonal to contemporaneous labor share as bm $\\parallel$ and bm $\\cdot^{\\perp}$ , respectively. Equation (9) implies that the sum of the cross-sectional variance of bm $\\parallel$ and bm $^{\\perp}$ equals the cross-sectional variance of bm. I use this fact to estimate the relative weights of $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\parallel}$ and $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\perp}$ to explain the right-hand side terms of decomposition (5). The absolute contributions of $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\parallel}$ and $\\mathrm{bm^{\\perp}}$ to each of the three components of the right-hand side of the decomposition in Equation (5) are estimated using the following FamaMacBeth regressions:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\quad\\sum_{\\mathbf{j}=\\mathbf{\\widetilde{\\Gamma}}}^{\\mathrm{N}}\\rho^{j}\\widetilde{r}_{t+j}=\\beta_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\parallel\\mathrm{r}}\\widetilde{\\mathbf{b}\\mathbf{m}}_{t}^{\\parallel}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\perp,\\mathrm{\\widetilde{r}}}\\widetilde{\\mathbf{b}\\mathbf{m}}_{t}^{\\perp}+\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\parallel\\perp\\mathrm{r}},}\\ &{\\quad-\\left(\\sum_{\\mathbf{j}=\\mathbf{\\widetilde{\\Gamma}}}^{\\mathrm{N}}\\rho^{j}\\right)\\widetilde{e}_{t}=\\beta_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\parallel\\mathrm{e}}\\widetilde{\\mathbf{b}\\mathbf{m}}_{t}^{\\parallel}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\perp\\mathrm{e}}\\widetilde{\\mathbf{b}\\mathbf{m}}_{t}^{\\perp}+\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\parallel\\perp\\mathrm{e}},}\\ &{\\quad-\\sum_{\\mathbf{j}=\\mathbf{\\widetilde{\\Gamma}}}^{\\mathrm{N}}\\rho^{j}\\widetilde{e}g_{t+j}=\\beta_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\parallel\\mathrm{eg}}\\widetilde{\\mathbf{b}\\mathbf{m}}_{t}^{\\parallel}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\perp\\mathrm{eg}}\\widetilde{\\mathbf{b}\\mathbf{m}}_{t}^{\\perp}+\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\parallel\\perp\\mathrm{eg}},}\\ &{\\quad\\rho^{1+\\mathrm{N}}\\widetilde{\\mathbf{b}\\mathbf{m}}_{t+1+\\mathrm{N}}=\\beta_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\parallel\\mathrm{bm}}\\widetilde{\\mathbf{b}\\mathbf{m}}_{t}^{\\parallel}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\perp\\mathrm{bm}}\\widetilde{\\mathbf{b}\\mathbf{m}}_{t}^{\\perp}+\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\parallel\\perp\\mathrm{bm}}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFinally, I convert the estimates from the regressions in Equation (11) above into weights of each of the four components of the baseline decomposition. The weights of the value premium component from Equation (5) that are respectively explained by, or orthogonal to, labor shares are given by  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{reight}_{N}^{\\parallel\\mathrm{r}}=\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\left(\\frac{\\beta_{\\mathrm{N},\\mathrm{t}}^{\\parallel\\mathrm{r}}}{\\beta_{\\mathrm{N},\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{r}}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\widetilde{\\mathrm{bm}}_{t}^{\\parallel}\\right]}{\\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\widetilde{\\mathrm{bm}}_{t}\\right]}\\right)\\quad\\mathrm{~and~}\\quad\\mathrm{weight}_{N}^{\\perp\\mathrm{r}}=\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\left(\\frac{\\beta_{\\mathrm{N},\\mathrm{t}}^{\\perp\\mathrm{r}}}{\\beta_{\\mathrm{N},\\mathrm{t}}^{\\mathrm{r}}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\widetilde{\\mathrm{bm}}_{t}^{\\perp}\\right]}{\\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\widetilde{\\mathrm{bm}}_{t}\\right]}\\right),\n$$  \n\nwhere T represents the number of years in the sample and $\\mathrm{Var}|\\mathbf{x}_{t}|$ indicates the time- $t$ cross-sectional variance of variable $x$ . The weights of the ROE level spread component from Equation (5) that are respectively explained by, and orthogonal to, labor shares are given by  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{reight}_{N}^{\\mathrm{le}}=\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\left(\\frac{\\beta_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\mathrm{le}}}{\\beta_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\mathrm{e}}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\widetilde{\\mathrm{bm}}_{t}^{\\mathrm{\\parallel}}\\right]}{\\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\widetilde{\\mathrm{bm}}_{t}\\right]}\\right)\\quad\\mathrm{~and~}\\quad\\mathrm{weight}_{N}^{\\perp\\mathrm{e}}=\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\left(\\frac{\\beta_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\mathrm{le}}}{\\beta_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\mathrm{e}}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\widetilde{\\mathrm{bm}}_{t}^{\\mathrm{\\perp}}\\right]}{\\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\widetilde{\\mathrm{bm}}_{t}\\right]}\\right).\n$$  \n\nThe weights of the ROE growth spread component from Equation (5) that are respectively  \n\nexplained by, and orthogonal to, labor shares are given by  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{ight}_{N}^{\\parallel\\mathrm{leg}}=\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\left(\\frac{\\beta_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\mathrm{{leg}}}}{\\beta_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\mathrm{eg}}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\widetilde{\\mathrm{bm}}_{t}^{\\parallel}\\right]}{\\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\widetilde{\\mathrm{bm}}_{t}\\right]}\\right)\\quad\\mathrm{~and~}\\quad\\mathrm{weight}_{N}^{\\perp\\mathrm{eg}}=\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\left(\\frac{\\beta_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\perp\\mathrm{eg}}}{\\beta_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\mathrm{eg}}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\widetilde{\\mathrm{bm}}_{t}^{\\perp}\\right]}{\\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\widetilde{\\mathrm{bm}}_{t}\\right]}\\right)\n$$  \n\nThe weights of the value spread persistence component from Equation (5) that are respectively explained by, and orthogonal to, labor shares are given by  \n\n$$\nw\\mathrm{eight}_{N}^{\\mathrm{{lism}}}=\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\left(\\frac{\\beta_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\mathrm{{lism}}}}{\\beta_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\mathrm{{e}}}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\widetilde{\\mathrm{bm}}_{t}^{\\mathrm{{li}}}\\right]}{\\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\widetilde{\\mathrm{bm}}_{t}\\right]}\\right)\\quad\\mathrm{~and~}\\quad\\mathrm{weight}_{N}^{\\perp\\mathrm{{bm}}}=\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\left(\\frac{\\beta_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\perp\\mathrm{{bm}}}}{\\beta_{\\mathrm{N,t}}^{\\mathrm{{bm}}}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\widetilde{\\mathrm{bm}}_{t}^{\\mathrm{{lism}}}\\right]}{\\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\widetilde{\\mathrm{bm}}_{t}\\right]}\\right),\n$$  \n\nBecause,byconstruction,Var $\\left[\\widetilde{\\mathrm{bm}}_{t}^{\\parallel}\\right]+\\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\widetilde{\\mathrm{bm}}_{t}^{\\perp}\\right]=\\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\widetilde{\\mathrm{bm}}_{t}\\right]$ , it follows that weight $_{N}^{\\parallel\\mathrm{{r}}}+$ weight $\\mathbf{\\omega}_{N}^{\\textnormal{\\perp r}}=1$ , wight $\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathbf{\\rho}_{N}^{\\mathrm{||e}}+\\mathrm{weight}_{N}^{\\mathrm{\\perpe}}=1}\\end{array}$ ver $\\mathrm{ight}_{N}^{\\parallel\\mathrm{eg}}+\\mathrm{weight}_{N}^{\\perp\\mathrm{eg}}=1$ and weightl + weightm 1, which justifies the interpretation of the left-hand side variables of Equations (12), (13), (14), and (15) as representing relative weights within each component of the baseline decomposition.  \n\n#### 1.2.3 Results of the extended decomposition.  \n\nTable 1, panel B, presents the results from the extended decomposition. The results of this panel are structured in four pairs of columns, and each pair is associated with a different component from the baseline decomposition represented by the four columns in panel A. The time horizon N used in the extended decomposition is represented by the different rows of panel B. Figure 8 provides a visual representation of the point estimates from the extended decomposition.  \n\nThe first set of results, which are related to the value premium, are presented in the first pair of columns in Table 1, panel B, and in the left plot from Figure 8, panel A. The extended decomposition suggests that the subcomponent of bm explained by labor share (bm $\\parallel$ )explains around $54\\%$ of the value premium when I consider a 1-year horizon, and around $31\\%$ when I consider a 15-year horizon. Conversely, the subcomponent of bm not explained by labor share ( $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\perp}$ ) explains 46% and 69% of the value premium over the 1- and 15-year horizons, respectively. Interestingly, despite the similar order of magnitude of the components explained and not explained by labor share, the table shows that the value premium weights explained by $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\parallel}$ are statistically significant at the $1\\%$ level at shorter horizons (i.e., up to 5 years), whereas those explained by $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\perp}$ are not statistically different from zero even at a 10% significance level.  \n\nThe third and fourth columns of Table 1, panel B, and in the left plot from Figure 8, panel B, are related to the ROE growth spread. The extended decomposition suggests that the subcomponent of bm explained by labor share ( $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\parallel}$ ) explains around 6% of the ROE growth spread when I consider a 1-year horizon, and it explains up to roughly 19% when I consider a 15-year horizon. Conversely, the subcomponent of bm not explained by labor share (bm $\\bot$ ) explains 94% and 81% of the ROE growth spread over the same time windows, respectively.  \n\nThe next set of results are related to the ROE level spread. These results are presented in the third pair of columns in Table 1, panel C, and in the left plot from Figure 8, panel C. The extended decomposition suggests that the subcomponent of bm explained by labor share $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\parallel}$ ) explains around 23% of the contemporaneous ROE level spread while the subcomponent of bm not explained by labor share ( $\\mathrm{bm^{\\perp}}$ ) explains 77% of the ROE level spread.  \n\nThe results presented in the first six columns of Table 1 jointly suggest that while both $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\parallel}$ and $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\perp}$ are related to discount rates and help explain the value premium, the component of bm that is orthogonal to labor leverage is the component that is most closely related to contemporaneous ROE levels and future ROE growth. Given that the components of the decompositions related to ROE have leading negative signs in Equation (5), these results indicate that ROE levels in high-bm $\\bot$ firms are expected to have lower levels of subsequent growth than the ROE levels in low-bm $\\bot$ firms.  \n\nThe last pair of columns in Table 1, panel B, presents the decomposition of the residual of the cross-sectional variation in future bm, which can be attributed to the value spread persistence. The results indicate that the component of bm orthogonal to labor leverage explains most of the value spread persistence component.  \n\nTaken as a whole, the findings in Table 1, panel B, indicate the existence of (at least) two fundamentally different classes of mechanisms that drive the value premium. One class, which is related to labor leverage as proxied by labor share, seems to explain around $50\\%$ Oof the value premium but under 20% of the ROE growth spread and around 23% of the ROE level spread. The other class, which is orthogonal to labor leverage, explains the remaining $50\\%$ of the value premium and seems to be much more closely related to determinants of cross-sectional variation in firm profitability and firm growth.  \n\n### 1.3 Characteristics of frms sorted on bm, $\\mathbf{bm}^{\\parallel}$ ,and bm $\\bot$  \n\nThis section studies differences in the characteristics of firms sorted on bm, and on the components of bm explained ( $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\parallel}$ )and not explained( $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\perp}$ )by labor shares.Table 2 reports time-series averages of average characteristics for quintiles of firms in the data.  \n\nTable 2 reports time-series averages of average characteristics for quintiles of frms sorted by log book-to-market ratio (bm, panel A) and by the components of bm explained by ( $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\parallel}$ ， panel B) and orthogonal to (bm $^{\\perp}$ , panel C) LS. The quintiles are identified in the first column of the table, and they range from $L$ (low) to $H$ (high). The next three columns show the average bm, $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\parallel}$ , and $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\perp}$ across the quintiles. The table suggests that bm $\\perp$ captures a significant portion of the variation in bm across the quintiles.19 This is not surprising, given that labor share should be related to labor leverage, which is just one of possibly many other drivers of the cross-sectional variation in bm. In fact, the fourth column of panel A shows that LS has no monotonic trend across the quintiles.  \n\nThe fifth column of Table 2 reports the average log market value of equity. One can see that the market value of equity is decreasing across the quintiles in the three panels. However, $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\parallel}$ is less negatively related to market size than bm or bm . Another distinctive feature of $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\parallel}$ is that average log asset values are decreasing across the quintiles, whereas there is no such a trend for quintiles formed on bm. Although this finding is outside the scope of the model, it is consistent with the lower capital intensity and the greater measures of intangibles of high labor share firms, as documented by Donangelo et al. (2019). Financial leverage is significantly increasing across bm quintiles, and this seems to be driven exclusively by its component that is not explained by labor shares. In fact, financial leverage is decreasing across bm\" quintiles, which is consistent with a possible trade-off between financial and labor leverage. Labor leverage affects both stock returns and the volatility of cash fow growth; therefore, it should also affect optimal capital structure decisions. In particular, when the owners of a firm face a trade-off between labor leverage and financial leverage, high labor share firms should have lower financial leverage levels than their low labor share counterparts.20  \n\nTable 2, panel A, shows that profit margins and investment rates are both decreasing over the bm quintiles. Low profit margins and high investment rates are intuitively associated with high operating leverage and growth opportunities, respectively, which are two traditional drivers for the value spread. Panels B and C provide evidence consistent with the idea that the two bm components-bm $||$ and bm $\\bot$ contain fundamentally different information about labor leverage and growth opportunities.  \n\nThe next section proposes a production model of a firm that combines labor leverage and different drivers of profitability and growth, which provides the theoretical support for the empirical findings presented in this section.  \n\n## 2 Model  \n\nI consider an extension of the model in Donangelo et al. (2019) to interpret the empirical findings presented in the previous section. One departure point from that model is to consider capital accumulation through investments. A second departure point is the inclusion of two independent regime-switching processes that drive cross-sectional differences in growth rates across firms. The first regime-switching process is aggregate and drives the failure of the both the conditional CAPM and the unconditional CAPM in explaining the value premium. The second regime-switching process is firm specific and represents the drivers that complement labor leverage in explaining cross-sectional differences in returns and growth rates. At the end of this section, I present a calibration exercise that shows how this extended model can generate the value premium decomposition moments, as well as a number of relevant financial and macroeconomic moments, that are comparable to those found in the data.  \n\n### 2.1 Setup  \n\nI follow Berk et al. (1999) by considering the pricing kernel as exogenous in order to maintain the tractability of the model and to maintain my focus on the effect of micro-level decisions on firm risk. The dynamics of the pricing kernel $\\Lambda$ are givenby  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\Lambda_{t}}{\\Lambda_{t}}=-r d t-\\eta[\\vartheta_{t}]d Z_{t}^{\\Lambda},\n$$  \n\nwhere $r>0$ is the instantaneous risk-free rate, $\\eta>0$ represents the market price of risk in the economy, and $Z^{\\Lambda}$ is a Wiener process that represents the single source of priced risk in the economy. The systematic two-state Markov process $\\vartheta$ governs the level of the market price of risk and the purchase cost of capital. This shock is introduced to drive the failure of the CAPM to explain the value premium in the model. The two states are $\\vartheta\\in\\{\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{good}},\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{bad}}\\}$ . The market price of risk is lower in the $\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{good}}$ state than in the $\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{bad}}$ ， $\\eta[\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{good}}]\\leq\\eta[\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{bad}}]$ . The process $\\vartheta$ is orthogonal to all other stochastic processes in the model. The transition probability of the process $\\vartheta$ over an infinitesimal time interval $d t$ is symmetric and is given by  \n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{1-p_{\\vartheta}d t}&{p_{\\vartheta}d t}\\ {p_{\\vartheta}d t}&{1-p_{\\vartheta}d t}\\end{array}\\right],\n$$  \n\nwhere $p_{\\vartheta}\\geq0$ is the transition intensity from states $\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{bad}}$ to $\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{good}}$ and from $\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{good}}$ to $\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{bad}}$  \n\nThe model represents a small wage- and price-taking firm that continuously optimizes labor hiring and capital investment. Labor $L$ is combined with capital $K$ to generatevalue added $Y$ according to the following constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function:  \n\n$$\nY_{t}=\\left(\\alpha(X_{t}L_{t})^{\\frac{\\theta-1}{\\theta}}+(1-\\alpha)K_{t}^{\\frac{\\theta-1}{\\theta}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta-1}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $L>0$ and $K>0$ denote the labor and capital employed in production, $X$ denotes the labor-augmenting productivity, $\\alpha\\in(0,1)$ captures the weight of labor in the productive technology, and $\\theta\\in(0,\\infty)$ denotes the labor-capital elasticity of substitution. The production function in Equation (18) nests the widely used Cobb-Douglas production function when $\\theta\\rightarrow1$ , which is the knife-edge case in which labor and capital are not complements nor substitutes to each another. The case in which $\\theta>1$ implies that capital and labor are strictly substitutes. The case in which the elasticity $\\theta<1$ is the most empirically relevant, because it implies that capital and labor are strictly complements.?21 Operating profits are given by $Y_{t}-W_{t}L_{t}$  \n\nCapital $K$ follows the law of motion given by  \n\n$$\nd K_{t}=K_{t}(1-\\delta)d t+\\iota_{\\mathrm{s,t}}d t+\\iota_{\\mathrm{p,t}}d t,\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\delta\\in[0,1)$ is the depreciation rate, ${\\iota_{\\mathrm{s}}}\\leq0$ is disinvestment (i.e., sale of capital), and $\\iota_{\\mathrm{p}}\\geq0$ is investment (i.e., purchase of capital). The investment decision is subject to  \n\nadjustment costs and to partial capital reversibility as in Abel and Eberly (1994) and Abel and Eberly (1997), and is given by the investment cost function  \n\n$$\n\\Phi\\left[\\iota_{\\mathrm{s,t}},\\iota_{\\mathrm{p,t}},\\vartheta_{t}\\right]=\\frac{c_{\\mathrm{k}}}{2}\\left(\\iota_{\\mathrm{s,t}}^{2}+\\iota_{\\mathrm{p,t}}^{2}\\right)+\\iota_{\\mathrm{s,t}}\\kappa_{\\mathrm{s}}+\\iota_{\\mathrm{p,t}}\\kappa_{\\mathrm{p}}[\\vartheta_{t}],\n$$  \n\nwhere $c_{\\mathrm{k}}\\geq0$ is a nonnegative constant related to the level of capital adjustment costs and $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{s}}~\\geq~0$ and $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{p}}~>~0$ are the prices at which the firm is able to sell and purchase capital, respectively. To rule out arbitrage opportunities in the market for capital, the selling price is restricted to be equal or lower than the purchasing price, $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{s}}\\leq\\kappa_{\\mathrm{p}}$ . The wedge between the purchase and selling prices of capital captures the degree of irreversibility of capital. The extreme case of fully reversible capital is given by $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{p}}~=~\\kappa_{\\mathrm{s}}$ and the extreme case of fully irreversible capital is given by $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{s}}~=~0$ . The case with partial capital reversibility is given by $0<\\kappa_{\\mathrm{s}}<\\kappa_{\\mathrm{p}}$ . The purchase price of capital is driven by the aggregate regime $\\vartheta$ Specifically, the purchase price of capital is higher in the good regime than in the bad regime, $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{p}}[\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{good}}]\\geq\\kappa_{\\mathrm{p}}[\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{bad}}]$  \n\nProductivity, $X$ , follows the diffusion process given by  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d X_{t}}{X_{t}}=\\mu_{\\mathrm{x}}[\\omega_{t}]d t+\\sigma_{\\mathrm{x}}\\rho_{\\mathrm{x}}d Z_{t}^{\\Lambda}+\\sigma_{\\mathrm{x}}\\sqrt{1-\\rho_{\\mathrm{x}}^{2}}d Z_{t}^{\\mathrm{x}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mu_{\\mathrm{x}}$ and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{x}}$ are the drift and volatility of productivity growth, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{x}}$ represents the pricedrisk loading of productivity growth, and $Z^{\\mathrm{{x}}}$ is a Wiener proces that is idiosyncratic (i.e., frm specific) and orthogonal to $Z^{\\Lambda}$ (i.e., $\\operatorname{E}[d Z^{\\mathrm{x}}d Z^{\\mathrm{\\Lambda}}]=0$ ). The growth rate of productivity, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{X}}$ is determined by a firm-specific two-state Markov process $\\omega$ . The process $\\omega$ is orthogonal to all other stochastic processes in the model, $Z^{\\Lambda},Z^{\\mathrm{x}},Z^{\\mathrm{w}}$ , and $\\vartheta$ . The state space for $\\omega$ is given by $\\omega\\in\\{\\omega^{\\mathrm{fast}},\\omega^{\\mathrm{slow}}\\}$ , where the superscripts refer to firm-specific states of fast and a slow productivity growth: $\\mu_{\\mathrm{x}}[\\omega^{\\mathrm{tast}}]\\geq\\mu_{\\mathrm{x}}[\\omega^{\\mathrm{slow}}]$ . The transition probability of the process $\\omega$ over an infinitesimal time interval $d t$ is symmetric and is given by  \n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{1-p_{\\omega}d t}&{p_{\\omega}d t}\\ {p_{\\omega}d t}&{1-p_{\\omega}d t}\\end{array}\\right],\n$$  \n\nwhere $p_{\\omega}\\geq0$ is the transition intensity from states $\\omega^{\\mathrm{fast}}$ to $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}^{\\mathrm{slow}}$ and from $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}^{\\mathrm{slow}}$ to $\\omega^{\\mathrm{fast}}$  \n\nThe firm has access to a perfectly competitive labor market, so it must always pay the current level of aggregate wages to its workers. The dynamics of aggregate wages $W$ are givenby  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d W_{t}}{W_{t}}=\\mu_{\\mathrm{w}}{d t}+\\sigma_{\\mathrm{w}}\\rho_{\\mathrm{w}}{d\\boldsymbol{Z}_{t}^{\\Lambda}}+\\sigma_{\\mathrm{w}}\\sqrt{1-\\rho_{\\mathrm{w}}^{2}}{d\\boldsymbol{Z}_{t}^{\\mathrm{w}}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mu_{\\mathrm{w}}$ and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{w}}$ are the drift and volatility of wage growth, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{w}}$ represents the pricedrisk loading of wage growth, and $Z^{\\mathrm{w}}$ is a Wiener process that captures the component of aggregate wage growth shocks that is not priced (i.e., $\\operatorname{E}[d Z^{\\mathrm{w}}d Z]=0$ 一  \n\nFinally, firms are subject to technology obsolescence shocks in which productivity (and thus firm value) suddenly collapse to zero. Technology obsolescence is an absorbing state that is triggered by an idiosyncratic shock that follows a Poisson process with instantaneous intensity $\\lambda_{d}d t$ . The firm obsolescence process is introduced in the model to avoid numerical problems in the calibration exercise presented at the end of the section.22  \n\n### 2.2 Model solution  \n\n#### 2.2.1  Labor input optimization and labor share.  \n\nCapital owners maximize the value of the frm by continuously optimizing the amount of labor employed in production (L) in order to maximize operating profits $\\Pi_{t}$ .The optimal employment level is such that the marginal product of labor equals the marginal cost of  \n\nlabor: d = W. Optimal labor demand is given by  \n\n$$\nL_{t}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{\\frac{K_{t}}{X_{t}}\\left(\\frac{1-\\Psi_{t}}{\\Psi_{t}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha}\\right)^{\\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}},}&{0<\\Psi_{t}<\\overline{{\\Psi}},}\\ {0,}&{\\Psi_{t}\\ge\\overline{{\\Psi}},}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\Psi_{t}\\equiv\\alpha^{\\theta}\\left(\\frac{W_{t}}{X_{t}}\\right)^{1-\\theta}\n$$  \n\nis the firm's labor share and where $\\overline{{\\Psi}}=1$ is the labor share threshold for firms’ operational status: active when  <V and temporaril inactive otherwise.23  \n\nThe definition in Equation (25) indicates that labor share is negatively related to productivity (i.e., $\\textstyle{\\frac{\\partial\\Psi}{\\partial X}}<0$ ) when labor and capital are strict complements (i.e., $\\theta<1$ ). This is the case focused in this paper. Figure 1 illustrates the negative relation between labor share and productivity.24 To highlight the importance of the assumption that labor and capital are complements for the implications of the model, Figure 1 also illustrates the Cobb-Douglas case $\\theta=1$ ), in which labor share is constant, and the case in which labor and capital are strict substitutes ( $\\theta>1$ ), in which labor share is positively related to productivity.  \n\n#### 2.2.2 Operating profits and firm value.  \n\nThe labor-optimized operating profits $\\Pi$ are given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\Pi_{t}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{(1-\\alpha)K_{t}\\left(\\frac{1-\\Psi_{t}}{1-\\alpha}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1-\\theta}},}&{0<\\Psi_{t}<\\overline{{\\Psi}},}\\ {0,}&{\\Psi_{t}\\ge\\overline{{\\Psi}},}\\end{array}\\right.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nEquation (26) shows that the operating profits are strictly positive when the frm is active (i.e., $\\Psi_{t}<\\overline{{\\Psi}}$ ) and zero otherwise. For an active firm, the assumption that labor and capital are strict complements (i.e., $\\theta<1$ )implies a negative relation between labor share and operating profits. Figure 2 illustrates this negative relation.  \n\nThe value of the firm is defined as the discounted stream of dividends, as given by  \n\n$$\nV[\\psi_{t},K_{t},\\omega_{t},\\vartheta_{t}]\\equiv\\operatorname*{max}_{\\{\\iota_{\\mathrm{s},\\tau},\\iota_{\\mathrm{p},\\tau}\\}_{\\tau=t}^{\\infty}}\\left\\{\\mathrm{E}_{t}\\left[\\int_{t}^{\\infty}\\left(\\frac{\\Lambda_{\\tau}}{\\Lambda_{t}}\\right)D_{\\tau}d\\tau\\right]\\right\\},\n$$  \n\nwhere $D_{t}\\equiv\\Pi_{t}-\\Phi[\\iota_{\\mathrm{s},\\tau},\\iota_{\\mathrm{p},\\tau},\\vartheta_{t}]$ is the labor-optimized free cash flow distributed to the capital owners as dividends. Appendix A presents solutions to the optimal investment and disinvestment decisions and the solution to firm value.  \n\nFigure 3 illustrates the negative relation between firm value and labor share. This relation is driven by the fact that a firm's labor share provides information not only about cash fow level—as illustrated in illustrated by Figure 2—-but also about cash fow risk. In particular, high labor share frms are, in part, less valuable, because they are more exposed to priced risk. To see why, consider how the level of labor share affects the dynamics of operating profit growth, which is obtained by applying Ito's lemma to Equation (26) and shown below:  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\frac{d\\Pi_{t}}{\\Pi_{t}}=\\mu_{\\Pi}[\\omega_{t}]d t+\\sigma_{\\Pi,t}^{\\mathrm{A}}d Z_{t}+\\sigma_{\\Pi,u}^{\\mathrm{x}}d Z_{t}^{\\mathrm{X}}+\\sigma_{\\Pi,u}^{\\mathrm{W}}d Z_{t}^{\\mathrm{W}},}\\ &{\\mu_{\\Pi}[\\omega_{t}]\\equiv\\left(\\frac{1}{1-\\theta}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\Psi_{t}}{1-\\Psi_{t}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{\\Psi}^{2}}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\Psi_{t}}{1-\\Psi_{t}}\\right)-\\mu_{\\Psi}[\\omega_{t}]\\right),}\\ &{\\sigma_{\\Pi,t}^{\\mathrm{A}}\\equiv\\left(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{x}}\\rho_{\\mathrm{x}}-\\sigma_{\\mathrm{w}}\\rho_{\\mathrm{w}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\Psi_{t}}{1-\\Psi_{t}}\\right),}\\ &{\\sigma_{\\Pi,t}^{\\mathrm{X}}\\equiv\\sigma_{\\mathrm{x}}\\sqrt{1-\\rho_{\\mathrm{x}}^{2}}\\left(\\frac{\\Psi_{t}}{1-\\Psi_{t}}\\right),\\mathrm{and}}\\ &{\\sigma_{\\Pi,t}^{\\mathrm{W}}\\equiv-\\sigma_{\\mathrm{w}}\\sqrt{1-\\rho_{\\mathrm{w}}^{2}}\\left(\\frac{\\Psi_{t}}{1-\\Psi_{t}}\\right),}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\begin{array}{r}{\\mu_{\\Psi}\\equiv\\left(\\left(\\theta-1\\right)\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{X}}-\\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{X}}^{2}}{2}-\\mu_{\\mathrm{W}}+\\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{W}}^{2}}{2}\\right)+\\frac{\\sigma_{\\Psi}^{2}}{2}\\right)}\\end{array}$ and $\\sigma_{\\Psi}\\equiv(1-\\theta)\\sqrt{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{x}}^{2}-2\\rho_{\\mathrm{x}}\\rho_{\\mathrm{w}}\\sigma_{\\mathrm{x}}\\sigma_{\\mathrm{w}}+\\sigma_{\\mathrm{w}}^{2}}$ are the drift and volatility of labor share growth, $\\frac{d\\Psi}{\\Psi}$ . The term $\\sigma_{\\Pi}^{\\Lambda}$ in Equation (28) determines the exposure of cash fow growth to priced risk. The definition of $\\sigma_{\\Pi}^{\\Lambda}$ shows that when productivity growth is more exposed to priced risk than to wage growth (i.e., $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{x}}\\rho_{\\mathrm{x}}>\\sigma_{\\mathrm{w}}\\rho_{\\mathrm{w}},$ ， then the exposure of cash fow growth to priced risk is increasing in labor share. This last implication is at the core of the labor leverage mechanism that implies a positive cross-sectional relation between labor share and expected returns.?5 Figure 3 also shows that firm value is higher in the good aggregate state $(\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{good}})$ , in which the market price of risk is lower, relative to the bad aggregate state $(\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{bad}}$ ), in which the market price of risk is lower. The figure also shows that, all else equal, value is higher for firms under fast growth ( $\\stackrel{\\cdot}{\\omega}^{\\mathrm{tast}}$ ) relative to that of firms under slow growth $(\\omega^{\\mathrm{slow}})$  \n\nThe book value of a firm follows the law of motion given by  \n\n$$\nd B_{t}=B_{t}(1-\\delta)d t+\\Phi\\left[\\iota_{\\mathrm{s,t}},\\iota_{\\mathrm{p,t}}\\right]d t,\n$$  \n\nThe equation above implies that, consistent with its data counterpart, book value in the model is defined as the historical cost of the firm's net capital stock. The book-to-market in the model is defined as the ratio between book value from Equation (29) and firm value from Equation (27).  \n\nFigure 4 illustrates the relation between B/M and labor share, the aggregate state $\\vartheta$ ， and the firm-specific growth regime $\\omega$ . In the figure, the book value is kept fixed and set to one, so that B/M acts simply as the inverse of firm value shown in (3). Specifically, the figure shows a positive relation between labor share and B/M ratios. The figure also shows that B/M ratios are lower in the good aggregate state $(\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{good}})$ relative to those in the bad aggregate state $(\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{bad}})$ . Lastly, the figure shows that B/M ratios are lower for fast growing $(\\omega^{\\mathrm{{tast}}})$ firms relatively to slow growing firms $(\\omega^{\\mathrm{slow}})$  \n\n# << Figure 4 here >>  \n\nFigure 5 illustrates the relation between the expected instantaneous profit growth and labor share and the productivity growth regime $\\omega$ . As expected, the profit growth is higher for firms under fast productivity growth $(\\omega^{\\mathrm{{tast}}}$ ) than for firms under slow productivity growth $(\\omega^{\\mathrm{slow}})$ . The figure also suggests that the growth regime $\\omega$ provides more information about future profit growth than labor share $\\Psi$ , in particular for firms that are far from the inactive region threshold $\\Psi=1$ . As shown in Equation (25), labor share is entirely determined by the levels, and not the growth rates, of wages and productivity. However, the figure shows that the labor share is positively related to expected future profit growth, in particular for firms closer to the active/inactive operational threshold. In fact, expected future profit growth tends to infinity as labor share tends to one, because operating profits reach their minimum of zero at the operational threshold.26  \n\nAs discussed above, labor share $\\Psi$ helps explain frm value and book-to-market ratios because it provides information about current cash fow levels and about expected returns. Figure 6 qualitatively illustrates the positive relation between expected returns and labor share $\\Psi$ . The figure also shows how expected returns are higher in the bad aggregate state $(\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{bad}})$ , in which the market price of risk is higher, than in the good aggregate state $(\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{good}})$ ， in which the market price of risk is lower. The figure also illustrates how the firm-specific growth regime $\\omega$ also affects expected returns. Fast growing frms are safer and have lower expected returns because their labor leverage is expected to growth more slowly (or decline more rapidly) than that of slow growing firms.  \n\n# << Figure 6 here >>  \n\n### 2.3 Model calibration  \n\nThe discussion in the previous section focuses on the comparative statics of the analytical model solution. This section presents the results of a numerical exercise based on artificial data from a large number of simulations, each of which represents a large panel of firms. The model is calibrated to minimize the distance between the moments constructed from artificial data generated by the model and the moments constructed from real-world data. In particular, the main goal of the calibration presented in this section is to verify that the model can, under reasonable parameter values, produce point estimates from the baseline and extended value spread decompositions that are close to those presented in Table 1. In addition, this calibration exercise attempts to match the moments related to macroeconomic variables and stock returns, which are described in Appendix D.  \n\n#### 2.3.1 Calibration procedure.  \n\nThe calibrated procedure is as follows: I first run 1,0oo simulations, each consisting of the histories of 1,000 firms over 66 years at a monthly frequency. The initial levels of productivity, wages, and capital are identical for all firm at the start of each simulation and for new firms that replace firms hit by obsolescence shocks. The first 50 years of each simulation are discarded and are only used to generate the cross-sectional distributions of firm-level productivity, wages, and capital. The simulated variables from the last 16 years of each simulation, which I denote years $t=0$ , .., 15, are then converted from monthly to annual frequency. Firms with over 5 years of age between years $t=0$ and $t=16$ are then used in the decomposition. At $t=0$ $1$ form twenty portfolios of firms sorted by their lagged bookto-market ratios and construct the variables used in the decomposition up to year $t=15$ Finally, the constructed variables of each simulation are combined into a single synthetic data set used to produce a total of 90 synthetic moments that target moments from the data. Table 5 reports these moments, which I will discuss later.  \n\nThe model simulation requires the definition of 24 parameters values, all of which are shown in Table 3. Of these 24 parameters, 7 are not calibrated and are instead fixed. The risk-free rate $r$ is set to 0.02. The initial level of capital of a new firm $\\mathrm{K}_{0}\\mathrm{~=~}0$ (i.e., new firms start with no capital). The initial levels of productivity ( $\\mathrm{X}_{0}=2.305$ ) and wages ( $\\mathrm{W}_{0}=$ 1) are set so that the initial labor share in the sample matches that from the data. The labor-capital elasticity of substitution, $\\theta$ , is fixed at 0.40, which is close to the center of the range of estimates reported in the literature (e.g., Leon-Ledesma et al. 2010; Klump et al. 2012). The technological obsolescence rate $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}$ is set to 0.02 which is consistent with the literature (e.g., Carlson et al. 2004). The capital depreciation rate $\\delta$ is set to 0.12, which is the value used in Belo et al. (2014).  \n\nThe remaining seventeen parameters shown in Table 3 are calibrated to fit the moments from the data. The aggregate regime-switching process is included in the model to represent time variation in discount rates and investment specific shocks. The table shows that the calibration produces two distinct productivity growth regimes. The transition probability across the bad and good states, $p_{\\vartheta}$ , is 0.096. The market price of risk is $\\eta[\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{bad}}]=0.774$ in the bad state and $\\eta[\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{good}}]=0.001$ in the good state.  \n\nThe parameters that are related to the second moments of productivity growth ( $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{x}}$ and $\\rho_{\\mathrm{x}}$ ) and of wage growth ( $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{w}}$ and $\\rho_{\\mathrm{w}}$ ) are jointly determined as to match the target moments related to macroeconomic variables shown in Table 5. The firm-specific two-state regimeswitching process is included in the model to drive cross-sectional variation in expected future cash fow growth rates. Table 3 shows that the calibration produces two distinct productivity growth regimes. The symmetric transition probability across these two states, $p_{\\omega}$ , is 0.233, which indicates that the regimes are somewhat persistent. The parameter values for the drift of the productivity growth rate in each of these states indicate that the two regimes incidentally corroborate the labels used (i.e., good and bad). Productivity growth is lower in the slow growth state $\\mu_{\\mathrm{X}}[\\omega^{\\mathrm{slow}}]=0.021$ than in the fast growth state $\\mu_{\\mathrm{X}}[\\omega^{\\mathrm{tast}}]=0.029$ . The drift of wage growth rate $\\mu_{\\mathrm{w}}=0.008$ and the weight of labor in the production function $\\alpha=0.364$ are mainly determined the average level and the average cross-sectional standard deviation of labor share in the sample. The adjustment cost multiplier $c=0.068$ , the sale price of capital $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{s}}=0.180$ , and the purchase prices of capital in the bad state $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{p}}[\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{bad}}]=0.803$ and good state $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{p}}[\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{good}}]=2.495$ are mainly driven by the cross-sectional moments related to investment rate and by the decomposition weights. Finally, the value of the constant $\\rho$ is set to 0.923 so that the sum of the three components of the baseline decomposition is approximately one across the horizons.  \n\n# << Table 3 here >>  \n\nTable 4, which is the model counterpart of Table 2 reports time-series averages of average characteristics for quintiles of firms sorted by log book-to-market ratio (bm, panel A) and by the components of bm explained by (bm $\\parallel$ , panel B) and orthogonal to (bm $\\cdot^{\\perp}$ , panel C) LS. As in the data, $\\mathrm{bm^{\\perp}}$ from the model captures most of the variation in bm across the quintiles.27 The model also generates a profit margin spread from $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\parallel}$ that is more negative than those from bm or $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\perp}$ . In addition, the model is able to generate investment rate spreads from bm or $\\mathrm{bm^{\\perp}}$ that are negative and no investment spread from $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\parallel}$ . This last result shows that most of the negative relation between bm and investment rates seems to be driven by thecomponent of $b m$ orthogonal to LS (bm $\\cdot^{\\perp}$ 一  \n\n#### 2.3.2  Overview of moments targeted by model calibration.  \n\nTable 5 presents a summary of the 90 moments targeted by the model. For clarity, these moments are grouped in eight separate panels, which I describe below.  \n\nPanels A (Moments from baseline decomposition) and B (Moments from extended decomposition) of Table 5 present the point estimates from the baseline and extended decompositions in the calibrated model. The target moments in these panels are the point estimates from the decompositions in the data, which are presented panels A and B of Table 1. In each of the decompositions, I select as target moments the point estimates from the 1-, 5-, and 15-year horizon decompositions. I discuss in greater detail the performance of the calibrated model in matching the target moments related to the decompositions in the next section.  \n\nPanel C (Characteristics of the 20 B/M-sorted portfolios from decompositions) of Table 5 presents the cross-sectional variance, cross-sectional persistence, and the autocorrelation of log B / M, log of $1+$ ROE, and the investment rate, as well as the average $R$ -squared of crosssectional regressions of labor share on B/M. Overall, the model is successful at matching this group of moments.  \n\nPanel D (Macroeconomic moments） of Table 5 presents the volatility and correlations of gross domestic product (GDP) (i.e., aggregate output) growth, by wage growth (i.e., the growth in the mean worker-weighted wages across firms), and by productivity growth. I estimate the simulated total factor productivity (TFP) to mimic the TFP measurement from the data, $G D P\\big/(L^{(1-.594)})$ , where L represents aggregate labor, and by the mean and crosssectional standard deviation of labor share.28 Overall, the calibrated model is able to match 28 Appendix D presents additional details about the construction of the moments from Table 5, panels the magnitudes of the macroeconomic moments and moments related to the cross-section of labor shares.  \n\nPanel E (Asset returns of equal-weighted LS-quintile portfolios) of Table 5 presents the average excess asset returns of the equal-weighted quintile portfolios of firms sorted on lagged labor share as well as the portfolio with a long position in the top LS-quintile portfolio and a short position in the bottom LS-quintile portfolio.29 The calibrated model is able to match reasonably well the unlevered returns of the LS-quintile portfolios.  \n\nPanel F (Equity returns of value-weighted B/M-quintile portfolios) of Table 5 presents the average equity excess return of value-weighted quintile portfolios of frms sorted on lagged B/M. The target moments are based on the average returns of the value-weighted B/M quintile portfolios from Kenneth French's data library over the years 1963 and 2017. The asset returns of the B/M quintile portfolios from the model are converted to equity returns using Compustat financial leverage data. The calibrated model produces a close match to the average equity returns of the B/M-quintile portfolios from the data.  \n\nPanel  G (Conditional  CAPM estimates of value-weighted B/M-quintile portfolios) presents the average annual alphas and betas of the conditional CAPM of the value-weighted B/M-quintile portfolios presented in panel F. The conditional CAPM is estimated annually with monthly data following the procedure in Lewellen and Nagel (2006).3o The positive average conditional alpha of the portfolio that is long the top B/M-quintile portfolio and short the bottom B/M-quintile portfolio (\\*HML\" portfolio) is consistent although higher than that of the data (0.906% in the model vs. 0.812% in the data). The positive average conditional alpha of the HML portfolio suggests that the conditional CAPM fails to price the returns of the B/M-quintile portfolios, both in the data and in the model. The failure of the conditional CAPM also can be seen in the low average conditional CAPM beta of the HML (0.253 in the model vs. 0.231 in the data). The conditional CAPM fails in the model because of the existence of priced technological shocks embodied in new capital (i.e., IST shocks) that are not subsumed by the market factor. As discussed in Kogan and Papanikolaou (2013, 2014), the returns of the market portfolio do not subsume IST shocks because value and growth firms have differential exposure to such shocks.  \n\nPanel H (Unconditional CAPM estimates of value-weighted B/M-quintile portfolios) presents the alphas and betas of the unconditional CAPM of the same portfolios used in the tests presented in panel G. The failure of the unconditional CAPM is more evident than that of the conditional CAPM, as suggested by the wide alphas of the HML portfolio (3.866% in the model vs. 4.277% in the data). The same reasons that make the conditional CAPM fail in the model also make the unconditional CAPM (e.g., the existence of priced shocks orthogonal to the returns of the market portfolio). In addition, the fact that the conditional beta of the HML portfolio is strongly positively correlated with the market portfolio represents another source of model misspecification that exacerbates the failure of the unconditional CAPM relative to the conditional CAPM.  \n\nOverall, Table 5 shows that the calibrated model is successful at quantitatively explaining a large number of moments from the data, many of which are new to the literature. In the next section I discuss in greater detail the results from the decompositions using data from the calibrated model.  \n\n# << Table 5 here >>  \n\n#### 2.3.3  Decomposition results from the model's calibration.  \n\nPanels A and B of Table 5 report the results of the baseline and extended value spread decompositions using artificial data generated from the calibrated model for horizons of 1, 5, and 15 years. Earnings in the model-generated data are defined as in Fama and French (1995) as profits net of depreciation costs ( $P_{t}=\\Pi_{\\mathrm{t}}-B_{\\mathrm{t}}\\delta$ 一  \n\nPanel A of Table 5 shows the results of the baseline decomposition. The baseline decomposition using simulated data achieves moments that are fairly close to the target moments from the data, which are reported in panel A of Table 1.  \n\nFigure 7 provides a visual comparison of the baseline decomposition results from the data (panel A) and from the model (first panel). The figures on the left of each panel show that the model can reproduce moments consistent with those from the original value spread decomposition from CPV. In particular, the figures show that the ROE spread is the main driver of the value spread, especially when considering longer horizons. The component of the value spread explained by the cross-section of stock returns (i.e., the value spread) has relatively less explanatory power over the value spread, even though its significance also increases over longer horizons. The figures on the right of each panel show that the model is also able to explain the relative importance of the two subcomponents of the ROE spread. In particular, the figures show that the spread in contemporaneous profitability (i.e., the ROE Level spread) is a relatively more important driver of the ROE spread than the spread in future ROE growth (i.e., the ROE Growth Spread).  \n\nPanel B of Table 5 presents the results of the extended value spread decomposition using simulated data from the calibrated model. The panel shows the relative weight of each of the two components of the value premium, explained by LS $(\\mathrm{VP}_{N}^{\\parallel}$ ) and orthogonal to LS $(\\mathrm{VP}_{N}^{\\perp}$ ) across different time horizons $N$ . Figure 8, panel A, provides a visual representation of the weights of these two components of the value premium in the data (left figure) and in the model (right figure). The figure shows that the model can match the roughly even weights of each of these two components in explaining the value premium.  \n\nPanel B of Table 5 also presents the relative weights of the components of the ROE Growth spread explained by LS $(\\mathrm{RGS}_{N}^{\\parallel}$ ) and orthogonal to LS (RGS $\\textstyle{\\frac{!}{N}}$ )across different time horizons $N$ . The fit of the model can be seen in Figure 8, panel B. The left figure shows the subcomponents of the ROE Growth spread from the model and the right figure shows the same subcomponents in the model. The panel shows that the model can generate the low average weight of the component of the ROE Growth spread that is explained by labor shares.  \n\nLastly, panel B of Table 5, as well as panel C of Figure 8 present the relative weights of the components of the ROE level spread explained by LS $(\\mathrm{RLS}_{N}^{\\parallel}$ )and orthogonal to LS (RLS $\\textstyle{\\frac{!}{N}}$ ) across time horizons $N$ . The table and the figures show that the model can generate the low average and increasing pattern in the weight of the component of the ROE Level spread that explained by labor shares.  \n\n# << Figure 8 here >>  \n\nFama and French (1995) show that a portfolio of frms with low B/M has greater ROE levels than those of a portfolio of firms with high B/M. Moreover, the difference in profitability between these two portfolios increases in the years before portfolio formation and decreases (i.e., mean reverts) in the years after portfolio formation. Figure 9 shows that the synthetic data generated by the calibrated model shows similar patterns. The figure shows the ROE ratio of the top and bottom tercile portfolios of frms sorted on B/M in the 5 years before and after portfolio formation. The profitability measure (i.e., ROE) is constructed as operating profits net of the value of depreciation $\\left(\\Pi_{\\mathrm{t}}-B_{\\mathrm{t}}\\delta\\right)$ divided by the lagged book valueof equity $(B_{\\mathrm{t}})$  \n\n# << Figure 9 here >>  \n\nOverall, the calibration exercise is successful at explaining not only qualitatively but also quantitatively the results of the baseline and extended decompositions. Furthermore, the performance of the model is consistent with the hypothesis that at least two classes of mechanisms drive the value premium: one class related to labor leverage and one class unrelated to labor leverage but related to cross-sectional variation in profitability and cash flow growth.  \n\n## 3 Firm-Level Analysis  \n\nIn this section, I provide additional evidence that the components of log book-to-market ratios $\\left(b m\\right)$ explained by (bm\"), and orthogonal to (bm $\\bot$ ), labor share provide information about fundamentally different mechanisms that drive firms’ stock risk and return profiles, as well as their profitability and growth prospects.  \n\n### 3.1  Stock returns and stock return volatility  \n\nThe results from Table 1, which also can be visualized in Figure 8, suggest that labor leverage, as proxied by LS, helps explain roughly half of the value premium. Table 6 presents the results of additional tests that do not rely on the validity of CPV's original decomposition methodology or the validity of the extended methodology proposed in this paper. Table 6, panel A, shows the results of the following panel data regressions:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\mathrm{ret}_{i,t}=\\beta_{\\mathrm{0,t}}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{bm}}\\mathrm{bm}_{i,t-2}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{x}}X_{i,t-2}+\\epsilon_{i,t},}\\ &{\\mathrm{ret}_{i,t}=\\beta_{\\mathrm{0,t}}+\\beta_{\\parallel}\\mathrm{bm}_{i,t-2}^{\\parallel}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{\\perp}}\\mathrm{bm}_{i,t-2}^{\\perp}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{x}}X_{i,t-2}+\\epsilon_{i,t},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathrm{ret}_{i,t}$ denotes the 1-year stock excess return (expressed as a percentage) from year $t-1$ to year $t$ and X is a vector of controls for asset size and financial leverage. The three main independent variables, bm, $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\parallel}$ , and $\\mathrm{bm^{\\perp}}$ , are standardized so that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This standardization allows for a more direct comparison of the estimated coeffcients from different specifications. In addition, as indicated by the time subscripts in the intercepts $\\beta_{0}$ in Equations (30a) and (30b), the regressions above include year effects. Standard errors are clustered by both firm and year to address the downward bias of OLS standard errors due to the autocorrelation of residuals for a given firm and due to the cross-sectional correlation of residuals in a given year.31  \n\nThe first two specifications shown in Table 6, which are based on Equation (30a), indicate that a one standard deviation increase in bm leads to an increase in annual excess stock returns of around $3.8\\%$ . This last finding is not new: It simply confrms the economic and statistical significance of the value premium in the sample data used in this paper. The remaining specifications in Table 6 are based on Equation (30b). The table shows that a one standard deviation increase in bm $\\parallel$ leads to an increase in annual returns of around $8.2\\%$ The corresponding annual return increase for a one standard deviation increase in $\\mathrm{bm^{\\perp}}$ is around 2.8%. Whereas returns are more sensitive to $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\parallel}$ relative to bm $^{\\perp}$ , the latter appears to contribute slightly more to adjusted $\\mathrm{{R}^{2}}$ than the former, although this difference is unlikely to be statistically significant. Overall, the results presented in Table 6 are consistent with the finding that both components of bm help explain future stock returns, which is presented Table 1.  \n\nThe model suggests that bm\" and bm $\\bot$ provide information about different drivers for expected returns. The model is based on a single source of priced risk for convenience. However, I do not take a stand in this paper about what this source, or these sources, may be. However, a simple way of investigating possible differences in the two components is to compare their explanatory power over stock return volatility. To see this, note that a true priced-risk loading $\\beta$ related to some possibly unknown asset pricing factor model $R_{i,t}=\\alpha+\\beta_{i}R_{M,t}+\\epsilon_{i,t}$ can be decomposed into two parts:  \n\n![](images/0ded86f762d196434faee3c96f18ffd37ff72e11dd2ea7acb1cedc1a2dce6443.jpg)  \n\nEquation (31) is related to the proportion of priced stock return risk. The second term on the right-hand side of Equation (3l) is related to the level of total risk. Note that labor leverage should amplify existing risk, priced or otherwise, but it should not affect risk composition. Given that $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\parallel}$ captures the component of bm explained by labor leverage, it follows that this term must be positively related to the second term in Equation (31). To investigate this hypothesis, Table 7 shows the results of the following panel data regressions:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\sigma_{i,t}=\\beta_{\\mathrm{0,t}}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{bm}}\\mathrm{bm}_{i,t-2}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{x}}X_{i,t-2}+\\epsilon_{i,t},}\\ &{\\sigma_{i,t}=\\beta_{\\mathrm{0,t}}+\\beta_{\\parallel}\\mathrm{bm}_{i,t-2}^{\\parallel}+\\beta_{\\perp}\\mathrm{bm}_{i,t-2}^{\\perp}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{x}}X_{i,t-2}+\\epsilon_{i,t},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\sigma_{i,t}$ is the volatility (expressed as a percentage) of monthly returns of stock $i$ overyear $t$ and the remaining variables are the same as those used in Table 6.  \n\nThe first two specifications in Table 7 are based on Equation (32a), and they show that log B/M ratio (i.e., bm) is positively and significantly related to stock return volatility, but only after I control for size and financial leverage. Moreover, the predictive power of bm on total stock risk seems to be trivial given the negligibly adjusted within-effect $\\mathrm{{R}^{2}}$ in the first specification.  \n\nThe remaining specifications in Table 7 are based on Equation (32b). The table shows that bm $\\parallel$ is in fact positively and significantly related to stock return volatility. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that bm $\\parallel$ is related to labor leverage. Note that the hypothesis that $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\parallel}$ should be related to stock return volatility does not imply that $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\perp}$ should or should not be related to stock return volatility. The relation between bm $\\perp$ and stock return volatility is thus an empirical question. The results of Table 7 suggest that $\\mathrm{bm^{\\perp}}$ is not strongly related to stock return volatility. One possible explanation to reconcile the fact that $\\mathrm{bm^{\\perp}}$ helps explain the level of stock returns (see Table 6), but not stock return volatility (see Table 7 ), would be that the mechanism(s) captured by $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\perp}$ is (are) related to the composition of risk (i.e., related to the first term of the right-hand side of Equation (31)).  \n\n### 3.2 ROE and future ROE growth  \n\nWhereas both components of log book-to-market (bm) ratios seem to help explain the value premium, Table 1 suggests that the same is not true for the ROE level and growth spreads. As shown in Figure 8, panel B, over three quarters of the ROE growth spread is explained by the component of bm orthogonal to labor shares $\\mathrm{bm^{\\perp}}$ . The contrast in the findings related to the value premium to those related to the growth spread supports the hypothesis that the two components of bm relate to two fundamentally different mechanisms.  \n\nTable 8 provides further evidence that $\\mathrm{bm^{\\perp}}$ is more closely related to contemporaneous ROE levels and to future ROE growth than $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\parallel}$ using alternative tests that do not require any of the assumptions that underlie the decomposition methodologies used in the tests shown in Table 1.  \n\nPanel A of Table 8 shows the results of the panel data regressions given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\left(\\mathrm{Log}\\left[1+\\mathrm{ROE}_{\\mathrm{t-s}}\\right]\\right)\\times100=\\beta_{0,\\mathrm{t}}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{bm}}\\mathrm{bm}_{i,t}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{x}}X_{i,t}+\\epsilon_{i,t},}\\ &{\\left(\\mathrm{Log}\\left[1+\\mathrm{ROE}_{\\mathrm{t-s}}\\right]\\right)\\times100=\\beta_{0,\\mathrm{t}}+\\beta_{\\parallel}\\mathrm{bm}_{i,t-2}^{\\parallel}+\\beta_{\\perp}\\mathrm{bm}_{i,t-2}^{\\perp}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{x}}X_{i,t-2}+\\epsilon_{i,t},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $s\\in\\{0,2\\}$ determines the timing of the dependent variable and ROE is return on equity and defined as the ratio of income before extraordinary items and 1-year lagged book value of equity. Panel B of the table shows the results of the panel data regressions given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\mathrm{\\quad}\\mathrm{{Log}}\\left[1+\\mathrm{{ROE}}_{\\mathrm{t}}\\right]-\\mathrm{{Log}}\\left[1+\\mathrm{{ROE}}_{\\mathrm{t-2}}\\right]\\times100=\\beta_{0,\\mathrm{t}}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{bm}}\\mathrm{{bm}}_{i,t}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{x}}X_{i,t}+\\epsilon_{i,t},}\\ &{\\mathrm{\\quad}\\mathrm{{Log}}\\left[1+\\mathrm{{ROE}}_{\\mathrm{t}}\\right]-\\mathrm{{Log}}\\left[1+\\mathrm{{ROE}}_{\\mathrm{t-2}}\\right])\\times100=\\beta_{0,\\mathrm{t}}+\\beta_{\\parallel}\\mathrm{{bm}}_{i,t-2}^{\\parallel}+\\beta_{\\perp}\\mathrm{{bm}}_{i,t-2}^{\\perp}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{x}}X_{i,t-2}+\\epsilon_{i,t},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $X$ is a vector of control variables used in the tests presented in Table 6. The results presented in the first two columns in panels A and B of Table 8 are consistent with the existence of a negative relation between book-to-market ratios and future profitability and between book-to-market ratios and contemporaneous profitability (i.e., the ROE level spread). The results presented in the first two columns in panel C confirm the existence of the ROE growth spread (i.e., the negative cross-sectional relation between book-to-market ratios and future ROE growth). In particular, the table shows that future ROE growth is higher among firms with high book-to-market ratios (i.e., the firms often called value frms). The existence of the ROE level spread and the ROE growth spread is consistent with the results of the model calibration presented in Figure 9 and with the findings in Fama and French (1995). The results of the remaining columns of panels A, B, and C of Table 8 show that bm $\\perp$ is the main driver of both the ROE level spreads and the ROE growth spread. Overall, the results presented in Table 8 are consistent with the results of the decompositions presented in Table 1 and with the model calibration results presented in Table 5.  \n\nThe results discussed in the previous section show that firms with higher book-to-market ratios tend to experience higher future ROE growth than firms with low book-to-market ratios. A natural question is whether the higher future ROW growth of value firms is due to faster cash fow growth, to lower future capital growth, or a combination of both.  \n\n### 3.3 Cash fow growth  \n\nThis section shows that the higher future ROE growth of value firms documented in the previous section is not due to higher future cash fow growth. In fact, value firms experience lower future sales and profit growth than growth firms. Moreover, it is the bm $\\perp$ component of book-to-market ratios, as opposed to the $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\parallel}$ component, that explains the observed cross-sectional differences in future cash flow growth.  \n\nPanel A of Table 9 shows the results of the panel data regressions given by  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Proxy}_{i,t-1,t}=\\beta_{0,t}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{bm}}\\mathrm{bm}_{i,t-2}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{x}}X_{i,t-2}+\\epsilon_{i,t},\n$$  \n\nwhere Cash Flow Growth Prory equals the l-year percentage growth in total sales (i.e., $\\mathrm{Sale}_{\\mathrm{t}}/\\mathrm{Sale}_{\\mathrm{t}-1}-1)$ in panel A and the l-year growth i operating profts scaled by assets (i.e.  \n\n(oIBDP-ounDP- ) in panel B OIBDP is Compustat variable Operating ncome before depreciation, and the control variables are the same as those used in Table 6.  \n\nThe results of both panels of Table 9 are consistent with a negative cross-sectional relation between log book-to-market (bm) ratios and future cash fow growth.33 In particular, the table shows that in the sample studied in this paper, both sales and operating profits of firms with lower book-to-market ratios (i.e., the firms often called growth frms) tend to grow more quickly than those of frms with high book-to-market ratios. The key finding of the table, however, is that most of the relation between bm and subsequent cash fow growth is explained by the bm component orthogonal to labor shares, bm $\\perp$ . In fact, the contribution of $\\mathrm{bm}^{\\parallel}$ to within-effect adjusted $\\mathrm{{R^{2}}}$ is negligible, as one can see in the third specifications shown in panels A and B.  \n\n### 3.4 Capital formation  \n\nSection 3.2 documents a positive cross-sectional relation between bm and $\\mathrm{bm^{\\perp}}$ and future ROE growth. Section 3.3 shows that the positive relation is not explained by differences in cash fow growth given the documented negative cross-sectional relation between bm and $\\mathrm{bm^{\\perp}}$ and future cash fow growth. To reconcile the findings in Sections 3.2 and 3.3, one should expect a negative relation between bm and bm $\\bot$ and book values of equity growth (i.e., capital accumulation). This section tests this hypothesis and documents that firms with high bm and bm $\\bot$ tend to invest more and accumulate more capital in the future than firms with low bm and $\\mathrm{bm^{\\perp}}$  \n\nTable 10 shows the results of panel data regressions given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\mathrm{Proxy}_{i,t-1,t}=\\beta_{0,t}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{bm}}\\mathrm{bm}_{i,t-2}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{x}}X_{i,t-2}+\\epsilon_{i,t},}\\ &{\\mathrm{Proxy}_{i,t-1,t}=\\beta_{0,t}+\\beta_{\\parallel}\\mathrm{bm}_{i,t-2}^{\\parallel}+\\beta_{\\perp}\\mathrm{bm}_{i,t-2}^{\\perp}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{x}}X_{i,t-2}+\\epsilon_{i,t},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere Capital Formation Prory equals the investment rate (i.e., capital expenditures over net   \nplant, property, and equipment, CAPEX $+t$ /PPENT ) in panel A and 1-year percentage growth $\\mathrm{t}-1$   \nin physical capital (i.e., PENTt /PPENT $_{\\mathrm{t-1}}-1$ ) in panel B, and the remaining variables are the   \nsame as those used in Table 6.  \n\nTable 10 confrms that bm is negatively related to investment rates and to physical capital growth, as can be seen in the first two specifications shown. This finding implies that firms with low bm tend to invest more and have higher physical capital growth than firms with high bm. The relations between bm and investment and between bm and capital growth seem to be entirely driven by the component of bm orthogonal to LS (i.e., bm).  \n\n## 4 Conclusion  \n\nThe goal of this paper is to quantify the relative importance of labor leverage in explaining the positive cross-sectional relation between book-to-market ratios and stock returns (i.e. the value premium). My analysis uses a novel extension of the value spread decomposition methodology from Cohen et al. (2003, CPV). I use this extension to gauge the extent to which labor leverage, which is proxied by labor share, can explain the value premium and the growth spread. One of the main findings of this paper is that labor leverage is an essential, but not a unique, determinant of the value premium. Another key finding is that labor leverage does not seem to be a primary determinant of the growth spread. When these two facts are considered together, they provide indirect evidence for the existence of additional economic mechanisms that are unrelated to labor leverage, are essential for explaining the value premium, and likely are related to drivers of firm growth.  \n\nThe paper proposes a labor-based model that represents a set of sufficient, but not necessary, conditions that can explain the main empirical findings. In the model, as in the data, labor leverage seems to be an essential, but not a unique, determinant of the value premium. In the model, the firm is subject to labor-induced operating leverage that originates from the strict complementarity between labor and capital and from the smoothness of economywide wages. This model shows that labor share is a valid proxy for labor leverage because it is negatively related to productivity and thus negatively related to profits. Despite its tractability, the model is fexible enough to also represent economic mechanisms unrelated to labor leverage that also drive the value premium (e.g., mechanisms based on growth options or investment-specific shocks). Moreover, the model can qualitatively and quantitatively explain the results from the baseline value spread decomposition from CPV as well as the results from the extended decomposition of the value premium and of the growth spread.  \n\nUnderlying this paper is the idea that book-to-market ratios are a catch-all firm characteristic that embed any determinants of firms’ discount rates and growth rates. The findings of this paper are consistent with the hypothesis that not all determinants of firms’ growth rates are also determinants of firms’ discount rates. Overall, these findings cast further doubt on the perception that a low book-to-market ratio is the defining property of a growth firm.  \n\n## References  \n\nAbel, A. B., and J. C. Eberly. 1994.

In what follows, I drop the time subscripts of the state and endogenous variables to simplify the notation. For this same reason, unless needed for clarity, I omit the variables underlying functions (e.g., $V~\\equiv~V[\\psi,K,\\omega,\\vartheta])$ .The value of the firm in a given regime $\\{\\omega,\\vartheta\\}\\in\\{\\{\\omega^{\\mathrm{slow}},\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{good}}\\},\\{\\omega^{\\mathrm{slow}},\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{bad}}\\},\\{\\omega^{\\mathrm{fast}},\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{good}}\\},\\{\\omega^{\\mathrm{fast}},\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{bad}}\\}\\}$ satisfies the Bellman equation givenby  \n\n$$\nV(r+\\lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}+p_{\\omega}+p_{\\vartheta})d t=\\operatorname*{max}_{\\{\\iota_{\\mathrm{s}},\\iota_{\\mathrm{p}}\\}}\\left[D d t+\\mathrm{E}\\left[d V\\right]\\right],\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n[d V]=(\\iota_{\\mathrm{s}}+\\iota_{\\mathrm{p}}+\\delta K)V_{K}d t+(\\mu_{\\psi}-\\eta\\sigma_{\\psi}^{\\Lambda})V_{\\psi}d t+\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{\\psi}^{2}}{2}\\right)V_{\\psi}d t+p_{\\omega}V[-\\omega,\\vartheta]d t+p_{\\vartheta}V[\\omega,-\\vartheta]d t,\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\neg x$ denotes the negation of regime $x$ (i.e., $\\begin{array}{r l r}{\\neg\\omega^{\\mathrm{fast}}}&{{}=}&{\\omega^{\\mathrm{slow}}}\\end{array}$ ， $\\begin{array}{r l r}{\\neg\\omega^{\\mathrm{slow}}}&{{}=}&{\\omega^{\\mathrm{fast}}}\\end{array}$ ， $\\begin{array}{r l r}{\\neg\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{good}}}&{{}=}&{\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{bad}}}\\end{array}$ , and $\\begin{array}{r l r}{\\neg\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{bad}}}&{{}=}&{\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{good}}}\\end{array}$ ). A simple inspection of Equation (A1) shows that the solution to the maximization problem above is also the solution to the problem $\\mathrm{max}_{\\{\\iota_{\\mathrm{s}},\\iota_{\\mathrm{p}}\\}}\\left[(\\iota_{\\mathrm{s}}+\\iota_{\\mathrm{p}})V_{K}-\\Phi\\left[\\iota_{\\mathrm{s}},\\iota_{\\mathrm{p}},\\vartheta\\right]\\right]$ , which implies that the optimal investment levels are given by  \n\n$$\n\\iota_{\\mathrm{s}}^{*}=-\\left(\\frac{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{s}}-V_{\\mathrm{K}}}{c_{\\mathrm{k}}}\\right)\\mathbb{1}_{\\{\\mathrm{V_{\\mathrm{K}}<\\kappa_{\\mathrm{s}}}\\}}\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n\\iota_{\\mathrm{p}}^{*}=\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{{K}}}-\\kappa_{\\mathrm{p}}[\\vartheta]}{c_{\\mathrm{k}}}\\right)\\mathbb{1}_{\\{\\mathrm{V_{\\mathrm{K}}>\\kappa_{\\mathrm{p}}[\\vartheta]\\}}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $V_{\\mathrm{{K}}}$ denotes the marginal value of a unit of capital. Following Abel and Eberly (1994) and Abel and Eberly (1997), I guess and later verify that the solution to firm value has the functional form given by  \n\n$$\nV_{t}=K_{t}q_{t}+J_{t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $q$ and $J$ are functions of log labor share $(\\psi)$ and of the regimes $\\omega$ and $\\vartheta$ . The functions $q$ and $J$ represent the marginal value of assets in place and the total value of the future investment and disinvestment activity of the firm, respectively. Substituting Equations (A2a), (A2b), and (A3) into Equation (A1), I obtain the two systems of four second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) given by34  \n\n$$\nc_{0}q[\\omega,\\vartheta]+c_{1}[\\omega,\\vartheta]q_{\\psi}[\\omega,\\vartheta]+c_{2}q_{\\psi\\psi}[\\omega,\\vartheta]-p_{\\omega}(q[\\omega,\\vartheta]-q\\left[-\\omega,\\vartheta\\right])-p_{\\vartheta}(q[\\omega,\\vartheta]-q\\left[\\omega,-\\vartheta\\right])=0\n$$

\n\n$q_{\\psi}$ and $q_{\\psi\\psi}$ denote the first and second partial derivatives of $q$ with respect to $\\psi$ ， $J_{\\psi}$ and $J_{\\psi\\psi}$ denote the first and second partial derivatives of $J$ with respect to $\\psi$ , and where $\\mu_{\\psi}[\\mathcal{\\omega}]$ and $\\sigma_{\\psi}$ are defined by the dynamics of log labor share $\\psi\\equiv\\mathrm{Log}\\left[\\Psi\\right]$ as

\n\nTo reduce the order of the system of four second-order ODEs in Equation (A4), I convert it into the system of eight first-order ODEs given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\begin{array}{r

the superscripts on $q$ ， $h$ , and $c_{1}$ are defined as $g=\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{good}},b=\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{bad}},$ $f=\\omega^{\\mathrm{fast}}$ , and $\\boldsymbol{s}=\\boldsymbol\\omega^{\\mathrm{slow}}$ and are used as a more compact notation (e.g., $q^{\\mathrm{xy}}\\equiv q[\\psi_{t},\\omega^{\\mathrm{x}},\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{y}}],c_{1}^{\\mathrm{xy}}\\equiv c_{1}[\\psi_{t},\\omega^{\\mathrm{x}},\\vartheta^{\\mathrm{y}}]$ and $h^{\\mathrm{xy}}\\equiv

The system of first-order  \n\nODEs in Equations (A8a)-(A8h) is then reexpressed in matrix form as given by  \n\n$$\n{\\bf q}^{\\prime}[\\psi_{t}]={\\bf c.q}[\\psi_{t}]+{\\bf d}[\\psi_{t}],\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathbf{c}$ is the matrix of coefficients of the system of ordinary differential equations associated with the solution to Equation (27) and given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\varepsilon\\left[\\begin{array}{c c c c c c c c c}{0}&{1}&{0}&{0}&{0}&{0}&{0}&{0}&{0}\\ {\\frac{\\rho_{\\theta}+\\rho_{\\omega}-c_{\\theta}+\\delta}{c_{2}}}&{-\\frac{c_{\\theta}^{\\kappa}}{c_{2}}}&{-\\frac{\\rho_{\\theta}}{c_{2}}}&{0}&{-\\frac{\\rho_{\\omega}}{c_{2}}}&{0}&{0}&{0}\\ {0}&{0}&{0}&{1}&{0}&{0}&{0}&{0}\\ {-\\frac{\\rho_{\\theta}}{c_{2}}}&{0}&{\\frac{\\rho_{\\theta}+\\rho_{\\omega}-c_{\\theta}+\\delta}{c_{2}}}&{-\\frac{c_{\\theta}^{\\kappa}}{c_{2}}}&{0}&{0}&{-\\frac{\\rho_{\\omega}}{c_{2}}}&{0}\\ {0}&{0}&{0}&{0}&{0}&{1}&{0}&{0}\\ {-\\frac{\\rho_{\\omega}}{c_{2}}}&{0}&{0}&{0}&{0}&{\\frac{\\rho_{\\theta}-c_{\\theta}+\\delta}{c_{2}}}&{-\\frac{\\rho_{\\theta}}{c_{2}}}&{0}\\ {0}&{0}&{0}&{0}&{\\frac{\\rho_{\\theta}+\\rho_{\\omega}-c_{\\theta}+\\delta}{c_{2}}}&{-\\frac{c_{\\theta}^{\\kappa}}{c_{2}}}&{-\\frac{\\rho_{\\theta}}{c_{2}}}&{0}\\ {0}&{0}&{0}&{0}&{0}&{0}&{0}&{1}\\ {0}&{0}&{0}&{0}&{-\\frac{\\rho_{\\theta}}{c_{2}}}&{0}&{0}&{-\\frac{\\rho_{\\theta}}{c_{2}}}\\end{array}\\right]}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{q}(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{t})\\equiv\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{q^{u}[\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{t}]}\\ {q_{\\psi}^{u}[\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{t}]}\\ {q^{u}[\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{t}]}\\ {q^{b}[\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{t}]}\\ {q_{\\psi}^{b}[\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{t}]}\\ {q^{u}[\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{t}]}\\ {q_{\\psi}^{b}[\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{t}]}\\ {q_{\\psi}^{u}[\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{t}]}\\ {q_{\\psi}^{b}[\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{t}]}\\ {q_{\\psi}^{u}[\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{t}]}\\ {q_{\\psi}^{b}[\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{t}]}\\end{array}\\right]\\quad\\mathrm{and}\\quad\\mathbf{q}[\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{t}]\\equiv-\\bar{\\mathbf{l}}_{\\{\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{t}<\\overline{{\\psi}}_{t}\\}}\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{0}\\ {\\frac{\\pi[\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{t}]}{\\sigma_{0}}}\\ {\\frac{\\pi[\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{t}]}{\\sigma_{0}}}\\ {\\frac{\\pi[\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{t}]}{\\sigma_{0}}}\\ {\\frac{\\pi[\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{t}]}{\\sigma_{0}}}\\ {\\frac{\\pi[\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{t}]}{\\sigma_{0}}}\\ {\\frac{\\pi[\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{t}]}{\\sigma_{0}}}\\ {\\frac{\\pi[\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_{t}]}{\\sigma_{0}}}\\end{array}\\right],\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\overline{{\\psi}}\\equiv\\mathrm{Log}\\left[\\overline{{\\Psi}}\\right]=0$ is the log labor share threshold between the operational status regions.  \n\nDenote the eigenvalues and matrix of eigenvectors of $\\mathbf{c}$ by $\\lambda$ and $\\mathbf{x}$ , respectively, such that $\\mathbf{c.x}_{i}=\\lambda_{i}\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\forall i\\in\\{1,...,8\\}$ . To ensure the existence and economic relevance of a solution to Equation (A9), I implicitly restrict the parameter space of the problem so that the eight eigenvalues associated with $\\mathbf{c}$ are distinct and real, and four of the eigenvalues are positive and four are negative.  \n\nThe indicator function in the definition of the vector $\\mathbf{d}$ accounts for the two operational status regions: the active frm region, where $\\psi_{t}<\\overline{{\\psi}}$ , and the inactive frm region, where $\\psi_{t}\\geq\\psi$ . In each region, the solution is comprised by the sum of a complementary (i.e., homogeneous) and a particular (i.e., nonhomogeneous) solution to the nonhomogeneous system in Equation (A9), $\\mathbf{q}=\\mathbf{q}_{\\mathbf{c}}+\\mathbf{q}_{\\mathbf{p}}$ 35 The strategy to solve the system in Equation (A9) is to find separate general solutions for the firm value in each of the two regions and then stitch them together through boundary conditions.  \n\n#### A.3 Active Firm Region ( $\\psi_{t}<\\overline{{\\psi}}$  \n\nThe complementary solution to Equation (A9) in the active firm region $\\mathbf{q}_{C}^{\\mathrm{A}}[\\psi_{t}]$ is standard and is given by  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{q}_{C}^{\\mathbf{A}}[\\psi_{t}]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{\\sum_{i=1}^{8}\\mathbf{x}_{1,i}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}\\mathbf{C}_{i}^{\\mathbf{A}}}\\ {\\sum_{i=1}^{8}\\mathbf{x}_{2,i}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}\\mathbf{C}_{i}^{\\mathbf{A}}}\\ {\\sum_{i=1}^{8}\\mathbf{x}_{3,i}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}\\mathbf{C}_{i}^{\\mathbf{A}}}\\ {\\sum_{i=1}^{8}\\mathbf{x}_{4,i}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}\\mathbf{C}_{i}^{\\mathbf{A}}}\\ {\\sum_{i=1}^{8}\\mathbf{x}_{5,i}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}\\mathbf{C}_{i}^{\\mathbf{A}}}\\ {\\sum_{i=1}^{8}\\mathbf{x}_{6,i}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}\\mathbf{C}_{i}^{\\mathbf{A}}}\\ {\\sum_{i=1}^{8}\\mathbf{x}_{4,i}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}\\mathbf{C}_{i}^{\\mathbf{A}}}\\ {\\sum_{i=1}^{8}\\mathbf{x}_{7,i}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}\\mathbf{C}_{i}^{\\mathbf{A}}}\\ {\\sum_{i=1}^{8}\\mathbf{x}_{8,i}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}\\mathbf{C}_{i}^{\\mathbf{A}}}\\ {\\sum_{i=1}^{8}\\mathbf{x}_{8,i}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}\\mathbf{C}_{i}^{\\mathbf{A}}}\\end{array}\\right],\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathbf{C}^{\\mathrm{{A}}}$ is a vector of constants determined by the boundary conditions.  \n\nI use Euler's variation of constants method to find the particular solution to Equation  \n\n(A9) in the active firm region $\\mathbf{q}_{P}^{\\mathrm{A}}[\\psi_{t}]$ . Let us define a vector function $\\mathbf{y}[\\psi_{t}]$ as  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}[\\psi_{t}]={\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{\\sum_{i=1}^{8}\\mathbf{x}_{1,t}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}}\\ {\\sum_{i=1}^{8}\\mathbf{x}_{2,t}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}}\\ {\\sum_{i=1}^{8}\\mathbf{x}_{3,t}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}}\\ {\\sum_{i=1}^{8}\\mathbf{x}_{4,t}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}}\\ {\\sum_{i=1}^{8}\\mathbf{x}_{5,t}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}}\\ {\\sum_{i=1}^{8}\\mathbf{x}_{6,t}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}}\\ {\\sum_{i=1}^{8}\\mathbf{x}_{6,t}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}}\\ {\\sum_{i=1}^{8}\\mathbf{x}_{7,t}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}}\\ {\\sum_{i=1}^{8}\\mathbf{x}_{8,t}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}}\\end{array}\\right]}.\n$$  \n\nNote that $\\mathbf{y}[\\psi_{t}]$ is a special case of Equation (A12) in which $\\mathbf{c}^{\\mathrm{{A}}}$ equals a vector of ones.

The solution to Equation (A14) is given by  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{q}_{P}^{\\mathrm{A}}[\\psi_{t}]=(1-\\alpha)^{\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta-1}}\\sum_{i=1}^{8}H_{i}[\\omega_{t},\\vartheta_{t}]F_{i}[\\psi_{t}],\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle{\\cal H}_{i}[\\omega_{t},\\vartheta_{t}]\\equiv\\frac{2}{\\lambda_{i}\\sigma_{\\psi}^{2}}\\sum_{j=1}^{4}\\left([{\\bf x}^{-1}]_{\\mathrm{i},2\\mathrm{j}}\\right)\\left(\\left({\\bf x}_{1,\\mathrm{i}}+({\\bf x}_{3,\\mathrm{i}}-{\\bf x}_{1,\\mathrm{i}})\\mathbb{1}_{\\{\\vartheta_{\\mathrm{t}}=\\vartheta_{\\mathrm{g}}\\}}\\right)\\mathbb{1}_{\\{\\omega_{\\mathrm{t}}=\\omega_{\\mathrm{s}}\\}}+}}\\ {{\\displaystyle\\left({\\bf x}_{5,\\mathrm{i}}+({\\bf x}_{7,\\mathrm{i}}-{\\bf x}_{5,\\mathrm{i}})\\mathbb{1}_{\\{\\vartheta_{\\mathrm{t}}=\\vartheta\\mathrm{g}\\}}\\right)\\mathbb{1}_{\\{\\omega_{\\mathrm{t}}=\\omega\\mathrm{f}\\}}\\right),}}\\ {{\\displaystyle F_{i}[\\psi_{t}]\\equiv_{2}F_{1}\\big[\\frac{1}{\\theta-1},-\\lambda_{\\mathrm{i}},1-\\lambda_{\\mathrm{i}},\\mathrm{e}^{\\psi_{\\mathrm{t}}}\\big],}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $_2F_{1}[a,b,c,z]$ is the Gaussian hypergeometric function, which is defined for $|z|<1$ as  \n\n$$\n _{2}F_{1}[a,b,c,z]=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{(a)_{n}(b)_{n}}{(c)_{n}}\\frac{z^{n}}{n!}.\n$$  \n\nThe complete solution to the value of an active firm is the sum of the complementary and particular solutions, as given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathbf q^{\\mathrm A}[\\psi_{t}]=\\mathbf q_{C}^{\\mathrm A}[\\psi_{t}]+\\mathbf q_{P}^{\\mathrm A}[\\psi_{t}].}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n#### A.4 Inactive Firm Region ( $\\psi_{t}\\geq\\overline{{\\psi}}$  \n\nGiventhat $\\mathbf{d}[\\psi_{t}]$ in Equation (A9) is a vector of zeros in this region, the particular solution is also a vector of zeros. The complete solution to the inactive firm $\\mathbf{q}^{1}[\\psi_{t}]$ isthus equal to the complementary solution and is given by  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{q}^{\\mathbf{I}}[\\psi_{t}]=\\mathbf{q}_{C}^{\\mathbf{I}}[\\psi_{t}]=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{\\sum_{i=1}^{8}{\\mathbf{x}}_{1,\\mathbf{t}_{i}}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}\\mathbf{C}_{i}^{\\mathbf{t}}}\\ {\\sum_{i=1}^{8}{\\mathbf{x}}_{2,\\mathbf{t}_{i}}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}\\mathbf{C}_{i}^{\\mathbf{t}}}\\ {\\sum_{i=1}^{8}{\\mathbf{x}}_{3,\\mathbf{t}_{i}}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}\\mathbf{C}_{i}^{\\mathbf{t}}}\\ {\\sum_{i=1}^{8}{\\mathbf{x}}_{4,\\mathbf{t}_{i}}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}\\mathbf{C}_{i}^{\\mathbf{t}}}\\ {\\sum_{i=1}^{8}{\\mathbf{x}}_{5,\\mathbf{t}_{i}}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}\\mathbf{C}_{i}^{\\mathbf{t}}}\\ {\\sum_{i=1}^{8}{\\mathbf{x}}_{6,\\mathbf{t}_{i}}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}\\mathbf{C}_{i}^{\\mathbf{t}}}\\ {\\sum_{i=1}^{8}{\\mathbf{x}}_{6,\\mathbf{t}_{i}}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}\\mathbf{C}_{i}^{\\mathbf{t}}}\\ {\\sum_{i=1}^{8}{\\mathbf{x}}_{7,\\mathbf{t}_{i}}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}\\mathbf{C}_{i}^{\\mathbf{t}}}\\ {\\sum_{i=1}^{8}{\\mathbf{x}}_{8,\\mathbf{t}_{i}}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}\\mathbf{C}_{i}^{\\mathbf{t}}}\\ {\\sum_{i=1}^{8}{\\mathbf{x}}_{8,\\mathbf{t}_{i}}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}\\mathbf{C}_{i}^{\\mathbf{t}}}\\end{array}\\right],\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathbf{C}^{1}$ is a vector of constants determined by the boundary conditions.  \n\n#### A.5 Boundary Conditions  \n\nEconomic arguments about the limiting cases $\\psi\\rightarrow-\\infty$ and $\\psi\\to\\infty$ define the values of 8 of the 16 constants in vectors $\\mathbf{C}^{\\mathrm{{A}}}$ and $\\mathbf{C}^{1}$ . In particular, the aforementioned parameter space restriction, which ensures that four of the eigenvalues are negative and four are positive, implies that 8 of the 16 constants must equal zero. To see this, first consider the marginal value of the assets in place $q$ of an active firm. The complementary component of $q$ in this case represents the value of the option to suspend operations to prevent operating profits from becoming negative. It logically follows that, to rule out the counterfactual case in which the value of the suspension option from becoming arbitrarily large as the firm moves away from the option's exercise threshold (i.e., as $\\psi\\rightarrow-\\infty$ ), I must have that $\\mathbf{C}_{i}^{\\mathrm{{A}}}=0\\forall i$ s.t. $\\lambda_{i}<0$ . A similar argument holds for the inactive frm region. Note that an inactive frm does not generate any cash fows, so the marginal value of the assets in place $q$ in this case is simply the value of the option to resume operations when conditions make it profitable to do so. It reasons that $\\mathbf{C}_{i}^{\\mathrm{{I}}}=0\\forall i$ s.t. $\\lambda_{i}\\geq0$ to prevent the value of the option to resume operations from becoming arbitrarily large as the firm moves away from the option's exercise threshold (i.e., as $\\psi\\to\\infty$  \n\nThe remaining eight constants are determined by the value matching conditions at the threshold $\\psi={\\overline{{\\psi}}}$ (i.e., the threshold in which firms switch their operational status), which aregivenby  \n\n$$\n{\\bf q}^{\\mathrm{A}}[\\psi_{t}]\\Bigg|_{\\psi_{t}=\\overline{{{\\psi}}}}={\\bf q}^{\\mathrm{I}}[\\psi_{t}]\\Bigg|_{\\psi_{t}=\\overline{{{\\psi}}}}.\n$$  \n\nThe system in Equation (A19) above contains eight equalities and eight nonzero constants to be determined. The solution to the system is given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{\\mathbf{C}_{i}^{\\mathrm{A}}=}&{\\left(\\frac{\\Gamma\\left[\\frac{2-\\theta}{1-\\theta}\\right]\\Gamma\\left[-\\lambda_{i}\\right]}{\\Gamma\\left[\\frac{2-\\theta}{1-\\theta}\\right]-\\lambda_{i}}\\right)\\mathbb{1}_{\\{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{i}}>0\\}}\\qquad\\mathrm{and}}\\ {\\mathbf{C}_{i}^{\\mathrm{I}}=-\\left(\\frac{\\Gamma\\left[\\frac{2-\\theta}{1-\\theta}\\right]\\Gamma\\left[-\\lambda_{i}\\right]}{\\Gamma\\left[\\frac{2-\\theta}{1-\\theta}\\right]-\\lambda_{i}}\\right)\\mathbb{1}_{\\{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{i}}\\leq0\\}},\\quad\\forall i\\in\\{1,...,8\\},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\Gamma[.]$ is the gamma function.  \n\n#### A.6Complete Solution for $q$  \n\nA complete solution for the marginal value of the assets in place $q$ thatencompasses the two operational regions is obtained by (1) plugging back the values for $\\mathbf{C}^{\\mathrm{{A}}}$ and $\\mathbf{C}^{1}$ from Equation (A20) into Equations (A17) and (A18), (2) combining these solutions, and (3)  \n\nrearranging the resultant expression to obtain  \n\n$$\nq[\\psi_{t},\\omega_{t},\\vartheta_{t}]=\\frac{1}{(1-\\alpha)^{\\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}}}\\sum_{i=1}^{8}\\left(F_{i}[\\psi_{t}]+\\lambda_{i}e^{\\psi_{t}\\lambda_{i}}G_{i}[\\psi_{t}]\\right)H_{i}[\\omega_{t},\\vartheta_{t}],\n$$  \n\n$$\nG_{i}[\\psi_{t}]\\equiv\\frac{\\Gamma[\\frac{2-\\theta}{1-\\theta}]\\Gamma[-\\lambda_{\\mathrm{i}}]}{\\Gamma[\\frac{2-\\theta}{1-\\theta}-\\lambda_{\\mathrm{i}}]}\\left(\\mathbb{1}_{\\{\\psi_{\\mathrm{t}}<\\overline{{\\psi}}\\}}+\\mathbb{1}_{\\{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{i}}>0\\}}-1\\right).\n$$  \n\nFinally, I check to ensure that the complete solution does in fact satisfy the system in Equation (A4).  \n\n#### A.7 Solution for Value of Future Investment and Disinvestment (J)  \n\nI reduce the order of the system of four second-order ODEs in Equation (A5) into the system of eight first-order ODEs given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{J_{\\psi}^{\\psi}=g^{\\psi,\\psi},}\\ &{g_{\\psi}^{\\psi,\\psi}=-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{\\psi,\\psi}-({\\bar{\\psi}}_{s}+{\\bar{\\psi}}_{s})q^{\\psi,\\psi}}{c_{2}}-\\left(\\frac{c_{0}}{c_{2}}\\right)J^{\\psi,\\psi}-\\left(\\frac{c_{1}^{\\psi}}{c_{2}}\\right)h^{\\psi,\\psi}+\\left(\\frac{p_{e}}{c_{2}}\\right)\\left(J^{\\psi,}-J^{\\psi}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{p_{e}}{c_{2}}\\right)\\left(J^{\\psi}-J^{\\psi}\\right)}\\ &{J_{\\psi}^{\\psi}=g^{\\psi,\\psi},}\\ &{g_{\\psi}^{\\psi,\\psi}=-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{\\psi,\\psi}-({\\bar{\\psi}}_{s}+{\\bar{\\psi}}_{s})q^{\\psi,\\psi}}{c_{2}}-\\left(\\frac{c_{0}}{c_{2}}\\right)J^{\\psi,\\psi}-\\left(\\frac{c_{1}^{\\psi}}{c_{2}}\\right)h^{\\psi,\\psi}+\\left(\\frac{p_{e}}{c_{2}}\\right)\\left(J^{\\psi}-J^{\\psi}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{p_{e}}{c_{2}}\\right)\\left(J^{\\psi,}-J^{\\psi}\\right)}\\ &{J_{\\psi}^{\\psi}=g^{\\psi,\\psi},}\\ &{g_{\\psi}^{\\psi,\\psi}=-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{\\psi,\\psi}-({\\bar{\\psi}}_{s}+{\\bar{\\psi}}_{s})q^{\\psi,\\psi}}{c_{2}}-\\left(\\frac{c_{0}}{c_{2}}\\right)J^{\\psi,\\psi}-\\left(\\frac{c_{1}^{\\psi}}{c_{2}}\\right)h^{\\psi,\\psi}+\\left(\\frac{p_{e}}{c_{2}}\\right)\\left(J^{\\psi,}-J^{\\psi}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{p_{e}}{c_{2}}\\right)\\left(J^{\\psi}-J^{\\psi}\\right),}\\ &{J_{\\psi}^{\\psi}=\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{\\psi,\\psi}-({\\bar{\\psi}}_{s}+{\\bar{\\psi}}_{s})q^{\\psi,\\psi}}{c_{2}}-\\left(\\frac{c_{0}}{c_{2}}\\right)J^{\\psi,\\psi}- \n$$  \n\nWhereas the system of ODEs in Equation (A8), which is solved in the previous section, is independent from the system of ODEs in Equation (A23), the reverse is not true. Equations (A23) show that the solution for $J$ depends on $q$ . To the best of my knowledge, the functional form of the solution of $q$ in Equation (A21) implies that the system of ODEs in Equation (A23) cannot be solved analytically. I present below the matrix representation of the problem used in the numerical solution of $J$  \n\nThe matrix form of the system of ODEs in Equation (A5) that define the function $J$ is givenby  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}^{\\prime}[\\psi_{t}]=\\mathbf{c}.\\mathbf{J}[\\psi_{t}]+\\mathbf{g}[\\psi_{t}],\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathbf{c}$ is the matrix of coefficients in Equation (A10) and  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{g}[\\psi_{t}]\\equiv{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{0}\\ {g^{*}}\\ {0}\\ {g^{*}}\\ {0}\\ {0}\\ {g^{*}}\\ {0}\\ {g^{*}}\\ {0}\\ {0}\\ {0}\\ {0}\\ {g^{0}}\\ {0}\\ {g^{0}}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\ng[\\omega,\\vartheta]\\equiv\\left(\\frac{p_{\\vartheta}+p_{\\omega}-c_{0}}{c_{2}}\\right)c_{\\mathbf k}\\left(\\left(\\frac{q[\\omega,\\vartheta]-\\kappa_{\\mathrm{p}}[\\vartheta]}{c_{\\mathbf k}}\\right)^{2}\\mathbb{1}_{\\{\\mathfrak{q}[\\omega,\\vartheta]>\\kappa_{\\mathrm{p}}[\\vartheta]\\}}-\\left(\\frac{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{s}}-q[\\omega,\\vartheta]}{c_{\\mathbf k}}\\right)^{2}\\mathbb{1}_{\\{\\mathfrak{q}[\\omega,\\vartheta]>\\kappa_{\\mathrm{p}}[\\vartheta]\\}}\\right)^{2},\n$$  \n\nwhere the analytical form for $q$ is given in Equation (A21) and where the problem is subject to the same boundary conditions used in the solution of Equation (A4). The system in Equation (A24) is solved numerically with Matlab's ordinary differential equation solver for boundary value problems bop4c.  \n\n#### A.8 Complete Solution for Firm Value  \n\nThe complete solution for firm value is given by Equation (A3), $V_{t}=K_{t}q_{t}+J_{t}$  \n\n### B Accounting and Financial Data  \n\nMonthly common stock data are from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP shrcd =10 or 11). Accounting information is taken from Standard and Poor's Compustat annual industrial files. I include only stocks listed on NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ, with available data in the CRSP-Compustat merged files. I follow the literature and exclude firms with primary standard industrial classifications between 6000 and 6999 (financials). Size is defined as the market value of equity (Compustat variables prc times shrout). The book-value of equity is defined as in Daniel and Titman (2006). The book-to-market ratio is defined as book value of equity over size. Book value is defined as shareholders’ equity (Compustat SEQ) divided by the market value of equity. I exclude firm-year observations with missing monthly returns in the year and/or with missing or negative measures of size, book-to-market, and labor share in the previous year. When labor share LS is negative or greater than 1, I drop the firm-year observation. Market values and accounting variables are Winsorized at the 0.5% level in each sample year to reduce the infuence of possible outliers. The data used to construct the target moments in the panels F-H in Table 5 are at the monthly frequency and obtained from Kenneth French's data library. Specifically, the returns are based on the value-weighted returns of the quintile portfolios of firms sorted on B/M minus the 1-month Treasury-bill rate. The conditional betas are constructed from yearly univariate regressions of the portfolio's excess returns on the market factor return. The alpha is constructed as the full sample mean of the difference between the realized returns and the product of the conditional beta and the market factor return. The equity returns in the calibrated model are defined as the portfolio's asset return divided by one minus the leverage ratio of the quintile portfolio from the data reported in Table 2. The market factor return from the model is constructed as the value-weighted asset return of the firms in the simulated sample divided by one minus the weighted average financial leverage ratio from the data.  \n\n### C Value Spread Decompositions: Implementation Details  \n\nFor each year in the sample, I form twenty portfolios of frms sorted on the previous year's B/M ratio. For each portfolio, I construct the measure of book value (B), market value (M), and dividends (D) by summing the respective firm-level variables. The variables used in the decompositions are constructed following CPV. I construct portfolio-level log B/M as $b m_{i t}\\equiv\\mathrm{Log}[^{B_{i t}}/M_{i t}]$ . I follow CPV and approximate log earnings and log gross returns by applying Taylor expansions around the same expansion point $\\rho$ . Specifically, I construct portfolio-level log earnings as $e_{i t}\\equiv\\mathrm{Log}\\left[{{D}_{i t}}/{{B}_{i,t-1}}\\right]-\\rho\\mathrm{Log}\\left[{{{D}_{i t}}}/{{B}_{i,t}}\\right]$ , and log returns as $r_{i t}\\equiv\\mathrm{Log}\\left[D_{i t}/M_{i,t-1}\\right]-\\rho\\mathrm{Log}\\left[D_{i t}/M_{i,t}\\right]$ . I set the value of the decomposition constant to 0.96 in the data.  \n\nThe baseline methodology is similar, but not identical, to the methodology in CPV. As discussed in the main text, one difference is that I decompose the term related to ROE in the original methodology into two terms, one related to ROE level and one related to ROE future growth. Another difference is that, in this stage, I use a Fama-MacBeth procedure as opposed to panel data regressions. The use of cross-sectional regressions does not materially change the estimated weights; and, as it will become clear later in this section, this procedure allows me to extend the methodology to further decompose contemporaneous bm into components explained by, and orthogonal to, labor shares. The use of the Fama-MacBeth procedure affects the appropriate way of computing standard errors. Whereas CPV employs Rogers standard errors, I use Newey-West standard errors, in which the number of lags matches the horizon considered in the second-stage estimates of the Fama-MacBeth procedure shown in Equation (8). Another difference in my baseline procedure is that I use twenty portfolios of firms sorted on lagged B/M, whereas CPV use forty portfolios. The main reason for using fewer portfolios is to counteract the smaller sample of firm-year observations with nonmissing labor share. In practice, using fewer portfolios avoids the occurrence of portfolio-year-horizon observations that include too few firms, over longer horizons in particular.  \n\n### DConstruction Details of the Moments from Table 5  \n\nThis appendix provides additional details on the construction the empirical and modelgenerated moments presented in Table 5, panels D-H.  \n\nThe target moments in panel D (Macroeconomic moments） of Table 5 are the average labor share and the volatilities and cross-correlations of real GDP growth, real wage growth, and by real TFP growth. These moments are constructed as in Donangelo et al. (2019). The average and cross-sectional standard deviation of labor share are defined as the timeseries averages of the cross-sectional average and standard deviation of firm-level labor share measure $L S$ , respectively. The real GDP, TFP, and real wage growth series cover the nonfarm business sector. The real GDP growth series is taken from the NIPA table 1.1.3 and is calculated as the log change of real GDP. I follow Arias, Hansen, and Ohanian (2007) and calculate log TFP growth as $\\begin{array}{r}{\\Delta\\log\\left[Y\\right]-\\frac{2}{3}\\Delta\\log\\left[H\\right]}\\end{array}$ , where $\\Delta\\log\\left[Y\\right]$ is the real GDP series and $\\mathrm{Log}\\left[H\\right]$ is the hours of all persons (BLS series PRS85006033). The real wage series is constructed as the log growth in real hourly compensation (BLS series PRS85006153). The TFP and real wage growth series are annualized from the quarterly seasonally adjusted series from the BLS.  \n\nThe target moments in panel E (Asset returns of equal-weighted LS-quintile portfolios) of Table 5 are constructed as the equal-weighted unlevered annual excess stock returns of the quintile portfolios formed by lagged labor share with merged CRSP-Compustat data from 1963 to 2017. Unlevered returns are defined as (stock returns in excess of the 1- month Treasury-bill rate) $\\times(1-T D_{t-1}/A T_{t-1})$ ,where $T D_{t-1}$ and $A T_{t-1}$ are the 1-year lagged Compustat variables for total debt and total assets, respectively.  \n\nPanel F (Equity returns of value-weighted $B/M$ -quintile portfolios) of Table 5 presents the average value-weighted equity returns B/M-quintile portfolios. The model does not have financial leverage. For this reason, the asset returns from the model are converted to equity returns with financial leverage information from the Compustat sample. Specifically, equity returns are defined as asset returns divided by one plus the financial ratio value of the corresponding B/M quintile presented in panel A of Table 2.  \n\nThe target moments in panel G (Conditional CAPM estimates of value-weighted B/Mquintile portfolios) of Table 5 are the average annual alphas and betas from the conditional CAPM. The estimates from the conditional CAPM are conducted every year using monthly frequency data following the procedure in Lewellen and Nagel (2006). Following Dimson (1979) and Lewellen and Nagel (2006), the empirical conditional betas are corrected for biases in related to nonsynchronous return data. Specifically, the conditional beta of portfolio $i$ in year $y$ is defined as $\\beta_{i y}\\equiv\\beta_{i y}^{0}+\\beta_{i y}^{1}$ ,where $\\beta_{i y}^{0}$ and $\\beta_{i y}^{1}$ are the slopes of the time-series regression  \n\n$$\nR_{i,t}^{e}=\\alpha_{i,y}+\\beta_{i,y}^{0}R_{M,t}^{e}+\\beta_{i,y}^{1}R_{M,t-1}^{e}+\\epsilon_{i,t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $t$ represents each of the 12 months in year $y$ ， $i$ denotes the B/M-quintile portfolio, $R_{i t}^{e}$ is the return of the portfolio in excess of the risk-free rate at month $t$ , and $R_{M,t}^{e}$ and $R_{M,t-1}^{e}$ represent the excess returns of the market portfolio at months $t$ and $t-1$ , respectively. The intercept $\\alpha_{i,y}$ of the regression above is the annual alpha of the conditional CAPM. The B/M quintile portfolios from the model are the same as the ones used in panel F of Table 5 discussed above. The average conditional alphas and betas presented in the table are the time-series averages of $\\beta_{i y}$ and $\\alpha_{i,y}$ . The equity returns of the market portfolio in the model are defined as the value-weighted levered returns of the B/M-quintile portfolios from the model defined above.  \n\nFinally, the estimates presented in panel H (Unconditional CAPM estimates of valueweighted B/M-quintile portfolios) of Table 5 are constructed regressions similar to that in Equation (D25), but where a single regression estimated over the entire sample period is used for each of the quintile portfolios.  \n\n![](images/3fad2dc3f608606806b037358dabb34ea6be23445eee00991930aa7533272886.jpg)  \nFigure 1.

Model calibration: ROE of high and low B/M portfolios The figure presents the evolution of profitability ratios of portfolios of firms sorted on B/M in the 5 years before and after the portfolio formation based on synthetic data from the calibrated model.

Each year-portfolio ROE observation is constructed as the sum of operating profits after depreciation divided by the sum of lagged book value of assets of the firms in the portfolio. The parameter values used in the model calibration are shown in Table 3.  \n\n# Table 1 Data: Baseline and extended value share decompositions  \n\nPanel A shows the results of the baseline decomposition of the cross-sectional variance of log book-to-market (bm) ratios into components related to the cross-sectional variation in realized stock returns (i.e., the value premium), minus ROE growth (i.e., the ROE growth spread), minus ROE level (i.e., the ROE level spread), and future log book-to-market ratios (i.e., the Value spread persistence) using twenty portfolios of stocks sorted on lagged bm from year $t$ toyear $t$ +horizon. The methodology is based on an extension of that from Cohen, Polk, and Vuolteenaho (2003). Panel B shows the results of the extended methodology in which, for each horizon, the value premium, the ROE growth spread, the ROE level spread, and the future value spread are further decomposed into subcomponents explained by, and orthogonal to, labor share. See Section 1 of the text and Appendix C for a full description of the baseline and extended decomposition methodologies. The sample period is from 1963 to 1999 (15-year window) up to 2017 (1-year window). Newey-West standard errors, with the number of lags matching the time-horizon N in the specification, are shown in parentheses.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"6\">A.Baselinedecomposition</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"7\">Value spread (VS) component</td></tr><tr><td>Horizon N</td><td colspan=\"2\">Value premium (VPN)</td><td colspan=\"2\">ROE growth spread (RGSN)</td><td colspan=\"2\">ROE level spread VS persistence (RLSN) (VSPN)</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td colspan=\"2\">0.027</td><td colspan=\"2\">-0.009 (0.005)</td><td colspan=\"2\">0.882 (0.010)</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td colspan=\"2\">(0.011) 0.048</td><td colspan=\"2\">(0.006) -0.033 0.198 (0.011) (0.014)</td><td colspan=\"2\">0.787 (0.019)</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td colspan=\"2\">(0.022) 0.067</td><td colspan=\"2\">-0.065 0.291</td><td colspan=\"2\">0.706</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td colspan=\"2\">(0.031) 0.096</td><td colspan=\"3\">(0.018) (0.022) -0.139 0.466</td><td colspan=\"2\">(0.025) 0.578 (0.030)</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td colspan=\"2\">(0.040) 0.128</td><td colspan=\"2\">(0.035) -0.345</td><td colspan=\"3\">(0.039) 0.846 0.371</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td colspan=\"2\">(0.048) 0.113 (0.044)</td><td colspan=\"2\">(0.069) -0.536</td><td colspan=\"2\">(0.083) 1.156</td><td colspan=\"2\">(0.021) 0.275</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"8\"></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"8\">VP VP RGS RLS VSP!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.540</td><td>0.460</td><td>0.064</td><td>RGS 0.936</td><td>RLS 0.230 (0.037)</td><td>0.770 0.231</td><td>VSP N 0.769</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>(0.168) 0.564</td><td>(0.353) 0.436</td><td>(0.280) 0.109</td><td>(0.532) 0.891</td><td>(0.076) 0.230 0.770</td><td>(0.039) 0.219</td><td>(0.045) 0.781</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>(0.196) 0.567</td><td>(0.357) 0.433</td><td>(0.091) 0.151</td><td>(0.306) 0.849</td><td>(0.040) (0.087) 0.230 0.770</td><td>(0.041) 0.206</td><td>(0.057) 0.794</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>(0.202) 0.480</td><td>(0.363) 0.520</td><td>(0.057) (0.258) 0.180 0.820</td><td>(0.042) 0.230</td><td>(0.094) 0.770</td><td>(0.039) 0.196</td><td>(0.064) 0.804</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>(0.178) 0.337</td><td>(0.355) 0.663</td><td>(0.054) 0.195</td><td>(0.215) 0.805</td><td>(0.042) (0.105) 0.230 0.770</td><td>(0.038) 0.190</td><td>(0.068) 0.810</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.135)</td><td>(0.331)</td><td>(0.053)</td><td>(0.170)</td><td>(0.036) (0.118)</td><td>(0.035)</td><td>(0.061)</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>0.314 (0.142)</td><td>0.686 (0.346)</td><td>0.187 (0.040)</td><td>0.813 (0.190)</td><td>0.230 0.770 (0.033) (0.124)</td><td>0.150 (0.030)</td><td>0.850 (0.095)</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n# Table 2 Data: Summary statistics  \n\nThe table reports time-series averages of yearly average characteristics of quintiles of firms sorted on log book-to-market (bm) ratio and on the components of bm explained by (bm\") and orthogonal to $(\\mathrm{bm}^{\\perp}$ )labor share. bm is the logarithm of the shareholders’ book value of equity divided by the market value of equity.

 \n\n# Table5 Model calibration: Summary of targeted and simulated moments  \n\nThe table shows the moments targeted by the model's calibration and the simulated moments generated by the calibrated model. The simulated moments are based on 1,000 simulated panels of data generated by the calibrated model. Each panel is populated by the histories of 1,000 firms over 792 months. The first 50 simulated years are used to generate the cross-sectional distributions for productivity and wages, and the remaining 16 years are used in the simulated moments shown below. The baseline decomposition is based on the value spread decomposition from Cohen, Polk, and Vuolteenaho (2003) into components related to post-formation cross-sectional variation in realized stock returns (i.e., the value premium), earnings growth (i.e., the growth spread), and future bm (i.e., the Value spread persistence). The ertended decomposition cross-sectionally decomposes the value spread into a component explained and a component orthogonal to the cross-section of labor shares. The target and model moments from the decompositions shown below are based on twenty portfolios of (real or simulated) stocks sorted on lagged bm. The parameter values used in the calibrated model are shown in Table 3.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Moment</td><td>Data (target)</td><td>Model (simulated)</td></tr><tr><td>A.Momentsfrombaselinedecomposition</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1-year horizon components of the Value spread</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VP1 (weight of 1-year horizon Value premium on Value spread)</td><td>0.027</td><td>0.028</td></tr><tr><td>RGS1 (weight of 1-year horizon ROE growth spread on Value spread)</td><td>-0.009</td><td>-0.022</td></tr><tr><td>RLS1 (weight of 1-year horizon ROE level spread on Value spread)</td><td>0.101</td><td>0.159</td></tr><tr><td>VSP1 (weight of 1-year Value spread persistence on Value spread)</td><td>0.882</td><td>0.835</td></tr><tr><td>5-year horizon components of the Value spread</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VP5 (weight of 5-year horizon Value premium on Value spread)</td><td>0.096</td><td>0.109</td></tr><tr><td>RGS5 (weight of 5-year horizon ROE growth spread on Value spread)</td><td>-0.139</td><td>-0.231</td></tr><tr><td>RLS5 (weight of 5-year horizon ROE level spread on Value spread)</td><td>0.466</td><td>0.681</td></tr><tr><td>VSP5 (weight of 5-year Value spread persistence on Value spread)</td><td>0.578</td><td>0.442</td></tr><tr><td>15-year horizon components of the Value spread</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VP15 (weight of 15-year horizon Value premium on Value spread)</td><td>0.113</td><td>0.178</td></tr><tr><td>RGS15 (weight of 15-year horizon ROE growth spread on Value spread)</td><td>-0.536</td><td>-0.734</td></tr><tr><td>RLS15 (weight of 15-year horizon ROE level spread on Value spread)</td><td>1.156</td><td>1.446</td></tr><tr><td>VSP15 (weight of 15-year Value spread persistence on Value spread)</td><td>0.275</td><td>0.098</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTable5   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Model calibration: Summary of targeted and simulated moments (cont'd)</td></tr><tr><td>Moment</td><td>Data (target)</td><td>Model (simulated)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">B.

Doa, Anh-Tuan Le b,\"  \n\nDepartment ofEconomics,Danang Architecture University,Danang,Vietnam b Department of Finance, National Central University, Taiwan  \n\n# ARTICLEINFO  \n\n# ABSTRACT  \n\nJEL classification:   \nE24   \nG31   \nG38  \n\nKeywords: Shareholder litigation rights Universal demand laws Labor investment efficiency  \n\nThis paper investigates the effect of shareholder litigation rights on labor investment efficiency. Using a difference-in-differences approach based on the staggered adoption of universal demand (UD) laws, we find that firms incorporated in states that have adopted UD laws experience lower labor investment efficiency. Furthermore, the negative association between UD law adoption and efficient labor investment is more concentrated in firms exposed to higher shareholder litigation risk ex ante and high-skilled labor firms. Our evidence is consistent with the notion of the passage of UD laws strengthens agency problems, and thus reduces labor investment efficiency.  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nThe legal protection of shareholders rights is well-recognized as an essential determinant of corporate governance (Shleifer and Vishny, 1997). The law allows shareholders to bring lawsuits against corporate management when they feel that managers inappropriately exploit their control positions. Ferris et al. (2007), for example, find that following shareholder lawsuits, firms reduce board size and increase outside representation, suggesting an effective corporate governance mechanism of shareholder litigation rights. In this paper, we examine how changes in shareholders’ ability to make legal claims against managers affect investment decisions, especially labor investment efficiency.  \n\nTo isolate the effects of shareholders litigation rights, we employ a quasi-natural experiment on staggered state-level adoption of universal demand (UD) laws. Since the late 1980s, 23 U.S. states have adopted UD laws. The adoption of UD laws has significantly weakened shareholders? litigation rights by raising procedural hurdles to initiate derivative lawsuits (Davis Jr, 2008). As a result, the laws weaken the governance power of shareholder litigation, and thus it becomes more difficult for shareholders to correct manager's misconduct. Indeed, Appel (2019) finds that firms tend to adopt governance provisions that entrench managers, limit shareholder's voice, and have lower blockholder ownership following the passage of UD laws. To the extent that the adoption of UD laws decreases the external discipline power of shareholder litigation, thereby exacerbating the managerial agency problem, it could be easier for self-interested managers to entrench and reduce labor investment efficiency. Furthermore, Ni and Yin (2018) document that weaker shareholder litigation rights following the adoption of UD laws lead to a higher cost of private debt. Hence, firms may face financial constraints after the law adoption, which lead to sub-optimal investment in labor (Caggese and Cunat, 2008; Caggese et al., 2019). Overall, this line of argument suggests that firms, following the passage of UD laws, are likely to decrease efficient labor investment.  \n\nUsing an extensive U.S. data of 60,841 firm-year observations from 1984 to 2010, we find that firms incorporated in states that have passed UD laws experience higher abnormal net hiring, indicating lower labor investment efficiency. The adoption of UD laws generates sub-optimal decisions under the forms of over-investment (i.e., over-hiring). Additional analyses reveal that the negative effect of UD laws on labor investment efficiency is more concentrated among firms that are ex ante more likely to face derivative lawsuits (measured by managerial entrenchment and institutional ownership concentration) and high-skilled labor firms  \n\nThis study contributes to several strands of existing literature. First, our work adds to the vein of growing research exploring determinants of labor investment efficiency, which is critical for firms in productions and businesses. However, the economic consequence of corporate law changes made at the state level on labor investment remains scarce in the literature. Prior research mainly focuses on the role of various firm-level aspects that curbs efficient corporate investment such as financial report quality Jung et al., 2014), stock price informativeness (Ben-Nasr and Alshwer, 2016), and financial constraints (Caggese et al., 2019). Our analysis focuses on managers' litigation risk from changes in policy at the state level, which potentially affect investment decisions at the firm level.  \n\nSecond, this study is closest to emerging studies on the effect of shareholder litigation rights. Advocates for shareholder litigation believe that the threat of shareholder litigation may benefit firms in reducing agency problems via limiting managers' ability to introduce governance provisions, thereby serving as an effective corporate governance mechanism (Ferris et al., 2007; Appel, 2019). In contrast, other scholars document the dark side of shareholder litigation, which is often frivolous, harms defendant firms' reputation, and increases external financing costs (Deng et al., 2014; Arena, 2018; Nguyen et al., 2018). We shed light on this debate by demonstrating weakened litigation rights for shareholders due to UD law adoption lead them to face greater agency conflicts, which ultimately translates into lower labor investment efficiency.  \n\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data, variables, and empirical design. Section 3 presents and discusses our empirical results. Section 4 concludes.  \n\n## 2. Data and methodology  \n\n### 2.1. Data selection  \n\nFollowing Bourveau et al. (2018), we collect the dataset on the historical state of incorporation for U.S. public firms posted on Bill McDonald's website, which provides relevant data based on firms' SEC electronic filings on EDGAR since 1994.1 For observations prior to 1994, we use the earliest reported state. For firms missing in the dataset, we use the state of incorporation information provided by Compustat. Based on this information of the adoption of UD laws shown in Table 1, we construct a dummy variable, ${\\mathrm{UD}}_{\\mathrm{it}},$ whichtakes one for firm i incorporated in a state that adopted the UD law by the fiscal year end t, and zero otherwise.  \n\nWe employ accounting and stock return data from Compustat and CRSP, respectively. Industry-level data on labor union membership are collected from Hirsch and Macpherson (2003). After excluding financial and utility firms, our data includes 60,841 firm-year observations covering the period 1984 - 2010.2 To reduce the influence of outliers, we winsorize all continuous variables at $1\\%$ level for both sides. For cross-sectional tests, we use data on the corporate governance index (Gompers et al., 2003) provided by the ISS director database and institutional ownership from the Thomson Reuters 13F database.  \n\n### 2.2. Measure of labor investment inefficiency  \n\nFollowing Pinnuck and Lillis (2007) and Khedmati et al.

The main independentvariable is $\\mathrm{UD}_{\\mathrm{i,t-1}}$ . We control for several factors that are documented in the literature (Jung et al., 2014; Ben-Nasr and Alshwer, 2016; Khedmati et al., 2019), including firm size, market-to-book ratio, financial leverage, tangible assets, liquidity ratio, financial report quality, dividend policy, reported loss, revenue volatility, net hiring volatility, abnormal investment in non-labor activities, labor intensity, union coverage. Definitions of all variables are provided in Appendix. We further control for firm and year fixed effects to deal with time-invariant unobservable variables, which further address bias due to the omitted variables.  \n\nTable 2 presents summary statistics of all the variables. The mean and standard deviation of Ab_NetHire are $15.4\\%$ and $21.9\\%$ respectively. UD indicator has a mean of 0.102, representing that $10.2\\%$ of the firm-year observations were affected by the UD laws.  \n\n## 3. Results and discussion  \n\n### 3.1. Main results  \n\nWe report the estimation results of Eq. (2) in Table 3. In Column (1), we only include UD indicator in the model whereas we add all control variables in Column (2). As is shown, we find that the estimated coefficients on UD indicator are positive and statistically significant at $5\\%$ level in both columns. In terms of significant magnitude, the adoption of UD laws increases firm abnormal net hiring by $0.009-0.011$ ,which is equivalent to $5.84\\%-7.14\\%$ of its sample mean. This finding is consistent with the notion that UD law adoption reduces the efficiency of labor investment. In addition, we find that shareholder litigation laws increase abnormal net hiring under forms of over-investment (i.e., over-hiring).3  \n\nIn Column (3) of Table 3, we include four dummy variables, namely UD (-1), UD (0), UD $(+1)$ andUD $(2+)$ equal to one if a state where firms incorporate that will pass the law next year, passes the law this year, passed the law one year ago, and passed the law two or more years ago, respectively. Interestingly, we find the coefficients on UD $(+1)$ and UD $(2+)$ are all positive and significant at the $10\\%$ level. However, there is no significant relation between UD $(-1)$ and UD (O) and abnormal net hiring. These results indicate that the increase in abnormal net hiring is correlated to the adoption of UD laws instead of time trends.  \n\n### 3.2. Robustness checks  \n\n#### 3.2.1. Controlling for possible confounding effects  \n\nWe next conduct several tests to ensure the robustness of our findings. First, Chu (2017) indicates that shareholders face difficulties engaging in class actions lawsuits due to a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in 1999. To discriminate against class action lawsuits, we exclude observations in the Ninth Circuit states: Alabama, Arizona, California, Hawai, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. As the regression result is shown in Column (1) of Panel A of Table 4, the coefficient on UD indicator remains positive and statistically significant, implying that the relationship between UD laws and corporate employment decisions cannot attribute to confound law changes regarding class action lawsuits.  \n\nSecond, it is worth noting that many firms tend to choose to run their business in Delaware due to corporation-friendly laws and tax benefits (Daines, 2001). This raises a question that the Delaware effect biases our findings on the impact of UD laws adoption and corporate employment decisions. To address this problem, we exclude firms incorporated in Delaware and re-examine our findings on this sample. As shown in Column (2) of Panel A of Table 4, the coefficient on UD indicator is still positive and statistically significant at the conventional level. Thereby, the Delaware effect does not confound our findings.  \n\nFinally, our third check aims to rule out a possibility that our results are driven by some confounding law changes, which are positively associated with efficient labor investment. For example, the adoption of many anti-takeover laws (i.e., Business Combinations laws (BC laws), Poison Pill legislation (PP laws)) occurs during the sample period, leading to bias in the estimation results. Further, Nguyen et al. (2018) also argue that the passage of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA) hampers shareholders' initiation of lawsuits. To address this issue, we include several confounding law changes as additional controls.  \n\nWe include three additional dummy variables (BC laws, PP laws, PSLRA). BC laws (PP laws) as a dummy variable is set to one for a state-year in which the BC law (PP law) is active, and zero otherwise. Similarly, PSLRA takes a value of one in the effective years of PSLRA, and zero otherwise. The results are reported in Model (3) of Panel A of Table 4. As is shown, the coefficients of UD indicator remain positive and significant, indicating that our findings are robust to controlling for the adoption of the BC laws, PP laws, and PSLRA.  \n\n#### 3.2.2. Propensity score matching  \n\nOne may argue that differences in firm characteristics between treatment and control firms could partially drive our main results. Therefore, we additionally conduct a DiD analysis using propensityscore matching following prior studies Bourveau et al., 2018). The treatment group consists of firms incorporated in the states that adopted UD laws. In contrast, the control group consists of firms with similar characteristics but incorporated in the different states that have not adopted UD laws during our sample period. We match firms using one-to-one nearest neighbor propensity score matching, without replacement. We also include all control variables as in the baseline regression. The results are reported in Panel B of Table 4. We find that the main findings still hold, thereby mitigating a concern that self-selection bias, given the states that have adopted the UD laws might be different in terms of applying the laws.  \n\n#### 3.2.3. Alternative measures of labor investment efficiency  \n\nTo provide more robust evidence, we consider two alternative definitions of labor investment efficiency. First, following Jung et al. (2014), we use the industry-level mean to capture a firm's deviation from its industry median as abnormal net hiring. Industries are classified by using 48-industry codes by Fama and French (1997). Second, we replace the net hiring in Eq. (1) with labor cost, and the difference between the actual and expected labor cost is then defined as the inefficient labor investment measure in Eq. (2), as suggested in Ben-Nasr and Alshwer (2016). The results of these tests are reported in Panel C of Table 4. We find that the coefficients on UD Indicator remain positive and significant, suggesting that our findings do not depend on our definition of labor investment efficiency.  \n\n#### 3.2.4.Labor and non-labor investments  \n\nThe relation between the adoption of UD laws and labor investment efficiency may be driven by the relation between the adoption of UD laws and the efficiency of other investments (e.g., capital, research and development, advertising, and acquisition investments) due to the complementarity between these investments and labor (Ben-Nasr and Alshwer, 2016;Sualihu et al., 2021). Although such influence is mitigated by including abnormal investment as a control in Eq. (2), we examine, more directly, the impact of these  \n\nPanel A: Control for posible confounding effects; This panel reports the results from three robustnesstests The dependent variable is abnormal net hiring Ab NetHire) UD indicator is an indicator variable equals one if a fm is incorporated in a state that has passed a UD law, and zero otherwise.

Specifically, following Ben-Nasr and Alshwer (2016) and Ghaly et al. (2020), we consider four kinds of non-labor investments: capital, R&D, advertising, and acquisition. In each of these four types, we divide our sample into three subsamples (positive, negative, and zero/missing) based on the correlation between net hiring and that particular kind of investment. First, if a firm increases (decreases) net hiring in response to the increase (decrease) in the non-labor investments, we classify the firm into the “positive” group. In contrast, if a firm decreases (increases) net hiring in response to the increase (decrease) in the non-labor investments, we classify the firm into the “negative” group. Finally, the third group is “zero/missing\"” which includes those without relation between net hiring and non-labor investment or missing observations. We present the results in Panel D of Table 4. We find consistent results that UD laws increase abnormal net hiring in all four groups. Overall, our results provide strong evidence that the linkage between shareholder litigation laws and labor investment efficiency is not attributed to other non-labor investments.  \n\n### 3.3. Cross-sectional analysis  \n\n#### 3.3.1. Ex ante probability of shareholder derivative litigation  \n\nSo far, we document that the adoption of UD laws reduces labor investment efficiency. In this vein, it is expected that this effect is more concentrated in firms that are ex ante more likely to face derivative lawsuits. Entrenched managers are more likely to engage in misbehaviors, resulting in increasing probabilities of facing derivative lawsuits (Ferris et al., 2007). We first split our sample into two subsamples based on the median value of G-index at year t-1 by Gompers et al. (2003). We predict the adverse effect of UD laws on labor investment efficiency is stronger for the High G-index group, which features by higher managerial entrenchment. Second,  \n\n# Table 6.  \n\nHigh-skilled versus low-skilled labor.   \nThis table reports the effects of UD laws on the labor investment efficiency, conditional on the degree of labor skill. The dependent variable is abnormal net hiring (Ab_NetHire). UD indicator is an indicator variable equals one if a firm is incorporated in a state that has passed a UD law, and zero otherwise. The sample is split into two subsamples based on the median values of the skilled labor index. Following Ghaly et al. (2017), we construct labor skill index (LSI), which is the weighted average skill level of all occupations within an industry, and provides a proxy for an industry's reliance on skilled labor. We define a firm that relies more on skilled labor if its LSI is greater than the sample median in each year. The Appendix provides definitions of all variables. Differences between the coefficients on UD indicator for the two subsamples are measured using the Chow test. t-statistics based on heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors clustered by states of incorporation are reported in parentheses.

We employ institutional ownership concentration (InstOwn HHI) from the 13-F filings provided by Thomson Reuters as a proxy for ex ante likelihood of facing derivative lawsuits. We also classify firms into the High or Low group based on the sample median of the lagged value of InstOwn HHI. Table 5 shows the regression results for these tests. Consistent with our conjecture, we observe that the positive effect of the adoption of UD laws is positive and significant only for firms with a high G-index or high institutional ownership concentration. Hence, findings in Table 5 confirm that shareholder litigation is a vital governance device, and impairment of such corporate governance reduces a firm's investment efficiency.  \n\n#### 3.3.2.High-skilled versus low-skilled labor  \n\nWe argue that the effect of shareholder litigation rights and labor investment efficiency varies with the degree of a firm's use of skilled labor. Indeed, firms using more skilled labor have a greater need to finance labor, and are less able to invest efficiently in labor (Oi, 1962; Autor et al., 2006). Following Ghaly et al. (2017), we construct a labor skill index (LS1), which is the weighted average skill level of all occupations within an industry.4 We define a firm that relies more on skilled labor if its LSI is greater than the sample median each year.  \n\nThe results in Table 6 show that the impact of shareholder litigation laws on labor investment efficiency is positive and significant only for firms that rely more on skilled labor. The difference of coefficients between High- and Low-skilled labor group is significant at $5\\%$ level. In sum, our findings are consistent with the view that firms belonging to industries that rely more on skilled labor have higher labor adjustment and hence are less able to invest efficiently in labor.  \n\n## 4. Conclusion  \n\nShareholder litigation rights have recently been paid attention to in emerging studies. In this study, we examine the relationship between the adoption of UD laws and labor investment efficiency. Using a large sample of U.S. firms from 1984 to 2010, we find firms incorporated in states that have adopted UD laws are likely to have lower labor investment efficiency. Further analyses indicate that the effect is stronger for firms with higher probabilities of facing derivative lawsuits and high-skilled labor firms. Overall, our study enriches the existing literature related to shareholder litigation rights under the aspect of agency theory. This strand of argument supports that the staggered adoption of UD laws increases agency problems, attributed to sub-optimal corporate employment decisions.  \n\nAppendix: Variables definitions   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variables</td><td>Definitions</td></tr><tr><td>Ab_Nethire</td><td>Abnormal nethiring measuresforlaborinvestmentinefficiency as the absolute differencebetween the actual and thepredicted labor investment estimated based on Pinnuck and Lillis (2007)'s model.</td></tr><tr><td>Net Hire</td><td>The percentage change in the number of employees.</td></tr><tr><td>Hire_Predicted</td><td>The predicted value of the percentage change in the number of employees estimated based on Pinnuck and Lillis(2oo7)'s model.</td></tr><tr><td>UD indicator</td><td>An indicator variable equals one if afirm is incorporated in a state that has passed a UD law,and zero otherwise.</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>Natural logarithm of total assets.</td></tr><tr><td>MB</td><td>Market-to-bookratio.</td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td>Leverage ratio as the sum of debt in current liabilities and total long-term debt, divided by total assets.</td></tr><tr><td>Tangible</td><td>The proportion of property,plant, and equipment to total assets.</td></tr><tr><td>Quick</td><td>The ratio of cash and short-term investments plus receivables to current liabilities.</td></tr><tr><td>Accrual</td><td>The absolute value of discretionary accrual,estimated bymodified Jones (1991)modelfor each industry in eachyear.</td></tr><tr><td>DivDum</td><td>An indicator variable coded one if firm paid dividends in previous year, and zero otherwise.</td></tr><tr><td>Loss_ROA</td><td>AdummyvariablecodedoneiffirmhadnegativeROA,andzerootherwise.</td></tr><tr><td>Vol_Revt</td><td>Five-yearrolling-windowstandarddeviation ofsales.</td></tr><tr><td>Vol_Nethiring</td><td>Five-yearrolling-windowstandarddeviationofthechangeinnumberofemployees.</td></tr><tr><td>Abnormal_Invest</td><td>Abnormal other(non-labor)investments,defined as the absolute magnitude of theresidualfrom thefollowing equation:Invest_Otherit=Oo+ 0Sales_Growthit-1+&it where Invest_Other=capital expenditures+research and development expenditures+ acquisition expenditures-cash</td></tr><tr><td>Labor Intensity</td><td>receipts from the sale of property, plant, and equipment, all scaled by lagged total assets for firm i in year t.</td></tr><tr><td>Union</td><td>Laborintensity as theratio of number of employees to total assets.

    "reference_markdown": "# Organization Capital and the Cross-Section of Expected Returns  \n\nANDREA L.EISFELDT and DIMITRIS PAPANIKOLAOU\\*  \n\n## ABSTRACT  \n\nOrganization capital is a production factor that is embodied in the firm's key talent and has an efficiency that is firm specific. Hence, both shareholders and key talent have a claim to its cash flows. We develop a model in which the outside option of the key talent determines the share of firm cash fows that accrue to shareholders. This outside option varies systematically and renders firms with high organization capital riskier from shareholders’ perspective. We find that firms with more organization capital have average returns that are $4.6\\%$ higher than firms with less organization capital.  \n\nIN RECENT DECADES, INTANGIBLE capital has become an increasingly important factor of production. In many instances, such intangible capital is embodied in the firm's key employees. We refer to this type of intangible capital as organization capital and develop a structural model to analyze its effect on asset prices. We argue that shareholders consider firms with high levels of organization capital to be riskier than firms with more physical capital, and provide empirical evidence supporting this claim.  \n\nOrganization capital is a durable input in production that is distinct from physical capital. In our model, the distinguishing features of organization capital are that its efficiency is partly firm specific and that it is embodied in the firm's key talent. Together, these two characteristics imply that both shareholders and key talent have a claim on the cash flows accruing from organization capital. Since shareholders can appropriate only a fraction of the cash fows from organization capital, investing in firms with high organization capital exposes them to additional risks.  \n\nThe cash fows that accrue to shareholders are determined in part by the division of surplus between shareholders and key talent. In our model, this sharing rule depends on the shock to the level of productivity of organization capital deployed in new firms, which we refer to as the level of frontier organization capital technology. This shock determines the outside option of key talent and hence the share of cash flows from organization capital that shareholders can appropriate.  \n\nAs a result, shareholders′ cash flows from physical and organization capital have different risk exposures to the frontier technology shock. If the frontier technology shock is correlated with shareholders’ marginal utility, heterogeneity in firms' asset composition between physical and organization capital leads to differences in risk premia, as shareholders demand compensation for the additional risk they are exposed to.  \n\nTo study the empirical relation between organization capital and risk premia, we construct a measure of organization capital using widely available accounting data. Following the accounting literature on measuring organization capital (see, e.g., Lev and Radhakrishnan (2005), we measure the stock of organization capital by cumulating firms' selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses using the perpetual inventory method. We rank firms based on their ratio of organization capital to book assets relative to their industry peers $(O/K)$ , since the accounting treatment of SG&A expenses varies across industries.  \n\nOur measure of organization capital is correlated with a number of firm characteristics in a manner that is consistent with our model. We find that high$O/K$ firms are more productive, smaller, have higher Tobin's $Q$ anddisplay higher levels of executive compensation. In addition, high- $O/K$ firmshave higher managerial quality scores according to the measure of Bloom and Van Reenen (2007), spend more on information technology (IT), and are more likely to list “loss of key personnel\" as a risk factor in their 10-K filings. Furthermore, our model implies that the sensitivity of firm profits to firm output increases with the ratio of organization to physical capital, whereas the sensitivity of firm profits to aggregate output is the same across firms. We find support for these implications in the data.  \n\nThe evidence suggests that shareholders demand higher risk premia to invest in firms with high levels of organization capital relative to firms with more physical capital. We document this difference in risk premia by constructing a portfolio that is long firms with more organization capital relative to their peers (high- $O/K)$ and short firms with more physical capital relative to their peers (low- $O/K)$ . The portfolio of firms with high- $O/K$ minus low- $O/K$ (the OMK portfolio) has average returns of $4.7\\%$ per year and a Sharpe ratio close to the market portfolio. Moreover, the OMK portfolio is uncorrelated with other risk factors such as the market portfolio, size, value, or momentum. Thus, the dispersion in expected returns arising from heterogeneity in the ratio of organization capital to assets is not explained by the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), Fama and French (1993), or Carhart (1997) models.  \n\nOur model implies that this spread in average returns arises because the OMK portfolio is negatively correlated with the systematic frontier technology shock. Empirically, we find that a two-factor model that includes the market and the OMK portfolio prices the cross-section of firms sorted on $O/K$ orontheir beta with the OMK portfolio. In addition, and consistent with our model, the realized return of the OMK portfolio is negatively correlated with the aggregate level of compensation to key talent, the level of reallocation, and the level of investment in organization capital.  \n\nWe calibrate our structural model and show that it can quantitatively replicate our empirical findings. Our model matches the dispersion in firm characteristics and risk premia associated with organization capital. In our calibration, we assume that the frontier technology shock carries a negative risk premium. An improvement in the frontier technology leads to more restructuring and reallocation of organization capital from old firms to new firms. Since restructuring entails substantial costs in the short run, this assumption is consistent with general equilibrium. We also provide generalized method of moments (GMM) estimates of the market price of risk associated with the frontier technology shock, and find that it is negative for all three of our proxies for the frontier shock.  \n\nIn summary, our work identifies a new source of risk for shareholders: systematic fuctuations in the division of surplus between key talent and shareholders. From the perspective of shareholders, investing in key talent and organization capital is risky, since, unlike physical capital, shareholders do not own all ofthe cash fow rights. Key talent may leave the firm when their outside option exceeds their inside value. Consequently, organization capital has risk characteristics distinct from those of physical capital, and the risk inherent in this type of specific and intangible form of capital requires significant risk premia.  \n\nOur paper belongs to a growing body of work that explores the role of organization capital in the production process and analyzes its properties (Prescott and Visscher (1980), Hall (2000b), Atkeson and Kehoe (2005), Carlin, Chowdhry, and Garmaise (2011), Lustig, Syverson, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2011). The closest paper to ours is Lustig, Syverson, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2011), who argue that the growing importance of organization capital in the production process is one of the leading causes of the observed increase in compensation inequality and pay-for-performance sensitivity, and the accompanying decrease in labor market reallocation. Our work builds upon Atkeson and Kehoe (2005) and Lustig, Syverson, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2011), to introduce a common stochastic component in the productivity of organization capital in new firms, or frontier technology using the language of Atkeson and Kehoe (2005).  \n\nMoreover, our paper is related to the production-based asset pricing literature (Cochrane (1991, 1996) and in particular to models with endogenous production (Berk, Green, and Naik (1999), Gomes, Kogan, and Zhang (2003), Zhang (2005), Bazdrech, Belo, and Lin (2009)). Most of these models feature a single aggregate shock and generate heterogeneity in asset risk premia through endogenous movements in conditional betas with the market portfolio. In contrast, our model generates heterogeneity in asset risk premia through exposure to a second systematic source of risk, the frontier level of technology, which affects the division of surplus between shareholders and key talent. This systematic shock is an example of technical change embodied in human capital. The macroeconomic literature argues that human-capital-embodied technological change is important for understanding the dynamic behavior of income inequality in the data (Chari and Hopenhayn (1991), Greenwood (1999), Krusell Ohanian, Rios-Rull, and Volante. (2000)).  \n\nOur model captures the idea that key talent and shareholders have a joint claim on the cash fows produced by the firm. Mounting evidence suggests that executives significantly affect corporate outcomes (Bertrand and Schoar (2003), Adams, Almeida, and Ferreira (2009), Graham, Harvey, and Puri (2009), Bennedsen, Pérez-Gonzalez, and Wolfenzon (2011)). In addition, pay of corporate executives accounts for a significant fraction of corporate earnings. Bebchuk (2005) documents that the ratio of executive pay to corporate earnings has risen dramatically in recent years. New evidence suggests that broader classifications of key talent are also important for firm performance. Bernstein (2012) documents the departure of skilled inventors in firms post-IPO, which is associated with a subsequent decline in innovation activity. On the valuation side, Tate and Yang (2011) provide evidence using matched worker/plant data that high-skill workers in diversified firms have better ex-post outcomes following plant closures. Using our model, they argue that the diversification discount may be due to the higher outside option of skilled labor in diversified firms.  \n\nThere are inherent difficulties involved in the measurement of organization capital (Blair and Wallman (2001), Black and Lynch (2005)). Black and Lynch (2005, p. 206) argue that one of the main difficulties is that organization capital “cannot be wholly controlled by the firm.\" Our measure of organization capital is motivated by Lev and Radhakrishnan (2005), who argue that firm SG&A expenditures create corporate value through the formation of organization capital. A number of papers in the organization literature measure the quality of the firm's organizational structure and management practices using surveys (Caroli and Van Reenen (2001), Bresnahan, Brynjolfsson, and Hitt (2002), Bloom and Van Reenen (2007)). Our measure has the advantage that it is readily available for a long time period and a large number of firms. The second alternative method of measuring organization capital is as a residual from a structural model. While this methodology avoids some of the difficulties inherent in measuring intangibles, the resulting estimates are sensitive to the model specification. McGrattan and Prescott (2001) and Hall (2000a, 2001) argue that intangible capital played an important role in the valuation of the U.S. corporate sector in the 1990s. Using a structural model with technology adoption, Atkeson and Kehoe (2005) estimate that the payment fows to the owners of organization capital constitute $8\\%$ of output for manufacturing firms. Hansen, Heaton, and Li (2005) measure intangible capital by requiring that the risk adjusted investment returns to total capital be equal across firms.  \n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows Section I develops our modeling framework, Section II details our procedure for measuring organization capital, Section IHI explores the model's predictions, and Section IV concludes. Details on data construction are delegated to the Appendix.  \n\n## 1. Model  \n\nWe develop a model illustrating how, from shareholders' perspective, investment in organization capital entails different risks from investment in physical capital. In our view, there are two defining characteristics of organization capital. First, organization capital is embodied in highly specialized labor inputs, and thus is distinct from physical capital. We refer to these specialized labor inputs as key talent throughout the paper, examples of which are management and technical personnel that are essential to the firm. Second, the effciency of organization capital is specific to the firm, which distinguishes it from general human capital. Hence, an alternative to organization capital could be firm-specific human capital, consistent with the views in Prescott and Visscher (1980). Under this more narrow definition, one could view investment in organization capital as expenditures on hiring and training key talent. Hired and trained key talent would increase overall firm cash fow, but would require higher compensation when their outside option improved.  \n\nThe unique nature of organization capital implies that both shareholders and key talent have a claim to its cash fows. In particular, organization capital is embodied in key talent, and is therefore potentially movable across firms. As a result, key talent can extract a payment from shareholders equal to their outside option. The value of this claim depends on the efficiency of organization capital in new firms. Shareholders have a claim to the residual cash fows, and the value of this claim depends on the difference between the inside and outside value of organization capital. Furthermore, systematic movements in the efficiency of organization capital in new firms lead to systematic movements in the division of organization capital rents between shareholders and key talent. Therefore, shareholders investing in firms with organization capital areexposedto additionalrisks.  \n\nWe first present a simple model in Section I.A that illustrates these ideas and yields closed-form solutions. We extend the basic model along a number of dimensions in Section I.B. The extended model yields additional predictions and helps us assess the quantitative importance of organization capital in explaining the cross section of expected returns.  \n\n### A. Basic Model  \n\nThere exists a continuum of frms that produce a common output good using physical capital $K$ and organization capital $O$ . Given an endowment of physical and organization capital, firm $i$ produces a flow of output given by  \n\n$$\ny_{i,t}=\\theta_{t}K_{i}+\\theta_{t}e^{\\varepsilon_{i}}O_{i}.\n$$  \n\nBoth capital stocks are subject to an aggregate, disembodied technology shock $\\theta$ . In addition, the productivity of the firm's stock of organization capital $O_{i}$ depends on the efficiency of that firm's organization $\\varepsilon_{i}$ . The level of efficiency $\\varepsilon_{i}$ can be viewed as the quality of the match between the firm and key talent. The firm-specificity of $\\varepsilon$ captures the idea that part of the knowledge embodied in organization capital is specific to the firm. For now we assume that the endowment of physical capital $K_{i}$ and organization capital $O_{i}$ , as well as the efficiency of the firm's organization $\\varepsilon_{i}$ , are constant over time.1  \n\nThe total factor productivity (TFP) shock $\\theta$ evolves according to a geometric random walk,  \n\n$$\nd\\theta_{t}=\\sigma_{\\theta}\\theta_{t}d Z_{t}^{\\theta},\n$$  \n\nwhere $d Z_{t}^{\\theta}$ is a Wiener process and $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ corresponds to the volatility of the common TFP shock $\\theta$ . The productivity shock $\\theta$ affects physical and organization capital symmetrically, thus all firms have the same sensitivity of revenue to $\\theta$  \n\nIn the spirit of Atkeson and Kehoe (2005), new technologies that improve the frontier efficiency of organization capital emerge over time. Key talent can either upgrade the organizational efficiency in the existing firm (restructure) or leave the existing firm along with part of the accumulated knowledge and existing organization structure $O$ to a newly created firm (reallocation).2 Given the existence of this outside option, key talent can always extract all of the surplus from restructuring. Creating a new firm requires a positive amount of physical capital $K_{i}$ . Key talent can buy this physical capital at its competitive market price, and finance this purchase by issuing shares in the new firm. Existing shareholders are thus indifferent between selling their claim to physical capital $K_{i}$ to key talent or restructuring the existing firm. As a result, the model is silent as to the form of the technology adoption process. For parsimony, in our discussion of the model we assume the former.  \n\nOur model implies that new technologies are adopted through a process of creation and destruction, whereby inefficient organization technologies are replaced with the frontier level of organizational efficiency. This process of creation and destruction can be interpreted in several ways. For instance, if the shareholders in the new firm are different from the shareholders in the existing frm, then this process resembles a management buy-out, a start-up, or other form of venture financing, depending on how the purchase of physical capital is financed. Alternatively, if the shareholders in the old firm also own shares in the new firm, then we can interpret this process as a restructuring event. In this case, when the firm decides to upgrade its organization capital, the firm undergoes a period of extensive reorganization that leads to a higher level of organization efficiency.  \n\n1 Our production function is similar to that in van Rens (2004) and assumes that there are no complementarities between organization and physical capital. This assumption allows us to preserve tractability and illustrate our economic mechanism. Exploring the complementarities between organization and physical capital could be important, but we leave such investigation to futurework.  \n\n2 For simplicity, we assume that the old firm loses the organization capital as a result of key talent leaving. This assumption captures not just the direct loss in firm value due to key talent leaving the firm, but also indirect losses due to increased competition in the product market by frms that now have inside knowledge of the firm's corporate practices. Several papers provide empirical evidence that changes in management affect value (Bertrand and Schoar (2003), Adams, Almeida, and Ferreira (2009), Graham, Harvey, and Puri (2009), Bennedsen, Pérez-Gonzalez, and Wolfenzon (2011)), and that loss of key employees reduces innovation (Bernstein (2012)). In Section I1.B we provide evidence from 10-K's that loss of key personnel destroys value in high organization capital firms.  \n\nKey talent thus optimally chooses the time $\\tau$ at which to exercise their option to upgrade to the frontier technology. After this option is exercised, the new firm operates at a level of organizational efficiency $\\varepsilon_{i}=x_{\\tau}$ forever. The level of frontier efficiency $x$ evolves according to a random walk,  \n\n$$\nd x_{t}=\\sigma_{x}d Z_{t}^{x},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\sigma_{x}$ is the volatility of $x$ and $d Z_{t}^{x}$ is a Wiener process independent from $d Z_{t}^{\\theta}$ . Equation (3) implies that the frontier level of organizational efficiency $x$ varies systematically, capturing the idea that the benefit of upgrading to new technologies varies with the state of the economy. For now, we assume that the option to upgrade to the frontier technology can be exercised only once.  \n\nThe stochastic discount factor (SDF) in this economy is given by  \n\n$$\nd\\pi_{t}=-r_{f}\\pi_{t}d t-\\gamma_{\\theta}\\pi_{t}d Z_{t}^{\\theta}-\\gamma_{x}\\pi_{t}d Z_{t}^{x},\n$$  \n\nwhere the parameters $r_{f},\\gamma_{\\theta}$ ,and $\\gamma_{x}$ correspond to the interest rate, the price of risk for the aggregate technological shock $\\theta$ , and the price of risk for the frontier shock $x$ , respectively.  \n\nThe value of an existing firm equals the sum of the value of physical capital plus the value of organization capital:  \n\n$$\nV_{i t}=V_{i t}^{K}+V_{i t}^{O}.\n$$  \n\nGiven the specification of output (1), the SDF (4), and the value of the option to upgrade to a new level of organization effciency, we value each component of firm value in equation (5) separately. We then determine the division of the value of organization capital $V^{O}$ between shareholders and key talent.  \n\nThe value of physical capital $V^{K}$ equals the present value of the cash flows accruing from physical capital discounted at the risk-adjusted rate $\\bar{r}=r_{f}+$ $\\sigma_{\\theta}\\gamma_{\\theta}$  \n\n$$\nV^{K}(\\theta_{t},K_{i})=E_{t}\\int_{t}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\pi_{s}}{\\pi_{t}}\\theta_{s}K_{i}d s=\\frac{\\theta_{t}}{\\bar{r}}K_{i}.\n$$  \n\nShareholders own the claim to the firm's physical capital $K_{i}$ , and thus they can fully appropriate $V^{K}$  \n\nThe value of organization capital $V^{O}$ equals the present value of the discounted future cash fows during the time that organization capital remains with the firm $(t<\\tau)$ , plus its outside value ${\\overline{{V}}}^{O}$ in the event of reallocation at the optimal stopping time $\\tau$  \n\n$$\nV^{O}(\\theta_{t},O_{i},\\varepsilon_{i},x_{t})=E_{t}\\int_{t}^{\\tau}\\frac{\\pi_{s}}{\\pi_{t}}\\theta_{s}e^{\\varepsilon_{i}}O_{i}d s+E_{t}\\left[\\frac{\\pi_{\\tau}}{\\pi_{t}}\\overline{{V}}^{O}(\\theta_{\\tau},O_{i},x_{\\tau})\\right].\n$$  \n\nIf key talent exercises their outside option at time $\\tau$ ,，then organization capital will forever operate at the efficiency level $\\varepsilon_{i}=x_{\\tau}$ . Thus, the value of organization capital once the outside option is exercised equals  \n\n$$\n\\overline{{{V}}}^{O}(\\theta_{t},O_{i},x_{t})=E_{t}\\int_{t}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\pi_{s}}{\\pi_{t}}\\theta_{s}e^{x_{t}}O_{i}d s=\\frac{\\theta_{t}}{\\bar{r}}e^{x_{t}}O_{i}.\n$$  \n\nKey talent will optimally choose the stopping time $\\tau$ , balancing the gains from reallocation versus the value of the option to wait. When the efficiency of organization capital $\\varepsilon_{i}$ lags behind the frontier $x_{t}$ , the owners of the organization capital have an incentive to leave for a newly created firm. The gain from reallocation depends on the value of the inside option minus the outside option, that is, on $\\varepsilon_{i}$ relative to $x_{t}$ . As a result, key talent will reallocate organization capital to a new firm once the value of the frontier efficiency $x$ exceeds the level of productivity in the existing firm $\\varepsilon_{i}$ by a sufficient amount. This threshold $\\varepsilon^{*}(x)$ below which reallocation occurs is determined by the indifference condition  \n\n$$\n{\\cal V}^{{\\cal O}}(\\theta_{t},{\\cal O}_{i},\\varepsilon^{*}(x_{t}),x_{t})=\\overline{{{{\\cal V}}}}^{{\\cal O}}(\\theta_{t},{\\cal O}_{i},x_{t}).\n$$  \n\nThe following proposition solves for the value of organization capital in equation (7) and the optimal exercise boundary $\\varepsilon^{*}(x)$ in closed form:  \n\nPROPOsITION 1: The value of organization capital equals  \n\n$$\nV^{{\\cal O}}(\\theta_{t},{\\cal O}_{i},\\varepsilon_{i},x_{t})=\\frac{\\theta_{t}}{\\bar{r}}{\\cal O}_{i}\\left[e^{\\varepsilon_{i}}+\\frac{\\sigma_{x}}{\\sqrt{2\\bar{r}}}e^{\\bar{x}_{i}+\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\bar{r}}}{\\sigma_{x}}(x_{t}-\\bar{x}_{i})}\\right],\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\begin{array}{r}{\\bar{x}_{i}=\\varepsilon_{i}-\\log(1-\\frac{\\sigma_{x}}{\\sqrt{2\\bar{r}}})}\\end{array}$ The threshold $\\varepsilon^{*}(x)$ at which it is optimal to real. locate the organization capital is given by  \n\n$$\n\\varepsilon^{*}(x_{t})=x_{t}+\\log\\left(1-\\frac{\\sigma_{x}}{\\sqrt{2\\bar{r}}}\\right).\n$$  \n\nProof: Key talent faces an optimal stopping time problem. Key talent chooses a threshold $\\bar{x}$ such that it adopts the new technology if $x_{t}\\geq\\bar{x}$ . We conjecture that the value of organization capital equals $\\theta_{t}O_{i}v(x)$ . Equation (7) implies that, for $t<\\tau$ , the unknown function $v(x)$ satisfies the ordinary differential equation  \n\n$$\ne^{\\varepsilon}-\\bar{r}v(x)+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_{x}^{2}v_{x x}(x)=0\\qquad\\mathrm{if}\\quad x<\\bar{x}.\n$$  \n\nThe solution to the ordinary differential equation is given by  \n\n$$\nv(x_{t})=\\frac{e^{\\varepsilon_{i}}}{\\bar{r}}+C_{1}e^{\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\bar{r}}}{\\sigma_{x}}x_{t}}+C_{2}e^{-\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\bar{r}}}{\\sigma_{x}}x_{t}}.\n$$  \n\nThe three unknown constants $\\bar{x},C_{1}$ , and $C_{2}$ are jointly determined by: (i) the boundary condition $\\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname*{lim}_{x\\to-\\infty}V^{O}(\\theta_{t},O_{i},\\varepsilon_{i},x_{t})=\\frac{\\theta_{t}}{\\bar{r}}e^{\\varepsilon_{i}}O_{i}}\\end{array}$ , which guarantees that the option to move to the new technology is worthless when $x$ is very low, implying that $C_{2}=0$ ; (ii) the smooth-pasting condition $v_{x}(\\bar{x})=e^{\\bar{x}}/\\bar{r}$ ; and (ii) the indifference (value-matching) condition $\\upsilon(\\bar{x})=e^{\\bar{x}}/\\bar{r}$ . Under the regularity condition r > 2 $\\bar{r}>\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_{x}^{2}$ $\\bar{x}$ $\\bar{x}_{i}=\\varepsilon_{i}-\\log(1-$ $\\frac{\\sigma_{x}}{\\sqrt{2\\bar{r}}})$ $\\varepsilon^{*}(x)$  \n\nProposition 1 solves for the total value of organization capital $V^{O}$ .Thevalue of organization capital is increasing in both the level of organization effciency in the existing firm $\\varepsilon_{i}$ and the level of frontier technology $x$ . This value $V^{O}$ must be split between shareholders and key talent, since both have a claim on the cash flows accruing from organization capital $O$ . Hence, the final step to determining the shareholder value of the firm consists of computing the value of organization capital that can be captured by shareholders. This value equals the difference between the total value of organization capital (7) and the rents that key talent can extract.  \n\nThe rents that key talent can extract from organization capital depend on the efficiency of organization capital in new firms, which is determined by $x_{t}$ Prior to time $\\tau$ , key talent has the option to depart for a new firm and receive a payoff ${\\overline{{V}}}^{O}$ ; given by equation (8). Shareholders can prevent this reallocation by promising key talent a continuation value $W_{i t}$ that is at least as high as the key talent's outside option ${\\overline{{V}}}^{O}$ . We assume that shareholders cannot commit to giving key talent a payoff greater than its outside option, hence $W_{i t}=\\overline{{V}}_{i t}^{O}$ always. Thus, the present value of rents that shareholders can extract from organization capital equals the difference between the total value of organization capital (10) and the value of key talent's outside option (8):  \n\n$$\nV^{O S}(\\theta_{t},O_{i},\\varepsilon_{i},x_{t})=\\frac{\\theta_{t}}{\\bar{r}}O_{i}\\left(e^{\\varepsilon_{i}}+\\frac{\\sigma_{x}}{\\sqrt{2\\bar{r}}}e^{\\bar{x}+\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\bar{r}}}{\\sigma_{x}}(x_{t}-\\bar{x})}-e^{x_{t}}\\right).\n$$  \n\nThe value that shareholders can extract from organization capital (12) consists of two terms. The first term ${\\frac{\\theta_{t}}{\\bar{r}}}O_{i}e^{\\varepsilon_{i}}$ is increasing in the efficiency level of organization capital, since shareholders own a claim to the firm-specific level of organizational efficiency $\\varepsilon_{i}$ . Absent the option to upgrade to the new technology, this would be the only source of value. However, the key talent owns the decision right to leave for a new firm and operate at a level of organization efficiency $x$ , and thus it will capture some rents from organization capital. The value ofthese rents depends on key talent's outside option, which is determined by $x$ relative to the firm-specific level of efficiency $\\varepsilon_{i}$ . Hence, shareholders effectively have a short position in an option whose value is increasing in the level of frontier technology $x$ . The value of this option is captured by the last two terms in equation (12).  \n\nThe total shareholder value of the firm equals the sum of the values of physical capital (6) and organization capital (12):  \n\n$$\nV_{i t}^{S}=\\frac{\\theta_{t}}{\\bar{r}}\\left[K_{i}+O_{i}\\left(e^{\\varepsilon_{i}}+\\frac{\\sigma_{x}}{\\sqrt{2\\bar{r}}}e^{\\bar{x}+\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\bar{r}}}{\\sigma_{x}}(x_{t}-\\bar{x})}-e^{x_{t}}\\right)\\right].\n$$  \n\nThe shareholder value of the firm is decreasing in the level of the frontier technologyshock $x$ .3 Prior to the reallocation of organization capital $(x<\\bar{x}_{i})$ ,an increase in the frontier shock $x$ leads shareholders to concede more rents to key talent in order to induce them to remain within the firm. When shareholders are unwilling to give up more rents to key talent, key talent decides to leave. At the point $x=\\bar{x}_{i}$ , the value of organization capital to shareholders (12) is zero and shareholder value consists only of claims to physical capital $K_{i}$ . Shareholders sell their claim on physical capital $K_{i}$ at the market price $V^{K}$ to key talent, which finances this purchase by issuing new shares.  \n\nFrom shareholders’ perspective, firms with more organization capital are exposed to additional risks. Even though the total cash fows from organization and physical capital have the same exposure to systematic risks, the division of surplus between key talent and shareholders depends on the level of frontier technology $x$ . An application of Ito's lemma on the shareholder value of the firm (13) implies that the firm's stock return equals  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}{\\lefteqn{\\frac{d V_{i t}^{S}+D_{i t}d t}{V_{i t}^{S}}-r_{f}d t=E_{t}\\left[\\frac{d V_{i t}^{S}+D_{i t}d t}{V_{i t}^{S}}-r_{f}d t\\right]+\\sigma_{\\theta}d Z_{t}^{\\theta}}}\\ &{}&{\\quad-\\frac{O_{i}e^{x_{t}}\\left[1-e^{(\\bar{x}_{i}-x_{t})\\left(1-\\frac{\\sqrt{2r}}{\\sigma_{x}}\\right)}\\right]}{K_{i}+O_{i}\\left[e^{\\varepsilon_{i}}+\\frac{\\sigma_{x}}{\\sqrt{2\\bar{r}}}e^{\\bar{x}_{i}+\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\bar{r}}}{\\sigma_{x}}(x_{t}-\\bar{x}_{i})}-e^{x_{t}}\\right]}\\sigma_{x}d Z_{t}^{\\varepsilon}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFirms in this economy are exposed to two distinct sources of risk, namely, the productivity shock $\\theta$ and the frontier shock $x$ . The shock $\\theta$ affects the productivity of all capital. Hence, all firms have the same exposure to $\\theta$ ,as we see from the second term in equation (14). By contrast, firms' exposure to the technology shock $x$ is increasing in their ratio of organization to physical capital $O/K$ , which is captured by the last term in equation (14).  \n\nGiven that the shareholder value of organization capital $V^{O S}$ declines with the level of frontier technology $x$ , our model predicts that high- $O/K$ firms drop in value relative to low- $O/K$ firms following a positive shock to $x$ . Thus, the first prediction of our model is that returns to a portfolio that buys high- $\\cdot O/K$ frms and sells low- $O/K$ frms (OMK) will be negatively correlated with the frontier technology shock $x$  \n\nIn equilibrium, asset risk premia are determined by factor loadings times the price of risk. Combining the equation characterizing stock returns (14) with the SDF (4)yields  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}&{}&{E_{t}\\left[\\frac{d V_{i t}^{S}+D_{i t}d t}{V_{i t}^{S}}-r_{f}d t\\right]=-\\mathrm{cov}_{t}\\left[\\frac{d\\pi_{t}}{\\pi_{t}},\\frac{d V_{i t}^{S}}{V_{i t}^{S}}\\right]=\\gamma_{\\theta}\\sigma_{\\theta}-\\gamma_{x}\\sigma_{x}}\\ &{}&{\\qquad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad}\\ &{}&{\\qquad\\times\\frac{O_{i}e^{x_{t}}\\left[1-e^{(\\bar{x}_{i}-x_{t})\\left(1-\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\bar{r}}}{\\sigma_{x}}\\right)}\\right]}{K_{i}+O_{i}\\left[e^{\\varepsilon_{i}}+\\frac{\\sigma_{x}}{\\sqrt{2\\bar{r}}}e^{\\bar{x}_{i}+\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\bar{r}}}{\\sigma_{x}}(x_{t}-\\bar{x}_{i})}-e^{x_{t}}\\right]}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nAll firms have the same exposure to the TFP shock $\\theta$ ,and therefore crosssectional differences in risk premia are driven by heterogeneity in the ratio of organization to physical capital $O/K$ The price of risk of the frontier shock $\\gamma_{x}$ determines whether organization capital commands a higher or lower risk premium than physical capital. In our calibration in Section II.A, we argue that a negative risk premium for the frontier shock $x$ is consistent with economic intuition and the difference in average returns between firms with high- and low-organization capital. In Section III.E, we find that the GMM estimate for the market price of frontier shock risk is negative using three proxies for the frontier shock $x$  \n\nThe model presented thus far captures the main intuition of the paper. Organization capital is exposed to an additional source of risk relative to physical capital, because shareholders do not necessarily appropriate all the benefits accruing from it. In particular, shareholders receive lower payments from organization capital when the outside option of key talent improves. Shareholders demand compensation for this risk because the outside option of key talent varies with the state of the economy. In particular, this outside option depends on the productivity of organization capital deployed in new firms, which in our model is captured by the frontier technology shock $x$ . An increase in the frontier shock $x$ reduces the share of cash flows that shareholders can extract from organization capital. As a result, heterogeneity in firms' asset composition $O_{i}/K_{i}$ leads to differences in risk exposure to the frontier technology $x$ and differences in risk premia.  \n\n### B.Extended Model  \n\nIn this section, we extend the model in Section I.A to allow for endogenous accumulation of physical and organization capital. In addition, we allow the option to upgrade to the new technology to remain active regardless of whether the firm has done so in the past. To ensure that this option is infrequently exercised, we allow for costs to reallocating organization capital. These extensions do not qualitatively affect our inferences derived from the model in Section I.A, but instead generate additional testable predictions that help to validate the model.  \n\nAs before, there exists a continuum of firms that produce a fow of output givenby  \n\n$$\ny_{i,t}=\\theta_{t}e^{u_{i t}}K_{i t}+\\theta_{t}e^{\\varepsilon_{i t}}O_{i t}.\n$$  \n\nThe output of the firm is affected by an aggregate disembodied productivity shock $\\theta$ , whose evolution is given by  \n\n$$\nd\\theta_{t}=\\mu_{\\theta}\\theta_{t}d t+\\sigma_{\\theta}\\theta_{t}d Z_{t}^{\\theta}.\n$$  \n\nThe productivity of a firm's physical and organization capital has firm-specific components $u_{i}$ and $\\varepsilon_{i}$ , respectively. These firm-specific shocks evolve according to  \n\n$$\nd u_{i,t}=-\\kappa_{u}u_{i,t}d t+\\sigma_{u}d Z_{t}^{u_{i}},\n$$  \n\n$$\nd\\varepsilon_{i,t}=-\\kappa_{\\varepsilon}\\varepsilon_{i,t}d t+\\sigma_{\\varepsilon}d Z_{t}^{\\varepsilon_{i}}.\n$$  \n\nThe firm can accumulate physical and organization capital over time through investment  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{d K_{i t}=(i_{K i t}-\\delta_{K})K_{i t}d t,}\\ {{}}\\ {d O_{i t}=(i_{O i t}-\\delta_{O})O_{i t}d t.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nHere, $i_{K}$ and $i_{O}$ represent the firm's investment in physical and organization capital, respectively. Physical capital depreciates at a rate $\\delta_{K}$ as it physically deteriorates or becomes obsolete. Similarly, organization capital depreciates at arate $\\delta o$ either because it becomes obsolete or because key talent retires.  \n\nThe firm can increase its stock of physical capital by an absolute amount $i_{K}K$ bypurchasing $c_{k}/{\\lambda_{k}i_{K}^{\\lambda_{k}}K}$ units of the investment good at a relative price $\\xi_{t}=c_{q}\\theta_{t}$ .4 Therefore, the total output cost of increasing the physical capital stock by an absolute amount $i_{K}K$ equals  \n\n$$\nC_{K}(i_{K},K;\\theta)=\\theta\\frac{c_{k}c_{q}}{\\lambda_{k}}i_{K}^{\\lambda_{k}}K.\n$$  \n\nIn our investment cost formulation (22), the values of the parameters $c_{k}>0$ and $\\lambda_{k}>1$ capture the degree of steepness and convexity of the adjustment cost function. Moreover, the marginal cost of investing in physical capital increases in the TFP shock $\\theta$  \n\nIn addition, the firm can expend resources and increase its stock of organizationcapital $O_{i}$ . The firm can increase its stock of organization capital by an absoluteamount $i_{O}O$ at a total output cost of  \n\n$$\nC_{{\\cal O}}(i_{{\\cal O}},{\\cal O};\\theta)=\\theta\\frac{c_{{\\scriptscriptstyle o}}}{\\lambda_{o}}i_{{\\cal O}}^{\\lambda_{o}}{\\cal O}.\n$$  \n\nJust like physical capital, the creation of new organization capital is subject to convex costs, parameterized by $\\lambda_{o}>1$ and $c_{o}>0$ . In addition, the marginal cost of investment in organization capital increases with the common productivity shock $\\theta$ , which can be interpreted as a congestion cost. For instance, if investment in organization capital requires an input whose supply is independent of $\\theta$ (i.e., worker time), then the marginal cost would be increasing in $\\theta$ just as in the case of investment goods.  \n\nSimilar to the model described in Section I.A, new technologies that improve the frontier efficiency of organization capital emerge over time. In contrast to the model in Section I.A, the option to adopt the new technology can be exercised multiple times. In particular, after the new technology is adopted, the efficiency of organization capital evolves stochastically according to equation (19). Thus, it may be optimal for key talent to adopt a new technology again in the future. To ensure that the equilibrium distribution of firm-specific productivity levels $\\varepsilon_{i}$ is stationary, we assume a mean-reverting formulation for $x$  \n\n$$\nd x_{t}=-\\kappa_{x}x_{t}d t+\\sigma_{x}d Z_{t}^{x}.\n$$  \n\nIn contrast to the basic model in Section I.A, adopting the new level of organization efficiency $x$ is costly. Specifically, upgrading an amount $O$ of organization capital to the frontier level of technology involves a cost equal to:  \n\n$$\nC_{R}(O;\\theta)=c_{R}\\theta O.\n$$  \n\nThis assumption is consistent with the findings of Foster, Haltiwanger, and Krizan (2001), who show that reallocation is accompanied by a costly period of learning. Without loss of generality, we assume that this cost is paid by the key talent. This cost could arise if part of the accumulated knowledge embedded in $O$ becomes obsolete with the new technology, if there are interruptions of the production process due to the necessary retraining of workers and adjustment of the organization structure to the new technology, or if there are setup or financing costs involved in starting a new firm.  \n\nThe solution of the extended model closely follows the solution of the basic model in Section I.A. Hence, we omit the proofs but refer to the reader to the Internet Appendix.5 The shareholder value of the firm is given by the propositionbelow:  \n\nPROPosITIoN 2: The shareholder value of the firm equals  \n\n$$\n{\\cal V}_{i t}^{S}=\\theta_{t}[q(u_{i t})K_{i t}+(v(\\varepsilon_{i t},x_{t})-\\bar{v}(x_{t})){\\cal O}_{i t}].\n$$  \n\nThefunction $q(u)$ is the solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation  \n\n$$\n0=\\operatorname*{max}_{i_{K}}\\left\\{e^{u}-\\frac{c_{k}c_{q}}{\\lambda_{k}}i_{K}^{\\lambda_{K}}-(\\bar{r}+\\delta_{K}-i_{K})q(u)-\\kappa_{u}u q^{\\prime}(u)+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_{u}^{2}q^{\\prime\\prime}(u)\\right\\},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\bar{r}=r_{f}-\\mu_{\\theta}+\\gamma_{\\theta}\\sigma_{\\theta}$ .The function $v(\\varepsilon,x)$ solves the boundary value problem  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{0=\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{max}_{i_{{o}}}\\left\\{e^{\\varepsilon}-\\frac{c_{{o}}}{\\lambda_{o}}i_{{o}}^{\\lambda_{o}}-\\left(\\bar{r}+\\delta_{O}-i_{O}\\right)v(\\varepsilon,x)-\\kappa_{\\varepsilon}\\varepsilon v_{\\varepsilon}(\\varepsilon,x)+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_{\\varepsilon}^{2}v_{\\varepsilon\\varepsilon}(\\varepsilon,x)\\right.}}\\ {{\\mathrm{~}-\\left.\\kappa_{x}\\left(x-\\overline{{x}}\\right)v_{x}(\\varepsilon,x)+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_{x}^{2}v_{x x}(\\varepsilon,x)\\right\\},\\qquadi f\\varepsilon\\geq\\varepsilon^{\\ast}(x),}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere Theoutsideoptionofey talentequalV =0x), wher $\\bar{\\upsilon}(x)\\equiv\\operatorname*{max}[\\upsilon(x,x)-c_{R},0]$ .The reallocation threshold $\\varepsilon^{*}(x)$ is the solution to  \n\n$\\upsilon(\\varepsilon^{*}(x),x)=\\bar{\\upsilon}(x),$ . Investment in physical and organization capital is given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{i_{K}(u)=\\displaystyle\\left(\\frac{q(u)}{c_{k}c_{q}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{k}-1}},}}\\ {{i_{O}(\\varepsilon,x)=\\displaystyle\\left(\\frac{v(\\varepsilon,x)}{c_{o}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{o}-1}}.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nProposition 2 shows that the shareholder value of the firm is equal to the value of physical capital, plus the value of the rents that shareholders can extract from physical capital. This latter component of shareholder value represents a source of risk that shareholders of firms with high-organization capital are exposed to. Hence, the risk premium required by shareholders to invest in firm $i$ equals  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{E_{t}\\left[\\frac{d V_{i t}^{S}+D_{i t}d t}{V_{i t}^{S}}-r_{f}d t\\right]}\\ &{\\quad=\\left(\\gamma_{\\theta}\\sigma_{\\theta}+\\gamma_{x}\\sigma_{x}\\gamma(\\varepsilon_{i t},x_{t})\\frac{(v(\\varepsilon_{i t},x_{t})-\\bar{v}(x_{t}))O_{i t}}{q(u_{i t})K_{i t}+(v(\\varepsilon_{i t},x_{t})-\\bar{v}(x_{t}))O_{i t}}\\right)d t,}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\gamma(\\varepsilon,x)\\equiv\\ensuremath{\\partial}\\log(v(\\varepsilon,x)-\\bar{v}(x))/\\partial x<0$  \n\nEquation (31) is the counterpart to equation (15) in the basic model. As before, cross-sectional differences in risk premia across firms arise only due to firms? differential sensitivity to the frontier shock $x$ , which is captured by the last term in equation (31). This heterogeneity in firms' exposure to the frontier shock arises due to differences in their asset composition $O/K$ and the firmspecific productivity $u$ and $\\varepsilon$ . The price of risk of the frontier technology shock $\\gamma_{x}$ determines the sign and magnitude of the difference in risk premia between organization and physical capital.  \n\nIn contrast to the basic model, the accumulation of physical and organization capital is an endogenous decision on the part of the firm. In particular, the accumulation of physical and organization capital depends on the firm-specific shocks $u_{i}$ and $\\varepsilon_{i}$ , as we see from equations (29) and (30). In addition, equation (30) shows that investment in organization capital is increasing in the level of frontier technology $x$  \n\nAs before, the presence of constant returns to scale in production implies that firm boundaries are not defined in our model. To resolve this indeterminacy, we assume that, once key talent decides to move to a new firm, existing shareholders sell their claim on physical capital, along with its current level of productivity $u_{i}$ , to key talent at its market value. The shareholders are indifferent to doing so, since at that point they earn zero rents from organization capital. Key talent finances this purchase of physical capital by issuing new shares. Our assumption implies that the number of firms is constant, as new firms replace existing firms that lose key talent.  \n\nProposition 2 shows that it is optimal to reallocate organization capital to a new firm if the value of the outside option is high enough, $\\varepsilon_{i t}\\leq\\varepsilon^{*}(x_{t})$ . This reallocation threshold $\\varepsilon^{*}(x)$ is an increasing function of the frontier shock $x$ ， since reallocation becomes more attractive when the frontier efficiency level is high. Thus, the amount of technology adoption, regardless of whether it takes the form of reallocation to a new firm or restructuring of the existing firm, is an increasing function of $x$ . Hence, our model implies that the aggregate amount of reallocation or restructuring should be negatively correlated with a portfolio long high- $O/K$ firms and short low- $O/K$ firms. We explore this prediction in Section IHI.D.  \n\nThe final step in characterizing the solution to the model is to compute the dynamics of compensation to key talent. Just as in the basic model, we assume that shareholders have limited commitment, hence key talent can extract a value equal at most to its outside option ${\\overline{{V}}}^{O}$ from existing shareholders. For the organization capital to remain with the firm, the continuation value of key talent $W_{i t}$ has to equal its outside option in all states of the world:  \n\n$$\nW_{i t}=\\theta_{t}O_{i t}\\bar{v}(x_{t}).\n$$  \n\nShareholders can implement this continuation value by promising key talent a flow payment of $w_{i t}d t$ as long as organization capital remains in the firm. Hence, the continuation value of key talent equals the present value of compensation while organization capital remains in the existing firm plus the option value of moving to a new firm:  \n\n$$\nW_{i t}=E_{t}\\int_{t}^{\\tau}\\frac{\\pi_{s}}{\\pi_{t}}w_{i s}d s+E_{t}\\left[\\frac{\\pi_{\\tau}}{\\pi_{t}}\\theta_{\\tau}O_{i\\tau}\\bar{v}(x_{\\tau})\\right].\n$$  \n\nGiven equations (32) and (33), we explicitly solve for the dynamics of compensation to key talent $w_{i t}$ . The requirement that the key talent's continuation value equals their outside option in every state of the world pins down $W_{i t}$ and $W_{i t+d t}$ . Shareholders will then compensate key talent in such a way as to ensure that promises are kept, that is, $\\begin{array}{r}{W_{i t}=w_{i t}d t+E_{t}[\\frac{\\pi_{t+d t}}{\\pi_{t}}W_{i t+d t}]}\\end{array}$ always holds.The following corollary describes the compensation dynamics to key talent:  \n\nCOROLLARY 1: Key talent in firm $i$ receives $a$ flow payment $w_{i t}$ dt every period:  \n\n$$\nw_{i t}=\\left(\\bar{r}+\\delta_{O}-i_{O}(\\varepsilon_{i t},x_{t})+\\kappa_{x}(x_{t}-\\bar{x})\\frac{\\overline{{v}}_{x}(x_{t})}{\\overline{{v}}(x_{t})}-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_{x}^{2}\\frac{\\bar{v}_{x x}(x_{t})}{\\overline{{v}}(x_{t})}\\right)\\theta_{t}O_{i t}\\bar{v}(x_{t}),\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\overline{{v}}(x)$ is defined in Proposition $(2)$  \n\nCorollary 1 shows that the compensation to key talent is increasing proportionally to the value of its outside option $\\bar{\\upsilon}(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t})$ . Hence, an increase in the frontier technology shock $x$ leads to an increase in the compensation of key talent. The term $\\bar{r}+\\delta\\boldsymbol{o}$ inside parentheses compensates key talent for the cost of waiting, exposure to the technology shock $\\theta$ , and the fact that organization capital depreciates over time. The second term inside parentheses is negative and decreasing in the level of investment in organization capital. Key talent is willing to accept lower compensation today in return for the firm increasing its investment in organization capital, since doing so raises key talent's outside option. Hence, the cost of investment in organization capital is implicitly shared between shareholders and key talent. The third term inside parentheses is increasing in $x$ because the frontier shock $x$ is mean reverting. The temporary increase in the outside option implies that key talent receives an accelerated payment today, and hence the compensation to key talent increases faster than its outside option. The last term inside parentheses in equation (34) illustrates that key talent is willing to accept a lower fow payment today as the volatility of the frontier shock $x$ increases, due to the convexity of the outside option $\\bar{v}(x)$  \n\nThree additional predictions follow directly from Corollary 1. First, the compensation to key talent (34) is increasing in the level of organization capital $O_{i}$ . Hence, we expect that firms with more organization capital should have higher levels of executive compensation. Second, the average level of executive compensation $\\bar{w}_{t}=\\int w_{i t}d\\dot{\\iota}$ is increasing in the frontier level of efficiency $x$ .As a result, the aggregate level of executive compensation should be negatively correlated with returns to a portfolio long high- $O/K$ firms and short low- $\\cdot O/K$ firms. Third, the sensitivity of firm profits to firm output increases with the ratio of organization to physical capital. To see this last prediction, note that compensation to key talent (34) does not increase with the firm-specific shocks $u_{i}$ and $\\varepsilon_{i}$ . Therefore, firm earnings (defined as $y_{i}-w_{i},$ will increase by a proportionally greater amount than firm output $y_{i}$ following a positive shock to either $u_{i}$ or $\\varepsilon_{i}$ . This increased sensitivity depends on the ratio $w_{i}/y_{i}$ , which itself is increasing in $O/K$ . By contrast, compensation to key talent $w_{i t}$ increases proportionally with $\\theta$ , implying that the elasticity of firm profits with respect to aggregate output is independent of the level of organization to physical capital. We explore these predictions in Section III.D  \n\n## I1. Measuring Organization Capital  \n\n### A. Methodology  \n\nOur model suggests that we use a measure that captures investment in capital that is intangible, specific, and closely tied to labor inputs. We construct a direct measure of organization capital using SG&A expenditures. The U.S. GAAP definition of SG&A expenses states that this item represents all commercial expenses of operation (i.e., expenses not directly related to product production) incurred in the regular course of business pertaining to the securing of operating income. A large part of SG&A consists of expenses related to labor and IT (white collar wages, training, consulting, and IT expenses), consistent with the idea that any accrued value will be somewhat firm specific and must be shared with key talent.  \n\nOur measure is motivated by Lev and Radhakrishnan (2005), who use SG&A to measure fows to organization capital. SG&A contains the part of labor expenses that cannot be directly attributed to a particular unit of output. Hence, any spending on the part of the firm to increase its organization capital will be included in SG&A expenses. Lev and Radhakrishnan (2005) and Lev (2001) present detailed arguments and examples of how resources allocated to this expense item yield improvements in employee incentives, internal communication systems, distribution systems, and other examples of organization capital. Our methodology is also consistent with advice from popular textbooks on value investing, which advocate capitalizing SG&A expenses to detect offbalance-sheet sources of firm value Greenwald et al. (2004).  \n\nWe construct the stock of organization capital $O$ using the perpetual inventory method.7 Specifically, we recursively construct the stock of organization capital by cumulating the deflated value of SG&A expenses,  \n\n$$\nO_{i t}=({\\bf1}-\\delta_{O})O_{i t-1}+\\frac{S G A_{i,t}}{c p i_{t}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $c p i_{t}$ denotes the consumer price index. To implement the law of motion in equation (35) we must choose an initial stock and a depreciation rate. We choose the initial stock according to  \n\n$$\n{\\cal O}_{0}={\\frac{S G A_{1}}{g+\\delta_{\\cal O}}}.\n$$  \n\nFor most of our analysis, we use a depreciation rate of $15\\%$ , which is equal to the depreciation rate used by the BEA in its estimation of R&D capital in 2006. We ch00se $_g$ to match the average real growth rate of firm-level SG&A expenditures, which in our sample equals $10\\%$ . Finally, we treat missing values in the SG&A as zero. Our results are robust to a choice of depreciation rate $\\delta_{O}$ between $10\\%$ and $50\\%$ , and to dropping the first 5 years of data for every firm, which minimizes the impact of the initialization scheme $O_{0}$ (see the Internet Appendix for more details). We scale organization capital $O$ by the firm's book assets $K$  \n\nTo the extent that some SG&A expenditures do not constitute investment in organization capital, we measure this capital with error. If the fraction of SG&A expenses that represents investment in organization capital does not vary across firms, this error will not affect firms’ ranking in terms of $O/K$ However, accounting practices governing the exact composition of SG&A expenditures vary across industries, and hence this error may have an industry component. To address this concern, in our empirical work we rank frms on their ratio of organization capital to assets $O/K$ relative to their industry peers. Specifically, we first group firms into 17 industries based on the Fama and French (1997) classification. Then, within each industry, we assign firms a rank (1 to 5) based on the firm's quintile of the ratio of organization capital to book assets. Finally, we form five value-weighted portfolios based on each firm's within-industry organization capital rank, and rebalance these portfolios in June every year. Therefore, portfolio 1 (5) contains firms in the lowest (highest) $O/K$ quintile in each industry. This procedure ensures that our results are driven by within—-rather than between—industry variation in the contribution of organization capital to firm value.  \n\nOur sample includes all nonfinancial firms in Compustat with fiscal year ending in December with common shares that are traded on NYSE, AMEX, or NASDAQ, that have nonmissing SIC codes and nonzero values of organization capital. Our sample includes a total of 5,917 firms, which collectively represent about $60\\%$ of the total market capitalization of firms in CRSP. Our sample period is 1970 to 2008.  \n\n### B. Validation  \n\nOur measure of organization capital is constructed using the firm's SG&A expenditures, which can include other items that are unrelated to improving the organizational efficiency of the firm. In this section, we consider several ways of validating our measure.  \n\n#### B.1. Euidence from 10-K Filings  \n\nOur model implies that shareholders investing in firms with high organization capital are exposed to the risk of key talent leaving the firm. Firms are obliged to disclose potential risk factors that might adversely affect future performance in the managerial discussion section of their 10-K filings. We explore whether firms with more organization capital are more likely to list loss of key personnel as a risk factor. We focus on a random sample of 1oo firms, constructed by randomly selecting five firms every year from the top and bottom quintile of firms in terms of organization capital to assets (relative to their industry peers). We restrict attention to the years for which the SEC filings are electronically available (1996 to 2005).  \n\nWe find that firms with more organization capital are more likely to list as a risk factor that they are dependent upon a number of key personnel, the loss of which might adversely affect future performance. Out of the 50 firms in the high organization capital to assets quintile, $48\\%$ list the loss of key personnel as a risk factor. In contrast, only $20\\%$ of the 50 firms in the bottom organization capital to assets quintile list the loss of key personnel as a risk factor for future performance. Assuming independent observations, a difference in means test rejects the null that the two fractions are equal with a $t$ -statisticof 3.06.  \n\n#### B.2. Euidence from Managerial Quality Surveys  \n\nBloom and Van Reenen (2007) develop an interview-based survey tool designed to quantify management practices across firms.8 Firms are scored on a scale of 1 to 5 based on their responses to a managerial survey relative to a benchmark of global best practices. The survey defines and assigns scores from 1 (worst practice) to 5 (best practice) to 18 management practices used by industrial firms. These practices are grouped into four areas: operations (three practices), monitoring (five practices), targets (five practices), and incentives (five practices). Bloom and Van Reenen (2007) find that the average management practice score is strongly correlated with firm performance and Tobin's $\\boldsymbol{Q}.$ . Other research using the same data shows that better management practices are associated with greater productivity of IT (see, e.g. Bloom, Sadun, and Reenen (2012)) and more efficient production (see Bloom, Sadun, and Van Reenen (2010) for a survey).  \n\nOur measure of organization capital is correlated with the managerial quality score constructed by Bloom and Van Reenen (2007). The 2004 survey data contain a cross-section of 250 U.S. firms that overlap with our sample.9 Focusing on the period 2000 to 2005, we estimate a regression of the organization capital measure on the managerial score measure,  \n\n$$\n\\frac{O_{i t}}{A_{i t}}=a+b M_{i}+u_{i t},\n$$  \n\nand cluster the standard errors by firm. The estimated coefficient $^{b}$ is positive, and equal to 0.13, while the $t$ -statistic is equal to 1.94. Thus, the evidence suggests that our measure of organization capital, which is constructed using accounting data, is informative about the quality of management practices acrossfirms.  \n\n#### B.3. Euidence from Investment in Information Technology  \n\nBresnahan, Brynjolfsson, and Hitt (2002) and Bloom, Sadun, and Reenen (2012) find evidence suggesting the presence of strong complementarities between organization capital and IT. We explore whether firms with more organization capital according to our measure also have greater demand for IT. We obtain information on the IT spending budget for a sample of 500 firms from Information Week for the years 1995 and 1996. The firms participating in the Information Week survey are selected based on the amount of IT spending and a subjective assessment of their IT activities.  \n\nWe find that firms with more organization capital to assets relative to their industry peers have a greater demand for IT. As we see in Table III below, firms in the high- $O/K$ portfolio spend almost twice as much on IT relative to book assets than low- $O/K$ firms $(2.10\\%$ Vs. $1.17\\%$ 0. Hence, the evidence supports the view that our measure of organization capital is correlated with firms' demand for IT.  \n\n## B.4. Euidence from Firm Proftability  \n\nOrganization capital is a factor of production that is usually omitted from productivity calculations. Hence, we expect that firms with high organization capital have higher productivity, accounting for physical capital and labor. We focus on two measures of productivity. The first measure is the ratio of sales to book assets. The second measure of productivity is the regression residual of log sales on log capital and labor, where the intercept and slopes are allowed to vary by industry-year (see the Appendix for details).  \n\nWe find that firms with higher ratios of organization capital to assets are more productive using both measures. This evidence is supportive of the view that our measure of organization capital is a factor of production that enhances output, holding other inputs constant. Our evidence is consistent with the findings of De and Dutta (2007) and Tronconi and Vittucci Marzetti (2011). Both papers construct a similar measure of organization capital by capitalizing SG&A expenditures and report similar results for a sample of Indian IT firms and a large sample of European firms, respectively.  \n\n### III. Model Predictions  \n\nHere, we explore the predictions of our model in the data. In addition, we explore whether our model can quantitatively replicate the main features of the data by replicating our estimation results on simulated data from the model.  \n\n#### A. Calibration  \n\nTable $\\mathrm{I}$ shows the parameters used in our calibration. We select parameters to match key moments of the data, and document the properties of the solution. In Table II we compare the moments in the data that we target with their model-implied counterparts. We report the median moment, along with the $5\\%$ and $95\\%$ percentiles across simulations. We simulate the model at a monthly frequency and aggregate the data to form annual observations. Each simulation contains 1,500 firms and has a length of 80 years. We drop the first half of each simulation sample to avoid dependence on initial values, and repeat the process 5,000 times.  \n\n#### A.1.Parametersof theFirmEconomicEnvironment  \n\nWe set the depreciation rate of physical capital to $\\delta_{K}=6\\%$ ,consistentwith values commonly used in the macroeconomic literature. We set the depreciation  \n\n# Table I Parameters  \n\nhis table presents the parameters used in the calibration of our model rate of organization capital to $\\delta o=15\\%$ to be consistent with our empirical implementation. These values are also consistent with empirical estimates of the depreciation rate of physical and intangible capital (Pakes and Schankerman (1979), Nadiri and Prucha (1996). We choose values for the parameter governing the cost of investment goods $c_{q}=0.13$ and the parameter $\\lambda_{K}=1.8$ governing the convexity of adjustment costs to physical capital to match the level and cross-sectional dispersion of Tobin's $Q$ . Moreover, we choose the parameters governing the cost of investing in physical and organization capital, $c_{k}=435$ and $c_{o}=625$ , respectively, to match the level of investment in physical and organization capital. In terms of magnitudes, the average ratio of adjustment costs in organization (physical) capital to output is equal to $1.2\\%$ $(0.8\\%)$  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Parameter Symbol</td></tr><tr><td>Value</td></tr><tr><td>Technology</td></tr><tr><td>Growth rate of TFP-shock 0.00 VolatilityofTFP-shock 0.11</td></tr><tr><td>θ0 Mean-reversionparameter offrontier shock Kx 0.10</td></tr><tr><td>Volatilityoffrontiershock 0.20</td></tr><tr><td>Ox Mean-reversionparameter offirm O-specific shock 0.35</td></tr><tr><td>Ke 0.45</td></tr><tr><td>Volatility of firm O-specific shock OE 0.12</td></tr><tr><td>Mean-reversion parameter of firm K-specific shock Ku 0.25</td></tr><tr><td>Volatility of firm K-specific shock Ou</td></tr><tr><td>InvestmentandReallocation</td></tr><tr><td>ConvexityofadjustmentcostsforinvestmentinO-capital 3.20 Proportional adjustment cost for investment in O-capital 625</td></tr><tr><td>co Depreciation rate of O-capital 80 0.15</td></tr><tr><td>Proportional reallocation cost of O-capital 1.75</td></tr><tr><td>CR Convexity of adjustment costs for investment in K-capital 入K 1.80</td></tr><tr><td>Proportional adjustment cost for investment in K-capital 435</td></tr><tr><td>Ck Cost ofinvestment goods 0.13</td></tr><tr><td>Cq 0.06</td></tr><tr><td>Depreciation rate of K-capital 8K</td></tr><tr><td>StochasticDiscountFactor</td></tr><tr><td>Risk-free rate r 0.04</td></tr><tr><td>Price of risk of TFP-shock Yθ 0.40</td></tr><tr><td>Price of risk of reallocation shock Vx -0.53</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nWe set values $\\mu_{\\theta}=0.25\\%$ for the mean growth rate and $\\sigma_{\\theta}=0.11$ for the volatility of the common technology shock to match the mean growth rate and the volatility of dividends, as well as the volatility of the returns to the market portfolio.

We compare the moments in the data versus moments of simulated data. We report median values across simulations, along with the $5\\%$ and $95\\%$ percentiles. Moments of dividend growth are from the long sample in Campbell and Cochrane (1999). The rate of capital reallocation is from Eisfeldt and Rampini (2006), defined as the sum of sales of PPE plus the sum of mergers and acquisitions to the sum of PPE. The remaining moments are computed using Compustat data over the 1970 to 2008 period (see the Appendix for variable definitions). The firm-specific moments are time-series averages of the median and interquintile range (IQR).  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td></td><td colspan=\"3\">Model</td></tr><tr><td>Moment</td><td>Data</td><td>Median</td><td>5%</td><td>95%</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\">AggregateMoments</td></tr><tr><td>Mean of dividend growth</td><td>0.025</td><td>0.028</td><td>-0.012</td><td>0.056</td></tr><tr><td>Volatility of dividend growth</td><td>0.118</td><td>0.116</td><td>0.084</td><td>0.278</td></tr><tr><td>Mean of investment rate in O-capital</td><td>0.211</td><td>0.199</td><td>0.189</td><td>0.217</td></tr><tr><td>Volatility of investment rate in O-capital</td><td>0.015</td><td>0.009</td><td>0.004</td><td>0.020</td></tr><tr><td>Autocorrelation of investment rate in O-capital</td><td>0.817</td><td>0.861</td><td>0.693</td><td>0.943</td></tr><tr><td>Mean of capital reallocationrate</td><td>0.042</td><td>0.051</td><td>0.001</td><td>0.277</td></tr><tr><td>Volatility of capital reallocation rate</td><td>0.026</td><td>0.088</td><td>0.003</td><td>0.283</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\">AssetReturns</td></tr><tr><td>Mean excess return of market portfolio</td><td>0.064</td><td>0.049</td><td>0.012</td><td>0.083</td></tr><tr><td>Volatility of marketportfolio return</td><td>0.171</td><td>0.128</td><td>0.105</td><td>0.159</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\">FirmMoments</td></tr><tr><td>Tobin's Q (median)</td><td>1.101</td><td>1.107</td><td>1.018</td><td>1.321</td></tr><tr><td>Tobin's Q (IQR)</td><td>0.848</td><td>0.614</td><td>0.452</td><td>0.835</td></tr><tr><td>Organization-to-physical capital (median)</td><td>1.079</td><td>0.678</td><td>0.394</td><td>1.678</td></tr><tr><td>Organization-to-physical capital (IQR)</td><td>1.320</td><td>0.770</td><td>0.444</td><td>1.910</td></tr><tr><td>Investment rate in O-capital (median)</td><td>0.222</td><td>0.172</td><td>0.158</td><td>0.197</td></tr><tr><td>Investment rate in K-capital (median)</td><td>0.111</td><td>0.099</td><td>0.097</td><td>0.108</td></tr><tr><td>Cash flows-to-capital (IQR)</td><td>0.234</td><td>0.145</td><td>0.119</td><td>0.242</td></tr><tr><td>Firm size (log) (IQR)</td><td>2.207</td><td>1.377</td><td>1.236</td><td>1.487</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\norganization capital. We calibrate these parameters to match the dynamics of capital reallocation and investment in organization capital in the model $\\overset{\\prime}{c}_{R}=1.75$ $\\lambda_{o}=3.2$ $\\kappa_{x}=0.10$ $\\sigma_{x}=14\\%$ 0. These choices ensure that our model approximately matches the volatility and serial correlation of the average rate of investment in organization capital, and the mean and volatility of the average rate of capital reallocation from Eisfeldt and Rampini (2006).  \n\n#### A.2. Parameters of the Stochastic Discount Factor  \n\nWe set the risk-free rate to equal $r=4\\%$ ,which is slightly higher than the historical average $(3\\%)$ , but ensures that the value function does not explode at the edges of our computational grid. We choose the price of risk of the TFP $\\gamma_{\\theta}=0.4$ to match the average excess return of the market portfolio. The effect of organization capital on risk premia depends on the price of risk of the frontier technology shock $\\gamma_{x}$ . In the data, firms with more organization capital to assets $(O/K)$ have higher average returns than low. $O/K$ firms, suggesting a negative risk price for $\\gamma_{x}$ . Hence, we choose a risk price $\\gamma_{x}=-0.53$ to match the difference in average returns between high- and low- $O/K$ firms.  \n\nOur choice for the price of risk $\\gamma_{x}$ implies that the frontier technology shock $x$ leads to high marginal utility states. This assumption is consistent with general equilibrium under certain assumptions on preferences. In our model, high realizations of $x$ imply that reallocation becomes more attractive (the threshold $\\varepsilon^{*}(x)$ increases). In addition, upgrading to the new technology involves an immediate loss in resources given by (25), but no immediate increase in output. Thus, in the short run, resources available for consumption are lower. In the long run, consumption increases as more firms operate at a higher level of efficiency. Whether marginal utility is positively or negatively correlated with $x$ depends on the relative magnitudes of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution and risk aversion.10  \n\n#### A.3.NumericalSolutionandSimulation  \n\nFigure 1 illustrates several features of the numerical solution of the model. Panel A plots the market value of physical capital $q(u_{i})$ , and Panel B plots the total value of organization capital $v(\\varepsilon_{i},x)$ . Both values are increasing in the firm-specific levels of productivity of physical capital $u$ and organization capital $\\varepsilon$ , respectively. In addition, the total value of organization capital increases with the level of frontier efficiency, as the option to upgrade becomes more valuable.  \n\nPanel C graphs the outside option of key talent $\\bar{v}(x)$ . This value increases in the level of the frontier technology shock $x$ , since the latter determines the efficiency of organization capital in new firms. Panel D graphs the shareholder share of the value of organization capital $\\upsilon(\\varepsilon_{i},x)-\\bar{\\upsilon}(x)$ . Importantly, the shareholder value of organization capital is decreasing in the level of the frontier technology shock $x$ . This decrease in value represents the differential source of risk that investors in firms with high levels of organization capital are exposed to.  \n\nPanel $\\mathbf{E}$ plots the restructuring threshold $\\varepsilon^{*}(x)$ , which is increasing in $x$ ， because the latter improves the gains from reallocation. Panel $\\mathbf{F}$ plots the invariant joint distribution of $\\varepsilon_{i}$ and $x$ , illustrating the process of creative destruction in our model. Firms with low levels of firm-specific efficiency $\\varepsilon_{i}<$ $\\varepsilon^{*}(x)$ are replaced by firms with the frontier level of technology $x$ . Hence, in equilibrium, the mean level of productivity $\\varepsilon_{i}$ among active firms is increasing in the level of the frontier technology shock.  \n\n![](images/b38356d1891058d0a524bfbff1af9de0c844a9b456c968d5eb6832837f9f4c3a.jpg)  \n  \n  \nFigure 1.

We report the time-series average of the median portfolio characteristic. In the data, we sort firms in five portfolios based on the ratio of organization capital to book assets (Compustat item at), using industry-specific breakpoints. We use the 17 industry classification of Fama and French (1997), and rebalance portfolios every June. In simulated data, we sort firms into five portfolios based on the ratio of organization $O_{i t}$ tophysical capital $K_{i t}$ , and rebalance every year. We report median values across simulations, along with the $5\\%$ and $95\\%$ percentiles. See the Appendix for variable definitions.

Organization Capital and Firm Characteristics  \n\nIn Table III, we document how firm differences in their ratio of organization to physical capital $O/K$ are related to firm characteristics, both in the data (Panel A) and in the model (Panel B). We report the time-series average of the median firm characteristic in each $O/K$ portfolio.  \n\nHigh- $O/K$ firms have somewhat higher Tobin's $Q$ than low- $O/K$ frms (1.25 vs. 1.05). Despite this increasing pattern in Tobin's $Q$ ,high- $O/K$ firms have lower investment rates in physical capital ( $10.1\\%$ vs. $12.6\\%$ 0. In addition, firms with higher ratios of organization capital to physical capital tend to have smaller market capitalization and have higher productivity. In addition, we find that high- $O/K$ firms have a higher ratio of total executive compensation to assets ( $1.29\\%$ to $0.57\\%$ ). As we see in Panel B, the model performs well in quantitatively replicating these patterns. The fraction of shareholder value that is due to organization capital ranges from $37\\%$ for the firms in the high- $\\cdot O/K$ portfolio to $4\\%$ for the firms in the low- $O/K$ portfolio.  \n\nFurthermore, we document a number of other firm characteristics that are outside the model. High- $O/K$ firms are more labor intensive, and also have higher labor expenses per worker. This last fact suggests that high- $O/K$ firms employ more skilled workers, consistent with the findings of Caroli and Van Reenen (2001) and Bresnahan, Brynjolfsson, and Hitt (2002). In addition, high$O/K$ firms have higher rates of investment in other forms of intangible capital, such as advertising or R&D. Finally, firms with more organization capital also have lower financial leverage.  \n\n### C. Asset Prices  \n\nIn this section, we explore the main prediction of our paper, namely that cross-sectional differences in the ratio of organization to physical capital are associated with differences in risk premia. Table IV compares the empirical results in the data (Panel A) and in the model (Panel B).  \n\nThe left panel (A) shows the results in the data. Firms with a higher ratio of organization capital to book assets have $4.7\\%$ higher average returns per year than firms with low organization capital to assets. This difference in average returns is not explained by the CAPM. The CAPM alpha of the long-short portfolio is $5.6\\%$ , and statistically significant. As we see in the right panel (B) of Table IV, our model quantitatively replicates the dispersion in risk premia across $O/K$ portfolios, including the failure of the CAPM.  \n\nThe dispersion in returns across $O/K$ portfolios is distinct from the size, value, and momentum effects. Computing alphas using the Fama and French (1993) or Carhart (1997) empirical factor models leads to similar results, as we see in Table IV. The high- $O/K$ minus low- $O/K$ portfolio has an alpha of $5.9\\%$ and $4.2\\%$ when we use the Fama and French (1993) and Carhart (1997) models, respectively (Table V).  \n\nOur model implies that this difference in average returns arises because high-and low- $O/K$ firms have differential sensitivities to the frontier organizational efficiency shock $x$ . Consistent with this view, there is substantial comovement among these portfolios, and this comovement can account for these differences in risk premia. Specifically, the two-factor model that includes the market portfolio and the OMK portfolio produces alphas that are not statistically different from zero. In addition, the betas with respect to the OMK portfolio are monotonically increasing from $-0.37$ to 0.63. This comovement among firms suggests that high- and low- $O/K$ firms are exposed to different sources of risk, and this differential risk factor exposure is sufficient to explain the differences in their average returns. Furthermore, sorting firms into  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"9\">Panel B: Model 3 2 5-1 5 Panel A: Data 4 3</td><td rowspan=\"9\">5-1 5 4 1.

In this section, we explore these predictions directly.  \n\n#### D.1. Executive Compensation  \n\nIn our model, the level of aggregate executive compensation is increasing in the frontier technology shock, as we see in equation (34). To test this prediction directly, we obtain data from Frydman and Saks (2010) on the aggregate time series of executive compensation. We focus on two measures of aggregate compensation, namely the mean and median level of compensation of the top three  \n\n# TableVII OMK Portfolio Returns and Executive Compensation  \n\nThis table reports the relation between aggregate executive compensation $\\bar{w}$ and thereturns ofthe OMK portfolio, in the data (Panel A) and in the model (Panel B). The OMK portfolio is defined as the portfolio long firms with high organization capital and short (minus) firms with low organization capital to assets. See Section II, notes to Table III, and the Appendix for more details. Data on executive compensation are from Frydman and Saks (2010) and cover the 1970 to 2008 period. Standard errors are computed using the Newey-West estimator allowing for three lags of serial correlation. The last column presents the results of an $F.$ test of whether the sum of the coefficients on the contemporaneous and lagged $-R_{t}^{O M K}$ are jointly equal to zero.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Compensation to key talent(△wt)</td><td>ROMK</td><td>-ROMK Rt-1</td><td></td><td></td><td>△wt-1</td><td>R2</td><td>p(F) OMK=0</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"8\">Panel A:Data</td></tr><tr><td>Compensation oftop three officers,average</td><td>-0.172 (-0.67)</td><td>1.107 (4.29)</td><td>0.189</td><td></td><td>0.036 (0.27)</td><td>0.353</td><td>0.008</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-0.329 (-1.29)</td><td>1.017 (3.98)</td><td>(1.53)</td><td>0.191 (1.55)</td><td>0.002 (0.02) 0.221</td><td>0.428</td><td>0.049</td></tr><tr><td>Compensation oftop three officers, median</td><td>0.168 (1.11)</td><td>0.418 (2.82)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(1.63)</td><td>0.263</td><td>0.004</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.182</td><td>0.316</td><td>-0.036 (-0.50)</td><td>0.138 (1.95)</td><td>0.230 (1.78)</td><td>0.341</td><td>0.014</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"8\">(1.18) (2.12)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Panel B: Model</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"8\">Compensation to key talent,</td></tr><tr><td>average</td><td>1.013 (2.95)</td><td>0.986</td><td></td><td></td><td>-0.067 (-0.36)</td><td>0.403</td><td>0.016</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(2.38)</td><td>0.178</td><td>0.261</td><td>-0.143</td><td>0.484</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1.113 (3.35)</td><td>1.231 (2.75)</td><td>(0.37)</td><td>(0.48)</td><td>(-0.76)</td><td></td><td>0.002</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nexecutives. Given these two measures of log aggregate executive compensation $\\bar{\\boldsymbol{w}}_{t}$ ,weestimate  \n\n$$\n\\Delta\\bar{w}_{t}=a_{0}-b_{0}R_{t}^{O M K}-b_{1}R_{t-1}^{O M K}+c_{0}R_{t}^{M K T}+c_{1}R_{t-1}^{M K T}+\\rho\\Delta\\bar{w}_{t-1}+e_{t}.\n$$  \n\nWe estimate the above equation via OLS and report the estimated coefficients, along with Newey-West standard errors, in Panel A of Table IV. We report results with and without controlling for returns to the market portfolio (TableVII).  \n\nWe find that, consistent with our model, the estimated coefficients $\\hat{b}_{1}$ are positive and statistically significant across the measures of aggregate compensation and specifications. In contrast, the estimated coefficients ${\\bar{b}}_{0}$ and $\\hat{c}_{0}$ are not statistically different from zero. One possible explanation for this pattern is that compensation is a fow variable that is observed at the end of the year but may be decided at the beginning of the year. Hence, compensation is correlated with lagged rather than contemporaneous returns to the OMK and market portfolio. The sum of the two coefficients $\\hat{b}_{0}$ and $\\hat{b}_{1}$ is always positive, and statistically different from zero, as we see from the result of an $F$ -test in the last column. We obtain similar results if we control for output growth instead of market returns, or if we focus on CEO compensation only. Panel B illustrates that the corresponding estimates on simulated data from the model are comparable to the results obtained in the data. In the model, a $1\\%$ increase in the returns to the OMK portfolio is associated with a $1\\%$ decreasein executive compensation in the model, compared to a $0.3\\%$ to $1.1\\%$ increase in the data.  \n\n#### D.2. Reallocation  \n\nNext, we explore how measures of reallocation or restructuring of existing firms are correlated with the realized returns to the OMK portfolio:  \n\n$$\nX_{t}=a_{0}-b_{0}R_{t}^{O M K}-b_{1}R_{t-1}^{O M K}+c_{0}R_{t}^{M K T}+c_{1}R_{t-1}^{M K T}+\\rho\\hat{X}_{t-1}+e_{t}.\n$$  \n\nOne difficulty is that our model is silent as to the exact form ofthis reallocation. For example, organization and physical capital may be reallocated to a new firm that starts at the frontier level of efficiency. Alternatively, key talent can buy the old firm from existing shareholders and restructure its organization to upgrade to the frontier level $x$ . Therefore, we examine a variety of measures of physical and human capital reallocation: data on capital reallocation from Eisfeldt and Rampini (2006); data on CEO turnover from Execucomp; data on new public offerings from Ibbotson, Sindelar, and Ritter (1994); and data on new management buyouts from Haddad, Loualiche, and Plosser (2011). Since these last two measures are count variables, we estimate equation (39) using a Poisson count regression. We report the estimated coefficients in Table IV, Panel A. We report results with and without controlling for returns to the market portfolio (Table VIII).  \n\nWe find that all measures of reallocation are negatively correlated with the realized returns of the OMK portfolio. In the case of capital and CEO reallocation, the estimated coefficients $\\hat{b}_{0}$ are not statistically different from zero. However, the sum of the two coefficients $\\hat{b}_{0}$ and $\\hat{b}_{1}$ is always positive, and statistically different from zero, as we see from the result of an $F$ -test in the last column. With the exception of the number of new IPOs, our findings are robust to controlling for returns to the market portfolio. We obtain similar results if we control for output growth instead of market returns. Panel B illustrates that the empirical results are qualitatively consistent with the model, since both the frequency of new firm creation, as well as the rate of capital reallocation are negatively correlated with returns of the OMK portfolio.  \n\n#### D.3. Investment in Organization Capital  \n\nIn our model, the optimal level of investment in organization capital is increasing in the level of the frontier level of technology $x$ ,as we see in equation (30). We test this prediction by estimating  \n\n$$\ni o_{i t}=a_{0}+a_{1}\\hat{x}_{t-1}+a_{2}Q_{i t-1}+a_{3}\\Delta y_{i t-1}+a_{4}R O E_{i t-1}+\\gamma_{i}+e_{i t}.\n$$  \n\n# TableVIlI OMK Portfolio Returns and Reallocation  \n\nThis table reports the relation between measures of capital reallocation and the returns of the OMK portfolio, in the data (Panel A) and in the model (Panel B). See Section IHI, notes to Tables III and VII, and the Appendix for more details. Data on capital reallocation rate are from Eisfeldt and Rampini (2006) and cover the 1970 to 2008 period; data for CEO turnover are from Execucomp and cover the 1992 to 2008 period; data on initial public offerings are from Ibbotson, Sindelar, and Ritter (1994) and cover the 1975 to 2008 period; data on management buyouts are from Haddad, Loualiche, and Plosser (2011) and cover the 1982 to 2008 period. In Panel A, the first three sets of rows report results using OLS, where the standard errors are computed using the NeweyWest estimator allowing for three lags of serial correlation. The last two sets of rows in Panel A report results using a Poisson count regression, with robust standard errors. The last column presents theresults of an $F.$ -test of whether the sum of the coefficients on the contemporaneous and laged $-R_{t}^{O M K}$ are jointly equal to zero.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Reallocation X</td><td>MK</td><td>ROMK t-1</td><td></td><td>RMKT</td><td>Xt-1</td><td>R2</td><td>p(F) OMK=0</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"8\">Panel A: Data</td></tr><tr><td>Capital reallocation rate</td><td>0.002 (0.07)</td><td>0.089 (2.53)</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.949 (13.21)</td><td>0.832</td><td>0.030</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"8\"></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"5\">CEO Turnover</td><td>-0.001 (-0.03)</td><td>0.034 (1.94)</td><td>0.008 (0.90)</td><td>0.022 (2.45)</td><td>0.942 (15.93)</td><td>0.884</td><td>0.088</td></tr><tr><td>0.009</td><td>0.091</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.374</td><td>0.462</td><td>0.006</td></tr><tr><td>(0.36)</td><td>(3.35)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(1.63)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.14</td><td>0.018</td><td>-0.034</td><td>0.471</td><td>0.545</td><td>0.012</td></tr><tr><td>0.004 (0.12)</td><td>(3.35)</td><td>(0.87)</td><td>(-1.37)</td><td>(2.02)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"5\">Number of new initial public offerings (Poisson regression)</td><td>2.189</td><td>1.267</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.002</td><td></td><td>0.008</td></tr><tr><td>(2.66)</td><td>(1.10)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(4.40)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0.911</td><td>1.18</td><td>1.184</td><td>1.188</td><td>0.002</td><td></td><td>0.142</td></tr><tr><td>(0.78)</td><td>(1.02)</td><td>(1.53)</td><td>(1.62)</td><td>(3.61)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1.073</td><td>-0.461</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.024</td><td></td><td>0.042</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"5\">management buyouts (Poisson regression)</td><td>(2.87)</td><td>(-1.38)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(7.00)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1.365</td><td>0.793</td><td>0.077</td><td>-0.942</td><td>0.025</td><td></td><td>0.012</td></tr><tr><td>(2.43)</td><td>(1.38)</td><td>(0.25)</td><td>(-2.68)</td><td>(19.66)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"9\">Panel B: Model</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"5\">Reallocation frequency</td><td>0.214</td><td>0.186</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.797</td><td>0.737</td><td>0.011</td></tr><tr><td>(2.51)</td><td>(2.50)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(7.30)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0.223</td><td>0.176</td><td>-0.021</td><td>-0.001</td><td>0.797</td><td>0.777</td><td>0.011</td></tr><tr><td>(2.56)</td><td>(2.43)</td><td>(-0.31)</td><td>(-0.11)</td><td>(7.31)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0.204</td><td>0.179</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.785</td><td>0.690</td><td>0.023</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"4\">Capital reallocation rate, sale of physical capital K to new firms</td><td>(2.35)</td><td>(2.32)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(7.03)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0.214</td><td>0.182</td><td>-0.012</td><td>-0.002</td><td>0.785</td><td>0.721</td><td>0.023</td></tr><tr><td>(2.31)</td><td>(2.42)</td><td>(-0.12)</td><td>(-0.01)</td><td>(7.12)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nWe proxy for the level of the frontier shock $x$ using_the accumulated relative realized returns of the OMK portfolio & = - ≥ RM RMK. We choose a lag length of $L=3$ , but varying $L$ between two and six has little quantitative impact on our results. We proxy for the firm-specific productivity shock $\\varepsilon_{i}$ using the firm's Tobin's $Q$ , sales growth $\\Delta y$ , and return on assets $R O A$ We include firm fixed effects $\\gamma_{i}$ , winsorize all variables every year at the $1\\%$ level to remove the effect of outliers, and cluster the standard errors by firm and year.  \n\nWe present the results in Table IX. The left panel (A) shows the estimation results in actual data. The estimated coefficient $a_{1}$ of investment in organization capital on our return-based proxy for the frontier shock $x$ is positive and statistically significant across specifications. In addition, the coefficients $a_{2}$ to $a_{4}$ are positive and statistically significant, implying that firms invest more in organization capital when they are more productive, more profitable, and when Tobin's $Q$ is high. The right panel (B) of Table IX shows that replicating our empirical procedure in simulated data yields quantitatively similar results.  \n\n#### D.4. Operating Leverage  \n\nOur model implies that the sensitivity of firm earnings to firm output is increasing in the ratio of organization to physical capital $O/K$ .Bycontrast, the sensitivity of firm earnings to aggregate output is similar for all firms. We explore this implication by estimating  \n\n$$\n\\Delta\\log E_{i t}=a_{0}+z_{i}+a_{1}\\Delta z_{i t}+\\sum_{d=2}^{5}a_{d}D_{d t-1}\\times\\Delta z_{i t}+e_{i t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $E_{i t}$ equals operating cash fows; $z_{i t}\\in[y_{i t},\\bar{y}_{t},y_{i t}^{I}]$ is log firm sales $y_{i t}$ , log aggregate output $\\bar{y}_{t}$ , or log total industry sales $y_{i t}^{I}$ $D_{d t}$ is a dummy taking the value of one if the firm belongs in quintile $d$ at time $t$ in terms of its ratio of organization capital to assets $O/K$ ; and $z_{i}$ are firm fixed effects. We cluster the standard errors by frm and year.  \n\nTable X shows that the empirical results are consistent with the model. Firms with higher ratios of organization to physical capital $O/K$ have greater sensitivity ofearnings to firm sales. In contrast, all firms have the same sensitivity of earnings to aggregate shocks. The estimated coefficients $a_{d}$ are not statistically significantly different from zero, regardless of whether we measure aggregate output by GDP or industry sales. This lack of differential sensitivity to changes in aggregate output helps exclude alternative explanations for our asset pricing results that rely on the interpretation of SG&A expenditures as fixed costs. Replicating our empirical procedure in simulated data leads to quantitatively similar results, as we see in Panel B of Table X.  \n\n### E. The Market Price of Frontier Technology Shocks  \n\nThe key parameter in our model that determines the difference in risk premia between physical and organization capital is the price of risk of the frontier technologyshock $\\gamma_{x}$ .

Panel B shows the estimation results in simulated data, where we report the median estimated coefficient and $t$ -statistic across simulations. We compute operating leverage with respect to idiosyncratic shocks as the slope coefficient of a regression of change in log earnings before taxes and depreciation, $\\Delta\\log E_{i t}$ , on change in log firm output $Y_{i t}=\\mathrm{SALES}_{i t}$ .We compute operating leverage with respect to aggregate shocks as the slope coeffcient of a regression of change in log earnings $\\Delta\\log E_{i t}$ on change in log aggregate output or average industry sales $Y_{i t}=\\{G D P_{t}$ ， $I_{\\mathrm{SALES}_{t}}\\}$ . We interact firm and aggregate output with $\\mathrm{O}/\\mathrm{K}$ -quintile dummies, where breakpoints vary by industry. We use the 17-industry classification of Fama and French (1997). In simulated data from the model, firm output $y_{i t}$ is given by equation (16); aggregate output $\\textstyle y_{t}=\\int y_{i t}d i$ and earnings are output minus compensation to key talent $w$ .

We report first-stage GMM estimates of $\\gamma_{m}$ and $\\gamma_{x}$ using theidentity matrix to weigh moment restrictions, and adjust the standard errors using the Newey-West procedure with a maximum of three lags.  \n\nAs moment restrictions, we impose the condition that the SDF in equation (42) should price the cross-section of industry portfolios, following the advice of Lewellen, Nagel, and Shanken (2010) and Daniel and Titman (2012). Doing so has two key advantages. First, as these authors point out, the industry portfolios do not display a strong factor structure. Second, our $O/K$ portfolios are constructed by sorting firms within industries. In contrast, the empirical estimate of $\\gamma_{x}$ in (42) depends on the between industry dispersion in average returns and risk loadings. Hence, the results of this exercise provide an independent estimate of the price of risk of frontier shocks $\\gamma_{x}$  \n\nWe use three sets of proxies for the frontier shock $\\Delta x$ . The first set of proxies is based on the change in the log average (median) executive compensation $\\Delta\\bar{w}^{a}$  \n\n# TableXI Estimating the Market Price of Risk of Frontier Shocks Using Industry Portfolios  \n\nThis table presents GMM estimates of the parameters of the stochastic discount factor $m=a-$ $b_{m}R_{M K T}-b_{x}\\Delta x$ , using the cross-section of 30 industry portfolios (excluding the “Other” industry). We use three sets of proxies for the frontier shock $\\Delta x$ : first, the change in log average (median) executive compensation $\\Delta w^{a}\\left(\\Delta w^{m}\\right)$ from Frydman and Saks (2010); second, the change in log total reallocation $\\Delta r a$ from Eisfeldt and Rampini (2006); third, minus the returns to the OMK portfolio (see Section II for details). For executive compensation and reallocation we follow the literature on consumption-based asset pricing (see, e.g., Campbell (2003)) and adopt the convention that executive compensation is determined at the beginning of the period, for example, $\\Delta x_{t}=\\Delta w_{t+1}$ We normalize $a$ so that $E[m]=1$ (see, e.g., Cochrane (2001)). We normalize $R_{M K T}$ and $\\Delta x$ to zero mean and unit standard deviation. We report HAC $t$ -statistics computed using errors using the Newey-West procedure adjusted for three lags.

Hence, for example, $\\Delta x_{t}=\\Delta\\bar{w}_{t+1}$ Third, we proxy for the frontier shock using minus the returns to the OMK portfolio $\\Delta x_{t}=-R_{O M K t}$ . We normalize $R_{M K T}$ and all proxies for $\\Delta x$ tozero mean and unit standard deviation. We show the results in Table IV.  \n\nThe estimates of the price of risk of the frontier shock are negative and statistically significant across specifications (Table XI). As a result, including measures of the frontier technology shock improves upon the ability of the CAPM to price the cross-section of industry portfolios, reducing the sum of squared errorsby $30\\%$ to $50\\%$ . More importantly, the point estimates of $\\gamma_{x}$ rangefrom $-0.42$ to -0.67, and are close to the value we use in our calibration $(-0.53)$ and (minus) the Sharpe ratio of the OMK portfolio (-0.45). We conclude that our calibrated price of risk is consistent with the data.  \n\n### F. Robustness Checks and Alternative Explanations  \n\nIn this section, we briefly describe a number of robustness tests and explore a number of alternative explanations. The full set of results is available in the  \n\nInternet Appendix. Our results are quantitatively similar when we employ the following robustness tests: (i) forming equal—rather than value-weighted portfolios; (i) sorting firms into portfolios unconditionally based on organization capital to book assets, as opposed to within industry; (i) scaling the stock of organization capital by property, plant, and equipment (PPE) or the replacement value of capital as in Salinger and Summers (1983) instead of book assets; and (iv) measuring investment in organization capital as SG&A expenses minus advertising expenditures, restricting the sample to the set of firms that report advertising expenses as a line item.  \n\nWe also explore whether sorting firms on other accounting variables produces similar results. We find that sorting firms on accumulated sales leads to comparable differences in risk premia. Since firm expenditures on organization capital are increasing in firm output $y$ , this pattern is consistent with our model. We find that sorting firms in portfolios according to accumulated sales over assets leads to quantitatively similar results in model simulated data. To disentangle the two effects empirically, we sort firms on the ratio of organization capital to accumulated sales. This sort leads to portfolios' significant differences in risk premia, once exposure to other factors is accounted for. The high minus low portfolio has a Fama and French (1993) and Carhart (1997) alpha of $6\\%$ and $4.3\\%$ ,respectively.  \n\nA number of alternative mechanisms such as investment irreversibility or operating leverage could imply that high- $O/K$ firms are riskier than low. $O/K$ firms in bad times. Under the assumption that the market price of risk is countercyclical, both of these alternative explanations imply that the conditional CAPM should price the cross-section of $O/K$ portfolios. However, we find no evidence that high- $O/K$ frms are riskier than low- $O/K$ frms at times when the conditional equity premium is high. The correlation between the market beta of the OMK portfolio $\\beta_{t}^{O M K}$ and the conditional equity premium estimated using the methodology of Petkova and Zhang (2005) is negative and ranges from $-37.5\\%$ to $-7.1\\%$ depending on the specification. These results also distinguish the mechanism in our model from that in Donangelo (2011), who studies the asset pricing implications of variation in operating leverage induced by heterogeneity in labor mobility across industries.  \n\n## IV. Conclusion  \n\nOur paper considers the appropriate discount rate investors should use to value organization capital. In our model, organization capital is embodied in key talent. As a result, investing in firms with high levels of organization capital exposes shareholders to additional risks because shareholders do not own all of the cash fows from organization capital.  \n\nThe share of cash fows from organization capital that shareholders can capture varies systematically with the outside option ofthe firm's key talent. In our model, this outside option is driven by the frontier efficiency at which organization capital can be deployed in new firms. When the efficiency of organization capital in new firms improves, shareholders must offer higher compensation to induce key talent to remain with the firm. As a result, cash fows to shareholders from organization capital are negatively correlated with the frontier technology shock.  \n\nOur calibrated model quantitatively matches the dispersion in firm characteristics and risk premia associated with organization capital. In our calibration, we assume that the frontier shock leads to high marginal valuation states. This choice is motivated by the fact that an increase in the rate of reallocation will reduce current output, since restructuring is costly. As a result, shareholders demand a higher risk premium to invest in firms with more organization capital because these firms drop in value when more resources are lost to restructuring.  \n\nFinally, our model delivers a set of testable predictions that are supported by the data. Our model relates the realized returns of firms with high and low organization capital to the aggregate level of executive compensation, measures of reallocation, and investment in organization capital. Moreover, it offers predictions about the sensitivity of firm cash fows to idiosyncratic and aggregateshocks.  \n\nInitial submission: July 5, 2010; Final version received: January 22, 2013 Editor: Campbell Harvey  \n\n## Appendix: Data Construction  \n\nOur sample includes all firms in Compustat with December fiscal year $(\\mathbf{fyr}=12\\$ 0; nonfinancial firms (excluding SIC 6000-6799); firms with common shares (shrcd $=10$ and 11); frms traded on NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ (exchcd $=1$ , 2, and 3); firms with nonmissing SIC codes; and firms with nonzero values of organization capital. All variables are from Compustat, unless otherwise noted. After each variable we include in parentheses the Compustat item code, as well as the model equivalent when available.  \n\n· We rank firms on organization to physical capital relative to their industry peers as follows. We first sort firms into 17 industries, given the Fama and French (1997) classification. Then, within each industry, we sort firms into five subportfolios based on the ratio of organization capital to book assets. We then pool the subportfolios across industries to form five portfolios of firms sorted on $O/K$ , where the breakpoints are industry specific. Thus, portfolio 1 includes all the firms in the bottom quintile in terms of organization capital to assets in industry 1 through 17, etc. We construct value-weighted portfolio returns for five portfolios sorted on the ratio of organization capital to book assets $O/K$ .Weusemonthly portfolio returns and rebalance portfolios in June every year. ， We estimate beta-OMK using weekly data. Specifically, we use 1 year of nonoverlapping weekly returns to estimate presorting betas with respect to the OMK portfolio. Then, we sort all non-financial firms in CRSP into five portfolios based on their beta with the OMK portfolio. We rebalance the portfolios in January every year. Similar to our benchmark results, we compute breakpoints within the Fama and French (1997) 17 industries.  \n\n· The Solow residual $u_{i t}$ is the residual of a regression of log sales (data: sale, model $y_{i t}$ ) on log physical capital $K$ (data: ppegt; model: $c_{q}\\theta_{t}K_{i t}$ and log labor $L$ (data: emp; model $L=1$  \n\n$$\n\\ln\\mathrm{Sales}_{i t}=a_{I t}+\\beta_{I t}\\ln K_{i t}+\\gamma_{I t}\\ln L_{i t}+u_{i t},\n$$  \n\nwhere we allow the coefficients $a_{I t},\\beta_{I t}$ ,and $\\gamma_{I t}$ tu uepeiu ul uusti y (i ) aiu time $(t)$ . In the data, we use the Fama-French 17-industry classification, while in the model we assume that all firms belong to the same industry.   \n· Firm size is market capitalization (data: December market capitalization from CRSP; model: $V_{i t}^{S}$   \n·Tobin's $Q$ is the ratio of market capitalization (data: December market capitalization from CRSP plus the book value of debt ( $\\mathrm{{dltt}+\\mathrm{{dlc})}}$ plusthe book value of preferred shares (cshpri), minus inventories (invt) divided by the book value of assets (at); model: shareholder value of the firm $(V_{i t}^{S})$ divided by replacement cost of capital $(c_{q}\\theta_{t}K_{i t}))$   \n· The ratio of executive compensation to assets equals the ratio of total executive compensation (data: tdc2 from Compustat's Execucomp; model: $w_{i t},$ divided by the book value of assets.   \nPhysical capital investment rate is the ratio of capital expenditures divided by the book value of capital (data: capx divided by ppegt; model: $i_{K i t})$   \n· The stock of organization capital equals accumulated investment in organization capital minus depreciation (data: see Section II.A; model $O_{i t}$   \n· Organization capital investment rate is the ratio of SG&A divided by accumulated organization capital (data: see Section II.A; model $i_{O i t}$   \n· Firm productivity is the ratio of firm sales (data: sale; model $y_{i t}$ ) to book value of assets (data: at; model: $c_{q}\\theta_{t}K_{i t},$   \n· Firm profitability (ROA) is the ratio of firm earnings before income, tax, and depreciation (data: $\\mathrm{ib}+\\mathrm{dp}$ ; model $y_{i t}-w_{i t})$ to book value of assets (data: at; model: $c_{q}\\theta_{t}K_{i t})$ . This definition is closest in spirit to measuring cash fows as income minus operating costs, before capital depreciation. However, our measure of investment in organization capital (SG&A expenses) is treated as a cost given current accounting rules. Hence, an alternative definition of earnings in the model could be ${y-w-C_{O}}$ .Our simulation results are qualitatively and quantitatively similar under this alternative definition of earnings.   \n· Capital reallocation is the ratio of capital sales to total capital stock (data: from Eisfeldt and Rampini (2006); model: $\\int\\mathbf{1}_{\\varepsilon_{i t}\\leq\\varepsilon^{*}(x_{t})}K_{i t}d i/\\int K_{i t}d i)$   \n· CEO turnover is constructed using CEO turnover events from Execucomp. If the Exceutive ID for the CEO in year $t$ is different from the ID in year $t+1$ , we record this as a turnover event in year $t$   \n· Labor expenses per employee equals Compustat xlr deflated by cpi and divided by emp.   \n·IT expenditure data are from the 1995 and 1996 Information Week 500 Survey online at http://i.cmpnet.com/infoweek/545/graphics/iw500u.pdf and http://i.cmpnet.com/infoweek/596/graphics/biggest.pdf.   \n· The remaining variables are computed as follows: financial leverage is the ratio of book value of debt to total assets, asset tangibility is the ratio of book value of capital (item ppegt) to book value of assets, and the log capital-labor ratio is the log ratio of book value of physical capital (ppegt) to number of employees (emp).  \n\n## REFERENCES  \n\nAdams, Renee, Heitor Almeida, and Daniel Ferreira, 2009, Understanding the relationship between founder-CEOs and firm performance, Journal of Empirical Finance 16, 136-150.   \nAtkeson, Andrew, and Patrick J.
