The problems arise when firms operate in an imperfectly competitive environment and prices differ between firms. In particular, we show that the scale estimates will tend to be downward biased in the production function case, under a wide range of assumptions about the pattern of technology, demand and factor price shocks. The result also holds for scale estimates obtained from cost functions. The empirical part of the paper presents various estimates of scale economies for a sample of Norwegian manufacturing plants. The findings provide some support for the hypothesis that the firms face an imperfectly competitive environment. The estinates suggests that there are significant markups and scale economies to the variable factors of production in our sample. However, the estimates of markups and scale economies presented in this paper are substantially lower than the results obtained by Hall (1988, 1990) and others using industry level data.  \n\nTor Jakob Klette   \nCentral Bureau of Statistics   \nSkippergt. 15   \nOslo, Norway   \nZvi Griliches   \nNBER   \n1050 Massachusetts Avenue   \nCambridge, MA 02138   \nand Harvard University  \n\n# 1 Introduction  \n\nScale economies and imperfect competition have for a long time been at the hart of the industrial organization literature. More recently, researchers in other felds of economics such as international trade, macro economics and growth theory, have focused their attention to the importance of increasing returns to scale and imperfect competition'. This interest in scale economies and imperfectly competitive behavior has been stimulated further by empirical research carried out by Hall (1988, 1990) and others?. This research suggests very substantial market power in U.S. manufacturing.  \n\nHowever, one problem with the empirical research just cited is that the estimated markup is critically dependent on the assumption of constant returns to scale?. If the firms in fact are operating with short run decreasing returns to scale, their markup estimates might be an artifact due to the erroneous assumption of constant returns. It is clear that estimating the scale economies relevant for the firms' price setting decisions requires firm level data, rather than the more aggregated data employed in the studies cited above.  \n\neconometrics, but is still an unsettled research topic4. In particular, scale estimates obtained by estimating production functions tend to suggest substantial decreasing returns to scale (to all factors of production)5. On the other hand, it is well known that estimates of factor demand equations give results which imply increasing returns to scale6.  \n\nThe theoretical part of this paper shows that the practice of using deflated sales as a proxy for real output will tend to create a downward bias in the scale estimate obtained from production functions. This is so under a wide range of conditions if the firms face an imperfectly competitive environment. When estimating cost functions - which is closely related to estimating factor demand equations - we show that there will be a similar bias.  \n\nIn the empirical part of this paper we provide an attempt to identify the scale elasticity, as well as other interesting parameters, from regressions of deffated sales on usual production function regressors when a demand change variable is introduced as an additional regressor. The point is that this regression will be a reduced form model, where the parameters are mixtures of supply and demand side parameters. Under suitable assumptions we are able to identify the scale elasticity to variable factors and other parameters of interest. We find that with our reinterpretation of the parameters, the estimates obtained by the cost function and the production function specification are highly consistent. Hence, one contribution of this paper is to provide a suggestion for reconciliation of results obtained from the two approaches to estimation of producer relationship.  \n\nThe empirical part of this paper shows that the annual movements in total factor productivity at the plant level are highly correlated with the (industry-wide) demand change variable, in regressions where we do not impose assumptions about constant returns to scale (or perfect competition)'.  \n\nThe empirical model presented in the second half of this paper is very similar to a model examined by Bartelsman, Caballero and Lyons (1991). Their main finding is that productivity at the industry level is highly correlated across industries, and in particular with changes in output aggregated across industries. The current paper identifies a similar pattern at the plant level. However, the interpretation we offer differ entirely from the interpretation of Bartelsman et al., who claim their finding suggests some kind of external economies.We interpret our finding as a result of the econometric problem created by replacing the unobserved movements in output with changes in defated sales.Notice that Bartelsman et al. do not face a similar econometric problem since they could apply industry specific defiators which is their unit of observation.Unfortunately, we do not  \n\nReinterpreting our estimated production and cost function parameters as reduced form parameters, suggest that the scale elasticity to variable factors alone are of the order 1.06 - 1.10, and the demand elasticities varies between -6 to -12.  \n\nAbbott (1991) has presented results supporting the perspective of the current paper. He had access to price data for individual firms (which we do not have). His analysis shows that prices differ significantly within the hydraulic cement industry in the U.S., also after adjustment is made for differences in output mix. Using individual defators rather than industry wide deflators gives different, and in Abbott's terms, more plausible estimates of production function parameters and productivity changes8.  \n\nThis paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a general theoretical analysis of the problem created by using a common defator when prices differ between firms, in terms of the omitted variable framework. It begins by examining the production function case, and then provides a discussion of the cost function case. Section 3 carries the analysis a step further in the production function case, by studying an explicit, complete framework of supply and demand. The asymptotic bias in the OLS scale estimator is derived as  \n\nhave access to firm specific deflators.  \n\nsuming orthogonality between the idiosyncratic productivity, markup, factor price and demand shocks. Some extensions are also considered. The empirical analysis is presented in section 4. Some final remarks are added in section 5.  \n\n## 2 The omitted variable bias  \n\nIn this section we will provide a general analysis of the inconsistency of scale estimates when estimation proceeds by using deflated sales instead of output in production and cost function analysis. The analysis shows that if the (real, unobserved) prices are correlated with the included variables in the model, an omitted variable bias will arise. More specifically, we will argue that in the analysis of production functions, plausible assumptions suggest that commonly applied scale estimators will be downward biased. Also in the case of cost functions a similar bias of the scale elasticity will occur. To focus ideas we will carry out the argument in terms of panel data estimation of production relationships. That is to say, we will consider models in terms of growth rates, but the argument can easily be altered to be of relevance for pure cross sectional regressions. However, the biases will probably differ, as the importance of the various shocks considered below will be different in the cross sectional versus the time series dimension.  \n\n### 2.1  The production function case  \n\nLet us assume that the true production function relationship can be written  \n\n$$\n\\small q=X\\alpha_{0}+u^{\\mathfrak{g}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\pmb q$ is a $(N\\times1)$ - vector of the growth in “real\" output, $X$ is a $(N\\times L)$ matrix of the growth in inputs. $\\alpha_{0}$ is the $(L\\times1)$ vector of the parameters of interest, while $u$ is assumed to be an orthogonal error term. N is the number of observations. The model in equation (1) is the familiar Cobb-Douglas production function, and the scale elasticity is defined as; $\\begin{array}{r}{\\epsilon\\equiv\\sum_{i=1}^{L}\\alpha_{i0}}\\end{array}$  \n\nThe estimated model is a slight modification to equation (1):  \n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{r}=\\boldsymbol{X}\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}+\\boldsymbol{u}^{\\sf r},\n$$  \n\nwhere the left hand side variable now is $\\pmb{r}$ ,which represents changes in deflated sales. The OLS estimator of the parameter vector $_\\alpha$ , assuming orthogonality of $u^{\\tau}$ ,is  \n\n$$\n{\\hat{\\alpha}}=(X^{\\prime}X)^{-1}X^{\\prime}r.\n$$  \n\nDefine the firm specific price relative to the deflator as $\\pi$ . Then the relationship between true output $\\left(q\\right)$ and deflated sales is $\\pi+q=r$ .Focusing on the probability limit of $\\hat{\\alpha}$ , and using this relationship, we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname{plim}_{N\\to\\infty}({\\hat{\\alpha}})=\\alpha_{0}+\\operatorname{plim}_{N\\to\\infty}[(X^{\\prime}X)^{-1}X^{\\prime}\\pi)]+\\operatorname{plim}_{N\\to\\infty}[(X^{\\prime}X)^{-1}X^{\\prime}u^{q}].}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nBoth of the last two terms in equation (4) may have non-zero probability limits. The potential non-zero probability limit of the last term in equation (4) is referred to in the literature as the bias from the “transmission\" of  \n\nproductivity shocks?. This problem will be neglected for the moment, as it has been discussed extensively in the existing literature. Let us focus on the second term on the right hand side of equation (4).  \n\nTo examine the second term in equation (4), notice that it can be expressed as the OLS-estimate of the vector of $\\delta^{\\prime}s$ in the following auxiliary regression1o:  \n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\pi}=\\boldsymbol{X}\\boldsymbol{\\delta}+\\boldsymbol{u}^{\\pi},\n$$  \n\nwhere $u^{\\pi}$ is an orthogonal error term. The direction and the size of the bias in $\\hat{\\alpha}$ will depend on the sign and the magnitude of the $\\delta$ -coefficients in the auxiliary model (5). That is to say, $\\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname{plim}_{N\\rightarrow\\infty}(\\hat{\\alpha}_{\\mathbf{i}})=\\alpha_{\\mathbf{i}0}+\\delta_{\\mathbf{i}}}\\end{array}$ .Focusing on the bias in the estimated scale elasticity $\\textstyle\\left(\\hat{\\epsilon}\\equiv\\sum i\\hat{\\alpha}_{i}\\right)$ ,wehave  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{\\mathrm{plim}_{N\\rightarrow\\infty}\\hat{\\epsilon}-\\epsilon}}&{{=}}&{{\\mathrm{plim}_{N\\rightarrow\\infty}\\displaystyle\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{L}\\hat{\\alpha}_{i}\\right)-\\sum_{i=1}^{L}\\alpha_{i}}}\\ {{}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{L}\\delta_{i},}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere e is the true scale elasticity. The question now is: Will there be a systematic relationship between the changes in the price a firm charges and the growth of the firm in terms of its inputs? A satisfactory analysis of the relationship between the price a firm charge and the size of the firm requires a more complete model which include the factors which determine the firm's price setting behavior and demand. The next section will provide a simple model incorporating these aspects into a complete formal framework. For the moment we will provide a more general, but less formal discussion.  \n\nLet us first consider the impact of idiosyncratic changes in (quality adjusted) factor prices. This case is simple, and suggests that firms which experience higher costs will, cet. par., charge a higher price and loose market share. Hence, idiosyncratic changes in factor prices suggest a negative relationship between firms' price movements and the changes in input levels, i.e. $\\textstyle\\sum_{i=1}^{L}\\delta_{i}<0$  \n\nThe next case to consider is the relationship between price and the level of inputs, when there are idiosyncratic productivity shocks. If effciency levels differ between firms, it seems plausible that the more productive firm will have a larger market share, and also charge a lower price. If some frms experience productivity improvements beyond the average, they will probably, cet. par., obtain a larger market share, measured in terms of (quality adjusted) output. However, more output does not necessarily imply more inputs when productivity improves. For the specific model in the next section, it turns out that the two effects - the larger market share versus higher productivity - exactly cancel out so that there is no systematic relationship between changes in price and variations in inputs. For that particular model, the larger market share obtained as a result of higher productivity (and there by a lower quality adjusted price) is just offset by the reduction in inputs per unit output, so that the movements in firms' inputs and the changes in output prices are uncorrelated. Beyond that particular model, we are not able to make any general predictions about the relationship between changes in relative prices and the growth of firms measured in terms of inputs, when the differences are due to idiosyncratic productivity movements. Consequently, the bias in the scale estimator related to changes in relative efficiency between firms can in general not be predicted from purely theoretical considerations, even if we are willing to impose “plausible\" assumptions.  \n\nThe last case we want to discuss here is the consequences of demand shocks. If there are scale economies, changes in firm size will affect the price a frm charges in an imperfectly competitive environment. With decreasing returns to scale, we would expect a firm which grows faster than the average, to increase its relative price, and vice versa. Hence, this case suggests positive (negative) $\\delta\\cdot$ coefficients in the auxiliary equation (5) if there are negative (positive) scale economies. It follows that demand shocks will bias the estimated scale elasticity towards unity.  \n\n### 2.2  Scale estimates from cost functions  \n\nA similar result to the inconsistency pointed in the production function case applies when estimating cost functions replacing real output with deflated sales. To make this argument as transparent as possible, we will stick to the \"linear-in-variables\" casell.  \n\n$$\nc=W\\gamma_{0}+\\beta_{0}q+u^{c}\n$$  \n\nis assumed to be the true relationship. c is a $(N\\times1)$ - vector representing the growth in costs. $W$ is a $(N\\times K)$ matrix expressing the growth in the K factor prices for the $\\mathrm{N}$ observations. $\\pmb q$ is growth in real output as above. $\\beta_{0}$ is the parameter of interest. It is the inverse of the scale elasticity. Once more we assume that we do not observe real output growth; $\\pmb q$ .The estimated model assumes the same relationship replacing output with deflated sales:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{c}}&{{=}}&{{W\\gamma+\\beta r+\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{u}}^{c}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{\\vphantom{\\sum}}}&{{\\quad=}}&{{Z\\lambda+\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{u}}^{c},}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $Z$ denotes the $(N\\times(K+1))$ matrix obtained by adding the column of $\\pmb{r}$ to the $W$ matrix. $\\lambda$ is the $(K+1)$ column vector containing $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$ .It follows that the OLS-estimator, assuming orthogonality of $\\tilde{u}^{c}$ .3  \n\n$$\n\\hat{\\lambda}=(Z^{\\prime}Z)^{-1}Z^{\\prime}c\n$$  \n\nUsing the expression $r-q=\\pi$ , we can rewrite equation (7):  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l l l}{{c}}&{{=}}&{{W\\gamma_{0}+\\beta_{0}r+\\beta_{0}(q-r)+{\\tilde{u}}^{c}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{{}=}}&{{Z\\lambda_{0}-\\beta_{0}{\\pi}+{\\tilde{u}}^{c},}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\lambda_{0}^{\\prime}$ is the true parameter values $(\\gamma_{0}^{\\prime},\\beta_{0})$ . It follows that the probability limit of $\\hat{\\lambda}$ is given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname{plim}_{N\\to\\infty}(\\hat{\\lambda})=\\lambda_{0}-\\beta_{0}\\operatorname{plim}_{N\\to\\infty}(Z^{\\prime}Z)^{-1}Z^{\\prime}\\pi+\\operatorname{plim}_{N\\to\\infty}(Z^{\\prime}Z)^{-1}Z^{\\prime}\\tilde{u}^{c},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nAt this point we again neglect the last term in equation (11). The problem in focus here is the second term on the right hand side of equation (11). Once more we can obtain some intuition about this term by noting that $\\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname{plim}_{N\\to\\infty}(Z^{\\prime}Z)^{-1}Z^{\\prime}\\pi}\\end{array}$ can be thought of as the coefficient associated with the regression of $\\pi$ on $Z$ . That is to say, the term $\\scriptstyle\\operatorname{plim}_{N\\to\\infty}(Z^{\\prime}Z)^{-1}Z^{\\prime}\\pi$ is equal to the $\\widetilde{\\delta}.$ -vector in the auxiliary regression  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l l l}{{\\pi}}&{{=}}&{{Z\\tilde{\\delta}+v^{\\pi}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{{}=}}&{{W\\tilde{\\delta}_{W}+r\\tilde{\\delta}_{r}+v^{\\pi}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\upsilon^{\\pi}$ is an orthogonal error term. The question in focus is whether and how the scale coefficient will be biased, which is equivalent to ask about the significance and magnitude of the $\\tilde{\\delta}_{\\tau}$ -coefficient in the OLS-regression of the model in equation (12). Ruling out the unlikely case of inelastic demand, this coefficient will be negative. Notice that if we neglect the last term in equation (11), we have  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname{plim}_{N\\to\\infty}\\hat{\\beta}=\\beta_{0}(1-\\tilde{\\delta}_{r})}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIt follows that the cost function estimates of the scale elasticity - equal tothe inverse of $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ -- will be biased upwards in the limit.  \n\nIn passing, let us notice that the parameters associated with the factor prices will be biased downwards, as the movements in factor prices will tend to be positively correlated with the changes in relative price, $\\pi$ (i.e. $\\delta_{W}>0$ 一  \n\n## 3 Bias formulaes in an explicit model  \n\nIn this section we will provide a more formal argument of the inconsistency of the scale estimate in the production function case. We will augment the production function model in equation (1) with a simple demand equation and a price setting rule. The demand function facing a firm ${}^{\\mathfrak{c}\\mathfrak{s}}$ at time“t” can be expressed as follows:  \n\n$$\nQ_{i t}=D_{i t}P_{i t}^{\\eta},\n$$  \n\nwhere $D_{i t}$ is a demand shifter. $P_{i t}$ is the price relative the general price level in the industry. $\\eta$ is the demand elasticity12. The environment we have in mind is an industry with horizontal product differentiation13. A finite $\\eta$ corresponds to product differentiation between the goods produced by the different firms in the industryl4. If we employ the relationship between true output and deflated sales; $R_{i t}=P_{i t}Q_{i t},$ , equation (1) can be rewritten  \n\n$$\nQ_{i t}=R_{i t}^{\\eta/(\\eta+1)}D_{i t}^{1/(\\eta+1)}\n$$  \n\nWe will assume that the firms apply a markup rule:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{R_{i t}}{C_{i t}}=\\frac{\\mu_{i t}}{\\epsilon}\n$$  \n\nwhere $R_{\\mathfrak{i t}}$ and $C_{\\mathfrak{i t}}$ are (deflated) revenues and total (defated) costs. $\\mu_{i t}$ and E represent the markup and the scale elasticity.  \n\nAssuming cost minimization, we have that  \n\n$$\nC_{i t}=W_{i t}(Q_{i t}/A_{i t})^{1/\\epsilon}.\n$$  \n\n$W_{i t}$ is the defated factor price. It is convenient to defate the factor price with the same defiator as we used for the output price $(P_{i t})$ $A_{i t}$ is the productivity level, while $\\epsilon$ is the scale elasticity. Inserting equation (16) into equation (17), we get  \n\n$$\nR_{i t}=\\frac{\\mu_{i t}}{\\epsilon}W_{i t}\\left(Q_{i t}/A_{i t}\\right)^{1/\\epsilon}.\n$$  \n\nFinally, we need the production function (cf. equation (1)). Sticking to the one input casel5, we have:  \n\n$$\nQ_{i t}=A_{i t}X_{i t}^{\\varepsilon}.\n$$  \n\nTaking the logarithmic differences between the time $^{\\{\\mathfrak{s}_{\\mathfrak{t}}\\mathfrak{s}\\}}$ and $\\cdots(-1^{n}$ versions of equations (15), (18) and (19), we get the following systern of equations:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\dot{q}_{i t}=\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\eta+1}\\dot{d}_{i t}+\\displaystyle\\frac{\\eta}{\\eta+1}\\dot{r}_{i t},}\\ {\\dot{r}_{i t}=\\dot{w}_{i t}+\\left(\\dot{q}_{i t}-u_{i t}^{q}\\right)/{\\epsilon}+u_{i t}^{m},}\\ {\\dot{q}_{i t}=\\epsilon\\dot{x}_{i t}+u_{i t}^{q},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere we have introduced the notation that a dot above a lower case letter (e.g. $\\dot{q}_{i t.}$ 0, corresponds to the logarithmic differenced upper case variable $(\\log(Q_{i t})-\\log(Q_{i,t-1}))$ .The variables $u_{i t}^{q}$ and $u_{i t}^{m}$ represent $\\log(A_{i t})-$ $\\log(A_{i,t-1})$ and $\\log(\\mu_{i t})-\\log(\\mu_{i,t-1})$ . That is, $u_{i t}^{\\ell}$ corresponds to productivity shocks,while $u_{i t}^{m}$ captures deviations from a fixed markup rule16.  \n\nAssuming that the system of equations in (20) describes the economic environment facing our firms, we can examine the bias in the production function estimate of the scale elasticity. Let us first focus on the “omitted (price) variable bias\", caused by omitting the individual price from the production function (i.e. using the common deflator). The “transmission\" bias, due to the correlation between the variable input(s) and the productivity shock will be incorporated into the analysis below. We can express the omitted variable bias in the scale estimate obtained from the production function where deflated sales has replaced real output:  \n\n16In the case of price seting fims, with a finite number of frms, the deviations from a fixed markup rule will be related to a frm's market share. That is, $u_{i t}^{m}\\sim$ the deviation in the firm's market share from the mean market share, see Klette (1990, ch. 4). In the case of vertical product differentiation, the markups might be correlated with the quality of the frms' output. See Tirole (1989, ch. 7.5.1) for discussion and references. One can argue that $u_{i t}^{m}$ will develop in the time dimension depending on the firm's innovative history. E.g. an idiosyncratic productivity shock might lead the innovative firm to charge a higher markup, as discussed by Arrow (1962) in the competitive case and by Kamien and Schwartz (1982) in the oligopolistic case. The pattern of variations in $u_{i t}^{m}$ will be more complex if the firm takes into consideration intertemporal dependence in demand or production economies (cf. Tirole, ch. 1.1.2). Finally, notice that $u_{i t}^{m}$ also will capture deviations from a common scale elasticity across firms and over time. To keep our problem tractable, we will assume that $u_{i t}^{m}$ fulfils some suitable orthogonality conditions.  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{plim}(\\hat{\\epsilon})-\\epsilon=\\mathrm{plim}\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{i,t}\\dot{x}_{i t}(\\dot{r}_{i t}-\\dot{q}_{i t})}{\\sum_{j,s}\\dot{x}_{j s}^{2}}\\right],\n$$  \n\nwhere the sums in the numerator and denominator should be carried out over all observations, both across firms and over time. The probability limit is taken with respect to the number of observations17.  \n\nSolving the system of equations in (20) with respect to ${\\dot{x}}_{i t}$ and $\\left(\\dot{r}_{i t}-\\dot{q}_{i t}\\right)$ ， in terms of the supply shocks $(w_{i t},u_{i t}^{q}$ and $u_{i t}^{m}$ ) and the demand shock $\\big(\\dot{d}_{i t}\\big)$ ， we find that  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n\\dot{r}_{i t}-\\dot{q}_{i t}=\\frac{1}{\\epsilon(\\eta+1)-\\eta}\\left\\{\\epsilon(\\dot{w}_{i t}+u_{i t}^{m})+(1-\\epsilon)\\dot{d}_{i t}-u_{i t}^{q}\\right\\},\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\dot{x}_{i t}=\\frac{1}{\\epsilon(\\eta+1)-\\eta}\\left[\\dot{d}_{i t}-(\\eta+1)u_{i t}^{q}+\\eta(\\dot{w}_{i t}+u_{i t}^{m})\\right].\n$$  \n\nInserting equations (22) and (23) into equation (21), the bias can be expressed  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\mathrm{plim}(\\hat{\\epsilon})-\\epsilon=}\\ &{\\quad\\quad\\left\\{\\mathrm{plim}\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i,t}\\left[\\dot{d}_{i i}-(\\eta+1)u_{i t}^{q}+\\eta(\\dot{w}_{i t}+u_{i t}^{m})\\right]\\right.}\\ &{\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\times\\left.\\left[\\epsilon(\\dot{w}_{i t}+u_{i t}^{m})+(1-\\epsilon)\\dot{d}_{i t}-u_{i t}^{q}\\right]\\right\\}}\\ &{\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\times\\left.\\left\\{\\mathrm{plim}\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j,t}\\left[\\dot{d}_{j s}-(\\eta+1)u_{j s}^{q}+\\eta(\\dot{w}_{j s}+u_{j s}^{m})\\right]^{2}\\right\\}^{-1}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$N$ is the number of observations. To obtain some intuition about this expres sion, let us assume that all the factor price, productivity, price setting and demand shocks are orthogonal. Then the inconsistency of é can be expressed in terms of the variances  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{plim}(\\hat{\\epsilon})-\\epsilon=\\frac{\\epsilon\\eta(\\sigma_{w}^{2}+\\sigma_{m}^{2})+(\\eta+1)\\sigma_{q}^{2}+(1-\\epsilon)\\sigma_{d}^{2}}{\\eta^{2}(\\sigma_{w}^{2}+\\sigma_{m}^{2})+(\\eta+1)^{2}\\sigma_{q}^{2}+\\sigma_{d}^{2}}.\n$$  \n\n$\\sigma_{w}^{2},\\sigma_{m}^{2},\\sigma_{q}^{2}$ and $\\sigma_{d}^{2}$ are the variances of the factor prices, the “markup-disturbance\" $(u^{m})$ , the productivity shocks and demand shocks.  \n\nNotice first that as the elasticity of substitution (represented by - n) between the differentiated goods in the industry tends to infinity, the bias from neglecting the price differences will vanish. This situation corresponds to the standard case with no product diferentiation. The important point is that if there is no horizontal product differentiation in the industry, there is no scope for differences in quality adjusted prices. In this case, differences in sales corresponds to differences in inputs (costs), so sales is a valid measure for quality adjusted outputi8. This is essentially a perfectly competitive situation.  \n\nEquation (25) shows that if the demand shocks dominates, the bias will be l - e. That is to say, pure demand shifts will bias the scale estimate towards unity. Below, we will show that this results survives if we take into consideration that productivity shocks are “transmitted\" to inputs (cf. footnote10).  \n\nOnly if there are both decreasing returns to scale and the demand shocks dominate will there be an upward bias in the scale estimate. If there are increasing returns to scale, demand shocks will also contribute to a downward bias in the scale elasticity. Presence of the various supply shocks will all tend to bias the scale elasticity downwards. Notice that with a fairly high elasticity of substitution between the goods in the industry, or a scale elasticity close to unity, the magnitude of the inconsistency due to demand shocks will tend to be dwarfed by the supply shocks.  \n\nSo far, we have disregarded the bias due to “transmission” of productivity shocks. That is, there will in general be an additional term in equation (21) due to the correlation between the productivity shocks $u^{q}$ and the changes in of inputs. An explicit expression for this term can be obtained as follows. Assuming orthogonality between the various shocks, it follows by using equa. tion (23), that  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{plim}{\\frac{\\sum_{i t}\\dot{x}_{i t}u_{i t}^{q}}{\\sum_{l s}\\dot{x}_{l s}^{2}}}=-{\\frac{(\\eta+1)\\sigma_{q}^{2}}{\\eta^{2}(\\sigma_{w}^{2}+\\sigma_{m}^{2})+(\\eta+1)^{2}\\sigma_{q}^{2}+\\sigma_{d}^{2}}}.\n$$  \n\nThis equation expresses the upward bias to the scale estimate caused by the “transmission bias\" alone. Surprisingly, the positive “transmission bias\" exactly cancels the “omitted (price) variable\" bias, for our particular model. Adding the right hand side of equations (25) and (26), the total bias can be written  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{plim}(\\hat{\\epsilon})-\\epsilon=\\frac{\\epsilon\\eta(\\sigma_{w}^{2}+\\sigma_{m}^{2})-(\\epsilon-1)\\sigma_{d}^{2}}{\\eta^{2}(\\sigma_{w}^{2}+\\sigma_{m}^{2})+(\\eta-1)^{2}\\sigma_{q}^{2}+\\sigma_{d}^{2}}.\n$$  \n\nIt is now clear that idiosyncratic productivity shocks will not create any bias. Furthermore, the presence of idiosyncratic productivity shocks will tend to reduce the bias caused by demand, costs or markups shocks. This is evident since a larger variance in productivity shocks does not affect the the numerator, while it increases the denominator in equation (27).  \n\nAn interesting extension of the preceding analysis is to consider the case where $u_{i t}^{m}$ and $u_{i t}^{y}$ are correlated. What we have in mind, is that a firm which experiences a positive productivity shock might not fully pass it over to consumers by lowering its price19 . This corresponds to a positive correlation between $u_{i t}^{m}$ and $u_{i t}^{y}$ . When $u_{i t}^{m}=u_{i t}^{q}/\\epsilon$ a productivity shock is fully offset by a change in the markup, as can be seen from equation (18). The consequence of allowing for a non-zero correlation between the productivity and the markup shocks, is to add a new term $-(\\eta\\epsilon+\\epsilon)\\mathrm{Cov}(u_{i t}^{m},u_{i t}^{q})$ to the numerator of equation (27). An additional terim will also appear in the de. nominator of equation (27), equal to $-2\\eta(\\eta+1)\\mathrm{Cov}(u_{i t}^{m},u_{i t}^{q})$ . If there is a positive correlation between $u_{i t}^{m}$ and $u_{i t}^{q}$ , the additional term in the numerator is positive. The new term in the denominator is negative. Consequently, the total effect on the bias in the scale estimator from correlations between productivity movements and markup changes can not be identified without further assumptions.  \n\n## 4 Towards consistent estimates of the scale elasticity  \n\nIn this section we will show how we can identify the scale elasticity from regressions of deflated sales on usual production function regressors when we add the demand shock variable into the regression. There are two major points: The basic idea is that with observations on changes in aggregate demand and individual sales, we can infer the changes in real output (as a function of the demand elasticity) when we employ the simple demand structure presented in the previous section. The second point is that the parameters in the augmented regressions will be reduced form parameters, which are mixtures of supply and demand parameters. However, we present various specifications of our model which permits identification of the structural parameters.  \n\n### 4.1 Common, misspecified estimating equations  \n\nLet us start by explicitly stating the estimating equations for what we claim are (potentially) misspecified models. The models considered are the CobbDouglas production function and a cost function. We have also estimated a semi-parametric version of a model presented by Hall (1990). All these estimated models provide inconsistent estimates of the scale elasticity when defated sales are used to replace output, as discussed above. In the next section we will show that after adding a demand shift variable, we can reinterpret the parameters, and identify the scale elasticity and other parameters  \n\nof interest.  \n\nFollowing common practice, we have estimated a production function with deflated sales as the dependent variable (cf. equations (1) and (2)). The estimating equation in this case is  \n\n$$\n\\dot{r}_{i t}=\\beta_{1}^{r}(\\dot{m}_{i t}-\\dot{l}_{i t})+\\beta_{2}^{r}(\\dot{e}_{i t}-\\dot{l}_{i t})+\\beta_{3}^{r}\\dot{l}_{i t}+\\beta_{4}^{r}\\dot{k}_{i t}+u_{i t}^{r}.\n$$  \n\nThe variables $\\dot{m}_{i t},\\dot{l}_{i t}$ and $\\dot{e}_{i t}$ refer to materials, labour and energy. Notice that, if we neglect the inconsistency issue for the moment, this transformation of the variables imply that $\\beta_{3}^{r}$ corresponds to the scale elasticity of the variable factors.  \n\nThe next case to consider is the cost function approach (cf. equations (7) and (8)). For the cost function, the estimating equation is  \n\n$$\n\\dot{x}_{i t}=\\beta_{1}^{x}\\dot{r}_{i t}+\\beta_{2}^{x}\\dot{k}_{i t}+u_{i t}^{x}.\n$$  \n\nThe dependent variable in this equation is a cost weighted average of the variable inputs:  \n\n$$\n\\dot{x}_{i t}\\equiv\\sum_{j\\in\\{L,M,E\\}}s_{i t}^{j}\\dot{x}_{i t}^{j},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\pmb{s}_{i t}^{j}$ is the cost share of factor $j$ .This is a slight modification of the common specification of the cost function. We have used the observed shares (in variable costs) - while the common practice is to use estimated shares - in front of the factor price terms in the cost function2o. The inverse of $\\beta_{1}^{x}$ in equation (29) could be interpreted as the scale elasticity of variable inputs if output replaced deflated sales.  \n\nWe have also considered a model which relates the growth in defated sales - rather than output - to the cost-weighted input measure, growth in capital inputs and a residual21:  \n\n$$\n\\dot{r}_{i t}=\\tilde{\\beta}_{1}^{r}\\dot{x}_{i t}+\\tilde{\\beta}_{2}^{r}\\dot{k}_{i t}+\\tilde{u}_{i t}^{r}.\n$$  \n\nAs stated by Hall (1990), the $\\tilde{\\beta}_{1}^{r}$ parameter can be interpreted as a scale parameter. That is to say, if we neglect the problem of replacing output by deflated sales, the specification in equation (31) implies that the $\\tilde{\\beta}_{1}^{r}$ parameter can be interpreted as the scale parameter of variable inputs. However, this estimating equation suffer from the same problem as the production function and the cost function, in that there is an omitted variable bias associated with the discrepancy between the growth in the individual price relative to the applied deffator.  \n\n### 4.2 Reduced form models  \n\nIn the model presented in section 3, we were able to express the quality adjusted output in terms of defated sales (cf. equation (20)). We will split the demand changes into an idiosyncratic part $(\\boldsymbol{u}_{i t}^{d})$ and a component which specification, between the production function, the factor demand and the cost function approach to production econometrics.  \n\nvary over time but is common across firms within an industry $\\langle d_{I t};{}^{\\circ}\\Gamma^{\\prime}$ refer to the industry to which firm ‘i' belongs).  \n\n$$\n\\dot{q}_{i t}=\\frac{\\eta}{\\eta+1}\\dot{r}_{i t}+\\frac{1}{\\eta+1}(\\dot{d}_{I t}+u_{i t}^{d}).\n$$  \n\nUsing this equation, and replacing $\\dot{r}_{i t}$ by $\\dot{q}_{i t}$ in equation (28), we get  \n\n$$\n\\dot{r_{i t}}=\\frac{\\eta+1}{\\eta}\\left[\\beta_{1}^{r}(\\dot{m}_{i t}-\\dot{l}_{i t})+\\beta_{2}^{r}(\\dot{e}_{i t}-\\dot{l}_{i t})+\\beta_{3}^{r}\\dot{l}_{i t}+\\beta_{4}^{r}\\dot{k}_{i t}\\right]-\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\dot{d}_{I t}+v_{i t}^{r}.\n$$  \n\n$\\pmb{v}_{i t}^{\\pmb{\\tau}}$ is a composite mean-zero error term. Similarly in the cost function case; substituting $\\dot{q}_{i t}$ for $\\dot{r}_{i t}$ in equation (29), and employing equation (32), we get  \n\n$$\n\\dot{x}_{i t}=\\frac{\\eta\\beta_{1}^{x}}{\\eta+1}\\dot{r}_{i t}+\\beta_{2}^{x}\\dot{k}_{i t}+\\frac{\\beta_{1}^{x}}{\\eta+1}\\dot{d}_{I t}+v_{i t}^{x}.\n$$  \n\nLastly, replacing $\\dot{r}_{i t}$ in equation (31) by $\\dot{q}_{i t},$ and using equation (32):  \n\n$$\n\\dot{r}_{i t}=\\frac{\\eta+1}{\\eta}\\left(\\tilde{\\beta}_{1}^{r}\\dot{x}_{i t}+\\tilde{\\beta}_{2}^{r}\\dot{k}_{i t}\\right)-\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\dot{d}_{I t}+\\tilde{v}_{i t}^{r}.\n$$  \n\nNotice that in the models presented in equations (33) - (35) both the $\\eta$ and the production/cost function parameters of interest are identified.  \n\n### 4.3 The data sources and variable construction  \n\nThe data source used in this analysis is the annual census carried out by The Division of Manufacturing Statistics in The Central Bureau of Statistics of Norway. Aggregate numbers and definitions for the census are reported in NOS (several years. See also Halvorsen et al. (1991). We have employed an unbalanced sample of annual observations for the period 1983-89 (inclusive)  \n\nfor 4 industry groups producing “Metal products, machinery and equipment\". The sample includes only establishments with at least 5 employees. Plants with incomplete reports for the variables needed in the estimation have been eliminated, but no other cleaning has been carried out. Summary statistics for the employed sample is reported in table 1.  \n\nAll variables are in first diferences. In all models, we have applied a Tornquist index for the variable inputs, i.e. the shares are constructed as the average share for the two years used to construct the growth rates. The output measure is gross output adjusted for duties and subsidies. Labour inputs are represented by man hours. Price defators for gross production (at seller prices), materials, energy and capital (at buyer prices) are taken from the Norwegian National Accounts. Wage payments comprise salaries and wages in cash and kind, other benefits for the employees, taxes and social expenses levied by law.  \n\nshocks.  \n\nUnfortunately, we do not have access to demand side variables which could be employed to model the demand shift variable in equations (33) -- (35). Instead, we have used the (weighted) average growth in deflated sales across all firms in each (5-digit) industry, as our proxy for demand changes. In the appendix, we have shown that one assumption which would justify our approach is that the growth rate in the aggregate output deflator represents a (weighted) average of the unobserved growth rates in the individual output prices.  \n\neconomy entered a severe recession in 1987.  \n\n### 4.4 Other econometric issues  \n\nFor both the cost function models (cf. equations (30) and (34)) and the semiparametric models (cf. equations (31) and (35)), we have both carried out OLS and instrumental variable regressions. The instrumental variable used are changes in the number of employees. The motivation for using an IVapproach is twofold: First, it seems likely that the number of employees is less responsive to short term changes in productivity, as compared to manhours, materials and energy in the production function and semi parametric models. Similarly, in the cost function case we believe that the number of employees is less affected by temporary shifts in productivity relative to deflated sales. If these claims are true, the orthogonality assumption on the error term is more appropriate using changes in employees as an instrument. Notice that permanent diferences in productivity between firms, or random walk changes in productivity, will not cause any simultaneity bias, as all variables are expressed in terms of (annual) growth rates.  \n\nSecond, any measurement errors in the input index will cause a bias in the OLS regression. Measurement errors might be introduced if we are using weights which randomly deviate from the correct shares when constructing the input index, as well as for a variety of other reasons. If these measurement errors are uncorrelated with changes in employment, using the IV-approach will remove the bias due to errors of measurement in the input variables.  \n\n### 4.5 The Results  \n\nTable 2 reports the results obtained from estimating the production function in equation (28), as well as a model where the production function is augmented by adding the constructed demand shock variable as an explanatory variable. The main result to notice is that the demand shock variable is highly significant. However, rather than elaborating on these estimates, we will notice that the semi parametric model which aggregates the variable inputs by means of a Tornquist index performs uniformly better in terms of the RMSE; see table 3 - 6. Also, the scale estimates obtained by the semi parametric model are likely to be more consistent, as we are able to instrument the variable inputs (manhours, energy, materials) which are likely to be correlated with high frequency movements in productivity buried in the residual. In what follows we will focus on the semi parametric model, instead of the standard production function model.  \n\nTables 3-6 summarize the main results for each industry group separately. The first two columns in each of the four tables, refer to estimation of the semi parametric model in equation (31). Columns 3 and 4 present results obtained from the cost function (cf. . equation (29)), which is essentially the same regression but with a reshufling of the left hand side and right hand side variables. The last two columns provide results from estimated models augmented by including the constructed demand shock variable in theregression.  \n\nOne should notice that the reported RMSE-values refer to the root mean square prediction error of defiated sales, rather than the prediction error of the different dependent variables. This is done in order to facilitate comparisons between the various (non-nested) models.  \n\nThe first column in table 3 gives an estimate around 0.91 (standard error equal to 0.007) of what is traditionally interpreted as the scale elasticity of the variable inputs. The estimated constant term suggests an average productivity decline around -1 percent per year (same as the reported TFPfigure in table 1).  \n\nThe estimated coefficient for capital growth has the wrong sign, but is not significant. The insignificance of capital is a results which we obtain throughout our estimations. Our belief is that with the available quality of our capital measures, it is not possible to trace the annual changes in capital services. We will add further comments on this problem in the final section of the paper.  \n\nAs we compare the results from the various models, only one of the estimated scale paraimeters deviates significantly from the results just reported. That is the scale estimate obtained by OLS estimation of the cost function. The scale estimate is 1.13 (=1/0.883), and it is very precisely estimated. However, when we instrument growth in deflated sales by the growth in number of employees, the estimated scale coefficient declines to 0.93 (same as the result obtained in column 2, as we would expect, since the results reported in column 2 is obtained using the same instruments and the rest of the model is essentially the same). There are two reasons why we will place greater trust in the (higher) IV-estimate of the sales coefficient. First, random measurement errors in deffated sales will cause a downward bias in the estimated sales coefficient (and thereby an upward bias in the scale elasticity)  \n\n24. Second, a similar bias will arise due to the (negative) correlation between sales and the cost function error term, which incorporates the productivity movements with a negative sign. As discussed above, our instrument is likely to remove at least some of these biases.  \n\nBefore we continue the discussion of the scale estimates, notice that the \"demand shifter\" is highly significant when introduced into the regressions, suggesting that the firms do not face perfectly elastic demand curves (cf. columns 5 and 6). If we assume that changes in average sales capture demand shocks, we can go a step further. Using equations (34) and (35), we can identify the demand elasticity from column 5 and 6 in table 3. Simple calculations show that the two models implies a demand elasticity around -6.2. We can also identify the scale elasticity from the two set of estimates, which turn out to be about 1.10 in both cases. The same calculations for the other industries are reported in table 6.  \n\nThe results for the other industries are very similar to the findings discussed above. In particular we find that after taking into consideration the demand equation facing the firms, the results are almost identical across the two estimated models. The findings are also quite similar across industries. Our results suggest significant, but not large, scale economies in all industries, The results suggests that the firms face a less than perfectly elastic demand curve, with a demand elasticity around - 6 to - 12. (However, we have not provided confidence intervals for the estimates of the demand elasticities.).  \n\n## 5 Final remarks  \n\nThis paper has identified some problems of interpretation of the production function parameters when deflated sales is used instead of true output as the dependent variable. The problems arise in situations when the firms compete in an imperfectly competitive environment, where prices will reflect idiosyncratic differences in cost. The basic insight is that a firm experiencing a cost improvement beyond the industry average, will be inclined to undercut its competitors price and thereby expand its market share. However, since the firm will have a below average change in price, the expansion in sales will be less than proportional to the growth in output. It follows that replacing changes in real output by growth in defated sales will introduce a bias in the standard approaches to estimation of production parameters.  \n\nOur paper also provides some empirical results from a production function model, augmented by incorporating average, industry wide sales into the estimating equation. Alternative specifications are carried out. We provide one interpretation of the results along the lines outlined in the theoretical part of the paper. Our findings suggest that the firms in our sanple face downward sloping demand curves with significant, but moderate price elasticities. The results suggest some scale economies to the variable factors.  \n\nOne problem with our findings is the non-significance of capital in our models. As the equations are in first differences, this result is consistent with the general experience with these kind of data. The usual explanation is simple: The quality of our capital measures is to poor to identify the annual variations in capital services. Two key problems in this respect are variations in capacity utilization and investment lags. These issues rises the question of how we should incorporate capital into our models. Does capital have positive (shadow) price only when the firm operates at full capacity? And closely related; how does the firm incorporate the shadow price of capital into its pricing decisions? We believe that a more satisfactory solution to these questions requires an explicit dynamic model of investment behavior, incorporating uncertainty 25.  \n\nThe question raised about the measurement of the capital inputs takes us to another serious problem with the results presented above. That is, we have just provided one interpretation of the variable we have termed the “demand shock variable” (the movements in defated, industry wide sales). It is not unlikely that this variable will be correlated with changes in the utilization of capital26. If such correlation is present, the “demand shock\" coefficient is a mixture of the true demand shock coefficient and the capital coefficient. It follows that the true demand elasticity is higher than the estimates presented above, = and that the correct scale coefficient is consequently lower.  \n\ncoefficent, reinforcing the tendency stated above.  \n\nAnother interpretation of the correlation between the production function residuals and aggregate sales is examined by Bartelsman et al.(1991). They point out that the correlation between production function residuals and aggregate sales could be due to external economies in demand and supply??. A long list of theoretical models suggesting such externalities have been presented, ranging from R&D-externalities to “\"thick market effects\"28. To this list one could add measurement problems with the input and output defators. If these measurment errors are correlated across the units of observation, this problem will show up as correlation in the production function residuals (also at the industry level).  \n\nWe have not been able to unravel the different causes of the correlation between the production function residuals and movements in aggregate sales. The present paper has rather taken one extreme position by assuming that \"the demand shock\" variable captures only what is intended by its label. This interpretation of our findings has provided us with estimates of scale economies and market power (demand elasticities) which are substantially higher than what is usually obtained (or assumed) in panel data studies of production, but much lower than recent estimates obtained by Hall (1988, 1990) and others. To the extent that our demand shock variable also captures the other factors listed above, the correct interpretation of our results would 27Their analysis is carred out at the industry level, but the same mechanisms ae potentially operating at the firm level, studied here. 28See Bartelsman et al. (1991) and Caballero and Lyons (1991) for references to the literature.  \n\nbe closer to the mainstream panel data studies, and even further away from the recent results of Hall and others.  \n\n## References:  \n\nAbbott, T.A.

Assuming we have weights $\\left(w_{i t}\\right)$ such that $\\textstyle\\sum_{i\\in I}w_{i t}{\\dot{\\pi}}_{i t}=0$ , we have that:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in I}w_{i t}\\dot{q}_{i t}}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in I}w_{i t}(\\dot{d}_{I t}+\\eta\\dot{\\pi}_{i t}+u_{i t}^{d})}}\\ {{}}&{{=}}&{{\\dot{d}_{I t},}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\dot{d}_{I t}$ is the average demand shock in the industry I. It follows that if we have the appropriate weights, the common demand shifter can be constructed from the weighted mean of the growth in deffated sales.  \n\n:68-286t pofzaa 'alaues patIde au1 ur sdnox6 Aasnput xnoy aun xog sorastae1s Areums :t atqeL   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"5\">Std. 384 Mean 383 382 381 Mean</td><td>Dev. 0.393 0.164 0.365 0.138 0.104 0.115</td></tr><tr><td>Dev.1 0.339 0.141 .270 .217 .140 0.135 Std.

    "reference_markdown": "# Venture Capital Reputation, Post-IPO Performance, and Corporate Governance  \n\nC. N. V. Krishnan, Vladimir I. Ivanov, Ronald W. Masulis, and Ajai K. Singh\\*  \n\n## Abstract  \n\nWe examine the association of a venture capital (VC) firm's reputation with the post-initial public offering (IPO) long-run performance of its portfolio firms. We find that VC reputation, measured by the past market share of VC-backed IPOs, has significant positive associations with long-run firm performance measures. While more reputable VCs initially select better-quality firms, more reputable VCs continue to be associated with superior long-run performance, even after controlling for VC selectivity. We find that more reputable VCs exhibit more active post-IPO involvement in the corporate governance of their portfolio firms, and this continued VC involvement positively influences post-IPO firm performance.  \n\n## I. Introduction  \n\nA firm's reputation gives potential customers valuable information when making their purchase decisions, while offering important competitive advantages to more reputable firms (see, e.g., Kreps and Wilson (1982), Shapiro (1983)). Prior research finds strong empirical evidence that reputation is a valuable asset, and this has led researchers to develop a number of theoretical models of reputation in the financial services industry.1 For specialized financial intermediaries that face a large number of competitors, reputation can be particularly important. To further our understanding of how reputation is built, we study the reputation of venture capital (VC) firms, which are specialized financial intermediaries operating in a highly fragmented industry,2 where reputation is particularly valuable not only to VCs and their investors but also to potential portfolio firms that rely heavily on VC advisory services and risk capital for their survival and growth.  \n\nOur primary goal is to examine the role of VC reputation in explaining longrun performance of venture-backed firms going public. Post-initial public offering (IPO) performance of these firms is important to IPO investors, to VCs that hold stock beyond the usual 180-day lock-up period (Field and Hanka (2001)), to entrepreneurs seeking VC funding, and to VC investors who frequently receive IPO shares when their funds ultimately exit from their investments in portfolio firms.  \n\nOur VC reputation measure is based on a venture investor's past market share of completed venture-backed IPOs, which we refer to as IPO Market Share. This measure is similar to the Megginson and Weiss (1991) underwriter reputation measure and captures a VC's IPO success rate relative to those of other VCs.3 This measure is also related to a Cumulative IPO Market Share measure used by Nahata (2008), who shows that this measure is positively related to the probability of a VC-backed firm going public. However, unlike Nahata's measure, IPO Market Share is based on a 3-year moving window prior to the IPO, which makes our measure current and avoids the strong bias against younger VC firms that is inherent in the Cumulative IPO Market Share measure that does not adjust for the length of a VC's active life. More importantly, Nahata focuses on VC exits including IPOs, while we focus on post-IPO issuer performance and its causes. Because younger VCs can have strong incentives to “grandstand' by taking weak firms public to0 early (see Gompers (1996), Lee and Wahal (2004)), it is important not only to look at how VC reputation correlates with IPO frequency, but also to how well these firms perform after going public.  \n\nFor IPO issuers with more than 1 VC investor, we focus on the lead VC's reputation measure, and following Lin and Smith (1998) and Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu (2007) define a “lead\" VC as having the largest venture investment in the portfolio firm as of the IPO date. We show that compared to nonleads, lead VCs are more apt to hold issuer shares and board seats at the IPO, and continue to hold them in the post-IPO period. Therefore, focusing on lead VCs enables us to capture the greater guidance and support that these influential VC syndicate members provide to portfolio firms.  \n\nWe examine the associations of our VC reputation measure with portfolio company long-run performance measures after going public, using 4 well-known performance standards: i) industry-adjusted rate of return on assets (ROA), i) market-to-book ratio, ii) long-run exchange listing survival, and iv) longrun abnormal stock returns (see, e.g., Moeller, Schlingemann, and Stulz (2004), Gompers, Ishi, and Metrick (2003), and Field and Karpoff (2002)). All the performance measures are based on the 3-year post-IPO period. Our VC reputation measure is based on data available at the start of the IPO year to reduce concerns about reverse causality between VC reputation and issuer post-IPO performance.  \n\nWe find that our lead VC reputation measure consistently has a significant positive relation with all 4 post-IPO long-run performance metrics, after controlling for observable IPO characteristics that can be related to future issuer performance. However, superior long-run performance of firms backed by more reputable VCs can be attributable to superior venture investment selectivity or to superior post-IPO nurturing of portfolio firms. Consistent with the evidence in Sorensen (2007), we find that more reputable VCs select better-quality portfolio firms. However, even after controlling for VC selectivity, we find that more reputable VCs have a significant positive association with our long-run performance measures. Thus, we conclude that more reputable VCs provide more valuable advisory and monitoring services to their portfolio firms, in addition to initially selecting better-quality portfolio firms to invest in.  \n\nWe also compare the associations of alternative VC reputation measures suggested in the existing literature with our 4 issuer long-run performance measures. Gompers (1996) proposes VC firm age as a VC reputation measure, Lee and Wahal (2004) use VC firm age and the number of IPO firms a VC has previously backed, and Gompers and Lerner (1999) use capital under management. Nahata (2008) shows that a Cumulative IPO Market Share measure has the best association with future IPOs among the measures he considers. We show that IPO Market Share is the only reputation measure that consistently shows significant positive associations with all 4 standard issuer long-run performance measures we examine. Furthermore, our IPO Market Share reputation measure has a significant positive association with 4 less conventional measures of long-run performance; specifically, the probability of subsequent acquisition, the expected acquisition takeover premium, and 2 forward-looking proxies of long-term firm growth. The alternative VC reputation measures again do not consistently have significant associations with these alternative long-run performance measures.  \n\nTo investigate how VC reputation is related to portfolio firm advisory and monitoring services, we examine whether VC reputation is associated with stronger corporate governance and greater VC involvement in the post-IPO period, and whether this leads to superior portfolio firm performance. This line of inquiry expands on prior research that finds that some VCs tend to hold their equity stakes in portfolio firms well beyond the IPO lock-up period (usually lasting 180 days) (Gompers and Lerner (1998), Field and Hanka (2001), and that some VCs are more likely to be associated with more independent boards and a non-chief executive officer (CEO) board chairman (Baker and Gompers (2003)). We advance the earlier Baker and Gompers evidence on VC reputation effects by adjusting for endogeneity and exploring the post-IPO governance activities of VCs by reputation, and we find interesting new results, which are described later.  \n\nWe first establish that more reputable VCs hold shares and board seats in a significantly higher proportion of their portfolio firms, not only at the IPO date, but also in the first 3 years thereafter. More reputable VCs are also associated with portfolio firms employing better corporate governance structures, including fewer cases of dual CEO-COB (chairman of the board) and CEO-founders, both of which weaken board discipline over a CEO. However, after controlling for VC selectivity, we find that firms backed by more reputable VCs are significantly more likely to continue to benefit from VC shareholdings and directorships in the 3-year post-IPO period, while other internal corporate governance mechanisms are not significantly different from firms backed by less reputable VCs. We also establish links between both post-IPO VC shareholdings and directorships and superior issuer performance in this same 3-year period. After controlling for endogeneity of a VC's post-IPO shareholdings and directorships, we find evidence that the post-IPO involvement of more reputable VCs in their portfolio firms is associated with superior long-run performance.  \n\nNahata's (2008) evidence is complementary with our results in that we both find that a VC reputation measure based on past IPO market share is strongly related to both pre- and post-IPO performance of its portfolio firms. A reason why this reputation measure is so robust (compared to alternative reputation measures found in the extant literature) is that an IPO is generally the most profitable and publicly visible VC investment outcome, and hence it is a particularly relevant measure of VC success. Indeed, Brau, Francis, and Kohers (2003) report a \"valuation premium” of $22\\%$ for IPOs over acquisition (trade sale) exits, while Cumming and MacIntosh (2003) report that, in partial exits, average annual rates of return to VCs are $84\\%$ in IPOs and only $20\\%$ in acquisitions. Megginson and Weiss (1991) observe that Kleiner Perkins came to the market with 10 different IPOs in their sample period (1983-1987), giving it great visibility in the marketplace.4 Repeated IPO success can provide a VC with better access to attractive investment opportunities and the ability to negotiate more generous investment terms, as documented by Hsu (2004). We show that even after allowing for greater opportunity to be selective in their investments, more reputable VCs exhibit continued post-IPO involvement in their portfolio firms, which is associated with superior firm performance. In turn, superior post-IPO performance attracts investors to future IPOs backed by these VCs, increasing the probability of their backing successful future IPOs. This track record also attracts entrepreneurs with promising projects to more reputable VCs, enabling them to be more selective. Finally, a record of IPO success by more reputable VCs facilitates more frequent and larger future fund-raising. Thus, past success helps facilitate future success for these talented and experienced VCs.  \n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the data and methodology and provides descriptive statistics. Section III analyzes the link between VC reputation and post-IPO issuer performance measures. Section IV reexamines these relations after controlling for self-selection.  \n\nSection V analyzes VC monitoring and support of portfolio firms in the postIPO period as a reason for post-IPO issuer performance. Section VI concludes. Appendix A provides definitions of key variables used in our analysis. Appendix B reports on a robustness check.  \n\n## 11. Data and Methodology  \n\n### A. IPO Sample Construction  \n\nOur sample consists of U.S. IPOs completed in the 1993-2004 period. IPO issue characteristics and names of lead underwriters are taken from Thomson Financial's Securities Data Corporation (SDC) Platinum Global New Issues database. VC investors in IPO issuers are taken from this database and are compared to VC investment rounds reported in Thomson Financial's Venture Economics database.5 Stock returns and exchange listing dates come from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) database. Financial data of IPO issuers are taken from Compustat. We exclude i) IPOs not listed on major U.S. exchanges or reported in the CRSP database within 1 month of their IPO dates; i) IPOs of financial intermediaries, limited partnerships, foreign corporations, reverse LBOs, spinoffs, carve-outs, unit offerings, small offerings under $\\$5$ million in global proceeds and whose offering prices are under $\\$5$ per share; and ii) IPOs for which any important variable needed for our analysis is unavailable.  \n\n### B. Post-IPO Issuer Performance Measures  \n\nOur 1st measure of long-run performance is ROA, the match-adjusted return on assets (defined as net income divided by book value of total assets). The industry match-adjustment process is described below. First, each IPO issuer in our sample is matched to a sample of nonequity issuers (in the 3 years before and after the IPO date) based on the issuer's industry, which is measured by its 4-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code if there are at least 5 other firms in the industry, or else it is based on its 3-digit (or 2-digit) SIC code so that we can obtain at least 5 nonissuing firms. Then, the median ROA of the matched sample of nonissuers is subtracted from the ROA of the IPO firm (see Barber and Lyon (1996) for evidence supporting the use of median adjustments in such tests of accountingdata).  \n\nOur 2nd measure of long-run performance is the market-to-book equity ratio (M/B), which often is used to value a firm's real options and is a proxy for Tobin's Q.6 The market-to-book ratio is measured at the end of the $12\\mathrm{th}$ quarter following the IPO. To avoid inducing survivorship bias into our measures of long-run performance, we use the $n$ -quarter $(n<12$ ) ROA and M/B figures for IPO issuers that do not survive 3 calendar years beyond the IPO date, where $n$ is the maximum number of quarters for which data are available in Compustat. We winsorize the ROA and M/B figures at the $1\\%$ and $99\\%$ levels to minimize the effects of outliers that can be induced by data errors.  \n\nOur 3rd measure of long-run performance is listing survival (Survival), which is an indicator variable that takes a value of 1 for firms that remain listed on the NYSE, AMEX, or NASDAQ (i.e., remain in the CRSP database) for 3 years following their IPOs or that are merged or acquired by listed firms (which themselves remain listed for the remainder of the 3 calendar years following the IPO dates), and O otherwise (firms that become bankrupt, defunct, are liquidated, or go private).7 This is a measure of an issuer's long-run financial strength, and should capture the adverse consequences of pre-IPO accounting window dressing that attempts to raise IPO investor demand by either boosting a firm's pre-IPO earnings through creative accounting or reducing its expenditures on promising investments at the cost of its future profits. For example, Li, Zhang, and Zhou (2008) find that firms with more earnings management (window dressing) in the IPO year are more likely to delist, and are likely to delist sooner than other firms. Teoh, Welch, and Wong (1998) report that the well-documented poor post-IPO long-run stock performance of IPOs is associated with earnings reversals following window dressing of pre-IPO earnings figures. We expect more established VCs with greater reputation capital at risk to actively discourage firms with weak long-term prospects to window-dress or defer profitable investment opportunities to boost current earnings.  \n\nWe follow much of the existing IPO literature by reporting long-run abnormal stock returns (see, e.g., Brav and Gompers (1997) as our 4th measure of longrun performance. It is defined as an issuer's factor-adjusted abnormal stock return (Return) measured over the 36 months after the issue month. The factors used to adjust returns are the 3 Fama and French (1992) factors and the Carhart (1997) momentum factor.8 Fama (1998) advocates this approach for computing abnormal stock returns because it is less affected by skewness and other “bad model' problems than other popular methods. To avoid inducing survivorship bias, we compute long-run stock returns for IPO firms using monthly returns for the 36-month post-IPO period or until delisting, whichever comes first. Return is winsorized at the $1\\%$ and $99\\%$ levels to limit the effects of outliers on our results. We also check that our main results are robust if we do not winsorize ROA, M/B, and Return.  \n\n### C. VC Reputation Measure  \n\nOur VC reputation measure, IPO Market Share, is computed as VC's dollar market share of all venture-backed IPOs in the preceding 3 calendar years. For instance, to analyze the long-run performance of an IPO completed in 1996, we first aggregate the dollar value of all IPOs backed by a VC during years 1993, 1994, and 1995 as a proportion of the total dollar size of all venture-backed IPOs in the same 3-year period. Following Ritter (1984) and Megginson and Weiss (1991), we define the dollar size of an IPO as its gross proceeds, exclusive of overallotment options. Each VC investor is given full credit for a completed IPO that it backs. IPO Market Share is based on information known prior to the IPO event under analysis and is thus free of look-ahead bias. The data are taken from Thomson Financial's SDC Platinum Global New Issues and Venture Economics databases.  \n\nGiven our emphasis on the monitoring role of VCs in the post-IPO period, when there are multiple VC investors in an IPO issuer, we focus on the effects of a lead VC's reputation since we find that they tend to remain actively involved in their portfolio firms as shareholders and directors in the post-IPO period, unlike other syndicate members. When there are multiple leads, we equally weight their individual reputation measures. When there is only 1 VC investor in an IPO issuer, it is treated as the lead VC.  \n\nThe mean and median IPO Market Share figures for our sample of VCbacked IPOs are $0.42\\%$ and $0.36\\%$ , respectively, which are close to each other, suggesting that outliers are not a serious concern for our VC reputation measure. Note that top VCs such as J.P. Morgan Partners, Kleiner Perkins, New Enterprises Associates, Sequoia Capital, and Integral Capital Partners all have annual market shares of VC-backed IPOs exceeding $1\\%$ , averaged over our full sample period.9  \n\nOverall, unlike the market share for IPO underwriters, where about $90\\%$ is controlled by the top 10 investment banks over our sample period,10 vCs operate in a highly fragmented industry, and only $28~\\mathrm{VCs}$ have average annual market shares of VC-backed IPOs in excess of $0.5\\%$ over our full sample period. Many of the most reputable VCs, based on the IPO Market Share measure, are highly ranked by VC industry publications, such as the Top 100 Early Stage VCs list published by Entrepreneur magazine and the Top $100~\\mathrm{VCs}$ list published by Forbes magazine.  \n\n### D. Alternative VC Reputation Measures  \n\nBecause the extant literature has suggested many alternative candidates as VC reputation measures,1l we compare the associations of our 4 standard postIPO issuer performance measures with the following alternative reputation measures.  \n\ni) IPO Frequency is defined as the number of completed IPOs in a VC's portfolio over the prior 3 calendar years, relative to the number of companies in its active investment portfolio (averaged over the beginning and end of the same 3 years). This reputation measure is not strongly influenced by a few large IPOs. Gompers (1996) finds a positive relationship between IPO Frequency and future VC fund-raising (also see Lee and Wahal (2004)).  \n\nii) VC Age is measured by the period between the IPO date and the VC firm's incorporation date or January 1, 1980, if the incorporation date is earlier. The reinterpretation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) \"prudent man\" standard in 1979 is widely believed to mark the beginning of the modern VC market (see Gompers and Lerner (1999), Hellmann, Lindsey, and Puri (2008)). We therefore compute VC Age from January 1, 1980, for VCs incorporated before this date. Gompers (1996) uses VC Age as a VC reputation measure, while Hsu (2004) argues that VC Age captures venture investment experience.  \n\niii) VC Capital represents a VC's capital under management, measured by total dollars invested or available for investment, based on capital commitments of limited partners at the pre-IPO year-end. It captures a VC's fund-raising and investment management ability. Gompers and Lerner (1999) argue that VC Capital is indicative of a VC's future fund-raising ability.  \n\niv) Cumulative IPO Market Share is defined as the dollar market share of IPOs that the VC backed between 1993 and the year prior to the IPO. Nahata (2008) argues that VC reputation based on cumulative IPO market share is positively related to the probability of future IPOs by its portfolio firms.  \n\n### E. Control Variables  \n\nWe control for the effects of other issue and issuer characteristics on issuer long-run performance to ensure that VC reputation is not a proxy for observable sample heterogeneity. Also, to the extent that these observable issue and issuer characteristics are used in a VC's venture investment selection process, the marginal effect of VC reputation on issuer performance should primarily capture VC advisory and development activities.  \n\nSeveral studies beginning with Megginson and Weiss (1991) find that VCbacked firms have relatively strong post-IPO performance. Thus, we include an indicator variable that is equal to 1 for VC backing, and O otherwise to ensure that our VC reputation measure is not capturing the average performance benefits of any VC backing, but instead represents the marginal effect of investment by more reputableVCs.  \n\nPrevious studies find that lead underwriter reputation significantly affects post-IPO long-run returns (Carter, Dark, and Singh (1998)). To avoid falsely attributing underwriter reputation effects to VC reputation, underwriter reputation is also included in our regression analysis. We measure underwriter reputation by its Carter and Manaster (1990) ranking, Underwriter Reputation, as updated on Jay Ritter's Web site (http://bear. warrington.ufl.edu/ritter/ipodata.htm). The correlation between Underwriter Reputation and IPO Market Share is only $29.4\\%$ which provides additional comfort that our VC reputation measure is not simply acting as a proxy for underwriter reputation.  \n\nThe natural log of IPO gross proceeds (Ln Offer Size) is a common issue characteristic used in many well-known IPO studies. It is often argued that larger offers are typically made by more established and financially stronger IPO issuers (Carter et al. (1998)). Issuer age at the IPO, measured relative to the firm's first incorporation date, is another characteristic frequently used in the IPO literature (Barry, Muscarella, Peavy, and Vetsuypens (1990)). It is used as a proxy for more established firms, which have more tangible assets, a more seasoned management team, and more extensive and well-established customer base, all characteristics that imply a lower issuer growth profile. To reduce skewness, we follow prior research and measure issuer age by the natural logarithm of $1+$ issuer age (Ln Issuer Age).  \n\nTo control for differences in IPO demand or IPO firm quality, we include i) offer Price Revision, measured by the percentage increase in final offer price from the midpoint of the high and low prices in the initial filing (see Hanley (1993)); i) IPO 1st-day return, termed Underpricing (see Welch (1989)); i) IPO issuer market capitalization, measured by multiplying offer price by the total number of post-IPO shares (including those retained by owner), termed Issuer Market Cap (see Brav and Gompers (1997), Loughran and Ritter (2004)); and iv) the issuer's market-to-book ratio, Issuer M/B, which is commonly used to measure firm growth opportunities (see Brav and Gompers). Finally, we include industry and year fixed effects in our regression analysis.12 The data sources for these variables are Thomson Financial's SDC Platinum Global New Issues database and Compustat. SIC codes are taken from the CRSP database (see, e.g.,. Moskowitz and Grinblatt (1999)).  \n\nFinally, following Nahata (2008), we also control for VC Age, VC Syndication, and VC Network Centrality, where VC Age, described previously, proxies for VC experience, and VC Syndicate Size is measured by the number of VC syndicate members invested in an IPO issuer. Following Hochberg et al. (2007), VC Network Centrality is measured by Degree, the number of unique VC firms that syndicate with the VC firm in question over the past 5 years normalized by the number of unique VCs (excluding the one under consideration) that participate in any VC syndicate during that same time period. Nahata uses Degree as his measure of “VC Connectedness.\" Data for these measures come from Thomson Financial's Venture Economics database.  \n\n### F. Corporate Governance Data  \n\nTo examine the effects of VC monitoring and support of portfolio firms, we collect information on the following 5 corporate governance features of VCbacked IPO issuers: i) VC shareholdings, ii) VC directorships, ii) dual CEOCOBs, iv) CEO-founders, and v) staggered boards. We observe these 5 corporate governance characteristics at the IPO date, as well as over the 3 years thereafter.  \n\nThe data are hand collected from IPO prospectuses (for the year of the offering) and from annual proxy statements for each of the 3 years thereafter. If proxy statements are not available, we use information from annual reports and 10K filings. Corporate governance data are available for 813 VC-backed issuers at the IPO date, and 783, 690, and $590~\\mathrm{VC}$ -backed IPO issuers, respectively, for the 3 years thereafter. It must be noted that IPO prospectuses, annual proxy statements and 10K filings, which are our main information sources, are only required to list shareholdings of directors and beneficial owners of $5\\%$ or more. Thus, a VC investor who owns less than $5\\%$ of shares and has no board seat need not be reported. In other words, we primarily examine block ownership effects.  \n\n### G. Descriptive Statistics  \n\nWe start with all completed U.S. IPOs spanning the period 1993-2004 that meet our sample criteria, which includes 1,503 VC-backed IPOs. Of these VCbacked IPOs, we use the 378 VC-backed IPOs completed during the first 3 years of the sample period (1993-1995) to calculate a VC's initial reputation in year 1996. In later years, we update the VC reputation measure annually using a prior 3-year rolling window. In this way, VC reputation is measured at the start of every year with data taken from the prior 3 years, and then it is linked to the subsequent 3-year post-IPO issuer performance measures for IPOs made in the 1996-2002 period. In the 10-year (1993-2002) period, our sample contains 1,200 IPOs backed by 1,519 separate VCs and 1,302 IPOs without VC backing.  \n\nExamining post-IPO performance is only relevant when portfolio firms successfully go public in the first place. So we first assess whether our VC reputation measure is significantly associated with the probability of future IPOs. For this purpose, we link our VC reputation measure for each year in our sample period to the number of completed IPOs a VC backs in the following 3 years. For example, we relate 303 VC-backed IPOs made in the 2003-2004 period, plus the 19 VCbacked IPOs made in 2002, to our VC reputation measured at the start of 2002. Thus, all of our analysis is conducted without any look-ahead bias.  \n\nAfter excluding VC-backed IPOs made in the 1993-1995 period (used to construct each VC's initial reputation measure) and VC-backed IPOs made in the 2003-2004 period (used only to calculate the probability of future IPOs analysis), we examine VC reputation effects on the post-IPO long-run performance of 2,019 IPOs issued in the 1996-2002 period, of which 822 are VC-backed IPOs. Panel A of Table 1 presents yearly frequencies of VC-backed and non-VC-backed IPOs. While CRSP data are available for the Survival and Return performance measures for our entire IPO sample, Compustat-based ROA and M/B figures are only available for 787 VC-backed IPOs and 1,154 non-VC-backed IPOs, respectively.  \n\nPanel B of Table 1 compares the characteristics of completed IPOs with and without VC backing. Consistent with Gompers and Lerner (2000) and Lee and Wahal (2004), VC-backed IPO issuers tend to be younger, and consistent with Lee and Wahal, IPOs with VC backing typically are underwritten by more prestigious lead investment banks. Both average offer price revision and 1st-day return are significantly higher for VC-backed IPOs.  \n\nTABLE 1 Descriptive Statistics of IPO Sample  \n\nPanelAof Table1reports thenumber of non-VC-backedandVC-backed IPOsbyyearinoursample of2,019IPOs completed in the 1996-2002 period.Panel B reports the mean issue and issuer characteristics for our non-VC-backed and VC-backed IPOsamples.Panel Creports the meanlong-termperformance measures for our non-VC-backed and VC-backed IPO samples.The variables are defined in Appendix A.Also reported are the significance of the differences in meansbetween the2samples. $N$ denotes the number of observations analyzed.\\*,\\*\\*, and \\*\\*\\* denote significant difference in the means of the 2 groups at the $10\\%$ $5\\%$ and $1\\%$ levels,respectively.  \n\nPanel A.

For all 4 standard long-run performance measures, firm performance is significantly higher for VC-backed IPOs than for non-VC-backed IPOs. This is consistent with findings in a number of earlier studies (see, e.g., Brav and Gompers (1997)) and highlights the need for a VC-backing indicator in our regression analysis.  \n\nIn our sample of VC-backed IPOs, $17\\%$ are backed by a single VC. Of the remaining IPOs, $13\\%$ are backed by a syndicate of $2~\\mathrm{VCs}$ $13\\%$ by $3~\\mathrm{VCs}$ $10\\%$ by 4 VCs, $9\\%$ by $5~\\mathrm{VCs}$ $25\\%$ by a syndicate of $6{-}10\\mathrm{VCs}$ , and the remaining $13\\%$ of the IPOs by a syndicate of more than $10\\:\\mathrm{VCs}$  \n\nWe find that lead VCs hold a significantly higher proportion of issuer shares and board seats than nonlead VCs, not only at the IPO date, but also in 1, 2, and 3 years thereafter.13 Indeed, Lin and Smith (1998) report that shareholdings in portfolio firms are significantly higher for lead VCs than for nonlead VCs at the IPO, and in some firms the lead VC shareholdings do not drop substantially, even 3 years after the IPO. We also find that the average shareholdings of a lead VC is $9.4\\%$ at the IPO, and slowly drops to $8.05\\%$ ， $7.70\\%$ , and $6.62\\%$ , respectively, 1, 2, and 3 years afterward. Field and Hanka (2001) report that, on average, VCs sell $29\\%$ of their stake in the 1st year after the IPO, similar to the number reported in Barry et al. (1990). Both of these studies examine all VC syndicate investors without distinguishing between lead and nonlead VCs. We find that the drop in shareholdings of lead VCs is roughly $\\%$ as great, in line with Lin and Smith's argument that lead VCs tend to be more involved in their portfolio firms than nonlead VCs. Thus, our focus on lead VCs enables us to clearly capture the greater monitoring, advice, and support that lead VCs provide to portfolio firms after their IPOs.  \n\n## Ill.Evidence on Post-IPO Performance  \n\nA. Multivariate Regression Analysis  \n\nThe advice, monitoring, and support of reputable VCs should manifest itself in superior post-IPO long-run performance of their portfolio firms. We assess the power of VC reputation measures to explain long-run firm performance of IPO issuers by using the following regression specification across our sample of VCbacked and non-VC-backed IPOs:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{P}&{=}&{\\beta_{Y}+\\beta_{I}+\\beta_{1}\\mathrm{IPO~Market~Share}+\\beta_{2}\\mathrm{VC~Backed}}\\ &&{+\\beta_{3}\\mathrm{Underwriter~Reputation}+\\beta_{4}\\mathrm{Ln~Offer~Size}}\\ &&{+\\beta_{5}\\mathrm{Ln~Issuer~Age}+\\beta_{6}\\mathrm{Issuer~Market~Cap}+\\beta_{7}\\mathrm{Issuer~M/B}}\\ &&{+\\beta_{8}\\mathrm{Price~Revision}+\\beta_{9}\\mathrm{Underpricing}+\\varepsilon,}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $P$ is 1 of the post-IPO firm performance measures: ROA, M/B, Survival, or Return; $\\beta_{Y}$ is a vector of year fixed effects to control for changing economic conditions; and $\\beta_{I}$ is the vector of the 8 Gompers et al. (2006) industry fixed effects to control for differences across industries where VC investment is concentrated.  \n\nPanel A of Table 2 focuses on IPO Market Share reputation and reports coefficient  estimates and $t\\cdot$ -statistics based on  standard errors robust  to heteroskedasticity and adjusted for industry clustering.14 IPO Market Share has statistically significant positive associations with all 4 measures of long-run performance (ROA, M/B, Survival, or Return), even after controlling for the effect of VC backing. This is strong evidence that VC reputation is a statistically important characteristic of IPO issues. To measure the economic significance of IPO Market Share in explaining post-IPO long-run issuer performance, we take a 1-standard  \n\n# TABLE 2 Issuer Long-Run Performance Measures and VC Reputation  \n\nTable 2 presents cross-sectional regression estimates and associated t-statistics( $Z\\cdot$ statistics in the case of logit regression) in parentheses, based on standard errors that are robust to heteroskedasticity and adjusted for industry clustering. Each post-IPO performance measure is regressed on the lead VC reputation measure, IPO Market Share, computed as a VC's dollar market share of all venture-backed IPOs in the prior 3 calendar years and a set of control variables. Regressions are based on OLS when the dependent variable is ROA, $\\sf M/B$ or Return and a logit model in the case of Survival,using 1,941, 1,941, 2,019, and 2,019 VC-backed and non-VC-backed IPOs completed in the 1996-2002 period. Adjusted $R^{2}$ values are reported for OLS regressions, and a pseudo $R^{2}$ value for the logit regression. \\*,\\*\\*, and \\*\\* denote coefficient estimates significantly different from O at the $10\\%$ $5\\%$ and $1\\%$ levels, respectively.

A 1-standard-deviation increase in VC reputation also raises the odds of firm survival by a factor of 1.3, after controlling for other issue characteristics. Thus, IPO Market Share associations with post-IPO issuer performance measures have clear economic as well as statistical significance.  \n\nIn Panel B of Table 2, we include 3 additional control variables to regression specification (1): VC Age, VC Syndicate Size, and VC Network Centrality (measured in Hochberg et al. (2007) by their Degree variable). Nahata (2008) argues that VC Age measures a VC's industry experience, VC Syndicate Size measures the benefits of syndication, and VC Network Centrality measures how networked a VC is. Because an argument can be made that these variables are correlated with our existing explanatory variables, we check our results with and without these 3 additional control variables (Panels A and B). IPO Market Share continues to have statistically significant positive associations with all 4 measures of long-run performance (ROA, M/B, Survival, or Return), even after controlling for these additional control variables.  \n\nThe significant positive relation between IPO Market Share reputation and post-IPO issuer long-run abnormal stock returns warrants further discussion. One interpretation of this positive relation is that the stock market is inefficient in fully reflecting the benefits associated with more reputable VCs at the time of the IPO. Our alternative interpretation is that if IPO issuers backed by more reputable VCs continue to invest in risky growth options in the post-IPO period, thereby increasing their average risk level, then they would exhibit positive abnormal stock returns under a standard stationary risk adjustment procedure. Consistent with this interpretation, we find that, in the post-IPO period, more reputable VCs are associated with IPO firms having higher research and development (R&D) expense and capital expenditure ratios, which are commonly used proxies for investment in riskier long-term growth opportunities.  \n\nIt is noteworthy that the VC indicator variable is statistically insignificant (significant) in regressions of all 4 standard firm performance measures when IPO Market Share is included (excluded) in the statistical model, which indicates that controlling for VC reputation is more informative than simply controlling for the existence of a VC investor (as is commonly done in much of the extant literature). The key implication is that the identity of a VC investor has a substantial bearing on post-IPO performance.  \n\nExamining the control variables, more reputable underwriters are also associated with superior ROA and Return performance, consistent with prior findings (see, e.g., Carter et al. (1998)). Larger IPO issues and older issuers are associated with significantly smaller M/B.15 Firm survival increases for older IPO issuers and issues underwritten by more reputable investment bankers. In line with the grandstanding argument in Gompers (1996), VC Age is significantly and positively related to post-issue IPO issuer Survival, and in line with the benefits of having influential networks as argued by Hochberg et al. (2007), VC Network Centrality is significantly and positively related to post-IPO ROA.  \n\n### B. Additional Robustness Analysis  \n\nFirst, we assess whether IPO Market Share continues to be significantly associated with ROA, M/B, and Return if we do not winsorize the issuer performance variables. In untabulated results, we find that IPO Market Share continues to have a significant positive association with ROA, M/B, and Return at the $1\\%$ $5\\%$ ,and $1\\%$ levels, respectively, using the same regression specification shown in Panel A of Table 2, and estimating the model over our VC-backed and non-VC-backed IPO samples. We conclude that mitigating the effects of outliers by winsorizing the firm performance measures does not qualitatively change the association of VC reputation with these performance measures.  \n\nSecond, for a small number of VC-IPO matches in the Global New Issues database, we find that Venture Economics lists the 1st-round VC investment as an open market purchase made after the IPO date, and IPO prospectuses do not list them as VC investors. This occurs in 33 IPOs backed by Pilgrim Baxter and in 17 IPOs backed by Integrated Capital Partners. We found no other cases after carefully checking the remaining 25 top-ranked VC investors. To check the robustness of our results, we drop all 50 of these questionable VC-IPO matches. In all these cases, other VCs (often other well-known names, especially in the case of Pilgrim Baxter) are coinvestors in these IPO firms. Thus, it is not surprising that the lead VC's IPO Market Share changes only occasionally after this adjustment, and it continues to have significant positive associations with all 4 primary measures of issuer long-run performance.  \n\nThird, examining post-IPO performance is possible only when there are successful IPOs in the first place. Thus, we examine the association of a VC's reputation with the probability of future IPOs and find that IPO Market Share has a significant positive association with it. For each year in our sample period, we match IPO Market Share with a VC's Future IPO Frequency, defined as the number of completed IPOs by portfolio firms that a VC backs in the following 3 years, scaled by the average number of active portfolio companies the VC is funding at the beginning of the each of these 3 years. We regress Future IPO Frequency on IPO Market Share using a 2-boundary Tobit regression specification controlling for year and industry fixed effects, and we find a significant positive association (at the $1\\%$ significance level). This result is consistent with the findings by Nahata (2008), who uses a related reputation measure that is based on a VC's entire history of IPO successes.16  \n\n### C. Alternative VC Reputation Measures  \n\nWe reestimate the regression model in Panel A of Table 2 after replacing IPO Market Share with our alternative VC reputation measures, one by one, where we again focus on the lead VC. In untabulated results, we find that i) IPO Frequency is significantly and positively associated with Return at the $5\\%$ significance level, with ROA and M/B at the $10\\%$ significance level, and is not significantly related to Survival; i) VC Age is significantly and positively associated with Survival at the $1\\%$ significance level, with M/B and Return at the $5\\%$ significance level, and is not significantly related to ROA; i) VC Capital is significantly and positively associated with ROA and Return at the $5\\%$ significance level, and is not significantly related to M/B and Survival; and iv) Cumulative IPO Market Share is significantly and positively associated with Survival and Return at the $5\\%$ significance level, with ROA at the $10\\%$ significance level, and is not significantly related to M/B. Thus, unlike our primary reputation measure (IPO Market Share), none of these alternative VC reputation measures is consistently associated with all 4 measures of issuer long-run performance. In comparison, our primary VC reputation measure, IPO Market Share, is positively associated with ROA and Return, and with M/B and Survival at the $1\\%$ and $5\\%$ significance levels, respectively.  \n\nD. VC Reputation and Other Issuer Long-Run Performance Measures  \n\nAs further evidence on the relation between our lead VC reputation measure, IPO Market Share, and issuer long-run performance, we examine 4 less conventional measures of issuer long-run performance, namely 2 forward-looking proxies for issuer long-term growth as well as the probability of subsequent acquisitions of IPO firms and expected takeover premia.  \n\nThe 2 forward-looking ratios we examine are: i) R&D/Capex and ii) $(\\mathrm{R}\\&\\mathrm{D}+$ Capex) /Total Assets (see Gompers (1995), Loughran and Ritter (1997), averaged over the 3 fiscal years following the IPO month. Gompers (1995) argues that the 2 ratios capture the expected growth rate in firm asset value due to its investment in R&D and capital expenditures. The data are taken from the Compustat annual financial statement database. We have R&D expense and capital expenditure ratios for 560 VC-backed IPOs and 837 non-VC-backed IPOs completed in the 1996-2002 period.  \n\nEach growth measure is regressed against IPO Market Share and the control variables used in Panel A of Table 2. Tobit regressions are used, given that the 2 dependent variables are censored at 0. Panel A of Table 3 reports coefficient estimates and $t$ -statistics based on standard errors robust to heteroskedasticity and adjusted for industry clustering. We find that IPO Market Share has a significant positive association at the $1\\%$ level with both growth ratios, R&D/Capex and $\\left(\\mathrm{R}\\&\\mathrm{D}+\\mathrm{Capex}\\right)$ /Total Assets. This evidence that firms backed by more reputable VCs have higher post-IPO growth rates is consistent with our interpretation of the positive association of VC reputation with post-IPO abnormal stock returns reported in Table 2.17  \n\nAcquisitions (trade sales) of VC-backed firms provide another profitable exit opportunity for VCs, and they represent another measure of the long-term success of a VC's advice, monitoring, and support of its portfolio firms (see Dai, Anderson, and Bittlingmayer (2006)). Prior studies consider acquisitions of portfolio firms at attractive prices/premia as evidence of venture investment success (see, e.g., Gompers and Lerner (2000)). We collect data on acquisitions of share blocksof $5\\%$ or more in VC-backed IPO issuers within 3 years of the IPO month from the SDC Mergers and Acquisitions database. We exclude acquisitions withdrawn or missing a definite completion date. Target takeover premia data are also from this database and are defined as the ratio of target share purchase price divided by its closing stock price 1 day (or alternatively, 1 week, or 4 weeks) prior to the offer announcement. In our sample, there are 134 acquisitions of large blocks of shares of 105 separate VC-backed IPO issuers over the 3-year post-IPO period, for which data on variables needed for our analysis are available.18  \n\nIn Panel B of Table 3 we estimate the relation between IPO Market Share and the probability of a completed acquisition. The dependent variable, Completed Acquisition, is an indicator variable for acquisition of a share block of a firm backed by a particular VC in the 3-year post-IPO period.

The regression specification is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{\\mathrm{Takeover~Premium}}}&{{=}}&{{\\beta_{I}+\\beta_{1}\\mathrm{IPO~Market~Share}+\\beta_{2}\\mathrm{Ln~Asset}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{+\\beta_{3}\\mathrm{Ln~Deal~Size}+\\beta_{4}\\mathrm{Shares~Acquired}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{+\\beta_{5}\\mathrm{Cash}+\\beta_{6}\\mathrm{Multiple~Bidders}+\\varepsilon.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nDeal-related control variables include i) Ln Deal Size, the natural log of a transaction's dollar value; i) Shares Acquired, the target share block purchased; ii) Cash, an indicator variable for pure cash deals; and iv) Multiple Bidders, an indicator variable for deals with multiple bidders (see Stulz, Walkling, and Song (1990), Moeller et al. (2004)).  \n\nPanel C of Table 3 shows that IPO Market Share has a significant positive relation to the size of the expected acquisition premium. Moreover, differences in takeover defenses do not explain higher takeover premia in targets backed by more reputable VCs because i) the frequencies of staggered boards (a powerful antitakeover provision) in firms backed by more and less reputable VCs are not significantly different, as reported later; and i) firms backed by more reputable VCs have a significantly higher acquisition frequency, suggesting weaker takeover defenses, rather than stronger defenses. What does appear to explain higher acquisition premia is the higher post-IPO growth potential of firms backed by more reputable VCs reported in Panel A of Table 3.19  \n\nIn untabulated results, we find that IPO Frequency is significantly related to expected growth measures, but not to the acquisition probability or premium. VC Age and Cumulative IPO Market Share are both significantly related to the 2 expected growth measures and to the acquisition probability (weakly, at the $10\\%$ significance level), but not to the acquisition premium. Finally, VC Capital is significantly related to the acquisition probability and its premium, but not to either expected growth measure. In summary, while IPO Market Share has a significant positive relation to all of our other long-run performance measures, none of our alternative VC reputation measures is significantly related to all 4 performance measures.  \n\n## IV. Separating VC Selection from VC Development of Portfolio Firms  \n\nThe relation between VC reputation and post-IPO firm performance measures can be the result of higher-ranked VCs having access to more promising business ventures, as argued by Hsu (2004) and Lee and Wahal (2004), or it can be due to a VC's development efforts, or both. To the extent that the control variables capture aspects of IPO issuer quality, the influence of VC self-selection is reduced, but it may not be completely eliminated.  \n\nTo more completely separate a VC's portfolio firm selection effect from the impact of a VC's value-added activities in the post-IPO period, we implement a standard Heckman (1979) 2-step selection procedure. In the 1st step we estimate a probit model to predict the likelihood of an investment by a highly ranked VC (see Nahata (2008), Juergens and Lindsey (2009)). An inverse Mills ratio for highly ranked VC investors is calculated from the 1st-step regression estimates and is then included as an added explanatory variable in the 2nd-step regression of IPO issuer performance on VC reputation. The inverse Mills ratio captures the probability that more reputable VCs invest in better-quality portfolio firms. To distinguish between the effects of VC selection and VC post-IPO development, we need a set of instrumental variables (IVs) that are significantly related to the lead VC's reputation and unrelated to the IPO firm's long-term performance measures.  \n\nThe IVs we use are drawn from Thomson Financial's Venture Economics and Global New Issues databases, and are defined and motivated as follows:  \n\ni) Ln Asset is the natural logarithm of an issuer's asset size at the IPO, and it is a proxy for more developed, lower growth firms, which is an investment opportunity that VCs find unattractive. Thus, more reputable VCs, who see greater deal fow, can more easily avoid such issuers. We find that firm asset size is significantly related to VC reputation, but is unrelated to issuer long-run performance measures. Indeed, we are unaware of any major empirical study in this area that reports a significant relation between issuer asset size and post-IPO firm performance (see, e.g., Brav and Gompers (1997), Carter et al. (1998)).  \n\nii) VC Syndicate Size, measured by the number of VC investors in the IPO firm, is linked to VC reputation, since more reputable VCs are better able to attract other VCs (Hochberg et al. (2007)). Panel B of Table 2 shows that VC syndicate size is not significantly related to post-IPO issuer performance. One reason for this lack of association is that nonlead VCs are less likely than lead VCs to be involved with portfolio firms well beyond the lock-up period (see, e.g., Field and Hanka (2001), fn. 12).  \n\niii) We define Top Auditor as a big 4 or 5 accounting firm, and Top Law, as a law firm with a $1\\%$ or greater IPO market share, based on data from the SDC Global New Issues database. An IPO issuer's legal advisor and auditor reputations should be positively related to the probability of successful IPOs, since they help reduce the asymmetric information risk of IPO investors by certifying the validity of issuer disclosure documents. Thus, legal advisor and auditor reputations are likely to be positively correlated with VC reputation, which is also positively related to IPO success. Using logit regressions, we find that IPO Market Share is significantly related to Top Law and Top Auditor at the $1\\%$ and $5\\%$ significance levels. However, the reputations of these financial intermediaries do not have a significant incremental effect on post-IPO performance (see, e.g., Michaely and Shaw (1995), Beatty and Welch (1996)). One reason is that law firms and auditors can easily be replaced (e.g., to save on fees) once a firm is publicly listed, and they are only infrequently needed in the early post-IPO years.  \n\niv) Following Helwege and Liang (2004), we define a Hot IPO Market period as those months when the frequency of completed IPOs is abnormally high, and we use the calendar months that they report as hot IPO market periods. More reputable VCs may be better able than other VCs to time IPO exits to periods of strong market conditions, given their greater experience and superior networks of relationships. Such hot-market periods could be concentrated in a few industries where technological innovations or positive productivity shocks occur. On the other hand, hot-market periods might represent periods of high investor optimism and lead to lower VC standards for bringing firms public, resulting in poorer postIPO long-run performance. Empirically, Helwege and Liang find little difference in long-run post-IPO profits or growth between hot-market and cold-market IPOs.  \n\nEmpirically, we also find that the Hot IPO Market indicator is not significantly related to any of our post-IPO issuer performance measures. Nevertheless, in robustness analysis when we exclude this IV, our results remain unchanged.  \n\nv)EarlyStageInvestor is anindicator for anearly stage investment by the IPO issuer's lead VC, and is based on data taken from the Venture Economics database. It captures a VC's strong early interest in a portfolio firm's proprietary technology, products, and market growth potential, which could increase the likelihood of completing an IPO (see, e.g., Elango, Fried, Hisrich, and Polonchek (1995)). Importantly, we find that a VC's early stage entry, per se, does not have a significant effect on post-IPO long-run performance. This may reflect the substantial dilution of VC ownership and control rights at the IPO, which combined with a VC fund's limited life and its expertise in early stage investing reduces its incentives to continue actively monitoring an IPO issuer after it goes public.  \n\nvi) Nearby Firm is an indicator for an IPO firm whose headquarters is located in the same state as that of its lead VC. VCs have strong preferences to limit general partners’ time commitment to a portfolio firm by reducing partner travel time. More reputable VCs should have greater ability to select venture investments located nearby and to require more distant portfolio firms to move nearby. On the other hand, VC ownership and control rights are substantially reduced at the IPO date, when their convertible securities are forced to convert to ordinary common stock, which should substantially weaken VC post-IPO influence over portfolio firm performance.  \n\nConsistent with our economic arguments, when we regress the above IVs, along with VC reputation and the control variables used in Panel A of Table 2 on subsequent issuer long-run performance measures, we find that none of the IVs is significantly related to any of our long-run performance measures. In short, they pass the IV exclusion requirement.  \n\nTurning to the IV validity requirement, we estimate a 1st-step probit model using Reputable VC as the dependent variable. It is defined as an indicator variable for highly ranked lead VCs, and takes a value of 1 for issuers backed by a VC with an IPO Market Share above the median of all VCs, and O otherwise.As is standard, all control variables in the 2nd-step equation are also included in the 1st step, except for the VC Backed indicator, which is highly correlated with the dependent variable in this sample of VC- and non-VC-backed IPOs. As Table 4 reports, each of our 7 IVs is significantly related to the Reputable VC indicator: Ln Asset is negatively related, while VC Syndicate Size, Top Auditor, Top Law, Hot IPO Market, Early Stage Investor, and Nearby Firm are all positively related to Reputable VC. The explanatory power of the 1st-stage models is high, as indicated by pseudo $R^{2}$ statistics closeto $50\\%$ . The Ist-stage inverse Mills ratio is included in the following 2nd-stage regression:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{P}&{=}&{\\beta_{Y}+\\beta_{I}+\\beta_{1}\\mathrm{IPO~Market~Share}+\\beta_{2}\\mathrm{VC~Backed}}\\ &&{+\\beta_{3}\\mathrm{Underwriter~Reputation}+\\beta_{4}\\mathrm{Ln~Offer~Size}}\\ &&{+\\beta_{5}\\mathrm{Ln~Issuer~Age}+\\beta_{6}\\mathrm{Issuer~Market~Cap}+\\beta_{7}\\mathrm{Issuer~M/B}}\\ &&{+\\beta_{8}\\mathrm{Price~Revision}+\\beta_{9}\\mathrm{Underpricing}+\\beta_{10}\\mathrm{Inverse~Mills}+\\varepsilon,}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n# TABLE4 Issuer Long-Run Performance and VC Reputation, Controlling for Issue Traits andSelf-Selection  \n\nTable 4 presents 2-step Heckman (1979)regression coefficients and in parentheses associated t-statistics (or $Z^{.}$ statistics in the case of probit or logit regressions)based on standard errors that are robust to heteroskedasticity and adjusted for industry clustering. In a 1st step, a probit regression is estimated for the likelihood of a firm receiving backing from a more reputableVC,Reputable VC, defined as an indicator that takes a value of 1 when the VC has an IPO Market Share of all VC-backed IPOs above the median, where IPO Market Share is computed as a VC's dollar market share of all venturebacked IPOs in the prior 3 calendar years. The instrumental variables are Ln Asset, VC Syndicate Size,Top Auditor, Top Law, Hot IPO Market, Early Stage Investor, and Nearby Firm. All the variables are defined in Appendix A.

The regressions are estimated over bothVC-backed and non-VC-backed IPOs.IPO Market Share continues to have significant positive associations with all 4 long-run performance measures. The 2nd-step regressions also indicate the importance of VC selectivity, since the inverse Mills ratio is statistically significant in all of the issuer long-term performance regressions. Thus, we conclude that more reputable VCs are associated with superior issuer long-run performance, even after taking into account their selectivity in making venture investments.2o This raises an important question. Why are more reputable VCs associated with better long-term performance? We examine this question in the next section.  \n\n## V. VC Support and Development of Portfolio Firms  \n\nA. VC Reputation and Issuer Corporate Governance  \n\nCan the relation between VC reputation and portfolio firm governance characteristics (including VC shareholdings and board positions) explain superior post-IPO performance of issuers backed by more reputable VC firms? Theoretical studies have suggested that large blockholders can effectively monitor top management (see, e.g., Shleifer and Vishny (1986), Burkart, Gromb, and Panunzi (1997)), and empirical studies such as Cronqvist and Fahlenbrach (2009) find that large blockholders (including private equity investors) significantly improve firm performance. Superior corporate governance structures can also enhance shareholder value (see, e.g., Gompers et al. (2003), Masulis, Wang, and Xie (2007), (2009)).  \n\nWe examine 5 post-IPO issuer governance characteristics using indicator variables for: i) lead VC shareholdings, ii) lead VC directorships, i) CEO-COBs, iv) CEO-Founders, and v) staggered boards, measured at the IPO date, as well as 1, 2, and 3 years thereafter. VC shareholdings and directorships in the post-IPO period continue to motivate and enable VCs to support and infuence the further development of their portfolio firms. Separation of CEO and chairman roles strengthens board independence and increases board oversight of senior management. Similarly, a non-CEO-founder is less likely to be entrenched and, as a result, is subject to greater board oversight. A staggered board is an important antitakeover provision (Bebchuk, Cohen, and Ferrell (2009), which reduces the disciplinary threat of the market for corporate control, thus raising CEOshareholder agency costs.  \n\nIn order to examine governance characteristics in IPO issuers backed by lead VCs of different reputations, we first divide our VCs into quartiles based on our VC reputation measure, IPO Market Share. We then focus on lead VCs in the top and bottom quartiles to assess the associations between VC reputation and the governance characteristics of their portfolio firms. We define VC Shareholdings, VC Directorships, CEO-COB, CEO-Founder, and Staggered Board as indicator variables that equal 1 if the lead VC holds shares in the IPO issuer, if the lead VC holds an issuer board seat, if the issuer's CEO is also the COB, if the issuer's CEO is a founder, and if the issuer has a staggered board, respectively, and O otherwise. These indicator variables are measured at the IPO date, as well as over the 3 years thereafter.  \n\nPanel A of Table 5 reports the proportion of IPO issuers (reported as percentages) having each of 5 governance characteristics at the IPO date and the 3 years thereafter for firms with lead VCs in the top and bottom reputation quartiles. The 2nd part of Panel A, for example, gives the proportion of IPO issuers backed by VCs in the highest reputation quartile versus the lowest quartile, in which VCs hold board seats at the IPO, and continue to do so over the next 3 years. The 1st row of the 2nd part shows that VCs in the highest reputation quartile hold directorships in $96\\%$ of issuers they back at the IPO date, which is significantly different from VCs in the lowest reputation quartile that hold directorships in only $83\\%$ of IPO issuers they back. In the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd years after the IPO, VCs in the highest reputation quartile hold a significantly higher proportion of directorships in firms they back relative to VCs in the lowest reputation quartile. It is noteworthy that VCs in the lowest reputation quartile hold shares and directorships in less than $100\\%$ of issuers they back at the IPO date, which implies that the least reputable VCs had invested early on, but in some cases sold out prior to the IPO.  \n\nIn summary, Panel A of Table 5 shows that more reputable VCs hold shares and directorships in a significantly higher proportion of the issuers they back, not only at the IPO date, but also over the following 3 years. More reputable VCs are also associated with significantly lower proportions of firms with CEO-Founders and CEO-COBs at the IPO, and over the next 3 years.21  \n\nWhile suggestive, the above univariate analysis does not control for differences in issuer characteristics or for VC selectivity. To address these concerns, Panel B of Table 5 examines the relations between VC reputation and the governance characteristics of portfolio firms in a multivariate regression setting, where we control for differences in issuer characteristics and for VC selectivity.  \n\nWe again estimate a standard Heckman (1979) 2-step selection procedure. In the Ist step, we estimate a probit model to predict the likelihood of an investment by a higher-ranked VC investor. In the 1st-stage equation, we employ Ln  \n\n# TABLE5 IPO Firm Governance Characteristics and VC Reputation  \n\nPanel A of Table 5 reports the proportion of IPO issuers $(\\mathrm{in}\\%)$ with each of 5governancecharacteristics for leadVCs in the top and bottom reputation quartiles (where IPO Market Share is computed as its dollar market share of all venturebackedIPOs in thepreceding 3 calendaryears).The 5 governance characteristics are i) lead VC block-holdings,ii) lead VC directorships, i) CEOs also hold board chairmanship (COB), iv) CEOs who are also founders, and v) staggered boards.Indicator variables are used to indicate the presence of each of these governance characteristics.We track these 5 governance characteristics at the IPO date and 1,2,and 3 years after the IPO. Corporate governance data are available for 813 VC-backed issuers at the IPO date, and 783, 690, and 590 VC-backed IPO issuers respectively for the 3 years thereafter a,b, and ° denote significantly diferent from the other cohort at the $10\\%$ $5\\%$ and $1\\%$ levels,respectively. Panel B presents 2-step Heckman (1979) regression coefficients and in parentheses associated t-statistics (or $Z$ statistics in the case of probit or logit regressions) based on standard errors that are robust to heteroskedasticity and adjusted for industry clustering. In a 1st step, a probit regression is estimated for the likelihood of observing a firm backed by a more reputable VC, based on IPO Market Share being above the median IPO Market Share in VC-backed deals.

The 2nd stage relates post-IPO corporate governance characteristics to VC reputation. The dependent variables are indicator variables for issuer governance characteristics, while VC reputation is the covariate. The other control variables are the same as in Panel A of Table 2.  \n\nTo meet the exclusion requirement, an IV needs to be unrelated to the issuer governance measures examined in the 2nd-step equations. We address this question both economically and statistically. Economically, there is no obvious reason for issuer asset size, measured by Ln Asset, to be related to post-IPO issuer corporate governance measures. While larger firms may have smaller insider shareholdings, they are also likely to have larger institutional investor shareholdings (see Cronqvist and Fahlenbrach (2009)). Thus, VC percentage shareholdings are not necessarily larger, even if VC dollar investment is larger, which is to be expected in larger portfolio firms.  \n\nAt the IPO, more reputable lawyers and auditors are primarily concerned with meeting security regulations and disclosure requirements, rather than improving post-IPO issuer governance characteristics. Likewise, VC Syndicate Size is not directly linked to more VC shareholdings or directorships. An indirect link is possible because larger syndicates are associated with more reputable VCs, who are more likely to remain shareholders and directors in the post-IPO period as indicated in Panel A of Table 5, but this does not violate the exclusion requirement since it is directly related to VC reputation. Hot IPO Market has no obvious reason to be correlated to our issuer corporate governance characteristics. It could be argued that it is easier for poorly governed firms to go public in hot markets, but more well-governed firms are also more likely to go public then. Likewise, Early Stage Investor and Nearby Firm are related to which VCs invest in a portfolio firm, but appear unrelated to a firm's post-IPO governance characteristics. For example, more reputable VCs are more likely to invest in local deals, so they can be positively correlated with Nearby Firm. More reputable VCs could also push for better governance, though their closer monitoring could substitute for other governance measures.  \n\nStatistically, we find that when we regress the IVs, along with VC reputation and the control variables from Panel A of Table 2 on the post-IPO corporate governance measures, none of the IVs is significantly related to any of the internal governance measures, though in the 1st-stage equation they are significantly related to our VC reputation measure, IPO Market Share. The 2nd-step equation we estimate is specified below:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{G}&{=}&{\\beta_{Y}+\\beta_{I}+\\beta_{1}\\mathrm{IPO~Market~Share}+\\beta_{2}\\mathrm{VC~Backed}}\\ &&{\\indent}&{\\indent+\\beta_{3}\\mathrm{Underwriter~Reputation}+\\beta_{4}\\mathrm{Ln~Offer~Size}}\\ &&{\\indent}&{\\indent+\\beta_{5}\\mathrm{Ln~Issuer~Age}+\\beta_{6}\\mathrm{Issuer~Market~Cap}+\\beta_{7}\\mathrm{Issuer~M/B}}\\ &&{\\indent}&{\\indent+\\beta_{8}\\mathrm{Price~Revision}+\\beta_{9}\\mathrm{Underpricing}+\\beta_{10}\\mathrm{Inverse~Mills}+\\varepsilon,}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $G$ represents 1 of the issuer's 5 corporate governance characteristics at the IPO date or 1 of the 3 years thereafter. Panel B of Table 5 reports regression estimates for the 2nd-step equation, while the 1st-stage results are presented in Section IV. Regressions are estimated for 813, 783, 690, and 590 VC-backed firms where the requisite corporate governance data are available at the IPO date and the following 3 years, respectively. Only VC reputation coefficients are reported to conserve space, although we discuss significant control variables below.  \n\nThe 1Ist and 2nd parts of Panel B in Table 5 shows that VC reputation has significant positive associations with VC shareholdings and directorships at the IPO and in each of the following 3 years. That is to say, the probability of retaining equity investments and board seats in the IPO issuers they back is significantly higher for more reputable VCs than for other lower-ranked VCs. Thus, more reputable VCs tend to have stronger incentives to monitor CEO performance and they have significant influence over their portfolio companies in this post-IPO period.  \n\nThe 3rd and 4th parts of Panel B in Table 5 show that VC reputation has (weak) significant negative associations with the probability of an issuer having a dual CEO-COB and CEO-Founder, but only at the IPO date. The 5th part shows that VC reputation is not significantly associated with the likelihood of firms having staggered boards at the IPO dates or thereafter, consistent with the finding of Field and Karpoff (2002).  \n\nExamining the control variables in these untabulated results, we find that Underpricing has a significant positive association with a VC's post-IPO shareholdings and directorships. This finding indicates that VCs tend to continue to be shareholders and board members in firms experiencing high IPO initial returns. Issuer Market Cap has a significant negative association with post-IPO VC shareholdings, indicating that VC shareholdings are more diluted in better capitalized firms. Underwriter Reputation has a significant positive association with VC directorships, reinforcing the VC networking effect: More reputable lead underwriters are associated with IPOs in which VCs continue to hold board seats (which Panel A of Table 5 indicates are more frequently highly reputable VCs).  \n\nSince the only governance mechanisms that VC reputation is significantly related to at the IPO date and the 3 years thereafter are VC shareholdings and directorships, we conclude that a VC's continued participation in its portfolio firms after they go public is the only significant difference in corporate governance between firms backed by more and less reputable VCs. This is also the conclusion from Panel A of Table 5. Therefore, in the next section we focus on these 2 governance features as we further analyze the importance of post-IPO VC involvement in their portfolio firms in explaining long-term performance differences among firms backed by more and less reputable VCs.  \n\n### B. VC Involvement and Long-Run Issuer Performance  \n\nWe first classify firms on whether they are backed by VCs with higher reputations (IPO Market Share greater than $0.50\\%)^{22}$ and then on whether they continue to hold shares over the following 3 years. In untabulated results, we compare firms with and without continued VC involvement in the 3 post-IPO years, and conclude from a difference in means $t$ -test that ROA, M/B, Survival, and Return are all significantly greater for firms backed by more reputable VCs at the $1\\%$ $5\\%$ $1\\%$ and $5\\%$ significance levels, respectively. In contrast, when more reputable VCs liquidate their share holdings within 3 years of the IPO, there are smaller differences in long-run performance metrics between firms backed by VCs with higher reputations versus other lead VCs: A difference in means $t\\cdot$ test shows that long-run performance measures of firms backed by more reputable VCs are only significantly greater at the $10\\%$ level for ROA, Survival, and Return, while M/B is not significantly different relative to those backed by other lead VCs. This evidence suggests that continued VC monitoring and support in the post-IPO period, which is provided by more reputable VCs, is one credible reason for their portfolio firms to exhibit superior post-IPO performance.  \n\nAnalyzing the associations between continued post-IPO involvement in portfolio firms (in terms of VC shareholdings and directorships) by more reputable VCs and measures of long-term performance can be complicated by a VC's unobserved investment criteria for continued involvement in its publicly listed portfolio firms. Thus, we examine the relation between a VC's post-IPO involvement in a portfolio firm and the firm's long-run performance measures, after controlling for endogeneity of VC involvement, using IV LIML estimation as described later.  \n\nThe 1st equation examines the likelihood 3 years after an IPO of continued VC shareholdings or alternatively directorships. The set of explanatory variables in the 1st equation includes IVs and the other control variables used in Panel A of Table 2, with the exception of the VC Backed indicator, which is highly correlated with the dependent variable.  \n\nTo control for endogeneity of a VC's long-term shareholdings and directorships, we use the following IVs: i) VC Fund Age measured from a VC fund's date of incorporation to the IPO date, which is meant to capture the pressure on a VC to liquidate its investments; i) a VC's other board of director commitments, Directorship Commitments, to capture the pressure faced by VCs to relinquish some of their directorships; i) a VC's average post-IPO shareholding period, based on its prior experience, VC Avg Shareholding Period which is meant to capture a VC's typical post-IPO investment pattern; and iv) a VC's average post-IPO directorship period based on its prior experience, VC Avg Directorship Period, which is meant to capture a VC's typical post-IPO directorship duration. The last 2 variables are based on data between 1992 and the IPO year. These data are hand collected from IPO prospectuses and proxy statements, and taken from the Venture Economics database.  \n\nTo be valid, IVs must be significantly related to the likelihood of a VC having long-term post-IPO shareholdings and directorships, while being economically unrelated to an issuer's long-run performance measures. The economic justifications for why each of the IVs meets the latter exclusion requirement follow. While VC Fund Age captures the fact that older funds face stronger pressure to liquidate their investments, which encourages more rapid sales of their shares once a portfolio firm goes public, this fund characteristic is unrelated to VC firm characteristics and does not appear to have a direct relationship to issuer long-run performance. A VC's Directorship Commitments in other firms has no direct bearing on an issuer's long-term performance, except through its correlation with VC reputation and the VC's direct monitoring of the IPO issuer.  \n\nFinally, the average duration of a VC's shareholdings and directorships is based on prior VC activity in other portfolio firms and as such captures VC policies that are exogenous to a subsequent IPO issuer long-run performance. Indeed, when we regress these IVs, along with VC reputation and the control variables from Panel A of Table 2, on subsequent issuer long-run performance measures, we find that none of the IVs is significantly related to any of the long-run performance measures.  \n\nThe 2nd equation in the IV LIML model examines the relations between the 4 long-run performance measures, ROA, M/B, Survival, or Return, denoted by $P$ , with VC corporate governance activity in the portfolio firm, where the same control variables are included as before. The statistical model is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{P}&{=}&{\\beta_{Y}+\\beta_{I}+\\beta_{1}\\mathrm{VC~Shareholdings/VC~Directorships}}\\ &&{+\\beta_{2}\\mathrm{VC~Backed}+\\beta_{3}\\mathrm{Underwriter~Reputation}+\\beta_{4}\\mathrm{Ln~Offer~Sign}}\\ &{+\\beta_{5}\\mathrm{Ln~Issuer~Age}+\\beta_{6}\\mathrm{Issuer~Market~Cap}+\\beta_{7}\\mathrm{Issuer~M/B}}\\ &{+\\beta_{8}\\mathrm{Price~Revision}+\\beta_{9}\\mathrm{Underpricing}+\\varepsilon,}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere VC Shareholdings, or alternatively, VC Directorships, is the endogenous explanatory indicator variable for a VC's governance activity in the portfolio firm 3 years after the IPO. Given their high correlation ( $79\\%$ $75\\%$ $72\\%$ ,and $71\\%$ respectively, at the IPO and in the next 3 years), we analyze the effects of VC Shareholdings and VC Directorships in separate regressions. However, a high correlation also means that these 2 sets of results cannot be viewed as strictly independent pieces of evidence. Regressions of ROA, M/B, Survival, and Return are, respectively, estimated for 1,941, 1,941, 2,019, and 2,019 observations representing VC-backed and non-VC-backed IPOs completed in the 1996-2002 period.  \n\nPanels A and B of Table 6 report 1st- and 2nd-step regression estimates and associated $t\\cdot$ -statistics (or z-statistics) based on standard errors robust to heteroskedasticity and adjusted for industry clustering. The 1st-step regressions are consistent with our prior findings and show that Ln VC Fund Age and Directorship Commitments have significant negative relations and VC Avg Shareholding Period and VC Avg Directorship Period have significant positive relations to VC shareholdings and directorships 3 years after the IPO.  \n\nThe 2nd-step regressions show that the indicator variables, VC Shareholdings and VC Directorships, have significant positive associations with all 4 measures of issuer long-run performance. As an alternative approach, we assess the effects of continued VC shareholdings using a continuous variable, rather than the VC Shareholdings indicator variable. For this purpose, we use an IV LIML model, in which the 2nd equation is the same as equation (5) except that VC Percentage Shareholding is now the covariate. Table B1 in Appendix B shows that a VC's percentage shareholdings is significantly related to ROA, M/B, and Survival at a $10\\%$ significance level, while it is not significantly related to Return. Thus, the fact that more reputable VCs continue to be shareholders in the postIPO period appears to improve issuer performance more than the size of their shareholdings.23 In summary, this section presents further evidence that continued post-IPO involvement of more reputable VCs in portfolio firms leads to stronger firm performance.  \n\n# TABLE6 Issuer Long-Run Performance Measures and VC Governance Activity, Controlling for Endogeneity  \n\nPanels A and B of Table 6report coefficients from IV LiML estimation and in parentheses associated t-statistics (or Zstatisticsin the case of logit regression)based on standard errors that arerobust to heteroskedasticity and adjusted for industry clustering. The 1st equation models the likelihood of VC Shareholdings or, alternatively, of vC Directorships 3 years after the IPO. The IVs are Ln VC Fund Age, Directorship Commitments, VC Avg Shareholding Period, and VC Avg Directorship Period.

Conclusion  \n\nWe study venture capital (VC) investors, who operate in a fragmented industry where even the largest VC firms have small market shares. We investigate the usefulness of distinguishing VCs by reputation by examining whether more reputable VCs have differential effects on post-IPO performance of their portfolio firms, and if so, how. Because younger VCs can have incentives to grandstand by bringing weaker IPOs to market too early, it is important for investors to assess how well these portfolio firms perform in the long run after their IPOs. Such post-IPO performance is not only important to IPO investors and VC fund investors, but also to entrepreneurs considering future relationships with these VC investors.  \n\nOf the various VC reputation measures that we investigate, we find that a VC's past market share of VC-backed IPOs, termed IPO Market Share, consistently exhibits a significant positive relation with all the issuer long-run performance measures we investigate, even after controlling for VC backing, issue characteristics, and underwriter reputation. It is noteworthy that Nahata's (2008) results and our results are complementary in that a VC reputation measure based on past IPO market share is strongly related to both pre- and post-IPO performance of portfolio firms. Consistent with Sorensen's (2007) conclusions using a very different methodology, we conclude that more reputable VCs select stronger portfolio firms. However, after controlling for VC selectivity, we find that more reputable VCs continue to have significant positive associations with a number of post-IPO long-run performance measures. We interpret this evidence as indicating that continued post-IPO support and development of portfolio firms by more reputable VCs positively affects their long-term performance. The key question then is how this occurs.  \n\nExamining VC corporate governance activities in newly public firms, we find that more reputable VCs have a higher probability of retaining their shares and board seats for up to 3 years after an IPO. Moreover, continued VC shareholdings and directorships have significant positive associations with issuer long-run performance measures. These relations continue to hold after controlling for endogeneity of VC shareholdings and VC directorships in the 3-year post-IPO period. In sum, we find a persuasive body of evidence that more reputable VCs exhibit superior venture investment selectivity and provide stronger long-run post-IPO support for portfolio firms, especially in terms of their continued involvement through shareholdings and board directorships, which leads to superior long-term firm performance.  \n\n## Appendix A. Definitions of Key Variables  \n\n### 1. IPO Long-Run Performance Measures  \n\nROA. The match-adjusted return on assets (defined as net income divided by book value of total assets). The industry match-adjustment process is described below. First, each IPO issuer in our sample is matched to a sample of nonequity issuers (in the 3 years before and after the IPO date) based on the issuer's industry, which is measured by its 4-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code if there are at least 5 other firms in the industry, or else it is based on its 3-digit (or 2-digit) SIC code so that we can obtain at least 5 nonissuing firms. Then, the median ROA of the matched sample of nonissuers is subtracted from the ROA of the IPO firm. ROA is winsorized at the $1\\%$ and $99\\%$ levels to minimize the effects of outliers that can be induced by data errors.  \n\nM/B. The market-to-book equity ratio (M/B), which often is used to value a firm's real options and is a proxy for Tobin's Q. The M/B ratio is measured at the end of the $12\\mathrm{th}$ quarter following the IPO. To avoid inducing survivorship bias into our measures of long-run performance, we use the $n$ -quarter $(n<12$ )ROA and M/B figures for IPO issuers that do not survive 3 calendar years beyond the IPO date, where $n$ is the maximum number of quarters for which data are available in Compustat. M/B is winsorized at the $1\\%$ and $99\\%$ levels to minimize the effects of outliers that can be induced by data errors.  \n\nSurvival. An indicator variable that takes a value of 1 for firms that remain listed on the NYSE, AMEX, or NASDAQ (i.e., remain in the CRSP database) for 3 years following their IPOs or that are merged or acquired by listed firms (which themselves remain listed for the remainder of the 3 calendar years following the IPO dates), and O otherwise (firms that become bankrupt, defunct, or are liquidated).  \n\nReturn. An issuer's factor-adjusted abnormal stock return (Return) measured over the 36 months after the issue month. The factors used to adjust returns are the 3 Fama and French (1992) factors and the Carhart (1997) momentum factor. To avoid inducing survivorship bias, we compute long-run stock returns for IPO firms using monthly returns for the 36-month post-IPO period or until delisting, whichever comes first. Return is winsorized at the $1\\%$ and $99\\%$ levels to limit the effects of outliers on our results.  \n\nR&D/Capex. The ratio of research and development expenditures (R&D) to capital expenditures (Capex) averaged over the 3 fiscal years following the IPO month, computed using the Compustat annual financial statement database.  \n\n(R&D + Capex)/Total Assets.

VC Reputation Measures  \n\nSources: Thomson Financial's Venture Economics and Global New Issues databases.  \n\nIPO Market Share. A VC's dollar market share of all venture-backed IPOs in the preceding 3 calendar years. For instance, to analyze the long-run performance of an IPO completed in 1996, the dollar value of all IPOs backed by a VC during years 1993, 1994, and 1995 is aggregated as a proportion of the total dollar size of all venture-backed IPOs in the same 3-year period. The dollar size of an IPO is defined as its gross proceeds, exclusive of overallotment options. Each VC investor is given full credit for a completedIPOthat it backs.  \n\nReputable VC. An indicator variable for highly ranked lead VCs, and takes a value of 1 for issuers backed by a VC with an IPO Market Share above the median of all VCs, andOotherwise.  \n\nIPO Frequency.

The age of a VC as measured by the period between the IPO date and the VC firm's incorporation date, or January 1, 1980 if the incorporation date is earlier.  \n\nVC Capital. A VC's capital under management, measured by total dollars invested or available for investment, based on capital commitments of limited partners as at the pre-IPO-year end.  \n\nCumulative IPO Market Share. The dollar market share of IPOs that a VC backed between 1993 and the year prior to the IPO.  \n\n### 3.

This data is taken from Jay Ritter's Web site (http://bear. warrington.ufl.edu/ritter/ ipodata.htm).  \n\nUnderwriter Reputation. The lead underwriter reputation score measured by the CarterManaster score, as modified by Ritter and made available on his Web site (http:/bear .cba.ufl.edu/ritter/rank.xls).  \n\nIssuer Market Cap. The implied market capitalization of the IPO issuer obtained by multiplying offer price by the total number of post-IPO shares (including those retainedbyowner).  \n\nIssuer M/B. The market-to-book (M/B) ratio of the IPO issuer as at time of the IPO, computed following Brav and Gompers (1997).  \n\nPrice Revision. The percentage increase in final IPO offer price from the midpoint of the high and low prices in the initial fling.  \n\nUnderpricing. The 1st-day raw stock return for IPO issuers.  \n\n$\\beta_{Y}$ .A vector of year fixed effects.  \n\n$\\beta_{I}$ . A vector of indicator variables for 8 industry groups capturing industry fixed effects. The industry groups are i) Internet and computers, i) communications and electronics, ii) business and industrial, iv) consumer products, v) energy, vi) biotech and healthcare, vii) financial services, and vii) business services.  \n\n### 4. Corporate Governance Variables  \n\nSources: Prospectuses, proxy statements, and annual reports after May 1996 come from SEC's Edgar Web site (http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml). Prospectuses, proxy statements and annual reports prior to May 1996 come from Thomson Financial's Disclosure database.  \n\nVC Shareholdings. An indicator variable equal to 1 if the lead VC has shareholdings in the IPO issuer in the IPO year, or 1, 2, and 3 years after the IPO.  \n\nVC Percentage Shareholding. The lead VC's percentage shareholdings in the IPO issuer 3 years after theIPO.  \n\nVC Directorships. An indicator variable equal to 1 if the lead VC has directors on the board of the IPO issuer in the IPO year, or 1, 2, and 3 years after the IPO.  \n\nCEO-COB.

    "reference_markdown": "# How “Maximizing Shareholder Value” Minimized the Strategic National Stockpile: The \\$5.3 Trillion Question for Pandemic Preparedness Raised by the Ventilator Fiasco \\*  \n\nWilliam Lazonick and Matt Hopkins  \n\nWorking Paper No. 127  \n\nJuly 21st, 2020  \n\n# ABSTRACT  \n\nWith just 4.2 percent of the world's population, the United States had, as of July 21, 2020, 26.0 percent of its confirmed Covid-19 cases and 23.1 percent of its deaths. The magnitude of the tragedy raises the critically important counterfactual question of how the United States as a nation would have fared had there been competent and committed political leadership in place when, during January 2020, intelligence indicating the severity of the unfolding pandemic became available. A partial answer to this question lies in identifying the organizational and technological capabilities to develop, produce, and deliver “countermeasures\"—personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilators, diagnostic tests, therapies, and vaccines -— that a prepared federal administration would have been able to mobilize to respond to the pandemic. Main repositories of the necessary capabilities are government agencies and business firms, with the development, production, and delivery of countermeasures heavily reliant on government-business collaborations (GBCs). We contend that the success of projects for pandemic preparedness and response depends on the strength of GBCs.  \n\nIn this essay, we focus on the particular case of ventilators for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). We trace the historical evolution within the federal government of the current system of pandemic preparedness for and response through the end of the Obama administration. We then analyze the particular GBCs to develop ventilators for the SNS initiated and implemented by the Biomedical Research and Development Authority (BARDA), under the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). BARDA initiated two successive GBCs, one beginning in 2010 and the second in 2014, with two different business firms, for the purpose of developing portable, easy-to-use, and affordable ventilators for the SNS. We show that the strength of these collaborations lay with the innovative ventilator manufacturers with which BARDA contracted. The weakness of these GBCs appeared when these innovative manufacturers fell under the control of business corporations committed to the ideology of “maximizing shareholder value\" (MSV). In each case, the financialized business corporation undermined development and delivery of ventilators to the SNS.  \n\nWe then explain why, in general, we should expect that business firms driven by MSV will be unreliable partners in GBCs -—at the expense of the nation's preparedness for and response to an emergency such as the Covid-19 pandemic. This lack of reliability is rooted in the strategic orientation of corporations which have put stock-market valuation of the company ahead of its innovative performance in producing goods and services. The Covid-19 crisis has already revealed the extent to which, in the U.S. economy, the stock market functions not to support value creation but rather as the prime means of value extraction. The most overt form of value extraction is the corporate practice of open-market repurchases of the company's own shares—aka stock buybacks —-typically done in addition to copious distributions to shareholders in the form of cash dividends. In the decade 2010-2019, companies in the S&P 500 Index spent $\\$5.3$ trillion Oon buybacks, representing 54 percent of net income, in addition to $\\$3.8$ trillion (39 percent of net income) distributed to shareholders as dividends.  \n\nIn view of this “predatory value extraction, we conclude this essay with the “ $\\$5.3$ trillion' question for executives and directors of corporations who, in their embrace of MSV ideology, must bear significant responsibility for the failure of the United States to respond to not only the Covid-19 pandemic but also climate change and income inequity. The question: Why does the company that you head do stock buybacks? In particular, we direct this question to the executives and directors of three corporations that, as of the year 2020, are the biggest repurchasers of their own stock in history: Microsoft at number three, ExxonMobil at number two, and Apple at number one. We also pose this question to the senior executives and board members of any company engaged in the practice who, in August 2019, signed the Business Roundtable (BRT) Statement of the Purpose of a Corporation, which explicitly rejected the BRT's 1997 pronouncement that “corporations exist principally to serve shareholders ,”’ replacing it with a redefinition of “the purpose of the corporation to promote ^an economy that serves all Americans'.?\"  \n\nhttps://doi.0rg/10.36687/inetwp127  \n\nJEL Codes: D2, D7,G3, H1, H4, H5,L2,L6, O3  \n\nKeywords: pandemic preparedness, government-business collaborations, Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), Biomedical Research and Development Authority (BARDA), ventilators, innovative enterprise, maximizing shareholder value, stock buybacks, predatory value extraction, Microsoft, ExxonMobil, Apple, Business Roundtable.  \n\nLazonick and Hopkins  \n\n## 1. Government-business collaborations for pandemic countermeasures  \n\nThe coronavirus pandemic caught most Americans by surprise. Until it happened, even the generally well-informed among us could not imagine a pathogen that is so contagious, so deadly, and so lacking in medical remedy that a necessary condition for bringing it under control would be physical distancing -undertaken as quickly and completely as possible, and with no clear end in sight. For the more privileged in society who can continue to receive paychecks while working in the safety of their own homes, it has been much easier to abide by the latest scientific and medical expertise. All too many others who must show up at their physical workplaces to earn a living, who are confined to nursing homes, who are incarcerated, or who are homeless or living in crowded, unsanitary conditions face the ravages of the pandemic on a daily basis.  \n\nWith just 4.2 percent of the world's population, the United States had, as of July 21, 2020 26.0 percent of its confirmed Covid-19 cases and 23.1 percent of its deaths.1 Moreover, as of this date, the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic rages on in the United States. The magnitude of the tragedy raises the critically important counterfactual question of how the United States as a nation would have fared had there been competent and committed political leadership in place when, during January 2020, intelligence indicating the severity of the unfolding pandemic became available.  \n\nA partial answer to this question lies in identifying the organizational and technological capabilities to develop, produce, and deliver “countermeasures\"—-personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilators, diagnostic tests, therapies, and vaccines—that competent and committed leadership would have sought to mobilize to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic. Main repositories of the necessary capabilities are government agencies and business firms, with the development, production, and delivery of  countermeasures relying heavily on  government-business collaborations (GBCs).2 We contend that the success of projects for public-health preparedness and response depends on the strength of GBCs.  \n\nIn this essay, which is the first in a series that our research organization, the Academic-Industry Research Network, plans to publish on the Covid-19 crisis over the coming months, we focus on the particular case of provisioning the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) with innovative ventilators —arguably the most manageable of all the complicated countermeasures. In the next section, we trace the historical evolution within the U.S. federal government of the current system of pandemic preparedness and response through the end of the Obama administration. Then, we analyze the particular GBCs to develop ventilators for the SNS that were initiated and implemented by the Biomedical Research and Development Authority (BARDA), under the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). BARDA initiated two successive GBCs, one beginning in 2010 and the second in 2014,  \n\nLazonick and Hopkins  \n\nwith two different business firms, for the purpose of developing portable, easy-to-use, and affordable ventilators for the SNS. We show that the strength of these collaborations lay with the innovative ventilator manufacturers with which BARDA contracted. The weakness of these GBCs appeared when these innovative manufacturers fell under the control of business corporations committed to the ideology of “maximizing shareholder value” (MsV). In each case, the financialized business corporation undermined development and delivery of ventilators to the SNS.  \n\nWe then explain why, in general, we should expect that business firms driven by MSV will be unreliable partners in GBCs —-at the expense of the nation's preparedness for and response to an emergency such as the Covid-19 pandemic. This lack of reliability is rooted in the strategic orientation of those U.S. business corporations which have put the stock market valuation of the company ahead of its innovative performance in producing goods and services. The Covid-19 crisis has already revealed the extent to which, in the U.S. economy, the stock market functions not to support value creation but rather as the prime means of value extraction. The most overt form of value extraction is the corporate practice of open-market repurchases of the company's own  shares—aka  stock buybacks—typically done in  addition to copious distributions  to shareholders in the form of cash dividends. In the decade 2010-2019, companies in the S&P 500 Index spent $\\$5.3$ trillion on buybacks, representing 54 percent of net income, in addition to $\\$3.8$ trillion (39 percent of net income) distributed to shareholders as dividends.3  \n\nIn view of this “predatory value extraction ,\"4 we conclude this essay with an urgent question for executives and directors of corporations who, in their embrace of MsV ideology, must bear significant responsibility for the failure of the United States to respond to not only the Covid-19 pandemic but also the scourges of climate change and income inequity. The question: Why does the company that you head do stock buybacks? In particular, we direct this question to the executives and directors of three corporations that, as of the year 2020, are the biggest repurchasers of their own stock in history: Microsoft at number three, ExxonMobil at number two, and Apple at number one.  \n\n## 2. Organizing the federal government for pandemic preparedness and response  \n\nAs a part of a national strategy, the federal government must take the lead in establishing GBCs to prepare for a possible pandemic, to contain a contagion before it goes viral, and to implement an appropriate public-health response if and when the disease transforms from an epidemic into a pandemic. In the preparation stage, one critical task of the government is to stockpile countermeasures that are as safe, effective, and affordable as possible, with the hope that they will never have to be used. In the containment stage, the countermeasures in the stockpile must be rapidly deployed where they are needed when they are needed to support frontline organizations working to treat patients and shut down the contagion. If, using the stockpile, that effort is  \n\nLazonick and Hopkins  \n\nunsuccessful, GBCs must be in place to accelerate vaccine and therapy development and to ramp up the production and delivery of test kits, medical equipment, and PPE to frontline organizations.  \n\nAs we summarize below, by 2017 the U.S. federal government possessed an organizational structure to respond to a pandemic, and, during the last presidential transition, the Obama administration even handed the Trump administration a detailed “Playbook for Early Response to High-Consequence Emerging Infectious Disease Threats and Biological  Incidents.'5 This \"Playbook” represented the accumulated learning of federal agencies from over three decades of concern about, and analysis of, actual and potential pandemics. Within the U.s. federal government, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), established in May 1980,6 and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), founded in November 2002, contain the agencies with responsibility for preparing for a pandemic, taking actions to contain an epidemic, and implementing a response for a contagion that cannot be contained.  \n\nWithin HHS, the first challenge of dealing with a pandemic occurred in 1987, a year after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) was spreading uncontrolled around the globe. In the United States, the Reagan administration had largely ignored, and even derided, the AIDS crisis.7 On June 5, 1987, HHS Secretary Otis Bowen, speaking to over 6,ooo doctors and scientists at the Third International Conference on AIDS in Washington DC, reportedly was met with jeers and laughter from several thousand in the audience when he said: \\*“The problem of AIDS and the efforts at solution have the president's complete attention.\"\\* A decade later, HHS Secretary Donna Shalala said that in the United States more than 600,000 people had died from AIDS, while 750,000 people were living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).9 By that time, medical scientists had created a cocktail of therapies that could keep HIV-infected people alive, but these medicines were available and affordable to a very small percentage of the millions of people in the world who faced death without them. To this date, a vaccine to eradicate HIV has not been developed, and in 2018 there were between 33 million and 44 million people living with HIV worldwide.10  \n\nWithin HHS, the United States possesses the world's foremost agency for funding research into the development of life-saving medicines: the National Institutes of Health (NIH), with its 27 specialized institutes and centers. From 1938, the year it first recorded expenditures, through 2019, the NIH spent almost $\\$1.2$ trillion in 2019 dollars in support of life-sciences research. In 2020, the NIH budget is $\\$41.7$ billion.\" Between 1998 and 2004, the NIH budget increased by 2.1 times in nominal dollars (1.8 times in real dollars). The single year with by far the largest budget increase in NIH history was 2003, with over $\\$3.8$ billion $\\$4.6$ billion in 2019 dollars) added to the total  \n\nLazonick and Hopkins  \n\nbudget. Of the 27 institutes and centers that constitute the NIH, the greatest beneficiary of this doubling of the NIH budget was the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), whose own budget increased from $\\$1.4$ billion in 1998 to $\\$4.3$ billion in 2004. Of the almost $\\$3$ billion boost to NIAID's annual budget between 1998 and 2004, two-thirds occurred in the final two years.  \n\nAs the NIH institute with work most relevant to a pandemic, NIAID already had the third-largest budget in 1998, with 9.9 percent of the NIH total, trailing the National Cancer Institute (NCI) with 18.6 percent and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) with 11.2 percent. As a result of the NIH budget's doubling, NIAID was in second place in 2004 with 15.4 percent of the NIH total, just behind NCI with 16.9 percent.  \n\nThe U.S. invasion of Iraq precipitated the sharp increase in NIAID funding in 2003 and 2004. Immediately after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, there was alarm about the possibility of a bioterrorist attack on the U.S. population, utilizing highly contagious and lethal pathogens. Indeed, just one week after 9/11, one or more bioterrorists (by all accounts domestic) mailed envelopes with anthrax spores to 22 people, including prominent politicians, resulting in five fatalities.12 In his 2002 State of the Union Address, President George W. Bush signaled a focus on Iraq as a potential terrorist enemy, arguing that \"the Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear weapons for over adecade.\"13  \n\nIn November 2002, Congress created the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which consolidated 22 agencies into one. Included in DHS were a number of agencies that could enable the United States to respond to a bioterrorist attack, the most important of which were the newly created Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) as part of FEMA, the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC), and the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS).14 Previously the SNS had been the National Pharmaceutical Stockpile, launched in 1999 as part of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) within HHS.  \n\nIn his 2003 State of the Union address, delivered on January 28, President Bush engaged in fear mongering about Iraqi capacity to launch a bioterrorist or nuclear attack. Bush's speech created a pretext for the U.S. invasion of Iraq less than two months later. Although debate over whether to invade Iraq focused on whether or not Saddam Hussein possessed nuclear weapons of mass destruction, Bush used his address to emphasize the bioterrorist threat, laying out the “evidence\" point by point:  \n\nThe United Nations concluded in 1999 that Saddam Hussein had biological weapons sufficient to produce over 25 ,0o0 liters of anthrax —-enough doses to kill several million people. He hasn't accounted for that material. He has given no evidence that he has destroyed it.  \n\nLazonick and Hopkins  \n\nThe United Nations concluded that Saddam Hussein had materials sufficient to produce more than 38,0o0 liters of botulinum toxin—enough to subject millions of people to death by respiratory failure. He hasn't accounted for that material. He has given no evidence that he has destroyed it.  \n\nOur intelligence officials estimate that Saddam Hussein had the materials to produce as much as 500 tons of sarin, mustard and VX nerve agent. In such quantities, these chemical agents could also kill untold thousands. He has not accounted for these materials. He has given no evidence that he has destroyed them.  \n\nU.S. intelligence indicates that Saddam Hussein had upwards of 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents. Inspectors recently turned up 16 of them, despite Iraq's recent declaration denying their existence. Saddam Hussein has not accounted for the remaining 29,984 of these prohibited munitions. He has given no evidence that he has destroyed them.  \n\nFrom three Iraqi defectors we know that Iraq in the late 1990s had several mobile biological weapons labs. These are designed to produce germ warfare agents and can be moved from place to place to evade inspectors. Saddam Hussein has not disclosed these facilities. He has given no evidence that he has destroyed them.15  \n\nBush then went on to make his assertions that Iraq had nuclear-weapons capability. Subsequently, these allegations were center stage in gaining Congressional approval for the Iraq invasion. Bush also highlighted Iraq's advanced nuclear weapons program, claiming that Saddam had “recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa” and “attempted to purchase high strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production.'  \n\nIn the immediate aftermath of 9/11, the Bush administration had called for $\\$1.5$ billion  for bioterrorism defense, of which $\\$1.1$ billion would be used for stockpiling vaccines. Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-MA) and Sen. William Frist (R-TN), the only medical doctor in the U.S. Senate at the time, put forth a bill for $\\$3.2$ billion, which included $\\$1.1$ billion for stockpiling vaccines but far greater funding for local public-health initiatives. In the U.S. House, Rep. Henry Waxman (DCA), the ranking Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee, who spent his decades in Congress focusing on the affordability of safe and effective medicines, reportedly argued that funding for the national stockpile without adequate attention to local public-health needs “was like building fire houses and buying fire trucks, without hiring fire fighters or installing alarms.\"' Waxman continued: \\*We need to focus our spending on systems and people, not just things.\"16  \n\nAs, subsequent to Bush's 2003 State of the Union address, the United States became embroiled in Iraq, Rep. Richard Burr (R-NC) took a leading role in promoting Project BioShield, which sought as much as $\\$10$ billion over the next decade to contract with pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines and therapies for biodefense to be added to the SNS. Calling the proposed funding system \"unprecedented, Rep. John Shadegg (R-AZ), chair of the Department of Homeland Security subcommittee on emergency preparedness, stated: “Quite frankly, I am very uncomfortable about it.? Rep. John Dingell (D-MI) remarked that Project BioShield contracts with pharmaceutical companies would be “a blank check of the most extraordinary nature I've ever seen.\"17  \n\nBurr's position was clear: “Terrorism is real, and bioterrorism is real. We're dealing in an area where research and development has grown dormant.\"18 In 2003 , Project BioShield received $\\$890$ million in preauthorization funding. In May 2004, the Senate voted 99-0 to authorize funding for Project BioShield for research on and production of vaccines to counter bioterrorist agents such as anthrax, botulinum toxin, and smallpox. The Project BioShield Act, with an appropriation to DHS Oof $\\$5.6$ billion over ten years to contract with business for \\*'next generation countermeasures,” was signed by President Bush on July 21, 2004.19  \n\nBy 2005, Burr, now a senator, was pushing for an expansion of Project BioShield to broaden the authority of the federal government to fight not only bioterrorism but also naturally occurring pandemic viruses — as exemplified by the outbreak in 2003 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS, a coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-1),20 and the spread in 2004 of H5N1 avian influenza.21 In November 2005, President Bush's Homeland Security Council issued a report, National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza, in view of “an unprecedented outbreak of avian influenza in Asia and Europe, caused by the H5N1 strain of the Influenza A virus ,\\*22 followed by, in May 2006, the Council's Implementation Plan.23 In November 2005, HHS Secretary Michael Leavitt, sworn in the previous January, issued the HHS Pandemic Influenza Plan “as a blueprint for all HHS pandemic influenza and preparedness planning and response activities.\\*\"24 Governors and state health officials followed with their own pandemic influenza preparedness plans.25  \n\nIn December 2006, Congress passed the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparation Act (PAHPA) “to improve the Nation's public health and medical preparedness and response capabilities for emergencies, whether deliberate, accidental, or natural.\"26 In charge of PAHPA, within HHS, was the newly created position of Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR). Under PAHPA, Project BioShield became part of BARDA and responsibility for the SNS moved from DHS to HHS. BARDA had a budget of $\\$5.9$ billion over ten years to develop vaccines and other countermeasures for the SNS.  \n\nLazonick and Hopkins  \n\nThe Obama administration's first Secretary of Health and Human Services was Kathleen Sebelius, confirmed to the position in May 2009. Three years earlier, as governor of Kansas, Sebelius had participated in a pandemic planning summit with HHS Deputy Secretary Alex Azar as part of the initiative under HHS Secretary Leavitt to engage all of the states in the national preparedness effort. A press release for the Kansas event spelled out the terms of the federal-state collaboration: 27  \n\nIn the planning resolution, HHS commits to providing guidance and technical assistance to Kansas. This includes an initial $\\$1,462,607$ for planning, and HHS agrees to review the state's plans for use, storage and distribution of antivirals and notify it of its portion of the federal stockpile of pandemic influenza antiviral drugs. Kansas agrees to assure that its operational plan for pandemic influenza response is an integral element of the overall state and local emergency response plan and to establish a Pandemic Preparedness Coordinating Committee representing all relevant stakeholders. The state will also notify HHS of the amount of additional pandemic influenza antiviral drugs it will plan to purchase and work toward exercising its preparedness plan within eight months of today's summit.  \n\nIn late April 2009, President Barack Obama declared a public-health emergency because of a swine-flu (H1N1) epidemic that had broken out in Mexico, with 20 cases confirmed in the United States. Now-former Secretary Leavitt weighed in, stating that leaders of schools, businesses, and local governments should make plans as to “how they can continue functioning if a high number of employees cannot attend work,” adding that “any community that fails to prepare for pandemic disease because it expects the federal government can come to the rescue will be tragically disappointed....Ultimately the delivery of anti-viral drugs and vaccines will fall to local leaders....The biggest worry I have is states' ability to effectively distribute anti-virals on a wide basis.\"'28  \n\nOn April 28, a New York Times editorial asked: “Is the new swine flu virus that has killed many people in Mexico and has spread to the United States and other countries the start of a much feared pandemic? Or is this yet another false alarm —- the latest in a long history of worrying that someday a hugely lethal flu strain might sweep through the world and kill tens of millions of people, much as it did in 1918-1919?'29 By June 11, the WHO had declared the swine flu to be a pandemic, and throughout the remainder of 2009 the CDC coordinated efforts to contain its spread in the United States. The CDC has estimated (within a wide range of variability) that in the United States from April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010 there were 60.8 million cases of H1N1 swine flu, 274,304 hospitalizations, and 12 ,469 deaths.30  \n\nUnder the authority of the CDC, an existing vaccine technology was adapted to the H1N1 swine flu, and by the beginning of 2010 the pandemic had been largely tamed, with 155 million doses of vaccine distributed and 70 million Americans inoculated. In a speech to a public-health preparedness conference in February 2010, Secretary Sebelius said: \"We worked to squeeze every  \n\nLazonick and Hopkins  \n\nlast bit of efficiency and dependability out of a safe, but outdated [vaccine] technology.'31 She recognized that the federal government had much to learn about accelerating the development, production, and delivery of vaccines.  \n\nTwo months earlier, in December 2009, HHS had issued a report titled National Health Security Strategy of the United States of America, which includes an outline of the capabilities required to achieve national health security.32 This document directly links health security and economic security, albeit very broadly:  \n\nAny large-scale incident such as a natural disaster or an infectious disease pandemic that affects the health of critical workers and compromises a society's ability to provide food, water, health care and, more broadly, economic productivity endangers the security and stability of that society. Conversely, a society that can accommodate and function effectively during such an incident is inherently more secure.33  \n\nResponding explicitly to the H1N1-pandemic experience, HHS published in August 2010 The Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise Review: Transforming the Enterprise to Meet Long-Term National Needs. This document examines the content and efficacy of the system—-that is, the “countermeasures enterprise\"—- through which the federal government could collaborate with the American “community” to prepare for and respond to a pandemic. “The vision to combat such threats, the Review declares, “is simple: our nation must have the nimble, flexible capability to produce medical countermeasures rapidly in the face of any attack or threat, whether known or unknown, novel or reemerging, natural or intentional' [emphasis in original]. It argues that the prevailing countermeasure enterprise requires new, innovative approaches to meet this vision. The new strategy envisioned a capabilities-based approach that would enable the federal government to take a much more active and effective role in forging partnerships, attacking constraints, modernizing regulatory oversight, and supporting transformative technologies.  \n\nIn the summer of 2014, the Obama administration tested U.S. organizational capabilities in collaborating on a global scale to stem and contain the Ebola crisis in West Africa. Ebola spreads through body fluids and has a death rate averaging around 50 percent for those infected. There was no vaccine for Ebola viruses. In September 2014, a WHO official stated: “The Ebola epidemic ravaging parts of West Africa is the most severe acute public health emergency seen in modern times. Never before in recorded history has a biosafety level four pathogen infected so many people so quickly, over such a broad geographical area, for so long .'34  \n\nIn the United States, there was intense public focus on the few recorded domestic Ebola cases, which numbered no more than six. The interhuman transmission of the disease could only occur by contact with body fluids of an infected and symptomatic person, and, properly alerted, the U.S.  \n\npublic-health system prevented its spread. As Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of NIAID, remarked: \"We have considerable experience dealing with Ebola and controlling outbreaks. The system that's in place, with our health care infrastructure, would make it extraordinarily unlikely that we would have an outbreak.'35 In the aftermath of the Ebola threat, the White House National Security Council established the Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense to advise the president. In the words of Beth Cameron, the senior director of the Directorate, its purpose was \"to do everything possible within the vast powers and resources of the U.S. government to prepare for the next disease outbreak and prevent t from becoming an epidemic or pandemic?'36  \n\n## 3. BARDA seeks ventilator innovation for the Strategic National Stockpile  \n\nUnfortunately, SARS-CoV-2 is transmited by respiratory droplets, even those emanating from infected people who are asymptomatic. The mortality rate for people who have Covid-19 is far lower than for those infected by Ebola, but SARS-CoV-2 is far more contagious. As the novel coronavirus spread rapidly in the United States in March 2020, there was a surge in the number of people with severe respiratory problems who needed intensive care, with most Covid-19 patients in ICUs requiring ventilators to sustain their oxygen levels.37  \n\nAs expected under such circumstances, the demand for ventilators in epicenters of the Covid-19 pandemic far exceeded the number of ventilators that a local healthcare system would have on hand, based on normal usage. The total number of ventilators possessed by the United States' healthcare system is unclear; by the most recent estimate, from 2010, the American Hospital Association counted approximately 200,000 ventilators, not including an unknown number in federal or state stockpiles.38  \n\nAs New York City became the U.S. epicenter of the pandemic in the second half of March, in widely televised daily briefings New York Governor Andrew Cuomo repeatedly sounded the alarm concerning the impending ventilator shortage as an escalating number of people with Covid19 would become critically ill.39 Cuomo blamed the Trump administration for the scarcity. He claimed that New York and other states could not obtain ventilators needed from the SNS, forcing them to compete among themselves, and even with FEMA, to purchase ventilators on the product market at exorbitant prices.4° In New York State's scramble to secure 40,000 ventilators, on the recommendation of FEMA volunteers recruited by White House advisor Jared Kushner, it entered into a $\\$80$ -million contract for 1 ,450 ventilators (over $\\$59,000$ per unit) purchased from a Silicon Valley engineer who could not deliver the machines.41  \n\nIt became obvious in March 2020 that to some extent the ventilator “shortage” was the result of a President of the United States who used his control over the SNS for his own political ends by hoarding ventilators in the stockpile when they were critically needed, rewarding “friendly” state governors with ventilators while denying them to state governors whom he deemed to be “\"the enemy' 42 Trump claimed that the SNS was “bare” at the start of his term, but in fact the Trump administration had access to over 19,000 ventilators, of which 14,000 included additions to the SNS made under the Obama administration.43 Inept management of the SNS by HHS contributed to the problem: over 2,100 ventilators in the SNS in March 2020 were not functioning properly because HHS had let the stockpile's ventilator maintenance contract lapse in the late summer of 2019, renewing it only in January 2020.44  \n\nIn March 2020, the SNS had 16,660 ventilators available for distribution, but released only 7,920 by April 6.45 As a result of Cuomo's daily public cajoling of Trump, New York secured 4,400 ventilators from the SNS.46 Beyond that, New York and other states paid extortionate prices to procure critically needed ventilators from device vendors as cases of Covid-19 escalated. For example, in late March Louisiana paid $\\$43,500$ per unit for 2 ,000 Medtronic ventilators.47  \n\nIn the context of the initial release of ventilators from the SNS, on April 2, at a White House coronavirus briefing, Kushner infamously declared: \\*“The notion of the federal stockpile was it's supposed to be our stockpile. It's not supposed to be states’ stockpiles that they then use.\"48 Also on April 2, the Trump administration invoked the Defense Production Act, permitting HHS to enter into contracts with ten manufacturing companies for 198 ,890 new ventilators to be delivered to the SNS through the end of 2020 at a cost of $\\$2.9$ billion, for an average unit cost of about $\\$14,600.4$ 9 As of June 14, the states had received 10,640 units in total from the SNS. With additions to the SNS from the contracted manufacturers, the Trump administration was now hoarding about 24,000 ventilators.50  \n\nThere could have been an additional 10,0o0 ventilators with advanced technological features in the SNS in March 2020 but for the failure of business corporations to deliver innovative machines for which, through BARDA, HHS had contracted during the Obama era. These contracts provided upfront seed funding and guaranteed procurement once the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the ventilator. Investigative reports published at the end of March 2020 by the New York Times51 and ProPublicas2 established that the scarcity of ventilators in the SNS when New York City and other pandemic epicenters needed them stemmed in part from a failure to deliver by medical-equipment companies under two successive contracts — the first dating to 2010, the second to 2014-for portable, easy-to-use, affordable ventilators.  \n\nA ventilator is a complex, computerized machine that provides artificial respiration for a patient. When invasive ventilation is used in intensive-care units, a tube is inserted into the windpipe (trachea) of a patient who is having difficulty breathing for the purpose of pumping air in and out of his or her lungs. Patients are kept in a medically induced coma during the period of intubation. Ventilators can potentially save the lives of those who experience severe acute respiratory failure from Covid-19 infection by keeping them alive until the viral attack subsides. These intensive-care procedures require teams of doctors, therapists, and nurses with specialized training in the operation of ventilators.  \n\nBuilding the SNS' inventory of ventilators in preparation for a pandemic entails decisions concerning the quality, quantity, and cost of the machines in the stockpile.53 This inventory consists of ventilators that HHS has purchased from manufacturers at agreed-upon prices. If HHS wants the SNS to hold, say, 20,000 ventilators and the average price per unit is $\\$10,000$ , the capital expenditure for the stockpile would be $\\$200$ million. This capital cost, to which obsolescence and maintenance expenses must be added, is like the premium on a life-insurance policy. Taxpayers  \n\nLazonick and Hopkins  \n\ninvest in the ventilators in the stockpile even as they hope that no pandemic will occur and that the machines will not have to be deployed.  \n\nSince it will seek to reduce the cost of the “insurance premium” incurred in building the SNS, the government agency that procures the ventilators has an interest in the availability of higher-quality and lower-cost ventilators than those previously available. The government agency, in this case BARDA, can enter into a collaboration with an innovative manufacturer to develop and deliver improved equipment. A higher-quality — or next-generation — ventilator might include improved features related to portability from one healthcare venue to another; flexibility to accommodate home, transport, and hospital use; dependability of power supply; synchronicity with the patient's breathing; manufacturability, as determined by the sourcing, complexity, and number of components; and usability that permits non-specialist health personnel to safely operate the device when a pandemic surge causes shortages of pulmonologists,respiratory therapists , and specialized nurses.  \n\nGovernment procurement contracts to supply the SNS can induce a company to invest in these higher-quality features. The prestige of having the U.S. government as a customer provides a selling point that can help the manufacturer in a GBC capture a large share of the commercial market, so that, by achieving economies of scale,it can transform the high fixed cost of developing the superior machine into low unit cost.54 The manufacturer can thus profit from the particular ventilator product even as it sells the ventilator to the government at a discounted price.  \n\nThrough BARDA, HHS has a mandate, backed by a budget, to collaborate with business on innovative projects aimed at improving the quality and reducing the cost of the ventilators in the SNS.55 In 2007, at a time when there was considerable discussion of national preparedness for a pandemic,56 a panel of experts advised HHS that even in an influenza pandemic that was only moderate, the United States would need 70,oo0 more ventilators than are normally in use in the healthcare system.57 In 2008, HHS told Congress that it was seeking to add 40,000 ventilators to theSNS at a cost of $\\$3,000$ each,or $\\$120$ million in total.  \n\nIn August 2008, under the Bush administration, BARDA issued a Request for Proposal58 for a contract for domestic manufacturing to support advanced development of next generation portable ventilators with accessory components at a cost of ${<}\\$2000$ fully kitted unit that will advance the technology to meet the needs for an expected overwhelming number of respiratory infectious disease patients during a pandemic influenza outbreak or in an all-hazards (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear (CBRN)) event in which mass casualties may be expected.59  \n\nIn September 2010, under the Obama administration, as part of its planning for “a severe influenza pandemic or other public health emergency,' BARDA awarded California-based Newport Medical Instruments a three-year contract, initiated with a $\\$6.7$ million government grant, to “help fill the need for domestically manufactured, low-cost, user-friendly and flexible next-generation ventilators .\"6o According to an article in Infection Control Today, the purpose of the contract was to support “development of ventilators that utilize advanced technology, are easier for healthcare providers to use without special training, and can be used for a wider patient population. The advanced technology also considers portability and environmental factors, cost, and suitability for stockpiling.'\"61  \n\nThe goal was for BARDA to procure 10,0o0 such ventilators from Newport at $\\$3,000$ per unit, which would yield $\\$30$ million in sales for the company. If Newport had succeeded in developing the device according to the targets set by BARDA, it would have been a significant achievement. BARDA claimed that portable ventilators with all the requisite features would have a market price of $\\$6,000$ to $\\$30,000$ each.2 The implied cost savings to the SNS for 10,000 ventilators from Newport under the contract would range from $\\$30$ million to $\\$270$ million.  \n\nIn 2012, however, Newport, with 160 employees,3 was acquired by Covidien, with 43,000 employees, and by late 2013 Covidien had backed out of the project without having delivered a single ventilator to the SNS. BARDA, therefore, had to find a new business collaborator for the project to supply the SNS. In September 2014, it awarded a contract, with a $\\$13.8$ -millionseed grant, to Philips Respironics, a Pennsylvania-based manufacturer, wholly owned by the Dutch company Royal Philips.64  \n\nThis contract, which remains in force, includes an option for the SNS to purchase 10,000 completely kitted, initial production ventilators for a total of $\\$32.8$ million.65 In September 2019, the FDA approved the ventilator, the Trilogy Evo Universal, that Philips Respironics had agreed to deliver to the SNS.66 But as of March 2020, Philips had delivered not one of these machines to the SNS because its contract with HHS did not require the initial shipment of ventilators until August 2020, with all 10,000 to be delivered to the SNS by August 2022.  \n\nIn a Philips press release issued on March 31 as a rapid response to the charge by ProPublica, published the previous day, that the company was selling a commercial version of the Trilogy Evo  \n\nUniversal overseas while the HHS had still received none, Philips stated that it was “working closely with BARDA to accelerate delivery to the SNS.\"67 In a sense, the GBC that BARDA had begun in 2008 to add 10,000 innovative ventilators to the SNS could have, after 12 years, fulfilled its purpose—-except for the fact that the Covid-19 pandemic had appeared about eight months to0 soon!  \n\nSincethe $19^{\\mathrm{th}}$ century, GBCs have been fundamental to U.S. economic development.8 In preparing for a pandemic, the United States needs GBCs to innovate in the types of countermeasures— including, in addition to ventilators, vaccines, therapies, diagnostic tests, and PPE—-that go into the SNS. It may be that government agencies could generate a desired product on the scale it required without a partnership with a business firm. In an advanced economy, however, business corporations  are vast repositories of productive  capabilities—in the areas of purchasing, researching, manufacturing, and marketing - that GBCs can mobilize to serve the common good. Once a pandemic hits, public health will depend on GBCs for rapid ramp-ups in the production of approved countermeasures, as well as on their rapid distribution where and when they are needed.  \n\nThe New York Times and ProPublica carried out investigative reports into U.S. pandemic preparedness, in which they exposed the failure of the BARDA contracts to add ventilators to the SNS as the Covid-19 crisis unfolded. At the root of this failure is a highly contagious corporate disease known as “maximizing shareholder value” (MsV) that has ravaged our collective ability to engage in public-health preparedness and response in the face of a pandemic.69 The BARDA experience with the two successive ventilator contracts illustrates the centrality of innovative enterprise to public-health preparedness and how the pursuit of MSV ideology can undermine GBCs.  \n\nIn 2010, when it signed the first BARDA contract, Newport was a 29-year-old company based in Costa Mesa, California, owned by the Japanese medical-device company Tokibo.70 Newport's president, Hong-Lin Du, had joined the company in 1997 at the age of 31 after working as a product manager for Tokibo in Japan.71 With graduate degrees that included doctorates from Beijing Medical School and Tokyo University, and substantial scientific credentials, Du became Newport's president in 2001.  \n\nBARDA contracted with Newport to develop a next-generation ventilator because of the company's track record of successful innovation, which included supplying ventilators to state stockpiles.72 Newport viewed the federal contract as a learning opportunity and the prestige of being awarded it as a selling point in the commercial ventilator market. For its part, the federal  \n\nLazonick and Hopkins  \n\ngovernment recognized that commercial sales of the new ventilator would further enhance the quality of the product while making it possible for Newport to reap economies of scale, and that the combination of these two benefits would make it financially worthwhile for the company to sell the new ventilator to the SNS for $\\$3,000$ per unit.  \n\nThe New York Times story describes frequent and positive interactions between Newport and the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the agency within HHS that was monitoring Newport's progress in developing the ventilator. Thomas Frieden, who then led the CDC, told the New York Times that he “got all excited\" about the performance of three working prototypes that Newport demonstrated at the CDC in 2011.73 In April 2012, HHS told Congress that the Newport ventilator was “on schedule for market approval [by the FDA] in September 2013.\"  \n\nIn the first half of 2011, Newport took out a lease on a 35,000-square-foot industrial building, doubling its total workspace.74 Of Newport's 160 employees, 30 worked in R&D. In an interview in May 2011, Du said that Newport could develop a new ventilator in three years, compared with five to eight years for its competitors. The company co-located R&D and manufacturing in Costa Mesa for the sake of collective learning and quality control.  \n\nThe largest privately held ventilator manufacturer in the United States, Newport expected sales of $\\$50$ million in 2011, with the company's ventilators for hospital use selling for an average of $\\$16,000$ , a far lower price than those of its competitors, which included Covidien, CareFusion, Dragerwerk, and Maquet. Du extolled the advantage of not being listed on the stock market, saying: “Wall Street doesn't like to hear ‘every three years'—they like to hear ‘every three months.? Staying private, we can afford to invest our money for three years later, not for next quarter.'75  \n\nOne year after this interview, however, Tokibo sold Newport to Covidien for $\\$108$ million in cash. At this point, Du was quoted as stating: “\"This transaction highlights both companies' commitment to driving innovation and growth in the respiratory care sector by expanding their ventilator portfolio and global presence.\"76 Unfortunately, as the New York Times story documents, Covidien's commitment was to kill Newport's BARDA project because the commercialization of the Newport product would undercut Covidien's more profitable ventilators.77  \n\nIn June 2012, one month after the acquisition closed, Covidien requested and received another $\\$1.4$ million from HHS, while also demanding a higher sales price from the agency for continuing with the project. But at Newport, now a wholly owned subsidiary of Covidien, the organizational learning that is the essence of innovation had stopped. As Du put it: \\*Up until the time the company sold, I was really happy and excited about the project. Then I was assigned to a different job.'78 Rick Crawford, who had been the head of R&D at Newport before the Covidien acquisition, was  \n\nLazonick and Hopkins  \n\nkept on at Covidien to run the project but had no one assigned to work with him.79 In 2014 Covidien told BARDA that the ventilator Newport had promised to deliver would not be sufficiently profitable, and that it therefore wanted out of the contract. With Covidien exiting from the GBC, four years had been lost in carrying out the nation's SNS-ventilator mission.  \n\nStarting over, BARDA turned to Philips Respironics, based in Murrysville, Pennsylvania, to develop a portable, user-friendly ventilator for the stockpile. The company that became Respironics was founded in Murrysville in 1971 as Lanz Medical Products by Gerald E. McGinnis , a mechanical engineer with 13 years of work experience, 11 of those years doing bioengineering R&D at Westinghouse and the other two engaged in medical engineering at Pittsburgh hospitals. Renamed Respironics in 1976, the company pioneered continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy as a treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (a sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts), releasing its SleepEasy product in 1985.80  \n\nIn 1988, Respironics went public on NASDAQ, raising $\\$3.4$ million for use in expanding its product lines and enhancing its marketing capability. In its fiscal year 1988 (ending June 30), the company had $\\$14.0$ million in revenues, $\\$1.3$ million in profits, and 236 employees. In fiscal 2007, just before being acquired by the old-line Dutch company Royal Philips, Respironics had $\\$1.2$ billion in revenues, $\\$123$ million in profits, and 4,900 employees, of whom 1,700 were at the company's headquarters near Pittsburgh alongside its main global locations for R&D and manufacturing.  \n\nRespironics epitomized a “retain-and-reinvest\" company: It retained its profits, which it leveraged at times using long-term debt issues, and reinvested in productive capabilities related to respiration technology.81 Besides raising funds from the stock market in its IPO, Respironics did two secondary stock issues, one for $\\$11.7$ million in 1991, when the company also took on a net of $\\$4.8$ billion in long-term debt, and the other for $\\$47.9$ million in 1998 to finance its largest acquisition, Healthdyne Technologies. Over the two decades 1988-2007, the company's capital expenditures amounted to 6.6 percent of sales and its R&D spending 4.9 percent of sales.  \n\nIn the 20 years that Respironics was publicly listed, the company never paid a dividend. Nor, except for in 1999 and 2000, did the company do stock buybacks. When its stock price slumped at the height of the dot.com boom, Respironics’ management took the opportunity to repurchase $\\$42.3$ million of its outstanding shares (representing 7.3 percent of its profits over its 20 years as a publicly listed company). In contrast to the widespread practice of U.S. companies that, in addition to paying generous dividends, will do buybacks at high share prices during a boom to give manipulative boosts to their stock-market value,82 Respironics repurchased its shares at low prices and then retained them in its corporate treasury to be used for employee stock-based pay.  \n\nLazonick and Hopkins  \n\nMcGinnis was the company's chairman and CEO from its founding until 1994. At that point, he continued as chairman while naming as new CEO Dennis S. Meteny, an MBA who had joined Respironics in 1984.83 With $\\$78$ million in sales and almost 1 ,100 employees, Respironics shifted from exclusive reliance on growth through internal investment to growth through acquisition as well. Meteny oversaw the 1996 acquisition of Colorado-based LIFECARE International, a company whose $\\$33$ million in sales made it about one-third the size Respironics had been in 1995. LIFECARE was a global leader in portable ventilation therapy, mainly for the home.84 In 1998, Respironics acquired Healthdyne Technologies, a Georgia-based company producing medical devices for sleep and respiratory disorders with $\\$155$ million in sales and almost 600 employees. As a result, Respironics’ sales increased from $\\$179$ million in 1997 to $\\$352$ million in 1998, with employment expanding from 1 ,565 to 2,045.  \n\nIn 1999 , however, Respironics? growth stalled, and McGinnis, still in control of the company even though his personal shareholding had fallen to 2.72 percent of shares outstanding from 10.62 percent in 1991, decided to change CEOs. Out was Meteny, whom McGinnis described as “a process guy. His background was in finance. He could meet timetables and budgets better than any person I've met.\\*85 In as CEO, as of August 1999, was James W. Liken, who had built and sold his own respiratory-device company before joining the Respironics board six months earlier. McGinnis was looking to Liken to use his marketing expertise to increase the company's sales of its now-expanded product lines. As the chairman put it: \\*Jim's successful business career has been focused on marketing, selling and distributing products and services through home health care organizations to end users who range from hospitals to individuals.\\*86  \n\nUnder Liken, who served as the company's CEO for just over four years from 1999 to 2003, Respironics increased its sales from $\\$358$ million to $\\$630$ million, with its employment growing from 1,900 to 2,700. In 2002, Respironics acquired Novametrix, a leading cardiorespiratory monitoring company based in Connecticut with $\\$55$ million in sales and 235 employees.87  \n\nThen, in October 2003, McGinnis named John L. Miclot as the new CEO, with Liken staying on at Respironics in a newly created vice-chairman position. Miclot had joined Respironics in 1998 with the Healthdyne acquisition and had risen to become chief strategic officer prior to his appointment as CEO.s8 From 2004 through 2007, Respironics sales increased by 57 percent and its employment by 63 percent.  \n\nAlong with McGinnis and Liken, Miclot negotiated the sale of Respironics to Philips in January 2008.89 With the sale of Respironics to Philips, McGinnis, now 73, retired, his 1.5 percent of the company's shares worth about $\\$73$ million.9° Liken left Philips Respironics in March 2008 and Miclot in November 2008. From 1989 through 1992, Respironics had been in Forbes magazine's annual list of the 200 best small companies in the United States. In December 2007, just prior to Respironics’ sale to Philips, Forbes came out with its annual list of the 26 large U.S. companies that it had selected as best managed, one company for each of 26 industries. With its acquisition of Respironics, Philips would be taking control of Forbes′ selection as the best-managed company in the U.S. healthcare-equipment industry.91  \n\n## 4. The financialized corporations that put stock price ahead of the SNS  \n\nIt was 12 years ago that BARDA launched its initiative to support the development of a portable, user-friendly, low-cost ventilator with a view to securing 10,000 units for the SNS. What accounts for the failure of the two successive contracts under this initiative to deliver a single ventilator to the SNS by the time the Covid-19 pandemic swept the nation in from March 2020?  \n\nThis failure was not the fault of either of the original ventilator manufacturers, Newport Medical Instruments and Respironics. To the contrary, in terms of their strategy, organization, and finance, both Newport, a relatively small company when it was acquired by Covidien, and Respironics, a relatively large company by the time it was acquired by Philips, exemplified what we call \"the innovative enterprise.\"92 Newport and Respironics were the type of business firm that any economy needs to contribute to both technological progress and the achievement of stable and equitable growth.  \n\nThe problems with the SNS contracts occurred after these innovative businesses were acquired by financialized business corporations — Covidien and Philips. Once acquired, these companies were subordinated to a new managerial structure that had its own strategic priorities. While innovative companies like Newport or Respironics make acquisitions as a means of growth, or to expand on their investments in new product lines, financialized companies may make acquisitions to stop innovation in its tracks or to divert the profits of innovation away from product development and into the hands of what we call “predatory value extractors.\"93  \n\nAs we shall document, the prime corporate purpose of Covidien, of Medtronic, which acquired Covidien in 2015 , and of Philips has been to “maximize shareholder value” (MSV). That is, they seek to inflate their profits by any means possible —-in both of these cases, via acquisition —and then they distribute those profits to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks as well as cash dividends. Buybacks done, as the majority of them are, in the form of open-market repurchases serve primarily to give manipulative boosts to the repurchasing company's stock price, creating opportunities for sharesellers to pocket gains. The prime beneficiaries of the inflated stock prices are the corporation's senior executives, with their stock-based pay, as well as professional stock traders who are in the business of timing the buying and selling of shares on the public stock markets.94 We would not expect a company that, in the name of MSV, engages in buybacks with the aim of rewarding sharesellers to be a reliable partner in a GBC.  \n\nLet's recap what happened under each of these two successive contracts. The available information indicates that Newport was a highly capable and motivated company that, but for its acquisition, would have made good on its contract with HHS. It was on track to getting its ventilator approved by the FDA in late 2013 and to manufacturing 10,000 units for delivery to the SNS in 2014 and 2015. Newport would have generated $\\$30$ million in revenue —- a significant sum for this mediumsized company. But, as documented in the New York Times expose, after Covidien acquired Newport in 2012, its corporate office ensured that the manufacturing division's contract with HHS would come to an end by effectively dissolving Newport's research team and making no effort to overcome what the new owner claimed were problems with the ventilator's prospects and profitability.95  \n\nBARDA started over, turning to Philips Respironics in the second half of 2014 with a new contract to supply the SNS with the type of portable, inexpensive ventilator with universal application that Newport was ultimately prevented from producing. Respironics was also a highly capable and motivated ventilator-manufacturing firm when it was acquired by Philips in 2008. By June 2009, Philips Respironics had introduced the Trilogy100 portable at-home life-support ventilator,96 a machine that launched the series that five years later would enable the company to enter into the collaboration with BARDA. In July 2019, the FDA approved the Philips Respironics Trilogy Evo Universal ventilator.97 When, in December 2019, HHS and Philips negotiated the timeframe for the delivery of 10,000 Trilogy Evo Universal units to the SNS, nobody knew that a coronavirus pandemic would ravage the globe in the following months. Unfortunately, under the agreement, the first batch of this order was not scheduled to enter the SNS until August 2020.  \n\nMeanwhile, as documented by ProPublica in its story of March 30, Philips was selling the Trilogy EVO300—an upgraded version of the Trilogy Evo Universal—at pandemic-inflated prices around the world.98 In a follow-up article on April 8, ProPublica reported that Philips had newly agreed to supply HHS with 43,000 Trilogy EVO300 ventilators for $\\$646.7$ million.9 At just over $\\$15,000$ each, the price was an eye-popping 4.6 times the unit price of $\\$3,280$ for the 10,000 Respironics ventilators that HHS had earlier purchased. Philips claims that the EVO300 is an upgraded version of the ventilator in the original SNS contract, which remains to be completed on its own. Under the new contract revealed by ProPublica, Philips Respironics was scheduled to deliver 2,500 ventilators to the SNS by the end of May 2020 ,1o0 presumably for immediate use rather than to be kept in the stockpile, and the remaining 41,500 by the end of December 2020.  \n\nNeither the New York Times nor ProPublica mentions the financialization of, respectively, Covidien and Philips as a potential explanation for why, as we write in mid-June of 2020, these companies have failed to deliver ventilators to the SNS. Putting the spotlight on financialization, however, illuminates a number of highly pertinent facts about these companies that make clear why they were not reliable partners in a GBC for a critical public-health mission.  \n\nWe can start with Covidien, which had previously been a division of Tyco International, one of the most visibly corrupt companies of the 1990s and early 2000s. Covidien, whose executive and operational headquarters were based in Massachusetts, was a classic global tax dodger: In July 2007, under its new, made-up name,o1 the company began a new corporate life domiciled in Bermuda, the work location of only five of its 43,000 employees worldwide.102 In its previous corporate life, Covidien was named Tyco Healthcare, a division of Tyco International. The parent company's CEO was Dennis Kozlowski, who was convicted in 2005 of corporate fraud and would spend six-and-a-half years in prison.103 In 1997, Kozlowski had “relocated\" Tyco International's tax home from the United States to Bermuda in what Forbes called “an obvious tax dodge.?\"i04 In 2007, the same year that it spun off Covidien, Tyco International paid $\\$3$ billion in the largest shareholder-lawsuit settlement ever agreed to by a single corporation.105  \n\nCovidien, looking in 2009 for greener tax-dodging pastures, established a new tax home in Ireland. When it acquired Newport, both HHS and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the latter being tasked with reviewing and signing off on proposed mergers and acquisitions, should have known that Covidien had made a two-step tax hop across the Atlantic with no concern whatsoever for U.S. public-health preparedness. Given Covidien's commitment to dodging U.S. taxes, it should have come as no surprise to HHS that the company backed out of the SNS contract on the grounds that the prospective profits were insufficient.  \n\nAs it happened, the existence of Covidien as an “Irish medical device company ,”’ as ProPublica called it, created a tax-dodging opportunity for an even larger medical-equipment corporation: Medtronic.106 In January 2015, Minnesota-based Medtronic completed a $\\$50$ billion acquisition of  \n\nLazonick and Hopkins  \n\nCovidien,107 using a “corporate inversion\"ios —the largest in history —to assume Covidien's tax domicile in Ireland and cut its corporate tax bill.1o9 Obama's Treasury Department cracked down on this tax-dodging technique in 2016, introducing new rules to prevent corporate inversions.110  \n\nThe senior executives at both Covidien and Medtronic have allocated the profits boosted by global tax dodging to distributions to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. The consequent increases in stock prices have in turn boosted the massive paychecks of the very corporate executives who exercise discretion in making dividend and buyback decisions.l1 When the senior executives at Covidien or Medtronic allocated corporate cash to buybacks to give manipulative boosts to their company's stock price, they gave themselves opportunities to realize gains on the exercise of their stock options and the vesting of their stock awards.12 These realized gains represent taxable income that executives receive from their stock-based compensation.113  \n\nIn the years 2010 to 2014, Covidien allocated 75 percent of its profits to distributions to shareholders, of which two-thirds were in the form of stock buybacks. Prime beneficiaries of the buybacks were the company's own executives. In 2011-2014, Covidien CEO José E. Almeida received an average of $\\$10.2$ million per year in total remuneration, of which 68 percent came from realized gains on stock-based pay. The total compensation of the other four highest-paid Covidien executives named on proxy statements for each year from 2007 through 2014 ranged from an average of $\\$23$ million in 2012, of which 29 percent was stock-based, to $\\$9.8$ million in 2011, of which 48 percent was stock-based.  \n\nAt Medtronic, which absorbed Covidien in 2015, financialization was even more extreme. From fiscal years 2015 through 2019 (ending April 24, 2020), Medtronic distributed $\\$12.7$ billion as buybacks on top of $\\$123$ billion as dividends for a combined 126 percent of profits. According to the latest data currently available, Omar S. Ishrak took home, as CEO of Medtronic from 2011 through 2018, a total of $\\$159.9$ million—an average of $\\$20.0$ million per year- 49 percent of  \n\nLazonick and Hopkins  \n\nwhich consisted of his realized gains from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of stock awards.  \n\nThe total compensation of the other four highest-paid Medtronic executives named on proxy statements for each year from 2006 through 2018 varied from an average of $\\$2.2$ million in 2010, of which 16 percent was stock-based, to $\\$13.7$ million in 2014, of which 32 percent was stockbased. In 2007, at the peak of the stock market boom that preceded the financial crisis, the total compensation of the four other highest-paid Medtronic executives averaged $\\$8.5$ million, of which 79 percent was stock-based.  \n\nAbout 25 percent of CEO Ishrak's total compensation for 2011-2018 came from cash payouts from a complex \"long-term incentive plan\" based on a variety of financial metrics, including revenue growth, earnings per share, cash from operations, and return on invested capital. Ishrak also received $\\$24.7$ million in fiscal 2014 (another 16 percent of his compensation over the eight-year period) under the nebulous category “other compensation.\" The $\\$24.7$ million materialized as part of a “change in control' payment triggered by the Covidien acquisition. The purpose of this payment was, as stated in a Medtronic Transaction Proxy S-4 filing (November 20, 2014), “to provide compensation to offset the impact of the Covidien acquisition associated excise tax on [CEO Ishrak's] unexercised stock options and unvested restricted stock units.\"\"  \n\nMedtronic's other senior executive employees received the same treatment, which yielded them millions of dollars in additional pay. Meanwhile, under Internal Revenue Service rules, Medtronic's acquisition of Covidien through a corporate inversion meant that Medtronic's shareholders were deemed to have sold their shares, on which, if their tax home was in the United States, they then had to pay capital-gains taxes of up to 33 percent.114 In other words, Medtronic's top executives had this tax disincentive to merge removed from their decision- making—and, arguably, had all the more reason to do the corporate inversion-while the company's other shareholders were pushed into what for many was a major taxable event.  \n\nWith its historical growth solidly rooted in the United States, and U.S. sales making up 53 percent of its total revenue of $\\$30.9$ billion in fiscal 2018, Medtronic -- the world's largest medical-device company —is an American corporation.1i5 But with its tax home in Ireland and its obeisance to MSV, one would not expect Medtronic, any more than Covidien, to be a reliable partner in any GBC needed to beat back a pandemic. In that regard, Medtronic is no different than Royal Philips, a company born and bred in the Netherlands, whose division Philips Healthcare represents the world's third-largest medical-device company (number two is Johnson & Johnson, and number four is GE Healthcare).116  \n\nFounded in 1891 as a light-bulb company —- Europe's counterpart to General Electric— Philips entered the medical-equipment industry over a century ago and expanded rapidly through acquisitions from the beginning of the 2000s. In 2006 and 2007, the company went on a medicaldevice shopping spree. In September 2007, it changed its medical-device division's name from Philips Medical Systems to Philips Healthcare.117  \n\nOn December 21, 2007, Philips announced its $\\$5.1$ billion bid for Respironics in an all-cash transaction that gave the acquiree's shareholders a 31 percent premium over the market price of the stock.118 Its largest acquisition ever, Philips was gaining possession of a highly successful company that had increased its sales by 2.4 times from 2002 to reach $\\$1.2$ billion dollars in 2007. In 2002, Respironics′ $\\$38$ million in profits represented 7.8 percent of sales, while in 2007, its $\\$123$ million in profits was 10.2 percent of sales.  \n\nRespironics’ shareholders may have benefited financially from the fact that on December 10, less than two weeks before the bid, U.S. hedge funds D. E. Shaw and Jana Partners, which between the two of them had purchased 1.6 percent of Philips’ outstanding shares, informed the Dutch company that they intended “to act together to jointly communicate their views, publicly or privately, regarding operating performance and capital structure.\"ii9 A Financial Times article noted that the pressure on Philips “comes at a time when Dutch companies are increasingly takeover targets, thanks to corporate governance changes introduced since 2004 that hand greater powers to investors.\" It went on to say that the communication to Philips from the U.S. hedge funds “set nerves jangling in the Netherlands, where activist investors have initiated a series of high-profile break-ups and takeovers, such as this year's battle for ABN Amro.\"120  \n\nPhilips had already repurchased $\\$7.8$ billion of its own shares since 2005 but was still accumulating cash from retained earnings and asset sales. The company may have been willing to pay more for Respironics than would have otherwise been the case, in order to get cash off its books to appease the U.S. hedge funds. In discussing the hedge-fund demands, the Philips CFO, Pierre-Jean Sivignon, said that the Respironics acquisition helped his company to move toward “an efficient balance sheet.\"i121 More directly to the point, within a week of being given notice by the hedge funds, Philips announced a new $\\in5$ -billion stock-buyback program for the next two years. 122 In fact, Philips did most of the buybacks in the first four months of 2008, while Shaw was selling its Philips shares.123  \n\nSince then, Philips has become among the most financialized companies in Europe. From 2010 through 2019, the company did $\\$8.1$ billion in buybacks, equal to 86 percent of its profits, plus  \n\nLazonick and Hopkins  \n\n$\\$3.9$ billion in dividends, another 41 percent of profits. Over his nine years as CEO of Philips, from 2011 through 2019, Frans van Houten averaged $\\$4.8$ million per year in total remuneration, of which 34 percent was realized gains from stock-based pay. From 2017 through 2019, his average total remuneration was $\\$70$ million, of which 49 percent was stock-based. In addition, other components of his compensation were dependent on the performance of the company's stock.  \n\nThe BARDA ventilator contract with Philips is for machines developed and produced in the United States by its Respironics division. Yet the contract leaves HHS dependent on a company, Dutchbased Philips, that is afflicted by the American disease known as MsV, even though, as an independent ventilator-manufacturing company, U.S.-based Respironics had never contracted that disease. We call MsV a disease because it undermines the social conditions of innovative enterprise and, as a result, the nation's public-health capabilities to prepare for and respond to a pandemic. In the next section, we explain why MsV is hazardous to both our wealth and our health.  \n\n## 5. Why MSV renders a business firm unreliable in a GBC  \n\nThe success of a GBC depends in part on the resource-allocation strategy of the business firm with which a government agency partners. As we have seen in the case of Respironics, a small firm can grow to be large by generating a competitive product that can make the company profitable and by then reinvesting those profits in a widening array of new competitive products. These products are competitive because the innovative enterprise develops a higher-quality product than had previously been available and then, possessing a higher-quality product, drives down unit costs as it captures a larger extent of the market. The growth of the innovative enterprise entails, first and foremost, investments in the productive capabilities of the firm's employees, who through continued employment engage in the collective and cumulative learning that is the essence of the innovation process.  \n\nWe call this mode of innovative resource allocation “retain-and-reinvest\": The firm retains a substantial portion of its profits and reinvests in the productive capabilities of its employees. $^{124}\\mathrm{~A~}$ retain-and-reinvest allocation regime explains not only the growth of the firm but also its contributions to rising living standards as the company shares its productivity gains, monetized as profits, with employees in the form of higher wages, enhanced benefits, and more secure employment. Innovation is an inherently uncertain process. By committing financial resources to the organizational integration of the skills and efforts of employees, however, the firm can confront and overcome that uncertainty by generating a higher-quality, lower-cost product than had previously been available. As a result, both the firm and the economy in which it operates can grow.  \n\nIt is always possible, however, that the senior executives of a firm that has generated profits through an innovative strategy of retain-and-reinvest will at some point choose instead to make resource allocations that are diametrically opposed; a strategy that we summarize as “downsizeand-distribute? These executives may be able and willing to downsize the labor force by cutting pay, reducing benefits, and laying off employees, all for the sake of distributing more corporate cash to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. MSV ideology, buttressed by pressures from today's corporate raiders, the so-called “hedge-fund activists,”’ may motivate corporate executives to engage in downsize-and-distribute, or even intimidate them into doing so.125 Stock-based pay rewards senior corporate executives for this financialized behavior.126  \n\nIn any GBC focused on preparedness for and response to a pandemic, a government agency would want to partner with firms that retain and reinvest. Here is how “retain-and-reinvest\" works: A business firm creates value when it generates products (goods and services) that buyers need or want at prices that they are able or willing to pay. Product-market competition requires the firm to be capable of producing a higher-quality product than its rivals, which means that the firm has to mobilize the skills and efforts of its employees to engage in organizational learning —- the essence of the innovation process. This organizational learning, however, burdens the firm with a high fixed cost that it incurs in advance of generating revenues from the products that its productive capabilities have the potential to create. This high fixed cost places the firm at a competitive disadvantage unless it can manage to embody this learning in a product that it sells on the market to generate revenues.  \n\nIf that high fixed-cost investment in organizational learning can indeed generate a higher-quality product— an outcome which is always uncertain —the firm may be able to capture a large extent of the product market. This high sales volume would then enable the firm to reap economies of scale, thus transforming its high fixed cost into low unit cost, thereby giving the firm a sustainable competitive advantage. The word for this process of developing and utilizing the firm's productive capabilities to generate a higher-quality, lower-cost product is “innovation.\"  \n\nIn any accounting period, innovation may enable a firm to generate profits; that is, an excess of revenues over cost. The firm can then, over accounting periods, retain the profits from innovation and reinvest in the growth of the firm. Specifically, the innovative enterprise uses its profits as a financial foundation for a) maintaining and expanding its existing plant and equipment; b) rewarding its employees in the form of higher wages, superior benefits, and stable employment for their prior contributions of skill and effort to generating the firm's profits; and c) reinvesting in the organizational-learning processes that, building on the firm's existing capabilities, can generate a new higher-quality, lower-cost product. By sharing the gains from innovation with employees, this retain-and-reinvest regime of corporate resource allocation enables the firm to contribute to stable and equitable growth in the economy as a whole.  \n\nBut beware the emergence of predatory value extractors: stock-market traders who, by timing the buying and selling of shares, lay claim to the profits that the skills and efforts of employees have generated.127 Without making any investment whatsoever in the productive capabilities of the business enterprise, these stock-market traders—misleadingly called “investors\"—-can use their wealth, visibility, hype, and influence to increase distributions to shareholders in the form of cash dividends and stock buybacks. They can then use insider information on when buybacks are being  \n\nLazonick and Hopkins  \n\ndone to time their stock trades so as to increase their realized gains.128 Among these predatory value extractors may be a corporation's own senior executives, with their stock-based pay, and hedge-fund managers who are in the business of timing the buying and selling of shares.  \n\nThe rise of MsV as an ideology of corporate resource allocation from the 1970s legitimized and empowered the transformation of the resource-allocation strategies of U.s. publicly listed corporations from retain-and-reinvest to downsize-and-distribute. This transformation has been a prime driver of both the concentration of income among the richest U.S. households and the erosion of the middle-class employment opportunities that large business corporations provided in the past.129 The distributions to shareholders that have made the rich even richer at the expense of most corporate employees have taken the form of stock buybacks in addition to cash dividends.  \n\nWe have tracked distributions to shareholders by the 222 companies in the S&P 500 Index in January 2019 that were publicly listed from 1981 through 2018. In 1981-1983, these companies paid out 50 percent of their profits as dividends and less than five percent as stock buybacks. In 2016-2018, these same 222 companies distributed 52 percent of profits as dividends and 64 percent asbuybacks.  \n\nDividends are a reward to shareholders for holding shares in the company. When a dividend is paid on a class of shares, all shareholders of that class receive the same dividend. Nevertheless, shareholding across all U.S. households is highly skewed. In 2016, almost half of U.S. households held some shares—either directly, or indirectly through mutual funds, pension accounts, or trusts —but 84 percent of the value of all outstanding stock in American hands benefited just the richest ten percent of households, contributing to income inequality when shares are sold or dividends are paid.130  \n\nThe distribution of the gains from buybacks are far more unequal because professional sharesellers— including senior executives, Wall Street bankers, and hedge-fund managers —have access to inside information that can help them time the sale of their shares. Subject to an announced buyback program, approved in advance by the company's board, the vast majority of actual buybacks are done as open-market repurchases, with the company's CEO and CFO instructing its broker to repurchase a certain value of shares on any given trading day.  \n\nBuybacks are much more volatile than dividends over the booms and busts of the stock market and are mostly done when stock prices are high and rising—in part boosted by buybacks themselves.131 Moreover, under Rule 10b-18, adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in November 1982, the precise days on which buybacks are being done are not disclosed to the public -- or even to the SEC.132 As a result, buybacks overwhelmingly benefit senior executives, Wall Street bankers, and hedge-fund managers, who either know or, as professional stock traders, can figure out when the company's broker is executing a repurchase order.133  \n\nDistributions to shareholders, and in particular those done as buybacks, are massive. From 2009 through 2018, the 465 companies in the S&P 500 Index in January 2019 that were publicly listed over the decade expended $\\$4.3$ trillion dollars on stock buybacks, equal to 52 percent of their combined profits.134 That was on top of the $\\$3.3$ trillion (39 percent of profits) in dividends that these companies distributed to shareholders.  \n\nThe top ten corporate repurchasers over 2009-2018 were Apple with $\\$239$ billion in buybacks; Exxon Mobil, $\\$112$ billion; Microsoft, $\\$103$ billion; Oracle, $\\$98$ billion; IBM, $\\$87$ billion; JPMorgan Chase, $\\$73$ billion; Walmart, $\\$72$ billion; Wells Fargo, $\\$69$ billion; Pfizer, $\\$68$ billion; and Cisco Systems, $\\$67$ billion. As we have seen, by giving manipulative boosts to the company's stock price, these distributions to shareholders augment the realized gains on the stock-based pay of the same corporate executives who make these resource-allocation decisions. From 2009 through 2018, the total annual remuneration of the 500 highest-paid CEOs in the United States for each year ranged from an average of, in 2009, $\\$123$ million, of which 56 percent was realized gains from stock-based pay, to, in 2015, $\\$23.0$ million, of which 79 percent was stock-based. Our research reveals that this stock-based executive pay tends to incentivize downsize-and-distribute rather than retain-and-reinvest.135  \n\nCorporate executives like to say that these distributions, whether carried out as dividends or buybacks, constitute the “return\"' of cash to shareholders.136 But as a rule the only shares that public shareholders buy or sell are those already outstanding on the stock market; they do not, therefore, provide the firms whose stocks they may acquire with any finance for investment in productive capabilities.137 How, then, can corporate cash be “returned\" to these shareholders?  \n\nThe MsV argument that legitimizes this financialized behavior traces its origins back to a magazine article entitled “The social responsibility of a business is to increase its profits,\" published in the New York Times in September 1970. Its author, the free-market economist Milton Friedman, was responding to consumer activists who, as part of “Campaign GM,\" had submitted  \n\nLazonick and Hopkins  \n\na shareholder proposal to General Motors′ annual meeting in May 1970 to include three “public interest’ members on GM's board of directors for the purpose of advocating for safer and more fuel-efficient cars.138 The proposal garnered little shareholder support, but GM announced in August that, in response to Campaign GM, it had set up a five-person committee of existing board members to study the matters of car safety and fuel efficiency.  \n\nA New York Times editor's comment that prefaced the article stated that Friedman “calls such drives for social responsibility in business ‘pure and unadulterated socialism, and quoted Friedman further: \\*Businessmen who talk this way are unwitting puppets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society.''  \n\nReally? \\*Pure and unadulterated socialism\"? “Undermining the basis for a free society\"?  \n\nThe demands of Campaign GM for safer and less-polluting cars were basically demands that the world's largest car company deliver higher-quality products and thereby engage in automobile innovation.139 Indulging in silly name-calling, Friedman passed over the profoundly important insights of Joseph Schumpeter, who, writing in the first half of the twentieth century, saw innovation as “the fundamental phenomenon\" of a capitalist economy.140 In fact, one can search Friedman's writings in vain for any semblance of a discussion of \"“innovation,” for the reason that he held the neoclassical-economics view that the most unproductive firm is the foundation of the most efficient economy.141 This obviously absurd intellectual “basis of a free society” underpins all of the cant that academics, executives, and reporters have spewed about “maximizing shareholder value” in the half-century since Friedman wrote these words.142  \n\nIf, in the last decades of the twentieth century, GM's executives had been advantaged by the presence of public-interest representatives on the company's board of directors, they might have competed with Asian and European car companies in producing the “socially responsible” cars that buyers have increasingly demanded. In the name of MSV, GM chose not to be an innovator in global markets. This organizational failure is a prime reason why, over the ensuing decades, GM's market share declined.143 In retrospect, it is evident that what Professor Friedman called “pure and unadulterated socialism” was in fact the innovative future of the automobile industry!  \n\nThe purpose of any business firm is to sell safe, effective, and affordable products. In an industry such as automobiles, different types of buyers with different needs, tastes, and incomes have different views of what “safe,’ “effective,” and “affordable” mean. But there is widespread agreement that the government has an important, and even critical, regulatory role to play in reducing the probability of accidental death and preserving the environment. At any point in time, there may be a legitimate argument about tradeoffs among safety, effectiveness, and affordability. But over time, innovation can reduce tradeoffs, making it possible to improve safety , effectiveness, and affordability simultaneously.  \n\nThat is, as we have seen, precisely what BARDA was attempting to accomplish with its contracts for portable, easy-to-use, and inexpensive ventilators when, for the sake of public-health preparedness for a pandemic , it entered into collaborations with Newport Medical Instruments and Philips Respironics. Now that we are in the midst of a pandemic of gargantuan proportions, the importance for public health of GBCs in vaccines, therapies, diagnostic tests, and PPE, as well as ventilators, has become all too painfully obvious.  \n\nOf all the countermeasures in the SNS, the supply of ventilators has proven to be the most tractable challenge. Even if it took two successive contracts and a dozen years, the BARDA ventilator initiative did in the end support the generation of an innovative product, largely due to the productive capabilities accumulated by Respironics over almost half a century. Even figuring in the cost of the wasted time and effort caused by Covidien's reneging on the first contract, BARDA dispensed a modest $\\$21.9$ million in upfront subsidies to Newport Medical and Philips Respironics combined. With 10,000 ventilators in BARDA's procurement contract with Philips Respironics priced at only $\\$3,280$ per unit, U.S. taxpayers are receiving excellent value for the $\\$21.9$ million in subsidies paid out under the two contracts. Because of Respironics’ innovative capability, accumulated over decades, the SNS is getting a ventilator that is not only a lower cost but also a higher quality product than was previously available.  \n\nThere are justified concerns that corporations that prioritize boosting their stock prices might impede the development, production, and delivery of safe, effective and affordable vaccines144 and therapies.145 We will be very fortunate if, after billions of dollars in U.S. government subsidies to the pharmaceutical industry, we have a safe and effective Covid-19 vaccine available by the end of 2021. There will then be the immense task of producing billions upon billions of doses and distributing them, affordably, throughout the world.  \n\nWhile some nations have gone a long way in containing the contagion by diagnostic testing, monitoring, and contact tracing, as of mid-July 2020 the U.S. effort had barely gotten off the ground.146 There is a host of logistical issues related to diagnostic testing and contact tracing, for which reliance on financialized companies such as Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp—or completely unqualified vendors147 —- pose problems such as week-long delays in providing Covid  \n\n19 test results.148 In 2010-2019, Quest distributed just over 100 percent of profits to shareholders,   \n74 percent as buybacks, while LabCorp paid out 63 percent of profits, all as buybacks.  \n\nWhile a ramp-up and distribution of most PPE should be straightforward, the Trump administration has been unable and, indeed, unwilling to lead these efforts. Front-line medical workers in pandemic hotspots have experienced severe PPE shortages.149 The world's three largest producers of N95 respirator masks — 3M, Honeywell, and Kimberly-Clark —-are U.S.-based, with most of their production being done in China.15o These three companies are all dedicated to MSV -- which, along with the inept and conniving Trump administration,151 may help explain the slow ramp up in N95 mask production.152 For 2010-2019, the proportion of profits distributed to shareholders was 121 percent for 3M, 90 percent for Honeywell, and 129 percent for KimberlyClark, with, respectively, 72 percent, 47 percent, and 59 percent going to buybacks. Meanwhile, in 2010-2019, the largest PPE distributor, McKesson paid out 115 percent of profits to shareholders, with 100 percent of profits as buybacks; for the second largest, Cardinal Health, these figures were 101 percent and 57 percent, respectively. Both of these companies paid huge penalties for their involvement in the opioid public-health crisis.153  \n\nQuite apart from the inconstancy of the direction emanating from the White House, the failure of the Trump administration to provide leadership in response to the pandemic can plausibly be attributed to the extent to which its cabinet is dominated by business people who have made their fortunes as predatory value extractors. Like Trump himself, two of the more prominent businesspeople, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wibur Ross, acquired their wealth through predatory value extraction— in all three cases in real estate.154 One can add to this list Trump's top advisor, Jared Kushner.155  \n\nIt follows that the Trump administration's policy for dealing with the pandemic can be described as downsize-and-distribute. “\"Downsize”’ is measured not only in many tens of millions of people stricken from payrolls but also in many tens of thousands of low-paid and unemployed Americans, and especially people of color, dead from Covid-19.156 \\*Distribute” is measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer money to the richest households in the form of tax breaks, lowinterest loans, and outright gifts.157  \n\nNotwithstanding the plunge in the U.S. stock markets in March 2020, their subsequent complete \"recovery” demonstrates clearly that, driven as it is by speculation, and manipulation in addition to innovation, stock-market performance has little to do with the performance of the economy as a whole.158 In particular, as a larger-scale extension of “quantitative easing” policies during the Obama administration that helped fuel the buyback boom, the Federal Reserve has assumed a permanent role in shoring up financial markets, reinforcing fiscal allocations in the congressional bailouts that put first making whole debtholders and shareholders while doing little to secure the livelihoods of American workers and the viability of small businesses.  \n\nAs we ask why the federal government was so slow in responding to the coronavirus pandemic once it was known to have arrived, we learn of brazen acts of pandemic value extraction, none of which is more egregious than that of U.S. Senator Richard Burr (R-NC). In February 2020, ahead of the coronavirus-induced stock-market decline, he sold $\\$1.7$ million in stock. The sales occurred at a time when Burr, in his capacity as chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, had access to nonpublic congressional briefings on the potentially devastating impacts of the coronavirus outbreak.159 A secret recording, obtained by NPR, revealed that on February 27, about two weeks after he sold his stock, Burr \"warned a small group of well-connected constituents...to prepare for dire economic and societal effects of the coronavirus.\"160 Also on February 27, President Trump claimed that the coronavirus would simply disappear \\*like a miracle \\*\"161  \n\nWe met Richard Burr earlier in this essay. The distinctive focus of his congressional career, on the basis of which he ultimately became Senate Intelligence Committee chair, was his leadership, first as a House member and then as a senator, in the creation of Project BioShield and BARDA subsequent to President Bush's 2003 State of the Union address, which goaded Congress into supporting the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Burr's apparent concerns were preparedness for and response to a bioterrorist attack. There is no evidence that, in taking an interest in the threat of bioterrorism, Burr was calculating that doing so might ultimately place him in a position in which insider access to congressional intelligence would give him a heads up and enable him to dump his stockholdings before the public became aware of an emerging pandemic. Nevertheless, the fact is that in February 2012 Burr had been one of only three senators to vote against the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act; the Senate vote was 96-3 and the House vote 417-2.162  \n\nIn legislating the STOCK Act in 2012, Congress sought to prevent elected officials from engaging in a form of insider trading, given their access to nonpublic information or their ability to influence economic policy. At the same time, Congress should have taken a look at the opportunities for senior corporate executives to trade for their personal benefit, also on the basis of nonpublic material information, facilitated by SEC Rule 10b-18, in realizing gains on their stock-based pay .163 As already mentioned, since November 1982, Rule 10b-18 has given both corporate executives and corporate raiders a license to loot the treasuries of major U.S. business corporations.164  \n\nMore recently, congressional scrutiny of the damage that stock buybacks do has resulted in the introduction by Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) of the Reward Work Act, which would rescind Rule 10b-18 and give employees representation on the boards of publicly listed companies.165 If passed  \n\nLazonick and Hopkins  \n\ninto law, the Reward Work Act would represent a historic first step in reforming U.S. corporate governance to serve the common good. The proposed Baldwin legislation has been reinforced by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) with her Accountable Capitalism Act, which would create a national corporate charter to set standards for corporate responsibility,restrict gains on stock-based pay, and place worker representatives on corporate boards.166 Meanwhile, with the looting of the U.S. business corporation continuing unchecked, the unmitigated dominance of MsV in the governance of U.S. corporations remains the prime economic disease exacerbating the devastation of Covid-19.167  \n\n## 6.The $\\$53$ trillion for the largest stock repurchasers: Why do you do them?  \n\nWith senior executives of major U.S. corporations paying homage to MSV ideology, Americans have received little leadership from the world of big business in responding to the Covid-19 crisis, much less preparing for its eventuality in advance. A highly visible apparent exception is Bill Gates, the billionaire who founded Microsoft in 1975 and was its CEO until 2000. At that point, as one of the richest people in the world, he launched the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, with a focus on infectious diseases.168 In 2015, Gates gave a now-famous TED Talk in which, influenced by the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa, he warned: “\"If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it's most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war. Not missiles, but microbes.?\" Gates concluded the talk with the optimistic advice that “there's no need to panic...if there's one positive thing that can come out of the Ebola epidemic, it's that it can serve as an early warning, a wake-up call to get ready. If we start now, we can be ready for the next epidemic.\"169  \n\nYet, as chairman of Microsoft until 2014 and then a director until March 2020, Gates bears a portion of the blame for the fact that the United States was not ready for the Covid-19 pandemic. As we have seen, for a decade before Gates gave his TED Talk, the U.S. government had been creating plans and agencies to prepare for and respond to a pandemic. So what was a company such as Microsoft doing to engage in pandemic preparedness?  \n\nGates had become one of the world's richest people by building a retain-and-reinvest company that over its first two decades pioneered in software innovation for the personal computer, culminating in the release of the Windows operating system and its suite of applications in 1995. Since that time, however, Microsoft has become one of the most financialized companies on earth, embracing a monopolistic resource-allocation regime that we call “dominate-and-distribute\"; the company has dominated its main product market and distributed its profits to shareholders.  \n\nLazonick and Hopkins  \n\nTable 1 shows Microsoft's distributions to shareholders by decade from 1985 through 2014, for the half decade 2015-2019, and for the first nine months of 2020. As can be seen in Table 1, for the years 2005-2019, the company spent $\\$190$ billion on buybacks, equal to 68 percent of its net income, for the purpose of giving manipulative boosts to its stock price. These buybacks were done in addition to dividend payments of $\\$147$ billion, absorbing 52 percent of net income. During this period, Microsoft was the third largest repurchaser of its own stock, after Apple with $\\$306$ billion in buybacks and Exxon Mobil with $\\$227$ billion.  \n\nTable 1: Microsoft, distributions to shareholders of net income (NI) as dividends (DV) and buybacks (BB), 1985-2020Q3 (fiscal years ending June30)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>NI $m</td><td>DV $m</td><td>BB $m</td><td>DV/NI %</td><td>BB/NI %</td><td>(DV+BB)/ NI%</td></tr><tr><td>1985-1994</td><td>3,979</td><td>0</td><td>977</td><td>0.0</td><td>24.5</td><td>24.5</td></tr><tr><td>1995-2004</td><td>62,134</td><td>2,670</td><td>37,337</td><td>4.3</td><td>60.1</td><td>64.4</td></tr><tr><td>2005-2014</td><td>173,993</td><td>86,730</td><td>117,254</td><td>49.8</td><td>67.4</td><td>117.2</td></tr><tr><td>2015-2019</td><td>106,006</td><td>60,160</td><td>72,464</td><td>56.8</td><td>68.4</td><td>125.1</td></tr><tr><td>2020Q1&2&3</td><td>33,079</td><td>11,272</td><td>17,177</td><td>34.1</td><td>51.9</td><td>86.0</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nSource: S&P Compustat database and Microsoft annual 10-K and quarterly 10-Q filings with the SEC  \n\nOn its website, Microsoft has a page labeled “Cash Returned to Shareholders ,”’ with buybacks and dividends displayed on a quarterly basis from 2005 to the present.170 Why “returned\"? The only funds Microsoft ever raised from the public stock market were $\\$59$ million in its initial public offering in March 1986. The company also did a convertible bond issue for $\\$875$ million in 1996; however, a stated purpose for that offering was to fund the repurchase of shares.  \n\nAs a founder, CEO and chairman and/or director of Microsoft from 1975 to 2020, Gates more than anyone must know that it makes no sense to portray as being “returned\" to shareholders the $\\$406$ billion- $\\$245$ billion as buybacks and $\\$161$ billion as dividends— that the company distributed from 1990 through the third quarter of 2020. Gates must know that public shareholders are not \"investors” in Microsoft's productive capabilities; its shareholders do no more than buy and sell outstanding shares on the highly liquid NASDAQ stock exchange. The company's cash cannot be \"returned\"’ to shareholders who never gave the company anything. So, we ask Bill Gates: Why did Microsoft do all those stock buybacks?  \n\nThe allocation of Microsoft's resources, including those that it accounts for as profits, is under the control of the company's board. Under the leadership of Gates, Microsoft's board could have allocated a portion of the corporate cash that it wasted on buybacks, for example, to GBCs to prepare for and respond to a pandemic. Just 25 percent of the $\\$190$ billion dissipated as buybacks from 2005 through 2019 would have meant $\\$45$ billion devoted to GBCs over 15 years (7.6 times the government funds actually allocated to vaccine research by BARDA). If Microsoft had taken the lead in such an initiative and other companies had followed suit, the resources available to GBCs would have been immense. Moreover, these funds could have been put to use in preparing  \n\nLazonick and Hopkins  \n\nfor a pandemic by employing talented and motivated people, many of whom would have already accumulated unique productive capabilities working for knowledge-intensive companies such as Microsoft.  \n\nGates has had no problem getting together with the senior executives of other U.S. companies to lobby the federal government to use taxpayer money to fund investments in knowledge and infrastructure to develop productive capabilities that their companies need. A case in point is the self-styled American Energy Innovation Council (AEIC), which, when it came on the scene in 2010, was made up of current and former heads of Bank of America, Cummins Engine, Du Pont, General Electric, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, and Xerox as well as John Doerr, partner in the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. In June 2010 AEIC released a plan for \"America's Energy Future ,”' which called for the U.S. government to increase annual spending on clean-energy innovation from $\\$5$ billion to $\\$16$ billion.171 Gates represented Microsoft on the AEIC and, according to its current website, he remains one of the group's 12 “principals,’ listing his affiliations as the Gates Foundation and Microsoft.172  \n\nBack in 2010, in a press release for “America's Energy Future ,’ Doerr stated:  \n\nWhen our company [Kleiner Perkins] shifted our attention to clean energy, we found the innovation cupboard was close to bare. America has simply neglected to support serious energy innovation. My partners and I found the best fuel cells, the best energy storage, and the best wind technologies were all born outside the United States. Other countries are investing huge amounts in these fields. Without innovation, we cannot build great energy companies. We need to restock the cupboard or be left behind.173  \n\nThe corporate executives who constituted AEIC at the time were looking for the U.S. taxpayer to foot the bill for stocking the clean-energy cupboard. What about financial contributions to a national clean-energy effort by business corporations that would be collaborators with the government in the development of these new technologies? As a result of involvement in GBCs, these business corporations would then have possessed unique productive capabilities that could have generated innovative products and processes over the next generation and beyond.  \n\nIf the corporate executives who banded together as AEIC had not been so immersed in MSV ideology, dissipating hundreds of billions of corporate dollars on stock buybacks, they might have offered to invest substantial sums of corporate cash in GBCs for innovation in clean technology. Over the decade 2001-2010, the seven publicly listed corporations whose current or former leaders were members of the AEIC had spent a total of $\\$241$ billion buying back their companies’ stock, including $\\$110$ billion by Microsoft (the second highest of all U.S. companies over the decade), $\\$52$ billion by Bank of America, and $\\$48$ billion by General Electric. Through GBCs, corporate cash could have been invested in clean energy innovation to “restock the cupboard” instead of being used to manipulate these companies? stock prices.  \n\nIn laying out its 2010 plan for “America's Energy Future ,’ AEIC could have also demanded that the U.S. government cease subsidizing the fossil-fuel industry174 and that the leading oil-refining companies desist from wasting their corporate cash on buybacks. For the decade 2001-2010, Exxon Mobil was the world's number-one stock repurchaser, with $\\$174$ billion in buybacks. Of the other leading oil companies, Chevron spent $\\$26$ billion and ConocoPhillips $\\$22$ billion on buybacks over the decade, placing them $21^{\\mathrm{st}}$ and $25^{\\mathrm{th}}$ in repurchases among companies that were in the S&P 500 Index in January 2011. Of course, the business executives who constituted AEIC were themselves begging for government subsidies for their companies’ clean-energy needs. Executive members of the AEIC were not about to ask their oil company counterparts to stop doing buybacks when they themselves were looting their own corporate treasuries to boost their companies? stock prices.  \n\nAs in the case of Microsoft, stock buybacks by the major oil companies cannot be construed as cash being returned to shareholders. Exxon Mobil traces its roots back to Standard Oil, which was founded in 1870. Standard Oil of New Jersey (eventually Exxon) listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1920, and Standard Oil of New York (eventually Mobil) in 1927. Chevron dates back to 1876 and, as Standard Oil of California, was first listed on the NYSE in 1921, while ConocoPhillips originated in 1875 and debuted on the NYSE in 1929.  \n\nAs Steve Coll summed up the theme of his book Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power: “ExxonMobil saw itself as an independent, transnational corporate sovereign in the world, a power independent of the American government, one devoted firmly to shareholder interests and possessed of its own foreign policy.\"175 ExxonMobil is infamous for keeping secret an early, and quite accurate, study of climate change that the company funded, and for backing members of Congress and a corporate lobby group engaged in climate-change denial.176  \n\nIn 1983 and 1984 Exxon was quick to respond to Rule 10b-18, the “license to loot’ promulgated by the SEC in November 1982. In addition to distributing 52 percent of net income over the two years as dividends, Exxon did $\\$762$ million in buybacks in 1983 (15 percent of net income) and $\\$2.6$ billion in 1984 (48 percent of net income). Subsequent to the adoption of Rule 10b-18, Mobil did not do significant buybacks until 1988, and the company's total spending on buybacks in 1983- 1998was $\\$3$ billion, compared with $\\$25$ billion by Exxon. Table 2 summarizes the history of distributions to shareholders by Exxon and Mobil combined from 1985 through 1998 and for ExxonMobil from 1999 through the first quarter of 2020.  \n\nTable 2: ExxonMobil, distributions to shareholders of net income (NI) as dividends (DV) and buybacks (BB), 1985-2020Q1 (fiscal years ending December31)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>NI $m</td><td>DV $m</td><td>BB $m</td><td>DV/NI %</td><td>BB/NI %</td><td>(DV+BB)/ NI%</td></tr><tr><td>1985-1994</td><td>65,075</td><td>42,454</td><td>15,501</td><td>65.24</td><td>23.82</td><td>89.06</td></tr><tr><td>1995-2004</td><td>138,376</td><td>60,235</td><td>37,707</td><td>43.53</td><td>27.25</td><td>70.78</td></tr><tr><td>2005-2014</td><td>362,240</td><td>88,568</td><td>220,435</td><td>24.45</td><td>60.85</td><td>85.30</td></tr><tr><td>2015-2019</td><td>78,880</td><td>65,994</td><td>6,983</td><td>83.66</td><td>8.85</td><td>92.52</td></tr><tr><td>2020Q1</td><td>-610</td><td>3,719</td><td>305</td><td>-609.67</td><td>-50.00</td><td>-659.67</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nSources: S&P Compustat database and ExxonMobil annual 10-K and quarterly 10-Q filings with theSEC. Note: From 1985 through 1998, the data are for Exxon and Mobil combined, and from 1999 for the merged company ExxonMobil.  \n\nAs can be seen in Table 2, ExxonMobil went wild with buybacks during the decade 2005-2014. The company had already increased its buybacks to an average of $\\$5.5$ billion per year in 2001- 2003 (86 percent of net income), and then, as oil prices soared between 2003 and 2008, increased the value of its annual buybacks six-fold, from almost $\\$6$ billion in 2003 to a peak of almost $\\$36$ billion in 2008. The 2008 figure stood as the record for stock buybacks done as open-market repurchases for any company in one year until Apple did $\\$45$ billion in 2014 (and then $\\$73$ billion in 2018, followed by $\\$67$ billion in 2019).  \n\nOil prices hit an all-time peak in July 2008, then fell dramatically from September 2008 to January 2009 with the global financial meltdown.177 As ExxonMobil's profits declined from $\\$45$ billion in 2008 to $\\$19$ billion in 2009, the company cut its buybacks from $\\$36$ billion to “only\" $\\$20$ billion, still more than its own net income and twice the buybacks done by Microsoft in that year. With annual profits averaging more than $\\$36$ billion in 2010-2014, ExxonMobil averaged $\\$17$ billion in buybacks per year. But with a precipitous collapse in oil prices in 2015, from which the industry only partially recovered in subsequent years, the company's annual profits averaged under $\\$16$ billion in 2015-2019 (less than half the average in the previous five-year period). While increasing its dividends, ExxonMobil became an also-ran in the stock-buybacks race, averaging $\\$1.4$ billion per year, declining from just over $\\$4$ billion in 2015 to $\\$594$ million in 2019.  \n\nIn March 2019, in an interview on CNBC, ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods was asked when the corporation would announce a new buyback program. He explained that the company had been making expenditures to replace its depleted oil reserves. Nevertheless, Woods went on to say that he had told Wall Street analysts concerned with ExxonMobil's stock price that the company was embarking on a $\\$15$ -billion asset-divestment program, and “our expectation is that as that begins to materialize that would go back into stock buybacks.\"178  \n\nWe call ExxonMobil's resource-allocation strategy “downsize-and-distribute.’ ExxonMobil's CEO during the years when the company was the buyback king was Rex Tillerson. He began his career with Exxon in 1975, straight out of college, and rose through the company ranks to become CEO on January 1, 2006. He left that position on January 1, 2017, to take up his appointment as Secretary of State in the Trump administration.  \n\nWhen Tillerson became CEO of ExxonMobil at the beginning of 2006, the company was ripe for extreme predatory value extraction. Soaring oil prices had increased the company's profits by 2.5 times between 2001 and 2005, even as it had downsized its labor force from 97,900 to 83,700. During his 11 years as CEO, Tillerson cut the labor force a further 15 percent, to 71,100 at end of 2016, while he oversaw the distribution of $\\$106$ billion in dividends (30 percent of net income) and $\\$207$ billion in buybacks (59 percent of net income). As his personal reward, he raked in $\\$23$ million in total remuneration, an average of $\\$20.3$ million per year, with 41 percent of it stock based. In severing all ties with ExxonMobil upon becoming Secretary of State, Tillerson worked out an agreement with the company that handed him another $\\$182$ million.179  \n\nIn addition to his Russian connections,18o Tillerson's experience with downsize-and-distribute in his years as ExxonMobil's CEO was ideal preparation for a cabinet appointment in the Trump administration. As Secretary of State, Tillerson then set out to downsize the State Department. As Dexter Filkins wrote in November 2017: “In only ten months, Tillerson, the former C.E.O. of ExxonMobil, has presided over the near-dismantling of America's diplomatic corps, chasing out hundreds of State Department employees and scaling back the country's engagement with the world.\"181 After Trump fired Tillerson on March 13, 2018, a Vox article summarized his 14-month tenure as the hollowing out of the State Department: “Under Tillerson's watch, 60 percent of State's top-ranking career diplomats resigned and new applications to join the foreign service fell by half, according to a November [2017] count by the American Foreign Service Association.\"182  \n\nIt was not, however, this agency downsizing that got Tillerson fired. A report had it that in a private meeting the Secretary of State had called President Trump a “fucking moron.\"183 In an interview nine months after being ousted from his cabinet position, Tillerson denied the moron comment but said that, while he was in total agreement with Trump's objectives, the man was “pretty undisciplined, doesn't like to read,”’ and had to be informed whenever the way he wanted to do  \n\nLazonick and Hopkins  \n\nthings that “violate[d] the law, violate[d] a treaty.\" It was not however Trump's disregard for the rule of law that troubled Tillerson; he told the interviewer that he let Trump know that he would be happy to go with him to Congress to get the applicable laws changed.184  \n\nIn terms of a social concern with the human condition, no one would confuse Rex Tillerson with Bill Gates. Yet as corporate executives, the two men have overseen the second- and third-largest lootings of corporate treasuries in history. As manifested by their willingness to do stock buybacks to manipulate their companies′ stock prices, Tillerson and Gates have been among the most fervent co-religionists in their devotion to MSV.  \n\nUntil just a few years ago, ExxonMobil and Microsoft were numbers one and two on the list of the largest stock repurchasers. With its enormous profits, Microsoft remains in the mix, while, as already observed, the current CEO of ExxonMobil is looking to sell assets so that he can give the company's stock price a manipulative boost. The new buyback leader, still massively profitable, is Apple, with, as Table 3 indicates, more buybacks in the half-decade 2015-2019 than the former number one, Exxon Mobil, did in the decade 2005-2014.  \n\nGoing back in time, Apple's $\\$1.8$ billion in buybacks in the decade 1985-1994 were carried out after the ouster in 1985 of Steve Jobs from the company he had founded nine years earlier. Under CEO John Sculley, who Jobs had recruited from Pepsi Cola, Apple became a highly financialized company run explicitly in the name of MSV.18s This profligacy almost drove Apple into bankruptcy, with net losses of $\\$186$ million in 1996 and over $\\$1$ billion in 1997. It was under these dire circumstances that in early 1997 Jobs came back to Apple as interim CEO. He then agreed with Bill Gates to put Microsoft Office on Apple computers and to make Microsoft's Internet Explorer their default browser. In return, Microsoft bailed out Apple with a $\\$150$ -million preferred-share investment,186 which was just 8.5 percent of the almost $\\$1.8$ billion in buybacks that Apple had done from 1985 through 1993.  \n\nTable 3.

Apple paid no dividends from 1997 through 2011, and the only openmarket repurchases done with Jobs in command were $\\$75$ million in 1999, $\\$116$ million in 2000, and $\\$26$ million in 2003. With the phenomenal success of, first, the iPod and iTunes, launched in 2001, and then the iPhone from 2007 and the iPad from 2010, Apple transformed itself from simply a microcomputer company into a ground-breaking communication-technology powerhouse.187  \n\nIn October 2011, at the age of 56, Jobs succumbed to pancreatic cancer. The new CEO was Tim Cook, who had joined Apple in 1998 as a senior vice president for worldwide operations. Prior to coming to Apple, Cook's main employment experience was 12 years at IBM, where he had risen to director of North American fulfillment. As a supply-chain executive, Cook was responsible for closing Apple's manufacturing facilities and outsourcing the production of Apple's devices to contract manufacturers, with Foxconn in China becoming by far the most important.188 As Apple's CEO, Cook has controlled the allocation of huge profits, but he has shown himself to be far more adept at using those profits to cash in on Apple's past rather than to take advantage of the company's privileged opportunity to finance and develop the path-breaking technologies of the future.  \n\nIn 2012, Apple paid its first dividends (equal to six percent of its net income) since 1995 and instituted a $\\$10$ -billion stock buyback program. The following year, Apple was attacked by hedgefund activist David Einhorn and, in response, increased the size of its stock-buyback program to $\\$60$ billion.189 In fiscal 2013 Apple distributed almost $\\$11$ billion in dividends and $\\$23$ billion in buybacks, the combination absorbing 90 percent of net income. From 2013 through the second quarter of fiscal 2020 (ending March 28, 2020), Apple did $\\$344$ billion in buybacks, equal to 93 percent of net income, along with $\\$93$ billion in dividends, representing an additional 25 percent of net income.  \n\nIn the summer of 2013, Carl Icahn, with going on four decades of experience as a corporate raider,19 began buying Apple shares on the stock market, and by January 2014 had amassed a stakeof $\\$3.6$ billion, representing nearly one percent of Apple's stock-market capitalization. In an article published in June 2016, we documented how Icahn had sought to drive up the price of Apple's stock through a combination of a) deployment of his “war chest\"’ accumulated as a corporate raider; b) his high level of visibility among stock-market traders; c) the hyping of Apple's future profits via Tweets (on the assumption that every discounted cent of those future profits should be captured in the current stock price); and d) his influence with, as he liked to put it, “Tim and the board.\"  \n\nIcahn's sole purpose was to realize, at an opportune moment, a gain on the sale of his Apple shares.191 It appears that, when Icahn did liquidate his Apple holdings in the first quarter of calendar year 2016 for a gain of $\\$2.0$ billion, he may have had the benefit of access to material nonpublic information on a decline of iPhone sales in China.192 During the two full fiscal years in which Icahn held his Apple shares, the company helped him out in achieving his financial bonanza: It did a then-record $\\$45$ billion in stock buybacks in 2014, followed by over $\\$35$ billion in 2015.  \n\nAs, in the winter of 2016, Icahn was selling his Apple shares, another billionaire, Warren Buffett, currently the fourth-richest person in the world, was buying Apple stock. By our estimate, between January 2016 and September 2018, Berkshire Hathaway, the financial and industrial conglomerate that Buffett controls through dual-class shares, doled out $\\$36.2$ billion (ten times what Icahn had spent) to scoop up from the stock market over 252 million Apple shares. As of March 31, 2020, with 5.6 percent of Apple's outstanding shares in its possession (second only to Vanguard, with 7.2 percent),193 Berkshire still held 245 million shares, valued at $\\$62.3$ billion. That gave Berkshire a paper gain of $\\$26$ billion even after it had realized $\\$1.7$ billion in sales of Apple shares and $\\$2.2$ billion in dividends.  \n\nDuring the three full fiscal years that Berkshire has held Apple shares, the company did buybacks valued at $\\$33$ billion in 2017, $\\$73$ billion in 2018, and $\\$67$ billion in 2019. And, as we can see in Table 3, in just the first half of fiscal 2020, Apple's buybacks were almost $\\$39$ billion. In an interview just after the May 2018 announcement of Berkshire's latest increase in its Apple shareholding, Buffett enthused: “I'm delighted to see [Apple] repurchasing shares. I love the idea of having our 5 percent, or whatever it is, maybe grow to 6 or 7 percent without our laying out a dime.\"194 The Oracle of Omaha, as Buffett is known,195 has become the new cheerleader for the corporate strategy of dominate-and-distribute.  \n\nThe irony, if one can call it that, is that Buffett has become one of the world's richest people by running Berkshire Hathaway, which he has controlled since 1964, as a retain-and-reinvest company. In 2019 Berkshire had $\\$255$ billion in revenues, placing it sixth in the Fortune 500, and (mainly because of gains on securities investments) $\\$82$ billion in net income, with 391,500 employees worldwide as of December 31, 2019. Retaining its profits for reinvestment in the growth of the company, Berkshire has not paid a dividend since 1967. Only in 2018 and 2019 did Berkshire begin doing significant open-market repurchases, distributing $\\$6.2$ billion, just over seven percent of its profits over the two years.  \n\nIn an interview in 2018, the Oracle of Omaha revealed his understanding of the importance of retain-and-reinvest: “the reason stocks are worth a whole lot more than they were 20 years ago, or 50 years ago, or a hundred years ago, is that companies have ploughed back part of the earnings \\*\"196 Berkshire has grown and profited over the decades by acquiring well-managed companies and letting them create value through investments in productive capabilities. Meanwhile, the corporate office in Omaha, Nebraska, consisting of Buffett and 26 staffers,197 aided by the dual-class share structure, has protected Berkshire's 70 subsidiaries (most of them wholly owned)198 from the pressure of the stock market to distribute cash to shareholders.  \n\nAs for Apple, “Capital Return Program\" is the official name that it gave to its system of predatory value extraction, which as of March 28, 2020 had made distributions of $\\$96$ billion in dividends since 2012 and $\\$344$ billion in buybacks since 2013.199 “Tim and the board\" (to use Icahn's phrase) should realize that this program name is ideologically laden, since these distributions of corporate cash to shareholders have nothing to do with “returning capital.\" First, as we have already observed, one cannot “return\" something to a party that never gave one anything. The only time in its history that Apple raised funds from public shareholders was on the occasion of its initial public offering in 1980, which yielded $\\$97$ million for the company.2oo Second, in distributing cash to shareholders, Apple is not giving them “capital.\" It's just transferring cash that may be used for a multitude of purposes,201 ranging from household consumption to building the war chests of corporate raiders — in the latter case, augmenting their financial power to engage in new rounds of predatory value extraction.202  \n\nNeither Carl Icahn nor Warren Buffett invested a dime in Apple's productive capabilities. Yet it is those productive capabilities that generate the sustained stream of profits that, as people who simply buy and sell shares on the stock market, Icahn and Buffett extract. And, with their “Capital Return Program, Tim Cook and the board have been extraordinarily helpful in enabling Icahn, Buffett, and others to engage in predatory value extraction.  \n\nIn 2014, as Apple was embarking on its buyback binge, Lazonick posted an open letter to CEO Cook on the Harvard Business Review (HBR) website.203 Referring to a previous HBR article in which Lazonick had pointed out that, in its history, Apple had only raised funds from the stock market at its IPO,204 Lazonick asked Cook: “How can Apple ‘return’ capital to shareholders if those shareholders never supplied Apple with capital in the first place?  \n\nAfter explaining to Cook how taxpayers and workers contribute to a company's productivity and profits, while public shareholders just buy, hold, and sell shares, Lazonick suggested ways that are consistent with an innovative business model in which Apple could use its immense profits. These included a) more compensation for tens of thousands of employees in Apple stores (not to mention hundreds of thousands of people working at companies in Apple's global supply chain), b) more educational support to enhance the career opportunities for Apple employees, especially for those in dead-end jobs in Apple stores and call centers, c) collaboration with government in social investments in knowledge and infrastructure, and d) collaboration with government in social innovation to develop the technologies of the future to meet society's needs.  \n\nLazonick did not receive a response from CEO Cook, but $\\$276$ billion in stock buybacks later, we pose the question again. Mr. Cook, please tell us why you do buybacks. We also pose the same question to the other six members of the Apple board of directors, and in particular to the two of them who have been on the board the longest.  \n\nThe Apple director with the longest tenure is Arthur D. Levinson, who has been on the board since 2000 and its chairman since late 2011. Levinson is a scientist who spent most of his career with the pioneering biopharmaceutical company Genentech, joining the firm in 1980 and becoming its CEO from 1995 to 2009 and chairman of its board from 1999 to 2014.205 From 1990, Levinson and other Genentech employees were protected from the pressures of predatory value extractors by the majority ownership of the company by F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG, a Swiss-based corporation that, better known simply as Roche, is both the least financialized and, currently, the most innovative of the global \"big pharma” companies.206 Given his employment experience, perhaps Dr. Levinson has some thoughts about how Apple might have invested a portion of the hundreds of billions of dollars that it has wasted on buybacks in a GBC to develop vaccines for preparedness for a pandemic.  \n\nThe Apple director with the second-longest tenure is Albert Arnold Gore, Jr., who has been on its board since 2003. The former U.S. vice-president and Democratic candidate for U.S. president in 2000 has been one of the world's leading activists for social awareness of the threat of global warming to human existence. One could say that what Bill Gates is to preparedness for a pandemic , Al Gore is to preparedness for the ravages of climate change.207 The difference is that Gore's Oscarwinning documentary An Inconvenient Truth, released in 2006, has had far more visibility than Gates? 2015 TED Talk, just as the world was far more aware of the dangers of global warming than those of a global pandemic —-until the Covid-19 crisis was upon us. Perhaps Mr. Gore has some thoughts about how Apple might have invested a portion of the hundreds of billions of dollars that it has wasted on buybacks in a GBC to combat climate change.  \n\nMore generally, America's corporate executives and directors need to recognize another \"inconvenient truth\": Stock buybacks manipulate the market and make most Americans worse off.2o8 Companies such as Microsoft, ExxonMobil, and Apple throw away billions, and even tens of billions, per year on buybacks without any justification other than the indefensible one that they are “returning cash to shareholders.” These executives and directors should recognize their responsibility for the failure of corporate America to deal with not only the Covid-19 pandemic but also the ravages of climate change and income inequity.  \n\nExecutives and directors are free to remain silent, but then they are complicit in the national failure to prepare for a pathogen pandemic, mitigate climate change, and reduce income inequity. In asking for an explanation of why companies do stock buybacks, we have singled out prominent executives and directors at Microsoft, ExxonMobil, and Apple because these companies are the world leaders in looting their corporate treasuries. But we can ask the same question of the senior executives and board members of many other U.s. corporations that are among the largest repurchasers of their companies? own stock.  \n\nIn particular, we pose this question to the senior executives and board members of any company engaged in the practice who, in August 2019, signed the Business Roundtable (BRT) Statement of the Purpose of a Corporation, which explicitly rejected the BRT's 1997 pronouncement that \"corporations exist principally to serve shareholders ,\"2o9 replacing it with a redefinition of “the purpose of the corporation to promote ^an economy that serves all Americans' \\*\"21o Specifically,. the 2019 BRT Statement declares “a fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders,” which includes: \\*“Delivering value to our customers\"; “Investing in our employees\"; “Dealing fairly and ethically with our suppliers\"; “Supporting the communities in which we work\"'; and “Generating long-term value for our shareholders.? We contend that, in doing massive stock buybacks as openmarket repurchases, a publicly listed business corporation will fail to meet any of these objectives, including “long-term value” for shareholders.211  \n\nIn the midst of the Covid-19 crisis, some cash-rich companies that are among the largest repurchasers, have been paying more attention to society's needs than had previously been the case.212 Highly profitable companies should, as a matter of course, be returning a portion of their profits to society, recognizing, at a minimum, the contributions of knowledge and infrastructure that society has provided to them. The attention to social crises by a corporation that adheres to MSV ideology, however, will tend to be too little too late.  \n\nFor example, of crisis-related activities recently announced by Apple, two are relevant to important GBCs in which the company could have been involved well before the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. One activity, launched in May 2020, is a $\\$10$ million investment in COPAN, a company that produces diagnostic tests.213 Apple's investment in COPAN amounts to 0.026 percent of the $\\$38.5$ billion in buybacks that the company did from September 2019 through March 2020-that is, during the six months after CEO Tim Cook signed the BRT's new Statement of the Purpose of a Corporation. Given that, in the midst of the pandemic, Apple sees fit to make this investment in diagnostic testing raises the question of why, in preparation for a pandemic, it did not enter into a large-scale GBC devoted to diagnostic testing years ago—-but rather prioritized throwing away $\\$344$ billion repurchasing its own shares since 2013.  \n\nAnother one of Apple's Covid-19 activities that has caught our attention is its $\\$100$ million “Racial Equity and Justice Initiative,’ announced on June 11, 2020.214 In a Twitter video, CEO Cook declared: \\*“The initiative will challenge the systemic barriers to opportunity and dignity that exist for communities of color and [in] particular for the black community.\"2i5 Given the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement in the midst of the Covid-19 crisis, perhaps this $\\$100$ million initiative can be seen as the Apple's commitment to the BRT Statement of Purpose of a Corporation. But that $\\$100$ million is still only 0.26 percent of the money Apple spent on buybacks in the six months after Cook signed the BRT Statement in August 2019 and 0.03 percent of the company's spending on buybacks since 2013.  \n\nOr compare this $\\$100$ million contribution to fighting racial inequity to the gains of just one person/company from trading in Apple shares. Never mind the $\\$2$ billion that corporate raider Carl Icahn took home for simply buying and selling Apple shares between 2013 and 2016. If Warren Buffett had cashed in Berkshire Hathaway's Apple shares on March 31, 2020, its total gain on its purchase of $\\$36.3$ billion between January 2016 and September 2018 would have been about $\\$30$ billion. As we have seen, Buffett/Berkshire Hathaway contributed not a dime to investing in Apple's productive capabilities. Meanwhile, supporting its share price during the time that Berkshire Hathaway bought and held shares, Apple repurchased $\\$234$ billion of its shares, which is equal to $\\$55$ billion per year.  \n\nAs one of the richest corporations in history, Apple's recognition of the problem of racial inequity in the midst of the current crisis reflects a very much belated awakening to a deep social crisis that corporate America should have confronted a very long time ago. The many trillions of dollars of corporate cash that major corporations have devoted to buybacks have been a prime reason for the extreme concentration of income among the richest households and the erosion of middle-class employment opportunities that have been the dominant \"performance” characteristics of the U.S. economy since the 1980s. The failure of the American economy since the 1980s to deliver stable and equitable employment opportunities to the mass of American workers, among whom the hardest hit have been Blacks,is deeply rooted in the rise to dominance of the destructive ideology that a business corporation should be run to “maximize shareholder value \\*\"216  \n\nLazonick and Hopkins  \n\n# References  \n\n\"America's Best Managed Companies,” Forbes, December 28, 2007, at https://www.forbes.com/global/2008/0107/075.html#289e157e7a54.   \n\"An Inconvenient Truth then and now: What's changed for our climate since 2006?

Lee, Sunil Wahal\\*  \n\nGoizueta Business School, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322-2710, USA  \n\nReceived 15 November 2002; accepted 4 September 200:  \n\n# Abstract  \n\nWe examine the role of venture capital backing in the underpricing of IPOs. Controlling for endogeneity in the receipt of venture funding, we find that venture capital backed IPOs experience larger first-day returns than comparable non-venture backed IPOs. Between 1980 and 2000, the average return difference ranges from 5.01 percentage points to 10.32 percentage points. This return difference is particularly pronounced in the “bubble” period of 1999-2000. Consistent with the grandstanding hypothesis proposed by Gompers (J. Financial Econ. 42 (1996) 133), we find that higher underpricing leads to larger future fows of capital into venture capital funds, particularly after 1996. Cross-sectionally, the effect of underpricing is attenuated for younger venture capital firms and those that have previously conducted fewer IPOs.  \n\n$\\copyright$ 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction  \n\nIn this paper, we examine the role of venture capital backing in the underpricing of initial public offerings (IPOs). We are not the first to conduct such an investigation.  \n\nThe pioneering efforts in this literature are due to Megginson and Weiss (1991) and Barry et al. (1990). Megginson and Weiss compare venture capital (VC) backed IPOs to non-VC backed IPOs matched by industry and offering size between January 1983 and September 1987. They find that the first-day returns of VC backed IPOs are significantly lower than those of non-VC backed IPOs.1 They argue that their results are consistent with the intuitively plausible idea that venture capitalists certify the true value of the firm and therefore reduce underpricing. Barry et al. focus on the monitoring role of venture capitalists in IPOs between 1978 and 1987 and find that the ownership, the length of board service, and the number of venture capitalists invested in the pre-IPO firm are negatively related to IPO underpricing. Based on this correlation, they conclude that venture capitalists are “recognized by capital markets through lower underpricing for IPOs with better monitors’ (p. 447).  \n\nSince the publication of these two studies, a stream of research seeking to understand the provision of venture financing has emerged.? Sahlman (1990) reports that “although a typical large venture capital firm receives up to 1,000 proposals each year, it invests in only a dozen or so new companies\" (p. 475). Kaplan and Stromberg (2002） use unique data to describe the due diligence and analyses conducted by venture capitalists prior to the provision of financing. They show how the characteristics of and risks inherent in entrepreneurial ventures translate into specific contractual provisions with entrepreneurs. Other studies characterize the contracting environment between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists as one in which the provision of venture financing is linked to the allocation of cash flow and control rights (Sahlman, 1990; Gompers and Lerner, 1996; Black and Gilson, 1998; Hellman, 1998; Kaplan and Stromberg 2001, 2002). Such allocations take place through covenants on securities exchanged for cash, in the distribution of ownership and voting rights, and in the assignment of board seats. Both the ex ante analyses conducted by venture capitalists, and the contracts designed to mitigate information and agency problems, suggest that venture financing represents an endogenous choice made by entrepreneurs and venture capitalists - the receipt of venture funding is the outcome of protracted negotiations between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs.  \n\nThis choice is reflected in the nonrandom distribution and characteristics of VC backed IPOs. We examine a sample of over 6,413 IPOs between 1980 and 2000, of whichover $37\\%$ (2,383) are VC backed. VC backed IPOs show significant clustering across both industry and geographical dimensions. We find that venture financing is disproportionately provided to firms in technology-intensive industries, particularly software and commercial biological research. Consistent with the results of Lerner (1995) and Gompers and Lerner (1998), over $50\\%$ of all venture backed IPO firms in our sample are headquartered in California, Massachusetts, and Texas, states with high concentrations of venture capitalists. We also find differences in the characteristics of firms taken public by venture capitalists. Venture capitalists generally take smaller and younger firms public. These firms have lower revenues than non-VC backed firms and are less likely to be profitable. On average, VC backed IPOs employ higher quality underwriters but raise less cash than non-VC backedIPOs.  \n\nOur interest is in the underpricing of VC backed IPOs. In an ideal world, we would want to observe underpricing for a VC backed IPO and the underpricing that the same IPO would experience had it not received venture financing. This would allow us to make causal inferences about the effect of venture backing on IPO underpricing. Unfortunately, given the nonexperimental nature of the data, what we actually observe is the underpricing for a VC backed IPO and the underpricing for a non-VC backed IPO. If the provision of venture financing were random, one could simply compute differences between the first-day returns of VC backed and non-VC backed IPOs. The traditional approach would be to match VC backed IPOs to non-VC backed IPOs based on a set of characteristics and attribute the difference in underpricing to venture backing, or to estimate OLS regressions with a dummy variable for VC backing. Using such regressions, Bradley and Jordan (2002) conclude that once they control for industry effects and underwriter quality, there is no difference in underpricing between VC backed and non-VC backed IPOs. Gompers and Lerner (1997) question the certification hypothesis and show that the underpricing differential between VC backed and non-VC backed IPOs is sensitive to both estimation periods and methodologies. Although controls are undeniably important, the crux of our problem is that venture backing is not randomly distributed, but represents an endogenous choice. This introduces a selectivity bias, one that can easily reverse inferences.  \n\nTo account for this bias, we use matching methods that endogenize the receipt of venture financing and do not impose linearity or function form restrictions (see, for example, Rubin, 1974, 1977; Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983; Dehejia and Wahba, 1999). The basic intuition behind these procedures is to use a first-stage regression to predict the receipt of venture funding. Estimates from this first-stage regression are then fed into various methods of matching non-VC backed IPOs to VC backed IPOs. Addressing the endogeneity issue directly produces results that are strikingly different from earlier empirical studies. Over the entire sample period, the average first-day return of VC backed IPOs is larger than non-venture backed IPOs. The return difference ranges from a minimum of 5.0 percentage points to a maximum of 10.3 percentage points, with standard errors of 1.8 and 2.1 percentage points respectively. These return differentials are statistically significant and economically important. The average underpricing of all IPOs over the sample period is about $18.0\\%$ . Using the smallest estimate (5.0 percentage points), the underpricing differential as a proportion of total underpricing is $28.0\\%$  \n\nBecause there is pronounced non-stationarity in the volume and underpricing of IPOs (Ritter and Welch, 2002; Loughran and Ritter, 2002a), we examine the underpricing differential over various subperiods. In particular, it is possible that our results are entirely due to the internet bubble period of 1999-2000. We find that the average underpricing differential between VC backed and non-VC backed IPOs is 25.0 percentage points in 1999-2000 and 2.0 percentage points in 1980-1998, with standard errors of approximately 9.9 and 1.0 percentage points respectively. Again, the underpricing differential is statistically significant and economically important in both subperiods. The average underpricing of IPOs in 1980-1998 is $11.0\\%$ Therefore, the 2.0 percentage point differential represents almost $20\\%$ of total underpricing. Another way to assess the economic magnitude of these return differentials is to calculate the incremental amount of money left on the table in VC backed IPOs. Loughran and Ritter (2002b) calculate this amount as the number of shares issued multiplied by the difference between the closing price on the first day of trading and the offer price. Using their metric, the average amount of money left on the table for non-VC backed IPOs in our sample is \\$27 million. The average first-day return for the non-VC backed IPOs is $13.4\\%$ . Again, using our smallest estimate of the return differential (5.0 percentage points), this implies an additional $\\$10$ million left on the table by VC backed IPOs. Even excluding the bubble period, similar calculations suggest an additional \\$4 million left on the table.  \n\nVenture capitalists typically retain a large fraction of their equity holdings subsequent to an IPO; Megginson and Weiss (1991) report that on average, venture capitalistsown $36.6\\%$ of the firm prior to the IPO and $26.3\\%$ immediately thereafter. Greater underpricing represents a real cost to the venture capital fund because there is a transfer of wealth to new shareholders. Why would venture capitalists bear this cost? It is possible that the first-day return differentials are due to our inability to perfectly account for endogeneity and for differences between VC backed and non-VC backed firms. While no endogeneity correction or system of controls is perfect, our results are robust to a variety of specifications.  \n\nOne explanation is that venture capitalists receive some quid pro quo for leaving more money on the table. It is possible that underwriters preferentially allocate shares of other underpriced IPOs to venture capital firms in exchange for greater underpricing in the VC's own portfolio firm. Loughran and Ritter (2002a) provide examples in which VC firms were allocated hot IPOs that were subsequently flipped for immediate profits. Recent legal investigations into IPO practices also support this scenario (see, for example, “Something ventured, something gained?,”’ Wall Street Journal, 10/17/2002). However, such activity occurred largely in 1999 and 2000. The underpricing differential appears in earlier periods as well. Therefore, we doubt that such quid pro quo arrangements can explain our results.  \n\nA more likely explanation lies in the grandstanding hypothesis proposed by Gompers (1996). Venture capital firms create limited partnerships (\"venture capital funds') to raise and invest capital. These funds have finite lives, typically ten years, after which they must liquidate their investments and return money to the original providers (institutional investors such as pension funds and endowments). Although VC firms can realize returns through acquisitions as well as IPOs of their portfolio firms, the majority of returns are created by taking companies public. Because of this, establishing a reputation as a VC firm that is capable of taking portfolio companies public is critical to future fundraising. Gompers (1996) describes examples in which VC firms that are unable to take portfolio companies public are unable to raise future capital. He also describes converse examples of VC firms that, once they take a portfolio company public, are quickly able to raise additional capital. Since establishing reputation is critical to future fundraising, VC firms are willing to bear the cost of underpricing because taking a company public signals quality. Gompers (1996) argues that cross-sectionally, fundraising is less of a problem for older VC firms because their reputations are already established. In contrast, less-established VC firms need to signal quality by taking portfolio companies public. As a result, they are more willing to bear the cost of higher underpricing. Consistent with this argument, he finds that younger VC firms grandstand by taking younger companies public and allowing_ greater underpricing. This enables young VC firms to raise more capital in the future than they would otherwise. If grandstanding is responsible for our results, then underpricing should have a larger effect on the fundraising ability of low-reputation VC firms. Also, such VC firms should be more likely to take smaller and younger companies public.  \n\nTo determine if these effects are present in our data, we first create two subsamples of VC-backed IPOs with different definitions for the “lead’ VC firm in the IPO. Specifically, we identify the lead venture capital firm as the VC firm with the earliest investment, or the VC firm with the largest investment. We then estimate fundraising regressions similar to Gompers (1996) for both subsamples. The dependent variable in these regressions is the size of the next fund raised by the lead VC firm after the IPO. The primary independent variables of interest are proxies for VC reputation (VC age and the number of previous IPOs done by the VC), IPO underpricing, and interaction effects of reputation proxies with underpricing.  \n\nThe regressions show that the fow of capital into the lead VC firm is positively related to VC age and the number of previous IPOs done by the VC firm. This indicates that more-reputable venture capital firms are able to raise more money. The future fow of capital is also positively related to underpricing, implying that there is a benefit to bearing the cost of underpricing. Most important, the interaction effects between VC age and underpricing, and between the number of prior IPOs and underpricing, are negative. Consistent with grandstanding, this suggests that underpricing has a larger effect on the ability of young VC firms, or those that have done fewer IPOs, to raise future capital. Since the grandstanding explanation also predicts that low-reputation VC firms are more likely to take smaller and younger companies public, we also estimate regressions of both measures of reputation on IPO characteristics. We find that younger VC firms, and those that have previously done fewer IPOs, tend to take smaller and younger companies public.  \n\nThere is a marked increase in the number of new firms entering the venture capital industry in the late 1990s, roughly corresponding to the increase in IPO activity. Aggregate data show that on average, 33 new firms entered the industry annually between 1980 and 1996. Between 1997 and 2000, this more than tripled to 106 new firms entering the industry every year. If the entry of new firms increases competition, there may be a change in the willingness of incumbent firms to bear the cost of underpricing to raise further capital. We estimate fundraising regressions for the 1980-1996 and 1997-2000 subperiods separately and find that the sensitivity of future capital fows to underpricing is higher in the later subperiod. Interestingly, the interaction effects between reputation and underpricing are significant in both periods, suggesting that the cross-sectional effects have not changed.  \n\nThese results favor the grandstanding explanation. However, we also consider other explanations. Gompers (1996) describes the “recycling hypothesis”’ as one in which investors in venture capital firms plough their profits from earlier funds back into new funds raised by the same venture capital firms. However, the recycling hypothesis does not explain why some VC firms would receive more capital, or why underpricing would have larger effects for low-reputation VC firms. Another possibility is a prospect theory explanation advanced by Loughran and Ritter (2002b). Under their explanation, issuers ignore the wealth loss from underpricing because they sum this wealth loss with the wealth gain from the IPO itself. This implies that the positive relation between underpricing and future capital flows could simply be an IPO effect, rather than an underpricing effect. To separate the two effects, we compile a sample of all venture capital firms that are in existence in a given year for the 2l-year period. This sample includes both VC firms that took a company public and those that did not. We then estimate two-stage Heckman selection regressions that account for the fact that underpricing is only observed when a company is taken public. The firststage regression predicts whether a VC firm does an IPO in that year and feeds into a second-stage regression that models capital inflows as a function of IPO underpricing. The coefficient on IPO underpricing is positive and significant in the second-stage regression, implying that underpricing has a positive effect on future capital inflows, even after correcting for the observability bias.  \n\nTaken together, the evidence suggests that the grandstanding behavior originally documented by Gompers (1996) plays an important role in describing the costs that venture capitalists are willing to bear in taking their portfolio companies public. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes our data and sample construction. Section 3 describes the methodological approach and provides the basic underpricing results. Section 4 describes the capital flow regressions. Section 5 describes various robustness checks and examines alternative explanations. Section 6 concludes.  \n\n# 2. Data  \n\nOur sample of IPOs comes from data provided by Jay Ritter. This dataset includes accumulated corrections made by him to IPO data from a variety of sources. The data include offering dates, offering prices, file price ranges, closing prices, SIC codes, and underwriter rankings. Underwriter rankings are based on an amended version of the Carter and Manaster (1990) and Carter et al. (1998) rankings and are described in Loughran and Ritter (2002a). The rankings range in value from 0 to 9, with higher values indicating higher quality rankings. Also included is a dummy variable that identifies VC backed IPOs and a second dummy variable that identifies internet-related firms. Unit offerings and IPOs with an offer price of less than $\\$5.00$ are not included. This database contains 6,997 IPOs between 1980 and 2000. We eliminate IPOs without valid cusip numbers, perm numbers, and underwriter rankings, resulting in a sample of 6,413 IPOs over the 21-year period.  \n\nWe supplement this IPO database with information from the new issues database of Securities Data Corporation (SDC). For each IPO, we collect information on net proceeds, the number of shares in the offering, the book value of equity per share prior to the offering, revenue just after the offering, earnings per share up to two years prior to the offering, the firm's total assets prior to the offering, founding date, and the state in which the firm is headquartered.  \n\nAs reported by other researchers, there are missing value problems associated with several of these data items. Founding dates are missing in SDC for approximately $75\\%$ of our sample. We update information on firm founding dates for $25\\%$ of the sample from data provided by Alexander Ljungqvist; data collection procedures employed by him are described in Ljungqvist and Wilhelm (2003). Thus, age information is available for approximately $50\\%$ of the IPOs in our sample. Missing value problems are also significant for earnings per share. Since sample sizes shrink when we use these data, we report results both with and without these data items.  \n\nIn addition to IPO and firm-level information, our tests also require specific information about venture capital investment in these firms. We obtain supplemental data on VC participation from the Venture Economics data obtained through SDC. The Venture Economics database has been extensively described and analyzed by Lerner (1994, 1995), Gompers (1995, 1996), and Gompers and Lerner (1998). From this database, we collect information on the number of venture capital firms with an investment in each IPO at the time of the offering, the round dates and dollar value of each investment, the founding date and size of each venture capital firm, and the amount of capital raised by each venture capital firm in the calendar year following the IPO.  \n\nSome of our capital flow regressions require us to build a database of VC firms in existence each year. This requires knowledge of founding dates, mergers, consolidations, name changes, and other such events that can infuence the existence of a venture capital firm in any given year. Such data items are frequently not available, and when they are, they are notoriously “dirty.\" To bypass some of these problems, we start with a listing of all venture capital firms in existence in 2003. Venture Economics lists the fundraising status of each firm in one of four categories: actively seeking new investment, inactive/unknown, reducing investment activity, and making few, if any, new investments. In many cases, Venture Economics also leaves this field blank. We regard the VC firm as being “alive' if it is actively seeking new investments. If the status field is missing or is labeled “inactive/unknown,” and if the venture firm has not made any investments in the last five years, we regard the firm as being “dead.\"’ This information is accurate as of 2003 but unfortunately Venture Economics does not maintain information on historical status. Therefore, we build the database recursively using paper sources. To do this, we take the 2003 database and check every entry against historical records in annual issues of Pratt's Guide to Venture Capital Sources going back to 1980. Pratt's Guide lists VC firms in existence in each year and provides basic descriptive information about each firm, such as founding date, funds under management, etc.  \n\n# 3. Results  \n\n## 3.1. Unadjusted first-day returns  \n\nTable 1 shows the number of IPOs and average first-day returns. First-day returns are calculated as the percentage price movement from the offering price to the closing price on the first day of trading. For VC backed IPOs, we present raw firstday returns, and frst-day returns of matched non-VC backed IPOs using a methodology similar to Megginson and Weiss (1991). (The returns for non-matched, non-VC backed IPOs are not shown in the table.) Each VC backed IPO is matched with a (single) non-VC backed IPO in the same three-digit SIC code and closest in net proceeds. However, their sample period is from January 1983 to September 1987. In our longer period, an exact replication of their matching procedure could potentially match VC backed IPOs with non-VC backed IPOs 20 years apart. Therefore, our modified matching procedure also requires that the non-VC backed IPO take place within two years of the VC backed IPO. The table shows average return differences between the VC backed IPOs and matched non-VC backed IPOs andassociated $t$ statistics.  \n\nTable1 Unadjusted first-day returns for VC backed and “matched”’ non-VC backed IPOs First-day returns are calculated as the percentage change in price from the offer price to the closing price of the stock on the first day of trading. For VC backed IPOs, raw first-day returns are presented. For nonVC backed IPOs, only “matched” returns are presented. Following Megginson and Weiss (1991), each VC backed IPO is matched with a (single) non-VC backed IPO in the same three-digit SIC code and with the closest net proceeds. In addition, the matching procedure also requires that the non-VC backed IPO take place between two years before and two years after the VC backed IPO. Statistics are presented for the full sample of IPOs from 1980 to 2000, the Megginson and Weiss (1991) sample (MW) from 1983 to September 1987, a “partial Barry (1990) sample from 1980 to 1987, and for various subperiods.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Sample</td><td colspan=\"2\">VC backedIPOs</td><td>Non-VC backed IPOs</td><td rowspan=\"2\">Return</td><td rowspan=\"2\">T-statistic</td></tr><tr><td>Number of IPOs</td><td>First-day return</td><td>\"Matched\"first-day return</td></tr><tr><td>Full sample</td><td>2,208</td><td>26.82</td><td>19.36</td><td>7.45</td><td>5.99</td></tr><tr><td>(1980-2000) MW sample</td><td>314</td><td>6.72</td><td>8.20</td><td>-1.48</td><td>1.12</td></tr><tr><td>(1983-1987) BMPV sample</td><td>402</td><td>7.66</td><td>8.91</td><td>-1.25</td><td>0.62</td></tr><tr><td>(1980-1987)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Subperiods</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1980-1989 1990-1998</td><td>471 1,304</td><td>7.89 16.17</td><td>8.50 16.70</td><td>-0.61 -0.53</td><td>0.62</td></tr><tr><td>1999</td><td>238</td><td>88.93</td><td>42.02</td><td>46.90</td><td>0.54 6.17</td></tr><tr><td>2000</td><td>194</td><td>67.89</td><td>35.70</td><td>32.19</td><td>4.63</td></tr><tr><td>1980-1998</td><td>1,775</td><td>13.97</td><td>14.53</td><td>-0.55</td><td>0.72</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThe average first-day return of VC backed IPOs is $26.8\\%$ versus $19.4\\%$ for matched non-VC backed IPOs - a difference of over seven percentage points with a $t$ -statistic of 5.9. Thus, at first blush, a longer time series suggests that VC backing of IPOs is associated with higher, rather than lower, underpricing. This appears inconsistent with the results of Megginson and Weiss, so we attempt to replicate their sample. To do so, we retain all observations in which the offering date is between January 1983 and September 1987. This produces a subsample of $314\\mathrm{IPOs}$ . For this subsample, the average return difference between VC backed and non-VC backed IPOs is $-1.5$ percentage points with a $t\\cdot$ statistic of 1.1. By way of comparison, Megginson and Weiss (1991) document an average return difference of $-4.8$ percentage points with a $t$ -statistic of 3.6 in a sample of $320\\mathrm{IPOs}$ . The discrepancy between Megginson and Weiss's results and our modified replication could be due to two reasons. First, Megginson and Weiss (1991, footnote 5) report that due to a large concentration of VC backed firms in the Office, Computing & Accounting Machines industry as well as the Electronic Components & Accessories industry, they include 18 non-VC backed IPOs priced at less than \\$5, or offering amounts less than $\\$3$ million (which otherwise serve as data exclusionary criteria). We do not include such IPOs. Second, as mentioned above, our matching procedure is slightly different from theirs in that we require that the matched IPO take place between two years before and two years after the VC backed IPO. Megginson and Weiss do not employ such a restriction.  \n\nTable 1 also reports average underpricing for a subsample that represents a partial overlap with Barry et al. (1990). Barry et al.'s sample consists of IPOs between 1978 and 1987. Since our sample period starts in 1980, we construct a partially overlapping subsample of IPOs between 1980 and 1987. For this subsample, the average return difference is $-1.3$ percentage points with a $t\\cdot$ -statistic of 0.6. This result, in conjunction with those of the Megginson and Weiss subsample, suggests time-series instability in the differences between first-day returns of VC backed and non-VC backed IPOs. Ritter and Welch (2002) suggest that many IPO phenomena are nonstationary. Therefore, we also present first-day returns for various subperiods. In the decade of the 1980s, the first-day return difference between VC backed and non-VC backed IPOs is $-0.6$ percentage points ( $\\mathbf{\\rho}_{t}$ -statistic $=0.6$ ). In the 1990s (but excluding 1999), the return difference is very similar in magnitude and significance ( $(-0.5$ percentage points with a $t$ -statistic of 0.5). However, as with many IPO phenomena, 1999 and 2000 are fundamentally different. For 1999, the average first-day return for VC backed IPOs is 46.9 percentage points higher than for nonVC backed IPOs ( $t$ -statistic $=6.2\\AA,$ 0. For 2000, the average return difference is 32.2 percentage points ( $t$ -statistic $=4.6$ ). Thus, not only did average underpricing increase dramatically during 1999-2000, but return differentials based on the modified Megginson and Weiss (1991) benchmark also increased substantially. Excluding 1999-2000 from the sample, the average return difference between VC backed and non-VC backed IPOs drops  to $-0.6$ percentage  points  and  is  statistically insignificant ( $i$ -statistic $=0.7$  \n\n## 3.2. Endogeneity: theory and evidence  \n\nAs we argue in the introduction, the provision and receipt of venture funding represents the outcome of an endogenous choice by entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. Not all entrepreneurs desire venture financing and not all entrepreneurs receive it. Megginson and Weiss (1991) explicitly recognize this and state that “the cost and stringency of VC investment, as well as the sheer difficulty in obtaining it ... implies that only those firms which would benefit most from the services venture capitalists provide will be willing and able to accept such participation' (p. 882). The choice is evident in the rich array of contracts designed to allocate cash fow and control rights in entrepreneurial firms (Sahlman, 1990; Gompers and Lerner, 1996; Black and Gilson, 1998; Hellman, 1998; Kaplan and Stromberg,2001,2002).  \n\nThe endogenous choice is reflected not only in the provision of financing by venture capitalists but also in their eventual exit from the entrepreneurial venture. Nonrandom endogenous choices in the provision of financing are refected in the nonrandom distribution and characteristics of VC backed IPOs. Panel A of Table 2 shows the industry distribution of VC backed IPOs across two-digit SIC codes that represent at least $1\\%$ of the sample (at least $23\\mathrm{IPOs}$ 0. Across all industries, VC backed IPOs represent $37\\%$ of all IPOs. However, there is significant variation across industries, from a low of zero (in the Hotels and Lodging, SIC code 70) to a high of $58\\%$ (in Chemicals and Allied Products, SIC code 28). A $\\chi^{2}$ test rejects the null hypothesis of equality of distributions across industries with a $p$ -value of 0.00. We also examine industries in which VC backed IPOs are concentrated in absolute rather than relative terms. We find large clusters in software firms (SIC code 7372) and firms conducting commercial biological research (SIC code 8731). The former represent $11\\%$ of all VC backed IPOs and the latter represent $3\\%$  \n\nIn addition to industry clustering, our data also show geographic concentrations.4 In Panel B, we show VC backed IPOs as a percentage of all IPOs for the state in which the firm is headquartered. We display this distribution only for states that represent at least $2\\%$ of all IPOs (at least 121 IPOs). Here, too, the data show large variation. For IPOs of firms headquartered in Florida, $20.9\\%$ are venture backed. The corresponding figures for California and Massachusetts are $56.8\\%$ and $60.7\\%$ In fact, the largest number of VC backed IPOs emerge from three states: California (803), Massachusetts (246), and Texas (152). Collectively, these three states represent over $50\\%$ of all VC backed IPOs. This degree of concentration is not surprising. As Lerner (1995) shows, geographic distance adds to the cost of monitoring portfolio  \n\nPanel A shows the distribution of VC backed IPOs across two-digit SIC codes. The percentage of VC backed IPOs as a proportion of all IPOs in that SIC code is shown. SIC codes in which there are less than 23 VC backed IPOs over the entire sample period are not shown (corresponding to $1\\%$ of all VC backed IPOs). Panel B shows the geographic distribution of VC backed IPOs. The percentage of VC backed IPOs as a proportion of all IPOs of firms headquartered in that state are shown. States with less than $121\\mathrm{IPOs}$ correspondingto $2\\%$ of all IPOs, are not shown. Panel C shows the time-series distribution of VC backed IPOs as a proportion of all IPOs for each calendar year. Panel D provides means of various characteristics of VC backed and non-VC backed IPOs, along with associated $t$ -statistics. Net proceeds are in millions of dollars. Age is the average number of years from the founding date to the IPO date. The gross spread is in percent. The book value per share is in dollars prior to the offering date. Revenue per share is as of prior to the offering. The percentage of positive earnings per share (EPS) is from up to two years prior to the offering. Total assets are in millions of dollars prior to the offering.  \n\nTable2 Distribution and characteristics of VC backed and non-VC backed IPOs   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>2-digit

\n\nIt is well known that there are waves in IPO activity (see Ibbotson and Jaffe, 1975; Ritter, 1984; and more recently, Lowry and Schwert, 2002). This is also refected in the time-series distribution of VC backed IPOs. Panel C of Table 2 shows the distribution of VC backed IPOs for each calendar year. On average, approximately $25-30\\%$ of all IPOs are VC backed. Most notable, however, is the dramatic increase in the percentage of VC backed IPOs in 1999-2000. In these two years, VC backed IPOs represent over $50\\%$ of all IPOs.  \n\nFinally, the fact that venture capitalists invest in particular types of firms is reflected in both firm and IPO characteristics. Panel D shows five firm-level characteristics for VC and non-VC backed IPOs prior to the offering: total assets (in $\\mathbb{S}$ millions), the book value of equity per share, revenue per share, the percentage of firms with positive earnings per share, and the age of the firm in months. VC backed IPOs take place in younger, smaller firms with lower book values of equity, lower revenues, and smaller assets. In addition, these firms are less likely to be profitable. The panel also shows the average net proceeds from the offering, the average underwriter rank, and the average gross spread. Consistent with Chen and Ritter (2000), gross spreads are approximately $7\\%$ and are not different between VC and non-VC backed IPOs. However, VC backed IPOs are generally smaller (average net proceeds are $\\$40.5$ million compared to $\\$58.3$ for non-VC backed IPOs, with a $t$ -statistic of 5.4), and, on average, use higher quality underwriters (7.8 versus 6.7 with a $t\\cdot$ -statistic of 21.0).  \n\n## 3.3. Selection bias adjusted estimates  \n\n### 3.3.1. A methodological solution  \n\nMuch of the descriptive evidence reported in Table 2 is not new. Gompers and Lerner (2000) and Megginson (2004) report similar industry and geographic concentrations, and Megginson and Weiss (1991), Barry et al. (1990), Gompers and Lerner (1997), and Bradley and Jordan (2002) report differences in characteristics of VC backed and non-VC backed IPOs. The nonrandomness of these data suggests that we can use this information to construct instruments that have some power in predicting the receipt of venture funding. There are also other good candidates for instruments. For example, Hellman and Puri (2002) report that VC backing is related to the adoption of stock option plans and the hiring of a marketing VP. However, such instruments require detailed data that we do not possess and that are not available from public sources.  \n\nThe methodology that we employ accounts for endogenous choice in a matching framework, allowing causal inference in nonexperimental settings. Such methods are widely used in statistics and labor economics. Following the notation in Heckman et al. (1998), we define $Y_{1}$ as the one-day return for an IPO with VC backing, $Y_{0}$ as the one-day return for the same IPO without VC backing, and $D=1$ if the firm received VC backing (and zero otherwise). We are interested in $Y_{1}-Y_{0}$ However, this is unobservable for an individual firm because a firm either does or does not receive VC backing. The solution is to estimate the average effect of venture backing at the population level. We are interested in the average effect of VC backing on VC backed IPOs, $\\mathrm{E}(Y_{1}-Y_{0}|D=1,X)$ , where $X$ is a vector of firm and/ or industry characteristics. This could be estimated if we recognize the following condition:  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname{E}(Y_{1}-Y_{0}|D=1,X)=\\operatorname{E}(Y_{1}|D=1,X)-\\operatorname{E}(Y_{0}|D=1,X).\n$$  \n\n$\\mathsf E(Y_{1}|D=1,X)$ is the average one-day return for VC backed IPOs. However, $\\operatorname{E}(Y_{0}|D=1,X)$ , the average return VC backed IPOs would experience if they did not receive VC backing, is unavailable, at least in such nonexperimental data. The traditional  approach  is  to  use $\\operatorname{E}(Y_{0}|D=0,X)$ , the average return of non-VC backed IPOs, instead. Unfortunately, because VC backing is not randomly assigned but represents an endogenous choice, this introduces a bias. This bias is formally  \n\ndefined as  \n\n$$\nB(X)=\\operatorname{E}(Y_{0}|D=1,X)-\\operatorname{E}(Y_{0}|D=0,X).\n$$  \n\nRubin (1974,1977) and Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) show that under certain conditions, matching on $P r(D=1|X)$ eliminates  the bias and  reduces the dimensionality of the problem. Specifically, Rosenbaum and Rubin propose the propensity score method as a way to implement matching while eliminating the bias. This method requires the estimation of a probit model for the endogenous choice variable $\\overset{\\vartriangle}{\\mathcal{D}}=1$ for VC backing, zero otherwise) with a vector of $X$ variables.The predicted probability is then used as the propensity score and each VC backed IPO is matched with the non-VC backed IPO with the highest propensity score.  \n\nThe propensity score method is an example of “nearest neighborhood” matching and is a one-to-one matching technique. It therefore discards data that are potentially valuable. It is also possible to match each VC backed IPO with more than one comparable non-VC backed IPO. Such one-to-many matching estimators fall under the rubric of “smoothed weighted matching estimators,” and are proposed and implemented by Heckman et al. (1997, 1998). The intuition behind these is to use the weighted average of the outcomes of several (or perhaps all) non-VC backed IPOs. The weight given to each non-VC backed IPO is in proportion to the \"closeness” of the vector of observables. We employ two versions of such one-tomany matching estimators. The first is a kernel estimator that uses a distribution to specify weights. We use a Gaussian kernel in our primary implementation but use other distributions as robustness checks (see Section 3.4.1). The second, known as regression-adjusted local linear matching, uses “local” weights (that is, it uses only part of the non-VC backed sample) and performs a local regression on $X$ toestimate Weights.  \n\nAll matching is conducted with replacement. Using each matching estimator, we calculate the difference between the first-day return of a VC backed IPO and the matched first-day return of non-VC backed IPO(s). Rather than rely on assumed distributions of return differences, we use bootstrapped standard errors to conduct statistical inference. The bootstrapping is based on 50 replications. We also calculate selection-bias-adjusted $95\\%$ confidence intervals.  \n\n### 3.3.2. First-day return differences  \n\nTable 3 shows average selection-bias-adjusted first-day return differences between VC backed and non-VC backed IPOs using the propensity score method, the Gaussian kernel, and the regression-adjusted local linear method. Bootstrapped standard errors appear in parentheses and $95\\%$ confidence intervals are in square brackets.  \n\nThe choice of instrumental variables used in the first stage of each method is critical to removing the selection bias. Given the industry and geographic concentrations of VC backed IPOs, SIC code and headquarter-state dummy variables are natural candidates. Time-series variation in IPOs, and the presence of \"hot'’ markets, suggests that it is also important to control for calendar effects.  \n\nTable3 Selection bias adjusted first-day return differences between VC backed and non-VC backed IPOs The table presents selection bias adjusted average return differences between VC and non-VC backed IPOs, their standard errors and $95\\%$ confidence intervals. Each VC backed IPO is matched with one or many non-VC backed IPOs using the propensity score, Gaussian kernel, and regression-adjusted local linear matching approaches described in the text. Panel A uses the logarithm of net proceeds, two-digit SIC code dummies, calendar year dummies, headquarter-state dummies and underwriter ranks as instrumental variables in each matching approach. Panel B adds book value per share scaled by offering price, revenue per share scaled by offering price, and total assets per share scaled by offering price to the Panel A instruments. Panel C adds an earnings per share dummy variable (equal to one for positive earnings and zero otherwise) to the instruments in Panel B. For each matching approach, the table presents the average difference in first-day return of the VC backed and matched non-VC backed IPOs.

To distinguish the effect of VC backing from investment banker (underwriter) quality, we use underwriter rank as an instrument. Since the results in Panel D of Table 2 show substantial differences in net proceeds, total assets, book value of equity, revenue, and profitability between VC backed and non-VC backed IPOs, we also use these variables as instruments.  \n\nGiven the missing value problem associated with some of these data items, we present our results in three panels in which we incrementally add instruments that have missing data. Panel A presents our basic model in which we use the logarithm of net proceeds, two-digit SIC code dummies, calendar year dummies, headquarterstate dummies and underwriter rank in the first-stage regression. Most of these data items are non-missing and the estimates produced by these instruments are based on a relatively complete sample size (2,277 VC backed IPOs). The pseudo- $R^{2}$ of the firststage regression is relatively high (0.22), suggesting that these instruments are good predictors of VC backing. (We do not display the first-stage regressions in the interest of conserving space.) In Panel B, we add book value per share scaled by offering price, revenue per share scaled by offering price, and total assets per share scaled by offering price to this basic model. The pseudo- $\\cdot R^{2}$ increases marginally to 0.23, but the sample size drops to 1,490. Finally, in Panel C, we add a dummy variable equal to one if the firm has positive earnings per share and zero otherwise. This variable significantly increases the pseudo- $\\cdot R^{2}$ to 0.28 but drastically decreases the sample size to 599.  \n\nPanel A shows that in the full sample, with the propensity score method, the average difference in first-day returns is 9.5 percentage points. The standard error of thisestimateis $1.8\\%$ andthe $95\\%$ confidence interval is between 7.9 and 12.6 percentage points. The average estimates using the Gaussian kernel and regressionadjusted local linear matching approach are somewhat lower (6.9 and 6.2 percentage points, respectively) but are still highly statistically significant (standard errors are approximately 1.7 percentage points for both methods). The estimates in Panel B range from a low of 8.4 to a high of 10.3 percentage points with standard errors of about 2 percentage points. The addition of earnings per share information in Panel C reduces the differential to approximately 5 percentage points but the estimate remains statistically significant. Since the estimates in Panel C are based on 599 observations, they are not directly comparable to those in Panels A and B.  \n\nGiven the time-series variation in first-day returns documented in Table 1 and, in particular, the dramatically higher underpricing in 1999-2000, we also show separate estimates for the 1999-2000 and 1980-1998 subperiods.We do not calculate subperiod estimates by partitioning the full sample results because the latter are obtained from a first-stage regression that uses all the data. Instead, we reestimate the first-stage regression for each subperiod, thereby “tightening’ the conditioning information and producing more conservative estimates. In Panel A, the average first-day return difference for 1999-2000 using the propensity score method is 25.5 percentage points. For the Gaussian kernel and regression-adjusted local linear matching method, the return differences are 32.0 and 32.8 percentage points, respectively. The standard errors of the estimates for this sample period are also higher (between 8 and 9 percentage points). The differentials remain statistically significant and the $95\\%$ confidence intervals do not include zero. The estimates in Panel B are similar. Adding earnings per share information in Panel C causes such a severe loss of observations in the subperiod 1999-2000 that we cannot produce estimates.  \n\nThe average difference in underpricing between VC backed and non-VC backed IPOs is much smaller in 1980-1998. In Panel A, using the propensity score method, the average first-day return difference is 2.2 percentage points. The other estimators produce return differences of 1.5 and 1.3 percentage points. Note, however, that there is also a large decline in the standard errors associated with these differences. For example, the standard error of the 2.2 percentage point propensity score method estimate is 1.1 percentage points. The estimates in Panel B are generally larger and but with similar standard errors. In Panel C, for the 1980-1998 subperiod, the return differentials range from 2.1 to 2.86 percentage points with standard errors of approximately 1.0 percentage points. In general, the return differentials in the 1980-1998 are smaller, but remain statistically significant.  \n\nIt is important to put the size of these estimates in economic terms. One way to do so is to compare the average return difference to average underpricing for all IPOs during that period. In the full sample, average underpricing is about $18\\%$ . Therefore, the first-day return differential of about 5 percentage points represents a significant portion $(28\\%)$ of average underpricing. In 1999-2000, the average return differential of 25 percentage points represents $49\\%$ of total average underpricing over this period (which was $51\\%$ ). Even in the 1980-1998 subperiod, where the underpricing differential between VC backed and non-VC backed IPOs shrinks to approximately 2 percentage points, this difference represents a large proportion (almost $20\\%$ )of average underpricing (l1 percentage points).  \n\n## 3.4. Robustness issues  \n\nWe perform a variety of checks to ensure that the first-day return differences between VC backed and non-VC backed IPOs are not driven by our choice of instrumental variables or specification of the estimator. We also consider an alternative methodology that addresses the endogeneity issue in a regression (rather than matching) framework. In the interest of brevity, these robustness checks do not appear in tables.  \n\n### 3.4.1. Alternative specifications  \n\nOne problem with the instrumental variables used in the first-stage is that some of them possess a look-ahead property. Net proceeds and underwriter rank are only known at the time of the IPO, after the receipt of venture funding. In addition, our measure of revenues comes from after the offering. Given the dearth of good ex ante instruments for our problem, we continue to use these variables. Our motivation for doing so is that they are likely to be correlated with other ex ante but unobservable predictors, such as funding requirements by the firm. Nonetheless, we also produce results in which we incrementally drop these variables from the first-stage regression. Not  surprisingly,  the pseudo- $R^{2}$ of the first-stage regressions vary, but the underpricing differential remains large and statistically significant.  \n\nSince younger firms are more likely to receive VC funding, we also add firm age to the first-stage regression. Unfortunately, this reduces the sample size substantially. If we include firm age, the pseudo- $R^{2}$ of the first-stage regression increases to 0.24. The full-sample propensity score estimate is 13.3 percentage points, with a standard error of 4.7 percentage points, but the sample size is roughly halved. The subperiod results are also similar to those reported in Table 3.  \n\nWe also determine if the choice of matching methods influences our conclusions. The Gaussian kernel, for instance, uses a normal distribution to assign weights to the non-VC backed IPOs. As an alternative, we also use the Epanechnikov kernel that assigns weights only if the matched IPOs are within a fixed distance (or “caliper'\") from the VC backed IPO. This and other similar matching methods leave our results qualitatively unchanged.  \n\n### 3.4.2. An alternative methodology  \n\nAn alternative to the matching method is to employ a regression-based approach to correct for the endogenous choice. Known as endogenous switching regressions, this method is also a two-step procedure in which the first stage is the estimation of a probit regression that predicts the receipt of venture financing and the second stage (OLS) regression uses estimates from the first stage to provide consistent estimates of the parameters. Madalla (1983, p. 283) describes the basic econometrics of the procedure and an empirical application in finance can be found in Madhavan and Cheng (1997).  \n\nTo implement this procedure, we use two-digit SIC code dummies, calendar year dummies, headquarter-state dummies, book value of equity per share scaled by offering price, revenue per share scaled by offering price, and total assets per share scaled by offering price as predictive variables in the first-stage regressions. The second-stage regression includes the logarithm of net proceeds, underwriter rankings, and a dummy variable equal to one if the offering is backed by a venture capitalist and zero otherwise. This last dummy variable is the regressionbased difference in underpricing for VC versus non-VC backed IPOs. For the full sample, the first-stage regression has a pseudo- $\\cdot R^{2}$ of 0.19. In the second-stage regression, the VC dummy variable has a coefficient of 0.43 with a $t\\cdot$ -statistic of 13.9. This implies that in the full sample, the first-day return of VC backed IPOs is 44 percentage points higher than for non-VC backed IPOs. The magnitude of the effect is larger than in the matching method and can be attributed to the fact that the selectivity correction $\\lambda$ has a coefficient of $-0.23$ with a $t$ statistic of 13.4. This indicates that not only is the selectivity correction important to the model, it also increases the (unconditional) return difference between VC backed and non-VC backed IPOs. If we include the earnings per share dummy variable in the first-stage regression, the coefficient on the VC dummy variable drops to 0.08 with a $t$ -statistic of 3.3.  \n\n## 3.5. A different dependent variable  \n\nInformation-based hypotheses of the effect of venture backing on the underpricing of IPOs are based on the idea that venture capitalists have a better understanding of the “\"true”’ value of the firm. In the certification hypothesis of Megginson and Weiss (1991), this information is credibly communicated to investment bankers pricing the IPO and results in lower underpricing of VC backed offerings. Therefore, it is possible that underpricing simply represents the wrong dependent variable. In other words, the true role of the VC frm is in establishing the offer price - relative to underlying value, not relative to an aftermarket price. If this is indeed the case, then the revision from the initial file price to the offer price should be smaller for VC backed offerings than for non-VC backed offerings.  \n\nTo test this idea, we calculate, for each offering, the absolute return from the midpoint of the file price range to the offer price. We use the absolute return because under the null hypothesis that venture capitalists reduce information problems, the absolute (unsigned) price revision should be smaller. We then use this absolute return in the selection-bias-adjusted matching methods implemented in Table 3. The results of this analysis are presented in Table 4. Panels A, B, and C employ exactly the same instruments as those in Table 3. In Panel A, full sample estimates of return differentials range from a low of 2.3 percentage points to a high of 3.3 percentage points with standard errors of 0.8 and 0.6 percentage points, respectively. The estimates in Panels B and C are slightly higher. Clearly, price revisions are larger in VC backed IPOs than in non-VC backed IPOs. This is consistent with our earlier first-day return results, but inconsistent with information-based explanations of the role of venture capitalists in the underpricing of IPOs. Overall, our results appear robust across alternative methodologies, time periods, and conditioning information.  \n\n# 4. Explaining the underpricing differential  \n\nVenture capitalists are major shareholders in firms prior to an IPO, and typically retain some portion of their stakes following the IPO. Barry et al. (1990) report that the average VC holding in pre-IPO firms is $34.3\\%$ ,and $24.6\\%$ immediately following the IPO. Comparable statistics reported by Megginson and Weiss (1991) are $36.6\\%$ and $26.3\\%$ , respectively. Therefore, higher first-day returns represent a real, incremental cost to venture capitalists because of the wealth transfer to new shareholders. Why would venture capital firms be willing to bear this incremental cost? We turn next to potential explanations of this phenomenon.  \n\n## 4.1. Institutional structure and grandstanding arguments  \n\nIn order to understand the reasons why venture capitalists would bear the cost of underpricing, it is important to first understand the institutional structure of the venture capital industry. Most venture capital firms raise money in limited  \n\nTable4 Selection bias adjusted differences between fle price midpoint to offer price returns of VC backed and non-VCbackedIPOs  \n\nFor each IPO, a pre-IPO return is computed as the absolute value of the return from the midpoint of the file price range to the offer price. The table presents selection bias adjusted average pre-IPO return differences between VC and non-VC backed IPOs, their standard errors, and $95\\%$ confidenceintervals. Each VC backed IPO is matched with one or many non-VC backed IPOs using the propensity score, Gaussian kernel, and regression-adjusted local linear matching approaches described in the text. Panel A uses the logarithm of net proceeds, two-digit SIC code dummies, calendar year dummies, headquarterstate dummies, and underwriter ranks as instrumental variables in each matching approach. Panel B adds book value per share scaled by offering price, revenue per share scaled by offering price, and total assets per share scaled by offering price to the Panel A instruments. Panel C adds an earnings per share dummy variable (equal to one for positive earnings and zero otherwise) to the instruments in Panel B. For each matching approach, the table presents the average difference in the pre-IPO return of the VC backed and matched non-VC backed IPOs. Bootstrapped standard errors are based on 50 replications and appear in parentheses.Bias-adjusted $95\\%$ confidence intervals appear below the standard errors.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Propensityscore</td><td>Gaussiankernel</td><td>Regression-adjusted locallinear</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Panel A:Instrumentalvariables:log(netproceeds)，SICdummies,yeardummies,headquarter-state dummies,underwriterrank</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"4\">Full sample</td><td>2.32</td><td>3.34</td><td>3.15 (0.72)</td></tr><tr><td>(0.79) [1.38,2.94]</td><td>(0.58) [2.16,4.32]</td><td>[2.01,4.66]</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">PanelB:Instrumentalvariables:log(netproceeds)，SICdummies,year dummies,underwriterrank, headquarter-statedummies,bookvaluepersharescaledbyofferingprice,revenuepersharescaledbyoffering</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">price,totalassetspersharescaledbyofferingprice Full sample</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">[0.06,5.47]</td><td>2.84</td><td>3.69</td><td>3.47</td></tr><tr><td>(1.00)</td><td>(0.89) [1.97,5.06]</td><td>(0.90) [1.26,4.89]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">PanelC:Instrumentalvariables:log(netproceeds),SICdummies,yeardummies,underwriterrank,</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">headquarter-statedummies,bookvaluepersharescaledbyofferingprice,revenuepersharescaledbyoffering</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">price,totalassetspersharescaledbyofferingprice,EPSdummy</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">3.53 (1.38)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">(1.10)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\"></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\"></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Full sample 4.03</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\"></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\"></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\"></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\"></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">[0.45,6.31]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">(1.38)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\"></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\"></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\"></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\"></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td>3.85</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\npartnerships, known as venture capital funds. Investors in these funds are typically institutions such as pension funds and endowments. Venture capital funds have fixed expirations, often ten years. Funds make investments in startup companies in the first four or five years, after which they proceed to harvest their investments. This is most often done by taking portfolio companies public, although in some cases the company can also be sold outright. The cash generated by this process is returned to theinvestors.  \n\nSince venture capital funds have fixed expirations, the venture capital firm must raise additional money in overlapping funds to stay in business. To do so, it must convince the limited partners that it is capable of selecting high-quality entrepreneurial investments and shepherding them through the IPO process. In other words, over time, it must establish a reputation of being able to take companies public. Therefore, one measure of reputation is the number of previous IPOs that the venture capital firm has conducted. The more experienced the venture capital firm is at taking portfolio companies public, the more comfortable the limited partners are likely to be in providing future funding. Gompers (1996) argues that venture frm age also effectively proxies for reputation because reputation effects are established over time and provides evidence to support this assertion.  \n\nSince establishing reputation is so important for future fundraising, venture capital firms are willing to bear the cost of underpricing because taking a company public signals quality. Cross-sectionally, venture capital firms that have not yet established a reputation (\"low-reputation' firms) are likely to take smaller and younger companies public and bear the cost of even higher underpricing. In other words, the cross-sectional prediction of Gompers's (1996) grandstanding hypothesis is that one should expect a negative correlation between venture firm reputation and underpricing. Venture firms that need to establish a reputation have more to gain by establishing their reputation and are willing to bear higher costs. This discussion suggests that regressions of future fundraising should show positive coefficients on measures of reputation (venture firm age and the number of previous IPOs conducted by the venture firm) and negative coefficients on the interaction of reputation and underpricing.  \n\n## 4.2. Basic grandstanding regressions  \n\nTo test this explanation, we estimate capital flow regressions similar in spirit to Gompers (1996). We first obtain information on the identity and stakes of VC firms in VC backed IPOs from the Venture Economics database supplied by SDC. Often, more than one venture capital firm holds equity in the IPO firm. We use two methods to identify the “lead’’ venture capitalist. First, we follow Barry et al. (1990) and regard the VC firm with the largest stake in the pre-IPO firm as the lead venture capitalist. We identify the largest stake by cumulating the amount invested by the venture capitalist across all financing rounds. Second, we regard the first venture firm to provide funding as the lead VC firm.? A subsample is created with each of these definitions. We compute the dependent variable as the logarithm of the size of the next fund raised by the venture capital firm. If the VC firm does not raise capital subsequent to the IPO, we set the dependent variable equal to zero. If a venture capital firm is the lead investor in more than one IPO in a year, then the observations in the subsamples are not independent and the errors are correlated. To correct for this, we replace such observations with their averagevalue.  \n\nWe use several control variables in the regressions. We include the CRSP valueweighted market return and the total volume of IPOs in that year as controls because Gompers and Lerner (1998) show that these variables are related to venture capital fundraising, at both an aggregate and firm level. Following Gompers (1996), we also include underwriter rank as a control variable and estimate the regressions with calendar and industry fixed effects. We use the two measures of VC reputation discussed above as primary explanatory variables (VC age and the number of previous IPOs conducted by the venture capital firm). We also consider two measures by which the VC firm can signal its reputation. The first, suggested by the arguments in the preceding section, is IPO underpricing. VC firms that need to establish their reputation are more likely to bear the cost of higher underpricing. The second is IPO size, defined as the number of shares multiplied by the offer price. The return earned by the VC firm (and therefore by the limited partners) is a function of the size of the IPO. Therefore, IPO size may in fact be a better signal than underpricing. Since IPO size is highly correlated with underpricing $\\overset{\\prime}{\\underset{\\r}{\\rho}}=0.74)$ ,weuse these variables in separate regressions.  \n\nThe grandstanding arguments in the previous section make specific predictions about the interaction between reputation and IPO underpricing (or IPO size). Therefore, we include interaction terms between the two measures of reputation and underpricing and IPO size. Table 5 shows parameter estimates for regressions in which the lead VC firm is defined as the one with the largest investment in the IPO firm, and Table 6 shows estimates for the subsample in which the lead VC firm is the earliest investor in the IPO firm. $P$ valuesappear in parentheses.  \n\nThe two measures of reputation, the VC age and the number of previous IPOs by the VC firm, are positive and statistically significant in all specifications and in both subsamples (Tables 5 and 6). This indicates that more-reputable firms are able to raise more capital. A behavioral story in which investors extrapolate recent performance (i.e., taking a portfolio company public) into the future would also predict a positive coefficient on the number of previous IPOs conducted by the VC. However, such a story cannot predict the coefficient on VC age, or the interaction effects with underpricing. First-day returns are also positively related to future capital flows in both subsamples. The average coefficient for models in which the lead VC has the largest (frst) stake in the IPO firm is 0.34 (0.10). In contrast, IPO size is statistically significant in only one specification, with a $p$ -value of 0.07. We can think of two reasons why underpricing is significant in these regressions but IPO size is not. First, there is a great deal of focus in both the capital markets and the press on the first-day return. Indeed, first-day “pops\" (as they are often referred to) are widely reported and followed by retail investors and entrepreneurial firms. IPO size does not receive such lavish attention. Second, for a signal to be credible, it must be costly to the agent (Spence, 1973). Underpricing reflects the cost of the wealth transfer from old shareholders (including the VC firm) to new shareholders. This cost, measured by the first-day return, is very visible. In contrast, the cost associated with suboptimal IPO size is more difficult to ascertain because investors do not have direct measures of optimal IPO size.  \n\nTable5 Fundraising regressions for VC with largest investment in IPO The sample consists of VCs with the largest stake in the company prior to the IPO. The dependent variable in the regressions below is the logarithm of the next fund raised by the VC subsequent to the IPO. If no money is raised subsequent to the IPO, the dependent variable is set to zero. The CRSP value-weighted return is for the year of the IPO. IPO size is calculated as the number of shares multiplied by the offer price. VC age is measured in years. Industry fixed effects are based on two-digit SIC codes. $P$ values appear in parentheses.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Intercept</td><td>-0.8077 (0.02)</td><td>-0.3747 (0.79)</td><td>1.4238 (0.00) -0.0013</td><td>-1.2209 (0.41)</td></tr><tr><td>CRSP value-weighted return</td><td>-0.0014 (0.15) 0.0000</td><td>-0.0014 (0.15) -0.0001</td><td>(0.16) -0.0003</td><td>-0.0015 (0.13) -0.0004</td></tr><tr><td>Total number of IPOs in the year of the IPO</td><td>(0.95)</td><td>(0.77) 0.0192</td><td>(0.39) 0.0079</td><td>(0.27)</td></tr><tr><td>Underwriter rank</td><td>0.0373 (0.33)</td><td>(0.67)</td><td>(0.83)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>First-day IPO return</td><td>0.1090 (0.00)</td><td></td><td>0.5548 (0.00)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Logarithm (IPO size)</td><td></td><td>0.0723 (0.44)</td><td></td><td>0.1673 (0.07)</td></tr><tr><td>Logarithm (VC age)</td><td>0.3989 (0.00)</td><td>0.4649 (0.00)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Logarithm (number of previous IPOs by VC)</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.8889 (0.00)</td><td>2.1585 (0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>VC age * first-day return</td><td>-0.2517 (0.00)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VC age * IPO size</td><td></td><td>-0.0001 (0.09)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Number of previous IPOs * first-day return</td><td></td><td></td><td>-0.0854 (0.00)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Number of previous IPOs * IPO size</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>-0.0068</td></tr><tr><td>Industry fixed effects</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>(0.41) Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Calendar fixed effects</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Adj-R2</td><td>0.08</td><td></td><td>0.11</td><td>0.10</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThe grandstanding argument predicts that less-established VC firms have more to gain from signaling their quality. This implies that the interaction effect between VC age and underpricing, and between the number of previous IPOs done by the VC firm and underpricing, should be negative. In Table 5, both interaction terms are negativeandhave $p$ -values of 0.oo. In Table 6, the interaction terms are also negative andhave $p$ -values of 0.05 and 0.03, respectively. We also estimate specifications in which we interact VC age and the number of previous IPOs with IPO size. The coefficients on these interactions terms are not statistically significant. This is not surprising since IPO size itself is not related to future fundraising.  \n\nThe cross-sectional predictions of the grandstanding hypothesis are supported by the data. However, the grandstanding argument does not predict that underpricing by itself should be positively related to future capital flows - a positive coefficient on first-day returns is somewhat surprising. We speculate that the growth and increase in competition in the venture capital industry in the late 1990s is driving some of this result. Panel A of Table 7 shows the number of existing venture capital firms, the number of net new firms, the total number of firms, and the number of net new venture capital funds raised in each year of the time series. These aggregate data are provided to us by Thomson Venture Economics and generated from the Venture Economics database. On average, 33 new firms entered the industry each year between 1980 and 1996. Between 1997 and 2000, this average rose to 106 firms. This dramatic change in industry profile has two consequences for our results. First, the latter part of our sample is likely to have a larger fraction of new VC firms. Second, if the entry of new firms is associated with an increase in competition, even incumbent firms might have to incur some underpricing costs to maintain their reputation. In either case, estimating regressions for these subperiods is likely to be informative.  \n\nTable6 Fundraising regressions for VC with earliest investment in IPO The sample consists of VCs with the earliest stake in the company prior to the IPO.

(We also estimate these regressions using 1996 as a breakpoint for the two subperiods; the results are similar and are not reported.) The regression specifications are identical to those in Tables 5 and 6 but only the coefficients on first-day returns, VC age, the number of previous IPOs, and interaction effects are shown. Panel B (C) shows results for the subsample in which the lead VC is defined as the largest (earliest) investor in the IPO firm.  \n\nThe results show that IPO underpricing is positively related to future fundraising in the 1997-2000 subperiod but this relation is much weaker in the earlier subperiod. Two of the four coefficients in the first subperiod are statistically insignificant. In the 1997-2000 subperiod, all four underpricing coefficients are positive and statistically significant. The cross-sectional relation between our two measures of VC reputation and underpricing are evident in both subperiods, suggesting that cross-sectional grandstanding effects are persistent.  \n\n## 4.3. Grandstanding and IPO characteristics  \n\nUnder the grandstanding hypothesis, venture capital firms that need to establish a reputation are more willing to bring smaller, younger, and perhaps riskier companies to the public market. This should be reflected in the cross-sectional dispersion of IPO characteristics with respect to various measures of VC firm reputation.  \n\nWe estimate regressions of our proxies for reputation on IPO characteristics in Table 8. Again, the regressions are estimated separately for the two lead-VC subsamples. As independent variables, we use total revenue and age for the IPO firm, and net proceeds and underwriter rank of the IPO. We do not include book value or total assets in the regressions because they are highly correlated with revenue. Other IPO characteristics such as gross spread display very little variation across IPOs, and are also excluded from the specification.  \n\nThe regressions show that both VC age and the number of prior IPOs conducted by the VC firm are positively related to total revenues of the IPO firm. In addition, VC age is positively related to the age of the IPO firm, implying that younger venture capitalists take younger companies public. Consistent with Gompers (1996), younger  \n\nTable8 Regressions of VC age and number of previous IPOs on firm and IPO characteristics The table shows regressions of two measures of reputation on IPO characteristics. The regressions are estimated for two subsamples. The first subsample consists of IPOs in which the lead VC is one that had the largest stake in the firm prior to the IPO. The second subsample is that of IPOs in which the lead VC was the one with the first investment in the pre-IPO firm. The dependent variables are the logarithm of the age of the VC at the time of the IPO and the logarithm of the number of previous IPOs conducted by the VC. Revenues are measured immediately after the IPO. Age is measured in years at the time of the IPO. $P$ values appear in parentheses.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">VCwithfirstinvestmentinIPOfirm</td><td colspan=\"2\">VC with largest stake in IPO firm</td></tr><tr><td>Dependentvariable</td><td>VC age</td><td>Number of previous IPOs</td><td>VC age</td><td>Number of previous IPOs</td></tr><tr><td>Constant</td><td>2.0700</td><td>0.3060</td><td>2.0735</td><td>-0.0410</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.27)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.89)</td></tr><tr><td>Log (revenue)</td><td>0.0469</td><td>0.0576</td><td>0.0030</td><td>0.0245</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.05)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.03)</td><td>(0.22)</td></tr><tr><td>Log (age at IPO)</td><td>0.1626</td><td>0.0564</td><td>0.1820</td><td>0.0168</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.32)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.74)</td></tr><tr><td>Log (underwriter rank)</td><td>0.1524</td><td>0.1219</td><td>0.1135</td><td>0.2692</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.40)</td><td>(0.38)</td><td>(0.51)</td><td>(0.07)</td></tr><tr><td>Log (net proceeds)</td><td>-0.0105</td><td>-0.0287</td><td>0.0273</td><td>0.0570</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.88)</td><td>(0.65)</td><td>(0.67)</td><td>(0.30)</td></tr><tr><td>Adj-R2</td><td>0.02</td><td>0.02</td><td>0.02</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>N</td><td>480</td><td>484</td><td>544</td><td>0.02 545</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nVC firms and those with less experience at taking companies public take smaller and younger companies public.  \n\n# 5. Robustness issues and alternative explanations  \n\nThe evidence thus far is consistent with the idea that underpricing is related to grandstanding by venture capital firms. This appears to be refected in the costs they are willing to bear as well as the cross-sectional distribution of the types of firms that engage in this activity. In this section, we consider issues that could affect our inferences and examine other potential explanations for our results.  \n\n## 5.1. Issues with the dependent variable  \n\nThere are several possible sources of error in the specification of the dependent variable in the regressions in Tables 5 and 6. We have followed Gompers (1996) in defining the dependent variable as the logarithm of the size of the next fund raised by the VC firm. For IPOs in the last few years of our sample, however, this could present a problem. Consider, for example, a VC firm that takes a firm public in 2000. Our fundraising data from Venture Economics end in 2o01, one year after the end of the IPO sample. Since VC firms raise new venture capital funds with overlapping lives, it could be that a venture capital firm that took a portfolio company public in  \n\n2000 raises funds in 2002 or even later. This would not be visible in our sample and the dependent variable would be coded zero because the VC firm did not raise subsequent funds in our sample period.  \n\nThere are several possible ways to deal with this horizon problem. We could restrict the sample to IPOs ending in some earlier year, say 1995. This would allow sufficient time for fundraising to “catch up\" with IPOs. This solution, however, eliminates a very important period of IPO and venture capital activity (1995-2000). Another possibility is to redefine the dependent variable as the amount of funds raised in the year subsequent to the IPO. The advantage of this definition is that it treats all vC firms equally across the time series. We estimate the regressions in Tables 5 and 6 with this definition of the dependent variable using Tobit models because of truncation. We do not report these regressions but our basic results (the positive coefficient on underpricing and the interaction effects) remain qualitatively unchanged.  \n\nA second issue with the dependent variable is that it might miss an important element of grandstanding, namely time. Specifically, the next fund raised by a VC firm could be two years after an IPO or ten years after an IPO. These two observations are given the same weight in the regressions. To determine if this makes a difference to our results, we reestimate the regressions in Tables 5 and 6 but weight the observations by the inverse of one plus the number of years till the next fund. Again, our principal results remain qualitatively unchanged.  \n\n## 5.2. Independent variables and specifications issues  \n\nIn addition to VC age and the number of prior IPOs, we consider another measure of reputation, namely VC size. However, because lagged capital fows determine VC size, regressions with VC size as an independent variable could be misspecified. At a minimum, endogeneity issues could cloud inferences. Therefore, we elect not to use VC size in the regressions.  \n\nThe regressions in Tables 5 and 6 never include first-day returns and IPO size in the same model because of the high correlationbetween these two variables $(\\rho=0.74)$ ．However,it would be useful to know which effect dominates. To determine this, we orthogonalize each variable with respect to the other, and include the orthogonalized transformations in the regressions. When the lead VC is the largest investor in the IPO, the coefficient on orthogonalized first-day return is 0.3614 ( $t\\cdot$ -statistic $=5.4$ ) and the coefficient on the orthogonalized IPO size is -0.0674 $t$ statistic $=-0.84)$ .When the lead VC is the earliest investor in the IPO, the corresponding coefficients are 0.1357 ( $t\\cdot$ statistic $=2.94\\$ and0.0058( $t$ statistic $=0.94\\$ respectively. Thus, consistent with the results in Tables 5 and 6, underpricing influences future fundraising but IPO size does not.  \n\n## 5.3. Alternative explanations  \n\nWe consider other explanations for our results. As we discuss in the introduction, it is possible that underwriters preferentially allocate shares of other underpriced  \n\nIPOs to venture capital firms in exchange for greater underpricing in the VC firm's own portfolio firm. Negative publicity, indictments, and regulatory investigations into IPO allocations in the internet bubble period are certainly suggestive of this explanation. However, our results are drawn from a long time series. We doubt that such an explanation can account for results in other sample periods.  \n\nAnother possibility is the “recycling hypothesis\" described by Gompers (1996). This hypothesis relies on the idea that investors in venture capital firms reinvest profits from earlier venture investments into new VC funds (i.e., recycle their profits). The sooner VC firms return cash to their institutional investors, the sooner they receive additional capital. This suggests that taking a portfolio company public leads to future inflows of capital but does not explain why underpricing should be related to future capital fows. Moreover, it does not explain the cross-sectional dispersion in capital flows or the interaction effects with underpricing.  \n\nFinally, Loughran and Ritter (2002b) use prospect theory to explain why issuers are willing to leave money on the table. They argue that issuers ignore the wealth loss from underpricing because they sum this wealth loss with the wealth gain from the IPO itself. Since the net effect is a wealth gain, investors simply ignore the loss due to underpricing. If this is true, then the positive relation between underpricing and future capital flows could simply be an IPO effect, rather than an underpricing effect.  \n\nDisentangling the incremental impact of underpricing from the effect of the IPO is a difficult task because underpricing is only observed at the time of the IPO. Therefore, any attempt to distinguish the two effects requires that the sample contain VC firms that do not take a company public, as well as VC firms that lead IPOs. We compile a sample of all venture capital firms that are in existence in a given year. As described in Section 2, our data-gathering procedures account for name changes, consolidations and other such events by manually reading records from annual issues of Pratt's Guide to Venture Capital Sources. We then merge this sample with our database of venture capital firms that took a company public in each given year. The consolidated sample consists of a panel dataset that includes venture capital firms that were involved in an IPO and others that were not. The database of venture capital firms that took a company public in any given year is somewhat different from the subsamples used in the regressions in Tables 5 and 6. This is because, for this test, we need to know if a particular venture capital firm held any equity stake in the IPO firm (not just the largest stake).  \n\nEven with this sample, it is inappropriate to estimate fundraising regressions with an IPO indicator (equal to one if the VC firm conducted an IPO, zero otherwise) and first-day returns in the same model. This is because there is a causal relation between the two regressors - underpricing can only be observed if the company is taken public. The solution to this observability problem is to estimate the underpricing effect via Heckman's (1979) two-stage procedure. The first stage is a probit regression that estimates the probability that underpricing is not observed (or, equivalently, that a sample VC firm takes a portfolio company public). In the second stage, the dependent variable is the logarithm of the size of the next fund. The coefficient on underpricing in the second stage is adjusted for the fact that underpricing is not always observed. The difficulty in such procedures is always in  \n\nIabley   \nHeckman Regressions   \nThe sample consists of all venture firms in existence in each year from 1980 to 200o. Venture firms that took a portfolio company public, as well as those that did not, are included in the sample. Two-stage Heckman (1979) regressions are estimated to account for the fact that underpricing is only observed when a portfolio company is taken public. The dependent variable in the first-stage regression is the probability that a VC firm takes a portfolio company public. The dependent variable in the second-stage regression is the logarithm of size of the next fund. VC age is measured in years. The number of portfolio companies is the total number of companies in which the venture firm has investments in that calendar year. Panel estimates are based on the entire cross-section and time series of venture capital firms.The last two columns show average coefficients from similar year-by-year regressions, with $p$ -values based on timeseries standard errors. $P$ -values appear in parentheses.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">Panel estimates</td><td colspan=\"2\">Year-by-year regression estimates</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\">PanelA:StageIregressions</td></tr><tr><td>Constant</td><td>-1.1839</td><td>-1.6100</td><td>-1.3683</td><td>-1.9854</td></tr><tr><td>Logarithm (VC age)</td><td>(0.00) 0.3358</td><td>(0.00) 0.2273</td><td>(0.00) 0.3035</td><td>(0.00) 0.2513</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>Number of portfolio companies</td><td>0.0032 (0.00)</td><td></td><td>0.0267 (0.00)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Logarithm (VC size)</td><td></td><td>0.2168</td><td></td><td>0.2415</td></tr><tr><td>Calendarindicators</td><td>Yes</td><td>(0.00) Yes</td><td>No</td><td>(0.00) No</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>-0.2047</td><td>-0.5383</td><td>-0.6290</td><td>-0.7703</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.01)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>Pseudo R2</td><td>0.10</td><td>0.12</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\">PanelB:StageIIfundraisingregressions</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Constant</td><td>0.5046</td><td>0.9240</td><td>1.0246</td><td>1.2915</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>First-day return</td><td>0.2557</td><td>0.3417</td><td>0.5834</td><td>1.1727</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nidentifying appropriate regressors for the first-stage regression. We use VC age, the number of companies in the venture firm's portfolio in that year, VC size, and calendar year indicator variables as instruments in the first-stage regression. We expect older venture capital firms and those with more companies in their portfolio to be more likely to conduct an IPO. Since data on VC size is sparse, it reduces the effective sample size. Therefore, we estimate separate models with VC size and the number of companies in the venture firm's portfolio. We estimate these regressions in two ways. First, we estimate models on the entire panel. Second, since the error terms in the panel are likely to be correlated, we estimate Fama-MacBeth regressions and report average coefficients.  \n\nPanel A of Table 9 shows the results of the first-stage regressions. The panel estimates, which appear in the first two columns, show that VC age, the number of companies in the VC firm's portfolio, and VC size are positively related to the probability that the venture firm will take a portfolio company public. Average coefficients from similar annual regressions (with $p$ -valuesbasedontime-series standard errors) are similar in size and significance. The pseudo- $R^{2}\\mathrm{s}$ of the panel regressions are 0.10 and 0.12, indicating that the regressions have reasonable explanatory power. In the second stage, the coefficients on first-day returns are positive and statistically significant in all models. This suggests that underpricing has an impact on future fundraising over and beyond the fact that it is only observed when a firm is taken public.  \n\n# 6. Conclusion  \n\nWe investigate the role of venture capitalists in the underpricing of IPOs between 1980 and 2000. We argue that the provision and receipt of venture financing represents an endogenous choice on the part of the venture capitalist and the entrepreneur. We use instruments correlated with this endogenous choice to control for selection bias and compare the underpricing of VC backed and non-VC backed IPOs. Our results show that VC backed IPOs exhibit greater underpricing than nonVC backed IPOs. The return differential ranges from $5.0\\%$ to $10.3\\%$ overtheentire sample period. During the internet bubble period of 1999-2000, the differential is significantly larger.  \n\nLarger underpricing represents a real cost to venture capitalists because there is a wealth transfer from them (and from other pre-IPO shareholders) to new shareholders. We explore a variant of the grandstanding hypothesis proposed by Gompers (1996) as an explanation for this result. We estimate capital flow regressions with measures of reputation, underpricing, and interaction effects as explanatory variables. These regressions detect a positive relation between reputation proxies and future fundraising, and between first-day returns and future fundraising. Interaction effects between reputation and underpricing are negative, suggesting that low-reputation firms benefit more from grandstanding. Overall, the data are consistent with the idea that grandstanding provides a compensating benefit to the cost associated with incremental underpricing of VC backed IPOs.  \n\n# References  \n\nAckerberg, D., Botticini, M., 2002.

    "reference_markdown": "# Venture Capital's Role in Financing Innovation: What We Know and How Much We Still Need to Learn  \n\nJosh Lerner and Ramana Nanda  \n\nV enture capital is associated with some of the most high-growth and influential firms in the world. For example, among publicly traded firms worldwide, seven of the top eight firms by market capitalization in May 2020 had been   \nbacked by venture capital prior to their initial public offerings: Alphabet, Apple,   \nAmazon, Facebook, and Microsoft in the United States, and Alibaba and Tencent in   \nChina. More generally, although firms backed by venture capital comprise less than   \n0.5 percent of firms that are born each year in the United States, they represent   \nnearly half of entrepreneurial companies that graduate to the public marketplace.  \n\nAcademics and practitioners have effectively articulated the strengths of the venture model. These include its strong emphasis on governance by venture capital investors through staged financing, contractual provisions, and active involvement with their portfolio companies. Indeed, Kenneth Arrow (1995) once opined that \"venture capital has done much more, I think, to improve efficiency than anything.  \n\nIn many respects, the venture capital industry appears to be a bright spot in an increasingly troubled global innovation landscape (Bloom et al. 2020). Over the last decade, the amount of capital deployed worldwide by venture capital investors and the number of startups receiving funding have grown substantially. Entirely new financial intermediaries such as accelerators, crowdfunding platforms, and “super angels\" have emerged at the early stage of new venture finance. Meanwhile, mutual funds, hedge funds, corporations, and sovereign wealth funds have deployed large sums of capital into more mature, but still private, venture capital-backed firms.  \n\nIn this paper, we acknowledge the power of the venture capital in fomenting innovation. At the same time, despite the optimism articulated by Arrow and by many other academics and practitioners, we argue that venture capital financing also has real limitations in its ability to advance substantial technological change. While our ability to assess the social welfare impact of venture capital remains nascent, we hope that this discussion will stimulate discussion and research about these questions.  \n\nThree issues are particularly concerning to us: 1) the very narrow band of technological innovations that fit the requirements of institutional venture capital investors; 2) the relatively small number of venture capital investors who hold and shape the direction of a substantial fraction of capital that is deployed into financing radical technological change; and 3) the relaxation in recent years of the intense emphasis on corporate governance by venture capital firms. We believe these phenomena, rather than being short-run anomalies associated with the ebullient equities market from the decade or so up through early 2020, may have ongoing and detrimental effects on the rate and direction of innovation in the broader economy.  \n\nWe begin this paper by tracing the growth of the venture capital industry over the past 40 years, noting how technological and institutional changes have narrowed the focus and concentrated the capital invested by venture capital firms as well as potentially contributing to a decline in governance. We then turn to some potential adaptations to the venture capital industry model that might enable a broader base of ideas and technologies to receive risk capital. In particular, we propose some possibilities for altering what seems to be a standard and inflexible contract between venture capital funds and their investors as well as potential approaches to manage venture investments in certain industries more effectively.  \n\nOur focus here will primarily be on the US venture capital industry. But we would be remiss if we did not note that the growth rate of global venture capital has exceeded that of the US economy. The National Venture Capital Association (2020) estimates, for instance, that the US share of world venture capital financing has fallen from about 80 percent in 2006-2007 to under 50 percent in 2016-2019.  \n\n## A Brief Look at the Development of Institutional Venture Capital  \n\n### Origins  \n\nEntrepreneurs sought funds to pursue their risky ideas for centuries before the modern venture capital industry emerged. Indeed, some of the key elements of today's venture capital industry, such as the use of risk-sharing partnerships, can be traced as far back as Genoese merchants in the 15th century and American whaling voyages in the 19th century (Astuti 1933; de Roover 1963; Lopez and Raymond 1955; Nicholas 2019).  \n\nMost business historians, however, trace the origins of the institutional venture capital industry to 1946, when Harvard Business School professor Georges Doriot formed the American Research & Development Corporation with local Boston civic leaders to invest in young ventures developed during World War I1.1 Doriot articulated and practiced many of the key principles of venture investment that continue to this day. These guideposts include: the intensive scrutiny (and frequent rejection) of business plans prior to financing, the provision of oversight as well as capital, the staged financing of investments, and the ultimate return of capital and profits to the outside investors that provided the original funding.  \n\nSeveral of the most prominent venture capital firms of today—such as Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins, and New Enterprise Associates—were formed in the early to mid-1970s to invest in what would become the burgeoning semiconductor and computer industries. However, the industry did not take off until the early 1980s, when pension funds began to allocate some of their capital towards this relatively new asset class. Much of this change can be traced back to a clarification of an obscure rule in the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The rule had originally stated that private pension managers had to invest their funds' resources with the care of a “prudent man,” which was interpreted as requiring only very low-risk investments. In early 1979, the Department of Labor ruled that pension fund managers could take portfolio diversification into account in determining prudence, which implied that the government would not view allocation of a small fraction of a corporate pension fund portfolio to illiquid funds like venture capital as imprudent, even if a number of companies in the venture capitalist's portfolio failed. While the allocations of corporate pension funds to venture capital in the 1980s were initially very modest, even a small allocation of such a large pool led to very rapid growth of the venture capital sector.  \n\nA decade later, US public pension funds also started investing in venture capital firms and were soon followed by pension and sovereign funds from around the globe. Initially, neither private nor public pension funds invested in a dramatically different manner than their predecessors. But their impact was important because of their sheer size, which dwarfed that of the early venture capital investors such as university endowments and insurance companies. In the subsequent 40 years, venture capital has come to be established as the dominant source of financing for high-potential startups commercializing risky new ideas and technologies.  \n\n## Venture Capital's Impact  \n\nTable 1 highlights how venture capital is involved in financing startups that ultimately have become some of the largest and most successful firms in the economy. We looked at the 4,109 initial public offerings over the 1995-2018 period of nonfinancial firms that were founded in 1980 or later. Table 1 (inspired by Gornall and Strebulaev 2015) shows that 47 percent (or 1,930) of these firms were backed by venture capital investors prior to their initial public offering. Of those 4,109 IPOs, 1,044 were still publicly traded at the end of 2019. The table compares the 1,044 firms-at the end of 2019—-based on whether they were originally venture capital-backed (582 firms) versus not (462 firms). That is, 56 percent of the firms that had initial public offerings from 1995 to 2018 and were still alive at the end of 2019 were backed by venture capital. Considering that under 0.5 percent of firms in the economy receive venture capital financing (Puri and Zarutskie 2012), Table 1 highlights the disproportionate role firms backed by venture capital play in the US economy.  \n\nTable1 Comparison of Publicly Traded Firms in the United States, Based on Whether Backed by Institutional Venture Capital Investors   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>VC-Backed IPOs</td><td>All IPOs</td><td>VC-Backed as n fo % D</td></tr><tr><td>Totalnumberofnon-financialIPOsbetween1995and2019</td><td>1,930</td><td>4,109</td><td>47.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Number offirms stillpublic at12/31/2019</td><td>582</td><td>1,044</td><td>55.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Share ofIPOs thatwerestillpublic at12/31/2019</td><td>30%</td><td>25%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Key statistics as of December31,2019for firms still public (allfigures millionsUsD,exceptnumberofemployees)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Totalenterprisevalue</td><td>4,844,717</td><td>7,129,838</td><td>67.9%</td></tr><tr><td>Totalmarketcapitalization</td><td>4,922,394</td><td>6,462,409</td><td>76.2%</td></tr><tr><td>Globalemployees</td><td>2,279,715</td><td>5,336,394</td><td>42.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Totalrevenue</td><td>1,157,679</td><td>2,171,239</td><td>53.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Netincome</td><td>53,082</td><td>98,554</td><td>53.9%</td></tr><tr><td>R&D expenditure</td><td>148,388</td><td>167,442</td><td>88.6%</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nSource: IPO data from SDC Platinum (accessed 01/08/2020); company-level stastics from Standard and Poor's Capital IQ (accessed 04/24/2020) Note: This table reports statistics for the sample of publicly traded firms that had an initial public offering (IPO) between 1995 and 2018 and were still public on December 31, 2019, further conditioning on those that were founded after 1980 and were not financial firms. It compares statistics for firms that were backed by venture capital firms prior to their IPO with those that were not. IPO data are drawn from Refinitiv's SDC Platinum database, with data for key statistics drawn from S&P's Capital IQ database. All attributes are measured as of December 31, 2019.  \n\nAn important question relates to whether these differences arise purely due to venture capital firms selecting high-growth opportunities or whether these investors also play a causal role in improving the growth and performance of new companies. Discerning causality in this setting is tough, and much of the research has consequentially been more descriptive in nature. Chemmanur, Krishnan, and Nandy (201l) and Puri and Zarutskie (2012) examine the universe of firms using the Longitudinal Research Database of the Us Census Bureau. They argue that the evidence is consistent with the proposition that venture capital increases firm sales and lowers the likelihood of firm failure.  \n\nOther papers have attempted to exploit discontinuities to identify the relationship between venture capital and innovation. Kortum and Lerner (2ooo) use the 1979 “prudent man\" change in pension fund rules that increased venture capital funding as a natural experiment, along with several other approaches, to look for causality. They find that a rise in venture capital causes higher rates of patenting. Bernstein, Giroud, and Townsend (2016) examine the opening up of new airline routes that make it easier for a venture capital firm to visit one of its existing portfolio companies. They find that when it becomes easier for the venture capital firm to monitor, the portfolio firm performs better.  \n\nOther research has fleshed out the mechanisms that venture capital investors use. These tools include staged financing (Gompers 1995; Neher 1999), securities that have state-contingent cash flow and control rights (Hellmann 1998; Cornelli and Yosha 2003; Kaplan and Stromberg 2003, 2004), and the active role of venture capital investors on boards of portfolio companies (Hellmann and Puri 2000, 2002; Lerner 1995). The authors argue these approaches have an important impact on the success of portfolio companies. For a more thorough review of the extensive literature on venture capital, a useful starting point is Da Rin, Hellmann, and Puri (2013).  \n\nLooking back at Table 1, one can see that firms that were backed by venture capital prior to their initial public offering represent a similar share of revenues and profits as their proportion of surviving public firms (about 55 percent). On average, they are less labor intensive, more valuable in terms of market capitalization, and represent 89 percent of the recorded research and development expenditures by these firms in 2019.  \n\nThe disproportionate share of recorded research and development expenditures by firms that were formerly backed by venture capital stems from two elements. First, 91 percent of public firms originally backed by venture capital recorded expenses related to research and development in 2019, compared to a much smaller 72 percent for firms not originally backed by venture capital. Second, among those that did report research and development expenses, the intensity of research and development, measured as a share of firm revenue, was higher.  \n\nThe research and development intensity of publicly traded firms that were backed by venture capital relates to the role of venture capital in financing repeated waves of technological innovation: the semiconductor revolution and diffusion of mainframe computing in the 1960s; the advent of personal computing in the early 1980s; the biotechnology revolution of the 1980s; and the introduction of the Internet and e-commerce in the 1990s (which as seen from Figure 1, led to a sharp expansion in venture capital and venture capital-backed startups between 1995 and 2000). After a significant decline in 2000 and the subsequent “dot com bust,”\" the role of venture capital firms in financing technological revolutions continued in the 20o0s, as exemplified by the widespread diffusion of “smart\" mobile communications technologies and new busineses enabled by the rise of cloud computing. Consistent with this pattern, Howell et al. (2020) use US patent data over the 1976-2017 period to document that venture capital-backed firms were between two  \n\n![](images/13ab073a33566829b6de433a4a43823b2bc7159cd1293cb0dce45fc638155dc2.jpg)  \nFigure 1 Evolution of the US Venture Capital Industry from 1985-2019  \n\nSource: Data are drawn from the National Venture Capital Association's Yearbooks and related publications.  \n\nNote: This figure reports the number of unique startups headquartered in the United States receiving an initial round of financing from institutional venture capital investors (left-hand axis), the total number of financing rounds associated with these startups, including follow-on rounds of financing (left-hand axis) and the total dollars invested across these rounds of financing in constant 2019 billions of dollars (right-hand axis) for each year from 1985-2019.  \n\nand four times as likely to have filed patents that were in the top percentiles of influence (as measured by citations, originality, generality, and closeness to science).  \n\n## Venture Capital in the 2010s  \n\nVenture capital has boomed over the past decade, driven by new investment opportunities and greater availability in the supply of capital for this asset class.  \n\nOn the demand side, there has been a plethora of attractive investment opportunities. Many venture-backed firms have focused on developing novel ways to apply information technology and the widespread diffusion of mobile communications. One manifestation has been platforms that connect and employ widely dispersed sellers of services and goods (frequently dubbed the “sharing economy,” and manifested by companies such as Airbnb and Uber). A second has been firms that substantially improve the efficiency of existing services at much lower price points: for example, the ways in which Salesforce.com and other companies provide “Software as a Service\" to businesses, the rise of “fintech,”\" and the plethora of “Mobile Apps\" available for consumers. Third, several companies replicated business models successful in the United States in other national markets, with the Chinese companies Alibaba and Tencent being the most dramatic exemplars. An important consequence was the dramatic increase in venture capital investment in Asia over this period (a topic worthy of much closer study).  \n\nAnother demand driver has been the substantially lower cost of starting a new business in the software and services sectors. As documented by Ewens, Nanda, and Rhodes-Kropf (2018), the much lower initial capital needed for new ventures in these sectors made it much cheaper to learn about their potential. This change led early-stage investors to be more willing to fund less proven (but potentially highreturn) ideas and entrepreneurial teams in these sectors. One manifestation was an increase in a “spray and pray” investment approach, where financiers provide a small amount of funding and limited governance to a larger number of startups. As seen in Figure 1, the number of startups receiving a first round of venture capital financing rose substantially over this period.  \n\nCoinciding with the fall in cost of starting businesses and the entry of lessexperienced founding teams has been the emergence of complementary institutions that fund and mentor very early-stage entrepreneurs. For example, the substantially smaller quantum of capital required to get a business off the ground has led to more opportunities for angel (or individual) investors. Not only did angel groups grow in size (Kerr, Lerner, and Schoar 2014), but some angel investors (the “Super Angels\") even began to raise small funds to finance startups at earlier stages than was typical for institutional venture capital investors. Further, using online platforms such as AngelList, groups of individuals could back a lead investor who aimed to replicate some of the systematic diligence and monitoring functions played by traditional venture groups (Agrawal, Catalini, and Goldfarb 2016). The contemporaneous rise of equity crowdfunding and initial coin offerings has had a more mixed legacy, enabling widespread participation in financing startups by the populace but also raising concerns about fraud (Howell, Niessner and Yermack forthcoming; Lin 2017; Zetzsche et al. 2018).3 The evolving early-stage market also created an increasingly important role for business accelerators, which sought to systemize the mentoring and development of the larger number of inexperienced, first-time entrepreneurs receiving financing (Gonzales-Uribe and Leatherbee 2017; Hochberg 2016).  \n\nThe last decade has also seen substantial changes in the way that venture capital-backed firms grow and achieve exits for their investments. One element of this shift is the marked decline in the number of initial public offerings since the \"dot com\" bust in 2000. Instead, venture capitalists are far more likely to exit investments through acquisitions. Inasmuch as firms are going public, they are doing so at more mature stages in their life-cycle (Ewens and Farre-Mensa 2020).  \n\nUnderstanding the drivers for such shifts—and the more general reduction in the number of publicly traded US firms-is challenging. Potential explanations include technological shifts leading to a rise in platform (winner-take-all) businesses (Gao, Ritter, and Zhu 2013), regulations making it harder for small firms to go public (lliev 2010), changes in securities laws that facilitated the flow of more capital into private markets (Ewens and Farre-Mensa 2020), and monetary policy following the financial crisis.  \n\nBut whatever the cause, the fact that firms that are more mature when they go public has also meant that they do so at substantially higher valuations. Investors that traditionally focused solely on the public markets saw that they were missing out on the capital gains that companies such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Salesforce garnered while still private. These investors consequentially sought out opportunities in the private venture capital market.  \n\nAs a result of this interest, the past decade saw an increase in the number of venture capital funds raising capital. The most conspicuous impact of this flood of capital into venture capital was the rise of “mega-funds,”\" which refers to venture capital funds that are substantially larger than historical averages. The most salient of these was SoftBank's Vision Fund. At the time of its first closing on $\\$93$ billion in May 2017 (with an anchor investment of $\\$45$ billion from the Saudi Public Investment Fund), it was already 30 times larger than the previous largest venture capital fund raised (New Enterprise Associates? 2015 Fund XV). SoftBank would ultimately go on to raise $\\$100$ billion for its fund. This rapid increase in interest in venture capital also triggered traditional venture firms to raise very large funds, such as the $\\$8$ billion Sequoia Capital Global Growth Fund IHI in 2018.  \n\nIn addition, frustration with the high fees charged by venture capital firms led sovereign wealth funds, hedge funds, mutual funds, and other public market investors to begin making direct investments into firms backed by venture capital (Fang. Ivashina, and Lerner 2015; Lerner et al. 2018). Ewens and Farre-Mensa (2020) estimate that between 2014 and 2016, over three-quarters of the late-stage venture capital funding came from such non-traditional investors. Whether through large funds or direct investments, much of the capital from these later-stage investors has gone to “unicorns,” defined as privately held firms with nominal valuations in excess of $\\$1$ billion.  \n\nThis combination of new entrants deploying small amounts of capital at the early stage with the rise of mega-funds is reflected in fund size statistics. These changes are best illustrated by looking “peak to peak,”\" from 2007 to 2019 in Table 2. The size of the median fund raised by venture capital investors has fallen from $\\$133$ million to $\\$80$ million. Meanwhile, the number of funds with $\\$1$ billion or more of capital rose from three in 2007 to eight in 2019 (NVCA 2020).  \n\n## Venture Capital's Limitations  \n\nThe growth of the venture capital market in the past decade should not blind us to its limitations as an engine of innovation. Indeed, the changes delineated in the previous section will likely exacerbate these challenges. We lay out three distinct areas of concern about venture capital and its ability to successfully spur innovations. While the discussion must be inherently more speculative, given the relatively limited work done in this area, we suggest that these questions would benefit from scholarly attention in the years to come.  \n\nTable2 The State of US Venture Capital Funds in 2007 versus 2019   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>2007</td><td>2019</td></tr><tr><td>Numberoffirms thatraisedfundsintheprior8years</td><td>946</td><td>1,328</td></tr><tr><td>NumberofVCfundsraisingmoneyinthatyear</td><td>187</td><td>272</td></tr><tr><td>Number offunds greater than$1billionin size</td><td>3</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>VCcapitalraised(billionsof$)</td><td>35</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>TotalVCAUM(billionsof$)</td><td>222</td><td>444</td></tr><tr><td>Medianfundsize(millionsof$)</td><td>133</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>Averagefund size(millions of$)</td><td>213</td><td>189</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nSource: Data are drawn from the National Venture Capital Association's 2020 Yearbook and accompanying supplemental data pack. Data for “number of funds greater than $\\$1$ billion in size” are drawn from the PitchBook database. Note: The NVCA includes in its fundraising data “only funds based in the United States that have held their final close,” while its deals data include financings of companies headquartered in the United States but potentially from investors based outside the United States.  \n\n### Optimized for a Narrow Slice of Technological Innovation  \n\nDespite the substantial growth of venture capital in the four decades since the revision of the “prudent man\" rule for pension fund investment in 1979, venture capital touches only a tiny share of firms in the American economy. The estimated $\\$450$ billion currently under management by US venture capital firms (NVCA 2020) remains small in comparison to the several trillion dollars managed by the broader asset class of all US private equity, not to mention the total of all US public equities, estimated at $\\$42.9$ trillion at the end of 2018 (SIFMA 2019). Only a few thousand new firms each year raise institutional venture capital for the first time, as compared to over 600,000 annual business starts in the United States. Even among high-potential firms engaged in innovation, Farre-Mensa, Hegde, and Ljungqvist (2020) found that only 7 percent of firms that filed for a patent went on to raise institutional venture capital. These disparities are likely even more extreme in other nations, where the venture industry is less mature.  \n\nOne reason for this is structural. Venture capital investors typically raise funds for a specific (usually a ten-year) period. This time frame implies that venture capitalists are naturally drawn to investment opportunities where the ideas can be commercialized and their value realized through an “exit\" within a reasonably short period. Sudden market downturns, as occurred in 2000, 2008, and 2020, may disrupt plans to exit investments, creating more pressure to sell when market conditions permit, even if earlier than optimal for the firm. These constraints imply that venture capital investors often exit their investments well before growth opportunities are fully realized. As a result, they are often drawn to sectors with large uncertainty about an idea's potential that can nevertheless be resolved quickly.  \n\nWhat leads to variation in the degree to which uncertainty about the prospects of a young firm can be reduced quickly? An important element appears to be the nature of uncertainty about demand for the new product or service. Put another way, can uncertainty about the viability of the offering and the market demand be resolved quickly? Software and service businesseswhich are typically based on proven technologies, often have short development times and can benefit from quick market feedback—-are amenable to this approach. Also, as noted above, technological changes over the past two decades have made it quicker and cheaper to learn about demand for a new software business. By way of contrast, many other sectors like clean energy, new materials, and others are less amenable to such rapid learning. The widespread interest among venture capital investors in the few exceptions, such as biotechnology startups, is tied to the drug approval and reimbursement system that enables investors to project the market value of a new drug accurately if it is successful in passing through clinical trials ( Janeway 2018).  \n\nThis suggestion is underscored by computations by Sand Hill Econometrics. This firm creates a series of indexes (described in Hall and Woodward 2004) that seek to capture the gross returns (that is, before management fees and profit-sharing) from investments in all active venture transactions in a given category. Their calculations suggest that an investment in the software deals between December 1991 and September 2019 would have yielded an annualized gross return of 24 percent per annum, far greater than investments in hardware (17 percent), healthcare (13 percent), or clean-tech (2 percent). This index further shows that the divergence in the performance of these categories has been particularly stark in the last decade.  \n\nThese stark differences in economics have unsurprisingly led to shifts in the composition of venture capital portfolios. Examining the portfolio of a single venture group four decades apart demonstrates the extent of this focus and narrowing.4 Charles River Ventures was founded by three seasoned executives from the operating and investment worlds in 1970. Within its first four years, it had almost completely invested its nearly $\\$6$ million first fund into 18 firms. These included classes of technologies that would be comfortably at home in a typical venture capitalist's portfolio today: a startup designing computer systems for hospitals (Health Data Corporation), a software company developing automated credit scoring systems (American Management Systems), and a firm seeking to develop an electric car (Electromotion, which, alas, proved to be a few decades before its time). Other companies, however, were much more unusual by today's venture standards: for instance, startups seeking to provide birth control for dogs (Agrophysics), highstrength fabrics for balloons and other demanding applications (N.F. Doweave), and turnkey systems for pig farming (International Farm Systems). Only eight of the 18 initial portfolio companies—less than half—were related to communications, information technology, or human health care.  \n\nThe portfolio of Charles River Ventures looks very different in December 2019. Of the firms listed as investments, about 90 percent are classified as being related  \n\n![](images/0831604d55b28e0f58e32e8fcc84fd77d49a3debf60d1eee3c2cdbf336dd1b3d.jpg)  \nFigure2 Venture Capital Investment into US Startups between 1985 and 2019, by Sector  \n\nSource: Data are drawn from the National Venture Capital Association's yearbooks and related resources.

Biopharmaceuticals and Medical Devices refer to startups in the following categories: Biopharmaceuticals and Medical Devices and Equipment  \n\nNote: This exhibit reports investment by venture capital investors into US startups between 1985 and 2019, broken down by four distinct sectors.  \n\nto information technology comprising social networks, applications for consumers, and software and services related to enhancing business productivity. Approximately 5 percent of investments are classified as being related to health care, materials, and energy.  \n\nThis shift in Charles River's portfolio reflects the patterns of the industry at large, as Figure 2 depicts. By way of preface, it should be noted that it is difficult to trace fine-grained industry categories over multiple decades. New categories of firms (such as social networks and digital media) have emerged. Moreover, firms do not always fit neatly into a single classification: for example, Uber is a software firm, a transportation firm, and a consumer service firm. With these caveats duly noted, in Figure 2 we categorize firms into four broad classifications that are reasonably comparable over time: computer software, hardware of many types (from energy to instruments to semiconductors), business and consumer products/services, and medical, including biopharmaceuticals.  \n\nHardware dominated the investments made by venture capital in the period from 1985 to 1989, accounting for 42 percent of dollars invested into startups by venture capital. Software and service startups accounted for nearly the same share of investments made in 1985-1989, while biopharmaceuticals and medical devices represented most of the remainder. The figure also shows the large shift in focus of venture capital firms away from hardware and towards software and service businesses. Biopharmaceutical and medical device startups have received approximately the same share of funding. However, the chart masks the fact that this investment now comes from a smaller share of venture capital firms specializing in this sector, as opposed to from many generalist venture capital firms.  \n\nThe same concentration of investment on software and related businesses seen in Figure 2 is also seen in the patent data. Using data on the patents filed at the US Patent and Trademark Office over the period 2008-2017, we found that the top ten patent classes using the US Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) system represented 48 percent of all venture capital patents filed over the 2008-2017 period, as compared to 24 percent for the top ten patent classes for patents not filed by venture capital-backed firms.  \n\nThus, while venture funding is very efficacious in stimulating a certain kind of innovative busines, the scope is increasingly limited. This concentration may be privately optimal from the perspective of the venture funds and those who provide them with capital. It is natural to worry, however, about the social implications of these shifts. For instance, promising startups developing renewable energy technologies and advanced materials, which might have broad societal benefits, may languish unfunded.  \n\nThe reader might well raise eyebrows at this suggestion. If value-creating entrepreneurial investment opportunities exist, should some other investor step in? Certainly, we have seen corporations in sectors such as energy making investments in young firms. But as we will discuss in the final section, these efforts to date have been far from resounding successes.  \n\n### The Disproportionate Role of a Few Deep-Pocketed Investors  \n\nVenture activity is concentrated. Yes, the National Venture Capital Association estimates that there were a little over 1,000 US venture capital funds in 2019. But a small number of large venture capital firms hold the vast majority of capital.  \n\nTo illustrate this point, we created a list of all institutional venture capital investors that made at least one investment into a US-headquartered startup in 2018. For these investors, we examined the total funds they had raised from 2014 to 2018: approximately $\\$284$ billion raised by 985 investors. Looking at the concentration in the capital raised by these investors provides a good proxy for the concentration in assets under management across institutional venture capital investors. The top 50 investors, or about 5 percent of the venture capital firms, raised half of the total capital over this period.5  \n\nThe large inflow of capital in the last decade has further concentrated capital in the hands of top funds. The reasons for this are worth further inquiry but are likely, at least in part, due to strong persistence in the relative performance of the venture capital funds (Kaplan and Schoar 2005; Harris et al. 2014).6 A small number of higher-performing venture capital firms have continued to raise ever-larger funds.  \n\nMoreover, these deep-pocketed investors can play a disproportionate role in driving where other investors put their money. Investors with smaller sums of capital under management typically focus on investments at the earliest stages of a startup's life, well before the startup is profitable or even has revenue. These earlystage venture capital investors often do not have the capital to continue financing startups across subsequent rounds to the point where the firm can be sold for an attractive valuation. Thus, they are dependent on their larger peers to step in and continue financing the firms they initially funded. Consequentially, a major worry for early investors is that an otherwise healthy startup might not be able to raise follow-up capital (Nanda and Rhodes-Kropf 2017). In this way, the preferences of large late-stage investors can shape where early-stage investors are willing to invest. Consistent with this suggestion, Howell et al. (2020) find that early-stage venture capital appears to be particularly sensitive to market conditions when examining recessions during the past half-century.  \n\nConcerns about a small number of financiers acting as gatekeepers may be particularly salient when considering the characteristics of these financiers. We highlight three dimensions. First, major venture funds are based in a handful of places. In the United States, National Venture Capital Association statistics suggest that three metropolitan areas—the San Francisco Bay Area, Greater New York, and Greater Boston—account for about two-thirds of the venture capital deployed by firms each year.7 The same phenomenon also seems to manifest itself globally, though good statistics are hard to find. For instance, a tabulation of PitchBook data between 2015 and 2017 by Florida and Hathaway (2018) concludes that the top 25 urban areas accounted for 75 percent of all disbursements globally. Given this concentration of capital, the startup community has rearranged itself to “follow the money.\"  \n\nWhy might the resulting geographic concentration be a cause for concern? After all, economists have long pointed out that there are increasing returns to scale in entrepreneurial and innovative activity. Regions like Silicon Valley have an abundance of resources for entrepreneurs, ranging from excellent engineers used to working long hours for risky stock options, knowledgeable patent attorneys, and of course, lots of financiers. As a result, there are real social benefits from geographic concentration of entrepreneurs.  \n\nOn the other hand, the geographic concentration of venture capital has probably accelerated the “hollowing out\" of innovative activities in many other parts of the world. Venture firms based in other cities might have chosen very different firms to invest in given their perspectives on their local economies. More generally, Glaeser and Hausman (2020) have documented in the United States the growing hubs of innovative activity in places far removed from the areas with the greatest economic need, a phenomenon that the growth of venture capital has accelerated.  \n\nTable3 Characteristics of Key US-based Investment Professionals in the 50 Largest Venture Capital Firms   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>paspq-s partners</td><td>US-basedpartnerswith atleastoneboardseat</td></tr><tr><td>TotalnumberofPartners</td><td>416</td><td>265</td></tr><tr><td>Sharemale</td><td>82%</td><td>92%</td></tr><tr><td>Share attended topuniversities</td><td>59%</td><td>72%</td></tr><tr><td>SharewithMBAfromHarvard</td><td>12%</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td>SharewithMBAfromStanford</td><td>9%</td><td>13%</td></tr><tr><td>SharelocatedinBayArea</td><td>69%</td><td>69%</td></tr><tr><td>SharelocatedinGreaterBoston</td><td>9%</td><td>11%</td></tr><tr><td>Sharelocated inNewYorkCity</td><td>14%</td><td>11%</td></tr><tr><td>Averagenumber ofboardseatsheld</td><td></td><td>6.1</td></tr><tr><td>Mediannumberofboardseatsheld</td><td></td><td>5</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nSource: Data are drawn from the PitchBook database. We first restrict investment professionals in these firms to titles that are one of Managing General Partner, Managing Partner, Founding Partner, General Partner, Senior Partner, or Partner and further restrict them to individuals based in the United States. In column 2, we examine a subset of these individuals who also sit on at least one board seat, as some of the firms in our sample have a larger number of individuals with a “Partner\" title than those who make investment decisions or are actively involved in governing startups. Note: This table reports characteristics of the key US-based investment professionals working for the 50 largest venture capital firms reported in Exhibit 5.  \n\nSecond, the background of individual decision-makers at venture firms remains far from representative of the general population. Table 3 focuses on the 417 individuals listed as US-based partners of the top 5 percent of venture capital firms noted above.8 Some firms give “partner” titles to a larger number of individuals than the true decision-makers in the partnership, so we also examine the subset of these individuals who sit on at least one corporate board. This restriction narrows the set of individuals to 265.  \n\nTable 3 documents the composition of this group. Eighty percent of partners are male; among the set of partners with at least one board seat, 9l percent are male. Three-quarters of partners with at least one board seat attended either an Ivy League school, or one of Caltech, MIT, or Stanford; moreover, nearly 30 percent of these individuals are graduates of just Harvard Business School or the Stanford Graduate School of Business. In terms of location, 69 percent are based in the Bay Area alone and over 90 percent are based in either the Bay Area, Greater Boston, OrNewYork.  \n\nThe nonrepresentative nature of the decision makers at these firms is important because of the growing evidence that a lack of diversity among venture capitalists has an impact on what businesses get funded. For example, Gompers and Wang (2017) use the number of daughters of venture capital partners as an instrumental variable and show that it is correlated with a higher proportion of female partners and improved deal and fund performance. Ewens and Townsend (2020) document that male and female investors appear to have gendered preferences (or respond to different signals about potential cash flows) in terms of the companies they back. Understanding whether such frictions are consequential enough to influence the nature of innovations that are backed and the choice of products faced by consumers is an important question that we believe deserves more research.  \n\nA final concern, more difficult to document, relates to the criteria that these investors use to make decisions more generally (Gompers et al. 2020). While academics have spent a great deal of time seeking to understand the structure of venture investment agreements and post-deal involvement, the process before the transaction is much less understood. We understand that early-stage investors rely heavily on signals of entrepreneur quality (Bernstein, Korteweg, and Laws 2017), but know very little as to whether the emphasis on these signals is efficient. Recent work by Cao (2019), for example, shows that information frictions from early-stage platforms can lead to systematic downstream effects on firm funding. Given the increasing importance of venture capital for innovation and growth, understanding the way in which these investors acquire and aggregate signals of a venture's potential and the frictions in this process are important and promising areas of future research.  \n\n### A Declining Emphasis on Governance?  \n\nThe third concern we highlight here has to do with the seeming decline in active corporate governance by venture capital funds. Venture capital has traditionally been a tough business, with onerous agreements in which firm founders gave venture capital firms significant stock ownership in exchange for funding (Kaplan and Stromberg 2003). Moreover, this stock ownership was not just “paper rights\": frequent turnover of management driven by venture capital was traditionally the rule (Kaplan, Sensoy, and Stromberg 2009; Ewens and Marx 2018). These patterns have changed dramatically in the past decade. Across the board, “founder friendly\" terms appear to have replaced the more onerous provisions traditionally demanded by venture capitalists.  \n\nSeveral potential explanations can be offered for this change. First, the intense competition between venture capitalists during the 2010s may have led to better terms for corporate founders. Even in less ebullient markets, the most promising entrepreneurs have a lot of discretion from whom they choose to receive funding (Hsu 2004): venture returns are very skewed, with a few deals generating the bulk of the returns (Hall and Woodward 2010). This pattern has been especially true in the last few years, given the proliferation of mega-funds and the explosion in capital from non-traditional investors such as SoftBank, sovereign wealth funds, and corporations. In an intensely competitive market, some venture capital firms may be tempted to pitch entrepreneur-friendly contracts to founders in an attempt to get access to the most attractive deals (Eldar, Hochberg, and Litov 2020). Reflecting this competition, venture capital groups may have chosen to outdo each other in the extent of their hospitality toward company founders.  \n\nTo an economist, however, this explanation raises new puzzles. If the intensive governance provided by venture capitalists is socially beneficial—as generations of academic analyses would suggest—-why would groups choose to abandon it? Should not venture firms compete instead by offering entrepreneurs progressively higher valuations (and less dilution of their initial equity stakes), not by abandoning governance provisions? Does this explanation also imply that firm founders may underestimate the need for governance?  \n\nOther possible explanations for the decline in governance, however, may suggest deeper structural drivers of this trend. For example, a possible explanation reflects the changing dynamics of early- and later-stage investing discussed above. It has become far cheaper to start a new business. Perhaps the capital that firms need at the earliest stage is too small to make it worthwhile for venture capital firms to engage in active governance. Indeed, some venture capital firms have adopted the \"spray and pray\" investment strategy at the seed stage of financing, in which they focus on learning about the potential of a venture before spending time governing it (Ewens, Nanda, and Rhodes-Kropf 2018).  \n\nIn addition, the massive inflow of venture capital from investors that usually focus on the public market may have changed the focus of contractual rights at later stages. A single fund manager in these entities may hold hundreds of separate firms and have little experience directly governing the firms in their portfolio. These passive investors are unlikely to have the capabilities to provide effective governance to the entrepreneurial ventures. As Chernenko, Lerner, and Zeng (2017) document, mutual funds seem far more concerned with ensuring that there is a path to liquidity, reflecting the short-term nature of the capital that they have raised from investors. The changing composition of the capital sources may have thus also led to a reduced focus on governance.  \n\nThere is a reason to fear that even among traditional venture capital investors, governance may decline for structural reasons. As firms stay private longer, venture capital investors may end up sitting on a larger number of company boards. Put another way, the classic structure of venture funds may have begun to get overwhelmed by the flow of outside money, new financial intermediaries, and the associated change in practices. As a result, venture capital-backed firms may not be receiving the same degree of governance.  \n\nWhatever the causes, there are a number of high-profile examples in recent years in which the charismatic founder of a “unicorn\" company has been ousted. The departures of founders and chief executive officers like Travis Kalanick at Uber,  \n\nElizabeth Holmes at Theranos, and Adam Neumann at WeWork are quite different in their details. But overall, they illustrate some consequences of allowing entrepreneurs with limited prior management experience to raise enormous sums for new ventures with little in the way of formal oversight and governance protections. Understanding why traditional venture capital contractual provisions have faded in importance and their social welfare implications appears to be a promising area of future research for both theorists and empiricists alike.  \n\n## New Approaches for Venture Capital  \n\nVenture capital has been a highly efficacious way to support certain kinds of innovation, as reflected in the importance of venture-backed companies in the stock market and in the economy as a whole. At the same time, the industry has important limitations. We now turn to some ideas that might help the venture capital industry to become more effective, with a recognition that these hypotheses may be of greater interest to those practitioners and academics interested in thinking \"outside the box.\" We highlight two sets of ideas: the first, which owes a heavy debt to Lerner (2012), relates to the organizational and incentive structure of venture capital partnerships; the second, to the way in which venture capital firms focus on managing their investments in more challenging sectors.  \n\n### Rethinking Venture Capital Partnerships  \n\nSince the early days of the industry, venture capital funds have been eight to ten years in length, with provisions for one or more one- to two-year extensions. Venture capitalists typically have five years in which to invest the capital and then are expected to use the remaining period to harvest their investments.  \n\nThe uniformity of these rules is puzzling. Funds differ tremendously in their investment foci: from quick-hit social media businesses to long-gestating biotechnology projects. In periods when the public markets are enthusiastic, venture capitalists may be able to exit still-immature firms that have yet to show profits and, in some cases, before they even have revenues. But as discussed above, there is tremendous variation in the maturation of firms in different industries. Certainly, within corporate research laboratories, great diversity across industries exists in terms of the typical project length. What explains the constancy of the venture fund lives?  \n\nOne possible explanation is that a reasonably short fund life seems to have been the norm in limited partnerships of all types. For example, many of the other arenas where limited partnerships were employed in the 20th century, such as real estate, oil-and-gas exploration, and maritime shipping, all were reasonably short-lived. In the formative days of venture partnerships, the lawyers drafting the agreements may have gravitated to the relatively short fund lives that were common in other contexts. With the passage of time, such arrangements have then been taken as gospel by limited and general partners alike.  \n\nAnother factor behind the persistence of the ten-year agreement has been the resistance of limited partners——that is, the investors in the venture capital fundsto longer fund lives. These investors may fear that if they give the funds to a sub-standard venture group for a longer period, they will be stuck paying fees until the end of time for very limited returns. This reluctance may tell us more about the outsized nature of the fees that venture funds receive than about the inherent desirability of a longerlived fund.  \n\nIndeed, the manner in which venture capitalists are compensated has changed little, even as the funds have grown much larger. Venture groups typically receive a share of the capital gains they generate (typically 20 percent, but sometimes as high as 30 percent) and then an annual management fee (often between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent of capital under management, though it often scales down in later years). Such fees are quite modest for a fund of only a few million dollars in size: it is likely to cover only a very modest salary for the partners once the costs of an office, travel, and support staff are factored in.  \n\nBut this compensation structure has remained largely unchanged as funds have become substantially larger. Moreover, as venture capital groups begin managing hundreds of millions or billions of dollars, substantial economies of scale\" appear: put another way, as a group becomes ten times larger, expenses increase much less than tenfold. As a result, management fees themselves become a profit center for the firm. These steady profits may create incentives of their own which may not be very appealing to investors. For instance, there will be an incentive to raise a larger fund at the expense of lower returns, which in turn may be tied to the greater concentration of capital held by a few investors; an incentive to put funds to work quickly and with a subpar amount of vetting so that a new fund can be raised sooner; and an incentive to focus on excessively safe investments that will not have as much upside but will pose less risk of a franchise-damaging visible failure.  \n\nJust how large a temptation the venture capital compensation scheme can pose is illustrated in the work of Metrick and Yasuda (2010), who show that of every $\\$100$ invested by the limited partners, over $\\$23$ end up in the pockets of the venture investors. These sums might not be disturbing if the very substantial payouts to each partner reflected even larger returns being made by the limited partners in the fund. But profit sharing is not the most important source of compensation. Instead, almost two-thirds of the income (in time-adjusted dollars) is coming from the venture capital management fees, which remain fixed whether the fund does well or poorly. These incentives clearly may motivate groups to add capital in excess of the growth of partners, even if performance suffers somewhat.  \n\nInterestingly, an alternative model already exists: the way that venture capital groups used to operate. Early venture capital groups, beginning with the pioneering partnership of Draper, Gaither & Anderson, negotiated budgets annually with their investors. The venture capitalists would lay out the projected expenses and salaries and reach a mutual agreement with the limited partners about these costs. The fees would be intended to cover these costs, but no more. (A few “old school\" groups such as Greylock still use such an arrangement.) Such negotiated fees greatly reduce the temptation to grow at the expense of performance and ultimately are likely to lead to more successful and innovative startups.  \n\nWhat explains the traditional reluctance of the limited partners who invest in venture capital funds to push to change these compensation arrangements? Staff members may not really understand the economics of the funds, or they may fear that rocking the boat would limit their own ability to get a high-paying position at a fund or an intermediary in the future. Alternatively, the officers may worry that developing a reputation as an activist would jeopardize their organization's ability to access the funds with the highest returns. The last concern is a reasonable one. After the giant California Public Employees’ Retirement System led a consortium of pension funds who pushed for an overhaul of private equity compensation in the mid-1990s, they were shunned by venture and buyout funds alike. In recent years, we have seen more collective discussion of these issues by limited partners in meetings of the Institutional Limited Partners Association. But many of their proposals have been modest half-measures, without addressing the more fundamental issues.  \n\nYet another question is why such innovations are not adopted by newer venture firms as a way to differentiate themselves? It might be thought that such “LP-friendly\" terms might attract new investors. While examples along these lines have occurred, anecdotal evidence suggests that many groups who have tried such an approach have found it to be tough sledding. In part, limited partners may interpret such concessions as an adverse signal, indicative of a lack of confidence on the part of the new fund managers in their ability to raise a fund. Additionally, even if the group responsible for private equity investments at the pension fund understands the advantages of the proposed alternative arrangement, the investment committee that ultimately makes the decisions at the pension fund may not. These information problems may lead to the persistence of a socially suboptimal fund structure.  \n\n### New Approaches to Managing Investments  \n\nVenture capital firms face huge uncertainty about the ultimate potential of startup firms. Indeed, over half the investments of even the most successful venture capital investors fail, while the vast majority of returns are generated by a few extremely successful investments that are hard to predict upfront.  \n\nAs noted before, venture capital investors are drawn to sectors in which this uncertainty can be reduced quickly. Staged financing is therefore not only valuable to venture capital investors as a governance tool, but also as a method of learning about the startup's potential through a sequence of investments over time. This approach to evaluating and governing ventures in software industries has been outlined in practitioner guides such as The Lean Startup (Ries 2011).  \n\nBut the ability to learn quickly about the promise of new ventures is harder if there is substantial regulatory, technology, and market risk, which we suggest explains the poor performance and declining share of venture investment outside of software. For example, forecasting the unit costs associated with energy storage at scale using a new battery material can be extremely difficult, even if the technology works in a controlled laboratory environment. Because uncertainty about market demand is tied to firms’ ability to produce at a certain price point, forecasting demand in this setting is hard.  \n\nOne promising response to these challenges is to rethink the organizational model for incubating and financing “tough tech\" ventures. The venture approach entails entrepreneurs coming to venture capital firms to pitch them new ideas and the firms deciding whether to fund them. This approach has the benefit of enabling the investors to maintain an arm's length relationship from the entrepreneurial team, reducing the entrenchment that is sometimes associated with corporate research and development and internal capital markets.  \n\nAn alternative approach that has begun to be used by some venture capital investors specializing in biopharmaceuticals (such as Third Rock Ventures and Flagship Pioneering)is to incubate and finance ideas in-house. This process has the benefit of reducing asymmetric information because much of the staff for the team of entrepreneurs comes from within the fund. It also enables the venture capital firm to fund what it might believe is the most promising idea or approach as opposed to selecting among the ideas that walked in the door. A related approach is illustrated by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, which has a team of in-house scientists who jointly make investment decisions with traditional investment partners. Such new approaches may hold promise for widening the scope of venture capital investment. Understanding the tradeoffs associated with bringing incubation inside the venture capital firm and organizing new ventures more like corporate research and development seems to be a promising area of academic research.  \n\nIt is also natural to wonder whether collaboration with other parties— governments, non-profits, and corporations—might alleviate some of the barriers to financing new ventures in more difficult technologies. Of course, this suggestion is not new. Governments have been involved with the promotion of venture capital at least since 1946, when a consortium of the Bank of England and leading British banks combined to create the British firm 3i as a vehicle to make long-term investments in smaller firms. Corporations have been collaborating with venture capitalists since the 1960s. Universities and other nonprofits have been incubating, mentoring, and directly financing new ventures for much of the last half-century.  \n\nBut the track record of these collaborative efforts has been quite mixed. There have been successes, such as the Israeli government's jump-starting of its venture industry through the Yozma program that leveraged public money to attract private investment, or the success of many pharmaceutical firms in responding to the biotechnology revolution through their venturing initiatives. At the same time, anecdotes abound of naive officials making poor decisions. For instance, the leadership of Boston University put one-third of the university endowment into a single faculty-founded biotechnology company, Seragen, an investment that was ultimately sold for pennies on the dollar. 9  \n\nThe statistical evidence on collaborative efforts, while limited, does not seem inspiring. For instance, the Thomson Reuters (now Refinitiv) database suggests that between 1993 and 2013, corporate venture funds lost 4 percent per annum, at a time when US venture funds had annual returns of nearly 30 percent (for a more optimistic view, see Ma 2020).  \n\nWe believe that these collaborations can be beneficial, but only if executed correctly. This caveat is important. As an example, we will highlight the role of US government in the venture market. The primary mechanism through which government policy interacts directly with new ventures is through the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. A striking study by Howell (2017) suggests that the initial Phase I awards under this program have very positive effects on new technology ventures, doubling the probability that a firm receives venture capital and boosting patenting and revenue. But these Phase I awards made up only 20 percent total of the $\\$2.8$ billion spent on the program (US Small Business Administration 2018). The bulk of the funding goes to larger Phase II awards, which Howell argues have no positive impacts. Similarly, both Howell (2017) and Lerner (1999) document that a relatively small number of companies capture a disproportionate number of awards. These “SBIR mills\" commercialize far fewer projects than those firms that receive just one or a handful of SBIR grants, but the repeat winners often have active staffs of lobbyists in Washington scouring for award opportunities. Despite these wellunderstood issues, the design of the program looks virtually identical to its initial manifestation in 1977. There has been almost no serious discussion in Washington regarding the idea of shifting more SBIR resources to Phase I grants or curtailing grants to “mills.\" The experience of the SBIR program underscores the need for careful initial design, painstaking evaluation, and a willingness to redesign initiatives.  \n\nOne promising area of recent growth has been the interest among philanthropic organizations in financing early-stage, high-risk research and development. The hope is that once sufficient development of the idea has taken place, private venture capitalists will be willing to step in. Such activities have been most visible of late in the early-stage financing of vaccines, including for COVID-19. Beyond healthcare, efforts are also emerging to finance initial investments in sectors that have substantial potential societal benefits but large risks. Mllustrations include the Prime Coalition's funding of companies that combat climate change yet are sufficiently risky to deter traditional investors (at https:/ /primecoalition.org/what-is-prime/) and the initiative from the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations to seed venture funds investing in regions that have traditionally not attracted such capital (as reported in Murray 2020; see also the Community Development Venture Capital Alliance at https:/ /cdvca.org/about-us/missionhistory). While these efforts are likely to face substantial challenges, they also have real potential.  \n\n## Final Thoughts  \n\nThe growth of venture capital in the past decade, both in the United States and worldwide, is an important validation of the underlying model. At the same time, the period has brought into sharp relief the structural challenges facing the industry.  \n\nOver the past decades, academics and practitioners alike have highlighted the strengths of venture capital. Understanding and articulating its limitations as well as how institutional innovations can address them, is an important challenge to both groups going forward.  \n\n## References  \n\nAgrawal, Ajay, Christian Catalini, and Avi Goldfarb. 2016. “Are Syndicates the Killer App of Equity Crowdfunding?” California Management Review 58 (2): 111-124.   \nAnte, Spencer E. 2008.

    "reference_markdown": "# Venture capital exit after venture IPO  \n\nYongLi1 丨 Tailan Chi2 丨 Sai Lan3 |Qing Wang  \n\n1University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA   \n2University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, UA   \n3EMLYON Business School, Shanghai, China   \n4Sun Yat-Sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China  \n\nCorrespondence   \nYong Li, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, NV, USA.   \nEmail: yong.li@unlv.edu   \nSai Lan, EMLYON Business School, Shanghai, China.   \nEmail: lan@em-lyon.com  \n\n# Abstract  \n\nResearch Summary: Venture capital firms (VCs) sometimes continue to hold significant equity stakes in entrepreneurial ventures after venture IPO. The information economics view suggests that retaining equity signals VC commitment and venture quality. This study conceptualizes retaining equity as holding an exchange option, the option to exchange VCs' own valuation of IPO ventures for the market's valuation. Holding this option allows VCs to benefit from the ventures' upside potential. Since exit amounts to giving up the option, the option value represents an opportunity cost of exit. VCs may delay exit if this option is sufficiently valuable. The study examines two key conditions that interact to increase the value of this option: uncertainty and positive private information. This study contributes to research on VC exit and real options.  \n\nManagerial Summary: When do VCs retain equity rather than exit after venture IPO? Researchers have addressed the impact of signaling, cash constraints, human capital constraints, blockholding, VC fund performance, portfolio diversification and institutional features. We identify a previously unrecognized driver: to retain the opportunity to benefit from an IPO venture's upside potential that is yet to be fully recognized or realized. We submit that VCs' incentive to retain equity increases with uncertainty in the venture's industry, and VCs' positive private information as indicated by venture patent applications and positive market surprises in the venture's industry. We find largely supportive evidence for the positive joint effect of uncertainty and private information on the decision to retain equity within the first year or even two years after IPO lockup expiration.  \n\n# KEYWORDS  \n\ninformation asymmetry, IPO, real options, uncertainty, venture capital exit  \n\n# 1丨 INTRODUCTION  \n\nVenture capital plays a pivotal role in fostering entrepreneurship, innovation and economic growth (Kortum & Lerner, 2000; Sahlman, 1990). VC firms (VCs) provide financial support and value-adding services to entrepreneurial ventures (Hallen & Eisenhardt, 2012; Kortum & Lerner, 2000; Pahnke et al., 2015; Sapienza, 1992; Sorensen, 2007). Upon venture success, VCs exit by cashing out of their equity investment, most prominently through the initial public offering (IPO) of ventures (Brav & Gompers, 2003; Colombo et al., 2022; Henderson & Graebner, 2023; Lungeanu & Zajac, 2016; Wang &Wan, 2013).  \n\nExtensive research in entrepreneurship and management has offered insights into the antecedents (e.g., Cabral et al., 2021; Dushnitsky & Lavie, 2010; Mohammadi & Khashabi, 2021; Wuebker et al., 2015), processes (e.g., Basu et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2023; Kang et al., 2011; Petty et al., 2023; Souitaris & Zerbinati, 2014), and consequences of VC investments (e.g., Devarakonda & Liu, 2023; Forti et al, 2020; Gerasymenko et al., 2015; Matusik & Fitza, 2012; Park & Steensma, 2013; Smith & Shah, 2013; Wright et al., 2016). Research has also shed light on VC investments in corporations (Dushnitsky & Lenox, 2005; Gaba & Bhattacharya, 2012; Hill et al., 2009; Huang & Madhavan, 2021) and across borders (Fernhaber et al.,2009; Guler & Guillen, 2010; Iriyama et al., 2010). These studies have predominantly examined the interactions between VCs and entrepreneurial ventures prior to an exit event suchasventureIpo.  \n\nLittle research has addressed the post-IPO VC-venture dynamics including VCs' decision to retain equity or cash out (Arikan & Capron, 2010; Ozmel et al, 2020). This decision is strategically important because, while retaining equity gives VCs the opportunity to realize the potential of investee ventures, cashout allows VCs to recoup their investment and reallocate resources to other promising ventures (e.g., Black & Gilson, 1998; Bock & Schmidt, 2015; Smith, 2005). VC exit post-IPO is distinct from general stock trading, because it is intricately linked to the pre-IPO interactions between VCs and investee ventures; the relationship-specific knowledge and private information accumulated prior to IPO (Weber et al., 2016; Wuebker et al., 2015) is largely nonexistent in stock trading.  \n\nSince VCs will ultimately divest all their holdings in investee ventures, existing literature has largely assumed that VCs will cash out immediately upon venture public listing (Ball et al., 2011; Bayar & Chemmanur, 2012; Yao & O'Neill, 2022). In practice, however, many VCs continue to hold equity ownership even when they can cash out (e.g., after IPO lockup expiration) (Owen & Suchard, 2013; Paeglis & Veeren, 2013). This suggests that VCs have some discretion as to whether and when to exit upon venture IPO. Analysis of a cross-country sample indicates that around one third up to one half of IPOs are partially exited 1 year after lockup expiration (Cumming $\\&$ Maclntosh, 2003). Because retaining equity is such a common practice, it is important to understand when VCs will retain equity or cash out upon venture IPO.  \n\nThis question has drawn limited academic attention. One plausible explanation based on information economics is that, in the presence of information asymmetry between insiders (entrepreneurs and VCs) and outsiders (general market participants) (Gompers & Lerner, 1998), VCs can resort to retaining equity upon venture IPO to signal their commitment and venture quality (e.g., Cumming & Maclntosh, 2003). This view is based on the premise that the insiders possess private information that cannot be communicated credibly to the market. It follows that VCs will exit if the market valuation of newly public ventures meets or exceeds VCs'.  \n\nThis study explores another plausible explanation that remains largely unexplored. That is, retaining equity gives VCs the opportunity to benefit from the upside potential of newly public investee ventures whose value, from an insider's perspective, has yet to be fully recognized or realized. Existing literature has alluded to the fact that retaining equity in newly public ventures allows VCs to continue advice until investee ventures realize their potential (Barry et al., 1990; Brav & Gompers, 1997; Megginson & Weiss, 1991). The current study develops a theoretical framework to capture this intuition. Cashing out means that a VC sells all its equity stakes in an IPO venture at the market price, but retaining at least some of the equity stakes gives the VC the option to benefit from the upside potential of the market price of the venture equity stock while keeping the downside risk in check. Therefore, cashing out is essentially an exchange of theVC's own valuation of the venture for the market's valuation.We thus conceptualize the VC's decision to retain equity as holding an exchange option, which enables the VC to continue its engagement with the venture and gain from the upside potential of the market price within the given timeframe (e.g., before the end of fund life); cashing out is analogous to exercising (and thus killing) the exchange option.  \n\nIn this conceptualization, the decision to retain equity or cash out depends in part on the value of the exchange option. We explicate that uncertainty and information asymmetry, as two key determinants of the exchange option value, interact to affect the VC exit decision upon venture IPO. Unlike information asymmetry that concerns one party knowing more than the other in an economic exchange, uncertainty can be understood intuitively (and approximately) as that there is an upside potential and a downside risk in an investment project but that a priori it is unknown to the exchange parties how the investment will unfold in the future (Dixit & Pindyck, 1994).  \n\nWe expect that an increase in exogenous industry uncertainty raises the value of the option and the VC's incentive to retain equity after venture IPO. This is because the exchange option enables the VC to exploit the upside potential by exercising the option under favorable conditions and to keep the downside risk in check by holding on to its equity under unfavorable conditions. We further posit that the VC's private information about the venture's value reinforces the effect of uncertainty on the incentive to retain equity. The VC's more positive (or less negative) private information drives the wedge between the VC's valuation and the market price, but a rise in uncertainty widens the unexpected fluctuations in the valuations by both the VC and the market and thus makes it likely for the market's valuation to catch up with and exceed the VC's valuation sooner. We empirically test how uncertainty and private information interact to encourage retaining equity upon venture IPO and find largely supportive evidence based on logit andCoxestimations.  \n\nThis study offers a novel explanation for the VC's decision to retain equity after venture IPO. Prior studies from the information economics perspective have offered the insight that VCs' retained equity after venture IPO signals VC commitment and venture quality, and mitigates the information asymmetry problem between insiders and outsiders (e.g., Cumming & Maclntosh, 2003). Under this rationale, the VC will exit the venture so long as the market valuation is equal to or higher than the VC's valuation. In comparison, this study offers a real options rationale that provides a theoretical explanation for the intuition that the VC sometimes decides to retain equity with expectations to capture greater returns in uncertain times. Under this rationale, cashout is not justified unless the market valuation exceeds the VC's by a margin that is equal to or greater than the value of the exchange option. The value of the exchange option can be understood as an opportunity cost of cashing out immediately under uncertainty after ventureIPo.  \n\nThis study represents the first analysis on exchange options in entrepreneurship and VC research. A large stream of literature has taken a real options approach on strategic entrepreneurship (e.g., Contigiani $\\&$ Levinthal, 2019; Klingebiel, 2012; Lee et al., 2007; Ross et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021) and VC (Bouvard, 2014; Guler, 2007; Li, 2008; Sahaym et al., 2010; Van de Vrande & Vanhaverbeke, 2013; Willner, 1995). This real options approach highlights a distinct mechanism for VCs to create value, which is to act flexibly (e.g., through staging and portfolio investment) under uncertainty to capture the upside potential and contain the downside exposure of entrepreneurial opportunities (Zahra et al., 2024). This stream of literature has largely investigated VC investment and divestment decisions that are embedded with standalone call or put options prior to venture IPO (e.g., Hsu, 2010; Li, 2008; Li & Chi, 2013; Li & Mahoney, 2011; Wadhwa & Basu, 2013). For example, corporate VCs (Ceccagnoli et al., 2018; Tong & Li, 2011) can be viewed as making a toehold investment in a multi-stage process to gain access to future growth opportunities (e.g., a window on future technologies) (Dushnitsky & Lenox, 2005; Dushnitsky & Shaver,2009).  \n\nThe current study starts with the premise that the opportunity to exit after venture IPO is an important driver for VCs to fund entrepreneurship in the first place (Black & Gilson, 1998; Gompers & Lerner, 2002; Smith, 2005). Through the equity retained after venture IPO, the VC holds an exchange option. Unlike standalone options, exercise of this option via cashing out involves the simultaneous exercise of a call option on the market's valuation and a put option on the VC's valuation-hence the term “exchange option.\" Since the value of the exchange option depends on both uncertainty and private information, our empirical analysis underscores how these two hallmarks of VC investment (Amit et al., 1998; Gompers, 1995; Li, 2008) interact to affect VC exit decisions. Because this interaction effect does not obtain from the information economics perspective alone, it provides some discriminating evidence for the real options explanation we offer.  \n\n# 2丨 THEORY  \n\nWe start by showing conceptually that, with nontrivial uncertainty, the information economics view that VCs will exit after venture IPOif the market'svaluation of investee ventures meets or exceeds VCs' does not necessarily hold. We then elaborate on how the option to retain equity after venture IPO is distinct from the VC investment and divestment options that prior research has analyzed.  \n\nVC exit after venture IPO is predicated on the pre-IPO interactions between the VC and the investee venture that are largely nonexistent in general stock trading. Prior to venture IPO, VCs perform monitoring (and advising) activities regularly and frequently through communications, reports and site visits (Sahlman, 199o). Because such interactions with the investee tend to be repeated over an extended period of time (e.g., 5-7 years), VCs can accumulate relationship-specific knowledge about entrepreneurs and ventures, which gives VCs better access to information about ventures and greater knowledge of their prospects (Gompers & Lerner, 1998). Further, repeated interactions help suppress opportunism and build trust between VCs and entrepreneurs, which increases entrepreneurs' willingness to disclose private information voluntarily.  \n\nAfter venture IPO, information asymmetry remains between VCs as insiders and market participants as outsiders (Arthurs et al., 2009; Brau et al., 2005; Cohen & Dean, 2005; Cumming & Maclntosh, 2003; Cumming & Walz, 2010; Sanders & Boivie, 2004), with VCs having an informational advantage over market participants because of the preIPO relationship (Gompers, 1995; Sahlman, 1990). Even though the IPO price has the VC's consent, the VC may well hope to sell at least a portion of its equity at a higher price later if the VC expects that the venture's future performance will provide the market with certain positive information that is already known to insiders at the time but cannotbe credibly revealed to outsiders.  \n\nOne remedying mechanism to overcome such information asymmetry, as suggested by extant research (e.g., Cumming & Maclntosh, 2003), is for the VC to signal the quality of the venture through retained equity. Retaining equity can be a credible signal in separating the higher quality ventures from the lower quality ones because the downside risk and costs of retaining equity in lower quality ventures will likely be greater than in higher qualityventures(Gompers $\\&$ Lerner, 2002; Leland & Pyle, 1977; Spence, 1973).  \n\nThis explanation is incomplete, however, in view of another hallmark of the VC exit decision: uncertainty (Li, 2008). The growth prospects of the venture after public listing are still surrounded by uncertainty (Li et al., 2007; Trigeorgis, 1996). Prior to IPO, the value of the venture's assets usually experiences high fluctuations without showing a clear trend. IPO is a major milestone to demonstrate that the market has a positive expectation of the value of the venture's assets at the time of IPO (Shane & Stuart, 2002). Nevertheless, the value creating potential of the venture post-IPO is still subject to unpredictable technological development and market demand, among other things. As in the classic real options literature, we focus on such exogenous uncertainty that is not subject to the influence or control of individual parties in an exchange and affects the valuations of both the VC and the relevant marketparticipants.  \n\nThis study combines the concepts of uncertainty and information asymmetry into an expanded real options framework to gain a fuller understanding of the VC exit decision after venture IPO. Under uncertainty, new information about the venture, the industry and the economy can be expected to arrive on a continual basis. The mere possibility for new information to emerge, however, does not embed any real option in the equity that the VC retains in the venture. A second condition that is also necessary for its retained equity to afford the VC a valuable option is the presence of information asymmetry between the VC and general market participants. So long as the VC retains equity in the venture post-IPO, the VC maintains privileged access to both new information that arrives after venture IPO and superior knowledge for assessing such information. Our analysis thus starts with the premise that, in the presence of uncertainty, both the market's valuation and the VC's valuation will evolve stochastically over time, and that because of the VC's asymmetric access to new information in the future, the changes in the two valuations will be imperfectly correlated.  \n\nWith the above discussion, we submit that retaining equity after venture IPO confers the VC an exchange option. We now show that the factors that determine the value of this option will affect the VC exit decision. We use the following symbols to aid clarity in our analysis.  \n\n$V_{t}=\\mathsf{V C}^{\\prime}\\mathsf{s}$ valuation of the venture's assets at time t   \n· $\\boldsymbol{M}_{t}=$ market's valuation of the same assets at time t   \n· $\\Delta V_{t}=$ change in VC's valuation over a given time increment $\\Delta t$ , that is, $\\Delta V_{t}=V_{t+\\Delta t}-V_{t}$   \n。 $\\Delta M_{t}=$ change in the market's valuation over a given time increment △t, that is, $\\Delta M_{t}=M_{t+\\Delta t}-M_{t}$ $O_{t}=$ value of the exchange option at time t  \n\nWe can think of the VC's valuation $V_{t}$ as the expected value of the discounted cash flows from holding the venture's equity indefinitely or, more realistically, till the end of a time horizon $T$ (e.g., the end of the VC fund life in our context). In other words, $V_{t}$ represents the VC's payoff from the venture in dividends plus a possible terminal value at T. The market's valuation is the value of its equity based on the price at which the venture's equity shares can be divested. The correlation between the changes in the two variables in a time increment $\\Delta t$ is ${\\mathsf{C O R R}}(\\Delta M_{t},\\Delta V_{t})<1$ and can be expected to fall with greater information asymmetry between the VC and market participants. The twin conditions of uncertainty and information asymmetry imply that their valuations start at different values (i.e., $V_{O}>M_{O})$ , will evolve along separate paths, and are expected to converge over time as information asymmetry resolves.  \n\nThe option is an exchange option because the exercise of the option involves the VC exchanging its own valuation of theventure's equity $V_{t}$ for the market's valuation $M_{t}$ .WhiletheVCisexpectedtosellitsequityatthemarket price whenever $M_{t}\\geq V_{t}$ from an information economics perspective,the real options perspective suggests that the optimal decision rule is for the VC to hold the equity unless $M_{t}-V_{t}\\geq O_{t}$ .where the value of the exchange option $O_{t}$ is greater than 0.1 The objective function of the VC can be expressed as $\\mathsf{m a x}(M_{t}-O_{t},V_{t})$  \n\nIn our context, the VC's option is more valuable when the valuations of the two parties grow more volatile due to greater uncertainty and when the unexpected changes in their valuations become less correlated due to greater information asymmetry between them. We can understand the intuition behind this relationship by analyzing how changesinthetwovariables, $M_{t}$ and $V_{t},$ affectthevaluethattheVCcanobtainfromexercisingtheoption.  \n\nA divergence of the unexpected changes in the valuations, $\\Delta M_{t}-E[\\Delta M_{t}]\\neq\\Delta V_{t}-E[\\Delta V_{t}]$ canbeeitherfavorable or unfavorable to the VC. The value that the VC can gain or lose from selling its equity at the market price can bemeasured as $M_{t}-V_{t}$ . So, whether the pair of unexpected changes in the valuations are favorable or unfavorable canbe determined asfollows.  \n\nreduce the $\\mathsf{l o s s}=\\mathsf{V}_{t}-\\mathsf{M}_{t}$ for $M_{t}<V_{t}$   \nFavorable changes enlargethegain ${\\bf\\Phi}=M_{t}-V_{t}$ for $M_{t}>V_{t}$ enlarge the $\\lvert_{055}=V_{t}-M_{t}$ for $M_{t}<V_{t}$   \nUnfavorable changes ( reduce the gain ${\\bf\\Phi}=M_{t}-V_{t}$ for $M_{t}>V_{t}$  \n\nIt is important to note that, while the VC's loss from a pair of unfavorable changes is bounded from below at O because the VC can keep its equity within the fund lifespan and get $V_{t}$ undertheconditionof $M_{t}-O_{t}<V_{t}$ the VC's gain from exercising the option by selling the equity at a higher market price $M_{t}-O_{t}\\geq V_{t}$ is notbounded.A rise in the volatility of $M_{t}$ and $V_{t}$ or a fall in their correlation increases both the likelihood of the highly favorable changes and the likelihood of the highly unfavorable changes. Because the option enables the VC to benefit more fully from the favorable changes while limiting the effects of the unfavorable changes, the overall effect of a rise in volatility or a fall in correlation on the value of the option is positive. For this reason, from the real options perspective, the exercise of the exchange option (i.e., cashing out) entails an opportunity cost that is equal to the value of the option $O_{t}$ because the exercise requires the VC to give up the value of the option. So, the optimal decision rule is to retain equity unless $M_{t}-V_{t}\\ge O_{t}>0$ rather than $\\boldsymbol{M}_{t}-\\boldsymbol{V}_{t}\\boldsymbol{\\geq}\\boldsymbol{0}$  \n\nThe above analysis suggests that this exit decision has distinct characteristics as compared with the VC investment and divestment decisions prior to venture IPO that have been the focus of extant research. First, the VC may make a small minority equity investment in a venture,which then provides an opportunity to make subsequent investments to capture the upside potential in the venture. In this case, the initial investment confers a growth option (e.g., Li, 2008). In the context of post-IPO exit, however, the VC has been working with the venture for some time and it is well beyond the stage of option creation. Second, prior to a termination event such as IPO, the VC must decide whether to continue or discontinue funding the venture at each milestone, and such decisions have been analyzed as holding or exercising a withdrawal or discontinuation option (Li & Chi, 2013). After IPO, however, the VC has no obligation to inject more capital, and there is a liquid market to buy and sell venture equity. Third, the exchange option embedded in the VC's exit decision is also distinct from an abandonment or exit option (Ozdemir & van den Ende, 2021). An investor is considered to hold an option to abandon a project when the investor can dispose of the asset with an uncertain value at some salvage price that is assumed to be known (possibly zero) (Chi et al., 1997), and an investor is considered to hold an option to exit when the investor can divest an asset with a known value from continued use at an uncertain price (Dixit, 1989). Because both the VC's valuation and the market's valuation are uncertain and can diverge over time in the presence of information asymmetry, neither abandonment option nor exit option accurately conceptualizes the option held by the VC via retained equity in the newly public venture. For these considerations, it is only appropriate to view the VC's exit decision as holding or exercising an exchange option.2 To our best knowledge, no study in strategy and entrepreneurship has recognized the role of exchangeoptions inVCexitdecisions.  \n\n# 3 HYPOTHESES  \n\nWith the conceptual analysis, we advance the idea that a VC's decision to cash out upon venture IPO must account for an additional opportunity cost-the value of the exchange option that is given up in cashing out. The higher the value of the option, the greater the cost of cashing out. The value of the option rises with uncertainty. A higher uncertainty in the valuations by the VC and the market increases the likelihood that the unexpected changes in their valuations will diverge to a greater extent. The exchange option, however, enables the VC to exploit the upside potential by exercising the option under favorable conditions and keep the downside risk in check by holding on to its equity under unfavorable conditions. Hence, an increase in uncertainty raises the value of the option and the VC's incentive to retain equity upon venture IPo.  \n\nThe idea of retaining equity under uncertainty to realize the upside potential of the newly public venture resonates with practitioners.3 According to an investment manager in a leading VC firm, a VC usually has a profit target for its portfolio companies, which can be viewed as indicative of the VC's private valuation in our conceptualization. The investment manager is in charge of the decisions on when to sell the equity of portfolio companies, and he notes, “Based on our calculation, we retain equity in those companies that we consider having potential to grow, and sell them later.\"' In our interviews with VC executives, uncertainty emerges as an important consideration for VCs to retain equity and delay exit. A VC Partner notes, \\*We tend to retain partial holdings when the sector is going through a lot of uncertainties on the stock market.\" We thus hypothesize that:  \n\nHypothesis H1. (baseline) The higher the industry-level uncertainty for an investee venture, the higher a VC's propensity to remain a significant owner of that venture after its public listing.  \n\nWe further submit that the VC's private information reinforces the effect of uncertainty on the incentive to retain equity. As the VC's private information becomes more positive (or less negative) about the investee venture, we expect that the marginal effect of a rise in uncertainty also turns stronger. When the VC possesses positive private information, the VC's initial valuation $V_{0}$ will be higher than the market price $M_{0}.$ prompting the VC to expect that additional information revealed by the venture's performance in the future will cause the market price to converge to the VC's valuation. This, in turn, will increase the VC's incentive to retain equity for the opportunity to sellit at a higher price later. Because higher uncertainty means larger random changes in $M_{t}$ and $V_{t}$ over a given time increment, a rise in uncertainty enlarges both $\\Delta{}V_{t}$ and $\\Delta{M}_{t}$ and thus makes it likely for $M_{t}$ to catch up with and exceed $V_{t}$ sooner.4 In the meantime, when the VC's private information is more positive, there is a higher chance for information newly revealed to the public to be positive and further increase the likelihood for $M_{t}$ to catch up with and exceed $V_{t},$ enabling the VC to sell the equity at a higher price sooner. Therefore, we expect that the positive effect of uncertainty on the net payoff of retaining equity will increase with the VC's positive private information.  \n\nThe VC's private information, by definition, is not readily observable to outsiders. Our empirical strategy is to find observable factors indicating that the VC is likely to possess or have access to private information that is inaccessible to general market participants. First, the venture's portfolio of patent applications that are yet to be granted at the time of the exit decision (but ultimately granted) represents a positive signal ex ante that is likely difficult to assess by general market participants, especially before certification by the patent-granting agency (Levitas & Chi, 2010; Schwartz, 2004). Second, at the industry level, a positive market surprise in the returns of firms in the industry is likely to indicate a heightened degree to which public information on the growth prospects of the firms in the industry lags behind the positive private information held by insiders (e.g., the VC).  \n\n## 3.1 I  Patent-related private information and VC exit under uncertainty  \n\nWe focus on a venture's portfolio of patents that were still at the application stage in the year of the exit decision but received approval subsequently. VCs recognize the value of new ventures' patents, and patent applications in particular (Lemley, 2001; Mohammadi & Khashabi, 2021). While granted patents are largely public information, pregranted patent applications constitute a reasonable indicator of the insiders' positive private information about the value-creating potential of the venture assets. Whether patents serve as an isolating or appropriation mechanism in the product market (Rumelt, 1984; Teece, 1986) or offer future investment opportunities in the product and factor markets (Levitas & Chi, 2010; Oriani & Sereno, 2011), there is inevitably market friction in the valuation of such proprietary assets (Mahoney & Qian, 2013). Even though the market is forward-looking and anticipating the future value of the venture's patent applications (Hall et al., 2005), knowledge is asymmetrically distributed (e.g., Hayek, 1945), especially before the grant of a patent by the legal authority that serves to verify and accentuate the value-creating potential of the venture's proprietary knowledge. Even though a larger portfolio of patent applications sends a positive signal about the future performance of a newly public venture, such a signal may not be sufficiently visible or credible in the eyes of general market participants before the patents are granted and made fully public. A vC with equity stakes in the venture, meanwhile, should have better assessment on the value of the pre-grant patents because of access to inside information and accumulated knowledge about the venture's capabilities.  \n\nHence, possession of private information on patent applications likely enables the VC and the entrepreneur to recognize the value of the patent applications more fully as compared with the market. Even though a large portfolio of patent applications can be expected to boost the market's valuation of the venture as well, we expect that it will have a smaller impact on the valuation of the market because the market is likely to find the intrinsic value and the signaling value of the patents more difficult to verify. The value of a patent application will eventually be recognized by the market as the patent is granted and as the venture turns the proprietary knowledge into commercial success in the future. But until then, the divergence of valuations between the VC and the market remains, and it will likely widen as the portfolio of the venture's patent applications increases. The number of the venture's patent applications can thus serve as an indicator of the extent to which the VC possesses positive private information. Hence, we hypothesize:  \n\nHypothesis H2. The positive effect of uncertainty on a VC's propensity to remain a significant owner of an investee venture post-IPO is greater when the venture has a larger number of patent applications atthetimewhenexitbecomesfeasible.  \n\n## 3.2 I  Market surprise and VC exit under uncertainty  \n\nThe market anticipates the future earning potential of the venture and other firms in the industry, and incorporates such expectation in the current stock prices, according to the efficient market hypothesis (Fama, 1970). But the market can only do so imperfectly. There will always be discrepancies between the actual returns and the forecast returns despite the progress in predicting the returns of industries (e.g., Fama & French, 1993). These discrepancies are market surprises. The market may not account for the surprises fully in the current stock prices for some period of time because of the difficulty for general market participants to obtain accurate information on the value-creating potential of at least some major firms in the industry. In other words, the extent of surprises reflects the extent of private information that affects at least a significant portion of the firms in the industry.  \n\nMarket surprise can be positive or negative. The more positive the market surprise (i.e., the larger the actual returns turn out to be than the prior forecast returns), the more the market has been underestimating the upside potential of the firms in the industry. On the other hand, the more negative the market surprise, the more the market has been overestimating the earning potential of the firms in the industry. While a market surprise in general suggests that the VC willikely have private information, the positivity (negativity) of the market surprise makes it more likely that the VC has a higher (lower) valuation of the venture's assets than the market, at least for some period of time until the market absorbs the new information.5 Positive market surprise can thus serve as an indicator of the extent to which the VC possesses positive private information. We hypothesize:  \n\nHypothesis H3. The positive effect of uncertainty on a VC's propensity to remain a significant owner of an investee venture post-IPO is greater when the stock prices of firms in the venture's industry exhibit amorepositivesurprise.  \n\n# 4| METHODS  \n\n## 4.1  | Empirical setting  \n\nWe test our theory with data on VC exit after venture IPO in China. The VC industry in China started in the 1980s but it did not take off until late 1990s and early 2000s (Batjargal & Liu, 2004).It has become one of the largest VC markets since 2001 (Guo & Jiang, 2013). VCs may sell their ownership stake in newly public ventures in one of two ways: by selling their shares on the open market and paying proceeds to investors (i.e., limited partners) in cash, as in Australia (Hsu et al, 2020), or by distributing shares to investors, as is frequently the case in the Us (Gompers $\\&$ Lerner, 1998). In China, VCs generally sell shares and pay investors in cash, as confirmed by the expert scholar we interviewed. In addition, VCs face a legally compulsory lockup period in China. Once the lockup period expires, the VC has the discretion as to whether and when to cash out or retain equity before the end of the fund life. Our interviews with three VC executives in September 2017 indicate that the exit decision is usually made around the lockup expiration date (a few months before or shortly after). Further, according to our interviews of five experts in 2022- 2023, it generally takes 6 months to 1 year for investors to cash out after lockup expiration, a time window that is also reported in prior research (e.g., Cumming & Maclntosh, 2003). The VC can negotiate for an extension of one to 2 years within the fund lifespan. This arrangement between the VC and the limited partners can be described as, for example, $^{\\leftarrow}5+2+1$ ” indicating 5 years of investment, 2 years for exit (including the one-year lockup period), and 1 year of extension for exit. We examine both the likelihood of retaining equity within 1 year after lockup expiration and the rate of exit or cashout within 2 years after lockup expiration.  \n\nOur empirical design with a focus on the China context carries several unique advantages. First, as an emerging market in our sample study period, China has experienced high uncertainty in both its industrial sectors and security markets recently (Luo, 2003); real options tend to be valuable in such settings. In addition, information asymmetry remains severe in emerging markets (Sanders & Boivie, 2004). For these reasons, China offers a proper setting to test our theoretical predictions. Second, as compared with voluntary lockup in countries like the Us (Field $\\&$ Hanka, 2001), the mandatory lockup in China allows us to control effectively for any potential confounding effect of strategic lockup behavior (Arthurs et al., 2009; Brau et al., 2005; Brav & Gompers, 2003) on the post-IPO exit decision. Third, focusing on a single country helps control for the effect of the legal environment, which is shown to have significant impact on VC governance and exit (e.g., Cumming et al., 2006; Cumming & Walz, 2010). Finally, our focus on China allows us to examine the impact of the unique institutional setting on VC exit post-IPO, including the role of government, corporate and foreign VCs, as well as political connections, which we discuss below.  \n\n## 4.2 | Data and sample  \n\nWe collected data on the VC-backed ventures that went public in the Chinese stock market. Data come primarily from the PEData database (Gu & Lu, 2014), and are augmented with data from WIND (e.g., data on financial information and IPOs that were not included in PEData) and IPO prospectuses (e.g., data on shareholding and VCs that were not included inPEData).?  \n\nOur analysis focuses on VC-backed ventures that went public during 2009-2012. Important for our purpose, the largest number of VC-backed ventures in China went public on the GEM board, which did not come into existence until October 2009.8 China has periods of IPO freeze, and 2009-2012 is the latest period when private companies were allowed to go public before we started to collect data in 2016. This latest round of IPO offers a sufficient time window to observe the post-IPO exit events. Given the lockup period of 1-3 years and at least another year or two for exit, we need 4 to 5 years to observe post-IPO exits after lockup. We updated information onVCexit in2019 and2022.  \n\nWe hand collected information on VC exit from company IPO prospectuses as well as quarterly and annual reports. A VC fund's shareholding in a venture is reported as far as the VC remains on the top 10 shareholder list for that venture. We obtained each VC fund's ownership at the time of a venture's IPO from the IPO Prospectus. We then tracked the change in each VC fund's equity holding position in that venture on a quarterly basis during 2009- 2017, from the time of venture IPO until 2 years after the lockup expiration date, assuming 1 year for exit and 1 year of extension. Our initial sample includes 437 IPO ventures. After excluding observations with incomplete information, the final sample includes 407 ventures financed by 506 unique VC funds, involving 777 VC fund-venture dyads.  \n\n## 4.3 | Variables and measures  \n\n### 4.3.1 | Dependent variable  \n\nWe generated a dummy variable that takes the value one if a VC fund retains at least some of its equity holdings and continues to appear on the top 10 shareholder list 1 year after the IPO lockup expiration date (e.g., Cumming & Maclntosh, 2003). If the VC fund disappears from the top 10 shareholder list for two consecutive quarters within 1 year after the lockup expiration date, we view it as a case of cashout (i.e., full exit), and the dependent variable takesthevaluezero.\"  \n\n### 4.3.2 1 Uncertainty  \n\nIn line with the focus of our analysis, we emphasize the role of industry-level uncertainty that is largely exogenous10 (Belderbos et al., 2019; Dixit & Pindyck, 1994; Folta & O'Brien, 2004; Li & Chi, 2013). Such uncertainty can be attributed to technology development, market demand, regulatory policies or other factors (Belderbos et al., 2014; McGrath, 1997). We measure this variable using stock market data, which have a distinct advantage in arguably capturing all the relevant sources of uncertainty (Carruth et al., 20oo). This market-based measure is particularly appealing in our context as post-IPO exit involves equity buying and selling on the stock market.  \n\nWe took the following steps to create the uncertainty measure. We first collected stock market data starting from 1991 when China's stock market was established. Data come from the WIND database, a widely used financial database in China (Lin et al., 2009). We then computed the monthly return for each industry by aggregating the monthly returns of stocks in that industry weighted by their market value. We used China's widely-adopted Shenyin Wanguo Securities top level industry codes to categorize all the public firms into 28 industries (https://www. sWsresearch.com). Table 1 shows that our sample includes ventures from 26 industries. Next, we specified a threefactormodel(Fama $\\&$ French, 1993) to forecast industry monthly returns recursively from 1991 until 2016:  \n\n$$\nE R=\\upalpha+\\upbeta*M K T R F_{t}+\\up s*S M B_{t}+\\mathsf{h}*H M L_{t}+\\varepsilon_{t}\n$$  \n\nwhere ER is the industry monthly return in excess of the market risk-free return rate. $M K T R F_{t}$ istheexcessmarket return over the risk-free return rate where the market return is the value-weighted return on all Chinese domestic stocks. $S M B_{t}$ is the difference between small firm return and big firm return. $H M L_{t}$ is the differencebetweenhigh book-to-market equity return and low book-to-market equity return. The adjusted R-square for the regressions ranges from 0.602 to 0.854, with an average of 0.742, suggesting that the Fama-French model captures a significant fraction of the variation in China's stock returns in our sample period.  \n\nFrom the Fama-French model of monthly returns, we obtained the root mean squared errors (i.e., the squared root of the sum of squared standard errors normalized bytheregression degree offreedom)(Folta& O'Brien,2004)  \n\nTABLE 1 Distribution of post IPO exits: By industry and type.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"4\">Number of observations</td></tr><tr><td>Industry code</td><td>Industry</td><td>No exit</td><td>Partial exit</td><td>Full exit</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Mining</td><td>0</td><td></td><td>7</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Chemical</td><td>6</td><td>28</td><td>36</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Steel</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Non-ferrous metal</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>16</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Construction Materials</td><td>0</td><td>6</td><td>15</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Architecture Construction</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Electrical Equipment</td><td>7</td><td>17</td><td>49</td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Mechanical Equipment</td><td>12</td><td>27</td><td>73</td><td>112</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Defense</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>Automobile</td><td>3</td><td>8</td><td>12</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Domestic Appliance</td><td>5</td><td>8</td><td>14</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>Textile and Garment</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>8</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>Light Manufacturing</td><td>2</td><td>7</td><td>14</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>Commercial Trade</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>8</td><td>６</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>Agriculture, Forestry, Livestock, Fishery</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>20</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>Food &Beverage</td><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>9</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>Recreation Service</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>Biomedical</td><td>2</td><td>24</td><td>25</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>Utility</td><td>2</td><td>7</td><td>20</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>Transportation</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>Real Estate</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td>Electronics</td><td>7</td><td>25</td><td>53</td><td>85</td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td>IT/Computer</td><td>4</td><td>17</td><td>56</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td>Media</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>15</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Tele-communication</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>25</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>36</td><td>Non-bank Financials</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td>65</td><td>217</td><td>495</td><td>777</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nfor the year leading up to the lockup expiration date. The regression errors indicate the level of volatility and unpredictability in the market environment. We then created an average of the errors. For example, if a venture went public in 2010 with a lockup period of 1 year and the VC cashed out in 2012, we used the average of the monthly root mean squared errors for 2011 to measure uncertainty for the exit decision in 2012. This measure is lagged in empirical analysis to assuage reverse causality concerns. It is venture industry-specific and time-varying.  \n\n### 4.3.3 |  Patent application-related private information  \n\nWe collected patent information for ventures from the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) of China (http:// www.sipo.gov.cn/), the Chinese counterpart of UsPTO. We extracted patents for each venture and then manually checked to ensure the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the data based on venture name and location. This procedure identified a total of 42,392 granted patents between 1993 and 2016 for $90\\%$ oftheventures(368outof 407) in our sample. The Patent applications measure is the number of patents filed for by a venture but not yet granted in the year of lockup expiration. Although these patents were ultimately granted, they remained largely private information for insiders such as entrepreneurs and VCs at the time of application. We used the application or filing year in calculating the measure (Hall et al., 2001). We used the patent applications at the time of lockup expiration rather than at the time of venture IPO to address the possibility that the IPO might be timed to patent filing and that more information could be learned or disclosed during the lockup period. This measure is venturespecific and time-varying.  \n\n### 4.3.41 Market surprise  \n\nIn line with prior work (e.g., Kogut, 1991), we first established a long-term base-rate for each industry's historical returns and then looked at year-to-year departures from this trend. We forecast the returns for each industry each month for time t using data up to time t-1. We then calculated the difference between the actual returns at time t and the predicted returnsfor time t.Predicted returns are derived from estimation of the Fama-French model similar to Equation (1) above but with returns as the dependent variable (e.g., Kogut, 1991). The average difference for the 12 months leading up to the exit event is then used as a proxy for market surprise. We focused on the exit year since information further away from the exit decision will not likely contain much “surprise.\" We obtained the average for 12 months to smooth out any undue influence of unique situations in recent months. The higher the value of this measure, the more positive the market surprise. This measure is industry-specific and time-varying.  \n\n### 4.3.5 | Controls  \n\nWe account for several prominent alternative explanations for the VC's decision to retain equity after venture public listing. For the information and signaling arguments, we include the following variables commonly used to measure information asymmetry in the VC context (Cumming & Maclntosh, 2003; Gompers, 1995). First, younger ventures and earlier-stage ventures tend to have less observable track record and there willikely be higher information asymmetry between such ventures and the market. VCs' decision to retain equity after venture IPO may add certification and endorsement value at the time of IPO or afterward. It is also worth noting from a property rights perspective that VCs may have an incentive to seek greater control in younger and earlier-stage ventures when their long-term performance remains unclear (Aghion & Tirole, 1994). Age at lockup expiration is the log of duration from the venture's founding date to the lockup expiration date. The unit of measurement for duration is years (e.g., an age of 18 months is 1.5 years, same for all duration variables below, unless specified otherwise). Earlier stage at IPO takes the value one if the venture is at the seed or early stage of development based on the PEData data, and zero otherwise. Second, the venture may underprice its initial offerings to signal its quality (Allen $\\&$ Faulhaber，1989; Welch, 1989). The argument is that only high-quality firms can bear the costs of selling stocks below the market expected value. Underpricing is the percentage increase in the closing price over the opening price of the venture's stock on the first trading day. Finally, patenting is often considered a signal of the quality of a firm's technological assets (Hsu & Ziedonis, 2013; Svensson, 2007). From an information signaling perspective, if the venture's patents serve as an effective signaling mechanism, they may reduce the benefit of using retained equity in the venture postIPO to signal the quality of the venture's assets, or patents may increase the signaling value of retained equity as they are from different signaling sources (Courtney et al., 2017).  \n\nFounder human capital is important in VC investments (Fuller & Rothaermel, 2012; Haeussler et al., 2019; Matusik et al., 2008; Pollock et al., 2009). Higher founder ownership in a venture gives the founder more discretion to pursue value-creating activities and indicates the founder's greater confidence in the venture's future. Such discretion and confidence are difficult for general market participants to observe and evaluate, but the VC as an insider does not face as much difficulty in observing, assessing and monitoring the venture. It is hence reasonable to expect that founder ownership will increase a VC's propensity to retain equity. We measure founder ownership using the percentage of equity shares controlled by the founder(s) and their families at the time of IPO (Paeglis & Veeren, 2013). Data on founders and their shareholding come from WIND and IFIND.  \n\nAt the VC-venture dyad level, we include investment duration, staging and syndication that are relevant to information asymmetry concerns at the time of IPO (e.g., Cumming et al., 2006; Lerner, 1994). Longer investment duration implies more involvement of the VC in coaching and monitoring, which can reduce the information gap between the VC and the entrepreneur and may lower the need for retaining equity. Staging provides additional monitoring as each round of funding is usually contingent on the venture reaching a specified milestone, and may thus reduce the need for retaining equity. Syndication of multiple VC funds facilitates deal screening and due diligence pre-IPO and may lower the need for retaining equity post-IPo.  \n\nThe VC may use retained equity in the IPO venture to balance risk and return in its portfolio of investment projects. Because the majority of portfolio companies are usually yet to be sufficiently developed for IPO, the risks involved in these assets are largely undiversified. A larger portfolio of ventures also means greater need for capital infusion. It is thus less desirable for a VC to retain significant equity stakes in a venture post-IPO when the VC maintains a larger portfolio. VC portfolio is the log of number of unique portfolio companies the VC has funded in the last 3 years up to the lockup expiration year. Data come from PEData.  \n\nThe VC may not have a choice but to cash out if it is cash constrained. In our interviews with VC executives, cash constraint has often emerged as an important consideration for post-IPO exit strategy. Absent exact information on cash inflow and outflow, we expect that cash constraint will be lower if the VC has a greater amount of capital under management. The VC needs to have sufficient capital to finance other promising ventures if it decides not to cash out of the newly public venture. Based on data from PEData, VC capital under management is the log of millions of RMB (Chinese currency) for each VC fund prior to the lockup expiration date, and if missing, is replaced by (1) the value available closest to the lockup expiration date, and (2) imputed value based on a linear regression on industry dummies given that the funding need and VC capital are usually industry-specific.  \n\nMore experienced and skilled VCs may face less cash constraint and have less pressure to raise a follow-up fund (Buzzacchi et al., 2015; Cumming et al., 2009), both of which may increase the propensity to retain equity. In addition to VC portfolio size we discussed above, two more variables are created, VC number of IPO exits and VC number of funds, which can be viewed as proxies for VC experience and skill(and even reputation in case of number of venture IPO exits) (Cumming & Dai, 2011; Nahata, 2008). Because VC number of funds is highly correlated with both VC portfolio $(r=0.82^{\\circ}.$ and VC capital under management $(r=0.62^{\\circ}.$ , we did not include the variable in our final analysis, but we performed a robustness test by including or excluding the variable, and it does not alter the results.  \n\nThe VC will face more pressure to sell out if the fund reaches the end of its life span (Kandel et al., 2011), which is typically around 10 years (Fenn et al., 1997)-even though in some cases, a fund can be extended (especially upon a successful exit) or a follow-on fund may be established, according to prior research (lliev & Lowry, 2020) and our interviews. From PEData, VC fund age is the log of the duration from the VC fund's founding to the lockup expiration. In addition, the VC may need more time to sell shares if it holds significant equity ownership in the IPO venture, because dumping large shares of equity after venture IPO may drive the share price down. We control for VC blockholding by creating a dummy variable that is equal to one if the VC holds $5\\%$ or more of theventure at the time of IPO.  \n\nChina has its unique formal and informal institutions, as reflected in the prominent role of the state and political connections. These unique institutional attributes affect the VC investment process from deal selection, to monitoring and advising, to exit and IPO (Ahlstrom et al., 2007; Batjargal $\\&$ Liu,2004;Bruton $\\&$ Ahlstrom,2003).The institutional impact on VC exit post-IPO remains largely unexplored. First, we control for whether a VC fund is owned or controlled by the government (GVC) (Devarakonda & Liu, 2023; Murtinu, 2021; Suchard et al., 2021), and whether a VC fund is a subsidiary of an industrial enterprise (CVC) (Dushnitsky & Yu, 2022; Huang & Madhavan, 2021). Second, social ties, especially political connections, can bring information, resource, and legitimacy benefits (Hillman, 2005; Li & Zhang, 2007; Peng & Luo, 2000; Wang, 2016; Zhao & Lu, 2016). Current research indicates that political connections of ventures and VCs can enhance the likelihood of obtaining approval for IPO (Bao et al, 2016; Wang & Wu, 2020) and increase the amount of capital raised at IPO in China (Wu et al., 2013). We manually collect the biographic information on each senior executive (partners, directors, senior managers) serving in a VC from its website, professional databases (Tianyancha and Qichacha), and Baidu (equivalent of Google in China). We then create a dummy variable that is equal to one if any senior executive of the VC once served in a government agency or public office, as a member of National or Local People's Congress, as a member of People's Political Consultative Conference, or as a senior administrator in a government-supported research institution (e.g., Ba0 et al., 2016; Wang & Wu, 2020).  \n\nIn the China context, firm behavior may be shaped by the status as a state-owned versus a private enterprise. The dummy variable, state-owned, takes the value one if the focal venture is categorized as state-owned by the Wind database, and zero otherwise. Companies can voluntarily list their shares in one of two locations in China: Shenzhen and Shanghai, with GEM as part of the Shenzhen stock exchange. We include a dummy variable, Listed in Shenzhen, to account for unobservable location-specific fixed effects.  \n\nWe include several other control variables in our estimation. At the VC level, we control for whether a foreign VC is involved.Foreign VCs tend to have the expertise and capital to fund new ventures in China (Ahlstrom et al.,2007; Bruton& Ahlstrom,2003).At the venture level, we control for the size of the venture,measured as the log of the market value at lockup expiration. Market value is calculated as the closing price in the lockup expiration year, multiplied by the total number of shares based on data from the WIND database (in millions of RMB). At the dyad level, lockup duration is the log of the time passed from the IPO date to the lockup expiration date. Finally, for all the estimations, we include industry dummies (based on the Shenyin Wanguo Securities industry classification) and year dummies to account for industry fixed effects and unobservable time-varying effects. In particular, a proper test of the uncertainty effect in the real options logic requires that we tease out the industry fixed effects to focus on theunpredictablepart of the industry effects.  \n\n### 4.4 | Statistical model  \n\nWe specify a logit model to test the likelihood of retaining equity versus cashing out within 1 year after lockup expiration(Cumming $\\&$ Maclntosh, 2003). Suppose a VC makes the exit decision depending on the expected net payoff:  \n\n$$\n\\pmb{V}^{*}=\\pmb{X}\\beta+\\varepsilon,\n$$  \n\nwhere $V^{\\ast}$ is the vector of net payoff values that is unobservable to an empirical researcher and remains a latent variable. $\\pmb{X}$ is thematrixof explanatoryvariables, $\\beta$ is thevector of regressioncoefficients,and $\\varepsilon\\backsim{\\mathcal{N}}(0,\\sigma^{2})$ is the vector of regression errors. What we can observe is a binary variable depending on whether the VC retains equity $(=1)$ or cashes out $\\scriptstyle(=0)$  \n\n$$\nV_{i}=\\left\\{{1\\atop{0\\nmid{\\uparrow V_{i}^{*}=0}}}\\right.\n$$  \n\nwhere $V_{j}$ denotes the observed values, with $\\dot{I}=1,2,\\cdots,N$ and $V_{j}^{*}$ is the threhold value that can be understood as when the market's valuation exceeds the VC's valuation by the value of the exchange option. So, the observed data can be used to estimate a limited dependent variable model such as logit. Let us assume the log odds is a linear function of our explanatory variables, $\\begin{array}{r}{{10g}\\Big(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\Big)=\\pmb{X}\\beta}\\end{array}$ .We can then estimate a logit model as follows:  \n\n$$\nP(y=1|x)=\\frac{\\exp(X\\beta)}{1-\\exp(X\\beta)}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\pmb{P}(\\pmb{y}=1|\\pmb{x})$ is the likelihood of the VC retaining equity relative to cashing out conditional on the set of explanatoryvariables $\\pmb{x}.$ The model is estimated with the maximum likelihood approach. Since a VC fund may invest in multiple ventures in our sample, we apply the robust procedure and cluster the observations by VC funds to obtain the variance-covariance matrix for coefficient estimates. The results remain when we alternatively cluster the observationsbytheexityear.  \n\nThe interaction effects of uncertainty and private information variables on the predicted probability in Equation (4) for each observation can be computed as follows (Norton et al., 2004):  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2}P}{\\partial x_{1}\\partial x_{2}}=\\beta_{12}P(1-P)+(\\beta_{1}+\\beta_{12}x_{2})(\\beta_{2}+\\beta_{12}x_{1})P(1-P)(1-2P).\n$$  \n\nWe further specify a Cox hazard model to estimate the rate of exit or cashout within 2 years after lockup expiration. Since VCs usually have closed funds with a fixed lifespan (e.g., 7-10 years),they will ultimately divest all their holdings in investee ventures. It is thus important to understand the time to exit. For this purpose, we estimate the rate of exit, as proxied by the rate of VCs disappearing from the top 10 shareholder list. The exact date of any share sale that results in a cashout is unknown, and the remaining equity stake held by a VC that disappears from the top 10 list, if any, also remains unknown. To overcome these data limitations, we track the quarterly reports for 2 years after lockup expiration and calculate the number of quarters that have passed from the lockup expiration date to the last quarter when a VC appears as a top 10 shareholder of an IPO venture. By the end of 2 years, VCs have indeed disappeared from the top 10 list for about $97\\%$ of the 777 dyads. Analysis of the Schoenfeld residuals suggests that the model meets the proportional-hazards assumption $(\\chi^{2}=44.77,p=0.81)$  \n\n# 5 丨 EMPIRICAL RESULTS  \n\nTable 1 lists the distribution of exits within 1 year after lockup expiration, by type and across industries. There are 282 cases of retaining equity (217 cases of partial exit, 65 cases of no exit) and 495 cases of cashout or full exit. Retaining equity accounts for $36.3\\%$ of theobservations.11  \n\nTable 2 presents the descriptive statistics and correlations. The correlations are generally small in magnitude except for that between VC capital under management and VC portfolio. When the two are included separately in the estimations, the results are almost identical. The variance inflation factors are all below 3, indicating that multicollinearity is not likely a concern (Kleinbaum et al., 1988). In the estimations, we centered the explanatory variables before generating interaction terms and running regressions (Echambadi & Hess, 2007).  \n\nTable 3 reports the results for logit and Cox estimations. We discuss the logit estimates first. H1 suggests that the likelihood of a VC fund remaining a significant owner of a venture after its public listing will increase with the level of uncertainty in the venture's industry. Uncertainty in Model 2 has a positive and statistically significant coefficient estimate $:p=0.0005\\$ . We examine the average marginal effect across the observations in discussing the magnitude of the effects (Hoetker, 2007). From Model 2, the average marginal effect of uncertainty on the probability of retaining equity is 0.696; when uncertainty increases from 25th to 75th percentile, the predicted probability of a VC remaining a significant owner in the investee venture post-IPO increases by $50.3\\%$ H1 is supported.Since uncertainty is a unique driver for the value of options (Dixit & Pindyck, 1994; Trigeorgis, 1996), this finding offers preliminary evidence for our argument that the VC exit decision can be conceptualized in terms of holding or exercising an exchangeoption.  \n\nWe now turn to the interaction effects between uncertainty and proxies of private information. H2 hypothesizes that the positive effect of market uncertainty in the venture's industry increases with the number of patent applications. In Model 3 of Table 3, the interaction term of uncertainty and patent applications has a positive and significantcoefficient( $p=0.0858)$ , consistent with H2. For a nonlinear model, the marginal effect of a change in both interacted variables is not equal to the marginal effect of changing just the interaction term, since the predicted probability also varies with the values of the covariates. We thus use the “margins\" command in STATA to compute the marginal effect of uncertainty contingent on patent applications. For illustration, when the number of patent applications increases from one (50th percentile) to 25 (95th percentile), an increase in uncertainty from 25th to 75th percentile results in an increase in the probability of retaining equity by $11.03\\%$  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>3</td><td>100 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</td></tr><tr><td>(10)</td><td>-0.10 -0.17 0.03 -0.04 -0.08 -0.03 0.01 -0.04 0.10 0.12

posits that the positive effect of uncertainty is stronger when market surprise in the venture's industry is more positive. In Model 4 of Table 3, the interaction term of uncertainty and market surprise has a positive and significant coefficient( $p=0.0365)$ . When market surprise increases from one standard deviation below the mean $\\left(=-1.64\\right.$ , i.e., the average forecast return is higher than the actual return by 1.64) to one standard deviation above themean $(=1.31\\$ , i.e., the average forecast return is lower than the actual return by 1.31), an increase in uncertainty from 10th to 75th percentile results in an increase by $41.7\\%$ . Model 5 includes all the interaction terms and the results are consistent with those in Models 2-5.  \n\nThe Cox estimations offer further support for the hypotheses on the role of uncertainty and private information in $\\mathsf{V C s}$ propensity to exit. Consistent with H1, uncertainty in Model 7 has a negative and statistically significant coefficient estimate( $p=0.018\\$ . When uncertainty increases from the 25th to 75th percentile, holding all other variables constant, the rate of VC exit decreases in the magnitude of $95.4\\%$ . In Model 8, the interaction term of uncertainty and patent applications is negative and significant ( $p=0.069;$ , as expected in H2. When the number of patent applications increases from 2 (5oth percentile) to 25 (95th percentile) in the survival sample, an increase in uncertainty from 25th to 75th percentile results in a $12.6\\%$ decrease in the rate of VC exit. In Model 9, the interaction term of uncertainty and market surprise has a negative and significant coefficient $\\left(p=0.011\\right)$ , in support of H3. When the market surprise measure increases from one standard deviation below the mean $\\left(=-1.64\\right)$ to one standard deviation above the mean ${(=1.23}$ in the survival sample), an increase in uncertainty from 25th to 75th percentile results in a $69.7\\%$ decrease in the rate of exit. Model 10 includes all the interaction terms and the results are consistent with those in Models 6-9.  \n\nLet us turn to the variables related to the information and signaling arguments. As shown in Models 1 and 6 of Table 3, some of the variables such as venture earlier stage, age, investment duration, staging and syndication have statistically insignificant effects. VCs are less likely to retain equity of underpriced IPO ventures, but more likely to retain equity in ventures with higher founder ownership. These two variables have no significant effects on the rate of exit. Finally, number of patent applications increases the likelihood of retaining equity but has no significant effect on rate of exit. Overall, these findings present a mixed picture for the information and signaling arguments, a finding that is echoed by prior research (Cumming & Maclntosh, 2003).  \n\nlikelihood of retaining equity (rate of cashing out). This finding might be attributed to the fact that given the relatively young VC sector in China in our sample period, older funds are more experienced in realizing the full potential of IPO ventures. As expected, VC blockholding increases the likelihood of retaining equity and decreases the rate of exit.  \n\nAs for the unique Chinese setting, government VCs tend to retain equity and the rate of exit is also lower for them, probably reflecting the fact that GVCs face less financial constraint. CVCs do not display a significantly different exit pattern, relative to other types of VC. Part of the reason could be that many CVCs in China share a similar objective as independent VCs to pursue consumption-based growth from market opportunities rather than pursue innovation-based growth from high-technology ventures (Dushnitsky & Yu, 2022). The extent of VCs' political connections has a statistically insignificant effect. Finally, there is no statistically significant effect for state-owned ventures, ventures listed in Shenzhen, and foreign VC-backed ventures. Future research may compare the role of unique institutional settings in VC exit decisions across countries.  \n\n## 5.1 | Robustness tests  \n\nWe perform a series of robustness tests and report the results in Table 4.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>0.00844+ (0.00442) (0.00683) -0.0146 -0.496** -0.0348 (0.0473) -0.226** 4.558** 0.0789* (0.0375) 0.0150* -0.406 -0.204 (0.0796) (1.393) (0.108) 0.0512 (0.314) (0.309) (0.172) 0.930* (0.474) 0.482 (0.309) (0.308) 9 4.912*** 0.00921* (0.00440) (0.00691) -0.0134 -0.508** 0.0334 -0.232** 0.0745* (0.0366) 0.0161* -0.346 0.882+ 0.126 (0.0468) (0.0804) (1.450) (0.108) 0.0524 (0.320) (0.315) (0.171) (0.466) 0.466 (0.304) (0.301) 8 0.00758+ (0.00436) (0.00678) 0.0199 -0.505** 0.0346 -0.228** 4.445** 0.0784* (0.0377) 0.0147* 0.379 0.138 (0.0473) (0.0809) (1.429) (0.108) 0.0146 (0.306) (0.304) (0.173) 0.932* (0.473) (0.312) (0.336) 0.462 7 0.00789+ (0.00457) (0.00706) 4.031** (0.0407) 0.0171* -0.467* -0.0489 (0.0545) -0.0866 0.0586 0.0948 -0.411 0.975+ -0.128 (0.0939) (1.266) (0.113) (0.358) (0.338) (0.192) (0.502) 0.391 (0.336) (0.308) 0.225 6 (0.00918) -0.683*** -0.658*** 10.08*** (0.00695) 0.00897 0.232*** (0.0643) 0.00850 -0.504* -0.0248 -0.517 -0.616 1.163** -0.705 (0.0642) (2.340) (0.207) (0.406) (0.496) (0.242) 0.916 (0.764) (0.444) (0.656) (0.136) 5 -0.00859 (0.00719) -0.777*** -0.740+ -0.570*** 0.00107 (0.00633) (0.0702) -0.0335 -0.0595 -0.204 0.772+ -0.575 (0.0735) 6.051* (2.452) 0.174* (0.216) (0.437) (0.516) (0.250) (0.766) (0.463) (0.644) 0.0241 (0.154) 4 0.00845+ (0.00442) (0.00683) -0.0150 -0.497** -0.0350 -0.226** 4.565** 0.0790* (0.0376) 0.0150* -0.407 -0.204 (0.0473) (0.0791) (1.402) (0.108) 0.0523 (0.313) (0.309) (0.172) 0.932* (0.475) 0.478 (0.311) (0.308) 3 -0.493*** (0.00467) (0.00797) (0.0451) 0.00664 -0.432+ 0.0105* -0.0274 4.841** (0.0561) (1.846) 0.0700 0.0746 (0.158) (0.396) -0.376 0.217 (0.403) (0.222) 0.653 (0.572) 0.0354 (0.419) 0.0478 (0.358) (0.147) 2 (0.00434) (0.00859) -0.411+ -0.0483 -0.0241 -0.463** 5.301** 0.0109* (0.0454) 0.00862 -0.295 (0.0529) (1.847) 0.0737 0.0221 (0.147) (0.378) (0.388) (0.212) 0.891+ (0.536) 0.0727 0.174 (0.392) (0.337) (0.173) 1</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n(panuo)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>0.270*** (0.0762) -0.126 0.551** 1.635*** (0.152) (0.204) (0.238) 0.527* (0.245) -0.206 (0.609) (0.228) (0.451) -0.408 (0.379) 0.223 (0.354) 0.175 (0.177) 0.0774 (0.354) 0.237 0.421 9 0.267*** (0.0766) -0.137 0.535** 1.630*** (0.154) (0.200) (0.235) 0.557* (0.248) 0.191 (0.614) (0.227) (0.475) 0.429 (0.385) (0.356) (0.181) 0.0555 0.221 0.259 0.157 (0.349) 0.512 8 0.275*** (0.0771) 0.569** 1.587*** 0.122 (0.155) (0.209) (0.236) 0.494* (0.247) -0.244 (0.610) (0.225) (0.446) -0.403 0.248 0.396 (0.378) 0.211 (0.352) 0.186 (0.179) 0.0771 (0.356) 7 0.246** (0.0919) 1.776*** -0.0347 -0.197 (0.166) 0.701** (0.223) (0.264) 0.458+ (0.256) (0.624) (0.236) (0.484) 0.352 (0.411) 0.0655 (0.379) (0.185) (0.382) 0.135 0.579 0.203 0.321 6 -0.00984 0.304** -0.0682 (0.115) (0.281) (0.314) 1.002** (0.385) (0.476) -1.003 (0.863) (0.379) (0.890) -0.644 (0.609) (0.561) 0.0154 (0.262) -0.592 0.325 0.714 0.402 0.915 (0.639) 5 -0.774+ -0.769* 0.0565 (0.139) (0.336) (0.353) (0.422) (0.508) 0.967 (0.699) (0.370) -0.590 (0.976) -0.292 (0.645) (0.574) -0.187 (0.269) 0.915 0.255 0.268 0.851 (0.669) 0.521 4 0.270*** (0.0770) 0.552** 1.636*** 0.127 (0.154) (0.203) (0.237) 0.526* (0.245) -0.208 (0.611) (0.227) 0.421 (0.451) -0.407 0.237 (0.379) 0.221 (0.361) 0.176 (0.176) 0.0788 (0.358) 3 0.484** 0.992*** 1.573*** (0.150) -0.133 (0.194) (0.277) (0.348) (0.307) 0.104 (0.809) (0.283) (0.585) 0.521 (0.464) 0.181 (0.399) 0.0965 (0.224) -0.238 0.413 0.441 0.343 (0.490)</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n(panuo)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>-37.47*** 26.22*** (3.085) -3.897 (6.047) ***002- -0.190+ (0.0976) -0.126 (0.231) -0.104 (0.0894) -0.199 (0.156) -50.31*** -34.63*** -42.61*** -7.989* -37.48*** -0.0121 (0.190) -19.95*** (0.0648) -20.73*** Uncertainty × Political Connections Uncertainty × Foreign VC Uncertainty × GVC Uncertainty × CVC Computer Constant MED IRR</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n### 5.1.1 | Alternative explanations  \n\nWe examine several other explanations for the VC decision to retain equity or cash out. We present the results for the logit estimations. A VC may face human capital constraint if it is to delay exit. Human capital is a fixed resource in limited supply and cannot be expanded easily. Human capital constraint may limit the attention of the fund managers, dilute their value-added services, and even reduce their ability to monitor and advise (e.g., Cumming, 2006; Fulghieri & Sevilir, 2009). We scaled VC portfolio size by the total number of fund managers for each VC (e.g., Cumming & Walz, 2010) and scaled VC capital under management (e.g., Cumming & Dai, 2011) by the number of funds and the total number of fund managers for each VC. The higher the scaled measures, the greater the human capital constraint, and the less likely a VC will retain equity. We collected data on fund managers from corporate websites, online search via Baidu and Tianyancha. Despite our painstaking efforts, we were only able to obtain data for 182 VCs and 535 observations of our sample. In Model 1 of Table 4, VC portfolio has a negative effect on the likelihood of retaining equity, which is consistent with the portfolio argument to balance risk and return and with the cash constraint argument about having sufficient capital to finance portfolio companies. The scaled VC portfolio variable has a statistically insignificant effect. In Model 2, VC capital under management, which is an inverse indicator of cash constraint, has a positive effect as expected, and the coefficient of the scaled VC capital variable is statistically insignificant. These insignificant results do not appear to be driven by collinearity as the correlations are all below 0.45. Nevertheless, the results should be interpreted with caution because of the large number of missing values and the fact that data on VC fund managers are largely time-invariant except for four VCs.  \n\nVC fund performance may influence risk preferences and incentives of a VC, which in turn may affect its exit decision. First, individuals exhibit risk-seeking behavior in choices involving sure losses (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Fund managers with poor performance have less to lose and continuing ownership in the venture gives the VC a chance to achieve its reference point (Bock & Schmidt, 2015). Second, VCs typically earn a $2\\%$ management fee that is based on the total capital raised from limited partners, plus $20\\%$ of carried interest from profitable investments. This compensation structure may incentivize fund managers to make investment decisions based on prior performance (liev & Lowry, 2020). Specifically, fund managers with poor performance may have more incentive to undertake high risk, for example, by staying with the investee venture rather than cashing out-they face little downside if continuing ownership does not pay off, but substantial upside if it does. Extant research has measured fund performance in terms of net fund cash flows (Bock $\\&$ Schmidt, 2015), but such information is unavailable in our dataset. IRR may be used to evaluate VC fund performance (Kaplan $\\&$ Schoar, 2005) with some caution (Weber et al., 2016), but it is only available when a VC fund exits. Since both the risk preference and incentive arguments suggest that higher performance would be positively associated with cashing out, it can be inferred from these arguments that those that retain equity willikely have lower performance. With this assumption, we generated a dummy variable that is equal to one if the IRR is larger than the median of the sample. Results in Model 3 of Table 4 show that our main results remain largely the same but that the IRR measure is statistically insignificant. This result needs to be interpreted with the limitations of the measure in mind.  \n\n### 5.1.2| Alternative model  \n\nWe have so far analyzed retaining equity relative to cashing out, without distinguishing retaining some equity (i.e., partial exit) from retaining all equity (i.e., no exit). A small number of VC funds in our sample chose not to exit at all (see Table 1) and six increased shareholding post-IPO within 1 year after lockup expiration. We estimate a multinomial logit model to compare no exit, partial exit and full exit (i.e., cashout). The multinomial method is proper as the three alternative choices are conceptually distinct but not necessarily ordinal (Long & Freese, 2006; McFadden, 1973). As Models 4-6 of Table 4 show, the main effect of uncertainty remains, as do the moderating effect of patent applications for the comparison of partial exit and full exit, and the moderating effect of market surprise for the comparison of no exit with partial and full exits. These findings are broadly consistent with our arguments.  \n\n### 5.1.3  | Alternative sample  \n\nA VC may drop out of the top 10 shareholder list not because of the VC selling shares but because of others increasing shareholding that dilutes the VC's equity stake. To check the potential influence of such cases, we collected historical data on the equity stake of the top 10 shareholders for each quarter between 2009 and 2016 from the WIND database. For each VC that dropped out in the current quarter, we compared its shareholding percentage in the previous quarter with the shareholding percentage of the shareholder that has the least shareholding percentage among the top 10 in the current quarter. If this shareholder's current shareholding is more than the VC's previous shareholding, the VC may have dropped out due to this shareholder's increased shareholding. Indeed, we found 18 such cases of VCs dropping out. Among them, 14 VCs were holding less than $1\\%$ ofshareswhentheydropped out. We performed a robustness test by removing these 18 cases from the sample. Model 7 of Table 4 shows that this doesnot alter ourresults.  \n\n### 5.1.4 |  Unique institutional setting  \n\nWe examined whether the effect of uncertainty is contingent on the unique Chinese setting that is characterized by the prominent roles of GVCs, CVCs, political connections, and foreign VCs. While GVCs tend to retain equity, the likelihood of retaining equity is significantly reduced under higher uncertainty (Models 8 of Table 4). These results probably indicate that government VCs face less financial constraint but are more risk-averse. The interaction effects of CVCs, political connections, and foreign VCs are insignificant.  \n\nWe included industry dummies in our analyses for a proper test of the real options logic. Different motivations may underline IPOs in different industries. For illustration, as compared with IT and computer companies, biotechnology firms may operate in a revenue-negative status at the time of considering an IPO (Guo et al., 2o04). As shown in Model 9 of Table 4, VCs are more likely to retain equity in the medical sector, but there is no significant difference betweenthecomputerindustry andothersectors.  \n\n# 6 I DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION  \n\nThis study identified a previously unrecognized driver for a VC to remain a significant owner in an investee venture after venture IPO: to retain the opportunity to benefit from the upside potential of the IPO venture under uncertainty. We developed a real options framework to capture this intuition by conceptualizing the decision to retain equity or cash out as holding or exercising an exchange option. Real options studies in management and entrepreneurship tend to rely on heuristics from models of standalone options such as options to defer, grow, abandon and exit (Li et al., 2007; Trigeorgis & Reuer, 2017). Each of these options is usually conceptualized as a choice between a known value and an uncertain value, that is, the value of an asset to be acquired or divested versus the price at which the asset can be acquired or divested. In the case of a VC's exit from a newly public venture, however, both the VC's valuation and the market's valuation are subject to uncertainty and evolve stochastically over time. So, any option embedded in the VC's equity stake cannot be properly analyzed as a standalone option in our context. Our conceptualization not only allows us to characterize correctly the option held by the VC via retained equity in the IPO venture but also enables us to analyze how the VC's exit decision is influenced by both uncertainty and private information, the two factors that enhance the value of the exchange option. Our empirical analysis offered support for this real options view, after we accounted for a large number of factors, including signaling, cash and human capital constraints, blockholding, portfolio diversification, institutional settings (e.g., GVC, CVC, political connections), and industry-andtime-fixedeffects.  \n\nThis study offers an integrated framework to combine the real options logic with the information economics view by highlighting the reinforcing effects of uncertainty and private information on strategic behavior. Extant research has invoked information asymmetry as a key condition motivating the VC to retain equity stake in a newly public venture because the commitment to doing so can send a positive signal to the market about the VC's confidence in the venture (Cumming & Maclntosh, 2003). This view, however, is based solely on the VC's possession of private information, and does not incorporate the role of uncertainty that remains prominent for newly public ventures and in VCs' exit decision. This view also leaves out the interaction between uncertainty and information asymmetry. Hence, it cannot uncover the role of the exchange option as an opportunity cost of cashing out or the effect of uncertainty per se on the decision. In this regard, our theoretical framework incorporates both uncertainty and private information, extends the insights from the information economics view, and enhances our understanding of the drivers in the VC exit decision after venture IPO. In our analysis, the interaction effect of uncertainty and private information provides discriminating evidence for the proposed real options framework.  \n\nIn our empirical analysis, we employed two variables as proxies for information asymmetry between insiders (e.g., the VC) and outsiders: the venture-level patent applications and industry-level market surprise. The results indicate that each of these factors can enhance the positive effect of uncertainty on the VC's propensity to retain equity after venture IPO, in support of our predictions. These results have interesting implications. First, patenting is typically considered to send a credible signal to the public about a firm's technological competitiveness in future (Levitas & Chi, 201o). But patent applications may also increase the information asymmetry between insiders and outsiders, raising the VC's likelihood of retaining equity and decreasing the rate of exit. Second, market surprise has been viewed as a cue for investors to assess the growth potential of firms in an industry (Kogut, 1991). Our study suggests that such a publicly visible cue may also indicate a gap between insiders and outsiders in their valuations of firms in the industry and raise the value of any exchange option that may have been embedded in the insiders' equity stake. Future research may shed light on the implications of market surprise on decision making in other contexts such as corporatedivestitures.  \n\nOur findings have interesting implications for practice. In our interviews, VC executives were well aware of the importance of uncertainty and market volatility in their exit decisions. As for information asymmetry, they pointed primarily to the importance of signals for pre-IPO investment decisions and the venture IPO decision, but less so for post-IPO exit decisions. Both our theoretical framework and empirical analysis suggest that private information may play another role in the exit decision in reinforcing the effect of uncertainty. The message is clear: VCs need to take into account both uncertainty and private information in their exit decisions after venture IPO.  \n\nWe note several areas where the study can be extended. We analyzed the role of exogenous industry uncertainty in our theorization and empirical analysis. Such a focus allows us to examine closely the interaction between uncertainty and private information. Extant research has shown that different sources of uncertainty, such as technological and demand uncertainty, may have differential effects on market valuation of R&D (Oriani $\\&$ Sobrero, 2008). Research has also pointed to the distinction between technical and cost uncertainty (Pindyck, 1993) as well as that between ex0genous and endogenous uncertainty (Folta, 1998; Li et al., 2007; McGrath, 1997). Recent entrepreneurship research also suggests distinct effects of perceived effect uncertainty and response uncertainty (Zhang et al., 2021). A more fine-grained analysis of different sources and types of uncertainty may bring additional insightsto a decision context like ours.  \n\nWhile the options-based rationale for retaining equity is generalizable to other contexts, an emerging VC market such as the one in China in our sample period is unique because it has a relatively young VC sector characterized by rapid growth and substantial uncertainty and information asymmetry. It also has unique institutional settings. Comparative analysis across countries may uncover systematic differences, if any.  \n\nIn conclusion, this study offers a novel explanation for VCs' exit decision after venture IPO. The exchange option perspective that we developed allows us to incorporate the concepts of uncertainty and information asymmetry into a broader theoretical framework. Both figure prominently in many decision contexts but their interaction has largely eluded research so far. The insights from our theoretical framework can be applied to analyze a broad range of exit and possibly entry decisions in strategic entrepreneurship that involve two parties with divergent valuations under conditions of uncertainty and information asymmetry. We also hope that the study stimulates further work in real options research that incorporates other important concepts such as information asymmetry to gain insights on strategic entrepreneurship questions (Li et al., 2007; Trigeorgis & Reuer, 2017).  \n\n# ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  \n\nThe authors thank Supradeep Dutta, Tim Folta, Glenn Hoetker, Jay Janney, JT Li, Raffael Oriani, Siri Terjesen, Xiaoyu Yu, and the seminar participants at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Lehigh University, Shanghai University, Syracuse University, University of Kansas, and University of Texas at Dallas, for their helpful comments.

As shown in a number of models on this type of options (e.g., Chi, 2000; Stulz, 1982), the value of the option depends on the potential divergence between the unexpected changes in the two stochastic variables, $\\Delta M_{t}-E[\\Delta M_{t}]$ and $\\Delta V_{t}-E[\\Delta V_{t}]$ .The critical condition for treating theVC's valuation and the market's valuation as two separate stochastic variables is the VC's possession of relationship-specific knowledge and private information because otherwise there would be no theoretical basis for the unexpected changes in their valuations to diverge. In the absence of such divergence, the equity stake that the VC holds in the post-IPO venture would have no option value. Similarly, because participants in the stock market do not possess such privileged knowledge and information, their equity stake in the post-IPO venture does not confer them a valuable exchange option.  \n\n2 It is proper to conceptualize the VC'sretaining equity as confering a real option because it meets the three conditions for a real option to be present or valuable: uncertainty, irreversibility and managerial discretion (Dixit & Pindyck, 1994; Kogut & Kulatilaka, 2o01). In our context, once the lockup expires, the VC has some discretion as to whether and when to retain equity or cash out (Gompers & Lerner, 1998). It is also reasonable to assume some degree of irreversibility in the VC exit decision. Any private information in the VC's possession at venture IPO and continued access to privileged information after venture IPO are due to the knowledge and relationships built up over a long period of time for the VC as a significant funder and an advisor. The benefits from privileged information will be substantially lost after the VC cashes out, resulting in a sunk cost. First, even though the VC can in theory reinvest in the venture's stock, the potential gain from its original private information may have dissipated due to revelation of new information to the public by the time of the reinvestment. Second, the loss of access to privileged information after cashing out also makes it more difficult for the VC to value the venture accurately. Finally, there is a reentry cost if the VC tries to replicate the benefits by investing in a similar new venture, because it requires time and effort to learn the venture's potential value and develop the requisite relationship for possessing private information or gaining privileged access to information on the venture. In the empirical analysis below, we assume a nontrivial degree of irreversibility for the VC's equity holding in the venture, so that we can devote our analysis to the role of uncertainty and private information.  \n\n3 We interviewed 16 experts during 2015-2023, including 10 executives of venture capital and investment companies, three entrepreneurs, an executive of a credit assessment company specialized in public listing, an executive in an asset management association, and a scholar with expertise on venture capital- and IPO-related policies and procedures (interviewed twice). Our goal is to understand VCs' exit strategy after venture public listing. These interviews were semistructured with open-ended questions related to (1) vC exit in general (e.g., type of VC funds, ownership and blockholding, lockup policy, time of the exit decision, time needed to exit, and impact costs of share sales), and (2) rationale for retaining equity and cashing out, including the role of uncertainty and information asymmetry.  \n\n4 To see this more clearly,imagine that, in a fixed time period divided into 100 increments, 50 of the random changes in $M_{t}$ and $V_{t}$ cause them to converge. Suppose 5 of the 50 convergent changes are consecutive and the cumulative changes fromthemcause $M_{t}$ to converge to and exceed $V_{t}$ and allow the VC to realize the gain from exercising the option. When the level of uncertainty is higher, each of the five pairs of $\\Delta{M}_{t}$ and $\\Delta{}V_{t}$ is larger, so it may take only 3 or 4 of them to result in the trigger of the exercise threshold that enables the VC to realize the gain from the option.  \n\n5 The market will eventuallycorrect itself in the future by adjusting the market price to the surprises, but such a correction will take some time to materialize fully.  \n\n6 During the lockup, VCs and other shareholders do not selany equity shares for a specified period of time after the venture IPO. According to China's SEC, the lockup period is 1 year for general investors, which is comparable with that in Australia but longer than the typical 180 days in the United States (Bradley et al., 2001; Hsu et al., 2020). Strategic investors have a lockup period of 3 years. A strategic investor has at least $5\\%$ ownership of a venture and has deep involvement in the venture's decision making, e.g., through board seats. Based on the lockup duration, about $14\\%$ of the dyads in our sample involve strategic investments. Research suggests that lockup helps mitigate information asymmetry and agency problems between insiders and market participants pre-IPO (Arthurs et al., 2009; Brav & Gompers, 2003).   \n7 Our sample includes standard venture capital investments excluding buyouts) made by VCs and private equity (PE) fims. For the arguments of this study, the distinction between venture capital and PE firms is of little theoretical and empirical importance, as far as PE firms make standard venture capital investments. We thus use the term VC for simplicity and convenience.   \n8 VC-backed ventures can go public via one of the three major stock exchanges in China during the study period: the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) Board, the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Board, and the Main Board. The Main Board, similar to NYSE, is for larger companies. The SME board is for SMEs with relatively long history and operational stability. GEM, similar to NASDAQ in the United States, provides a public trading platform for China's high-growth, highvolatility ventures that are not yet qualified for the main board. There are no policy restrictions on which board to choose. The vast majority of our sample ventures are traded on GEM $(47\\%)$ and SEM $(42\\%)$   \n9 It is possible that the VC retains a small portion of its equity holding in the venture and that the equitystake is not significant enough for the VC to remain on the top 10 shareholder list. We have no way to track such equity position changes systematically, which remains a limitation of our study. Given that a few IPO prospectuses listed more than 10 shareholders, one of the authors took a closer look at such companies. We found that the equity stake held by shareholders outside the top 10 list is typically less than $2\\%$ . As a result, we view such a VC as not remaining a significant owner. In the robustness test below, we deal with cases of a VC dropping out because of other shareholders increasing equity stake in a newly public venture.   \n10 The number of public firms alone is 90 on average for each industry in our sample. Therefore, i isreasonable to view industry-level uncertainty as largely exogenous.   \n11 This is in line withthe percentage o retaind equity in other countries. For example, in the United States, VCs sll on average $34\\%$ of shares by the time of the first proxy statement after the lockup expiration (Paeglis & Veeren, 2013). In Australia, approximately a third of VCs completely divest their holdings at IPO (Owen & Suchard, 2013). Around one third up to one half of IPOs are exited partially in a cross-country sample (Cumming & Maclntosh, 2003).  \n\n# REFERENCES  \n\nAghion, P., & Tirole, J. (1994).

Harrisonb,1  \n\naDepartment of Geography, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK Centre for Entrepreneurship,Deparment of Management Studies,University of Aberdeen, AberdeenAB243QY,UK  \n\nReceived 1 April 1999; accepted 1 August 2000  \n\n# Abstract  \n\nDespite growing interest in venture capital, there is a paucity of information on the rate of return to these investments and the limited research that is available refers almost entirely to portfolio returns for venture capital funds. The investment returns to business angels have been virtually ignored. This paper provides the first attempt to analyse the returns to informal venture capital investment using data on 128 exited investments from a survey of 127 business angel investors in the UK. The paper finds that the distribution of returns is highly skewed, with $34\\%$ of exits at a total loss, $13\\%$ at a partial loss or break-even, but with $23\\%$ showing an IRR of $50\\%$ or above. Trade sales are the main way in which business angels harvest their investments. The median time to exit for successful investments was 4 years. Large investments, large deal sizes involving multiple coinvestors, and management buyouts (MBOs) were most likely to be high-performing investments.  \n\n$\\copyright$ 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Executive summary  \n\nThere is a paucity of reliable information on the returns from venture capital investing. The available evidence on the investment performance of venture capital firms is limited to a small number of studies and some highly aggregated figures produced by national venture capital associations. Information is even more limited in the case of the informal venture capital market. The objective of this paper is to fill this significant gap by examining the returns achieved by business angels, the ways in which they harvested their investments and the length of the holding period.  \n\nThe most appropriate benchmark against which to compare the performance of investments by business angels is with the returns achieved by venture capital fund managers. However, this is extremely problematic. The standard measure of performance in the venture capital industry is the internal rate of return (IRR) of the fund. This takes account of cash-oncash returns from the sale of shares and disbursements (e.g., dividend payments) plus the share of the residual value of the fund's holding in cash and investments in portfolio companies that have not been realised, net of management fees. However, business angels do not invest by means of a dedicated fund and tend to think about investment performance in terms of capital gains multiples on each investment that they make. The most appropriate basis for evaluating the investment performance of business angels, and for comparing the investment performance of business angels and venture capital funds, is therefore on a dealby-deal basis, with the returns measured simply in terms of the multiple achieved and the length of the holding period.  \n\nInformation on the investment performance of business angels is derived from 127 usable responses from a mail survey of business angels in the UK. Only 51 of the 101 respondents who had made investments had actually exited from any of these investments. In total, these investors had exited from 128 investments. It is these investments that are the focus of this paper. The calculation of the investment performance did not take account of any income that the investors might have received from dividends or fees. As a consequence, this may inflate the proportion of exits that are recorded as losing money and reduce the proportion that broke even or generated positive returns. Comparative data on the investment performance of venture capital funds was obtained from Murray (1999). This provides deal-specific investment performance data for three early-stage technology specialist UK venture capital funds. Such a comparison is far from ideal, and any conclusions should therefore be regarded as tentative. However, the availability of comparative information is severely restricted as venture capital funds are normally unwilling to release information on the performance of their individual investments.  \n\nBusiness angels and venture capital funds differ in a host of ways, including investment experience, resources, governance, investment philosophy and objectives, and the approach to investment decision-making. This, in turn, provides the basis for anticipating clear differences in the investment performance of business angels and venture capital funds. However, the nature of these differences is open to competing interpretations.  \n\nThis paper tests three hypotheses.  \n\nHypothesis 1: Business angels will have a poorer investment performance than venture capital fund managers.  \n\nThis hypothesis is based on the greater investment experience of venture capital fund managers, the noneconomic considerations that business angels take into account when making investment decisions, differences between business angels and venture capital funds in terms of approaches to investment appraisal, due diligence and contracting, and the deeper pockets of venture capital funds.  \n\nHypothesis 2: Business angels will have a systematically superior investment performance to that of venture capital fund managers.  \n\nThis hypothesis is underpinned by three factors. First, one of the key differences between business angels and venture capital funds is that fund managers have an obligation to invest whereas business angels, who are investing their own money, do not. Investing under time pressure is likely to lead to suboptimal investment decisions that can be expected to result in some bad investments. Business angels can be more selective because they do not have to invest. Second, business angels can devote more time to supporting their investee companies and their entrepreneurial background enables them to make a more effective contribution. Third, because of adverse selection problems, the aggressive valuation stance adopted by venture capital funds results in inferior deals.  \n\nHypothesis 3: Business angels and venture capital funds will have different returns profiles because of differences in their approaches to managing risk.  \n\nThe returns profile of business angels will approximate a normal distribution. Because most business angels make only a small number of investments, they have limited ability to reduce their risk through diversification. Business angels therefore concentrate on avoiding bad investments rather than seeking winners and aim to make a return on every investment they make.  \n\nThe returns to informal venture capital in the UK are negatively skewed: $34\\%$ of exits took place with a total loss of the investment and a further $13\\%$ generated either a partial loss or broke even in nominal terms; only $10\\%$ generated IRRs in excess of $100\\%$ . This investment performance is significantly different from that of venture capital funds. Hypothesis 1 cannot be supported. Business angels have a lower proportion of investments in which they lose money, which is consistent with Hypothesis 2, but this hypothesis cannot be fully supported because business angels and venture capital fund managers have similar proportions of highperforming investments. Hypothesis 3 receives the strongest support. Although negatively skewed, the returns to informal venture capital deals are less skewed than those of early-stage venture capital deals. Business angels have fewer investments in which they lose money but a significantly higher proportion of their investments either break-even or generate only modest returns. This is consistent with the argument that business angels will be more concerned to avoid bad investments than to find winners. However, Hypothesis 3 cannot be fully supported as the proportion of very successful investments (IRRs of $100\\%$ and over) made by business angels is similar to that of venture capital funds.  \n\nTrade sales are the main way in which business angels harvest their investments. These were used for successful investments as well as some that only broke even. IPOs accounted for only a small minority of exits. Exits from “living dead’ investments have been primarily through sales to other shareholders or new third party shareholders.  \n\nThe median holding period was 4 years. However, this varied by investment performance. For investments that generated a satisfactory or exceptional return the median holding period was 4 years. However, the median holding period was 2 years for lossmaking and break-even investments and 6 years for investments that generated low positive returns.  \n\nManagement buyouts (MBOs), large deals involving multiple coinvestors, and deals involving large amounts of follow-on investment are the most likely to generate very high returns (IRR of $50\\%$ and above). However, by no means did every high-performing investment have these characteristics.  \n\nThe findings have important implications for policy-makers. The need to improve the availability of early-stage venture capital has been recognised by national governments and the European Commission. The key conclusion for UK policy-makers is that the findings support the recent introduction of a capital gains tax (CGT) taper for investors in unlisted companies, the effect of which is to reduce the amount of capital gains that is charged to tax on the disposal of business assets. This taper was originally set at 10 years when introduced in 1998, which was out of line with the time horizon over which business angels typically invest, but was reduced to 4 years in the 2000 Budget. More significantly, the evidence presented in this paper — that the risks outweigh the rewards for business angels, with the proportion of investments generating zero or negative returns exceeding those that return a significant multiple on the original investment — suggests that stimulating the supply of informal venture capital may need a richer cocktail of tax incentives than merely a reduction in CGT, including front-end tax reliefs and even venture capital guarantees.  \n\n## 2. Introduction  \n\nThere is a paucity of reliable information about the returns from venture capital investing. Institutional venture capital firms do not generally make public any information about their actual returns and hence most of the research has been restricted to the performance of the small minority of venture capital firms that are publicly quoted (e.g., Kleiman and Shulman, 1992; Manigart et al., 1992). In one of the very few in-depth studies of the performance of limited partnerships — the most common organisational form adopted by venture capital firms — Bygrave et al. (1989) found that for funds formed in the period 1969 to 1985 the mean IRR peaked in 1982 at $27\\%$ , but overall returns were typically below $20\\%$ . This confirms earlier, less detailed, studies that found that “rather than the folklore figure of $30\\%$ to $50\\%$ , actual venture capital returns have most often been in the teens, with occasional periods in the $20\\%$ to $30\\%$ range and rare spikes above $30\\%^{\\prime}$ ， (Bygrave and Timmons, 1992, p. 153). In Europe, because of the sensitivity of returns information, analyses have been conducted by national venture capital associations and the European Venture Capital Association (EVCA). These studies lack transparency in the process of analysis (Wright and Robbie, 1998). A recent EVCA study of the overall returns on mature venture capital funds across Europe found that buyout funds generated the highest returns with a median IRR from inception to the end of 1996 of $15.5\\%$ . This figure is three times that earned by funds specialising in early- and development-stage investments $4.5\\%$ and $5.5\\%$ , respectively). The superior performance of funds specialising in MBOs and MBIs is confirmed by studies of the UK, French, Dutch, and Italian venture capital industries (Wright et al., 1998; Burgel, 2000).  \n\nRelatively few investments in the portfolios of venture capital funds produce large gains. Thus, the overall performance of a fund is crucially dependent on the presence of a small number of very successful investments. These investments are the ones that are generally harvested by means of an IPO (Bygrave and Timmons, 1992). An analysis by Venture Economics of 383 investments harvested by 13 venture capital funds in the period 1969 to 1985, reported by Bygrave and Timmons (1992), noted that just $6.8\\%$ of investments returned 10 times or more on the invested capital whereas over $60\\%$ lost money or failed to exceed the savings account rate. Almost $50\\%$ of the final total value of the funds came from just $6.7\\%$ of investments. This study also noted that early-stage investments produced proportionately more winners (a return of five times or more on the original investment) and more outright losers than investments in expansions or LBOs/acquisitions. This negatively skewed pattern of returns is also found in a study of the portfolios of three early-stage UK venture capital funds (Murray, 1999).  \n\nThere is virtually no information on investment performance in the informal venture capital market —— which is the main source of risk finance for businesses at their seed, startup, and early growth stages, particularly where small amounts of finance are sought (under $\\pounds250,000/\\cup\\mathbb{S}\\mathbb{S}500,000)$ (Freear and Wetzel, 1990; Freear et al., 1995; Mason and Harrison, 1994; Sohl, 1999). Although some studies have identified the expectations of business angels, in terms of their exit horizon, method of exit, the rate of return, and proportion of ‘winners’ and “losers’ (Wetzel, 1981; Tymes and Krasner, 1983; Mason and Harrison, 1994), there has been just one study of the actual returns achieved by business angels. This study, based on responses from 39 active business angels in Finland who had made a total of 49 exits, found that $20\\%$ of investments had made a significant return (IRR in excess of $20\\%$ $13\\%$ had made moderate returns, $13\\%$ broke-even, and the remainder $(56\\%)$ lost money (Lumme et al., 1996, 1998). The investment performance of business angels therefore remains an issue where Wetzel's (1986, p. 131) call for research that can “put boundaries on our ignorance'” remains appropriate.  \n\nThe objective of this paper is to fill this significant void in our knowledge of the informal venture capital market by examining the returns achieved by business angels, the ways in which they harvested their investments, and the timing of their harvest. The paper is based on deal-specific information rather than on the portfolio measures of performance used in previous venture capital studies. It seeks to answer four basic questions about the informal venture capital market that, because of difficulties in assembling the necessary data, have not previously been answered.  \n\n· What returns do business angels achieve from their investments and how do these returns compare with the performance of ‘professional’ venture capital investors? · How long do business angels wait before harvesting their investments? · How do business angels harvest their investments? · What are the characteristics of the best performing investments?  \n\nThe next section of the paper considers the methodological issues involved in measuring the performance of venture capital investments and in comparing the investment returns of business angels and venture capital funds, and describes the data sources used. This is followed by a consideration of how the performance of business angels might compare with that of venture capital fund managers. Later sections present information on investment performance in aggregate and by type of investment, the methods used by business angels to harvest their investments, the timing of the harvest and the characteristics of high-performance investments.  \n\n### 3. Methodological issues and data sources  \n\nThe standard measure to assess performance in the venture capital industry is the IRR of the fund. This takes account of cash-on-cash returns from the sale of shares and disbursements (e.g., dividend payments), plus the share of the residual value of the fund's holdings in cash and investments in portfolio companies that have no publicly traded shares, net of management fees (Bygrave and Timmons, 1992; Burgel, 2000).2 This is an inappropriate method for assessing the performance of investments in the informal venture capital market because business angels do not invest by means of a dedicated fund and so do not have “idle cash', as venture capital funds have. Rather, they think about their investment performance in terms of capital gains multiples on each investment they make (Wetzel, 1994). The implication is that the evaluation of the investment performance of business angels must be undertaken on a deal-by-deal basis, with the returns measured very simply in terms of the multiple achieved and the length of time taken to realise the return. This, in turn, means that the only basis for comparing the investment performance of business angels and venture capital fund managers is also on a deal-specific basis. However, appropriate data are rarely available to permit such a comparison to be made. Venture capital funds do not normally make information available on the performance of individual investments in their portfolio and where such information is available it is difficult to make a like-for-like comparison with the investment performance of business angels because of the specialised investment focus of most venture capital funds. This paper has been able to assemble data on the performance of investments by business angels and has used information from Murray (1999) on the performance of investments made by three UK early-stage venture capital funds to make what is inevitably a tentative comparison.  \n\nResearch on the informal venture capital market is hampered by the difficulties involved in identifying business angels. There are no directories of business angels, their investments are not publicly recorded and most strive to preserve their anonymity, hence, researchers have typically had to rely upon samples of convenience. The information on the investment performance of business angels is derived from 127 usable responses from a postal survey of over 10oo business angels who were registered with business angel networks (BANs) in the UK. These organisations operate like ‘dating agencies', providing a communication channel that enables business angels to review investment opportunities while preserving their anonymity and allows entrepreneurs seeking finance to present their investment opportunity to a large number of potential investors (Harrison and Mason, 1996; Van Osnabrugge and Robinson, 2000). The managers of 19 BANs agreed to distribute questionnaires to investors registered with their service.? In addition, some questionnaires were sent to investors who were identified through recommendations and informal contacts. It was not possible to calculate a meaningful response rate because it is not known how many investors are members of more than one network nor the number of investors registered with BANs who are not business angels.  \n\nThis methodology is open to three potential sources of bias. First, although many thousands of active and potential business angels are registered with the 48 BANs that are currently in operation in the UK (BVCA, 1999), these investors may not be typical of the overall population of business angels. Van Osnabrugge (1998) suggests that there are few differences between business angels who are members of BANs and those who are not. However, any attempt to test the representativeness of a sample of business angels runs up against the problem that the population of business angels is unknown and probably unknowable (Wetzel, 1983). To counteract the bias inherent in drawing samples from just one BAN (Mason and Harrison, 1997) the sample has been drawn from a number of different types of networks (large and small, local, and regional, private, and public) in various parts of the country. Second, there may be a problem with response bias. However, this could not be tested because no information was available on the characteristics on nonrespondents. An alternative method of testing for nonresponse bias is to compare early and late respondents (Freear et al., 1994). This was not possible either because the various BANs sent out the questionnaires at different times. Third, there are inevitable questions concerning the reliability of self-report data. The main concern is with the ability of respondents to accurately recall the financial details of their investments. Another possibility is that respondents will exaggerate their successes and downplay their failures, although there are no a priori reasons for believing that this will have occurred.  \n\nThe questionnaire asked investors to report on all the investments that they had made in unquoted companies. Investors were asked to give details of the year that the investment was made, company characteristics (industry, technology, stage of business development, location), investment characteristics (amount invested, presence and type of any coinvestors, follow-on investment), and exit information (year of exit, method of exit, return multiple on a cash-on-cash basis). Where an investment was still held, investors were asked to indicate the anticipated performance.  \n\nThe vast majority $(87\\%)$ of the respondents had made at least one investment. In aggregate, the respondents to this survey had made a total of 372 investments. The sample is quite well balanced between those who have made just one or two investments $(37\\%)$ and more experienced investors who have made four or more investments $(33\\%)$ (Table 1). However, only 51 of the 101 respondents $(51\\%)$ who had made investments had actually exited from any of their investments. In total, these investors had exited from 128 investments. It is these investments that are the focus of the paper. These 51 business angels have been the more active investors in the sample: although accounting for just over half of all respondents who have made investments $(51\\%)$ they have made two-thirds all investments $(67\\%)$  \n\nFurthermore, the most active investors have made the most exits. Those who have made four or more investments, who account for one-third of investors in the study, have made almost three-quarters of all exits (Table 1). The likely explanation is that the more active investors have been investing for longer and so have had more time in which to make exits.  \n\nIn view of the link between investment characteristics and performance (Bygrave and Timmons, 1992), it is appropriate at this point to briefly note the main features of the sample of 128 investments that are the subject of this paper. In terms of vintage, the dates of the investments range from 1961 to 1996, but most were made in the 1990s $(38\\%)$ or 1980s $(48\\%)$ . The earliest exit was made in 1966, but $90\\%$ occurred after 1985 ( $77\\%$ since 1990). The investments were made in a wide range of different industries: $44\\%$ were in manufacturing with a further $16\\%$ in finance and business services, $13\\%$ in other services, $9\\%$ in retail and wholesale, and $7\\%$ in consumer services. There is no particular concentration in terms of stage of investment: $23\\%$ of investments were at start-up, a further $23\\%$ at the early stage, $21\\%$ were in established businesses, and $16\\%$ at the seed stage. The remaining $17\\%$ of investments were in MBOs/MBIs. Finally, $60\\%$ of investments were in London, the South East and the Eastern region, the most economically prosperous regions of the UK.  \n\nFor the purpose of this study, the IRR for each business angel investment was computed very simply, using an Excel spreadsheet, as an annualised figure derived from the multiple on the original investment and the length of time that the investment was held (i.e., the time value of money). It should be noted that this calculation of IRRs did not take into account any income that investors might have received from dividends, or fees paid for performing a nonexecutive chairman or director role or for consultancy services. In some cases, these running returns may accumulate over time to match or even exceed the amount initially invested (Mason and Harrison, 1996; Lengyel and Gulliford, 1997). The effect of excluding this information may therefore be to inflate the proportion of exits that are recorded as total or partial losses and reduce the proportion that broke even or generated positive returns. The exclusion of running returns will also tend to depress the positive IRRs recorded for successful exits. Accordingly, the results provided in the remainder of this paper are likely to underestimate the rates of return from informal venture capital investing in the UK.  \n\nTable 1 Investment activity of respondents   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">Investors</td><td colspan=\"2\">Number ofinvestments</td><td colspan=\"2\">Numberofexits</td></tr><tr><td>Numberofinvestments</td><td>Number</td><td>%</td><td>Number</td><td>%</td><td>Number</td><td>%</td></tr><tr><td>None</td><td>16</td><td>12.6</td><td>0</td><td>一</td><td>一</td><td>一</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>31</td><td>24.4</td><td>31</td><td>8.3</td><td>11</td><td>8.6</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>17</td><td>13.4</td><td>34</td><td>9.1</td><td>10</td><td>7.8</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>20</td><td>15.7</td><td>60</td><td>16.1</td><td>12</td><td>9.4</td></tr><tr><td>4-5</td><td>29</td><td>22.8</td><td>128</td><td>34.4</td><td>37</td><td>28.9</td></tr><tr><td>6-9</td><td>10</td><td>7.9</td><td>71</td><td>19.1</td><td>31</td><td>24.2</td></tr><tr><td>10+</td><td>4</td><td>3.1</td><td>48</td><td>12.9</td><td>27</td><td>21.1</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>127</td><td>100</td><td>372</td><td>100</td><td>128</td><td>100</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nComparative data on the investment performance of venture capital funds was obtained from Murray (1999). This provides deal-specific investment performance data, calculated as IRRs, for three UK early-stage specialist venture capital funds. It should be obvious from the earlier discussion that any conclusions drawn from such a comparison must be extremely tentative and hedged with caveats. However, the returns profile of the funds in Murray's sample are consistent with those reported by Bygrave and Timmons (1992) and Benjamin and Margulis (1996).  \n\n### 4. The investment performance of business angels and venture capital fund managers: alternative hypotheses  \n\nBusiness angels and venture capital fund managers differ in a host of ways, including investment experience, resources, governance, investment philosophy and objectives, and the approach to investment decision-making. This, in turn, provides the basis for anticipating clear differences in the investment performance of business angels and venture capital fund managers. However, the nature of these differences is open to competing interpretations.  \n\nThe first hypothesis is that business angels will have a poorer investment performance than venture capital fund managers. Specifically, the upside returns from their investments will be limited compared to those of venture capital fund managers. Hypothesis 1 is supported by the following arguments.  \n\nFirst, venture capital fund managers are much more experienced investors than business angels. In a comparison of the two types of investors, Van Osnabrugge (1998) reports that venture capitalist fund managers have made an average of 23 investments compared with 4 by business angels, and on average manage a portfolio of 10.3 investments compared with 2 by business angels. Other studies confirm that the majority of business angels have made three or fewer investments (Mason and Harrison, 1994; Coveney and Moore, 1998). However, business angels have significantly more entrepreneurial experience than venture capital fund managers (Van Osnabrugge, 1998), although this experience is likely to be confined to a particular industry or market segment. Fiet (1995) suggests that this detailed industry/market knowledge enables business angels to reduce their exposure to market risk. In practice, business angels often do not make use of this advantage, frequently investing in sectors where they do not have direct experience (Kelly and Hay, 1996; Van Osnabrugge,1998).  \n\nSecond, venture capital fund managers raise their finance predominately from large financial institutions such as pension funds, banks, and insurance companies, and have a duty of care when investing this money. Their investment decisions are therefore based on purely economic considerations. Business angels, in contrast, are investing their own money and so are not responsible to anyone else for how it is invested and for what reasons. The return on investment is a major motivation for business angels but it is not the sole motivation (Wetzel, 1981; Mason and Harrison, 1994; Lumme et al., 1998). They also want to have fun while making money (Benjamin and Margulis, 1996). Wetzel (1981) reports that some business angels are influenced by “hot buttons’ and both Wetzel (1981) and Sullivan (1994) note that some business angels are willing to make a trade-off between financial and nonfinancial returns. Their investments may also have spillovers to their other activities. In other words, the financial return on any particular investment made by a business angel does not necessarily capture their full return.  \n\nThird, there are also differences between business angels and venture capital fund managers in terms of approaches to investment appraisal, due diligence, and contracting (Van Osnabrugge, 1998). Many of these arise because business angels, unlike venture capital fund managers, decide on the worth of a potential investment as principals, rather than as agents and/or employees (Feeney et al., 1999; Prasad et al., 2000). Business angels are less concerned with financial projections and are less likely to calculate rates of return. They do less detailed due diligence, have fewer meetings with entrepreneurs, are less likely to take up references on the entrepreneur and are less likely to consult other people about the investment. Conversely, business angels are more likely to invest on ‘gut feeling'. On average, business angels also spend less time negotiating. Venture capital fund contracts are more comprehensive and more likely to include restrictive covenants. Business angels are less concerned about exit routes at the investment stage, whereas this is a much higher priority for venture capital fund managers (Table 2). These differences would again seem to be directly attributable to the fact that business angels are investing their own money whereas venture capital fund managers are investing funds that have been provided by financial institutions and so have a duty of care.  \n\nFinally, a further important distinction between business angels and venture capital fund managers is in terms of their investment capacity. In most cases business angels will not have pockets as deep as those of venture capital fund managers. As a consequence, business angels may be unable or unwilling to provide investee businesses with the further rounds of funding necessary for growth. This has two potential implications for the performance of their investments. First, if they are not in a position to provide follow-on finance to an investee business that needs a further round of investment this will put them in a weak negotiating position vis-a-vis an incoming investor regarding the valuation of their equity stake and may result in a significant dilution of their initial investment. Second, if the investee business is unable to raise additional finance it may become undercapitalised, with adverse consequences for its growth prospects and, in turn, the returns to their investor.  \n\nTable2 Differences between business angels and venture capital fund managers in due diligence measures   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Business angels</td><td>Venture capital fundmanagers</td></tr><tr><td>Experiencein sectorfunded</td><td>minimal</td><td>some</td></tr><tr><td>Timesmet entrepreneur beforeinvesting</td><td>5.4</td><td>9.5</td></tr><tr><td>Amountofsectorresearchconducted</td><td>some/minimal</td><td>extensive/some</td></tr><tr><td>Numberofindependentreferencestakenon theentrepreneur</td><td>0.96</td><td>4.2</td></tr><tr><td>Calculated rates of returnbefore investing (% saying yes)</td><td>32</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>Number of people consulted before decision to invest</td><td>3</td><td>4.4</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nSource: Van Osnabrugge (1998). All differences are statistically significant. Based on survey of 143 business angels and 119 venture capital fund managers who provided information on their most recent early-stage investment.  \n\nHowever, there is a further body of literature that would support a contrary hypothesis, namely that business angels will have a systematically superior investment performance to that of venture capital fund managers. This hypothesis is based on the following reasoning.  \n\nFirst, one of the most important differences between business angels and venture capital funds is that fund managers have an obligation to their investors to invest their money under management. They also need to demonstrate an investment track record to be able to raise further funds. Benjamin and Margulis (1996, p. 216) make this distinction clear: “Professional venture capitalists are essentially portfolio managers with a unique set of pressures. They have to raise their next fund; they have to invest the money under their management; they are responsible to overseers. None of this applies to the private investor.\" As a consequence, venture capital fund managers are under a time pressure to invest their money under management. This is likely to result in suboptimal investment decisions and lead to some bad investments. Business angels, on the other hand, are not responsible to anyone else. They are investing their own money and so are under no pressure to invest. Indeed, they need not make any investments at all. Because business angels do not have to invest they can be more selective. This is likely to result in fewer bad investments (Benjamin and Margulis, 1996).  \n\nSecond, businesses at their start-up and early growth stages typically require considerable support. Business angels are actively involved in the businesses in which they invest (Mason and Harrison, 1996; Lengyel and Gulliford, 1997). Their involvement is greater than that of venture capital fund managers (Van Osnabrugge, 1998). This is partly related to differences in investment motivation: business angels invest, in part, because they want to be involved with entrepreneurial ventures (Mason and Harrison, 1994). In addition, they are able to devote more time to their investments than venture capital fund managers because their portfolios of investee companies is smaller. Furthermore, the economics of business angel investing are different from those of venture capital fund managers. The cost of their time encourages venture capital fund managers to economise on the time that they give to their investee businesses in favour of seeking out and appraising new investment opportunities (Gifford, 1997) whereas business angels might be expected to give greater attention to their investee businesses because they do not cost their time in the same way. Additionally, there is considerable evidence that the value-added contribution that business angels make to their investee businesses through their hands-on involvement is greater than that of venture capital fund managers (Harrison and Mason, 1992; Ehrlich et al., 1994).  \n\nThird, venture capital fund managers adopt an aggressive valuation stance that results in inferior deals (Amit et al., 1990). Because of problems with adverse selection, venture capital fund managers cannot accurately assess the skill level of entrepreneurs. Most able entrepreneurs will not find the price offered by the venture capital fund manager to be sufficiently attractive and so they will choose to develop their projects without venture capital participation. The firms that venture capital fund managers back will therefore be those founded by less capable entrepreneurs, and thus more prone to fail. Business angels, in contrast, can be expected to offer less onerous investment terms to entrepreneurs because they have less power than venture capital fund managers to impose terms and conditions and so may be less likely to encounter adverse selection problems. Consequently, business angels will be expected to show a lower incidence of total or partial loss from their exited investments than will venture capital fund managers.  \n\nThe third hypothesis is that business angels and venture fund managers will have different returns profiles because of their different approaches to managing risk. We have already noted that business angels are less likely than venture capital funds to invest on a portfolio basis. Indeed, business angels typically make only a handful of investments. This reflects two factors. First, business angels are investing only a relatively small proportion of their wealth — typically less than $15\\%$ — in unquoted companies and thus the amounts that they have available to invest are relatively small compared to the size of a typical early-stage venture capital fund. Second, and more significant in most cases, business angels are unlikely to have sufficient time to play an active role in more than a few early-stage investee businesses. The consequence is that business angels have limited ability to reduce their level of risk through diversification. “Unlike a venture capital firm, which makes perhaps 15 investments in a year and can absorb a direct hit, the ..  private investor must take great care with each investment' (Benjamin and Margulis, 1996, p. 82). Business angels therefore concentrate on avoiding bad investments and seek a return on every investment that they make. Indeed, it is “much more important [for a business angel] to avoid a bad investment than to try to hit a home run' (Benjamin and Margulis, 1996, p. 221). This contrasts with the approach of venture capital fund managers, which is to try “\"to hit a home run, not merely ... maintain a good batting average” (Quindlan, 2000, p. xix). This suggests that the returns profile of venture capital funds will be negatively skewed, but with a long positive tail, reflecting a high proportion of loss-making investments but also a small number of very successful investments, whereas that of the business angel will be closer to a normal distribution, with relatively few unsuccessful investments, few very successful investments, and a high number of investments that generate positive, if modest, returns.  \n\n### 5. The returns to informal venture capital  \n\nIt is clear from Fig. 1 that the returns to informal venture capital in the UK are negatively skewed: $34\\%$ of exits took place with the total loss of the investment, and a further $13\\%$ generated either a partial loss or broke even in nominal terms; only $10\\%$ generated IRRs in excessof $100\\%$ . This returns profile is not significantly different from that of Finnish business angels (Lumme et al., 1996; 1998). However, it is significantly different to the returns on investment that Benjamin and Margulis (1996) suggest is typical in the USA.6 Table 3 compares the returns profile of business angels with that of venture capital funds, using Murray's (1999) data for comparison. This indicates that the investment performance of business angels is significantly different to that of venture capital funds. Specifically, angels have significantly fewer investments that generate negative returns and a significantly higher proportion that break-even or generate moderate returns $(0-49\\%$ IRR).  \n\n![](images/8035fb5c09402a48753df64f809fda0dcf296f4625e79b9081ff0361f021a4bd.jpg)  \n\nTable3 Comparison of the returns to informal venture capital and venture capital fund investments   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>IRR (%)</td><td>Venture capital fund investments (%)</td><td>Informalventure capital investments (%)</td></tr><tr><td>Negative</td><td>64.2</td><td>39.8</td></tr><tr><td>0-24</td><td>7.1</td><td>23.8</td></tr><tr><td>25-49</td><td>7.1</td><td>12.7</td></tr><tr><td>50-99</td><td>9.5</td><td>13.3</td></tr><tr><td>100+</td><td>12.0</td><td>10.2</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n$\\chi^{2}=9.22$ $d f=2$ . Significant at the .01 level. The $0-24\\%$ and $25-49\\%$ categories were combined to perform the chi-square test. Sources: Murray (1999) and authors’ survey.  \n\nIn the light of this evidence, it is difficult to sustain Hypothesis 1 that stated that business angels will have a poorer investment performance than venture capital fund managers, and specifically that the upside potential of business angel investments will be more limited than for venture capital fund managers. The evidence that business angels have a lower proportion of investments in which they lose money is consistent with Hypothesis 2 that stated that business angels will have a systematically superior investment performance to that of venture capital fund managers. However, as business angels and venture capital funds have similar proportions of high-performing investments Hypothesis 2 cannot be fully supported.  \n\nHypothesis 3 receives the strongest support. Although negatively skewed, the returns to informal venture capital deals are less skewed than those of early-stage venture capital deals. Business angels have fewer investments in which they lose money, but a significantly higher proportion of their investments either break-even or generate only modest returns. This is consistent with the argument of Benjamin and Margulis (1996) that business angels will be more concerned to avoid bad investments than to find winners. It may also reflect differences between business angels and venture capitalists in terms of their attitude to ‘living dead' investments. Business angels cannot replace the management of such businesses as easily as venture capitalists, and may also be more patient and more willing to contribute hands on support in an effort to improve performance. In contrast, venture capital fund managers are under external pressure to achieve a high IRR for their fund and so can be expected to adopt a more ‘ruthless’ attitude in divesting from underperforming investments. They also have greater capability than angels in achieving divestments (e.g., by merger) (Runka et al., 1992). Removing underperforming investments in order to spend more time supporting good performing investments is also likely to be an optimum use of the venture capitalist's time (Gifford, 1997).  \n\nHowever, Hypothesis 3, which stated that business angels, in avoiding the risk of bad investments, will demonstrate a return profile closer to a normal distribution, cannot be fully supported. Certainly, business angels have a higher proportion of investments that break-even or generate a modest return (IRR of $0-24\\%$ but, as already noted, their proportion of very successful investments (IRRs of $100\\%$ and over) is similar to that of venture capital funds. In other words, there is evidence from this study to suggest that business angels are capable of realising exceptional gains from their investments. The characteristics of these ‘high performing’ investments are considered in Section 8 of the paper.  \n\n### 6. Method of exit  \n\nIn most cases, a trade sale will be the only exit option available to business angels wishing to harvest a successful investment. Initial public offerings (IPOs) are restricted to the ^cream of the crop' (Bygrave and Timmons, 1992). Moreover, because of the high fixed costs involved in organising an IPO they are only practicable for larger companies that are able to justify a significant market capitalisation. Conversely, it is much easier to find a company that is willing to purchase —— sometimes at a high price —— smaller businesses for strategic reasons. In some circumstances trade buyers can be found for more modest performing investments and even distress sales. Bruno et al. (1992) have noted in the case of new technology ventures in Silicon Valley that unsuccessful firms can be attractive acquisitions for other companies because of their expertise and product lines. A trade sale also has an important advantage over an IPO, in that investors will normally be able to sell all of their shares (indeed, the buyer may insist upon $100\\%$ control) whereas in an IPO the market may construe an investor selling some or all of his/her shares as a negative signal (and indeed in many cases “lock-in’ agreements may be required to preclude exit by the existing shareholders within a specified period of time).  \n\nThe dominance of trade sales as the main way in which business angels harvest their investments is confirmed in this study. For those investments in which the shares had some value and so could be sold, the main exit routes were trade sales (31 exits) and sale to existing shareholders (19 exits) (Table 4). There were nine public listings. Nearly 4 out of 10 investments were written-off as having no value. This comprised almost all of the unsuccessful investments, suggesting that there is unlikely to be a market for shares in poorly performing small businesses. However, some business angels were able to exit from investments that were only breaking even.  \n\nTable 4 Methods of exit and investment performance   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Exit route</td><td colspan=\"6\">Return/IRR</td><td colspan=\"2\">Total</td></tr><tr><td>Negative</td><td>Break even</td><td>1-19</td><td>20-49</td><td>50-99</td><td>100+</td><td>Number</td><td>%</td></tr><tr><td>Flotation</td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>9</td><td>7.6</td></tr><tr><td>Trade sale (i.e., sale to another company)</td><td></td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>31</td><td>26.1</td></tr><tr><td>Sale of shares to existing shareholders</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td></td><td>19</td><td>16.0</td></tr><tr><td>Saleof shares tonew (third party) investor</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>12</td><td>10.1</td></tr><tr><td>Asset break-up</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td><td>0.8</td></tr><tr><td>Written-off</td><td>45</td><td>2</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>47</td><td>39.5</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>119</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Noinformation</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>(9)</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThe type of exit route is closely related to the performance of the investment. The best performing investments (IRR of $50\\%$ and more) were dominated by trade sales (17 out of 27 investments  with  an IRR  of $50\\%$ or more). However, trade sales were also used for investments with lower IRRs and even for investments that broke even. IPOs accounted for most of the remaining high-performance investments. Unlike trade sales, IPOs were almost exclusively restricted to high-performance investments. Sales to other shareholders or new third party investors have been predominantly used by investors to exit from poor and moderately performing —\\~ or “living dead’ — investments.  \n\n### 7. Length of holding period  \n\nThe median holding period of the investments was 4 years. This is identical to the holding period reported by Bygrave and Timmons (1992) in their study of US venture capital funds. However, the length of the holding period varies according to the performance of the investment (Fig. 2). The median holding period for investments that generated satisfactory $(\\mathrm{IRR}=25-49\\%)$ or exceptional $(\\mathrm{IRR}=50\\%+\\$ ) returns was 4 years whereas it was just 2 years for loss-making and break-even investments, where the exit generally took the form of the failure of the investee business (see Table 4). This provides confirmation of the venture capital adage that “lemons ripen before plums'.  \n\nInvestments that generate a low return $(\\mathrm{IRR}=1-24\\%)$ have the longest holding period (median of 6 years). Because such investments are performing poorly or moderately, business angels have limited prospects for achieving an exit and thus face an illiquidity risk. Consequently, investors are forced to hold on to such investments in the hope that either the performance will improve sufficiently for a successful exit to be made or someone willing to buy the shares emerges. As noted above, such investments are often ultimately sold to the existing shareholders in the business.  \n\n### 8. The characteristics of high-performing investments  \n\nFrom the preceding analysis it would appear that business angel investments are more commonly found in the high-performing categories (IRR of $50\\%$ and over) than would be expected on the basis of any of the hypotheses proposed. This section investigates the extent to which these investments are distinctive. From the data it is possible to examine four aspects of high-performing informal investments in the UK: stage of business development, technology, investment size (both original and follow-up), and coinvestor type. Attention here is focused on those investments harvested with an IRR of $50\\%$ or more. These investments comprise $23\\%$ of all exits. This threshold was chosen because it is typically the upper limit of the target rate of return sought by business angels (Wetzel, 1981, 1994; Mason and Harrison, 1994). However, in view of the small sample size $(n=30)$ ,and the consequent effect of this on the ability to test for statistical significance, the findings should be regarded as being tentative.  \n\n![](images/974df7f18f9eb7e7740e7bf78f12ef6dced87553a3ce7bd012e87e46e2395942.jpg)  \nFig. 2. Relationship between holding period and internal rates of return.  \n\nThe relationship between stage of investment and investment performance is complex. On the one hand, investment in later-stage deals is likely to involve lower risk of loss. Indeed, business angels anticipate a higher loss rate amongst seed and start-up investments (Mason and Harrison, 1994). On the other hand, investments in seed and start-up businesses offer the greatest potential for spectacular investment returns. Bygrave and Timmons (1992) have found that early-stage investments yield proportionately more big winners than later-stage investments. Our first hypothesis is therefore that early-stage investments will account for the greatest proportion of high-performing investments. However, the magnitude of variations in the number of seed, start-up, early stage, and established investments that are highperformance investments is quite small and the differences are not significant. Nevertheless, it is worth noting from Table 5 that investments in MBOs were the most likely to produce high-performing investments. This matches the experience of institutional investors in the UK where MBO-specialist funds have achieved the highest returns (Burgel, 2000). However, relatively few business angels invest in MBOs: these investments accounted for just $9\\%$ Of the exits examined in this study.  \n\nSecond, we hypothesise that investments in technology-based firms will be associated with superior performance. This is because of the capability for such firms to create new markets with significant growth potential. In the case of business angels, this study finds that technology investments do not significantly out-perform other investments (Table 6). Technology sectors account for $43\\%$ of high-performing investments compared with $36\\%$ of all exits, and almost $28\\%$ of technology exits were high performing, only marginally higher than the proportion for all investments. Indeed, there is no significant difference in the overall performance of technology and nontechnology investments (Mason and Harrison, 1999a). This demonstrates that good investment opportunities are not restricted to technology sectors.  \n\nThird, we hypothesise that high-performing investments will be larger investments. A number of studies identify a link between size of initial funding and business success (e.g. Cooper et al., 1994; Roberts, 1991). Larger investments allow more opportunities for an investor to stage the investment. This enables an investor both to reduce their downside risk in the event that the business performs poorly and also to increase their investment if the business performs well (Sahlman, 1988). In addition, as noted earlier, an investor who makes a small investment runs the risk that the rest of the funding package will not be raised or that their investment will be diluted as follow-on investors invest on more favourable terms (Murray, 1994; 1999).  \n\nTable5 The performance of investments by stage of investment   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Stage</td><td colspan=\"2\">High-performing exits</td><td colspan=\"2\">All exits</td><td rowspan=\"2\">High-performing exits as a % of all exits in the category</td></tr><tr><td>Number</td><td>%</td><td>Number</td><td>%</td></tr><tr><td>Seed</td><td>4</td><td>13.3</td><td>20</td><td>15.6</td><td>20.0</td></tr><tr><td>Start-up</td><td>6</td><td>20.0</td><td>30</td><td>23.4</td><td>20.0</td></tr><tr><td>Early stage</td><td>4</td><td>13.3</td><td>29</td><td>22.7</td><td>13.8</td></tr><tr><td>Establishedfirms</td><td>6</td><td>20.0</td><td>27</td><td>21.1</td><td>22.2</td></tr><tr><td>MBOs</td><td>8</td><td>26.7</td><td>11</td><td>8.6</td><td>72.7</td></tr><tr><td>MBIs</td><td>2</td><td>6.7</td><td>11</td><td>8.6</td><td>22.2</td></tr><tr><td>Allexits</td><td>30</td><td>100</td><td>128</td><td>100</td><td>23.4</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nChi-square test to compare number of high performing and other investments in each category is not significant $(\\mathrm{\\chi}^{2}=8.5\\mathrm{i})$  \n\nTable6 The performance of technology-based investments   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">High-performing exits</td><td colspan=\"2\">All exits</td><td rowspan=\"2\">High-performing exits as a % of all exits in the category</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Number</td><td>%</td><td>Number</td><td>%</td></tr><tr><td>Nontechnology</td><td>17</td><td>57</td><td>98</td><td>64</td><td>21.0</td></tr><tr><td>Technology-based</td><td>13</td><td>43</td><td>30</td><td>36</td><td>27.7</td></tr><tr><td>Allexits</td><td>30</td><td>100</td><td>128</td><td>100</td><td>23.4</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nChi-square test to compare number of high performing and other investments in each category is not significant $(\\mathrm{~x~}^{2}=3.8\\bar{4})$  \n\nThe relationship between investment size and high-performance investment is explored in three ways. First, there is no significant relationship between the amount invested by the business angel and the return on that investment, as indicated by exceptional performance (Table 7). The very largest investments (over f100,000 invested by the business angel) are more likely to be associated with high performance, and the very smallest investments (under f10,0o0) are less likely to be high performers; however, the relationship is uneven across size categories, with investments in the size range f50,000 to f99,000 the least likely of all to be high performing.  \n\nThe second measure of investment size is the total deal size. This takes into account both the amount invested by the respondents and also the investment of any coinvestors. Coinvestment is the  norm:  more  than  three-quarters $(77\\%)$ of  the  exits  had   other investors, and in $17\\%$ of these cases there was more than one coinvestor. Other business angels, investing either as part of a syndicate or independently of the respondent, were the most common type of coinvestor, involved in two-thirds of investments with coinvestors. Venture capital funds invested alongside respondents in $28\\%$ ofinvestments with coinvestors. The amounts involved were often substantial, particularly when several coinvestors were involved. The business angels who responded to the survey invested a total of f4.2 million in the 128 investments under consideration, while coinvestors invested f195million.  \n\nTable7 The performance of investments by size of initial investment by the business angel   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">High-performing exits</td><td colspan=\"2\">All exits</td><td rowspan=\"2\">High-performing exits as a % of all exits in the category</td></tr><tr><td>Amount (f000)</td><td>Number</td><td>%</td><td>Number</td><td>%</td></tr><tr><td>Lessthan10</td><td>10</td><td>33.3</td><td>48</td><td>37.5</td><td>20.8</td></tr><tr><td>10-24.9</td><td>7</td><td>23.3</td><td>26</td><td>20.3</td><td>26.9</td></tr><tr><td>25-49.9</td><td>5</td><td>16.7</td><td>21</td><td>16.4</td><td>23.8</td></tr><tr><td>50-99.9</td><td>4</td><td>13.3</td><td>23</td><td>18.0</td><td>17.4</td></tr><tr><td>100+</td><td>4</td><td>13.3</td><td>10</td><td>7.8</td><td>40.0</td></tr><tr><td>Allexits</td><td>30</td><td>100</td><td>128</td><td>100</td><td>23.4</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nChi-square test to compare number of high performing and other investments in each category is not significant $(\\mathrm{~x~}^{2}=0.27)$  \n\nTable8 The performance of investments by overall deal size (respondents and coinvestors)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">High-performing exits</td><td colspan=\"2\">All exits</td><td rowspan=\"2\">High-performing exits as a % of all exits in the category</td></tr><tr><td>Amount (f000)</td><td>Number</td><td>%</td><td>Number</td><td>%</td></tr><tr><td>Less than 10</td><td>1</td><td>3.3</td><td>16</td><td>12.5</td><td>6.2</td></tr><tr><td>10-24.9</td><td>4</td><td>13.3</td><td>12</td><td>9.4</td><td>33.3</td></tr><tr><td>25-49.9</td><td>4</td><td>13.3</td><td>15</td><td>11.7</td><td>26.7</td></tr><tr><td>50-99.9</td><td>3</td><td>10.0</td><td>20</td><td>15.6</td><td>15.0</td></tr><tr><td>100-249</td><td>6</td><td>20.0</td><td>27</td><td>21.1</td><td>22.2</td></tr><tr><td>250-499</td><td>2</td><td>6.7</td><td>11</td><td>8.6</td><td>18.2</td></tr><tr><td>500-999</td><td>5</td><td>16.7</td><td>8</td><td>6.2</td><td>62.5</td></tr><tr><td>1000-4999</td><td>4</td><td>13.3</td><td>11</td><td>8.6</td><td>57.1</td></tr><tr><td>5000+</td><td>1</td><td>3.3</td><td>8</td><td>6.2</td><td>14.3</td></tr><tr><td>Allexits</td><td>30</td><td>100</td><td>128</td><td>100</td><td>23.4</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nChi-square test to compare number of high performing and other investments in each category is not significant $(\\mathrm{~\\boldmath~\\chi~}^{2}=2.8)$  \n\nHere, again there is no significant relationship between deal size and high-performing investments when total deal size is considered (Table 8). Although deals of between f500,000 and f4.9 million are more likely to be associated with high-performing investments, with over half of the investments in this size class generating high returns, the association between large deal size and high performance does not extend to investments of f5 million and over. Moreover, smaller deals, involving investments of between f10,000 and f49,000 also have an above average share of high-performing investments.  \n\nLarger deals are more likely to involve one or more coinvestors. Although there is no relationship between total deal size and high-performing investments (Table 8) the effects of syndication need to be explored further. Syndication might be expected to reduce risk on account of the greater capacity for due diligence, and range of expertise amongst the coinvestors might be expected to result in a superior added value from their individual and joint hands on contributions. However, there is no significant difference between investments that involve a business angel investing alongside coinvestors and those that do not in terms of the number of high-performing investments $(\\mathrm{\\Upsilon}^{2}=0.75)$  \n\nIdentifying a relationship between high-performing investments and type of coinvestor is complicated because a number of investments have several coinvestors. Nevertheless, there is a significant difference between the type of coinvestor and the number of highperforming investments (Table 9). Three conclusions can be drawn. First, high-performing investments are associated with deals involving multiple investors (mainly involving coinvestment with both other business angels and other sources of finance, such as venture capital or banks). These are typically larger deals of f500,000 and over. This, in turn, suggests that the issue of the complementarity between informal venture capital and institutional venture capital\\* warrants further detailed study to uncover the performance dynamics of the relationship. Second, investments that only involve business angels (either investing on their own, as part of a syndicate or with other independent angels) have a significantly lower proportion of high-performance investments than those where business angels invested alongside institutional investors (e.g., venture capital funds, banks, public sector) $(\\mathrm{\\chi}^{2}=8.25$ ,significant at $P<.01$ ). Third, investments in which business angels have invested on their own performed no worse, in terms of the proportion of high-performance investments, than those in which they have invested with other business angels. This suggests that, contrary to most assumptions (e.g., Kelly and Hay, 1996), syndication is not in itself likely to improve the prospects of securing exceptional returns, and there is therefore no evidence from this study that syndication with other business angels improves the ability of the business angel investor to make better decisions and compensate for lack of sectoral or functional knowledge and expertise.  \n\nTable9 The performance of investments by coinvestor type   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Coinvestor</td><td colspan=\"2\">High-performing exits</td><td colspan=\"2\">All exits</td><td rowspan=\"2\">High-performing exits as a % of all exits in the category</td></tr><tr><td>Number</td><td>%</td><td>Number</td><td>%</td></tr><tr><td>None</td><td>5</td><td>16.6</td><td>29</td><td>22.7</td><td>17.2</td></tr><tr><td>Other private investors in syndicate</td><td>5</td><td>16.6</td><td>29</td><td>22.7</td><td>17.2</td></tr><tr><td>Otherprivate investors-independent</td><td>3</td><td>10.0</td><td>27</td><td>21.1</td><td>11.1</td></tr><tr><td>Venture capital funds</td><td>4</td><td>13.3</td><td>15</td><td>11.7</td><td>26.7</td></tr><tr><td>Other (banks, public sector)</td><td>2</td><td>6.7</td><td>10</td><td>8.6</td><td>20.0</td></tr><tr><td>Multiplecoinvestors</td><td>11</td><td>36.7</td><td>18</td><td>11.7</td><td>61.1</td></tr><tr><td>All exits</td><td>30</td><td>100</td><td>128</td><td>100</td><td>23.4</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nChi-square test to compare number of high performing and other investments in each category is significant at $P=.01$ $(\\Upsilon^{2}=17.68)$  \n\nThe third measure of investment size takes account of follow-on investment provided by the original investor (Table 10). The evidence is mixed. On the one hand, the number of highperformance investments is unrelated to the presence or absence of follow-on finance $\\mathrm{\\{\\chi}}^{2}=0.0003\\$ . However, the number of high-performance investments is significantly associated with the amount of follow-on investment. Investments involving follow-on investment of f1oo,0oo or more are more likely to be high performing than investments involving small amounts of follow-on finance, and investments with no follow-on financing. There are a number of ways in which this finding can be interpreted. First, it could be taken as confirming Murray's (1994, 1999) argument regarding the possible adverse performance implications in situations where investors are unable to provide additional finance to investee businesses after initial funding has been exhausted. Thus, the relation between follow-on finance and investment performance might be taken as confirming a point that was made in developing Hypothesis 1, that investment performance will be better where the investor has sufficiently ‘deep pockets’ to provide follow-on finance to support the growth and development of the investee business. Second, it could indicate that high-performing investments 'pull in’ additional funding from initial investors because the prospects of a good performance encourages further investment. Third, the relationship between high-performing investments and follow-on finance may reflect a risk-minimising investment style of business angels, involving an initial small investment, or the staging of a larger investment.  \n\nTable10 Investment performance and follow-on finance   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">High-performing exits</td><td colspan=\"2\">All exits</td><td rowspan=\"2\">High-performing exits as a % of all exits in the category</td></tr><tr><td>Follow-on finance (foo0)</td><td>Number</td><td>%</td><td>Number</td><td>%</td></tr><tr><td>None</td><td>22</td><td>73.3</td><td>94</td><td>73.4</td><td>23.4</td></tr><tr><td>Less than 10</td><td>0</td><td>一</td><td>7</td><td>5.5</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>10-49.9</td><td>1</td><td>3.3</td><td>5</td><td>3.9</td><td>20.0</td></tr><tr><td>50-99.9</td><td>0</td><td>一</td><td>8</td><td>6.2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>100-249.9</td><td>1</td><td>3.3</td><td>2</td><td>1.6</td><td>50.0</td></tr><tr><td>250-499.9</td><td>0</td><td>一</td><td>0</td><td>一</td><td>一</td></tr><tr><td>500-999.9</td><td>5</td><td>16.7</td><td>8</td><td>6.2</td><td>62.5</td></tr><tr><td>1000andover</td><td>1</td><td>3.3</td><td>4</td><td>3.1</td><td>25.0</td></tr><tr><td>Allexits</td><td>30</td><td>100</td><td>128</td><td>100</td><td>23.4</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nChi-square test to compare number of high performing and other investments in each category is significant at $P=.05$ $({\\bar{\\chi}}^{2}=8.5)$  \n\n## 9. Conclusion  \n\nThe performance of venture capital investments represents an underresearched aspect of the venture capital process. In particular, there is virtually no evidence available on the outcomes of investments made by business angels who play a key role in financing the startup and early growth stages of entrepreneurial businesses. This represents a significant gap in our knowledge and understanding of this important segment of the venture capital market.  \n\nHowever, in interpreting the findings, there are two important qualifications to make that suggest that it would be prudent to regard the findings reported here as being tentative until further studies become available. First, there are inherent difficulties in identifying business angels and in obtaining responses to surveys and it is impossible to test samples for their representativeness. Second, the results are based on an analysis of one national business angel market, and it is not clear whether the findings will hold in other countries. Nevertheless, the significance of this paper in “putting boundaries on our ignorance” (Wetzel, 1986, p. 131) should not be downplayed.  \n\nThe paper makes four important points about the performance of informal venture capital investments. First, the returns from such investments are negatively skewed. Almost half lost money or broke even in nominal terms and only $10\\%$ generated IRRs in excess of $100\\%$ Comparison with the returns profile of early-stage venture capital funds suggests that business angels have fewer investments that lose money, a higher proportion of poor or moderately performing investments and a similar proportion of high-performance investments. This is consistent with the view of Benjamin and Margulis (1996, p. 221) that business angels are more concerned with avoiding bad investments than “hitting a home run’ because of their limited ability to diversify. Nevertheless, business angels are capable of generating exceptional gains from their investments. This may reflect their superior ability in selecting and evaluating deals compared with venture capital fund managers, or it may be attributable to the greater ability of business angels to make value-added contributions to the development of their investee businesses. Second, trade sales are the main way in which business angels harvest their investments. Trade sales are used for both high-performing investments as well as those that have performed less well or only break even. IPOs are a much less common means of exit, and are confined to harvesting high-performance investments. Third, most angels hold on to their investments for a relatively short time period, with a median length of holding for successful investments of just 4 years. Finally, although the study is unable to provide a recipe for successful investing, it does suggest that MBOs, large deals involving multiple coinvestors and deals involving large amounts of follow-on investment are the most likely to generate very high returns (IRR of $50\\%$ and above). However, by no means did every high-performing investment have these characteristics.  \n\nThese findings have important implications for policy-makers. The need to improve the availability of risk capital in Europe has been recognised by national governments and at the European level (Commission, 1997; Aernoudt, 1999): evidence on risk and reward can inform judgements on the necessity and form of supply-side measures such as tax reliefs and equity guarantee schemes as means of boosting the supply of informal venture capital. The significance of the study for UK policy-makers is that the findings support the recent moves to reduce the rate of CGT for investors in unlisted companies. In an attempt to encourage investment by business angels in unquoted companies, the 1998 Finance Act introduced a CGT taper on business assets that reduced the amount of capital gain that is charged to tax on the disposal of an asset over a 10-year period. The effect was to reduce the taxable gain from $100\\%$ if the asset had been held for less than 1 year to $25\\%$ if held for 10 years, effectively reducing the rate of tax for a higher rate taxpayer from $40\\%$ to $10\\%$ . On the evidence of this study, which found a 4-year average holding period for successful investments, few business angels would be likely to benefit significantly from this change. Moreover, in order to benefit from the taper outside investors were required to own at least $25\\%$ of the voting rights, which is out of line with the typical shareholding structure of a business angel investment (Mason and Harrison, $1999\\mathrm{c},$ . This requirement also hinders business angel syndicates that operate on the basis of the members of the syndicate investing on an individual basis. However, following a consultation exercise (Inland Revenue, 2000), the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the March 2ooo Budget changes to make the CGT taper for business assets more generous. First, the taper will be reduced from 10 to 4 years, the effect of which is that higher rate tax payers will pay tax at $20\\%$ after 3 years and $10\\%$ after 4 years. Second, the $25\\%$ threshold will be eliminated. These changes are much more consistent with both the time horizon over which business angels typically invest and the typical size of their shareholding.  \n\nAlthough these changes to CGT are undoubtedly positive, and will be welcomed by the business angel community, it is clear from the evidence presented here that the risks outweigh the rewards for business angels. The proportion of investments generating zero or negative returns exceeds those which return a significant multiple on the original investment, hence many business angels will not benefit from the CGT taper because their investments have not produced a capital gain. This suggests that stimulating the supply of informal venture capital may need a richer cocktail of tax incentives than merely a reduction in CGT, including frontend tax reliefs1° (Mason and Harrison, 2000) and even venture capital guarantees (Gavron et al., 1998; Lumme et al., 1998).  \n\n# Acknowledgments  \n\nWe are pleased to acknowledge the support of the Small Firms Policy Branch of the UK's Department of Trade and Industry in funding the survey of business angels upon which this paper is based.

Masulis and Rajarishi Nahata\\*  \n\n## Abstract  \n\nWe analyze the effects of venture capital (VC) backing on profitability of private firm acquisitions. We find that VC backing leads to significantly higher acquirer announcement returns,averaging $3\\%$ , even after controlling for deal characteristics and endogeneity of venture funding. This leads us to investigate whether some VCs have interests that conflict with those of other investors. We show that such conflicts arise from VCs having financial relationships with both acquirers and targets, corporate VCs having a dominant strategic focus, and VC funds nearing maturity experiencing pressure to liquidate. Our conclusions follow from examinations of target takeover premia and acquirer announcement returns.  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nEarly agency theory research concentrated on conflicts of interest across debt and equity security classes. More recent work has begun to explore the conflicts of interest among investors within major classes of securities. Researchers have studied conflicts of interest among debt holders of different seniority or maturities, especially around periods of financial distress, and also among equity investors, such as majority and minority shareholders or holders of superior and inferior classes of stock.1 In more recent work, Harford, Jenter, and Li (2008), Bodnaruk,  \n\nMassa, and Simonov (2008), and Matvos and Ostrovsky (2008) explore conflicts of interest in mergers and acquisitions (M&As) that arise among institutional shareholders, when some institutional investors hold shares in both bidders and targets. In this study we extend this line of research by exploring the conflicts of interest that exist among equity investors in privately held venture-backed companies, and in particular the conflicts of interest that arise in acquisitions of these firms. We investigate how conflicts among venture capitalists (VCs) and other investors affect acquisition profitability and target purchase prices.  \n\nInvestigating the generally higher announcement effects observed in acquisitions of private firms relative to those in public firm acquisitions, we first show that acquirers of VC-backed private firms realize a higher mean announcement return than acquirers of non-VC-backed private firms. This finding, which is statistically and economically significant, continues to hold after controlling for both the acquisition financing choice and the endogeneity of VC backing. Given the body of evidence that VCs certify the quality of their portfolio firms around initial public offerings (IPOs) by reducing the information asymmetry faced by IPO investors, this is an intriguing result.? Similarly, if VCs reduce the information asymmetry faced by acquirers of private firms, then we would expect to observe higher purchase prices and thus, lower acquirer announcement returns. Yet, the empirical evidence we uncover runs counter to this VC certification hypothesis. This finding is especially surprising since VCs’ extensive contacts with potential buyers should result in more competitive bidding and hence lower acquirer announcement effects.  \n\nThe higher acquirer announcement returns associated with VC-backed targets lead us to examine the importance of an alternative set of hypotheses that focus on the possible conficts of interest between VCs and other target investors, including entrepreneurs. To complement our investigation, we also examine target purchase prices relative to the book values of target assets, a measure of the premium paid by acquirers above target book values. We also refer to this measure as the “\"takeover premium\"3 Three VC conficts of interest are examined, each associated with a particular class of VC investors.  \n\nTo briefly preview our results, first we find that targets backed by VC funds closer to liquidation receive significantly lower takeover premia. This is consistent with VC funds closer to maturity exerting substantial pressure on target management to accept lower sale prices so as to ensure a profitable exit in a timely manner. Also, acquisition of targets backed by VC funds closer to liquidation lead to slightly higher acquirer returns, although the difference is not statistically significant.  \n\nSecond, we find strong support for self-dealing behavior by a particular class of VCs. Specifically, acquisitions of targets backed by VC firms with direct financial ties to acquirers exhibit significantly higher acquirer announcement returns, and this announcement effect increases with VC shareholdings in acquiring firms. Furthermore, when such relationships exist, target takeover premia are on average significantly lower. This evidence is consistent with a VC conflict of interest with other portfolio company investors, which compromises a VC's incentives to support aggressive target negotiations to obtain a higher acquisition price.  \n\nThird, we show that acquisitions of corporate VC- (CVC-) backed targets lead to significantly higher acquirer announcement returns relative to traditional VC- (TVC-) backed targets. This result is consistent with CVC principals having weaker financial incentives, which makes them more risk averse and more anxious to exit their investments. It is also consistent with CVCs having dual objectives due to their parent corporations’ strategic goals, such as rapid commercialization of complementary target products that financially benefit CVC parents. Either of these motives emanating from a CVC strategic focus leads to increased CVC pressure on their portfolio companies to sell out to interested acquirers. In summary, we document a large body of evidence that is consistent with a range of VCs having conflicts of interest with entrepreneurs and other portfolio company investors. These conflicts appear to enhance acquirer profitability and reduce target shareholder gains.  \n\nThe contributions of this study are 4-fold. First, it is well known that VCs generally realize higher returns on their investments when their portfolio companies either undertake IPOs or are acquired. However, the extant literature has largely focused on the IPO exit, which on average occurs in about $10\\%$ of VC investments, whereas acquisitions of portfolio companies comprise approximately $20\\%$ of VC investments.4 We help fil this gap by studying acquisitions of VCbacked private firms in the U.S. Second, we shed new light on the private firm acquisition market, which in recent years represents nearly $70\\%$ of total U.S. acquisition activity (Source: Securities Data Company (SDC) Platinum's M&A Database). Third, after controlling for the endogeneity in venture funding, we document that purchases of VC-backed companies are associated with significantly higher acquirer announcement returns relative to purchases of similar non-VCbacked firms. Fourth, we analyze several conflicts of interest between VCs and other private firm investors and test for their effects on acquisition profitability and pricing. Consistent with a number of VC conflicts of interest, we uncover distinctly different acquirer and target wealth effects, conditional on the characteristics of VC investors involved. Our findings thus add to the literature examining conflicts of interest among investors and financial intermediaries.  \n\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II gives a brief background of the literature and develops testable hypotheses. Section MI describes the sample selection criteria and the matching technique, and presents descriptive statistics contrasting VC-backed and non-VC-backed targets. Multivariate analysis of cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) to the acquirers of VCbacked and non-VC-backed targets follows in Section IV. Section V details a more in-depth investigation of VC-specific characteristics of venture-backed targets and presents a further analysis explaining the higher acquirer announcement returns associated with these acquisitions. Section VI describes various robustness analyses.SectionVlI concludes.  \n\n## Il. Background and Hypotheses  \n\nOur primary objective is to investigate the potential conficts of interest among VCs and other investors when privately held firms are acquired. While a number of studies investigate the impact of VCs on the IPO process, and report evidence of certification benefits and occasionally of agency costs (Gompers (1996), Lee and Wahal (2004)), a similar analysis of VC impacts on acquisitions of privately held firms is lacking. This is an important omission given that acquisitions are twice as likely to occur as IPOs. Furthermore, while IPOs are generally viewed as the most profitable VC exit, acquisitions can also be very profitable, and can be the only profitable exits in periods when the IPO market is weak or effectively closed. The impact of VCs on the acquisition process is especially interesting because VCs serve an important role as monitors of private firms that generally lack detailed and reliable financial information.  \n\nAs financial information producers, VCs can help raise the purchase prices these target firms receive by certifying their quality. On the other hand, VC investors face divergent incentives from other private firm investors as explained below, which can create conflicts of interest and lead to significantly lower acquisition prices paid to target firm owners. This is a particular concern given that VCs generally have strong control rights in their portfolio firms. Which of these 2 effects dominates is an important unanswered question that we explore in depth by differentiating among several categories of VC investors and analyzing how their differing incentives affect acquisition profitability and target purchase prices.  \n\nOur study is primarily related to a large literature examining conflicts of interest among financial intermediaries and investors. Early agency theory research concentrated on conflicts of interest across debt and equity security classes. More recent work has begun to explore the conflicts of interest among investors within major classes of securities. Researchers have studied conflicts of interest among debt holders of different seniority or maturities, especially around periods of financial distress, and also among equity investors, such as majority and minority shareholders or holders of superior and inferior classes of stock. For example,  \n\nGilson, John, and Lang (1990), Ayotte and Morrison (2008), and Brunner and Krahnen (2008) present empirical evidence of conflicts of interest among distressed firm creditors, and Hotchkiss and Mooradian (1997) provide some examples of purported “bondmail,” a tactic to seek control of strategic blocks of bonds so as to obtain better deal terms in corporate restructurings at the expense of other claimants. In a slightly different vein, Asquith, Gertner, and Scharfstein (1994) and Welch (1997) analyze conflicts among creditors in the presence of bank debt. Hotchkiss, John, Mooradian, and Thorburn (2008) provide a survey of the extensive research that analyzes conflicts of interest arising from the presence of multiple creditors and multiple layers of debt.  \n\nRecent evidence on conflicts among shareholders is provided by Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick (2010) and Masulis, Wang, and Xie (2009), who analyze conflicts of interest between holders of superior voting shares and inferior voting shares in dual class firms. An extensive survey on corporate governance research by Shleifer and Vishny (1997) also provides an analysis of conflicts of interest among shareholders, focusing particular attention on majority and minority stockholders. In a related M&A setting, Harford et al. (2008), Bodnaruk et al. (2008), and Matvos and Ostrovsky (2008) explore conflicts of interest among institutional shareholders when institutional investors hold shares in both bidders and targets.  \n\nMatvos and Ostrovsky (2008) show that most institutional shareholders of acquiring companies do not lose money around acquisition announcements because they frequently own shares in targets, which realize sizable takeover premia. While Bodnaruk et al. (2008) show that bidder advisors often have (and take new) equity positions in target firms, which directly affect the outcomes of the proposed deals, Harford et al. (2008) find no appreciable effect of cross-holdings on acquirer bidding strategies. These studies focus on public acquisitions, whereas we explore the differences among equity investors in privately held venture-backed companies and focus on the conflicts of interest that arise around their acquisitions. We investigate how conflicts among VCs and other investors affect acquisition profitability and target purchase prices. Three VC conflicts of interest are examined, each associated with a particular class of VC investors.  \n\nFirst, VCs face increased liquidity pressure to exit investments as their funds mature. This refects a VC fund's fixed capital level, fixed maturity date, and the required payout of all realized proceeds from prior investments to receive favorable tax treatment, which precludes reinvestment of realized profits into the fund's remaining portfolio companies. These requirements imply that over time a VC fund has less capital to support the continuing financing needs of its remaining portfolio firms, while facing growing pressure to exit from its remaining investments. This effect is reinforced by VC incentives to liquidate their investments earlier to lower their high cost of capital and realize higher internal rates of return (IRR), which is how their investment returns are generally evaluated. Thus, VCs in more mature funds nearing liquidation can experience greater incentives to complete acquisitions to eliminate any further funding needs of these portfolio firms and exit from their illiquid investments. This liquidity pressure can lead VCs to pressure target managers to sell their firms more quickly, even at the cost of a lower purchase price. Since acquirers are aware of these pressures, they are likely to lower their bids accordingly, enabling acquirer stockholders to realize higher acquisition gains. This yields the prediction that liquidity pressure on maturing VC funds leads to lower target purchase prices and higher acquirer announcement returns. In contrast, targets backed by younger funds facing less liquidity pressure should realize higher acquisition prices and lower acquirer announcement returns. We label this H1: the “VC liquidity” hypothesis.  \n\nSecond, because of extensive syndication of investments (Lerner (1994a)), VCs develop widespread professional and social networks encompassing other VCs, public and private companies, commercial and investment banks, auditors, lawyers, etc. In addition to the beneficial impact of VC connections for the development of their portfolio companies (Lindsey (2008), Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu (2007)), an extensive network of private equity contacts can be very helpful in locating potential acquirers. However, a self-dealing problem can arise when a VC has financial relationships with both acquirer and target firms. This is especially worrisome because VCs typically have strong control rights in their portfolio companies relative to cash fow rights, which enables them to pressure the management to acquiesce to the terms of an acquisition offer. Since an acquirer is made financially better off by a lower purchase price, and a typical VC holds a small fraction of its portfolio company's equity, a conflicted VC can realize financial gains by supporting an acquirer in negotiations with its portfolio company, even though the VC realizes a lower gain on its target investment. This situation can cause a VC to pressure its portfolio firms to sell more quickly, thereby undermining target managements’ efforts to realize higher purchase prices. Obviously, a potential acquirer is likely to lower its bid and negotiate more aggressively when a VC has a dual financial relationship. It follows then that a financial relationship between a VC and an acquirer lowers the expected target purchase price and raises the expected acquirer announcement return. We call this H2: the “\"VC self-dealing\"hypothesis.  \n\nThird, we consider the distinct investment objectives of CVCs, observing that CVCs have both strategic and financial goals. In a survey of CVCs, Yost and Devlin (1993) report that $93\\%$ of respondents considered realizing strategic benefits a major goal of their investment decisions and achieving synergies with their parents’ core businesses as their prime objective. Gompers and Lerner (200o) also note that CVCs often make venture investments to understand or acquire new technologies and to nurture rapid commercialization of products and technologies complementary to those of its corporate parents. The pursuit of twin investment objectives by CVCs creates conflicts of interest with other portfolio company investors such as TVCs, who invest primarily to reap direct financial benefits. Thus, while corporate venture investments add strategic value to their parent corporations, CVCs generally have strong incentives to support acquisitions of their portfolio companies, which may not maximize the CVC's financial returns from these investments. For example, CVCs can favor acquisition bids by firms that have complementary products to CVC parents, even when the bids are relatively low. The strategic and technological relationships between a CVC parent and a target firm are also likely to diminish the interest of other potential acquirers. This can adversely affect the likelihood of competitive bidding, leading to discounted prices offered by bidders relative to other VC-backed target firms.  \n\nThe performance of CvC managers is often measured on multiple dimensions and not simply on the financial returns they generate for their parent corporations. Moreover, CVC managers often receive lower performance-based compensation than TVC general partners (Dushnitsky and Shapira (2008)). One stylized fact about CVCs is that their managers are often not rewarded in the same fashion as TVCs, particularly in the case of success, while failure leads to disproportionate financial penalties. Furthermore, CVCs are often subject to parent-specific concerns such as weakening corporate performance, top management turnover, shifts in strategic objectives, and unexpected shocks to the corporate parent's economic outlook.6 Thus, due to weaker CVC financial incentives, and because many CVCs are controlled by more risk-averse parent corporations compared to TVCs, CVC managers are more apt to support less aggressive acquisition negotiations if this can reduce the expected duration of the negotiation process and increase the probability of a successful transaction.' Conflicts with other target investors can also arise when corporate parents compete with target firms or want to absorb the targets into themselves at less than their market values. Acquirer awareness of these conflicts, which are rooted in a CVC's strategic objectives, is likely to lead them to negotiate more aggressively, which can translate into lower target purchase prices and higher acquirer announcement returns. We label these incentive effects H3: the “CVC strategic focus\" hypothesis.  \n\nA key property of VCs that reinforces the importance of these potential VC conflicts of interest is that VCs typically have strong control rights in their portfolio companies (Kaplan and Stromberg (2003)). In fact, VCs generally demand and receive disproportionately large control rights relative to their cash flow rights, and they receive senior equity claims in the form of convertible preferred stock. In addition, VCs generally have board seats, rights to approve outside board members, approval rights for major portfolio firm decisions, and rights to force the repurchase of their shares. Moreover, VCs make investments over multiple rounds, which are often critical to the continued survival and growth of early stage firms. Thus, VCs typically have strong control rights and leverage over their portfolio firms, which can allow them to put strong pressure on management to sell their firms and can affect the terms under which these sales occur. This exacerbates the VC conflicts of interest with other private firm investors. The conflicts of interest that we examine are different from the types of conflicts represented in lawsuits filed against VCs analyzed by Atanasov, Ivanov, and Litvak (2008), but are similar to some of the conflicts examined by Bartlett (2006).  \n\nIll. Data, Sample Selection, and Descriptive Statistics  \n\nA.Data  \n\nWe obtain a sample of completed acquisitions involving domestic private targets for whom initial bids were announced between January 1, 1991 and December 31, 2006, from Thomson Financial's M&A and VentureXpert databases. To be included in the sample, the following conditions must be satisfied:  \n\ni) Acquirers are U.S. headquartered, and their stock is publicly listed on the AMEX, NASDAQ, or NYSE.   \nii) The target is a privately held U.S. incorporated company.   \niii) Neither acquirer nor target is a regulated utility or a financial institution.   \niv) An acquisition must be completed, the buyer has no publicly known toehold position prior to the deal announcement, and the buyer acquires $100\\%$ of target firm shares.   \nV) The target purchase price is at least $\\$1,000,000$ , and the relative deal size (target purchase price divided by acquirer equity market value 1 month prior to the deal announcement) is at least $10\\%$   \nvi) Acquirer stock returns are available in the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) database, and its daily returns are available for the 5 trading days surrounding the acquisition announcement date (event days $^{-2}$ to 2).   \nvii) Acquirer stock prices must be at least $\\$2$ as of the acquisition announcement date (event day 0).   \nii) VC-backed targets must have information available on the investment positions of 1 or more of their VC investors.   \nix) Clustered acquisitions (of 2 or more) by a single acquirer within 5 days are excluded.  \n\nIn our analysis we exclude acquisitions of subsidiaries and public firms, since our primary interest is in analyzing the impact of VC backing on acquisitions of private companies. According to the VentureXpert database, in the 1991-2006 period more than $97\\%$ of acquisitions of privately held VC-backed targets involve acquirers purchasing $100\\%$ of a target's equity where no prior toeholds existed. Since market anticipation can reduce observed announcement effects, we exclude toeholds from our sample to minimize the anticipatory effects on acquisition wealth gains (or losses). Acharya (1988), (1993) and Eckbo, Maksimovic, and Williams (1990) argue that it is the unexpected portion of a news release that should determine the stock price reaction to an event. Thus, we exclude partial acquisitions because the economic benefits of these acquisitions are more difficult to determine given the high level of market anticipation.  \n\nEstimating bidder announcement returns presents several difficulties (see Eckbo et al. (1990) for further details). In particular, targets may be small relative to buyer equity values, so even very profitable acquisitions can have little impact on buyer stock prices. To raise the signal-to-noise ratio and enable the announcement effects to be measured more accurately, we require a minimum relative deal size of at least $10\\%$ 8 We exclude acquisitions by a single bidder closely clustered in calendar time, since we cannot isolate the announcement effects of individual acquisitions. To limit bid-ask bias in announcement period abnormal returns, we also exclude deals where an acquirer's stock price is below $\\$2$ (the results remain unchanged if we impose a $\\$5$ stock price requirement). These sample criteria result in a VC-backed target sample of 337 completed deals and a non-VC-backed sample of 2,452 completed deals.  \n\nTable 1 reports descriptive statistics for our acquisition samples of VC-backed and non-VC-backed target firms. Panel A reports the differences in firm characteristics across the 2 acquisition samples using a standard $t$ -test for a difference in means as well as a Wilcoxon test for difference in medians. In general, VCbacked targets are twice as large as non-VC-backed targets, and the difference is statistically significant at the $1\\%$ level. A similar pattern is observed for acquirers as well; the mean (median) size of acquirers of VC-backed targets is $\\$715$ $(\\$208)$ million, which is significantly larger than the mean (median) size of acquirers for non-VC-backed targets of $\\$345$ $(\\$102)$ million. This indicates that targets and their acquirers are substantially different across the 2 samples.  \n\nPanel B of Table 1 reports the frequency of acquisition financing methods for the 2 samples. Acquisitions of VC-backed targets are predominantly $(76\\%)$ financed with stock or a mixture of cash and stock. In contrast, only $49\\%$ ofnonVC-backed acquisitions involve stock as the acquisition currency. As reported in Panel C, nearly $72\\%$ of VC-backed targets belong to technology-intensive industries such as biological products, pharmaceuticals, genetics, high-technology communications, communication services, software services, electronic equipment, and computers. In stark contrast, only $31\\%$ of non-VC-backed targets are in the technology-intensive sectors. Thus, deals involving VC-backed targets have substantially different properties from other private firm acquisitions in terms of target and acquirer size, type of financing, and industries. This raises some important concerns about selection bias that need to be addressed in any statistical analysis.  \n\nPanel D of Table 1 reports mean and median CARs for the entire sample of acquisitions of privately held firms and the subsamples of VC-backed and non-VC-backed targets. We observe that the CARs involving acquisitions of VCbacked targets are significantly larger than when the targets have no VC backing. This is a surprising result that appears to contradict the VC certification hypothesis. However, this finding could reflect major differences in deal characteristics between the 2 samples. It is also important to observe that the average profitability of acquisitions of targets without VC backing continues to be positive and  \n\nThe acquisition sample period is 1991-2006. Acquisitions must have a relative deal size (deal size divided by acquirer's market value of equity 1 month prior to the acquisition announcement) of at least $10\\%$ PanelsA-Dof Table1compare VC-backed to non-VC-backed targets. Acquirer size is measured by the market value of acquirer equity 1 month prior to acquisition announcement. Target size is the price paid for acquisition of the target. High-technology industries are classified as belonging to SIC codes 283 (biological products, genetics, and pharmaceuticals), 481 (high-technology communications),365-369 (electronic equipment),482-489(communication services),357(computers),and 737(software services).

However, the average profitability is much smaller than that for VC-backed acquisitions. The average positive announcement return for acquirers buying private targets is consistent with prior research by Moeller, Schlingemann, and Stulz (2004), (2007), Officer, Poulsen, and Stegemoller (2009), Faccio, McConnell, and Stolin (2006), Fuller, Netter, and Stegemoller (2002), Chang (1998), and Hansen and Lott (1996).  \n\n### B. Sample Matching and Selection  \n\nTo better evaluate the profitability of VC-backed acquisitions, we create a comparable sample of non- VC-backed acquisitions using propensity score matching on multiple deal characteristics. In this approach, propensity scores are used to select “control\" units that are most like the “treatment\" units across a variety of characteristics considered important to the analysis (Dehejia and Wahba (2002)). The “treatment’ and “control\" units for the purpose of this analysis and the subsequent discussion are VC-backed and non-VC-backed targets, respectively. A notable feature of the method is that once the samples are matched, the remaining unmatched comparison sample is discarded, and is not directly used in estimating the treatment impact. The more comparable the 2 samples are across the relevant characteristics, the less biased are the estimates based on ordinary least squares (OLS) or 2-stage least squares estimation. Given the need to control for several characteristics, the propensity score matching method has attractive properties for selecting the most relevant comparison group based on multiple characteristics and is employed in several recent studies in corporate finance. For example, Lee and Wahal (2004) examine the role VC backing plays in the underpricing of IPOs. They use propensity score matching to control for endogeneity in the receipt of venture funding and find that VC-backed IPOs experience larger first-day returns than comparable nonventure-backed IPOs. Hogan and Lewis (2005), Lee and Masulis (2011), Li and Zhao (2006), and Villalonga (2004) also apply propensity score matching in their recent studies.  \n\nWe use a propensity score matching method, since acquisitions of VC-backed targets are likely to have characteristics atypical of the population of private firm acquisitions. For example, VCs concentrate their investments in firms with high growth potential, and they seek to exit from their investment within 3-5 years, ideally ending with an IPO or an acquisition. Among different propensity score matching techniques, we use the nearest-neighbor method because it allows us to exclude observations with certain deal characteristics that may bias or induce spurious results. For instance, we exclude deals where the acquirer makes other contemporaneous major announcements within the event period that could otherwise contaminate the acquisition announcement effect. Thus, to obtain an uncontaminated matched control sample of acquisition announcements, nearest-neighbor propensity score matching is required.  \n\nAlternative propensity score matching approaches often use the full sample of control firms to estimate treatment effects, such as Heckman, Ichimura, and Todd's (1997) kernel-based matching estimator. The Heckman (1979) 2-stage model also uses the full set of control firms, but these full sample approaches can result in biased estimates of treatment impacts when noncomparable control firms are included. The extent of this bias depends on the comparability of \"treatment’ and “control\" firms. Of course these approaches have the advantage of using much larger samples of events. Encouragingly, our results are robust to using the Heckman selection model, which uses the population of non-VCbacked private firm acquisitions for our sample period, including acquisition announcements contaminated by other nearby major firm-specific news events (see SectionVI).  \n\nThe first step in propensity score matching is to estimate a logistic regression predicting whether a deal involves a VC-backed or a non-VC-backed target. The dependent variable is equal to 1 if the target is VC backed, and is O otherwise. The explanatory variables used in the matching criteria are: a high-technology indicator (software services, electronic equipment, computers, communication services, high-technology communications, biological products, pharmaceuticals, and genetics are classified as high-technology industries), a method-of-payment indicator (common stock as acquisition currency), deal size (target purchase price) and relative deal size (target purchase price divided by acquirer's equity capitalization).  \n\nThe high-technology indicator controls for important industry patterns in VC investing, since VCs focus largely on technology-rich firms in selective industries. The method-of-payment indicator controls for the fact that bidder announcement returns in acquisitions of privately held firms are on average higher when they are stock financed. Chang (1998) reports that announcements of stock-financed acquisitions of private companies generate positive acquirer stock returns as favorable information about acquirer stock values can be inferred when targets accept acquirer stock as M&A consideration after their due diligence investigations. Chang (1998) and Barclay, Holderness, and Sheehan (2007) also argue that the creation of active block holdings can lead to improved firm valuation, since concentrated equity owners have stronger incentives to carefully monitor and take action against ineffective management. In a similar vein, Hertzel and Smith (1993) report a positive stock price reaction averaging $4.4\\%$ to announcements of private placements of stock, which they argue reflects favorable inside information about these firms. Inclusion of deal size ensures that target firms are matched as closely as possible in terms of their purchase prices. Finally, relative deal size attempts to account for the impact of a target's relative size and the economic significance of the acquisition on the acquirer share value. Fuller et al. (2002) document a significant positive relation between relative deal size and acquirer announcement returns. Taken together, the deal size and relative deal size also account for the size of the acquiring firm, which significantly affects acquirer returns (Moeller et al. (2004)).  \n\nWe estimate a logistic model predicting whether a deal involves a VC-backed or a non-VC-backed target. The estimated likelihood based on the sample of acquisitions of all VC-backed and non-VC-backed targets is as follows, where $p$ -values are reported in parentheses:  \n\nProb. (Acquisition of a VC-Backed Target) $=$ $-3.2379+1.2057$ (High-Tech) + 0.9202 (Stock) + 0.0005 (Deal Size) (<0.01）(<0.01) $\\left(<0.01\\right)$ $\\left(<0.01\\right)$ -0.0345 (Relative Deal Size). (0.64)  \n\nThe results indicate that deals involving VC-backed targets are likely to be larger in size and to come from technology-intensive industries. VC-backed targets are also more likely to use stock financing, which may be capturing an added nonlinear target size effect, since the frequency of stock financing rises with target size. On the other hand, relative deal size is insignificantly different across the 2samples.  \n\nTo match the “treatment’ and “control’ samples of acquisitions, we first estimate the propensity scores for deals involving VC-backed and non-VC-backed targets. The propensity scores are derived from the logistic model estimates combined with each deal's 4 regressor values. Next, we stratify all targets into blocks defined by quantiles (e.g., quartiles or deciles) of the propensity score distribution, and perform balancing tests for each variable specified in the logistic regression model as well as for the propensity scores themselves. These balancing tests are based on differences in means $t$ -tests between VC-backed and non-VC-backed targets within each block.  \n\nIf all blocks are well balanced (i.e., the $t$ -tests are not significant), then the algorithm ends. If a block is not well balanced, then it can be divided into finer blocks and the process is repeated. In our analysis of the balancing tests, the resultant 6 blocks are all well balanced, which ensures that even though both groups of targets are different in a number of characteristics, they are comparable within the defined blocks. After balancing the blocks, we rank all targets in each block (in both the samples) based on their propensity scores. Finally, for each \"treatment’ observation, we seek the nearest match from the “control’ sample without replacement based on the following 3 criteria:  \n\ni)  No evidence of confounding major news announcements (earnings, dividends, strategic alliances, stock splits, etc.) by the acquirer in the 5-day trading period (event days $^{-2}$ though 2) surrounding the announcement date of acquisition of the target firm.   \nii) Industry matching based on 3-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes if possible, otherwise by 2-digit SIC codes (if 3-digit SIC codes do not match), and finally by single-digit SIC codes (when both 3- and 2-digit SIC code matches are unavailable).9   \nii) Choose the minimal absolute difference in propensity scores of \"treatment'\" and “control firms.  \n\nAfter eliminating contaminated acquisition announcements and matching VCbacked and non-VC-backed targets, our data set consists of 245 completed deals in each of the 2 samples.  \n\nAs an additional robustness check, we adjust for potential self-selection using a Heckman (1979) 2-step procedure. Our qualitative results remain robust, as explained in more detail in Section VI. A major limitation of analyzing the entire sample of 2,452 non- VC-backed targets is that data on target takeover premia (target purchase price to book value), which enable us to analyze the impact of VC backing from the target's perspective, are not available in the SDC databases for a large majority of cases. By matching VC-backed and non-VC-backed targets following Dehejia and Wahba (2002), we are able to hand-collect the target-specific financial data from SEC filings for this smaller matched sample. Thus, we primarily report all our analyses for matched samples that are an outcome of the propensity score matching technique.  \n\n### C. Descriptive Statistics  \n\nTable 2 lists the number of VC-backed and non-VC-backed targets in our matched sample by industry groups. As noted earlier, over $71\\%$ ofVC-backed targets belong to technology-intensive industries. Propensity score matching across both industry and technology-intensive sectors appear to produce reasonable matches, since nearly $70\\%$ of non- VC-backed targets are also drawn from technology-intensivesectors.  \n\n# TABLE 2  \n\n# Acquisitions by Industry for VC-Backed Targets and a Matched Sample  \n\nThe sample period is 1991-2006.

In general, VC-backed targets and their acquirers are slightly larger in size, and so is the relative deal size of VC-backed targets. However, the differences in all 3 characteristics are statistically insignificant. We conclude that the matches are relatively close, though imperfect. As a consequence, we also control for all these characteristics in our multivariate analysis.  \n\nPanel A of Table 3 also reports basic financial information on the pairs of acquisitions. Since all of our targets are privately held, we find that only $40\\%$ of the targets have the required data available from the standard publicly available databases. To expand our sample of targets, we hand-collect target total assets from SEC filings. As a result, we obtain total assets for nearly $90\\%$ ofour sample of target firms. The distributions are quite skewed, with large variability; hence, both means and medians are reported for each of the 2 target samples.

Propensity score matching is undertaken across the following deal characteristics: deal size, method of payment, relative deal size, and target technology Sstatus.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">VC-Backed Targets</td><td colspan=\"2\">Non-VC- Backed Targets</td><td colspan=\"2\">Tests of Equality (p-values)</td></tr><tr><td>PanelA.AcquisitionCharacteristicsforVC-BackedTargetsandaMatchedSample</td><td>Mean</td><td>Median</td><td>Mean</td><td>Median</td><td>Mean</td><td>Median</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"7\"></td></tr><tr><td>Acquirer size ($M)</td><td>759</td><td>253</td><td>602</td><td>234</td><td>0.20</td><td>0.37</td></tr><tr><td>Target size ($M)</td><td>175</td><td>68</td><td>154</td><td>58</td><td>0.48</td><td>0.18</td></tr><tr><td>Targetsizerelativetoacquirersize</td><td>0.40</td><td>0.23 12.58</td><td>0.36 51.00</td><td>0.21 11.26</td><td>0.26</td><td>0.52</td></tr><tr><td>Target total assets(bookvaluein$M) Target takeoverpremium(purchasepricetobookvalue)</td><td>28.81</td><td></td><td></td><td>3.95</td><td>0.17</td><td>0.70</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>17.03</td><td>4.69</td><td>20.58</td><td></td><td>0.55</td><td>0.37</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">VC-Backed</td><td colspan=\"2\">Non-VC- Backed</td><td colspan=\"2\">Tests of</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">Targets</td><td colspan=\"2\">Targets</td><td colspan=\"2\">Equality (p-values)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>No.</td><td>%</td><td>No.</td><td>%</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>PanelB.FrequencyofDealFinancingMethods</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Involveacquirerstock</td><td>187</td><td>76%</td><td>187</td><td>76%</td><td>1.00</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Donotinvolveacquirerstock</td><td>58</td><td>24%</td><td>58</td><td>24%</td><td></td><td>1.00</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>245</td><td>100%</td><td>245</td><td>100%</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\ninsignificantly different across the 2 samples. The median total assets for the VC-backed and non-VC-backed targets equal $\\$123$ million and $\\$11.26$ million, respectively. The median takeover premia of VC-backed and non- VC-backed targets are 4.69 and 3.95, respectively, which are not significantly different from each other.10  \n\nPanel B of Table 3 reports the frequency of acquisition financing methods for the 2 matched samples. A comparison of the 2 samples on the basis of financing methods also indicates close matching on this dimension, given that in both samples $76\\%$ of the acquisitions involve stock financing. Overall, the 2 groups of targets are well matched on the following dimensions: industry, technology intensity, acquisition financing method, target book assets, deal size, relative deal size, and target takeover premium (target purchase price to book value). The closeness of the sample matching substantially alleviates concerns about selection bias that arise from the nonrandom nature of VC investment decisions and the resulting large differences in deal characteristics between the VC-backed and non-VCbacked samples.  \n\n## IV.Acquirer Returns for VC-Backed and Non-VC-Backed Targets  \n\nAs a first step in our analysis of bidder acquisition announcement effects, we examine acquisition announcements of VC-backed targets and our matched sample of non-VC-backed targets. We estimate the abnormal returns using a standard market-adjusted return model:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}{\\mathrm{AR}_{i}}&{{}=}&{r_{i}-r_{m}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIn the previous model, $r_{i}$ is the return on firm $i$ and $r_{m}$ is the value-weighted market (CRSP) index return. We calculate a CAR for the 5-day (-2, 2) period around the acquisition announcements (event day O) that are drawn from SDC's M&A database and then verified by searching the Lexis-Nexis and Factiva databases. Moeller et al. (2004) report that SDC announcement dates are accurate within 2 trading days of the actual acquisition announcement dates. Brown and Warner (1980) show that for short-window event studies, weighting the market return by the firm's stock beta does not significantly improve the power of the test, given the estimation error for beta and the small size of the daily expected return on the market index.11  \n\n### A. Univariate Analysis of Acquisition CARs for VC-Backed and Non-VC-Backed Targets  \n\nTable 4 presents acquirer mean and median 5-day abnormal stock returns on the announcements of private firm acquisitions. Panel A presents acquisition announcements separated into stock- and cash-financed deals. Acquirer mean (median) abnormal returns for stock- and cash-financed deals are $5.11\\%$ $(3.12\\%)$ and $4.00\\%$ $(2.47\\%)$ , respectively, which are not statistically distinguishable using either a $t$ -test or a Wilcoxon test. However, as shown in Panel B, acquirer mean (median) abnormal return for announcements of VC-backed targets is $6.31\\%$ $(4.30\\%)$ which is significantly higher than the mean (median) abnormal return of $3.38\\%$ $(2.03\\%)$ for the matched acquisition announcements of non-VC-backed targets. The difference in mean and median CARs for acquisition announcements of VCbacked and non-VC-backed targets is both economically meaningful and statistically significant. In both samples of VC-backed and non-VC-backed targets, slightly more than $65\\%$ of acquirers experience positive announcement abnormal returns.  \n\nPanel C of Table 4 reports acquisition announcement returns for stockfinanced offers distinguished by VC-backing status. The mean (median) abnormal return for acquirers of VC-backed targets is $6.92\\%$ $(4.70\\%)$ ，which is significantly different from the mean (median) abnormal return of $3.29\\%$ $(1.98\\%)$ for  \n\n# TABLE 4  \n\n### Acquirer CARs for Purchases of Private Targets: Method of Payment and VC Backing  \n\nCumulative abnormal returns(CARs)foracquirer stocks arecalculated over the 5 trading days $(-2,2)$ aroundtheacquisition announcement(day O). Abnormal returns are estimated using a market-adjusted return model: $r_{i}-r_{m}$ where $r_{j}$ is the return on the acquirer'sstocki and $r_{m}$ is the value-weighted market (CRSP index) return.The sample period is 1991-2006. All acquirers are publicly traded firms listed on the NYSE, NASDAQ, or AMEX with a stock price of $\\$2$ orgreateraroundthe acquisition announcement.Acquisitions must have a relative deal size (deal size divided by acquirer's market value of equity 1 monthprior to the acquisition announcement)of at least $10\\%$ .Thematched sampleof non-VC-backed targets is extracted from a universe of all privately held targets on the basis of high-technology industry indicator, method-ofpayment indicator, deal size,and relative deal size.Panel A presents acquirer CARs for the full sample by the method of payment.Panel B displays results for the full sample for VC-backed and non-VC-backed targets.Panels C and D present the abnormal returns classified both by method of payment and VC backing.

Finally, Panel D shows that acquirers announcing offers that do not involve stock as the acquisition currency have positive abnormal returns, regardless of VC-backing status. This evidence contrasts with the findings reported in Chang (1998) of an insignificant mean abnormal return to acquirers announcing cash offers. For offers that do not involve stock, the mean and median announcement CARs for the VC-backed and nonVC-backed targets are $4.36\\%$ $(3.48\\%)$ and $3.65\\%$ $(2.19\\%)$ , respectively; however, neither mean nor median differences are statistically significant.  \n\nIn the VC-backed target sample, a comparison of acquirer CARs for acquisitions with and without stock financing uncovers a statistically insignificant difference, although acquirer CARs are larger for stock-financed offers. Potential monitoring of acquirers by large blockholders, created by stock-financed acquisitions of targets with large shareholders, is one reason offered for the higher acquirer CARs in private firm acquisitions (Chang (1998)). Yet, our evidence indicates that this explanation is unlikely to be the primary cause for the observed differences in acquirer returns. This leads us to look for other explanations for the larger acquirer wealth effects associated with VC-backed targets, which involve several VC conflicts of interest with other private firm investors.  \n\n### B. Multivariate Analysis of Acquisition CARs for VC-Backed and Non-VC-Backed Targets  \n\nMoving to a multivariate analysis of acquirer announcement returns, we control for a number of deal characteristics found in prior studies to have explanatory power, along with a VC backing indicator. The deal characteristics used as controls are: log of acquirer size, relative deal size, market-to-book ratio in the target firm's industry in the year of the takeover announcement, and volatility of the acquirer's excess stock returns (measured from 270 to 6 trading days prior to the acquisition announcement), as well as indicators for i) VC-backed targets, ii) common stock-financed deals (partially or completely), iii) withinindustry deals based on their 2-digit SIC codes (a proxy for potential synergies between the acquirer and target firms), and iv) high-technology-intensive targets.12  \n\nMoeller et al. (2004) provide evidence that firm size is a key determinant of a bidder's announcement period abnormal return, with larger bidders exhibiting poorer announcement returns. Prior research also documents a significant relation between relative deal size and acquirer returns. Fuller et al. (2002) observe that relative deal size directly affects the relative importance of the acquisition to an acquirer's share value and thus makes it more likely that the deal announcement effect can be detected. A higher market-to-book ratio in an industry is an indication of a favorable investment climate, which is likely to infuence potential acquirers’ interest in such targets, thereby affecting acquirer CARs. Finally, in the spirit of Moeller et al. (2007), we control for the idiosyncratic volatility of acquiring firms, which has been found to partially account for differences in acquirer announcement returns across public and private targets.  \n\nTable 5 presents regression estimates of acquirer announcement CARs for the combined sample of VC-backed and matched non- VC-backed privately held targets. Consistent with the earlier univariate analysis, stock-financed acquisitions have a statistically insignificant effect, while acquisitions of VC-backed firms are significantly more profitable for acquirer shareholders than acquisitions of nonVC-backedfirms.  \n\nTurning to the control variables, the coefficient estimate on relative deal size is positive and statistically significant, indicating that the market views relatively larger deals as more beneficial to acquirers or, alternatively, that we are better able to detect the acquisition's economic effects. The coefficient on target industry market-to-book is significantly positive, consistent with a greater stock price reaction for bidders acquiring high growth firms. The coefficient on acquirer stock return volatility is also positive and statistically significant. Consistent with  \n\n# TABLE5 Analysis of Acquirer CARs for VC-Backed and Non-VC-Backed Targets  \n\nTable 5 reports ordinary least squares estimates. The dependent variable is the cumulative abnormal return (CAR) for the acquirer stock and is calculated over the 5 trading days (-2,2)around the acquisition announcement(day 0). Abnormal returns are estimated using a market-adjusted return model: $r_{i}-r_{m}$ where $r_{j}$ is the return on the acquirer's stock iand $r_{m}$ is the value-weighted market (CRSP index) return. The sample period is 1991-2006. The sample represents matchedpairs of privatelyheld acquisitions,half of which areVC-backed and the other half are non-VC-backed,where propensity score matching is used to choose the non-VC-backed matching acquisition. Stock acquisition is an indicator for common stock financed transactions (includes mixed offers—targets acquired through a combination of cash and stock). The VC-backed target variable indicates when a target has VC backing. The log(acquirer size) (equity market value measured 1 month prior to the acquisition announcement) and relative deal size (deal size divided by acquirer size) are included separately in the regression. Intraindustry deal is an indicator variable denoting whether the target and acquirer firms belong to the same industry based on their 2-digit SIC codes. The high-technology target indicator denotes targets in the following high-technology industries: biological products, pharmaceuticals, genetics, software services, electronic equipment, computers, communication services, and high-technology communications. Target industry market-to-book denotes the median value of the market-to-book ratio in the target firm's industryin the year of the takeover announcement.Acquirer stock returnvolatility denotes the standard deviation of the acquirer's excess stock returns measured from trading days $-6$ to $-270$ prior to the announcement date (day 0). p-values based on heteroskedastic-consistent robust standard errors adjusted for industry clustering are reported in brackets next to the parameter estimates. \\*\\*\\*, \\*\\*， and \\* denote significance at the $1\\%$ $5\\%$ ：and $10\\%$ levels, respectively.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">CAR (1)</td><td colspan=\"2\">CAR (2)</td><td colspan=\"2\">CAR (3)</td><td colspan=\"2\">StockOffers (4)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Coeff.</td><td>p-Value</td><td>Coeff.</td><td>p-Value</td><td>Coeff.</td><td>p-Value</td><td>Coeff.</td><td>p-Value</td></tr><tr><td>Stockacquisition</td><td>0.001</td><td>[0.909]</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.002</td><td>[0.916]</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VC-backedtarget</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.027</td><td>[0.030]**</td><td>0.027</td><td>[0.030]**</td><td>0.034</td><td>[0.025]**</td></tr><tr><td>log(acquirer size)</td><td>-0.006</td><td>[0.254]</td><td>-0.007</td><td>[0.166]</td><td>-0.007</td><td>[0.164]</td><td>-0.006</td><td>[0.358]</td></tr><tr><td>Relativedealsize</td><td>0.030</td><td>[0.024]**</td><td>0.028</td><td>[0.032]**</td><td>0.028</td><td>[0.033]**</td><td>0.032</td><td>[0.075]*</td></tr><tr><td>Intraindustry deal</td><td>-0.013</td><td>[0.303]</td><td>0.015</td><td>[0.259]</td><td>0.015</td><td>[0.258]</td><td>0.014</td><td>[0.389]</td></tr><tr><td>High-technologytarget</td><td>-0.015</td><td>[0.506]</td><td>-0.013</td><td>[0.555]</td><td>-0.013</td><td>[0.553]</td><td>-0.014</td><td>[0.588]</td></tr><tr><td>Target industrymarket-to-book</td><td>0.046</td><td>[0.005]***</td><td>0.048</td><td>[0.003]***</td><td>0.048</td><td>[0.003]***</td><td>0.062</td><td>[0.003]***</td></tr><tr><td>Acquirerstockreturnvolatility</td><td>1.110 -0.004</td><td>[0.002]*** [0.978]</td><td>1.042 0.010</td><td>[0.004]*** [0.940]</td><td>1.034</td><td>[0.005] [0.936]</td><td>0.936</td><td>[0.030]**</td></tr><tr><td>Intercept</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.011</td><td></td><td>-0.082</td><td>[0.207]</td></tr><tr><td>Industryandyearfixedeffects</td><td colspan=\"4\">Present</td><td colspan=\"2\">Present</td><td colspan=\"2\">Present</td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted R2 No. of obs.</td><td colspan=\"2\">3.56% 490</td><td colspan=\"2\">Present 4.47%</td><td colspan=\"2\">4.26% 490</td><td colspan=\"2\">3.38%</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nthe findings in Moeller et al. (2004), the coefficient on acquirer size is negative, though statistically insignificant. The other control variables, namely indicators for intraindustry acquisitions and technology-intensive targets, are statistically insignificant.13  \n\nIn model 4 of Table 5, we replicate the analysis on the subsample of acquisitions that are partially or completely stock financed. We find that the VC-backed target indicator has a larger positive coefficient than in the full sample of acquirer announcements. In summary, acquisitions of VC-backed targets lead to significantly higher acquirer announcement returns than acquisitions of non-VC-backed targets.  \n\nV. Profitable Acquisitions of VC-Backed Targets: VC Liquidity, VC Self-Dealing, and CVC Strategic Focus Hypotheses  \n\nA. Comparison of Mean and Median Acquisition CARs for Samples of VC-BackedTargets  \n\nWe now examine the descriptive power of the 3 VC conflicts of interest hypotheses, namely VC liquidity, VC self-dealing, and CVC strategic focus, to explain the higher acquirer CARs associated with acquisitions of VC-backed targets. To improve the power of our tests to distinguish among these VC-based hypotheses, we restrict our analysis to acquisitions of VC-backed targets. To test the predictions of our 3 hypotheses, we distinguish among VC-backed targets by the types of conflicts of interest they face, as discussed later. We initially examine the mean and median acquirer announcement returns across the various subsamples of acquisitions of VC-backed targets, and we follow this with multivariate regression analysis.  \n\nThe VC liquidity hypothesis reflects the fact that VC funds are primarily organized as limited partnerships that are self-liquidating on a fixed termination date. VC funds nearing their termination dates should experience greater pressure to liquidate their investments. As a consequence, VCs have incentives to use their strong control rights and the target's need for further VC funding to pressure managers to sell portfolio companies quickly, causing sales at relatively lower prices. The result is lower takeover premia for targets and higher wealth gains for acquirer shareholders. We measure VC fund liquidation pressure using the interval between the acquisition announcement date and the lead VC fund's initial closing date.14 We focus on the lead VC, since a lead VC will have the most influence in the VC syndicate and is also most likely to have 1 or more seats on a start-up's board of directors. The lead VC is defined as the VC making the largest investment in the target across all rounds of VC funding. While it is not uncommon for VC firms that manage multiple funds to invest in the same portfolio firm, in our sample lead VCs rarely have more than 1 fund investing in the same target company.  \n\nTo test the VC liquidity hypothesis, we compare acquisitions of VC-backed targets backed by older and younger VC funds that face more and less liquidation pressure, respectively. We construct an indicator variable representing the top tercile of VC funds closest to liquidation, which face more intense liquidity pressure. We find that acquisitions of targets backed by older VC funds closer to liquidation result in higher acquirer returns (median CAR: $5.04\\%$ thanthosebacked by younger VC funds (median CAR: $3.81\\%$ ). However, the difference is not statistically significant, so this is at best weak evidence in support of the VC liquidity hypothesis.  \n\nFor the VC self-dealing hypothesis, we create an indicator variable to capture the dual financial relationship a VC firm can have with both the acquirer and target firms. The indicator variable denoting the dual financial relationship equals unity when the same VC firm holds equity stakes in both the acquiring and target firms before the acquisition announcement, and O otherwise. The economic impacts of cross-holdings of bidder and target firms by institutional shareholders are analyzed in the context of public firm acquisitions by Harford et al. (2008), Bodnaruk et al. (2008), and Matvos and Ostrovsky (2008). These studies explore the effects of conflicts of interest among institutional stockholders, which result from cross-holdings of shares in both bidders and targets. We hand-collect information on VC shareholdings in acquiring firms from a variety of acquirer SEC filings, including proxy statements (15 cases), prospectuses and registration statements (9 cases), and other filings (SC13G: 3 cases; S-4: 1 case). All of these SEC filings must be dated prior to the acquisition announcement, and we use VC shareholding data from the most recent acquirer filing (predating the acquisition announcement) that contains this information. Thus, we uncover 28 cases of potential conflicts of interest/self-dealing, in which a VC held equity stakes in both the acquiring and target firms before the acquisition announcement.  \n\nWe find significantly higher acquirer returns in deals involving clear VC conflicts of interest, which support H2: the VC self-dealing hypothesis. More specifically, mean and median acquirer announcement effects (CARs) in acquisitions susceptible to a VC self-dealing problem are $14.65\\%$ and $12.58\\%$ , respectively, and the portion of the sample with positive acquirer announcement effects is nearly $86\\%$ . By way of contrast, the mean and median acquirer announcement effects in VC-backed acquisitions without such conficted VCs are notably lower, at $5.24\\%$ and $3.68\\%$ , respectively, and the portion of the sample with positive acquirer announcement effects is below $64\\%$  \n\nAs mentioned earlier, strategically oriented CVCs have fundamentally different incentives from financially oriented TVCs. In addition, CVCs are typically controlled by more risk-averse parent boards of directors. As a result, potential acquirers are likely to factor into their offer prices CVCs’ weaker financial incentives, their strong strategic focus, and greater risk aversion, which can toughen their negotiating position and raise acquirer announcement returns. We test the CVC strategic focus hypothesis using an indicator variable for the existence of a CVC in the VC syndicate. We find that 60 of the 245 VC-backed targets include CVC investors. The mean (median) size of CVC-backed targets, measured by purchase price, is $\\$232$ $(\\$75)$ million. This is in comparison to the mean (median) purchase price of $\\$160$ $\\$63$ million for the sample of purely TVC-backed targets. Thus, targets with CVC backing are slightly larger than those with only TVC backing, though the differences are not statistically significant using either a $t\\cdot$ -test or a Wilcoxon test. The mean or median differences in the book values of total assets of CVC-backed targets and purely VC-backed targets are not significant either.  \n\nOf the 60 CVC-backed targets, 57 receive investments from strategically inclined CVCs. We code whether there is a strategic fit between the CVC parent and the target firm based on information collected from a variety of sources, as explained below. If the 2 parties have the same 2-digit SIC code, then we classify the CVC investment as strategic. We also read the SEC filings of CVC parents to uncover any operating relationships between the 2 parties. For instance, if the CVC parent is a customer, supplier, strategic alliance partner, or technology licensor to the target firm, we classify the CVC investment as strategic in nature. Finally, we use Web searches to obtain further information on whether the operating relationship between the target firm and CVC parent is strategic in nature. Even though we are explicitly able to code the relations between target firms and CVC parents in an overwhelming majority $(95\\%)$ of the cases, we continue to use the entire sample of CVC-backed targets in our analysis, since some strategic relations may not be observable from the publicly filed documents. However, our results are robust to using only the subsample of 57 explicitly classified CVC-target strategic relations. We find that the mean and median acquirer CARs in deals involving CVC-backed targets are $11.50\\%$ and $7.36\\%$ , respectively, which are significantly greater than the mean and median acquirer CARs of $4.86\\%$ and $3.68\\%$ respectively, observed in acquisitions of pure TVC-backed firms. This evidence supports the predictions of H3: the CVC strategic focus hypothesis. Although we do not tabulate the univariate results to conserve space, they are available from the authors.  \n\n### B. Multivariate Analysis of Acquisition CARs for VC-Backed Targets  \n\nIn this section we analyze VC-backed acquisitions in a multivariate setting to more accurately assess the causes for the higher announcement returns in acquisitions of VC-backed targets than is possible in a univariate analysis. We test our 3 VC conflicts of interest hypotheses individually and jointly. As control variables, we use the same control variables employed in Table 5, plus 2 indicators denoting whether i) the lead VC is in the bottom third of the firms by virtue of their investment experience, and ii) the target is in the seed or early stage of development at the most recent VC funding round preceding the acquisition.  \n\nThe motivations for the 2 indicator variables follow. Younger, less experienced VCs can be less effective at assisting targets in negotiating higher acquisition prices. They are also likely to have weaker networks of contacts, which can lead to weaker interest in buying their portfolio firms. If competition is sparse for acquiring a target, then an acquirer is in a stronger negotiating position. Young VC firms also have incentives to establish a successful track record in venture investing to support their next rounds of fundraising. For instance, Gompers (1996) explores the “grandstanding\" hypothesis in the IPO market, where younger VCs are under strong pressure to establish a successful track record in venture investing to support their next round of fundraising. Strong track records reduce future fundraising costs and time commitments. Thus, young VC firms could be willing to accept lower acquisition prices to obtain profitable exits sooner, which can raise acquirer returns.  \n\nVentureXpert provides very little information on portfolio companies other than funding rounds, amounts invested, venture investors, and eventual exits. We partially account for differences in unobservable characteristics, such as a target's riskiness, by including an indicator denoting companies in an early development stage at their most recent funding round prior to the acquisition announcement.  \n\nThis indicator also acts as a proxy for the uncertainty about target valuation at the time of the merger transaction (Officer et al. (2009)). In addition, we include industry indicators that allow us to partially account for differences in technological intensity and product market competition across portfolio companies.  \n\nTable 6 presents a multivariate analysis of acquirer announcement CARs focusing on Hypotheses 1-3 individually in the first 3 models and then jointly in the last model. Model 1 presents a test of H1, the VC liquidity hypothesis. We find that the indicator variable for funds closer to liquidation has a positive sign as predicted, but it is not statistically significant.  \n\nTABLE 6 Analysis of Acquirer CARs to Announcements of Purchases of VC-Backed Targets  \n\nTable 6 reports ordinary least squares estimates. The dependent variable CAR is the 5-day cumulative abnormal return (CAR), the excess over the value-weighted CRSP market return. The sample period is 1991-2006. VC liquidity is an indicator variable denoting a third of the funds (in our sample) closest to liquidation and is based on the time interval between theacquisition announcement date and the initial closingdateof theVCfund.TheVCself-dealing indicatordenotes the presence of a VC conflict of interest,which occurs when a VC has a dual financial relationship with the target and acquirer through share holdings in both. The CVC strategic focus indicator denotes that the VC syndicate includes a corporate venture capitalist.Early/seed stage target is an indicatorvariable denoting whether the target was in the seed/early development stage in the last VC funding round preceding the acquisition announcement. VC inexperience is an indicator variable denoting a third of the least experienced VC funds in our sample and is based on the age of the lead VC firm at the time of the takeover announcement. Stock acquisition indicates that the acquisition currency includes common stock. The other control variables include the log of acquirer size(equity market value measured 1 month prior to the announcement). relative deal size (deal size divided by acquirer size), an intraindustry deal indicator denoting that the target and acquirer belong to the same industry, a high-technology target indicator denoting that the target is in a high-technology industry. target industry market-to-book ratio, and acquirer stock return volatility. Target and acquirer firms belong to the same industry if they have the same 2-digit SIC code. High-technology industries include: biological products, pharmaceuticals, genetics, software services,electronic equipment, computers, communication services,and high-technology communications.Acquirer stock return volatility is measured by the standard deviation of the acquirer's excess stockreturns estimated over trading days $-6$ $-270$ days prior to the announcement date (day O). $p$ values,based onheteroskedasticconsistent robust standard errors adjusted for vC firm clustering, are reported in brackets next to the parameter estimates. \\*\\*anddete signiicanceatt $1\\%$ $5\\%$ and $10\\%$ levels,respectively.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">CAR (1)</td><td colspan=\"2\">CAR (2)</td><td colspan=\"2\">CAR (3)</td><td colspan=\"2\">CAR (4)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Coeff.</td><td>p-Value</td><td>Coeff.</td><td>p-Value</td><td>Coeff.</td><td>p-Value</td><td>Coeff.</td><td>p-Value</td></tr><tr><td>VCliquidity</td><td>0.018</td><td>[0.64]</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.022</td><td>[0.56]</td></tr><tr><td>VC self-dealing</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.066</td><td>[0.02]**</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.066</td><td>[0.02]**</td></tr><tr><td>CVCstrategicfocus</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.053</td><td>[0.07]*</td><td>0.055</td><td>[0.07]*</td></tr><tr><td>Early/seedstagetarget</td><td>0.024</td><td>[0.27]</td><td>0.016</td><td>[0.46]</td><td>0.023</td><td>[0.27]</td><td>0.021</td><td>[0.32]</td></tr><tr><td>VCinexperience</td><td>0.010</td><td>[0.66]</td><td>0.007</td><td>[0.71]</td><td>0.003</td><td>[0.86]</td><td>0.006</td><td>[0.79]</td></tr><tr><td>Stockacquisition</td><td>-0.010</td><td>[0.64]</td><td>0.011</td><td>[0.57]</td><td>-0.004</td><td>[0.85]</td><td>-0.013</td><td>[0.54]</td></tr><tr><td>og(acquirersize)</td><td>-0.006</td><td>[0.50]</td><td>0.007</td><td>[0.50]</td><td>-0.008</td><td>[0.41]</td><td>-0.006</td><td>[0.52]</td></tr><tr><td>Relativedeal size</td><td>0.020</td><td>[0.39]</td><td>0.018</td><td>[0.42]</td><td>0.014</td><td>[0.55]</td><td>0.012</td><td>[0.58]</td></tr><tr><td>Intraindustrydeal</td><td>0.016</td><td>[0.56]</td><td>-0.023</td><td>[0.36]</td><td>-0.009</td><td>[0.71]</td><td>0.014</td><td>[0.56]</td></tr><tr><td>High-technologytarget</td><td>0.025 0.058</td><td>[0.43] [0.06]*</td><td>-0.032 0.054</td><td>[0.27]</td><td>-0.029</td><td>[0.28]</td><td>-0.019</td><td>[0.52]</td></tr><tr><td>Targetindustrymarket-to-book Acquirerstockreturnvolatility</td><td>2.082</td><td>[0.03]**</td><td>2.003</td><td>[0.07]*</td><td>0.052</td><td>[0.08]*</td><td>0.049 1.875</td><td>[0.09]*</td></tr><tr><td>Intercept</td><td>0.021</td><td>[0.78]</td><td>0.056</td><td>[0.03]** [0.40]</td><td>1.826</td><td>[0.03]** [0.41]</td><td>0.026</td><td>[0.03]**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.056</td><td></td><td></td><td>[0.72]</td></tr><tr><td>Industryandyearfixedeffects</td><td colspan=\"2\">Present</td><td colspan=\"2\">Present</td><td colspan=\"2\">Present</td><td colspan=\"2\">Present</td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted R2</td><td colspan=\"2\">4.33%</td><td colspan=\"2\">6.05%</td><td colspan=\"2\">6.24%</td><td colspan=\"2\">7.20%</td></tr><tr><td>No. of obs.</td><td colspan=\"2\">239</td><td colspan=\"2\">245</td><td colspan=\"2\">245</td><td colspan=\"2\">239</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nIn model 2, the VC self-dealing indicator has a positive and significant coefficient. This is consistent with VCs having conflicts of interest with other target investors when VCs also have financial relationships with the acquiring firms. This confict thus results in higher wealth gains for the acquiring firms if it leads these VCs to pressure portfolio firms to sell themselves more cheaply. On average, the presence of such dual relationships results in a nearly $7\\%$ increase in acquirer CARs during the 5-day window. Thus the evidence supports H2, the $V C$ self-dealing hypothesis. Model 3 tests H3, the CVC strategic focus hypothesis that CVC backing of targets raises acquirer announcement CARs, by using an indicator for the presence of a CVC in the VC syndicate. We find that CVCs are associated with higher acquirer CARs, which on average are $5\\%$ higher over the 5-day announcement period. To assess the marginal effects of the last 2 indicators, recall from Table 4 that the mean acquirer CAR is $6.3\\%$ for VC-backed targets.  \n\nFinally, in model 4 of Table 6, we jointly test the significance of all 3 hypotheses on acquirer announcement returns. Again we find support for the $V C$ self-dealing and CVC strategic focus hypotheses. Examining the other control variables, we find in all 4 models that the coefficients on target industry marketto-book and acquirer stock return volatility are positive and significant, while the remaining control variables are statistically insignificant. In an unreported regression, we follow Officer et al. (2009) by interacting the early development stage indicator with the stock acquisition indicator. Similar to the findings in Officer et al., we observe a positive coefficient on the interaction variable, suggesting that acquirer returns are higher in stock-financed acquisitions, which are more difficult to value. However, the interaction variable is not significant at conventional levels $\\mathrm{\\Delta}p$ value $=0.2\\AA,$ 0, and our other results remain qualitatively unchanged. In summary, higher acquirer CARs are at least partially attributable to various VC conflicts of interest with other target firm shareholders, which lead to positive announcement effects for acquirer shareholders.  \n\n### C. Univariate and Multivariate Analysis of Target Takeover Premia  \n\nTo further evaluate the 3 VC conflicts of interest hypotheses, we next examine the determinants of a target's takeover premium, which we proxy by the target's purchase price scaled by its book value. Scaling the target purchase price by its book value provides for a more meaningful comparison across target firms. If VC involvement can affect acquirer CARs, then it is also likely to affect the purchase prices of VC-backed targets. In robustness checks, we obtain similar qualitative results upon normalizing the target's purchase price to book value by the median target industry market-to-book ratio, and using the natural logarithm of the ratio as our measure of takeover premium.  \n\nIn the univariate comparisons across subsamples of acquisitions, we find that sales of targets backed by VC funds closer to liquidation occur at a significantly lower median takeover premium (a median of 3.25) compared to sales of targets backed by VC funds farther from liquidation (a median of 6.38). This is consistent with H1, the VC liquidity hypothesis, and suggests that when VCs face stronger incentives to liquidate their investments, they put greater pressure on their portfolio firms to sell and avoid extended negotiations, which might cause the potential acquirers to walk away from proposed deals. The end result is a sale of the target firm at a relatively lower price.  \n\nTo further test the prediction of H2, the VC self-dealing hypothesis, we examine takeover premia for targets backed by VCs with acquirer stockholdings and expect to observe a lower takeover premium when VCs are conficted. If VCs have conflicts of interest, then negotiations over target purchase prices can be adversely affected, and target purchase prices are likely to be lower. We find the mean (median) takeover premium for targets backed by VCs with acquirer shareholdings is 7.75 (2.79) compared to a mean (median) of 18.25 (4.71) for targets backed by VCs without these dual financial relationships. Further, these differences are statistically significant. This supports the prediction of H2 that targets receive lower purchase prices. Thus, the evidence indicates that VC incentives to support aggressive negotiations aimed at raising purchase prices for their portfolio firms are measurably compromised by these dual financial relations and result in lower target purchase prices and higher wealth gains for acquirer shareholders.  \n\nFinally, when comparing takeover premia of targets backed by CVC and TVC investors, we find the mean (median) takeover premium for CVC-backed targets is 19.66 (5.33), which is higher than the mean (median) takeover premium of 16.16 (4.52) for purely TVC-backed targets. The median differences are statistically significant at the $10\\%$ level, although the mean differences are not significant. Although we do not tabulate univariate results to conserve space, they are available from the authors.  \n\nIn Table 7 we present a multivariate analysis of target takeover premia, controlling for the same deal characteristics that we control for in Table 6. In the first model we include an indicator for VC funds nearing maturity. The significant negative coefficient is consistent with older VC funds experiencing greater liquidity pressure, which leads VCs to pressure target managers into selling out more quickly at lower purchase prices. In contrast, VC funds farther from liquidation appear to support more aggressive acquisition negotiations. This evidence is consistent with H1: the VC liquidity hypothesis.  \n\nThe second equation of Table 7 tests the importance of the VC self-dealing hypothesis on target takeover premia. We find a significant negative coefficient on the self-dealing indicator, consistent with the prediction that targets backed by conflicted VCs receive lower purchase prices. The third model includes a CVCbacked target indicator, which we find has an insignificant coefficient estimate, suggesting that CVC backing does not have a strong impact on target takeover premia.  \n\nFinally, the last equation in Table 7 presents a joint test of these hypotheses by including all 3 indicator variables. The results are consistent with the earlier estimates, though the model's explanatory power is higher. We also observe that acquisitions involving stock financing, high-technology targets, and targets in early development stages are associated with higher target takeover premia. Finally, when the market-to-book ratio in the target industry is higher, acquirers pay more for targets as well.  \n\nTaken together, the evidence on acquirer CARs and target purchase prices provides support for the VC self-dealing hypothesis as well as the VC liquidity and CVC strategic focus hypotheses. In addition, we find that VC inexperience does not have a significant effect on either the acquirer CARs or the target takeover premia. This suggests that while grandstanding by inexperienced VCs is important in the IPO market (Gompers (1996)), it does not appear to be so in the acquisition market. Finally, we find evidence that stock financing is associated with higher target takeover premia, though this could be due to a self-selection effect. We explore this issue further in the robustness analysis that follows.  \n\n# TABLE 7 Analysis of Takeover Premia of VC-Backed Targets  \n\nTable7reportsordinary least squaresestimates.The dependent variable, $\\mathsf{l o g}(\\mathsf{P}/\\mathsf{B})$ is the target firm's takeover premium, defined as the log of the purchase price to book value of total assets ratio.

Robustness Checks  \n\n### A. Matching VC-Backed and Non-VC-Backed Acquisitions Using a Traditional Matching Procedure  \n\nTo assess the effectiveness of our propensity score matching procedure, we replicate our earlier results using a more traditional matching procedure. As discussed earlier, traditional sequential matching procedures are not as effective as propensity score matching when the number of characteristics being matched on rises, and so sequential matching is unlikely to closely match the key characteristics in the 2 samples. This reflects a well-known problem with the sequential matching approach, that is, when matching is performed across several criteria, the first characteristic is matched more exactly than subsequent characteristics. Despite this shortcoming, we match acquisitions sequentially across 3 dimensions to facilitate comparisons with earlier studies based on this approach. We then control for other potentially important deal characteristics in our multivariate analysis of the combined paired samples. The sequential procedure we follow is to match i) on a similar deal size (the deal size of the non-VC-backed target should be within $50\\%$ and $150\\%$ of that of its matched VC-backed target), followed by ii) similar relative deal size (the relative deal size of the non-VCbacked target is constrained to be within $50\\%$ and $150\\%$ of that of the VC-backed target), and i) similar acquisition announcement dates (the acquisition announcements of the VC-backed target and its matched non-VC-backed target should be within 90 days of each other).  \n\nThe third criterion is a refinement on using the relatively coarser year indicators as one of the criteria for matching the M&A deals, which is used in part of our robustness analysis and produces similar qualitative results to our earlier findings (see footnote 9). Existing empirical evidence documents that M&A activity occurs in waves over time and is concentrated in a small number of industries (Andrade, Mitchell, and Stafford (2001)). Thus, firm characteristics could differ for acquisitions occurring in different waves or outside these waves (Harford (2005)). To control for differing economic conditions, we match on announcement dates as well. All of our earlier results remain qualitatively similar after we implement this procedure. Moreover, our results are not specific to a particular matching approach or the sequence adopted for matching across multiple characteristics.  \n\n### B.  Adjusting for Self-Selection Using the Heckman Correction  \n\nThe purpose of matching acquisitions involving VC-backed and non-VCbacked targets on several dimensions is to ensure a closely matched sample, which also controls for the selection process associated with these firms receiving VC funding. Using both the “nontraditional\" propensity score technique and a “more traditional’ matching procedure, we show that VC-backed targets create higher wealth gains for acquirer shareholders based on acquisition announcement effects. As an alternative approach, we use the Heckman (1979) correction procedure to generate consistent model estimates after adjusting for selection bias. To implement this approach, data on VC-backed acquisition announcements are combined with all non-VC-backed acquisition announcements.15 In the 1st-step model, we estimate the likelihood of targets being VC-backed using a probit regression framework. In the 2nd-step linear regression, we include the inverse Mills ratio, $\\lambda$ , obtained from the 1st-step estimation as an additional regressor in our earlier model of acquirer announcement returns:  \n\n1st Step (Probit): Prob (VC-Backed Target) $=a_{0}+a_{1}$ Control Variables $+\\varepsilon$  \n\n2nd Step: $\\mathrm{CAR}(-2,2)=b_{0}+b_{1}$ VC-Backed Target $+~b_{2}$ Control Variables $+b_{3}\\lambda+\\eta$  \n\nIn the 1st step of the Heckman (1979) procedure, we estimate a predictive model for VC-backed privately held target firms. The instruments used in the 1st-step selection equation include 5 indicator variables denoting targets in hightechnology industries, and targets headquartered in California, Massachusetts, New York, and Texas. Prior research shows that VC investments are largely concentrated in these 4 states, making the likelihood high that VC-backed targets are headquartered in these states. We also include aggregate IPO proceeds in the 3 months preceding the acquisition announcement month. Prior studies find that VCs time their exits to periods with better IPO market conditions (Lerner (1994b)), which raises the expected proportion of VC-backed acquisitions in such times. Finally, to account for overall VC activity in the market, we include aggregate VC industry investment in the industry over the 3 months prior to the acquisition announcement month. For these to be valid instruments, they must be significant regressors for the VC selection model, but not in the 2nd-stage acquirer stock return model.  \n\nIn unreported results we find that most of the explanatory variables in the model predicting VC-backed targets are statistically significant. The likelihood of a target having VC backing is significantly related to indicator variables for targets in high-technology industries and targets headquartered in California and Massachusetts. Increased aggregate VC investment activity is also accompanied by an increased proportion of acquisitions of VC-backed targets. The significant instruments in the 1st stage are not significant in the 2nd-stage model, making them valid instruments for the Heckman (1979) adjustment procedure. The 2ndstep estimates are similar to those reported in Table 5. Most importantly, acquisitions of VC-backed targets lead to significantly larger acquirer announcement returns of more than $2\\%$ over the 5-day window, compared to non-VC-backed targets. In addition, stock acquisitions lead to significantly higher acquirer CARs, as does the relative deal size. In contrast, intraindustry deals and acquisitions by larger buyers lead to lower acquirer CARs. The inverse Mills ratio derived from the 1st-step estimation is not statistically significant in the 2nd-stage model, indicating that selection bias does not significantly affect our 2nd-stage estimates. In summary, our results do not appear to be caused by selection bias arising from a common set of VC investment criteria.  \n\n### C. Interdependence of Acquirer CARs and Target Takeover Premia  \n\nIn prior analyses, we evaluated the $3\\mathrm{VC}$ conflicts of interest hypotheses separately in acquirer CAR and target takeover premium regressions, treating these 2 dependent variables as independently determined, using single equation models. However, these 2 dependent variables may be jointly determined. To address this concern, we simultaneously estimate the acquirer CAR and the target takeover premium equations for VC-backed targets, where we allow the takeover premium to enter the acquirer announcement return regression. Table 8 reports the joint estimation results, which yields very similar estimates to those obtained earlier from single equation estimation. Although the coefficient on the log of the takeover premium has a negative sign in the CAR equation, it is never statistically significant. The models differ by inclusion of a single indicator associated with 1 of the 3 VC conflicts of interest hypotheses, or all 3 indicators (model 4). The basic conclusions drawn from our earlier analysis concerning the significance of the 3 hypotheses continue to hold under joint estimation of the acquisition announcement CARs and target takeover premia.  \n\nJoint estimation of the models for acquisition announcement CARs and target takeover premia based on matched samples of VC-backed and non-VC-backed targets also yields qualitatively similar results (not reported), namely that  \n\n# TABLE 8  \n\n### Analysis of Acquirer CARs and Takeover Premia of VC-Backed Targets in a 2-Equation Simultaneous System  \n\nIn the first equation,the dependent variableCAR is the 5-day cumulative abnormal return (CAR),theexcess overthe value-weighted CRSPmarket return.In the second equation,the dependent variable is the log of the takeover premium (purchase price to book value of target's assets).

\n\nacquisitions of VC-backed targets lead to higher acquirer announcement returns. Moreover, the correlation between target takeover premia and acquirer CARs is negative, although it is not statistically significant in this simultaneous equations framework.  \n\n### D. Target Takeover Premia and Endogeneity of the M&A Currency Choice  \n\nAnother potential concern with our prior analysis of takeover premia is the potential endogeneity of the stock financing regressor. The concern is that the payment method choice could directly impact the size of the target's takeover premium and vice versa. For example, using cash as merger currency can result in immediate tax recognition of long-standing unrealized capital gains for target shareholders, which could induce target shareholders to demand higher purchase prices, ceteris paribus. This would in turn raise target takeover premia. On the other hand, a high takeover premium, especially in larger deals, can make stock more attractive to acquirers as M&A currency, particularly when an acquirer has limited holdings of liquid assets and unused debt capacity. Because of the endogenous nature of the stock financing choice, the estimated coefficients in Table 7 could be biased. Thus, as a further robustness check, we estimate a 2-equation simultaneous system that includes: i) a logit regression to predict stock-financed acquisitions, and ii) a target takeover premium equation. The logit model estimating the likelihood of a stock offer uses as explanatory variables, the log of takeover premium, log of acquirer size, high-technology target indicator, relative deal size, acquirer stock return volatility, early/seed stage target indicator, and industry fixed effects.  \n\nAs seen in Table 9, the coefficients on the VC liquidity and VC self-dealing indicators remain statistically significant, with the same signs as before, again supporting the VC liquidity and VC self-dealing hypotheses. We also find that deals involving higher takeover premia are more likely to use stock as acquisition currency. In summary, our results are robust to the use of several alternate estimation methods and are insensitive to controlling for endogeneity.  \n\n### E. Controlling for VC Shareholdings in Acquirers  \n\nFinally, we control for VC shareholdings in acquiring firms, since higher VC shareholdings in acquirers lead to larger conflicts of interest with other target investors. In the specifications reported in Tables 6 and 7, we replace the VC self-dealing indicator with the actual size of VC shareholdings in the acquirers, measured prior to the acquisition announcement. For the potentially self-dealing VCs, the average size of VC shareholdings in acquiring firms is $7.6\\%$ . In these regressions (not reported), we continue to find that acquisitions of targets backed by conflicted VCs result in higher acquirer CARs and lower target takeover premia. The significant positive coefficient on VC shareholdings indicates that larger VC holdings of acquirer stock lead to higher acquirer announcement returns and lower target takeover premia.  \n\n# TABLE9 Joint Analysis of Takeover Premia and the Likelihood of Stock Financing in Acquisitions of VC-BackedTargets ina 2-EquationSimultaneousSystem  \n\nThe dependent variable is the log of the target's takeover premium (purchase price to book value of total assets ratio or the log(P/B). The sample period is 1991-2006.VC liquidity is an indicator variable denoting a third of the funds (in our sample) closest to liquidation and is based on the time interval between the acquisition announcement date and the initial closing date of the VC fund. The VC self-dealing indicator denotes the presence of VC conflicts of interest, which occurs when the VC has a dual financial relationship with the target and acquirer through share holdings in both. The CvC strategic focus indicates that the VC syndicate includes a corporate venture capitalist. Early/seed stage target is an indicator variabledenoting whether the target was inthe seed/earlydevelopment stage in the last VC funding round preceding the acquisition announcement.VCinexperience is anindicatorvariabledenotinga third of theleastexperiencedVCfunds in our sample and is based on the age of the lead vC firm at the time of the takeover announcement. Stock acquisition indicates that the acquisition currency includes common stock. The other control variables include relative deal size (deal size divided by acquirer size), an intraindustry deal indicator denoting that the target and acquirer belong to the same industry, and a high-technology target indicator denoting that the target is in a high-technology industry. Target and acquirer firms belong to the same industry if they have the same 2-digit SIC code. High-technology industries include: biological products,pharmaceuticals,genetics,software services,electronic equipment,computers,communication services,and high-technology communications. The last 2 control variables are the target industry market-to-book ratio and acquirer stock returnvolatility.which is measured by the standard deviation of the acquirer's excessstockreturns estimated over tradingdays $-6$ to -270 prior to the announcement date (day 0). In the joint estimation of the second equation, which explains the likelihood of a stock offer, we add log(P/B) and acquirer size (market value of acquirer's equity 1 month prior to the acquisition announcement) as additional explanatory variables. $p$ -values based on heteroskedastic-consistent robust standard errors are reported in parentheses beneath the parameter estimates. \\*\\*\\* \\*, and \\* denote significance at the $1\\%$ $5\\%$ and $10\\%$ levels,respectively.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">(1)</td><td colspan=\"2\">(2)</td><td colspan=\"2\">(3)</td></tr><tr><td>log(P/B)</td><td>Pr(Stock)</td><td>log(P/B)</td><td>Pr(Stock)</td><td>log(P/B)</td><td>Pr(Stock)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Coeff.

Conclusions  \n\nWe examine acquisition announcements for private firms with and without VC backing and find that the CARs realized by acquiring shareholders are higher for VC-backed targets than for non-VC-backed targets. This evidence appears contrary to the VC certification hypothesis, which predicts that VCs should enhance the prices of VC-backed targets and reduce the announcement returns to bidders. It suggests that while IPO investors value certification by financial intermediaries such as VCs and underwriters, acquirers of private firms, because of their sophistication and access to proprietary target information, do not rely on certification by VCs or other financial intermediaries.  \n\nWe then investigate whether VCs, who typically have substantial control rights in their portfolio firms, can have conflicts of interest with other private firm investors around acquisition bids, resulting in higher acquirer wealth gains. To explore this possibility, we undertake an in-depth analysis of acquisitions of VC-backed targets and examine bidder announcement returns as well as target takeover premia to assess whether significant VC conflicts of interest exist. We find several strands of evidence suggesting that the acquisition process is affected by 3 types of VC conflicts with other investors in their portfolio companies, which raises VC incentives to encourage more rapid and less profitable acquisitions of their portfolio companies. Specifically, we find that as VC funds face pressure to liquidate as they move closer to maturity, acquirer returns are on average higher and target takeover premia are significantly lower. This is consistent with maturing VC funds pressuring their portfolio firms to expeditiously negotiate a sale of the company, while VC funds further away from maturity give target firms freer rein to negotiate higher purchase prices over longer negotiating horizons.  \n\nWe uncover evidence that both informal and formal networks operating in the VC market are helpful in locating potential acquirers, and in a number of cases VCs appear to match targets with acquirers already in their venture networks. However, when a VC investor in a target also has a direct financial tie to the acquirer, acquirer announcement returns are on average higher. Furthermore, when such dual relationships exist, the purchase prices received by targets relative to their book values are significantly lower, suggesting that these dual VC relationships with the acquisition parties adversely affect the acquisition negotiation process from the viewpoint of other target investors.  \n\nExamining acquisitions of firms backed by CVCs, we find that acquirers experience relatively higher announcement returns. This evidence is consistent with CVCs having relatively weaker financial incentives to bear venture investment risks and strong strategic objectives that can conflict with the financial interests of other target investors, including entrepreneurs. Thus, CVCs can willingly sacrifice financial returns on their venture investments to support CVC parents’ strategic objectives, which results in higher acquirer wealth gains.  \n\nIn summary, we find that acquisitions of VC-backed targets lead to significantly larger acquirer announcement returns of $2\\%$ to $4\\%$ compared to non-VCbacked targets. This difference can be partially explained by conflicts of interest between classes of VCs and other portfolio investors due to i) VC fund liquidity pressures, ii) VC financial ties to acquirers, and ii) strategic objectives and greater risk aversion of CVC parents. We conclude that VCs do not always act in the best interests of all target shareholders. Like other financial intermediaries, VCs can have conflicts of interest with other investors in their portfolio companies. Our findings add to the IPO evidence in Lee and Wahal (2004) that VCs can have perverse incentives to accept lower values for their portfolio companies when they are exiting their private equity investments.  \n\n## Appendix.
