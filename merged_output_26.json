I examine the effects of venture capital backing on the corporate governance of the entrepreneurial firm at the time of transition from private to public ownership. Using a selection model framework that instruments for venture backing with variations in the supply of venture capital, I conduct three sets of tests comparing corporate governance in venture- and non-venture-backed initial public offering (IPO) firms. Venture-backed firms have lower levels of earnings management, more positive reactions to the adoption of shareholder rights agreements, and more independent board structures than similar non-venture-backed firms, consistent with better governance. These effects are not common to all pre-IPO large shareholders.  \n\nJEL Classification: G24, G34  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nTraditional economic theories largely view the entrepreneurial firm’s transition from private to public ownership as a graduation date when all companies, regardless of prior financing and influences, are subject to the same rules and pressures of the public market. This literature often assumes that entrepreneurs, as principals, establish governance structures at the time a firm first enters the public markets to minimize the agency costs that arise from the separation of ownership and control (Jensen and Meckling, 1976; Grossman and Hart, 1988; Zingales, 1995). Such theories imply that similar firms should have similar governance structures at initial public offering (IPO), regardless of pre-IPO financing or intermediation.  \n\nMore recent studies, however, suggest that moral hazard problems may be an issue at the time of IPO. For example, Brennan and Franks (1997) argue that entrepreneurs take steps at the time of IPO to ensure continuation of their private benefits of control once the firm's stock is traded on public markets. Klausner and Daines (2001) find that anti-takeover provisions are common in IPO-stage charters and that these anti-takeover provisions cannot be explained by efficiency theories, save the preservation of private benefits of control. Similarly, Field and Karpoff (2002) find that many firms deploy takeover defenses at the time of IPO and that this effect is particularly strong when oversight from non-managerial shareholders is weak. These findings suggest that agency costs are important even for entrepreneurial firms that reach the IPO stage and suggest that the involvement of financial intermediaries in the entrepreneurial firm pre-IPO may be able to play a role in mitigating the extent to which entrepreneurs entrench themselves or preserve their control benefits at the time of public offering.  \n\nIn this paper, I examine the effect of the presence of a particular financial intermediary on the resulting governance structures put in place at the time of IPO: the venture capitalist (VC). Considerable pre-IPO evidence suggests that VCs may play a governance role in their portfolio firms. Kaplan and Stromberg (2003) document that VCs negotiate complex control rights at the time of their investment and put into place extensive monitoring and advisory systems. Hellmann and Puri (2002) indicate that VCs play a role in CEO turnover. Gompers (1995) and Lerner (1995) provide evidence of a VC monitoring function.  \n\nWhile many studies of financial intermediaries model the VC as a provider of funds and services to entrepreneurs, with the VC exiting and ending their involvement at the time of IPO, empirically it is well known that VCs retain substantial equity stakes for significant periods of time after their portfolio companies go public, ranging from the length of the typical lockup period of 180 days to many years postIPO (Barry, Muscarella, and Vetsuypens, 1990). At the same time, studies of VC contracts (Kaplan and Stromberg, 2003; Kaplan et al., 2007) indicate that VCs generally give up their excess control rights at the time the firm goes public. Both the VC's compensation and their ability to raise further funds are dependent on their investment returns. These returns, the key measure used by limited partners (LPs) to determine VC fund performance, are determined by the share price at the time the VCs sell or distribute their stake in their portfolio firms. As a result, VCs have incentives to ensure that optimal governance systems are in place in their portfolio firms at the time the firm goes public in order to ensure the preservation of the value of their investment until their positions have been unwound and their profits booked.  \n\nTo examine whether VCs have an effect on the resulting governance structure of the IPO firm, I conduct three sets of tests comparing governance- and monitoringrelated variables for venture- and non-venture-backed firms. Ideally, this issue would be examined using a comprehensive database of governance measures such as the Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC) data described in Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick (2003). However, the IRRC provides data only on companies drawn from the Standard & Poor's 500 as well as the annual lists of the largest corporations in the publications of Fortune, Forbes and Business Week. As no similarly comprehensive public database of governance measures exists for young IPO firms, I instead take a three-pronged approach. First, I examine a symptom of weak governance at the firm. Second, I examine the market's perception of governance at the firm. Third, I examine a set of directly observable governance structures.  \n\nAs a symptom of weak governance at the firm, I compare the extent to which firms manage earnings and whether they employ conservative or aggressive accounting. To deduce the market's perception of shareholder protection and governance at the firm, I look at how the market reacts when the firm announces the adoption of a shareholder rights agreement (SRA). If management is acting as a perfect agent of shareholders, rights plans can be used to further shareholder interests by forcing bidders to negotiate higher takeover premiums or by reducing the threat of a hostile takeover, thus allowing the firm to employ more efficient performancebased deferred compensation contracts. Alternatively, if governance is weak, rights agreements can be used to entrench management and ward off value-increasing takeovers. The markets’ reaction to adoption of a plan can be taken as an indication of how the market regards the governance of the firm. I then look directly at observable characteristics ofthe boards of directors of the sample firms at the time of IPO. I examine board composition, audit and compensation committee composition, and CEO/chairman duality. More independent board structures contribute to better monitoring of management and decision making that follows shareholder interests.  \n\nIdentifying differences in governance structures and related measures between venture- and non-venture-backed firms is nontrivial. To identify causal effects, I must first address the fact that the choice of which firms receive venture funding ex ante is endogenous. Venture firms select portfolio companies and entrepreneurs based on a wide variety of preferred characteristics, and some of these characteristics may later effect how the entrepreneur chooses to govern his firm. Omitted variable bias is also a concern, as the amount of information on firm characteristics that can be included as direct controls in the models is limited. The tests therefore employ a binary treatment model approach that attempts to control for both the endogeneity of venture financing and omitted variable concerns. The treatment models use instrumental variables related to the supply of venture capital at the time the entrepreneurial companies are first founded, which are unlikely to be related to governance structures at the time of IPO some five to seven years later.  \n\nThe results of the three analyses are consistent with VCs producing stronger corporate governance in the startup companies they fund. Venture backing indeed appears to reduce the level of earnings management in the firm at IPO, as proxied for by discretionary accruals. Venture-backed firms are more likely to be “conservative” and are less likely to be “aggressive” in terms of earnings management than similar non-venture-backed firms. Furthermore, venture-backed firms experience significantly higher abnormal returns upon the announcement of the adoption of an SRA than do non-venture-backed firms. The wealth effect at the announcement is positive for venture-backed firms but is not so for non-venture-backed firms, suggesting that venture-backed firms are more likely to use the rights agreements to protect shareholder interests. Finally, venture-backed firms have more independent board structures at the time of IPO. Venture-backed firms have a higher proportion of outsiders on their board and a lower proportion of insiders? than do similar non-- venture-backed firms. Their boards are less likely to be insider dominated, and they are less likely to have a dual CEO/chairman. Furthermore, venture-backed firms tend to have more independent audit and compensation committee structures.  \n\nControlling for the endogeneity of venture financing using the selection model increases, rather than decreases, the magnitude of the effect of venture backing on governance measures. While the binary treatment framework (or any instrumental variables approach) cannot provide a perfect control for the endogeneity problem in the absence of a natural experiment, these patterns are encouraging and suggest that the documented effects are not solely the result of ex ante selection. Furthermore, the estimates from the selection models suggest that if selection occurs, it is such that VCs select firms whose (unobservable) characteristics made them less likely ex ante to be well governed if left to their own devices. One possible explanation for these findings is that venture capital firms may be selecting entrepreneurs who have a certain degree of overconfidence or aggressiveness or that entrepreneurs with these qualities are more likely to seek VC funding in the first place. These qualities can contribute in both positive and negative fashions to the management of an entrepreneurial business. The VC may be interested in harnessing the positive aspects of these characteristics, while remaining aware of the need to rein in the negative aspects.  \n\nAn additional item of interest is whether these effects are VC specific or merely common to all large shareholders. I find evidence that other types of large pre-IPO shareholders, namely corporate and angel investors, do not have the same significant effects on governance that VCs have. Thus, it appears that the VC, with his hands-on active involvement in the pre-IPO stage, may have a greater effect on post-IPO governance than do other types of pre-IPO large shareholders, consistent with differences in the incentives and involvement of different types of pre-IPO financial intermediaries and investors.  \n\nThe contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, the paper contributes to an emerging body of literature on governance in newly public firms. While there is a large body of literature examining corporate governance practices in established firms, there have been relatively few studies addressing the nature of corporate governance mechanisms in newly public firms or entrepreneurial firms in general. Other papers in this vein include Klausner and Daines (2004), who examine the governance of spinoff firms and equity carve-outs, and Klausner and Daines (2001) and Field and Karpoff (2002), who examine takeover defenses in IPO firms. The results of this study are consistent with the existence of moral hazard problems at the time of IPO, as suggested by Brennan and Franks (1997) and Field and Karpoff (2002), and suggests one possible source of the observed heterogeneity in the governance structures of IPO firms.  \n\nSecond, this study contributes to the body of literature examining the role that financial intermediaries play in the building of entrepreneurial firms. Prior evidence on the value-added role of the VC has largely been related to the pre-IPO development stage of the firm (Hellmann and Puri, 2000, 2002; Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu 2007; Lindsey, 2008). Other related studies on venture capital in the preIPO stage include Kaplan and Stromberg (2003, 2004), whose findings regarding venture capital contracting in the ex ante stage are complementary to my findings on governance effects ex post.  \n\nAdditional work examines the monitoring function of venture capital in the pre-IPO stage (see, e.g., Gompers, 1995; Lerner, 1995); however, these papers use samples that contain only venture-backed firms. Consequentially, they rely on changes over time and differences within venture-backed firms as opposed to differences between venture- and non-venture-backed firms. Closer to this study is the work of Baker and Gompers (2003), who examine the role of venture capital in board size and composition at the time of IPO, considering both as the outcome of a bargain between the CEO and outside shareholders. The findings in this paper reconfirm effects documented in their study and expand upon them with a broad study of other board characteristics as well as other indicators that shed light on the governance of the firm.  \n\nFinally, my results shed light on the uniqueness of VCs as financial intermediaries relative to other pre-IPO large stakeholders. Other large shareholders, such as corporate and angel investors, do appear to influence the governance of the entrepreneurial firm in the same fashion as VCs. My findings add further evidence as to the importance of the active involvement and control rights characteristic of VC investments for maximizing resulting portfolio company value.  \n\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and methodology used in the study. Section 3 examines a symptom of weak governance: earnings management. Section 4 examines market reactions to the announcement of the adoption of an SRA by venture- and non-venture-backed IPO firms. Section 5 looks at the characteristics of the boards of directors of the two sets of firms. Section 6 examines whether the documented effects are VC specific or a more general large shareholder effect. Section 7 concludes.  \n\n## 2. Data and Methodology  \n\nThe initial sample used for this study consists of 2,827 IPOs taking place in the years $1983-1994^{4}$ , obtained from the Securities Data Corporation (SDC) Global New Issues database. To be included in the sample, an IPO firm must meet the following criteria: (i) the offer price is at least 5 dollars; (i) the IPO proceeds are at least 1 million dollars; (ii) the issue is listed on the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) tapes within 3 months of the issue; and (iv) the issue is not a reverse Leveraged Buyout (LBO), the IPO of a financial or financial-services firm (SIC code 6000-6999), a unit issue, a real-estate investment trust, or a corporate spinoff or equity carve-out. The CRSP database is used to identify the market capitalization of the firm, based on first closing price for the issue and the number of shares outstanding.  \n\nDescriptive statistics for the sample are presented in Panel A of Table I. Of the 2,827 firms in the sample, 1,041 are identified as venture-backed firms by the SDC. The proportion of venture-backed firms in the sample varies over time. Thirty percent of the 1983 IPOs received venture capital financing. The percentage of venture-backed firms remains in the mid- to high twenties until 1988, when it rises back to $30\\%$ . In 1989 and 1990, the percentage of venture-backed firms is roughly $40\\%$ and the percentage peaks in 1991, with $52\\%$ of the firms venture backed, falling over time to $36\\%$ in 1994.  \n\nThe mean firm size for the overall sample is $\\$132$ million. Venture-backed IPOs are larger, with a mean market capitalization of $\\$154$ million versus $\\$119$ million for non-venture-backed firms. IPO gross proceeds are obtained from SDC. The mean IPO proceeds for the overall sample is $\\$23.4$ million. The mean proceeds for venture-backed firms (\\$25.4 million) is only slightly higher than for non-venture-backed firms ( $\\$23.2$ million).  \n\nThe financial accounting data and earnings data used in earnings management tests are collected from the Compustat industrial firm annual files and archives. I  \n\nPanel A presents summary statistics for the full sample of firms undertaking an IPO in the years 1983-1994, excluding REITs, unit issues, reverse LBOs, spinoffs, firms with proceeds under $\\$1$ million, firms with an offer price of less than $\\$5$ , financial firms (SIC code 6—), and those firms that are not listed on the CRSP tapes within 3 months of the offer date. Size is computed as market capitalization on the first day of listing on CRSP tapes. Discretionary accruals are calculated using the cross-sectional version of the modified Jones (1991) model following the description in Appendix A. A firm is defined as having “aggressive accounting”’ practices if its level of discretionary accruals places it in the top decile of discretionary accruals for all firms in Compustat in that year. A firm is defined as having “conservative accounting’ practices if its level of discretionary accruals places it in the bottom decile of discretionary accruals for all firms in Compustat in that year. Panel B presents summary statistics for the 1994 subsample for which board characteristics were hand collected from SEC filings. This sample includes 232 frms that conducted an IPO in 1994 and were listed on CRSP within 3 months of the offer date. The sample excludes REITs, unit issues, closed end funds, ADRs, reverse LBOs, spinoffs and equity carve-outs, and financial frms SIC one-digit code 6). IPOs with an offer price less than 1 dollar per share or with total proceeds less than 1 milion dollars are also excluded from the sample. Data are collected from SEC filings of prospectuses. Market capitalization is calculated from CRSP data on the first day of listing  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"3\">All issues</td><td colspan=\"3\">Venture backed</td><td

Sloan, 1996) and calculate accruals as changes in the working capital accounts from the balance sheet:?  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathrm{ACC}_{t,i}=\\Delta\\mathrm{CA}_{t,i}-\\Delta\\mathrm{CL}_{t,i}-\\mathrm{DEP}_{t,i}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$\\Delta\\mathrm{CA}_{t,i}$ is the change in noncash current assets or the sum of accounts receivable, inventories, and other miscellaneous assets. I calculate $\\Delta\\mathrm{CA}_{t,i}$ by taking the change in current total assets (Compustat Item 4) and subtracting from it the change in cash (Item 1). $\\Delta\\mathrm{CL}_{t,i}$ is the change in current liabilities not due to short-term debt and taxes payable, which is given by the change in total current liabilities (Item 5) minus the change in debt in current liabilities (Item 34) minus the change in income taxes payable (Item 71). Finally, DEP is depreciation and amortization (Item 14).  \n\nTo obtain discretionary accruals for the IPO sample, I employ the Compustat industrial firm annual files and archives. I use the Fama-French 48-industry classification and omit industry-years which do not contain at least seven firm observations for the accruals decomposition regression. Following the description in Appendix A, I create a database of annual discretionary accruals for all firms in the Compustat universe for the fiscal years 1980-1996, using the cross-sectional version of the modified Jones (1991) model. The sample of IPOs is matched to this database by CUSIP identifiers.  \n\nTo be included in the IPO year earnings management sample, firms must have data available in Compustat for the fiscal year prior to the IPO, as well as the fiscal year ofthe IPO. A total of 1,798 firms from the initial sample have data available for both years. Of these, 768 are venture backed and the remaining 1,030 are non-venture-backed proportions that are similar to those of the full initial sample of firms. As a robustness check and to ensure that the estimates are not unduly influenced by outliers, I follow Teoh, Welch, and Wong (1998a) and others in the accounting literature and winsorize the discretionary accruals data at the 1st and 99th percentile. All reported results are robust to other choices of winsorization cutoffs.  \n\nSummary statistics for the level of discretionary accruals are presented in Panel A of Table I. For the full sample of firms with for whom the requisite accounting data are available, the mean level of (scaled) discretionary accruals is 0.0682 or $6.82\\%$ of firm assets. For the venture-backed firms, the mean is $3.24\\%$ of firm assets, whereas for the non-venture-backed firms, the mean level of discretionary accrualsis $9.49\\%$ of firm assets. In the full sample, $27.6\\%$ of the firms have discretionary accruals that place them in an “aggressive accounting\"” group in the fiscal year of the IPO, defined by having a level of discretionary accruals in the top decile of discretionary accruals for all firms in Compustat for that year. For non-venturebacked firms, this percentage is $30.1\\%$ , and for venture-backed firms, it is $4.0\\%$ .6 Additionally, $13.3\\%$ of the firms in the full sample fall into a “conservative accounting” group, defined as having a level of discretionary accruals in the bottom decile of discretionary accruals for all firms in Compustat for that year. For the nonventure-backed firms, the proportion falling into the conservative bucket is roughly $11\\%$ , similar to the population as a whole. For the venture-backed firms, the proportion is $16.4\\%$ , and the difference between the two is significant at the $1\\%$ level.  \n\nData on adoption of SRAs are initially collected from the SDC poison pill database for all firms in the initial sample. The SDC database provides an announcement date for each firm. Each announcement date is verified by hand collecting press release and media announcement dates from LexisNexis and newswire services for each firm in the initial sample.7 I am unable to verify any announcement date for a number of firms in the sample. For four other firms, some evidence can be found in related media coverage about the firm or its business partners that indicates that an SRA had been adopted but a specific announcement date cannot be located. Both these sets of firms are excluded from the analysis. I use the hand-collected announcement dates for all tests. The final sample consists of 170 firms that adopt an SRA within 3 years of the IPO date, for whom returns are available in CRSP and for whom an announcement date could be located and verified.  \n\nUsing SEC filings from the Thomson Financial Global Access database, detailed data are hand collected on firm, CEO, and board characteristics for 232 firms that conducted their IPO in the year 1994.8 For the remainder of this paper, I refer to this group of firms as the 1994 subsample. For each firm, data are collected from the IPO prospectus and subsequent proxy reports. I collect data on firm characteristics at the time of the IPO from the prospectus. I identify the year in which the firm was first incorporated or founded and the state in which the firm is incorporated. I further collect data on CEO characteristics. I identified CEO age, CEO tenure, and whether the CEO is a founder of the firm. Additionally, I collect data on board and board committee characteristics. Using the biographical information presented in the prospectus, in addition to the information on consulting and business transactions provided in the Certain Transactions section of the prospectus, I classify board members into three categories. I classify as outsiders all board members who have neither any affiliation with nor provide business services to the company. This excludes full- or part-time employees of the company; former employees and family members of employees; all of whom are classified as insiders; and lawyers, bankers, consultants, and any others that have substantial business ties to the firm, who are classified as grey directors.° I record the number of board members in each category, and the number of board committee members in each category.  \n\nFor venture-backed firms, I collect data for each VC who invested in the firm and who had at least one representative on the board. I used the prospectus sections on Principal Shareholders, Certain Transactions, and the biographical information for the directors to identify possible VC candidates. I then identified the candidates as VCs using Pratt's Guide to Venture Capital Sources, Venture Economics, and Internet resources. I record the venture firm name, the year in which the VC first had a representative on the board, the total number of VCs on the board, and the percentage of firm stock held by the VC before the IPO and immediately post-IPO. For non-venture-backed firms, similar data are recorded for “active” pre-IPO large shareholders who are not employees or founders of the firm. A shareholder was considered an “active” large shareholder if he owns a $5\\%$ Or greater stake in the firm pre-IPO and has board representation. For each pre-IPO large shareholder, I also identify the nature of the shareholder (corporate, individual/angel, etc.).  \n\nFor the 1994 subsample, where the VC name is available, I use three proxies for venture firm experience. First, for every VC in the Venture Economics database, I obtain data on the vintage year of each of the firm's funds. From these data, I calculate the number of funds that the VC firm has raised since its inception by 1994, the IPO year for the firms in the subsample. Second, I identify the earlier of the inception year or the first fund vintage year as the founding year for the VC and used this to calculate VC firm age in the year 1994. Third, I obtain data on the number of portfolio firm IPOs for each VC in each year since inception and calculate the cumulative number of portfolio firm IPOs for the VC firm in 1994 since inception. I then hand match the experience proxies to the IPO firm subsample by venture firm name. I record the experience proxy for the VC firm that has had the longest presence on the IPO firm's board of directors, as well as the most experienced VC, and the average for all VC firms with board representation.  \n\nPanel B of Table I presents summary statistics for the 232 firms in the 1994 subsample for whom detailed information is hand collected from firm prospectuses. The table presents summary statistics for a variety of board composition, board committee, CEO, and firm characteristics. Venture-backed firms comprise a slightly higher proportion $(46\\%)$ of the firms in the subsample than in the full sample of firms described above. As is the case for the full sample, venture-backed firms in the subsample are larger on average than non-venture-backed firms. The mean venture-backed firm has a market capitalization of $\\$146$ million versus $\\$110$ million for non-venture-backed firms. The mean board size, six directors, is about half that of the mean board size documented by studies of established firms (see, e.g., Yermack, 1997). Board size is similar for both the venture- and non-venture-backed firms.  \n\n### 2.1 METHODOLOGY ANDINSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES  \n\nThe primary concern in comparing governance structures and related outcomes for venture- and non-venture-backed firms is the endogeneity of which firms receive venture backing ex ante. Even if venture backing has no effect on corporate governance, we may observe a significant point estimate on the VC variable in the models if the firms that receive venture backing are inherently different than those firms who do not receive venture funding and therefore less likely in the first place to engage in the behavior under examination. On the extreme end, we may be concerned that better governed firms choose to be VC backed in the first place or are selected by VCs because they are better governed. However, in the vast majority of cases, firms seeking and receiving venture capital financing are organized as small groups of entrepreneurs, in many cases are not yet incorporated, and generally lack any type of governance structure per se. Indeed, studies such as Kaplan and Stromberg (2003) and Kaplan and Stromberg (2004) provide evidence indicating that initial governance structures are put in place only following the venture capital investment.  \n\nNevertheless, to address this concern, my models employ a selection framework that addresses the endogeneity of the binary treatment variable VC. This selection model is similar to the oft-used Heckman (1979) two-stage model, differing only in that in this setting, I observe the second-stage variable for all observations. The binary treatment model is described in detail in Greene (1997).  \n\nThe equation estimated for the first stage is a probit model, where VC is the dependent variable, and the independent variables are indicator variables for firm industry as well as exogenous variables that serve a purpose similar to the instruments in an Instrumental Variables (IV) setting. These instruments should meet the standard exclusion restriction, that is, they should be correlated with the variable of interest, VC, but uncorrelated with the governance-related dependent variables in the second stage equations.  \n\nI employ two such variables in the first stage equations. Both variables are motivated by the supply of venture capital available to firms when they are founded. First, I include an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the firm was founded prior to 1980 and 0 otherwise. The institutionalization of the VC industry is commonly dated to three events, the two final and most critical of which were the 1980 Small Business Investment Act which redefined VC fund managers as business development companies rather than investment advisers, thus lowering their regulatory burdens and the 1980 Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) “Safe Harbor” regulation which sanctioned the limited partnerships which are the dominant organizational form in the industry.1° Following these three events, the venture industry experienced enormous growth, as well as geographic expansion. Baker and Gompers (2003) use a similar indicator as an instrument for venture backing, arguing that the supply of venture capital and the proportion of firms that are venture-backed increased dramatically from 1980 onwards.  \n\nSecond, I include the volume of money (in thousands of dollars) invested by the venture capital industry in the firm's headquarter state in the year in which it was founded or first incorporated.1l This variable is motivated by the fact that when venture funds are more readily available in a startup's locale, the startup is more likely to be venture funded. As required for proper identification of the selection models, both variables are correlated with being venture backed, yet are extremely unlikely to be correlated with the ex post governance structures of the firm at the time of IPO.  \n\nThe models estimated for the second stage of the equation system have a governance-related variable on the LHS and a variety of controls in addition to the VC indicator as independent variables. The system is estimated by maximum likelihood, under the null hypothesis that the errors in the two equations, $\\upmu$ and $\\epsilon$ are correlated (see, e.g., Maddala, 1983; Greene, 1997). Standard errors are computed as per Heckman (1979).  \n\n## 3. Earnings Management  \n\nThe notion of the “quality of earnings\"—the degree to which reported earnings reffect the true operational health of a business—-has long been a concern among both academics and financial practitioners. Under the accruals-based accounting system defined by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), firms are allowed considerable latitude in constructing their financial statements; merely changing from one set of legitimate accounting techniques to another can alter reported earmings considerably.12  \n\nReported earnings are the sum of cash flows from operations and accounting adjustments called accruals. Positive accruals imply that the firm is recording earnings that are larger than the cash flow generated by its operations. Beneish (2001) argues that if earnings are managed, it is most likely to occur in the accrual (rather than cash flow) component of earnings. This earnings management can occur through a variety of managerial choices. For example, switching from one set of depreciation schedules to another, delaying the recognition of expenses, and accelerating the recognition of revenues, while all legitimate, can generate positive accruals and boost earnings.  \n\nAccruals are not, however, in and of themselves, prima facie evidence of earnings management. GAAP require firms, even those who seek to present transparent and informative financial statements, to record certain assets and liabilities in such a way that generates accruals. Additionally, cyclical variation in a firm's industry or changes in its lines of business alter the firm's working capital needs and generate positive accruals that are not due to earnings management.  \n\nDetecting earnings management requires a model to separate the nondiscretionary component of accruals from the discretionary component. The former represents the portion of accruals that is required under GAAP, while the latter is the portion of accruals that is due to managerial discretion. Dechow, Sloan, and Sweeney (1996) and Guay, Kothari, and Watts (1996) compare various models of discretionary accruals and conclude that a modified version of the Jones (1991) model is the most statistically powerful model for detecting earnings management. Subsequent authors adopt the modified Jones (1991) model as the discretionary accruals model of choice, and I follow this convention.  \n\nThere is considerable empirical evidence of earnings management. Bagnoli and Watts (2000) suggest that relative performance evaluation leads firms to manage earnings if they expect competitors to do so. Similar arguments are found in Erickson and Wang (1999) in the context of mergers and Shivakumar (2000) in the context of seasoned equity offerings. Incentives for managing earnings upwards include raising stock prices prior to seasoned equity offerings (Rangan, 1998; Teoh, Welch, and Wong, 1998a), at IPOs (Teoh, Welch, and Wong, 1998b; DuCharme and Sefcik, 2001), and before stock-financed acquisitions (Erickson and Wang, 1999). Additionally, managers may raise earnings to meet analysts? expectations (Kasznik, 1997; DeGeorge, Patel, and Zeckhauser, 1999; Burgstahler and Eames, 2006), to avoid debt covenant violations (DeFond and Jiambalvo, 1994; Parker, 2000), or to smooth earnings. According to former SEC chairman Arthur Levitt,13 earnings management is a widespread phenomenon among public companies under pressure to meet analyst expectations.  \n\nThe costs of earnings management to investors are significant. Chan et al. (2006) find that firms with “conservative” earnings management, or \"high earnings quality,\" have annual returns that are significantly greater than those of “low earnings quality\" or “aggressive\" earnings management firms. Teoh, Welch, and Wong (1998b) find that issuers in the most “aggressive” quartile of IPO firms have a 3-year after-market stock return of about $20\\%$ less than issuers in the most “conservative” quartile.14  \n\nIn much of the accounting literature, income increasing, or “aggressive,” earnings management is taken as a possible symptom of weak or problematic governance in firms. I begin by examining the level of discretionary accruals in the fiscal year of the IPO for venture- and non-venture-backed firms. As per Teoh, Welch, and Wong (1998a), higher discretionary accruals are considered to be “aggressive,” while lower discretionary accruals are considered to be “conservative.” As described in Section 2, in the univariate, the mean level of (scaled) discretionary accruals is 0.0682 or $6.82\\%$ of firm assets. For venture-backed firms, the mean is $3.24\\%$ of firm assets, whereas for non-venture-backed firms, the mean level of discretionary accruals is $9.49\\%$ of firm assets. The difference between the mean level of discretionary accruals for the venture- and non-venture-backed firms is $6.25\\%$ of firm assets and is significant at the $1\\%$ level. To control for factors that may make firms pre-disposed to manage earnings upwards, I estimate the following model:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\mathrm{DACC}_{i}=\\beta_{\\mathrm{vc}}\\mathrm{VC}_{i}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{sz}}\\mathrm{SZ}_{i}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{bm}}\\mathrm{BM}_{i}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{lev}}\\mathrm{LEV}_{i}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{ibx}}\\mathrm{SAIBX}_{i}}\\ &{\\mathrm{~~+~}\\beta_{\\mathrm{seo}}\\mathrm{SEO}_{i}+\\Gamma^{\\prime}Y_{i}+\\Theta^{\\prime}I N D_{i}+\\epsilon_{i},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere DACC is the level of discretionary accruals for the firm in the fiscal year of IPO, VC is an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the firm is venture backed and Ootherwise, $Y$ are fixed effects for the fiscal year in which the IPO took place, and IND are industry fixed effects (one-digit SIC codes). SZ is the log of firm market capitalization (in millions of dollars) on the first day of listing on the CRSP tapes. On the one hand, larger firms with more complex financial statements may be more able to exploit latitude in accounting standards to manage earnings. Conversely, larger firms may also have reduced opportunity to exercise accounting discretion since they are more likely to be scrutinized by security analysts. BM is the firm's book-to-market ratio, calculated as the ratio of book equity at the beginning of the fiscal year (Compustat Item 60 plus Item 74) to market capitalization on the first day of listing. Higher growth firms may be more likely to experience high discretionary accruals, especially if the decomposition model contains some measure of imprecision. LEV is the firm's leverage ratio at the beginning of the fiscal year, calculated as $1-(\\mathrm{BOOK})$ TA), or one minus the ratio of book value of equity at the beginning of the fiscal year to total assets of the firm at the beginning of the fiscal year. The leverage ratio controls for the documented tendency of firms to manage earnings upwards in order to avoid violation of debt covenants. S△IBX is the change in income before extraordinary items (Item 18) from the previous fiscal year to this year, scaled by the total assets of the firm at the beginning of the fiscal year. Dechow, Sloan, and Sweeney (1995) suggest that tests of earnings management may be misspecified if discretionary accruals are correlated with firm performance. Finally, SEO is an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the firm conducts a seasoned equity offering in the following fiscal year, as firms may manage earnings upwards prior to a seasoned equity offering. Data on SEO dates are obtained from SDC.  \n\nThe first column of Table II presents the results of the estimation of Equation (2) for the firm's IPO fiscal year. The coefficient on VC is a negative $5.2\\%$ of firm assets and is significant at the $1\\%$ level. The loadings on the control variables are signed as expected. The coeffcient on SZ is negative and significant, indicating that the larger the firm, the lower the level of discretionary accruals. This suggests that the added scrutiny applied to larger firms outweighs any added likelihood of exploiting accounting latitude for these firms. As expected, the coefficient on BM is negative and significant, and the coefficient on SAIBX is positive and significant. The coefficients on LEV and SEO are also positive, as expected, but are not significant. Column 2 of the table reestimates this model using a Fama-McBeth panel regression framework. The results are qualitatively similar: the loading on VC remains negative and significant and is a slightly larger $6.5\\%$ of firm assets. The signs of the coefficients on the control variables remain the same, except for the sign on LEV, which reverses, but is not significant.15  \n\nNeither the fixed effects regression model nor the Fama-McBeth approach, however, address the endogeneity problem that arises from the selection issue of who receives venture capital in the first place. To address this concern, I reestimate Equation (2) using the selection framework described in Section 2.1. The results of the estimation of Equation 2 under the two-equation treatment model framework are presented in the third column of Table II. If the loading on VC documented above was attributable (even in part) to selection (i.e., firms that receive venture capital were ex ante less likely to manage earnings upwards), we would expect the correlation between the errors, $\\rho$ , to be negative and the estimate of the coefficient on VC to be reduced in magnitude. However, as can be seen from the table, the estimate of $\\rho$ is positive and the coefficient on VC grows in magnitude to $-17.8\\%$ of firm assets and remains significant. The Wald test statistic for the null hypothesis of $\\rho=0$ is significant and rejects the null at the $5\\%$ level, indicating that while selection plays a part in the model, it is not selection of the nature that we may have been concerned about ex ante. The positive correlation coefficient implies that the firms that are selected to receive venture backing ex ante are those that would ex post be more likely to manage earnings upwards. The coefficients on the control variables remain close to their levels in the fixed effects estimation in the first column of the table, with similar significance.  \n\nThese results might be considered surprising. As mentioned above, a “naive\" selection story in this context might be that VCs select the “best\" entrepreneurs and that best also includes entrepreneur characteristics “most honest” or “most likely to serve shareholder interests,” or perhaps “most willing to give up control. \" One possible interpretation of this result is that the term “best\" to the VC also  \n\nThis table presents the results of regression analysis of the level of earnings management in IPO firms, proxied for by the firm's discretionary accruals. All models test for the difference in the level of earnings management between venture- and non-venture-backed firms. The first set of tests uses a regression model with fixed effects for IPO year and industry. The second set of tests uses Fama-McBeth regressions. The third set of tests applies a treatment model to the fixed effects regressions in the first set of tests to control for the endogeneity of venture backing. The dependent variable in all tests is the level of discretionary accruals for the firm, based on the cross-sectional version of the modified Jones (1991) model for decomposition of accounting accruals into their expected and abnormal parts (a full description of the construction of the discretionary accruals can be found in Section 2 and Appendix A). The control variables in all tests are the log of the market capitalization of the firm (log size), the firm book-to-market ratio, leverage ratio, the change in earnings (income before extraordinary items) from the previous fiscal year, scaled by the total assets of the firm, and an indicator variable that takes the value 1 if the firm undertakes a seasoned equity offering in the following fiscal year. Results are presented for the fiscal year of the offering (i.e., the fiscal year during which the IPO took place), which includes both pre-IPO and post-IPO months, and for the fiscal year following the IPO. The coefficients on the IPO year and industry fixed effects are not reported for the sake of brevity. The independent variables in the selection equation of the treatment model are the dollar amount invested by the VC industry in the firm's headquarters state in the year of founding (as proxied for by the year 7 years prior to IPO) in millions of dollars, and industry indicator variables. As the VC investment amounts are not available prior to 1980, the 1980 data are used for allfirms whose founding year proxy is prior to 1980, and an indicator variable taking the value 1 ifthe firm founding year proxy is prior to 1980 and0 otherwise, is also included. All tests use White (1980) heteroskedasticity-consistent robust standard errors. \\*, $^{**}$ , and $^{***}$ denote significance at the $10\\%$ $5\\%$ and $1\\%$ levels (for a two-sided test), respectively.  \n\nTable II.

These two qualities can have both positive and negative effects on how an entrepreneur manages his business. The VC may wish to harness the positive aspects of these characteristics of the entrepreneur and be aware of the need to rein in the negative aspects, such as the tendency to manage earnings upwards. Alternatively, from the perspective of the entrepreneur choosing to seek venture capital financing, more aggressive entrepreneurs may be more likely to seek venture financing in the first place.  \n\nOne concern that the binary treatment model addresses, in the context of VC in particular, is the lack of data on the characteristics of the private firms at the time they seek out funding save location and industry (economic interpretation of the treatment model precludes us from using ex post firm characteristics in the selection equation, as these are likely influenced by venture backing). As a result, I rely on the model to capture the effects of those unobservables that affect both ex ante selection and ex post governance. That said, the binary treatment model (or any instrumental variables approach), while commonly used to control for endogeneity in the corporate finance setting in the absence of a natural experiment, cannot provide a perfect control for endogeneity. Nonetheless, the results from treatment model are encouraging and suggest that the observed effect of VC backing on discretionary accruals levels are unlikely to be solely the result of ex ante selection.  \n\nObviously, all tests performed using discretionary accruals data are, in effect, joint tests of the discretionary accruals model and of the hypotheses of interest. However, even if the modified Jones model does not capture earning management in its fullest, it likely provides, at a minimum, directionally useful data that can point to aggressive and conservative accounting practices. I identify the top decile of $\\mathrm{DACC}_{t,i}$ for all firms in the Compustat universe in fiscal year $t$ as “aggressive accounting” and the bottom decile of $\\mathrm{DACC}_{t,i}$ for all firms in the Compustat universe in fiscal year $t$ as “conservative accounting.\" I define two indicator variables, AGRS and CNSRV, that take the value 1 if the firm falls into the aggressive or conservative group, respectively, and O otherwise. In the full sample, $27.6\\%$ of firms have discretionary accruals that place them in the aggressive group in the fiscal year of the IPO. For non-venture-backed firms, this percentage is $30.1\\%$ and for venture-backed firms, it is $24.0\\%$ . The difference in the percentages of the venture- and non-venture-backed sample falling into the aggressive group is roughly $6.1\\%$ and is significant at the $1\\%$ level. Additionally, $13.3\\%$ of the firms in the full sample fall into the conservative accounting group (versus $10.0\\%$ of the entire population of all firms, by construction). For the non-venture-backed firms, the proportion falling into the conservative bucket is roughly $11\\%$ , similar to the population as a whole. For the venture-backed firms, the proportion is $16.4\\%$ , and the difference between the two is significant at the $1\\%$ level. These univariate differences are consistent with the hypothesis that venture-backed firms are more likely to fall into the conservative accounting practices group and are less likely to fall into the aggressive accounting practices group.  \n\nTo confirm that these results are not attributable to other confounding issues and factors, I also analyze the variables AGRS and CNSRV in a probit framework. Table IlI presents the results of probit analyses of the two variables. I include the control variables used in Equation (2). The estimates from a naive probit analysis of AGRS (not adjusting for selection) are presented in the first column of the table. The loading on VC is $-0.17$ and is significant at the $5\\%$ level. Holding all other variables at their mean, this corresponds to a reduction of 0.054 in the probability of falling into the aggressive accounting group for venture-backed firms relative to non-venture-backed firms. The sign and significance levels on the control variables remain similar to the analysis of levels of DACC. Column 2 presents the estimates for the probit model under the binary treatment framework, which in this case reduces to a bivariate, seemingly unrelated probit setting (see Maddala, 1983; Greene, 1997 for a detailed description). Once again, the estimate of the correlation coefficient $\\rho$ is positive, suggesting that the reduction in the probability that venture-backed firms fall into the aggressive accounting group is underestimated by the univariate probit model. While the estimate of $\\rho$ is not significant, the loading on VC under the treatment model grows to $-0.69$ , corresponding to a reduction of 0.23 in the probability that a venture-backed firm will fall into the aggressive accounting group, when all other variables are held at their means.  \n\nThe estimates from the naive probit analysis of CNSRV are presented in the third column of the table. Here, the coeffcient on VC is a positive 0.2182 and is significant athe $1\\%$ level, corresponding to an increase of 0.043 in the probability of being in the conservative accounting group for a venture-backed firm relative to a non-venturebacked firm, holding all other variables at their mean. Column 4 presents the estimates of the treatment model for CNSRV. Here, the estimate of the correlation coefficient is negative (as expected, based on the positive correlation with aggressiveness) and is significant at the $5\\%$ level. The loading on VC increases to 0.96, corresponding to an increase of 0.12 in the probability of being in the conservative accounting group for a venture-backed firm when all other variables are held at their means.16  \n\nTwo alternative explanations for these results remain to be ruled out. As total accruals are reverting in nature, it is possible that the lower levels of discretionary accruals observed for venture-backed firms in the year of the IPO incorporate some reversion of the discretionary accruals from the previous, pre-IPO year, due to  \n\nThis table presents the results of probit analysis of the aggressive and conservative earnings management in IPO frms. The dependent variable in the first set of tests is an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the firm's level of discretionary accruals falls into the highest decile of discretionary accruals for all Compustat firms in that fiscal year (aggressive earnings management) and O otherwise. The dependent variable in the second set of tests is an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the firm's level of discretionary accruals falls into the lowest decile of discretionary accruals for all Compustat frms in that fiscal year (conservative earnings management) and O otherwise. The level of discretionary accruals is calculated based on the crosssectional version ofthe modified Jones (1991) model(a full description of the construction of the discretionary accruals can be found in Section 3). For each dependent variable, results are reported for both a probit model with indicators for IPO year and industry and a treatment model which controls for the endogeneity of venture backing. The control variables in alltests are the log of the market capitalization of the firm (log size), the firm book-tomarket ratio, leverage ratio, the change in earnings (income before extraordinary items) from the previous fiscal year, scaled by the total assets of the firm, and an indicator variable that takes the value 1 if the firm undertakes a seasoned equity offering in the following fiscal year. Results are presented for the fiscal year of the offering (i.e., the fiscal year during which the IPO took place), which includes both pre-IPO and post-IPO months. The coeffcients on the indicators for IPO year and industry are not reported here for the sake ofbrevity. The independent variables in the selection equation of the treatment model are the dollar amount invested by the VC industry in the firm's headquarters state in the year of founding (as proxied for by the year 7 years prior to IPO) in millions of dollars and industry indicator variables. Since the VC investment amounts are not available prior to 1980, the 1980 data are used for all frms whose founding year proxy is prior to 1980, and an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the firm founding year proxy is prior to 1980 and 0 otherwise, is also included.

A second, related, concern is that the lower levels of discretionary accruals for venture backed firms in the IPO year are due to “banking” of earnings by venture-backed firms, which may then use these accumulated accruals to manage earnings upwards in following years, as the VCs exit their investments.  \n\nIf venture-backed firms “window dress” their earnings numbers in the fiscal year prior to IPO by managing earnings upwards, some of the reversion in total accruals may be captured in the discretionary accruals of the fiscal year of the IPO. This scenario is unlikely, as VCs typically hold a considerable portion of their investments for some time after the IPO. Teoh, Welch, and Wong (1998b) find that issuers in the most “aggressive” quartile of IPO firms have a 3-year after-market stock return of about $20\\%$ less than issuers in the most “conservative”\" quartile. Thus, the benefits to the VC of “window dressing” at the IPO, only to experience significantly lower returns during the period they dispose of the bulk of their stake, is not clear. Still, to rule out this possibility, I examine the discretionary accruals in the fiscal year prior to IPO for the 186 firms for whom sufficient data are available in Compustat for the years preceding the IPO. Of these 186 firms with sufficient available data to calculate discretionary accruals, 77 are venture-backed and 109 are nonventure backed, proportions similar to those in the full sample and in the IPO fiscal year sample. I repeat the above analyses for the fiscal year prior to IPO, with qualitatively similar results. As is the case in the fiscal year of the IPO, discretionary accruals are significantly lower for venture-backed firms $\\left(-0.313\\right)$ than for nonventure-backed firms $\\left(-0.004\\right)$ . Thus, it does not appear that the lower earnings management for venture-backed firms is the result of the proxy capturing reversion in window-dressed accruals from the year preceding IPO.  \n\nSimilarly, it is possible that VC-influenced companies are “\"banking” earnings in the IPO year to produce a cushion with which to manage earnings upwards in the following fiscal year(s), prior to the VC selling or distributing his shares. While at first glance this explanation is intuitively inviting, a closer examination of the VC's situation suggests it is unlikely as well. First, VCs typically give up excess control rights, such as board control, voting control, etc., at the time of the IPO. Consequently, it is not clear how much influence the VC has on the reporting and management of earnings following the IPO. If the VCs put in place strong governance structures to protect their investment once they no longer have control rights, they may not be able to override these mechanisms in order to manage earnings at times of their choosing. Additionally, VC investment is a repeated game. VCs need to raise follow-on funds, and typically, raising these funds from existing LPs is likely to be easier than attracting new investors (Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Vissing-Jorgensen, 2010). Furthermore, one of the primary vehicles for return of capital to LPs is the distribution of shares. LPs wishing to realize cash gains must then find a vehicle to sell these large blocks of shares in the open market.17 When considering an investment in a VC's follow-on fund, LPs may recall not only the VC's officially reported return (based on the price at the time shares were distributed) but also whether these shares continued to perform well until such point that the LPs exited or whether they fell in value following their distribution due to the correction in the market as the true state of the firm is revealed in following quarters.18  \n\nTo formally rule out this alternative explanation, I repeat the above analyses of discretionary accruals for the firms in the sample for the following two fiscal years after the IPO. The results of these analyses are qualitatively similar to those of the IPO fiscal year. Thus, it does not appear that the lower earnings management for venturebacked firm in the IPO year is a result of VCs banking earnings in the IPO year and then managing earnings upwards in later years prior to exiting their investments.  \n\nThe analyses above are consistent with the argument that venture backing reduces earnings management in newly public firms. Firms with venture backing are more likely to be on the conservative end of the financial accounting scale than are similar non-venture-backed firms and are less likely to be on the aggressive end of the scale. Furthermore, when adjusting for the possible endogeneity arising from selection, these tendencies are strengthened. Firms that receive venture backing appear to be those that were more likely to have higher levels of earnings management or to engage more aggressive accounting practices in the first place.  \n\nHaving examined a set of variables that proxy for a symptom of governance problems in the firm, I next attempt to ascertain whether the market believes that the firm is likely to make decisions in the best interests of shareholders, by examining the market reaction to the announcement of the adoption of an SRA.  \n\n## 4. Wealth Effects at the Adoption of SRAs  \n\nSRAs19 are securities issued to company shareholders entitling them to special rights and privileges if the company becomes the target of a takeover bid. While there are many types of SRAs and while they vary in their potency, all SRAs increase the power of the board of directors by making non-negotiated takeovers more costly for the bidding firm.  \n\nTwo central hypotheses are routinely cited to explain the adoption of rights agreements. Typically, management cites shareholder-wealth maximization as the purpose of the rights agreement. SRAs can deter two-tier takeover bids that induce shareholders to sell their shares for a lower price. If management acts as a perfect agent of shareholders, the SRA can be used to force the bidder to negotiate a higher control premium. Moreover, by reducing the threat of a hostile takeover, the firm may be able to employ more efficient performance-based deferred compensation contracts (Knoeber, 1986).  \n\nOn the other hand, critics tend to argue that SRAs entrench current management at the expense of shareholders. Conflicts of interest in the event of a takeover may result in management employing a rights defense to ward off a value-increasing change of control. If fear of a takeover motivates management, reducing the threat of takeover should have a negative effect on share prices. If takeover defenses raise the cost of replacing inefficient management, shareholder wealth will be reduced.  \n\nThe market's reaction to the adoption of an SRA by the IPO firm can thus provide us with an indication of the market's perception of governance and shareholder protection at the firm. If governance structures in place in venture-backed firms are indeed less entrenching than those of similar non-venture-backed firms and if these firms have governance structures and policies that make them more likely to act in shareholders' best interests, then the wealth effect ofthe adoption of a rights agreement by venture-backed firms should be more positive (or less negative) than that of non-venture-backed firms.2o  \n\nI focus my analysis on the stock-market return of the firms over the 2-day period during which the adoption of the SRA is announced. This announcement period consists of the first day on which the rights agreement adoption is announced by the media and the following trading day.21 Following Malatesta and Walkling (1988) and Brickley, Coles, and Terry (1994), I calculate abnormal returns over the announcement period on the basis of a market model. Denote by $R_{j t}$ the return to stock $j$ , measured over the tth 2-day interval, and by $R_{m t}$ the market index return over the same period. Under the market model, the 2-day abnormal stock return is calculated as  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{AR}_{j t}={R}_{j t}-(\\mathfrak{A}_{j}+\\beta_{j}{R}_{m t}),\n$$  \n\nwhere the parameters $\\alpha_{j}$ and $\\beta_{j}$ are estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS) using the sixty 2-day return pairs $(R_{j t},R_{m t})$ over the interval from 140 to 20 trading days prior to the announcement date.22 Standardized prediction errors are calculated as per Dodd and Warner (1983) and Mikkelson and Partch (1985).  \n\nOf the 170 firms that adopt an SRA within 3 years of IPO for whom the announcement date could be verified, two adopt the plans too close to IPO to allow for the calculation of the abnormal return via the market model. This leaves a sample of 168 firms for whom the 2-day beta-adjusted abnormal return can be calculated and the full 170 firms for whom the 2-day excess-of-market abnormal returns can be calculated. Of these, 122 firms are venture backed and 48 are non-venture backed.23  \n\nTable IV presents the announcement period mean cumulative abnormal returns for the venture-backed, non-venture-backed, and full samples.?4 For the full sample, the mean cumulative abnormal return is a positive $1.18\\%$ and is significantly different from zero at the $5\\%$ level.25 For the venture-backed firms, the mean 2-day CAR is a positive $1.70\\%$ and is significant at the $1\\%$ level. For the non-venturebacked firms, the mean 2-day CAR is a negative $0.22\\%$ and is not significantly different from zero. The results are similar when employing the stock-return-excess-of-the-market instead of the return-from-the-market model. For the full sample, the 2-day excess-of-market CAR is a positive $1.05\\%$ and is significant at the  \n\nTable IV. Wealth effect at adoption of shareholder rights agreement  \n\nThis table presents the effect on shareholder wealth of the adoption of SRAs (also known as poison pills) by IPO firms, within 3 years of IPO. I include only the first time a rights agreement is adopted (and not subsequent amendments). The effect on shareholder wealth is measured both by the 2-day CAR from a market model and the straight excess-over-market return, measured as the return on the announcement day and the day following ([o, 1]). Sample sizes differ slightly due to the lack of sufficient time series data of returns to measure $\\beta$ for some firms. Z-statistics for the market-adjusted returns are constructed using standardized prediction errors as in Dodd and Warner (1983) and Mikkelson and Partch (1985). \\*, \\*\\*, and $^{***}$ denote significance at the $10\\%$ $5\\%$ , and $1\\%$ levels (for a two-sided test), respectively.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"3\">2-Day (β-adjusted) CAR [O,1]</td><td colspan=\"3\">2-Day(excess of market) CAR [0,1]</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Numberof firms</td><td>Mean return</td><td>Z-statistics</td><td>Number of firms</td><td>Mean return</td><td>T-statistics</td></tr><tr><td>All firms</td><td>168</td><td>0.0118</td><td>2.34**</td><td>170</td><td>0.0105</td><td>2.12**</td></tr><tr><td>Venture-backedfirms</td><td>122</td><td>0.0170</td><td>3.38***</td><td>124</td><td>0.0159</td><td>2.69**</td></tr><tr><td>Non-venture-backedfirms</td><td>46</td><td>-0.0022</td><td>-0.58</td><td>48</td><td>-0.0032</td><td>-0.37</td></tr><tr><td>T-statistics for differences</td><td></td><td></td><td>1.74*</td><td></td><td></td><td>1.81*</td></tr><tr><td>F-testfrom one-wayANOVA</td><td></td><td></td><td>2.93*</td><td></td><td></td><td>2.78*</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n$5\\%$ level. The mean 2-day excess return for the venture-backed sample is a positive $1.59\\%$ and is significant at the $5\\%$ level. The mean 2-day excess return for the non-- venture-backed sample is a negative $-0.32\\%$ and is not significantly different from zero.  \n\nI formally test the hypothesis that the cumulative abnormal returns are the same in the venture- and non-venture-backed subsamples. Both the F-test from an unbalanced analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the t-test for differences in means reject the null hypothesis at the $10\\%$ level. I repeat these tests using the 2-day excess returns; again, both tests reject the null hypothesis of equal mean returns at the $10\\%$ level.  \n\nAs a robustness check, I proceed to analyze the 2-day $\\upbeta$ -adjusted and excess-ofmarket CARs in a regression framework. Since the market for corporate control underwent changes over the course of the sample period, I include an indicator for the year of adoption. I further control for firm size and the number of months that pass from IPO to adoption of the rights agreement. The independent variable of interest is VC, the indicator variable for venture backing. The results of the estimations are presented in Table V. The loading on venture backing, similar in both formulations, is approximately $2.1\\%$ and is significant at the $10\\%$ level. This estimate is slightly higher than the raw difference of $1.9\\%$ in $\\upbeta$ -adjusted CAR and $1.8\\%$ in excess-ofmarket CAR between venture- and non-venture-backed firms. The estimate grows larger under the treatment framework and remains significant. As in the previous section, the correlation coefficient in the treatment model is statistically significant  \n\nThis table presents the estimates of regression analysis of the wealth effect of the adoption of SRAs (poison pill) by IPO firms, within 3 years of IPO. 1 include only the frst timea rights agrement is adopted and nt subsequent amendments). The dependent ariabl inthe first set oftests is the 2-day $\\beta$ -adjusted CAR (measured as the return on the announcement day and the day following [O, 1]). The dependent variable in the second set of tests is the 2-day excess-of-market CAR (measured as the return on the announcement day and the day following [O, 1]). The independent variables are an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the firm is venture backed and O otherwise, the length of time between frm IPO and the adoption date, measured in months, and the log ofthe firm market capitalization. The first column in each set presents the estimates from fixed effects regressions. The second column presents estimates of a treatment model that controls for the endogeneity of venture backing. The independent variables in the selection equation of the treatment model are the dollar amount invested by the VC industry in the firm's headquarters state in the year of founding (as proxied for by the year 7 years prior to IPO) in millions of dollars and industry indicator variables. Since the VC investment amounts are not available prior to 1980, the 1980 data are used for allfirms whose founding year proxy is prior to 1980, and an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the frm founding year proxy is prior to 1980 and 0 otherwise, is also included. Standard errors are heteroskedastic consistent as per White (1980). The coefcients on the indicators for adoption year and industry are not reported here for the sake of brevity. \\*, \\*\\*, and \\*\\*\\* denote significance at the $10\\%$ $5\\%$ and $1\\%$ levels (for a two-sided test), respectively.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"4\">2-Day (β-adjusted) CAR [O, 1]</td><td colspan=\"4\">2-Day (excess of market) CAR [0, 1]</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">Robust OLS</td><td colspan=\"2\">Treatment</td><td colspan=\"2\">Robust OLS</td><td colspan=\"2\">Treatment</td></tr><tr><td>Variable</td><td>Coefficient</td><td>T-statistics</td><td>Coefficient</td><td>T-statistics</td><td>Coefficient</td><td>T-statistics</td><td>Coefficient</td><td>T-statistics</td></tr><tr><td>Venturebacking</td><td>0.0211</td><td>1.78*</td><td>0.0693</td><td>3.46***</td><td>0.0206</td><td>1.75*</td><td>0.0673</td><td>3.22***</td></tr><tr><td>Months from IPO</td><td>0.0002</td><td>0.71</td><td>0.0002</td><td>0.73</td><td>0.0002</td><td>1.00</td><td>0.0002</td><td>0.83</td></tr><tr><td>Log size</td><td>-0.0002</td><td>0.05</td><td>0.0004</td><td>0.10</td><td>0.0005</td><td>0.15</td><td>0.0010</td><td>0.25</td></tr><tr><td>Year of adoption fixed effects</td><td>Included</td><td></td><td>Included</td><td></td><td>Included</td><td></td><td>Included</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Correlationbetweentest</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.5270</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.5097</td></tr><tr><td>and treatment model errors,p</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Wald test of p = 0 (independent</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>6.12**</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>5.09**</td></tr><tr><td>equations), x²</td><td>168</td><td></td><td>162</td><td></td><td>170</td><td></td><td>164</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Number of observations</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"9\">Treatment model</td></tr><tr><td>Amount invested byVC industry infirm</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>headquarters stateinfoundingyear</td><td></td><td></td><td>1.20 × 10-7</td><td>3.38***</td><td></td><td></td><td>1.17 × 10-7</td><td>3.32***</td></tr><tr><td>Founded before 1980</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.2231</td><td>0.66</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.2202 Included</td><td>0.65</td></tr><tr><td>Industry indicators</td><td></td><td></td><td>Included</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nand is of opposite sign to that which would have been expected if the observed effect was due to the naive selection story rather than to an effect of venture backing.  \n\nFrom the above analysis, it appears that the market reacts more favorably to the adoption of SRAs by venture-backed firms than by non-venture-backed firms. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the venture-backed firms are perceived as being more likely to use the rights agreement to maximize shareholder wealth than are non-venture-backed firms. Note that this is a particularly strong test of the market's perception of firm governance, since presumably ex ante, the market price of a firm already incorporates a probability of adoption of an SRA and the associated value impact (positive or negative). If this assigned probability of adoption is higher for venture-backed firms, as it would appear to be from the relative adoption rates in the data and if the associated value impact of such an adoption for venture-backed firms is higher than for non-venture-backed firms, as hypothesized, then the impact on share price of the announcement of the adoption by a venture-backed firm will be reduced, as it has already been partly incorporated in the share price. This would then bias against the observation of a significant difference between the two groups of firms in event returns around the ultimate adoption date.  \n\nBoth the results from the previous section, which examine a symptom of weak governance, and from the analysis in this section, which examines the market's perception of governance, are consistent with the hypothesis that venture-financed firms are more likely to be better governed than are similar non-venture-backed firms. I now proceed to look directly at a set of observable governance structures of the firm, namely the board of directors and its committees.  \n\n## 5. The Board of Directors and Its Characteristics  \n\nBoards of directors are a crucial part of the corporate structure. The law imposes on the board a strict and fiduciary duty to ensure that the company is run in the longterm interests of the shareholders. Formal economic theory on boards is limited; however, a number of regularities have been established by the empirical literature. Board actions do appear to be related to board structures; firms whose board structures are more independent from management tend to make better decisions. Not surprisingly, shareholder advocates and business groups have long been proponents of independent board structures.  \n\n### 5.1 BOARD COMPOSITION  \n\nMost directors can be classified either as inside or outside directors. Outside directors are not employees ofthe firm nor do they have substantial business ties with the firm or its management. Their incentives are not aligned with those of the CEO or top management, and it is these directors who lend the board a degree of independence. Inside directors are generally directors who are employees or former employees of the firm. Insiders are not considered to be independent of the CEO or management. Usually, their success is tied to the CEO. Some directors fall into neither of the above categories. These directors, who are referred to as grey directors, are those directors who have substantial business ties to the firm or provide it with banking, consulting, or legal services.  \n\nPresumably, if outsiders command a powerful majority in the boardroom, they will be better able to hold in check management's tendencies to abuse power (Monks and Minow, 2001). Fama (1980) and Fama and Jensen (1983) argue that outside directors bear a reputation cost if performance is poor, leading them to monitor management actions more carefully compared to other directors. Consistent with this argument, empirical studies have shown that firms with outsider-dominated boards are more likely to undergo major restructuring events such as takeovers, mergers, and tender offers (Lin, 1996) and are more likely to nominate outside CEOs (Borokhovich, Parrino, and Trapani, 1996). Shareholder wealth increases with the addition of outsiders to the board (Rosenstein and Wyatt, 1990), and outside directors enhance shareholder wealth during tender offers (Cotter, Shivdasani, and Zenner, 1997).  \n\nA firm with an outside director majority is more likely to replace a CEO following poor firm performance (Weisbach, 1988), make better acquisitions (Byrd and Hickman, 1992), and adopt poison pills to improve shareholder value rather than impede value-creating takeovers (Brickley, Coles, and Terry, 1994). Last but not least, Richardson (2006) finds less overinvestment of surplus cash for firms with more independent boards.26  \n\nAs can be seen from the summary statistics in Panel B of Table I, the average board of directors in the subsample is composed of $53.3\\%$ outsiders, $42.1\\%$ insiders, and $4.5\\%$ grey directors.27 For venture-backed firms, the percentage of outsiders is $65.1\\%$ and the percentage of insiders is $32\\%$ . For non-venture-backed firms, the percentage of insiders, $50.9\\%$ , is higher than the sample average and the percentage of outsiders, $42.9\\%$ , is lower.  \n\nI analyze the proportions of insider and outsider representation in a regression framework. Since I wish to analyze proportion variables, which are bounded between zero and one, I use the standard logit transformation ln $(x/(1-x))$ for proportions, where $x$ is either the proportion of insiders or outsiders on the board. 1 estimate the model:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathrm{{PCTO}}_{i}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{{sz}}}\\mathrm{{SZ}}_{i}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{{vc}}}\\mathrm{{VC}}_{i}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{{rep}}}\\mathrm{{VCREPX}}_{i}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{{vct}}}\\mathrm{{VCTENUREX}}}\\ {+\\beta_{\\mathrm{{lst}}}\\mathrm{{LSTENUREX}}_{i}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{{age}}}{\\mathrm{CEOAGE}}_{i}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{{fn}}}\\mathrm{{FOUNDER}}_{i}}\\ {+\\beta_{\\mathrm{{tn}}}\\mathrm{{CEOTENURE}}_{i}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{{rt}}}\\mathrm{{RETIRE}}_{i}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{{de}}}\\mathrm{{DEIND}}_{i}+\\Gamma^{\\prime}I N D_{i}}\\ {+\\epsilon_{i},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere LPCTO is the logit transform for the proportion of outsiders on the board, the control variables are SZ, the log of the market capitalization of the firm on the first day of listing on CRSP, IND are industry dummies (based on one-digit SIC codes), VC, an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the firm is venture backed and O otherwise, and VC, firm and CEO characteristics, as follows.  \n\nVCREPX proxies for the experience of the VCs for venture-backed firms. VCREPX takes the value O for non-venture-backed firms, and for venture-backed firms, it equals the number of funds (from venture firm inception to year of the IPO) raised by the venture capital firm that has been involved longest with the IPO firm.28 VCTENUREX is an interaction between the log of the number of years a VC has been on the board of directors of the firm and VC. LSTENUREX is an interaction between the log of the number of years a large shareholder of some sort has been present on the board and an indicator variable taking the value 1 if a there is a non-VC large shareholder with board representation and O otherwise. The experience and tenure variables control for the relative power of outside shareholders, as Hermalin and Weisbach (1998) predict that outsider representation on the board increases with the power of outside investors. CEOAGE is the log of the CEO's age, in years. FOUNDER is an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the CEO is also a founder of the firm and O otherwise. CEOTENURE is the log of the number of years the CEO has served in that position. These three variables control for the relative power of the CEO, consistent with the prediction of Hermalin and Weisbach (1998) that outsider representation on the board decreases with the power of the CEO. RETIRE is an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the CEO is near retirement age $(>62)$ and O otherwise. If the CEO is nearing retirement, the firm might bring additional insiders onto the board to train for the CEO role. Finally, DEIND is an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the firm is incorporated in the state of Delaware. Delaware has a unique legal regime among the states and a well-developed chancery court with set precedents for dealing with firm agency issues (Daines, 2001), which may substitute for other governance mechanisms. Industry and firm size are included as controls since the ability of the firm to attract outside directors may vary with these characteristics.  \n\nThe first column of Table VI presents the estimates of the coefficients in Equation (4). The coefficient on VC is 1.64 and is significant at the $1\\%$ level. Holding all other variables at their mean, this corresponds to an outsider proportion of 0.67 of the board of directors for venture-backed firms versus a proportion of 0.28 of the board for non-venture-backed firms. I estimate a similar model for LPCTI, the logit transform for the proportion of insiders on the board.29 The third column of the table presents the results of the estimation. Here, the coefficient on VC is $-1.42$ and is significant at the $1\\%$ level. Holding all other variables at their mean, this corresponds to an insider proportion of 0.29 of the board of directors for venture-backed firms versus a proportion of 0.63 of the board for non-venture-backed firms.  \n\nThe coefficients on the control variables in both equations are generally as expected. The proportion of outsiders (insiders) decreases (increases) with the age of the CEO and when the CEO is a founder of the firm (although the coefficients are not significant), consistent with the predictions of Hermalin and Weisbach (1998). The coefficient on CEO tenure is not statistically significant in either specification. Additionally, while the length of time that a VC has been present on the board is not statistically significantly different from zero, the coefficient on the board tenure of non-VC large shareholders is positive (negative) and significant in the analysis of the proportion of outsiders (insiders) on the board. This, too, is consistent with the predictions of Hermalin and Weisbach (1998).  \n\nThe second and fourth columns of the table present the estimates of the models for LPCTO and LPCTI under the treatment model framework. As can be seen from the treatment model estimates in the table, the correlation coefficient estimates are opposite in sign from that which would be expected if the firms that receive venture backing are those that are more likely, regardless, to have more independent board compositions. This is consistent with the findings on the direction of the selection bias in Section 3. For both models, I cannot reject the null hypothesis of zero correlation between the first- and second-stage equations. The coefficients on venture backing remain significant and similar to those obtained without accounting for the selection, as do the corresponding marginal effects.  \n\nTo further examine board composition, I follow Weisbach (1988) and Cotter, Shivdasani, and Zenner (1997) and classify the sample into three categories: firms  \n\nThis table presents the results of analysis of board-of-director composition. The dependent variable in the first set of tests is the proportion of outsider members. The dependent variable in the second set of tests is the proportion of insider members. The difference between the two is the proportion of grey directors. In each set of tests, the first test is a probit analysis and the second applies a treatment model to the probit to control for the endogeneity of venture backing. The control variables for all tests are the log of firm size (market capitalization) at the time of IPO, VC reputation/experience, proxied for by the number of venture funds raised by the VC who has had board representation the longest, the log of the number of years a VC has been present on the board of directors (interacted with an indicator for venture backing), the log of the number of years any large shareholder has been present on the board of directors (interacted with an indicator variable for a non-VC large shareholder), the log of CEO age (in years), the log of CEO tenure (in years), an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the CEO is near retirement age (62 years and older) and O otherwise, an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the firm is incorporated in Delaware and 0 otherwise, and indicator variables for industry affiliation (based on one-digit SIC codes), the coefficients on which are omitted for the sake of brevity.

Only $6.4\\%$ of venturebacked firms have insider-dominated boards versus $15.3\\%$ of non-venture-backed firms. $58.7\\%$ of venture-backed firm and $37.1\\%$ of non-venture-backed firms have outsider-dominated boards.  \n\nI define two binary variables, OUTDOM and INDOM, which take the value 1 if the firm has an outsider-dominated board or insider-dominated board, respectively, and O otherwise. I then examine these variables in a probit framework, with controls as in Equation (4), as well as under the bivariate probit selection framework. The results of these estimations are presented in Table VI1. In the analysis of OUTDOM, the loading on VC is positive and highly significant. Holding all other variables at their mean, the coefficient of 1.32 corresponds to an additional 0.49 probability that the firm has an outsider-dominated board for venture-backed firms relative to non-venture-backed firms. The coefficient and the marginal effect remain similar under the treatment model, though the coefficient loses significance. The correlation coefficient is small and not statistically significant. In the analysis of INDOM, the loading on VC is negative, $-1.15$ , and significant at the $1\\%$ level, corresponding to a reduction of 0.16 in the probability of having an insider-dominated board for venture-backed firms relative to non-venture-backed firms. Under the treatment model, the coefficient grows to $-1.85$ and remains significant. Once again, I cannot reject the null hypothesis of zero correlation between the selection and test model errors.  \n\nThe results of the above analyses are consistent with the hypothesis that venturebacked firms have more independent boards than do non-venture-backed firms. However, boards function through their committees and a more complete picture can be drawn by also examining the composition of these important board substructures.  \n\n### 5.2 BOARD COMMITTEES  \n\nThe board of directors typically has a number of committees that are charged with particular duties. In particular, the American Bar Association's (1994) Corporate Director's Guidebook and the Committee on Corporate Laws (1979) emphasize that directors carry out their oversight duties in board committees. The relative representation of outsiders on these committees is another potential measure of the management/shareholder power balance, with the logic similar to that regarding the composition of the board itself. The major committees involved in the governance of the firm are the audit, compensation, and nominating committees.  \n\nAudit committees interact with management, the board, and the external auditor and conduct inquiries into management judgments, accounting estimates, audit  \n\nThis table presents the results of probit analysis of the probabilities of various board-of-director composition structures. The dependent variable in the first set of tests is an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the board is independent (i.e., the proportion of outsider members is greater than 0.5) and O otherwise. The dependent variable in the second set of tests is an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the board is outsider dominated (i.e., the proportion of outsider members is greater than 0.6) and 0 otherwise. The dependent variable in the third set of tests is an indicator variable taking the value 1 ifthe board is insider dominated (i.e., the proportion of insider members is greater than 0.6) and O otherwise. In each set of tests, the first test is a probit analysis and the second applies a treatment model to the probit to control for the endogeneity of venture backing. The control variables for all tests are the log of firm size (market capitalization) at the time of IPO, VC reputation/experience, proxied for by the number of venture funds raised by the VC who has had board representation the longest, the log of the number of years a VC has been present on the board of directors (interacted with an indicator for venture backing), the log of the number of years any large shareholder has been present on the board of directors (interacted with an indicator variable for a non-VC large shareholder), the log of CEO age (in years), the log of CEO tenure (in years), an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the CEO is near retirement age (62 years and older) and 0 otherwise, an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the firm is incorporated in Delaware and O otherwise, and indicator variables for industry affliation (based on one-digit SIC codes),the coeffcients on which are omitted for the sake of brevity. The independent variables in the selection equation of the treatment model are the dollar amount invested by the VC industry in the firm's headquarters state in the year of founding in millions of dollars and industry indicator variables.

The audit committee's roles include preventing fraudulent accounting statements, as well as brokering disputes between management and outside auditors on how to apply GAAP. Independent audit committees are expected to be more efficient and objective monitors of the financial accounting process. Compensation committees determine and review compensation packages for top management. An independent compensation committee implies greater accountability and a greater chance that management compensation packages are being optimized to properly align management interests with those of the shareholders. Nominating committees nominate candidates for senior management positions as well as for election to the board of directors. During the time period covered by the sample, the rules for committee composition were vague at best. Large US companies were encouraged, and in some cases required, to maintain audit committees comprised a majority of, or solely of, “independent” members, although no definition of independence was provided in stock exchange listing requirements.  \n\nI examine two measures of committee independence from management. For each committee, I classify the committee composition by two methods: (i) whether the committee is free of insider members (i.e., is composed solely of outsider and grey directors) and (i) whether the committee is composed entirely of outsiders.30 Seventy-seven percent of venture-backed firms have fully independent (only outsider members) audit committees, and $83.5\\%$ of venture-backed firms have audit committees with no insider members. By comparison, only $32.3\\%$ of non-venture-backed firms have fully independent audit committees, and only $42.7\\%$ have audit committees with no insider representation. A similar picture emerges for compensation committees, with $69.7\\%$ of venture-backed firm compensation committees fully independent of management and $77.1\\%$ free of insider members; for the non-venture-backed firms, the percentages are $26.6\\%$ and $37.1\\%$ , respectively. Interestingly, in the sample of newly public firms, nearly all the firms stated in their prospectus that the entirety of the board serves as the nominating committee for the firm. Thus, I do not analyze nominating committee composition separately.  \n\nPanel A of Table VIlI presents the results from probit analysis of the dependent variables ACNOIN, an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the audit committee has no insider members, and ACALLO, an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the audit committee is composed entirely of outsiders.

Panel A examines the composition of the audit committee, and Panel B examines the composition of the compensation committee.

The dependent variable in the second set of tests is an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the committee has only outsider members and O otherwise.

that a firm has only outsiders on its audit committe for venture-backed firms relative to non-venture-backed firms. However, only in the analysis for ACALLO is the coefficient on VC significant.  \n\nUnder the treatment model framework, the estimated coeffcients on VC in both modelsgrow $40\\%-50\\%$ , but neither retains significance. In this case, however, the coefficient on VCREPX, the variable taking the value of the VC experience proxy for venture-backed firms and the value O for non-venture-backed firms, is positive and statistically and economically significant in both models and remains so under the treatment framework. This result suggests that venture-backed firms do have more independent audit committees and that the effect is stronger the greater the experience of the VC firm.  \n\nPanel B of the table presents the results from probit analysis of the dependent variables CCNOIN, an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the compensation committee has no insider members and O otherwise, and CCALLO, an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the compensation committee is composed entirely of outsiders. For both variables, the loading on VC is positive and significant at the $5\\%$ level, corresponding to an increase of o.16 in the probability that a firm has no insiders on its compensation committee and of 0.23 in the probability that a firm has only outsiders on its compensation committee for venture-backed firms relative to non-- venture-backed firms. Under the treatment framework, the estimated coefficient on VC in the model for CCNOIN doubles, from 0.75 without the treatment correction to 1.51 with the treatment correction. The estimated coefficient on VC in the model for CCALLO grows from 0.65 to 1.56. In both models, the coefficient estimates remain statistically significant after accounting for the possible selection bias.  \n\nIt appears from the above analysis that not only do venture-backed firms have more independent boards but that even despite the lack of guidelines and exchange requirements for independent committees during the sample period, venturebacked firms are still more likely than non-venture-backed firms to have committees that are free of management influence and conflicts of interest.  \n\n### 5.3 CEO/CHAIRMAN DUALITY  \n\nLast but not least, I examine the separation of the roles of chairman of the board and CEO. Jensen (1993) argues that directors are more likely to acquiesce to the CEO's desires when the CEO is also the chairman of the board. Separation of the roles of chairman and CEO, therefore, should lead to a more objective evaluation of the CEO and management and greater accountability. Empirical evidence is consistent with this hypothesis. Rechner and Dalton (1991) find that companies with a separate CEO and chairman consistently outperform those companies that combine the roles. Yermack (1996) finds that firms are valued more highly when the CEO and chairman  \n\nTable IX. Board chairmanship duality  \n\nThis table presents the results of probit analysis of the probability of the chairmanship of the board being held by the firm CEO. The dependent variable is an indicator variable taking the value 1 is the CEO serves as chair and O otherwise. The control variables for all tests are the log of firm size (market capitalization) at the time of IPO, VC reputation/experience, proxied for by the number of venture funds raised bythe VC who has had board representation the longest, the log ofthe numberofyears a VC has been present on the board of directors (interacted with an indicator for venture backing), the log of the number of years any large shareholder has been present on the board of directors (interacted with an indicator variable for a non-VC large shareholder), the log of CEO age (in years), the log ofCEO tenure (in years), an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the CEO is near retirement age (62 years and older) and O otherwise, an indicator variable taking the value 1 ifthe firm is incorporated in Delaware and O otherwise, and indicator variables forindustry affiliation (based on one-digit SIC codes), the coefficients on which are omitted for the sake of brevity. The independent variables in the selection equation ofthe treatment model are the dollar amount invested by the VC industry in the firm's headquarters state in the year of founding in millions of dollars and industry indicator variables. As the VC investment amounts are not available prior to 1980, the 1980 data are used for all firms whose founding year is prior to 1980, and an indicator variable taking the value 1 ifthe firm founding yearis priorto 1980 and0 otherwise,is also included. Alltests use White (1980) heteroskedasticity-consistent robust standard errors. \\*, \\*\\*, and \\*\\*\\*denote significance athe $10\\%$ $5\\%$ ,and $1\\%$ levels (for a two-sided test), respectively.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"6\">Chairmanship of the board</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">Probit</td><td colspan=\"2\">Treatment model</td></tr><tr><td>Coefficient</td><td>Z-statistics</td><td>Coefficient</td><td>Z-statistics</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>-5.6031</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Intercept</td><td>-6.1068</td><td>2.13**</td><td></td><td>-1.86*</td></tr><tr><td>Log size</td><td>-0.1888</td><td>-1.78*</td><td>-0.1908</td><td>-1.84*</td></tr><tr><td>Venture capital backing</td><td>-0.9880</td><td>-3.35***</td><td>-1.3779</td><td>-2.23**</td></tr><tr><td>VC reputation/experience</td><td>0.0286</td><td>1.00</td><td>0.0309</td><td>1.09</td></tr><tr><td>Log VC board tenure</td><td>-0.0994</td><td>-0.56</td><td>-0.0951</td><td>-0.54</td></tr><tr><td>Log large shareholder board tenure</td><td>-0.3616</td><td>-1.53</td><td>-0.3544</td><td>-1.53</td></tr><tr><td>Log CEO age</td><td>1.8400</td><td>2.49**</td><td>1.7408</td><td>2.27**</td></tr><tr><td>CEO is founder</td><td>0.9095</td><td>3.73***</td><td>0.8962</td><td>3.59***</td></tr><tr><td>Log CEO tenure</td><td>0.1103</td><td>1.92*</td><td>0.1061</td><td>1.88*</td></tr><tr><td>Delaware incorporation</td><td>-0.3990</td><td>-0.80</td><td>-0.4131</td><td>-0.84</td></tr><tr><td>CEO is near retirement</td><td>0.3529</td><td>-1.68*</td><td>-0.3529</td><td>-1.69**</td></tr><tr><td>Industry indicator variables</td><td>Included</td><td></td><td>Included</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Correlation between test and treatment model errors, p</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.2584</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Wald Test of p = 0 (Independent Equations),x2</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.37</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Number of observations</td><td>208</td><td></td><td>208</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Treatment model</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Amount invested by VC industry in firm headquarters</td><td></td><td></td><td>3.66 × 10-8</td><td>1.64</td></tr><tr><td>state in founding year</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Founded before 1980</td><td></td><td></td><td>-0.7182</td><td>-3.09***</td></tr><tr><td>Industry indicators</td><td></td><td></td><td>Included</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\npositions are separated. Field and Karpoff (2002) find that firms with a joint CEO/ chairman are more likely to employ anti-takeover defenses at the time of IPO.  \n\nThe CEO serves as chairman of the board in $72.7\\%$ of the non-venture-backed firms in the sample. In venture-backed firms, however, dual CEO/chairmen appear only $46.5\\%$ of the time. Table IX presents the results of probit analysis of CCHAIR, an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the position of chairman of the board is filled by the CEO. Twenty-four of the firms in the sample do not indicate in their prospectus who serves as chairman of the board. These firms are not included in the analysis. The independent variables are those included in the previous models of board characteristics. The coefficient on VC is $-0.988$ and is significant at the $1\\%$ level, corresponding to a reduction of 0.37 in the probability that the CEO serves as the chairman of the board for a venture-backed firm relative to a non-venturebacked firm, when all other variables are held at their means. The coefficient grows slightly to $-1.38$ under the treatment model, corresponding to a reduction of0.45 in the probability that the CEO serves as the chairman and remains significant at the $5\\%$ level.  \n\nThe collection of above results are consistent with the argument that venturebacked firms have more independent board structures than non-venture-backed firms, even accounting for the possible selection bias. Venture-backed firm boards have a lower proportion of insiders and a higher proportion of outsiders. They are also less likely to be insider dominated. Both the audit and compensation committees of venture-backed firms are more likely to be free of insider representation and to consist solely of outsider members. Furthermore, venture-backed firms are more likely to separate the roles of CEO and chairman. An interesting feature is that for all but one of the models estimated, the correlation coefficient estimate in the treatment model suggests that if selection is taking place, it is such that the firms that receive venture capital are those who would be less likely to set good board structuresex ante.  \n\n## 6. Venture Capital Effect or Large Shareholder Effect?  \n\nAn interesting question that remains is whether the effects documented above are an effect specific to VC stakeholders or whether they are merely a large shareholder effect resulting from the involvement of any outside entity in the pre-IPO firm. There are a number of reasons why we may expect to see a different effect depending on the type of investor funding the firm in the pre-IPO stage. One possibility is that the VC possesses specific skills that other large shareholders do not. For example, it might be the case that the VC is more effective at exercising control in the companies that he finances. Second, it is possible that rather than possessing skills that other shareholders lack, the VC might simply be more aware of the problems and issues that need to be addressed, owing to accumulated experience with startup firms and the IPO process.  \n\nVCs might also have stronger effects on governance than other large shareholders have indirectly, through their efforts to professionalize the firm. While some governance effects may be related merely to the presence of a large shareholder, others may require more active involvement in the affairs of the firm. If other types of pre-IPO large shareholders are less actively involved in the firm and its governance, we might see a difference between venture-backed firms and those firms that have some other form of pre-IPO large shareholder. For example, we may expect to find greater effects for VC than for angel investors due to the greater involvement of the VC in the portfolio firm.31  \n\nAnother reason we may see expects a difference in the level of involvement of the large shareholder in the governance of the firm is differences in incentives for the VC and other types of large shareholders. Corporate investments may be made by agents, (rather than principals), who do not experience a direct increase in wealth or compensation from an increased IPO firm share price.32 Furthermore, corporate investments may be made for strategic purposes, envisioning synergies or strategic ties later in the life of the firm (Hellmann, 2002). In this case, the corporate investor may be more interested in preserving strategic goals than ensuring optimal governance or value maximization.  \n\nIf the effects of venture backing documented in the previous sections are merely a large shareholder effect, I would expect to see similar effects on governance in nonventure-backed firms that have other types of active pre-IPO large shareholders. Using the detailed 1994 subsample, I identify types of pre-IPO active large shareholders of non-venture-backed firms. As described in Section 2, a shareholder is considered to be an “active\" large shareholder if he owns a $5\\%$ or greater stake in the firm preIPO and has board representation. As such, some non-venture-backed firms in the subsample do not have any active large shareholder. There are two main types of active large shareholder prevalent in the sample: corporate shareholders—-corporations and outside holding companies—and individual or angels investors33  \n\nFor all the non-venture-backed firms in the sample, I define two indicator variables, CORP and ANGEL, which take the value 1 if the firm has an active corporate or individual large shareholder, respectively, and 0 otherwise. I then reestimate the models in previous sections with the addition of the CORP and ANGEL variables on the right-hand side of each model. Of the 124 non-venturebacked firms in the subsample, 12 frms have a corporate large shareholder and 9 have a non-VC individual angel shareholder. For brevity, I do not report the results from these estimations in detailed tables.  \n\nI first examine the level of discretionary accruals, adding the variables CORP and ANGEL to the models estimated in Table II. As large shareholder data are available only for the hand-collected 1994 subsample, I am restricted to the firms in that sample for whom sufficient data are available in Compustat to be included in the tests (148 of the 232 firms). The coefficient on VC is a negative and significant 0.25 of total firm assets, similar to the estimate from the treatment model in Section 3.34 In contrast, the coefficients on CORP and ANGEL are not significantly different than zero, and the null hypothesis of equality between the coefficient on VC and on ANGEL is rejected at the $5\\%$ level.  \n\nSimilarly, in the probit analysis of the indicator variable for aggressive accounting, the coefficient on VC is negative and significant, while the coefficients on CORP and ANGEL are not significantly different from zero. In probit analysis of the indicator variable for conservative accounting, the coefficient on VC is positive, suggesting that venture backing is associated with a higher probability of employing conservative accounting, but the coefficients on CORP and ANGEL are both insignificant. Once again in these models, the null hypothesis of equality between the coefficient on VC and on ANGEL is rejected at the $5\\%$ level.  \n\nNext, I reestimate the models for board and committee composition, adding the variable CORP and ANGEL, in addition to the variables CORPTENUREX and ANGELTENUREX, which are interactions between the log of the number of years the corporate or private equity large shareholder has been on the board of directors of the firm and an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the firm has a corporate or private equity investor, respectively, and 0 otherwise. These tenure variables control for the power of outside investors, which may affect board composition (as per Hermalin and Weisbach, 1998), and are the counterparts to the control variable VCTENUREX included in the original models. The estimates on VC and the control variables are qualitatively similar in sign and magnitude to the estimates in the tests in Section 5. The coefficient on VC is positive and significant. The coefficients on CORP and ANGEL, in contrast, are not statistically significant.  \n\nEquivalent results are apparent in estimates of the model for the logit transform for the proportion of insiders. In both the above models, the null hypothesis of equality between the coefficient on venture backing and the coefficient on ANGEL arerejected atthe $5\\%$ level. Once again, the coefficients on the control variables are similar in sign and magnitude to the estimates in the tests in Section 5. I find similar patterns for an analysis of the indicator variable for CEO/chairman duality and in the models analyzing audit and compensation committee composition.  \n\nWhile the sample of non-venture-backed firms with an active large shareholder is small, these results suggest that the effects documented in previous sections of this paper are not merely large shareholder effects but rather are at least in part specific to venture capital backing. In particular, the differences between the effect of venture capital backing versus angel or individual investor backing support the notion that active involvement in and/or control of the firm pre-IPO is requisite for mitigating governance problems when the firm is newly public.  \n\n## 7. Conclusions  \n\nIn this paper, I examine the role of financial intermediary involvement in the entrepreneurial firm by exploring the effect of pre-IPO venture capital backing on the subsequent corporate governance of the newly public firm. Using a unique data set constructed from four commercially available databases and two hand-collected data sets, I conduct three sets of tests comparing governanceand monitoring-related variables for venture-backed and non-venture-backed firms. The findings are consistent with pre-IPO venture capital backing having an effect on the governance and monitoring of the entrepreneurial firm at the time of transition to the public markets. Other types of pre-IPO large shareholders, such as corporate and angel investors, do not appear have similar effects on the governance of the entrepreneurial firm.  \n\nThe paper contributes to the growing literature on the role played by venture capital in the building of entrepreneurial firms. The findings suggest that the effects of venture capital backing can be significant even at the time of transition to dispersed public ownership and to the extent that governance is path dependent, for some period following the IPO. That said, while this paper sheds light on the effect of pre-IPO VC involvement in the firm on the governance at and around the time of public offering, it leaves to future research the study of the effect of post-IPO VC involvement on the evolving governance of the firm.  \n\nThe paper also contributes to the large literature on the corporate governance of the firm, which has tended to focus on large public companies. It suggests one possible source of the observed heterogeneity in the governance structures of IPO firms. The results of this paper add to emerging evidence that, left to their own devices, entrepreneurs might not set optimal, value-maximizing governance structures at the time of IPO. Future theory studies may wish to address the question of entrepreneurial incentives at the time of transition from private to public ownership.  \n\n## Appendix A: The Modified Jones (1991) Model for Discretionary Accruals  \n\nThe Jones (1991) model follows the suggestion of Kaplan (1985) that accruals likely result from the exercise of managerial discretion and from changes in the firm's economic conditions. The model is based on two main assumptions (i) that accruals resulting from changes in the firm's economic environment are related to changes in sales or sales growth and (ii) that gross property, plant and equipment expenditure controls for those accruals related to nondiscretionary depreciation expense.  \n\nThe modified Jones model is given by  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{ACC}_{t,i}}{\\mathrm{TA}_{t-1,i}}=\\upbeta_{1}\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{TA}_{t-1,i}}+\\upbeta_{2}\\frac{\\Delta S_{t,i}-\\Delta\\mathrm{Rec}_{t,i}}{\\mathrm{TA}_{t-1,i}}+\\upbeta_{3}\\frac{\\mathrm{PPE}_{t,i}}{\\mathrm{TA}_{t-1,i}}+\\epsilon,\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathrm{ACC}_{t,i}$ are the firm's total accruals at time $t;\\mathrm{TA}_{t-1,i}$ are the firm's assets at time $t-1$ (Compustat Item 6); and $S_{t,i},\\mathrm{Rec}_{t,i},$ and $\\mathrm{PPE}_{t}$ are the firm's sales (Compustat Item 12), net receivables (Item 2 minus Item 67), and the property, plant and equipment at time $t$ (Item 7), respectively. The scaling by total firm assets corrects for the fact that in any large sample of firms including companies of various sizes, we cannot meaningfully compare the raw level of accruals of one firm with another.  \n\nThecoefficients $\\beta_{1},\\beta_{2}$ ,and $\\beta_{3}$ are estimated cross-sectionally by industry and time period. In each period, the industry-specific coefficients are calculated using data from all the firms in that industry in that period. While the modified Jones (1991) model can also be estimated in a time series fashion, I examine a sample of IPO firms, and as a result historical time series data on the firms accruals and accounting line items is not available. Bartov, Gul, and Tsui (2000) and Subramanyan (1996) also note that the cross-sectional version of the modified Jones model is superior, ex ante, to the time series version. First, the number of observations used in each estimation is considerably higher in the cross-sectional version, increasing the precision of the resulting coefficient estimates. Second, by not requiring a history oftime series data, the cross-sectional model is less subject to survival bias and allows the inclusion of firms with short histories. Third, nonstationarity is much less of a concern for the cross-sectional version than it is for the time series version.  \n\nThe firm's non-discretionary accruals $\\left(\\mathrm{NDA}_{t}\\right)$ are the firm's contemporaneous forecasted levels of scaled accruals, using the industry-specific coefficients estimated from the past period's data and the firm's current-period accounting line items $(S_{t},\\mathrm{\\textmd{Rec}}_{t}$ and $\\mathrm{PPE}_{t,}$  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{NDA_{t,i}}=\\widehat{\\beta}_{1}\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{TA}_{t-1,i}}+\\widehat{\\beta}_{2}\\frac{\\Delta S_{t,i}-\\Delta\\mathrm{Rec}_{t,i}}{\\mathrm{TA}_{t-1,i}}+\\widehat{\\beta}_{3}\\frac{\\mathrm{PPE}_{t,i}}{\\mathrm{TA}_{t-1,i}}.\n$$  \n\nDiscretionary accruals are then the difference between scaled total accruals and the nondiscretionary accruals  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{DACC}_{t,i}=\\frac{\\mathrm{ACC}_{t,i}}{\\mathrm{TA}_{t-1,i}}-\\mathrm{NDA}_{t,i}.\n$$  \n\n## References  \n\nAmerican Bar Association (1994).

HSU\\*  \n\n# ABSTRACT  \n\nThis study empirically evaluates the certification and value-added roles of reputable venture capitalists (VCs). Using a novel sample of entrepreneurial start-ups with multiple financing offers, I analyze financing offers made by competing VCs at the first professional round of start-up funding, holding characteristics of the start-up fixed. Offers made by VCs with a high reputation are three times more likely to be accepted, and high-reputation VCs acquire start-up equity at a $10{-}14\\%$ discount. The evidence suggests that VCs'“extra-financial\" value may be more distinctive than their functionally equivalent financial capital. These extra-financial services can have financial consequences.  \n\nA CENTRAL IssUE for early-stage high-tech entrepreneurs is obtaining external resources when the assets oftheir start-up are intangible and knowledge-based. Particularly for entrepreneurs without an established reputation, convincing external resource providers such as venture capitalists (VCs) to provide financial capital may be challenging. The literature contains two main lines of research for overcoming this problem. One research stream has concentrated on designing institutional structures to permit financing early-stage ventures. This contractual- and monitoring-based approach is aimed at solving potential agency problems between investors and entrepreneurs (e.g., Admati and Pfleiderer (1994), Lerner (1995), Hellmann (1998), and Kaplan and Stromberg (2001, 2002, 2003). A second research stream has suggested that when the quality of a start-up cannot be directly observed, external actors rely on the quality of the start-up's affiliates as a signal of the start-up's own quality (e.g, Megginson and Weiss (1991), Biglaiser (1993), and Stuart, Hoang, and Hybels (1999)). This certification-based approach may help legitimate startups and entrepreneurs without a prior track record.  \n\nWhile the first research stream emphasizes the VC's problem (designing the appropriate mechanisms), the second highlights the entrepreneur's problem more directly (affiliating with highly reputable partners), and serves as an antecedent to this study. VC certification value, together with their value-added services such as recruiting executive managers (Hellmann and Puri (2002)), have led analysts in the descriptive literature to write: “It is far more important whose money you get [as an entrepreneur] than how much you get or how much you pay for it\" (Bygrave and Timmons (1992, p. 208)) and“From whom you raise capital is often more important than the terms\" (Sahlman (1997, p. 107). These views clearly indicate that VCs have different value-added potential and that VC represents more than strict financial capital to entrepreneurs. In contrast, the extant academic literature has not emphasized VC heterogeneity, implicitly treating VCs as one uniform class so that reputation differences among VCs are obscured (see Gompers (1996) and Kaplan and Schoar (2003) for exceptions). As well, whereas much of the previous literature has concentrated on the benefits to certification (e.g., Megginson and Weiss (1991) and Stuart et al. (1999)), the costs of affiliating with prominent actors have not been systematically analyzed empirically. For example, the prescriptive advice to start-up entrepreneurs of affiliating with the highest status partner possible (Stuart et al. (1999) seems strong given that calculations of returns to such action that do not take into account the costs of affiliation may be overstated. Indeed, demand for affiliation with reputable actors is likely to vary with the cost of such association. More generally, because affiliation with reputable partners confers performance benefits, such association cannot be freely accessed, for otherwise certification agents would not have incentives to invest in acquiring a reputation in the first place (Shapiro (1983)).1  \n\nConsequently, this paper explores two interlinked questions: Is there a market for affiliation with reputable partners? If so, what are the prices for such affiliation? Entrepreneurial demand for affiliation with VCs provides an excellent empirical setting to explore these questions for two reasons. First, because VCs can certify and start-ups need to be certified, the exchange nature of the relationship provides a natural marketplace for affiliation. Second, due to the tremendous increase in the supply of venture capital in the second half of the 1990s,2 the situation of “money chasing deals\" makes observing a menu of price offers by VCs with varying reputation more likely—a necessary condition for identifying the market for affiliation.  \n\nThe empirical analysis investigates proxies for VC reputation which explain the variation in offers accepted and valuations offered to start-ups at a point in time, while holding start-up characteristics fixed. To implement this methodology, I developed a novel, hand-collected data set of 148 financing offers (both those accepted and declined) made to a group of 51 early-stage high-tech startups. The estimated effects are both statistically and economically significant. A financing offer from a high-reputation VC is approximately three times more likely to be accepted by an entrepreneur. As well, highly reputable VCs acquire start-up equity at a $10{-}14\\%$ discount.  \n\nThe empirical results suggest that entrepreneurs are willing to forego offers with higher valuations in order to affiliate with more reputable VCs. These results are consistent with the idea that VCs act as more than strict financial intermediaries, placing funds from investors to capital-constrained start-ups. If this were not the case, we might expect entry by suppliers of entrepreneurial finance to equilibrate prices for start-up equity across offers to a given firm. However, ifVCs differed in the bundle of services and certification they provide to their portfolio companies, which might be thought of as “extra-financial\" VC functions, then prices for affiliation might differ. This implies that the VC information network and its certification value may be more distinctive than their financial capital, and so these extra-financial VC functions can have financial consequences, namely, the price at which VCs are able to acquire equity in a given start-up. Indeed, this view is consistent with the stylized fact that VCs experience substantial interindustry variation in financial performance (Kaplan and Schoar (2003)). Consequently, future research exploring variation within the VC industry, especially as it relates to organizational performance, would be interesting.  \n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section I discusses the relevant prior literature and derives hypotheses about the entrepreneurial market for VC affiliation. Section II describes the methodology and data used to test these hypotheses. Empirical results are discussed in Section II, while a final section concludes with a discussion of the implications and limitations of thestudy.  \n\n## 1. Literature and Hypothesis Development  \n\nThis section starts with a discussion of reputation as an economic good, develops the notion of a market for affiliation, and concludes with hypotheses about the demand for VC affiliation by early-stage start-ups.  \n\n### A.Reputation and Affiliation as Economic Goods  \n\nReputation, which results from prior experience and performance, has been identified as an economically important asset that can generate future rents when information among actors is asymmetric (e.g., Shapiro (1983) and  \n\nBiglaiser (1993)). Starting with Spence (1974), there has been a sizeable theoretical literature on the phenomenon of actors without an established reputation signaling quality to the external market. For example, Bagwell and Bernheim (1996) present a theory of Veblen effects in which people engage in conspicuous consumption because material displays of relative wealth signal socialstatus.  \n\nA related strand of research suggests that performance benefits can be realized by the reputable producer's affiliates through a process of certification. This phenomenon has been examined in the context of reputable investment banks and VCs and the pricing of initial public offerings (Beatty and Ritter (1986) and Megginson and Weiss (1991). These agents can credibly stake their reputations on the claim that the IPOs they back are not overpriced as a result of their repeated interactions with external parties.  \n\nMore generally, for a certification to be effective, it must fulfill three conditions: (1) the certifying agent must have reputational capital at stake that would be compromised with an invalid certification; (2) the certifying agent's reputational capital must exceed the largest one-time wealth transfer from a miscertification; and (3) the certified target must face a cost of leasing the reputational capital of the certifying agent (Booth and Smith (1986)). This final condition is an important one for insuring that the certifying agent would have the proper incentives to invest in its own reputation. Unfortunately, it has not received much empirical attention; consequently it is this market for \"“leasing\" reputational capital (and the associated prices for doing so) that forms the core of the empirical analysis in this paper.  \n\nVenture capitalists meet the three previously stated criteria of certifying agents and can therefore be suppliers of certification (Megginson and Weiss (1991)). Start-ups, especially those in the early stages, often do not have an established reputation, and may therefore demand certification. Individual startups do not have repeated interactions with organizations associated with exiting an investment (e.g., acquiring firms or investment bankers), and therefore do not build a reputation in this community. In the market for affiliation, the supply of financial capital (and attention) from reputable VCs is limited. Furthermore, there is heterogeneity in the demand for such association because entrepreneurs have both different initial endowments of resources and reputation, as well as different expectations of the marginal benefit of affiliation.  \n\nThe market for affiliation is reflected in prices offered by VCs and accepted by entrepreneurs in the exchange of start-up equity for venture capital. Moreover, the price that VCs pay to acquire start-up equity is important to both entrepreneurs and VCs. For entrepreneurs, the valuation they receive at a round of financing determines how much equity is sold for a given capital infusion, and may have corporate control implications. VCs also care about price. In a liquidity event, VCs earn the difference between the share price at that time and the price they paid to acquire the start-up's equity. Interestingly, Megginson and Weiss put forward the notion that entrepreneurs may have to compromise valuation to “pay” for VC certification: “one of the services that entrepreneurial firms purchase with VC funding is easier access to capital markets and the ability of venture capitalists to reduce asymmetrical information in the offering process\" (1991, p. 883; emphasis added). Left unanswered, however, is the pur chase price start-ups pay to access reputable VCs. The next section therefore addresses the question of what makes a VC reputable.  \n\n### B. What Makes VCs Reputable?  \n\nThe business press and descriptive literature have characterized simple monetary capital infusion as commodity-like in the early-stage start-up process, and VCs have sought to differentiate themselves by the quality of business services and reputational capital they bring to their portfolio companies (e.g., New York Times (2000)). Some VCs argue that while start-ups might give up a larger equity stake in their company for a given capital infusion by a more experienced VC, the entrepreneur's remaining stake in his company is more valuable ex post as a result of the venture capitalist's value-added services. These services include business referrals, extensive mentoring, and financial assistance (MacMillan, Kulow, and Khoylian (1989)), which may be particularly important for early-stage start-ups (Roberts (1991)). Entrepreneurs seem to accept the reasoning that there is value in being associated with experienced and connectedVCs:  \n\nVenture funding is available from many sources. Entrepreneurs choose a lead venture partner to tap into practical experience, contacts, and reputations. “The money is all the same,” says Louis Volpe, president of Arrowpoint Communications. “But what type of additional value do you get? With Matrix Ventures, you get experienced people and a good network in telecom.\" Those intangibles can make the difference in landing a key early customer, attracting top caliber employees, and lining up the best IPO underwriters. The experience can make a real difference driving a brand new company in the right direction fast (Boston Globe (2000, p. D1)).  \n\nTherefore, as a VC gains more investment experience in a particular industrial sector, he or she is more likely to acquire the expertise needed to help start-ups in their portfolio acquire resources for successful development, which is a powerful contributor to VC reputation. Investment experience also accords with Gompers' (1996) age proxy for VC reputation. Each additional investment extends the VC's information network, either acquiring important social contacts and/or gaining experience in effectively structuring deals or monitoring entrepreneurs in the industrial sector (Sorenson and Stuart (2001)). For example, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, a prominent venture capital firm, claims to facilitate interorganizational cooperation among its network of portfolio companies by “brokering” strategically important information among them. As evidence, the firm claims that there are over 100 strategic alliances among its portfolio companies, and the firm's web site (www.kpcb.com) notes:  \n\nWe borrow the term “keiretsu\" from Japan's powerful networks of companies. However, unlike Japan, Kleiner's keiretsu is a particularly western, entrepreneurial, loosely coupled web of relationships. Kleiner doesn't control any ventures: they're each independent, run by strong, outstanding entrepreneurs. There's no central controlling bank, or interlocking board of directors. But the executives in the KPCB Keiretsu often share experiences, insight, knowledge, and information. This network, comprised of more than 175 companies and thousands of executives, has proven to be an invaluable tool to entrepreneurs in both emerging and developing companies.  \n\nLindsey (2002) provides empirical support for this VC “keiretsu\" phenomenon. Indeed, the VC information brokerage role can be particularly important to start-up development since these early-stage private firms face imperfect markets for information (Aoki (20oo)). Thin markets for information arise both because start-ups are secretive in order to protect their competitive position, and because there may be few alternate channels outside of a trusted third party for information dissemination.  \n\nIn addition, VCs acting as information brokers may assist a start-up in business development in different ways depending on the stage of the enterprise. In the earlier stages, VCs may help in recruiting senior executive officers (Gorman and Sahlman (1989) and Hellmann and Puri (2002)) and in striking strategic alliances (Stuart et al. (1999)). In the later stages of start-up development, VCs may help assemble additional funds and/or achieve liquidity. This may be done through hiring talented investment bankers (Barry et al. (1990) and Megginson and Weiss (1991) or in locating merger or acquisition partners (Gans, Hsu, and Stern (2002)). Because these resources are reinforced by the VC's investment experience in the start-up's industrial sector, entrepreneurial demand for VC affiliation should be increasing in the VC's industry deal experience. The dual hypotheses to be tested are therefore: (1) offers made by more reputable VCs are more likely to be accepted, and (2)the price that entrepreneurs pay in the market for affiliation is inversely associated with VC reputation.  \n\n## 11. Methodology and Data  \n\n### A. Methodology  \n\nTo test these hypotheses, I use a method drawn from Stern (2000) in collecting data on the bundle of offers—both accepted and declined—made to startups for financing the first professional round. This methodology, by taking an offer as the unit of analysis, is well suited to studying the market for affiliation because examining multiple price observations associated with VCs of varying reputation for a given start-up in effect traces out a demand curve for affiliation.3 Start-up firm effects can be held constant in examining valuation differences across financing offers, thus mitigating the problem of unobserved heterogeneity. Consequently, the empirical focus can shift to examining the role of differences in VC characteristics.  \n\nThe empirical models estimate two equations using a financing offer from the multiple-offers data set as the unit of analysis. The likelihood that an offer is accepted is modeled as  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Pr}(O H f e r a c c e p t e d=1)=F(V C R e p u t a t i o n,~V a l u a t i o n,~C o n t r o l s).\n$$  \n\nThis offer acceptance equation is estimated using fixed-effects logit models. The valuation equation is modeled as follows, and is estimated using fixed-effects OLS regressions:  \n\n$$\nV a l u a t i o n=F(V C R e p u t a t i o n,C o n t r o l s).\n$$  \n\nIn implementing this method, it is important to study early-stage financing rounds. Early-stage investors can weigh heavily in shaping the identity of subsequent investors (often through referrals or by virtue of their reputation). As well, earlier rounds of financing are usually associated with more technical and demand uncertainty. As a result, conventional valuation methods are difficult to apply to young firms with intangible assets, and so valuations of early-stage start-ups are subject to a great deal of negotiation (rather than straightforward calculation). The resulting heterogeneity in prices for association with disparate VCs (which themselves vary in reputation) is an important feature of early-stage funding rounds that help identify the market for affiliation.  \n\nThis section describes both the details of the data collection process and the data used to test the key hypothesis. Before doing so, however, it is useful to address two issues: (1) potential biases resulting from a simple cross-sectional analysis, and (2) data collection challenges associated with employing the proposed methodology. Regarding the first issue, unobserved, or mismeasured start-up qualities correlated with the price VCs pay for equity, such as differences in the demand for affiliation with reputable VCs, may bias cross-sectional estimates. Furthermore, there may be unobserved selection processes matching start-ups with VCs. Without detailed controls for such processes, cross-sectional estimates may be biased in a way sensitive to the sampling scheme.  \n\nTo collect data on a start-up's financing offers is a challenge in itself, since early-stage entrepreneurs are typically (and rightfully) reluctant to disclose information that might compromise their strategic position (Gompers and Lerner (1999) and Hellmann and Puri (20o0)). In addition, VC market consulting companies do not collect data on the bundle of financing offers received by startups. Consequently, obtaining the set of declined financing offers (rather than assembling a matched comparable, for example) requires asking entrepreneurs themselves for the sensitive information. I do so through a survey instrument. While designing and administering the survey was a labor-intensive process, few substitutes exist to gather detailed information about (1) the founding and organization of the start-up, (2) the VCs offering to invest in the start-up, and (3) the prices that were offered. A brief section describing institutional details about the sampled start-ups precedes a discussion about the data.  \n\n#### A.1. The MIT E-Lab Program  \n\nThe MIT Entrepreneurship Program offers a semester-long class, “Entrepreneurship Laboratory\" (\"E-Lab\"), which assembles teams of MIT and Harvard graduate students to study specific business-related issues at actual startups. In exchange for a complimentary business development analysis done by graduate students, the E-Lab firms’ senior executive officers commit to allocating a certain amount of time and effort to interacting with the students. E-Lab began in 1995 and approximately 300 start-up companies had applied to participate in the program by the summer of 20oo. Far more companies apply for the program, however, than the supply of student teams can accommodate.  \n\nIn order to qualify for E-Lab, the start-up has to meet two criteria: (1) its head count must be less than approximately 35 at the time of entering the program, and (2) it must have completed a Series A round of investment. This group of start-ups is an attractive one to survey for two reasons. First, the sample includes funded, early-stage start-ups that were not selected for any qualities related to the price that VCs paid for their equity. Second, because of the MIT Entrepreneurship Program affiliation, they may be more inclined to participate in this research study.  \n\n### B. Data  \n\nThe empirical approach requires measures ofVC reputation from firms offering to invest in the sample ofE-Lab firms, as well as information about the offers themselves. The survey instrument (see the Appendix) collects this information using a variety of measures, such as the entrepreneur's perceived reputation ranking ofinvestors from which it received a financing offer. More objective data about the VC's reputation (e.g., investment experience in each high-tech industrial segment) were collected from the Venture Economics database through Securities Data Corporation/Thomson Financial.  \n\n#### B.1. The Financing New High-Tech Ventures Survey  \n\nAfter pre-testing the survey with entrepreneurs (both those contemporaneously undergoing the Series A financing process and those who had already gone through it), VCs, academics, and intellectual property attorneys, I mailed the survey to the population of approximately 300 E-Lab companies. I then placed telephone calls to follow up with informants. The data were collected over the phone over 5 months starting July 15, 200o. Respondents to the survey were typically a founder and/or a person who knew the details of a firm's start-up and financing history (frequently this was one of the following senior executive officers: a CEO, CTO, and/or CFO).  \n\nNearly half of the companies in the E-Lab population responded to the survey. Nonrespondents seemed randomly mixed between those without time to participate in the survey and those (to a lesser extent) unwilling to participate in the study. Formal tests of differences between observables on the two samples are difficult, however, due to the data constraints on the firms not in the sample. Indeed, many of the firms in the E-Lab population were not yet listed in venture capital industry consulting firm databases.  \n\nThe survey responses yielded a total of 246 offers to 149 start-ups. While 98 of these start-ups received a single financing offer, 51 of them received more than one offer for financing their first professional round. The average start-up receiving multiple offers averaged almost three offers each, resulting in 148 offers made to this set of companies.  \n\nAs an overview of the entire sample, Table I (Panels A and B) reports the age distribution of start-ups in the sample, together with the distribution of offers received by the sample of E-Lab start-ups. The empirical puzzle in these data is that only $43\\%$ of the start-ups among those receiving multiple offers accepted their best financial offer. Moreover, the start-ups not accepting their most generous financial offer left a considerable amount of value “on the table,” amounting to $\\$173.9$ million in aggregate pre-money valuation. This was calculated as the sum of the differences between their best financial offer and the accepted offer. For the group of multiple-offer firms declining their best financial offer, the foregone pre-money value as a fraction of the accepted offer ranged from a low of $3.6\\%$ to a high of $217\\%$ , with an average of $33.2\\%$ for the sample. This descriptive interpretation ofthe data, of course, would be different if the overall sample of single and multiple offers were considered, as shown in Table I.  \n\nPanel B of Table I also describes the means of a wide range of start-up characteristics, broken out by the number of offers received. These characteristics include: start-up founding year; Series A financing year; number of employees prior to Series A funding; revenues from first year operations; patent applications and grants; industrial representation; and geographic location. The average start-up was founded in the first half of 1997 and received its Series A funding just 14 months later (over $80\\%$ of the start-ups in the data set received Series A funding between 1998 and 2000). Prior to receiving this funding round, the average start-up in the sample employed 10 people and had about $\\$0.27$ million in revenues from first year operations. As well, by the end of 200o, the typical start-up had applied for 5.4 patents and had received 1.2 patent grants. A high proportion of the start-ups, $74\\%$ , were located in Massachusetts, which may not be surprising given the nature of the E-Lab program (by comparison, $53\\%$ of the accepted VC offers were from Massachusettsbased VC firms). Additionally, $13\\%$ of the start-ups in the sample were located in California ( $15\\%$ of the accepted VC offers were from California-based VC firms).  \n\nThe industrial representation of the E-Lab start-ups in the sample is fairly typical of the broader set of industries funded by VCs over the same time period (theaverage $\\mathbf{E}$ -Lab firm in the sample received Series A funding in the middle of 1998). Of the sampled companies, $26\\%$ are in Internet services, $17\\%$ are in Internet infrastructure, and $5\\%$ are in Internet retailing. The software sector comprises about $16\\%$ of the sample, while computer hardware represents $6\\%$ of the sample. Communications and health sciences (biotechnology and medical devices) each comprise $10\\%$ of the sample, respectively. This distribution of firms seems to mirror the overall financing trends by VCs from 1997 to 2000. For example, according to Venture Economics, in 1999, $43\\%$ of VC disbursements went to Internet-based start-ups, and $57\\%$ of VC funds in the first three quarters of 2000 were invested in that sector.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"11\">Sum/Avg. 7 6 Number of Offers Received 5 3 2</td><td rowspan=\"11\">149 120 29 1 0 0 N 3 1 2 4 6 1 5 2 1 2 9 2 8 0 No. of firms accepting best financial offer Number of start-up firms Start-up characteristics</td><td>$174 million 1,393 million 80.5% 12.5% 1997.4 1998.6 11.9 10.1 0.3 1.2 5 0.2 15.3 34.7 0 NA</td><td>Sum/Avg. 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.3 0.7 0.4</td></tr><tr><td>44.1 1995.0 1999.0 34.7 15.0 0.0 2 2.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 3 N</td><td>0.0 0.0 0.0 13.7 N NA</td></tr><tr><td>N NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA</td><td>NA NA NA NA</td></tr><tr><td>1998.3 1999.3 10.9 15.7 0.1 3.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.3</td><td>0.7 1.0 0.0 0.0 0</td></tr><tr><td>16.7 42.5 256.5 16.6 1997.2 1999.0 48.6 23.0 0.8 12.2 0.7 0.8 0.2</td><td>0.5 0.5 0.0 0.0 14.3 0.7</td></tr><tr><td>50.8 74.2 68.5 15.4 9.7 0.3 7.8 2.0</td><td>0.5 0.7 2 0.5 3</td></tr><tr><td>1997.6 1998.8 5 9</td><td>0.5 5 0.0 0.1 8 0.7</td></tr><tr><td>42.9 56.5 147.3 38.4 1998.1 1998.8 11.3 9.4 3.8 0.5</td><td>0.2 0.6 0.4 0.2 3 0.5</td></tr><tr><td>869.4 1997.2 1998.5 8.9 2 4.9 1.2 5.

Panel C therefore compares sampled startups receiving single offers with those receiving multiple offers via $t$ -testsof equality of means. The results reveal that the start-ups' qualities between the single- versus multiple-offers subsamples were statistically the same between the groups.  \n\nPanel D presents similar tests for the subsamples ofVC characteristics. While these figures reflect accepted offers and are likely the result of a bargaining process between entrepreneurs and VCs, it is likely that the multiple-offers subsample contains the better deals (with higher pre-money valuations, more funding offered, and greater interest from more experienced VCs).  \n\nIn order to use the start-up fixed-effects methodology previously described, only the set of firms receiving multiple financing offers is analyzed in the remaining empirical tables. While selection issues as a result of this empirical strategy may be of concern, the finding that start-up characteristics are statistically the same across recipients of single- and multiple-financing offers is reassuring. As well, tests ofresult robustness using Heckman's (1979) selectionadjusted estimators employing the full data set are presented at the conclusion of the empirical analysis. While there are some potential costs to relying on the multiple-offers subsample (selection issues), the benefits are in identifying the affiliation effect, a result that will become clear by comparing the results using the multiple-offers methodology (Tables IV through VIII) with “crosssectional\" results based on realized financing outcomes of the entire E-Lab sample (Table IX). In addition, because the multiple-offers subsample likely contains better deals, this bias may actually make it more difficult to find an affiliation effect, since the most promising ventures would potentially have the least to gain from VC affiliation.  \n\n#### B.2. Variable Definitions and Summary Statistics  \n\nTable II reports variable definitions and summary statistics for the multipleoffers sample in which the unit of analysis is an offer to a start-up, while Table IHI contains the correlation matrix for these variables.  \n\nTwo measures of price are used in the empirical analysis.

The measure VC offer accepted is a dummy equal to 1 if an offer was accepted by the entrepreneur. The measure pre-money valuation is the product of the number of outstanding shares before the Series A round and the share price before the financing round (in $\\$1$ million).The measure relativevaluation offered is the offered pre-money valuation to a start-up relative to the highest offered valuation received by that start-up. The measure high industry deal experience is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the number of deals the VC has previously funded in the target start-up's industrial segment places the VC above the sample median. The measure industry reputation rank is the rank (a ranking of 7 being first best, with lower values indicating lower reputation) ofVC reputation among offers received, as rated by the entrepreneur. The measure high-normalized funds raised is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the number of prior funds (excluding buyout funds) the VC has raised per years of operation places the VC above the sample median. The measure high network resources rating is a dummy equal to 1 if a VC firm received the maximum Likert-scale measure (of 5) in at least one of the following entrepreneur-rated VC network resources: recruiting resources, contacts with customers and suppliers, or contacts with investment bankers. The measure boards per general partner is the number of boards of directors per general venture capital partner. The measure corporate VC is a dummy equal to 1 if the VC is a corporate VC. The measure angel investor is a dummy variable equal to 1 if a financing offer is from an angel investor or angel group. The measure financing offered is the amount of capital offered (in $\\$1$ million) by the investor. The measure equity taken threshold is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the investor receives at least $30\\%$ of start-up equity (the median of the sample) as a result of the Series A financing offer.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variable</td><td>Mean</td><td>SD</td><td>Source</td></tr><tr><td>DependentVariables</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VCoffer accepted</td><td>0.345</td><td>0.477</td><td>MIT Survey</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-money valuation</td><td>20.589</td><td>32.935</td><td>MIT Survey</td></tr><tr><td>Relative valuation offered</td><td>0.826</td><td>0.215</td><td>MIT Survey</td></tr><tr><td>VCReputationMeasures</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>High industry deal experience</td><td>0.439</td><td>0.498</td><td>VentureEconomics</td></tr><tr><td>Industry reputation rank</td><td>5.905</td><td>1.163</td><td>MIT Survey</td></tr><tr><td>High normalized funds raised</td><td>0.568</td><td>0.497</td><td>VentureEconomics</td></tr><tr><td>High network resources rating</td><td>0.432</td><td>0.497</td><td>MIT Survey</td></tr><tr><td>Boardsper general partner</td><td>4.198</td><td>2.405</td><td>VentureEconomics</td></tr><tr><td>VC- and Financing-Term Controls</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CorporateVC</td><td>0.048</td><td>0.214</td><td>Corporatewebsites</td></tr><tr><td>Angelinvestor</td><td>0.068</td><td>0.253</td><td>MIT Survey</td></tr><tr><td>Financing offered</td><td>7.863</td><td>8.944</td><td>MIT Survey</td></tr><tr><td>Equity taken threshold</td><td>0.520</td><td>0.501</td><td>MIT Survey</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nhas become a standard measure in the literature (Gompers and Lerner (2oo0)).

In any case, instead of focusing on the magnitude of valuation offered, the primary concern here is to explain variance across financing offers for a given start-up. Given these circumstances, relative valuation offered is the preferred measure of price throughout the empirical analysis (though pre-money valuation and relative valuation offered are positively correlated at 0.40).  \n\nThe key independent variables are correlates of VC reputation.4 In accord with the concept of VC reputation as expected quality based on previous experience, several “objective” measures are employed, based on data as of December 31, 20o0 from the Venture Economics database. They include high industry deal experience, a dummy variable equal to 1 if the number of investments the VC has made in the start-up's industrial segment places the VC above the sample median (mean $=0.44$ ). This is the main measure of reputation used in the empirical tables, and is consistent with the concept that VC “domain expertise\" is an important input to both VC reputation and VCs' ability to add value to their portfolio companies.  \n\nTwo measures proxy for services and resources that VCs provide for startups. The measure high network resources rating is a dummy equal to 1 if a VC firm received the maximum Likert-scale measure (of 5) in at least one of the following entrepreneur-rated VC network resources: recruiting resources, contacts with customers and suppliers, and contacts with investment banks $\\mathrm{{(mean=0.43}}$ 0. A second (alternative) measure of resource transfer is a proxy for the available time a general partner has to potentially devote to start-up development, boards per general partner $\\mathrm{\\Delta(mean=4.2)}$ . This measure divides the number of boards of directors on which a VC firm participates by the number of general partners in the VC firm. While the pairwise correlation between high network resources rating and boards per general partner is not particularly high (0.05), it is interesting to note that there is some degree of correlation between boards per general partner and high industry deal experience (0.46). These correlations may be due to a countervailing boards per general partner effect: A high ratio may proxy for network connections that may be valuable for start-up development.  \n\nFinally, two additional measures of reputation are used as robustness checks in the analysis. The measure high-normalized funds raised is a dummy equal to 1 if the number of prior funds (excluding buyout funds) the VC has raised per year(s) of operation places the VC above the sample median. This variable $\\mathrm{\\check{mean}}=0.57\\$ is a measure of VC success in raising additional financial capital from limited partners, a requirement for survival in the VC industry.5 While the internal rate of return (IRR) of past VC funds will be a nice measure of reputation, IRRs are usually held confidential by VC firms (Gompers and Lerner (1999). Industry reputation rank $(\\mathrm{mean}=5.9)$ is an ordered ranking, 7 being first best and 1 being worst, of VC reputation among offers received, as rated by the entrepreneur in the survey instrument (the measure has been reversed from the original survey-based measure for expositional ease). Because this variable is based on entrepreneurial perception and measures relative exclusiveness, industry reputation rank incorporates the notion that the value of affiliation may depend on the VC's hierarchical position (Frank (1985) and Podolny (1993)). The subjective nature of this measure warrants discussion of its use, however (see below); consequently this measure will be used only for robustness checks in the empirical analysis.  \n\nA group of controls for other VC characteristics is used throughout the empirical analysis. The variable corporate VC is a dummy variable $(\\mathrm{mean}=0.11)$ for whether the VC is a corporate investor, since evidence and theory suggest that this method of organizing entrepreneurial finance has different organizational and incentive implications relative to independent VCs (Gompers and Lerner (1999) and Hellmann (2002)). The variable angel investor is a dummy equal to 1 if a financing offer is from an angel or angel group $\\mathrm{(mean=0.07}$ ). The variable equity taken threshold is a dummy equal to 1 if the investor receives at least $30\\%$ of start-up equity (the median of the sample) $\\mathbf{\\chi}_{\\mathrm{mean}}=0.52$ 0.Whileequity taken threshold may be endogenous to price, this variable may be an indicator of corporate control implications of an offer, and is therefore included as a control variable. The variable financing offered is the amount of capital offered by the investor in the Series A financing round $\\mathrm{(m e a n=\\$7.86$ million). The previous two measures are meant to proxy for the fact that entrepreneurs may prefer offers that allow them to retain a higher stake of equity in their company. As well, larger financing offers may delay the need to return to VCs for additional funding, providing a liquidity benefit to the new venture.  \n\n### III. Empirical Results  \n\nThe empirical assignment is straightforward—to test the hypotheses that (1) financing offers from more reputable VCs are more likely to be accepted, and (2) more reputable VCs acquire start-up equity at a discount. This section is therefore organized around empirical tables that demonstrate these relationships in both univariate and multivariate settings.  \n\n# TableIV Univariate Difference in Means Tests  \n\nPanel A describes difference in means tests for accepted versus declined financing offers among offers received by start-ups with more than one Series A financing offer. The measure pre-money valuation is the product of the number of outstanding shares before the Series A round and the share price before the financing round (in $\\$1$ million).The measure normalized industry deal experience is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the number of deals the VC has previously funded in the target start-up's industrial segment per years of operation places the VC above the sample median. The measure normalized funds raised is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the number of prior funds (excluding buyout funds) the VC has raised per number of years of operation places the VC above the sample median. The measure industry reputation rank is the rank (a ranking of seven being first best, with lower values indicating lower reputation) of VC reputation in the start-up's industrial segment among received offers, as rated by the entrepreneur. The measure high network resources rating is a dummy equal to 1 if a VC firm received the maximum Likertscale measure (of 5) in at least one of the following entrepreneur-rated VC network resources: recruiting resources, contacts with customers and suppliers, or contacts with investment bankers. Panel B describes conditional means of relative valuation offered, the offered pre-money valuation to a start-up relative to the highest offered valuation received by that start-up, and equality of means tests for the upper and lower halves (divided at the median) of normalized industry deal experience, normalized funds raised, industry reputation rank, and high network resources rating.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Panel A: Difference in Means Tests</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Offer Accepted</td><td>Offer Not Accepted</td><td>t-Stat:Equal Means</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-money valuation</td><td>17.733</td><td>22.090</td><td>0.764</td></tr><tr><td>Normalized industry deal exp.</td><td>3.844</td><td>2.810</td><td>-1.282</td></tr><tr><td>Normalized funds raised</td><td>0.667</td><td>0.515</td><td>-1.771*</td></tr><tr><td>Industry reputation rank</td><td>6.588</td><td>5.546</td><td>-5.711***</td></tr><tr><td>High network resources rating</td><td>0.549</td><td>0.371</td><td>-2.093**</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Panel B: Conditional Means of Relative Valuation Offered</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Top Half</td><td>Bottom Half</td><td>t-Stat: Equal Means</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"6\">Relative valuation offered</td><td></td><td>Normalized Industry Deal Exp.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0.812</td><td>0.844 Normalized VC Funds Raised</td><td>0.880</td></tr><tr><td>0.820</td><td>0.834 Industry Reputation Rank</td><td>0.397</td></tr><tr><td>0.798</td><td>0.843</td><td>1.233</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>High Network Resources Rating</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0.804</td><td>0.842</td><td>1.070</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n, \\*, or \\*\\*\\* indicate statistical significance at the $10\\%$ ， $5\\%$ or $1\\%$ level, respectively.  \n\nTable IV shows simple univariate comparisons of conditional means without controlling for fixed firm effects. Panel A describes difference in means tests for accepted versus declined financing offers. While the average pre-money value of acceptedoffersis $\\$17.7$ million, the declined offers averaged $\\$22.1$ million (the difference is not statistically significant, however). Accepted offers had higher values of VC reputation relative to nonaccepted offers, as measured four ways. The measures normalized industry deal experience (industry deal experience per year(s) of operation), normalized funds raised (number of funds raised per year(s) of operation), industry reputation rank, and high network resources rating all have higher values for accepted offers relative to declined ones. The differences in means for the latter three variables are statistically significant. Panel B describes the conditional means of relative valuation offered for the upper and lower halves (divided at the median) of normalized industry deal experience, normalized funds raised, industry reputation rank,and high network resources rating. Examining the conditional means of relative valuation offered rather than pre-money valuation in this context is preferred because the former measure incorporates some information about the comparative nature of the offers. The latter measure does not group offers by start-up firms in any way. While the differences in conditional means for the four reputation measures are not statistically significant, each of the relative means is consistent with the argument that more reputable VCs offer a discount to Series A valuation. Specifically, higher measures ofVC reputation are associated with lower valuation offers. These univariate tests, while suggestive, do not control for qualities of the start-up, and so the remaining tables present a more systematic, multivariate analysis.  \n\nTable V examines start-up fixed-effects logits of VC offer accepted using Chamberlain's (1980) conditional likelihood method. Specification (5-1) shows that in the bivariate case, high industry deal experience is positively associated with VC offer accepted, at a statistically significant level $(5\\%)$ and implies a 2.94-fold change in the odds of offer acceptance for a discrete change in this measure of VC reputation. While a more systematic exploration of the robustness of the VC reputation result is found in Table VII, a similar result holds in the bivariate relationship between VC offer accepted and high-normalized funds raised. The reputation result is strengthened when a measure of valuation, relative valuation offered, is included in specification (5-2). Notice the relative importance of the reputation effect over the valuation effect on the likelihood that an offer is accepted. Specification (5-3) includes an additional measure ofVC reputation, high network resources rating, and controls for a variety of VC- and terms-of-financing-effects: angel investor, corporate venture capital, financing offered, and equity taken threshold. The high network resources rating measure is meant to capture VC value-added effects through contacts and/or resources that could make an offer more attractive (and can contribute to VC reputation). The estimated coefficient on this variable is positive and statistically significant at the $1\\%$ level. The measure angel investor is meant to capture the fact that a knowledgeable angel investor could be a substitute for a reputable VC in providing certification and business development resources, while the corporate VC method of organizing entrepreneurial finance may have implications for the value they can add to portfolio firms (Gompers and Lerner (1999)). Higher levels of financing offered may be a VC offer feature that may make it more attractive, since entrepreneurs may not have to return as many times or as soon for further financing rounds (fund-raising is an activity that  \n\n# TableV VC Offer Acceptance Logit Regressions  \n\nThis table shows start-up fixed-effects logit regressions on a sample of 148 offers across 51 start-ups receiving multiple Series A financing offers.

The measure high industry deal experience is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the number of deals the VC has previously funded in the target start-up's industrial segment places the VC above the sample median. The measure relative valuation offered is the offered pre-money valuation to a start-up relative to the highest offered valuation received by that start-up.

The measure $L$ financing offered is the natural logarithm of capital offered (in $\\$1$ million) by the investor. The measure equity taken threshold is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the investor receives at least $30\\%$ of start-up equity (the median of the sample) as a result of the Series A financing offer.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">IndependentVariables</td><td colspan=\"3\">DependentVariable=VC Offer Accepted N = 148 Observations</td></tr><tr><td>(5-1)</td><td>(5-2)</td><td>(5-3)</td></tr><tr><td>High industry deal experience</td><td>1.080**</td><td>1.168**</td><td>1.068** (0.556)</td></tr><tr><td>High network resources rating</td><td>(0.512)</td><td>(0.532)</td><td>1.415***</td></tr><tr><td>Relative valuation offered</td><td></td><td>0.606</td><td>(0.519) 2.157</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(0.887)</td><td>(1.425) 0.558</td></tr><tr><td>Angel investor</td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.799)</td></tr><tr><td>Corporate VC</td><td></td><td></td><td>-0.450 (0.972)</td></tr><tr><td>L financing offered</td><td></td><td></td><td>-0.329</td></tr><tr><td>Equity taken threshold</td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.593) 1.015</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.851)</td></tr><tr><td>Start-upfixed-effects Prob > x2</td><td>Yes 0.028</td><td>Yes 0.070</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Log likelihood</td><td>-49.195</td><td></td><td>0.016</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>-48.962</td><td>-42.974</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n\\*\\* or\\*\\*\\* indicate statistical significance at the $5\\%$ or $1\\%$ level, respectively.  \n\nmay be quite time-consuming for start-up executives). Finally, the reputation result is not sensitive to the choice of a wide range of equity taken threshold levels between 20 and $50\\%$ of equity taken in the financing round (unreported regressions).  \n\nNotice that start-up characteristics are not included in these specifications. Since start-up characteristics (such as industry representation) are invariant across offers for a given start-up, including these qualities in the regressions does not affect the results. In addition, because financing offers for a given startup did not span a large time window, variables on financing timing were not included in the regressions. In the pre-test of the survey, I asked respondents about the time window issue. It was my sense based on these interviews that the time window was not open for a long duration, given the start-up financing conditions of the late 1990s. Unfortunately, in the survey, I only noted the date of the realized Series A funding round, so I am unable to empirically document the time window length. Notwithstanding this shortcoming, the main result from Table V is that start-ups in this sample may not be selecting investors primarily on the basis of price and valuation; instead, VC reputation and affiliation effects may indeed be more important.  \n\nTable VI presents relative valuation offered start-up fixed-effects OLS regressions. The reported standard errors are robust—having been adjusted for clustering by start-up firm. The pairwise specification with high industry deal experience in (6-1) shows a negative relationship that is statistically significant atthe $5\\%$ level. As well, the estimated coefficient implies a substantial discount, $14\\%$ , on relative valuation offered for a discrete change in the measure ofVCreputation.  \n\nIn (6-2), together with the measure of VC reputation, a dummy variable for VC offer accepted is included as a regressor. Notice that this parameter estimate, while positive (in both (6-2) and (6-3)), does not achieve statistical significance and is small in magnitude. The reputation effect persists and is of a slightly larger estimated magnitude relative to the previous specification. In model (6-3), several additional variables (parallel to those used in the prior table) are introduced. While the economic significance of the reputation result is slightly diminished in this specification, the parameter is estimated more precisely, achieving statistical significance at the $1\\%$ level. While the high network resources rating estimate is not statistically significant, it is estimated with a negative coefficient, which is consistent with the main hypothesis tested. The estimated coefficient on equity taken threshold is negative and significant at the $1\\%$ level, suggesting that larger equity stakes are associated with price discounts, though as previously mentioned, endogeneity concerns moderate the interpretation of this control variable. As well, the logarithm of financing offered is estimated with a positive, significant coefficient, indicating that the magnitude of funding, including potential liquidity effects, is associated with higher valuation. While robustness checks of the valuation regressions are presented in Table VIII, the results presented in Table VI are consistent with the idea that start-up entrepreneurs pay a premium to accept financing from more reputable VCs.  \n\nBecause the above-reported results may be an artifact of either the particular measures used or due to selection biases arising from examining the multipleoffers data set, Tables VII and VIII present robustness checks of the reputation results for the offer acceptance and valuation regressions, respectively. The first three columns of Table VlI successively employ alternate measures of VC reputation in fixed-effects logits to study the robustness of the positive correlation between VC offer accepted and reputation in similar specifications to (5-3). Specification (7-1) substitutes high-normalized funds raised for high industry deal experience as one of the measures of reputation. While the statistical  \n\n# Table VI Valuation Regressions  \n\nThis table shows the result of start-up fixed-effects OLS regressions on a sample of 148 offers across 51 start-ups receiving multiple Series A financing offers.

Fixed-effects logit regressions of VC offer accepted, a dummy equal to 1 if an offer was accepted by the entrepreneur, on the sample of multiple offers are found in columns 1-3. The measure high industry deal experience is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the number of deals the VC has previously funded in the target start-up's industrial segment places the VC above the sample median. The measure high normalized funds raised is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the number of prior funds (excluding buyout funds) the VC has raised per years of operation places the VC above the sample median. The measure industry reputation rank is the rank (a ranking of 7 being first best, with lower values indicating lower reputation) of VC reputation among offers received, as rated by the entrepreneur. The measure high network resources rating is a dummy equal to 1 if a VC firm received the maximum Likert-scale measure (of 5) in at least one of the following entrepreneur-rated VC network resources: recruiting resources, contacts with customers and suppliers, or contacts with investment bankers. The measure boards per general partner is the average number of boards of directors per general venture capital partner. The measure angel investor is a dummy variable equal to 1 if a financing offer is from an angel investor or angel group. The measure relative valuation offered is the offered pre-money valuation to a start-up relative to the highest offered valuation received by that start-up. The measure corporate VC is a dummy equal to 1 if the VC is a corporate VC. Themeasure $L$ financing offered is the natural logarithm of capital offered (in $\\$1$ million)by the investor.

In (7-3), boards per general partner is used as an alternative measure of VC resources and is meant to capture the available time that partners in VC firms might have available in mentoring, developing, and connecting start-ups. While that variable is estimated with a nearly zero effect, the other reputation measure used in this specification, high industry deal experience, is estimated with quantitatively similar results (statistically and economically) to those found in Table V. Varying the measure of valuation as a control variable from relative valuation offered to the log of pre-money valuation causes high industry deal experience to fall tothe $6\\%$ level, but does not alter the economic significance of the estimate (unreported specification).  \n\nThus far, the analysis has not taken into account the possibility of a selection bias as a result of only using the multiple-offers data, though descriptive data from Table I suggest no statistical differences in the key observable start-up characteristics in the subsamples of the data corresponding to single versus multiple offers. Had we observed the alternate option for entrepreneurs that factually received single offers, would the results persist? Because establishing that counterfactual is difficult, two-stage Heckman (1979) regressions are presented where in the first stage, a probit of the likelihood of multiple offers is estimated using qualities of the start-up. These estimates are used in a second-stage fixed-effects regression of VC offer accepted (in Table VII) and relative valuation offered (in Table VIII) as an adjustment for possible selection effects.  \n\nThe first-stage regression in Tables VII and VIII includes start-up covariates of the likelihood of receiving multiple offers: the natural logarithm of the preSeries A number of start-up employees, $L$ initial employees; a dummy equal to 1 if the start-up does not have assigned patents, zero patents; dummy variables for the following industry sectors: Internet industry (including infrastructure, services, and retail subsegments); health science industry (biotechnology and medical devices); computer industry (software and hardware); and year of Series A financing dummies for Year 1998, Year 1999, and Year 2000.6 Secondstage fixed-effects Heckman linear probability estimates of VC' offer accepted are reported in the final two columns of Table VI1.7 While the bivariate specification including high industry deal experience (7-4) is estimated more precisely (significant at the $1\\%$ level) relative to its counterpart in (5-1), the economic magnitude of the estimate is diminished. Meanwhile, the fully specified model (7-5) yields estimates of similar statistical significance to its counterpart in (5-3), though again with diminished economic significance levels.  \n\nTable VIlI explores the robustness of the valuation results. A parallel specification structure to that used in the previous robustness table is employed. Specification (8-1) substitutes high-normalized funds raised as one of the measures of VC reputation. While the high-normalized VC funds raised variable is estimated with a positive (though insignificant) coefficient, recall that univariate comparisons in Table IV indicate that high-normalized VC funds raised was negatively correlated with relative valuation offered (although the difference was not statistically significant). In the multivariate regression, the prior funds variable may be picking up some countervailing effects, such that VCs with more prior funds raised are able to raise subsequent funds of larger sizes.8 The resulting relaxation in VC liquidity may have a confounding effect on this proxy for VC reputation.  \n\nSpecification (8-2) utilizes an alternate measure of VC reputation, industry reputation rank. The variable estimate is negative and statistically significant atthe $5\\%$ level. However, an objection to using this measure of reputation is that it is subject to entrepreneurial recall bias and/or ex post rationalization  \n\n# TableVIlI Valuation Robustness Regressions  \n\nThis table reports robustness checks on relative valuation offered, the offered pre-money valuation to a start-up relative to the highest offered valuation received by that start-up. Fixed-effects OLS analysis (with robust standard errors) on the sample of multiple offers is reported in columns 1-3. The measure high industry deal experience is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the number of deals the VC has previously funded in the target start-up's industrial segment places the VC above the sample median. The term high normalized funds raised is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the number of prior funds (excluding buyout funds) the VC has raised per years of operation places the VC above the sample median. The measure industry reputation rank is the rank (a ranking of 7 being first best, with lower values indicating lower reputation) of VC reputation among offers received, as rated by the entrepreneur. The measure VC offer accepted is a dummy equal to 1 if an offer was accepted by the entrepreneur. The measure high network resources rating is a dummy equal to 1 if a VC firm received the maximum Likert-scale measure (of 5) in at least one of the following entrepreneur-rated VC network resources: recruiting resources, contacts with customers and suppliers, or contacts with investment bankers.

As an imperfect control for these potential effects, a dummy variable for VC offer accepted is included in the specification because the accepted offer is likely to be the chief candidate for recall and retrospection biases. Although the reputation measure is statistically significant at conventional levels, we should interpret the result cautiously because ofthe limitations of this measure.  \n\nIn both specifications (8-1) and (8-2), high network resources rating, a measure of VC services to and resources for the start-up (and an important contributor to VC reputation), is estimated with a negative (though insignificant) coefficient, a finding consistent with the results from Table VI.9 Specification (8-3) varies this measure of VC resources to boards per general partner, and while the measure reaches statistical significance at the $10\\%$ level,the economic effect is insignificant. Importantly, note that the high industry deal experience proxy for VC reputation is robust (though reduced in statistical significance due to some degree of collinearity with boards per general partner).  \n\nIn an unreported regression, the log of pre-money valuation was used as an alternate measure of valuation. The estimates of high industry deal experience were robust to this variation. As well, introducing specifications with dummy variables for the most frequently appearing VC firms in the sample did not alter the main results (unreported regressions). These indicator variables may be appropriate if we believe that the pricing behavior of a handful of VCs is driving the results (over 100 distinct VC firms are represented in the sample, however).  \n\nFinally, in (8-4) and (8-5), fixed-effects Heckman regressions are reported using the entire sample of single and multiple offers in an effort to address potential selection issues. In both the bivariate and the fully specified equations, the results are very similar to those reported in Table VI—while the economic significance ofthe results is unchanged, the precision of the estimates is slightly enhanced.1o  \n\nA final robustness check suggested that the hypothesized affiliation effects could be found using within-industry variation, though these results are not formally reported because they are merely suggestive. With the caveat that the categories of “Internet\" (that includes Internet infrastructure, Internet services, and Internet retailing) and “non-Internet\" (that includes biotechnology, medical devices, communications, and computer software and hardware) are very coarse groupings, the measures ofVC reputation (high industry deal experience and high network resources rating) are positively associated with VC' offer acceptance and negatively associated with relative valuation offered, although these relationships tend to hold more strongly for the non-Internet subsample and less so for the Internet subsample.11 These results are based on parsimonious specifications (keeping the limited sample size issue in mind); however, due to the nature of the data set, no conclusions about whether these results are due to time period effects can be made.  \n\nTo conclude the empirical analysis, it is interesting to compare these results to a simple cross-sectional OLS analysis ofthe natural log of pre-money valuation on all accepted offers, done as if information on the bundle of declined offers were not available. The results, presented in Table IX, are striking.  \n\nIn (9-1), a bivariate regression, high industry deal experience, is estimated with a positive coefficient, which is significant at the $1\\%$ level. When several  \n\n# Table IX Cross-sectional Regressions  \n\nThis table reports OLS regressions, and is based on a sample of accepted Series A financing offers of 149 start-ups.

Conclusion and Discussion  \n\nI have tested and confirmed the proposition that entrepreneurs are willing to accept a discount on the valuation of their start-up in order to access the capital of VCs with better reputations. These results help deepen our understanding of the market for affiliation by presenting empirical evidence that affiliation is an ordinary economic good for which actors seeking association will face a price-reputation trade-off. This finding is consistent with the view that VCs' reputation (which in turn depends on their experience, information network, and direct assistance to the portfolio firms) may be more distinctive than their functionally equivalent financial capital. These conclusions are drawn from an analysis of multiple offers to a set of start-ups, which allows a high degree of statistical control. Because the characteristics of the start-up can be held constant, only differences in VC reputation across financing offers explain interoffer variation in offer acceptance and price for start-up equity.  \n\nOne may wonder why prices charged by competing VCs to acquire the equity in a given start-up can be differentiated in equilibrium, given free entry. VCs with higher reputations may be able to sustain their higher prices (rather than having competition equilibrate prices) as a result of investments in reputation being costly (Shapiro (1983) and Megginson and Weiss (1991). Consequently, while financial capital per se is not a differentiated good, the reputation of VCs providing the financial capital can be a source of differentiation among VC organizations. The findings in this article are consistent with Kaplan and Schoar's (2003) recent evidence of substantial cross-sectional variation and persistence in VC fund performance.  \n\nSeveral alternate explanations to the empirical pattern have been considered throughout the empirical analysis. First, more savvy VC firms might have foreseen the coming public market downturn and offered lower prices as a result. However, entrepreneurs receiving multiple offers would not necessarily have to accept offers from such VC firms, and so this explanation does not seem consistent with the observed empirical pattern. A second alternative hypothesis is that the term sheet covenants across offers for a given start-up may have differed. Indeed, the price VCs offer for equity may not be the only factor that matters when entrepreneurs select a VC firm, and other dimensions of the term sheet may not be “priced in\" to the offered valuations. While surveyed entrepreneurs were asked for a copy of their term sheet offers, very few complied with this request. However, Suchman (1995) provides some evidence of convergence in VC financing agreements over time as a result of using the same law firms. As well, while Kaplan and Stromberg (2003) find that covenants in VC contracts differ by stage of start-up development, the offered terms of financing for a given start-up across VC firms may not be as variable. Nevertheless, different VCs probably prefer different terms, and offered terms are likely to vary even for a given start-up in a particular time period. As a result, comparing offers primarily on the basis of price is an inherent limitation of the present study.  \n\nSeveral additional issues associated with the data used for this study result in interpretational concerns. First, are the findings simply an artifact of the sample used? Although this group of companies might be of higher quality relative to average start-ups (assuming that the decision to be involved with MIT is a signal of quality), the sample, while modest at 148 offers, may represent a conservative test of the hypothesized effect. High quality entrepreneurs have their own reputations and established networks, which would tend to obviate the need to pay a premium to access capital from more experienced funding sources. In any case, employing start-up fixed effects makes this quality issue less important for the purposes of the empirical analysis. Indeed, the unique timing of the study in an environment in which many VCs were “chasing after deals\" allowed identification of the market for affiliation—though it does not necessarily address the applicability of these results to other time periods or other relationships. It is difficult, unfortunately, to speculate on that answer.  \n\nA second issue is whether the results are produced from the competitive effect associated with studying a sample of multiple offers. This proposition is also hard to evaluate, however, due to the difficulty of establishing a counterfactual to single-offer situations. On a related note, a deeper understanding of the process leading to multiple offers would be desirable. The manifold processes generating offers (some of which are unobserved, such as entrepreneurial charisma), as well as the disparate bargaining processes leading to offers, makes the fixedeffects methodology attractive in controlling for unobserved heterogeneity. Nevertheless, had I collected information about the sequencing of offers, I might have been able to gain some empirical insight into the process generating multiple offers. Sequencing data may have also helped in beginning to empirically disentangle the pure affiliation effect from the VC value-added effect.  \n\nTwo issues related to offers and how they might affect the interpretation of the results are also worth discussing. First, what if entrepreneurs “shopped\" their deal to other VCs without receiving a formal term sheet? Unfortunately, I do not have the history of how many pitches entrepreneurs made to different VC groups without receiving formal offers. The results may be biased if (1) informal offers were leveraged to negotiate more favorable formal offers, and (2) VCs with a less established reputation were more willing to revise their valuations upward relative to VCs with more established reputations. Unfortunately, data constraints prohibit this analysis; however, survey respondents were instructed to provide information on final formal term sheets only (including informal offers would have subjected the sample to entrepreneurial interpretation of what constituted an informal offer). A second issue is whether some of the high valuation offers were withdrawn by VCs as the negotiations became more serious. Again, systematic data are unfortunately unavailable to address this question. If withdrawals came from across the full distribution ofVCs, this would not bias the results. If, on the other hand, withdrawals were systematically from less-reputable VCs, the study would be biased toward finding the results (and the opposite would be true if reputable VCs tended to withdraw offers). Given the market environment (\"money chasing deals\") in which these data were collected in the second half of 2o00 and my conversations with survey respondents, however, I believe that offer withdrawal was not a pervasive phenomenon in this sample. However, because I cannot rule out these two issues, they represent caveats to the study.  \n\nA final issue is interpreting what start-ups are buying. For example, industry deal experience in the start-up's sector can proxy for both the scope of the VC's information network as well as the VC's ability to evaluate deals. Unfortunately, the data in this study do not provide a clean way of disentangling these effects. As well, higher ability entrepreneurs may be taking a lower offer in an effort to signal quality (Spence (1974)). While the empirical setting and the documented empirical patterns make this explanation unlikely, the proposition cannot be ruledout.  \n\nLooking to the future, while this study does not test the ex post performance implications of selecting a particular VC, it would be interesting to do so. For example, did start-ups accepting funding from more reputable VCs receive higher step-ups in valuation in subsequent rounds? Did they achieve an IPO faster or deliver products to the market more quickly?12 Nevertheless, the findings in this study are consistent with the theory that entrepreneurs who are tied into more connected networks at reputable VC firms expect to come across more opportunities for start-up growth, but must pay a premium for such access.  \n\n12 As a preliminary analysis, I examined as of January 31, 2002 whether accepting funding from a more reputable VC was correlated with surviving in the post-bubble shakeout period. While there are issues about the appropriate lag time to examine such an effect, a substantial fraction of the firms in the sample are either still operating, or were acquired for an undisclosed amount, rendering an assessment of \"success\" difficult. For these reasons, these preliminary analyses were not illuminating.  \n\n## Appendix MIT Sloan Financing New High-Tech Ventures Survey  \n\nName of Firm: Location (city, state):  \n\n### Part I: Background Information  \n\nA.

HSU\\*  \n\nForthcoming, Journal of Finance  \n\n# ABSTRACT  \n\nThis study empirically evaluates the certification and value-added roles of reputable venture capitalists (VCs). Using a novel sample of entrepreneurial startups with multiple financing offers, I analyze financing offers made by competing VCs at the first professional round of start-up funding, holding characteristics of the start-up fixed. Offers made by VCs with a high reputation are three times more likely to be accepted, and high-reputation VCs acquire start-up equity at a 10 to $14\\%$ discount. The evidence suggests that VCs’ “extra-financial' value may be more distinctive than their functionally equivalent financial capital. These extra-financial services can have financial consequences.  \n\nA central issue for early-stage high-tech entrepreneurs is obtaining external resources when the assets of their start-up are intangible and knowledge-based. Particularly for entrepreneurs without an established reputation, convincing external resource providers such as venture capitalists to provide financial capital may be challenging. The literature contains two main lines of research for overcoming this problem. One research stream has concentrated on designing institutional structures to permit financing early stage ventures. This contractual- and monitoring-based approach is aimed at solving potential agency problems between investors and entrepreneurs (e.g., Admati and Pfleiderer (1994), Lerner (1995), Hellmann (1998), Kaplan and Stromberg (2001, 2002, and 2003)). A second research stream has suggested that when the quality of a start-up cannot be directly observed, external actors rely on the quality of the startup's affiliates as a signal of the start-up's own quality (e.g., Megginson and Weiss (1991), Biglaiser (1993), and Stuart, Hoang, and Hybels (1999)). This certification-based approach may help legitimate start-ups and entrepreneurs without a prior track record.  \n\nWhile the first research stream emphasizes the venture capitalist's problem (designing the appropriate mechanisms), the second highlights the entrepreneur's problem more directly (affiliating with highly reputable partners), and serves as an antecedent to this study. VC certification value, together with their value-added services such as recruiting executive managers (Hellmann and Puri (2002)), have led analysts in the descriptive literature to write: “It is far more important whose money you get [as an entrepreneur] than how much you get or how much you pay for it' (Bygrave and Timmons (1992, p. 208) and “From whom you raise capital is often more important than the terms\" (Sahlman (1997, p. 107). These views clearly indicate that VCs have different value-added potential and that venture capital represents more than strict financial capital to entrepreneurs. In contrast, the extant academic literature has not emphasized VC heterogeneity, implicitly treating VCs as one uniform class so that reputation differences among VCs are obscured (see Gompers (1996) and Kaplan and Schoar (2003) for exceptions). As well, whereas much of the previous literature has concentrated on the benefits to certification (e.g., Megginson and Weiss (1991), and Stuart, Hoang, and Hybels (1999)), the costs of affiliating with prominent actors have not been systematically analyzed empirically. For example, the prescriptive advice to start-up entrepreneurs of affiliating with the highest status partner possible (Stuart, Hoang, and Hybels) seems strong given that calculations of returns to such action that do not take into account the costs of affiliation may be overstated. Indeed, demand for affiliation with reputable actors is likely to vary with the cost of such association. More generally, because affiliation with reputable partners confers performance benefits, such association cannot be freely accessed, for otherwise certification agents would not have incentives to invest in acquiring a reputation in the first place (Shapiro (1983).  \n\nConsequently, this article explores two interlinked questions: Is there a market for affiliation with reputable partners? If so, what are the prices for such affiliation? Entrepreneurial demand for affiliation with venture capitalists provides an excellent empirical setting to explore these questions for two reasons. First, because VCs can certify and start-ups need to be certified, the exchange nature of the relationship provides a natural marketplace for affiliation. Secondly, due to the tremendous increase in the supply of venture capital in the second half of the 1990s,2 the situation of “money chasing deals” makes observing a menu of price offers by VCs with varying reputation more likely—a necessary condition for identifying the market for affiliation.  \n\nThe empirical analysis investigates proxies for VC reputation which explain the variation in offers accepted and valuations offered to start-ups at a point in time, while holding start-up characteristics fixed. To implement this methodology, I developed a novel, hand-collected dataset of 148 financing offers (both those accepted and declined) made to a group of 51 early stage high-tech start-ups. The estimated effects are both  statistically and economically significant. A financing offer from a high reputation VC is approximately three times more likely to be accepted by an entrepreneur. As well, highly reputable VCs acquire start-up equity at a 10 to $14\\%$ discount.  \n\nThe empirical results suggest that entrepreneurs are willing to forego offers with higher valuations in order to affiliate with more reputable venture capitalists. These results are consistent with the idea that venture capitalists act as more than strict financial intermediaries, placing funds from investors to capital-constrained start-ups. If this were not the case, we might expect entry by suppliers of entrepreneurial finance to equilibrate prices for start-up equity across offers to a given firm. However, if VCs differed in the bundle of services and certification they provide to their portfolio companies, which might be thought of as “extra-financial\" VC functions, then prices for affiliation might differ. This implies that the VC information network and its certification value may be more distinctive than their financial capital, and so these extrafinancial VC functions can have financial consequences—namely, the price at which VCs are able to acquire equity in a given start-up. Indeed, this view is consistent with the stylized fact that VCs experience substantial inter-industry variation in financial performance (Kaplan and Schoar (2003). Consequently, future research exploring variation within the VC industry, especially as it relates to organizational performance, would be interesting.  \n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section I discusses the relevant prior literature and derives hypotheses about the entrepreneurial market for VC affiliation. Section II describes the methodology and data used to test these hypotheses. Empirical results are discussed in Section Il, while a final section concludes with a discussion of the implications and limitations of the study.  \n\n## I. Literature and Hypothesis Development  \n\nThis section starts with a discussion of reputation as an economic good, develops the notion of a market for affiliation, and concludes with hypotheses about the demand for VC affiliation by early stage start-ups.  \n\n### A. Reputation and Affiliation as Economic Goods  \n\nReputation, which results from prior experience and performance, has been identified as an economically important asset that can generate future rents when information among actors is asymmetric (e.g., Shapiro (1983) and Biglaiser (1993)). Starting with Spence (1974), there has been a sizeable theoretical literature on the phenomenon of actors without an established reputation signaling quality to the external market. For example, Bagwell and Bernheim (1996) present a theory of Veblen effects in which people engage in conspicuous consumption because material displays of relative wealth signal social status.  \n\nA related strand of research suggests that performance benefits can be realized by the reputable producer's affiliates through a process of certification. This phenomenon has been examined in the context of reputable investment banks and venture capitalists and the pricing of initial public offerings (Beatty and Ritter (1986) and Megginson and Weiss (1991)). These agents can credibly stake their reputations on the claim that the IPOs they back are not overpriced as a result of their repeated interactions with external parties.  \n\nMore generally, for a certification to be effective, it must fulfill three conditions: (1) The certifying agent must have reputational capital at stake that would be compromised with an invalid certification; (2) the certifying agent's reputational capital must exceed the largest onetime wealth transfer from a mis-certification; and (3) the certified target must face a cost of leasing the reputational capital of the certifying agent (Booth and Smith (1986)). This final condition is an important one for insuring that the certifying agent would have the proper incentives to invest in its own reputation. Unfortunately, it has not received much empirical attention; consequently it is this market for “leasing” reputational capital (and the associated prices for doing so) that forms the core of the empirical analysis in this paper.  \n\nVenture capitalists meet the three previously stated criteria of certifying agents and can therefore be suppliers of certification (Megginson and Weiss (1991)). Start-ups, especially those in the early stages, often do not have an established reputation, and may therefore demand certification. Individual start-ups do not have repeated interactions with organizations associated with exiting an investment (e.g., acquiring firms or investment bankers), and therefore do not build a reputation in this community. In the market for affiliation, the supply of financial capital (and attention) from reputable venture capitalists is limited. Furthermore, there is heterogeneity in the demand for such association, because entrepreneurs have both different initial endowments of resources and reputation, as well as different expectations of the marginal benefit of affiliation.  \n\nThe market for affiliation is reflected in prices offered by VCs and accepted by entrepreneurs in the exchange of start-up equity for venture capital. Moreover, the price that VCs pay to acquire start-up equity is important to both entrepreneurs and VCs. For entrepreneurs, the valuation they receive at a round of financing determines how much equity is sold for a given capital infusion, and may have corporate control implications. Venture capitalists also care about price. In a liquidity event, VCs earn the difference between the share price at that time and the price they paid to acquire the start-up's equity. Interestingly, Megginson and Weiss forward the notion that entrepreneurs may have to compromise valuation to “pay” for VC certification: “one of the services that entrepreneurial firms purchase with VC funding is easier access to capital markets and the ability of venture capitalists to reduce asymmetrical information in the offering process\" (1991, p. 883; emphasis added). Left unanswered, however, is the purchase price startups pay to access reputable VCs. The next section therefore addresses the question of what makes a VC reputable.  \n\n### B. What Makes VCs Reputable?  \n\nThe business press and descriptive literature have characterized simple monetary capital infusion as commodity-like in the early-stage start-up process, and VCs have sought to differentiate themselves by the quality of business services and reputational capital they bring to their portfolio companies (e.g., New York Times (2000)). Some VCs argue that while start-ups might give up a larger equity stake in their company for a given capital infusion by a more experienced VC, the entrepreneur's remaining stake in his company is more valuable ex post as a result of the venture capitalist's value-added services. These services include business referrals, extensive mentoring, and financial assistance (MacMillan, Kulow, and Khoylian (1989)), which may be particularly important for early-stage start-ups (Roberts (1991). Entrepreneurs seem to accept the reasoning that there is value in being associated with experienced and connected VCs:  \n\nVenture funding is available from many sources. Entrepreneurs choose a lead venture partner to tap into practical experience, contacts, and reputations. “The money is all the same,” says Louis Volpe, president of Arrowpoint Communications. “But what type of additional value do you get? With Matrix Ventures, you get experienced people and a good network in telecom.? Those intangibles can make the difference in landing a key early customer, attracting top caliber employees, and lining up the best IPO underwriters. The experience can make a real difference driving a brand new company in the right direction fast. (Boston Globe (2000, p. D1).  \n\nTherefore, as a venture capitalist gains more investment experience in a particular industrial sector, he or she is more likely to acquire the expertise needed to help start-ups in their portfolio acquire resources for successful development, which is a powerful contributor to VC reputation. Investment experience also accords with Gompers’ (1996) age proxy for VC reputation. Each additional investment extends the VC's information network, either acquiring important social contacts and/or gaining experience in effectively structuring deals or monitoring entrepreneurs in the industrial sector (Sorenson and Stuart (2001)). For example, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, a prominent venture capital firm, claims to facilitate interorganizational cooperation among its network of portfolio companies by “brokering” strategically important information among them. As evidence, the firm claims that there are over 100 strategic alliances among its portfolio companies, and the firm's web site (www.kpcb.com) notes:  \n\nWe borrow the term “keiretsu from Japan's powerful networks of companies. However, unlike Japan, Kleiner's keiretsu is a particularly western, entrepreneurial, loosely coupled web of relationships. Kleiner doesn't control any ventures: they're each independent, run by strong, outstanding entrepreneurs. There's no central controlling bank, or interlocking board of directors. But the executives in the KPCB Keiretsu often share experiences, insight, knowledge and information. This network, comprised of more than 175 companies and thousands of executives, has proven to be an invaluable tool to entrepreneurs in both emerging and developing companies.  \n\nLindsey (2002) provides empirical support for this VC “keiretsu\" phenomenon. Indeed, the VC information brokerage role can be particularly important to start-up development since these early stage private firms face imperfect markets for information (Aoki (2000)). Thin markets for information arise both because start-ups are secretive in order to protect their competitive position, and because there may be few alternate channels outside of a trusted third party for information dissemination.  \n\nIn addition, VCs acting as information brokers may assist a start-up in business development in different ways depending on the stage of the enterprise. In the earlier stages, VCs may help in recruiting senior executive officers (Gorman and Sahlman (1989) and Hellmann and Puri (2002) and in striking strategic alliances (Stuart, Hoang, and Hybels (1999)). In the later stages of start-up development, VCs may help assemble additional funds and/or achieve liquidity. This may be done through hiring talented investment bankers (Barry et al. (1990) and Megginson and Weiss (1991) or in locating merger or acquisition partners (Gans, Hsu, and Stern (2002)). Because these resources are reinforced by the VC's investment experience in the start-up's industrial sector, entrepreneurial demand for VC affiliation should be increasing in the VC's industry deal experience. The dual hypotheses to be tested are therefore: (a) Offers made by more reputable VCs are more likely to be accepted, and (b) the price that entrepreneurs pay in the market for affliation is inversely associated with VC reputation.  \n\n## II. Methodology and Data  \n\n### A. Methodology  \n\nTo test these hypotheses, I use a method drawn from Stern (2000) in collecting data on the bundle of offers - both accepted and declined - made to start-ups for financing the first professional round. This methodology, by taking an offer as the unit of analysis, is well suited to studying the market for affiliation, because examining multiple price observations associated with venture capitalists of varying reputation for a given start-up in effect traces out a demand curve for affiliation.? Start-up firm effects can be held constant in examining valuation differences across financing offers, thus mitigating the problem of unobserved heterogeneity. Consequently, the empirical focus can shift to examining the role of differences in VC characteristics.  \n\nThe empirical models estimate two equations using a financing offer from the multipleoffers dataset as the unit of analysis. The likelihood that an offer is accepted is modeled as:  \n\n$\\mathrm{Pr}(O f f e r a c c e p t e d=1)=F$ (VC Reputation, Valuation, Controls). (1) This offer acceptance equation is estimated using fixed effects logit models. The valuation equation is modeled as follows, and is estimated using fixed effects OLS regressions:  \n\nValuation $=F$ (VC Reputation, Controls).  \n\nIn implementing this method, it is important to study early-stage financing rounds. Earlystage investors can weigh heavily in shaping the identity of subsequent investors (often through referrals or by virtue of their reputation). As well, earlier rounds of financing are usually associated with more technical and demand uncertainty. As a result, conventional valuation methods are difficult to apply to young firms with intangible assets, and so valuations of earlystage start-ups are subject to a great deal of negotiation (rather than straightforward calculation). The resulting heterogeneity in prices for association with disparate VCs (which themselves vary in reputation) is an important feature of early-stage funding rounds that help identify the market for affiliation.  \n\nThis section describes both the details of the data collection process and the data used to test the key hypothesis. Before doing so, however, it is useful to address two issues: (1) Potential biases resulting from a simple cross-sectional analysis, and (2) data collection challenges associated with employing the proposed methodology. Regarding the first issue, unobserved or mismeasured start-up qualities correlated with the price VCs pay for equity, such as differences in the demand for affiliation with reputable VCs, may bias cross-sectional estimates.  \n\nFurthermore, there may be unobserved selection processes matching start-ups with VCs. Without detailed controls for such processes, cross-sectional estimates may be biased in a way sensitive to the sampling scheme.  \n\nTo collect data on a start-up's financing offers is a challenge in itself, since early-stage entrepreneurs are typically (and rightfully) reluctant to disclose information that might compromise their strategic position (Gompers and Lerner (1999) and Hellmann and Puri (2000)). In addition, VC market consulting companies do not collect data on the bundle of financing offers received by start-ups. Consequently, obtaining the set of declined financing offers (rather than assembling a matched comparable, for example) requires asking entrepreneurs themselves for the sensitive information. I do so through a survey instrument. While designing and administering the survey was a labor-intensive process, few substitutes exist to gather detailed information about (1) the founding and organization of the start-up, (2) the VCs offering to invest in the start-up, and (3) the prices that were offered. A brief section describing institutional details about the sampled start-ups precedes a discussion about the data.  \n\n#### A.1. The MIT E-Lab Program  \n\nThe MIT Entrepreneurship Program offers a semester-long class, “Entrepreneurship Laboratory\" (\"E-Lab\"), which assembles teams of MIT and Harvard graduate students to study specific business-related issues at actual start-ups. In exchange for a complimentary business development analysis done by graduate students, the E-Lab firms’ senior executive officers commit to allocating a certain amount of time and effort to interacting with the students. E-Lab began in 1995 and approximately 300 start-up companies had applied to participate in the program by the summer of 2000. Far more companies apply for the program, however, than the supply of student teams can accommodate.  \n\nIn order to qualify for E-Lab, the start-up has to meet two criteria: (1) Its headcount must be less than approximately 35 at the time of entering the program, and (2) it must have completed a Series A round of investment. This group of start-ups is an attractive one to survey for two reasons. First, the sample includes funded, early-stage start-ups that were not selected for any qualities related to the price that VCs paid for their equity. Second, because of the MIT Entrepreneurship Program affiliation, they may be more inclined to participate in this research study.  \n\n### B. Data  \n\nThe empirical approach requires measures of VC reputation from firms offering to invest in the sample of E-Lab firms, as well as information about the offers themselves. The survey instrument (see the appendix) collects this information using a variety of measures, such as the entrepreneur's perceived reputation ranking of investors from which it received a financing offer. More objective data about the VC's reputation (e.g., investment experience in each high-tech industrial segment) were collected from the Venture Economics database through Securities Data Corporation/Thomson Financial.  \n\n#### B.1. The Financing New High-Tech Ventures Survey  \n\nAfter pre-testing  the  survey  with  entrepreneurs  (both  those contemporaneously undergoing the Series A financing process and those who had already gone through it), VCs, academics, and intellectual property attorneys, I mailed the survey to the population of approximately 300 E-Lab companies. I then placed telephone calls to follow up with informants. The data were collected over the phone over five months starting July 15, 2000. Respondents to the survey were typically a founder and/or a person who knew the details of a firm's start-up and financing history (frequently this was one of the following senior executive officers: a CEO, CTO, and/or CFO).  \n\nNearly half of the companies in the E-Lab population responded to the survey. Nonrespondents seemed randomly mixed between those without time to participate in the survey and those (to a lesser extent) unwilling to participate in the study. Formal tests of differences between observables on the two samples are difficult, however, due to the data constraints on the firms not in the sample. Indeed, many of the firms in the E-Lab population were not yet listed in venture capital industry consulting firm databases.  \n\nThe survey responses yielded a total of 246 offers to 149 start-ups. While 98 of these start-ups received a single financing offer, 51 of them received more than one offer for financing their first professional round. The average start-up receiving multiple offers averaged almost three offers each, resulting in 148 offers made to this set of companies.  \n\nAs an overview of the entire sample, Table I (Panels A and B) reports the age distribution of start-ups in the sample, together with the distribution of offers received by the sample of E  \n\nLab start-ups. The empirical puzzle in these data is that only $43\\%$ of the start-ups among those receiving multiple offers accepted their best financial offer. Moreover, the start-ups not accepting their most generous financial offer left a considerable amount of value “on the table,” amounting to $\\$173.9\\mathrm$ in aggregate pre-money valuation. This was calculated as the sum of the differences between their best financial offer and the accepted offer. For the group of multiple offer firms declining their best financial offer, the foregone pre-money value as a fraction of the accepted offer ranged from a low of $3.6\\%$ to a high of $217\\%$ , with an average of $33.2\\%$ for the sample. This descriptive interpretation of the data, of course, would be different if the overall sample of single and multiple offers were considered, as shown in Table I.  \n\n# [Insert TABLE I around here]  \n\nPanel B of Table I also describes the means of a wide range of start-up characteristics, broken out by the number of offers received. These characteristics include start-up founding year; Series A financing year; number of employees prior to Series A funding; revenues from first year operations; patent applications and grants; industrial representation; and geographic location. The average start-up was founded in the first half of 1997 and received its Series A funding just 14 months later (over $80\\%$ of the start-ups in the dataset received Series A funding between 1998 and 2000). Prior to receiving this funding round, the average start-up in the sample employed 10 people and had about $\\$0.27\\mathrm{M}$ in revenues from first-year operations. As well, by the end of 2000, the typical start-up had applied for 5.4 patents and had received 1.2 patent grants. A high proportion of the start-ups, $74\\%$ , were located in Massachusetts, which may not be surprising given the nature of the E-Lab program (by comparison, $53\\%$ of the accepted VC offers were from Massachusetts-based VC firms). Additionally, $13\\%$ of the start-ups in the sample were located in California ( $15\\%$ of the accepted VC offers were from California-based VC firms).  \n\nThe industrial representation of the E-Lab start-ups in the sample is fairly typical of the broader set of industries funded by venture capitalists over the same time period (the average ELab firm in the sample received Series A funding in the middle of 1998). Of the sampled companies, $26\\%$ are in Internet services, $17\\%$ are in Internet infrastructure, and $5\\%$ are in Internet retailing. The software sector comprises about $16\\%$ of the sample, while computer hardware represents $6\\%$ of the sample. Communications and health sciences (biotechnology and medical devices) each comprise $10\\%$ of the sample, respectively. This distribution of firms seems to mirror the overall financing trends by VCs from 1997 to 2000. For example, according to Venture Economics, in 1999, $43\\%$ of VC disbursements went to Internet-based start-ups, and $57\\%$ of VC funds in the first three quarters of 20o0 were invested in that sector.  \n\nWhile Panel B of Table I presents the conditional means of the observable start-up characteristics by the number of offers received, it is difficult to tell whether statistical differences exist. Panel C therefore compares sampled start-ups receiving single offers with those receiving multiple offers via $t\\cdot$ -tests of equality of means. The results reveal that the startups’ qualities between the single versus multiple-offers subsamples were statistically the same between the groups.  \n\nPanel D presents similar tests for the subsamples of VC characteristics. While these figures reflect accepted offers and are likely the result of a bargaining process between entrepreneurs and VCs, it is likely that the multiple-offers subsample contains the better deals (with higher pre-money valuations, more funding offered, and greater interest from more experiencedVCs).  \n\nIn order to use the start-up fixed effects methodology previously described, only the set of firms receiving multiple financing offers is analyzed in the remaining empirical tables. While selection issues as a result of this empirical strategy may be of concern, the finding that start-up characteristics are statistically the same across recipients of single- and multiple-financing offers is reassuring. As well, tests of result robustness using Heckman's (1979) selection-adjusted estimators employing the full dataset are presented at the conclusion of the empirical analysis. While there are some potential costs to relying on the multiple-offers subsample (selection issues), the benefits are in identifying the affiliation effect, a result that will become clear by comparing the results using the multiple offers methodology (Tables IV through VIl) with \"cross-sectional’ results based on realized financing outcomes of the entire E-Lab sample (Table IX). In addition, because the multiple-offers subsample likely contains better deals, this bias may actually make it more difficult to find an affiliation effect, since the most promising ventures would potentially have the least to gain from VC affiliation.  \n\n### B.2. Variable Definitions and Summary Statistics  \n\nTable II reports variable definitions and summary statistics for the multiple-offers sample in which the unit of analysis is an offer to a start-up, while Table Il contains the correlation matrix for these variables.  \n\n# [Insert TABLE II and TABLE III around here]  \n\nTwo measures of price are used in the empirical analysis. Pre-money valuation, the product of the number of shares outstanding before the Series A financing round and the offered per-unit share price $(\\mathrm{mean}=\\mathbb{S}20.6\\mathrm{M})$ , has become a standard measure in the literature (Gompers and Lerner (2000)). Relative valuation offered is the offered pre-money valuation to a start-up relative to the highest offered valuation received by that start-up $\\mathrm{(mean~=~0.83,}$ 0. Note that because many of these financing rounds took place during the late 1990s, the inflated valuations characterizing the “Internet bubble” are likely reflected here. Two additional factors may also be reflected in these valuations: (1) Several of the companies had prior informal funding roundssuch as “angel\" and/or “friends and family” rounds before their first professional round, and (2) financing offers given to start-ups with multiple offers averaged $\\$8.9\\mathrm$ more in pre-money valuation relative to their single-offer counterparts, a statistically significant difference. In any case, instead of focusing on the magnitude of valuation offered, the primary concern here is to explain variance across financing offers for a given start-up. Given these circumstances, relative valuation offered is the preferred measure of price throughout the empirical analysis (though premoney valuation and relative valuation offered are positively correlated at 0.40).  \n\nThe key independent variables are correlates of VC reputation. In accord with the concept of VC reputation as expected quality based on previous experience, several “objective\" measures are employed, based on data as of December 31, 20o0 from the Venture Economics database. They include high industry deal experience, a dummy variable equal to 1 if the number of investments the VC has made in the start-up's industrial segment places the VC above the sample median $\\left(\\mathrm{mean}=0.44\\right)$ . This is the main measure of reputation used in the empirical tables, and is consistent with the concept that VC “domain expertise”’ is an important input to both VC reputation and VCs ability to add value to their portfolio companies.  \n\nTwo measures proxy for services and resources that VCs provide for start-ups. The measure high network resources rating is a dummy equal to 1 if a VC firm received the maximum Likert-scale measure (of five) in at least one of the following entrepreneur-rated VC network resources: Recruiting resources, contacts with customers and suppliers, and contacts with investment banks $\\mathrm{(mean=0.43}$ ). A second (alternative) measure of resource transfer is a proxy for the available time a general partner has to potentially devote to start-up development, boards per general partner $(\\mathrm{mean}=4.2)$ . This measure divides the number of boards of directors on which a VC firm participates by the number of general partners in the VC firm. While the pair-wise correlation between high network resources rating and boards per general partner is not particularly high (0.05), it is interesting to note that there is some degree of correlation between boards per general partner and high industry deal experience (0.46). These correlations may be due to a countervailing boards per general partner effect: A high ratio may proxy for network connections that may be valuable for start-up development.  \n\nFinally, two additional measures of reputation are used as robustness checks in the analysis. The measure high normalized funds raised is a dummy equal to 1 if the number of prior funds (excluding buyout funds) the VC has raised per year(s) of operation places the VC above the sample median. This variable $(\\mathrm{mean}=0.57\\$ ) is a measure of VC success in raising additional financial capital from limited partners, a requirement for survival in the VC industry. While the internal rate of return (IRR) of past VC funds would be a nice measure of reputation, IRRs are usually held confidential by VC firms (Gompers and Lerner (1999)). Industry reputation rank $(\\mathrm{mean}=5.9)$ is an ordered ranking, 7 being first best and 1 being worst, of VC reputation among offers received, as rated by the entrepreneur in the survey instrument (the measure has been reversed from the original survey-based measure for expositional ease). Because this variable is based on entrepreneurial perception and measures relative exclusiveness, industry reputation rank incorporates the notion that the value of affiliation may depend on the VC's hierarchical position (Frank (1985) and Podolny (1993)). The subjective nature of this measure warrants discussion of its use, however (see below); consequently this measure will be used only for robustness checks in the empirical analysis.  \n\nA group of controls for other VC characteristics is used throughout the empirical analysis. The variable corporate $V C$ is a dummy variable $\\mathrm{\\underline{{{\\sigma}}}m e a n}=0.11\\$ ) for whether the VC is a corporate investor, since evidence and theory suggest that this method of organizing entrepreneurial finance has different organizational and incentive implications relative to independent venture capitalists (Gompers and Lerner (1999) and Hellmann (2002)). The variable angel investor is a dummy equal to 1 if a financing offer is from an angel or angel group (mean $=$ 0.07). The variable equity taken threshold is a dummy equal to 1 if the investor receives at least $30\\%$ of start-up equity (the median of the sample) $(\\mathrm{mean}=0.52)$ .While equity taken threshold may be endogenous to price, this variable may be an indicator of corporate control implications of an offer, and is therefore included as a control variable. The variable financing offered is the amount of capital offered by the investor in the Series A financing round $\\mathrm{(mean=47.86M)}$ . The previous two measures are meant to proxy for the fact that entrepreneurs may prefer offers that allow them to retain a higher stake of equity in their company. As well, larger financing offers may delay the need to return to venture capitalists for additional funding, providing a liquidity benefit to the new venture.  \n\n## III. Empirical Results  \n\nThe empirical assignment is straightforward—to test the hypotheses that (a) financing offers from more reputable VCs are more likely to be accepted, and (b) more reputable VCs acquire start-up equity at a discount. This section is therefore organized around empirical tables that demonstrate these relationships in both univariate and multivariate settings.  \n\nTable IV shows simple univariate comparisons of conditional means without controlling for fixed firm effects. Panel A describes difference in means tests for accepted versus declined financing offers. While the average pre-money value of accepted offers is $\\$17.7\\mathrm{M}$ the declined offers averaged $\\$22.1\\mathrm{M}$ (the difference is not statistically significant, however). Accepted offers had higher values of VC reputation relative to non-accepted offers, as measured four ways. The measures  normalized industry deal experience  (industry deal  experience per year(s) of operation), normalized funds raised (number of funds raised per year(s) of operation), industry reputation rank, and high network resources rating all have higher values for accepted offers relative to declined ones. The differences in means for the latter three variables are statistically significant. Panel B describes the conditional means of relative valuation offered for the upper and lower halves (divided at the median) of normalized industry deal experience, normalized funds raised, industry reputation rank, and high network resources rating. Examining the conditional means of relative valuation offered rather than pre-money valuation in this context is preferred because the former measure incorporates some information about the comparative nature of the offers. The latter measure does not group offers by start-up firms in any way. While the differences in conditional means for the four reputation measures are not statistically significant, each of the relative means is consistent with the argument that more reputable VCs offer a discount to Series A valuation. Specifically, higher measures of VC reputation are associated with lower valuation offers. These univariate tests, while suggestive, do not control for qualities of the start-up, and so the remaining tables present a more systematic, multivariate analysis.  \n\n# [Insert TABLE IV around here]  \n\nTable V examines start-up fixed effects logits of VC offer accepted using Chamberlain's (1980) conditional likelihood method. Specification (5-1) shows that in the bivariate case, high industry deal experience is positively associated with VC offer accepted, at a statistically significant level $(5\\%)$ and implies a 2.94-fold change in the odds of offer acceptance for a discrete change in this measure of VC reputation. While a more systematic exploration of the robustness of the VC reputation result is found in Table VIl, a similar result holds in the bivariate relationship between VC offer accepted and high normalized funds raised. The reputation result is strengthened when a measure of valuation, relative valuation offered, is included in specification (5-2). Notice the relative importance of the reputation effect over the valuation effect on the likelihood that an offer is accepted. Specification (5-3) includes an additional measure of VC reputation, high network resources rating, and controls for a variety of VC- and terms-of-financing-effects: Angel investor, corporate venture capital, financing offered, and equity taken threshold. The high network resources rating measure is meant to capture VC value-added effects through contacts and/or resources that could make an offer more attractive (and can contribute to VC reputation). The estimated coefficient on this variable is positive and statistically significant at the $1\\%$ level. The measure angel investor is meant to capture the fact that a knowledgeable angel investor could be a substitute for a reputable VC in providing certification and business development resources, while the corporate $V C$ method of organizing entrepreneurial finance may have implications for the value they can add to portfolio firms (Gompers and Lerner (1999)). Higher levels of financing offered may be a VC offer feature that may make it more attractive, since entrepreneurs may not have to return as many times or as soon for further financing rounds (fund-raising is an activity that may be quite time-consuming for start-up executives). Finally, the reputation result is not sensitive to the choice of a wide range of equity taken threshold levels between 20 and $50\\%$ of equity taken in the financing round (unreported regressions).  \n\n# [Insert TABLE V around here]  \n\nNotice that start-up characteristics are not included in these specifications. Since start-up characteristics (such as industry representation) are invariant across offers for a given start-up, including these qualities in the regressions does not affect the results. In addition, because financing offers for a given start-up did not span a large time window, variables on financing timing were not included in the regressions. In the pre-test of the survey, I asked respondents about the time window issue. It was my sense based on these interviews that the time window was not open for a long duration, given the start-up financing conditions of the late 1990s. Unfortunately, in the survey, I only noted the date of the realized Series A funding round, so I am unable to empirically document the time window length. Notwithstanding this shortcoming, the main result from Table V is that start-ups in this sample may not be selecting investors primarily on the basis of price and valuation; instead, VC reputation and affiliation effects may indeed be more important.  \n\nTable VI presents relative valuation offered start-up fixed effects OLS regressions. The reported standard errors are robust - having been adjusted for clustering by start-up firm. The pairwise specification with high industry deal experience in (6-1) shows a negative relationship that is  statistically significant at the $5\\%$ level. As well, the estimated coefficient implies a substantial discount, $14\\%$ , on relative valuation offered for a discrete change in the measure of VC reputation.  \n\n# [Insert TABLE VI around here]  \n\nIn (6-2), together with the measure of VC reputation, a dummy variable for VC offer accepted is included as a regressor. Notice that this parameter estimate, while positive (in both 6- 2) and (6-3)), does not achieve statistical significance and is small in magnitude. The reputation effect persists and is of a slightly larger estimated magnitude relative to the previous specification. In model (6-3), several additional variables (parallel to those used in the prior table) are introduced. While the economic significance of the reputation result is slightly diminished in this specification, the parameter is estimated more precisely, achieving statistical significance at the $1\\%$ level. While the high network resources rating estimate is not statistically significant, it is estimated with a negative coefficient, which is consistent with the main hypothesis tested. The estimated coefficient on equity taken threshold is negative and significant at the $1\\%$ level, suggesting that larger equity stakes are associated with price discounts, though as previously mentioned, endogeneity concerns moderate the interpretation of this control variable. As well, the logarithm of financing offered is estimated with a positive, significant coefficient, indicating that the magnitude of funding, including potential liquidity effects, is associated with higher valuation. While robustness checks of the valuation regressions are presented in Table VIll, the results presented in Table VI are consistent with the idea that startup entrepreneurs pay a premium to accept financing from more reputable venture capitalists.  \n\nBecause the above-reported results may be an artifact of either the particular measures used or due to selection biases arising from examining the multiple-offers dataset, Tables VII and VIll present robustness checks of the reputation results for the offer acceptance and valuation regressions, respectively. The first three columns of Table Vll successively employ alternate measures of VC reputation in fixed effects logits to study the robustness of the positive correlation between VC offer accepted and reputation in similar specifications to (5-3). Specification (7-1) substitutes high normalized funds raised for high industry deal experience as one of the measures of reputation. While the statistical significance falls to the $10\\%$ level, a discrete change in the funds raised measure corresponds to a doubling of the odds that an offer is accepted. Relative to specification (5-3), the estimated coefficient of high network resource rating is very similar in (7-1), both in magnitude and in statistical significance. In (7-2), industry reputation rank substitutes for high industry deal experience as an alternative measure of VC reputation. In this specification, both industry reputation rank and high network resources rating are positive and significant at the $1\\%$ level, though the estimated coefficient on relative valuation offered is much larger in comparative magnitude than the reputation measures. In (7-3), boards per general partner is used as an alternative measure of VC resources and is meant to capture the available time that partners in VC firms might have available in mentoring, developing, and connecting start-ups. While that variable is estimated with a nearly zero effect, the other reputation measure used in this specification, high industry deal experience, is estimated with quantitatively similar results (statistically and economically) to those found in Table V. Varying the measure of valuation as a control variable from relative valuation offered to the log of premoney valuation causes high industry deal experience to fall to the $6\\%$ level, but does not alter the economic significance of the estimate (unreported specification).  \n\n# [Insert TABLE VII around here]  \n\nThus far, the analysis has not taken into account the possibility of a selection bias as a result of only using the multiple offers data, though descriptive data from Table I suggest no statistical differences in the key observable start-up characteristics in the subsamples of the data corresponding to single versus multiple offers. Had we observed the alternate option for entrepreneurs that factually received single offers, would the results persist? Because establishing that counterfactual is difficult, two-stage Heckman (1979) regressions are presented where in the first stage, a probit of the likelihood of multiple offers is estimated using qualities of the start-up. These estimates are used in a second-stage fixed-effects regression of VC offer accepted (in Table VIl) and relative valuation offered (in Table VIlI) as an adjustment for possible selection effects.  \n\nThe first-stage regression in Tables VII and VIlI includes start-up covariates of the likelihood of receiving multiple offers: The natural logarithm of the pre-Series A number of start-up employees, $L$ initial employees; a dummy equal to 1 if the start-up does not have assigned patents, zero patents; dummy variables for the following industry sectors: Internet industry (including infrastructure, services, and retail subsegments); health science industry (biotechnology and medical devices); computer industry (software and hardware); and year of Series A financing dummies for Year 1998, Year 1999, and Year 2000.° Second-stage fixedeffects Heckman linear probability estimates of VC offer accepted are reported in the final two columns of Table VIl.? While the bivariate specification including high industry deal experience (7-4) is estimated more precisely (significant at the $1\\%$ level) relative to its counterpart in (5-1), the economic magnitude of the estimate is diminished. Meanwhile, the fully specified model (7- 5) yields estimates of similar statistical significance to its counterpart in (5-3), though again with diminished economic significance levels.  \n\nTable Vll explores the robustness of the valuation results. A parallel specification structure to that used in the previous robustness table is employed. Specification (8-1) substitutes high normalized funds raised as one of the measures of VC reputation. While the high normalized VC funds raised variable is estimated with a positive (though insignificant) coefficient, recall that univariate comparisons in Table IV indicate that high normalized VC funds raised was negatively correlated with relative valuation offered (although the difference was not statistically significant). In the multivariate regression, the prior funds variable may be picking up some countervailing effects, such that VCs with more prior funds raised are able to raise subsequent funds of larger sizes.\\* The resulting relaxation in VC liquidity may have a confounding effect on this proxy for VC reputation.  \n\n# [Insert TABLE VIII around here]  \n\nSpecification (8-2) utilizes an alternate measure of VC reputation, industry reputation rank. The variable estimate is negative and statistically significant at the $5\\%$ level. However, an objection to using this measure of reputation is that it is subject to entrepreneurial recall bias and/or ex-post rationalization by the survey respondent. As an imperfect control for these potential effects, a dummy variable for VC offer accepted is included in the specification, because the accepted offer is likely to be the chief candidate for recall and retrospection biases. Although the reputation measure is statistically significant at conventional levels, we should interpret the result cautiously because of the limitations of this measure.  \n\nIn both specifications (8-1) and (8-2), high network resources rating, a measure of VC services to and resources for the start-up (and an important contributor to VC reputation), is estimated with a negative (though insignificant) coefficient, a finding consistent with the results from Table VI.? Specification (8-3) varies this measure of VC resources to boards per general partner, and while the measure reaches statistical significance at the $10\\%$ level, the economic effect is insignificant. Importantly, note that the high industry deal experience proxy for VC reputation is robust (though reduced in statistical significance due to some degree of collinearity with boards per general partner). In an unreported regression, the log of pre-money valuation was used as an alternate measure of valuation. The estimates of high industry deal experience were robust to this variation. As well, introducing specifications with dummy variables for the most frequently appearing VC firms in the sample did not alter the main results (unreported regressions). These indicator variables may be appropriate if we believe that the pricing behavior of a handful of VCs is driving the results (over 100 distinct VC firms are represented in the sample, however).  \n\nFinally, in (8-4) and (8-5), fixed-effects Heckman regressions are reported using the entire sample of single and multiple offers in an effort to address potential selection issues. In both the bivariate and the fully specified equations, the results are very similar to those reported in Table VI—while the economic significance of the results is unchanged, the precision of the estimates is slightly enhanced. o  \n\nA final robustness check suggested that the hypothesized affiliation effects can be found using within-industry variation, though these results are not formally reported because they are merely suggestive. With the caveat that the categories of “Internet’ (that includes Internet infrastructure, Internet services, and Internet retailing) and “non-Internet’ (that includes biotechnology, medical devices, communications, and computer software and hardware) are very coarse groupings, the measures of VC reputation (high industry deal experience and high network resources rating) are positively associated with VC offer acceptance and negatively associated with relative valuation offered, although these relationships tend to hold more strongly for the non-Internet subsample and less so for the Internet subsample. These results are based on parsimonious specifications (keeping the limited sample size issue in mind); however, due to the nature of the dataset, no conclusions about whether these results are due to time period effects can be made.  \n\nTo conclude the empirical analysis, it is interesting to compare these results to a simple cross-sectional OLS analysis of the natural log of pre-money valuation on all accepted offers, done as if information on the bundle of declined offers were not available. The results, presented in Table IX, are striking.  \n\n# [Insert TABLE IX around here]  \n\nIn (9-1), a bivariate regression, high industry deal experience, is estimated with a positive coefficient, which is significant at the $1\\%$ level. When several start-up qualities are included in specification (9-2), the VC reputation result persists, disappearing in statistical significance only with the inclusion of VC characteristics (9-3), though the reputation measure is still estimated with a positive coefficient in that specification. As previously mentioned, problems of unobserved heterogeneity likely bias these estimates.  \n\n## IV. Conclusion and Discussion  \n\nI have tested and confirmed the proposition that entrepreneurs are willing to accept a discount on the valuation of their start-up in order to access the capital of venture capitalists with better reputations. These results help deepen our understanding of the market for affiliation by presenting empirical evidence that affiliation is an ordinary economic good for which actors seeking association will face a price-reputation trade off. This finding is consistent with the view that venture capitalists’ reputation (which in turn depends on their experience, information network, and direct assistance to the portfolio firms) may be more distinctive than their functionally equivalent financial capital. These conclusions are drawn from an analysis of multiple offers to a set of start-ups, which allows a high degree of statistical control. Because the characteristics of the start-up can be held constant, only differences in VC reputation across financing offers explain inter-offer variation in offer acceptance and price for start-up equity.  \n\nOne may wonder why prices charged by competing VCs to acquire the equity in a given start-up can be differentiated in equilibrium, given free entry. VCs with higher reputations may be able to sustain their higher prices (rather than having competition equilibrate prices) as a result of investments in reputation being costly (Shapiro (1983) and Megginson and Weiss (1991)). Consequently, while financial capital per se is not a differentiated good, the reputation of venture capitalists providing the financial capital can be a source of differentiation among VC organizations. The findings in this article are consistent with Kaplan and Schoar's (2003) recent evidence of substantial cross-sectional variation and persistence in VC fund performance.  \n\nSeveral alternate explanations to the empirical pattern have been considered throughout the empirical analysis. First, more savvy VC firms might have foreseen the coming public market downturn and offered lower prices as a result. However, entrepreneurs receiving multiple offers would not necessarily have to accept offers from such VC firms, and so this explanation does not seem consistent with the observed empirical pattern. A second alternative hypothesis is that the term sheet covenants across offers for a given start-up may have differed. Indeed, the price VCs offer for equity may not be the only factor that matters when entrepreneurs select a VC firm, and other dimensions of the term sheet may not be “priced in\" to the offered valuations. While surveyed entrepreneurs were asked for a copy of their term sheet offers, very few complied with this request. However, Suchman (1995) provides some evidence of convergence in VC financing agreements over time as a result of using the same law firms. As well, while Kaplan and Stromberg (2003) find that covenants in VC contracts differ by stage of start-up development, the offered terms of financing for a given start-up across VC firms may not be as variable. Nevertheless, different VCs probably prefer different terms, and offered terms are likely to vary even for a given start-up in a particular time period. As a result, comparing offers primarily on the basis of price is an inherent limitation of the present study.  \n\nSeveral additional issues associated with the data used for this study result in interpretational concerns. First, are the findings simply an artifact of the sample used? Although this group of companies might be of higher quality relative to average start-ups (assuming that the decision to be involved with MIT is a signal of quality), the sample, while modest at 148 offers, may represent a conservative test of the hypothesized effect. High quality entrepreneurs have their own reputations and established networks, which would tend to obviate the need to pay a premium to access capital from more experienced funding sources. In any case, employing start-up fixed effects makes this quality issue less important for the purposes of the empirical analysis. Indeed, the unique timing of the study in an environment in which many VCs were \"chasing after deals\" allowed identification of the market for affiliation—-though it does not necessarily address the applicability of these results to other time periods or other relationships. It is difficult, unfortunately, to speculate on that answer.  \n\nA second issue is whether the results are produced from the competitive effect associated with studying a sample of multiple offers. This proposition is also hard to evaluate, however, due to the difficulty of establishing a counterfactual to single-offer situations. On a related note, a deeper understanding of the process leading to multiple offers would be desirable. The manifold processes generating offers (some of which are unobserved, such as entrepreneurial charisma), as well as the disparate bargaining processes leading to offers, makes the fixed-effects methodology attractive in controlling for unobserved heterogeneity. Nevertheless, had I collected information about the sequencing of offers, I might have been able to gain some empirical insight into the process generating multiple offers. Sequencing data may have also helped in beginning to empirically disentangle the pure affiliation effect from the VC value-added effect.  \n\nTwo issues related to offers and how they might affect the interpretation of the results are also worth discussing. First, what if entrepreneurs “shopped\" their deal to other VCs without receiving a formal term sheet? Unfortunately, I do not have the history of how many pitches entrepreneurs made to different VC groups without receiving formal offers. The results may be biased if (a) informal offers were leveraged to negotiate more favorable formal offers, and (b) VCs with a less established reputation were more willing to revise their valuations upward relative to VCs with more established reputations. Unfortunately, data constraints prohibit this analysis; however, survey respondents were instructed to provide information on final formal term sheets only (including informal offers would have subjected the sample to entrepreneurial interpretation of what constituted an informal offer). A second issue is whether some of the high valuation offers were withdrawn by VCs as the negotiations became more serious. Again, systematic data are unfortunately unavailable to address this question. If withdrawals came from across the full distribution of VCs, this would not bias the results. If, on the other hand, withdrawals were systematically from less-reputable VCs, the study would be biased toward finding the results (and the opposite would be true if reputable VCs tended to withdraw offers). Given the market environment (\"\\*money chasing deals\") in which these data were collected in the second half of 2000 and my conversations with survey respondents, however, I believe that offer withdrawal was not a pervasive phenomenon in this sample. However, because I cannot rule out these two issues, they represent caveats to the study.  \n\nA final issue is interpreting what start-ups are buying. For example, industry deal experience in the start-up's sector can proxy for both the scope of the VC's information network as well as the VC's ability to evaluate deals. Unfortunately, the data in this study do not provide a clean way of disentangling these effects. As well, higher ability entrepreneurs may be taking a lower offer in an effort to signal quality (Spence (1974). While the empirical setting and the documented empirical patterns make this explanation unlikely, the proposition cannot be ruled Out.  \n\nLooking to the future, while this study does not test the ex-post performance implications of selecting a particular VC, it would be interesting to do so. For example, did start-ups accepting funding from more reputable VCs receive higher step-ups in valuation in subsequent rounds? Did they achieve an IPO faster or deliver products to the market more quickly?12 Nevertheless, the findings in this study are consistent with the theory that entrepreneurs who are tied into more connected networks at reputable VC firms expect to come across more opportunities for start-up growth, but must pay a premium for such access.  \n\n## APPENDIX: MIT Sloan Financing New High-Tech Ventures Survey  \n\nName of Firm: Location (city, state):  \n\n### Part I: Background Information  \n\n#### A.

Richard Scott and Soren Christensen, eds.: The Institutional Construction of Organizations (Sage Publications: Thousand Oaks, CA).  \n\n# Table I Description of the Overall Dataset  \n\nThis table describes the overall sample of Series A round financing offers to start-ups. Panel A describes the distribution of start-ups by year of incorporation. Panel B describes the overall sample, together with the distribution of offers and characteristics of the start-ups. For the sample of single and multiple offers, $80.5\\%$ of the 149 firms accepted their best (and sometimes only) financing offer. Of the 51 firms receiving multiple offers, $57\\%$ did not accept their best financial offer, leaving $\\$173.9\\mathrm$ “on the table,” the sum of the differences between the best financial offer and the accepted offer. For the group of firms receiving multiple offers and declining their best financial offer, this amount represents an average of $33.2\\%$ pre-money valuation discount as a fraction of their accepted offers. For the overall sample of single and multiple offers, this statistic is $12.5\\%$ . The measure internet industry includes services, infrastructure, retail, or other; computer industry includes software and hardware; health industry includes medical devices and biotechnology. The measure high industry deal experience is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the number of deals the VC has previously funded in the target start-up's industrial segment places the VC above the sample median. The measure high normalized funds raised is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the number of prior funds (excluding buyout funds) the VC has raised per years of operation places the VC above the sample median. The measure high network resources rating is a dummy equal to 1 if a VC firm received the maximum Likert-scale measure (of 5) in at least one of the following entrepreneur-rated VC network resources: Recruiting resources, contacts with customers and suppliers, or contacts with investment bankers. The measure corporate $V C$ is a dummy equal to 1 if the VC is a corporate VC. The measure angel investor is a dummy variable equal to 1 if a financing offer is from an angel investor or angel group. The measure financing offered is the amount of capital offered (in $\\$10$ by the investor. The measure equity taken threshold is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the investor receives at least $30\\%$ of start-up equity (the median of the sample) as a result of the Series A financing offer. Panels C and D report the conditional means of start-up and VC characteristics, respectively, for the single offer and multiple offer subsamples of the dataset. The $t\\cdot$ -tests of equal means between these sub-samples are also reported.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"13\"></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"13\"></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"13\">Panel A.

    "reference_markdown": "# Foreign VCs and Venture Success: Evidence from China\\*  \n\nMark Humphery-Jenner t, Jo-Ann Suchard  \n\nJournal of Corporate Finance, 2013, Vol. 21, No. 1, pp. 16-35 D0I: 10.1016/jcorpfin.2013.01.003  \n\n# Abstract  \n\nThis paper analyzes the role of foreign VCs in driving venture success in emerging markets. We analyze a comprehensive data-set of 4753 portfolio companies from China. We test whether the presence of a foreign VC increases the likelihood that a portfolio company is successfully exited. We find that the presence of a foreign VC does not per se significantly increase the likelihood of a successful exit. However, the likelihood of a successful exit increases if the foreign VC collaborates with a joint venture OV) partner. Further, the impact of foreign VC backing depends on the nature of the VC, with foreign VCs tending to perform better when investing in late-stage companies and when they are diversified across industries. If a foreign VC successfully exits an investment, then, compared with a domestic-VC, it prefers to exit via a M&A or secondary-buyout than via an IPO, reflecting the significant lock-up periods associated with VC-backed IPOs in China, the difficulty of achieving a foreign listing, and the difficulty listing a start-up on Chinese markets.  \n\nKeywords: Venture Capital; Private Equity; China; Cross-border investment; Internationalization; IPOs JEL Classification: G24; G34  \n\n# 1 Introduction  \n\nThis paper examines whether foreign venture capitalists (VCs) increase the likelihood of venture succes. VC has traditionally been geographically locally concentrated (Sorensen and Stuart, 2001; Chen et al, 2010; Cumming and Dai, 2010b). However, VC and private equity (PE) investment has become increasingly internationalized (Dai et al., 2011; Wang and Wang, 2011, 2012a). China is one emerging market that has seen significant interest from foreign VCs. VC investment in China has increased from USD 1.2 billion (in 1999) to USD 31.4 billion (in 2010). While foreign VCs might bring some advantages, such as connections and size, they are geographically distant and might face difficulties monitoring portfolio companies, especially in emergingmarkets.  \n\nA limited number of studies have examined foreign VCs in emerging markets, although many suffer from relatively small samples and often use a multi-country sample to ameliorate sample-size issues. Small sample sizes might raise concerns about sample-selection bias, and the typical solution, the use of a cross-country sample that span several legal regimes, raises concerns about heterogeneity. 1 Wang and Wang (2011) and Dai et al (2011) examine investments in 243 and 418 portfolio companies in China respectively. These samples are relatively small compared with the sample of 4753 VC-backed companies that we examine. Wang and Wang (2012a) aim to address these sample size constraints by examining a sample of 6025 VC investments; however, these are spread across 35 countries. These small samples raise concerns that the sample is not representative of all VC investments, especially given the documented misreporting of returns by some alternative asset funds (Cumming and Dai, 2010a). The use of international samples to over-come small sample sizes does not eliminate the potential for selection bias within the constituent countries and raises concerns about the impact of country-level heterogeneity. This suggests that a useful alternative approach is to hold constant the country-of-investment and to focus on a comprehensive set of companies within that country.  \n\nWe overcome the small-sample problem by examining a new sample of 4753 portfolio companies in China that receive VC investments between 1988 and 2011. We use this sample to investigate whether foreign VCs can improve the likelihood of venture success, the impact of syndication on venture success and the exitpreferences of foreign VCs. The large sample and long time-period provides some confidence that the results are not artifacts of a small sample bias. The long time-period also enables us to examine trends over time; and thus, to assess the impact of regulatory changes.  \n\nWe make several key findings. First, we find that foreign VCs do not per se increase the likelihood of venture success. Second, the impact of foreign VCs on venture success depends on the characteristics of the VC fund and the nature of the portfolio company, with foreign VCs being more successful when investing in late-stage companies. This result is consistent with the idea that foreign ${\\mathrm{VCs}}^{\\prime}$ main contributions come from providing capital and expertise to relatively large companies than from nurturing start-ups. Third, domestic VCs do increase the likelihood of venture success (as compared with other types of VC). Fourth, there is some evidence that a foreign VC benefits from collaborating with a joint venture UV) fund, whom the foreign VC might be able to use to build local knowledge and networks (consistent with Javorcik and Wei, 2009). Fifth, we find that foreign VCs tend to prefer to exit investments via M&As and secondary buyouts than via IPOs (when compared with domestic VCs). This result might reflect the disproportionate concerns that a foreign financial institution might have about the governance and quality of Chinese financial markets. Further, restrictions on foreign ownership of listed companies might pose issues in the context of the significant lockup periods after a VC lists a venture-backed company. It could also reflect the discretionary 'merits review' process by which listings can occur, which would bias against a foreign institution who might lack local connections with regulators.  \n\nThese results enable us to make a significant contribution to both the VC and PE and law and finance literature. We highlight the use of a comparatively under-used comprehensive database of Chinese VC investments. We use this database to draw insights about the role of foreign VCs in venture success. These findings complement and enhance the findings in studies that are otherwise limited by small sample-sizes. By showing the usefulness of a JV-partner to a foreign VC, we also support the general findings in Hochberg et al (2007) and in Ewens and Rhodes-Kropf (2012), who argue that a VC syndicate might be 'greater than the sum of its parts' (Ewens and Rhodes-Kropf, 2012). We also contribute to the law-and-finance literature by showing that VC-backed IPO-activity changes over time, reflecting changes in the Chinese legal environment.  \n\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 provides a background of the VC market in China. Section 3 presents the hypotheses. Section 4 contains the data and sample description. Section 5 presents the results, andSection 6 concludes.  \n\n# 2  Institutional background  \n\nThis section details the Chinese institutional background. For brevity, we discuss only factors related to the VC market, and discuss factors related to exiting investments when relevant to the hypotheses.  \n\nThe Chinese VC environment has experienced significant growth. The impetus for a VC market was in the 1980s, when the government aimed to stimulate high-tech investment (Xiao, 2002). However, a lack of market-supporting institutions hampered VC growth during the 1980s and early 1990s. A small amount of expansion occurred when the Chinese government established \"China Direct Investment Funds\" (CDIFs) (Pukthuanthong and Walker, 2007). The CDIFs were investment vehicles that were listed in Hong Kong. London, and Dublin. They focused on government-owned or state-level enterprises and did not invest in private businesses (Bruton et al., 1999; Bruton and Ahlstrom, 2003). This arguably induced poor performance within early VC investments.  \n\nChina's VC market expanded in 1999 and 2000. Several factors contributed to the expansion, including strong global equity markets, and the proposal in 2000 by the Shenzhen Stock Exchange to launch a NASDAQ-like venture board in support of start-up and high-tech companies. Much of the accelerating investment focused on high-tech investments tied to the internet bubble (Lu et al., 2011).  \n\nBetween 2000 and 2005, the Chinese VC market slowed in general, although in 2003 there was an expansion of foreign-backed VC investments. In 2002, the Chinese government shelved the venture board plan. This hampered investment as it made it increasingly difficult to exit start-up companies. However, in 2003, the Chinese government waived the approval for domestic private enterprises to be listed overseas. This gave foreign VCs a comparative advantage over domestic VCs as they had more familiarity and connections with their home capital markets.  \n\nSince 2004, the environment has become more VC-friendly. In 2004, China established the Small and Medium Enterprise Board (SME Board), which provided an additional venue for VCs to exit investments. However, overseas listings became more difficult as the government tightened regulations on overseas listings of Chinese companies. In 2006, the government passed regulations stating that a company could list overseas only if the Chinese Securities and Regulatory Commission (CSRC) approved the listing. The CSRCA has adopted a restrictive approach to allowing foreign listings. In 2007 the government relaxed restrictions on VC investments by investment banks and securities firms, facilitating an expansion of IB-affiliated VC funds. In 2009, the government introduced a venture board. This has facilitated the listing of relatively small companies in China. However, VCs must still be cognizant of barriers to listings, which we discuss below.  \n\nThe required lock-up period has also changed during the sample-period. Prior to 2008, a three-year lock-up period applied to VC/PE backed IPOs; however, in 2008, China reduced the lock-up period to one-year (Poddar, 2008; Tao, 2008). This change could influence the attractiveness of China's VC sector to foreign investors, and increasing the desirability of an IPO-exit.  \n\nA consistent trait throughout the whole period has been the importance of local connections. Lu et al (2011) argue that the evolvement of the VC industry in China was not driven by the opportunity of financing hightech entrepreneurial firms but by the creation and removal of institutional rents. Further, much investment in Chins is reported to be facilitated by connections with other domestic investors or parties (Bian, 1994; Farh et al., 1998; Tan, 2006; Chua et al., 2009). The importance of such connections could foreseeably influence the approach process for an IP0 (Huang, 2011). Subsequently, through the whole period, foreign VCs have faced significant implicit barriers to entering the Chinese market, particularly if they lack a domestic Chinese partner.  \n\nThe foregoing discussion indicates that the institutional background in China has changed during our sample period. The changes are relatively frequent and are likely to influence the success of Vc-backed companies and the mode-of-exit. We discuss the specific ways in which the changes might influence exit-activity below. In our empirical tests, we control for time-changing institutional-characteristics by including year fixed effects in all models.  \n\n# 3 Hypotheses  \n\nThe goal of this paper is to examine the impact of foreign funds on venture success. We then analyze how exit preferences might change over time, reflecting changes in the Chinese market.  \n\n## 3.1 Foreign funds and exit-likelihood  \n\nWe first examine the impact of foreign VC firms on exit likelihood. We develop hypotheses about the success of foreign VCs in general, the potential impact of having a domestic partner in a foreign-VC-backed deal, and the role of investment and fund-level characteristics in deal success.  \n\n### 3.1.1 Foreign VCs in general  \n\nWe expect that foreign VCs reduce the likelihood of a successful exit, or at best do not reduce the likelihood of a successful exit. This is for at least two reasons.  \n\nThe first reason relates to the foreign VC's ability to contribute to the management of the company. Distance between corporate controllers and the corporation can hamper their ability to gather information, convey information, and manage an enterprise (Masulis et al., 2012). Thus, there is evidence that the proximity between the VC fund and its portfolio company can influence venture financing (Lutz et al., 2013). Further, there is complementary evidence that the quality of securities regulation/disclosure is positively associated with VC supply and performance around the world (Cumming and Knill, 2012). Subsequently, impact of distance should be especially felt in China, where social connections are important to business success and information-gathering (Bian, 1994; Farh et al., 1998; Tan, 2006; Chua et al., 2009). Therefore, foreign VCs are less likely to have the information and social-connections that would otherwise enable them to successfully exit an investment.  \n\nThe second reason relates to the general process of exiting an investment in China, especially in the domestic market. The exit process often requires some form of state approval; for example, issuing an IPO requires that the issuer satisfy the requirements that the CSRC imposes.2 In practice, this leads to a merits review of the IPO (Huang, 2011). This can (beneficially) lead to the selection of well-governed companies for an IPO (see e.g. Humphery-Jenner, 2012b). However, navigating this process can sometimes rely on the issuer's (or their intermediary's) connections with the regulator (Huang, 2011). A foreign VC is less likely to have these connections and thus it is less likely to be able to rapidly instigate an exit.  \n\nHypothesis 1: Foreign VC backing does not per se increase the likelihood of a successful exit  \n\n### 3.1.2 Collaborating with JVs and domestic partners:  \n\nWe expect that the presence of a domestic partner (or a fund that is a JV between foreign and domestic firms) will significantly increase the likelihood of venture success in deals backed by foreign VCs. Syndication can improve venture-outcomes (Ferrary, 2010; Das et al., 2011; Meuleman and Wright, 2011; Tian, 2012). Syndication should be even more important for foreign VCs in emerging markets, such as China. The main rationale is that investment in China reportedly relies on connections and networking (Bian, 1994; Farh et al., 1998; Tan, 2006; Chua et al., 2009). A foreign VC is likely to have relatively few domestic connections when compared with a domestic VC. Subsequently, we expect that a foreign VC will benefit from collaborating with a domestic VC by increasing its access to networks. Further, China is a relatively highly regulated market that conveys a degree of political risk. Such political risk and regulation might ordinarily deter VC investment and hamper venture outcomes (Cumming and Zambelli, 2010, 2013). However, there is some evidence (in the project finance literature) that appropriate syndication can help to ameliorate the impact of political risks (Hainz and Kleimeier, 2012). Thus, we expect that for funds backed by foreign VCs, collaborations with other domestic VCs and/or with JVs will increase the likelihood of success.  \n\nHypothesis 2: For investments backed by a foreign VC, a collaboration with a domestic VC or a JV will increase the likelihood of venture success.  \n\n### 3.1.3 Fund-level and investment-level characteristics  \n\nThe success of foreign VCs is likely to depend on the characteristics of both the fund and the company that they back. We make several predictions.  \n\nInvestment stage: We expect that foreign VCs will be more successful with late-stage investments than with start-up investments. We expect that foreign VCs are likely to be larger, to have better international networks, and to have more capital. The traits are especially important when investing in relatively large late-stage companies, which have progressed past the start-up stage and need additional capital and guidance to continue their growth. By contrast, a start-up-type company needs significant input and nurturing from a VC in order to grow. Such input might be difficult for a foreign VC due to information asymmetries arising from geographic distance. Subsequently, we expect that foreign VCs are more likely to be more successful when investing in late-stage companies.  \n\nHypothesis 3a: Foreign VCs are more likely to contribute to venture success in late-stage companies than in start-up companies.  \n\nDiversification: Foreign VCs should be more able to contribute to venture success if they have gained skills from investing across a range of industries (and possibly) regions in China. There is some prior evidence that VC/PE companies can gain skills from investing across industries and/or regions, which they can then use to improve outcomes in their portfolio companies (Humphery-Jenner, Forthcoming). Further, because the main contributions of foreign VCs include their connections, we also expect that foreign VCs will be more successful when they have established more connections by investing across multiple industries and companies. Subsequently, there should be a strong benefit from having invested across multiple industries. There might be similar benefits to investing across multiple regions in China. However, these benefits would be weaker and less-obvious because of the significant issues of information asymmetry and monitoring in emerging markets. Indeed, the resource-constraints imposed by having to monitor companies across multiple regions might create a limited attention' problem whereby the VC/PE fund is unable to devote sufficient attention to each individual portfolio company.  \n\nHypothesis 3b: Foreign funds who invest across a larger number of industries will be more likely to be successful.  \n\nFund size: The size of the foreign fund might influence the likelihood of venture success. Arguably, larger funds might perform better when investing in emerging markets due to their larger resources and (potentially) greater international connections. Prior literature documents significant diseconomies of scale in the VC/PE industry (Cumming and Dai, 2011; Humphery-Jenner, 2012a). Part of the explanation for the diseconomies of scale is the inability of large funds to monitor all of their investments (called the “limited attention' problem). This limited attention problem might be more severe for investments in emerging markets, such as China, where monitoring is especially important, Thus, we would expect that larger foreign funds might perform slightly less well.  \n\nHypothesis 3c: larger foreign funds might be less likely to increase venture success, owing to diseconomies of scale in VC/PE.  \n\nExperience: We expect that funds who are more experienced will be more likely to exit their investments. One argued benefit of foreign VC/PE funds is that they bring experience and connections. Major international funds often use the argued benefits of connections/experience as a sales-point.3 Subsequently, we expect that funds who have undertaken more investments, and have exited more investments, will be more likely to exit the present investment.  \n\nHypothesis 3d: Funds who have undertaken more investments and/or have exited more investments are more likely to exit the present investment.  \n\nSyndication: Syndication could influence the likelihood of venture success. It is possible that syndication can improve venture success by giving access to more connections (Hochberg et al., 2007, as per 2010). However, syndication might not automatically lead to improved outcomes, due potentially to free-rider problems that can arise in syndicates and/or potential conflicts between syndicate-members (Zhang and Zhang, 2009; Zhou and Zhang, 2009; Chahine et al., 2012). The issues monitoring syndicates are most likely to increase with the possibilities of information asymmetries between syndicate-partners. Given that foreign VC/PE funds likely face greater information asymmetries, we would expect that the benefits from syndication would be lower for foreign VC/PEs than for domestic ones.  \n\nHypothesis 3e: Foreign VC/PE funds gain less from syndication than do domestic funds. That is, the benefits of having more investors in a company are lower for foreign VC/PE funds.  \n\n## 3.2 Overseas funds and exit types  \n\nWe predict that foreign VCs will be less likely to exit an investment via IPO than will domestic VCs. This is for several reasons. First, Cumming et al (2006) indicate that IPOs are less likely in a country that has weaker regulation and governance. Cumming and Johan (2008) and Cumming et al (2011) indicate that trading rules are comparatively weak in China.4 This implies that VCs would prefer to exit via a M&A/trade sale rather than through an IPO. Foreign VCs are likely to have an even stronger preference for M&A/trade sales as they more accustomed to stronger trading rules; and thus, are be more concerned about the comparative dearth of securities regulation.  \n\nSecond, Schwienbacher (2008) indicates that entrepreneurs in start-ups attempt to manipulate innovation strategies in order to obtain an IPO (over a trade sale); and thus, to increase the likelihood of remaining independent. We hypothesize that foreign VCs prefer to invest in late stage investments. Thus, they are less exposed to manipulation of the firm's innovation strategy, which suggests that they would be more likely to exit via aM&A.  \n\nThird, the listing requirements in China's equities markets have traditionally excluded many small firms as they are often unable to meet the requirements. A company can list on a domestic (Chinese) stock market only if the company satisfies the following requirements:  \n\n1. Market capitalization: The market must have capitalization of at least RMB $30\\mathrm{m}$ (Securities Law, Article 50(2)).   \n2. Percentage of shares listed: If the market capitalization is less than RMB 0.4b, then at least $25\\%$ of the shares must be listed. If the market capitalization is more than RMB 0.5b, then at least $10\\%$ of the shares must be listed (Securities Law Article 50(3)).   \n3. Financial Ability: The company must be able to “[make] profits continuously\" and have “\"a sound financial status\" (Securities Law Article 13(2)). It must also have a “complete and well-operated organization\" (Securities Law Article 13(1)).   \n4. Accounting quality: The company must have no 'major irregularity' in the last 3 years and have no 'false record' in its financial statements (Securities Law Articles, 13(3), 50(4).   \n5. Stock exchange requirements: The company must meet any additional requirements as that the stock exchange imposes (Securities Law Article 50). CSRC requirements: The CSRC retains residual discretion to approve an issue (Securities Law Articles   \n12, 13[4),48, 50[1);  \n\nA limited history might prevent small companies from showing that they can ‘make profits continuously' (under Article 13(2)). Further, small VC-backed companies might not meet the RMB $30\\mathrm{m}$ capitalization requirement (under Article 50(2)). Another issue is that the CSRC and the Stock Exchanges have a residual discretion to impose additional listing requirements. The CSRC has the widest discretion and has scope to exercise this arbitrarily. Some commentators assert that this discretion lacks transparency and can cause significant delays in listing securities (see Zhang et al., 2007). While the minimum capitalization requirements affect both domestic and foreign VCs, the discretionary aspects of the listing decision may impact the exit preferences of foreign VCs, who lack political connection (compared with domestic VCs). In addition, the opening of the SME Board in 2004 provided an exit mechanism to domestic but not foreign VCs.  \n\nFourth, China's VC and IPO laws have changed over time, and this particularly affects foreign VCs. Cheung et al (2009a) argue that there have been significant changes in the regulation of China's IPO market. These have mostly improved access to the IPO market by (inter alia) relaxing constraints such as listing requirements. However, other factors have cooled the IPO market. For example, the suspension in 2002 of the planned venture board that was announced in 2000. Given that VCs often target a particular type of exit when they make an investment, this legal uncertainty could deter VCs from targeting an IPO; and thus, could reduce the likelihood that a foreign VC targets an IPO listing. Overall, this induces the following hypothesis:  \n\nHypothesis 4: Compared with domestic VCs, foreign VCs prefer to exit investments via M&As and trade sales than through IPOs.  \n\n## 3.3  Exit preferences over time  \n\nWe hypothesize that exit preferences will change over time, and there is an increase in the proportion of IPOs (especially in mainland China) over time. This should apply both to foreign-backed and to domestic-backed companies. We expect that the proportion of IPOs will increase for several reasons.  \n\nFirst, the quality of China's financial markets has changed over time. China's regulation has improved through increasingly strong restrictions on market manipulation and accounting misstatements.5 This might make China's financial markets more attractive; and thus, increase the likelihood of an IPO exit. To the extent that a foreign VC/PE fund might improve the portfolio company's governance, the improved standards of the Chinese IPO-market would attract foreign VC/PEs to list companies there.  \n\nSecond, there have been some financial market regulation biases in favor of a Chinese listing as opposed to a foreign listing. Between 2003 and 2005, a foreign listing was comparatively easy because China waived the need for government approval for a foreign listing. However, in 2005, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) issued Circular 11 and Circular 29, which tightened regulations on overseas listings, and in 2006 China reinstated the need for government approval for overseas listings. This approval process could particularly hinder listings by foreign-backed firms as the foreign backers might lack political/institutional connections.  \n\nThird, the introduction of the SME and venture board has created listed exit opportunities for VC backed firms. Therefore, we predict that the proportion of listings that occur in China increases over time, and this holds for companies either with or without foreign backing.  \n\nFourth, China has gradually relaxed restrictions on the process for pricing IPOs in mainland China. Significant restrictions on IPO pricing effectively required significant levels of underpricing (Mok and Hui, 1998; Chan et al, 2004; Chen et al, 2004). The relaxation of these restrictions has allowed a reduction in underpricing (Cheung et al., 2009b). This reduction in underpricing (and associated increase in listing prices) makes mainland IPOs more attractive. This would apply both to domestic VC/PEs and foreign VC/PEs. However, to the extent that foreign VC/PEs might be more accustomed to listing practices in other markets, the relaxation in underpricing restrictions might especially attract them.  \n\nFifth, China has gradually relaxed the lock-up period involved in VC-backed companies. In 2008, China reduced the lock-up period (for VC-backed IPOs) from three years to one year. A three-year lock-up imposes more risk on foreign VCs than on domestic VCs because foreign VCs are more exposed to international financial factors. Subsequently, the reduction in the lock-up period is likely to increase the attractiveness of an IPO exit over time. This would especially apply to foreign VC/PEs (especially those in the US) where VC/PE funds often try to circumvent lock-up periods by repatriating their shares to the LPs.6  \n\nDespite the improvements in China's financial-markets, there might still be some deterrents to foreign Vc/PE funds listing companies in China. China's financial-markets still lag many developed markets in terms of market-efficiency and regulation (Cumming et al, 2011, Table2; Allen et al., 2012). Firms with government connections and state-owned-enterprises also arguably enjoy commercial advantages (Chen et al., 2011). Subsequently, there is evidence that politically connected firms enjoy better post-IPO returns in China (Liu et al., 2012). This could deter foreign VC/PEs from listing companies on a Chinese stock market as opposed to listing companies overseas or selling them to an incumbent. Further, it is still more difficult to list stocks on the Chinese financial markets than it is to list companies elsewhere. Thus, the improvements might still not be sufficient to encourage foreign VC/PEs to increase the amount of IPOs they pursue.  \n\nHypothesis 5: The proportion of exits that occurs via IPO increases over time, both for companies with and without a foreign VC/PE backer.  \n\n# 4 Data and sample description  \n\nThe aim of this study is to examine whether foreign VCs influence the likelihood of a successful exit. We obtain data from ChinaVenture on portfolio companies and VC/PE funds. The sample contains 4753 portfolio companies that receive capital between 1988 and 2011 and that have the necessary data. The portfolio companies are from mainland China and Hong Kong. There are only 116 observations from Hong Kong and in robustness tests, we ensure that the portfolio companies in this region do not drive the results. The unit-ofanalysis is at the portfolio company level with each portfolio company representing one observation. In the data, each observation is a portfolio company. We compute variables that are related to foreign backing and exits, and obtain other fund-level and company-level variables. Table 1 summarizes the variables.  \n\nForeign backing variables: The data allows us to define a fund as ‘foreign', a joint venture (JV'), or 'domestic'. We define a foreign fund as one that obtains all its funding from overseas sources; a JV as one that obtains both foreign and domestic funding; and, a domestic fund as one that obtains all its fund from domestic sources. We use this data to compute several sets of variables:  \n\nI(Only foreign funds), I(Only JVs), and I(Only domestic funds) are indicators that equal one if the company only receives backing from overseas funds, JVs, or domestic funds, respectively.  \n\nProp(Foreign funds), Prop(IVs), and Prop(Domestic funds) represent the proportion of funds invested in the company who are foreign, JVs, or domestic, respectively. I(At least one foreign fund), I(At least one JV) and I(At least one domestic fund) equal one if there is at least one foreign fund, JV, or domestic fund invested in the company, respectively.  \n\nExit variables: We collect data on whether the company exited via M&A, secondary buyout, or IPO, or is not yet exited. We do not claim that the 'not yet exited' companies are failed.We take this approach because VCs have an incentive to conceal (and thus not report) failed investment (Cumming and Dai, 2010a), which makes it difficult to disentangle the reason for which a company is not yet exited. Nonetheless, we do estimate hazard models to examine the probability that a company does experience a successful exit. Further, we have data on the location of any buyer (of the portfolio company) or the location of the IPo (of the portfolio company) for those companies that do achieve a successful exit.  \n\nWe acknowledge that not all M&As or secondary-sales represent 'successes'. In some cases a VC/PE manager might be nearing the end of its life-cycle and may need to liquidity its remaining assets. In this case, it is possible that the VC/PE fund might need to engage in a fire sale, resulting lower price than would be desirable (Cumming and MacIntosh, 2003a, 2003b).  \n\nOther independent variables: We also control for other firm-level, investment-level, and fund-level characteristics that might influence exit-outcomes.7  \n\nInvestment stage: We control for whether the company is a startup company ('I(Startup)') or is latestage ('I(Late stage)'). We also examine the interaction between these variables and our VC-fund location variables, described above. We include these variables because prior evidence suggests that startup investments, in particular, are risky and have a high failure risk (Cochrane, 2005). Further, given that startups face significant difficulties listing on Chinese financial markets, we expect that investment-stage might influence investment-outcomes. These variables are static throughout the life of the investment. Fund size: The literature suggests that large funds tend to under-perform small funds (Cumming and Dai, 2011; Humphery-Jenner, 2012a). Subsequently, we control for the log of the size of the largest VC-fund that backs the company (ln(Max Fund Size)). · The VC backer's average investment size: The average investment size of the company's backers might influence the likelihood of success. The literature shows that investments in relatively large companies are less likely to fail, reflecting the likelihood that such companies are likely to be older and more stable (Humphery-Jenner, 2012a). Further, funds with a larger average investment size are likely to invest in fewer investments so are less likely to suffer from the limited attention' problem arising from undertaking too many simultaneous investments (see Cumming, 2o06; Cumming and Dai, 2011). Subsequently, we control for the log of the largest average investment of the VC backers has made (ln(Max Invest Size)'). That is, for each VC-backer we obtain the average investment size. We then use the largest average investment size.  \n\n· The fund's success: We expect that there will be performance persistence in VC-investments, whereby funds with a strong track-record are likely to continue that record (Kaplan and Schoar, 2005; Gompers et al., 2010; Phalippou, 2010; Krishnan et al., 2011; Cumming et al., 2012).8 Given that we expect that the most experienced fund will contribute its expertise and experience from prior investments, we control for the maximum number of successful exits undertaken by one of the VC backers in the Chinese market (as indicated by ChinaVenture). Number of investments: Increasing the number of investments within a venture portfolio might enable the VC backer to take more risks by virtue of being more diversified; and thus, might improve venture outcomes (Humphery-Jenner, Forthcoming). Alternatively, excessively high numbers of simultaneous investments can reduce the attention that a fund can pay to each individual investment and can reduce returns (Cumming and Dai, 2011). Subsequently, we capture this by controlling for the maximum number of investments made by one of the company's VC backers (Max Num Investments') in the Chinese market (as indicated in ChinaVenture). Regional diversification: Diversification across regions can improve venture outcomes, as it might enable the VC-backer to gain additional skills and networks (Humphery-Jenner, Forthcoming). However, it could also harm performance if it forces the VC fund to divert its attention across too many regions and reduce the attention it can give to any particular region. Subsequently, we control for the greatest number of Chinese provinces invested in by one of the VC backers (Max Num Regions') as reported in ChinaVenture. Industry diversification: Diversification across industries tends to create value in VC and PE investment, as it enables the VC backer to both diversify risk and gain additional knowledge that it might impart into the present investment (Humphery-Jenner, Forthcoming; Knill, 2009). Subsequently, we control for the maximum number of industries across which any VC backer of the firm has invested ('Max Num Industries'). This variable is for the Chinese market and is as is reported inChinaVenture Number of investment rounds: Firms that receive more rounds of capital are less likely to achieve a successful exit. This reflects the fact that the need to continually inject more money into the company likely reflects the company's inability to achieve success. Subsequently, we control for the number of investment rounds the company has had ('Num Rounds').  \n\nNumber of investors: VCs often form investment-syndicates, being motivated by factors such as riskaversion, investment-risk, and capital-pooling (Wang and Wang, 2012b). We have mixed predictions about the impact of the number of investors on venture success. Increasing the number of backers might help to increase venture success by enabling the backers to utilize their different networks and leverage each-others experience (Hochberg et al., 2007, 2010; Ewens and Rhodes-Kropf, 2012). However, not all syndicates are beneficial, and the success relies largely on the skill of the members of the syndicate (Gompers et al., 2012). Subsequently, there is some evidence that diversity in the VC syndicate can lead to higher earnings management and lower post-IPO performance (Chahine et al., 2012), possibly arising because syndication can induce a free-rider problem whereby syndicate members reduce their monitoring and contribution on the assumption that the other syndicate members willfill the gap.  \n\n# 5 Analysis  \n\nWe first undertake a general analysis of the companies in which foreign VCs invest. This provides a background to our analysis of exit-trends. We then analyze the impact of foreign ${\\mathrm{VC}}s^{\\prime}$ on exit success.Finally, we examine foreign VCs' exit preferences and their role in the internationalization of their portfolio companies.  \n\n## 5.1 General investments by Foreign VCs  \n\nWe analyze the investment decisions of foreign VCs (and IVs) at the portfolio company level. Here, we examine a cross-sectional data set where the unit-of-analysis is at the portfolio company level (with one observation for each portfolio company). The univariate statistics are in Table 2. The main results are that foreign VCs prefer to invest in larger companies, and companies that have many other investors suggesting a role for syndication. Interestingly, foreign VCs are more likely to invest in both late-stage companies and start-ups. It is unsurprising that they are more likely to invest in late-stage companies, as these companies are most likely to benefit from the fund's expertise and financial backing. However, they also are more likely to invest in start-ups than are other types of funds, possibly reflecting an attempt to invest in high-tech internet start-ups in China (following Lu et al., 2011). There are significant differences in the investments that attract foreign backing compared to those that do not attract foreign backing, suggesting that a multivariate framework is necessary to analyze the data.  \n\n# [Insert Table 2 about here]  \n\nThe company level regressions are in Table 3. The models are logit models that predict investment by foreign VCs, domestic VCs, or JVs and tobit models that analyze the proportion of investment that is provided by foreign investors/JVs. We only include explanatory variables that would be exogenous to the decision by a foreign VC to invest in the company. The main results are as follows: First, foreign investment is more likely if the company is late-stage (but is significantly less likely if it is a start-up), as seen in Columns 1, 4, and 7. Second, there are some strong industry-effects: foreign VCs tend to avoid companies in the resources industry, and medical/biotech industry. The resources-result likely reflects foreigners' limited access to strategically/nationally important industries. The biotech result might reflect the significant issues of monitoring and information asymmetry in that industry. Third, foreign VCs are significantly more likely to invest in companies that are based in a major city (i.e. Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong) as opposed to one in a regional area. This is consistent with the idea that it would be easier for a foreign VC to monitor a company that is based in a major city, where the foreign VC is more likely to have a branch office and is more likely to be able to meet with the portfolio company.  \n\n# [Insert Table 3 about here]  \n\nOverall, these results suggest that: (1) foreign VCs prefer to invest in late stage investments, consistent with an aversion to information asymmetry and a desire to invest in comparatively established projects. (2) When coupled with the result that foreign VCs prefer to invest in companies that have other investors, this implies that foreign VCs utilize their size and connections to create value in larger companies, and prefer not to have to rely on mentoring start-ups. This is consistent with larger funds (which are more likely to be international VCs in China)having a comparative advantage in syndication and financing, which mostly benefits larger latestage companies.  \n\n## 5.2  Foreign VCs and exit likelihood  \n\nWe first analyze whether foreign VCs increase the likelihood of an exit. In subsequent sections, we examine type of exit. The predictions are: (a) foreign VCs do not per se improve the likelihood of an exit, (b) for  \n\nforeign-VC-backed companies, investing with another domestic VC or a JV will increase the likelihood of a successful exit, and (c) the success of a foreign VC will depend on the nature of the company, the fund, and the investment.  \n\n### 5.2.1 Univariate analysis  \n\nThe univariate results are in Table 4. Table 4 summarizes the nature of exits by whether there is a foreign VC backer. This analysis is at the portfolio-company level. IPO-exits are more likely than M&A-exits whether or not the portfolio company has a foreign backer. However, if there is a foreign backer, then an M&A exit is more likely than if there is no foreign backer(see column 4) whereas if there is a domestic backer, then a M&A exit is less likely than if there is no domestic backer (See Column 10). This would suggest that foreign backers have a disproportionate tendency towards M&A-exits. Indeed $26.7\\%$ $(=0.164/0.240)$ of all successfully exited companies with a foreign backer are exited via M&A compared with $15.2\\%(=0.029/0.191)$ of companies with a domestic backer. While the presence of each type of backer increases the likelihood of an IPO-exit (implying that having a mix of backers in a syndicate helps to facilitate an IPO), the proportion of successfully exited companies that are exited via an IPo is higher for domestic-backed companies $\\Delta2\\%~=~0.156/0.1$ 91) compared with foreign-backed companies $68.3\\%{=}0.164/0.240)$ . Overall, these results suggest that foreign backed companies are more likely to be exited via a M&A than are domestic backed companies. Table 5 presents sample statistics for the sub-sample of exited deals. The figures are sample means. The results suggest some differences in the characteristics of investors and investments between exit types.  \n\n[Insert Table 4 about here] [Insert Table 5 about here]  \n\n### 5.2.2 Multivariate analysis of the likelihood of an exit  \n\nWe assess the foreign VCs' contributions to exit-success by using a Cox hazard model in Table 6. We implement the Cox hazard model at the company-level (i.e. there is one observation per company) and assess whether/when a company is exited. The time variable is the time (in years) between the first investment year and either (a) the exit year if the investment is exited, or (b) 2011 if the investment is not exited. The ‘ending' variable is an indicator that equals one if the investment is successful exited. Thus, a positive coefficient in the hazard model suggests that the variable increases the likelihood of a successful exit.9  \n\nThe main finding is that the coefficients on I(Only foreign), Prop(Only foreign) I(At least one foreign) are negative and significant, implying that the presence of an overseas fund reduces the likelihood of a successful exit. By contrast, the variables I(Only domestic), Prop(Domestic), and I(At least one domestic) are positive and significant, suggesting that the presence of a domestic VC significantly increases the likelihood of an exit. These results are consistent with the prediction that informational asymmetries make it more difficult for an overseas fund to develop the portfolio company enough for it to be exit-able.  \n\nThe control variables yield some interesting findings. Unsurprisingly, startups are less likely to be exited successfully, consistent with the idea that startups have a high chance of failure. A larger number of successful prior exits increases the likelihood of a successful exit (a positive and significant coefficient on 'Max Fund Exits). The likelihood of a successful exit decreases with the number of investments that the companies backers' have made. This is consistent with the idea that investing in more companies might reduce the attention that a fund can pay to an individual investment and might worsen deal-outcomes (see e.g. Cumming and Dai, 2011). The results on industry/regional diversification are opposite. While industrybased diversification reduces the likelihood of a successful exit, geographic-diversification improves it. The results vis-a-vis geographic-diversification are consistent with prior literature, which suggests that diversification can improve funds' returns (Humphery-Jenner, Forthcoming). The results vis- $\\grave{\\mathrm{a}}$ vis industrybased diversification differ from the finding that in developed countries industry-based diversification can improve fund performance (Humphery-Jenner, Forthcoming; see e.g. Knill, 2009). A possible explanation is the presence of performance clustering in Chinese industries; that is, only a sub-set of industries are competitive, so diversifying out of those industries might be disadvantageous.10 The total number of investors who invest in the company is positively related to exit-success, consistent with the idea that syndication can be beneficial.  \n\n### 5.2.3 Exit likelihood and collaborations between foreign funds, domestic funds, and JVs  \n\nThe results indicate that a foreign-backed company partnering with a JV, increases the likelihood of a successful exit. Table 7 contains Cox hazard models for various sub-samples of foreign-backed, domesticbacked, and JV-backed companies. The goal is to examine whether collaborating with a JV or a domestic fund improves venture success for foreign-backed companies. The main finding (in Column 3) is that if the portfolio company has a foreign backer, then collaborations with JVs increase the likelihood of success. A possible explanation is that the cultural difference between foreign investors and JVs is less than between foreign and domestic investors, thereby leading to a more successful syndication.11 By contrast, collaborations with domestic funds do not significantly increase the likelihood of a successful exit (see Column 4). This result suggests that IVs (which obtain capital from both domestic and foreign sources) are able to bridge the gap between foreign funds and the local environment, and can do that better than domestic funds (which only obtain capital from domestic sources). Interestingly, if the company is backed by a JV, then a collaboration with a domestic fund (but not a foreign fund) increases the likelihood of success, suggesting that the domestic fund can incrementally improve the JV's connections and local knowledge. The way to reconcile these results is as follows: Columns 3 and 4 ask the question: if there is a foreign backer, what else increases the likelihood of success. Columns 5 and 6 ask the question: if there is a JV backer, what else increases the likelihood of success. Thus, if a company has a foreign backer, then the likelihood of success will increase if the company also obtains a JV backer. If the company has a JIV backer, then the likelihood of success will increase if there is also a domestic backer.  \n\n[Insert Table 7 about here]  \n\n### 5.2.4 Exit likelihood and fund-level and company-level characteristics  \n\nThe results indicate that fund-level and company-level characteristics can influence the likelihood of success for foreign-backed companies. The results are in Table 8. The results in Column 1 and Column 4 indicate that foreign VCs are significantly more successful at exiting late-stage investments (especially as compared with domestic VCs, as indicated in negative coefficient on the ‘Late Stage' interaction in Columns 3 and 6). This result is consistent with the idea that foreign VCs can contribute to portfolio companies through their connections and capital.  \n\nThe results suggest that the nature of the company and the fund can influence the success of foreign-backed companies. The results are also mostly consistent with hypotheses 3a-3e. In unreported tests we also examine whether the impact of foreign/JV backing varies across industry or region. However, we find no evidence that it does, likely reflecting the clustering of foreign/IV backers into particular regions and locations (and the subsequent correlation between foreign/IV backing and region/industry characteristics). The main results are as follows.  \n\nFirst, consistent with hypothesis 3a, foreign VC/PE funds do better when making late-stage investments (as indicated by the positive, significant coefficient on VC/PE Variable x I(Late Stage)' in Columns 1 and 4). This is consistent with the idea that foreign VC/PE funds do better when investing in companies that have lower levels of information asymmetry.  \n\nSecond, there is some evidence that is consistent with hypothesis 3b. Diversification across industries appears to increase the successfulness of foreign VC/PE funds (viz 'VC/PE Variable x Max Num Fund Industries') but diversification across regions does not do so (viz VC/PE Variable x Max Num Fund Regions). The industry-diversification result is consistent with prior evidence that knowledge-sharing from diversification across industries can improve funds' returns (see e.g. Humphery-Jenner, Forthcoming). The regional-diversification result might suggest that there are significant costs involved with managing multiple companies in geographically disparate areas, perhaps inducing a limited-attention problem.  \n\nThird, there is weak evidence of diseconomies of scale in investments by foreign VC/PE funds (the coefficient on ‘VC/PE Variable x In(Maximum Fund Size)' is negative in Columns 1 and 4 and weakly significant in Column 1). This is consistent with prior evidence on the diseconomies of scale in VC/PE investments (Cumming and Dai, 2011; Humphery-Jenner, 2012a).  \n\nFourth, foreign VC/PE funds might gain from their experience by making more investments, but the evidence is weak. The coefficient on ‘VC/PE Variable x Max Num Fund Investments' is positive and significant in Column 1 but is negative and weakly significant in Column 4. One possible reason for the mixed results is that while doing more investments can increase the fund-manager's experience, it can also risk creating a limited attention' problem, whereby the VC/PE fund does not devote enough attention to each portfolio company (see Cumming and Dai, 2011).  \n\nFifth, syndication may not especially benefit foreign VC/PE funds. While the coefficient on “Total Num Investors' is positive and significant in all models, the interaction term on I(At least one foreign fund) x Total  \n\nNum Investors' is negative and significant in Column 1. This implies that foreign VC/PE funds gain less from having more investors (but cf the coefficient in Column 4). When read together with the positive coefficient in Column 4, the result suggest that foreign VCs might not gain very much when the number of foreign and domestic VC/PEs increases, possibly owing to the increase in monitoring costs in the syndicate, but might slightly gain when increasing the number of foreign VCs.  \n\nOverall, these results suggest that while the presence of a foreign VC/PE fund can influence exit-outcomes, the impact depends in part on the characteristics of the fund and of the portfolio company.  \n\n[Insert Table 8 about here]  \n\n## 5.3 Exit Preferences of Foreign VCs  \n\nWe hypothesize that foreign VC funds prefer M&As/trade sales. This is for several reasons including, (a) the stock market in China has a reputation for insider trading and market manipulation, (b) the limits on the listing of small firms in China, (c) the regulation of IPO underpricing coupled with the general dearth of strong regulation of financial misconduct.  \n\nThe multivariate results indicate that foreign VCs prefer M&A exits. Table 9 contains logit and probit models that predict the exit type given that the deal is successful. In this table, we limit the sample to comprise only firms that are successfully exited. The main results from Table 9 are that foreign funds prefer to exit via M&A and prefer not to exit via IPO, as suggested by the negative and significant coefficients on I(At least one foreign fund) and Prop(foreign funds).  \n\nThe coefficients on the control variables also yield some interesting results. Startups appear to be exited via M&A rather than via IPO (as indicated by the negative coefficient on I(Start-up)). Initially, this appears inconsistent with Schwienbacher (2008), who predicts that entrepreneurs prefer IPOs in order to retain a greater stake in the company. The likely explanation is that the stock market in China is relatively inefficient; and thus, VCs and entrepreneurs might fear they will obtain an inadequate price for an innovative company. This is coupled with the regulation of IPO underpricing, which worsens the ability to obtain an adequate price for young innovative companies.  \n\nAdditional results are that an IPO exit is more likely (and a M&A less likely) if the company had more investment rounds. This result might reflect the likelihood that an IPO requires the company to be relatively stable with a clear path to growth and (in especially China) to have a degree of profitability, which might necessitate more funding rounds.  \n\nThe likelihood of an IPO-exit increases if the VC-backers have exited more investments in the past but decreases with the number of investments (per se) that the VC-backer has made (although the relevant coefficients are weakly significant and are not statistically significant in all models). Given that an IPO-exit is generally preferable to a M&A-exit, this might suggest that a track-record of successful investments (rather than just a track-record of investments per se) helps to facilitate more successful investments. If the fund is more diversified across regions, then it is weakly significantly more likely to exit via an IPO, suggesting a possible positive impact of diversification. Further, this prior-exit-experience might suggest that the VCbacker has more experience dealing with the regulator (the CSRC) and thus may be more able to navigate the relatively complex regulation surrounding IPOs.  \n\nThe key finding from these models is that overseas funds prefer to exit deals via a M&A/trade sale and prefer not to exit them via an IPo. This is consistent with the idea that concerns over the efficiency and regulation of the Chinese market might deter an IPO.  \n\n[Insert Table 9 about here]  \n\n## 5.4 Exit preferences over time  \n\nWe predict that exit preferences change over time. We hypothesize that the proportion of deals exited via IPO increases over time (due to continual changes in regulation). We anticipate that this holds both for companies with and without foreign VC backing.  \n\nThe summary statistics in Table 10 support the idea of increases in IPOs over time. We focus on the data after 1998 due to sample size restrictions in prior years. The data shows a general increase in the proportion of deals exited via IPO. However, there is a reduction in the proportion of IPOs immediately after 1999, possibly reflecting both the end of the tech boom and the Asian financial crisis.  \n\n[Insert Table 10 about here] [Insert Figure 1about here]  \n\nThe multivariate models support these univariate statistics. We assess whether there is an increase in IPOs by including a time/trend variable in logit models that predict the likelihood of an IPO exit given that the deal is exited (in Table 11). We use two trend variables: one based on investment years and one based on exit years. The trend variable is a counter that starts at the year of the first observations (i.e. 1988 is the year of the first investment and 1996 is the year of the first exit for which we have data) and adds one for each year afterwards. A positive (significant) coefficient on this variable implies an increase in IPOs over time. The results show that there is a significant increase in the likelihood of an IPO exit over time. This holds for both the full sample of VC backed companies, and for the sub-sample of companies with foreign backing (see Columns 5-8 of Table 11). The control variable results are largely consistent with those reported in the above models.  \n\n# [Insert Table 11 about here]  \n\nOverall, these results support the hypothesis that there is variation over time in the likelihood of an IPO exit, or a listing in mainland China (Hypothesis 5). Specifically, the results suggest that there is an increase in the likelihood of an IPo. This could reflect both improvements in market access (the SME and venture board) and quality.  \n\n## 5.5 Robustness tests  \n\nThis section contains relevant robustness tests. For brevity, the results are available by request.  \n\nFirst, we use a two-stage approach to ameliorate endogeneity-concerns. The relationship between VC/PE backing and venture-success might reflect selection (ie. cherry picking) rather than influence (i.e. the fund improving exit-likelihood). We address this by using a two-stage approach. Here we estimate predicted values for each of the VC/PE variables and use the predicted values in the second stage model. The first-stage prediction model uses the logit models from Table 3 with the additional instruments of the number of companies in the subject-company's industry and province who received backing from a foreign fund or a JV (i.e. two instruments). We also use as instruments the ranking of the portfolio company's region (in the year the company first received financing in terms of total deposits at financial institutions, loans to financial institutions, loans to industrial companies, loans to commercial institutions, loans to agricultural institutions, and total fixed assets (all from China Data Online). The results are robust to omitting any of these instruments. We then re-run the models in Table 6 by using these predicted values. These instruments are likely to satisfy the 'relevance' condition because of the potential for herding in the VC/PE sector (i.e. VC/PE funds could invest in hot' industries) and because a region that has more investment is more likely to have the financial background necessary to attract a VC/PE fund. This logic is similar in nature to the logic behind the use of the proportion of people who are high-net-worth-individuals (HNWIs) in a given state in Becker et al (2011). The instruments likely satisfy the exclusion condition because the mere presence of other companies who have received funding is not likely to increase the likelihood of a successful exit. Indeed, it could count against success-likelihood as an increased number of funded-competitors might increase competition and decrease the subject-company's profitability. We report the second stage models in Table 12. The results are qualitatively similar to those in Table 6 and suggest that endogeneity concerns probably do not drive the results.  \n\n# [Insert Table 12 about here]  \n\nSecond, we ensure that the results are robust to various fixed effects. The main results include year dummies, industry dummies and region dummies. For the models that do not rely on dummies to analyze regions or industries, we check robustness. The results are qualitatively the same if we replace the industry dummies with the broader industry sectors (that we use to examine the regional preferences of foreign VC funds). The results are also robust to excluding the dummies.  \n\nThird, the results are robust to focusing on recent deals. One concern is that the sample comprises relatively few deals from before 2ooo. It may be possible that funds only reported information on successful deals during this period. This may induce sample selection bias. Thus, we ensure that the results are robust to excluding deals from before 2000.  \n\nFourth, the results are robust to various types of clustering. The results are qualitatively the same if we cluster standard errors by industry, year, and/or province. We also cluster standard errors by the lead' fund, which we define as the fund that invests the most money in the company. The results are also robust to omitting any particular portfolio-company-region from the analysis.  \n\nFifth, the results are robust to controlling for non-randomness in the companies that receive foreign VC backing. An issue is that non-randomness in the types of companies that receive foreign VC backing might bias the results in Section 5.2 - 5.4. We address this in two ways:  \n\n1.We use a weighting approach (following Busso et al, Forthcoming). We use the regressions in Table 3 Column 1 and Column 2 to estimate a first stage probability that a firm receives foreign VC backing or JV backing (as appropriate). Next, we calculate a 'weighting' score, defined as: Weight $=$ I[Overseas VC Backing] $^+$ (1-I[Overseas VC Backing]) x Prob(Overseas VC Backing)/(1-Prob(Overseas VC Backing)), where Prob(Overseas VC Backing) refers to the propensity score obtained from the firststage regression. Then, for all the models that are not restricted to the sub-sample of overseasbacked companies, we weight the covariance matrix by this weighting factor. The results are qualitatively the same in these models.  \n\n2. We use a propensity score approach. We use the first stage regressions in Table 3 Column 1 and Column 2 to calculate the probability that a firm receives overseas VC backing or JV backing. Next, for the set of firms that do receive such backing, we compute a 'range' of propensity scores, and identify the propensity scores that mark the $5\\%$ upper and lower tails of this distribution. Then, for the companies that do not receive overseas backing, we omit all companies whose propensity score is in the upper or lower $5\\%$ tail. The idea here is that we remove all firms whose characteristics render them unlikely to receive VC backing. The results are robust to omitting these firms from the sample.  \n\n# 6 Conclusion  \n\nThis paper analyzes whether foreign VCs increase the likelihood of venture success. Foreign VCs are typically larger and might be better connected. These connections could arguably enable foreign VCs to facilitate exits. However, foreign VCs lack local connections, which might pose a significant disadvantage in emerging markets. We use a large database of VC investments in 4753 portfolio companies in China between 1988 and 2011. We examine whether foreign VCs increase the likelihood of a portfolio company being successfully exited.  \n\nWe make several important findings. (1) Foreign VCs do not per se increase the likelihood of a successful exit. (2) For companies backed by a foreign VC, the presence of a joint venture partner increases the likelihood of venture success, supporting the idea that syndication can facilitate networking and success. (3) Foreign VCs are generally less likely to exit via IPO than are domestic VCs. Foreign VCs are likely to be deterred from exiting via an IPO due to restrictions on foreign ownership of companies on Chinese markets, significant postIPO lock-up periods, concerns over market quality, barriers to listing startups in China, and regulatory issues over matters such as underpricing. Further, foreign VCs are less likely to have the connections necessary to navigate some of the more discretionary parts of the IPO regulatory process. (4) The impact of foreign VCs on venture success depends on the characteristics of the investment and of the fund. (5) IPOs have become more popular over time, both with domestic and foreign VCs, reflecting improvements in the quality of China's stockmarkets.  \n\nThe main implications from these findings are that foreign investment does not per se increase the likelihood of investment success, although this depends on the nature of the fund, and that the exit-preferences of foreign investors reflect changing market conditions and regulations. These results suggest that future research could focus on whether foreign VCs can provide other value-added benefits, such as increased internationalization, even if they are not per se associated with venture success.  \n\n# 7 Tables  \n\nTable 1: Variable Definitions   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"2\"></td></tr><tr><td>Variable</td><td>Definition</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">GeneralVariables</td></tr><tr><td>I(At least one Foreign VC)</td><td>An indicator that equals one if at least one foreign GP invested in the company.

First, we compute a 'survival time in years, which is either (a) the time between the first investment date until the deal is exited, or (b) is 2011 (the last year in our data) less the year of the first investment. We code a ‘ending' indicator that equals one if the firm is exited and equals zero otherwise. Thus, the coefficients in the Cox model represent whether a given variable accelerates the exit-process. For example, the negative coefficient on I(Start up) means that startups are less likely to be exited. The variable definitions are in Table 1.

The column header states the VC/PE variable (which we term 'VC/PE Variable' in the left hand column). We set-up the hazard models as follows. First, we compute a 'survival' time in years, which is either (a) the time between the first investment date until the deal is exited, or (b) is 2011 (the last year in our data) less the year of the first investment. We code an 'ending' indicator that equals one if the firm is exited and equals zero otherwise. Thus, the coefficients in the Cox model represent whether a given variable accelerates the exit-process. For example, the negative coefficient on I(Start up) means that startups are less likely to be exited. The variable definitions are in Table 1.

Foreign VCs increase the likelihood that a portfolio company will list on a foreign exchange and use a top lawyer, banker, or accountant when doing so. The propensity to list overseas is moderated by the number of venture backers, the fund's size, and governance in the domestic market. Foreign VCs encourage foreign listings in domestic-backed companies. We take steps to address sample selection and endogeneity concerns. Overall, we show that foreign VCs encourage internationalization in entrepreneurial companies.  \n\nournal of International Business Studies (2013) 44, 607-621. doi:10.1057/jibs.2013.2  \n\nKeywords: venture capital; private equity and portfolio diversification; China; crossborder investments; internationalization; initial public offerings (IPOs)  \n\n## INTRODUCTION  \n\nThe last decade has seen an increase in international participation in venture investments and the globalization of venture capital (e.g., Guler & Guillen, 2010). A sizable portion of this capital has flowed to emerging markets (Chakma, Sammut, & Agrawal, 2013), notwithstanding evidence that the poor-governance environments characteristic of such markets tend to affect venture capital outcomes negatively. While it is arguable that geographic distance might make it difficult for venture capitalists (VCs) to monitor and mentor portfolio companies (Humphery-Jenner & Suchard, 2013; Lutz, Bender, Achleitner, & Kaserer, 2012), foreign VCs sometimes try to justify their presence by arguing that they can facilitate internationalization by enabling portfolio companies to list on foreign exchanges. The purpose of this paper is to test the claim that foreign VCs can indeed facilitate internationalization of portfolio companies.  \n\nListing on a foreign exchange can be an important strategic decision for a firm, potentially providing access to overseas customers and additional capital (Moore, Bell, Filatotchev, & Rasheed, 2012). Less mature firms (such as start-ups) might have difficulties listing on foreign exchanges, owing to problems of information asymmetry and home asset bias (Bell, Filatotchev, & Rasheed, 2012; Caglio, Hanley, & MariettaWestberg, 2011), problems likely to be especially severe for companies in developing markets attempting to list in developed markets (Moore, Bell, & Filatotchev, 2010). Foreign VCs (i.e.,VCs that operate across borders) could help to overcome information asymmetries, as foreign institutional investors are often associated with the transmission of improved corporate governance (Aggarwal, Erel, Ferreira, & Matos, 2011). In addition, foreign VCs are typically larger, better connected with key intermediaries, more experienced, and more knowledgeable than are domestic VCs about international (developed) markets.  \n\nThere is a dearth of comprehensive evidence about whether, or how, foreign VCs can facilitate the internationalization of their portfolio companies. While Hursti and Maula (2007) suggest that foreign VCs can help European companies list overseas, there is little comparable evidence for emerging markets. Khoury, Junkunc, and Mingo (2012) use data from 433 VC transaction rounds in 13 Latin American countries to examine how sovereign governance influences $\\mathrm{VC}s^{\\prime}$ investment practices. Lerner and Schoar (2005) use a sample of 210 PE-backed companies to highlight the fact that legal enforcement affects PE transactions. Ahlstrom and Bruton (2006) and Bruton and Ahlstrom (2003) support this claim with interview-based evidence. Wang and Wang (2011) and Dai, Jo, and Kassicieh (2011) examine investments in 243 and 418 portfolio companies in China, respectively. These, however, are relatively small samples, in view of the 4753 Chinese venture-backed companies that we have identified. Such small samples raise concerns about sample selection, and restrict the depth of analysis of the activities of foreign VCs. Wang and Wang (2012) seek to address the sample-size issue by examining a sample of 6025 VC investments across 35 countries. However, using a multi-country sample can incur the cost of introducing another source of variance for which a study must control. These studies also do not examine the role of foreign VCs in facilitating internationalization.  \n\nWe  overcome the  small-sample problem by examining a large sample of Chinese portfolio companies that received VC investments between 1988 and 2011 (sourced from ChinaVenture). China is an ideal market in which to test the contribution of foreign VCs to internationalization, for several reasons. First, it has attracted a significant amount of foreign VC capital, with VC investment rising from ${\\mathrm{US}}\\$1.2$ billion in 1999 to US\\$31.4 billion in 2010 Jiang, Cai, Keasey, & Wright, 2011). Second, the Chinese government has instituted significant changes in the regulation of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) and initial public offerings (IPOs) (Huang, 2008, 2011). This enables us to examine how the likelihood of foreign listing is affected by the quality of sovereign governance. Third, China is a market with relatively nascent domestic capital markets and haphazard regulations. This allows us to examine how sovereign governance modifies the propensity to pursue an international listing. We start with a comprehensive sample of 4753 portfolio companies that have received VC backing. To examine our central hypotheses, we focus on a subsample of 677 companies that have been successfully exited via an IPO. We use this sample of 677 companies to investigate whether foreign VCs can facilitate internationalization in the form of listing on foreign exchanges.  \n\nWe arrive at several key findings that contribute to the literature. First, we show that foreign VCs significantly increase the likelihood that a portfolio company will list on a foreign exchange. This indicates that foreign VCs do indeed contribute to the internationalization of portfolio companies.  \n\nSecond, we show that regulatory and commercial changes influence the propensity to pursue international IPOs.  \n\nThird, we find that the presence of a foreign VC increases the likelihood that a domestic-backed company will list overseas. This suggests that some syndicate diversity can be beneficial in achieving particular outcomes. We also find the related result that the impact of foreign VCs on internationalization is moderated by the total number of VCs who invest in the portfolio company.  \n\nFourth, we find that companies backed by foreign VCs are significantly more likely to use top-tier lawyers, investment banks, and accountants, suggesting that such connections might be one mechanism through which foreign VCs can facilitate international listings. These results contribute to a burgeoning stream of literature that aims to examine precisely “how\" VCs contribute value to portfolio companies (e.g., Harford & Kolasinski, 2012; Hochberg, 2012). The results also contribute to the literature on the importance of connections within the VC/PE industry (Hochberg, Ljungqvist, & Lu, 2007, 2010). Specifically, our results support the idea that foreign VCs can add value through their choice of partners in the IPO exit process.  \n\nTHEORYDEVELOPMENTANDHYPOTHESES The goal of this paper is to examine the role of foreign VCs in the internationalization of portfolio companies, with a specific focus on how foreign VCs can facilitate IPOs in international markets.  \n\n### Overseas Funds and IPO Location  \n\nEntrepreneurial companies often face barriers  to operating abroad. Apart from market-driven economic costs, firms incur social costs of access and acceptance when attempting to do business in a foreign country, costs often referred to as the \"liability of foreignness\" (Mata & Freitas, 2012; Zaheer, 1995). For entrepreneurial companies, the liability of foreignness is compounded by the liability of newness (Certo, 2003). Together, such factors mean that entrepreneurial companies face barriers in raising capital in developed markets (Bell et al., 2012; Caglio et al., 2011). Such problems could be especially  severe for companies  in information-poor environments that attempt to list overseas (Moore et al., 2010). Given that potential issuers are aware of the liabilities of foreignness and of newness, their efforts will focus on overcoming these liabilities to make their IPO a success (Moore et al., 2012).  \n\nForeign VC funds are likely to be better placed than domestic VC funds to facilitate internationalization. If a portfolio company is exited via an IPO, it can list on a domestic or an overseas market. Listing on an overseas market is easier if the portfolio company has better access to experts in that market and/or has the financial backing of a sponsor who can navigate the international listing process. Foreign VCs are more likely than domestic VCs to have such connections. In addition, funds that make cross-border investments tend to be comparatively large and well resourced (Wang & Wang, 2012), and foreign VCs are more likely than domestic  VCs to have institutional knowledge about foreign markets. For example, a US-based VC, with experience in the United States, is more likely to have institutional knowledge of the US market than is a VC based in China.  \n\nAdditionally, foreign VCs may have a greater incentive to list companies in a developed market such as the United States (aside from the significant barriers to listing companies in China and repatriating profits). Developed markets are typically well established, and have strong regulations. This is important for post-IPO value-adding activity and capital raising. It is also important for a VC that wishes to distribute its shares to its investors (limited partners) at the end of the lock-up period.  \n\nThus, we expect that foreign-backed portfolio companies are more likely than domestic-backed portfolio companies to do an IPO in a foreign market  \n\nHypothesis 1: If a Chinese VC investment is to undertake an IPO, then a foreign-backed investment is more likely to undertake the IPO in an exchange outside of China.  \n\n### Moderating Effects  \n\n### Sovereign governance  \n\nForeign funds have several advantages in listing overseas, although their inclination to do so is likely to be influenced by the quality of regulations and governance in the domestic market. VCs want to at least recoup the money they invested (preferably maximizing their returns on investments). Poorly regulated markets will be less efficient, and companies that list in such markets risk trading at a discount, owing to the illiquidity, poor market quality, and opacity that can result from inadequate regulations. Further, if the post-IPO price is below the firm's fundamental value (possibly due to opacity associated with a paucity of market regulation), then the backer might suffer a reputational penalty for failure to obtain an adequate price for the company. To the extent that foreign VCs are sensitive to this risk, they are more likely to encourage their portfolio company to list in a developed market with strong regulations.  \n\nChina's securities markets appear to suffer from these problems, as reflected by the concerns raised about its securities laws/regulations (e.g., Chen, Firth, & Gao, 2005) and the enforcement thereof (He & Su, 2013; Humphery-Jenner, 2013). However, the quality of China's financial markets has improved over time. In particular, China's regulation of markets has improved through increasingly strong restrictions on market manipulation and accounting misstatements (Huang, 2007; Jia, Ding, Li, & Wu, 2009), a trend that may make China's financial markets more attractive, increasing the likelihood of domestic IPO exits. This background suggests that while foreign VCs will remain more likely to IPO a company overseas, their willingness to list a company in Mainland China will increase with improvements in China's regulation and governance.  \n\nHypothesis 2: While foreign-backed Chinese companies remain more likely to list IPOs overseas, the proportion of such IPO listings that occur in  \n\nMainland China increases with the strength of regulation/governance in Mainland China.  \n\n### Foreign VCs in domestic-backed companies  \n\nThe involvement of foreign VCs affects the propensity of domestic VCs to list their portfolio firms in their home market. The greater a domestic VC's institutional knowledge and expertise are in the home market, the more likely it is to list a company domestically. A foreign VC can provide outside/ foreign institutional knowledge and connections to a company backed by domestic VCs. Thus, the presence of a foreign VC could increase the propensity to internationalize a domestically backed company. This logic has the natural corollary that VC-syndicate diversity can help achieve outcomes such as internationalization. We capture this in the following hypothesis.  \n\nHypothesis 3: The presence of a foreign VC moderates the impact of domestic backing on the likelihood of overseas listing. In particular, the presence of a foreign VC increases the likelihood that a domestically backed company will list overseas.  \n\n#### Other characteristics  \n\nSeveral factors might moderate the impact of foreign VCs on the likelihood of an overseas listing. Larger funds, for example, are likely to be better resourced and have more connections and potentially more experience than smaller funds. Thus, we expect the effect of the presence of foreign VCs on the likelihood of foreign listing to increase with fund size. While some large companies do benefit from cross-listing, and are generally more likely than smaller companies to cross-list (Pagano, Roell, & Zechner, 2002), in the VC market overseas listings tend to have a greater benefit for smaller entrepreneurial companies that will benefit more from increased access to capital, and from the “bonding\" benefits of listing in a developed market. Finally, portfolio companies that have the backing of many VCs are more likely to list overseas than companies with fewer VCs, because having a larger number of backers provides access to a larger number of intermediaries and financiers, who can help facilitate an international listing. We capture these expectations in the following hypothesis.  \n\nHypothesis 4: The impact of foreign VCs on the likelihood of an international IPO increases with fund size, and with the number of investors in a company, but decreases with company size.  \n\n### Overseas Funds and Top Lawyers, Accountants, and Bankers  \n\nNext, we examine some of the mechanisms through which foreign VCs might enhance internationalization. One of these is that foreign VCs can leverage their networks of financial institutions to facilitate international listings. This potential advantage follows from prior literature showing $\\mathrm{VC}s^{\\prime}$ connections to be an important driver of value-creation in VC deals (Hochberg et al., 2007, 2010). Such connections include links to top-tier bankers, toptier lawyers, and top-tier accountants that could be developed through repeat interactions (Cao & Liu, 2012; Huang, Shangguan, & Zhang, 2008).  \n\nThere is evidence of improved M&A outcomes from using top-tier lawyers (Karsten, 2012), investment banks (Bao & Edmans, 2011), and law firms (Krishnan, Masulis, Thomas, & Thompson, 2012; Krishnan & Masulis, forthcoming). Further, there is evidence that top-tier banks tend to convey additional benefits in the form of higher certification (Lee & Wahal, 2004), higher-quality post-IPO research coverage (Fang & Yasuda, 2010), and a larger clientele of institutional investors who can monitor the firm (Woidtke, 2002). Top-tier accountants could ameliorate governance issues within portfolio companies - issues that could be especially prevalent in emerging markets - and could provide certification benefits during the exit/IPO processes. International VCs are more likely to be sophisticated investors, with more connections to major international firms (Hochberg et al., 2007), and thus are more likely to have access to top lawyers, bankers, and accountants. This leads to the following hypothesis:  \n\nHypothesis 5: Foreign VC involvement increases the likelihood of using top-tier lawyers, top-tier accountants, and top-tier bankers during the IPO process.  \n\n## DATAANDSAMPLEDESCRIPTION  \n\nOur data are sourced from ChinaVenture, and include information on portfolio companies and the funds or general partners (GPs) that invest in the companies. We start with 4753 portfolio companies that received investments between 1988 and 2011 (for which ChinaVenture also has control variables, indicated below). We then restrict our sample to 677 companies that were exited via IPO (as our goal is to examine the role of foreign VCs in international listings). In our data set, each portfolio company counts as one observation: the unit of analysis is thus the individual portfolio company. We use these data to analyze the types of companies in which overseas VC/PE funds invest, and the types of exits that they are most likely to use. Our sample allows us to define the following variables (all are from ChinaVenture unless otherwise indicated), summarized in Table 1.  \n\n### Foreign-Backing Variables  \n\nA fund is defined as “overseas\" (interchangeably: foreign) if it derives its funding from overseas. A fund is defined as a ${}^{\\prime\\prime}\\mathrm{JV}^{\\prime\\prime}$ if it derives its funding from both foreign and domestic sources. This enables us to examine the importance of a foreign fund co-investing with a domestic fund. We code our dependent variables as follows: I (At least one foreign VC) equals 1 if at least one of its VC backers derives its financing from overseas. I (At least one foreign/Jv VC) equals 1 if at least one of its VC backers derives its financing either (a) purely overseas or (b) both overseas and domestically. We also collect data on the proportion of backers that are foreign or JVs. These data are collected for each round of investment, and for the overall company.  \n\nTable 1 Variable definitions   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variable Definition</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Generalvariables</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>I (At least one Foreign VC)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>I(At least oneForeign/JvvC)</td><td>We code aGP asforeign if it sources its capital from overseas markets Anindicator thatequals1if atleastoneforeignGP and/or at leastoneJVinvested in the company.We code a GP as foreign if it sources its capital from overseas markets.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>We code a GP as a JV if it obtains its capital fromboth overseas and domestic markets (as a purely foreign fund would not be able to accomplish this)</td></tr><tr><td>Prop (Foreign) Prop (Foreign/JV)</td><td>The proportion of investors in the company that are foreign</td></tr><tr><td>1 (Only Foreign VC backing)</td><td>The proportion of investors in the company that are foreign or are JVs An indicator that equals 1 if the only investors are foreign investors</td></tr><tr><td>I(Only Foreign/JV VC backing)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>S&P Rating</td><td>The S&P sovereign risk weighting assigned to (in this case) China in the given year</td></tr><tr><td>I (Big 4 Accountant)</td><td>An indicator that equals 1 if the IPO uses one of the Big 4 accounting firms.</td></tr><tr><td>I (Top 25 Lawyer)</td><td>These are KPMG, PWC, Ernst & Young,and Deloitte An indicator that equals1 if theIPO uses one of the top 25 law firms.We base this liston the top 25 revenue-generatinglawfirms as listed inAmericanLawyer:</td></tr><tr><td>1 (Top IB)</td><td>An indicator that equals 1 if the IPO uses a top investment banker.We define the top investment banks as Bank of America, Bear Stearns, Cazenove (as a subsidiary</td></tr><tr><td>Num Rounds</td><td>of J.

The data also indicate whether a given VC-backed company is exited via an M&A, a secondary buyout, or an IPO (or is not yet exited). We do not focus on M&As or secondary buyouts, as these exit types are not core to the analysis. There may also be some under-reporting of M&As and secondary buyouts, as we have 677 IPO exits compared with only 189 M&A exits and 31 secondary buyout exits (which contrasts to US evidence,in Harford & Kolasinski,2012，where only a minority of VC-backed companies are exited via IPO). We make no claims about whether the deals “not yet exited\" are liquidations. This is because some will be liquidations and some will merely be companies that have not sufficiently matured, and VCs have an incentive to conceal (and thus not report) failed investments, which makes it difficult to determine why a company is not yet exited.  \n\n### Governance Variables  \n\nHypothesis 2 suggests that the likelihood of an IPO in Mainland China increases with the strength of governance in China. There are myriad potential governance variables. Given that we are interested in assessing changes in governance over time, we use the S&P sovereign risk rating. The S&P rating is time varying (cf. the anti-director rights index in La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, & Vishny, 1997, 1998, and later modified in Spamann, 2010). The rating ranges from 0 to 20 (although, in our sample, China's S&P score ranges from 12 to 16). A higher score connotes better sovereign governance.  \n\n### Other Independent Variables  \n\nWe control for various other variables that might influence the likelihood of foreign investment and/or exit outcomes. We group these into several categories.  \n\nThe first group includes characteristics of the portfolio company. ChinaVenture reports the industry in which the company operates. These industry classifications are analogous to four-digit SIC industry classifications. To examine the industries on which foreign VCs focus, we condense these into industry dummies that are analogous to two-digit SIC industries. In addition, ChinaVenture includes information on the province in which a company is based. This enables us to create region indicators to examine the geographic preferences of foreign VC funds.  \n\nThe second group includes investment information such as investment stage (i.e., start-up, development, or late stage). Larger international funds might focus on purchasing larger (i.e., late-stage) investments, owing to difficulties in monitoring smaller companies in poor-governance countries (Zhou & Xu, 2012). Further, whether a company is a start-up or a late-stage investment might influence exit mechanisms, owing to China's relatively stringent requirements for a company to IPO. Additional variables include the number of rounds of financing, the total number of investors, and the total disclosed stake that VCs have in the company. Third, we construct variables to proxy for $\\mathrm{VC}s^{\\prime}$ level of experience and success. Although we cannot directly identify the “lead\" VC in a company, we proxy for the lead VC by taking the maximum of several characteristics across the set of VCs that invest in the company. These include the maximum number of (prior) exits that any VC has achieved (to proxy for VC experience), the maximum number of investments that any VC investor has achieved, the maximum number of regions in which any VC investor has invested, and the maximum number of industries in which any VC has invested.  \n\nThe multivariate models also control for year, industry and subnational-region (i.e., province) fixed effects (in light of prior evidence of strong time/ industry effects; Johnson, Moorman, & Sorescu, 2009; Petersen, 2009), and sub-national region effects (Ma, Tong, & Fitza, 2013).  \n\nThere are some significant differences in the portfolio companies across IPO exit location. Table 2 contains the univariate statistics by IPO exit location. The proportion of portfolio companies with a foreign backer is significantly higher for companies that list either in Hong Kong or overseas. Further, companies that list overseas tend to be backed by VC funds that are larger and more experienced, as proxied by the amount of investments and exits made by the companies' VC backers. Of the companies that list overseas, a larger proportion of companies are start-ups ( $14\\%$ of VC-backed companies that list overseas are start-ups, compared with $5.6\\%$ of companies that pursue a mainland listing). This supports the idea that China's listing requirements tend to be less accommodating to start-ups than those in other countries.  \n\nTable 2  Summary statistics by listing location   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Listing location</td><td>Mainland China</td><td>Hong Kong</td><td>Overseas (exc.

We hypothesize that overseas VC backers are more likely to exit companies overseas (i.e., outside Mainland China), and that this tendency is modified by  higher-quality  governance  in  the  domestic market (i.e., China). We anticipate that the presence of a foreign VC will moderate the likelihood that a domestic-backed company will IPO in Mainland China. In addition, we expect that factors such as fund size will moderate the propensity for foreign VCs to IPO a company overseas.  \n\nThe univariate statistics indicate that foreignbacked companies are more likely to list overseas. The statistics on IPO exit locations are presented in Table 3. Of the companies with a foreign VC backer, only $20\\%$ list in Mainland China. By contrast, $88.8\\%$ of firms without a foreign VC backer list on a Mainland Chinese market.  \n\nThe multivariate results support the idea that foreign VCs are less likely than domestic VCs to pursue IPOs in Mainland China. Table 4 presents logit models used to analyze the likelihood of an IPO in Mainland China.

Parentheses contain $p$ -values, and $\\star,\\star\\star$ . and \\*\\*\\* denote significance at $10\\%$ $5\\%,$ and $1\\%,$ respectively.  \n\nColumns 1, 2, and 3 examine the impact of foreign backing per se. Both the variables I (At least one foreign VC) and I (At least one foreign/JV VC) significantly reduce the likelihood of listing in Mainland China. These results support Hypothesis 1 (namely, that if the investment is exited via IPO, then foreign VCs are more likely to IPO in a market outside Mainland China).  \n\nThe results also support the idea that the likelihood of foreign listing varies with the quality of governance in the domestic market (consistent with Hypothesis 2). Columns 4 and 5 show interactions between the foreign VC backing variables and the sovereign governance variable (S&P Rating). The foreign-backing terms remain independently significant and negative in both models, confirming that foreign backing reduces the likelihood of mainland listing. However, the interaction terms (i.e., I (At least one Foreign $\\mathrm{VC})\\times\\mathrm{S\\&P}$ Rating) are positive and weakly significant, suggesting that improvements in governance moderate the likelihood of overseas listing by foreign backers.  \n\nWe find some evidence that the presence of foreign VCs increases the likelihood that a company backed by domestic VCs will list overseas (supporting Hypothesis 3). Column 6 examines the role of domestic and foreign VCs, independently of other factors. Column 7 examines how the presence of a foreign VC moderates the likelihood that a domestic-backed company will list overseas. The interaction term I (At least one Foreign $\\mathrm{VC})\\times\\mathrm{I}$ (At least one Domestic VC) in Column 7 is significant and negative. This implies that the presence of a foreign VC significantly reduces the likelihood that a domestic-backed company will list on a Mainland Chinese market. That is, the presence of foreign VCs contributes to  the internationalization of domestic-backed companies. These results support Hypothesis 3.  \n\nOur results also suggest that some factors moderate the impact of foreign VCs on internationalization. The relevant results are presented in Column 8 of Table 4. The larger the number of foreign VCs, the more likely a firm is to list overseas, consistent with the idea that increased connections, due to the increased number of backers, help to facilitate international listings. Conversely, the larger the investments made by foreign funds, the less likely the backers are to IPO the company overseas, consistent with the idea that smaller companies have more difficulty satisfying the listing requirements of Chinese financial markets - requirements that have historically favored large, established companies. Examples of such requirements include the requirement that a listed company can “make profits continuously\" (Securities Law Article 13(2)) and  the  RMB $30\\mathrm{m}$ capitalization requirement (Securities Law Article 50(2)).  \n\n### Are Foreign VCs More Likely to Make Use of Top-Tier Lawyers, Accountants, and Bankers?  \n\nWe next address one of the mechanisms through which foreign VCs might achieve internationalization benefits: the use of a top-tier banker, lawyer, or accountant. We examine the use of top-tier accountants and lawyers by examining whether one of the Big 4 accounting firms, one of the top 25 international law firms, or one of the top international investment banks is involved in the IPO process. We define these in Table 1. The results are presented in Table 5. The results show that foreign VCs significantly increase the likelihood of using a top lawyer, banker, or accountant, as indicated by the positive, and significant, coefficients on the variables I (At least one foreign VC) and I (At least one foreign/JV VC). This implies that one avenue through which foreign VCs can create value for portfolio firms is by using their connections with other financial intermediaries, potentially establishing certification benefits during the IPO.  \n\n### Additional Robustness Tests  \n\n#### General robustness tests  \n\nFirst, we ensure that the results are robust to various fixed effects. The main models used in our analysis are year dummies, industry dummies, and region dummies. For those models that do not rely on dummies in the analysis of regions or industries, we check robustness. We find that the results are qualitatively the same if we replace the industry dummies by broader industry sector dummies (used to examine the regional preferences of foreign VC funds). Our results are also robust to excluding the dummies. The results are qualitatively the same if we cluster standard errors by industry, year, and/or province. We also cluster standard errors by the lead fund, which we define as the fund that invests the most money in the company. The results are also robust to exclusion of deals that occurred before 2000 (before which our sample contains relatively few deals).  \n\n#### Selection issues  \n\nThe results are robust to controlling for nonrandomness in the companies that receive foreign  \n\nTable 5 Logit models predicting use of top accountants, lawyers, and bankers   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Dependentvariable</td><td colspan=\"2\">I (Big 4 Accountant)</td><td colspan=\"2\">1 (Top 25 Lawyer)</td><td colspan=\"2\">I (Top IB)</td></tr><tr><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td></tr><tr><td>I (Start-up)</td><td>0.743*</td><td>0.692</td><td>1.111**</td><td>1.037</td><td>1.003**</td><td>1.042*</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">I (Late Stage)</td><td>(0.052)</td><td>(0.405)</td><td>(0.030)</td><td>(0.155)</td><td>(0.032)</td><td>(0.080)</td></tr><tr><td>0.371</td><td>0.597*</td><td>-0.277</td><td>0.073</td><td>-0.266</td><td>0.041</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">In (Maximum Fund Size)</td><td>(0.197)</td><td>(0.096)</td><td>(0.612)</td><td>(0.860)</td><td>(0.582)</td><td>(0.919)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.039</td><td>-0.055</td><td>0.072</td><td>0.073</td><td>0.055</td><td>0.051</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">In (Maximum Ave Fund Investment Size)</td><td>(0.528)</td><td>(0.361)</td><td>(0.121)</td><td>(0.220)</td><td>(0.504)</td><td>(0.577)</td></tr><tr><td>0.363**</td><td>0.482***</td><td>0.14</td><td>0.280*</td><td>0.279*</td><td>0.462***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">I (At least one Foreign VC)</td><td>(0.015)</td><td>(0.002)</td><td>(0.221)</td><td>(0.060)</td><td>(0.073)</td><td>(0.010)</td></tr><tr><td>2.412***</td><td></td><td>2.701***</td><td></td><td>2.908***</td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">I (At least one Foreign/Jv vC)</td><td>(0.000)</td><td></td><td>(0.000)</td><td></td><td>(0.000)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>3.068***</td><td></td><td>3.137***</td><td></td><td>3.078***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(0.000)</td><td></td><td>(0.000)</td><td></td><td>(0.000)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Max Fund Exits</td><td>0.02</td><td>0.025</td><td>-0.031</td><td>-0.013</td><td>0.049</td><td>0.058</td></tr><tr><td>(0.462)</td><td>(0.430)</td><td>(0.418)</td><td>(0.755)</td><td>(0.265)</td><td>(0.237)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">MaxNumFundInvestments</td><td>-0.007</td><td>-0.006</td><td>0.000</td><td>-0.001</td><td>-0.014</td><td>-0.015</td></tr><tr><td>(0.253)</td><td>(0.310)</td><td>(0.992)</td><td>(0.855)</td><td>(0.145)</td><td>(0.180)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Max Num Fund Regions</td><td>-0.007</td><td>-0.048</td><td>-0.022</td><td>-0.059</td><td>-0.084</td><td>-0.144**</td></tr><tr><td>(0.890)</td><td>(0.305)</td><td>(0.728)</td><td>(0.360)</td><td>(0.254)</td><td>(0.024)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Max Num Fund Industries</td><td>0.035</td><td>0.016</td><td>0.076**</td><td>0.053*</td><td>0.073**</td><td>0.061*</td></tr><tr><td>(0.313)</td><td>(0.559)</td><td>(0.018)</td><td>(0.089)</td><td>(0.034)</td><td>(0.054)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Num Rounds</td><td>0.246</td><td>0.286</td><td>0.131</td><td>0.139</td><td>0.135</td><td>0.132</td></tr><tr><td>(0.149)</td><td>(0.103)</td><td>(0.498)</td><td>(0.515)</td><td>(0.528)</td><td>(0.570)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Total Num Investors</td><td>0.067</td><td>0.192*</td><td>-0.081</td><td>0.048</td><td>0.145</td><td>0.322***</td></tr><tr><td>(0.509)</td><td>(0.060)</td><td>(0.485)</td><td>(0.652)</td><td>(0.153)</td><td>(0.001)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Constant</td><td>-2.948***</td><td>-4.740***</td><td>-1.780*</td><td>-3.857***</td><td>-2.723*</td><td>-4.740***</td></tr><tr><td>(0.001)</td><td>(0.000)</td><td>(0.061)</td><td>(0.001)</td><td>(0.064)</td><td>(0.002)</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>591</td><td>591</td><td>486</td><td>486</td><td>510</td><td>510</td></tr><tr><td>Pseudo R2</td><td>47.20%</td><td>47.60%</td><td>41.30%</td><td>39.20%</td><td>54.90%</td><td>52.10%</td></tr><tr><td>Log pseudo likelihood</td><td>-204.39</td><td>-202.67</td><td>-168.59</td><td>-174.70</td><td>-138.22</td><td>-146.75</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nThis table presents logit models that predict the use of a Big 4 accountant, a top 25 lawyer, or a top investment bank (IB).

We address concerns about systematic differences between foreign-backed and non-foreign-backed companies in two ways.  \n\nFirst, we use a weighting approach (following Busso et al., 2011). We estimate a first-stage probability that a firm will receive foreign VC backing (or foreign/JV backing) as a function of the variables Num Rounds, Total Num Investors, ln (Total Invested Amount), I (Start-up), I (Late), and Total Disclosed Stake. Next, we calculate a weighting score, defined as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{{\\mathrm{Weight}=\\mathrm{I}(\\mathrm{Overseas~VC~Backing})}}&{{}}\\ {{\\displaystyle~+\\left[1-\\mathrm{I}(\\mathrm{Overseas~VC~Backing})\\right]}}&{{}}\\ {{\\displaystyle~\\times\\frac{\\mathrm{Prob}(\\mathrm{Overseas~VC~Backing})}{1-\\mathrm{Prob}(\\mathrm{Overseas~VC~Backing})}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere Prob (Overseas VC Backing) refers to the propensity score obtained from the first-stage regression. Then, for all the models that are not restricted to the subsample of overseas-backed companies, we weight the covariance matrix using this weighting factor. The results (unreported for brevity) are qualitatively the same in these models.  \n\nSecond, we use a propensity score approach. We use the above-mentioned first-stage regression to calculate the probability that a firm will receive overseas VC backing. For the set of firms that do receive foreign VC backing, we compute a range of propensity scores, and identify the propensity scores that mark the $10\\%$ lower tail of this distribution. Then, for the companies that do not receive overseas backing, we omit all companies whose propensity scores are below the $10\\%$ cut-off. The idea is to remove all firms whose characteristics render them unlikely to receive foreign VC backing. The results (unreported for brevity) are robust to omission of these firms from the sample.  \n\n### Endogeneity issues: Subsample regressions  \n\nEndogeneity is a key concern in international business research (Reeb, Sakakibara, & Mahmood, 2012). One concern is that the possibility of an international exit may cause the foreign VC to invest (rather than the foreign VC causing the firm to undertake an international exit). One way to address endogeneity issues is to examine subsamples in which endogeneity is less likely to hold. The subsample results are qualitatively similar to the reported results, and are unreported for brevity. The subsamples are as follows.  \n\nFirst, we examine size-based subsamples. Endogeneity might be less likely to hold for the set of small portfolio companies. This is because the small portfolio companies might not have the management expertise or capital necessary to undertake an international listing (without the help of a VC backer). Consequently, we divide the sample into halves based upon how much capital the portfolio company received.  \n\nSecond, we examine investment-time subsamples. If the mere prospect of an international exit attracted the foreign VC, then we would expect the foreign VC to invest for a relatively short period of time. Thus, endogeneity is less likely to hold for the set of portfolio companies that received foreign VC backing a significant time prior to exit. We therefore examine the subsample of companies where the foreign VC backer invested at least 500 days before the IPO (or, more stringently, 750 days before the IPO). We also examine the subsample of companies in which the foreign VC invested in the first round of VC investment.  \n\n#### Endogeneity issues: Two-stage regressions  \n\nWe also use a two-stage regression approach to address endogeneity concerns. For both I (At least one Foreign VC) and I (At least one Foreign/JV VC), we generate two instruments: the proportion of all portfolio companies that receive foreign VC backing (or foreign/JV VC backing, as appropriate) in (1) the subject company's year of first investment and industry, and (2) the subject company's year of first investment and region/province. These instruments should satisfy the exclusion restriction, because there is no per se reason to believe that a large foreign VC presence in a particular region or industry will necessarily make any one company more likely to list overseas. The instruments should satisfy the relevance requirement, because a large foreign VC presence in a particular region (or industry) is likely to encourage further foreign VC investment in companies in that region or industry. We statistically verify the validity of the instruments. The results for the second stage of the regressions, suppressed for brevity, are available on request, but are consistent with the main reported models.  \n\n#### Endogeneity issues: Portfolio company quality  \n\nWe also address the possibility that foreign VCs will focus on high-quality companies that are more likely to achieve a successful IPO exit by virtue of being high quality, rather than because of the presence of a foreign VC. This could induce an omitted-variable bias in the main regressions, and potentially raise issues about systematic differences between foreignbacked and non-foreign-backed companies.  \n\nWe address this concern by examining the portfolio company's EBIT/Assets at the time of listing. We collect data on the firm's EBIT/Assets at the time of the IPO from Compustat (for US listings), CSMAR (for Mainland China listings), and Factset (for listings elsewhere). We first address the issue of whether “firm quality\" is an omitted variable by controlling for the firm's EBIT/Assets. Next, we construct a distribution of EBIT/Assets values for all foreign-backed  (or foreign/JV-backed) companies. We then exclude from the sample any non-foreignbacked (or non-foreign/JV-backed) companies whose EBIT/Assets are in the upper/lower $5\\%$ tails (for the $90\\%$ interval sample) or the upper/lower $10\\%$ tails (for the $80\\%$ interval). We also estimate a two-stage model, where in the first stage we use the portfolio company's EBIT/Assets as an instrument to predict whether there is foreign backing or foreign/JV backing. For brevity, the results are not reported, but the main finding is that foreign backing is still significantly negatively associated with company listing on a mainland market.  \n\n## Discussion and Limitations  \n\nOur results are consistent with our core hypotheses. The results suggest that foreign-backed companies are more likely than domestic-backed companies to list overseas, consistent with Hypothesis 1. This supports the idea that foreign VCs can help to achieve internationalization, arguably by utilizing their connections, financial resources, and institutional knowledge. The results also suggest that the tendency to IPO a company overseas depends upon governance quality in the domestic market (supporting Hypothesis 2).  \n\nSyndication appears to be important in the internationalization of VC-backed companies. The presence of foreign VCs also increases the likelihood that a domestic-backed company will list abroad, or, conversely, decreases the likelihood that it will list domestically, supporting Hypothesis 3. Furthermore, consistent with Hypothesis 4, the likelihood that a foreign-backed company will list abroad increases with the total number of VC backers.  \n\nThe results also indicate that one mechanism of internationalization could be the use of top-tier intermediaries (supporting Hypothesis 5), suggesting that foreign ${\\mathrm{VC}}s^{\\prime}$ connections are a key avenue through which they contribute to the likelihood of international listing.  \n\nIt is worth acknowledging some limitations of this study. We have sought to address econometric concerns through the previously mentioned robustness tests. There are some alternative explanations that we cannot completely eliminate: we cannot eliminate the possibility that results reflect China's listing rules, or the difficulties that foreign VCs would have repatriating profits into their home currency (cf. China's governance). Future literature could look at the impact of recent reforms to foreign exchange controls on VC investment in China. Additionally, this paper focuses on international IPOs rather than international takeovers. Investigating the role of VC and PE funds in facilitating international takeovers is an avenue for future research.  \n\n## CONCLUSION  \n\nThis paper analyzes the role of foreign VCs in encouraging the internationalization of their portfolio companies. In this paper, we focus on investments in companies based in China. The focus on China enables us to specifically examine portfolio companies that might benefit from internationalization because it significantly improves their access to capital.  \n\nWe show that foreign-backed portfolio companies are significantly more likely than domestic companies to IPO overseas. The propensity of foreign backers to pursue an international listing varies with the quality of sovereign governance. The presence of foreign backers also increases the likelihood that a domestic-backed company will IPO overseas, suggesting that some types of syndicate diversity can be beneficial. Further, foreign VCs are more likely to use top-tier bankers, lawyers, and accountants when undertaking an IPO, suggesting that their connections with intermediaries are a key value driver of investments by foreign VCs. We take steps to mitigate concerns about endogeneity and sample selection.  \n\nThese results contribute to the literature on international business. Prior literature has examined the role of sovereign governance on VC and PE investment strategies. Additionally, some of the literature has examined the investment strategies of foreign VCs. We extend this analysis by examining the role of foreign VCs in encouraging internationalization through international IPOs.  \n\nThese results contribute to the literature on entrepreneurship, venture capital, and international business. Prior literature has attempted to identify the value drivers in VC/PE investment. We highlight that one such value driver can be internationalization. Conversely, prior literature indicates that geographic distance can be a disadvantage in VC/PE investment.We showthat even if foreign VCs might not always achieve a successful exit, they can create value by exposing portfolio companies to international markets. We contribute to the syndication literature by showing that foreign VCs increase the likelihood that a domestic-backed company will list abroad. We also highlight the importance of sovereign governance to the decision to list an entrepreneurial company abroad. Overall, these results demonstrate the importance of foreign VCs to entrepreneurial internationalization.  \n\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  \n\nThis paper benefited from comments received at the workshop on Venture Capital and Private Equity in the Asia Pacific Region (2011) and the AVCAL Research Roundtable (2011), and from presentations at the University of New South Wales and University of Technology, Sydney.

Introduction  \n\nVenture capital (VC) is defined as a professionally managed pool of risk capital invested in private companies atvariousstagesof theirdevelopmentandwherethe providers of capital actively participate in the decisionmaking process of their portfolio companies (Sahlman, 1990; Barry, 1994). Venture capitalists (henceforth VCs), typically seek investment opportunities in promising young entrepreneurial ventures about which there is little or no publicly available information. These ventures are usually far from a public offering and often have no revenues or marketable products when VCs become interested in them. The “good\" VCs have the ability to address the “sorting problem\" (Sahlman, 1990), i.e., separating the best entrepreneurial firms from marginal ones. In addition to providing capital, VCs use their industry specific knowledge, expertise, and contacts to assist entrepreneurs in strategic and operational planning, personnel and supplier selection, marketing, financing, monitoring, and even assuming managerial roles where necessary (Gormon and Sahlman, 1989; Macmillian et al., 1989; Barry et al., 1990). VCs often claim that the advising services they provide and the information they generate for their client companies are as important as the capital infused (Gompers, 1995).  \n\nThe functions performed by VCs have been widely recognized as key factors in promoting innovation and economic development (Bygrave and Timmons, 1992). VCs have been credited with creating entirely new industries and generating a more-than-proportionate share of growth in jobs and wealth. Their involvement has the potential to provide value to both investors as well as entrepreneurs. By virtue of their access to entrepreneurs and their business plans, VCs have the ability to assist investors by generating and acting on information to make decisions that reduce the risk of an investment. Similarly, entrepreneurs who are sometimes narrow technical specialists with limited managerial and business skills can benefit from the strategic guidance and inputs provided by VCs, who are often specialists in a particular industry, technology, or stage of development (Rock, 1987). Thus, VCs have the ability to select promising ventures and then through their active involvement, generate high risk-adjusted returns for investors. As a result, it is logical to expect strong long-run performance from VC-backed firms. Since VCs have been associated both with spectacular successes as well as numerous failures, it is clear that there are substantial differences in performance among them. Identifying factors that influence the performance of VC-backed organizations is likely to be an important step in understanding the functioning of the venture capital industry.  \n\nThe evidence on predictors of future performance of VCbacked organizations is however, scant. Researchers have focused either on measuring returns to VC firms or comparing the performance of VC-backed versus non-VC-backed ventures (Barry, 1994; Brav and Gompers, 1998). Recently, researchers have recognized the need to study the determinants of performance of VC-backed ventures. For example, Sapienza and Gupta (1994) suggest that it is important to study the nature of VC-entrepreneur interaction and its impact on future venture performance.  \n\nThis study attempts to address some of these issues by developing and testing a model that examines the significance and relative importance of VC factors, managerial strategy, industry structure attributes and their interactions as predictors of future performance of VC-backed organizations. The VC factors attempt to capture the impact of VC involvement in the venture firm. Managerial strategy variables capture the quality of strategic decisions implemented by entrepreneurs at various stages of development. Industry structure variables are included to capture the competitive environment. In addition, the model includes an indirect effect of VC factors on performance through managerial strategy. The indirect effect is included to measure the economic impact of the joint decision-making environment, which is a unique characteristic of VC involvement. Prior to VC involvement, entrepreneurs are solely responsible for setting, monitoring, and adjusting strategic direction and standard operating procedures. VC involvement produces new competencies, resources, and perspectives that can lead to a fundamental shift in organizational goals. Although entrepreneurs are still primarily responsible for strategic direction and managing the day-to-day operations, they are now required to consult and share decision-making authority with VCs. The joint decision-making environment provides VCs with an opportunity to influence goals, priorities, actions, and strategic attributes, and also bring much-needed discipline to the organization with the introduction of formal control processes. On the other hand, the downside to sharing decision-making authority includes increased agency problems, slower decision-making, loss of focus, and increased potential for conflict, all of which can adversely affect venture performance (Sapienza and Korsgaard, 1996). The net impact of joint decision-making on performance depends on the strategic fit between VCs and entrepreneurs and the extent to which they achieve effective coordination and integration of their objectives and actions.  \n\nThe research model is tested on a sample of VC-backed organizations that subsequently issued initial public offerings (IPOs). VC factors, managerial strategy, and industry structure variables are measured at or prior to the IPO. A VC-backed venture is classified as a performer if it demonstrates an increase in operating performance in the post-IPO years compared to its pre-IPO level. The predictive ability of the various models are evaluated on their sorting efficiency, i.e., ability to differentiate between performing and non-performing VC-backed organizations. Managerial implications are also discussed.  \n\n### 2. Research model  \n\nFig. 1 provides an overview of the research model. The bold arrows represent the direct effects of VC factors, managerial strategy, and industry structure variables on performance. The variables within the VC factors group measure the effectiveness of VCs in conducting activities such as deal origination, screening, evaluation, contract structuring, and post-investment monitoring (Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984). Managerial strategy variables represent strategic decisions evaluated and implemented by entrepreneurs (henceforth, managers) in their pursuit of competitive advantage. Finally, industry structure variables capture the competitive environment and are included as control variables.  \n\nIn order to capture the joint decision-making environment, the model includes an indirect effect of VC factors on performance represented by a path through managerial strategy. Although the primary responsibility to set strategy, make ongoing strategic adjustments, and carry out day-today operations rests with managers, VCs have the opportunity to participate in the decision-making process and exert their influence. Depending on factors such as stage of development, extent of innovation being pursued, and managerial expertise, some VCs may choose to take a hands-off approach while others may actively participate in the decision-making process (Sapienza and Gupta, 1994). When the VC-entrepreneur interaction is low, the direct effects capture the impact of VC factors on performance. On the other hand, where VC-manager interaction is high, the indirect effects are likely to be strong. A description of the VC factors, strategy and industry structure variables, and their hypothesized effect on venture performance are described below.  \n\n#### 2.1. VC factors  \n\nThree sets of VC related variables are explored within this category: (1) quality of due diligence, (2) participation in the corporate governance, and (3) experience.  \n\nThe major source of value added and the fundamental reason for the existence of VCs is their ability to originate, screen, and evaluate promising entrepreneurial firms. The process of VC involvement usually starts with the originating VC becoming aware of high growth, promising, capitalstarved, young companies that are not yet visible to the public. During the screening process, the originating VCs review and evaluate the business plan, management commitment/skills, product uniqueness, intensity of competition, and quality and competence of ventures’ managerial teams and the CEO (Sapienza and Gupta, 1994). After discovering a promising prospect, VCs do not make a binding commitment to provide financing but instead send the proposal to other VCs for their review (Lerner, 1994a,b,c). Organizations in which investments are made only if several independent and knowledgeable observers agree, may be superior to ones where projects are funded after a single affirmative decision (Perez, 1986; Sah and Stiglitz, 1986).  \n\n![](images/eff4919bc8dab02ab7caecbab27ba7640ddf7e1d6bc41c470048a5776fbe36f0.jpg)  \nFig. 1. Research model.  \n\nAnother major reason for VCs to circulate details of their prospective deals is to try and convince other VCs to commit to providing capital. VCs tend to syndicate their investments, i.e., join together by pooling capital, knowledge, expertise, and other resources when investing in promising prospects (Bygrave and Timmons, 1992). A measure of the quality of the originating VC's due diligence is the ability to attract a large number of other VCs to join the syndicate. A strong investing syndicate has the potential to positively influence venture performance in several ways. Larger-sized syndicates are more capable of raising substantial capital for the venture at favorable terms for current and future needs, achieve efficient risk diversification, and entice institutional investors, top-tier investment bankers, and high-quality analysts. Further, larger syndicates provide incentives to the originating VC to closely monitor venture performance. Failure results in loss of reputation capital and diminished ability to put together future deals. Thus, highquality due diligence by the originating VC results in largersized syndicates, which in turn leads to superior financing, more effective monitoring, and stronger institutional support. Therefore, a positive relation between quality of due diligence and venture performance is expected.  \n\nParticipation in the corporate governance allows VCs to exert influence and ensure that managers pursue a valuemaximizing agenda. The timing and extent of VC involvement in the corporate governance depends on the amount of capital and resources being provided. VCs that are willing to commit substantial resources are naturally in a better position to negotiate stronger participation in the corporate governance. The extent of VC participation in the corporate governance is explored through strength of board representation and duration of service on the board. VCs are almost always represented on the board and, typically, occupy two seats or about one third of the director positions (Barry et al., 1990). A stronger proportional VC representation on the board increases manager's receptivity to advice and therefore, enhances VCs ability to initiate change and reshape decision-making processes. Therefore, a positive relationship between VC board representation with venture performance is expected.  \n\nVCs usually take long-term board positions in ventures and typically assist them for about half their corporate lives prior to the IPO. Their involvement on the board usually continues well after the company has gone public and they continue to provide access to capital and other resources (Barry et al., 1990). However, the main impact of VCs on the board is likely to be prior to the IPO when major financial, operational, and strategic decisions need to be made in preparation for the public offering. The longer the length of service by VCs on the board of directors, the greater is the ability to monitor, observe, oversee, and exercise beneficial influence (Barry et al., 1990). On the other hand, extended presence on the board can also indicate that the venture is marginal and reflective of the difficulty the VC is experiencing in bringing the company to the market. Thus, the direction of relationship between duration of VC service on the board and venture performance is ambiguous.  \n\nExperience is another element of VC effectiveness. Experienced VCs should be in a stronger position to conduct rigorous due diligence, put together powerful syndicates, and exert influence on the board. In the post-investment stage, experienced VCs should have a relative advantage in assessing market trends, identifying positioning opportunities, providing supplier and customer management support, selecting timing of the IPO and future financing, and thereby, add value to the strategic and operational planning process (Barry, 1994; Lerner, 1994a,b,c; Gompers, 1995). Therefore, a positive relationship between VC experience and venture performance is expected.  \n\n#### 2.2. Managerial strategy variables  \n\nThe six managerial strategy variables explored in the research model are: (1) extent of innovation being pursued, (2) selection of investment banker, (3) stage of development at time of IPO, (4) managerial ownership retention, (5) product scope, and (6) asset mix and utilization.  \n\nManagers must determine what innovations to pursue, how to pursue them, whether pursuit of innovation is likely to be profitable, and whether innovation will provide a sustainable competitive advantage in the face of strong imitation efforts by rivals (Rumelt, 1987). Although highly innovative firms are riskier, they have the potential to provide spectacular results if their growth and innovation are successfully managed. Ventures pursuing innovative strategies also benefit from the experience, perspectives, market contacts, and resources provided by VCs. Therefore, a positive relation between level of innovation being pursued and performance is expected.  \n\nA crucial strategic decision facing venture managers contemplating an IPO is the selection of the investment banker charged with the responsibility to market, distribute, and underwrite the securities. Often, the entire success or failure of the going public process depends on this decision. The selection of an investment banker is a two-way matching problem since both parties incur considerable risk and resource outlays, and therefore, the decision to come together needstobe carefully evaluated.Investmentbankersevaluate management capabilities, product uniqueness, growth potential, vision, business strategy, and a host of other factors before agreeing to market the firm. Similarly, managers use several criteria in deciding which investment banker is best suited to take the firm public. A measure of successful strategic posturing by venture managers is the ability to attract prestigious investment bankers to take the firm public. Prestigious investment bankers have the ability to add value as a result of their superior due diligence skills, marketing efforts, and certification and monitoring functions (Carter et al., 1998). Therefore, a positive relation between investment bank prestige and venture performance is expected.  \n\nNew entrepreneurial firms go through several stages of growth patterns such as conception, development, first production, commercialization, growth, etc. Managers need to decide when and at what stage of venture development should they issue an IPO. The most appropriate course of action is, however, far from clear. Firms that go public prematurely risk rejection from the capital markets due to an insufficient track record of sales and profitability and uncertainties associated with unresolved demand, product and process design, availability of skilled employees, raw materials, and channels of distribution (Sapienza and Gupta, 1994). Further premature offerings prevent managers from ensuring that fully developed marketable products, appropriate management teams, and standard operating procedures are in place prior to going public. All these factors are likely to be important prerequisites to future venture performance. On the other hand, ventures that go public at a later stage in their development may experience a decline in their post-issue performance as a result of a growth slowdown. Therefore, a relationship between stage of development at the time of IPO and post-issue performance is expected.  \n\nDeciding on the extent of managerial ownership retention in the post-IPO firm is an important strategic consideration.  \n\nThe process of going public leads to dilution of ownership of the original entrepreneurs. Jensen (1986) suggests that a dilution of ownership of insiders is likely to weaken the alignment of their incentives with that of other shareholders, leading to the classic agency problem. In the absence of any mechanism to overcome the agency problem, the performance of the firm is likely to decline. Retaining substantial managerial ownership in the post-IPO firm is one credible method of overcoming this type of an incentive problem as it provides incentives to insiders to continue to stay involved in the firm and provide positive guidance. A positive relationship between managerial ownership retention and venture performance is expected.  \n\nVenture managers need to decide whether to compete on a broad front or follow a niche strategy. The extensive debate in the literature over whether new ventures should pursue niche strategies or compete on a broad front suggests that this is a complex issue with no straightforward prescriptions (Carter et al., 1994). Conventional wisdom suggests that smaller, newer firms should avoid direct competition with larger players and pursue profitable niche strategies. On the other hand, competing in several segments provides the potential to exploit economies of scale and scope. The direction of relationship between product scope and performance is, therefore, ambiguous.  \n\nFinally, asset mix and utilization is an important strategic attribute that bears directly on operational efficiency and therefore, impacts performance (Hambrick and Lei, 1985). Managers need to set up efficient control processes so as to optimize the utilization of their asset mix.A positive relation between asset mix and utilization and venture performance is expected.  \n\n#### 2.3. Industry structure variables  \n\nSeveral studies have suggested that industry structure variables such as concentration, barriers to entry, elasticity of demand, etc., have a significant impact on performance (Schmalensee, 1981; Rumelt, 1987). Since VCs tend to focus on a narrow set of industries, it is unlikely that industry  structure  variables can  explain differences  in performance among VC-backed ventures. However, industry attributes are included in the model as control variables. The industry structure variables selected are drawn from the literature and include industry concentration, industry growth, industry advertising intensity, and industry R&D intensity (Montgomery, 1985; Sharma and Kesner, 1996).  \n\n### 3. Sample description and research methodology  \n\n#### 3.1.Sample selection and data description  \n\nA sample of 104 VC-backed ventures that subsequently issued IPOs are collected for the period 1982-1990 from  \n\nGoing Public: The IPO Reporter and the Venture Capital Journal. The sample is further segmented into performing and non-performing ventures. Performing ventures are defined as firms that demonstrate an increase in their post-IPO operating return on assets compared to their pre-IPO levels. Thus, a venture is categorized as a performer if OPRA (post)-OPRA (pre) $\\geq0$ ,where OPRA(pre) is the operating return on assets of the venture in the fiscal year prior to the IPO and OPRA(post) is the average operating return on assets of the venture in the first, second, and third year after the IPO. Firms that demonstrate a decline in operating return on assets compared to their pre-IPO levels are categorized as non-performing. This definition results in a sample of 26 performing and 78 non-performing ventures.  \n\nTable 1 provides a description of the independent variables, their measures, and the expected sign of the relationship with venture performance. The quality of VC due diligence is measured by the size of the investing syndicate, i.e., number of VCs that take an equity position in the IPO of the venture (NUMVC). The variable PROPVC measures proportion of VCs on the board while BD represents the time between the VC joining the board of the venture and the IPO. As suggested in the literature, the age of the originating VC is used as a proxy for experience (Barry et al., 1990). The stage of venture development at the IPO is measured by the logarithm of the gross proceeds raised at the IPO (LSIZE). The extent of technical innovation being pursued (INNOV) reflected by the risk of the venture (Sapienza and Gupta, 1994) is measured by the standard deviation of market returns. The post-IPO managerial ownership retention including VC stake is represented by the variable ALPHA (Jain and Kini, 1994). The investment bank prestige (PRESTIGE) is measured using the nine point Carter and Manaster prestige scale (see Carter and Manaster, 1990 for details). The breadth of product line (SCOPE) is measured by the number of four-digit SIC codes assigned to the firm's product line. Asset mix and utilization is measured by asset turnover (AMU) (Grover, 1993). Industry concentration (CONC) is assessed by the Herfindel four firm index. Industry growth (GR) is computed by measuring the 3- year industry sales growth in the years prior to the public offering. Industry advertising intensity (ADV) and R&D intensity (R&D) are measured by taking the average of advertising expenses and R&D expenses as a percentage of sales for all firms in the same industry as the VCbacked venture.  \n\nA correlation matrix is examined to assess the potential for multicollinearity problems. There is some evidence to indicate significant correlation among some within group as well as between groups of variables. The issue of correlated variables is addressed by carefully constructing models to avoid multicollinearity problems and with a factor analytical model described later in Section 4.  \n\nTable1 Variable description and predicted relation with venture performance   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variable</td><td>Measure</td><td>Predictedrelationship</td></tr><tr><td>Quality ofDueDiligence</td><td>Size ofSyndicate(NUMVC)</td><td>+</td></tr><tr><td>DurationofVCserviceonboard</td><td>TimebetweenVCinduction on board of venture and the IPO (BD)</td><td>士</td></tr><tr><td>ExperienceofVC</td><td>Age of Lead VC (EXP)</td><td>+</td></tr><tr><td>Proportional VC representation on board</td><td>Proportion of board seats occupied byVCs onboard of venture (PROPVC)</td><td>+</td></tr><tr><td>Stageof development attimeofIPO</td><td>Log Size of IPO offering (LSIZE)</td><td>+</td></tr><tr><td>ExtentofInnovationbeingpursued</td><td>Risk of Firm (INNOV)</td><td>干</td></tr><tr><td>BreadthofProductLine</td><td>Number of four digit SIC codes (SCOPE)</td><td>干</td></tr><tr><td>AssetMixandUtilization</td><td>Asset turnover (AMU)</td><td>+</td></tr><tr><td>Investment Banker Prestige</td><td>Nine point reputation scale (PRESTIGE)</td><td>+</td></tr><tr><td>Ownershipretentionbymanagers andVCs</td><td>Post-IPO stake (ALPHA)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>IndustryGrowthRate</td><td>Three year industry growth (GR)</td><td>干</td></tr><tr><td>Industry AdvertisingIntensity</td><td>Average advertising/sales (ADV)</td><td>+</td></tr><tr><td>IndustryR&Dintensity</td><td>AverageR&D/sales (R&D)</td><td>+</td></tr><tr><td>IndustryConcentration</td><td>Herfindel's four-firm index (CONC)</td><td>+</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n#### 3.2. Methodology  \n\nInitially, univariate logit models are estimated to identify significant predictors of performance. The dependent variable is the probability that the venture is a performer. The independent variables are drawn from the VC factors, managerial strategy, and industry structure groups. The predictive ability of variables capturing the interaction between VC factors and managerial strategy are also examined.  \n\nNext, several multivariate logit models are evaluated to compare the predictive ability of each of the three groups of variables and their combinations. The predictive ability of the logit models are evaluated based on three measures: (1) percentage of performing ventures correctly classified, (2) overall classification accuracy, and (3) weighted efficiency. The weighted efficiency measure is included to overcome some of the problems with the overall classification rate, which can be misleading when the two groups to be classified are present in significantly different proportions in the population (Korobow and Stuhr, 1985; Wertheim and Lynn, 1993). The weighted efficiency measure proposed by Korobow and Stuhr (1986) is defined in this study as the product of the overall percentage correctly classified, the percentage of performers correctly classified, and the ratio of the number of performers correctly identified to the total number of firms identified as performers. In a perfect model, the product of the three components will equal 100 percent. In a less-than-perfect model, this measure will be sensitive to both the number of performers correctly identified and the percentage of firms identified as performers.  \n\nThe overall correct classification rate is also compared with a benchmark obtained using the Morrison's proportional chance criteria (Morrison, 1969). In a sample with 26 performers and 78 non-performers, the overall correct classification rate based on the chance criterion is 62.5 percent. In order to establish generalizability of the results, the classification accuracy of all models are based on the Lachenbruch procedure (Lachenbruch, 1975; Wertheim and Lynn, 1993). The cut-off probability for all models is 0.50.  \n\n### 4. Empirical results  \n\n#### 4.1. Summary statistics  \n\nTable 2 provides a comparison of performing and nonperforming ventures. The mean values for the two groups as well as the $t\\cdot$ -statistics and the non-parametric Wilcoxon sign statistic are reported. The results suggest significant differences between the two groups on several dimensions. For instance, there is a significant difference between performers and non-performers on the quality of VC due diligence. The mean syndicate size is 8.26 for performers versus 4.28 for non-performers (the difference is statistically significant at the 0.01 level). VCs are also more involved in the corporate governance of performing ventures compared to non-performing ventures. The proportion of VCs on the board is  \n\nTable2 Comparison of performing versus non-performing ventures   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variables</td><td>Performers</td><td>Non-performers'</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>mean</td><td>mean t (Z)</td></tr><tr><td>Size (SM)</td><td>32.58</td><td>18.31 2.07 (2.37)</td></tr><tr><td>ALPHA</td><td>22.23</td><td>19.17 1.79 (1.48)</td></tr><tr><td>AMU</td><td>1.59</td><td>0.93 4.14 (3.85)</td></tr><tr><td>INNOV</td><td>0.6296</td><td>0.1536 2.48 (3.37)</td></tr><tr><td>PRESTIGE</td><td>7.11</td><td>6.50 1.68 (0.98)</td></tr><tr><td>SCOPE</td><td>2.03</td><td>2.06 -0.11 (0.10)</td></tr><tr><td>NUMVC BD</td><td>8.26</td><td>4.28 3.76 (3.46)</td></tr><tr><td>EXP</td><td>36.01</td><td>31.35 0.80 (1.63)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>14.58</td><td>12.33 0.77 (0.24)</td></tr><tr><td>PROPVC</td><td>35.30</td><td>24.20 2.49 (2.72)</td></tr><tr><td>CONC</td><td>0.22</td><td>0.23 -0.65 (-0.29)</td></tr><tr><td>R&D</td><td>0.06</td><td>0.05 1.60 (1.63)</td></tr><tr><td>ADV</td><td>0.0116</td><td>0.0113 0.03 (-0.39)</td></tr><tr><td>GR</td><td>17.60%</td><td>20.99% 0.95 (1.11)</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n35.30 percent for performers versus 24.20 percent for nonperformers (statistically significant at the 0.01 level). While performing firms are characterized by longer VC service on the board (36.01 vs. 31.35) months and associated with more experienced VCs (14.58 vs. 12.33) years compared to their non-performing counterparts, the differences are not statistically significant.  \n\nThe results in Table 2 also suggest significant differences between performers and non-performers on several managerial strategy variables. The mean IPO issue size is 32.58 million for performers versus 18.31 million for nonperformers and the difference is statistically significant. This supports the conjecture that performing ventures go through several rounds of private financing until they achieve efficient scale before going public. Managers of performing ventures retain significantly higher post-IPO ownership, pursue higher levels of innovation, and demonstrate higher asset utilization compared to their non-performing counterparts. While the mean value of investment banker prestige is significantly higher for performers, the median is not significantly different. There is no significant difference in the breadth of the product line between the two groups. Finally, the results show that there are no significant differences between the two groups on industry structure variables.  \n\n#### 4.2. Univariate logit models  \n\nTable 3 provides the results of estimating univariate logit models. The results are consistent with the comparisons in Table 2. While all VC factor variables are positively related to venture performance, only the size of the syndicate and proportion of board seats occupied are significant. Four of the six managerial strategy variables (LSIZE, INNOV, ALPHA, and AMU) are significant and positively related to venture performance while industry structure variables are all insignificant.  \n\nTable3 Univariate logit model estimation results   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variable</td><td>Intercept</td><td>Beta</td><td>p-Value</td></tr><tr><td>LSIZE</td><td>3.58</td><td>0.88</td><td>0.0080</td></tr><tr><td>INNOV</td><td>1.31</td><td>0.76</td><td>0.0805</td></tr><tr><td>ALPHA</td><td>2.19</td><td>0.054</td><td>0.0800</td></tr><tr><td>AMU</td><td>0.75</td><td>1.48</td><td>0.0003</td></tr><tr><td>SCOPE</td><td>-1.05</td><td>-0.02</td><td>0.9200</td></tr><tr><td>PRESTIGE</td><td>1.85</td><td>0.11</td><td>0.2832</td></tr><tr><td>NUMVC</td><td>2.38</td><td>0.21</td><td>0.0002</td></tr><tr><td>BD</td><td>1.26</td><td>0.0050</td><td>0.4849</td></tr><tr><td>EXP</td><td>1.45</td><td>0.0270</td><td>0.2875</td></tr><tr><td>PROPVC</td><td>2.10</td><td>0.5538</td><td>0.0142</td></tr><tr><td>CONC</td><td>0.87</td><td>-0.9766</td><td>0.5480</td></tr><tr><td>GR</td><td>0.82</td><td>-1.4001</td><td>0.3627</td></tr><tr><td>ADV</td><td>1.11</td><td>0.6850</td><td>0.9656</td></tr><tr><td>R&D</td><td>1.77</td><td>0.1189</td><td>0.1101</td></tr><tr><td>NUMVC×LSIZE</td><td>-2.46</td><td>0.0758</td><td>0.0001</td></tr><tr><td>NUMVCXALPHA</td><td>-2.30</td><td>0.0106</td><td>0.0002</td></tr><tr><td>NUMVC×INNOV</td><td>-1.36</td><td>0.1862</td><td>0.0524</td></tr><tr><td>NUMVCXAMU</td><td>-1.188</td><td>0.0144</td><td>0.7300</td></tr><tr><td>PROPVCXLSIZE</td><td>-2.18</td><td>0.2010</td><td>0.0018</td></tr><tr><td>PROPVCXALPHA</td><td>-1.98</td><td>0.0242</td><td>0.0087</td></tr><tr><td>PROPVCXINNOV</td><td>-1.25</td><td>0.2506</td><td>0.0820</td></tr><tr><td>PROPVCXAMU</td><td>-0.6411</td><td>—0.2247</td><td>0.1497</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThe results of univariate logit models that include interactions between VC factors and managerial strategy indicate several significant variables. For instance, interactions between strength of VC syndicate and managerial strategy variables such as stage of venture development at IPO, extent of innovation, and ownership retention are significant predictors of venture performance. Further, interactions between the above three managerial strategy variables and VC involvement in corporate governance are also significant predictors of performance.  \n\n#### 4.3. Multivariate logit models  \n\nThe estimation results and the predictive performance of the various multivariate logit models are reported in Table 4. The first model (INDUSTRY) includes all four industry structure variables. The $\\mathrm{X}^{2}$ value indicates that the overall model is not significant and none of the four industry structure variables are significantly related to performance. The overall correct percentage is 59.60 percent, which is below the 62.5 percent obtained by the Morrison's chance criteria (Morrison, 1969). The percentage of performers correctly identified is 34 percent and the weighted efficiency of the model is only 5.40 percent. Thus, industry structure variables are poor predictors of VC-backed venture performance.  \n\nThe second model (FIRM), includes the four significant managerial strategy variables identified from the univariate analysis. The $\\mathrm{X}^{2}$ value is significant at the 0.01 level and three of the four variables are significantly related to the probability of venture performing. The predictive ability of the FIRM model exceeds the rate predicted by the chance criteria and shows a substantial improvement over the INDUSTRY model. The weighted efficiency is 17.30 percent while the overall classification rate and percentage of performers correctly identified are 75 percent and 46.15 percent, respectively.  \n\nThe third model (VC) includes all four VC factor variables and is significant at the 0.01 level. The model provides a substantial improvement in predictive performance compared to either the INDUSTRY or FIRM models. The VC model has an overall correct classification rate of 76.90 percent and correctly classifies 53.84 percent of the performers. The VC model also has a higher weighted efficiency of 23.32 percent.  \n\nThe next step is to investigate whether VC factors and strategy variables as separate predictors in the same model outperform models that include either VC factors alone or strategy variables alone. To test this proposition, a fourth model (COMBINE) including significant variables (identified from univariate analysis) from the VC factors and strategy group is estimated. The COMBINE model provides a substantial improvement in predictive accuracy over both the VC and FIRM models. The weighted efficiency is 38.90 percent while the overall correct rate and percentage of performers correctly classified are 77.00 percent and 65.38 percent, respectively.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>(0.4073) (0.0001) (0.0001) 3.99 24.29 26.85 31.78 5.40</td></tr><tr><td>17.30 23.32 59.60 75.00 76.90</td><td>38.90 77.00</td></tr><tr><td>34.00 46.15 53.84 11.84 (0.13) -7.16 (0.67) -1.72 (0.30)</td><td>65.38</td></tr><tr><td>-0.89 (0.61)</td><td>0.1356 (0.636) 0.13 (0.65) 0.0175 (0.53) 0.0001 (0.98)</td></tr><tr><td>0.19 (0.01) 0.0694 (0.06) 0.39 (0.45) 0.66 (0.08) -1.16 -3.13 FIRM Model INDUSTRY Model</td><td>(0.0028) 0.18 (0.01) 0.82 (0.06) 0.42 (0.48) 0.47 (0.24) -2.75 -4.31 VCModel COMBINE Model</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nI ONOO 品 SANNN   NI VHITA AONNI HZIST oq  \n\nTable 5 Rotated factor matrix   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variable</td><td>Factor 1</td><td>Factor 2</td><td>Factor 3</td><td>Factor 4</td></tr><tr><td>SCOPE</td><td></td><td></td><td>-0.60</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>PRESTIGE</td><td>0.57</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>ALPHA</td><td></td><td>0.90</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>LSIZE</td><td>0.69</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>INNOV</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.67</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>AMU</td><td>0.69</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CONC</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>GR</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>R&D</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.73</td></tr><tr><td>ADV</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>BD</td><td></td><td>0.76</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>EXP</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.76</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>PROPVC</td><td>0.58</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>NUMVC</td><td>0.73</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Percent ofVariance</td><td>26.97%</td><td>17.72%</td><td>9.44%</td><td>8.65%</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n#### 4.4. Factor analytic logit model  \n\nThe multivariate analyses, thus far, have focused on examining the direct effects of VC factors, managerial strategy, and industry structure variables on performance. The research model also predicts the indirect effect of VC factors (path through managerial strategy) on venture performance. The impact of this indirect path depends on the extent of strategic fit between VCs and managers. One method to include strategic fit in the model building exercise is to add interaction terms (Schoonhoven, 1981). Researchers, however, point to several problems with this approach such as difficulty in interpreting results and multicollinearity problems as a result of the interaction terms being highly correlated with the terms that compose them (Dewar and Werbel, 1979). Further, researchers have to specify the functional form of the relationship, which can be difficult, especially when dealing with a large number of potential interactions, as is the case with this study (Alexander and Randolph, 1985). To overcome these problems, a factor analytic approach similar to that of West (1985) is adopted. The basic assumption is that each variable can be expressed as a linear combination of hidden factors that affect the variable and possibly other variables. A study of the factors can also provide insight into the critical success factors affecting performance of VC-backed ventures.  \n\nThe 14 variables from the VC factors, strategy, and industry structure groups are subjected to a principal component analysis with varimax rotation. Based on eigenvalues greater than 1 criteria, a four-factor solution is selected, which accounts for 64 percent of the variance. Factor 1 accounts for 26.97 percent while the remaining three factors account for 17.72 percent, 9.44 percent, and 8.65 percent of the variance, respectively. The results are reported in Table 5. Only loadings greater than 0.50 are used to interpret the factors.  \n\nThe first factor can be named VC-manager strategic fit. Variables that load on this factor include strength of VC syndicate, VC representation on the board, stage of venture development at IPO, investment banker prestige, and asset mix and utilization. This factor captures the fit between VC strengths-expertise and managerial strategy variables. Factor 2 can be named long-term commitment of VC-managers. Variables that load on this factor include duration of VC service on the board and managerial ownership retention in the post-IPO firm. The third factor is harder to interpret and can be named VC selection criteria. Variables that load on this factor include product breadth (negative loading), extent of innovation being pursued, and VC experience. Ventures with narrow focus and pursuing high levels of innovation are well positioned to benefit from VC experience. The fourth factor can be named industry barriers to entry. Since this factor has a single loading (industry R&D intensity), it needs to be interpreted with caution.  \n\nTo measure the effectiveness of these four factors as predictors of venture performance, a factor analytic logit model is estimated using the procedure adopted by West (1985). The factor scores are used as variables in estimating a maximum likelihood logit model with venture performance (performing vs. non-performing) as the dependent variable. The results are reported in Table 6. The VCmanager strategic fit and long-term commitment are significantly positively related while the VC selection criteria is significantly negatively related to venture performance. The industry barriers to entry factor is not significantly related to venture performance. The predictive accuracy of the factor analytic model is substantially higher than the multivariate logit models reported in Table 4. The weighted efficiency is 44.54 percent while the overall correct classification rate and percentage of performers correctly classified are 84.60 percent and 80.76 percent, respectively. Therefore, inclusion of the indirect effect of VC factors on performance significantly enhances the predictive ability of the model.  \n\nTable 6 Factor analytic logit models   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Modelparameters</td><td>Intercept</td><td>pValue</td></tr><tr><td>Intercept</td><td>2.83</td><td>0.0001</td></tr><tr><td>Factor 1:VC-Manager strategic fit</td><td>2.88</td><td>0.0001</td></tr><tr><td>Factor 2:Long-term commitment</td><td>0.82</td><td>0.0300</td></tr><tr><td>Factor3:TimingofVCinvolvement</td><td>-1.14</td><td>0.0800</td></tr><tr><td>Factor 4:Industrybarriers</td><td>-0.34</td><td>0.390</td></tr><tr><td>Performers correctly identified (%)</td><td>80.76</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Overall correctly classified (%)</td><td>84.60</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Weighted efficiency (%)</td><td>44.54</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n### 5. Conclusion and implications  \n\nThe study develops and tests a model examining the direct and indirect impact of VC factors, managerial strategy, and industry structure variables on the performance of VC-backed ventures. VC factors and managerial strategy variables are both significant predictors of venture performance. VC factors, however, outperform managerial strategy variables in predicting venture performance. The value of joint decision-making can be inferred from results, which suggest that VC-managerial strategy interaction variables are significant predictors of venture performance.  \n\nInsights gained during the model building process help in identifying three basic critical success factors driving the performance of VC-backed ventures. The first factor is the VC-manager strategic fit. Economic benefits are realized when VCs seek involvement in firms where their expertise and strengths can be put to maximum use in guiding strategy and decision-making processes. The second critical factor is long-term commitment. Both VCs and venture managers need to demonstrate long-term commitment to ensure performance. Finally, VCs are most effective when involved with firms in the early stages of their development and pursuing focused strategies.  \n\nThe above results have important implications for investors as well as entrepreneurs seeking capital. Potential investors need to decide whether to take a stake in the VC-backed venture at the IPO. Focusing on performance areas such as VC-manager strategic fit, long-term commitment of VCs and managers, and stage of venture development at the time of VC involvement are likely to provide valuable insights into future performance. Similarly, entrepreneurs benefit from knowledge of critical success factors of VC-backed ventures. A central question facing entrepreneurs is whether they should accept restrictive covenants imposed by VC participation or maintain their independence and seek alternative sources of financing. Ventures pursuing high levels of innovation and, in early stages of their development, benefit most from VC involvement. Conversely, ventures in more advanced stages of development, or those pursuing mature products or technology do not appear to benefit significantly from VC involvement.

High returns make the VCs more selective and eager to terminate nonperforming ventures because they can move on to new ones. The scarcity of VCs enables them to internalize their social value, and the competitive equilibrium is socially optimal. Moreover, the bilaterally efficient contract is a simple equity contract. We estimate the model for the period 1989-2001 and compute the excess return to venture capital, which turns out to be 8.6 percent. Finally, we back out the return of solo entrepreneurs, which is increasing in their wealth and ranges between zero and 3.5 percent.  \n\n### 1. Introduction  \n\nThis paper develops a theory of the market for venture capital. We model not only the contractual relationship between entrepreneurs (Es) and venture capitalists (VCs) but also the market for such contracts. Several predictions of our model are consistent with empirical observations relating to firm financing, including the fact that VC-backed firms are often worth more at initial public offerings (IPOs) and that founders of companies appear to be more patient than VCs. We estimate our model using a data set that covers VC-financed companies created between 1989 and 1993. We estimate the excess return to venture capital to be 8.6 percent. While high, this estimate is lower than the private-equity returns data imply for funds of the 1989-93 vintage. One feature of our model is particularly useful: It enables estimation of the returns of solo entrepreneurs using only data on VC-backed companies. We thereby find that the excess returns of solo entrepreneurs range between zero and 3.6 percent.  \n\nWe consider a setup involving entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. Each E possesses a project and some amount of wealth, which varies across Es. To succeed, a project requires a continuous flow of investment as well as continuous effort exerted by the E. Both the project return and the time at which a project succeeds are random. After an initial setup cost is incurred, the return of a given project is observed, but no information is revealed about how long it will take for the project to succeed. Motivated by data, the hazard of the success time is assumed to first rise and then decrease. That is, after a certain point, agents become increasingly pessimistic about a quick success. The Es with little wealth are unable to invest in their projects for the optimal length of time, and they benefit from external funding. Each VC has unlimited wealth and can enter into a contractual relationship with at most one E at a time. A contract specifies an initial transfer and a rule for sharing the return. However, neither the investment of a VC nor the effort of an E is contractible. We are particularly interested in the case in which VCs are scarce relative to Es.  \n\nWe investigate our model's unique stationary equilibrium. We show that when VCs are scarce, their expected payoff in equilibrium is positive. That is, VCs earn an excess return on their investments. The equilibrium behavior of agents can be characterized by two types of decisions. First, Es must decide whether to go solo or seek VC financing, which gives rise to the following trade-off. On the one hand, since Es have limited wealth, going solo might prevent an E from financing her project up to the optimal termination time. On the other hand, if an E contracts with a VC, she must forfeit part of the project's return. We show that, in general, the set of wealth levels of those Es who are VC-backed in equilibrium is an interval. An E whose wealth lies above this interval will prefer to go solo. An E with wealth below the interval is so poor that she is unable to finance even a fraction of the setup cost. This makes it impossible for a VC to contract with such an E and realize his equilibrium payoff.  \n\nThe second important decision agents must make involves specifying a termination time for the project, should it remain unsuccessful. The termination decision of a solo E is quite simple: she terminates either because she runs out of money or because the marginal benefit of investing in the project reaches its marginal cost. The termination decision of a VC is more complex. Since a VC always has the option of moving on to a new company, attending to a nonperforming company entails for him a forgone-earnings cost that an E does not face. Hence, the first-order condition defining the VC's optimal termination time takes into account the fact that his total cost of financing a project is the sum of the capital investment and the opportunity cost of staying with a project rather than moving on to something new.  \n\nThe opportunity cost faced by VCs plays an important role in explaining the differences between solo and VC-backed companies. This higher cost imposes a higher quality hurdle. That is, a VC's cutoff, the lowest return for which he is willing to finance a project, is higher than that of a wealthy solo E. This selection effect raises the IPO values ofVCbacked firms above those of other firms, consistent with empirical studies (see Megginson and Weiss 1991; Hochberg 2012). The novelty of our explanation is that it does not rely on an assumption that VCs somehow increase the quality of the firm they finance. Instead, it is based on a simple selection argument: The opportunity cost faced by a VC induces him to terminate faster than a wealthy E would, and to stay alive in a VC's portfolio, a project must have a higher expected quality. This is in accord with the results of Sorensen (2007), who finds that the bulk of the observed positive association between VC quality and project quality is due not to direct VC influence on the payoff but to sorting. The VCs in fact do appear to be less patient than solo Es. Jones and Rhodes-Kropf (2004) report that founders are more attached to and more patient with their projects than VCs who behave as if their discount rates were higher.  \n\nOur model describes an environment in which efficiency is achieved via simple equity contracts between VCs and Es, despite the fact that an E's effort is unobservable.2 Such contracts are commonly used in practice, as Kaplan and Stromberg (2003) document. Using equity contracts is optimal in our setting for the following reason. Bilateral efficiency requires that the optimal termination time maximizes the total benefit of financing a project net of total costs. Both the VC and the E incur only a fraction of the total cost, since the VC invests the capital and the E exerts the effort. If the equity contract specifies a sharing rule that allocates a fraction of the benefit to each party according to his proportional contribution to the cost, then maximizing the objective of each agent is equivalent to maximizing total surplus, scaled down by a constant. Since scaling has no effect on the solution, each agent terminates the project efficiently. Of course, equity contracts might not eliminate some other agency problems that are not present in our model. Bergemann and Hege (2005), for example, assume that Es can divert VC funds for private consumption. In their model, equity contracts do not restore efficiency, and projects are terminated too early because the Es can extract rent as a result of the nonverifiability of their investment decisions.  \n\nFinally, we calibrate our model, showing that an eight-parameter example provides a fairly good fit to our data set, which covers approximately 1,000 vC-supported companies founded between 1989 and 1993. The model targets the cross-sectional distribution of exit values, the flow costs of investment, the flow of net revenue as a function of company age Orthe $^{\\circ\\prime}J$ curve,” and the essential properties of the distribution of waiting times until “success\" (defined as IPO or private sale) or failure. In addition, our numerical exercise accomplishes two goals. First, we estimate an excess return to venture capital of 8.6 percent, which is not surprising given the high returns earned by private-equity funds begun in the 1989-93 period (Cambridge Associates 2011; Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Vissing-Jorgensen, forthcoming).3 Second, our model generates a distribution of Es′ returns, which are not included in our data. In our model, projects are ex ante identical. The only reason for an E to seek VC backing is that she is wealth constrained. From our data on VC-backed companies, we are able to back out all necessary parameters of the distribution of the projects in order to estimate the return to solo entrepreneurs. We estimate the profit of a wealth-unconstrained solo E to be 3.6 percent. Constrained solo Es earn lower but still positive excess returns.  \n\nSeveral features of our model are related to aspects of existing models. First, in our model a VC is better equipped to evaluate projects than a bank. Ueda (2004) studies an E's choice between bank financing and VC financing, and, as in our model, a VC is better able to assess projects than banks. However, the VC can also use information revealed to him to set up a competing business and thereby reduce the value of an E's project.  \n\nSecond, in our model a VC might abandon one project so that he can move on to another. In Holmes and Schmitz (1990), managers of projects sometimes terminate existing projects in order to start new ones; the trade-off is similar to the one faced by VCs in our model.  \n\nThird, in our model the rents enjoyed by VCs are determined by the supply of VCs relative to the number of Es, in conjunction with the distribution of wealth among the population of Es. Free VCs face no delays in matching with Es, but the maturation of a project is a multiperiod process during which information about the project's quality may come to light. Michelacci and Suarez (2004) have a similar model, but they introduce free entry of Es who, in contrast to our model, always require outside financing. They also introduce a matching friction, and the rents of a project are divided by Nash bargaining between the E and the VC. Inderst and Muller (2004) drop the Nash-bargaining assumption; in their model a project lasts one period, and their optimal contract entails an equity-sharing rule.  \n\nFinally, in this paper we investigate multiperiod optimal contracting with no commitment, and the literature on this topic is vast. For example, we have already mentioned Bergemann and Hege (2005), who study multiperiod contracting between a single VC and a single entrepreneur, with their outside options taken as given. In their model, an E can divert the invested funds to private consumption. The authors show that, in order to provide the E with proper incentives, the optimal contract specifies a decreasing stream of investment funds. As a result, the project is supported for less time than would be socially efficient. While in Bergemann and Hege's study incentives cause early and inefficient terminations of VC-backed projects, the VC's high opportunity cost results in early, yet efficient, terminations in our model.  \n\nPlan of the paper—Section II describes the model, and Section III characterizes the unique stationary equilibrium. Section IV discusses the relation between equilibria and welfare. Section V presents an example, fits it to data, and discusses the implications. Section VI concludes the paper. Online Appendix A contains the proofs, Appendix B describes the data, Appendix C describes the solution algorithm and the estimation procedure in detail, Appendix D reports several simulations, and Appendix E discusses robustness.  \n\n### II. Model  \n\nConsider a measure $x$ of infinitely lived VCs, each able to raise a sufficient amount of money at rate $r$ There is also an inflow of projects at a rate normalized to one. Each project is in the possession of a different E. The Es cannot borrow and have initial wealth w, which is distributed according to the cumulative distribution function (CDF) $\\Psi$ .An E can have at most one project in her lifetime.  \n\n#### A. Projects  \n\nTo succeed, a project requires an immediate payment of a start-up cost $C$ and from the moment of start-up until the project yields a payoff, it also requires $k$ units of continuous investment and $a$ units of continuous effort on the part of E. A project can be undertaken by an E together with a VC or by the E alone, in which case she must rely only on her own wealth. A VC can finance at most one project at a time. The project yields payoff $\\pi$ at time $\\tau$ , where $\\pi$ and $\\tau$ are random variables independent of each other and $\\pi$ has a finite mean. Let $G$ and $F$ be the CDFs of $\\pi$ and $\\tau$ ,respectively, and let $g{\\mathrm{and}}f$ denote the corresponding densities. Both $G$ and $F$ have support in $\\mathbb{R}_{+}$ . Assume that the hazard rate $f/(1-F)=h$ is bell shaped: it increases up to the modal age, $\\tau_{m}$ , then decreases. Agents’ optimism about a quick realization of $\\tau$ initially grows, but after age $\\tau_{m}$ they become increasingly pessimistic.4 Neither party knows $\\pi$ or $\\tau$ ex ante, but their distributions are common knowledge. If the project is a solo venture, E learns $\\pi$ after incurring the cost $C_{\\bullet}$ If the venture is VC-backed, $\\pi$ becomes known to both parties after the cost $C$ is incurred. The signal, $\\pi$ ， is treated as being perfect, but one could, with minor changes in the analysis, assume it to be only a noisy estimate of the profit. On the other hand, no information about $\\tau$ is observed. If the project ever suffers from either underinvestment or a lack of effort for at least one period, it will never yield a positive payoff. The expected value to developing projects is assumed to be positive. That is, if financing decisions regarding the project are made optimally, it yields a positive payoff in expectation.  \n\n#### B. Preferences  \n\nAll agents are risk neutral and discount the future at the rate $r$ whichis equal to the risk-free interest rate at which agents can save. The VC maximizes the expected discounted present value of his net income. The E maximizes the expected discounted present value of her net income minus the disutility associated with the effort she exerts.  \n\n#### C. Contracting  \n\nFeasible contracts.—The contract a VC can offer consists of two numbers: $(p,s)$ . The number $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is a lump sum the VC pays E immediately upon signing the contract. The number $s\\mathopen{}\\mathclose\\bgroup\\left(\\geq0\\aftergroup\\egroup\\right)$ specifies the share of the payoff kept by the E if the project succeeds. If the project yields payoff $\\pi$ E keeps $s\\pi$ and the VC receives $(1-s)\\pi$ . The payment $\\boldsymbol{p}$ and the sharing rule $s$ are enforceable. On the other hand, neither $\\mathrm{E}$ 's effort nor the VC's ongoing investments are contractible. After the transfer $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is paid, the arrangement is a pure equity contract. We could in theory allow for more complicated contracts in which $s$ depends on $\\tau$ and $\\pi$ . However, we will show that for parameter values of our interest, we can restrict attention to this simple contract type without loss of generality.  \n\nTiming of the contractual relationship.—-If E signs the contract $(p,s)$ ,she receives a payment $\\boldsymbol{p}$ from the VC immediately. Then E finances the start-up cost $C$ . and both parties learn the value of $\\pi$ .5 At each date, if the payoff has not yet been realized, E has to decide whether or not to exert effort and the VC has to decide whether or not to invest. We assume that both parties can observe the history of investments and effort when making these decisions.6 (We show that our equilibria remain valid regardless of whether the parties can observe each other's support for the project.) If the VC decides to no longer invest in the project, he is free to devote his time to another venture. If E decides to stop exerting effort, she exits the market. If the project succeeds, the two parties share the surplus according to $s$ and their involvement comes to an end. The VC seeks a new match, and E leaves the market.  \n\n#### D. Market Structure  \n\nThere is a market for each contract $(p,s)$ . Each VC who is not in a contractual relationship and each E who seeks VC backing must decide which market to enter.7 Suppose that at time $t$ a measure $n$ of VCs and a measure $m$ of Es enter the market corresponding to contract $(p,s)$ Then $\\operatorname*{min}\\{n,m\\}$ pairs of VCs and Es are randomly matched and sign the contract $(p,s)$ . A VC who is not matched can decide to either stay in the market or choose a different one. If an E is unmatched, she is forced to leave the market and abandon her project.8 When an E first has an idea for a project, she must decide whether to abandon it outright, seek VC backing, or go solo, that is, implement her project on her own. This decision is irreversible.  \n\n#### $E$ Banks  \n\nIn our model, banks guarantee a risk-free interest rate, but they do not finance projects, as they face two disadvantages with respect to VCs. First, banks lack the expertise of VCs and Es; banks learn $\\pi$ only on the date the project succeeds, $\\tau$ and not before. Second, banks lack the ability to monitor borrowers' behavior, while VCs can ensure that Es do not divert investment toward private consumption. In fact, banks never offer contracts to Es; any borrower could claim to be an E while using the funds for personal use, leaving the bank with negative profits.  \n\n#### F.Equilibrium  \n\nThe strategy of an agent specifies the market he or she enters and, after a contract is signed and $\\pi$ is revealed, the time at which support for the project will be terminated. We restrict attention to stationary equilibria, in which decisions do not depend on calendar year or history. An E's decision regarding which market to enter depends only on her wealth, $w_{\\star}$ We characterize the unique competitive equilibrium for each value of $x_{:}$ . the measure of VCs. However, we are particularly interested in the case in which $x$ is small, and the empirical part of the paper focuses on this case.  \n\n#### II1.Analysis  \n\nWe first analyze the termination decisions of solo Es and compute the threshold level of wealth above which an E is better off going solo than abandoning her project. We then examine the termination decisions regarding VC-backed projects and characterize equilibrium contracts. Finally, we identify the set of Es who are VC-backed as a function of the equilibrium value of a VC.  \n\n#### A. The Solo Entrepreneurs  \n\nTermination problem.—A solo entrepreneur might run out of money and have to terminate her project. So, E will optimally defer all her consumption until the project is completed.? Consider an E with wealth $\\boldsymbol{w}$ and let $\\boldsymbol{w}_{t}$ denote E's wealth at time $t$ if her project has not yet succeeded. At every instant of time, E must invest $k$ and receives interest on $\\boldsymbol{w}_{t}$ . So, the evolution of $\\boldsymbol{w}_{t}$ is described by the differential equation $\\dot{w}_{t}=r w_{t}-k$ The initial condition is $w_{0}=w-C$ because the cost $C$ must be incurred immediately. Solving for $\\boldsymbol{w}_{t}$ gives  \n\n$$\nw_{t}={\\frac{k}{r}}+\\left(w-C-{\\frac{k}{r}}\\right)e^{r t}.\n$$  \n\nFor each $w\\ge C$ , let $\\tau(w)$ be the date at which the entrepreneur's wealth is depleted. The date $\\tau(w)$ is obtained by solving for $t$ in the equation $w_{t}=0$  \n\n$$\n\\tau(w)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{r}\\mathrm{ln}\\left[\\frac{k}{k-r(w-C)}\\right]}&{\\mathrm{if}w<\\displaystyle\\frac{k}{r}+C}\\ {\\displaystyle\\infty}&{\\mathrm{if}w\\geq\\displaystyle\\frac{k}{r}+C.}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nThe unconstrained entrepreneur—Suppose that $w\\geq k/r+C$ ; that is, E has enough money to finance her project forever. Since new ideas occur only to new entrepreneurs, E's continuation value is zero if she terminates the project prior to success. If E's project is worth $\\pi$ ,the payoff she collects by supporting it until time $T$ is10  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{{\\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{T}e^{-r t}\\{\\pi f(t)-(a+k)[1-F(t)]\\}d t}}}\\ {{{\\mathrm{}}}}\\ {{{\\displaystyle=\\int_{0}^{T}\\left[\\pi-\\frac{a+k}{h(t)}\\right]e^{-r t}f(t)d t},}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $h=f/(1-F)$ . Therefore, for each $\\pi$ , she solves the following maximization problem:  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{max}_{T}\\int_{0}^{T}\\left[\\pi-\\frac{a+k}{h(t)}\\right]e^{-r t}f(t)d t.\n$$  \n\nThe solution of this problem, $T^{s}(\\pi)$ , is depicted in figure 1. Suppose that the project yields a payoff $\\pi_{1}$ and the optimal termination time, $T^{S}(\\pi_{1})$ ， is interior. Then $T^{S}(\\pi_{1})$ satisfies both the first-order condition $a+k=$ $\\pi_{1}h(T^{S}(\\pi_{1}))$ and the second-order condition $h^{\\prime}(T^{s}(\\pi_{1}))<0$ . Note that if $\\pi_{2}>\\pi_{1}$ , then $T^{S}(\\pi_{2})>T^{S}(\\pi_{1})$ Finally, let $\\pi_{\\operatorname*{min}}^{s}$ denote the smallest realization of $\\pi$ that the unconstrained entrepreneur should support. Then  \n\n![](images/07c04199572a16a646400e44c77af7c45ca15e3d77b87f14e62f15034b497c4a.jpg)  \nF1G. 1.—The determination of $T^{s}(\\pi)$  \n\n$$\nT^{S}(\\pi)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{\\displaystyle h^{-1}\\bigg(\\frac{a+k}{\\pi}\\bigg)}&{\\mathrm{if~}\\pi>\\pi_{\\mathrm{min}}^{S}}\\ {0}&{\\mathrm{otherwise.}}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nThe wealth-constrained entrepreneur—Suppose now that $w<k/r+C$ After E pays the cost $C$ and learns $\\pi$ , the expected value of the project is  \n\n$$\nq(\\pi,w)\\equiv\\operatorname*{max}_{T\\in[0,\\tau(w)]}\\int_{0}^{T}\\left[\\pi-\\frac{a+h}{h(t)}\\right]e^{-\\nu t}f(t)d t.\n$$  \n\nThe solution $T_{w}^{s}(\\pi)$ either is equal to zero or is found by solving for $t$ in the first-order condition:  \n\n$$\n\\pi h(t)\\geq a+k,\n$$  \n\nwhich holds with equality whenever $0<T^{s}(\\pi)\\le\\tau(w)$ . Therefore, if the project  is  worth  pursuing after incurring $C$ ，then the solution is $\\operatorname*{min}(\\tau(w),T^{s}(\\pi))$ , and if not, it is zero. If $\\pi_{\\mathrm{min}}^{s}(w)$ denotes the smallest payoff for which it is worth providing support initially, then  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{T_{\\mathit{w}}^{s}(\\pi)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{\\operatorname*{min}\\left\\{\\tau(w),\\:h^{-1}\\left(\\displaystyle\\frac{a+h}{\\pi}\\right)\\right\\}}&{\\mathrm{if}\\:\\pi>\\pi_{\\operatorname*{min}}^{s}(w)}\\ {0}&{\\mathrm{otherwise}.}\\end{array}\\right.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nWho should start a project?The expected surplus, after incurring the cost $C_{s}$ of a solo entrepreneur with wealth $\\boldsymbol{w}$ is  \n\n$$\nQ^{s}(w)=\\int q(\\pi,w)d G(\\pi).\n$$  \n\nThe next lemma characterizes some important features of the curve $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{Q}}^{s}$ LEMMA1.(i)For $w<k/r+C$ $\\partial\\bar{Q}^{s}/\\partial w>0$ ．(ii)For $w\\ge k/r+C,$ ${\\partial Q^{s}}/{\\partial w}=0$ and $Q^{s}(w)>C$  \n\nPart i holds because an additional dollar, rather than being consumed, can be used by a budget-constrained E to prolong her project and to generate a positive surplus. To see part i, note that an E with $w>k/r+C$ can support her project for as long as it is privately optimal. An additional dollar would then not generate an excess return, so in this region the slope of $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{Q}}^{s}$ in figure 2 is zero. Since the expected value of a project is positive by assumption, $Q^{s}(w)>C$ whenever $w>k/r+C.$  \n\nGoing solo or abandoning the project.—Suppose that VC backing were not an option. The payoff to going solo with wealth w would be $w-C+$ $Q^{s}(w)$ . We explain why this payoff must appear as depicted in figure 2. The payoff is not defined for $w<C$ because $\\mathrm{E}$ would be unable to pay $C.$ At $w=C$ , it is zero because, after paying $C,\\operatorname{E}$ would have no money left to invest in the project. For larger values of wealth the slope exceeds unity, as shown in part i of lemma 1. At $w=k/r+C$ $w-\\bar{C}+Q^{s}(w)=$ $w+\\sigma$ , where $\\sigma>0$ because $Q^{s}(k/r+C)>C$ by part ii of lemma 1. The intermediate value theorem implies that there is a unique $\\boldsymbol{w}^{*}$ at which $Q^{s}(w^{*})=C.$ An E with $w$ prefers going solo over abandoning her project if and only if $w\\geq w^{*}$  \n\n#### B. VC Backing  \n\nIn every stationary equilibrium, the expected payoff of a free VC, $V^{*}$ ,is constant across time and across VCs. This payoff determines a VC's opportunity cost of supporting a project and plays an important role in termination decisions. We refer to $V^{*}$ as the value of a VC. The following subsection identifies the termination decisions for VC-backed projects, the equilibrium contracts, and the set of VC-backed Es as functions of $V^{*}$  \n\n![](images/8005790b2d8cc51305e21999e96adb3090823e934473f5e9c82890a3e8a8b222.jpg)  \nF1G. 2.—The payoff of solo Es  \n\n1. Termination Problems after a Contract Is Signed  \n\nWe now analyze the incentives of each agent to support a project after the contract $(p,s)$ is signed and both parties learn the value of $\\pi$ if the value of a VC is $V^{*}$  \n\nEntrepreneur—-If E believes that her project will be financed by the VC until time $T$ and that she will get $s\\pi$ if the project is successful, she solves the following problem:11  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{max}_{T\\leq\\overline{{T}}}\\int_{0}^{T}\\left[s\\pi-\\frac{a}{h(t)}\\right]e^{-r t}f(t)d t.\n$$  \n\nLet $T^{E}(\\pi,s,{\\overline{{T}}})$ denote the solution to this problem. If $\\pi$ is below a certain cutoff, denoted by $\\pi_{\\mathrm{min}}^{E}\\left(s,{\\overline{{T}}}\\right)$ . E never exerts effort, and hence $T^{E}(\\pi,s,{\\overline{{T}}})=0$ . Otherwise, the solution satisfies the following first-order condition:  \n\n$$\nh(T^{E}(\\pi,s,\\overline{{T}}))\\geq\\frac{a}{s\\pi}.\n$$  \n\nThe local second-order condition, which is also the sufficient condition, is $h^{\\prime}(T^{E}(\\pi,s,\\overline{{T}}))<0$ . Note that because of the bell-shaped hazard assumption, $h(T^{E}(\\pi,s,\\overline{{T}}))>a/s\\pi$ implies $T^{E}(\\pi,s,{\\overline{{T}}})={\\overline{{T}}}$ whenever $\\pi\\geq$ $\\pi_{\\mathrm{min}}^{E}\\bar{(}s,\\overline{{T}})$  \n\nVC.—Suppose that the value of a free VC is $V^{*}$ . If the VC trusts $\\mathrm{E}$ to support the project until time $\\overline{T}$ , then, after signing the contract, his maximization problem is  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{max}_{T\\leq\\overline{{T}}}\\int_{0}^{T}\\biggl[(1-s)\\pi+V^{*}-\\frac{k}{h(t)}\\biggr]e^{-r t}f(t)d t+e^{-r T}(1-F[T])V^{*}.\n$$  \n\nLet $T^{{\\cal V C}}(\\pi,s,V^{*},\\overline{{{T}}})$ denote the solution to this problem. If $\\pi$ is lower than a certain cutoff, denoted by $\\pi_{\\operatorname*{min}}^{V C}\\left(s,V^{*},\\overline{{T}}\\right)$ the VC does not invest in the project at all and $T^{\\nu c}(\\pi,s,V^{*},\\overline{{{T}}})=0$ . Otherwise, the solution must satisfy the first-order condition  \n\n$$\nh(T^{V C}(\\pi,s,V^{*},\\overline{{T}}))\\geq\\frac{k+r V^{*}}{(1-s)\\pi}.\n$$  \n\nThe sufficient condition is again $h^{\\prime}(T^{V C}(\\pi,s,V^{*},\\overline{{T}}))<0$ If (6) holds with strict inequality, then $T^{V C}(\\pi,s,V^{*},\\overline{{T}})=\\overline{{T}}$ whenever $\\pi\\ge\\pi_{\\operatorname*{min}}^{V C}(s,V^{\\ast},\\overline{{T}})$  \n\nIf the project is terminated at time $\\overline{T}$ , it must be that $\\overline{{T}}=T^{E}(\\pi,s,\\overline{{T}})=$ $T^{V C}(\\pi,s,V^{*},\\overline{{T}})$ . The largest solution of this chain of equalities satisfies both (5) and (6), but it is also solved by any smaller termination time. However, all of the smaller solutions are due to coordination failure; that is, both parties would continue to invest in the project at $T$ if they knew that the other party would do the same. Since we assume away coordination problems (see the Stackelberg assumption in n. 6), a VC-backed project with return $\\pi$ will be terminated at time  \n\n$$\nT(\\pi,s,V^{\\ast})=\\operatorname*{max}\\{T:T^{E}(\\pi,s,T)=T^{V C}(\\pi,s,V^{\\ast},T)\\}.\n$$  \n\nAgain, let $\\pi_{\\operatorname*{min}}^{V C}\\left(V^{*},s\\right)$ denote the cutoff below which a project is terminated immediately.  \n\n### 2. Equilibrium Contracts  \n\nWe next describe the contracts that will be signed in equilibrium. We show that if E is sufficiently rich, the equilibrium contract will involve a sharing rule that maximizes the sum of the contracting parties’ surpluses. If, on the other hand, E is poor, the equilibrium sharing rule favors the VC too strongly, and E will terminate the project while the joint surplus from investing is still positive.  \n\n506  \n\nWe first characterize the sharing rule that maximizes the joint surplus. Let $Q^{E}(s,V^{*})$ and $Q^{V C}(s,V^{*})$ denote the continuation values of an $\\mathrm{E}$ and a VC, respectively, after accepting the contract $(p,s)$ and paying $C_{\\bullet}$ That is,  \n\n$$\nQ^{E}(s,V^{*})=\\int\\int_{0}^{T(\\pi,s,V^{*})}\\left[s\\pi-\\frac{a}{h(t)}\\right]e^{-r t}d F(t)d G(\\pi)\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{Q^{V C}(s,V^{*})=\\displaystyle\\int\\int_{0}^{T(\\pi,s,V^{*})}\\biggl[(1-s)\\pi+V^{*}-{\\frac{k}{h(t)}}\\biggr]e^{-r t}d F(t)}}\\ {{+V^{*}e^{-r T(\\pi,s,V^{*})}[1-F(T(\\pi,s,V^{*}))]d G(\\pi).}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe relationship between the sharing rule and the joint surplus is stated in the next lemma.  \n\nLEMMA 2. (i) arg $\\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname*{max}_{s\\in[0,1]}[Q^{E}(s,V^{*})+Q^{V C}(s,V^{*})]=a/(a+k+r V^{*}).}\\end{array}$ (ii) $\\arg\\operatorname*{max}_{s\\in[0,1]}Q^{V C}(s,V^{*})\\in\\left(0,a/(a+k+r V^{*})\\right)$  \n\nTo develop intuition for part i, note that if $s=a/(a+k+r V^{*})$ , then $T(\\pi,s,V^{*})$ satisfies both (5) and (6) with equality whenever $\\overline{T}$ is sufficiently large. In addition, with $\\overline{{T}}=T(\\pi,s,V^{*})$ , both of these conditions are reduced to  \n\n$$\nh(T(\\pi,s,V^{*}))=\\frac{a+k+r V^{*}}{\\pi},\n$$  \n\nwhich is just the first-order condition for joint surplus maximization. If $s<a/(a+k+r V^{*})$ , the joint surplus shrinks because E terminates the project prematurely. However, since the VC's share is larger, his continuation value is also larger in some cases, as stated in part ii.  \n\nThe next lemma characterizes the equilibrium contracts.  \n\nLEMMA 3. Suppose that the equilibrium value of a free VC is $V^{*}$ and an E with $\\boldsymbol{w}$ is VC-backed. If $w\\ge C+V^{*}-Q^{V C}(V^{*},a/(a+k+r V^{*}))$ , the contract this $\\mathrm{E}$ signs is $s=a/(a+k+r V^{*})$ and $\\phi=Q^{\\scriptscriptstyle V C}(V^{*},s)-V^{*}$ Otherwise, $\\boldsymbol{p}=\\boldsymbol{C}-\\boldsymbol{w}$ and $s$ is defined by $\\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname*{max}_{s\\in[0,1]}Q^{V C}(V^{*},s)=V^{*}+\\boldsymbol{p}.}\\end{array}$  \n\nSince VCs compete in contracts, the equilibrium sharing rule is constrained efficient. If E has enough wealth, the sharing rule maximizes the sum of the continuation values and, hence, equals $a/(a+k+r V^{*})$ by part i of lemma 2. The up-front payment $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is determined by the fact that the VC's value should equal $V^{*}$ . If $w\\bar{<}C+V^{*}-Q^{V C}(V^{*},a/(a+k+$ $r V^{*})$ ), then E is unable to accept this contract because after signing it she is unable to cover $C_{\\bullet}$ In order for the VC to enter into a contract with such an E, he must increase the up-front payment $p.$ The VC might be able to do so by offering a contract that specifies an $s$ that is smaller than $a/(a+$ $k+r V^{*}$ 0. The continuation value of a VC offering this $s$ is higher than that derived from the sharing rule $a/(a+k+r V^{*})$ by part ii of lemma 2, which compensates him for the larger $\\boldsymbol{p}$  \n\n### 3. Who Should Get VC Backing?  \n\nThis subsection identifies the wealth levels of those Es who get VC backing as a function of $V^{*}$ . The key step involves characterizing the payoff a free VC would receive if he could make a take-it-or-leave-it offer to an E with wealth $w_{\\star}$ We denote this payoff by $V(w)$ We will show that the set of $\\boldsymbol{w}$ values of VC-backed Es is an interval with end points determined by $V(w)=V^{*}$ . That is, the equilibrium contracts signed by both the poorest and richest VC-backed Es are take-it-or-leave-it offers.  \n\nSuppose that a VC can always offer a take-it-or-leave-it contract to E with $w$ and that it yields him a value of $V.$ Then this contract solves the constrained maximization problem  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{max}_{(p,s)}Q^{\\scriptscriptstyle V C}(V,s)-p,\n$$  \n\nsubject to  \n\n$$\nC-p\\leq Q^{E}(V,s),\n$$  \n\n$$\nC\\leq p+w,\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\nw+Q^{s}(w)-C\\leq w+Q^{E}(V,s)-(C-\\l_{\\mathscr{P}}),\n$$  \n\nwhere (9a) guarantees that $\\mathrm{E}$ at least breaks even, (9b) requires that E can pay $C$ after receiving $\\boldsymbol{p}_{:}$ and $\\mathrm{(9c)}$ ensures that E prefers signing the contract to going solo. Let $P(V)$ denote the value of this problem. Of course, a VC can always choose not to participate in the market, thereby receiving a value of zero. Hence, the value $V(w)$ is the unique solution to $V=$ $\\operatorname*{max}\\{0,P(V)\\}$  \n\nWe next solve the VC's problem, ignoring (9b) and (9c), which leads to an upper bound on $V^{*}$ . To this end, let $\\overrightharpoon{V}$ denote the value of the problem (9) subject to (9a).  \n\nLEMMA 4. The solution to (9) subject to (9a) is $\\left(\\Bar{p},\\Bar{s}\\right)$ , where $\\bar{p}=$ $C(k+r\\overline{{V}})/(a+k+r\\overline{{V}})$ and $\\bar{s}=a/(a+k+r\\overline{{V}})$ , so that $\\bar{\\boldsymbol{p}}=(1-\\bar{\\boldsymbol{s}})\\boldsymbol{C}$ . In addition, $C-\\bar{p}<w^{*}$  \n\nNote that if $w\\ge C-\\bar{p}$ , then, after signing $\\left(\\Bar{p},\\Bar{s}\\right)$ , E can pay the cost $C$ and (9b) is satisfied. In addition, if $w\\le w^{*}$ , then (9c) is also satisfied because $\\mathrm{E}$ 's payoff from going solo is negative (see fig. 2). To summarize, if $w\\in[C-\\bar{p},w^{*}]$ , then $(\\bar{p},\\bar{s})$ satisfies (9a)-(9c) and, hence, $V(w)={\\overline{{V}}}$ . On the other hand, if $w\\notin[C-\\bar{p},w^{*}]$ , then either (9b) or (9c) is binding and, hence, $V(w)<\\overline{{V}}$  \n\nNext, we characterize the curve $V(w)$ on the rest of its domain. Define $w_{\\mathrm{min}}=\\operatorname*{inf}\\{w:V(w)>0\\}$ to be the lowest value of wealth for an E such that the VC can still make a nonnegative payoff.  \n\nLEMMA 5. The function $V$ is continuous. In addition,  \n\ni. $w_{\\mathrm{min}}=0$ or $V(w_{\\mathrm{min}})=0,$   \ni. $V$ is strictly increasing on $[w_{\\mathrm{min}},\\textit{C-}\\bar{p}]$ ，   \ni. $V\\equiv{\\overline{{V}}}$ on $[C-{\\bar{\\boldsymbol{p}}},{\\boldsymbol{w}}^{*}]$ ，   \niv. $V$ is strictly decreasing on $[w^{*},k/r+C]$ , and   \nV. $V(w)=0$ if $w\\ge k/r+C$  \n\nPart i identifies two cases that need to be considered, depending on the parameter values of the model. In the first case, the VC is able to make a positive profit by signing a contract with an E who is penniless $w_{\\mathrm{min}}=0$ ), and in the second case, a VC who contracts with an E with $w_{\\mathrm{min}}$ obtains a value of zero $\\begin{array}{r}{V(w_{\\mathrm{min}})=0}\\end{array}$ ). Figure 3 plots the function $V$ for the case $w_{\\mathrm{min}}>0$  \n\nWe are now ready to derive the relation between the equilibrium value ofafreeVC, $V^{*}$ , and the set of those Es who are VC-backed. If $V(w)>V^{*}$ an E with wealth $w$ is VC-backed, for otherwise a VC can offer a contract that is accepted by E and provides the VC with a value greater than $V^{*}$ The flip side is that if $V(w)<V^{*}$ , an E with wealth $w$ does not receive VC financing. To summarize, if $A$ is the set of VC-backed Es in equilibrium, then  \n\n![](images/eabcf576c39c80417c38e4e783ee714faa618d557830005299bff8dd1274ff83.jpg)  \nF1G. 3.—The function $V(w)$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\{w|w\\ge w_{\\mathrm{min}},V(w)>V^{*}\\}\\subset A\\subset\\{w|w\\ge w_{\\mathrm{min}},V(w)\\ge V^{*}\\}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFor each $V^{*}$ let $\\b{\\mathcal{A}}(\\b{V}^{*})$ denote the collection of those $A$ 's that satisfy (10). If $V\\in(0,{\\overline{{V}}})$ , the set of VC-backed Es is essentially uniquely determined because there are only two Es who are indifferent between getting VC financing and taking their outside options; see figure 3. The remaining cases, where $V^{*}$ is either zero or ${\\overline{{V}}}_{;}$ are stated in the following lemma.  \n\nLEMMA 6. (i) $A\\in{\\mathcal{A}}(0)$ if and only if $(w_{\\mathrm{min}},k/r+C)\\subset A\\subset[w_{\\mathrm{min}},\\infty)$ (i) $A\\in{\\mathcal{A}}({\\overline{{V}}})$ if and only if $A\\subset[C-{\\bar{p}},w^{*}]$  \n\n### IV. Equilibria and Welfare  \n\nThis section characterizes equilibria and establishes a version of the first welfare theorem, which holds when the number of VCs is either small or large.  \n\n#### A. Competitive Equilibria  \n\nWe show that there exists an equilibrium that is essentially unique; that is, each agent gets the same payoff across all equilibria. Recall that $x$ denotes the measure of VCs.  \n\nTHEOREM 1. For all $x\\in\\mathbb{R}_{+}$ , the value of a free VC, $V^{*}$ , is uniquely determined. In addition, there exist $\\underline{{x}},$ $\\bar{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\left(\\underline{{x}}<\\bar{x}\\right)$ such that  \n\ni. if $x\\leq\\underline{{x}},$ then $V^{*}={\\overline{{V}}}$ i. if $x\\in[\\underline{{x}},~\\bar{x}]$ , then $V^{*}\\in(0,{\\overline{{V}}})$ ; and ii. if $x\\geq{\\bar{x}}$ , then $V^{*}=0$  \n\nIn each case, the set of VC-backed Es satisfies (10), and the equilibrium contracts are described by lemma 3. The termination decisions are defined by (2), (4), and (7).  \n\nAs demonstrated in the previous section, $V^{*}$ determines the termination decisions and the equilibrium contracts. We have also shown that the set of VC-backed Es, $A$ , is an element of $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{A}}(\\boldsymbol{V}^{*})$ as it satisfies (10). In order to prove the theorem, we must explain how $V^{*}$ and $A$ are determined. To this end, we shall derive a market-clearing condition that requires the instantaneous measure of inflow of VCs to be the same as the outflow. We characterize both of these quantities as a function of $V^{*}$ and  \n\n$A$ . Finally, we show that this market-clearing condition has a unique solution for $V^{*}$  \n\nBefore proceeding, we first show that unless a free VC breaks even, he contracts with an E without delay. The reason is that if a VC waits after offering a contract, he could profitably deviate and avoid delay by offering a slightly larger up-front payment.  \n\nLEMMA 7. VCs do not wait in equilibrium unless $V^{*}=0$  \n\nMarket-clearing condition.—VCs leave the market only when they sign contracts with Es. Therefore, the measure of the outflow of VCs must equal the measure of VC-backed Es. Let $d_{\\Psi}$ denote the measure induced by the CDF $d_{\\Psi},^{12}$ so the measure of outflow of VCs is just $d_{\\Psi}({\\cal{A}})$  \n\nVCs reenter the market when they stop financing projects because of success or termination. The measure of inflow of free VCs is the total number of VCs who support a project at a given point in time divided by the average duration of a VC-backed project. By lemma 3 the expected duration of a VC-backed project conditional on $V^{*}$ and $A$ is defined by  \n\n$$\nt(V^{\\ast},A)=\\frac{\\displaystyle\\int_{A}\\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\operatorname*{min}(t,T(\\pi,s(w,V^{\\ast}),V^{\\ast}))f(t)d t d G(\\pi)d\\Psi(w)}{d_{\\Psi}(A)}.\n$$  \n\nHow many VCs support projects at a given moment? If $V^{*}>0$ , VCs do not wait (see lemma 7). Hence, the measure of the VCs financing a project is always $\\mathcal{X}$ and the inflow of free VCs is $x/t(V^{*},A)$ .If $V^{*}=0$ ,then VCs might wait in equilibrium, and all we can say is that the inflow of free VCs is at most $x/t(0,A)$ . To summarize, the market-clearing condition requires that there exists an $A\\in A(V^{*})$ such that  \n\n$$\nd_{\\Psi}(A)\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{{\\displaystyle\\le\\displaystyle\\frac{x}{t(0,A)}\\qquad\\mathrm{if}V^{\\ast}=0}}\\ {{\\displaystyle=\\displaystyle\\frac{x}{t(V^{\\ast},A)}\\qquad\\mathrm{if}V^{\\ast}\\in(0,\\overline{{{V}}}].}}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nExistence and uniqueness.—We show that there exists a unique $V^{*}$ that satisfies (12). Let $\\Gamma(V^{*},A)$ denote the numerator of the fraction on the right-hand side of (11), that is,  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle\\Gamma\\big(V^{*},A\\big)=\\int_{A}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\operatorname*{min}\\bigl(t,T\\bigl(\\pi,s\\bigl(w,V^{*}\\bigr),V^{*}\\bigr)\\bigr)}}\\ {{\\qquad\\times f\\bigl(t\\bigr)d t d G\\bigl(\\pi\\bigr)d\\Psi\\bigl(w\\bigr).}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$12$ Formally, $d_{\\Psi}(S)=\\int_{S}1d\\Psi$ for any measurable set $S$  \n\nBy (11), the market-clearing condition can be rewritten as  \n\n$$\n\\Gamma(V^{*},A)\\left\\{{\\begin{array}{l l}{\\leq x}&{{\\mathrm{if~}}V^{*}=0}\\ {}&{}\\ {=x}&{{\\mathrm{if~}}V^{*}\\in(0,{\\overline{{V}}}].}\\end{array}}\\right.\n$$  \n\nLemma 8 of online Appendix A establishes that as a correspondence of $V^{*}$ $\\left\\{\\Gamma(V^{*},A)|A\\in{\\mathcal{A}}(V^{*})\\right\\}$ looks as depicted in figure 4.  \n\nEquipped with figure 4, we are ready to make_an argument for the uniqueness of $V^{*}$ . Define $\\underline{x}$ and $\\bar{x}$ to be $\\Gamma(\\overline{{V}},[C-\\overline{{\\bar{p}}},w^{*}])$ and $\\Gamma(0,[w_{\\mathrm{min}},k/r+C])$ , respectively. If $x\\leq\\underline{x}$ , by (14) the equilibrium value of a VC must be $\\overrightharpoon{V}$ . This case corresponds to $x_{1}$ in figure 4. As a consequence, the intersection of $\\Gamma$ and the horizontal line determines $d_{\\Psi}(A)$ If $x\\in\\left(\\underline{{x}},\\bar{x}\\right)$ , the value of the VC lies in $(0,V^{*})$ (see, e.g., $x_{2}$ in fig. 4). In this case, both $V^{*}$ and $A$ are pinned down. If $x\\geq{\\bar{x}}$ , then $V^{*}=0$ .By (14), it is possible that $x$ is larger than $\\operatorname*{sup}_{V^{*},A\\in\\mathcal{A}(V^{*})}\\Gamma\\big(V^{*},A\\big)$ In this case, free VCs must wait to contract with Es; see $x_{3}$ in figure 4.  \n\nIndeterminacy.—If $V^{*}=0$ , VCs support each E with $w\\in(w_{\\mathrm{min}},k/r+C)$ as well as some unconstrained Es $(\\bar{w}>k/r+C)$ . While there are equilibria in which some VCs back some unconstrained Es, other equilibria exist in which the VCs wait and finance only constrained Es. Since $V^{*}=0$ and VCs do not add value to a project owned by an unconstrained E, both the VC and the unconstrained E will be indifferent between entering and not entering into a contractual relationship. If $V={\\overline{{V}}}$ ,VCs back only Es with $w\\in[C-\\bar{p},~w^{*}]$ . However, the inflow of free VCs is smaller than $\\psi([w^{*},~C-\\bar{p}])$ , and hence, we are unable to determine which of these Es are supported in equilibrium. Since all of the surplus goes to the VCs, these Es are all indifferent between receiving VC financing and abandoning their projects. In either case, the payoffs of all agents are the same across all of the equilibria.  \n\n![](images/1ba0be94903507c5f501eaa3ddbeccf7ddad81d9c0b324ef121c64ce2df5fa6b.jpg)  \nF1G. 4.—Market clearing  \n\n#### B.The Selection Mechanism  \n\nNote that the quality of a project does not directly depend on whether the VC is present. Rather, differences between the outcomes of VCbacked versus solo ventures stem from differences in financing decisions alone, that is, from agents’ equilibrium behavior. Next, we compare projects run by rich solo Es with those financed by VCs. Then we investigate how the wealth of a solo E affects her decisions.  \n\nSince the VC can always move on to a new company, looking after a nonperforming company entails a forgone-earnings cost that an E does not face. The impatient VC imposes a higher quality hurdle than a rich solo E does. In addition, the opportunity cost of the VCs induces earlier termination times of VC-backed firms than those of rich Es.  \n\nPROPOsITION 1. Suppose that $V^{*}>0$ . Then for all equilibrium shar ing rules $s^{*}$ (i) $\\pi_{\\mathrm{min}}^{s}<\\pi_{\\mathrm{min}}^{V C}\\left(V^{*},s^{*}\\right)$ and (i) $T^{\\nu c}(\\pi,s^{*},V^{*})<T^{s}(\\pi)$ whenever $T^{s}(\\pi)>0$  \n\nThis proposition has a strong implication for the expected profits of successful projects financed by VCs and rich solo Es. At any point in time, the threshold of a VC above which he is willing to support a project is higher than that of a rich solo E. As a consequence, the expected profit of a VC-backed project conditional on success is higher than that of a rich E. Remark 1 states this formally.  \n\nREMARK 1. If $V^{*}>0$ , then for all equilibrium sharing rules $s^{*}$ and for all $\\tau\\in\\mathbb{R}_{+}$ ，  \n\n$$\nE_{\\pi}(\\pi\\vert\\tau<T^{S}(\\pi))<E_{\\pi}(\\pi\\vert\\tau<T^{V C}(\\pi,s^{\\ast},V^{\\ast})).\n$$  \n\nAs we mentioned in the introduction, this inequality is consistent with data; successful VC-backed companies appear to be more profitable than others. We stress that, in our model, this arises solely from the termination decisions of the VCs due to their opportunity cost, $V^{*}$ , and not directly from their somehow improving the management or the marketing of the companies. Our selection mechanism also differs from a selection story in which a VC can select better projects in the first place. Our VCs have no superior information about $\\pi$ before they commit to financing a project.  \n\nWe turn our attention to the effect of the wealth of solo Es. A poor E who would run out of money before the optimal termination time is also more selective; knowing that she may run out of money, a poor E requires her project to be of sufficiently high quality in order to continue investing. Indeed, we can show that she generally will terminate her project earlier for any $\\pi$  \n\nPROPOSITION 2. (i) $\\pi_{\\mathrm{min}}^{s}(w)$ is decreasing in $w$ and constant on $[C+}$ $k/r,\\infty)$ .(i) $T_{w}^{S}(\\pi)$ is increasing in $\\boldsymbol{w}$ and constant on $[C+k/r,\\infty)$  \n\nThe net effect on terminations and expected profit conditional on success is thus ambiguous and depends on the distribution of wealth among the solo Es.  \n\n#### C. Welfare Analysis  \n\nWe now show that the competitive equilibrium is efficient if either the measure of VCs is small or it is large and a VC can profit from contracting with an E even if she has zero wealth.  \n\nTHEoREM 2 (The welfare theorem). The competitive equilibrium is socially optimal if either (i) $x\\geq{\\bar{x}}$ and $w_{\\mathrm{min}}=0$ Or (i) $x\\leq\\underline{x}$  \n\nSocial effciency.—-We next characterize the socially efficient allocations. Note that solo Es internalize both the benefits and the costs of their projects: Their decisions regarding their projects are socially optimal. Also note that socially optimal termination of a VC-backed project does not depend on E's wealth. Therefore, the efficient allocation can be described by the pair $\\left(A^{*},~T^{*}(\\cdot)\\right)$ where $A^{*}$ is the set of VC-backed Es and $T^{*}(\\pi)$ is the termination time of a VC-backed project with payoff $\\pi$  \n\nIf it is optimal to VC-back an $\\mathrm{E}$ who would otherwise go solo, then efficiency requires that every poorer E who is constrained should also be VC-backed. Formally,  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{sup}A^{*}>w^{*}\\Rightarrow\\left\\{w|0\\leq w\\leq\\operatorname*{min}\\left\\{\\operatorname*{sup}A^{*},C+k/r\\right\\}\\right\\}\\subset A^{*}.\n$$  \n\nWe next establish a relationship between $A^{*}$ and $T^{*}(\\cdot)$ . To this end, we first consider an efficient allocation and compute the social value generated by one additional VC. By (15), this marginal VC can be assumed to back the E with wealth $\\tilde{w}=\\operatorname*{sup}A^{*}$ . Let $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{q}}$ denote the expected surplus generated by this $\\mathrm{E}$ in the absence of VCs, that is, $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{q}}=$ $\\operatorname*{max}\\{0,-C+Q^{s}(\\tilde{w})\\}$ . The social value added by the marginal VC, $W,$ is determined by the following Bellman equation:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle{\\cal W}=-({\\cal C}+\\tilde{q})+\\operatorname*{max}_{T(\\pi),\\pi\\in\\mathbb{R}_{+}}\\int\\int_{0}^{T(\\pi)}\\biggl[\\pi+W-\\frac{a+h}{h(t)}\\biggr]e^{-\\kappa t}d F(t)}}\\ {{\\displaystyle~+~W e^{-r T(\\pi)}(1-F[T(\\pi)])d G(\\pi).}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe term $C+\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{q}}$ is the total initial social cost of the project backed by the marginal VC, $C$ is the physical cost, and $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{q}}$ is the opportunity cost. The rest of the expression corresponds to maximizing social surplus by choosing the optimal termination time given the continuation value $W.$ Equation (16) has a unique solution for $W.$ The reason is that the righthand side is (weakly) positive at $W=0$ since the project generates at least $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{q}}$ and is strictly smaller than $W$ if $W$ is large since $C+\\tilde{q}>0$ 13 In addition, its slope is strictly smaller than one by the envelope theorem. The existence of a unique solution then follows from the intermediate value theorem. The corresponding optimal termination time is defined by  \n\n$$\nT^{*}(\\pi,W)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{h^{-1}\\bigg(\\displaystyle\\frac{a+k+r W}{\\pi}\\bigg)}&{\\mathrm{if~}\\pi>\\pi_{\\mathrm{min}}(W)}\\ {0}&{\\mathrm{otherwise,}}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\pi_{\\mathrm{min}}(W)$ denotes the cutoff below which it is optimal to terminate immediately.  \n\nThe termination decisions determine the average duration of a VCbacked project $t^{*}(W)=E_{\\pi}[T^{*}(\\pi,W)]$ . As in (12), the following condition guarantees that the inflow and outflow of VCs are equal:  \n\n$$\nd_{\\Psi}(A^{*})\\left\\{{\\begin{array}{l l}{\\displaystyle\\leq{\\frac{x}{t(W)}}{\\mathrm{if}}W=0}\\ {\\displaystyle={\\frac{x}{t(W)}}{\\mathrm{if}}W\\geq0.}\\end{array}}\\right.\n$$  \n\nTo summarize, the pair $\\left(A^{*},~T^{*}(\\cdot)\\right)$ defines a socially efficient allocation if (i) (15) holds, (ii) $T^{*}(\\pi)=T^{*}(\\pi,W)$ , and (ii) (18) is satisfied with $W$ defined by (16). The argument showing that these conditions are also sufficient and that the efficient allocation is essentially unique is similar to the proof of theorem 1, and hence, it is omitted.  \n\nThe proof of the welfare theorem.—-We show that if either $x\\leq\\underline{{x}}$ or $x\\geq{\\bar{x}}$ and $w_{\\mathrm{min}}=0$ , the equilibrium set of VC-backed Es, $A$ , and termination times define an efficient allocation.  \n\nCase i: $x\\geq{\\bar{x}}$ and $w_{\\mathrm{min}}=0$ . Theorem 1 and lemma 6 imply that $V^{*}=0$ and $[0,~k/r+C]\\subset A$ In addition, $w_{\\mathrm{min}}=0$ and lemma 3 imply that each equilibrium contract specifies $s=a/(a+k)$ , and hence, the termination decisions are $T(\\cdot,a/(a+k),0$ ) defined by (7). We show that the pair $(A,T(\\cdot,a/(a+k),0))$ defines an efficient allocation.  \n\nSince every financially constrained E is VC-backed in equilibrium, (15) is satisfied. The marginal VC finances an E who is financially unconstrained, so the surplus generated by the poorest VC-backed E is $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{q}}=$ $Q^{s}(k/r+C)-C$ . Therefore, (16) implies $W=0$ and can be written as  \n\n$$\nQ^{s}(k/r+C)=\\operatorname*{max}_{T(\\cdot)}\\int\\int_{0}^{T(\\pi)}\\left[\\pi+\\frac{a+k}{h(t)}\\right]e^{-r t}d F(t)+d G(\\pi),\n$$  \n\nwhich is just the surplus of an unconstrained solo E. In particular, the efficient termination time(17) with $W=0$ is just the unconstrained E's termination time as defined by (2). Therefore, by (2) and (7), $T(\\pi,a/(a+k),0)=T^{*}(\\pi,0)$ Finally, note that (12) and (18) coincide.  \n\nCase ii: $x\\leq\\underline{{x}}$ . Theorem 1 and lemma 6 imply that $V^{*}={\\overline{{V}}}$ and $A\\subset$ $[w^{*},k/r+C]$ . The equilibrium contract in this case is $({\\bar{s}},{\\bar{p}})$ defined by lemma 4. We show that the pair $(A,T(\\cdot,{\\bar{s}},{\\overline{{V}}}))$ determines a socially optimal outcome.  \n\nSince only those Es who would not otherwise go solo are VC-backed, $\\operatorname{sup}A\\leq w^{*}$ and, hence, $A$ satisfies (15). In this case, the VCs capture all the surplus generated by VC-backed projects. Therefore, the VC's equilibrium value can be written as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle\\overline{{V}}=-C+\\operatorname*{max}_{T(\\pi),\\pi\\in\\mathbb{R}_{+}}\\int_{0}^{T(\\pi)}\\left[\\pi+\\overline{{V}}-\\frac{a+h}{h(t)}\\right]e^{-r t}d F(t)}\\ {\\displaystyle+\\overline{{V}}e^{-r T(\\pi)}(1-F[T(\\pi)])d G(\\pi).}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe marginal VC finances an $\\mathrm{E}$ who would otherwise invest his wealth in a bank, so $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{q}}=0$ This implies that the previous equation is simply (16). Therefore, $W={\\overline{{V}}}$ and $T(\\pi,{\\bar{s}},{\\overline{{V}}})=T^{*}(\\pi,{\\overline{{V}}})$ . Finally, (12) and (18) are identical.  \n\n#### D. Discussion of the Welfare Theorem  \n\nWe assumed throughout that $\\pi$ is the social value of a project. However, our analysis of competitive equilibria goes through even if $\\pi$ doesnot equal the social value. For example, implementing more projects might result in technological spillovers, which, in turn, can generate economic growth. We return to this issue in Section V.B. In the presence of such externalities, the welfare and policy implications of our model are different. However, even if the social and private values of a project differ, theorem 2 still justifies the use of simple equity contracts for cases i and i of this theorem. In case i, Es capture all the surplus from the projects and $V^{*}=0$ . Therefore, any contract that would generate a strictly positive payoff to a VC would be rejected by Es. In particular, a VC cannot deviate profitably by offering a more complicated contract even if such a contract is available. In case i, the VC captures all the surplus from the projects and Es break even. Again, the VC has no incentive to adopt a different contract.  \n\nThe validity of the first welfare theorem might seem surprising in our setting for two reasons. First, agency problems could arise because neither the VC's investment nor the E's effort is contractible. Second, agents are not price takers: VCs are strategic when offering contracts. We next explain why, despite these issues, the competitive equilibrium is efficient in the environments described in theorem 2. In particular, we argue that the contractibility of the sharing rule eliminates the agency problem and that the VCs are able to internalize their social value.  \n\nIntuition for the equilibrium contract.—The VC and E must both want to support the project until the socially optimal termination time and no longer. Recall that, in the environment of theorem 2, $V^{*}=W,$ and the equilibrium sharing rule is given by $\\boldsymbol{s}=\\boldsymbol{a}/(a+k+r W)$ . We argue that the sharing rule $s$ provides the right incentives for both agents because the marginal cost of a VC-backed project is shared correctly between the VC and E. The VC invests $k$ and incurs an opportunity cost of $r W,$ while E exerts effort $a$ . Then E cares only about her own cost, $a$ , and not the social cost $a+k+r W$ . However, if $s=a/(a+k+r W)$ , then E's benefit is $[a/(a+k+r W)]\\pi$ instead of the social benefit $\\pi$ . This means that the objective function of E is equal to the objective function of the social planner scaled down by the constant $a/(a+k+r W)$ . Similarly, the objective function of the VC is scaled down by $(k+r W)/~(a+k+r W)$ Scaling does not actually affect decisions, so the VC and E both choose the same $T$ that the planner would. Therefore, our model provides an explanation for why we observe equity contracts between VCs and Es, and not, for example, debt or labor contracts.  \n\nThe VC's market value.—We have shown that when the competitive outcome is efficient, the social value of a VC coincides with his market value: $V^{*}=W$ . In general, if $x\\in(\\underline{{x}},~\\bar{x})$ , the social value of the marginal VC exceeds his market value. A VC could increase the social surplus by financing those Es who invest with a bank. Unfortunately, the VCs cannot extract the full social surplus from poor Es because they are unable to compensate the VCs up front for long-lasting project support. If it were possible to write more complicated contracts, the equilibrium allocation would be efficient for a larger set of parameters. In particular, the VCs would be able to extract sufficient surplus from liquidityconstrained Es if the sharing rule s could increase over time. Recall that we have restricted attention to time-independent sharing rules, and hence the E is indifferent between exerting effort and shirking at the time of termination but strictly prefers to exert effort at every earlier point in time. If $s$ were permitted to vary over time, it would be possible to make E indifferent between working and shirking prior to project termination, and such contracts would allow surplus to be extracted from poorer Es without violating incentive constraints.  \n\n### V. Fitting Data  \n\nWe now fit the model to data on VC-backed projects. We have two goals. The first is to learn what features of the data the model explains; the second is to infer the returns to VCs and to solo Es.  \n\nIn this section, we assume that case i of theorem 1 holds, that is, that $x\\leq\\underline{{x}}$ . so that the VC is in short supply and so that his payoff is ${\\overline{{V}}},$ as shown in figure 3.14 This simplifies things greatly because the decisions regarding VC-backed projects then do not depend on Es’ wealth distribution. Moreover, the assumption on the scarcity of the VCs is probably appropriate for the vintages 1989-93 of funds that our data cover. On these vintages, VCs as well as the LPs of private equity funds received above-average returns, as table 3 below shows. Online Appendix E argues that if the parameter $x$ was estimated as part of a larger model, the constraint $x\\leq\\underline{{x}}$ would be satisfied.  \n\nNext, we define precisely those objects of our model that we intend to fit to the corresponding features of the data. After that, we describe the data and then discuss the simulations.  \n\nThe distribution of successful-exit payoffs, $\\Gamma_{t}(\\pi)$ .—Let $\\hat{\\tau}>\\tau_{m}$ denote the age at which $h(t)=(a+k+r V)/\\pi_{\\operatorname*{min}}^{V C}$ For $t\\in(0,\\hat{\\tau})$ no project is terminated, and successes come from the same truncated distribution $G(\\pi|\\pi\\ge\\pi_{\\operatorname*{min}}^{V C})$ At $t=\\hat{\\tau}$ the truncation point for $\\pi$ namely $(a+k+$ $r V)/h(t)$ , starts to rise. The distribution of $\\pi$ among projects that bear fruit at date $t$ is  \n\n$$\n\\Gamma_{t}(\\pi)\\equiv\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{{\\displaystyle G(\\pi|\\pi\\ge\\pi_{\\mathrm{min}}^{\\cal V C})}}&{{\\mathrm{for}t<\\hat{\\tau}}}\\ {{\\displaystyle G\\bigg(\\pi|\\pi\\ge\\frac{a+k+r V}{h(t)}\\bigg)}}&{{\\mathrm{for}t\\ge\\hat{\\tau}.}}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nThe probability, $\\Phi(t)$ , that a nonperforming project is terminated by age $t$ 一 Conditional on no success, a project is terminated before age $t$ if $\\pi$ falls below the VC's reservation quality before $t$ Define  \n\n$$\n\\Phi(t)\\equiv\\operatorname*{Pr}(T\\leq t|\\tau\\geq t).\n$$  \n\nLemma 2 states that project $\\pi$ is terminated either at once or at date $T\\geq\\tau_{m}$ satisfying (8).Thus $\\Phi(t)$ jumps immediately from zero to $G(\\pi_{\\operatorname*{min}}^{V C})$ ， remains there until $t=\\hat{\\tau}\\equiv h^{-1}((a+k+r V)/\\pi_{\\mathrm{min}}^{V C})$ , and then rises again.  \n\nThe survivor function, $S(t)$ .—A project “survives\" through date $t$ if it has neither succeeded $(\\tau>t)$ nor terminated $(T(\\pi)>t)$ . Since $\\tau$ and $\\pi$ are independent, the fraction surviving is  \n\n$$\nS(t)=(1-F[t])(1-\\Phi[t])=\\exp\\biggl\\{-\\int_{0}^{t}[h(s)+\\psi(s)]d s\\biggr\\},\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\psi(t)={\\frac{\\Phi^{\\prime}(t)}{1-\\Phi(t)}}\n$$  \n\nis the termination hazard. Thus $h$ and $\\psi$ are  competing hazards: $-S^{\\prime}(t)/S(t)=h(t)+\\psi(t)$  \n\nThe J curve, $J(t)$ .—The term is often used to describe the cumulative net income of a venture fund as it ages, according to Wikipedia. For us, in contrast, the $J$ curve is the expected cumulative net revenue of a representative company. If all the portfolio firms of a fund were to start at the inception of the fund, the two concepts would be the same. Expected investment at age $t$ is $k S(t)$ , and successes occur at the rate $f({\\bar{t}})=h(t)S(t)$ .Then $J$ solves the ordinary differential equation (ODE)  \n\n$$\nJ^{\\prime}(t)=\\biggl[-k+h(t)(1-s)\\int\\pi d\\Gamma_{t}(\\pi)\\biggr]S(t),\n$$  \n\nwith the initial condition $J(0)=-\\boldsymbol{p}$  \n\nThe VC's excess return $\\alpha^{V C}$ .We define the excess return of the VC, $\\alpha^{V C},$ as the difference between the internal rate of return (IRR) on the flow of expected profits and the rate of discount $r$ Thus $\\alpha^{V C}$ is the solution for $\\alpha$ to the equation  \n\n$$\n0=-\\boldsymbol{p}+\\int_{0}^{12}e^{-(r+\\alpha)t}\\boldsymbol{J}^{\\prime}(t)d t.\n$$  \n\nThe funds our data cover do not extend beyond year 12; if the VC receives net revenues after the fund closes, then $\\alpha^{V C}$ is an underestimate but not a large underestimate because the years 13 and beyond are heavily discounted.  \n\nThe soloE's excessreturn $\\alpha^{s}(w)$ .—The model allows us to calculate the returns of solo Es by estimating the parameters exclusively from the data on VC-backed projects. The solo E's excess return, $\\alpha^{s}(w)$ , depends on E's wealth, w. It is calculated in the same way as $\\alpha^{V C}$ , but with the following changes in (22): (i) a solo E must pay $C$ up front instead of just $\\boldsymbol{p}$ , (ii) in the event of success she receives the entire $\\pi$ , and (i) she may run out of money, which effectively lowers $h(t)S(t)$ . See equations (C8)-(C12) in online Appendix C for details.  \n\nParameterization.—We use the following functional forms for $G$ and $F$  \n\n$$\nG(\\pi)=1-{\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{\\pi_{0}}\\right)}^{-\\lambda},\\pi\\geq\\pi_{0},\\lambda>1,\n$$  \n\n$$\nF(\\tau)=\\frac{\\rho}{2+\\rho}\\left[\\frac{\\operatorname*{min}(\\tau,\\tau_{m})}{\\tau_{m}}\\right]^{2}+\\frac{2}{2+\\rho}\\sqrt{1-\\left[\\frac{\\operatorname*{max}(\\tau,\\tau_{m})}{\\tau_{m}}\\right]^{-\\rho}}\\right\\}.\n$$  \n\nThus $\\pi$ has a Pareto distribution with mean $\\lambda/(\\lambda-1)\\pi_{0}$ . The hazard $h(\\tau)$ rises up to a peak at $\\tau_{m}$ , beyond which it declines. Then (C7), (24), and (25) imply the following proposition.  \n\nPROPOSITION 3. For $t\\geq\\hat{\\tau}$ (i) $h(t)=\\rho/t$ (i) $\\psi(t)=\\lambda/t$ , and (ii)  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{Pr}({\\mathrm{succ}}|{\\mathrm{exit}})={\\frac{h(t)}{h(t)+\\psi(t)}}={\\frac{\\rho}{\\rho+\\uplambda}}.\n$$  \n\nData.—The data come from the VentureXpert database provided by Thompson Venture Economics, covering VC investments in 1,355 US companies. VC investments in these companies start between 1989 and 1993 and extend to 2001, when our sample ends. Guler (2003, 2007) and Jovanovic and Szentes (2007) analyzed this sample; from it we drop 403 firms with incoherent information, reducing the total number to 952. Of these, 27 percent had an IPO and 17 percent were sold privately. The remaining 56 percent generated no revenue; for them we assumed that a firm was “terminated\" a year after its last recorded investment. Panels 1-6 of figure 5 plot the data. Depending on their vintage, we lose coverage of firms with ages between 9 and 12. Appendix B details the procedures we followed.  \n\nBefore we proceed, one feature of the model needs to be changed. Because a perfect signal on $\\pi$ arrives at once, the VC terminates immediately all projects for which $\\pi\\leq\\pi_{\\operatorname*{min}}^{V C}$ and then does not terminate any more until date $\\hat{\\tau}>\\tau_{m}$ .Then (21） states that $S$ exhibits a downward jump at $t=0$ , and (19) states that $\\Gamma_{t}(\\pi)$ is fixed for $t\\in(0,\\hat{\\tau})$ , so its mean is $E(\\pi|\\mathrm{VC}$ success). Neither property is in the data, and we shall therefore assume that learning $\\pi$ takes time.  \n\n![](images/62d78ba672364f3d3dc744f52e84de60d4b62567355cecbfa67b7fb0aa123fb1.jpg)  \nF1G. 5.—Simulation 1  \n\nIntroduction of a delayed signal on $\\pi$ .—-We assume that there is a random delay for both parties to simultaneously learn $\\pi$ . As a result, every project is now supported for a positive length of time, $T_{0}$ , if no signal arrives. If the signal arrives at date $t<T_{0}$ , the reservation qualities are denoted by $\\pi_{\\mathrm{min}}^{V C}\\left(t\\right)$ and $\\pi_{\\mathrm{min}}^{s}(t)$ for VC-backed and solo projects. The flow of terminations is now positive for all $t\\leq T_{0}$ . This extension does not affect our theoretical results, and our welfare theorem still holds. The characterization of the optimal termination decisions is in Appendix A, where we define $B(t)$ to be the probability that $\\pi$ is learned before $t.$ For the simulations we assume that  \n\n$$\nB(t)=1-e^{-\\delta t},\\quad t\\geq0.\n$$  \n\nParameter choices.—The rate of discount, $r,$ was chosen on the basis of evidence on the required real rate of return on investments with characteristics similar to those in our sample. We use the standard assetpricing relation  \n\n$$\nr\\equiv r_{f}+\\beta_{V C}(r_{m}-r_{f}).\n$$  \n\nThe risk-free rate $r_{f}=0.026$ was set at the mean annualized real return on 3-month Treasury bills from 1980 to 1999, which is the sample period for Jones and Rhodes-Kropf's (2004) data on returns of VC and buyout funds. The market return $r_{m}=0.082$ was set at the mean of the return on a value-weighted portfolio of stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, and NASDAQ provided by the Center for Research in Security Prices over the same period. The value $\\beta_{\\scriptscriptstyle{V C}}=1.80$ is the covariance with systematic market risk calculated as the sum of the five quarterly $\\beta$ coefficients in Jones and RhodesKropf's table 1, panel B. Equation (28) then yields $r=0.127$ , the predicted cost of funds for both the VC and the solo E.15  \n\nThe remaining eight parameters $(\\pi_{0},C,k,a,\\uplambda,\\delta,\\rho,$ and $\\tau_{m}$ ) were chosen to fit the data plotted in the first six panels of figure 5, namely, the distributions of revenues and costs, the success and termination hazards as a function of age, and the relation between a firm's age and its cumulative net revenue flow. We did three simulations. The baseline, $\\mathrm{Sim~1}$ ， produced the best overall fit with the parameters, shown in the top row of table 1, and the results are plotted in figure 5. Sim 2 raises 入, making thinner the right tail of the distribution of $\\pi$ s and lowering their mean, but compensates for this by raising the speed of detection, 0, and lowering the up-front cost C. Sim 3 uses parameters that lead to a lower $\\alpha^{V C}$ Appendix D reports plots and further discussion of the simulations.  \n\nThe last seven columns of table 1 list estimates of endogenous variables: $\\alpha^{V C}$ and $\\alpha^{s}(w)$ were defined above; $\\begin{array}{r}{\\alpha^{\\mathrm{rich}}\\equiv\\operatorname*{lim}_{w\\rightarrow\\infty}\\alpha^{S}(w)}\\end{array}$ is the predicted excess return of a rich solo E; $V$ is the lifetime value of a VC; $\\sigma\\equiv Q^{s}-C$ is the lifetime value of a project to a rich solo E (see fig. 2); $s$ is $\\mathrm{E}$ 's equity share in the contract; $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is the VC's up-front payment; and  \n\nTABLE1PARAMETERS AND OUTCOMES  \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"10\">PARAMETER VALUES</td><td colspan=\"7\">OUTCOMES</td></tr><tr><td>SIMULATION</td><td>r</td><td>To</td><td>C</td><td>k</td><td>D</td><td></td><td>入</td><td>p</td><td></td><td>Tm</td><td>&VC (%)</td><td>qrich α (%)</td><td>A</td><td></td><td>S</td><td>p</td><td>To</td></tr><tr><td>Sim 1</td><td>12.7</td><td>75</td><td></td><td>6.933.6</td><td></td><td></td><td>1.55</td><td></td><td>6.2.87.5</td><td></td><td>8.6</td><td>3.4</td><td>20</td><td>8.5.40</td><td></td><td>4.8</td><td>15.1</td></tr><tr><td>Sim2</td><td></td><td></td><td>3.6</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1.73</td><td>3.4</td><td></td><td></td><td>7.7</td><td>3.1</td><td>16</td><td></td><td>5.4.42</td><td>2.4</td><td>13.9</td></tr><tr><td>Sim3</td><td></td><td></td><td>12.6</td><td></td><td></td><td>1.6</td><td></td><td>.3</td><td></td><td></td><td>1.8</td><td>.7</td><td>5</td><td>51.0.50</td><td></td><td>7.3</td><td>14.4</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n$T_{0}$ is the age at which the VC terminates a project on which no signal has come in. How should Vrelate to $\\sigma?$ A rough guess would go as follows: if a VC could dispose of each company at around the modal success age $\\tau_{m}=7.5$ and if he followed the same termination policy as the rich solo E, the VC would have a lifetime value of $\\sigma/(1-e^{-r\\tau_{m}})=1.63\\sigma$ . In fact, the VC can (and does) do better than this in that the ratio $V/\\sigma$ ranges between 2.4 in Sim 1 and 5 in Sim 3.  \n\n#### A. Model Fit  \n\nIn figure 5 the solid lines depict the expected values of the variables that the model generates for $\\mathrm{Sim1}$  \n\nPanel 1: The distribution of $\\pi$ Panel 1 plots the distribution of exit values (the counterpart of the $\\pi$ 's) measured in millions of 2001 dollars. They are observed only for successes. The solid distribution is a weighted average of the distributions $\\Gamma_{t}(\\pi)$ given in (19) for the case $\\delta=\\infty$ ，but the plot is for $\\delta=0.2.^{16}$ Then each $\\Gamma_{t}$ is a weighted average of screened and unscreened projects; see equation (C1). The model understates the predicted dispersion of $\\pi$ , but this is easily remedied if instead of a perfect signal the parties were to receive an unbiased noisy signal of $\\pi$ The distribution of realized $\\pi$ 's would then be a mean-preserving spread of the solid distribution. Since the VC and E are risk neutral, their optimal termination and effort decisions would not change and, as a result, neither would panels 2-10.  \n\nPanel 2: Investment-cost profile.—The VC invests $k$ in every period except the first, when he invests $k+p$ ,where $\\mathbf{\\nabla}_{\\boldsymbol{p}}=(1-s)\\mathbf{\\nabla}_{\\boldsymbol{C}}$ by lemma 4. The value $s=0.40$ matches Kaplan and Stromberg's (2003, table 2) evidence; they report that pooled over rounds, the claim of founders is 31.1 percent, of VCs 46.7 percent, and of non-VC investors 22.2 percent, which suggests $s{\\approx}31.1/(31.1+46.7)=0.40$ . These estimates imply that the VC finances 60 percent of $C$ and receives 60 percent of the equity.  \n\nTABLE 2 EQUATION (26) (ii) AND (ii) EVALUATED AT $t=12$   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">入 = 1.55 SIM 1</td><td colspan=\"2\">入 = 1.73 S1M 2</td><td colspan=\"2\">入 = 1.6 S1M 3</td></tr><tr><td>=8</td><td>8 =.2</td><td>=8</td><td>8 =.4</td><td>=8</td><td>6 =.3</td></tr><tr><td>(12)=入/12</td><td>.13</td><td>.08</td><td>.14</td><td>.06</td><td>.13</td><td>.07</td></tr><tr><td>P(succlexit) = p/(o + 入)</td><td>.34</td><td>.43</td><td>.32</td><td>.52</td><td>.33</td><td>.49</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nPanel 3: The $J$ curve.—The intercepts of the curves in panels 2 and 3 both depend on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ $\\mathrm{Sim1}$ fits the $J$ curve well, except in periods 10-12, which are heavily discounted. $\\mathrm{Sim~2}$ and especially $\\mathrm{Sim3}$ underpredict the $J$ curve and imply values of $\\alpha^{V C}$ far below what one would expect on the basis of the private-equity returns that we report in table 3 below.  \n\nPanels 4, 6, and 8: The hazards.—Panel 4 plots the success hazard $h(t)$ Panels 6 and 8 plot the simulated finite-8 counterparts of the expressions in parts ii and i of proposition 3. Table 2 compares the finite-8 simulations to the $\\delta=\\infty$ case that the proposition covers. Panels 6 and 8 indicate on their vertical right axes the $\\delta=\\infty$ values of $\\psi(12)$ and $\\operatorname*{Pr}(\\operatorname{succ}|$ exit), respectively. As $t$ grows, all three simulations show a slow convergence of $\\psi(t)$ and $\\operatorname*{Pr}(\\operatorname{succ}|\\operatorname{exit})$ toward these values. Since $\\delta$ is twice as high in Sim 2, $\\operatorname*{Pr}(\\operatorname{succ}|\\operatorname{exit})$ is larger.  \n\nPanel 5: Survivorship.—The dashed line plots the number that survived up to the beginning of year $t.$ The predicted S dips below the actual survivals immediately. As panel 6 also shows, the model implies too many early terminations early on: The signal on $\\pi$ arrives too early, leading to an early removal of the low- $\\pi$ projects. The fit would improve if, instead of 8 being constant, it had an inverted-U shape, similar to that of $h(t)$ .17 The data also show fewer terminations at the high ages than the model generates, but of the 28 percent of companies we infer are “alive\" at age 12, many may in fact be defunct (Ruhnka, Feldman, and Dean 1992). Indeed, panel 2 shows investment dropping off sharply in companies that are 10 years and older, suggesting that undetected terminations have taken place by then.  \n\nPanel 7: Project selectivity of VCs and Es.—Since $h$ is inverted-V-shaped, $\\pi_{\\mathrm{min}}^{V C}\\left(t\\right)$ and $\\pi_{\\mathrm{min}}^{s}(t)$ (the reservation quality of the rich solo Es who receive information at $t$ )are both V-shaped. The curve $E(\\pi|\\mathrm{VC}$ success at $t$ starts from its unconditional mean $\\pi_{0}\\Lambda/(\\Lambda-1)$ and then rises as low $\\pi$ are gradually terminated. The differential selectivity of VCs and Es raises the IPO values and termination rates of VC-backed firms above those of rich solo Es and explains why VC-backed companies are worth more at IPO (Megginson and Weiss 1991; Hochberg 2012). However, the implications are reversed for poor Es who run out of money before $\\tau_{m}$ (when the chances of success are highest) and who, as a result, are more selective. Panel 7 considers a solo E with $w=11.6$ who, according to (1), would run out of money at $t=1.7$ and shows her reservation $\\pi$ to be far above ${\\pi}_{\\operatorname*{min}}^{V C}$ . The poor E is extremely selective because she must gamble on an early success, which, given the shape of $h(t)$ , is an unlikely event. Equations (C3), (C4), and (C8) show how $\\pi_{\\mathrm{min}}^{V C}\\left(t\\right)$ and $\\pi_{\\mathrm{min}}^{s}(w)$ are calculated.  \n\nTABLE3 REAL IRR TO LIMITED PARTNERS BY FUND VINTAGE   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"4\">VINTAGE YEARS</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1986-88</td><td>1989-93</td><td>1994-2000</td><td>2001-8</td></tr><tr><td>IRR</td><td>11.7</td><td>22.4</td><td>12.0</td><td>13.6</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nPanel 9: Es’ occupation choice.—This panel is the simulated version of figure 2. The net value of going solo is the difference between the curve and the 45-degree line in panel 9 and in figure 2 above. See equations (C10)-(C12) for details on $Q^{s}(w)$ . The critical wealth level $C+k/r$ is the minimal w a solo E needs to support the project forever if she wishes to.  \n\nPanel 10: Excess returns of VCs and solo $E s$ —Panel 10 shows that $\\alpha^{s}(w)$ is substantially below $\\alpha^{V C}$ but positive and rising to 3.5 percent. The estimate $\\alpha^{V C}=8.6$ percent may seem high, yet it is less than what the fundlevel returns data imply as we shall now show. Since a VC supplies both his skill and his money, $r+\\alpha^{V C}$ is comparable to combined returns to all the partners of a venture fund. Our data are on portfolio firms in funds of vintage 1989-93; a summary of returns to LPs of private equity is in table 3.18 The IRR in the table is the return that the LPs receive after the GPs have taken roughly 2 percent overhead and 20 percent of any profits on the LPs' investment. Hence the reported IRR is conceptually at least 2 percent below what we call $r+\\alpha^{V C}$ . Our estimate of $r+\\alpha^{V C}$ ， $12.7+8.6=21.3$ percent, is 3 percentage points lower than the returns one would expect to find on the basis of the 22.4 percent return that accrued to the LPs of the funds of 1989-93 vintage. A similar pattern for IRRs by vintage is reported in table 2 of Hochberg et al. (forthcoming); their IRRs are lower and more in line with our estimates of $r+\\alpha^{V C}$  \n\nThe returns are vintage specific: The stock market was unusually high in the late 1990s, just as these projects were maturing, and the table indicates that lower $\\alpha$ 's obtained for other vintages of companies. For other vintages of funds, scarcity of projects and not VCs may be the appropriate assumption. In the extreme case in which VCs are in infinitely elastic supply, E would get all the rents and $\\alpha^{V C}=0$ .Appendix E discusses in more detail the consequences of relaxing the VC-scarcity assumption.  \n\nTheestimate $0\\le\\alpha^{s}(w)\\le3.5$ percent is high compared to negative $\\alpha$ 's reported by Moskowitz and Vissing-Jorgensen (2002) for the selfemployed and by Astebro (2003) for independent inventors. Vereshchagina and Hopenhayn (2009) argue, however, that estimated returns rise when one factors in the options entrepreneurs can turn to if they fail.  \n\n#### B.Discussion of the Results  \n\nThe role of the VC.—-In the model, a VC does not raise value directly as an input in production or management. Rather, he acts as lender as well as overseer and screener of projects. Thus $V$ is the private lifetime value per venture company derived by the VCs and the LPs of a fund combined. Since a VC supplies both his skill and his money, a “limited supply of VCs” could reflect a shortage of human capital or a shortage of liquidity. Since venture funds are usually oversubscribed, the binding constraint may indeed be VCs' human capital, and not liquidity.  \n\nPrivate versus social returns.—Our estimates of $\\alpha^{V C}$ and $\\alpha^{S}$ are excess private returns; they are based on the $\\pi$ 's, which are private values. A private value can exceed the social value if the project takes rents away from other projects, and it can be less than the social value if the project bestows knowledge externalities on others.  \n\nScale effects.—We have omitted explanatory variables that could help improve the fit. For example, companies in the pharmaceutical industry make larger investments $(a,k,C)$ , they face longer delays (higher $\\tau_{m}$ and they receive higher payoffs $\\pi$ . Moreover, the form of the optimal contracts would also depend on all ex ante available information about the project's fundamentals. On the other hand, such differences create a sorting motive: A poor E could choose a project with low $C_{s}$ thereby reducing ex post inefficiency, because to compensate the VC, she might not then need to settle for an inefficiently low equity share $S,$  \n\nAggregate shocks and expectations.—Aggregate exit values fluctuate, as table 3 shows, and the changes are not perfectly foreseen. Our methodology assumes away aggregate risk and time effects: The joint population distribution of the pair $(\\pi,\\tau)$ realized ex post is the same that agents expected ex ante. Since many of our companies matured during the stock market boom, we have implicitly assumed that VCs and Es alike expected the boom to occur. If the boom was in fact a surprise, more terminations would have been optimal for low ages than our model generates.  \n\nOther functional forms.—The Pareto form of $G$ in (24) leads to analytic simplification such as equation (26), but its thick left tail causes too many terminations. A more flexibly parameterized $G(\\pi)$ and $k(t)$ would fit better. Also, “lemons ripen faster than cherries\" (Lerner 1998); in other words, bad projects are perhaps revealed earlier than good projects, so that $\\pi$ and the signal-arrival age may be negatively correlated.  \n\n## VI. Conclusion  \n\nWe modeled the market for venture capital in which VCs play a lending and monitoring role and in which they do not directly add value to projects they finance. For a wide range of distributions of project quality and wealth on the one hand and for a wide range of VC supply on the other, the model says that contracts should entail a fixed sharing rule and an up-front payment.  \n\nAlso, we fit an equilibrium model to the data, a rare event in the corporate finance literature. The exercise is quantitative: it goes beyond a qualitative test of a model's comparative statics properties by means of regressions. We showed how the returns to venture capital and VC termination behavior depend on the distribution of project qualities, on the distribution of waiting times for the projects to mature, and on the scarcity of VCs.  \n\n## References  \n\nAstebro, Thomas. 2003. “The Return to Independent Invention: Evidence of Unrealistic Optimism, Risk Seeking or Skewness Loving?” Econ.

Introduction.  \n\nThere is a large academic literature in financial contracting theory. The papers in this literature often begin with a situation in which an investor negotiates with an entrepreneur over the financing of a project or company. These theoretical papers typically make a number of different assumptions concerning the nature of these negotiations. These assumptions concern observability of actions, contractibility of actions, the ability to renegotiate, and the nature of information and uncertainty. Given the assumptions and the models, the papers then generate predictions. For example, a key assumption in Hart and Moore (1998) is that firm output is observable by outsiders, but not verifiable. As a result, it is not possible to write contracts on Output.  \n\nDespite the large volume of theory, relatively little empirical work exists that compares the characteristics of real world financial contracts to their counterparts in financial contracting theory.  In this paper, we attempt to inform theory by conducting a detailed study of actual contracts between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. Venture capitalists (VCs) are real world entities who most closely approximate the investors of theory. VCs have strong incentives to maximize value, but, at the same time, receive few or no private benefits of control. In describing these contracts, we consider the appropriateness of different assumptions and predictions in financial contracting theory.  \n\nIn this paper, we study detailed information on 200 venture capital investments in 118 portfolio companies by fourteen venture capital firms. For each portfolio company investment, the VC firm provided the contractual agreements governing each financing round in which the firm participated. The VC firm also provided (if available) the company's business plan, internal analyses evaluating the investment, and information on subsequent performance.  \n\nWe describe the contracts between the portfolio companies / entrepreneurs and the VCs in great detail. We then consider how well these contracts are described by the assumptions and predictions embodied in five different types of financial contracting theories. The theories interpret financial contracts as the solution to conflicts of interest or agency problems between investors and the entrepreneur.? A conflict exists because the entrepreneur must transfer a portion of the profits generated by the project back to external investors in return for their financing. The entrepreneur will not take the optimal action because he does not get all the monetary benefits from taking that action, while alternative actions give other benefits to the entrepreneur. The different financial contracting theories assume different types of conflicts of interest in choice of actions. These include: (1) not exerting the optimal amount of costly effort; (2) taking actions that yield private benefits rather than monetary benefits; (3) spending resources on perks or stealing; (4) holding up investors by threatening to leave the project.  \n\nThe traditional principal-agency approach, pioneered by Holmstrom (1979), assumes tha the agent's effort is unobservable to the principal. The optimal incentive contract ensures that the agent puts in enough effort by making the agent's compensation dependent on the outcome of the signals. In the context of a financing problem, the signal is typically output or profits. Harris and Raviv (1979) show that with a risk-neutral principal and agent, and no wealth constraints, the optimal financing contract is to give a fixed payment to the investor and make the manager the residual claimant. These theories stress the importance of providing monetary incentives or cash flow rights to the entrepreneur. Ownership is relevant only as it affects pure cash-flowrights.  \n\nThe control theories change the assumptions in the traditional principal-agent models by assuming that actions are indeed observable, but not verifiable. Output and monetary benefits are contractible. As a result, control rights that determine who chooses which action to take will be important. The control theories build on the incomplete contracting literature, pioneered by Grossman and Hart (1986). Two important papers that take this approach to security design are Aghion and Bolton (1992) and Dewatripont and Tirole (1994).  \n\nIn Aghion and Bolton (1992), the project yields both monetary benefits, i.e. profits, that are verifiable and can be transferred to outside investors, and private benefits or actions that are non-verifiable and only go to the entrepreneur. The magnitude of these benefits, in turn, depends on what (non-verifiable) action that is taken with respect to the project. This introduces a conflict of interest. Aghion and Bolton show that it is optimal to give the investor control in the worst states of the world where profits are likely to be low. Aghion and Bolton (1992) point out that a debt contract that transfers control to investors in default states has this feature.  \n\nDewatripont and Tirole (1994) build on Aghion and Bolton (1992) by focusing on the optimal correlation between control rights and cash flow rights. They show that the party in control should look more and more like a debtholder (because debtholders prefer less risk) when things get worse, while more control should be transferred to the entrepreneur or to an equityholder (because equityholders prefer more risk) as performance improves.  \n\nA different set of control theories that we call “stealing theories’ make the assumption that which cash flows are either not observable or not verifiable. These papers include Hart and Moore (1998), Gale and Hellwig (1982), Bolton and Scharfstein (1990), and Fluck (1998). The optimal financial claim in these models is a debt-like claim in which (1) the entrepreneur promises a fixed payment to the investor; and (2) the investor takes control of the project and liquidates the assets if the payment is not made. Liquidation rights, therefore, are crucial in these models.  \n\nA fourth set of theories, beginning with Hart and Moore (1994), relax the stealing assumption and develop a model that has an intuition similar to those of the stealing theories. Hart and Moore (1994) focus on the inalienability of human capital. They assume that (1) the firm's value with the entrepreneur exceeds its liquidation value and (2) the entrepreneur / manager cannot commit not to leave firm. Because the firm is worth less without him, the entrepreneur can threaten to leave the firm unless any promised payment is negotiated down closer to the liquidation value. The optimal contract calls for a debt security, where control is transferred to the investor if the promised payment is not fulfilled, in which case the firm is liquidated. The size of the promised debt payment is limited by the liquidation value of the assets and by the relative bargaining power of the investor.  \n\nWhereas the models described above analyze general financial contracts, a number of other papers focus specifically on venture capital contracts. These include Admati and Pfliederer (1994), Berglof (1994), Cornelli and Yosha (1998), Garmaise (1998), Hellman (1998), and Repullo and Suarez (1999). Most of these theories try to explain the use of convertible securities in venture capital financings (based on the results in Sahlman (1990)).  \n\nThe models described above are largely agency / moral hazard models. Lazear (1986) shows that in a traditional principal-agent framework, contracts also can be used as a screening device if the ability of the entrepreneur / manager is uncertain. By setting the agent's compensation as increasing function of performance, the venture capitalist discourages less able agents from accepting the contract.  \n\nWe obtain the following findings. First, a key feature of VC financings is that they allow VCs to separately allocate cash flow rights, voting rights, board rights, liquidation rights, and other control rights. We explicitly measure and report the allocation of these rights. We believe our measurements are more comprehensive and substantially more detailed than those in any previous work.  \n\nSecond, while convertible securities are used most frequently, VCs also implement the same set of rights using combinations of multiple classes of common stock and straight preferred stock. We also note that VCs use a variant of convertible preferred called participating preferred in roughly $40\\%$ of the financings. Participating preferred, under most circumstances, behaves more like a position of straight preferred stock and common stock than a position of convertible preferred.  \n\nThird, cash flow rights, voting rights, control rights, and future financings are frequently contingent on observable measures of financial and non-financial performance. These state contingencies are more common in first VC financings and early stage financings.  \n\nFourth, these rights are allocated such that if the company performs poorly, the VCs obtain full control. As company performance improves, the entrepreneur retains / obtains more control rights. If the company performs very well, the VCs retain their cash flow rights, but relinquish most of their control and liquidation rights.  \n\nFifth, we find that it is common for VCs to include non-compete and vesting provisions aimed at mitigating the potential hold-up problem between the entrepreneur and the investor. Vesting provisions are more common in early stage financings where it is more likely that the hold-up problem is more severe.  \n\nFinally, we find that cash flow incentives, control rights, and contingencies implemented in these contracts are used more as complements than as substitutes.  \n\nOur results have the following implications:  \n\nFirst, cash flow rights matter in a way that is consistent with the principal-agent models.  \n\nSecond, control rights matter, strongly suggesting that contracts are incomplete.  \n\nThird, cash flow rights and control rights can be separated and made contingent on observable and verifiable measures of performance. This is most supportive of theories that predict shifts of control to investors in bad states - Aghion and Bolton (1992) and Dewatripont and Tirole (1994).  \n\nFinally, we think our results suggest fruitful avenues for future theoretical research. In particular, our results indicate that the allocations of cash flow, control and liquidation rights shift gradually with performance and are interrelated. In many theoretical models, these rights are all-or-nothing and are not interrelated.  \n\nIn comparing financial contracting theories to real world contracts, we believe this paper breaks new ground. In describing venture capital contracts, our paper extends previous work by Sahlman (1990), Gompers (1998), and Black and Gilson (1998).  \n\nSahlman (1990) describes the basic deal structures used in venture capital investments and the economic rationales for them. His is the first detailed discussion of these issues that we are aware of. We extend Sahlman (1990) in several ways. First, Sahlman bases his analysis on forty stock-purchase agreements from a broad range of VCs. His analysis, however, is almost entirely qualitative. He does not present any systematic description and analysis of those agreements. Second, Sahlman focuses on the typical set of terms and does not report or analyze the broad range of terms and contingencies. This is particularly important for considering the appropriateness of the assumptions and predictions of the theories that distinguish between cash flow rights, control rights, and liquidation rights.  \n\nThe data and approach in this paper are perhaps most closely related to those in Gompers (1998). His paper is similar to ours in that he describes aspects of venture capital contracts. He also concludes that the covenants in the contracts allocate control rights independently of cash flow rights. Our paper differs, however, in a number of respects. First, Gompers' had access to only a subset of the contracts and information that we have analyzed. He does not analyze data on ownership (cash flow rights), voting rights, liquidation rights, or descriptions of the underlying businesses (from the business plans). Second, Gompers selected his sample to consist entirely of investments in convertible preferred stock, therefore, eliminating some of the important variation that we find.  \n\nBlack and Gilson (1998) consider explanations for the greater vitality of the venture capital market in stock market- versus bank-centered capital markets. In so doing, they describe different aspects of venture capital contracts. They make the argument, which we confirm as important, that automatic conversion provisions provide important non-monetary incentives to entrepreneurs because they transfer control from the VC to the entrepreneur if the entrepreneur performs well. Like Sahlman (1990), however, they do not present any systematic evidence on the contracts themselves.  \n\nThe paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes our sample. Section 3 describes the venture capital contracts. Section 4 describes the assumptions and predictions of a number of prominent financial contracting theories and discusses our results in relation to them. Section 5 presents some cross-sectional results that further describe the contracts and attempt to distinguish among theories. Section 6 summarizes and discusses our results.  \n\n## 2. Sample  \n\nWe analyze 200 VC investments in 118 portfolio companies by fourteen venture capital partnerships.  \n\n### 2.1 Description  \n\nTo obtain this sample, we asked each VC to provide detailed information on as many of their portfolio company investments as they were willing to provide. For each of these companies, we asked the VC to provide the term sheet as well as the stock purchase and security purchase agreements for each financing round in which they participated. These documents typically include the financing terms, the firm's equity ownership - investors, founders, management, etc. - and any contingencies to future financing. We also asked the VC to provide (if available) the portfolio company's business plan at the time of the financing, the VC's internal analysis of the investment, and the subsequent portfolio company financial performance. Finally, we also requested that the VC provide the private placement memoranda / offering documents for the funds that they have managed over the sample period.  \n\nTable 1 presents summary information for our sample. As mentioned above, panel A indicates that we have 200 investments in 118 portfolio companies by fourteen VC firms. Seventy-three of these investments are pre-revenue (which we will refer to as early stage) rounds. I.e., the firms receiving financing either did not have revenues or were not yet operating. The remaining investments are later stage rounds in which the firms had revenues and were  \n\nalready operating. We have contractual documents for all 200 investments; some internal VC description of the investment for ninety-three investments; and business plans for ninety-three investments. As a result, we do not have complete information for all 200 investments. The sample sizes in our results will vary according to the availability of the relevant information.  \n\nPanel B shows that 159 of the financing rounds were completed between 1996 and 1999. We view the young age of the sample as positive for two reasons. First, our findings will reflect current practice in venture capital financing. Second, it is unlikely that the VCs selected many of these the companies based on the final outcome because the final outcome of most of the investments was unresolved when the VCs provided the companies to us.  \n\nPanel C shows that the portfolio companies were provided by fourteen venture capital firms with no more than twenty-two companies from any one VC.  \n\nPanel D indicates the amounts of the sample financings. The VCs committed a median of $\\$4.8$ million in equity in each financing round. (This amount is the total for all VCs investing in the round.) The VCs actually disbursed a median $\\$3.8$ million at the time the round closed.  \n\nPanel E presents the geographical distribution of the portfolio companies in our sample. The distribution is fairly uniform across California $(29\\%)$ , the Midwest $(20\\%)$ , the Northeast $(26\\%)$ , and elsewhere. Relative to the venture capital industry as a whole, this represents a slight undersampling of California firms and an oversampling of Midwest firms. According to Venture Economics, $41\\%$ of overall VC investments were in California firms and only $14\\%$ in Midwest firms.  \n\nPanel F presents the industry distribution of the portfolio companies in our sample. Consistent with the venture capital industry, the greatest percentage of companies, $36\\%$ , are in the information technology and software industries. An additional $13\\%$ are in telecommunications. Both of these industries include a number of internet related investments. This concentration is roughly consistent with the industry distributions reported in Venture Economics.  \n\nBefore we present our results, it is worth pointing out that while we have a great deal of data, we do not have complete data on every financing round. As a result, the number of observations will vary from analysis to analysis.  \n\n### 2.2 Sample selection issues  \n\nIn this section, we discuss potential selection issues concerning our sample. Our sample of portfolio companies and financings is not a random sample in that we obtained the data from fourteen venture capital firms with whom we have a relationship.  \n\nWe do not believe that this selection is of much concern to our results because we are not attempting to measure performance. Rather, we are attempting to characterize what contracts look like in general and, perhaps more importantly, what contracts are possible.  \n\nIt is worth emphasizing that the contracts represent financings by more than the fourteen VC firms that provided data. The 118 companies in our current sample received VC financing from over 90 additional VC firms either in the financing round in our sample or in other financing rounds. A total of over 1o0 different VC firms, therefore, invested under the terms of the contracts in our sample. This suggests that the financings in our sample are likely to be representative of VC contracts in general.  \n\nThe more likely bias in our sample is that we have selected VC firms that are better than average and that the contracts in our sample may be above average in some sense. If this is so, we believe this strengthens our results because we are more likely to have identified sophisticated, value maximizing principals.  \n\n## 3. Results  \n\nIn this section, we describe the contracts between the portfolio companies / entrepreneurs and the VCs in great detail. We first describe the securities issued. We then describe how these contracts allocate cash-flow rights, voting rights, board rights, and liquidation rights. Last, we consider in more detail the contingencies involved in allocating those rights.  \n\nIn the analysis, we distinguish between early stage financings and later stage financings. We consider a financing to be early stage if the company is pre-revenue - does not have any revenue - at the time of the financing. Later stage or post-revenue rounds are financing rounds that are completed when the company has revenue. This distinction is an interesting one because uncertainty about viability, inalienability, and verifiability of the company should be greater in early stage than in later stage rounds. This will be important in distinguishing among financial contracting theories. In our sample, 77 of the 194 rounds we can classify are pre-revenue.  \n\nWe also distinguish whether a round is the first one in which the company utilizes VC funding. This distinction is an interesting one because asymmetric information between the VC and the founders should be greater in the first VC round than in subsequent rounds. Again, this will be important in distinguishing among financial contracting theories. In our sample, 88 of the 200 rounds represent the first round in which a venture capitalist invested.  \n\n### 3.1 Securities  \n\nPanel G of table 1 reports the types of securities used in the 200 financing rounds. Consistent with Sahlman (1990) and Gompers (1998), convertible preferred stock is the most commonly used security, appearing in 189 of 200 financing rounds. Panel G also indicates, however, that VC financings (1) do not always use convertible preferred stock; and (2) frequently include securities in addition to convertible preferred stock. Seven of the 200 financing rounds do not use any form of convertible security. Instead, they use multiple classes of common stock or a combination of straight preferred and common stock.  \n\nPanel G also reports that in 72 of the financings, the VCs use a variant of convertible preferred called participating preferred.  Upon the liquidation or exit of a participating convertible preferred, investors receive both the principal amount of the preferred - as they would in an investment of straight preferred - and they receive common stock. As a result, participating convertible preferred is better categorized as a position of straight preferred stock and common stock. than as a position of convertible preferred. In some instances, the participating preferred does not receive a return of principal if the company return is sufficiently high.  \n\nWhile the VC financings utilize different types of securities, the financings are similar in that they allow for different allocations of cash flow, voting, board, and liquidation rights. For example, in the financings that use multiple classes of common stock, the VCs receive a different class of common stock than the founders who receive two or more classes of common stock. The VC class of common stock has voting, board, and liquidation rights that are different from those of the founders′ classes of common stock. The cash flow rights of the classes of common stock also differ in that the founders? stock classes vest under different conditions than the VC class (which vests immediately). Hence our focus is on the allocation of different rights rather than on the use of a particular security.  \n\n### 3.2 Cash flow rights  \n\nTable 2 presents our results on cash flow rights. By cash flow rights, we mean the fraction of a portfolio company's equity value that different investors and management have a claim to. Measuring cash flow rights is not trivial, however, because many of the cash flow rights accorded to founders and management are contingent either on subsequent performance (through performance vesting) or on remaining with the company (through time vesting).  \n\nTable 2, therefore, present three measures of cash flow rights. The first - minimum VC ownership - measures cash flow rights under the assumption that management meets all performance and time vesting milestones or contingencies. The second - maximum founders and employees vesting - measures cash flow rights under the assumption that all nonperformance / time-vesting stock and options vest. The third - maximum VC ownership - measures cash flow rights if management does not meet any performance or time vesting milestones. Under each of the three measures, $10\\%$ ,founders $\\%$ and other $\\%$ are, respectively, the percentage of cash flow rights owned by the venture capitalists, the founders, and others. Founders include the founding management team. Others include employees and previous nonVC investors.  \n\nThe ownership numbers are imperfect because we do not always have complete information on the vesting terms for issued options. When we do not have such information, we assume that the issued options are vested. This means that our results surely understate the true extent of state contingent cash flow rights.  \n\nPanel A indicates that the VC controls roughly half the cash flow rights on average; founders roughly $30\\%$ ; and others, roughly $20\\%$ . These suggest that substantial equity ownership on the part of founders / managers is desirable. On the other hand, it also indicates that founders / managers give up a large fraction of ownership.  \n\nTable 2 also indicates that there are meaningful state-contingencies built into the cash flow rights. The VC stake is a median of $3.5\\%$ lower (average of $8.1\\%$ ) lower under full vesting and good performance compared to the minimum vesting, bad performance state. For earlystage companies, the average and median are $11.9\\%$ and $6.1\\%$ , respectively. The statecontingency (i.e. the use of performance benchmarks and vesting) is significantly higher (at the $1\\%$ level) in earlier stage, pre-revenue financings compared to later stage, post-revenue ones. State-contingencies are also greater in first VC rounds compared to subsequent ones.  \n\n### 3.3 Voting rights  \n\nTable 3 reports post-round voting rights. Voting rights measure the percentage of votes that investors and management have to effect corporate decisions. Most decisions are based on majority rule. As such, voting rights provide one measure of control rights. Board rights, described in the next section, provide another.  \n\nIn table 3, minimum (maximum) VC votes represents the minimum (maximum) votes the venture capitalists control based on subsequent management performance and stock vesting milestones or contingencies. $\\%$ VC, $\\%$ Founder, and $\\%$ Neither control are, respectively, the percentage of instances in which voting control is held by the venture capitalists, the founders, or neither. Switch in control indicates the percentage of instances in which voting control can switch based on subsequent performance.  \n\nTable 3 indicates that VCs have a voting majority in $56\\%$ of all financings in the minimum contingency case. Panel B shows that VCs control a majority of votes in $66\\%$ of the early stage financings (in the minimum contingency case) versus $49\\%$ for later stage financings. Panel C indicates that VCs control a majority of the votes in $44\\%$ of first VC rounds and $65\\%$ of subsequent VC rounds. In the maximum VC vote contingency cases, VCs control a voting majority in $71\\%$ of the financings with greater percentages in the early stage rounds.  \n\nImportantly, our results indicate that state-contingent control rights (i.e. not only in case of default on a debt payment) exist. In $17.5\\%$ of the financings, we see voting control switching depending on state-contingencies. This state-contingency result as well as those that follow are important in light of several of the financial contracting theories we describe in section 4. Statecontingent voting control is more likely in early stage rounds and first VC rounds.  \n\n### 3.4 Board rights  \n\nBoard rights and board seats also have an effect on the rights to control corporate decisions. While they tend to be related to voting rights, they need not be identical. We distinguish between normal board rights that reflect the board rights or composition at the completion of the financing from adverse state board rights that reflect board rights or composition if the portfolio company performs poorly or reaches an adverse state.  \n\nWe distinguish between three kinds of board members - VCs, founders, and outsiders. VC seats are board seats that are reserved for or controlled by venture capitalists. Founder seats are board seats that are reserved for or controlled by the founders / entrepreneurs. Outsider seats are board seats that are to be filled by individuals mutually agreed upon by the VCs and the founders / entrepreneurs.  \n\nTable 4 reports the board results. The boards have an average of 6.1 members and a median of 6 members. These boards are appreciably smaller than those of public companies. Overall, the VC has the majority of the board seats in $26\\%$ of the cases, the founders in $12\\%$ of the cases, and neither in $62\\%$ of the cases. Interestingly, the VCs are less likely to have board control than they are to have voting control. VC board control is less common for early-stage financings compared to later stage. State-contingent board provisions (i.e. the VC gets full control of the board in the bad state) are present in $15\\%$ of the cases. This provides another important example of state-contingent control rights.  \n\nVC board control does not tend to differ much across early versus later stage rounds. VC board control does tend to increase, however, with subsequent VC rounds. This is not surprising given that new VCs often invest in each round and request a board seat as a condition of the investment.  \n\n### 3.5 Liquidation rights  \n\nMuch of the theoretical security design literature stresses the importance of liquidation rights. In these models, an investor's ability to liquidate, or threaten to liquidate, the firm's assets if the firm defaults is the main way for an investor to ensure repayment. In this subsection and in table 5, we describe the liquidation rights in VC financings.  \n\nFirst, it is clear that VCs have claims that in liquidation are senior to the common stock claims of the founders. This is true in all but one of the sample financings. In that financing, the VC firm bought common stock.  \n\nSecond, the claims of the VCs in liquidation are typically at least as large as the original investments.  Panel A of table 5 indicates that this is true in $98\\%$ of the financings.  \n\nEven though most of the financings give liquidation claims to the venture capitalists, there are some cross-sectional differences in how strong these are for different deals. One common way of making the liquidation rights stronger is by giving the investor cumulative preferred dividends. Even though these are dividends, and strictly speaking do not have to be paid out, they will accumulate and be added to the liquidation claim. Cumulative preferred dividends are present in $46\\%$ of our financings.  \n\nOptional redemption and put provisions also are commonly used to strengthen the liquidation rights of the venture capitalist's investment. These provisions give the venture capitalist the right after some period time to demand that the firm redeems the venture capitalists claim, typically at liquidation value (or occasionally, at the maximum of the liquidation value and \"fair market value\"). This is very similar to the right to repayment of principal at the maturity of a debt claim. Without this provision, the liquidation right loses much of its bite because there are no other contracted payments to the venture capitalist that the firm could default on. Panel C indicates that optional redemption or put provisions are present in $84\\%$ Oof our financings. The maturity of these provisions is typically five years.  \n\n### 3.6 Contingencies  \n\nAs mentioned earlier, different theories make different assumptions concerning what it is and is not possible to write contracts on. For example, it is common among some financial contracting theorists - e.g., Hart and Moore (1998) - to assume that the entrepreneur and outside investors can observe firm output, but they cannot write contracts on that output because output cannot be verified in court.  \n\nIn this section, we report the extent to which contracts between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs are written contingent on subsequent output, performance, or actions. We also detail the types of output that such contracts are written on.  \n\nTable 6 reports specific examples of contingencies in the VC financings in our sample. Panel A shows that 41 of the financing rounds (roughly $20\\%$ ) include provisions that are contingent on subsequent financial performance. In one financing round, the VCs contractually obtain voting control from the entrepreneur if the firm's EBIT -- earnings before interest and taxes -- falls below a mutually agreed upon amount. In another financing round, VCs obtain board control if a firm's net worth falls below a threshold. Net worth, in this instance, is a measure of a company's cumulative cash flow. These examples indicate that VCs are able to write (and presumably enforce) contracts in which control rights are contingent on subsequent output quite independently of cash flow rights.  \n\nPanel B shows that 25 of the financing rounds $(12.5\\%)$ include contingencies based on subsequent non-financial performance. In one instance, share vesting is contingent on product functionality or performance. In several others, vesting is contingent on FDA or patent approvals. The disbursal of committed funding also can be contingent on non-financial  \n\nperformance. For example, one financing was contingent on successfully completing clinical tests.  \n\nPanel C reports that 28 of the financing rounds $(14\\%)$ include contingencies based on certain actions being taken. For example, in different rounds, the disbursal of committed funding is contingent on hiring new executives, developing new facilities, and completing a new business plan. Presumably, these actions are both observable and verifiable.  \n\nFinally, panel D indicates that contingencies based on the sale of securities are included in almost ten percent of the financings. In particular, ownership and vesting are commonly linked to a subsequent initial public offering or sale of the company.  \n\nOverall, table 6 generates two strong results. First, investors (VCs) commonly write (and presumably enforce) contracts in which control rights are contingent on subsequent measures of financial and non-financial performance or output. Second, there is a great deal of variation in the contingencies in these contracts. The contingencies appear to be related to the performance measure that is most important to the investors and the company.  \n\nTable 7 quantifies the qualitative information on contingencies in table 6. Panel A indicates that contingencies based on subsequent financial or non-financial performance, actions, or sales of securities are used in 36.5 percent of the financings.  \n\nTable 7 also indicates that $15\\%$ of the sample financings themselves are partially contingent on the attainment of some milestone. In these financings, the VCs provide only a portion of the total funding commitment at the closing or signing of the financing. Additional funding is provided contingent on subsequent performance and actions. In two financings, the VCprovided only $5\\%$ of its total commitment at closing with the rest being contingent. This was more common in early stage than in later stage financings and more common in first VC rounds than in subsequent rounds.  \n\n### 3.7 Other terms  \n\nVC financings include a number of additional terms and conditions. Bartlett (1995) and Levin (1998) detail many of these. In this section, we describe several of the terms and conditions that we believe are relevant to the financial contracting theories.  \n\n#### 3.7.1 Automatic conversion  \n\nIt is common for securities in venture capital financings to include automatic conversion provisions. Under these provisions, the security held by the venture capitalists - convertible preferred stock, convertible debt, or a class of common stock - automatically converts into common stock under certain conditions. These conditions generally, although not exclusively, relate to an initial public offering (IPO) and require the IPO to exceed a designated common stock price, dollar amount of proceeds, and / or market capitalization for the company.  \n\nAs Black and Gilson (1998) are the first to argue, the effect of these provisions is to require the venture capitalists to give up the superior control, voting, board, and liquidation rights associated with their securities if the portfolio company attains a desired level of performance.? Upon superior performance, the VCs retain only those rights associated with their ownership of common stock. If the company does not deliver that performance, the VCs retain their superior control rights. This provides the entrepreneur an incentive to increase the value of the firm over and above the monetary incentive.  \n\nPanel A of table 8 indicates that an automatic conversion provision was present in almost $94\\%$ of the financing rounds. Panel A also shows that the financings in rounds that included an automatic conversion provision required that the company complete an IPO at an IPO stock price a median 3.0 times greater than the stock price of the financing round. The ratio is significantly higher in early stage rounds - 4.0 times - than in later stage rounds - 2.7 times.  \n\nIt is worth noting that at the median ratio of 3.0 times, the VCs are not willing to give up any control unless they triple their money. Over a four-year horizon, this works out to a return of $31\\%$ per year.  \n\n#### 3.7.2 Antidilution protection  \n\nVenture capital financings also frequently include antidilution protection which protects the venture capitalist against future financing rounds at a lower valuation than the valuation of the current protected round. In the extreme case, known as full ratchet antidilution protection, the protected security obtains a claim to enough additional common shares to effectively reduce the price of the protected issue to that of the new issue. In a convertible issue, this is accomplished by decreasing the conversion price on the protected issue to the same conversion price or common stock price of the new issue. The other common type of antidilution protection is the weighted average ratchet. Under a weighted average ratchet, the reduction in the conversion price (or common stock price) of the protected issue is a function of the number of shares issued and the conversion price of the new issue.  \n\nPanel B of table 8 indicates that the financings in almost $95\\%$ of the rounds receive antidilution protection. Almost $76\\%$ of the financings utilize the weighted average method rather than the full ratchet method.  \n\n#### 3.7.3 Vesting and non-compete clauses  \n\nThe inalienability of human capital theories of Hart and Moore (1994) assume that the entrepreneur cannot contractually commit to stay with the firm. Even though it is not possible to write enforceable contracts that force the entrepreneur to stay with a firm, there are contractual provisions that make it more costly for the entrepreneur to leave. In real-world contracts, two methods are commonly used to make it costly for the entrepreneur to leave the firm.  \n\nFirst, the entrepreneur's shares can vest over time. This means that the company receives or can buy back any unvested shares for some low value if the entrepreneur leaves. The earlier the entrepreneur leaves, the more shares are still unvested. Second, the VCs can require the entrepreneur to sign a non-compete contract with the firm that prohibits him from working for another firm in the same industry for some period of time in case he leaves. Both of these provisions improve the bargaining power of the VCs if the entrepreneur tries to hold up the VC.  \n\nTable 8 shows that the VC financings in our sample commonly utilize both founder vesting and non-compete clauses. Founder vesting is used in almost $42\\%$ of financing rounds. Such vesting is significantly more frequently in early stage financings than in later stage ones with vesting present in almost $56\\%$ of pre-revenue financings, but in only $33\\%$ of post-revenue financings. Non-compete clauses are used in approximately $70\\%$ of the portfolio companies.  \n\n### 3.8 Evolution of Contracts over Time and Rounds  \n\nThe analyses in the previous sections assume in some sense that each financing round is independent. This is, of course, not the case. Acordingly, in table 9, we report cash flow rights voting rights, board rights, liquidation rights, and other terms as a function of the financing  \n\nround. We distinguish between first round financings in which future financing is contingent on performance (ex ante staging) and those that are not.  \n\nTable 9 indicates that founders’ cash flow, voting, and board rights decline over financing rounds while VC rights increase.\\* The most notable pattern involves voting rights Founders relinquish voting control by the second VC round in all but $11.5\\%$ of the financing rounds. Analogously, the VCs obtain explicit voting control in over $60\\%$ of the second VC rounds.  \n\nThe increase in VC cash flow and control rights over financing rounds is consistent with the VC demanding more and more equity and control as compensation for providing additional funds to the venture. Interestingly, the allocation of cash-flow and voting rights in the ex-ante staging contracts are very similar to later stage rounds, although the allocations are more sensitive to performance.  \n\n### 3.9 Summary  \n\nWe make several general observations concerning the descriptive results in this section..  \n\nFirst, VC financings allow VCs to separately allocate cash flow rights, voting rights, board rights, liquidation rights, and other control rights.  \n\nSecond, while VCs use convertible securities most frequently, they also implement the same allocation of rights using combinations of multiple classes of common stock and straight preferred stock. Furthermore, participating convertible preferred is used frequently. This is significant because participating preferred is the equivalent of a position of preferred stock and common stock rather than a position of convertible preferred.  \n\nThird, we find that cash flow rights, voting rights, control rights, and future financings are frequently contingent on observable measures of financial and non-financial performance. These state contingent rights are more common in first VC and early stage financings.  \n\nFourth, rights are allocated such that if the company performs poorly, the VCs obtain full control. As company performance improves, the entrepreneur retains / obtains more cash flow rights and control rights. If the company performs very well, the VCs relinquish most of their control and liquidation rights. This occurs when the VC's investment automatically converts into common stock.  \n\nFifth, we find that it is common for VCs to include non-compete and vesting provisions aimed at mitigating the potential hold-up problem between the entrepreneur and the investor. The vesting provisions are more common in early stage financings where it is more likely that the hold-up problem is more severe.  \n\nFinally, there is a tendency for VCs to use greater state-contingencies in early stage financings and in first venture capital financings.  \n\n## 4. Relation of Results to Financial Contracting Theories  \n\nIn this section, we interpret our results in relation to the financial contracting theories described in the introduction. We do so by examining the extent to which the contract provisions we have examined are consistent with the assumptions and predictions of the theories.  \n\n### 4.1 The \"traditional\" principal agent problem  \n\nThe traditional principal-agent models assume that actions or efforts of the entrepreneur are unobservable. However, signals - i.e., firm performance - are correlated with those actions or efforts. These signals can be contracted on. The division of cash-flow rights is designed to affect the pay-performance sensitivity of the entrepreneur. In general (in the absence of riskaversion), the investor will want to maximize this pay-performance sensitivity, which can be achieved by giving the entrepreneur a substantial part of the firm's equity. Moreover, it is in the investor's interest to make the entrepreneur's compensation contingent on as many verifiable signals correlated with effort as possible. Also, the larger the incentive conflict between the investor and entrepreneur, the higher the pay-performance sensitivity should be.  \n\nOur results are clearly consistent with the theoretical assumptions in that cash flow rights are contingent on a number of performance-based results, both financial and non-financial. On the other hand, we do find that some actions or efforts are observable and are contracted on.  \n\nOur results also are consistent with some of the predictions. In all our financings, the entrepreneur gets a substantial fraction of equity in the firm. Furthermore, the entrepreneur's equity stake increases with firm performance. This sensitivity is greater in early stage firms where observability problems presumably are the largest. Moreover, the contracts often condition the entrepreneur's equity compensation on a multitude of signals, both financial and non-financial.  \n\nIt is clear, however, that the traditional principal agent models do not completely explain the contracts we observe because the principal agent models make no predictions about the allocation of control rights. In the contracts we study, control rights are important and separate from cash flow rights.  \n\nThe control theories make assumptions and predictions concerning cash flow rights that are consistent with those made in traditional principal agent models. Higher pay-performance sensitivity increases the weight entrepreneurs put on monetary benefits rather than private benefits.  \n\nAt the same time, control rights are central to the theories of Aghion and Bolton (1992) and Dewatripont and Tirole (1994). Because giving up control rights is costly for the entrepreneur in terms of private benefits, the entrepreneur will try to avoid doing so as much as possible. As the external financing capacity of the project increases (e.g. the later the stage, the higher the verifiable monetary benefits, etc.), these theories predict a movement from more investor control to more entrepreneur control. Moreover, if the entrepreneur has to give up control rights, he will do so first in the states where control rights are most valuable to the investor. Finally, to the extent that actions are contractible, the entrepreneur will find it useful tc precommit to take certain actions.  \n\nThe extensive use and contracting on control rights in our sample is broadly consistent with the assumptions and predictions of these theories. Allocating state-contingent voting and board control rights is a common feature in these contracts. This state-contingent contracting is much more elaborate than the control rights inherent in ordinary debt contracts that only give liquidation rights in case of default on a promised payment. As shown in Table 6, control can be made contingent on financial performance relative to projections or cumulative cash-flow, or on non-financial events such as the termination of the manager, quite independently of the division of cash-flow rights.  \n\nHence, our results provide empirical support to the incomplete contracting approach pioneered by Grossman and Hart (1986). The control theories, however, do not fully explain VC financings. In particular, the shift of control in these theories is all-or-nothing and is determined by whether performance does or does not exceed a certain level. In practice, control shifts along a number of dimensions -voting rights, board rights, liquidation rights, redemption rights, etc. - and shifts at different levels of performance. ® At extreme poor performance, VCs get liquidation rights in default. For “normal’ performance, VCs and the entrepreneur share voting rights and board rights, although they shift toward the entrepreneur as performance goals are met. Finally, for extremely good performance, the VC relinquishes all special control rights (generally through automatic conversion at an IPO).  \n\n### 4.3 \"Stealing theories\": cash flows neither observable nor verifiable  \n\nThe “stealing” theories of Hart and Moore (1998), Gale and Hellwig (1982), and others are less successful in our data. First, these theories do not explain the division of residual cashflow rights in VC financings. Because they assume the entrepreneur can expropriate all the residual cash-flow of the firm, these models implicitly assume that the entrepreneur owns all the equity. Second, these models assume that it is not possible to write contracts on profits or other measures of financial performance is assumed impossible in these models. Third, the only control rights that matter in these theories are liquidation rights.  \n\nIn all our financings, investors accept claims with equity features -- such as convertibles, warrants or common stock - that promise residual cash-flow rights in the future. More importantly, contracts are frequently written contingent on both financial and non-financial  \n\nmeasures of performance. Finally, in these theories, the only verifiable signal to contract on is default on promised payments. While these theories are consistent with the use of ordinary debt contracts, they do not explain the rich state-contingent contracting that we find in venture capital contracts.  \n\nIn the models of outside equity financing in Myers (forthcoming) and Fluck (1998), the liquidation right is replaced by the right to fire management, which will occur if dividends are too low. Here it is essential, then, that outside equity investors have this right, which in turn implies that they need to hold a majority of the votes. Moreover, in these models, the firm has to pay out dividends. Both of these assumptions are frequently violated in our venture capital financings. For a significant fraction of our observations, $43\\%$ of our cases, the venture capitalist lacks voting control. Moreover, very few of our firms are required to pay cash dividends. Hence, these theories do not seem to be able to explain the structure of our venture capital financings.  \n\nThere is, however, an important sense in which the “stealing theories\"” are successful. Our results indicate that liquidation rights are allocated to VCs. If the company is liquidated, the liquidation proceeds go to the VCs ahead of the entrepreneur. Furthermore, the VCs do have some power to liquidate through redemption rights, explicitly through ex ante staging and, implicitly through the ability to not fund a subsequent round.  \n\n### 4.4 Inalienability of human capital  \n\nThe inalienability of human capital theories of Hart and Moore (1994) assume that the entrepreneur cannot contractually commit to stay with the firm. Because the firm is worth more with the entrepreneur than without him, this leads to a hold-up problem where the entrepreneur will threaten to leave the venture unless the investor's claim is written down.  \n\nOur results suggest that this is an important issue. Venture capitalists frequently use contractual remedies, such as non-compete clauses and time vesting of founder shares to make it more costly for the entrepreneur / manager to leave.f° Both of these provisions improve the bargaining power of the VCs versus the entrepreneur in any subsequent renegotiation because the entrepreneur has relatively more to lose.  \n\nFurthermore, vesting provisions also are more common in early stage firms. These provisions explicitly make it more costly for the entrepreneur the earlier he leaves. This is consistent with Hart and Moore (1994) if the entrepreneur is more crucial for the firm’s operations in the earlier stage. As time passes, and the firm becomes less and less dependent on the specific skills of the original founder, more and more of the founder's shares vest. This scheme also gives some protection to the entrepreneur from being completely held up by the venture capitalist at the point when the entrepreneur is no longer needed to run the business.  \n\n### 4.5 Venture Capital-Specific Theories  \n\nThe venture capital-specific theories are arguably less successful overall in explaining our results. Among these theories, the predictions in Hellman (1998) are the most consistent with our results.  \n\nBerglof (1994) predicts that control rights will be allocated based on firm performance. At the same time, however, he also predicts that cash flow rights will not be allocated based on firm performance and that the entrepreneur receives private benefits not cash flow rights. These latter two predictions are clearly at odds with the data.  \n\nSimilarly, the key prediction in Cornelli and Yosha (1998) that the cash flow rights allocated to VCs upon conversion increase with the signal of firm performance is contradicted by our data. In our data, VC cash flow rights (as a fraction of all rights) decline with firm performance.  \n\nThe assumptions and predictions in Repullo and Suarez (1998) meet with mixed success in our data. Repullo and Suarez correctly predict that entrepreneurs and venture capitalists will both have equity ownership and, therefore, share the cash flow rights of the company. They also predict a contract that looks somewhat like convertible preferred for start-up financings. However, they predict that later stage financings will be done with all common stock. Our results indicate that financings at all stages - early and later - utilize convertible preferred stock or multiple classes of common stock. We also question their assumption that the VCs primarily add value in the expansion stage rather than the start-up stage.  \n\nGarmaise (1998) develops a model in which venture capitalists who have privately observed signals about a project bid for the entrepreneur's venture using different contract provisions. The optimal strategy for the venture capitalist involves offering to take a debt claim when the private signal is low, and an equity claim when the private signal is high. Because we do not observe VCs offering straight debt contracts or straight equity contracts, our results do not appear consistent with Garmaise's model.  \n\nIn Hellman (1998), the optimal financing contract calls for: (1) giving the entrepreneur all equity compensation to increase his effort and decrease his resistance towards replacement; and (2) giving the venture capitalist control if the benefits from replacing the entrepreneur are high enough. Although entrepreneurs do not receive all equity compensation, it is safe to say that the larger part of their compensation comes from the upside associated with their equity stake. Furthermore, it is common in our data for the VCs to have voting control at the close of the financing. This is consistent with Hellman if the expected benefits of replacing the entrepreneur are higher in early stage deals.  \n\nWhile Hellman (1998) is consistent with some of our findings, the model fails to capture the contingent nature of control rights in our results. In Hellman (1998), control rights are set at the beginning and do not shift as a function of performance.  \n\n### 4.6 Screening Models.  \n\nIt also is apparent venture capital contracts perform important screening functions. Lazear (1986) provides the most relevant theoretical treatment of these issues. Prendergast (1999) also describes and summarizes these models. For example, those provisions that make cash flow rights contingent on performance not only motivate entrepreneurs to provide effort, but also discourage entrepreneurs with bad projects from accepting the contract.  \n\nSimilarly, anti-dilution provisions also penalize entrepreneurs with bad projects or bad skills because the current VC investment will be re-priced downward if a future financing is completed at a lower price.  \n\nThe use of participating convertible preferred compared to straight convertible preferred also provides a screening function. Assume that a VC places a particular distribution of values on an entrepreneur's company. Assume next that the VC offers a convertible preferred contract and a participating convertible preferred contract to the entrepreneur with the same expected payout to the VC. Because the VC obtains a return of principal in the participating preferred contract, the participating preferred will require a lower percentage ownership than the convertible preferred for the same expected value to the VC. Now take the entrepreneur's perspective. All else equal, entrepreneurs who know or believe they will succeed will prefer the participating preferred over the convertible preferred. Thus, participating preferred is potentially useful in screening entrepreneurs who are better or more optimistic.  \n\n## 5. Cross-sectional Tests and Relationships  \n\nIn this section, we report the results of cross-sectional tests. We investigate how the contracts vary as a function of different proxies for the severity of the agency problem between the VC and the entrepreneur as well as for information differences between them. We then interpret these results in relation to the predictions of the different theories.  \n\n### 5.1 Dependent variables  \n\nThe potential conflicts of interest between the entrepreneur and the VC should depend on the degree of uncertainty about the project's economic viability. This uncertainty should be higher at the early stages of a project's life, when the quality and value of the project are still highly uncertain. To capture this, we use the \"Pre-revenue venture\" variable, taking the value of one if the company had no revenues at the time of financing, and zero otherwise.  \n\nWe expect this variable to be related to the agency problem for a number of reasons. At the early stage in the project's life, the input of the entrepreneur is arguably more crucial to the project's success. Hence, providing incentives to the entrepreneur to \"work on the right things' becomes crucial. Also, asymmetric information problems are also likely to be higher, in particular regarding the viability of the business idea and the entrepreneur's skills. Similarly,  \n\nwhen the uncertainty about the project viability is higher, the VCs are more likely to find themselves in the situation where they want to shut down the project or replace the management team, leading to potential conflicts with the entrepreneur.  \n\nThe VC may have prior information on the quality of the founders which reduces the likelihood of adverse selection and the uncertainty of the venture. To measure this, we form a dummy variable, \"repeat entrepreneur\", taking the value of one if the founders had previously founded a company that was either taken public or was acquired by another public company before the financing round, and zero otherwise. We use the company business plan and the VC analysis to obtain this information. This variable may also capture the degree to which the entrepreneur is financially constrained. It is likely that a previously successful entrepreneur will have acquired some wealth that can be invested in the project, reducing the need for VC financing  \n\nThe extent to which the VC needs to protect itself from agency problems, and the required stake that the VC needs to be allocated to invest in the venture, will also in general depend on the amount of funds the VC invests in the project. Including the dollar amount invested by the VCs directly as a dependent variable would be problematic, however. First, it is an endogenous variable, since the amount invested by the VC in a particular round potentially will be lower when agency problems are more severe.1l Second, the financing amount should be measured in relation to the total financing need of the project and the expected future cash flow which are difficult to determine.  \n\nInstead, we try to capture this effect by including the financing round number, which is correlated with the accumulated financing provided by the VC, but suffers less from endogeneity and normalization problems. One potential problem with this variable, however, is that it might also capture the degree of uncertainty about the project in a similar way to \"Pre-revenue venture\".  \n\nTo control for possible effects of industry, geographical location, and the identity of the particular VC firm, we also include dummy variables for these in some of our specifications.  \n\n### 5.2 Determinants of cash-flow right allocations  \n\nThe allocation of cash-flow rights to the entrepreneur will affect the pay-performance sensitivity of the entrepreneurs’ claims. The classical principal agent theories predict that payperformance sensitivity should be higher when agency problems are more severe (i.e. when the return to managerial effort is high, see e.g. Prendergast (1999).  \n\nTable 10 examines the cross-sectional determinants of pay-performance sensitivity using two different measures. The first measure is simply the share of equity allocated to the entrepreneur. This measure is essentially the pay-performance measure introduced by Jensen and Murphy (1990) and applied to venture-capital financed IPO firms by Baker and Gompers (1999). The cross-sectional results in table 10 using this measure are quite weak. If anything, the results go against the predictions of theory since the founders? equity stake is lower for pre-revenue ventures and higher for successful entrepreneurs (even though the coefficients are not significant in all specifications).  \n\nThe problem with this as a measure of pay-performance sensitivity is that it is very much related to the overall value of the venture relative to the amount of funding the VC is providing. When uncertainty and agency problems are high, the VC will require more cash-flow rights in return for the financing provided, driving down the founders’ equity stake. The significantly  \n\nnegative effect of the round of VC investment is consistent with this interpretation. For each financing round, the VC puts more funds into the venture and requires a higher equity stake. This suggests that the founder equity stake is not a useful measure of incentive provision for entrepreneurial firms.  \n\nEven if the VC demands a large equity stake, it can still increase the pay-performance sensitivity for the entrepreneur by making the allocation more state-contingent. This is addressed by our second measure of pay-performance sensitivity, the difference in the founder equity stake between the best and the worst case state. In the second set of regressions in table 10, the founders′ equity percentage is significantly more sensitive to performance for pre-revenue ventures. In addition, the equity percentage of previously successful entrepreneurs is somewhat less sensitive to performance, although the relationship is not statistically significant when location, industry, and VC firm controls are included, or when we restrict the sample to first VC financings.  \n\nOverall, these results support the prediction of the classical principal agent theories. They also are consistent with a screening model (e.g. along the lines of Lazear (1986)) where payperformance sensitivity is used to screen out bad entrepreneurs, since more able entrepreneurs will benefit more from state-contingent cash-flow allocations.  \n\n### 5.3 Determinants of control right allocations  \n\nThe incomplete contracting theories of Aghion and Bolton (1992) and others focus on the allocation of control between the investor and the entrepreneur. Aghion and Bolton (1992) show that as the external financing capacity of the project increases (e.g. the later the stage, the higher the verifiable monetary benefits, etc.), control moves from more investor control to more  \n\nentrepreneur control. In particular, for projects with high external financing capacity (i.e. small agency problems or small required investment) the entrepreneur always should have control. As external financing capacity decreases there should be state-contingent control. Finally, for projects with low external financing capacity, the investor should always be allocated control.  \n\nTable 11 tests this prediction using two measures of control -- voting control and board majority. Panel A estimates an ordered logit regression of voting control on our proxies for agency problems. The dependent variable takes the value of zero if the entrepreneur always controls a majority of the votes, one if the VC has voting control only in the worse state, and two if the VC always has voting control.  \n\nPanel A of table 11 shows that the pre-revenue variable is significantly positively related to VC control in all of the specifications. The repeat entrepreneur variable is negatively related to VC control, significantly so in two of the regressions. Finally, the amount of VC funding, as measured by the round of financing, is strongly positively related to VC control. These results are generally consistent with the predictions in Aghion and Bolton (1992).  \n\nIn panel B, we repeat the exercise using board rights as our measure of control. Here we define the VC control variable as zero if the founders control a majority of the board seats, one if neither the VC nor the founders have board control, and two if the VC controls the board. Here the results are similar, but not as strong as for voting rights.12  \n\n### 5.4 Determinants of liquidation rights and claims  \n\nMost of the financial contracting theories predict that the investor should have a senior claim compared to the entrepreneur. The other important characteristic of liquidation rights is the ability to liquidate the firm when performance is bad. According to the \"Stealing Theories\", the investor's ability to liquidate when a contracted payment has not been met is critical to be able to recoup the investment. Table 5 showed that the VC is almost always senior to the entrepreneur in liquidation, while contracted payments are largely absent from the contracts, with the exception of redemption rights.  \n\nTable 12 investigates the cross-sectional determinants of liquidation rights. Because liquidation rights typically do not change over time, we restrict attention to the first financing round available for each company only to avoid \"double-counting\" of observations.  \n\nFirst, redemption rights are unrelated to the pre-revenue variable, but are significantly less likely to be present when the entrepreneur has previously founded a successful venture. Second, cumulative preferred dividends are negatively related to the repeat entrepreneur variable and insignificantly related to the pre-revenue dummy.13 This provides some evidence that redemption clauses and cumulative preferred dividends are used when the adverse selection problem with respect to the entrepreneur is more severe.  \n\nThird, the presence of participating preferred stock cannot be explained by either of our two proxies for agency problems. Both the pre-revenue and the repeat entrepreneur dummy are generally insignificant.  \n\nTo sum up, our results for liquidation rights are not incredibly strong. While the presence of redemption rights and cumulative dividends does seems somewhat related to agency problems as measured by the repeat entrepreneur variable, the use of participating preferred stock does not. Also, the pre-revenue variable that was critical in explaining the use of cash-flow incentives and the allocation of control rights does not at all relate to the liquidation rights.  \n\n### 5.5Determinants of contingencies / contracting space  \n\nThe results in table 6 showed that VCs contract on a number of different measures of financial and non-financial performance, all presumably observable and verifiable. As noted earlier, this result is at odds with the strong contracting assumptions made in Hart and Moore (1998) and others. On the other hand, a large fraction of the contracts in our sample do not include any performance contingencies.  \n\nIn this section, we consider the potential determinants of such contingencies. One possibility is that state-contingencies are less appropriate for more uncertain environments where it is more difficult to define and verify future contingencies  \n\nThis interpretation, however, does not get much support in the data. In the first three columns of table 13, the dependent variable takes the value of one if there is any contingent contracting in the deal (on cash-flow, control, liquidation rights, or future financings) and zero otherwise. The degree of contingent contracting is unrelated to whether the venture has revenues or not. Instead, the extent of contingent contracting is related to the round of VC investment. Contingent contracting is significantly more common in earlier financing rounds and somewhat more common for entrepreneurs without a previous record of success (when the degree of uncertainty should be higher).  This suggests that the use of contingent contracts is more closely related to VC screening of companies and entrepreneurs.  \n\nIn the last two columns of panel A, contingencies are divided into those based on financial and non-financial performance. Contingent contracting on non-financial performance is more common in earlier stage financings. This suggests that VCs find other observable and verifiable signals when financial measures are unavailable.  \n\n### 5.6 Determinants of ex-ante staging  \n\nTable 14 examines the presence of ex-ante staging in the initial VC financing contracts. In an ex-ante staged deal, part of the VC's committed funding is released at a later date contingent on explicit financial or non-financial performance milestones. These provisions can be interpreted as another type of liquidation right. By giving the VC the ability to withhold the rest of the financing if performance is unsatisfactory, the VC essentially gets the right to liquidate the venture in the bad state of the world.  \n\nMost VC financings are at least implicitly staged, in the sense that even when all the funding in the initial round is released immediately, it is understood that future financing rounds will be needed to support the firm until the IPO. Hence, the same mechanism is present implicitly in most VC financings. The ex-ante staging, however, makes this liquidation right stronger and more explicitly related to performance.  \n\nTable 14 looks at two different measures: logit regressions on a dummy variable indicating ex-ante staging, as well as tobit regressions on the fraction of future committed financing to total financing committed. The results are very similar for both measures and mimic the results for liquidation rights. While the pre-revenue venture variable is not significant, the repeat entrepreneur dummy is negatively related to ex-ante staging and generally significant. Again, the ability to withhold part of the VC financing is used more when the uncertainty about the entrepreneur's type is higher. Table 14 also indicates significant differences across industries.14  \n\n### 5.7. Complementarity and substitutability of contract provisions  \n\nSo far, we have examined the different contractual rights and provisions one at a time. One important finding, however, is that VCs use several different governance mechanisms, such as pay-performance compensation, board and voting control, and liquidation rights, simultaneously in their contracts. This section takes an exploratory step in examining the interaction between these rights. Here, theoretical predictions are largely absent because financial contracting models typically focus on one mechanism in isolation.15 We restrict the comparison to initial financing rounds in order to \"purge\" the comparison from effects due to the evolution of the contracts over time documented in table 9.  \n\nTable 15 considers contracting provisions for the initial VC investments in our sample along three different dimensions - the degree of VC voting control ',the extent of payperformance sensitivity in the founder's equity stake, and whether the next financing round is specified in the contract and contingent on performance. Similar patterns emerge in all three panels.  \n\nFirst, panel A shows that voting control and board control are significantly positively correlated. Hence, these two control mechanisms seem to be complementary. They also are strongly positively related to the amount of equity that the VC holds in the firm. Despite the fact that they are separately contracted upon and not perfectly correlated, cash-flow rights and control rights largely go together. Also, when VCs have control, they are more reluctant to relinquish it. The stock price (relative to the current price) at which the automatic conversion provision is significantly higher when VCs have control.  \n\nSecond, panel A shows that the performance sensitivity of the founder's equity claim is positively related to the degree of VC control in general, and state-contingent control in particular. When the VC has voting control, roughly one-third of the founders’ equity stake is contingent on performance versus only three percent when the founders always have voting control. The results are similar for board control and founder vesting provisions. Founders' pay-performance incentives and VC control, therefore, seem to be more complements than substitutes.  \n\nThird, the relationship between liquidation rights and the other rights is less clear-cut. Cumulative dividends and redemption clauses are largely independent of control rights, while the use of participating preferred stock is more common the higher the degree of VC voting control. On the other hand, both redemption rights and cumulative dividends are significantly positively related to founders′ pay-performance sensitivity, while participating preferred is not related.  \n\nFourth, panel A shows that the use of explicit contracting on different measures of performance is positively related to VC control, and in particular to voting control. The use of any contingencies occurs in $57.5\\%$ of the financings in which the VCs always have a voting majority, but in only $28\\%$ of the financings in which the founders control the majority of the votes. The differences are even greater for contracts with contracting on financial or nonfinancial performance. Hence, the contracting space seems to be larger when VCs are in control compared to when the entrepreneur is in control.  \n\nFinally, panel C shows that the allocation of rights is strongly related to the presence of ex-ante staged financing. In financing rounds with ex-ante (contingent) staging: VCs are much more likely to have voting and board control; founders have more contingent pay-performance sensitivities; vesting provisions are more common; automatic conversion prices are a larger multiple of the stock price of the round; and default board provisions and full ratchet antidilution protection are more common.  \n\nTo sum up, to the extent the different governance mechanisms are related, they are more complements than substitutes.  \n\n## 6. Discussion and Conclusion  \n\nIn this paper, we have compared the characteristics of real world financial contracts to their counterparts in financial contracting theory by conducting a detailed study of actual contracts between venture capitalists (VCs) and entrepreneurs.  \n\n### 6.1 Findings  \n\nOur main findings include:  \n\n(1) The distinguishing characteristic of VC financings is that they allow VCs to separately allocate cash flow rights, voting rights, board rights, liquidation rights, and other control rights. We explicitly measure and report the allocation of these rights.  \n\n(2)  While convertible securities are used most frequently, VCs also implement a similar allocation of rights using combinations of multiple classes of common stock and straight preferred stock. Also, participating convertible preferred is effectively straight preferred and common stock.  \n\n(3) Cash flow rights, voting rights, control rights, and future financings are frequently contingent on observable measures of financial and non-financial performance. These state contingencies are somewhat more common in first VC and early stage financings.  \n\n(4) If the company performs poorly, the VCs obtain full control. As company performance improves, the entrepreneur retains / obtains more control rights. If the company performs very well, the VCs retain their cash flow rights, but relinquish most of their control and liquidation rights. The entrepreneur's cash flow rights also increase with firm performance.  \n\n(5) It is common for VCs to include non-compete and vesting provisions aimed at mitigating the potential hold-up problem between the entrepreneur and the investor. The vesting provisions are somewhat more common in early stage financings where it is more likely that the hold-up problem is more severe.  \n\n(6) Cash flow incentives, control rights, and contingencies implemented in these contracts are used more as complements than as substitutes.  \n\n### 6.2 Implications for theory  \n\nMany of the theories we consider explain different aspects of the results we find. However, several theories stand out. First, our results are most consistent with the control theories - such as Aghion and Bolton (1992) and Dewatripont and Tirole (1994). These control theories make predictions concerning cash flow rights that are similar to those made in traditional principal agent models - e.g., higher pay-performance sensitivity increases the weight entrepreneurs put on monetary benefits rather than private benefits. At the same time, these theories emphasize control rights that are contingent on measures of performance. The extensive use of and contracting on control rights in our sample is broadly consistent with these theories.  \n\nSecond, inalienability of human capital appears to be important as argued in Hart and Moore (1994). However, contractual remedies exist to mitigate the problems associated with inalienability. Also, these theories do not explain residual cash flow and control rights.  \n\nThird, various aspects of VC contracts clearly have the effect of helping VCs screen good entrepreneurs and companies from bad ones.  \n\nFinally, no one theory explains the multi-dimensional nature of the allocation of control rights we observe in these financings. Control rights are allocated across a number of dimensions - voting rights, board rights, liquidation rights. In addition, we find that those different control rights shift from VC to entrepreneur at different levels of performance. At very low levels of performance, the VC has the right to liquidate. At low levels of performance, the VC will typically have voting control and board control. As performance improves, the entrepreneur gains more cash flow rights as well as voting and board rights. As performance reaches a high level - i.e., a successful initial public offering - the VC's investment automatically converts into common stock and the VC relinquishes all the special control rights associated with its initial investment.  \n\nReferences   \nAdmati, Anat and Paul Pfleiderer, 1994, \"Robust Financial Contracting and the Role of Venture Capitalists\", Journal of Finance, 49, 371-402.   \nAghion, Phillippe, and Patrick Bolton, 1992,\"An incomplete contracts approach to financial contracting\", Review of Economic Studies, 77: 338-401.   \nAllen, Franklin, and Andrew Winton, 1995, \"Corporate financial structure, incentives, and optimal contracting\", in: Jarrow, R, VMaksimvic, and W.

Conversion price is the IPO or sale price per share of common stock at which the venture capital securities automatically convert into common stock. Round price is the price per share of common stock at which the securities issued in the current round convert or are piced. If a company subsequently issues equity at a lower price per share than the current round: under a full ratchet provision, the conversion price on the currentround drops to the new issue price; under a weighted-average provision, the conversion price of the current round declines to a value between the current round and the newissue price. Seed and start-up rounds differ from later stage rounds at the: $1\\%$ \\*\\*\\*； $5\\%**$ ,and $10\\%$ \\* levels.  \n\n# 1.

We use successful/uns. cessful exits from VC-financed entrepreneurial companies and number of patent zpplicatisns by VC-financed companies as proxies for VC firms’ performance. Consistent w;\\*h existing research on the inferior performance of SOEs relative to non-SOEs, we fira chat on average government-controlled VC firms (GVCs) underperform domes'ic pivate investors-controlled VC firms (PVCs). More importantly, we find that in'ro'ucing minority private investors (i.e., mixed ownership) helps improve the perform anc $\\mathbf{\\hat{\\Pi}}$ of GVCs. However, we find no evidence that introducing minority government investo 3 (i.e., mixed ownership) helps improve the performance of PVCs. Our results prr vi'e ielevant information to the ongoing debate on the role of the government invest srs ans. private investors in developing the VC industry in emerging markets.  \n\nKey words: venture capital; mixed ownership; performance; innovation; patents  \n\nJEL c0des: G24, G38, 031  \n\nData Availability: Data used in this study are publicly available from the sources identified in the paper.  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nPrior research shows that state owned enterprises (SOEs) are generally not as efficient as non-SOEs in resource allocation and firm performance (e.g., Boardman and Vining 1989; Ehrlich et al. 1994; Liu and Siu 2012). While privatization is believed to be the most effective approach to solving the inefficiency of SOEs (Shleifer 1998), many countries still maintain a significant list of SOEs in the name of national interests (OECD 2006; Kowalski et al. 2013). As an alternative approach, nu.ed ownership, where a business enterprise is jointly owned by both state capita! auu private capital, has often been suggested as a possible solution to the inefficit.rcy of SOEs (Garvin and Bosso 2008; OECD 2012; Yang 2017). While mixed owners'ip is popular around the world, the merits of such an organizational form are stil. 'iot.y debated around the world (Wang et al. 2017; Hodge and Greve 2016).  \n\nThe objective of this study is $\\cdot\\circ$ provide a direct assessment of the performance of mixed ownership in the Chin<re oe nture capital (VC) industry. Though started only around 1998, China's VC industry has since experienced explosive growth. More importantly, the past derat'? nas also observed the establishment of China's own nascent domestic VC indust, most notably, the creation of hundreds of VC firms partially or wholly funded by various government linked entities. Many of the government-linked Chinese VC firms are in the form of mixed ownership.  \n\nWhile theoretical justifications could be made for the government's intervention in the development of the VC industry and entrepreneurship (Hall 2002; Amit et al. 1998; Lerner 2010), it is still hotly debated whether and to what extent the government should be involved in the VC industry development (Lerner 2008, 2010). Much less is known on the performance of VC's mixed ownership in financing entrepreneurial companies, which are believed to be critical to a nation’s innovation and economic growth (Schumpeter 1934; Lerner 2010).  \n\nWe divide all domestic Chinese VC firms into two types, GVCs, defined as VC firms that receive the majority of their funding from either government agencies or statecontrolled enterprises (SOEs) or both, and PVCs, defined as vC firms that receive the majority of their funding from domestic private inve-tonc. GVCs  and  PVCs  are equivalent to SOEs and non-SOEs, respectively, in ti e traditional SOE literature. We further divide GVCs into two types, GVC1, defin. i as GVCs that receive all their funding from government agencies or SOE c' bth, and GVC2, defined as GVCs that receive some minority funding from pri ate investors. We also divide PVCs into two types, PVC1, defined as PVCs that ,\\*ceive all their funding from private investors, and PVC2, defined as PVCs that r\\~ei ·e some minority funding from government agencies and/or SOEs. GVC2 and $\\partial\\mathbf{\\Omega}^{\\setminus}\\mathbf{V}\\mathbf{C}^{\\prime}{}_{\\angle}$ are mixed ownership firms because they are jointly owned by the governmen\\* (including SOEs) and private investors. We also refer to GVC1, GVC2, and ?VC2 as government-linked VC firms because they all receive at least some funding from government-linked entities.  \n\nBefore we assess the performance of mixed ownership (i.e., GVC2 and PVC2), we first examine the performance of GVCs (i.e., GVC1+GVC2) versus PVCs (i.e., PVC1 $^+$ PVC2) because prior research tends to focus on the performance of GVCs and PVCs as a whole. Following prior research, we measure a VC firm's performance using two performance evaluation metrics: successful exit from a VC-financed entrepreneurial company and the number of patent applications filed by a VC-financed entrepreneurial company during the first two years since a VC firm's first round investment. We assume that all VCs care about these two performance indicators.? Following prior research (e.g., Nahata et al. 2014), we focus on the lead VC firm because it plays a dominant role in mentoring and monitoring the entrepreneurial company.  \n\nEx ante the relative performance of GVCs versus PVCs :s difficult to predict due to conflicting institutional forces. Conventional econom:\\~ ..sdom, referred to as the incentive hypothesis (Shleifer 1998; Lerner 2010), wot'd predict GVCs to underperform PVCs due to the well-known agency problems asso. ated with government ownership. For example, GVCs could pursue political age.?da' , which in turn could negatively affect GVCs’ managerial incentives. In a& itin, GVCs may find it difficult to use highpowered incentive compensation con\\*racts due to rigid government regulations (Chen et al. 2013). Therefore, managers ^f (V Cs may not have the same incentives as managers of PVCs to acquire private  forination in the selection of entrepreneurial companies for investment or closely monitr their funded companies.  \n\nOn the other i. \\*nd, GVCs may have a competitive advantage relative to PVCs due to their inherent government connections, referred to as the political connection hypothesis. China is a representative emerging market economy, where many important aspects of Chinese firms’ operations are significantly influenced by various government agencies, including input and output factor markets, taxes, bank and public equity financing, etc. Prior research shows that driven by various political and economic incentives such as political tournament and social stability (Li and Zhou 2005; Lin et al. 2004), local Chinese government officials have a strong incentive to provide a variety of preferential treatments to the Chinese SOEs under their jurisdictions, including information sharing, tax concessions and easy access to bank and public equity financing (Aharony et al. 2000; Brandt and Li 2003; Cull anr X. 2003). Because GVCs' performance depends on the success of their funde.' entrepreneurial companies, we expect GVC-funded companies to directly or indirec.'< benefit from GVCs′ government connections, especially the entrepreneuria' mpanies that are located in the same province as the GVCs’ headquarte of course, PVCs could partially offset this competitive disadvantage by estabn.ching their own political connections, making the relative performance of GVCs v<rst  PVCs difficult to predict ex ante.  \n\nOur sample contains \\~ 65 / Chinese entrepreneurial companies funded by 417 lead domestic VC firms over th period 2000-2009. Consistent with the extant broad literature on SOEs vs. non-SCEs and prior Chinese VC literature (e.g., Zhang and Mayes 2018), we find that GVCs significantly underperform PVCs in terms of successful exit. In terms of the quantity of annual patent applications filed by VC-funded companies over the first two years since the lead VC firm's first round investment, GVCs also underperform PVCs. Overall, these results suggest that the incentive hypothesis dominates the political connection hypothesis in explaining the underperformance of GVCs versus PVCs.  \n\nNext we examine whether mixed ownership can help improve the performance of GVCs by comparing the relative performance of GVC1 versus GVC2. Ex ante the answer is unclear because it is far from clear whether minority private investors have any significant influence in the operations of GVCs. With regard to successful exit, we find that both GVC1 and GVC2 underperform PVCs, but there is evidence that GVC2 significantly outperform GVC1. We find similar results for the quantity of annual patent applications but the results are not always significant. Overall, u \\*se results suggest that if properly structured, introducing minority private investor ra. significantly improve the performance of GVCs. However, the performance oi GVC2 is still inferior to that of PVCs, suggesting that complete privatization may st'\"i be the most effective remedy to GVCs' inefficiencies.  \n\nOur final analysis examines vhr .her mixed ownership can help improve the performance of PVCs by comparing the relative performance of PVC1 versus PVC2. Again the answer is unclear ex ant 'because introducing minority government investors has both costs and benefits  s nored in the incentive hypothesis and political connection hypothesis. Empirically w · find little evidence of a significant performance difference between PVC1 and ?VC2. These results suggest no evidence of a positive net benefit resulting from adding government minority investors in PVCs.  \n\nWe recognize the endogeneity of different types of VC firms and VC-financed entrepreneurial companies. We attempt to address the endogeneity challenge in several ways and find similar inferences. Despite our efforts, we acknowledge that our results could still be caused by the endogeneity of the VC ownership types and therefore the reader should interpret our results with caution.  \n\nWe contribute to two distinctive streams of literatures. Our first contribution is to the emerging literature on government-sponsored VC firms. As noted in a review paper by Da Rin et al. (2013), governments around the world support VC firms in a variety of ways, such as giving tax credits, matching funds that augment private capital commitments, and direct government ownership of VC funds, but research on the role of government policies remains scarce. With regard to government ownership of VC firms, there is a small literature on the performance consequences of g vernment ownership of VC firms. Our study differs from this extant literature in s-a. important ways.  \n\nFirst, we are the first study to compare the relative performance of mixed ownership VC firms (i.e., GVC2 and PVC2) versus o.'.er types of government-linked VC firms (i.e., GVC1 and PVC1) and find iver sting results new to the literature. Presumably due to data limitations, .or studies in the extant literature examine VC firms where the government is a min ?rity investor only, i.e., PVC2 (e.g., Wallsten 2000; Brander et al. 2010; Cumming ^nc iacIntosh 2004) or VC firms wholly owned by the government only, i.e., GVC: (e.g., Cumming et al. 2017). A notable exception is Brander et al. (2015) who examine th VC firms wholly owned by government entities (referred to as government-ow.rea VC firms or GOVCs) and privately owned VC firms in which there is a limited partner or other significant investor wholly owned by a government entity (referred to as government-supported VC firms or GSVCs). Brander et al.'s GOVCs are equivalent to our GVC1 while their GSVCs are similar to our PVC2. However, Brander et al. do not compare the performance of GVC1 versus PVC2. More importantly, they do not consider GVC2 and PVC1.  \n\nSecond, we are one of the first studies to examine the performance of government-sponsored VC firms in an emerging market. Most existing studies (e.g.. Cumming et al. 2017 and Brander et al. 2015) primarily focus on VC firms in developed countries. A priori it is unclear whether their findings are generalizable to VC firms in emerging markets where there is a lack of developed infrastructures and institutions necessary for efficient business operations (Khanna et al. 2010) and therefore the roles and performance of government-sponsored VC firms could t\\~ significantly different. Zhang and Mayes (2018) also examine the performar c GVCs but they do not distinguish GVC1 versus GVC2.  \n\nThird, because we focus on one single count. , we are able to invest significant effort to  develop  a  comprehensive  and ·ep esentative  sample  of  VC-financed entrepreneurial companies, thus red. cirg the concern of potential sample selection biases. This is a significant contribt cion because the two primary commercial VC data used by prior researchers, Thoic onOne (formerly known as VentureXpert) and VentureSource (formerly kn wn as VentureOne), are known for incomplete coverage and lack of details on the rovs\"d VC-funded companies (Kaplan et al. 2002; Maats et al. 2011; Da Rin et al. $2\\lambda^{1}3,$  \n\nOur findings carry important implications for the ongoing debate in China and many other emerging markets on how to support entrepreneurship and the local VC industry. The superior performance of PVCs relative to GVCs suggests the importance of supporting the development of PVCs so that they can play a more significant role in developing a nation's local VC industry and entrepreneurship. More importantly, the better performance of GVC2 relative to GVC1 also suggests that even if a local government wishes to develop the sector of GVCs, it can do better in performance by adopting a mixed ownership structure. On the other hand, the similar performance results for PVC1 and PVC2 suggest no evidence that PVCs can improve performance by introducing government investor capital as minority investors.  \n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses data sources and sample selection. Section 3 introduces the regression models. Section 4 examines the performance differences of GVCs versus PVCs as a whole. Section 5 reports the regression results for P3s (i.e., GVC1 versus GVC2 and pvC1 versus PVC2). Section 6 discusses several robustness checks. Section 7 concludc.  \n\n## 2. Data sources and sample selection  \n\n### 2.1. Data sources  \n\nThe data on VC firms and t.ir funded companies used in this study come from CVSOURCE, a leading VC ?rd or:vate equity database with an exclusive focus on China. Because VC firms ai not required to publicly disclose their investment portfolio data, the quality of data c. VC-funded companies from existing commercial databases commonly used in ths extant academic research has always been a concern (Kaplan et al. 2002; Maats et al. 2011; Da Rin et al. 2013). Our research indicates that CVSOURCE's coverage of VC-funded companies is relatively complete. Specifically, we compare the quantity of VC investment between CVSOURCE and The Annual Report on China's VC Industry Development, an authoritative year book jointly published by China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the government regulator of Chinese VC/PE firms during our sample period, and China Venture Capital & Private Equity  \n\nAssociation. According to an interim regulation on the Administration of VC Firms that took effect in early 2006, all VC firms operating in China have been required since 2006 to register with the relevant local government VC administration agency in order to be eligible for receiving various preferential government treatments such as tax concessions and government funding. According to a 2011 VC survey conducted by the NDRC in Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong, the regions with the most VC firms, only approximately $12.86\\%$ of the surveyed VC firms un'n't plan to register with the government (The Annual Report on China's VC Industy  velopment 2012, p.235).4 According to The Annual Report on China's VC i. dustry Development for the the available years 2006-2012, the total number of VC investment deals over the period 2006-2012 is 9,596. The comparable figurr α <co ding to CVSOURCE is 10,128.6 This comparison suggests that CVSOURCI 's overage of VC-funded companies is relatively complete.  \n\nWe rely on the inforratit  provided by CVSOURCE and a comprehensive Chinese company registrati  database developed by China's State Administration for Industry  and  Commer (SAIC)  to define the  VC ownershiptypes (http://gsxt.saic.gov.c.r). We obtain Chinese companies’ patent data from China's State Intellectual Property Rights Office (SIPO) and patent citation data from the Google Patent Citations database (www.google.com/patent). We use both computer programs and manual labor to match the companies in CVSOURCE with the companies in SIPO by company name. The data used to define the other regression variables come from CVSOURCE and other public sources noted in the appendix of variable definitions.  \n\n### 2.2. Sample selection  \n\nConsistent with the VC literature, we define a VC firm as a fund management entity that manages one or more VC funds. If a VC fund is formed as a limited partnership, which was permitted only after 2006 in China, the fund management entity refers to the general partners of the fund. If a VC fund i- t.ued as a corporation, the fund management entity refers to the management of thi. corporation.  \n\nWe define a VC firm's formation year  follows: (a) the year of the establishment for independent domestic VC fin -is: (b) the year of the first VC investment for non-independent domestic VC f -ms (e.g., those affiliated with existing business enterprises); (c) the year of the estaL!ishment for foreign VC firms with a specific focus on China or Asia if there is no crec fi  China focus; (d) the earlier of the year of the fund raising or the year of the Y'rst VC investment in China for the remaining foreign VC firms.  \n\nWe determint a VC firm's type based on the sources of all the VC funds raised as of the time of the VC firm's first round investment in an entrepreneurial company.7 If more than 50 percent of the VC firm's funds come from either government agencies or government-controlled business enterprises, the VC firm would be classified as a GVC. If more than 50 percent of the VC firm's funds come from domestic private sources, the VC firm would be classified as a PVC. If more than 50 percent of the VC firm's funds come from foreign sources, the VC firm would be classified as a FVC. If none of the above three types of fund sources contribute more than 50 percent of the VC firm's funds, the VC firm would be classified as a joint-venture (JVC).  \n\nFrom CVSOURCE we identified a total of 1,336 VC firms that were founded before year 2012, the last available year when our project started. We exclude year 2012 because there were only 21 VC firms formed in 2012, prot ably due to a delay in CVSOURCE's data collection. Because there is no cle= cc distinction between VC firms and private equity firms in CVSOURCE, we de.ine a VC firm as one whose VC investments constitute more than 50 percent of the i: an's total equity investments as of the end of 2012. Among the 1,336 VC firms, ?13 are GVCs, 620 are PVCs, and 389 are FVCs. There are only 2 JVCs. In adc -tic .1, due to missing data, we cannot identify the type for 12 VC firms. In the subseyuent analyses, we exclude the 2 JVCs and the 12 unidentified VC firms. These re<trit ti ons result in a sample of 1,322 VC firms.  \n\nTable 1 shows the istibution of the 1,322 VC firms. Panel A shows the distribution of the VC firn. oy founding year and type. It is clear that all three types of VC firm types experi. nced explosive growth over the past decade.  \n\nPanel B of Table 1 shows the distribution of the 1,322 VC firms by province and type. The province where a VC firm is located is defined as follows: (a) the province of the VC firm's headquarters for domestic VC firms and foreign VC firms whose headquarters are located in mainland China (1026); and (b) the province of the mainland China office (172) or the province of the first VC investment if there is no mainland China office information (124), for foreign VC firms whose headquarters are located outside mainland China. It may not be too surprising that the VC firms are concentrated in relatively developed regions of China: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang.  \n\nBecause the primary focus of the study is domestic VC firms (i.e., GVCs and PVCs), we exclude FVCs in the rest of the paper. We further divide GVCs into two types, GVC1, defined as GVCs that receive all their funding from government agencies or SOEs or both, and GVC2, defined as GVCs that receive son.? minority funding from private investors. We also divide PVCs into two types DvCi, defined as PVCs that receive all their funding from private investors, and P、C2, defined as PVCs that receive some minority funding from government agencies -ud/or SOEs. Consistent with the definitions of GVC and PVC, the definiticns of GVC1, GVC2, PVC1 and PVC2 are defined as of the time of each VC f.\\*m's first round investment in an entrepreneurial company. GVC2 and PVC2 are mixt.? ownership VCs and our targets of interest.  \n\n## 3. Research design  \n\nFollowing prio izarch, we measure a VC firm's performance using two performance evaluati n metrics defined below: exit (successful versus unsuccessful) from a VC-financed company (exit) and the number of patent applications filed by a VCfinanced company during the two years since a VC firm's first round investment (patent_number). Because the data required to calculate the actual returns on VC firms' invested portfolio of entrepreneurial companies are usually unobservable, we follow prior research (Gompers and Lerner 2000; Brander et al. 2002; Hochberg et al. 2007; Sorensen 2007; Zarutskie 2007; Nahata 2008) by using exit as one proxy for VC firm performance.  \n\nPhalippou and Gottschalg (2009) demonstrate a high positive correlation between successful exits and actual returns to venture capitalists, suggesting that exit should be a good proxy for VC firms’ performance.  \n\nCumming and Johan (2013) identify five common ways a VC firm may exit an investment in an entrepreneurial company: (i) initial Public Offering (IPO); (i) M&A, where both the entrepreneur and the VC firm sell their stake in the company to another company; (ii) secondary sale, where the VC firm sells its int.est but the entrepreneur does not sell his interest; (iv) management buyback, wher tu entrepreneur repurchases the stake held by the VC firm; and (v) liquidation of th. entrepreneurial company. While it is common in the U.S. VC literature to measure suie <ssful exits using IPOs and M&As only, VC firms in international VC marketr cfier exit successfully via secondary sales due to lack of access to the IPO mark t cr an underdeveloped M&A market. Therefore, our definition of successful exit inciides not only IPOs and M&As but also secondary sales, which is relatively freqr<nt ir. our sample as shown below.\\* In addition, to the extent possible, we also iden. ify VC firms’ unsuccessful exits in the form of management buyback and liquidatio C\". discussion with Chinese VC industry insiders suggests that management buybac, is typically viewed as a failure of VC investments. Because many VC firms may not have an incentive to voluntarily disclose liquidations of their funded entrepreneurial companies, we use a recently available company database from China's State Administration of Industry and Commerce (SAIC) to identify the majority of the liquidations in our sample.  \n\nBy definition, a primary objective of VC firms is to fund early-stage innovative but risky entrepreneurial companies. Hence, we also measure a VC firm's performance using a second proxy, patent_number, which reflects the degree of a VC-funded company's innovation. While not every innovation is patented and not every patent leads to successful economic activity, patenting and successful innovation are highly correlated and therefore patents are commonly used as a measure of innovation in the existing VC literature. To avoid potential confounding effects, we measure patent_number using only the patents filed within the first two years since a VC firm's first investment.  \n\n### 3.1. Successful exit versus unsuccessful exit  \n\nWe use the following multinomial logit modei (hazard analysis) to compare the differences in successful and unsuccessful exits $\\mathrm{amon}_{\\mathfrak{z}}$ ne VCfirm types: $e x i t=\\nu c$ ownershiptype $^+$ control + e; (1)  \n\nSee the Appendix for all variabl· ?efinitions. The unit of observation is an entrepreneurial company-year. vc ow.rership type refers to either $g\\nu c$ or $g\\nu c l,g\\nu c2$ , and pvcl (more details in the following ctions). gvc is a dummy variable that equals one if the lead VC firm in the firs. round VC investment is a GVC and zero otherwise. $g\\nu c l$ ， gvc2, and pvcl are defined in a similar fashion. The regression model's sample starts from the first year $\\mathbf{W_{L}}\\mathbf{,\\lambda^{2}}\\mathbf{n}$ an entrepreneurial company receives the first VC investment and ends in the earlier of the year of the VC firm's successful or unsuccessful exit or 2012, the last available year. To make sure that a VC firm has sufficient time to exit, we retain only the entrepreneurial companies whose first VC investment occurred no later than 2009. We choose a cutoff of 2009 because the typical investment cycle of emerging market VC investments is 2-3 years (Fang, 2006; Qian and Zhang, 2007), but inferences are similar we use a cutoff of 2008 or 2007 (untabulated).  \n\nWhile an entrepreneurial company may receive VC financing from multiple VC firms in both the first round investment and subsequent follow-up investments, typically there is a lead VC firm for each entrepreneurial company who plays a dominant role in mentoring and monitoring the entrepreneurial company. Hence, we follow prior research by focusing on the lead VC firm in this study (e.g., Nahata et al. 2014), but we control for the effect of VC syndicate in the subsequent empirical analyses.\" For each entrepreneurial company, we define the lead VC firm as the firm that makes the 'argest investment in the first round VC investment, consistent with prior researc i caiata 2008; Brander et al 2015; Cumming et al. 2017).1° If an entrepreneurial co.\\*oany has more than one lead VC firm, we take the average of each relevant variable for 'ue tied lead VC firms.  \n\nFor the 313 GVCs and 620 PV'Cr f:om Table 1, we identified 1,840 entrepreneurial companies? first rount inr estment deals involving 504 VC firms during our sample period 2000-2009. Due t data limitation, we don't consider VC firms′ first round investments that occurr<d or:or to 2000. After excluding 121 entrepreneurial companies whose lead VC \\*irms couldn't be identified due to missing first round VC investment amount, we ottan 1,719 entrepreneurial companies involving 425 lead VC firms. After excludu. $\\cdot\\mathrm{\\bfg}$ observations with other missing variables, our final sample contains 1,657 entrepreneurial companies associated with 417 lead VC firms, involving 10,243 entrepreneurial company-year observations over the period 2000-2012.11  \n\nThe regression model includes the following four types of common control variables: (a) characteristics of the entrepreneurial companies (early, priorpatent, priorcitation);2 (b) select characteristics of the lead VC firms (vc_lp, synsize, vc_exp, vc_repu, vc_network); (c) initial vc investment year fixed effects to control for the degree of market condition, such as competition among VC firms for investment opportunities (Hochberg et al. 2007; Nahata 2008), in the year of a lead VC firm's first investment in an entrepreneurial company; and (d) market condition, inci.ding local institutional environment such as investor protection in the province of au <atrepreneurial company's headquarters (enlocal_invpro) and the market conditic. in the year of a VC firm's exit (exit _condition) (Lerner 1994; Hochberg et al. $200\\mathrm{\\uparrow}$ , \\*vahata 2008). We also include the standard industry and year fixed effects. Vne'1 assessing the impact of VC firms ownership structure on firm performa. ce it is important to control for the differences in entrepreneurial company characterist:'cs because different types of VC firms may pursue different investment strategies Fo. cxample, some VC firms may only focus on early stage entrepreneurial compa ies. By definition, it takes longer for VC firms to exit from such investments, evan 'i they are successful. Without controlling for such entrepreneurial comp.ny characteristics, we would unfairly penalize the performance of VC firms that have invested in early stage entrepreneurial companies. Likewise, we should also control for other VC firm characteristics that could be correlated with VC firms’ ownership structure. Finally, it is necessary to control for the market conditions at both the entry time and exit time of a lead VC firm that are beyond the control of individual VC firms.  \n\nDue to lack of strong priors, we don't have any predictions on the regression coefficients for unsuccessful exits. With regard to successful exits, we make the following predictions based on prior research. We expect the coefficient on early to be negative because entrepreneurial companies in the early stage tf development are likely to be riskier and therefore could be less likely to succeed. we clso expect the coefficients on priorpatent and priorcitation to be positive to the extent that entrepreneurial companies with more patents and higher patent ci. aons prior to the first round VC investment indicate better quality. Even tho 'zh limited partnership is the prevailing organization form of VC funds in the 1.s (Sahlman, 1990), it is permitted in China only since 2007. To control for the possit'e influence of VC organization type on VC firms' performance, we include vc_/, lio:lowing Casamatta and Haritchabalet (2007) and Brander et al. (2002), we cntrol for the size of VC syndicate in the first round VC investment (synsize). Pastd on the evidence from the literature, we predict a positive coefficient for vc_lp t nd synsize. We also expect the coefficients on $\\nu c\\_e x p,\\nu c\\_r e p u$ and vc_network to be significantly positive based on prior research (Lee and Wahal 2004; Nahata 2008; Hochberg et al. 2007 and 2010). Following Lerner (1994), Hochberg et al. (2007) and Nahata (2008), we predict a positive coefficient on exit_condition because VCs are more likely to exit successfully during times of favorable market conditions. We have no prediction for enlocal_invpro.  \n\n### 3.2. Patent applications  \n\nWe also examine whether the VC firm types differ in the number of patent applications filed by VC-funded companies during the first two years since a lead VC's initial round investment:  \n\npatent_number VC ownership type control + e;  \n\nSee the Appendix for variable definitions. To reduce t'e influence of potential confounding effects, patent_number and other related pat-at .ariables introduced below are measured over the first two years after a lead VC fin n's initial round investment in an entrepreneurial company (Nanda and Rhodes-Krop z013). China has three types of patents: patents for invention, patents for u.\"'itv model, and patents for design. The protection period for invention paten.s ir twenty years while the protection period for utility model patents and design pau nts is only ten years, counted from the application date (http://english.sipo.gov.cn/> T.e approval of invention patents is more rigorous and takes longer than the othe. two types of patents. Our definition of patent_number includes the invention rate.ts and utility model patents filed over a two-year period since the lead VC firm's I'\\*st round investment. Because invention patents take longer to be approved, patent_number includes both approved and unapproved invention patents but only approved patents for the utility model patents. We exclude design patents from patent_number because this classification type is unique to China and is often deemed low in innovation quality. Inferences are similar if design patents are included in the definition of patent_number.  \n\nPatent applications are particularly interesting to study in China because the Chinese Government has been adopting a variety of proactive policies and incentives to encourage Chinese firms and VC funds to innovate, especially in the form of filing patent applications (Chan 2015; Chen 2015). The Chinese Government even made an explicit call for local Chinese firms to apply for two million patents by 2015 (The Economist 2014). Being government-controlled, GVCs are expected to be more responsive to the Chinese Government's order. However, due to conflicting instiutional forces discussed in the Introduction, it is an open question whether GVC ran. outperform non-GVCs in patent filings.  \n\nThere is anecdotal evidence suggesting th.' some Chinese firms may have resorted to filing many lower quality patent ${\\mathrm{\\Delta}}^{\\mathrm{\\Delta}}\\mathrm{P}_{\\mathrm{\\mathbf{i}}}^{\\mathrm{\\Delta}}$ ic.tions such as utility model patents and design patents in response to the Ch. es : Government's order (The Economist 2014). Hence, we consider three alternat.e definitions of patent performance measures to mitigate the potential noises as-oci at ed with patent_number. To the extent that a firm's main objective of filing a pa. \\*nt application is to satisfy the Chinese Government's order, we expect the firm to bav. 'ess incentive to pay the required annual maintenance fee to keep the patent activt in the years subsequent to the initial patent application. Hence, we use active_patent_number as an alternative definition of patent performance, which includes only the invention and utility model patents still active as of April 2014, the date when we collected the patent data. Recognizing that the approval process for invention patents is more rigorous and takes longer, firms whose main objective of filing a patent application is to satisfy the Chinese Government's order should be less likely to submit invention patents. Hence, we also use the number of invention patent applications (invent_patent_number) as another alternative innovation performance measure. Finally, if a firm's main objective of filing a patent application is to satisfy the Chinese Government's order, the quality of the patents filed by such firms is likely to be lower. We use patent_citation as a proxy for the quality of filed patent applications. Because the Google Patent Citations database excludes design patents, the least important type, our definition of patent_citation includes invention patents and utility model patents only.  \n\nThe unit of observation for model (2) is an entrepreneun:al company. The sample is limited to the same entrepreneurial companies used in th iriession model of Table 2. For the same reasons as in Section 3.1, we cc.rtrol for the characteristics of entrepreneurial companies (early, priorpatent, priorci: ion) and the select characteristics of the lead VC firms (vc_lp, synsize, vc_exr, 'epu, vc_network). We also control for entrepreneurial companies? local envii nr ental factors that may affect patent application number and citations, including locai investor protection (enlocal_invpro), the local R&D talent and R&D investment (lo\\~al_o.ent, local_R&D). We predict a positive coefficient for enlocal_invpro, local i.'ent and local_R&D. As usual, we include the standard industry fixed effects. $\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathbf{I}_{\\cap}\\quad,\\mathbf{J}}\\end{array}$ lition, we include the fixed effects of initial vc investment year to control for a.v time effects associated with a VC firm's first investment in an entrepreneurial company.  \n\n## 4. GVC versus PVC  \n\nTo benchmark with prior studies that assess the performance of SOEs versus nonSOEs, we first compare the performance for GVCs ( $\\mathrm{GVC1+GVC2},$ versusPvCs (PVC1+PVC2).  \n\n### 4.1. Regression results for model (1)  \n\nPanel A of Table 2 reports the frequencies of successful exits and unsuccessful exists by VC firm type during our entire sample period. There are a total of 515 exit events, of which $89.3\\%$ (460) are successful exists and the remaining $10.7\\%$ (55) are unsuccessful exits. Most prior U.S. research ignores unsuccessful exits due to lack of data, but our evidence above suggests this omission could be p.oblematic in our sample because unsuccessful exits constitute a significant per-u\\*-ge of all exits. Of the successful exits, $21.5\\%$ (99/460) are in the form of sect ndary sales that would be ignored if one follows the traditional definition of successfin xit used in the U.s. VC literature. The distributions of the various types of evi.< ar different across the VC firm types. More specifically, among all observet. ex.is during our sample period, the percentage of exits that are unsuccessful is higher for GVCs than for PVCs. On the other hand, among all observed successful exits d\"ing ar sample period, the percentage of successful exits in the form of IPO is lower i r G VCs than for PVCs.  \n\nPanel B of Tabia  \"eports the descriptive statistics for the regression variables. Untabulated analysis shows that approximately $4.5\\%$ of the firm years included in the regression model represent successful exits while $0.5\\%$ of the firm years are unsuccessful exits. Among the 1,657 unique VC-funded companies in Panel B of Table 989 $(59.7\\%)$ are funded by GVCs, and 668 $(40.3\\%)$ are funded by PVCs, suggesting that GVCs are more active than PVCs in investment activities in our sample period. The value of synsize at the $75^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile is zero, suggesting that most domestic VC firms in China go solo in investment, a finding different from the U.S. literature (Gompers and Lerner 2004).  \n\nPanel C of Table 2 shows the industry distribution of the VC-invested entrepreneurial companies for the GVCs versus PVCs used in Table 2. While there are significant differences in the types of industries invested by GVCs versus PVCs, both types of VCs concentrate their investments in the following five industries (the percentages of the invested companies by GVCs versus PVCs): Information transmission, computer  services,  and  software( $13.549\\%$ Vs. $18.862\\%$ ，Manufacturing of communication computers, equipment and other electronic c uipment ( $15.571\\%$ Vs. $10.030\\%$ ), Manufacturing of raw chemical materials and cu:cal products ( $11.122\\%$ Vs. $11.078\\%$ 0, Manufacturing of special purpose ma.chinery $(8.999\\%$ VS. $6.886\\%$ Manufacturing  of  electrical  machinery  and  equip. ·cnt $(6.067\\%$ Vs. $7.335\\%$ ). This evidence suggests that both types of VCs are on peting for investment opportunities in the same industries.  \n\nPanel D of Table 2 shows ta? regression results of the multinomial logit model where the firm years without n evi. event are the default benchmark group. Our key variable of interest is gvc, a umny that equals one if the lead VC firm in the first round VC investment is a $\\mathbf{G}\\mathbf{V}\\mathbf{{\\calC}}_{\\mathrm{~,~}\\mathbf{\\Lambda}\\mathbf{\\Lambda}\\mathbf{\\Lambda}^{\\star}\\mathbf{{\\cal{A}}}}$ zero if the lead VC firm in the first round VC investment is a PVC. With regard t successful exits, we find that the coefficient on gvc is significantly negative, suggesting that that PVCs outperform GVCs. With regard to unsuccessful exits, the coefficient on gvc is not significant. Hence, there is no evidence of a significant difference in unsuccessful exits for GVCs and PVCs. Overall, our regression results clearly indicate that PVCs outperform GVCs in successful exits.  \n\nWith regard to the control variables, many of them are significant and consistent with our predictions. Specifically, the coefficients on two entrepreneurial company characteristics, early and priorpatent, are significant and consistent with expectations for successful exits, suggesting that entrepreneurial companies that received the first round VC investment in their early stage and lower-quality entrepreneurial companies measured prior to the lead VC firm's first round investment are less likely to exit successfully, ceteris paribus. The coefficient on synsize for successful exits is significant and consistent with expectation, suggesting that entrepreneurial companies funded by a larger VC syndicate in the first round investment are more likely to vit successfully, ceteris paribus. It is interesting to note that the coefficient on vc_\"-nu i significantly positive for both successful exits and unsuccessful exits. Finally, ti. e coefficient on exit_condition is significantly positive for successful exits, suggestn.  that external market conditions matter in VC-funded companies’ succesrft' ekit. Most of the control variables' coefficients are insignificant for unsuc ess ul exits.  \n\n### 4.2. Regression results for mod (2 )  \n\nTable 3 shows the reression results of model (2). Panel A shows the descriptive statistics of the regrersic? variables. The mean value of patent_number is 1.134, suggesting that the a 'erage VC-funded company has two patent applications $(\\mathrm{e}^{(1.134)}{-1})$ per year over the two-year period from the lead VC firm's first round investment. The mean value of active_patent_number is very close to that of patent_number, suggesting that most patents are actively maintained. The mean value of invent_patent_number is approximately two thirds of the mean value of patent_number, suggesting that the majority of the patent applications are the higher quality invention patents.  \n\nPanel B shows the OLS regression results of model (2) for the dependent variables patent_number, active_patent_number, invent_patent_number, and patent_citation, respectively. The coefficients on $g\\nu c$ are significantly negative for both patent_number and active_patent_number and marginally significantly negative for invent_patent_number (two-tailed $\\mathtt{p=0.119},$ .  These results  suggest  that   the entrepreneurial companies funded by PVCs outperform those funded by GVCs in terms of total number of patent applications. In addition, we find no vidence that the average patent quality (patent_citation) is significantly different f<\\~ tu. two VC firm types. This evidence implies that the higher number of total patent applications for PVCs is not due to the submission of lower quality patent applications ' / PVCs.  \n\nWith regard to the control variables in 'no lel (2), several of them are significant and consistent with our predictions. M.ost noteworthy is the significantly positive coefficient on priorpatent, suggestin.g the persistence of corporate innovation success. The coefficient on synsize is <'so cgnificantly positive in the first three regressions, suggesting the importance o.: VC syndicate in the innovation performance of VC firmsfunded entrepreneurial cc.panies. The coefficient on enlocal_invpro is significantly positive in all the i. gressions, suggesting that a region's investor protection have a positive impact on the region's VC-funded companies′ innovation output.  \n\n## 5. The relative performance of mixed ownership VCs  \n\nWe next examine the performance of mixed ownership VCs by comparing the performance of GVC1 versus GVC2 and PVC1 versus PVC2.  \n\n### 5.1. Regression results for model (1)  \n\nPanel A of Table 4 provides the descriptive statistics on the distribution of the VC-funded entrepreneurial companies across the four VC firm types. There are sufficient number of observations for each VC firm type, but GVC1 has the largest number of financed entrepreneurial companies. If one defines GVC1, GVC2, and PVC2 as government-sponsored VC firms, the number of entrepreneurial companies funded by government-sponsored VC firms would constitute approximateiy $72\\%$ of all VC-funded companies in our sample. This finding is different from th. 1.s. VC industry, suggesting the significant influence of the Chinese government-lin.'ed entities in the development of China's VC industry.  \n\nPanel B shows the regression results oi 'no lel (1) for the four VC firm types. The key variables of interest are gvcl, gv 2, .nd pvcl. The definitions of gvcl, gvc2, pvcl, and pvc2 are defined similarly to tha\\* of gvc above. We use pvc2 as our benchmark and therefore the coefficient on $p^{\\ldots}2$ ( suppressed in the multinomial logit model. With regard to the performance coniparison for GVC1 versus GVC2, we find that the coefficient  on  gvcl ic $\\operatorname{S1}_{\\boldsymbol{\\mathsf{E}}}\\mathbf{r}$ ficantly more negative than the coefficient on gvc2 for successful exits, sugg \\~sting that introducing minority private investors helps improve the odds of GVCs’ successful exits. On the other hand, the coefficient on gvcl is also significantly more negative than the coefficient on $g\\nu c{2}$ for unsuccessful exits, suggesting that introducing minority private investors also increases the variance of GVCs' performance. However, Panel A of Table 2 shows that unsuccessful exits still represent only the minority of all exits, and therefore we conclude from the above overall regression results that introducing minority private investors helps improve the performance of GvCs.  \n\nDespite the better performance of GVC2 relative to GVC1, it is still important to note that GVC2s still underperform PVCs. Specifically, the coefficient on gvc2 is significantly negative for successful exits. In addition, the coefficient on gvc2 is significantly more negative than the coefficient on pvcl for successful exits.  \n\nWith regard to the performance comparison for PVC1 v. rsus PVC2, we find that the coefficient pvcl is not significant for both successf! eaits and unsuccessful exits. Hence, we find no evidence that introducing mint.ity government investors helps improve the performance of PVCs. This finding is in cesting because it is different from the results for GVC1 versus GVC2.  \n\n### 5.2. Regression results for model (2)  \n\nPanel C of Table 4 shov# tl α egression results of model (2) for the four VC firm types. With regard to the pe. formiance comparison for GVC1 versus GVC2, we find that the coefficient on $g\\nu c^{\\prime}\\lambda\\iota$ lways more negative than the coefficient on gvc2 in the regressions of paten_ number, active_patent_nuber, and invent_patent_number but they are not significantly different from each other. Overall, these results provide at best very weak evidence that introducing minority private investors helps improve the innovation productivity of GVCs.  \n\nWith regard to the performance comparison for PVC1 versus PVC2, we find that the coefficient on pvcl is insignificant in all the patent models except for invent_patent_number. Hence, consistent with the regression results in section 5.1, there is litle evidence that introducing minority government investors helps improve the innovation productivity of PVCs.  \n\n### 5.3. Summary  \n\nOverall, the regression results in section 5.1 and 5.2 portray a consistent picture with regard to the role of mixed ownership. First, introducing minority private investors helps improve the performance of GVCs. Second, there is no vidence that introducing minority government investors helps improve the performncs sf PVCs. The asymmetry of the results for GVCs and PVCs is interesting and pi vides relevant information to the ongoing debate on the reform of Chinese SOEs in gen, cal.  \n\n## 6. Further analyses  \n\nWe perform several additioral tests to assess the robustness of our primary regression results in sections 4 ^\\~d  \n\n### 6.1. First round VC invsu.'At amount  \n\nPrior researci. suggests that larger VC investments are associated with better entrepreneurial company quality (Gompers 1995; Makela and Maula 2006). Since VC firms’ total first round investment amount is missing for a significant number of our sample entrepreneurial companies, we exclude this variable from the regression tables 2- 4. As a robustness check, we now include the total first round VC investment (vc investment amount) as a control variable in model (1) and report the results in Panel A of Table 5. Even though the sample size drops substantially, the inferences from Panel A of  \n\nTable 5 are almost identical to those from Tables 2-4.14 One noticeable exception is that the significant results for gvcl vs. gvc2 for unsuccessful exits in Table 4 are no longer significant in Table 5.  \n\n### 6.2. VC firm's investment horizon  \n\nWhile we believe that the hazard model specification in Tables 2 and 4 is preferred due to the right censoring of VC firm exit, one count argue that different VC firms have different fixed holding periods and therefore th\\~ s<cessful and unsuccessful exit rates could be deflated for VC firms with longer colding periods.1 To address this concern, we also follow Brander et al. (2015) by es\"cinating model (1) using only one observation per entrepreneurial company. exit_ on lition is measured as before but all the other control variables are measured &- th ? time of the lead VC's initial investment. The results of this alternative model (i) are shown in Panel B of Table 5. None of our inferences in Tables 2 and 4 are ig. ificantly altered.  \n\n### 6.3. Foreign minority invest rs  \n\nOur definitio. \\~ of GVC2 and PVC2 may contain minority ownership by foreign investors. To rule out the possibility that our results could be contaminated by the inclusion of such foreign ownership, we also remove 154 entrepreneurial companies that are funded by GVC2 with foreign minority investor ownership and 21 entrepreneurial companies that are funded by PVC2 with foreign minority investor ownership. The results are reported in Table 6. None of our inferences are affected.  \n\n### 6.4. Endogeneity of VC ownership types  \n\nOne of the key unresolved challenges in assessing the causal impact of ownership structure on firm performance is the endogeneity of ownership structure (Himmelberg et al. 1999). Prior research shows that it is difficult to deve'op credible exogenous instruments for ownership structure (Coles et al. 2012). O# s-dy is no exception to this challenge. Specifically, the ownership structure of Vc firms could be endogenous. For example, GVCs could be more prevalent in pi、 vinces with weaker institutional environments and therefore GVCs tend to pe1?rr poorly. In addition, the types of VCfunded entrepreneurial companies cot 4 F systematically different for GVCs and PVCs due to self selection. For example, GvCs may prefer to invest in early stage and therefore riskier entrepreneurial companj\\~\\~ 1  ling to lower performance.  \n\nWe attempt to addre s the endogeneity challenge in several ways. First, to the extent possible, we controi for the observable VC firm characteristics and entrepreneurial company characteris.\\*cs (see section 3), mitigating the concern that the performance differences across the VC ownership types are due to differences in the characteristics of VC firms or VC-financed entrepreneurial companies.  \n\nSecond,  we check whether the geographic distributions are systematically different for the GVCs and PVCs. As shown in Panel B of Table 1, the majority of both GVCs and PVCs are located in the five most developed provinces (i.e., Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu), but the percentage is significantly higher for  \n\nPVCs than for GVCs ( $64.22\\%$ for GVCs and $82.74\\%$ for PVCs and $\\chi^{2}\\mathrm{~p~}$ value ${\\it\\Omega}=0.000,$ Untabulated statistics also show that the percentage of VCs located in the five most developed provinces is $56.90\\%$ for GVC1, $79.25\\%$ for GVC2, $83.17\\%$ for PVC1, and $80\\%$ for PVC2. The difference is significantly different for GVC1 versus GVC2 $(\\mathbb{X}^{2}\\mathrm{~p~}$ value ${:=}0.005\\$ ） but not significant for PVC1 versus PVC2 $(\\chi^{2}$ p value=0.627). These descriptive statistics suggest that GVCs tend to be located in provinces with weaker institutional environments, which could explain the weaker pt.-formance of GVCs. To address this concern, we have already controlled for en'ru'_cnvpro, local_talent, and local_R&D in all relevant tables. To more effectively csntrol for location-related omitted variables, we further include an entrepreneurial $\\mathrm{{co}\\it{m}_{\\mathrm{{t}}}}$ any's province fixed effects in the regressions of Table 4 so that any location sre iic fixed effects would be fully controlled for. As shown in Table 7, we find the sar.e inferences as in Table 4. In addition, we run the tests in Tables 2-4 by limiting cur sample to the five provinces with the most VC firms. As shown in Table 8, we finc cualitatively similar inferences.  \n\nFinally, we use a oropensity score matching approach to deal with the endogeneity concern $\\mathbf{e^{+}V\\Sigma^{\\widehat{\\mathbf{\\Gamma}}}}$ Jwnership types. Specifically, we first obtain the propensity scores for each entre,reneurial company observation in the year of the lead VC's initial investment by regressing gvc on all the relevant explanatory variables of models (1) and (2) in the year of the lead VC's initial investment. The list of the explanatory variables include early, priorpatent, priorcitation, vc_lp, synsize, vc_exp, vc_repu, vc_network, exit_condition enlocal_invpro, local_talent, local_R&D Industry and Initial vc investment year. Second, we match with replacement each $g\\nu c{=}1$ observation with a $g\\nu c{=}0$ observation with the closest propensity score. We require the difference of the matched pair's propensity scores to be less than $1\\%$ . We successfully obtained 970 matched pairs of GVCs and non-GVCs. Finally, we repeat our primary regression results in Tables 2-4 using these matched pairs. As shown in Table 9, we obtain similar inferences for both performance measures.  \n\n## 7. Conclusion  \n\nWe examine the impact of mixed ownership on the per'ormance of Chinese VC firms. Broadly speaking, we can divide all domestic Chi-st 'C firms into two types, GVCs and PVCs. GVCs are VC firms that receive ti.? majority of their funding from either government agencies or government-controllec 'usiness enterprises or both. PVCs are VC firms that receive the majority of their nd ing from domestic private sources. We can further divide GVCs into two tyf \\*s, GVC1, defined as GVCs that receive all their funding from government agencies t SOEs or both, and GVC2, defined as GVCs that receive some minority funding fror yrivate investors. We can also divide PVCs into two types, PVC1, defined as PV <s tuat receive all their funding from private investors, and PVC2, defined as PVCe ti ?7 receive some minority funding from government agencies and/or SOEs. GVC2 . na PVC2 are mixed ownership VC firms.  \n\nWe measure a VC firm's performance using both the VC firm's successful/unsuccessful exit from its invested entrepreneurial companies and the quantity of patent applications filed during the two years since the first round VC investment.  \n\nConsistent with existing research on the performance of SOEs versus non-SOEs, we find that GVCs as a whole significantly underperform PVCs for both performance metrics. More importantly, however, we find that GVC2 helps improve the performance of GVCs. Specifically, we find that GVC2s outperform GVC1s for successful exits, suggesting that introducing minority private investors to GVCs helps improve the performance of GVCs. On the other hand, we find no evidence that PVC1s differ from PVC2s in performance for both performance metrics, suggesting that introducing minority government investors to PVCs fails to improve the performance of PVCs.  \n\nThe findings of our study should be of interest to the ongoing debate on the costs and benefits of introducing mixed ownership in the VC industiy development. This issue is particularly relevant in many emerging countries where che YC industry is nascent and therefore the government often plays a bigger role in de eloping the VC industry.  \n\nPrior research shows that VC firms contrib.'< to the financial performance of entrepreneurial companies in two important α \\* vs (i) identify promising entrepreneurial companies for investment (i.e., selec.or ability); and (ii) monitor the performance of invested entrepreneurial companies (i.e., monitoring ability). In this study we examine the overall financial performarre (f VC firms with differential government ownership. Due to data limitations, we 'on't attempt to distinguish VC firms’ selection ability from their monitoring abilitv w' 'eave this unresolved issue to future research.  \n\nWe have als implicitly assumed that all  VC firms care about financial performance. While it is reasonable to assume that PVCs care about the ultimate financial performance of their invested entrepreneurial companies. This assumption may not hold for GVCs because GVCs may have not only financial but also non-financial objectives. As a result, using financial performance indicators to judge the success of GVCs may not be appropriate. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain data on the non-financial performance goals and indicators of GVCs. We leave this unresolved issue to future research.  \n\n# Author statement  \n\nBin Ke: Conceptualization, Methodology, Formal Analysis, Writing- Original draft, Writing- Reviewing and Editing, Supervision Lanfang Wang: Conceptualization, Software, Formal Analysis, Investigation, Data  \n\ncuration, Visualization, Validation, Funding acquisition  \n\n# REFERENCES  \n\nAharony, J., Lee, C.W. and Wong, T.J.
