Although since the term “informal employment\" was coined in the early 1970s the literature has proposed various definitions, from the viewpoint of workers (as opposed to firms) the consensus seems to be that workers who are not covered by social protection, such as social security, or who work without a wage contract are considered to be informal (World Bank 2013, p. 64). In taking this definition to data from labor force or employment surveys, workers who are self-employed or salaried without social security benefits are considered to be informal. According to the World Bank (2013), existing global studies of the incidence of informal employment in developing countries suggest that informality rates range between 40 and 80 percent of the employed labor force. Similarly, in the data from Labor Force Surveys from Brazil and Mexico used in this paper, the informal-employment share exceeds 40 percent of the labor force in Brazil, and it is almost 60 percent in Mexico.  \n\nMore importantly, the large informal employment shares in developing countries has inspired decades of research aiming to understand the causes of informality and more broadly the functioning of developing-country labor markets. One strand of the literature emerged in the late 1990s out of concerns about the role of international integration as a determinant of informality in developing economies.  \n\nGoldberg and Pavcnik (2003) examined the impact of trade liberalization implemented in the 1980s and 1990s in Brazil and Colombia. They found that trade reforms had no relationship with changes in informal employment in Brazil, and found weak evidence that trade reforms caused an increase in informal employment in Colombia. Bosch and Maloney (2010) studied labor market dynamics in three large Latin America countries, namely Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. They explored labor dynamics using statistical markov processes of individual workers’ trajectories across sectors from labor force surveys. The authors found evidence that self-employed workers are typically characterized by “voluntary entry to informality” while informal salaried workers are more likely to be excluded from the formal sector.  \n\nMore recently, several authors have developed and estimated dynamic discrete choice models to study the impact of trade liberalization on labor reallocations, wages and welfare 1. Artuc et al. (2010) study the impact of trade liberalization on the US labor market. The authors find low labor mobility in response to trade liberalization. They simulated a 30% reduction of tariffs in the manufacturing sector, and found that 95% of the labor reallocation in the entire economy would take place in eight years after the reform. This growing literature, however, has focused on worker fows across industries ignoring one of the main characteristics of labor markets in developing countries, the existence of a large informal sector. This paper seeks to contribute to the literature by explicitly modeling workers’ decision to move both across sectors and employment status.  \n\nThe model proposed herein is empirically tractable, requiring only worker employment transitions across industries and employment status from labor-force surveys with panel data. With these estimates of labor mobility costs, we use simulations of changes in labor demand across sectors to study labor-market adjustments caused by a reduction in the relative price of manufactures that could be brought about by trade liberalization or other trade-related persistent shocks, such as the growth of Chinese exports in global markets. The results suggest that inter-industry labor mobility costs are large but entry costs into informal employment tends to be significantly lower than the costs of entry into formal employment. Consequently, declines in prices raise real wages and thus increase labor fows into the labor market but with disproportionate entry into informal employment. The share of informal employment rises after trade liberalization (or other price-reducing shocks) but this is due predominantly to entry into the labor market rather than displacement out of the affected industry.  \n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. The following section 2 briefy places the modeling approach in the context of the existing literature about the causes of informality. The structural model is presented in Section 3. The data from Labor Force Surveys used for the estimation of the structural parameters of the model is discussed in Section 4, which also includes a discussion of the data used in the simulations. Section 5 presents the results from the estimations as well as from the simulations. Section 6 concludes.  \n\n# 2 Informality and Mobility Costs  \n\nThere are two leading views about fundamental drivers of informal employment in developing countries. The first view argues that workers in the informal sector have been excluded from the formal sector by some sort of barrier to entry, such as labor market rigidities and excessive regulation. This view is associated with the early work of De Soto (1989), and was labelled the “romantic\"” view by Laporta and Shleifer (2008) as it emphasizes that informal employment “is potentially extremely productive, and is held back by government taxes and regulation, as well as by lack of secure property rights and access to finance'\" (La Porta and Shleifer, 2008).  \n\nThe second view has its origins in the work of Lucas (1978) and Rauch (1991) on managerial skills and entrepreneurial ability. This approach views informality as the result of a self-selection decision that maximizes individuals’ comparative advantage in each sector. Under this rational-choice view, workers and firms optimally choose the sector based on expected pecuniary and non-pecuniary benefits associate with each sector.  \n\nThe model presented in this paper captures the two views of informality. We incorporate workers’ decision to enter the informal sector in a dynamic discrete choice model with rational expectations. The model is an extension of Artuc et al. (2010). In each period, workers choose the industry in which they prefer to work and under which employment status. The key parameter of the model is the perceived mobility cost of a particular sector and formality status. This structural parameter is identified from actual data on workers mobility; thus the higher the entry cost, the less likely it is that workers would choose to enter into a given sector and employment status. That is, workers might not afford to move into a particular industry and status (the “romantic\" view), but after taking into account sector-specific utility shocks, forward looking workers are always better off in the chosen sector and status than in any other alternative state (the “rational view\"). The following section presents the structure of the model.  \n\n# 3 Model  \n\nThe model builds on the general equilibrium labor mobility framework introduced by Artuc, Chaudhuri and McLaren (2010). Consider an M-goods economy consisting of perfectly competitive $N$ sectors. The number of sectors, $N$ , is larger than the number of goods, $M$ ， because goods can be produced by informal and formal sectors. For example, manufacturing goods can be produced either in the formal manufacturing sector or in the informal manufacturing sector. Workers are distributed across these $N$ sectors: A type $s$ worker in sector $i$ receives wage $w_{t}^{i,s}$ at time $t$ .A worker's type, $s$ , can be her gender, education or other characteristics. We assume that workers within a type category $s$ are identical. In addition to the wage, workers receive a sector specific common utility $\\eta^{i,s}$ while working in sector $i$ . The fixed utility $\\eta^{i,s}$ accounts for compensating differentials, such as working conditions, hours, benefits, on-the-job hazards, etc. That is, the sector with the highest wage is not necessarily the most attractive one. For simplicity, we assume that both the wage $w_{t}^{i,s}$ and the fixed utility $\\eta^{i,s}$ are common for all type $s$ workers in sector $i$  \n\nIn every time period, workers have an option to change their industry of employment.  \n\nHowever, switching industries is costly. Workers pay a moving cost if they decide to move. The moving cost has two components: a fixed moving cost common to all type $s$ workers, and a random idiosyncratic component that is worker-specific in every time period. When a worker moves from sector $i$ to $j$ , she pays the fixed moving cost $C^{i j,s}$ and the random idiosyncratic cost $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{t}^{i}-\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{t}^{j}$ , where the random variable $\\epsilon_{t}^{i}$ follows an “extreme value\" distribution with scale parameter $\\nu$ , which is proportional to the standard error. Stayers do not pay the entry cost, i.e. $C^{i j,s}=0$ if $i=j$  \n\nWorkers choose the optimal sector dynamically considering wages, fixed utility, fixed moving costs, random moving costs and future values of all these variables. Workers are rational, risk neutral, live infinitely and discount the future with the parameter $\\beta$ . The optimal sector for a worker may not be the one with the highest wage and fixed utility because of the moving costs and workers′ expectations about the future. Under the rational expectations assumption, workers have an expectation about future wages but their expected wages do not necessarily equal the revealed wage in the data. That is, workers can make errors in their guesses about the future, but the errors cannot be systematic, i.e workers cannot persistently underestimate or overestimate the future wages. Our econometric strategy does not require parameterization of workers’ expectations, however.  \n\nWorkers? optimization problem can be characterized with the following Bellman equation:  \n\n$$\n^{i,s}=w_{t}^{i,s}+\\eta^{i,s}+\\beta E_{t}\\operatorname*{max}_{j}\\left\\{V_{t+1}^{j,s}-C^{i j,s}-\\epsilon_{t+1}^{j}\\right\\},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\textstyle V_{t}^{\\imath,s}$ is the present discounted value of the type $s$ workers in sector $i$ ,who are taking their wages, fixed utilities and future values into account. The choice-specific Bellman equation can be rearranged as  \n\n$$\nV_{t}^{i,s}=w_{t}^{i,s}+\\eta^{i,s}+\\beta E_{t}V_{t+1}^{i,s}+\\beta\\Omega_{t+1}^{i,s},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\Omega_{t+1}^{i,s}$ is the “option value of moving\", which is equal to the expected benefit of moving conditional on the net benefit of moving being positive. The “option value of moving” can be solved analytically when the random variable $\\epsilon_{t}^{i}$ is distributed iid“extreme value\" (see Artuc, Chaudhuri, and McLaren (2010) for further details). Following McFadden (1973), labor fows can be expressed as  \n\n$$\ny_{t}^{i j,s}=\\frac{\\exp\\left(\\left(E V_{t+1}^{j,s}-E V_{t+1}^{i,s}-C^{i j,s}\\right)\\frac{1}{\\nu}\\right)}{\\displaystyle\\sum_{k=1}^{N}\\exp\\left(\\left(E V_{t+1}^{k,s}-E V_{t+1}^{i,s}-C^{i k,s}\\right)\\frac{1}{\\nu}\\right)}L_{t}^{i,s},\n$$  \n\nwhere $y_{t}^{i j,s}$ is the number of type $s$ workers moving to sector $j$ from sector $i$ and $L_{t}^{i,s}$ is the total number of type $s$ workers in sector $i$  \n\n## 3.1 Production  \n\nFormal and informal sector products are assumed to be identical, but informal and formal workers are substitutes. However, consistent with existing literature, informal workers are less productive than formal workers. This assumption is also consistent with the lower informal wages observed in the data. The effective total human capital in an industry $i$ canbe expressed as  \n\n$$\nL_{t}^{i}=\\sum_{s}a^{j,s}L_{t}^{j,s}+\\sum_{s}a^{k,s}L_{t}^{k,s},\n$$  \n\nwhere $j$ and $k$ are the formal and informal sub-sectors of industry $i$ $a^{j,s}$ is the productivity parameter of type $s$ workers in the formal sector $j$ $a^{k,s}$ is the productivity of the same type of worker in the informal sector $k$ . Assuming Cobb-Douglas production, output $q_{t}^{\\i}$ in main  \n\nindustry $i$ at time $t$ is equal to  \n\n$$\nq_{t}^{i}=A^{i}(K^{i})^{1-\\gamma_{i}}(L_{t}^{i})^{\\gamma_{i}},\n$$  \n\nwhere the labor share is $\\gamma_{i}$ and the sectoral capital is $K^{i}$  \n\nFrom the production function (5), we can derive the real wage equations  \n\n$$\nw_{t}^{i,s}=\\frac{p_{t}^{i}}{P_{t}}a^{i,s}\\tilde{A}^{i}(L_{t}^{i})^{\\gamma_{i}-1},\n$$  \n\nwhere $P_{t}$ is the aggregate price index and $p_{t}^{i}$ is the unit price of sector $i$ output. The wage equation multiplier is defined as $\\tilde{A}^{i}=A^{i}(K^{i})^{1-\\gamma_{i}}$  \n\nWe close the model with the following consumer price index equation  \n\n$$\nP_{t}=\\prod_{i}(p_{t}^{i})^{\\theta_{i}}.\n$$  \n\nwith consumption shares $\\theta_{i}$  \n\n## 3.2 Estimation and Calibration  \n\nThe estimation strategy entails imputing expected values from the data. In their seminal paper, Hotz and Miller (1993) impute expected values from conditional choice probabilities. Their method relies on an inversion equation and estimation of conditional choice probabilities with a non-parametric method. In a departure from the literature, we use a Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood (PPML) regression to estimate expected values instead of the Hotz and  \n\nMiller (1993) inversion equation. PPML is used in the international trade literature to estimate the gravity model as in Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006) and Anderson (2011). The use of PPML is intuitive and simplifies the estimation procedure significantly. Most recently, Artuc and McLaren (2012) used a very similar strategy to estimate occupational mobility. See Artuc (2013) for the technical details of our estimation strategy.  \n\nWages, $w_{t}^{i,s}$ , the sectoral distribution of workers, $L_{t}^{i,s}$ , and labor fows, $y_{t}^{i j,s}$ , are directly taken from the data. The discount factor $\\beta$ is fixed to 0.95 and the variance parameter $\\nu$ is set at 1.0. The moving cost parameter, $C^{i j,s}$ , the values $E V_{t}^{i,s}$ and the option values $\\Omega_{t}^{i,s}$ are estimated. The remaining fixed utility parameters, $\\eta^{i,s}$ , and production function parameters are calibrated with the data.  \n\nStage 1: Estimating the Flow Equation  \n\nThe labor How equation (3) can be interpreted as a PPML regression similar to the gravity equation, where the entry costs create a resistance term similar to distance and the origindestination parameters are essentially the destination and origin fixed effects. The labor fow equation can be expressed as a PPML regression such that  \n\n$$\ny_{t}^{i j,s}=\\exp\\left(\\Gamma_{t}^{i,s}+\\Lambda_{t}^{j,s}+{\\bf1}_{i\\neq j}\\delta^{i j,s}\\right)+e_{t}^{i j,s}.\n$$  \n\n$\\Gamma_{t}^{i,s}$ is the coeffcient of the origin-industry fixed effect; $\\Lambda_{t}^{j,s}$ is the coefficient of destinationindustry fixed effect?; and $\\delta^{i j,s}$ is the normalized fixed entry cost to sector $j$ from sector $i$ ${\\mathbf{1}}_{i\\neq j}$ is an indicator function equal to one if $i$ is not equal to $j$ and zero otherwise (i.e. when $y_{t}^{i j,s}$ corresponds to movers rather than stayers). $e_{t}^{i j,s}$ is the regression residual.  \n\nThe structure of the moving cost matrix $\\delta^{i j,s}$ is flexible. Workers pay an entry cost that is a function of the destination sector and workers' original formality status. Thus, we assume the following moving cost structure:  \n\n$$\n\\delta^{i j,s}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{\\Delta_{1}^{j,s},\\mathrm{from~an~informal~sector~to~formal~}j\\mathrm{~without~changing~the~main~i~}}&\\ {\\Delta_{2}^{j,s},\\mathrm{from~a~formal~sector~to~informal~}j\\mathrm{~without~changing~the~main~i~}}&\\ {\\Delta_{3}^{j,s},\\mathrm{from~any~informal~sector~to~formal~}j\\mathrm{~while~changing~the~main~in}}&\\ {\\Delta_{4}^{j,s},\\mathrm{from~any~formal~sector~to~formal~}j\\mathrm{~while~changing~the~main~ind}}&\\ {\\Delta_{5}^{j,s},\\mathrm{to~informal~}j\\mathrm{~while~changing~the~main~industry~(from~any~sector~}}&\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nwhere $i$ is the origin sector and $j$ is a formal or informal destination sector, such as informal manufacturing or formal services. As mentioned, the main industries are: 1. Agriculture and Mining, 2. Manufacturing, 3. Transportation and Utilities, 4. Trade, 5. Service, and 6. Inactive. Each main industry (except “Inactive'\") consists of an informal sector and a formal sector3.  \n\nThen, the $j$ -specific term or the destination fixed effect, $\\Lambda_{t}^{j,s}$ , is equal to  \n\n$$\n\\Lambda_{t}^{j,s}=\\frac{\\beta}{\\nu}E_{t}V_{t+1}^{j,s}-\\frac{\\beta}{\\nu}E_{t}V_{t+1}^{1,s},\n$$  \n\nthe $i$ -specific term or the origin fixed effect, $\\Gamma_{t}^{i,s}$ , is equal to  \n\n$$\n\\Gamma_{t}^{i,s}=-\\frac{\\beta}{\\nu}E_{t}V_{t+1}^{i,s}-\\frac{1}{\\nu}\\Omega_{t}^{i,s}+\\log(L_{t}^{i,s})+\\frac{\\beta}{\\nu}E_{t}V_{t+1}^{1,s},\n$$  \n\nand the bilateral resistance term, $\\delta^{i j,s}$ , is equal to  \n\n(12) $\\delta^{i j,s}=-\\frac{1}{\\nu}C^{i j,s}.$  \n\nFinally, using destination and origin fixed effects, we construct the option value term, $\\Omega_{t}^{i,s}$ ,as  \n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\nu}\\Omega_{t}^{i,s}=-\\Lambda_{t}^{i,s}-\\Gamma_{t}^{i,s}+\\log(L_{t}^{i,s}).\n$$  \n\nThe remaining parameters $\\eta^{i,s}$ and $\\nu$ are calibrated in the second stage. After calibrating, $\\eta^{i,s}$ and the production functions, the model can be fully parameterized.  \n\n## Stage 2: Calibrating the Production Functions  \n\nAfter estimating the labor supply parameters in Stage 1, the production functions have to be parameterized to derive the labor demand (wage) equations. Without loss of generality, we normalize the productivity parameter to unity for formal workers, $a^{j,s}=1$ for formal sector $j$ .Also by asumption, the informal productive multipleris equal to $a^{k,s}=w_{t}^{k,s}/w_{t}^{j,s}$ which can be pinned down from observed average wages. The Cobb-Douglas labor share can be pinned down from the ratio of an industry's wage bill over the industry's value added (which come from national input-output tables). The wage equation multiplier $\\tilde{A}^{i}$ is calibrated such that the aggregate labor allocation refects the observed average wage in the data from each country. Finally, the fixed utility parameters $\\eta^{i}$ can be calibrated by matching the simulated labor allocations with the labor allocations observed in the data. The simulation methodology is similar to Artuc, Chaudhuri and McLaren (2010) and based on a shooting algorithm. In the simulations, we consider a counterfactual tariff reduction in the manufacturing sector that implies a 30% price reduction in manufactured goods prices.  \n\n# 4 Data  \n\nThe structural estimation outlined in the previous section is conducted with data from Labor Force Surveys (LFS) from Brazil, and Mexico. A common feature of these surveys is a rotative panel structure that permits the construction of employment transition matrices. For both countries, we restrict the sample to individuals between 15 and 65 years of age. Again, the industries are aggregated into five sectors: i) Agriculture, Mining, Construction and Utilities, i) Manufacturing, i) Commerce, iv) Hotels and Restaurants, and v) Other Services. Each sector is further divided into formal and informal. A worker is considered formal if she/he is registered in the social security system. Additionally, there is a residual sector that captures individuals who are either unemployed or out of the labor force, the aforementioned “inactive\" sector.  \n\nThe “Encuesta Nacional de Ocupacion y Empleo\" (ENOE) is used to compute the transition matrices for Mexico. The ENOE is a household survey that collects detailed information on labor force status, wages, occupational and demographic characteristics. It is collected quarterly since 2005, and it is representative at both the national and state levels. The sample size is around 120,260 households in each quarter. Each household is interviewed in five consecutive quarters. In each quarter, one fifth of the sample (e.g., households in their fifth interview) is replaced. We construct the transition matrix by looking at the first and fifth interview. We derive six year-on-year transition matrices, the first matrix refecting transitions between 2005 and 2006 and the most recent between 2010 and 2011.  \n\nThe “Pesquisa Mensal de Emprego\"” is the Brazilian LFS. The survey collects detailed information of Brazil's labor market and is representative of only six metropolitan (urban) regions. Each wave of the survey has approximately 120,000 individuals. The panel structure consist on each household being interviewed 12 times over an 18 months period. In each wave of the survey, we identify individuals in their first interview and we follow them a year later at the time of their fifth interview. Similar to the other two countries, we derive four year-on-year transitions matrices that cover the period between 2007 and 2011.  \n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the two countries analyzed herein cover a large range of informality rates observed in Latin America. Existing estimates suggest that the informal sectors in Mexico are large relative to other countries in the region, whereas Brazil tends to have lower informality rates than other Latin American economies. According to existing calculations for the case of Mexico, the size of the informal sector represents about 60% of employed salaried male workers and $55\\%$ of females. Brazil's informality appears to be below the average of Latin America, with a rate of informality of about 32% of employed males and 33% for females 4.  \n\nTable 1 presents summary statistics of the data used for the estimation outlined in the previous section. In Mexico, the size of the informal sector (59.9% of the employed workers) and the employment shares (60.45%, which corresponds to a residual sector of 39.55%) are also consistent with estimates found in the literature. For example, Bosch and Maloney (2010) report an informal sector of 38% and a residual sector of 20%. However, their sample includes only men in urban areas (using the “Encuesta Nacional de Empleo Urbano,” ENEU, from 1984-2004). Although we use the ENOE, which is representative of both urban and rural areas, with our sample of men in urban areas we obtain similar rates as Bosch and Maloney (2010). Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that the residual sector for both urban and rural male workers in our data is almost exactly 20%, whereas the informality rate of $49.0\\%$ is unsurprisingly much higher than the 38% for urban males, because self-employment (without social security coverage) is more common in rural areas. Table 1 also shows the employment shares across industries and formality status. The industry with the largest proportion of informal workers is agriculture, mining, construction and utilities. In Brazil, the sector has about 1.2 informal  \n\nworkers per formal worker 5.  \n\nThe size and composition of the residual sector is important because it is associated with the highest transition counts. Table 2 shows transitions between industries, and Table 3 shows transitions between the formal and informal sectors. Table 2 confirms that workers move more often in and out from the residual sector than across sectors in both countries. However, the sectors to which workers move in from the residual sector differ across countries. Workers in the residual sector are more likely to move into services than to other sectors.  \n\nThe transition patterns in and out of informality in Mexico are notably different from the patterns observed in the Brazilian data. Table 3 suggests that the entry point to employment in Mexico is through the informal sector, as the probability of moving from the residual sector to the informal sector (17.95% and $12.03\\%$ , respectively) is greater than the probability of moving from the residual sector to the formal sector (5.04% and 0.92%, respectively). In contrast, Brazilian workers in the residual sector tend to move with relatively similar probabilities into the informal (7.15 $\\%$ ) and formal (8.63%) sectors. Furthermore, Brazilian formal workers tend to have a higher probability of moving to the residual sector (8.61% $\\mathrm{\\mathit{\\Sigma}_{0}^{\\prime}}$ ) than to the informal sector (4.86%), whereas in the other two countries the transition probabilities from formal employment to informality are close to 14%. Finally, informal-sector workers from Mexico move with a higher probability to the residual sector (18.54% and $13.73\\%$ , respectively) than to the formal sector (10.46% and 3.42%, respectively), which is not the case in Brazil (where the probability of moving into the residual sector from informality is 18.20% compared to 24.63% for entering the formal sector).  \n\nAs described in sub-section 3.1, the simulation exercises (presented in the following section) require information on key parameters, including labor shares and consumption shares by sector for each country. Complementary data sources were required to compute these parameters. The labor shares were defined as the ratio of the wage bill over total value added for each sector, and the consumption shares as the share of each sector in total consumption. These parameters were calculated from input-output (IO) tables from Mexico and Brazil. We used the IO table of 2003 for Mexico, and 2005 for Brazil. Average formal and informal wages in Mexico and Brazil were calculated with data from the Labor Force Surveys (LFS). The parameters for the simulations are shown in Table 4. The wages in each country-sector are expressed as a ratio of each country's average wage.  \n\n# 5 Results  \n\nThe proposed estimations and simulations provide two sets of results. The first concerns the estimates of labor mobility costs. To be more precise, the PPML estimations provide estimates of workers? perceived entry costs associated with movements across industries of employment as well as with movements in and out of informality. In turn, the simulations utilized the estimated entry costs to analyze the effect of a price reduction affecting the manufacturing industry. As will become apparent, this industry might play a key role in the formalization of labor markets in developing countries.  \n\n## 5.1 Estimates of Labor Mobility Costs: Entry Costs and Formalization  \n\nTable 5 shows the estimates of labor mobility costs. To be more precise, it reports normalized entry costs 6. As explained above in Section 3, Table 5 presents estimates of $C/\\nu$ Assuming that $\\nu{=}1$ , and given that the literature normalizes wages by the average real wage, 6The $\\mathrm{_{Z}}$ statistics arereported inside parentheses. Al coefcients  Table  are statistically sigifcant.Fr the simulations we assume that this moving cost is zero  \n\nthe estimates should be interpreted as mobility (entry) costs in terms multiples of the average real wage in each country. Moreover, without loss of generality, the normalized labor mobility costs, $C/\\nu$ , allows identification of the relative cost of switching from informal to formal status across industries 7.  \n\nThere are three results in common for both countries. First, for an average informal worker it is less costly to become formal while staying in the same industry. Industry-specific skills might explain this finding. Second, the highest moving entry costs are related to two sources of mobility frictions, namely moving from informal to formal and across industries. That is, acquiring new industry-specific skills adds to the cost of becoming formal. In both countries, becoming formal by moving from any sector into restaurants and hotels represents the highest cost among all possible mobility choices covered by the model. This does not necessarily imply that the skills demanded in the hospitality industries are more sophisticated than those in other industries. Rather, the results theoretically reflect the workers? expected costs of entering those industries, which might be due to the loss of expected wages due to less sophisticated skills than those demanded in other industries. Third, the lowest entry costs are associated to switching from formal to informal status within the same sector. Restaurants & hotels and \"other services\" have the lowest cost of switching from formal to informal.  \n\nIn Mexico manufacturing is an stepping-stone for moving into formal jobs. This result suggests that manufacturing might be a key for the formalization of developing-country labor markets. The estimated entry costs into formal manufacturing from informal employment in Mexico is 4.90 times the average wage. In Mexico, an average informal worker would also perceive that “other services\"” is a stepping-stone sector, which is refected in the low estimated entry cost into formal employment of 4.89 times the average wage. In urban Brazil, however, \"commerce” is the stepping-stone sector for moving into formal employment, with an estimated entry cost of about 4.64 times the country's average wage, but manufacturing is not far behind with an estimate of 4.94 that is quite close to the estimate for Mexico. The latter estimate is quite close to the estimates for manufacturing entry costs in Mexico. Having established the similarities and contrasts between Brazil and Mexico in terms of their labor mobility entry costs, the following section puts these estimates to work for the simulations of the effects of a shock that would permanently reduce the price of the final goods of the key industry, the manufacturing sector, by $30\\%$  \n\n## 5.2  Simulations: The Effects of Trade Liberalization  \n\nTo simulate the effects of a trade shock, the analysis assumes the following: 1) Units are chosen so that the domestic price of each good at date $t=-1$ is unity. Given the available free parameters and without loss of generality, 2) there are no tariffs on any sector besides the manufacturing sector at any date. 3) The world price of manufacturing output is 0.7 at each date, and the world price of all other tradable goods is equal to unity in each date. 4) There is initially a specific tariff in manufacturing at the level of 0.3 per unit, so the domestic price of manufactures is equal to unity. 5) The initial tariff is expected to be permanent and the economy is initially at the corresponding steady state consistent with that expectation. 6) At date $t=-1$ , however, after that period's moving decisions have been made, the government announces that the tariff will be removed beginning on period $t=0$ (so the domestic price of manufactures fall from unity to 0.7 on that date), and this liberalization is expected to be permanent.  \n\nWe computed the perfect-foresight path of the adjustment following the liberalization announcement. The simulated adjustment process continues until the economy effectively reaches the new steady state. This requires that each worker -taking the time path of wages in all sectors as given- optimally decides at each date whether or not to switch sectors, while taking into account workers’ own idiosyncratic or personal shocks. This computation yields a time path for the allocation of workers, and is, therefore, the time path of the wage, since the wage in each sector at each date is determined by market clearing conditions from equation (6), given the number of workers initially employed in each sector. Of course, the time path of wages so generated must be the same as the time path that each worker expects. Cameron et al. (2007) shows that this equilibrium exists and is unique.  \n\nFigure 1 shows the evolution of labor shares across the five economic sectors in Mexico.8 Labor reallocation across economic sectors in Mexico is marked by a steady reduction of employment in manufacturing that begins right after the tariff reform, while the labor shares of the other sectors rise. The employment share of manufacturing slowly approaches a new steady state that is lower than the initial one. The rest of Figure 1 shows that all sectors experience increases in labor shares, but services and agriculture experience the largest gains. Interestingly, the restaurants & hotels sector seems to be unaffected by the trade reform, while commerce only experiences a marginal increase in its labor share.  \n\nFigure 2 shows that after the trade reform, workers in the residual sector gradually enter the informal sector. Informal employment as a share of the working age population increases after the reduction of the import tariff on manufactured goods. The new equilibrium is two percentage points higher than the initial one. The initial steady state of informal employment (as a share of the working age population) is around $36\\%$ , and after the trade reform, informal employment grows gradually to the new steady state of 38%. The share of formal employment stays fairly constant after the trade reform; the difference is approximately 0.0022 percentage points.  \n\nFigure 3 shows the adjustment path of real wages in Mexico. By construction, the formalinformal wage gap within each sector remains constant through the entire path to the new steady state. Real wages increased in all sectors, except manufacturing, precisely because the reduction of the price of manufactures reduced the aggregate price level. Consequently real wages in the non-manufacturing sectors increase suddenly, reaching a peak in the year immediately after the trade reform. Thereafter real wages outside of manufacturing begin a slow decline as workers move across sectors in search of higher real wages (thus raising the supply of workers in the receiving industries) prior to reaching the new steady state at a higher level than in the initial state. In manufacturing, initially real wages drop substantially right after the reform as labor demand in that industry falls with its price, but then they recover gradually as some workers who were previously employed in manufacturing exit the sector. The manufacturing real wage eventually reaches a new steady state that is below the initial level of the industry's real wage.  \n\nFigures 4 to 6 show similar results for Brazil. Informal employment increases slightly after the initial tariff reduction. The new equilibrium is one percentage point higher than the initial steady state. Most of the new entrants to the informal sector come from the residual sector. Similar to Mexico, after the tariff reduction, real wages decline to a new steady state, while real wages increase in all other sectors. Agriculture and “other services” are the sectors that absorbed most of the workers entering from the residual sector and those that are displaced from manufacturing.  \n\nIn sum, the simulations show that total employment increases, which is evidenced by declines in the share of the residual sectors. Mexico and Brazil experience an increase in the share of total employment of 2.53 and 1.00 percentage points respectively. These dynamics are explained by the initial abrupt decline in the price of manufactured goods. The drastic drop in the price of manufactures explains the initial jump in real wages in other industries. However, once workers start moving into these sectors (from manufacturing and inactive status) real wages gradually converge downwards to the new steady state, which is still higher than the initial state. Similarly, the initial drop in the real wages in manufacturing is explained mainly by the abrupt reduction of 30 percent in the prices of the manufacturing sector in the reform year, and the gradual recovery in real wages is triggered by the exit of workers toward other sectors. In other words, the immediate impact of trade liberalization is thus a reduction in the relative price of manufacturing goods, which increases the opportunity cost of inactive individuals. Given the cost structure of the economy and the rational forward-looking behavior of workers, inactive individuals choose to enter the labor force, but mainly through the informal sector due to its lower entry costs than those associated with formal employment. These results suggest that the informal sector is the stepping stone for entrants into the labor market.  \n\n# 6 Conclusions  \n\nThis paper studied the labor-market implications of changes in relative prices that could be brought about by trade reforms or any other shock with permanent relative-price effects. From the point of view of developing countries, the enormous literature on informal employment has grown precisely because of the relatively large share of informal employment in developing countries. The main contribution of the analyses presented above was to estimate labor mobility costs faced by workers, which were then used to simulate the dynamic adjustment path of the labor markets in two developing countries that appear to represent the range of informality rates observed in Latin America. The estimation of the labor mobility costs relied on a structuralempirical model that built upon the existing literature on discrete choice models, including Hotz and Miller (1993) and Artuc, Chaudhuri and McLaren (2010). In addition, following McFadden (1973), the model was estimated with a PPML estimator, which simplified the empirics relative to what is proposed in the existing literature.  \n\nRegarding the empirical results on labor mobility costs, the evidence suggests that the highest mobility costs are associated with formalization and changes in the industry of employment. It appears that formalization is less costly when workers enter formality within the same industry. These results are consistent with labor mobility costs being associated with industryspecific skills, otherwise entry costs into formal employment would not vary across industries. Likewise, switching industries or employment status appears to be less costly when entering informal employment. This result played an important role in the empirical simulations of the effect of a 30% decline in the price of manufactured goods.  \n\nTotal employment increases after the tariff reduction in the simulations. Yet informal employment increases more than formal employment, as the share of the inactive working-age population falls. That is, the reduction in the tariff raises the expected real wage in nonmanufacturing wages, thus raising the opportunity cost of remaining out of the labor market. At the time of writing, we are not aware of any other study that has highlighted this mechanism as an important element for understanding why the size of the informal sector can rise after trade liberalization.  \n\n# References  \n\n[1]  Anderson, James. 2011. “\"The Gravity Model\".

    "reference_markdown": "# Wiring the Labor Market  \n\nDavid H. Autor  \n\nT he labor market is replete with imperfect and asymmetric information. Workers and jobs are naturally heterogeneous, and the quality of their interaction when paired is notoriously difficult to forecast. Workers   \nsearching for a job are unlikely to be fully informed about job characteristics, and   \nfirms cannot exhaustively screen and negotiate with all applicants. Electronic   \ncommerce specifically, and the Internet more generally, promise to open new   \nchannels for improved worker-firm communications. What are the consequences of   \nthis opening?  \n\nIn this essay, I discuss three labor market features that are likely to be affected. First, the Internet will change the way that employer-employee matches are made. Second, labor services—the actual work done by employees—may be increasingly delivered over the Internet rather than on-site. Third, the demand for labor may become less dependent on local market conditions. Economic theory offers several insights into why these developments will produce social benefits. But these gains are unlikely to be uniformly enjoyed, and the process of realizing them will generate novel problems. One of the most significant impacts of the Internet on labor markets may be the creation of new institutions to address issues accompanying these opportunities.  \n\n## Three Consequences of the Internet for Labor Markets  \n\n### How Workers and Firms Search for One Another  \n\nWorkers use numerous avenues to locate jobs, including personal referrals, direct employer contacts, union and professional registers, private employment agencies, and newspaper advertisements. Added to this list recently are: Internet job boards, which are websites offering searchable databases of job listings and resumes; corporate websites permitting on-line job applications; and employerinitiated employee searches that target promising (\"passive\") candidates via their on-line credentials.  \n\nLittle is known about the importance of on-line job applications or direct employer-initiated contacts with potential candidates. However, on-line job posting has grown spectacularly. Estimates place the number of on-line job boards at over 3000, the number of (unique) active resumes on-line at over 7 million, and the number of job postings (not necessarily unique) at 29 million (Boyle et al., 1999; Computer Economics, 20o0). The leading job board, Monster.Com, offered 3.9 million resumes and 430,000 jobs in August 2000. Several prominent job boards are provided on a nonprofit basis. For example, the U.s. Department of Labor runs America's Job Bank, to be found at <http:/ /www.ajb.org), which makes the job listing and search services of the U.s. Public Employment Service broadly accessible, and Canada's CareerOwl job search facility, developed by university faculty volunteers and found at (http:/ /www.careerowl.ca), provides job search assistance for Canadian students (Nakamura and Pugh, 2000).  \n\nJob boards hold several advantages over their textual counterpart, newspaper help-wanted ads. They offer more information about more jobs in more locations than is conceivable for paper equivalents. They are easier to search. They are potentially more up-to-date, because ads are posted immediately and can be edited frequently. They allow individuals to advertise their skills to employers as well as the reverse. Employers can also use job boards for candidate screening by specifying that their job listings and on-line applications are only made available to candidates possessing specific credentials such as education or experience.  \n\nJob boards can also take an active role in matching: rather than waiting on workers or firms to find one another, software can parse posted job listings and resumes to identify plausible matches and notify both parties. Some matching algorithms also learn from workers' behavior, noting the jobs for which a particular worker applies and adapting their recommendations accordingly. In addition, whether over a job board or another on-line connection, employers can use the Internet to administer skills or personality tests at the point of application.  \n\nJob boards reach more attentive eyes at a lower cost than newspaper advertisements. A job advertisement in the Sunday New York Times, circulation $1.7\\mathrm{mil}.$ lion, costs $\\$4500$ (Audit Bureau of Circulations). By contrast, Monster.com, which had 3.8 million unique visitors in May 2000 (MediaMetrix), charges $\\$137$ for a30 day advertisement—less than 5 percent of the Times.  \n\nInternet job search is already commonplace. About 15 percent of unemployed job seekers regularly used the Internet as a means of job search in 1998, quite comparable to the fraction that placed or answered traditional help-wanted ads, according to data from the Current Population Survey (Kuhn and Skuterud, 2000). In the medium term, job boards are likely to displace newspaper advertisements as the leading conduit for job listings. For example, companies surveyed by Li et al. (2000) project a 31 percent decline in print recruitment advertising by 2004 as compared to a 52 percent increase in on-line advertising.  \n\nJob boards and other Internet labor market connections should increase the efficiency with which workers are matched to jobs. In part, greater efficiency arises simply because more initial meetings between potential employees and workers are possible. Greater effciency might also arise from on-line candidate screening. For example, 7-Eleven convenience stores offer job applicants an electronic interview questionnaire that they complete over the telephone. By fine-tuning its interview questions, 7-Eleven improved its screening process and its retention rates rose (\"Labours Lost,” 2000b).  \n\nThe improvement in matching efficiency may already be evident. Despite the fact that newspaper help-wanted ads usually increase when the unemployment rate falls, the Conference Board's help-wanted advertising index has been flat throughout the 1990s economic boom (Krueger, 2000). One reading of these facts is that the Beveridge curve—-the negatively sloped relationship between job vacancies and unemployment—has shifted towards the origin, which is consistent with an improvement in the aggregate job matching efficiency of the U.s. labor market (Bleakley and Fuhrer, 1997). Since vacancies are normally measured by the Conference Board's index of newspaper help-wanted listings, a plausible alternative explanation noted by Katz and Krueger (1999) is that vacancy listings have merely migrated from newspapers to the Internet. However, the improvement in labor market matching efficiency is unlikely to be entirely illusory; recent estimates find that the unemployment rate consistent with non-accelerating wage inflation also fell during the 1990s (Gordon, 1998; Katz and Krueger, 1999).1  \n\nLabor market search theory predicts that lowering the cost of job search will raise productivity (Mortensen, 2000; Pissarides, 1990). Because workers and firms can consider more potential matches more rapidly, their reservation match quality—the minimum productivity an employer will tolerate, or equivalently, the minimum wage a worker will accept—-both rise. Higher match quality raises output, and worker earnings and firm profits rise accordingly. In general, lower search costs will also reduce unemployment.? In addition, better job matches should reduce workers’ incentive to separate from their employers. Conversely, since the Internet may make it substantially easier for workers to seek better job offers while employedand for employers to seek their replacements when they depart—-this may induce more job separations.  \n\nKuhn and Skuterud (20o0) report that 7 percent of employed workers regularly used the web to search for a new job in 1998, a volume of on-the-job search that is an order of magnitude larger than the amount that was thought to take place with conventional methods. This suggests that the Internet may have a sizable impact on job searches for incumbent workers. In fact, median tenure of employed workers has fallen notably for both genders and all age groups since 1991 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 20oob), a trend consistent with higher turnover.  \n\nWhile it is difficult in the present economy to disentangle the impact of decreased search costs from the temptations of bountiful job opportunities and a business culture that has become more willing to carry out layoffs, the subject deserves careful study. Although issues of self-selection will complicate inquiry, it will be important to explore whether employers who search for workers on job boards versus help-wanted ads find workers faster, and find better workers—and similarly for workers who job search on-line. The Internet also provides an opportunity to collect more and possibly better labor market data. In contrast to conventional research data sources that provide a point-in-time snapshot of the labor market, the “transaction history” generated by web-based job boards, job applications, and other on-line artifacts may provide a new tool for studying labor market dynamics.  \n\n## How Labor Services are Delivered  \n\nThe Internet is likely to change how some workers deliver labor services. For example, falling telecommunications costs mean that call center employees can handle telecommunications traffic regardless of where it originates (\"Call Centres,\" 1997; Uchitelle, 2000). Improvements in communications and control technology likely mean that people who monitor equipment or other workers can perform their tasks at greater physical remove. Remote access to e-mail and company documents will enable many workers to perform some or all of their work from home or elsewhere. Close to 10 percent of the labor force was engaged in some form of telecommuting as of 1997, and that penetration was growing at 15 percent annually (National Science Foundation, 1998, Ch. 8).3  \n\nOne potential source of efficiency gains from delivering services remotely is that hours spent in unproductive commuting may be replaced by rapid on-line delivery. However, evidence suggests that telecommunications and face-to-face interactions are complements rather than substitutes (Gaspar and Glaeser, 1998), in which case telecommuting and physical commuting may rise in tandem. Survey data find that workers who use the Internet extensively at home have increased working hours at home without decreasing their time in the office (Nie and Erbring, 2000). One reason may be that by increasing the productivity of working at home, telecommuting may induce substitution from leisure to production.  \n\nA related observation is that along with changing how workers supply skills, the Internet may change how they acquire them. A vast economic literature beginning with Becker (1964) emphasizes the importance of skills training to worker earnings and mobility, and recent evidence confirms that the majority of employers spend substantially on both informal and formal workplace skills training (Frazis et al., 1998). Skills training delivered over the Internet has the potential to reduce substantially the cost and increase the convenience of ongoing skills development. However, at this point the efficacy of on-line training is unproven.  \n\n### How Local Markets Shape Labor Demand  \n\nWhen the work product is primarily information, improvements in information and communications technology enable firms to transmit the work to the workers. For example, check-processing at U.s. bank branches—a low-skilled, labor-intensive task—- had historically been carried out in near physical proximity to bank branches due to federal regulations requiring rapid turnaround of physical paper checks (within 48 hours for in-state checks). With the advent of digital imaging, banks discovered that they could ship images of paper checks electronically to out-ofstate facilities, thus disaggregating the information and paper processing tasks into separate jobs performed in different locations and coordinated by networked computers (Autor, Levy and Murnane, 2ooob).  \n\nAs this example suggests, businesses are likely to leverage the Internet to subdivide work into component parts, ship subtasks electronically to sources of labor supply, and use information technology to coordinate the geographically dispersed production process (Brynjolfsson and Hitt, forthcoming). These forces will augment the trend towards greater outsourcing of business services (Abraham and Taylor, 1996). Firms may find it less necessary to hire workers whom they only use infrequently, reducing transaction costs. This will in turn increase the extent of the market for specialized skills, yielding accompanying gains from specialization of labor.  \n\nWhich tasks and associated jobs are likely to be outsourced in response to these technological opportunities is a worthwhile question for research. On the one hand, the work products of professional and technical workers most lend themselves to electronic delivery. On the other hand, the routine information processing tasks performed by many clerical and service workers, such as the banking employees discussed above, may require limited in-person contact and hence can be easily coordinated and monitored over electronic networks (Autor, Levy and Murnane, 2000a).  \n\nThe impacts of e-commerce on labor outsourcing and specialization have counterparts in the product market. By allowing consumers to shop for products and services from distant suppliers, e-commerce effectively separates the storefront from its physical operations. Consequently, suppliers of goods have less incentive to locate near demanders of goods (Kolko, 1999). Freed from some of the constraints of proximity, labor (and product) demand and supply implicitly operate in larger markets.  \n\nTrade theory suggests that integrating labor markets that were geographically (semi-)independent has substantial benefits. By redistributing work to places where labor is comparatively cheap, firms reduce costs and regions exercise comparative advantage. Producers realize scale economies that were infeasible in small markets, thereby raising productivity and wages, and consumers gain specialized services that were previously only available in large markets.  \n\nThe combination of increasingly mobile labor demand and increasingly flexible labor supply means that the labor supply and demand facing any given geographic region become effectively more elastic. Because firms can more readily arbitrage regional wage and price differentials (both intra- and internationally), workers with similar skills in different locations should receive (more） similar wages. While this is bad news for those who have been hiring labor in slack labor markets, it can also mitigate regional pockets of unemployment and even reduce aggregate inflationary pressure. The impacts may be particularly significant for lesseducated workers, who are substantially less likely to relocate in response to regional booms and busts than are their college-educated counterparts (Bound and Holzer, 2ooo). At present, much anecdotal evidence suggests that firms are leveraging the decline in communications costs offered by the Internet to arbitrage regional labor market differentials (Uchitelle, 2000; Verhovek, 2000). It clearly will be worthwhile to study representative evidence on this point.  \n\n## Some Mitigating Concerns  \n\nE-commerce and the Internet are likely to offer net social gains by improving labor market efficiency. But these gains will not be uniformly enjoyed and the process of realizing them may generate novel problems. Here I provide a few examples that I see as particularly relevant.  \n\n### Adverse Selection of Job Applicants  \n\nInformation about workers’ attributes can be usefully grouped into low and high “bandwidth\" varieties. Low bandwidth data are objectively verifiable information such as education, credentials, experience, and salaries. High bandwidth data are attributes such as quality, motivation, and “fit\" that are typically hard to verify except through direct interactions such as interviews and repeated contact. The Internet makes low bandwidth data cheap, dramatically reducing the cost of learning about and applying for jobs. For example, browsing job boards is almost always free and the opportunity to transmit job applications to multiple employers iscommonplace.  \n\nA natural consequence of lowering the cost of application is that many workers will apply for many more jobs. In fact, excess application appears to be the norm for on-line job postings, with employers reporting that they frequently receive unmanageable numbers of resumes from both under- and overqualified candidates, often repeatedly, and frequently from remote parts of the world (Li et al., 2ooo; Moe and Blodgett, 2000).  \n\nAs discussed by Lang (20oo), this situation is problematic. Consider a case where potential employees can judge whether they are a good fit for a job (that is, they know their personal high-bandwidth data) but employers would have to go through a process of interviewing and screening to collect this information. In a world where applying for jobs is costly, individuals who know that they are poor candidates for a position will not bother to apply. Lowering application costs to near zero does not reduce the problem of gathering high bandwidth information. Rather, it shifts the cost either on to the employer or on to workers who must implicitly pay more to establish their qualifications. When direct application costs fall, firms may introduce additional hurdles to reduce adverse selection and improve the overall quality of their application pool.4  \n\nDo we see any evidence of this? Partly in response to the problem of excess and inappropriate applications, many job boards offer prefiltering to prevent unqualified applicants from submitting resumes. Web-based services like Pre-employ.com, Avert.com, and PreScreenAmerica.com offer on-line background checks and prescreening services. The advertisement for one on-line screening service asks: “Did he really go to Harvard? Is she really Microsoft-certified? We'll help you be sure.\" The widely advertised Futurestep.com website (the web entry of a leading executive recruiting firm) warns applicants of a 30-60 minute on-line application process that is required to become eligible for career services. Presumably, this time commitment wards off some nonserious applicants.  \n\nA large fraction of all jobs are found through personal referrals rather than formal contacts, and adverse selection of job applicants may be an important reason why (Greenwald, 1986; Montgomery, 1991). For example, Li et al. (2000) report that of approximately 3000 Internet users surveyed in 1999, 4 percent had found their most recent job over the Internet, compared with 6 percent via temporary help agencies, 23 percent via the newspaper and 40 percent via referral. If on-line job application exacerbates adverse selection, one perverse consequence may be that personal referrals become more important in a wired labor market.  \n\nIn fact, many employers appear to believe that resumes posted to job boards represent an adversely selected pool (Li, 2000; iLogos, 1999). A 1998 survey of job seekers found that 71 percent of posted resumes belonged to unemployed workers (Source InterBiznet.com, as reported by Boyle et al., 1999). One recruiting executive is quoted in Boyle et al. (p. 45) as saying that job boards are populated with resumes from four adversely selected pools: “The unhappy (and thus probably not a desirable employee); the curious (and therefore likely to be a ’job-hopper'); the unpromotable (probably for a reason); and the unemployed (probably for a worse reason).\"  \n\nPerhaps due to this perception, employers increasingly use the Internet to bypass the pool of selfidentified job seekers and target “\"passive candidates,\" currently employed individuals who might be enticed by a better opportunity. The term of art for this practice is “talent mining.\" It involves trolling company websites, chat rooms, and other on-line media to identify and solicit applications from desirable candidates. While recruiting agencies that specialize in hiring the alreadyemployed have existed for some time, they have primarily served executive labor markets. The price reductions in identifying and targeting passive candidates offered by the Internet may make this form of employer pursuit more commonplace in less rarified labor markets, with potentially adverse consequences for active jobseekers.  \n\nThe “market\" for undergraduate college admissions, which is several years ahead of the labor market in adopting on-line applications, provides an instructive example. Electronic applications are credited in part with an estimated 30 percent rise in the number of college applications between 1998 and 2000, five times the growth rate of the college applicant pool (\"College Applications Up Sharply,\" 1999; Myers, 2000). Because on-line applications are easy to file in bulk, their signaling content is accordingly devalued, creating substantial uncertainty for colleges about which students are genuinely motivated to attend (Roane, 2000). One possible consequence is that the fraction of admissions made on an “early decision\" basis— where an application signifies a binding unilateral commitment to attend—-has doubled in the past five years to 25 to 40 percent (Brophy, 2000). While binding precommitment may solve the signaling problem, the new equilibrium is unlikely to be welfare-improving. College applicants increasingly face the dilemma of restricting their choice set to a single school or facing lower acceptance odds in the residual non-early applicant pool.5  \n\nNo data are yet available on how the Internet is shifting the pool of workers from which employers hire. However, these observations suggest that the impacts need not be neutral across skill and employment groups. Understanding who is affected and how are worthwhile topics for exploration.  \n\n### Who is Matched to Whom  \n\nReductions in search costs for employees and employers should yield aggregate gains in productivity and wages as the quality of job matches improves. However, aggregate gains do not imply Pareto improvements: productivity gains for some workers may be partially offset by losses for other workers.  \n\nAn example illustrates the pitfalls. Consider a world where firms can choose between three production technologies: a general-use technology that requires both high- and low-skill workers and two skill-specific technologies, one requiring exclusively high- and the other requiring exclusively low-skill workers. Each technology has the same cost, but the high-skill technology is extremely productive when paired with high-ability workers and is unproductive with low-ability workers.  \n\nAssume that firms must make their capital investments before hiring (say, when building plants) and hence they choose the production technology that suits the expected characteristics of their recruits. In the pre-Internet world, there are few applicants per job and hence firms hire the first worker who applies. In the post-Internet world, each job receives numerous applications. Consequently, the Internet permits firms to choose workers that suit their production technology, moving the labor market from a pooling equilibrium, in which high- and low-skill workers work together, to a separating equilibrium in which they do not. How does the improvement in job matching impact worker well-being?  \n\nThe answer will depend on whether the skillspecific production technologies are characterized by what I'll call “weak\" or “strong\" skill match. Strong skill match is a case where each worker type is absolutely more productive with the skillspecific technology than with the general-use technology (for example, because the skill-specific technologies require either brains or brawn whereas the general-use technology requires some of both). Weak skill match is a case where one skill group-high skill, in this example—is more productive with the skill-specific technology while the other group is more productive with the general-use technology (for example, because high-skill capital substitutes for brawn but low-skill capital cannot substitute for brains). In this case, improvements in job matching benefit high-skill workers and harm low-skill workers who previously gained from being pooled with high-skill workers.6  \n\nFigure l provides a numerical example. Panel A depicts strong skill match. High-skill workers produce 5 with the general use technology and low-skill workers produce 4. Total output is 9. The invention of the Internet yields a Pareto improvement. Since firms can now freely select for worker ability, they invest in skill-specific technologies. As each worker is paired with the appropriate technology, output rises to 14 overall, increasing to 8 for high-skill workers and 6 for low-skill workers.  \n\nContrast this to the weak skill match case depicted in Panel B where high-skill workers are more productive with the high-skill technology but low-skill workers are less productive with the low-skill technology. Here, the Internet is less benign. Workers  \n\nWorker productivity with strong technology-skill match  \n\nFigure 1 Worker-Firm Matching and Workplace Segregation by Skil   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"3\">WorkerType</td></tr><tr><td>Technology Type</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Generaluse</td><td>5</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>High-skill specific Low-skill specific</td><td>0</td><td>6</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nWorker productivity with weak technology-skill match again separate by ability as firms invest in skill-specific technologies. Total output increases, in this case to 11, and wages for high-ability workers rise to 8. But as low-ability workers are separated from high-ability workers, their wages fall from 4 to 3.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"3\">WorkerType</td></tr><tr><td>Technology Type</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>Generaluse</td><td>5</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>High-skill specific</td><td>8</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Low-skill specific</td><td>0</td><td>CG</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nWhile this example is quite stylized, it captures the flavor of more sophisticated models in which improvements in worker-firm matching generate increased workplace segregation by skill, yielding absolute declines in the well being of less-skilled workers (Acemoglu, 1999; Kremer and Maskin, 1996).  \n\n## Geography and Inequality  \n\nIf electronic delivery of labor services effectively integrates economically distinct markets, geographic variation in skill prices should converge. But factor price equalization is highly redistributive, placing downward pressure on the wages of workers whose skills become relatively more abundant when markets integrate. For example, given that the United States has relatively high skill levels by world standards, further integration of the U.s. economy with world labor markets almost certainly increases the relative abundance of less-skilled labor, placing downward pressure on the wages of less-skilled U.S. workers.  \n\nFurther, economic integration may also exacerbate wage inequality within skill groups (Acemoglu, Angrist and Autor, 20oo). Consider a case of two cities of identical size, originally operating as separate markets. The workers in City 2 have more talent than the workers in City 1; however, the local demand for talent in City 1 is higher than in City 2, and so workers in City 1 initially earn approximately the same as those in  \n\nCity 2 despite their lesser talent. Integration of these markets creates a single market price for talent, but in this case earnings diverge. When markets were isolated, heterogeneity in demand masked heterogeneity in underlying talent endowments. When a single price for talent prevails, electronic markets more accurately target riches to those with the most generous endowment. Thus, whether integration of markets is a force for equality or inequality depends in part on the dispersion of the underlying talent distribution relative to the levels of local demand.7  \n\nThe Internet could also heighten inequality by concentrating the distribution of market rewards among fewer participants. As Sherwin Rosen's prescient 1981 paper, “The Economics of Superstars,” observed, advances in communications technology—of which the Internet is an important example—-can create winnertake-all markets. The primary insight is that by allowing individuals with extraordinary talent to serve substantial markets almost single-handedly, communications technologies may displace lesser talents, redistributing a larger share of the rewards to a smaller number of superstars. More recently, Rosen (20o0) makes a similar observation specifically about the Internet: \"When and if teachers use the Internet and other media to personally teach millions of students at one time, star teachers will earn at least as much as star athletes.\" Frank and Cook (1995) make a controversial argument that the winner-take-all society is already a reality.  \n\nIronically, the Internet also exerts a countervailing force against the superstar phenomenon. Internet-based services such as Napster.com, MP3.com, or Gnutella. wego.com lower to near-zero the cost of transmitting and reproducing (\"pirating\") intellectual property such as software, music, video, and text. By making intellectual property rights harder to enforce, the Internet could increase the market scope of \"superstars\" without necessarily raising their incomes.?  \n\nThese observations reinforce the view that cheaper job search, integration of labor markets, and on-line delivery of labor services, while beneficial in the aggregate, are not necessarily beneficial to all groups.  \n\n### Institutional Responses: Intermediation Versus Free Agency  \n\nA decline in communications and coordination costs, coupled with the growing feasibility of supplying labor services from remote locations, offers an opportunity to unbundle labor service delivery from the traditional fetters (and comforts) of employment. Many business analysts have argued that labor services will increasingly be supplied by free agents (for example, Malone and Laubacher, 1998; Orlov et al., 1999; Norris, 2000). However, I think it more likely that new labor market institutions will arise to mediate between firms and potentially distant workers. These intermediaries for the electronic labor market will represent and in many cases directly employ skilled workers, vouch for their attributes, and resell their services.  \n\nAt face value, the free agency model of future labor markets appears plausible. A variety of businesses have formed to leverage the opportunities for arms-length labor service delivery provided by free agents. Web sites such as MonsterTalent.com, FreeAgent.com, Guru.com, and SkillsVillage.com offer structured spot market or auction environments where companies can identify and contract with freelancers. These on-line services potentially serve a market-making function, permitting labor markets to operate where previously thinness of buyers and sellers, coupled with high communications costs, would have made transacting prohibitive. For example, one web-based service, Hotdispatch.com, hosts auctions where individual technical freelancers negotiate a price to answer single technical queries posted by individuals or companies.  \n\nHowever, there are serious questions about the viability and reach of these markets. As the potential for geographically remote labor contracting expands, how will electronic labor markets deliver the “high bandwidth\" data needed to foster good matches and mitigate adverse selection?  \n\nOne answer may be standardization. If labor market transactions can be transformed into commodity purchases—for example, through development of detailed, verifiable skill certificates—then new forms of low bandwidth data may substitute for harder to verify high bandwidth data.? While this notion has merit, the intrinsic heterogeneity of workers and jobs probably places an upper limit on the reach of standardization to “commodify\" the labor market.  \n\nAn alternative to standardization—or possibly a complement—is more detailed information disclosure. Perhaps richer personalized on-line data could potentially convey the high bandwidth data that certificates do not. For example, electronic resumes may ultimately provide—in addition to credentials and experience—project portfolios, dockets of customer evaluations, and even standardized personality assessments.  \n\nAs yet, however, there is little evidence to suggest that free agency is booming, and my suspicion is that it will not. As Orlov et al. (1999, p. 12) wryly observes: “Agent-driven [computerized] matching is to the hiring process what a dating service is to getting married—-initial contacts are provided, but people still need to talk.\" Data from the Current Population Survey's Contingent Worker Supplements indicate that between 1995 and 1999, there was a small decline, from 6.7 to 6.2 percent of employment, in the ranks of independent contractors, independent consultants, and freelance workers. During the same interval, the share of workers employed by contract firms—-companies that provide employees or their services on a contract basis— grew by 10 percent, and the share employed by temporary help firms grew 32 percent (Cohany, 1996, 1998; U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1999,2000a).  \n\nIt may be that in the highly credentialed technical and professional labor markets, which may appear to lend themselves most readily to free agency, high bandwidth in-person contact and firsthand knowledge are of great importance. If so, the growing geographic scope of the labor market will augment the demand for labor market intermediaries such as temporary help agencies (Autor, 2000b), service contracting firms, labor unions, and other hybrids. These intermediaries will offer several forms of high bandwidth data that are comparatively difficult for free agents to provide.  \n\nOne function that intermediaries will serve is managing talent. While labor market services may be delivered by wire, in-person managers are likely to continue assisting, monitoring and motivating workers, as well as vetting the effort and quality of labor that they supply to (possibly remote) clients. A second form of high bandwidth data that intermediaries may offer is reputation. Intermediaries, rather than individuals, may find it easier to build reputations, since collective (that is, firm) reputations are potentially more long-lived than individual reputations, are comparatively easy to verify, and appear to play an important role in clients? contracting and purchase decisions.10  \n\nA final form of high bandwidth data where intermediaries may hold comparative advantage is in credibly representing worker quality. Although electronic resumes could readily incorporate employer references and personality tests, this information is fraught with liability issues. It is a common perception that litigation has substantially diluted the value of written employment references, and I suspect it will have a similar effect in on-line markets. In contrast, intermediaries may face strong incentives (again enforced by reputation) to reveal and enforce worker quality.1l Given these factors, I suspect that intermediaries possessing durable reputations will provide their imprimatur, at a price, to comparatively anonymous suppliers of labor services, and thus make arms-length labor transactions viable.  \n\nLabor unions, the most prominent U.S. labor intermediaries, are also likely to be affected. Unions have traditionally bargained collectively on behalf of a firm's workers but played only a small role in facilitating these workers’ movements among firms. Current trends towards greater outsourcing and worker mobility, in part facilitated by the Internet, may reverse these priorities. Intermediaries in increasingly fluid labor markets may need to assume more of a “talent agent\" role, representing workers as they move among firms, negotiating individually for wages and benefits, and offering services traditionally provided by employers. An example of such an organization is Working Today (www.workingtoday.org), which represents, lobbies for, and seeks benefits for independent contractors. Notably, labor unions have petitioned the International Commission on Assigned Names and Numbers (ICAAN) to assign them a new top level Internet domain name called \"dot union\" as in “dot com.\"  \n\n## Conclusion  \n\nThe broadening geographic scope of the labor market will generate new demand for both low and high bandwidth labor market data. The Internet will transmit much of the former, but the latter may not travel well by wire. This informational bottleneck will open opportunities for new institutions to emerge. While it is difficult to say precisely what these institutions will look like, their role is apparent. By supplying high bandwidth data to grease the wheels of the labor market, they will make markets—reducing informational asymmetries that might otherwise thwart labor market transactions.  \n\nI thank Daron Acemoglu, Joshua Angrist, Hoyt Bleakley, Brad De Long, Lawrence Katz, Alan Krueger, Kevin Lang, Frank Leuy, Richard Murnane, Jorn-Steffen Pischue, Timothy Taylor, and Michael Waldman for excellent insights and editorial suggestions.

A model suggested by Ratti and Ullah [5], dealing with uncertainty in the flow of factor inputs, is adapted to consider uncertainty in the hiring process. In the model of discrimination developed here, uncertainty arises from the inability of the employer to perfectly predict the productivity of the workers he hires. Moreover, this uncertainty is asymmetric, the employer has greater difficulty predicting the productivity of minority workers than predicting the productivity of majority workers. Within this framework, discriminatory wage and hiring differentials arise between minority and majority workers even though the employer recognizes that the two groups have equal average productivity.  \n\nConsider a firm that hires workers from a labor market with two easily distinguishable groups, blacks $(B)$ and whites (w). The firm hires $L_{B}$ black workers and $L_{W}$ white workers, however, employers are uncertain of the true on-the-job productivity of any potential employee. That is, the flow of factor services from $L_{B}$ and $L_{W}$ are random variables given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{L_{1}=(a+u_{B})L_{B},}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{L_{2}=(a+u_{W})L_{W},}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $^{a}$ is a constant and $u_{B},u_{W}$ are independent, mean-zero random variables with equal variances such that  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\operatorname*{Pr}[a+u_{B}>0]=\\operatorname*{Pr}[u_{B}>-a]=1,}\\ {\\operatorname*{Pr}[a+u_{W}>0]=\\operatorname*{Pr}[u_{W}>-a]=1.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nOutput is an increasing, concave function of labor inputs only given by $F(L_{1}+L_{2})$ .Assuming that the flow of labor services from black and white workers are perfect substitutes for one another in the production process and that the production function exhibits decreasing marginal returns to additional units of labor, the partial derivatives of the production function have the usual signs, $F^{\\prime}>0$ ? $F^{\\prime\\prime}<0$  \n\nAssume that the firm under uncertainty can be represented by a twice differentiable von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function defined over profits. That is,  \n\n$$\nU(\\varPi)=U(p F(L_{1}+L_{2})-w_{B}L_{B}-w_{W}L_{W})\n$$  \n\n/here $w_{B},w_{W}$ are wages for black and white workers respectively.  \n\nThen, the firm's problem is to select $L_{B}$ and $L_{W}$ to maximize expected utility of profits:  \n\n$$\n\\underset{L_{B}L_{w}}{\\mathrm{Max}}E\\{U(\\Pi)\\}=E\\{U[p F(L_{1}+L_{2})-w_{B}L_{B}-w_{w}L_{w}]\\}.\n$$  \n\nFrom equation (1) we obtain first order conditions for an optimum.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\partial E\\{U\\}/\\partial L_{B}=E\\{U^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{\\Pi})(p F^{\\prime}(a+u_{B})-w_{B}\\}=0,}\\ &{\\partial E\\{U\\}/\\partial L_{W}=E\\{U^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{\\Pi})(p F^{\\prime}(a+u_{W})-w_{W}\\}=0.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe optimal values $\\boldsymbol{L}_{B}^{*}$ and $L_{w}^{\\ast}$ derived from (2a) and (2b) maximize expected utility of profits provided that the following second order conditions hold:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{A_{1}=\\partial^{2}E\\{U\\}/\\partial L_{B}^{2}}\\ &{\\quad=E\\{U^{\\prime\\prime}(I I)(p F^{\\prime}(a+u_{B})-w_{B})^{2}+U^{\\prime}(I I)p(a+u_{B})^{2}F^{\\prime\\prime}\\}<0,}\\ &{A_{2}=\\partial^{2}E\\{U\\}/\\partial L_{W}^{2}}\\ &{\\quad=E\\{U^{\\prime\\prime}(I I)(p F^{\\prime}(a+u_{W})-w_{W})^{2}+U^{\\prime}(I I)p(a+u_{W})^{2}F^{\\prime\\prime}\\}<0,}\\ &{A_{3}=\\partial^{2}E\\{U\\}/\\partial L_{B}\\partial L_{W}}\\ &{\\quad=E\\{U^{\\prime\\prime}(I I)(p F^{\\prime}(a+u_{B})-w_{B})(p F^{\\prime}(a+u_{W})-w_{W})}\\ &{\\quad\\quad\\quad+U^{\\prime}(I I)[p(a+u_{B})(a+u_{W})F^{\\prime\\prime}]\\},}\\ &{\\quad\\quad=A_{1}A_{2}-A_{3}^{2}>0.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFor the risk-neutral firm, an interior solution to problem (1) exists and the second order conditions are satisfied at the optimal point. To see this, note that when $U^{\\prime\\prime}({\\cal{I}})$ equals O both $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ are negative. Then, let  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{Y=(U^{\\prime}(\\varPi)p F^{\\prime\\prime})^{1/2}(a+U_{B}),}\\ {Z=(U^{\\prime}(\\varPi)p F^{\\prime\\prime})^{1/2}(a+u_{W}).}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIt follows that  \n\n$$\nD=E\\{Y^{2}\\}E\\{Z^{2}\\}-E\\{Y Z\\}>0\n$$  \n\nby the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality [8]  \n\nThe model described above predicts wage and hiring discrimination for the risk-neutral firm when employers perceive different degrees of uncertainty in evaluating the productivity of black and white workers.2 These results are stated and proved below in two propositions which establish that: (1) offer wages are lower under uncertainty, (2) when there are two distinct groups of workers in the market, employers substitute away from the group whose productivity is more uncertain.3  \n\nPROPosITioN I. Facing a labor market consisting of two distinct groups of workers with equal average productivity, the risk-neutral firm offers lower wages to individuals from the group whose productivity is uncertain than to individuals from the group whose productivity is known with perfect information.  \n\nTo establish the proposition, the basic model is modified so that the flow of factor services from black workers is uncertain, while the productivity of whites is certain. That is, the firm knowsthat $u_{W}$ takes on its mean value of O with unit probability. Then,  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{L_{1}=(a+u_{B})L_{B},}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{L_{2}=a L_{W},}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{F(L)=F[(a+u_{B})L_{B}+a L_{W}].}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe first order conditions become  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\partial E\\{U\\}/\\partial L_{B}=E\\{(p F^{\\prime}(a+u_{B})-w_{B})\\}=0,}}\\ {{\\partial E\\{U\\}/\\partial L_{W}=E\\{(p F^{\\prime}a-w_{W})\\}=0.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFrom the first order condition (3a),  \n\n$$\np E\\{(a+u_{B})F^{\\prime}\\}=w_{B},\n$$  \n\nso that the equilibrium wage for blacks equals the expected marginal product of $L_{B}$ .The expectation on the left-hand side can be rewritten and simplified to obtain,4  \n\n$$\np a E\\{F^{\\prime}((a+u_{B})L_{B}+a L_{W})\\}+p\\mathrm{Cov}\\{a+u_{B},F^{\\prime}((a+u_{B})L_{B}+a L_{W})\\}=w_{B}.\n$$  \n\nSince the production function is concave, the sign of the covariance term in equation (4) must be negative.s  \n\nUsing the first-order condition (3b) we obtain  \n\n$$\np a E\\{F^{\\prime}((a+u_{B})L_{B}+a L_{W})\\}=w_{W}.\n$$  \n\nThat is, the equilibrium wage for whites equals the expected marginal product of $L_{W}$ .Substituting (5) into (4),  \n\n$$\nw_{W}+p\\mathbf{Cov}\\{a+u_{B},F^{\\prime}((a+u_{B})L_{B}+a L_{W})\\}=w_{B}\n$$  \n\nand white wages exceed black wages at equilibrium.  \n\nThe risk-neutral firm offers greater returns to a factor with certain productivity than to a factor whose productivity is uncertain. To the firm, the expected marginal product of black workers is less than the expected marginal product of white workers because the increased likelihood of hiring a black worker with below-average productivity is not offset by the equal increased likelihood of hiring a black worker with above-average productivity. This result follows directly from the concavity of the production function that generates the negative covariance term in (4).  \n\nProposition I demonstrates that discriminatory wage differentials can result from employer uncertainty. Although all workers are paid the expected value of their marginal product, the labor market is discriminatory in the sense that two groups of workers with equal average productivity receive unequal average wages.6 Furthermore, in this model wage differentials are not the only manifestation of employer discrimination. The second proposition states that the probability of employment for minority workers also falls relative to the probability of employment for majority workers when employers perceive greater uncertainty regarding the productivity of the minority group.  \n\nPROPOsITioN II. Employers substitute away from a group of workers whose qualifications are less certain in favor of workers whose ability is more certain despite the fact that the average worker in each group is equally productive.  \n\nTo establish Proposition Il, examine the comparative statics of the modified model,  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{L_{1}=(a+c u_{B})L_{B},}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{L_{2}=(a+u_{W})L_{W}.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe productivity distribution of white workers is unchanged. The degree of uncertainty in the flow of factor services from black workers relative to white workers is regulated by the nonnegative shift parameter $c$ . In particular, when $c>1$ the black distribution is more disperse than the white distribution and, conversely, when $c<1$ the black distribution is relatively more clustered around its mean.  \n\nIn the adjusted model, first order conditions become  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{E\\{(p F^{\\prime}(a+c u_{B})-w_{B}\\}=0,}\\ {E\\{(p F_{.}^{\\prime}(a+u_{W})-w_{W}\\}=0.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nTo examine the effect of changes in $c$ on the employment of blacks and whites, totally differentiate (6a) and (6b) with respect to $c,L_{B},L_{W}$ , and evaluate $\\partial L_{B}/\\partial c$ and $\\partial L_{W}/\\partial c$ for $c=1$ It follows that,  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\partial L_{B}/\\partial c=(1/D)[E\\{p(a+u_{B})(a+u_{W})F^{\\prime\\prime}\\}E\\{p(a+u_{W})u_{B}L_{B}F^{\\prime\\prime}\\}}\\ &{\\qquad-E\\{p u_{B}((a+u_{B})L_{B}F^{\\prime\\prime}+F^{\\prime})\\}E\\{p(a+u_{W})^{2}F^{\\prime\\prime}\\}],}\\ &{\\partial L_{W}/\\partial c=(1/D)[E\\{p(a+u_{B})(a+u_{W})F^{\\prime\\prime}\\}E\\{p u_{B}(a+u_{B})L_{B}F^{\\prime\\prime}+F^{\\prime}\\}]\\}}\\ &{\\qquad-E\\{p F^{\\prime\\prime}(a+u_{B})^{2}\\}E\\{p u_{B}(a+u_{W})L_{B}F^{\\prime\\prime}\\}].}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nUnambiguous signs for the partial derivatives in (7a) and (7b) can be established with reasonable restrictions on the elasticity of the marginal product curve of factor services and on the signs of the third derivatives of the production function. In particular, let $\\varepsilon_{i}$ $(i=1,2)$ represent the elasticity of the marginal product curve for factor services. Then,  \n\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{i}=(L_{i}F^{\\prime\\prime})/F^{\\prime}.\n$$  \n\nIn what follows, assume that $\\varepsilon_{i}$ is nonincreasing in factor services and always less than one in absolute value.7 That is,  \n\n$$\n\\partial\\varepsilon_{i}/\\partial L_{i}\\equiv0,\\quad\\left|\\varepsilon_{i}\\right|<1.\n$$  \n\nIn addition, it is reasonable to assume that, for this model, the signs of the third derivatives of the production function are positive. As Rothenburg and Smith [6] point out, for most production functions used in empirical work, third derivatives are positive when the factors are substitutes. Therefore,assume that  \n\n$$\nF^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}=\\partial F^{\\prime\\prime}/\\partial L_{i}>0.\n$$  \n\nUnder these assumptions, the signs of the partial derivatives (7a) and $(7\\mathbf{b})$ can be determined. Since $D>0$ ，thesignof $\\partial L_{B}/\\partial c$ is the same as the sign of the bracketed expression on the right-hand side of (7a). Examine the sign of each of the four terms within this expression in turn.  \n\nFirst,  \n\n$$\nE\\{p(a+u_{B})(a+u_{W})F^{\\prime\\prime}\\}<0\n$$  \n\nby the assumptions of the model.  \n\nSecond,  \n\n$$\nE\\{p(a+u_{W})u_{B}L_{B}F^{\\prime\\prime}\\}>0.\n$$  \n\nTo see this, consider the left-hand side of (10b) to be the expectation of a product and rewrite it as  \n\n$$\nE\\{u_{B}\\}E\\{p(a+u_{W})L_{B}F^{\\prime\\prime}\\}+\\mathrm{Cov}\\{u_{B},p(a+u_{W})L_{B}F^{\\prime\\prime}\\}\n$$  \n\nwhere the first term equals zero. The sign of the covariance term is determined by,  \n\n$$\n\\partial F^{\\prime\\prime}/\\partial u_{B}=F^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}L_{B}\n$$  \n\n7. Ratti and Ullah [5, 705] point out that many familiar forms for the production function $F$ satisfy these assumptions.  \n\nwhich is positive from (9).  \n\nThird,  \n\n$$\nE\\{p u_{B}((a+u_{B})L_{B}F^{\\prime\\prime}+F^{\\prime})\\}<0.\n$$  \n\nIn a similar manner to what was described above, the expression in (10c) can be treated as the expectation of a product and rewritten so that only a covariance term remains. Thus,  \n\n$$\nE\\{p u_{B}((a+u_{B})L_{B}F^{\\prime\\prime}+F^{\\prime})\\}=\\mathrm{Cov}\\{u_{B},p[(a+u_{B})L_{B}F^{\\prime\\prime}+F^{\\prime}]\\}.\n$$  \n\nIt is straightforward to show that  \n\n$$\n(a+u_{B})L_{B}F^{\\prime\\prime}+F^{\\prime}=L_{1}F^{\\prime\\prime}+F^{\\prime}=F^{\\prime}(1+\\varepsilon_{1}).\n$$  \n\nHence, the sign of the covariance term is determined by the sign of  \n\n$$\n\\partial F^{\\prime}(1+\\varepsilon_{1})/\\partial u_{B}=p[(\\varepsilon_{1}+1)F^{\\prime\\prime}L_{B}+F^{\\prime}\\partial\\varepsilon_{i}/\\partial U_{B}],\n$$  \n\nwhich is negative by the assumptions of the model and (8).  \n\nFourth,  \n\n$$\nE\\{p(a+u_{W})^{2}F^{\\prime\\prime}\\}<0,\n$$  \n\nsince $(a+u_{W})^{2}$ is always positive and  \n\n$$\np>0,\\quad{\\cal F}^{\\prime\\prime}<0\n$$  \n\nby assumption.  \n\nCombining the results of (10a), (10b), (10c), and (10d), it is clear that the right-hand side of (7a) is negative and, therefore  \n\n$$\n\\partial L_{B}/\\partial c<0.\n$$  \n\nIn a similar manner it can be shown that  \n\n$$\n\\partial L_{W}/\\partial c>0.\n$$  \n\nHence, black employment declines as employers’ uncertainty regarding the true productivity of black workers increases, whereas white employment increases with uncertainty regarding black productivity. Proposition II is established.  \n\nThe propositions developed in this paper demonstrate that discriminatory outcomes can be derived from plausible assumptions in a model in which the fow of labor services is uncertain. The proofs require the usual restrictions on the firm's production function as well as stipulations regarding the signs of its third derivatives and the elasticity of the marginal product curve of factor services. Attention is confined to the case of the risk-neutral firm because the signs of the partial derivatives in the proof of Proposition II are ambiguous when $U^{\\prime\\prime}(\\varPi)\\neq0$  \n\nIn the model presented here, uncertainty arises from the employer's inability to perfectly predict the productivity of workers that the firm hires and from the employer's perception of greater difficulty in predicting the productivity of workers from the minority group. Within this framework, a mean-preserving spread in the distribution of factor services from one type of labor leads to a decline in demand for that group and an increase in demand for its substitute.  \n\nAn advantage of the model presented here is that it yields empirically testable implications. The model predicts that any factors that reduce employer uncertainty regarding the true qualifications of minority workers or reduce the costs of making mistakes in the hiring process will reduce discrimination. Thus, employers who have greater experience hiring minority workers, or who are able to obtain specific job-related information regarding the qualifications of applicants, will discriminate less. On the other hand, employers who incur greater costs in hiring and training workers will discriminate more.  \n\nThis paper demonstrates that discriminatory outcomes can be derived within the framework of a model of the firm under uncertainty without the traditional assumptions that employers exhibit “tastes” for discrimination or mistakenly believe minority workers are less productive, on average, than the majority group. In this model, discrimination is the optimal response of profitmaximizing employers who perceive different degrees of uncertainty regarding the productivity of majority and minority workers and who transfer the costs of this uncertainty to their minority workers.  \n\nMarjorie Baldwin East Carolina University Greenville, North Carolina  \n\n### References  \n\n1.

Results derived are quite different from, or unexplored by, the standard human capital theory. We show that the information asymmetry can cause an externality distortion in human capital investment because higher productivity due to the investment may not be recognized by the market. The investment level increases in the degree of firm specificity of human capital. The underinvestment problem is more severe when human capital is general than when it is firm-specific.  \n\nIn a book on welfare economics published in 1912, Pigou conjectured that the training provided by employers to workers is likely to fall considerably short of the social optimal level. His reasoning is as follows: \"Since workpeople are liable to change employers, and so to deprive . . . [employers] of their investment, the private net product is apt to fall considerably short of the social net product. Hence, socially profitable expenditure by employers in the training of their workpeople . : . does not carry a corresponding private profit\" (Pigou 1912; p. 153). Half a century later,  \n\nAn earlier version of this paper was presented at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and a workshop at the Industrial Relations Center, the University of Minnesota. We thank John Budd, Ed Green, John Kareken, John Krainer, Brian McCall, Ed Prescott, Michael Waldman, and Neil Wallace for comments.  \n\nthe works of Becker (1962), Oi (1962), Parsons (1972), and the literature that followed have demonstrated the importance of human capital investment to workers' productivity, labor turnover, wage determination, and other labor market phenomena. The human capital theory has since become a cornerstone of the modern labor economics. An important result of the theory is that, since training can increase a worker's future wage, competition among untrained workers for jobs with more training will lower the starting wage. Consequently, it is the worker who pays the cost of training, and the externality problem conjectured by Pigou cannot exist.  \n\nIn the past 2 decades, economists have become increasingly aware of the significance of various asymmetric information problems in the labor market. One such problem arises when a worker's current employer has better information about the worker's productivity than other potential employers. Models exploring the implications of this informational probIem have deepened our understanding of labor turnover patterns (Greenwald 1986; Lazear 1986), job assignments (Waldman 1984), job discrimination (Milgrom and Oster 1987), wage changes following layoffs (Gibbons and Katz 1991), labor contracts (Kahn and Huberman 1988; Waldman 1990), and other important labor market phenomena. However, the effects of information asymmetry on human capital investment and the relationships among human capital investment, wages, and labor turnover in the presence of asymmetric information have not been adequately explored.  \n\nIn this paper, we study the private incentives to make human capital investment when a worker's current employer knows more about the amount of human capital that the worker possesses than other potential employers. We show that, compared to the socially optimal (first-best) outcome under the assumption of symmetric information, the asymmetric information problem distorts the incentives for human capital investment in two ways. First, when the market wage for a job-changing worker is based on the conjectured rather than the actual amount of human capital that the worker possesses, the marginal social benefit of an additional investment is not recognized, and therefore not compensated for, by the market. Thus the asymmetric information problem can cause the externality distortion suggested by Pigou. Second, when information is asymmetric, a wage contract contingent on a worker's actual productivity is not enforceable. Even if a worker does not change jobs, the employer and the worker will share the rent created by the investment in future wage bargaining. The sharing prospect dampens investment incentives and gives rise to the sharing distortion.1  \n\nOur approach yields several important findings that are quite different from the standard human capital theory. Under the assumption of frictionless economy, the standard theory shows that investment decisions and turnover decisions can be separately analyzed. This separation result no longer holds under information asymmetry. When potential employers cannot observe the actual investment, the investing party, a firm or a worker, cannot reap the marginal benefit of an investment if the worker leaves the firm. Thus, the marginal benefit of human capital investment depends only on the retention rate (one minus the turnover rate). In this sense, one can say that a higher turnover rate leads to less human capital investment.2  \n\nSince, as we will show, the negative relationship between human capital investment and turnover can hold regardless of the degree of (exogenous) firm specificity of human capital, it can hold even when human capital is completely general. We thus establish a negative relationship between general human capital and labor turnover, while the standard theory implies that turnover is independent of general human capital investment.  \n\nAlthough government-sponsored job training programs receive much attention in policy debates, little is known about the kinds of training the private sector has the least incentives to provide. We show that, under asymmetric information, the investment level is increasing in the firm specificity of human capital. The underinvestment problem is less severe when human capital is more firm-specific. This is so because firm-specific human capital provides little benefit to other firms, and consequently the externality distortion is small. In contrast, if information is symmetric, the investment level is higher when human capital is general than when it is firm-specific because the former has a greater market value.  \n\nScoones and Bernhardt (1995) investigate workers′ incentive to make human capital investment under asymmetric information. There are two main differences between their model and ours. First, while we assume that firms are asymmetrically informed about the amount of human capital a worker has acquired, they assume that firms are asymmetrically informed about workers' innate ability.3 Second, we identify the incentive to underinvest given the degree of firm specificity of human capital, whereas they focus on the choice between general investment and firm-specific investment given the quantity of investment. As a result, our results are complimentary to, but different from, theirs.  \n\nThis article proceeds as follows. The model and assumptions are laid out in the next section. Section II characterizes the equilibrium. Section III studies the effects of asymmetric information and the degree of firm specificity on human capital investment. It also examines the relationship between labor turnover and human capital investment. Section IV concludes the article.  \n\n## 1. The Model  \n\n### A. Technology, Preferences, and Information  \n\nIn the economy there are many similar firms and workers. A worker's productivity depends on the level of human capital investment and the quality of a random job match. Initially, we assume that the employer makes the human capital investment. In Section IV below, we show that, when the worker rather than the firm makes the investment, the results are essentially unchanged. For simplicity, we refer to the frm's human capital investment as “'training.\"  \n\nThere are three dates, dates 0, 1, and 2, and two periods given by these three dates, that is, period 1 between dates 0 and 1 and period 2 between dates 1 and 2. The timing of events is as follows. At date O, the firm offers a first-period wage. The worker can either accept or reject the offer. If the offer is accepted, the first-period employment relation begins. In this period, the worker's productivity equals the quality of the job match with the firm. Also in this period, the frm provides training to the worker. At date 1, the market (other potential employers) can bid the worker away at a market wage. The worker's productivity in the second period will depend on whether he moves to another frm or not. His second-period wage may be either a wage negotiated with the current employer or the market wage offered by a new employer. The worker retires from the labor market at date 2.  \n\nTraining at a level $b$ increases the worker's second-period productivity by $b$ It costs the firm $c(b)$ where the function $c(b)$ has the standard properties that $c^{\\prime}(b)>0$ and $c^{\\prime\\prime}(b)>0$ for $b>0$ . To avoid corner solutions, we also assume that $c^{\\prime}(0)=0$  \n\nFormally, if a worker stays with the same employer in both periods 1 and 2, his productivity is given by  \n\n$$\nx_{1}=m+\\xi,\\qquad\\mathrm{and}\\qquadx_{2}=b+m+\\xi,\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\xi$ is a zero-mean random variable representing the job match (or other firm-specific productivity) quality and $m$ is the mean productivity of an untrained worker.4 Without loss of generality, we assume that $m=0$  \n\nThe random variable, $\\xi$ , has a continuously differentiable cumulative distribution function $F(\\xi)$ defined on the real line. The realization of this random variable is assumed to be the same in both periods if the worker does not change jobs.  \n\nIf the worker changes jobs, the productivity with the new employer will be  \n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{y}=\\boldsymbol{\\updelta}\\boldsymbol{b}+\\boldsymbol{\\upeta},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\mathfrak{n}}$ is a zero-mean random variable that measures the quality of the job match with the new employer and 8, a fixed number in [0, 1], measures the degree of firm specificity of training. The degree of firm specificity of training 8 is exogenous to our model. The random variables $\\boldsymbol{\\mathfrak{n}}$ and $\\xi$ are independent.  \n\nFor simplicity, the worker is assumed to be risk-neutral and to maximize a utility function of the form $w_{1}+w_{2}$ ,where $\\boldsymbol{{w}}_{t}$ is the worker's wage in period $t=1$ , 2. We assume that a new worker will accept a frm's offer for employment if $E[w_{1}+w_{2}]$ is no less than the reservation utility level u. Demand for and supply of new workers determine $\\varkappa_{\\cdot}$ , which we take as exogenous to the model.  \n\nFirms are assumed to maximize expected profit, which is the sum of a worker's two-period productivities net of the wage payments and the training cost.  \n\nIn the spirit of the asymmetric information models mentioned in the introduction, we assume that the worker's current employer has an information advantage over other potential employers about the worker's human capital investment and productivity. In particular, we assume that the training level $b$ and the realization of the job match quality $\\xi$ become known to the worker and his current employer but are too costly for outsiders to evaluate.5  \n\nB. Wages, Profit, and Participation Constraint  \n\nBecause the realized match quality and the training level $b$ cannotbe observed by outsiders, enforceable contracts cannot be made contingent on them. This means that the first-period wage has to be a constant.  \n\n4 This technology is similar to the one used by Jovanovic (1979, p. 1250) to study the relationships among worker's job search, firm-specific human capital investment, wage, and turnover under symmetric information.  \n\n5 To be sure, job-changing workers can be screened at a cost. One might also argue that the screening cost is increasing in the specificity of training so that the degree of information asymmetry may increase with specificity. These issues can affect some of our results. The basic point that information asymmetry introduces externality is unaffected, however.  \n\nThis content downloaded from 205.208.116.024 on November 17, 2017 08:56:50 AM ll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-an  \n\nHowever, since the frm and the worker both know the worker's secondperiod productivity if the worker stays with the firm as well as the wage offer the worker can obtain from the market, the second-period wage can be negotiated through bargaining. We assume that the outcome is determined by the Nash bargaining solution (Nash 1950).6  \n\nSuppose that the market wage for a job-changing worker is w (w will be specified shortly). That is, if a worker and his current employer cannot agree on a wage level after the first period and the worker leaves, the worker will receive $\\boldsymbol{w}$ from a new employer. The firm's expected net profit in the second period will be zero if the worker leaves. Thus, the disagreement point for the bargaining problem between the worker and his current employer is $(w,0)$ . The Nash solution implies that the worker's second period wage is  \n\n$$\n\\cdot w_{2}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{w+[x_{2}-w]/2}&{\\mathrm{if~}x_{2}\\geq w,}\\ {\\quad}&{\\mathrm{if~}x_{2}<w,}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nwhere $x_{2}=\\xi+b$ is known to the worker and his current employer at the time of bargaining.  \n\nEquation (1) states that, when the worker's second-period productivity is lower than the market wage, he will leave and receive wage w from the market. Otherwise, he will receive $\\boldsymbol{\\varpi}$ plus half of the rent of staying with the firm.  \n\nThe firm's second-period profit $\\scriptstyle{p_{2}}$ is the difference between $x_{2}$ and $\\varpi_{2}$ when the worker stays and is zero otherwise:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{p_{2}=\\left\\{{\\begin{array}{l l}{[x_{2}+w]/2-w}&{\\mathrm{if}x_{2}\\geq w,}\\ {0}&{\\mathrm{if}x_{2}<w.}\\end{array}}\\right.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nSince the firm's choice of $b$ is not observable by outsiders, the labor market will use its conjecture about $b$ to determine $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{w}}$ Let $b^{c}$ be the market's conjecture about the worker's training level. The conjectured productivity of a job-changing worker at a new firm is $\\updelta{\\boldsymbol{b}}^{c}$ . Assume that the market for  \n\n6 Allowing for other bargaining solutions or sequential bargaining (Rubinstein   \n1982) only changes the weights in which the rent is divided.  \n\n7 The sharing rule here is not the same as that in Hashimoto (1981). There the problem is how to share the cost of a human capital investment when the worker and the employer have different evaluations of the employment relationship and make quit or layoff decisions unilaterally. Our model does not distinguish between quits and layoffs. Separation follows the principle of \"joint wealth maximization' as in Mortensen (1978) and is socially optimal.  \n\nThis content downloaded from 205.208.116.024 on November 17, 2017 08:56:50 AM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-andexperienced workers is competitive. The job-changing worker's wage will be equal to his conjectured productivity in a new firm:8  \n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{w}=8b^{c}.\n$$  \n\nNote that, since there is no bargaining cost, separation occurs when the worker's conjectured productivity is higher outside $(x_{2}<\\delta b^{c})$ .As in many models based on asymmetric information, there is no distinction between a layoff and quitting in our model.  \n\nWe can now write a new worker's voluntary participation constraint. The worker will receive $\\varpi_{1}$ in the first period. His second-period wage is determined by (1) (the condition $x_{2}\\geq w$ is equivalent to $\\xi\\ge\\updelta b^{c}-b)$ . Note that, instead of using the firm's actual choice $b_{:}$ the worker uses the market expectation $b^{c}$ in deciding whether to participate. This is because, at the time a new worker decides to join the firm, $b$ has not been chosen yet. The new worker's participation constraint is  \n\n$$\nw_{1}+\\int_{\\updelta b^{c}-b^{c}}^{\\infty}\\{w+[(1-\\updelta)b^{\\mathrm{c}}+\\upxi]/2\\}d F(\\upxi)+F(\\updelta b^{\\mathrm{c}}-b^{\\mathrm{c}})w\\geq u.\n$$  \n\n### I1. Training Levels under Symmetric and Asymmetric Information  \n\nWe first derive the socially optimal (frst-best) training level. The expected second-period social return from training is the weighted average of the returns when a worker separates, $F(\\updelta b\\textrm{--}b)\\updelta b$ .and when he does not separate, $E[b+\\xi|\\xi\\geq\\delta b-b]\\mathrm{pr}(\\xi\\geq\\delta b-b)$ . We have assumed that separation occurs efficiently, that is, it occurs when $x_{2}=b+\\xi$ is lower than $\\delta b$ The social cost of training is $c(b)$ . The socially optimal (frst-best) training level is the one that provides  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{max}_{b}\\int_{\\&b-b}^{\\infty}(b+\\xi)d F(\\xi)+F(\\&b-b)\\&b-c(b)-u.\n$$  \n\nLet $b^{*}$ denote the training level that is socially optimal. The first-order condition that gives $b^{*}$ is  \n\n8 If the number of experienced workers and the number of positions for them are about the same, the gain $\\updelta{\\cal b}^{c}$ can be divided between the worker and his new employer. That case is considered in an earlier version of this article. In that case, a firm that loses a worker will get a worker from another firm. The same results areobtained.  \n\nThis content downloaded from 205.208.116.024 on November 17, 2017 08:56:50 AM ll use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-ar  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{1-(1-\\updelta)F(\\updelta b^{*}-b^{*})-c^{\\prime}(b^{*})=0.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nSince the lost value of training due to a job change is $1-\\updelta$ the marginal social benefit of training is $[1-(1-\\S)F(\\S b^{*}-b^{*})]$ , while marginal social cost is $c^{\\prime}(b^{*})$  \n\nUnder asymmetric information about $b$ , the situation is more complex. An equilibrium consists of the firm's choice of training level $b^{c}$ , its choice of first period wage $\\varpi_{1}$ , and the market's expectation $b^{c}$ such that $(a)$ given $b^{c}$ $\\varpi_{1}$ , and $b^{c}$ maximize the firm's expected profit subject to the worker's participation constraint (4); and $(b)$ the market's expectation is correct: $b^{c}$ $={b^{e}}$  \n\nUsing (2), the firm's profit maximization problem can be written as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}{\\lefteqn{\\operatorname*{max}_{w_{1},b}-w_{1}-c(b)+\\int_{8b^{c}-b}^{\\infty}{[(8b^{c}+b+\\xi)/2-w]d F(\\xi)}}}\\ &{}&{+F(8b^{c}-b)[8b^{c}-w].}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nsubject to equation (4).  \n\nIt is easy to see that the participation constraint (4) is binding in equilibrium. Otherwise, $\\varpi_{1}$ can always be reduced to increase the firm's profit. The constraint (4) is thus replaced with  \n\n$$\n{w}_{1}=u-\\int_{\\delta h^{c}-b^{c}}^{\\infty}\\{w+[(1-\\delta)b^{c}+\\xi]/2\\}d F(\\xi)-F(\\S b^{c}-b^{c})w.\n$$  \n\nNote that the firm's equilibrium level of training $b^{e}$ is not affected by (8), for (8) involves only $b^{c}$ the conjectured level of $b$ . By differentiating the objective function in (7) with respect to $b$ . we obtain the first-order condition for the equilibrium $b$ under asymmetric information,  \n\n$$\n[1-F(\\delta b^{c}-b)]/2-c^{\\prime}(b)=0,\n$$  \n\nin which $[1-F(\\bar{\\mathbf{\\delta}}b^{c}-b)]/2$ is the marginal benefit of training to the firm, and $c^{\\prime}(b)$ the marginal cost. In the term that stands for marginal benefit, a factor $1/2$ is present because any gain in second-period productivity is divided equally between the firm and the worker through Nash bargaining. A closer look at condition (9) reveals the many factors that determine the frm's training level are subsumed in the turnover rate. The firm only needs to see the turnover rate to determine the equilibrium training level. This is important later when we study the relationship between investment and turnover.  \n\nThis content downloaded from 205.208.116.024 on November 17, 2017 08:56:50 AM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-an  \n\nAn equilibrium now becomes a solution of $w_{1},b^{e},$ and $b^{c}$ to the three equations, (8), (9), and $b^{c}=b^{e}$ .

Suppose that the second-order condition holds. Then both the socially optimal training level $b^{*}$ and the equilibrium training level $b^{e}$ exist, and both are unique.  \n\nThe proof of proposition 1 and those of all other propositions are in the appendix. For the remainder of this article, we assume that the secondorder condition is satisfied.  \n\n### IIl. Asymmetric Information, Specificity of Training, and Turnover  \n\nA. The Effects of Information Asymmetry on Training  \n\nWhen information is symmetric, many arrangements can be used to achieve the socially optimal training level $b^{*}$ . For example, one arrangement is as follows: the firm pays a new worker $u/2$ in the frst period; in the second period the firm pays the worker $\\boldsymbol{w_{2}}=\\boldsymbol{u}/2$ if there is no separation, or $[(u/2)-w]$ if there is separation ( $\\mathbf{\\chi}_{\\mathcal{W}}$ being the worker's market wage). Under this arrangement, if the training level is at $b^{*}$ , the market wage will be $\\delta\\boldsymbol{b}^{*}$ under symmetric information. Since the worker's second period wage is $\\scriptstyle{\\mathcal{u}}/2$ whether he leaves or not, the firm will let him leave whenever $x_{2}-u/2<0-[u/2-w]$ or $b^{*}+\\xi<\\updelta b^{*}$ . That is, the separation decision is socially optimal. Moreover, since the worker's total compensation is always $\\varkappa.$ , the firm will receive all the benefit of choosing $b^{*}$ . Thus, it will do so, and the frst-best is achieved under symmetric information.  \n\nWhen the worker's potential employers cannot observe $b_{:}$ the first-best training level $b^{*}$ can no longer be achieved. We can compare (6) and (10) to see the effects of asymmetric information on training. Two differences are found from the comparison. First, (10) derived under asymmetric information does not have a factor $^{1-\\delta}$ before $F(\\mathrm{~{~\\small~\\alpha~}~})$ , that is, it lacks a term like $\\delta F(\\quad)$ as found in (6). This term represents the marginal benefit of the investment to other employers when the worker changes job. When information is symmetric, the firm receives the social benefit of a marginal increase in training because the resulting higher $\\boldsymbol{w}$ received by the jobchanging worker allows the firm to reduce the first-period wage $\\varpi_{1}$ . Under asymmetric information, w cannot depend on the actual investment level. Consequently, the firm will ignore the marginal social benefit of investment, leading to an externality distortion.  \n\nSecond, the first term in (10), which represents the marginal benefit of investment, is divided by two. This is so because no contract contingent on realized productivity can be signed, and the part of the benefit of investment that exceeds the outside alternative has to be shared with the worker. This creates a sharing distortion in the firm's investment incentives.  \n\nBoth the externality distortion and the sharing distortion reduce the frm's incentive to provide training to the worker. We have our second result.  \n\nPROPOsITION 2. Under symmetric information, the firm's training level equals the socially optimal level $b^{*}$ . Under asymmetric information, the equilibrium level of training $b^{e}$ is lower than $b^{*}$  \n\n## B. The Effects of Firm Specificity of Human Capital on Training  \n\nProposition 2 tells us that, with a given degree of frm specificity of training measured by 8 (a larger 8 means that human capital is more general), asymmetric information leads to an equilibrium training level lower than what is socially optimal. The effect of a change in 8 on the level of training also depends on whether information is symmetric or asymmetric, as shown in proposition 3.  \n\nPROPOsITION 3. Under symmetric information, the training level is higher when human capital is completely general than when it is completely firm-specific; that is, $\\bar{b}^{*}(1)>b^{*}(0)$ . Under asymmetric information, the equilibrium training level decreases in 8, that is, $b^{e\\prime}(8)<0$  \n\nProposition 3 implies that $[b^{*}(1)-b^{e}(1)]>[b^{*}(0)-b^{e}(0)]$ Wethusknow that the underinvestment problem under asymmetric information is more severe when human capital is completely general than when it is completely firm-specific.  \n\nThe intuition for the second part of proposition 3 is fairly straightforward. An inspection of equation (10) reveals that a change in 8 affects the externality distortion caused by the informational asymmetry. A larger 8 means that the market wage for a job-changing worker is higher. Job change is thus more likely and the expected return to the training frm becomes lower. This means that the externality distortion is more severe, leading to a lower equilibrium training level. A smaller 8 has exactly the opposite effect.  \n\nThis content downloaded from 205.208.116.024 on November 17, 2017 08:56:50 AM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-an  \n\nThe intuition for the frst part of proposition 3 is as follows. When information is symmetric, there is no externality distortion. However, some value of training is lost in labor turnover due to the specificity of training. Besides $c^{\\prime}(b)$ , the marginal cost of training under symmetric information is the expected marginal loss of value due to training specificity, that is, the product of the probability of turnover, $F(\\updelta b-b)$ , and the marginal loss, $l-\\delta$ (the second term in the square brackets in equation (6)). In the extreme when $\\delta=0$ . training is worth nothing to another employer, whereas when $\\delta=1$ there is no loss of training investment. When the training is completely general $(\\updelta=1)$ 9, this expected marginal loss is zero. When it is completely specific $(\\S=0)$ , the expected loss is $F(-b)>0$ Thus, the firm has a stronger incentive to invest in human capital when $\\delta=1$ than when $\\updelta=0$ 10  \n\n### C. The Relationship between Training and Turnover  \n\nIn the standard human capital theory derived under symmetric information, investment decisions and turnover decisions can be separated. Consequently, the existing literature has studied the relationship between human capital investment and labor turnover by taking the amount of human capital as given. The standard theory implies that the labor turnover rate is unrelated to the training level if training is not firm-specific and is negatively related to the training level otherwise. We now reexamine this relationship under asymmetric information. Since the investment level and the turnover rate are determined simultaneously, we need to look at their relationship as the model's exogenous variables (such as 8, the distribution function of the job match quality, the reservation utility level $\\varkappa_{\\cdot}$ or the training cost function) change.  \n\nSince the turnover rate in our model is $F(\\updelta b-b)$ , (10) can be rewritten as  \n\n$$\nc^{\\prime}(b^{e})=[1-\\mathrm{LaborTurnoverRate}]/2.\n$$  \n\nEquation (11) is a direct consequence of the externality effect due to asymmetric information. At the margin the firm can obtain the benefit of its investment, regardless of the degree of specificity, only when the worker stays with the frm. Since exogenous variables (except the cost function $c(b))$ of the model influence the training level through the turnover rate, in one sense one can say that the training level is determined by the labor turnoverrate.  \n\nOne interesting aspect of equation (11) is that, except for the cost function $c(b)$ , none of the model's other exogenous variables directly appears in (11). Since $c^{\\prime\\prime}(b)>0$ . the relationship between $b^{e}$ and the turnover rate is negative when a change in any of the model's exogenous variables, except the cost function, leads to changes in $b^{e}$ and the turnover rate. When the cost function $c(b)$ changes, it has a direct influence on the relationship (11) between training and turnover. An increase in the marginal cost $c^{\\prime}(b)$ (for all $b$ ) will directly reduce the turnover rate. At the same time, an increase in $c^{\\prime}(b)$ will also reduce $b^{e}$ , which indirectly increases the turnover rate through (11). We can prove, however, that the direct effect is larger than the indirect effect. We thus have proposition 4.  \n\nPROPOSITION 4. For a given cost function, if a change in the model's exogenous variables leads to a higher (lower) turnover, it also leads to a lower (higher) equilibrium level of training. A higher (lower) marginal training cost $c^{\\prime}(b)$ leads to a lower (higher) level of training and a higher (lower) rate of turnover.  \n\nSince the result of proposition 4 holds regardless of the specificity of human capital, it has an implication that is different from the standard human capital theory that turnover is independent of general human capital investment.  \n\nCOROLLARY. Even when the firm's training is completely general $(\\updelta=1)$ 9, there can be a negative relationship between the turnover rate and the training level.  \n\n## IV. Concluding Remarks  \n\nUnlike the standard human capital theory, we have shown that the incentives to make human capital investment can be distorted by an externality. The cause of the externality, however, is not exactly the one suggested by Pigou (1912); that is, the employer will lose its investment in a worker when the worker leaves. More precisely, the externality is due to potential employers’ inability to compensate fully for the investment in the presence of asymmetric information. This logic suggests that who makes the investment is not crucial to the existence of the externality.  \n\nIn fact, we can show that our results are not affected if the cost of human capital investment is directly borne by the worker. The reason is that, under asymmetric information, the worker, like the firm, cannot expect the market to fully recognize the value of, and thus to reward, the investment. To see this more clearly, let the worker choose $b$ and the firm choose $\\varpi_{1}$ to meet the worker's ex ante participation constraint. In this case, once $b$ is invested, the second-period bargaining problem is exactly the same as before so that the sharing rules are given again by (1) and (2). In addition, equation (3) that determines the market wage is unchanged. The worker's choice problem is  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{max}_{b}w_{1}+\\int_{\\delta b^{c}-b}^{\\infty}[w+(b-8b^{c}+\\xi)/2]d F(\\xi)+F(8b^{c}-b)w-c(b).\n$$  \n\nNote that the difference between the worker's expected payoff in (12) and in (4) is that, while the worker still takes the market conjectured gain from turnover $\\updelta{\\not p}^{c}$ as given, he does not take as given the effect of an increase in $b$ on his second-period wage within the firm. This is because the choice of $b$ is his. Thus, there are several places where $b^{c}$ is replaced with $b.$ . The frst-order condition for (12) is exactly the same as equation (9) because, as before, the worker has to share the benefit whenever his second-period productivity is above his market value. Since the first-order condition is the same and $\\varpi_{1}$ is still determined by the constraint (4), the analysis is exactly the same as before.  \n\nOf course, that the analysis is quantitatively the same is due to the fact that the worker and the firm have equal bargaining power. Otherwise, the sharing distortion would depend on who makes the investment. The results would be the same qualitatively, but not quantitatively.  \n\nThe result linking training to the degree of frm specificity of human capital has implications for policies regarding government-sponsored training programs. The model has shown that under asymmetric information private incentive for human capital investment is weaker when human capital is more general than when it is more firm-specific. Thus, if the government is to intervene, our model suggests that training programs that provide more general skills are likely to yield greater social gains, other things being equal.11  \n\n## Appendix  \n\n### Proofs  \n\nProof of Proposition 1. Since conjectured training level is involved in defining an equilibrium, the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium are not so trivial. An equilibrium exists if equation (1o) has a solution. Let us denote the left-hand side of (10) by ${\\hat{S}}(b^{e})$ . It is positive when $b^{e}$ $=0$ because $c^{\\prime}(0)~=~0$ .Since $c^{\\prime\\prime}(b)>0$ $c^{\\prime}(b)$ approaches infinity as $b$ increases. The first term in (10) is bounded by $1/2$ Thus, $S(b^{e})$ is negative for $b$ sufficiently large. Consequently, there exists an $b^{e}>0$ that satisfies $S(b^{e})=0$ . When the second-order condition is met, $S(b^{e})$ is decreasing. Thus, the equilibrium is unique. When we replace equation (10) with equation (6), we obtain the proof for the existence and uniqueness of the first-best outcome. Q.E.D.  \n\nProof of Proposition 2. The left-hand side of (10), $[1-F(\\delta b-b)]/2$ $-\\mathbf{\\nabla}c^{\\prime}(b) $ ,is less than that of (6), $1-(1-\\delta)F(\\delta b-b)-c^{\\prime}(b)$ ,for all 8 and $b$ . Thus, by the second-order condition, $b^{*}>b^{e}$ .Q.E.D.  \n\nProof of Proposition 3. When $\\delta\\:=\\:1$ ,the first term in (6) becomes one, which is greater than $1-F(-b)$ , the value of the first term when & $=0$ Thus, $b^{*}(\\breve{1})>b^{*}(0)$  \n\nAn increase in 8 in (10) will reduce the left-hand side of (10). Since the second-order condition holds, the equilibrium $b^{e}$ will be reduced. Q.E.D.  \n\nProof of Proposition 4. Note that except for the cost function $c(b)$ none of the model's other exogenous variables directly appears in (11). Since $c^{\\prime\\prime}(b)>0$ the relationship between $b^{e}$ and the turnover rate is negative when any of the model's exogenous variables, except the cost function, changes.  \n\nWe now prove that when $c(b)$ changes, the same negative relationship holds. Since $c^{\\prime\\prime}(b)>0$ the derivative of the turnover rate with respect to $b$ in (11) is $-c^{\\prime\\prime}(b^{e})<0$ . Thus the relationship between the training level and the turnover rate is negative when the cost function does not change.  \n\nLet the cost function be indexed by $I,$ namely, $\\mathsf{c o s t}={\\mathfrak{c}}({\\boldsymbol{b}},{\\boldsymbol{I}})$ Assume that an increase in $I$ increases the marginal cost. That is, $c_{b I}(b,I)>0$ for all $b$ and $I.$ By differentiating (10) with respect to $I$ (we will drop the superscript $e$ on $b$ for simplicity), we have  \n\n$$\nf(\\updelta b-b)(1-\\updelta)b_{I}/2-c_{b b}b_{I}-c_{b I}=0.\n$$  \n\nThe second-order condition and $c_{b I}>0$ imply that $b_{I}<0$  \n\nLet $T$ denote the turnover rate. By differentiating (11) with respect to $I,$ wehave  \n\n$$\nT_{I}=-2[c_{b I}+c_{b b}b_{I}].\n$$  \n\nSubstituting in (A1), we have ${\\cal T}_{I}=-f(\\updelta b-b)(1-\\updelta)b_{I}>0.$ Thus, as $I$ increases, $b$ decreases, and the turnover rate increases. Q.E.D.  \n\nProof of Corollary. Since the proof of proposition 4 is valid for any value of 8, it is true when $\\updelta=1$ Q.E.D.  \n\n## References  \n\nBecker, Gary. “\"Investment in Human Capital: A Theoretical Analysis.\" Journal of Political Economy 70, Suppl.

They enjoy non-transferable benefits if they choose to stay within this system. The higher up are they in this labor market hierarchy (their political ranks), the fewer are their outside employment opportunities. Due to career and wealth concerns, they are cautious and risk-averse when managing firms. We examine the effect of managers' political ranks on firms’ stock price crash risk and find a negative association. This association mainly exists in firms with younger managers and managers with shorter tenure. Further, this effect is only significant in regions with weak market forces, in firms without foreign investors, without political connections, and during periods with no local government leaders' or managers' political promotions. We conclude that the political ranking system reduces the stock price crash risk.  \n\nKeywords: internal labor market, political ranks, stock price crash risk, China JEL Codes:G30; J33  \n\n# China's Closed Pyramidal Managerial Labor Market and the Stock Price Crash Risk  \n\n# 1. INTRODUCTION  \n\nA series of recent research suggests that the contract between shareholders and managers can significantly affect stock price crash risk (e.g., Bae, Lim and Wei, 2006; Benmelech, Kandel, and Veronesi, 2010; Kim, Li and Zhang, 2011a). We examine how managers' political incentives affect firms' crash risk. In particular, we demonstrate that the contract between the state and managers, as manifested in China's political personnel ranking system, can affect the crash risk.  \n\nWithin China's progressive political ranking system, managers of state-owned firms work in a relatively closed, though still competitive, internal labor market. They are de facto government officials with political ranks. Keeping their current ranks and getting promotions within this system mean power, status, reputation, pecuniary and non-pecuniary rewards and benefits, while a departure from this system can leave them with no comparably prestigious employment opportunities. This partially resembles Tullock's (1965) politicians in a bureaucratic system. He describes behaviors of politicians in government organizations while we examine behaviors of managers who are also politicians. Our setting is a mixture of a political bureaucratic system and a market for professional managers. Under this circumstance, managers of state-owned firms are motivated to excise caution - to achieve performance without making mistakes while keeping their bosses happy. This is especially true for managers with high political ranks in the labor market pyramid. Losses due to failures resulting from risky behaviors are huge. Further, these managers already possess a competitive advantage due to their high ranks and thus behave more cautiously (Bronars, 1986; Brown, Harlow and Starks, 1996; Chevalier and Ellison, 1997). Finally, as progressively fewer people are at the higher rungs of the pyramidal political ranking system, the higher is a manager's political rank, the more likely is it that he or she will be strictly monitored by the government. These factors cause managers with high political ranks to exercise caution when managing firms. Cautious and risk-averse managers are less likely to engage in high-risk projects and therefore they help reduce stock price crash risk.  \n\nRelying on Tullock (1965), we can potentially arrive at the same prediction. He argues that politicians seek promotions by pleasing the sovereign. As politicians' opportunity set is typically limited at high ranks, the more they lack outside employment opportunities, the more likely they are to be evaluated based on politics rather than objective performance criteria. High (low) ranking managers promotions are more determined by political (economic) performance. High ranking managers therefore are less likely than low ranking managers to be associated with crashes as they engage in fewer risky strategies to boost economic performance. Based on these arguments, we predict a negative association between managers political ranks and stock price crash risk.  \n\nUsing data of China's publicly listed firms during the period 2005-2012, we test the above prediction. We find that stock price crash risk is lower in state-owned firms where managers have higher political ranks. This negative association between political ranks and the crash risk exists mainly in firms with younger managers and those with shorter tenure. Finally, institutions play a role in affecting how political ranks reduce stock price crash risk. The negative association between political ranks and the crash risk is significant only in regions with weak market forces, in firms without foreign investors, without political connections, and during periods with no local government leaders' or managers political promotions.  \n\nWe make the following contributions. First, we expand the research on stock price crash risk using a setting when political mechanisms are embedded into corporate governance. This is not unique to China as contracts between managers and firms are influenced by political forces all over the world. Benmelech, Kandel and Veronesi (2010)  \n\nand Kim, Li and Zhang (2011a) show that the contract between shareholders and managers can influence the crash risk. We find that, in China's state-owned firms, the contract between the state and managers is another factor influencing firms' crash risk. Managers of China's state-owned firms have a double identity, leading to an overlap between political and market contracts in a closed pyramidal managerial labor market. This setting gives us an opportunity to examine a phenomenon that is of general interest Second, this study speaks to the roles played by China's tournament-style political ranking system as well as Tullock's (1965) politicians in a bureaucratic system. Our evidence suggests that both, with different mechanisms, can induce managers to behave with caution, thus reducing risk.  \n\nThird, while Qian and Weingast (1997) and Qian and Roland (1998) resort to federalism to explain China's rapid economic growth, they do not explore how federalism ensures the execution of central government's strategies and goals. Blanchard and Shleifer (2001) argue that China's political centralization induces local governments to favor economic growth. Li and Zhou (2005) offer empirical evidence at the regional level, not at the firm level. We conduct an analysis at the firm level and provide evidence associated with the mitigation of risk behind China's economic growth.  \n\nFinally, our findings are useful to international investors. As China's economy continues to grow, it is important that foreign investors and regulatory authorities understand China's unique governance of its state-owned firms. Further, many Chinese state-owned firms are also listed in foreign countries. A good understanding of their governance mechanism benefits international investors.  \n\nIt is important to note that results in this study do not necessarily point to the political ranking system being a governance-enhancing mechanism. While in the context of reducing crash risk, the political ranking system appears to play a positive role, this  \n\nsystem can potentially lead to preferential treatments by the government and auditors, which can drive the negative association between political ranks and the crash risk.  \n\nThe remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section I discusses China's institutional background, reviews the literature, and develops the hypothesis. Section II describes sample selection, model design, and descriptive statistics. Section IV discusses regression results. Section V summarizes and concludes.  \n\n# II. BACKGROUND, LITERATURE, AND HYPOTHESIS DEVELOPMENT  \n\n## Background for the Political Ranking System  \n\nChina's communist party controls and manages its personnel. Party representatives of state-owned firms can be members of the boards of directors and the committees of supervisors. Party representatives of the boards of directors, committees of supervisors, and managers can also enter the party committee. A way to carrying out personnel control is the political ranking system. Therefore, managers of China's state-owned firms receive dual nominations. When they receive offers from firms' boards of directors to be high level managers, they also receive nominations from the Personnel Organization Department of the Communist Party Commission to be government officials.  \n\nPolitical ranking is originally a product of the planned economy and reflects political positions in the state that firms' managers occupy (Li and Li, 1999, in Chinese). Due to economic, political and military considerations, state-owned firms were initially assigned political ranks to enable them to be embedded into the national political system. This kind of hierarchy is also a part of China's historical and cultural tradition that is deeply rooted in the society. It fits Granovetter's (1985) economic-sociological theory that economic activities are embedded in social relationships. Political goals are often carried out in the design and allocation of firm ranks. Managers who are assigned to run these firms naturally gain political ranks. Firm rank and manager rank are two sides of the  \n\nsame coin. One side is the rank of the assets under management while the other side is the rank of the manager.  \n\nWe cannot access the Party's internal documents to precisely ascertain each manager's political rank. We can only infer a manager's rank by examining the ranks of firms he or she has served or the rank of the firm he or she is serving or the ranks of the government agencies that he or she has served. It is not always the case that firm rank and manager rank are the same. Sometimes, a manager's rank is higher than a firm's rank.  \n\nWe want to elaborate two issues here. First, not any one can be assigned as a manager of a firm with a particular political rank. Normally, he or she needs to at least have occupied a position one rank below or the same rank before he or she can be assigned. Promotions are progressive and promotions beyond one rank are rare albeit not impossible. Second, it is tempting to know whether it is firm rank or manager rank that is playing a governance role. It is possible that both can play a role. However, as the product market is competitive, a firm cannot perpetually maintain its comparative advantage by just relying on its political rank. Over an extended period of time, if political ranks influence firm performance, it likely comes from managers rather than firms. Further, if we find that managers' ranks influence firm performance and that this influence varies with managers' traits such as age and tenure, then this influence should come from managers' ranks rather than from firms' ranks.  \n\nThrough this political ranking system, managers maintain a natural association with the state or the government. On the one hand, they are constrained and influenced by the multifaceted commands of the government (Bai and Xu, 2005; Bai, Lu and Tao, 2006). On the other hand, they may receive various favorable treatments from the government. Within the system, managers can realize migrations from firms to firms, from firms to the government, or from the government to firms. They can also be promoted to higher ranks within their current firms or in other firms through a tournament-style competition  \n\nwithin the closed pyramidal managerial labor market.  \n\n## Internal Labor Market, Tournament, and Risk Preference of Competitors  \n\nManagers of China's state-owned firms more or less work in a closed, hierarchical internal managerial labor market (Doeringer and Piore, 1971). Once they leave this labor market, voluntarily or involuntarily, it is hard for them to get comparably prestigious employment opportunities. An internal labor market often uses the tournament mechanism. In a tournament, many competitors compete for an award. The winner gets a very high prize while the losers get a low prize or nothing (Lazear and Rosen, 1981; Rosen, 1986). At different stages of a tournament, participants likely compete based on different criteria and with different goals. However, the ultimate goal is to stay in the game and obtain the chance of competing in the next round. When the cost of monitoring is high, tournaments are cost-effective (Lazear and Rosen, 1981). The Chinese government controls a vast number of state-owned firms and faces a high cost of monitoring.  \n\nThe tournament mechanism affects participants risk preference. The front runner prefers a low risk strategy to maintain its current advantage while the trailing opponent chooses a high risk strategy to increase its chance of winning (Bronars, 1986). Therefore, participants entering a higher level of competition in a tournament, such as managers of higher political ranks in China's state-owned firms, will demonstrate a higher level of risk-aversion as their winner's status is already largely recognized.  \n\n## Hypothesis Development  \n\n## State's Goals in the Political Ranking System  \n\nThe political ranking system has played an important role in transforming China to a Chinese-style market-oriented economy. It is a mixture of a political bureaucratic system and a market for professional managers. This system enables government officials to gain practical experience in running businesses and helps them better understand the operations of the economy. This is important to China as its government makes economic development its priority. Mobility within the system also enables managers of state-owned firms to bid for becoming government officials based on their managerial experience and performance. This enhances the competition mechanism. To a certain extent, state-owned firms play the role of \"the incubator for business-savvy officials\" where the government observes and cultivates managers and officials.  \n\nThe political ranking system helps the government reduce the monitoring cost. Due to the importance of state-owned firms to the nation, managers are under tight scrutiny. Under the principle of “Party Controls and Manages Its Cadres,\" these firms must be run by politically loyal and competent managers. A mechanism of political ranks and promotions can help the government maintain and improve monitoring eficiency, reduce the information acquisition and processing cost, and gain a good understanding of managers' capability and business experience.  \n\nIt is tempting to argue that the political ranking system fills the governance void in China. Political goals can bring about political burdens as well as political benefits (Lin, Cai, and Li, 1998) and whether external investors gain or lose is uncertain. The political ranking system can potentially introduce bad incentives and bring unfair privileges to high ranking managers, leading to selective enforcement, rent seeking and corruption.  \n\n## IncentivesProvided to Managers within thePolitical Ranking System  \n\nPolitical ranks often mean benefits to high-level managers of state-owned firms. Benefits associated with political ranks are substantial, including pecuniary benefits such as the right to control resources and a legitimate increase in income and related benefits. They also include non-pecuniary benefits such as possibilities for promotions (Rosen, 1986), spiritual encouragement, and an enhancement in reputation (Baker,  \n\nJensen and Murphy, 1988). As for legitimate income and benefits, the effect of political ranks is reflected not only horizontally but also longitudinally. Horizontally, a high political rank means a wide range and a large amount of benefits. Longitudinally, benefits accompanying managers of state-owned firms can not only be enjoyed during managers' tenure but also be extended to periods after their retirement.  \n\nIn absolute terms, benefits provided to managers of state-owned firms, including implicit and explicit forms, are not necessarily lower than explicit benefits provided to managers of non-state-owned firms. Reducing the implicit form of benefits potentially resembles savings to firms but it may not be feasible as the savings can easily dissipate due to other ensuing costs, for example, the cost of measuring performance, the cost of executing and modifying contracts, etc. In addition, there is some further “wisdom\" in introducing the political ranking mechanism. This mechanism successfully separates implicit benefits from explicit benefits, leaving the observable part, explicit benefits, relatively small. This serves the government's political purpose of maintaining a level of seeming equality in the society.  \n\n## Preference for thePolitical Ranking System  \n\nNormally, a manager advances progressively in the political ranking system. Only by winning the current round can he or she become eligible to enter the competition in the next round. Therefore, gaining the current rank provides an option value for competing for the next rank (Rosen, 1986). Further, high ranks can bring enhanced reputation to managers (Baker, Jensen and Murphy, 1988). China's philosophy and tradition of \"officialdom\" fostered over two thousand years of feudalism and Confucianism further reinforce the attractiveness of political ranks to managers and the people's acceptance of this system.  \n\nSimilar to government officials, managers of state-owned firms compete in a relatively closed internal labor market (Zhou, 2004). This enhances the importance of promotions to managers. It is difficult for them to find comparably prestigious employment opportunities outside the party organization. They are unlikely to voluntarily quit their current positions given a large chasm between lives within and outside the government. This creates a lock-in effect.1 Managers of state-owned firms often spend their entire career in this system. This reduces their chance for short-termism and motivates them to pay attention to long-term prospects. There is another factor that fortifies the lock-in effect, information asymmetry - the difficulty for the external labor market to observe, assess and price the implicit benefits that managers of state-owned firms receive.2 This further limits managers? ability to find alternative outside employment opportunities. Moreover, compared with non-state-owned firms, state-owned firms exist in a system of multiple objectives. Managerial talent associated with state-owned firms is different from the talent of value maximization of non-state-owned firms. Of course, non-state-owned firms can also share a host of issues faced by state-owned firms, but to a lesser extent. This specificity in managerial talent plays a role in locking-in managers within stated-owned firms and reducing their mobility to the external labor market. Preserving current positions and working towards promotions within the state sector is a more viable solution.  \n\nThis causes managers of state-owned firms to be risk-averse. To managers with high political ranks, on the one hand, losses associated with failures resulting from risky behaviors are huge. On the other hand, they already possess a competitive advantage and thus behave more cautiously (Bronars, 1986; Brown, Harlow and Starks, 1996; Chevalier and Ellison, 1997). Therefore, high ranking managers are less likely to take excessive risk  \n\nand thus help reduce stock price crash risk.  \n\nThere is another, if not unrelated, way that high ranking managers can reduce risk. Tullock (1965) argues that bureaucrats, as politicians, seek promotions. The only way to obtain promotions is to act in a manner that is rewarded by the sovereign. Pleasing the sovereign is the most important task. Politicians' opportunity set is typically limited especially among the higher ranks. The more they lack outside employment opportunities, the more they will be evaluated based on politics rather than economic performance. High ranking managers thus are less likely than low ranking managers to cause crashes as they lack incentives to engage in risky strategies to boost economic performance.  \n\nBased on the above arguments, we propose the following hypothesis:  \n\nHypothesis:  State-owned firms' stock price crash risk is negatively associated with their managers' political ranks.  \n\nWe need to note potential tensions in this hypothesis. It is not necessarily the case that high ranking managers are more cautious or transparent. As their promotions are likely to be more of a political rather than an economic decision, they will be more responsive to political incentives to suppress bad news. That is, they do not want to report bad news to embarrass their bosses and risk their political capital. Piotroski, Wong, and Zhang (2015) find that there is more suppression around promotions of politicians that are tied to political factions. From a theoretical point of view, in the long run, the greater the ability to suppress bad news, the higher the crash risk (Jin and Myers 2006). Further, Tullock (1965) argues that low ranking politicians are more likely to be under multiple sovereigns. As the multiple sovereigns will normally compete among themselves and need to rely on the support of low ranking personnel in this competition, low ranking politicians have some discretion in choosing among the sovereigns. Therefore, low ranking politicians can end up relying less on economic performance for promotions, reducing the crash risk.  \n\nHowever, even though we acknowledge the single-multiple sovereign difference between high and low ranking politicians, this difference is limited in China's  \n\nstate-owned firms. After all, the Chinese personnel system is vertical with all units under unified leadership. This system resembles a single sovereign situation in which a politician confronted with choices must take two variables into account, the deviation between what he or she wants and what the sovereign will reward, and the probability that the sovereign will reward his or her action (Tullock, 1965). Rent seeking and suppressing bad news are associated with cost.  \n\nFinally, from an empirical point of view, if managers can reduce firm risk with rent seeking and suppressing bad news, then older managers or managers with longer tenure will enhance the negative association between political ranks and crash risk as they are more capable at rent-seeking and have fewer financial constraints. However, if it is political ranks that influence managers? behaviors through incentives mentioned earlier, then younger managers or managers with shorter tenure would enhance the negative association between political ranks and crash risk as they have greater room for promotions. Here, we hasten to admit the limitation in this argument. Even though the political ranking system has the potential of reducing the crash risk, we are hesitant to call it a good governance mechanism. Incentives associated with politicians and privileges given to high ranking managers (officials) can potentially lead to selective enforcement, rent seeking and corruption.  \n\n# III. VARIABLE DEFINITIONS AND EMPIRICAL DESIGN  \n\n## Defining Political Ranks  \n\nWe hand collect political ranks of managers from firms' annual reports. Starting from 2004, firms in China are required to report their control charts, where information on firms' highest control entities and the layers of management between the highest control entities and the firms is disclosed. China's listed firms also disclose the occupational history of managers. Using these two sources, we identify political ranks of firms and  \n\ntheir managers (chairmen of the boards), using a procedure similar to Liang, Li, Chen and Chen (2015). Obtaining a manager's political rank involves two steps. First, we determine a firm's political rank (Cohi). We obtain information on a firm's controlling entity. It is either the central, provincial, city and county-level State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission or a university. Then, based on the control chart between the listed firm and its control entity, we determine a listed firm's political rank. If there are multiple control chains, we use the chain with the highest level of share ownership. Second, we determine a manager's political rank (Dshi. Relying on annual reports and manually collected managers' occupational history, we obtain a manager's current or past highest political rank in firms, groups or the government. A manager's political rank is the higher of his or her highest current or past political rank or the rank of the firm that he or she manages. We then divide political rank of a manager (or a firm) into four categories: township and section level (Dshi or $\\mathit{C o h i}=1$ , county and division level (Dshi or $C o h i=2$ ), department and bureau level (Dshi or $C o h i=3,$ and provincial and ministerial level (Dshi or $C o h i=4,$  \n\n## Defining Stock Price Crash Risk  \n\nWe measure stock price crash risk following Chen, Hong and Stein (2001), Hutton, Marcus and Tehranian (2009) and Kim, Li and Zhang (2011a, 2011b). This requires first estimating firm-specific weekly return for each firm, $W_{;}$ which is the logarithm of 1 plus theresidual, $W_{j t}=\\ln(1+\\varepsilon_{j t})$ , from estimating the following regression:  \n\n$\\begin{array}{r}{{\\bf\\Delta}_{T;t}=a_{j}+b_{1j}r_{m t;2}+b_{2j}r_{m t-1}+b_{3j}r_{m t}+b_{4j}r_{m t+1}+b_{5j}r_{m t+2}+\\varepsilon_{j t},}\\end{array}$ where $r_{j t}$ is Stock js return during Week $\\displaystyle t,$ Imt2, Imt1, Imt, Imt+1 and rmt+2 are market returns during Weeks $t-2,t-1,t,t+1$ and $t+2$ , respectively.  \n\nNext, we define stock price crash risk in two ways. The first measure is an indicator variable, Crash. We consider the distribution of firm-specific weekly return W.3 If there is at least a week in a fiscal year where the return is 2.58 standard deviations below the mean of weekly returns, the stock is assumed to have experienced a crash in a particular sample year and we set Crash to 1. Otherwise, we set Crash to 0.  \n\nThe second measure is a continuous measure, Ncskew, that captures the negative conditional skewness of firm-specific returns. More specifically, Ncskew is computed using the formula below:  \n\n$\\begin{array}{r}{N c s k e w_{j t}{=}-[\\mathrm{n}(\\mathrm{n}-\\mathrm{1})^{3/2}\\sum W^{3}{{j}}t]/[(\\mathrm{n}-\\mathrm{1})(\\mathrm{n}-\\mathrm{2})(\\sum W^{2}{{j}}t)^{3/2}],}\\end{array}$ where Wis firm-specific return estimated using Equation (1) and $_n$ is the number of weeks used to compute Ncskew.  \n\n## Model Specification  \n\nSimilar to Chen, Hong and Stein (2001) and Kim, Li and Zhang (2011a, 2011b), we estimate the following regressions:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{C r a s h_{t}=a_{0}+\\alpha_{1}D s h i_{t-1}+a_{2}D t u r n_{t-1}+a_{3}N c s k e W_{t-1}+a_{4}S i g m a_{t-1}+a_{5}W r e t_{t-1}}\\ &{\\qquad+\\alpha_{6}S i z e_{t-1}+\\alpha_{7}M B_{t-1}+a_{8}L e V_{t-1}+\\alpha_{9}R o a_{t-1}+a_{10}A c c m_{t-1}+\\varepsilon_{t},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{N c s k e w_{t}=a_{0}+a_{1}D s h i_{t-1}+a_{2}D t u r n_{t-1}+a_{3}N c s k e w_{t-1}+a_{4}S i g m a_{t-1}+a_{5}W r e t_{t-1}}\\ {+a_{6}S i z e_{t-1}+a_{7}M B_{t-1}+a_{8}L e V_{t-1}+a_{9}R o a_{t-1}+a_{10}A c c m_{t-1}+\\varepsilon_{t},\\qquad}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere, for Firm i, Crasht is an indicator variable for crash risk in Year $t$ and Ncskewt is a continuous variable for crash risk in Year t. Dshit-1 is the political rank for a firm's chairman in Year t-1. Dturnt-1 is the de-trended share turnover in Year $t^{1}$ . NcskeWt-1 is negative firm-specific weekly return skewness in Year $t{\\cdot}1$ . Sigmat-1 is the firm-specific weekly return volatility in Year $t^{1}$ . Wrett-1 is the average firm-specific weekly return in Year $t^{\\mathrm{{-1}}}$ . Sizet-1 is the logarithmic transformation of a firm's total assets at the end of Year t-1. MBt-1 is the market-to-book ratio of a firm at the end of Year $t$ -1. Levt-1 is a firm's ratio of total liabilities to total assets at the end of Year $t$ -1. Roat-1 is a firm's ratio of net income to total assets at the end of Year $t$ -1. Accmt-1 is the past three-year moving sum of absolute abnormal accruals ending in Year $t1$ , which equals the sum of absolute abnormal accruals in Years $t\\cdot1,t\\cdot2$ ,and $t{\\cdot}3.^{4}$ Our hypothesis suggests that the coefficient on Dshit-1 should be negative $\\left(\\alpha_{1}<0\\right)$ . We include year and industry indicators to control for year and industry fixed effects.  \n\n# IV. EMPIRICAL RESULTS  \n\n## Sample Selection  \n\nOur sample period covers eight years from 2005 to 2012. As our study requires information during the current and the previous years, we also include year 2004. Data for political ranks of managers from state-owned firms are manually collected from China's A-share market that includes both the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges. Other data items are from publicly available databases. Corporate governance data are from CCER (China Center of Economic Research) and financial and accounting data are from CSMAR (China Stock Market and Accounting Research). We start with an initial sample of 6,504 firm-year observations for state-owned firms. We exclude 135 firms with a public listing history of less than two years and 45 financial firms. We also exclude 734 observations with missing variable values. We are left with 5,590 firm-year observations. For comparison purposes, we obtain 2,835 firm-year observations for non-state-owned firms. Panels A and B, Table 1 provide detailed breakdown of our sample by year for stated-owned and non-stated-owned firms.  \n\n## Descriptive Statistics  \n\nTable 2 reports descriptive statistics and correlation coefficients. Panel A shows that the average value of the probability of a stock price crash Crasht is 0.2195, suggesting that $21.95\\%$ of our sample firms have experienced at least one crash week per year. The average value of firm-specific return skewness, Ncskewt, is -0.3551 (median is -0.3350). The average of political rank, Dshit-1, is 2.3608, with the $25^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile at 2 and the $75^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile at 3, suggesting that there are many county and division level managers $(D s h i_{t^{-1}}=2)$  \n\nPanel B reports descriptive statistics of Crasht and Ncskewt with each category of political rank, Dshit-1. It shows that Crasht decreases monotonously when Dshit-1 increases from the lowest level to the highest level (0.2434, for $D s h i_{t-1}=0;0.2399$ ,for $D s h i_{t^{-1}}=1;0.2202$ ,for $D s h i_{t-1}=2$ ;0.2147, forDshit- $_1=3$ ; 0.1853, for $D s h i_{t-1}=4$ ), providing preliminary support for our hypothesis that political ranks are negatively associated with stock price crash risk. A similar pattern for Ncskewt is not obvious.  \n\nPanel C reports correlation coefficients among major variables. We find that Crasht and Ncskewt are highly correlated (0.5243, Pearson; 0.5270, Spearman). The correlation between managers' political rank Dshit-1 and the indicator for a crash Crasht is significantly negative (-0.0259, Pearson; -0.0244, Spearman), in line with the prediction of our hypothesis. The correlation between Ncskewt and Dshit-1 is insignificant.  \n\n## Association between Political Ranks and Stock Price Crash Risk MainAssociation  \n\nTo test our hypothesis, we estimate Equations (3) and (4), using logit and OLS regressions, respectively. Results are reported in Table 3. All reported z or t-values are on an adjusted basis using robust standard errors corrected for firm-level clustering (Petersen 2009) and heteroskedasticity (White 1980). The coefficient on Dshi-1 is negative and significant (-0.1195, $z=\\cdot2.65$ ) when we use Crasht as the dependent variable. The coefficient on Dshit-1 is negative and significant (-0.0262, $t=-2.19$ when we use Ncskewt as the dependent variable.5 These results support our hypothesis that managers' political ranks are negatively associated with firms' stock price crash risk.6 Further, the coefficients on Sigmat-1 and $M B_{t-1}$ are positive, consistent with Kim, Li and Zhang (2011b). Chen, Hong and Stein (2001) and Kim, Li and Zhang (2011b) find that the effect of Ncskewt-1 on crash risk is positive. However, coefficients on Nsckewt-1 are insignificant.7 8  \n\n### Managers'Age  \n\nThe effect of managers' age on the association between political ranks and stock price crash risk can come from two sources. First, when a manager ages, his or her chance of getting a further promotion declines (Li and Zhou, 2005). Further, even if he or she gets a promotion, the benefits associated with the promotion decline as his or her time horizon is short (close to retirement due to old age). This reduces the attractiveness of a promotion to the manager. In this situation, old managers are more motivated by opportunism, more likely to conceal bad news or obfuscate financial reporting. They are less likely to be held responsible for their former opportunistic behaviors if they manage to exit the system through normal retirement.  \n\nYoung managers, on the other hand, are more attracted to higher political ranks through promotions than old managers. Therefore, they are more cautious and risk-averse. Further, when a manager is young, he or she has a long future career. Due t reputation and career concerns, his or her tendency for short-termism is lower. In sum, the motivating role of political ranks is more applicable to young managers, given the same rank. This is a horizon problem argument consistent Kalyta (2009) that managers manage earnings upwards during final pre-retirement years when pension depends on firm performance.  \n\nTable 4 presents results of the impact of managers' age $A g e_{t-1}$ on the association between political ranks and stock price crash risk. We choose a cutoff of 51 years as it is the sample median. When the age of a manager in its logarithm form LogAget1 is included in the model alone, its effect is insignificant. Next, we partition our sample based on managers' age. When managers are old $(A g e_{t^{-1}}>51)$ , the coefficients on Dshit-1 are insignificant, irrespective of whether our dependent variable is Crasht or Ncskewt. When managers are young $\\left(A g e_{t^{-1}}\\leq51\\right)$ , the coefficients on $D s h i_{t}.1$ are negative and significant (-0.1720, $z=\\cdot2.55$ for Crasht: $-0.0329$ ， $t=\\tau{}_{1.}93$ for Ncskewt). Therefore, the association between political ranks and crash risk appears to concentrate in firms with relatively young managers. However, differences in the magnitudes of the coefficients between subsamples are insignificant.  \n\n### Managers' Tenure  \n\nSimilar to age, managers' tenure can also influence their attitude towards risk. At the initial stage of their career, managers are more likely to be cautious due to career concerns. As they progress in tenure within firms, the chance of future promotions declines (Li and Zhou, 2005) and thus they become less risk-averse. This is again consistent with Kalyta's (2009) horizon problem argument concerning pre-retirement earnings management. We therefore investigate whether and how managers' tenure influences the effect of political ranks on stock price crash risk.  \n\nTable 5 provides results of how managers' tenure Tenuret1 influences the way that political ranks affect stock price crash risk. We choose a cutoff of 2 years as it is the sample median. When the tenure of a manager in its logarithm form LogTenuret1 is included in the model alone, its effect is insignificant. Next, we partition our sample based on managers' tenure. The coeficients on Dshit-1 are negative and significant (-0.1316, $z=\\cdot2.40$ using Crasht -0.0277, $t=\\cdot1.95$ using Ncskewt) for firms with managers at an early stage of tenure $\\left(T e n u r e_{t-1}\\leq2\\right)$ 0. They are insignificant for firms with managers at a late stage of tenure $\\langle T e n u r e_{t-1}>2\\rangle$ . Therefore, the association between political ranks and crash risk appears to concentrate in firms with managers at an early stage of tenure. However, differences in the magnitudes of the coefficients between subsamples are insignificant.  \n\n## Institutions and Political Ranks  \n\n## Market Forces  \n\nAs China's internal managerial labor market is not entirely market-driven, we expect the association between political ranks and the crash risk to be more pronounced in regions where market forces do not play a significant role or in industries with less competition.  \n\nWe first consider regional labor mobility. Managers have better mobility in their employment with more external hiring opportunities (Cremers and Grinstein, 2014; Gao, Luo and Tang, 2015). We use the mobility index of Fan, Wang and Zhu (2011) [National Economic Research Institute, China Reform Foundation] Mobility Index. It is approximated by the ratio of external labor force from the countryside to the total local labor force of a city. The greater is the value of Mobility Index, the more mobile is the local labor force and the less closed is the labor market. We partition our sample by the median (5.91) of Mobility Index. Panel A-1, Table 6 presents results on how labor force mobility influences the way that political ranks affect the stock price crash risk (all controls are  \n\nincluded in the regressions but not tabulated). We find that the coefficients on Dshi-1 are negative and significant (-0.1775, $z=\\cdot2.84$ using Crasht -0.0411, $t=\\tau{\\mathrm{2.44}}$ using Ncskewt only when Mobility Indext-1 $\\leq5.91$ . This finding suggests that the effect of political ranks on reducing stock price crash risk concentrates mainly in regions with low labor force mobility. However, differences in the magnitudes of the coefficients between subsamples are insignificant.  \n\nWe next consider the role of product market competition or industry concentration which is related to mobility. In a more competitive industry, it is easier for executives to move among firms and thus have a high level of mobility (Gao, Luo and Tang, 2015). We expect the role of political ranks to be more pronounced for firms in more concentrated industries or those with lower product market competition. Following Dhaliwal, Li, Tsang and Yang (2011), we define Herindex, which is the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, as the sum of squared fractions of sales of the top $10\\%$ largest firms in an industry per year. A low value of Herindex signifies a high level of product market competition in an industry. Panel A-2, Table 6 presents results on how product market competition influences the way that political ranks affect the stock price crash risk. We choose a cutoff of 0.0439 as it is the sample median of Herindex. The coefficients on Dshit-1 are negative and significant (-0.1594, $z=\\cdot2.50$ using Crasht; -0.0427, $t=\\cdot2.35$ using Ncskewt) only in industries with Herindext $_{\\cdot1}\\geq0.0439$ . Therefore, the role of political ranks in reducing stock price crash risk works only in industries with low product market competition or high industry concentration. However, differences in the magnitudes of the coefficients between subsamples are insignificant.  \n\n### Foreign Investors  \n\nAs the political ranking system is not an entirely market-oriented system, the presence of foreign investors, especially those from market economies with better developed institutions, can potentially mitigate the association between political ranks and the crash risk. Better developed institutions can potentially negate the effect of a closed pyramidal internal managerial labor market, making managerial talent more fluid between the government and the private sectors. We expect the effect of political ranks to attenuate for firms with a portion of their equity shares held by foreign investors.  \n\nForeign investors can invest in China's domestic B-share market. H-shares are shares of mainland firms listed in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (QFIIs) can also invest in China's domestic stock market. We examine the impact of the presence of B-shares, H-shares and QFIIs on the association between political ranks and crash risk. $A B_{t-1}$ is an indicator that equals 1 for a firm with B-shares and O otherwise. $A H_{t-1}$ is an indicator that equals 1 for a firm with H-shares and O otherwise. $\\scriptstyle Q F I I_{t-1}$ is an indicator that equals 1 for a firm with QFIls and O otherwise.  \n\nPanel B-1, Table 6 presents results on how AB/AHI QFIIinfluences the way that political ranks affect stock price crash risk (all controls are included in the regressions but not tabulated to save space). The coefficients on Dshit-1 are negative and significant (-0.1601, $z=\\cdot3.16$ using Crasht -0.0274, $t=\\cdot2.05$ using Ncskewt) only when $A B=A H=$ $Q F I I=0$ . Panel B-2, Table 6 presents results on how AB/AHinfluences the way that political ranks affect stock price crash risk. The coefficients on $D s h i_{t-1}$ are negative and significant (-0.1300, $z=\\cdot2.71$ using Crasht; -0.0261, $t=\\tau{2.08}$ using Ncskewt) only when $A B=A H=0$ . Panel B-3, Table 6 presents results on how QFIlinfluences the way that political ranks affect stock price crash risk. The coefficients on Dshit-1 are negative and significant (-0.1440, $z=\\cdot3.04$ using Crasht -0.0240, $t=\\cdot1.89$ using Ncskewt) only when $Q F I I=0$ . Differences in the magnitudes of the coefficients between firms with and without foreign investors are insignificant. In sum, political ranks play a significant role in reducing firm-level crash risk only for firms without B-shares, H-shares or QFIIs, that is, without foreign investors.  \n\n### Political Connections  \n\nPolitical connections can serve as a safety net that mitigates managers' incentive to be cautious when their ranks are high. We therefore consider the effect of political connections on the association between political ranks and stock price crash risk. Following Fan, Wong and Zhang (2007), we define $P C_{t-1}$ as an indicator that equals 1 for a firm with political connections and 0 otherwise. Panel C, Table 6 presents results on how political connections influence the way that political ranks affect the crash risk (all controls are included in the regressions but not tabulated to save space). The coefficients on Dshit-1 are negative and significant (-0.1121, $z=\\cdot2.31$ using Crasht; -0.0266, $t=\\tau{\\mathrm{2.09}}$ using Ncskewt) only when $P C_{t-1}=0$ (no political connections). Differences in the magnitudes of the coefficients between firms with and without political connections are insignificant.  \n\nWe cautiously interpret the above results in the following way. For a firm with political connections that can potentially bring added protection, its manager has a lower incentive to behave cautiously. Therefore, in this narrow context of the association between political ranks and the crash risk, political ranks and political connections act as substitutes for each other. This can potentially point to the limitation of political ranking as a governance mechanism. A reduced sample size for the subsample with political connections can also lead to an insignificant result. To conclude more definitively, a thorough analysis of the interplay between political ranks and political connections is warranted and we leave this to future studies.  \n\n### Effect of Promotions on the Association between Political Ranks and Crash Risk  \n\nOur analysis thus far provides some evidence that the political ranking system plays a positive role of reducing crash risk. However, under certain self-serving incentives, it can also potentially play a negative role. Piotroski, Wong and Zhang (2015) provide evidence that provincial officials have an incentive to suppress negative news right before their promotions. Specifically, they find that local politicians facing the prospect of a promotion temporarily restrict the flow of negative information about their affiliated firms. While we examine a group of people (chairmen of boards who directly control listed state-owned firms) different from those in Piotroski, Wong and Zhang (2015), they may have similar incentives when they sense that opportunities for promotions are coming. We therefore expect fewer stock price crashes for firms during their local provincial officials' promotion window as well as their chairmen's own promotion window than during other periods.  \n\nWe first use Piotroski, Wong and Zhang's (2015) promotion measure that captures the turnover of a provincial party secretary or provincial governor. A turnover is defined as a promotion when he or she moves to a more senior position, including: 1) a promotion within the same province (e.g., promotion from a governor to a party secretary); 2) a promotion to another province (e.g., a governor or a party secretary position of a larger province); and 3) a promotion to a minister level position of the central government. Firms operating in the same regions as the promoted politicians are likely to be affected by the politicians′ promotions. The promotion period includes the year before and year of the promotion. Specifically, we define an indicator variable Promotion that equals 1 if the leader of the province where a firm is located receives a promotion, and O otherwise. We next define firm chairmen's promotions. If a chairman received a promotion, the indicator variable Promotion equals 1. Otherwise, Promotion equals 0.  \n\nPanel D, Table 6 presents results on how promotions influence the way that political ranks affect stock price crash risk (all controls are included in the regressions but not tabulated to save space). Panel D-1 shows the effect of provincial politicians' promotions. The coefficients on Dshit1 are negative and significant (-0.1358, $z=\\cdot2.40$ using Crasht -0.0270, $t=\\cdot1.76$ using Ncskewt) only when Promotiont $\\mathrm{\\Omega}_{:}=0$ andPromotion $_{t+I}=0$  \n\nDifferences in the magnitudes of the coefficients between promotion and non-promotion periods are insignificant. This suggests that the role of political ranks works only during periods with no local government leaders' political promotions. This result, to a certain extent, complements Piotroski, Wong and Zhang (2015) that provincial officials have the incentive to suppress negative news right before their promotions. However, our comparison periods are different from theirs. They compare periods before and after promotions. We compare promotion periods with non-promotion periods. Further, the purpose of our analysis is to show a dip in the association between political ranks and crash risk during the promotion period, not directly a decline in crash risk.  \n\nPanel D-2 shows the effect of chairmen's own promotions. Similar to those of provincial politicians' promotions, the coefficients on Dshit-1 are negative and significant (-0.1180, z $=-2.57$ using Crasht; -0.0249, $t=\\cdot2.05$ using Ncskewt) only when Promotion $_t=0$ and $P r o m o t i o n\\L_{t+1}=0\\L_{}$ . Differences in the magnitudes of the coefficients between promotion and non-promotion periods are insignificant.  \n\nWe conclude that, promotions, either local provincial politicians or firm chairmen's, serve to dampen the effect of political ranks on crash risk. A central theme here is that while political ranks play a positive role in reducing crash risk in China's confined managerial labor market, this positive role can dissipate with distorted incentives.  \n\nTo summarize the above four analyses, we believe in the pattern that the link between crash risk and political ranks diminishes with more advanced institutions, for example, more developed market forces, including higher labor mobility and the presence of foreign investors.9 China's closed pyramidal managerial labor market differs from the Western system. While we are not arguing which one is superior to the other, amid China's economic transformation, the political ranking system is one that possibly fits her current stage of development. We see the political ranking system as potentially a substitute for the Western system that relies on more advanced institutions. However, even when political ranks can play a positive role of reducing the crash risk, it is not always effective. With political connections or promotions of local leaders or managers, the positive role of political ranks diminishes.  \n\n## Alternative Mechanisms  \n\n### Rent Seeking  \n\nAs discussed in our hypothesis development, it is possible that the higher is a manager's political rank, the more capable is he or she of resource allocation, for example, better rent seeking ability, fewer financial constraints, better government ties, and more propping from others. These can potentially reduce a firm's risk. If this is the case, one may expect that older managers or managers with longer tenure will strengthen the negative association between political ranks and stock price crash risk.  \n\nAs finance is a scarce commodity in China, we consider the impact of a manager's political rank on a firm's loan balance and financing cost. If a high political rank enables a firm to receive more favorable financing treatment, we expect to observe a higher loan balance and a lower financing cost. We also consider corporate income taxes. If a higher political rank enables firms to receive more favorable tax treatment, we expect firms with higher-rank managers to pay lower taxes. Further, we examine seasoned equity offerings. If a higher political rank enables firms to receive more favorable treatment, we expect firms with higher-rank managers to have a better access to seasoned equity offerings. Finally, we consider propping from others. If there are some real benefits associated with high ranks, we would expect political ranks to increase propping.  \n\nTo test above conjectures, we define the following variables. Loan_assettis a firm's ratio of bank loans to total assets at the end of Year t. Fin_loant is a firm's ratio of  \n\nfinancial fees to bank loans at the end of Year t. Tax_tointis a firm's ratio of income tax to income at the end of Year t. SEO_indicatort is an indicator variable that equals 1 if a firm conducts a seasoned equity offering (SEO) and O otherwise during Year t. SEO_assetis a firm's ratio of SEO amount to total assets at the end of Year t. Sub_assettis a firm's ratio of subsidies received to total assets at the end of Year t. Prop_asset is other payables to total assets at the end of Year $t.$ These variables replace Crash in Equation (3).  \n\nIn all seven regressions (results not tabulated to conserve space), the coefficients on Dshi are insignificant, suggesting that political ranks do not directly bring real benefits to firms. Next, we perform alternative mechanism tests in age and tenure partitions. The coefficients on Dshi are insignificant in all regressions, except in the Tenure $>2$ partition when financing fees (Fin_loan) and tax (Tax_toin) are the dependent variables. In these two occasions, the coefficients on Dshi are negative. The negative effect would suggest that firms with longer-tenure managers tend to pay a lower financing cost and a lower tax associated with political ranks. To summarize, while there is some evidence that political ranks influence rent seeking and resources allocation, it is surprisingly weak.  \n\n### Punishment Due to Securities Law Violations and Audit Opinions  \n\nWe now turn to the effect of political ranks on punishment due to securities law violations and audit opinions. We obtain data on punishment due to securities law violations from CSMAR. These are violations punished by the China Securities Regulatory Commission. We define an indicator, Violation, that equals 1 if a firm is punished for violating securities laws, and O otherwise. There are fourteen different types of securities law violations: (1) illegal share buyback; (2) inflated profit; (3) assets fabrication; (4) unauthorized fund use change; (5) postponement/delay in disclosure; (6) false statement; (7) fund provision violation; (8) major failure to disclose information; (9) major shareholder embezzlement; (10) stock price manipulation; (11) fraudulent IPO; (12)  \n\nillegal guarantee; (13) illegal speculation; (14) Others. We also define an indicator Infor Violation that equals 1 if a firm is punished for violating disclosure rules, and 0 otherwise. Three types of violations are viewed as information disclosure violations: (5) postponement/delay in disclosure; (6) false statement; and (8) major failure to disclose information. To test our prediction, we estimate the following regression:  \n\n$V o l a t i o n t=a_{0}+a_{1}D s h i_{t-1}+\\alpha\\textsubscript{2}S i z e_{t-1}+\\alpha\\textsubscript{2}M B_{t-1}+\\alpha_{4}L e V_{t-1}+\\alpha_{5}R o a_{t-1}+\\alpha_{6}A c c m_{t-1}+\\varepsilon_{t},$ where all variables are as defined earlier.  \n\nResults for Equation (5) are not tabulated to conserve space. The coefficient on Dshit-1 is negative and significant (-0.3406, $z=\\cdot2.67,$ for Violationt. The coefficient on Dshit-1 is negative and significant (-0.2853, $_{Z}=\\cdot1.96)$ for Infor Violationt. These results suggest that firms with highly ranked managers are less likely to be punished for violating securities laws or related disclosure regulations than other firms.  \n\nWe next examine the impact of political ranks on audit opinions. In Equation (5), we replace Violationt with an indicator Auditopt that equals 1 for a non-clean audit opinion and 0 otherwise. The coefficient on Dshit1 is negative and significant (-0.3846, $z=\\cdot2.18)$ suggesting that firms with highly ranked managers are less likely to receive non-clean audit opinions.  \n\nIn sum, these results provide some evidence that firms with highly ranked managers enjoy some preferential treatments from government authorities or auditors. Such preferential treatments can potentially drive the negative association between political ranks and the crash risk. Or, high ranking managers receive more government support or better understand authorities' cues to stem the flow of bad news that can embarrass the government (Piotroski, Wong and Zhang, 2015).  \n\n## Dealing with Endogeneity  \n\n### InstrumentalVariableAnalysis  \n\nTo alleviate the endogeneity concern, we adopt an instrumental variable approach using per capita living space (Space), the number of buses per 1000 residents $(B u s)$ running water usage per capita ( Water) and gas usage per capita $(G a s)$ of the province where a firm is headquartered in 1998, as instruments. These variables reflect population density (Space) and investment in public facilities that are unlikely to be directly associated with a firm's stock price crash risk. However, they are associated with managers' political ranks. More densely populated regions are strategically more important to China and they usually attract and host more important firms, and thus a higher chance of having highly ranked firms and managers. These firms also find it easier to get the required human resources in more populated regions. However, per capita living space is usually low in these regions. Therefore, we expected political ranks to be negatively associated with per capita living space (Space). Investments in infrastructure and public facilities reflect the importance of these regions to state-owned firms. Highly ranked firms (and managers) are thus more likely to capture and utilize these investment inputs, especially the initial distributions of these investments. Further, a region with more highly ranked firms (and thus managers) suggests its strategic importance which will attract more infrastructure and public facility investments. Therefore, we expect investments in these areas to be associated with managers political ranks. It is relatively straightforward to expect bus coverage per 1000 residents (Bus) and per capita gas $(G a s)$ and running water usage ( Water to be positively associated with political ranks.  \n\nWe use the following first stage equation to determine a chairman's rank:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{D s h i_{t-1}=a_{0}+a_{1}S p a c e+a_{2}B u s+a_{3}W a t e r+a_{4}G a s+a_{5}D t u r n_{t-1}}\\ &{\\phantom{\\frac{1}{1}}+a_{6}N c s k e w_{t-1}+a_{7}S i g m a_{t-1}+a_{8}W r e t_{t-1}+a_{9}S i z e_{t-1}+a_{10}M B_{t-1}}\\ &{\\phantom{\\frac{1}{1}}+a_{11}L e V_{t-1}+a_{12}R o a_{t-1}+a_{14}A c c m_{t-1}+\\varepsilon_{t}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nWe estimate Equation (6) using OLS and we then use the fitted value, Pre_Dshit-1, as an instrumental variable for managers political ranks in our model linking political ranks to  \n\nstock price crash risk.  \n\nResults are reported in Table 7. Panel A presents results for the first-stage OLS regression. The coefficient on Space is negative and significant (-o.o711, $t=-6.72,$ ,the coefficients on Bus and Gas are positive and significant (0.o023, $t=9.60$ and 0.0021, $t=$ 2.16, respectively). These results are consistent with our expectation that high political ranks are associated with a higher level of urbanization and better public facilities. However, the coefficient on Wateris negative and significant (-0.0110, $t=-2.73,$ ,against our initial expectation.10  \n\nWe also check the relevance and validity of the instruments. The minimum eigenvalue statistics for the instruments is 35.38, which rejects weak instruments. The Chi-square value for the over-identification test is 1.90, which is insignificant.  \n\nPanel B represents the second-stage results. Baseline results are in Columns (1) and (2). The coefficients on Dshi-1 are negative (-0.0863, $z=\\cdot1.78$ using Crasht; -0.2142, $t=$ -2.48 using Ncskew), suggesting a negative association between political ranks and the stock price crash risk. Columns (3) to (6) examine the impact of manager age on the association between political ranks and stock price crash risk. For the low age subsample $(A g e_{t^{-1}}\\leq51)$ , we find that the coefficient on Dshit-1 is negative and significant (-0.3665, $t=$ -2.38) when we use Ncskewt (Column (6), while it is negative but insignificant (-0.0888, $\\boldsymbol{z}$ $=\\cdot1.09)$ when we use Crasht (Column (4). For the high age subsample $(A g e_{t-1}>51)$ ,we find that the coefficients on Dshit-1 are not significant in both Columns (3) and (5). Differences in the magnitudes of the coefficients in subsamples are insignificant. Columns (7) to (10) examine the effect of managers' tenure on the association between political ranks and stock price crash risk. We find that during the early stage of their  \n\ntenure $\\left(T e n u r e_{t-1}\\leq2\\right)$ , the coefficients on Dshit1 are negative and significant (-0.1376, $z=$ 2.09 using Crasht; -0.3705, $t=\\cdot2.99$ using Ncskewt). During the later stage of their tenure $\\left(T e n u r e_{t-1}>2\\right)$ , the effect of Dshit-1 is insignificant, irrespective of whether Crash or Ncskew is used. Differences in the magnitudes of the coefficients in subsamples are insignificant. Overall, with an instrumental variable approach, we continue to find support for a negative association between political ranks and crash risk.  \n\n### Change Model  \n\nThe use of a change model helps us alleviate concerns of omitted correlated variables and reverse causality. To this effect, we define the change in political rank ADshit1 as $D s h i_{t1}-D s h i_{t2}$ . All other variables are also differenced. In most cases, a manager's rank in Year $t1$ is equal to that in Year $t2$ . We drop these observations. Therefore, this sample does not include observations without a change in managers' ranks. We define an indicator $U p_{t-1}$ that equals 1 if a manager's rank in Year $t{\\cdot}1$ is higher than that in Year $t{-}2$ and 0 if a manager's rank in Year $t1$ is lower than that in Year $t^{2}$  \n\nResults are reported in Panel A, Table 8 (differenced controls are included in the regressions but untabulated to conserve space). When the dependent variable is ACrasht-1, we use the ordered logit (ologit) model in which 4Crasht-1 can take multiple integer values. Columns (1) and (2) include observations with ADshit- $^{1}$ between $^-1$ and $+1$ ， Columns (3) and (4) between $\\cdot2$ and $+2$ and Columns (5) and (6) between $^{-3}$ and $+3$ . We generally find a negative association between the change in political ranks and the change in stock price crash risk.  \n\nWe next examine the effect of changes in political ranks due to chairman turnovers or control chain changes. We also expand our sample by including observations with no changes in managers' ranks. We define the following: Stablet-1 equals 1 if a chairman's rank in Year $t{}^{1}$ equals to that in Year $t{-}2$ , and 0 otherwise; Up_chairmant-1 equals 1 if a chairman's rank in Year $t^{1}$ is higher than that in Year $t2$ due to a chairman change, and 0 otherwise; Up_chaint $^{\\cdot1}$ equals 1 if a chairman's rank in Year $t1$ is higher than that in Year $t^{2}$ due to a control chain change, and O otherwise; and Up_othert $^{\\cdot\\bar{I}}$ equals 1 if a chairman's rank in Year $t1$ is higher than that in Year $t2$ due to a reason other than a chairman change or a control chain change, and 0 otherwise.  \n\nResults are reported in Panel B, Table 8. While the coefficients on Up_chairmanti are insignificant, the coefficients on Up_chainti are negative and significant using Crasht (-0.5317, $z=\\cdot2.19$ ;-0.5065, $z=\\cdot2.20$ ;-0.4665, $z=\\cdot2.02,$ 0. It appears that the change effect mainly comes from changes in political ranks due to changes in control chains.11  \n\nOverall, results of our changes analysis are weaker than those of the level analysis. Nevertheless, they yield similar inferences with respect to the impact of political ranks on stock price crash risk.  \n\n### Manager Retirement  \n\nAnother way of addressing endogeneity is to identify a shock to managers' age and determine if it alters the association between political ranks and crash risk. A manager retirement is such a shock as it usually brings in a younger manager. In such a case, one would expect the negative association between crash risk and political ranks to be more pronounced after the retirement of incumbent managers.  \n\nWe perform a test using retirement as an exogenous shock. We impose two conditions. First, the retiring chairman's political rank and his or her successor' political rank are the same. Second, the reason for the incumbent chairman's exit is retirement. We identify 88 cases of retirements. We find that the succeeding managers are much younger than the retiring managers (mean: 49.7 versus 62.1; median: 45.5 versus 62). This naturally induces a sudden shock in manager age. We examine a six-year period around a  \n\nmanager's retirement (years $^{-3}$ to 2). We define an indicator variable Postretiret that equals 1 for years 0, 1 and 2 and 0 for years $^{-3}$ $-2$ and $^{-1}$ . We also define Postyoungt that equals O before retirement and equals the age difference at the time of retirement between the retiring and the succeeding chairmen. We include Dshit1, Postretiret (Postyoungd) and Postretiret: Dshit-a (Postryoungt Dshit-1) in the following regression:  \n\n$C r a s h_{t}/N c s k e W_{t}=a_{0}+a_{1}P o s t r e t i r e_{t}($ Postyoungt) + a2Postretiret·Dshiit1 (Postyoungt·Dshit1) + asDshit$\\begin{array}{r l}{}&{+~a_{4}D t u r n_{t^{-1}}+a_{5}N c s k e W t\\cdot1+a_{6}S i g m a_{t^{-1}}+a_{7}W r e t_{t^{-1}}+a_{8}S i z e_{t^{-1}}}\\ {}&{+~a_{9}M B_{t^{-1}}+a_{10}L e V t_{t^{-1}}+a_{11}R o a_{t^{-1}}+a_{12}A c c m_{t^{-1}}+\\varepsilon_{t},}\\end{array}$ where all other variables are as defined earlier.  \n\nResults are reported in Table 9. In the regression using Postretiret, the coefficient on Postretirer Dshit-1 is negative and marginally significant using Crash (-0.5749, $z=\\cdot1.60)$ suggesting that retirement brings about a further reduction in crash risk associated with political ranks. It is insignificant using Ncskewt. In the regression using Postyoungt, the coefficients on Postryoungt Dshit-1 are negative and significant (-0.0648, $z=\\cdot2.63$ for Crash; -0.0094, $t=\\cdot1.76$ for Ncskew). Overall, we find some evidence that the negative association between crash risk and political ranks enhances (becomes more negative) after retirement when a younger manager is brought in.  \n\n## Robustness Checks  \n\n### Principal and Deputy Ranks  \n\nManagers in China's state-owned firms normally have principal and deputy ranks. Due to (i) the existence of deputy provincial-level cities (such as Qingdao, Nanjing, Shenzhen, Xiamen, where mayors of deputy provincial-level cities are equivalent in ranks to those of deputy provincial governors); (i) differences in ranks among universities (such as deputy ministry-level universities, also called centrally controlled universities, where presidents and party secretaries are nominated by the Central Personnel Organizational Department); and (i) differences in positions within groups, we can indirectly obtain  \n\ninformation on whether a manager has a principal or a deputy rank. We admit, however, that this approach to identifying principal versus deputy ranks may potentially involve measurement errors.  \n\nNevertheless, we perform a test distinguishing a principal rank from a deputy rank for a chairman. If a chairman has a principal rank, we add 0.5 to our original Dshi-1. If a chairman has a deputy rank, we stick to our original Dshit-1. Results are reported in Columns (1) and (2) of Panel A, Table 10 (all controls are included in the regressions but untabulated to conserve space). The coefficients on Dshit-1 are negative and significant (-0.1448, $z=\\cdot2.96$ using Crasht; -0.0258, $t=\\tau2.02$ using Ncskewt). Our main inference on the negative association between political rank and crash risk therefore remains unchanged with the consideration of principal and deputy ranks.  \n\n### Indicators for Ranks  \n\nWe define three indicators to evaluate whether the four different ranks yield differing results. Dshi4 equals 1 if $D s h i=4$ (provincial and ministerial level) and O otherwise. Dshi3equals 1 if $D s h i=3$ (department and bureau level) and 0 otherwise. Dshi2 equals 1 if $D s h i=2$ (county and division level) and 0 otherwise. As shown in Table B, Table 10 (all controls are included in the regressions but untabulated to conserve space), the magnitudes of the negative coefficients on Dshi4, Dshi3 and Dshi2 decline monotonically, supporting our hypothesis that stock price crash risk decreases with political ranks.  \n\n### Comparison with Non-state-owned Firms  \n\nState-owned firms and non-state-owned firms are very different from each other. We further examine whether non-state-owned firms without politically ranked managers have a higher level of stock price crash risk. We define variables $S O E_{t}$ (an indicator that equals 1 if a firm is state-owned, and O otherwise), Highdshit (an indicator that equals 1 if a state-owned firm manager's rank is at or higher than the department or the bureau level, and O otherwise), Lowdshit (an indicator that equals 1 if a state-owned firm manager's rank is lower than the department or the bureau level, and O otherwise).  \n\nAs shown in Panel C, Table 10 (all controls are included in the regressions but untabulated to conserve space), when stock price crash risk (Crash or Nsckew) is regressed on $S O E$ (Columns (1) and (2), the coefficient on SOEis negative and significant using Ncskew (-0.0437, $t=-2.58,$ , though it is negative but insignificant using Crash (-0.0858, $_{Z}=\\cdot1.42)$ . This finding suggests that stock price crash risk is lower for state-owned firms than for non-state-owned firms. When stock price crash risk (Crash or Nsckew) is regressed on Highdshi and Lowdshi (Columns (3) and (4)), the coefficients on Highdshi are negative and significant (-0.1616, $z=\\cdot2.17$ using Crash; -0.0656, $t=\\cdot3.24$ using Ncskew). The coefficients on Lowdshi are of a lower magnitude (-0.0542, $z=\\cdot0.83$ using Crash; -0.0403, $t=\\tau2.22$ using Ncskew). This result suggests that in general, stock price crash risk is lower for state-owned firms than for non-state-owned firms and that within state-owned firms, it is even lower for those with higher ranked managers.  \n\n# V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  \n\nA firm's stock price crash risk is a function of its contracts among its various stakeholders. However, research based on mature markets focuses on the explicit contract between shareholders and managers. Through an analysis of the tournament-style managerial labor market of China's state-owned firms, we argue that the contract between the state and managers is also an important factor that influences stock price crash risk. In a relatively closed pyramidal internal managerial labor market, to maintain their current positions and seek promotions, managers display caution and risk-aversion in their behaviors, leading to a negative association between political ranks and stock price crash risk. Our results support this prediction. Further analysis shows that this negative association mainly exists in firms with relatively young managers and managers with relatively short tenure. Institutions also play a role in affecting how political ranks reduce the crash risk. This effect is only pronounced in regions with weak market forces, in firms without foreign investors, without political connections, and during periods with no local government leaders' or managers' political promotions. We conclude that the political ranking system is an important factor that helps reduce the stock price crash risk.  \n\n# References  \n\nBae, K.-H., C. Lim, and K. C. J. Wei. 2006.

The authors, therefore, provide a concise synthesis of the theory and its key concepts, reviewitsuseinthemanagementliterature,and putforwarddirectionsforfutureresearchthat will encourage scholars to use signaling theory in new ways and to develop more complex formulations andnuancedvariations of thetheory.  \n\nKeywords: signal; signaling theory; information asymmetry; literature review  \n\nWhen top executives increase ownership stakes in their firms, they communicate to capital markets that diversification strategies are in the owners? best interests (Goranova, Alessandri, Brandes, & Dharwadkar, 2007). A college football coach visits area high schools in a HummerTM limousine emblazoned with the school's logo to denote a resource-rich environment to prospective recruits (Turban & Cable, 2003). Leaders of a young firm in an initial public offering (IPO) stack their board with a diverse group of prestigious directors to send a message to potential investors about the firm's legitimacy (Certo, 2003; Filatotchev & Bishop, 2002). Each of these examples illustrates how one party may undertake actions to signal its underlying quality to other parties.  \n\nSignaling theory is fundamentally concerned with reducing information asymmetry between two parties (Spence, 2002). For example, Spence's (1973) seminal work on labor markets demonstrated how a job applicant might engage in behaviors to reduce information asymmetry that hampers the selection ability of prospective employers. Spence illustrated how high-quality prospective employees distinguish themselves from low-quality prospects via the costly signal of rigorous higher education. This work triggered an enormous volume of literature applying signaling theory to selection scenarios that occur in a range of disciplines from anthropology to zoology (Bird & Smith, 2005).  \n\nManagement scholars have also applied signaling theory to help explain the influence of information asymmetry in a wide array of research contexts. A recent study of corporate governance, for example, shows how CEOs signal the unobservable quality of their firms to potential investors via the observable quality of their financial statements (Zhang & Wiersema, 2009). Diversity researchers use signaling theory to explain how firms use heterogeneous boards to communicate adherence to social values to a range of organizational stakeholders (Miller & Triana, 2009). Signaling theory is frequently used in the entrepreneurship literature, where scholars have examined the signaling value of board characteristics (Certo, 2003), top management team (TMT) characteristics (Lester, Certo, Dalton, Dalton, & Cannella, 2006), venture capitalist and angel investor presence (Elitzur & Gavius, 2003), and founder involvement (Busenitz, Fiet, & Moesel, 2005). Signaling theory is also important to human resource management, where a number of studies have examined signaling that occurs during the recruitment process (Suazo, Martinez, & Sandoval, 2009). As illustrated in Figure 1, the use of signaling theory has gained momentum in the management literature in recent years as scholars have expanded the range of potential signals and the contexts in which signaling occurs.  \n\nDespite the emergence of signaling theory in management research, as of yet there exists no concise review in the management literature. As a result, management scholars almost universally refer to either Spence's (1973) examination of signaling in job markets or Ross's (1977) study of managerial incentives as signals to describe the theory's central tenets. Over time, however, the key concepts underlying signaling theory have become blurred (Highhouse, Thornbury, & Little, 2007), causing some to argue that signaling theory is ill defined (Ehrhart & Ziegert, 2005). Although a number of studies integrate signaling concepts with related management theories (e.g., Deephouse, 2000; Ryan, Sacco, McFarland, & Kriska, 2000; Sanders & Boivie, 2004), no existing management research has systematically described the core ideas of signaling theory and how management scholars have applied them. We address this gap in the literature by reviewing management research relying on signaling theory.  \n\nOur review offers several intended contributions to management research involving signaling theory. First, we collect and synthesize signaling theory's key constructs. This includes  \n\n![](images/d0cc576a1d44c5f40b7cdfccc73e0d4e6e54a64554fed48eae0c6da56c704b3e.jpg)  \nFigure 1 Management Publications That Cite Signaling or Signaling Theory, 1989-2009  \n\nNote: The search terms included the British variant signalling theory.  \n\ndescribing the important role of information asymmetry in the signaling process and reviewing key studies in economics to explicate core signaling concepts. We are hopeful this section will provide an extra measure of clarity to the literature, as our review revealed that research in management utilizing signaling theory is laden with inconsistent terminology. We then consider how management scholars have used the theory to study and explain organizational phenomena. We examined key studies dealing with these issues from leading management journals, including the Academy of Management Journal, Academy of Management Review, Journal of Management, Journal of Management Studies, Strategic Management Journal, Journal of Business Venturing, Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, Journal of Applied Psychology, and Personnel Psychology. This section, we hope, will help unify and integrate the diverse ways in which management researchers have applied signaling theory to organizational concerns. Lastly, we extend the discussion of signaling theory in the literature by highlighting and developing a number of potential avenues for future management research. We are hopeful the ideas we put forth encourage scholars to use signaling theory in new ways and to develop more complex formulations and nuanced variations of the theory.  \n\n## Information Asymmetry and Signaling Theory  \n\n### Information Asymmetry  \n\nInformation affects the decision-making processes used by individuals in households, businesses, and governments. Individuals make decisions based on public information, which is freely available, and private information, which is available to only a subset of the public. Stiglitz (2002: 469) explained that information asymmetries occur when “different people know different things.\"” Because some information is private, information asymmetries arise between those who hold that information and those who could potentially make better decisions if they had it.  \n\nFor more than a century, formal economic models of decision-making processes were based on the assumption of perfect information, where such information asymmetries are ignored (Stiglitz, 2002). Despite the well-known imperfections of information, economists had largely assumed that markets with minor information imperfections would behave substantively the same as markets with perfect information (Stiglitz, 2oo0). A number of scholars have devoted their careers to understanding the extent to which imperfect information influences decision making in the marketplace. In fact, George Akerlof, Michael Spence, and Joseph Stiglitz received the 2001 Nobel Prize in Economics for their work in information economics. Advances in this regard appear to reveal the limited utility of many traditional economic models but also provide insights regarding phenomena that traditional models do not consider (Stiglitz, 1985).  \n\nStiglitz (2000) highlights two broad types of information where asymmetry is particularly important: information about quality and information about intent. In the first case, information asymmetry is important when one party is not fully aware of the characteristics of another party. In the second case, information asymmetry also is important when one party is concerned about another party's behavior or behavioral intentions (Elitzur & Gavious, 2003). Much of the research on information asymmetry about behavior and intentions examines the use of incentives as mechanisms for reducing potential moral hazards that result from an individual's behavior (Jensen & Meckling, 1976; Ross, 1973). For the most part, this literature on moral hazard in the context of executive decision making has been well documented (for an excellent review, see Devers, Cannella, Reilly, & Yoder, 2007). In contrast, we focus on the role of signaling in understanding how parties resolve information asymmetries about latent and unobservable quality, which constitutes the majority of management studies that explicitly invoke signaling theory.  \n\n### Signaling Theory  \n\nThe intuitive nature of signaling theory in part helps explain its pervasiveness. A journalist once famously asked Spence, who first put forth the theory, if it were possible that one could receive the Nobel Prize in Economics for simply noticing that in some markets certain participants do not know certain things that others in the market may wish to communicate (Spence, 2002). Spence replied that the correct answer was probably “no\" but that what did blossom at the time was a serious attempt to capture the informational aspects of market structures. The profundity of the theory, therefore, lies in ascribing costs to information acquisition processes that resolve information asymmetries in a wide range of economic and socialphenomena.  \n\nIn his formulation of signaling theory, Spence (1973) utilized the labor market to model the signaling function of education. Potential employers lack information about the quality of job candidates. The candidates, therefore, obtain education to signal their quality and reduce information asymmetries. This is presumably a reliable signal because lower quality candidates would not be able to withstand the rigors of higher education. Spence's model stands in contrast to human capital theory because he deemphasizes the role of education for increasing worker productivity and focuses instead on education as a means to communicate otherwise unobservable characteristics of the job candidate (Weiss, 1995).  \n\nKirmani and Rao (20o0) provide a general example that helps illustrate a basic signaling model. Like most examples of signaling, the authors distinguish between two entities: highquality firms and low-quality firms. Although the firms in this example know their own true quality, outsiders (e.g., investors, customers) do not, so information asymmetry is present. Consequently, each firm has the opportunity to signal or not signal its true quality to outsiders. When high-quality firms signal, they receive Payoff A, and when they do not signal they receive Payoff B. In contrast, low-quality firms receive Payoff C when they signal and Payoff D when they do not signal. Signaling represents a viable strategy for high-quality firms when $\\mathrm{A}>\\mathrm{B}$ and when $\\mathrm{D}>\\mathrm{C}$ Given these circumstances, high-quality firms are motivated to signal and low-quality firms are not, which results in a separating equilibrium. In such cases, outsiders are able to accurately distinguish between high- and low-quality firms. In contrast, when both types of firms benefit from signaling (i.e., $\\mathrm{~A~}>\\mathrm{~B~}$ and $\\mathrm{C}>\\mathrm{D}$ ), a pooling equilibrium results and outsiders are not able to distinguish between the two types of firms (for a review of pooling and separating equilibria, see Cadsby, Frank, & Maksimovic, 1990).  \n\nFinancial economists have developed several examples to demonstrate these general relationships. They have posited, for instance, that firm debt (Ross, 1973) and dividends (Bhattacharya, 1979) represent signals of firm quality. According to these models, only high-quality firms have the ability to make interest and dividend payments over the long term. In contrast, lowquality firms will not be able to sustain such payments. Consequently, such signals influence outside observers’ (e.g., lenders, investors) perceptions of firm quality. Owing to this foundational work, many of the core concepts and constructs of signaling theory grew out of the finance and economics literatures (Riley, 2001).  \n\nAlthough most signaling models include quality as the distinguishing characteristic, the notion of quality can be interpreted in a wide range of relevant ways. For the purposes of our review, quality refers to the underlying, unobservable ability of the signaler to fulfill the needs or demands of an outsider observing the signal. In Spence's classic example, quality refers to the unobservable ability of the individual, which is signaled by completion of the educational requirements necessary for graduation. In Ross's example, quality refers to the unobservable ability of the organization to earn positive cash flows in the future, which may be signaled by financial structure and/or managerial incentives. The notion of quality shares some characteristics with terms such as reputation (Kreps & Wilson, 1982) and prestige (Certo, 2003), but we put forth that these terms are largely socially constructed and derive from the signaler's unobserved quality (or lack thereof).  \n\n### Key Concepts in Signaling  \n\nIn the previous discussion, we highlighted the relationship between information asymmetry and signaling theory. In this section, we review signaling theory's primary elements in the form of a timeline, illustrated in Figure 2. The timeline includes two primary actors—-the signaler and receiver—as well as the signal itself. This figure also shows possible feedback to the signaler and the signaling environment, but we describe these ancillary mechanisms in the next section where we review signaling in the management literature. Also, some situations may involve multiple signalers, receivers, and/or signals. For instance, myriad individuals (e.g., investors, bondholders, etc.) may observe multiple, possibly even competing, signals sent by different entities within a firm. We circumvent these issues here to explain the theoretical concepts in their simplest form by focusing on a single dyad, signaler and receiver, communicating one signal. This approach is consistent with how signaling theory has developed as a one-to-one or transaction-specific communication.  \n\n![](images/58ddc68831236c91ed94d7798014d257e7276a4d32372df6291525542ba31412.jpg)  \nFigure 2 Signaling Timeline   \nNote: $\\mathrm{\\Deltat=}$ time.  \n\nSignaler. At the essence of signaling theory is that signalers are insiders (e.g., executives or managers) who obtain information about an individual (e.g., Spence, 1973), product (e.g. Kirmani & Rao, 2000), or organization (e.g., Ross, 1977) that is not available to outsiders. At a broad level, insiders obtain information, some of which is positive and some of which is negative, that outsiders would find useful. This information could include, for example, specifics about the organization's products or services. Such information might include early stage research-and-development results or later stage news regarding preliminary sales results reported by sales agents. Insiders also obtain information about other aspects of the organization such as pending lawsuits or union negotiations. Simply stated, this private information provides insiders with a privileged perspective regarding the underlying quality of some aspect of the individual, product, or organization.  \n\nSignal. Insiders obtain both positive and negative private information, and they must decide whether to communicate this information to outsiders. Signaling theory focuses primarily on the deliberate communication of positive information in an effort to convey positive organizational attributes. With that said, some scholars have examined actions taken by insiders that communicate negative information about organizational attributes. For instance, issuing new shares of a firm is generally considered a negative signal because executives may issue equity when they believe their company's stock price is overvalued (Myers & Majluf, 1984). It is important to note, however, that insiders generally do not send these negative signals to outsiders with a view toward reducing information asymmetry, but this is often an unintended consequence of the insider's action.  \n\nIn contrast, signaling theory focuses mainly on actions insiders take to intentionally communicate positive, imperceptible qualities of the insider. Insiders could potentially inundate outsiders with observable actions, but not all of these actions are useful as signals. There are, however, two chief characteristics of efficacious signals. The first is signal observability, which refers to the extent to which outsiders are able to notice the signal. If actions insiders take are not readily observed by outsiders, it is difficult to use those actions to communicate withreceivers.  \n\nObservability is a necessary but not sufficient characteristic of a signal; signal cost represents the second characteristic of efficacious signals. Signal cost is so central to signaling theory that some refer to it as the “theory of costly signaling” (e.g., Bird & Smith, 2005). The notion of cost in the signaling context involves the fact that some signalers are in a better position than others to absorb the associated costs. The costs associated with obtaining ISO9000 certification, for example, are high because the certification process is time consuming, and these costs make cheating, or false signaling, difficult. However, ISO90o0 certification is less costly for a high-quality manufacturer as compared with a low-quality manufacturer because a low-quality manufacturer would be required to implement considerably more change to be awarded the certification. If a signaler does not have the underlying quality associated with the signal but believes the benefits of signaling outweigh the costs of producing the signal, the signaler may be motivated to attempt false signaling. If this were to happen, misleading signals would proliferate until receivers learn to ignore them. Thus, to maintain their effectiveness, the costs of signals must be structured in such a way that dishonest signals do not pay.2  \n\nReceiver. The receiver of the signal is the third element in the signaling timeline. According to signaling models, receivers are outsiders who lack information about the organization in question but would like to receive this information. At the same time, signalers and receivers also have partially conflicting interests such that successful deceit would benefit the signaler at the expense of the receiver (Bird & Smith, 2005). For signaling to take place, the signaler should benefit by some action from the receiver that the receiver would not otherwise have done (i.e., signaling should have a strategic effect); this usually involves selection of the signaler in favor of some alternatives. For example, the receiver may make a choice about hiring, purchasing, or investing. Studies testing signaling theory incorporate shareholders (Certo, Daily, & Dalton, 2001) and debt holders (e.g., Elliot, Prevost, & Rao, 2009) as receivers. Studies in marketing use customers as receivers (Basuroy, Desai, & Talukdar, 2006; Rao, Qu, & Ruekert, 1999). A key point to this signaling is that these outsiders stand to gain (either directly or in a shared manner with the signaler) from making decisions based on information obtained from these signals. Shareholders, for example, would profit from buying shares of companies that signal more profitable futures. Similarly, customers would gain from purchasing goods and services that are associated with signals of high quality.  \n\n## Management Research on Signaling  \n\nManagement scholars have applied signaling theory to a range of organizational concerns, summarized in Table 1. We list the signaler, signal, and receiver that are the primary focus of each study and note the key contributions the study makes to furthering our knowledge of signaling theory. In addition to applying the theory, several studies have extended signaling constructs and integrated the theory with other explanations of organizational phenomena. Therefore, in Table 2 we summarize definitions of the key concepts from the prior section as well as those introduced here in our review of signaling theory in the management literature.  \n\n### Signaler  \n\nSignalers in the management literature generally represent a person, product, or firm. Organizational behavior and human resource management (OB/HR) studies focus mainly on signals emanating from individuals, such as recruiters (Ehrhart & Zeigert, 2005; Ma & Allen, 2009; Rynes, Bretz, & Gerhart, 1991), managers (Ramaswami, Dreher, Bretz, & Wiethoff, 2010), or employees (Hochwater, Ferris, Zinko, Arnell, & James, 2007). However, some human resource studies also explore firm-level signalers, with a view toward understanding how job seekers and applicants examine visible organizational characteristics to assess unobservable qualities, such as organizational culture (Highhouse et al., 2007; Ryan et al., 2000). Entrepreneurship studies, on the other hand, focus almost exclusively on the leaders of start-up and IPO firms as signalers (Bruton, Chahine, & Filatotchev, 2009; Zimmerman, 2008), although some work examines the signaling that occurs by franchisors (Michael, 2009) and individual entrepreneurs (Elitzur & Gavious, 2003). Strategy studies lay somewhere in the middle. Many strategy studies consider the signals sent by firms (Basdeo, Smith, Grimm, Rindova, & Derfus, 2006; Zhang & Wiersema, 2009), but others are concerned with specific groups of individuals such as managers (Carter, 2006; Goranova et al., 2007) and directors (Kang, 2008; Miller & Triana, 2009). Still other strategy studies explore product signals (Chung & Kalnins, 2001; Lampel & Shamsie, 2000), but these are more extensively examined in the marketing literature (Gammoh, Voss, & Chakraborty, 2006; Ra0 et al., 1999).  \n\nBecause signalers and receivers have partially competing interests, inferior signalers have incentive to “cheat,” intentionally producing false signals so that receivers will select them (Johnstone & Grafen 1993). The potential presence of false signalers is inherent to many management studies, which places emphasis on the importance of differential signal costs for high-quality and low-quality signalers (Ndofor & Levitas, 2004). For instance, Westphal and Zajac (2001) describe how some firms that signal future stock repurchases do not actually purchase the stock; the authors refer to this discrepancy between formal plans and subsequent actions as decoupling. Over time, firms and executives that decouple their plans and subsequent actions may develop a reputation for dishonesty. For this reason, management scholars refer to signal honesty (Durcikova & Gray, 2009), which we define as the extent to which the signaler actually has the underlying quality associated with the signal. Some management studies use different terms to describe the same concept.

(2005) use the term veracity, both of which speak to the signaler's integrity.  \n\nThe usefulness of a signal to the receiver depends on the extent to which the signal corresponds with the sought-after quality of the signaler (i.e., what we define in the next section as signal fit) and the extent to which signalers attempt to deceive (i.e., average honesty). Since both are required, we define this combination as signal reliability. Some management scholars use the term credibility to describe the same notion, the extent to which the signaler is honest and the signal corresponds with signaler quality (Davila, Foster, & Gupta, 2003).3 Researchers frequently confuse signal fit, honesty, reliability, and related terms, often using them interchangeably, but the semantic distinctions we describe here may help clarify their distinct underlying concepts.  \n\nSignal  \n\nManagement scholars have identified a variety of signals of quality. One of the most central of these combines signaling theory with institutional theory, which sees firms striving for legitimacy in order to survive (Certo, 2003). One way firms gain legitimacy is by signaling their unobservable quality with prestigious boards of directors (Certo et al., 2001) or prestigious top managers (Lester et al., 2006). Somewhat related, others have described how firms attempt to gain a positive reputation over time as a signal of underlying quality (Coff, 2002; Deephouse, 2000). Another common signal in the management literature is focused on the firm's owners. Because insiders have access to information from which others could benefit, they may signal firm quality through insider ownership, which is obviously costly to the signaler (Filatotchev & Bishop, 2002; Sanders & Boivie, 2004). For start-ups, founder ownership can be an even more important signal of quality, given that the founder is likely to have more information than anyone else about firm quality (Busenitz et al., 2005). Still other signals of quality in the management literature include interorganizational ties (Gulati & Higgins, 2003; Park & Mezias, 2005), management stability (Perkins & Hendry, 2005), and intellectual property (Warner, Fairbank, & Steensma, 2006).  \n\nSome signals of quality may be more readily detected by the receiver than other signals are, so management scholars sometimes suggest that signals may be “strong”’ or “\"weak\" (Gulati & Higgins, 2003). For instance, Lampel and Shamsie (2000) describe the strength of signals put out by movie studios about the quality of new film releases. In fact, a recent study by Ramaswami et al. (2010) draws a theoretical distinction between signal strength and visibility. These authors describe signal strength as how important, or salient, the signal is for a given signaler, which we would contend is akin to what we define next as signal fit. Visibility, on the other hand, is consistent with observability as we defined it in the previous section. Other management scholars have used related terms, such as signal clarity (Warner et al., 2006), intensity (Gao, Darroch, Mather, & MacGregor, 2008), and quality (Kao & Wu, 1994), to describe the same characteristic of observability in the absence of environmental or receiver distortion.  \n\nAn important scenario occurs when signalers send signals that are not particularly well correlated with the signaler's unobservable quality (Busenitz et al., 2005; Zhang & Wiersema, 2009). The discrepancy between the signal and signaler, in this case, is due to poor signaling. We, therefore, define signal fit as the extent to which the signal is correlated with unobservable quality. This is a statistical description of the relationship between public information (the signal) and private information (the signaler's unobservable quality). Fit and honesty may be distinguished insofar as the former is a characteristic of the signal, whereas the latter is a characteristic of the signaler.  \n\nSignaling effectiveness can be enhanced by sending more observable signals or increasing the number of signals, which we call signal frequency (Janney & Folta, 2003). Signals are essentially snapshots pointing to unobservable signaler quality at a particular point in time (Davila et al., 2003). However, organizations operate in dynamic environments, and information that is available to both signalers and receivers is constantly changing. If signalers wish to remain differentiated, they will signal repetitively to keep reducing information asymmetry (Janney & Folta, 2003, 2006; Park & Mezias, 2005). Signaling repetitively can increase the effectiveness of the signaling process, especially if one uses different signals to communicate the same message (Balboa & Marti, 2007). This raises the related issue of signal consistency, which we define as the agreement between multiple signals from one source (Gao et al., 2008). Conflicting signals confuse the receiver, making communication less effective, but signal consistency can help mitigate this problem (Chung & Kalnins, 2001; Fischer & Reuber, 2007).  \n\nAlthough we are concerned mainly with signals of quality in this review, some signals in management research are aimed at both quality and intent. As an example, Johnson and Greening (1999) proposed that managerial equity holdings serve as a signal to potential investors. Managers of high-quality firms demonstrate signaler quality by retaining large equity positions (Connelly, Hoskisson, Tihanyi, & Certo, 2010). If managers of low-quality firms imitate this strategy, they would likely experience decreases in personal wealth when the “true” value of the firm is revealed. Similarly, managerial holdings also point to managerial (signaler) intent (Filatotchev & Bishop, 2002). Whereas managers with high levels of equity are likely to make decisions consistent with shareholder preferences, managers with low levels of equity are less likely to make such decisions (Jensen & Meckling, 1976).  \n\n### Receiver  \n\nReceivers in the management literature are generally individuals or groups of individuals. In entrepreneurship studies, the receiver is nearly always an existing or potential investor, with some distinction between private (Busenitz et al., 2005; Daily, Certo, & Dalton, 2005; Michael, 2009) and public (Cohen & Dean, 2005; Jain, Jayaraman, & Kini, 2008) investors. Strategy researchers have also considered receivers that are existing shareholders, potential investors, or both (Kang, 2008; Park & Mezias, 2005), but they have also given attention to a broader array of stakeholders, such as consumers, competitors, and employees (Basdeo et al., 2006; Carter, 2006). OB/HR studies using signaling theory are most frequently concerned with the labor market, or elements within the labor market, as receivers (Davila et al., 2003; Ehrhart & Zeigert, 2005).  \n\nManagement researchers have found that signaling effectiveness is determined in part by the characteristics of the receiver. For example, the signaling process will not work if the receiver is not looking for the signal or does not know what to look for. Therefore, we define receiver attention as the extent to which receivers vigilantly scan the environment for signals. Gulati and Higgins (2003) lend support for this concept as they find that the success of a young company's signaling efforts depends in large part on whether receivers are attending to the IPO market. Monitoring the environment can be particularly important for weak signals, which are difficult to observe unless the receiver is looking for them (lmola & Kuusi, 2006). Once receivers have received a signal and used it to successfully make an informed choice, they are more likely to attend to similar signals in the future (Cohen & Dean, 2005).  \n\nOthers have noted how some receivers interpret signals differently than others do (Perkins & Hendry, 2005; Srivastava, 2001). We therefore define receiver interpretation as the process of translating signals into perceived meaning. For example, Branzei, Ursacki-Bryant, Vertinsky, and Zhang (2004) describe how different receivers may “calibrate”’ signals, giving signals different strengths or even different meanings. OB/HR researchers have been particularly helpful in extending our understanding of signaling to include the receiver's perspective (Suazo et al., 2009; Turban & Greening, 1996). For instance, Rynes (1991) describes how job applicants use signals from recruiters to draw conclusions about facets of organizational quality. Different applicants may not have the same concerns about their potential employers, so they attend to different signals or interpret the same signal differently (Highhouse et al., 2007). Receivers may apply weights to signals in accordance with preconceived notions about importance or cognitively distort signals so that their meanings diverge from the original intent of the signaler (Branzei et al., 2004; Ehrhart & Zieger, 2005).  \n\n### Feedback  \n\nAs management scholars have sought to apply signaling theory to organizational phenomena, a number of studies have uncovered the importance of receivers sending information back to signalers about the effectiveness of their signals (e.g., Gupta, Govindarajan, & Malhotra, 1999). To facilitate more efficient signaling, receivers can send feedback in the form of countersignals. The fundamental assumption here is that information asymmetry works in two directions: Receivers desire information about signalers, but signalers also desire information about receivers so that they may know which signals are most reliable, to which signals receivers are paying the most attention, and how receivers are interpreting signals. Signalers that heed such countersignals can adapt future signals to improve reliability (Gulati & Higgins, 2003). Thus, in the same way that receiver attention can improve the signaling process, signaler attention to countersignals can also result in more efficient signaling, particularly in an iterative or sequential bargaining context (Srivastava, 2001).  \n\n### Signaling Environment  \n\nThe signaling environment, either within an organization or between organizations, can also affect the extent to which signaling reduces information asymmetry (Rynes et al., 1991; Lester et al., 2006). Environmental distortion occurs whenever the medium for propagating the signal reduces the observability of the signal. For example, press releases serve as signals (Carter, 2006), but media outlets reporting on those releases introduce potential distortions. Branzei et al. (2004) describe how external referents, such as other receivers, can also change the relationships between signalers and receivers. For example, rankings signal educational quality for universities, but prospective students calibrate rankings based on the opinions of peers (i.e., other receivers). When a signal is interpreted by others in a particular way, an individual who is unsure about how to interpret the signal may look to imitation as a means of decision making (Sliwka, 2007). This could result in a bandwagon effect, where signals are interpreted in a certain manner that may or may not be accurate (McNamara, Haleblian, & Dykes, 2008). Other signalers are also important insofar as more honest signalers increase signal reliability and larger numbers of deceptive signalers decrease signal reliability.  \n\n## Future Research  \n\nManagement research has made substantive contributions toward understanding the complex signaling processes that occur between two parties in an environment of asymmetrical information. Scholars might pair our review of the management literature with reviews from biology (Maynard-Smith & Harper, 1995), anthropology (Bird & Smith, 2005), economics (Riley, 2001), and marketing (Kirmani & Rao, 2000) to form a more complete picture of the insights gained about signaling theory constructs, relationships, and processes. However, our review also shows that management research to date generally seeks to apply some of the most basic principles of signaling theory to help explain foundational signaling relationships. In contrast, less research has sought to extend the boundaries of what we know about signaling to develop a more comprehensive theory that scholars might use to explain a broader range of social and organizational phenomena. In this section, we describe some practical ways to do so, considering each of the key components in the signaling timeline. We also extend the discussion of future research by putting forward some key research questions in Table 3 that, if addressed, could inform each aspect of the signaling process. To illustrate our thinking about each research question, we provide examples for signals that pertain to a person, product, and firm.  \n\n### Signaler  \n\nThe questions management scholars choose to examine may have the potential to inform signaling theory in a number of ways. For instance, because signalers have the option of sending multiple signals over time; incorporating longer periods of time into signaling theory represents a viable area for future research. George and Jones (20o0) suggest that scholars consider how the past and the future are represented in a theory's constructs. The efficacy of a firm's signal, for example, may be influenced by historical signals as firms earn a reputation from prior signals (Heil & Robertson, 1991). Scholars have examined how firms may appoint prestigious directors to signal legitimacy to investors (Certo 2003; Certo et al., 2001). However, the effectiveness of such signals may depend on the firm's previous director appointments. Future research might investigate whether prestigious directors are more or less valuable when the firm has already appointed a number of prestigious directors. It may be, for example, that the value of signals diminishes as the number of signals increases. In addition, the future is embedded in the present in the form of expectations, possibilities, and strivings (George & Jones, 2ooo). This suggests that receivers’ interpretations of signals in the present could be moderated by their expectations or by what they strive to accomplish in the future via the signaling process.  \n\nThe signaler's choice of when to signal and how often to signal also requires further research attention. Janney and Folta (2003, 2006) are some of the first to have considered this issue as they describe a signaler's use of signals that grow weaker over time. Yet, we know little about how signalers might find an efficient balance of signal rates and durations, about the consequences of using signals that change faster or slower, and about how signals with different rates of change might interact with each other to enhance or diminish the signaling process.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">Firm Example Product Example Person Example Key Research Questions for Future Study</td><td rowspan=\"7\">management team ownership, board prestige, Firms send signals about quality via top and CEO tenure. quality via commercials, the premier, and inoe siuis pus sons s actor salaries. senior mentoring, compensation, and sd reare es sie promotion. portfolio of signals to maximize their collective effectiveness?

Sending different signals from the same signaler, or the same signal from different signalers, could change the way receivers interpret those signals.  \n\nFinally, future research might also further investigate the incentives of signalers. It may be, for example, that signals are less effective when a signaler has incentives to deceive the receiver. Studies might examine, for instance, the extent to which signals of firm quality are more or less predictive of firm performance when CEOs have incentives to artificially influence stock prices (e.g., Westphal & Zajac, 1998).  \n\n### Signal  \n\nAs illustrated in our review, studies of signaling theory often examine the quality of the signaler. Future research would benefit from examining in more depth the various qualities signaled and more carefully linking the signals used to measure these qualities. At its essence, the link between a signal and the underlying quality represents a measurement issue that we call signal fit. Does the signal represent a valid and reliable measure of the underlying quality that the signaler is attempting to communicate? Future research may benefit from theoretical work examining the conditions required to align signals with the desired signaled characteristic. In addition, signaling models often distinguish between high-quality and lowquality firms, but management researchers should note that firms reside on a continuum and not a dichotomy.  \n\nSignals that are not intentional are an avenue for future study that has been relatively ignored in the literature (Janney & Folta, 2003). Parties may send a wide range of signals without even being aware they are signaling (Spence, 2002). Such signals could potentially conflict with intentional signals or be communicating negative information about the signaler. Signalers may have incurred signal costs that are negatively, rather than positively, correlated with an unobservable characteristic that is valuable to receivers. As yet, however, there is little empirical study of such negative signals, how they are unique from other signals, or how they disturb or enhance the signaling process (Bell, Moore & Al-Shammari, 2008; Fischer & Reuber, 2007).  \n\nIn fact, there may be opportunity for management scholars to develop a conceptually based typology of signals that appear in organizational contexts. Biologists have cataloged and categorized signals from their own discipline in a variety of ways (Hasson, 1997; MaynardSmith & Harper, 1995; Vehrencamp, 2000). A large rack of antlers, for instance, is an honest signal that provides females with information about male genetic quality; differential squawks among nestlings, on the other hand, provide mother birds with information about which nestlings have the greatest need for food (Zahavi & Zahavi, 1997). Management researchers, too, might consider these classification schemes as a model and begin to partition the landscape of organizational signals into meaningful categories.  \n\nTo spur academic discussion along these lines, we offer the following classifications that could potentially describe different types of signals. Signals of quality, as described in this review, could potentially be divided into activators and pointers. Pointing signals indicate a characteristic, apart from the signal, that separates the signaler from competitors. Activating signals indicate a characteristic that separates the signaler from competitors and are also essential to activating the quality in the signaler (Hasson, 1997). Thus, for instance, the presence of outside directors on the board could be considered an activating signal of good corporate governance (Certo et al., 2001) because the directors are an important mechanism of bringing about good governance.  \n\nStill other possible categories include signals of intent, camouflage, and need. Intent signals indicate future action, possibly conditional on the receiver's response. Thus, for example, when a firm is quick to implement a response to a competitive action initiated by a rival it may signal toughness and resolve that the firm will not roll over easily in that market (Baum & Korn, 1999). Camouflage signals disguise a potential liability. These are different from other signals insofar as they are designed to divert attention away from a potential vulnerability toward some other characteristic. For example, Dacin, Oliver, and Roy (2007) describe how firms expanding internationally may be subject to liabilities of foreignness, so they use strategic alliances to draw attention away from those liabilities by signaling organizational legitimacy. Need signals communicate requirements to the receiver. Thus, for example, in a firm with multiple divisions or subsidiaries, each is responsible for signaling its need for common funds and resources, and headquarters is in the position of deciding which are signaling the greatest need (Gupta et al., 1999).  \n\n### Receiver  \n\nManagement research may also benefit from further examining the role of receivers in the signaling process. As we noted earlier, for example, management research on signaling focuses to a large extent on shareholders as receivers in the signaling process. Future research might study the impact of signals on additional stakeholders. For example, as many stakeholders such as host communities, employees, and customers become increasingly concerned about sustainability, how can firms signal their commitment to a sustainable enterprise? It seems that false signaling may be of particular concern in this situation, so how can firms leverage signal costs and penalty costs to differentiate themselves from lower quality (less sustainably minded) firms? As firms obtain feedback on the importance of sustainability from different and possibly competing stakeholders, such as government in the form of regulations and consumers in the form of behavior, how do they differentially adjust their signaling activity?  \n\nAn important consideration that has received limited scholarly attention is how receivers meaningfully aggregate signals. There may be consistencies to the way individuals or organizations bracket their signaling episodes to ascribe meaning to groups of signals, which in turn gives rise to different signaling experiences for different receivers based on these groupings (Balboa & Marti, 2007). This raises the issue of how receivers interpret sequencing and signal patterns. To date, signaling theory research has typically focused on a given signal, but as the theory evolves, scholars could yield greater attention to more complex formulations. An important measure that deserves attention is signal separation, which would describe the extent to which a given signal in a sequence of signals is temporally or ordinally isolated from other signals. Similarly, signal precedence is a measure that would describe the extent to which a signal precedes or follows other signals. This research could help explain how receivers organize a coordinated series of signals into meaningful wholes (Rindova, Ferrier, Wiltbank, & Basdeo, 2002). Future research could explore how firms or individuals manage their portfolios of signals and how different types of signals interact with one another. Much in the way music has not only individual notes but also chords and melodies, scholars might begin to explore how receivers not only interpret individual signals but also examine sequences and motifs.  \n\nManagement scholars have relied primarily on a mechanistic understanding of signaling that emphasizes the technical aspects of signal transmission and reception. Alternative perspectives of the signaling process, however, could result in a different understanding of receiver interpretation. For example, a social constructivist view of signaling might consider the development of signals within their social contexts (Burr, 2003). In this perspective, signals would be created, given meaning, and institutionalized as a function of continuously interacting parties (e.g., Basdeo et al., 2006). Alternatively, applying a systemic model to the signaling process would emphasize integrated relationships between parts of the whole (cf. Bertalanffy & Sutherland, 1974, and general systems theory). Such a perspective would be less concerned with autonomous receivers, preferring instead to describe the entire signaling community as an indivisible whole. Park and Mezias (2005) touch on this perspective by explaining how the meanings of signals are embedded within the signaling environment. A systemic model of signaling is consistent with Langfield-Smith's (1992) notion of a “shared cognitive map,”\" where the meaning ascribed to signals is a function not only of individual interpretation but also of collective beliefs about the signal.  \n\n### Feedback  \n\nWe described the central role of costs in signaling theory, which is imperative to discourage false signaling. However, the management literature is mainly focused on signal costs, containing less discussion of the role of penalty costs, which are a form of negative feedback from the receiver (Gammoh et al., 2006). Future research might explore the extent to which signal costs and penalty costs serve as substitutes or complements. This would be important to gaining a better understanding of the implications for the signaling process when penalty costs are not enforced. Scholars might also consider the relative effectiveness of different types of penalties. For example, there is a range of negative feedback that may be sent when a partner in an interorganizational relationship detects a false signal. It may be immediate (e.g., the receiver could immediately terminate the relationship). It may be delayed (e.g., the receiver could maintain the relationship but not extend its duration or expand it in other contexts). It may be enforced by third parties (e.g., the receiver could leverage the court system to impose fines for the false signal). Lastly, it may be communal (e.g., the receiver communicates with other receivers that the signaler is not to be trusted; Chung & Kalnins, 2001). As scholars, we still have much to learn about what makes an effective penalty and how various types of penalties interact with signal costs to make a more effective signaling process.  \n\nAgain considering alternative perspectives, a critical needs model of signaling might change the way we view feedback in the signaling process. Critical needs theory would emphasize signaling as a means of extending control and describe signals as overt moves designed to persuade or subdue (Held, 1980). Feedback, in this model, would be to the benefit of the signaler but the detriment of the receiver. For example, scholars arguing from a critical needs perspective would describe the price of beer as a signal of product quality that beer producers use to manipulate consumers (Van Munching, 1997). Feedback about consumer (receiver) behavior provides signalers with added information that they may use to adjust their signals and gain even greater control. The benefits of considering this model in organizational signaling reside in its ability to explain the influence of power dependencies between signalers and receivers.  \n\n### Signaling Environment  \n\nThe signaling environment on the whole is an underresearched aspect of signaling theory. For example, in interorganizational signaling we might expect different effects to arise from the influence of the institutional environment, the task environment, and the industry competitive environment (Sanders & Boivie, 2004). Some of these influences may compete with each other to make signals more or less observable. As the context in which signaling occurs becomes more noisy, we would expect the value of the signaling process to diminish (Jiang, Belohlav, & Young, 2007; Zahra & Filatotchev, 2004). Lester et al. (2006) begin to address this issue as they consider the influence of environmental dynamism, complexity, and munificence on the signaling process. Although they did not find empirical evidence of moderation in the IPO context, their conceptual arguments warrant further attention in other signaling contexts.  \n\nIn addition, management research might further investigate the role of information asymmetry in studies of signaling theory. Other disciplines have developed measures of information asymmetry and incorporated the construct in signaling studies (Aboody & Lev, 2000; Frankel & Li, 2004), and management research would benefit from this approach. The addition of information symmetry would allow both theoretical and empirical research in management to incorporate and further develop the contingent nature of signaling.  \n\nAlthough we have partitioned our discussion of future research into separate sections to align with the structure of our review, there exist considerable opportunities for future research to bridge these domains. For example, signals have various characteristics (e.g., reliability, observability), but these characteristics might take on different meanings when used by different signalers. Similarly, we described areas of research surrounding the signaler and receiver, but certain signaler-receiver pairs may interact to yield especially effective, or ineffective, signaling. Also, potential exists for exploring signaling at multiple levels of analysis (Bamberger, 2008). Consider, for instance, how the aggregate signaling that occurs between managers and subordinates in an organization could have implications for signaling firm quality between the organization and its stakeholders (Wayne, Shore, & Liden, 1997).  \n\n## Conclusion  \n\nJoseph Stiglitz (2002: 473) observed that some individuals wish to convey information and others wish not to have information conveyed, but “in either case, the fact that actions convey information leads people to alter their behavior, and . . . this is why information imperfections have such profound effects.” Signaling theory provides a unique, practical, and empirically testable perspective on problems of social selection under conditions of imperfect information. In this review, we seek to bring clarity to the abundance of concepts that permeate the theory; describe the signalers, signals, and receivers that management scholars have explored as they have used the theory; and lay out a road map for how the scholarly community might advance the theory. The fact that researchers in areas as diverse as anthropology, economics, and marketing continue to use signaling theory to explain selection phenomena in their own disciplines is reassuring. We hope that our review of signaling theory in the management literature will lead researchers to extend and broaden their use of the theory when studying the eclectic range of selection issues that occur in and between organizations.  \n\n### Notes  \n\n1. Individuals may also serve as their own insiders when signaling about themselves (e.g., in the job market). Signals about investments are also common (e.g., Goranova, Alessandri, Brandes, & Dharwadkar, 2007), but we combine these with organizational signals. 2. Whereas signaling theory focuses mainly on costly signals (Riley, 2001), scholars have also extended research on information asymmetries to include less costly forms of communication. For example, Farrell and Rabin (1996), in an article titled “Cheap Talk,” provided an influential analysis of how insiders communicate costless information. In related work, Almazan, Banerji, and De Motta (2008) extended this perspective to model how managers employ cheap talk to communicate with capital markets. 3. This should be distinguished from the related notion of “\"credible commitment,” which is more about signaler intent than signaler quality (Bergara, Henisz, & Spiller, 1998).  \n\n### References  \n\nAboody, D., & Lev, B. 2000.

Employing an extensive U.S. sample, we find an inverse association between CSR engagement and the proxies of information asymmetry after controlling for various firm characteristics. The results hold using 2SLS considering the reverse side of information asymmetry influencing CSR activities. The results also hold after mitigating endogeneity based on the dynamic panel system generalized method of moment. Furthermore, the CSR-information asymmetry relation is amplified in high-risk firms due to managers’ efforts to build a good reputation. Last, we find that CSR engagement is inversely associated with reputational risk measure and lower predicted value of reputational risk is positively associated with lower information asymmetry measures. We interpret these results as supporting the stakeholder theory-based, reputation-building explanation  that considers CSR engagement as a vehicle to build and maintain firm reputation thereby enhancing the information environment.  \n\nKeywords   Corporate social responsibility $\\cdot$ Information asymmetry $\\cdot$ Reputation building $\\cdot$ Firm risk $\\cdot$ Information environment  \n\n## Introduction  \n\nThe central aim of this study is to investigate the relation between information asymmetry and a firm's engagement in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities in the U.S. public equity market. Specifically, we aim to empirically examine the simultaneous and endogenous relation between information asymmetry and CSR activities, and to investigate which aspect of a firm mitigates the possible relation between CSR and information asymmetry. Although the definitions of CSR vary, many studies suggest that it generally refers to serving people, communities, and the environment in ways that go above and beyond what is legally required of a firm (McWilliams and Siegel 2001; Margolis and Walsh 2003; Orlitzky et al. 2003; Ioannou and Serafeim 2014). Overall, CSR is an extension of a firm's efforts to foster sustainability via sound business practices. We consider that the empirical examination of the CSR-information asymmetry relation is important not only because the theory of information asymmetry is one of the most important modern developments in accounting, economics, finance, management, and other business studies, but also because the association between CSR and information asymmetry could have great implications for risk management using CSR initiatives.  \n\nModigliani and Miller (1963) assume that investors have access to the same information about a firm's future prospects as its management—symmetric information. In practice, however, managers often have better information than outside stockholders and non-investing stakeholders. This information asymmetry has important implications for  \n\nCSR because managers know more about the firm's CSR engagement in terms of its goal, plan, program, and related activities than outsiders, and CSR expenditure can be used as a signal of a firm's future prospects (Lys et al. 2015). Despite the implications of CSR for information asymmetry, direct evidence of an empirical association between CSR and information asymmetry, after mitigating endogeneity, remains largely understudied. While Cho et al. (2013) examine the empirical association between CSR and information asymmetry, they neither control for endogeneity nor investigate the empirical channel, i.e., firm risk that influences the CSR-information asymmetry link. In addition, their empirical proxy of information asymmetry is limited to a single measure of bid-ask spread. Traditionally, bid-offer spread is an accepted measure of liquidity costs in exchange-traded securities and of the size of the transaction cost, and therefore it is not completely clear whether the bid-ask spread measure alone is fully capturing a firm's information asymmetry. In this paper, we use a couple of different measures of information asymmetries previously used in the literature including analyst dispersion and price impact measure of Amihud (2002), respectively.  \n\nWe aim to contribute to the literature by systematically studying (i） the simultaneous and endogenous relation between information asymmetry and CSR. We further attempt to add our understanding of the CSR literature by investigating (ii) how firm risk affects the path from CSR to information asymmetry. Specifically, we find that the negative CSR-information asymmetry relation is amplified in high-risk firms. We interpret this as evidence of additional efforts by the managers of high-risk firms to reduce information asymmetry and to avoid adverse selection. In addition, (i) we contemplate various stakeholders’ (i.e., managers, shareholders, customers, suppliers, creditors, employees, regulators, etc.) influence on information environment. In particular, we first discuss managerial effort channel through their choices of CSR disclosure providing additional non-financial information to financial market, and then third-party disclosure channel including consumers' information exchange of a firm with high CSR, and informational roles of prospective and existing employees, creditors and financial market, government, security analysts and institutional investors, credit rating agencies, and media. Finally, by examining the empirical association among reputational risk, CSR, and information asymmetry, we aim to show that (iv) CSR activities decrease reputational risk and decreased reputational risk is useful in reducing information asymmetry. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the CSR-information asymmetry linkage by considering the above four issues that are distinct and understudied phenomena in the academic CSR literature.  \n\nTo perform the above tasks, we undertake and develop a reputation-building hypothesis (e,g., Freeman 1984; Makni et al. 2009; Jo and Harjoto 2011, 2012). Freeman's (1984) stakeholder theory, for instance, states that firms should use CSR as a mechanism to communicate better between managers and non-investing stakeholders. Similarly, Jo and Harjoto (2011, 2012） consider CSR engagement as a vehicle to reduce conflicts of interest among various stakeholders through recursive communication. If the reputation-building hypothesis is valid, then the level of information asymmetry should be inversely related to CSR engagement, via managerial effort channel and third-party disclosure channel that we further elaborate in detail in the following section.  \n\nOur results based on the U.S. sample during the period 1991-2010 suggest an inverse association between CSR engagement and information asymmetry measures after controlling for various firm characteristics. In addition, the above results continue to hold when we use 2SLS and we further confirm the negative association between CSR and the information asymmetry proxies even after mitigating endogeneity based on the dynamic panel system generalized method of moment (GMM) following Blundell and Bond (1998) and Wintoki et al. (2012). We also find that the negative CSR-information asymmetry relation is more significant in high-risk firms than in low-risk firms, which may imply that high-risk firm managers seek to avoid the adverse selection of investors by making efforts to provide additional non-financial information through CSR engagement. Furthermore, we empirically find that more CSR strengths and less CSR concerns both help reduce information asymmetry. Finally, we find that CSR is negatively associated with reputational risk measure and reduced predicted value of reputational risk is positively related to lower information asymmetry.  \n\nThe remainder of the study is organized as follows. The following section briefy describes the literature review and hypothesis development. We discuss the sample and measurement of CSR and information asymmetry, and our research design in the next section. Then, we present the empirical results and robustness checks. The final section presents a discussion of our findings and summarizes our conclusions.  \n\n## Literature Review and Hypothesis Development  \n\n### CSR and Information Asymmetry  \n\nRecently, researchers have examined various benefits of CSR engagement using direct financial measures of corporate financial performance (CFP) and have found that CSR is beneficial to firms in the following ways: firms achieve higher analyst following (Hong and Kacperczyk 2009) and receive more favorable recommendations from analysts (Ioannou and Serafeim 2014); CSR improves communication to shareholders on financial matters (Fieseler 2011); CSR encourages more effective corporate governance and higher firm value (Blazovich and Smith 2011; Jo and Harjoto 2011, 2012); CSR reduces a cost of equity (Dhaliwal et al. 2011; El Ghoul et al. 2011); CSR improves credit rating (Attig et al. 2013) and results in higher analyst forecast accuracy (Dhaliwal, et al. 2012).  \n\nAlthough there is no universally agreed rationale behind the association between CSR engagement and information asymmetry, we presume a stakeholder theory-based CSRinformation asymmetry nexus. While it may not be completely possible to satisfy all related stakeholders, reputation building, in which the role of the corporation is subject to discursive scrutiny by non-investing stakeholders (i.e., social or environmental activists) besides the shareholders, is receiving more attention in the literature (e.g., Freeman 1984; Makni et al. 2009; Jensen 2002; Calton and Payne 2003; Sherer et al. 2006; Jo and Harjoto 2011, 2012; Harjoto and Jo 2015). In addition to a sharper focus on reputation building, managers are considering their firms? fiduciary and moral responsibilities toward stakeholders (Jensen 2002; Aguilera et al. 2007; Cai et al. 2011).  \n\nPrevious studies suggest that CSR activities will raise a firm's reputation (Turban and Greening 1997; Albinger and Freeman 2000; Greening and Turban 2000), which is particularly important because those firms are repetitive players in the financial market. In particular, the reputationbuilding explanation suggests that high CSR firms are associated with a better information environment to sustain their reputation capital. Moreover, it is crucial that firms build and maintain a good reputation, especially those that require more intense monitoring. In such cases, reputation mitigates information asymmetry (Diamond 1991; Sufi 2007). Therefore, we conjecture that for firms that have high monitoring costs, face high risks, and are subject to adverse selection, it becomes more important to offer additional  non-financial  and  better  quality  information (Dhaliwal et al. 2011; Halov and Heider 2011) to build a good reputation.  \n\nCSR is a multidimensional construct involving shareholders, customers, creditors, employees, suppliers, and the community. A firm can achieve its objectives more easily if it has a relatively good reputation among its managers and internal and external third-party stakeholders.  \n\n#### Managerial Effort Channel  \n\nRegarding the managerial effort channel that reduces information asymmetry, there is a view that managers utilize CSR disclosure as a means to improve information transparency and strategies (Wood 1991; Dhaliwal et al. 2011). Wood (1991) maintains that the principle of managerial discretion recognizes managers as moral actors who are obliged to exercise their actions toward socially responsible outcomes and to improve information transparency. To the extent that firms with CSR engagement are more likely to disclose their CSR activities (Dhaliwal et al. 2011), firms investing in CSR activities consequently become more transparent.  \n\nWe also find evidence of reputation-building efforts by managers who voluntarily disclose additional information and seek to reduce the practice of earnings management and improve information quality. The literature suggests that CSR performance motivates the voluntary disclosure of CSR activities (e.g., Clarkson et al. 2008; Dhaliwal et al. 2011; Lyon and Maxwell 2011). In particular, high-performing firms want to signal their quality by highlighting their good performance or expected future performance (Clarkson et al. 2008; Lys et al. 2015), while poorly performing firms are looking to explain their poor performance (Patten 2002). High CSR firms are further expected to disclose more non-financial information (Dhaliwal et al. 2011). Similarly, Jo and Kim (2007, 2008) indicate that improved corporate transparency through frequent voluntary disclosure reduces  information asymmetry between insiders and outsiders.  \n\nWith respect to information quality control by managers, Kim et al. (2012) provide supportive evidence of the role of CSR in enhancing a firm's information quality. The authors show that managers of socially responsible firms are likely to produce high-quality financial reports and reduce earnings management—a proxy for a firm's accounting information quality. They argue that better CSR refects the ethical concerns of the management and drives transparent and reliable financial reporting. Furthermore, more transparent firms tend to reduce information asymmetry between the firm and its shareholders (e.g., Diamond and Verrecchia 1991; Lambert et al. 2007). Kim et al. (2014) also examine whether CSR mitigates the risk of a stock price crash, defined as the conditional skewness of return distribution, which captures asymmetry in risk. Their findings support the mitigating effect of CSR on the crash risk and thus the idea that if socially responsible firms commit to a high standard of transparency and engage in less hoarding of bad news, they would have a lower crash risk. Because information transparency with regard to CSR activities is a subset of the overall information environment, we expect that enhanced CSR disclosure will, at least partially, reduce information asymmetry. Higher levels of managers’ CSR disclosure providing additional non-financial information enhance information transparency and reduce informational asymmetries between a firm and its shareholders.  \n\n#### Third-party Information Disclosure Channel  \n\nWith regard to third-party disclosure, there are additional information roles of various stakeholders. First, we consider the information role of customers. If a firm is well regarded by its main customers, key stakeholders will prefer to do business with it ahead of others because they can rely on main customers’ positive experiences to influence other potential customers by word of mouth. A firm's reputation is based on the information its stakeholders have about its past and expected future performance. Such information may have been received first hand, but more often than not it will stem from information exchange, or word of mouth, namely, what customers hear from others. In fact, most brand reputation appears to be based on such recommendations. In many cases, similar to luxury cars or high-end stereos, consumers who know about the content of a firm's CSR activity far outnumber those who have actually tested it. Buyers typically trust each other, and sellers offer the best quality in response (Bolton et al. 2004; Bohnet and Huck 2004; Bracht and Feltovich 2007). Customers typically prefer doing business with a company with a high CSR reputation even if other companies’ products and services are available at a similar cost and quality. Consequently, the way consumers exchange information matters for a firm's reputation, and ultimately reduces information asymmetry.  \n\nSecond, customer-supplier networks are also characterized by greater information exchange (Baiman and Rajan 2002), and firm reputations of the related parties influence the value of information exchanged. Maksimovic and Titman (1991） suggest that customers tend to use multiple sources of information to help evaluate suppliers' reputations for fulfilling their implicit claims. If suppliers implement poor CSR management practices, they risk the sustainability of their supply chain along with their own reputation (Roberts 2003: Lindgreen et al. 2009). Accordingly, managers of suppliers have strong incentives to better perform with respect to CSR to lower the information asymmetry issues that might otherwise affect the customer-supplier relationship adversely (Cao et al. 2013). Good CSR engagement, therefore, is likely to reduce information asymmetry, and good CsR reputation acts as a protective mechanism for customers, ensuring sustainable customer-supplier relationship (Dhaliwal et al. 2013).  \n\nThird, a prospective employee will be more likely to sign a contract with a firm known for its good treatment of staff compared with an employer with an equivocal reputation. We posit that reputation building is particularly important in firms engaging in CSR activities, as they are prominent players in the labor market. Greening and Turban (2000), in particular, present an interesting signaling theory, which shows that a firm's CSR sends positive signals to prospective employees about what it would be like to work there. Because maintaining qualified personnel is crucial for firms with CSR programs to remain competitive, firms can hire competent employees through repetitive informational signaling via CSR, fostering a better information environment and decreasing information asymmetry for potential employees. In fact, employees are the first organizational liaisons that customers are faced with them (Gotsi and Wilson 2001). In other words, employees constitute central core of the information conveying that the corporation has established and are very important in the formation of hardcore information and firm reputation. Existing employees can further be viewed as corporate ambassadors who can affect firm reputation indirectly through word of mouth, reducing information asymmetry between the firm and outside financial market (Alsop 2004).  \n\nFourth, we consider the information role of creditors and associated financial market. Cheng et al. (2014) find that CSR engagement makes financial constraints less serious and access to financial markets easier. They argue that firms with better CSR performance face lower capital constraints. They attribute this negative relation between CSR performance and capital constraints to improved stakeholder engagement (Choi and Wang 2009; Jo and Harjoto 2011, 2012), which increases mutual trust and cooperation, and reduces potential informational opacity and agency costs by pushing managers to adopt a long-term rather than short-term orientation. If a firm develops a reputation for treating creditors poorly, then it will find its access to capital markets limited and loans expensive. Also, creditors will—and should—build covenants into debt agreements that constrain the actions that firms can take if those actions were to adversely affect the creditors. Bromley (2002) and Sandberg (2002) view firm reputation as a socially shared impression and consensus about how a firm will behave in any given situation. A firm's reputation is indeed dependent on observers’ collective informational judgments based on assessments of the financial, social, and environmental effects attributed to the corporation over time (Barnett et al. 2006). Thus, this dynamic information gathering and exchange will eventually decrease information asymmetry over time.  \n\nFifth, the government stance on corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting varies across the globe from a voluntary  initiative to  a mandatory requirement. Recently, government has assumed the role of an enabling and empowering facilitator of CSR—as opposed to a regulatory enforcer of rules (Steurer 2010; Vallentin and Murillo 2012; Vallentin 2015). While CSR reporting may not be mandatory in some jurisdictions, companies are under increasing pressure to demonstrate that they are responsible citizens. Company stakeholders are demanding corporate accountability  and transparencythrough straightforward CSR reporting.? In the U.S., President Obama has called on the federal government, the nation's largest consumer of energy, to set an example in increasing sustainability  and  energy efficiency.  President  Obama signed Executive Order 13514 in October 2009 requiring agencies to report and reduce greenhouse gas pollution. The federal government's sustainability goals and reporting requirements and recommendations may encourage companies to develop their own to enhance CSR disclosure transparency, yielding reduced information asymmetry.?  \n\nSixth, other parties, who are found to be more drawn to CSR-engaging firms, provide additional information that can improve the reputation of a firm (Shane and Spicer 1983; Ioannou and Serafeim 2014; Luo et al. 2014). Among the group of third parties that help expand information about firms, security analysts and the interactive role of analyst coverage and CSR are receiving increasing attention in this field of research. Dhaliwal et al. (2011, 2012) find that firms with higher CSR ratings attract dedicated analyst coverage. They also find that analysts have lower forecast errors and lower dispersion for firms with good CSR disclosure. CSR ratings are known to influence assessments of future financial performance (Ioannou and Serafeim 2014) and are factored into analysts’ recommendations (Luo et al. 2014), suggesting that analyst-produced information mediates the relationship between CSR and firm performance. In particular, as CSR activities are often uncertain and ambiguous to general investors, analysts may serve as the informational intermediary (Chung and Jo 1996) connecting CSR to stock returns. Other literature on third-party disclosure focuses on the relation between CSR and institutional ownership. Cho et al. (2013) find that the negative relation between CSR and bid-ask spread is less for firms with a high level of institutional investors than for those with a low level of institutional investors. This finding suggests that informed investors may exploit their CSR information advantage.  \n\nSeventh, there are also studies examining the role of CSR on media and credit rating agencies. Attig et al. (2014) argue that prolific Wall Street coverage of high CSR firms attracts greater investor and media attention, which increases the demand for information disclosure. Also, Attig et al. (2013) show that credit rating agencies tend to award relatively high ratings to high CSR firms. Their arguments and findings suggest that CSR reduces information asymmetry.  \n\nBased on the above explanation, a company perceived by its external stakeholders as having a good reputation will tend to produce a better information environment to keep and maintain their reputation capital (Jo et al. 2007). El Ghoul et al. (2011) also claim that information asymmetry is likely to be more severe for low CSR firms. Accordingly, we maintain that those firms conducting CSR activities are aiming to enhance their reputation, even though this is not a legal or regulatory requirement, in anticipation of a better information environment over time. If managers indeed use CSR engagement as a signaling channel (Fisman et al. 2008; Lys et al. 2015) to enhance communication with diverse stakeholders to build and maintain a good reputation, and if CSR activities are perceived by outsiders as an effective signal,4 then information asymmetry will be reduced.  \n\nTaken together, we address the actual channels that imply a link between CSR and information asymmetry: the managerial effort channel and the third-party disclosure channel, along with improved relationships with various stakeholders (employees, consumers, suppliers, creditors, regulators, the community, etc.), which makes the information environment more credible. Moreover, we claim that CSR reports tend to provide additional non-financial information to the financial markets and improve transparency and, therefore, should reduce information asymmetry between insiders and outsiders. We label this relation the reputation-building role of CSR and expect the following.  \n\nHypothesis 1  CSR engagement is negatively associated with the level of information asymmetry after controlling for confounding factors.  \n\n#### Bad CSR Information Disclosures  \n\nIn addition, firm reputation can be either good or bad. Because of certain events, a company can have a bad reputation (e.g., BP oil spill in the Gulf Coast) that also draws attention and being “known.’ In fact, there is strong evidence that managers more often disclose bad news than good news (Skinner 1994; Cao and Narayanamoorthy 2011). Skinner (1994) suggests that firms with bad performance disclose more in order to reduce expected legal costs. He also argues that managers may incur reputational costs if they fail to disclose bad news in a timely manner. Skinner (1994） further finds that bad news disclosures generate larger stock price reactions than good news disclosures and concludes that based on legal liability as well as reputation-effects argument, managers make preemptive bad news disclosures.  \n\nPatten (2002） and Clarkson et al.(2008） similarly maintain that poorly performing firms are looking to explain or contextualize their poor performance by disclosing more company information in order to restore the image of the firm. Patten (2002) specifically examines the relation between environmental disclosures for a sample of 131 US companies and their environmental performance based on toxics release data. His results indicate that there is a significant negative relation between performance and disclosure for the sample firms. However, the disclosure level of firms from non-environmentally sensitive industries is more affected by toxic release levels than is the disclosure of firms from environmentally sensitive industries.  \n\nSkinner (1994,1997) and Goel and Thakor (2003) further postulate that the avoidance of lawsuits and information production in order to smooth income may partially explain why firms disclose in general. In a similar vein, Skinner and Sloan (2002) and Graham et al. (2005) argue that managers use bad disclosures through pessimistic earnings guidance as a device not to fall short of analyst forecasts. Thus, possibly due to one or a few related reasons among expected legal costs, negative reputational effect, income smoothing, explaining poor performance, and meeting/beating analyst forecasts, firms choose to reveal bad CSR news to further reinstate or enhance their firm reputation.  \n\nWhile the above studies contribute to our understanding regarding the relation between the rationale behind bad news disclosure and firm reputation, there is relatively less empirical advancement in the previous literature regarding whether  media  coverage about unfortunate incidence actually reduces or increases information asymmetry. If more disclosures of CSR concerns such as oil spill receive more public attention, then we conjecture that bad CSR news disclosures improve information environment. In other words, firms with bad reputation disclose more company information in order to restore the image of the firm, thereby reducing information asymmetry.  \n\nOn the other hand, one might argue that the effect of bad news disclosures on information asymmetry can be greater in CSR concerns because corporate social irresponsibility (CSIR) activities increase differences in opinion of various stakeholders and further obscure information environment. Indeed, Herremans et al. (1993) and Mishra and Modi (2013) suggest that negative CSR disclosures increase idiosyncratic return volatility, while positive CSR disclosures reduce idiosyncratic risk. Under this scenario, we would expect CSR concern disclosures to increase information asymmetry. We consider that this relation between CSR concerns and information asymmetry is an open empirical question that we address in a later empirical section.  \n\n### CSR, Information Asymmetry, and Firm Risk  \n\nAs we expect CSR to have a significant negative effect on information asymmetry measures, it is also important to consider whether there are specific conditions that could amplify or lessen the expected CSR-information asymmetry relation. According to Cho et al. (2013), there is less of a negative relation between CSR and information asymmetry in firms with greater institutional ownership, suggesting that institutional investors are taking advantage of their informed positions. While the investor base influences a firm's CSR performance with respect to information asymmetry, there could be other aspects in operation between CSR and information asymmetry.  \n\nSpecifically, we seek to examine whether the expected CSR-information  asymmetry  relation  is enhanced by managerial efforts or third-party disclosures. If in a certain condition managerial efforts or third-party disclosures increase, the condition can be regarded as a possible indirect channel between CSR and information asymmetry. Among many candidates, we focus on cases where firms' return volatility, which reflects the total firm risk, is high, as managerial behavior differs between high-risk firms and low-risk firms (Halov and Heider 2011).  \n\nMany previous works suggest unanimously that a firm's engagement in CSR activities decreases firm risk (McGuire et al. 1988; Feldman et al. 1997; Orlitzky and Benjamin 2001; Godfrey 2005; Husted 2005; Godfrey et al. 2009; Salama et al. 2011; Jo and Na 2012; Oikonomou et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2014). With respect to the relation between risk and information asymmetry, previous studies argue that managers of high-risk firms may make more effort to redress information asymmetry. According to Diamond (1991) and Sufi (2007), reputation building is important for firms that are subject to intense monitoring and carry high risks. For such firms, it becomes important to provide additional better quality information. Likewise, Halov and Heider (2011) posit that firms where the risk is hard to define and measure may be reluctant to issue debts to avoid adverse selection. Managers of high-risk firms may avoid debt financing to diminish the information gap with outsiders, and may use other means to disseminate information, send good signals to the market, and retain a good reputation, for example, via CSR activities (Lys et al. 2015).  \n\nAs the extant literature suggests that firm risk is closely linked to both CSR activities and information asymmetry, we conjecture that CSR activities may negatively affect information asymmetry by first affecting firm risk. Our conjecture is that the managers of high-risk firms use CSR activities to try to provide more information and to avoid adverse selection. If so, we can state that it is the managerial effort channel through which firm risk enhances the CSR-information asymmetry relation. We postulate that firm risk acting together with CSR infuences information asymmetry.  \n\nHypothesis 2  Firm risk amplifies the negative relation between CSR activities and information asymmetry.  \n\n## Data and Variables  \n\n### CSR Variables  \n\nWe use an extensive and combined data set from the Kinder, Lydenberg, and Domini (KLD STATS) database spanning the period from 1991 to 2010. The KLD inclusive social rating criteria cover approximately 80 strength and concern ratings in seven major qualitative issue areas. We include five of these—community relations, workplace diversity, employee relations, environmental impact, and product quality and safety——and exclude corporate governance and human rights, and assign zero value for categories that were not yet created or were reassigned. We use KLD corporate governance (GOVIDX) as the measure of corporate governance control. Because ratings in the human rights area were mostly taken from the former NonU.S. Operations category, we do not include the human rights category in our CSR index computation.  \n\nThe KLD also has exclusionary screens relating to social issues, such as involvement with alcohol, gambling, the military, nuclear power, and tobacco. As the KLD's exclusionary screens differ from the inclusive screens in that only concern ratings but no strength ratings are assigned, we only use the inclusive screens in our main tests. Before 2001, the KLD contained data from approximately 650 firms listed on the S&P 500 or Domini 400 Social Indexes as of August each year. Thereafter, the KLD's ratings have been a summary of strengths and concerns assigned to approximately 1100 (3100) firms listed on the S&P 500, the Domini 400 Social Indexes, or the Russell 1000 (Russell 2000) Indexes as of December 31 each year. In 2002, the KLD renamed the other category Corporate Governance and reorganized the presentation of data in the Non-U.S. Operations and Community category.  \n\nThe sample from the KLD database is merged with the databases from Compustat and the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) for their financial information, stock prices, and volatility of monthly stock returns. After cross-referencing these databases and accounting for lags and changes in CSR and information asymmetry variables, the combined sample consists of approximately 15,700 firm-year observations from 1991 to 2010 (see Table 1). The actual samples used in the regression analyses are slightly different from the combined sample because data availability for the variables varies across different regression models. In our empirical analysis, all financial variables are taken from Compustat.  \n\nTable 9 lists the definitions and constructions of all variables used in this study. The KLD strength and concern criteria are assigned with zero or one value, and the number of measures varies across the years, so an index is used to aggregate the individual activities, which are rated under the above-mentioned five categories. Based on the ratings, we first construct a CSR index following Hillman and Keim (2001) and Baron et al. (2011). For each category, we let $C^{i j t}$ denote an indicator variable of CSR for firm $i$ with strength $j$ for year $t$ $C^{i k t}$ denotes an indicator variable of CSR for firm $i$ with concern $k$ for year $t$ ; and $C^{j t}$ and $C^{k t}$ denote the maximum number of KLD strengths and concerns, respectively, in year $t$ for any firm. The index $C^{i t}$ of each category for firm-year observation $i_{t}$ is  \n\n$$\nC^{i t}=\\frac{\\sum_{j}C^{i j t}-\\sum_{k}C^{i k t}+C^{K t}}{C^{J t}+C^{K t}}.\n$$  \n\nFinally, as a proxy for robustness checks, we take the arithmetic average of the indices for each category and obtain CSR composite (CSRIDX) (see the list of strength and concern items in the KLD database in Table 10).° To obtain robust results, we also take an alternative CSR composite (CSRNET). CSRNET is measured as the average of each category's simple difference between the combined scores of strengths and concerns.  \n\nTable 1 Descriptive statistics   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variables</td><td>N</td><td>Min</td><td>Mean</td><td>SD</td><td>Median</td><td>Max</td></tr><tr><td>AMIHUD</td><td>12,123</td><td>0.0000</td><td>0.0095</td><td>0.0322</td><td>0.0013</td><td>0.3502</td></tr><tr><td>DISP</td><td>11,925</td><td>0.0052</td><td>0.3058</td><td>1.8430</td><td>0.0370</td><td>18.7905</td></tr><tr><td>SPREAD</td><td>12,123</td><td>0.0003</td><td>0.0036</td><td>0.0048</td><td>0.0016</td><td>0.0268</td></tr><tr><td>CSRIDX</td><td>12,123</td><td>0.2610</td><td>0.4330</td><td>0.0450</td><td>0.4259</td><td>0.7112</td></tr><tr><td>CSRNET</td><td>12,123</td><td>-1.8000</td><td>-0.0089</td><td>0.4549</td><td>0.0000</td><td>3.2000</td></tr><tr><td>STRENGTH</td><td>11,882</td><td>-0.7111</td><td>0.0276</td><td>0.3947</td><td>-0.0759</td><td>3.9773</td></tr><tr><td>CONCERN</td><td>11,687</td><td>-2.3615</td><td>-0.0051</td><td>0.2970</td><td>0.0376</td><td>1.0000</td></tr><tr><td>GOVIDX</td><td>12,106</td><td>0.2727</td><td>0.5196</td><td>0.0604</td><td>0.5385</td><td>0.7273</td></tr><tr><td>RISK</td><td>12,123</td><td>0.0326</td><td>0.0988</td><td>0.0487</td><td>0.0867</td><td>0.3029</td></tr><tr><td>SIZE</td><td>12,123</td><td>3.7588</td><td>7.3275</td><td>1.5715</td><td>7.2660</td><td>12.0074</td></tr><tr><td>R&D</td><td>12,123</td><td>0.0000</td><td>0.0416</td><td>0.0836</td><td>0.0053</td><td>1.3728</td></tr><tr><td>TANGI</td><td>12,123</td><td>0.0827</td><td>0.4839</td><td>0.1576</td><td>0.4824</td><td>0.9097</td></tr><tr><td>CAPEX</td><td>12,123</td><td>-0.4564</td><td>0.0879</td><td>0.1014</td><td>0.0910</td><td>0.3264</td></tr><tr><td>ADVR</td><td>12,123</td><td>0.0000</td><td>0.0572</td><td>0.0547</td><td>0.0407</td><td>0.3030</td></tr><tr><td>FCF</td><td>12,123</td><td>0.0000</td><td>0.0115</td><td>0.0268</td><td>0.0000</td><td>0.1519</td></tr><tr><td>AGE</td><td>12,123</td><td>2.0000</td><td>23.9074</td><td>19.8571</td><td>17.0000</td><td>81.0000</td></tr><tr><td>NUMEST</td><td>12,123</td><td>1.0000</td><td>10.8962</td><td>7.5055</td><td>9.0000</td><td>47.0000</td></tr><tr><td>SPDUM</td><td>12,123</td><td>0.0000</td><td>0.3426</td><td>0.4746</td><td>0.0000</td><td>1.0000</td></tr><tr><td>LOGPRC</td><td>12,123</td><td>0.7014</td><td>3.1980</td><td>0.7543</td><td>3.3069</td><td>4.6520</td></tr><tr><td>LOGTRVOL</td><td>12,123</td><td>12.2586</td><td>16.5013</td><td>1.6306</td><td>16.4884</td><td>20.2717</td></tr><tr><td>RepRisk(/1000)</td><td>3240</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.004</td><td>0.008</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.062</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nThis table displays descriptive statistics of all variables for maximum 12,123 firm-year observations from 1991 to 2010.

Our first information asymmetry measure is dispersion of analysts’ forecasts (DISP), which measures differences in investor opinions (Lang and Lundholm 1996; Diether et al. 2002; Li and Zhao 2008). Our second measure is the price impact measure (AMIHUD) following Amihud (2002) and Goyenko et al. (2009), which proxies for illiquidity in the stock market. We also run the test with the bid-ask spread (SPREAD) as a robustness check. All of our information asymmetry proxies are winsorized at the 1 percent and 99 percent levels.  \n\n#### Dispersion of Analysts’Forecasts: Difference in Investor Opinions  \n\nNext, to mitigate unexpected potential mismatch problems with information asymmetry construction, we employ an additional variable known to proxy for information asymmetry in the previous literature. Analysts’ disagreements on a company's future earnings can be a relevant proxy for the extent of asymmetric beliefs and opinions among investors (Lang and Lundholm 1996; Diether et al. 2002; Li and Zhao 2008). Therefore, following Diether et al. (2002), we take the annual average of the monthly dispersion of analysts’ forecasts (DISP) to proxy for analyst' disagreements. For each month, the monthly analyst dispersion is measured as the standard deviation of analysts' current-year forecasts of earnings per share (EPS) available up to the given month, scaled by the absolute value of the meanforecast.Wetakethe relevant variablesfromthe Unadjusted Summary File of the Institutional Brokers Estimate System (I/B/E/S). We use the unadjusted file because it is known that the standard deviation computed from the adjusted file is affected by the rounding error issue (Diether et al. 2002; Payne and Thomas 2003).  \n\n#### PriceImpact Measure:TransactionCostsintheMarket  \n\nWe adopt a variable known to proxy illiquidity in the stock market, i.e., the price impact measure (AMIHUD), following Amihud (2002) and Goyenko et al. (2009). If CSR activities do reduce information asymmetry between a firm's insiders and outside investors, they, in turn, are likely to trigger a decrease in asymmetry among market participants and their transaction costs, or illiquidity (Chung et al. 2010). Our illiquidity assessment, AMIHUD, is measured with low-frequency (daily) stock data, but is found to best measure price impact.′ AMIHUD is defined as “daily price response associated with one dollar of trading volume,” or $\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathrm{AMIHUD}=\\frac{|\\mathrm{ret}_{\\mathrm{t}}|}{\\mathrm{gvolume}_{\\mathrm{t}}}}\\end{array}$  \n\n#### Control Variables  \n\nOur choice of control variables generally follows Gompers et al. (2003), Cai et al. (2009), and Jo and Harjoto (2011, 2012). Past research shows that the level of information asymmetry is associated with factors such as performance, risk, size, R&D, and advertising. Accordingly, we include various firms’ financial characteristics including advertising expense ratio (ADVR), capital expenditure ratio (CAPEX), free cash flow (FCF), R&D expenditures divided by sales revenue (R&D), and firm size measured by the natural log of total assets (SIZE). We also control for asset tangibility (TANGI), which is calculated as [ $(0.715\\times\\mathrm{RECEIVA}.$ $\\mathrm{BLES}+0.547\\times\\mathrm{INVENTORY}+0.535\\times\\mathrm{CAPITAL})+$ CASH]/ASSETS (Berger et al. 1996; Almeida and Campello 2007; Chung et al. 2010). In addition, our control variables include the firm's age (AGE), a dummy for being a member of the S&P 500 Index (SPDUM), the number of analysts following (NUMEST), and the logarithms of price (LOGPRC) and dollar-amount trading volume (LOGTRVOL). A firm's stock price and dollar-amount trading volume, in particular, are known to correlate highly with its illiquidity level (Stoll 2000; Chung et al. 2010).  \n\nCai et al. (2009) and Chung et al. (2010) show that information asymmetry is closely related to corporate governance. Therefore, along various specifications, we include corporate governance using the index based on the KLD's corporate governance category (GOVIDX) in our control variable set.  \n\nFirm risk is among our control variables, which we measure by a firm's total risk from the volatility (standard deviation) of the previous year's monthly stock returns (RISK). Also, for robustness checks, we include the Reputation Risk Index (RepRisk), Index provided by RepRisk AG, which proxies reputation risk (see the variable definitions in Table 9). All of our control variables are winsorized at the 1 percent and 99 percent levels.  \n\n#### Descriptive Statistics  \n\nIn Table 1, we present the means and medians of the main and control variables. The mean of CSRIDX is 0.4330, while that of CSRNET is -0.0089, which indicates that the firms in our sample have lower CSR strength scores than concern scores in the period from 1991 to 2010. The average of DISP is 0.3058 and the average of AMIHUD is 0.0095, while the average of daily bid-ask spread is 0.0036. Also, the average volatility of monthly stock returns during the past year, RISK, is 0.0988. The mean dollar-amount trading volume is 16.50. The averages of the firms’ financial characteristics and other control variables reported in Table 1 are comparable with those of the samples in Stoll (2000), Chung et al.(2010), Baron et al. (2011), Dhaliwal et al. (2011), Jo and Harjoto (2012), and Ioannou and Serafeim (2014).  \n\nTable 2 presents the Spearman correlation matrix for the variables discussed in the previous section. Consistent with the expected negative association between CSR engagement status (CSRIDX) and information asymmetry proxies, the Spearman correlation coefficient between CSRIDX (CSRNET) and AMIHUD is negative, $-0.0640(-0.0524)$ respectively. The Spearman correlation coefficient between CSRIDX (CSRNET) and DISP is negative and significant, $-0.0369$ (-0.0322), respectively. All of the above correlations are statistically significant, at least at the 5 percent level. However, the correlation coefficients should be interpreted with caution because they do not control for other firm characteristics in the cross section. To further examine the multivariate effect of other control variables on the CSR-information asymmetry association, we run multivariate regressions in the following section.  \n\n## Empirical Results  \n\n### Main Analysis: Multivariate Fixed-Effects Regression Results  \n\nTo gain insights into the relation between CSR and information asymmetry and obtain baseline results, we run fixed-effects regressions, which examine the empirical association between CSR and information asymmetry. Because we use cross-sectional and time-series combined panel data, we employ fixed-effects regressions to account for fixed effects within each firm in the sample and to impose time independent effects for each variable, which are possibly correlated with the regressors. A fixed-effects model is typically used when the observed quantities in terms of explanatory variables are treated as non-random. In our regression model, our dependent variable, information asymmetry (INFOASY), is proxied by analyst dispersion (DISP) and price impact measure (AMIHUD) for the same set of empirical tests. Our variable of interest is measured by lagged CSRIDX.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathrm{INFOASY}_{i,t}=\\displaystyle\\alpha_{0}+\\alpha_{1}\\mathrm{CSRIDX}_{i,t-1}}\\

The dependent variable is Amihud's (2002) Price Impact Measure (AMIHUD) in columns (1)-(2) and Monthly Analyst Dispersions (DISP) in (3)-(4). The variable of interest is CSRIDX. Heteroskedasticity-adjusted $p$ values are presented in square brackets. The definitions of variables are provided in Table 9 \\*\\*\\*， $^{**}$ , and \\* indicate statistical significance at the 1, 5, and $10\\%$ levels,respectively  \n\nAMIHUD, the coefficient estimate on CSRIDX $(\\hat{\\alpha}_{1})$ is $-0.0197$ $\\boldsymbol{p}$ value $=0.054,$ or $-0.0194$ $\\overset{\\cdot}{p}$ value $=0.059$ depending on the specification. If DISP is our dependent variable, $(\\hat{\\alpha}_{1})$ on CSRIDX is $-1.5059\\$ $\\overset{\\cdot}{p}$ value $=0.009,$ or $-1.4938$ $\\mathbf{\\rho}_{p}$ value $=0.012,$  \n\nIn terms of economic significance, the effects of CSRIDX on both AMIHUD and DISP are economically significant. For instance, based on Models (1) and (2) of  \n\nTable 3, a one-standard deviation increase in CSRIDX is associated with a decrease in AMIHUD by $2.75\\%$ and $2.71\\%$ of its unconditional mean, respectively. Similarly, based on Models (3) and (4), a one-standard deviation increase in CSRIDX would decrease DISP by $3.68\\%$ and $3.516\\%$ of its mean, respectively. It is noteworthy that CSRIDX is associated with a lower DISP and AMIHUD, in terms of both statistical and economic significance, even after considering the difference in magnitude between the two dependent variables. Overall, this significantly negative relation between CSRIDX and information asymmetry (INFOASY) is generally consistent with our Hypothesis 1.  \n\nWith respect to the control variables, the results are mostly consistent with the previous literature. The coefficients on the logarithm of price are negative at least at the 1 percent level and those on the logarithm of trading volume are consistently negative, which supports Stoll's (2000) findings. Note that the corporate governance index (GOVIDX) is also negatively associated with both of our information asymmetry proxies, as previous research argues (Chung et al. 2010). However, the significance disappears as we include the CSR index, which can perhaps be attributed to the difference in proxies.  \n\nThe signs of the coefficients on the number of analysts, firm age, asset tangibility, and the dummy of the S&P 500 Index are also comparable to the findings of Chung et al. (2010). The coefficients on the control variables that are known to be closely linked to CSR, such as R&D expense, capital expenditure ratio, advertising expense, and free cash flow, show inconsistent signs, suggesting that those have different associations with our two information asymmetry proxies.  \n\nWith respect to firm risk, we find a positive association between information asymmetry and RISK, significant at least at the 10 percent level, which also is predicted by Stoll (2000), Chung et al. (2010), and Cho et al. (2013). In particular, if the dependent variable is AMIHUD, the significance level soars, with the coefficient estimate on RISK standing at 0.0819 or 0.0820.  \n\n### Simultaneity and Endogeneity Controls  \n\nIn this section, we conduct tests to address endogeneity concerns due to simultaneity, reverse causality, and omitted variables. We use the two-stage least squares method (2SLS) and the dynamic panel system generalized method of moments (GMM) model to alleviate the concern that the negative relation between CSR and information asymmetry is determined simultaneously by some omitted variables.  \n\n#### Two-stage Least Square (2SLS) Regressions  \n\nPrevious studies on CSR (Jo and Harjoto 2011, 2012; Ioannou and Serafeim 2014) suggest that a firm's CSR engagement is an endogenous variable. We share a similar concern that the decision of a corporation to invest in CSR is endogenous; if so, the CSR variable will be correlated with the disturbance term, hence making the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates biased and inconsistent. To alleviate the endogeneity concerns driven by simultaneity and reverse causality, we use the instrumental variable (IV)  \n\napproach to examine the effect of CSR on information asymmetry. We employ a two-stage least squares analysis (2SLS) as follows.  \n\nFirst-stage  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{\\mathrm{CSRIDX}_{i,t-1}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}\\varDelta\\mathrm{CSRIDX}_{i,t-2}+\\beta_{2}\\varDelta\\mathrm{CSRIDX}_{i,t-3}}}\\ {{\\mathrm{~}+\\beta_{3}I N D U S T R Y\\_M E D I A N\\_C\\mathrm{SRIDX}_{i,t-1}}}\\ {{\\mathrm{~}+\\displaystyle\\sum_{\\mathrm{j=4}}^{n}\\beta_{j}\\mathrm{CONTROL}_{i,t-1}+\\varepsilon_{i,t-1}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nSecond-stage  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathrm{INFOASY}_{i,t}=\\gamma_{0}+\\gamma_{1}\\mathrm{CS}\\widehat{\\mathrm{RID}}\\mathrm{X}_{i,t-1}}\\ {+\\displaystyle\\sum_{\\mathrm{j}=2}^{n}\\gamma_{j}\\mathrm{CONTROL}_{i,t-1}+\\mu_{i,t}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIn the first stage, we regress CSRIDX on multiple instrumental variables, such as the lagged industry-median CSRIDX, two- and three-period-lagged CSRIDX differentials. In the second stage, we use the predicted values estimated from the first stage and run regressions. We perform the first-stage F test to validate our choice of instrumental variables. We expect to find a high correlation between CSRIDX and three instrumental variables. Specifically, we use the industry-median CSR as one of the instrumental variables because it is likely to fulfill both the relevancy condition and the exclusion restriction. Prior research suggests that the level of CSR may vary considerably across industries due to the nature of the products produced, regulatory environment, shifts in social norms, or certain problems arose in a social arena (e.g., Waddock and Graves 1997; McWilliams and Siegel 2001; Fisman et al. 2008). Therefore, we expect firm-level CSR to be closely related to its industry norm, as captured by its industry-median CSR. At the same time, it is not obvious why the industry-median CSR should be linked to the information asymmetry level of the firm.  \n\nWe report the 2SLS regression results in Table 4. For completeness, we report both first-stage and second-stage results. As anticipated, our first-stage results of firm-level CSR regressions reported in Table 4 suggest that the coefficients on industry-median CSR value are statistically significant at the one percent level. In contrast, our unreported results suggest that there is no statistically significant correlation between three instrumental variables and information asymmetry measures. In the second-stage models, we find that the negative effect of the predicted CSRIDX on information asymmetry, either measured by AMIHUD or DISP, is robust at least at the 10 percent level. The coefficient estimate on predicted CSRIDX $(\\hat{\\gamma}_{1})$ is $-0.0650$ and $-0.0633$ $\\boldsymbol{\\Tilde{p}}$ value $=0.030$ and0.041, respectively) and $-1.6147$ and $-1.6600$ $\\overset{\\cdot}{p}$ value $=0.062$ and 0.064, respectively) if the dependent variables are AMIHUD and DISP, respectively.  \n\nTable 4 Impact of lagged CSR index (CSRIDX) on Amihud's (2002) Price

The dependent variable is Amihud's (2002) Price Impact Measure (AMIHUD) in columns (1)-(2) and Monthly Analyst Dispersions (DISP) in (3)-(4). The variable of interest is CSRIDX. In the first stage, we regress CSRIDX on multiple instrumental variables, such as lagged industry-median CSRIDX, two- and three-period-lagged CSRIDX differentials (△CSRIDX). Heteroskedasticity-adjusted $p$ values are presented in square brackets. The definitions of variables are provided inTable9 \\*\\*\\*, \\*\\*, and \\* indicate statistical significance at the 1, 5, and $10\\%$ levels, respectively  \n\nUsing 2SLS, the economic significances of instrumented CSRIDX on both AMIHUD and DISP are non-trivial and economically more significant. A one-standard deviation increase in predicted (instrumented) CSRIDX would decrease AMIHUD by $9.08~\\%$ or $8.85\\%$ of its unconditional mean, while a one-standard deviation increase in predicted (instrumented) CSRIDX would decrease DISP by $3.94\\%$ or $4.05\\%$ of its mean.The Hansen $J$ statistic results in a $p$ value of 0.524-0.929, suggesting that our instruments are reasonably valid.  \n\nMost of the control variable coefficients are consistent with those shown in Table 3, but the coefficient on GOVIDX is found to have the opposite sign, although it is insignificant. However, RISK is again significantly positive, as predicted by the previous literature.  \n\n#### GMM System Dynamic Model  \n\nTo further alleviate the endogeneity issue, following Blundell and Bond (1998) and Wintoki et al. (2012), we employ a well-developed dynamic panel system generalized method of moment (GMM) estimator to the determinants of information asymmetry, and compare the results to those obtained from traditional fixed-effects estimates. The dynamic panel system GMM model enables us to estimate the CSR-information asymmetry relation while including both past information asymmetry and fixed effects to account for the dynamic aspects of the CSR-asymmetry relation and timeinvariant unobservable heterogeneity, respectively.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{{\\mathrm{INFOASY}_{i,t}}=}&{\\lambda_{0}+\\lambda_{1}\\mathrm{CSRIDX}_{i,t}}\\ &{\\hphantom{\\lambda_{0}+}+\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=2}^{n}\\lambda_{j}\\mathrm{CONTROLVARIABLES}_{i,t}}\\ &{\\hphantom{\\lambda_{0}+}+\\kappa_{1}\\mathrm{INFOASY}_{i t-1}+\\kappa_{2}\\mathrm{INFOASY}_{i t-2}+\\eta_{i}}\\ &{\\hphantom{\\lambda_{0}+}+\\varepsilon_{i,t}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nTable 5 presents the regression results of the dynamic panel system GMM using information asymmetry measures and CSR. Similar to the significant and negative association between measures of CSR and information asymmetry as in fixed-effect and 2SLS regressions, the relation between CSR and INFOASY remains significantly negative. The results show that when we include fixed effects in a dynamic model and estimate via system GMM, the coefficients on CSRIDX $(\\hat{\\lambda}_{1})$ are  still negative  and significant, ranging from $-0.0749$ $\\boldsymbol{p}$ value $=0.040^{}$ ）to -3.5908( $\\mathbf{\\rho}_{p}$ value $=0.027$ 0.8  \n\nThe AR(1) and AR(2) tests for first-order and secondorder serial correlation in the first-differenced residuals suggest that under the null hypothesis of no serial correlation, as AR(1) is serially correlated, but AR(2) is uncorrelated. The Hansen test of over-identifying restrictions indicates that our instrumental variables are valid, i.e., they are uncorrelated with the error terms. Overall, our dynamic system GMM results generally support our hypothesis.  \n\n#### Interactive Effect of CSR and Firm Risk on Information Asymmetry  \n\nTo test how firm risk affects the path from CsR to information asymmetry, we run a set of fixed-effects regressions of our information asymmetry measures, including an interaction term to proxy for the interactive effect.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{{\\mathrm{INFOASY}_{i,t}}={\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{0}+{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{1}{\\mathrm{CSRIDX}}_{i,t-1}+{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{2}{\\mathrm{RISK}}_{i,t-1}}&{}\\ {+\\theta_{3}{\\mathrm{CSRIDX}}_{i,t-1}*{\\mathrm{RISK}}_{i,t-1}}&{}\\ {+\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=4}^{n}\\theta_{j}{\\mathrm{CONTROL~VARIABLES}}_{i,t-1}+{\\boldsymbol{v}}_{i}}&{}\\ {+\\varepsilon_{i,t}}&{}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nTable 6 shows the regression results of the fixed-effects regression of the level of information asymmetry on the lag of CSRIDX, firm risk (RISK), and the interaction term between the two variables (CSRIDX\\*RISK). According to our analysis, the effect of the interaction term throughout various specifications is consistently negative, significant at the 1 percent and 5 percent levels, respectively. If information asymmetry is proxied by AMIHUD, the coefficient estimate on the interaction of CSRIDX and RISK $(\\hat{\\theta}_{3})$ .s $-0.0076(p\\mathrm{value}=0.000)$ The results are qualitatively unchanged if we use DISP as our information asymmetry proxy. The coeffcient estimates on CSRIDX\\*RISK become $-0.2507$ $(p$ value $=0.088\\$ ）or $-0.2501$ $\\overset{\\cdot}{p}$ value $=0.089.$ ),respectively.  \n\nThe coefficient estimates on both CSRIDX and CSRIDX\\*RISK are negative, suggesting that the interaction of firm risk and CSR activities, or CSR activities of high-risk firms, leads to a greater reduction in information asymmetry. In other words, firm risk plays a negative mediating role between CSR and information asymmetry. Therefore, we maintain that high-risk firms tend to make more effort to disseminate trustworthy information to outside investors and to decrease insider-outsider information asymmetry by engaging in CSR activities.  \n\nTable 5 Impact of lagged CSR index (CSRIDX) on Amihud's (2002) Price Impact Measure (AMIHUD) and Monthly Analyst Dispersions (DISP) Dynamic GMM   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"4\">(1) (2)</td></tr><tr><td>AMIHUD</td><td>AMIHUD</td><td>(3) DISP</td><td>(4) DISP</td></tr><tr><td>Variables CSRIDX</td><td>-0.0834**</td><td>-0.0749**</td><td>-3.5908**</td><td>-3.4421**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[0.015]</td><td>[0.040]</td><td>[0.027]</td><td>[0.040]</td></tr><tr><td>Controlvariables</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>RISK</td><td>0.1097***</td><td>0.1077***</td><td>2.8691**</td><td>3.2374**</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">GOVIDX</td><td>[0.001]</td><td>[0.002]</td><td>[0.024]</td><td>[0.014]</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-0.0327</td><td></td><td>-4.9468</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>[0.882]</td><td></td><td>[0.486]</td></tr><tr><td>SIZE</td><td>-0.0080</td><td>-0.0070</td><td>0.1131</td><td>0.0236</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[0.169]</td><td>[0.314]</td><td>[0.449]</td><td>[0.902]</td></tr><tr><td>RNDR</td><td>0.0279</td><td>0.0323</td><td>0.6716</td><td>0.5759</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[0.334]</td><td>[0.306]</td><td>[0.432]</td><td>[0.510]</td></tr><tr><td>TANGI</td><td>0.0224*</td><td>0.0250*</td><td>0.3347</td><td>0.2716</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[0.056]</td><td>[0.083]</td><td>[0.504]</td><td>[0.600]</td></tr><tr><td>FCF</td><td>0.0939**</td><td>0.0851*</td><td>3.9451*</td><td>3.9134*</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[0.023]</td><td>[0.062]</td><td>[0.065]</td><td>[0.073]</td></tr><tr><td>CAPEX</td><td>0.0721</td><td>0.0534</td><td>-4.0742***</td><td>-4.3767***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[0.327]</td><td>[0.649]</td><td>[0.002]</td><td>[0.002]</td></tr><tr><td>ADVR</td><td>-0.1610</td><td>-0.0413</td><td>27.4235</td><td>28.6867</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[0.816]</td><td>[0.958]</td><td>[0.145]</td><td>[0.142]</td></tr><tr><td>AGE</td><td>0.0005</td><td>0.0003</td><td>0.0046</td><td>0.0029</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[0.254]</td><td>[0.460]</td><td>[0.717]</td><td>[0.831]</td></tr><tr><td>NUMEST</td><td>0.0001</td><td>-0.0002</td><td>-0.0045</td><td>-0.0130</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[0.913]</td><td>[0.898]</td><td>[0.714]</td><td>[0.420]</td></tr><tr><td>SPDUM</td><td>0.0198</td><td>0.0216</td><td>-0.4503</td><td>-0.3890</td></tr><tr><td>LOGPRC</td><td>[0.201]</td><td>[0.218]</td><td>[0.219]</td><td>[0.325]</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-0.0160***</td><td>-0.0146***</td><td>-0.9105***</td><td>-0.9003***</td></tr><tr><td>LOGTRVOL</td><td>[0.000]</td><td>[0.005]</td><td>[0.000]</td><td>[0.000]</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-0.0037</td><td>-0.0039</td><td>0.1441</td><td>0.1687</td></tr><tr><td>AMIHUD(t - 1) or DISP(t - 1)</td><td>[0.125]</td><td>[0.188]</td><td>[0.217]</td><td>[0.169]</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.2059</td><td>0.1574</td><td>-0.3451***</td><td>-0.3644***</td></tr><tr><td>AMIHUD(t - 2) or DISP(t - 2)</td><td>[0.231]</td><td>[0.367]</td><td>[0.001]</td><td>[0.001]</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-0.9263***</td><td>-0.8332** [0.012]</td><td>-0.0465</td><td>-0.0486</td></tr><tr><td>Constant</td><td>[0.002] 0.1606***</td><td>0.1707</td><td>[0.696] 0.2599</td><td>[0.694] 2.9711</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[0.000]</td><td>[0.160]</td><td>[0.887]</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>[0.522]</td></tr><tr><td>Number of firms</td><td>8168</td><td>8162</td><td>8006</td><td>8000</td></tr><tr><td>AR(1) test (p value)</td><td>1625</td><td>1625</td><td>1591</td><td>1591</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.071</td><td>0.073</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.000</td></tr><tr><td>AR(2) test (p value)</td><td>0.326</td><td>0.415</td><td>0.346</td><td>0.320</td></tr><tr><td>Sargan test over-identification (p value)</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.095</td><td>0.093</td></tr><tr><td>Hansen test over-identification (p value)</td><td>0.228</td><td>0.232</td><td>0.804</td><td>0.818</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table displays dynamic panel system GMM regressions for the sample over the period of 1991-2010.

In other words, does active CSR beneficial activity reduce information asymmetry or do companies' active efforts to reduce CSR concerns reduce or increase information asymmetry? To shed light on the relative importance of CSR strength versus CSR concern on information asymmetry dimension, we disaggregate the strength and concern components separately and test each in the baseline model. For these regressions, we multiply minus one to CSR concern items to capture the effect of less CSR concerns. The test results are shown in Table 7 and provide evidence that both CSR strengths and CSR concerns affect information asymmetry. More specifically, we find that more CSR strengths and less CSR concerns both help reduce information asymmetry at least at the ten percent level. Because KLD's qualitative indicators include both positive (strengths) and negative (concerns) ratings, we consider high CSR concern scores analogous to more disclosures of bad CSR news similar to the assumptions used in Dhaliwal et al. (2011, 2012). To the extent that high CSR concern scores overlap more disclosures of bad news, our findings indicate that firms should invest effort in both strengthening positive CSR engagement and avoiding CSR concerns if the management aim is better information transparency through CSR efforts. This separate treatment of CSR strengths and concerns generally follows Mattingly and Berman (2006), who demonstrate that a firm's social strengths and the track-record of its respective social controversies are issues that are both conceptually and empirically distinct, and thus should be dealt separately for research purposes.  \n\nTable 7 Impact of strength or concern component of Corporate Social Responsibility on Amihud's (2002) Price Impact Measure (AMIHUD) and Monthly Analyst Dispersions (DISP)Fixed Effects   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Variables (1) (2)</td><td colspan=\"2\">(3) (4)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>AMIHUD</td><td>DISP</td><td>AMIHUD</td><td>DISP</td></tr><tr><td>STRENGTH</td><td>-0.0020* [0.069]</td><td>-0.0376* [0.067]</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">CONCERN</td><td></td><td>-0.0518*</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"></td><td>-0.0023** [0.045]</td><td>[0.081]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Control variables</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">RISK 0.0732***</td><td>0.0736***</td><td>0.8773***</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">[0.000]</td><td>[0.000]</td><td>[0.003]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">GOVIDX -0.0008</td><td>-0.0013</td><td>-0.0731</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">[0.847]</td><td>[0.760]</td><td>[0.531]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">0.0007</td><td>0.0006</td><td>-0.0149</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">[0.450]</td><td>[0.493]</td><td>[0.505]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">[0.551] 0.0560*** -0.3469</td><td>0.0563***</td><td>-0.3415</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">[0.006] [0.192]</td><td>[0.006]</td><td>[0.199]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">0.0074**</td><td>0.0072*</td><td>-0.0351</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">[0.049]</td><td>[0.054]</td><td>[0.705]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">-0.0093*</td><td>-0.0092*</td><td>-0.3006**</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">[0.061]</td><td>[0.064]</td><td>[0.019]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">CAPEX 0.0063</td><td>0.0063</td><td>0.2430</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">[0.521]</td><td>[0.520]</td><td>[0.271]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">ADVR 0.0259</td><td>0.0284</td><td>-0.2689</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">[0.201]</td><td>[0.165]</td><td>[0.670]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">AGE -0.0002</td><td>-0.0002</td><td>0.0037</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">[0.887]</td><td>[0.842]</td><td>[0.332]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">NUMEST 0.0001**</td><td>0.0002***</td><td>0.0023</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">[0.013]</td><td>[0.005]</td><td>[0.176]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">SPDUM 0.0062***</td><td>0.0060***</td><td>0.0016</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">[0.000]</td><td>[0.000]</td><td>[0.969]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">LOGPRC -0.0015</td><td>-0.0012</td><td>-0.2427***</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">[0.248]</td><td>[0.322]</td><td>[0.000]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">LOGTRVOL -0.0136***</td><td>-0.0137***</td><td>-0.0130</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">[0.000]</td><td>[0.000]</td><td>[0.459]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Constant 0.2305***</td><td>0.2329***</td><td>1.1553***</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"></td><td>[0.000]</td><td>[0.000]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">[0.000]</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Year dummy Yes</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Observations 11,882</td><td>11,882</td><td>11,687</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Number of firms 2136</td><td>2136</td><td>2095</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Adj.

According to the reputational risk (RepRisk) website (http://www.reprisk.com/methodology/ reprisk-index/), RepRisk systematically collects and analyzes negative incidents, criticism, and controversies about companies and projects worldwide, and offers information on activities related to human rights violations, poor working conditions, corruption, and environmental destruction. RepRisk uses a unique methodology, which is quite different from that used by other ESG data providers, research and rating agencies, or media monitoring services. The RepRisk Index (RRI) is a quantitative risk measure that captures criticism according to the input by RepRisk analysts and quantifies a company or project's exposure to controversial ESG issues. While it does not measure a company or project's overall reputation, RRI is rather an indicator of their reputational risk. This facilitates an initial assessment of the risks associated with investments or business relationships, allows the comparison of a company's exposure with that of its peers, and helps track risk trends over time. The RepRisk Index ranges from zero (lowest) to 100 (highest). The calculation is based on the influence of information sources, the frequency and timing of the information, as well as the content, including the severity (harshness) and novelty (newness) of the issues addressed.  \n\nTable 8 displays OLS regressions with two stages for the sample 0ver the period of 2007-2010. Notice that RepRisk database is available only from 2007 and for consistency with our sample period, we choose 2007-2010 time period. The first-stage dependent variable is RepRisk, standardized by  \n\n1,000, and the second-stage dependent variables are one-year averages of daily bid-ask spreads, Amihud's (2002) Price Impact Measure (AMIHUD), and Monthly Analyst Dispersions (DISP) in columns (2)-(4), respectively. The variable of interest is CSRIDX in the first stage and the predicted RepRisk in the second stage. We empirically show that CSR is inversely associated with RepRisk in the first stage, and then show in the second-stage regressions that our measures of information asymmetry are positively associated with the predicted values of RepRisk obtained from the first stage, suggesting that the larger (lower) the reputational risk, the larger (lower) the information asymmetry. This evidence indirectly suggests that CSR engagement is beneficial in reputation building by reducing reputational risk, and reducing reputational risk is helpful in reducing information asymmetry.  \n\n#### CSRNET as a Proxy for CSR Activities  \n\nIn this section, we try to provide additional evidence that supports our argument by employing a different measure of the CSRNET scores, that is, the difference between CSR strength and concern scores. We re-run our baseline fixedeffects regression with an alternative proxy of CSRNET. Our untabulated results remain qualitatively similar to our baseline fixed-effects regression results. When the regressand is AMIHUD,the coefficientestimate on CSRNET is $-0.0021$ , at the 5 percent significance level. If the dependent variable is DISP, the coefficient estimate becomes $-0.1525$ or $-0.1526$ , significant at least at the 1 percent level. As in Table 3, the signs on RISK, GOVIDX, and LOGPRC are consistent with the previous literature. Overall, we suggest that the inverse association between CSR activities and information asymmetry remains robust with a different CSR proxy.  \n\n#### SPREAD as a Proxy for Information Asymmetry  \n\nAs an alternative proxy of information asymmetry measure, we employ the daily-level bid-ask spread that measures information asymmetry between investors. Our unreported results, using the daily-level bid-ask spread (SPREAD) based on the dynamic system GMM, remain qualitatively similar to our other dynamic system GMM regression results. Specifically, the coefficients on both CSRIDX and CSRNET are all negative and significant at less than 5 percent significance level.  \n\n## Discussion and Conclusion  \n\nIn spite of the important roles of information asymmetry and corporate social responsibility, there is only limited empirical evidence on the simultaneous and endogenous relation between information asymmetry and CSR. Employing a comprehensive sample of U.s. firms that engaged in CSR during the 1991-2010 period, we find that different measures of CSR index have a negative effect on the measures of information asymmetry. In particular, using the fixed effect method, 2SLS approach, and dynamic panel system GMM approach, we find that CSR significantly reduces information asymmetry even after considering potential simultaneity and endogeneity bias. We also find that high-risk firms lead to a greater reduction in information asymmetry. Furthermore, our evidence suggests that both positive CSR strengths’ enhancement and avoidance of CsR concerns are inversely associated with information asymmetry. We thus conclude that CSR reduces information asymmetry to a certain extent. We believe the information asymmetry-reducing role of CSR disclosures to have valuable implications for risk management in firms using CSR initiatives.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Variables</td><td rowspan=\"2\">1st Stage 2nd Stage</td><td colspan=\"3\"></td></tr><tr><td>SPREAD</td><td>AMIHUD</td><td>DISP</td></tr><tr><td>CSRIDX</td><td>RepRisk (/1000) -0.0072*</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>[0.069]</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">SIZE</td><td>0.0025***</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>[0.000]</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>RNDR</td><td>-0.0053**</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">TANGI</td><td>[0.012]</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0.0088***</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>FCF</td><td>[0.000]</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td>0.0012</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>[0.369]</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CAPEXA</td><td>-0.0056**</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>ADVR</td><td>[0.012] 0.0227***</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[0.000]</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>PRED_RepRisk</td><td></td><td>0.0304***</td><td>0.6563**</td><td>28.8847*</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">DEVRET</td><td></td><td>[0.001]</td><td>[0.026]</td><td>[0.084]</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.0054***</td><td>0.0848***</td><td>1.5881</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>[0.000]</td><td>[0.000]</td><td>[0.185]</td></tr><tr><td>NUMEST</td><td></td><td>0.0000***</td><td>0.0006***</td><td>-0.0051</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>[0.000]</td><td>[0.000]</td><td>[0.514]</td></tr><tr><td>LOGPRC</td><td></td><td>-0.0006***</td><td>-0.0042***</td><td>-0.3387***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>[0.000]</td><td>[0.000]</td><td>[0.000]</td></tr><tr><td>LOGTRVOL</td><td></td><td>-0.0005***</td><td>-0.0117***</td><td>0.0100</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>[0.000]</td><td>[0.000]</td><td>[0.874]</td></tr><tr><td>AGE</td><td>0.0001***</td><td>-0.0000</td><td>-0.0000</td><td>-0.0021</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[0.000]</td><td>[0.133]</td><td>[0.467]</td><td>[0.251]</td></tr><tr><td>SPDUMMY</td><td>0.0019***</td><td>0.0005***</td><td>0.0135***</td><td>-0.1542*</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[0.000]</td><td>[0.000]</td><td>[0.000]</td><td>[0.071]</td></tr><tr><td>CONSTANT</td><td>-0.0166***</td><td>0.0109***</td><td>0.1945***</td><td>1.2091</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[0.000]</td><td>[0.000]</td><td>[0.000]</td><td>[0.218]</td></tr><tr><td>Year dummy</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>3,430</td><td>3,430</td><td>3,430</td><td>3,394</td></tr><tr><td>R2</td><td>0.3073</td><td>0.5142</td><td>0.3372</td><td>0.0508</td></tr><tr><td>Adj.

The first-stage dependent variable is RepRisk, standardized by 1000, and the second-stage dependent variables are one-year averages of daily bid-ask spreads, Amihud's (2002) Price Impact Measure (AMIHUD), and Monthly Analyst Dispersions (DISP) in (2) - (4), respectively. The variable of interest is CSRIDX in the first stage and the predicted RepRisk in the second stage. Heteroskedasticity-adjusted $p$ values are presented in square brackets. The definitions of variables are provided in Table 9 \\*\\*\\*， $^{**}$ , and \\* indicate statistical significance at the 1, 5, and $10\\%$ levels, respectively  \n\nAs described above, four contributions of this study are identified. First, building upon the previous studies to examine the CSR-cost of equity, CSR-earnings management, and CSR-credit rating relations (El Ghoul et al. 2011, Kim et al. 2012; Attig et al. 2013, 2014) based on their argument that CSR reduces information asymmetry, we control the reverse-side association in the information asymmetry affecting CSR sphere and find that the lag of CSR has a negative association with the level of information asymmetry.  The negative  CSR-information asymmetry relation remains robust after controlling for the simultaneity bias and mitigating endogeneity issues, supporting the reputation-building hypothesis. Second, we find that the negative CSR-information asymmetry relation is amplified in high-risk firms. We interpret this as evidence of additional efforts by the managers of high-risk firms to reduce information asymmetry and to avoid adverse selection. Third, we contemplate the role of various internal and external stakeholders on a firm's information environment resulting in reduced information asymmetry, such as (i) managerial effort channel through their choices of CSR disclosure providing additional non-financial information to financial market, and (ii) third-party disclosure including consumers’ information exchange of a firm with high CSR, suppliers, prospective and existing employees, creditors and financial market, government, security analysts and institutional investors, credit rating agencies, and media. Last, but not the least, we find that CSR engagement is negatively related to reputational risk measure and lower predicted value of reputational risk is positively related to lower information asymmetry measures. Overall, our results suggest that a firm's engagement in CSR activities reduces information asymmetry.  \n\nOur study has a limitation in that we look only at the influence of CSR engagement on information environment. There are clearly other factors influencing information environment, such as economic considerations including the availability of capital to fund CSR initiatives, social and political factors, and of course legal considerations. All of these factors undoubtedly exert some degree of influence on information environment, and some may even exert greater infuence than CSR. Our study is therefore confined to a limited portion of the wide range of factors that influence a firm's information environment. Despite this limitation, our findings contribute to managerial practice by providing evidence on the simultaneous and endogenous effect of CSR on information asymmetry, which is amplified in high-risk firms. We consider that the observed inverse association between CSR engagement and information asymmetry is consistent with stakeholder theorybased reputation-building hypothesis.  \n\nAs the evolution of CSR in corporations continues, we expect that a future study that examines the CSR and information asymmetry relation over time would significantly contribute to our understanding of the relations between information asymmetry and CSR from survey data based on managers’ and various stakeholders’ responses and aggregate firm-level data. Thus, some future study of the information asymmetry--CSR nexus using large-scale survey data should be worthwhile. Further work also needs to take into account the impact of information asymmetry and CSR on long-term financial performance across nations. Research on why and how firms’ engagement in CSR differs across nations may provide additional understanding regarding the complex relations among CSR, information asymmetry, stock price, and firm value. Future research should also examine the impact of ethical decision making on information environment across cultures.  \n\nAcknowledgmentsThe authors thank two anonymous referees for their many valuable comments and suggestions.

Through regression test, it investigates the effect of upgrading human capital on innovation efficiency and its mechanisms. The results show a positive relationship between human capital upgrading and enterprise innovation efficiency. Mechanism analysis suggests that human capital upgrading promotes enterprise digital transformation and risk-taking levels to enhance innovation efficiency. Furthermore, the impact of human capital upgrading on innovation efficiency shows significant heterogeneity across different industries and scales, providing valuable insights into effective human capital management within enterprises and enhancing their innovation eficiency.  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nAs the economy undergoes swift advancements and globalization accelerates, enterprises confront a progressively competitive environment. Against this background, enterprises must maintain their competitive advantage and prolong their operational lifespan through continuous innovation (Liu et al., 2023). Innovation efficiency is a key indicator for measuring the utilization of resources involved in this activity and the overall innovation capability, influenced by multiple factors at macro, industry, and micro levels (e.g. Huang and Liu 2024, Lan et al. 2024, Liu and Zhao 2024, Wen et al. 2024, Yang et al. 2022). At the micro-enterprise level, Schumpeter's innovation theory emphasizes the importance of human capital in innovation. He pointed out that acquiring more knowledge and skills through education is the key to upgrading human capital, which helps improve innovation capabilities and efficiency. Human capital, as a core driver of enterprise innovation (Sun et al., 2020), plays a crucial role in improving enterprise innovation efficiency (Peng et al., 2020). Human capital upgrading manifests at the employee level, with an increase in the proportion of highly educated and technical personnel within the employees (Li et al., 2024). This comprehensive enhancement of capabilities implies that employees can communicate, understand, and accomplish tasks more efficiently, explore and solve problems more creatively, thus optimizing the innovation process of the enterprise.  \n\nHuman capital is a key force driving technological progress and social and economic prosperity (Li et al., 2024; Yu and Deng, 2021). Some scholars have examined how human capital affects enterprise innovation, focusing on the background characteristics of specific categories of staffs with authoritative influence such as executives and board members, such as the educational background and professional characteristics of directors affecting organizational innovation (Asad et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2019). There exists a positive relationship between the educational attainment of executives in small and medium-sized firms and the production of innovation (Timothy, 2022). Open innovation in enterprises could be influenced by female executives (Tahir et al., 2021). CEO's cognitive bias and knowledge integration can affect organizational innovation (Lartey et al., 2020; Rao et al., 2024). Nonetheless, enterprise innovation depends on a variety of human capital sources in addition to senior management (Capozza and Divella, 2019; Peng et al., 2020). The impact of employees' characteristic on enterprise innovation in a more general sense has not received enough attention in the prior studies. Furthermore, a limited amount of literature focuses on the overall employee level, examining the impact on enterprise innovation inputs and outputs (Capozza and Divella, 2019; Ramirez et al., 2020), lacking studies with enterprise innovation efficiency as the outcome variable.  \n\nThe mechanism underlying the relationship between human capital upgrading and enterprise innovation efficiency requires further exploration. On the one hand, employees’ level of education and possession of professional skills are valuable human resources. The digital transformation of enterprises requires the participation and collaboration of these highly qualified employees (Rodrigues et al. 2023; Ullrich et al., 2023). In this process, these employees, using digital tools and technology updates, can contribute to the improvement of enterprise innovation efficiency (Wang and He, 2024). On the other hand, employees? education level and professional skills enable them to more effectively select and participate in risk-preference innovation projects, thereby promoting an increase in the level of enterprise risk-taking (Jin et al., 2023), which in turn promotes the overall improvement of organizational innovation efficiency. However, there is limited literature examining whether the above two factors can serve as mechanisms affecting the relationship between human capital upgrading and enterprise innovation efficiency.  \n\nThree areas in which this research contributes just somewhat are as follows: (1) Starting from the perspective of human capital upgrading at the enterprise employee level, it fills the research gap between human capital upgrading and enterprise innovation efficiency. (2) It enriches the understanding of the impact mechanism of human capital upgrading on enterprise innovation efficiency through the intermediary paths of digital transformation and risk-taking. (3) By exploring the heterogeneity analysis of how human capital upgrading enhances enterprise innovation efficiency based on the industry type and scale of the enterprise, this study provides empirical conclusions that enrich the relevant research on the impact of human capital upgrading on enterprise innovation efficiency from the perspective of enterprise employees. It helps deepen the understanding of the relationship between these two factors and their influencing mechanisms, provides evidence for enterprises to formulate effective human capital management strategies, and offers insights for emerging countries and regions to improve their enterprise innovation efficiency.  \n\n## 2. Theoretical analysis and research hypotheses  \n\n### 2.1. Human capital upgrading and enterprise innovation efficiency  \n\nEnterprises need to actively innovate if they are to remain competitive and survive over the long run (Zhang and Zhu, 2024). Researchers have looked at the relationship between various aspects of human capital and enterprise innovation from various angles (Capozza and Divella, 2019; Huang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2021; Timothy, 2022). Employees' level of education and possession of professional skills are two common indicators of human capital upgrading (Dou et al., 2023). On the one hand, as the educational years of enterprise employees increase, the deeper their knowledge reserves, the stronger their learning ability, the faster they absorb new knowledge and the more effective they are in solving problems. Additionally, higher levels of employee education contribute to enhancing the enterprise's risk-taking level (Jin et al., 2023), thereby improving enterprise innovation efficiency. On the other hand, in response to the demand for enterprise digital transformation, employees with professional skills are more likely to accept new technologies and utilize new tools (Goulart et al., 2022). They are more inclined to choose innovative projects with higher risks and returns that fit the company's own situation, reducing related costs, increasing innovation outputs, and thus contributing to the improvement of organizational innovation efficiency.  \n\nH1: Upgrading human capital exhibits a positive impact on the innovation efficiency of enterprises.  \n\n### 2.2. Human capital upgrading, digital transformation and enterprise innovation efficiency  \n\nThe primary resource propelling digital transformation is human capital, and encouraging people to integrate with digital technology is essential to the process's success (Chang et al., 2024; Lang et al., 2022). The qualities of employees knowledge and skills are the crucial forces supporting enterprise digital transformation (Cetindamar Kozanoglu and Abedin, 2020). In the face of the digital economy era, university education provides courses that emphasize knowledge, technology, and digital skills to meet the demand for hiring more employees by enterprises. These highly educated employees? qualities contribute to driving enterprise digital transformation (Goulart et al., 2022). Meanwhile, employees with professional skills have the ability to develop and utilize new technologies, which is conducive to promoting enterprise digital transformation (Goulart et al., 2022). As a result of the upgrading of human capital and the enterprise digital transformation, these employees can help to improve enterprise innovation efficiency by increasing corresponding outputs, controlling overall innovation inputs, and expanding innovation opportunities by comprehending and using the digital tools and technological updates brought about by digital transformation (Wang and He, 2024; Zhao et al., 2022).  \n\nH2: Upgrading human capital increases the degree of enterprise digital transformation, thereby enhancing enterprise innovation eficiency.  \n\n### 2.3. Human capital upgrading, risk-taking and enterprise innovation efficiency  \n\nEmployees' level of education, as an important characteristic of human capital, can influence the level of risk-taking by enterprises.  \n\nSpecifically, the higher the level of education of employees, the more they can enhance the enterprise's decision-making wisdom, collect more necessary information for decision-making, understand and execute decisions better, and promote the selection of more risky but value-added projects by the enterprise, thereby increasing the organization's level of risk-taking (Jin et al., 2023). At the same time, employees with higher skills have professional experience, which helps them to confidently participate in riskier high-yield R&D activities (Jiang et al., 2023), thus increasing the enterprise's level of risk-taking. Enterprises with higher levels of risk-taking are more willing to adopt risk-taking innovative projects, thereby increasing organizational innovation efficiency (Li et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023).  \n\nH3: Upgrading human capital increases the degree of risk-taking, thereby enhancing enterprise innovation efficiency.  \n\n## 3. Empirical research design  \n\n### 3.1.Data  \n\nThis study is restricted to enterprises that are listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets. The following limitations were put in place to assure the study's objectivity: (a) B-share listed firms will be eliminated. (b) To assure the validity of the study's findings, such enterprises will be eliminated due to financial or other aberrant circumstances among enterprises of ST, ${}^{*}{\\cal S}\\mathrm{T}$ and PT. (c) Financial listed enterprises will traditionally be excluded due to the variations in accounting rules that apply to financial enterprises vs non-financial enterprises. To gauge the innovation efficiency of enterprises, this paper relies on data regarding the proportion of innovation input from selected listed enterprises, sourced from the firm characteristics database available on the China Research Data Service Platform (CNRDS). The sample scope of this study spans from 2011 to 2022, involving balanced panel data from 1314 listed enterprises. Human capital upgrading is measured by the proportion of employees with bachelor's degree or above and the proportion of technical employees obtained from Wind database. Indicators of control variables, such as firm scale and equity concentration, are obtained from the CSMAR and Wind databases.  \n\n### 3.2. Dependent variable  \n\nThis paper selects the proportion of innovation input (PIl) as a metric to evaluate the innovation efficiency of enterprises. The higher the PIl ratio, the more efficient the enterprise's innovation efforts. The formula for calculating PI is: $\\mathrm{PI}=$ (total innovation input in the current period / total assets at the beginning of the period) $\\times100\\%$ (Guo et al., 2021; Prugsamatz, 2021).  \n\n### 3.3. Independent variables  \n\nDrawing on the approaches of Dou et al. (2023) and Li et al. (2024), this study chooses to measure human capital upgrading from two dimensions: education level and skill level. Specifically, the proportion of employees with a bachelor's degree or higher education to the total number of employees (PEBD) and the proportion of technical employees to the total number of employees (PTE) are selected as indicators.  \n\n### 3.4. Control variables  \n\nThis study controls for the following variables that could affect firms’ innovation efficiency:  \n\nFirm scale (Scale) is calculated by In ( $^{1+}$ total assets), financial leverage (Lev) is measured by total liabilities divided by total assets, enterprise nature (SOE) is a dummy variable which is 1 for state-owned holding enterprises and O for others, operating income growth (Growth) is gauged by current year operating income/Previous year operating income -1, Equity concentration (Top3) is gauged by the percentage of shares owned by the top 3 shareholder, Executive finance background (FinBac) is a dummy variable which is 1 for executives with financial background and O for others, Executive age (ExeAge) is gauged by the mean age of executives, Executive gender (ExeGender) is measured by number of female in executive/total number of executive, Number of Employees (Employee) is calculated by In (total number of employees).  \n\n### 3.5.Model construction  \n\nThe fixed effects models are established as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{P I I_{i,t}=\\alpha_{0}+\\alpha_{1}P E B D_{i,t}+\\alpha_{2}C o n t r o l s_{i,t}+\\delta_{i}+\\gamma_{t}+\\varepsilon_{i,t}}\\ &{P I I_{i,t}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}P T E_{i,t}+\\beta_{2}C o n t r o l s_{i,t}+\\delta_{i}+\\gamma_{t}+\\varepsilon_{i,t}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nPII represents the dependent variable enterprise innovation efficiency, PEBD and PTE represent the proportion of employees with bachelor's degree or above and the proportion of technical employees, respectively. Controls, denotes control variables; $\\updelta_{i}$ and $\\upgamma_{t}$ represent firm fixed effects and year fixed effects.  \n\n## 4. Empirical analysis  \n\n### 4.1. Descriptive statistics  \n\nAs seen in Table 1, the mean value of the proportion of innovation input is 0.020, indicating that the average innovation input in the total assets of each enterprise is $2\\%$ . These descriptive statistics provide a comprehensive overview of the data set, demonstrating the diversity and distribution of critical variables. The reasonable range and variability of the data suggest that it is well suited for further analysis, allowing researchers to examine the relationships and patterns in the data set in greater depth.  \n\n### 4.2. Baseline regression  \n\nA baseline regression was conducted to examine the relationship between human capital upgrading and enterprise innovation efficiency. The regression analysis results are presented in Table 2, indicate that a higher proportion of employees with bachelor's degrees or higher education and a higher proportion of technical employees are positively associated with higher enterprise innovation efficiency.  \n\n### 4.3. Endogeneity test  \n\nAlthough the regression results showed a positive relationship between upgrading human capital and enterprise innovation efficiency, the improvement in enterprise innovation efficiency may not always be atributable to upgrading human capital given that enterprise innovation efficiency has consistently maintained a relatively high level and that the proportions of technical and bachelor's degree and above employees have also remained high in these organizations. Therefore, as instrumental variables (IV) for human capital upgrading, this study uses the 2SLS method for IV estimation and selects the mean proportion of employees with bachelor's degree or higher education (PEBD_mean) and the mean proportion of technical employees (PTE_mean) of enterprises in the same year and province. Although it does not directly affect the focal enterprise's innovation efficiency, the mean of human capital upgrading in other businesses in the same year and province relates to the focal enterprise's human capital upgrading. To address endogeneity concerns, this research additionally uses a lagged one-period treatment for human capital upgrading, regressing it once more with innovation efficiency.  \n\nThe results in columns (1)-(4) of Table 3 represent the 2SLS estimation results, while columns (5) - (6) present the regression results of lagged human capital upgrading with enterprise innovation efficiency. It is noted that there is a significant relationship between human capital upgrading and the instrumental variables. In the weak IV test, the F-values are 741.302 and 28.776 respectively for PEBD_mean and PTE _mean, indicating that they are not weak IV. Even after mitigating endogeneity issues, human capital upgrading still enhances enterprise inovation efficiency.  \n\n### 4.4. Robustness testing  \n\nThis study conducts robustness tests through sample reduction, variable replacement, adding control variables, and model substitution to validate the authenticity and reliability of the findings. Firstly, considering the outbreak of the COvID-19 pandemic in China in 2020, which caused significant disruptions to China's economic development and business activities, potentially interfering with enterprise human capital management and innovation activities, this study excludes samples from the year 2020 and onwards and conducted regression analysis again. Secondly, for the replacement of independent variables, the proportion of employees with graduate degree and above and the proportion of employees in high-skill positions (technical, marketing, and financial) are used. When replacing the measurement of the dependent variable, following the approach of Wang and He (2024), the proxy variable proportion of patent applications (PPA) was used, with its specific formula as In (number of patent applications $^{+1}$ )/In (R&D expenditure $+\\nobreakspace1.$ ). The results of the above are shown in Table 4.  \n\nTable 1 Descriptive statistical analysis.

Finally, random effects model and OLS model are used to examine the robustness of the results. The results of these two types of robustness tests are shown in Table 5. After conducting the aforementioned series of tests, the positive effect of human capital upgrading on enterprise innovation efficiency remains significant.  \n\nTable4 Endogeneity test by sample deletion and replacing measurement.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">RobustnessMethod</td><td colspan=\"2\">Sample deletion</td><td colspan=\"4\">Replace themeasurement ofvariables</td></tr><tr><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>PII</td><td>PII</td><td>PII</td><td>PPA</td><td>PPA</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">PEBD</td><td>0.017***</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.056***</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>(13.948)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(10.535)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">PTE</td><td></td><td>0.014***</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.021***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(11.570)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(3.778)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">PEGD</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.051***</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(13.025)</td><td>0.009***</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(10.719)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>-0.012**</td><td>-0.030***</td><td>-0.027***</td><td>-0.038***</td><td>-0.638***</td><td>-0.712***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td>(-2.267)</td><td>(-5.974)</td><td>(-6.674)</td><td>(-9.571)</td><td>(-28.894)</td><td>(-34.157)</td></tr><tr><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Controls Enterprise FE</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Year FE</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES YES</td></tr><tr><td>N</td><td></td><td></td><td>15,768</td><td>15,768</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>11,826 0.087</td><td>11,826 0.082</td><td>0.089</td><td>0.086</td><td>15,768 0.146</td><td>15,768 0.140</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTable5 Endogeneity test by adding control variables and replacing models.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Robustness Method</td><td colspan=\"2\">Add controlvariables</td><td colspan=\"4\">Replace the model</td></tr><tr><td>(1) PII</td><td>(2) PII</td><td>(3) PII</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5) PII</td><td>(9) PII</td></tr><tr><td>PEBD</td><td>0.018***</td><td></td><td></td><td>IId</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td>(18.072)</td><td></td><td>0.025*** (27.288)</td><td></td><td>0.048***</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.014***</td><td></td><td>0.023***</td><td>(65.852)</td><td>0.053***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">PTE Constant</td><td></td><td>(12.920)</td><td></td><td>(23.598)</td><td></td><td>(62.415)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.025***</td><td>-0.047***</td><td>0.022***</td><td>-0.007*</td><td>0.136***</td><td>0.084***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Controls</td><td>(-4.642)</td><td>(-9.202)</td><td>(5.881)</td><td>(-1.888)</td><td>(38.933)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>(24.167)</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise FE</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td></td><td></td><td>NO</td><td>YES NO</td></tr><tr><td>YearFE</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td></td><td>一</td><td>NO</td><td>NO</td></tr><tr><td>Industry</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>一 NO</td><td>NO</td><td>NO</td><td>NO</td></tr><tr><td>Region</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>NO</td><td>NO</td><td>NO</td><td>NO</td></tr><tr><td>N</td><td>15,768</td><td>15,768</td><td>15,768</td><td>15,768</td><td>15,768</td><td>15,768</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.123</td><td>0.113</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.361</td><td>0.347</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n### 4.5.

Therefore, following the approach of Chen and Li (2023), this study further investigates whether the impact of human capital upgrading on enterprise innovation efficiency differs among different industry types by categorizing enterprises into high-tech and non-high-tech enterprises. The corresponding results are presented in Table 6. The results indicate that in high-tech enterprises, the positive impact of human capital upgrading on enterprise innovation efficiency is stronger. Enterprises with more highly educated and skilled employees are better able to maintain innovation capabilities in high-tech industries where knowledge and technology are constantly evolving. This enables them to drive faster technological innovation and product upgrades, thereby promoting overall improvement in enterprise innovation efficiency.  \n\n#### 4.5.2. Different enterprise scales test  \n\nCompared to large-scale enterprises, employees in smaller-scale enterprises can interact more frequently, thereby achieving communication and knowledge sharing to enhance organizational performance (Lee and Wong, 2015). Additionally, smaller-scale enterprises place greater emphasis on personnel allocation and actively identify and utilize business opportunities, maintaining competitive advantages through product and process innovation (De Massis et al., 2018). Therefore, this study measures enterprise scale based on total assets and divides them into two groups to further investigate whether the impact of human capital upgrading on enterprise innovation efficiency differs among different enterprise size groups. The corresponding results are presented in Table 7. The results indicate that in smaller-scale enterprises, the proportion of employees with bachelor's degrees or higher has a stronger positive impact on enterprise innovation efficiency, while although the coefficient for the proportion of technical employees is larger, the difference in coefficients between groups is not significant in the inter-group coefficient difference test. In smaller-scale enterprises, there is a greater need for employees with higher levels of education, as they can promote the improvement of enterprise innovation efficiency through communication, collaboration, and the identification of high-yield innovation projects.  \n\n### 4.6. Mechanism analysis  \n\n#### 4.6.1. Mechanism analysis based on digital transformation  \n\nHuman capital upgrading encompasses both employees? level of education and technical skills. On the one hand, employees with higher education levels acquire more knowledge related to digital transformation during their studies. On the other hand, technical personnel's proficiency in specialized skills makes them more willing and capable of driving enterprise digital transformation. During the process of promoting enterprise digital transformation, these employees can better adapt to and utilize digital tools and technologies, thereby promoting the improvement of enterprise innovation efficiency. To verify this, this study adopts the approach of Wu et al. (2021) to measure enterprise digital transformation. Using the mediation effect test model constructed by Wen and Ye (2014), the study examines whether digital transformation can serve as a mediator, with the results shown in columns (1)-(4) of Table 8. The results indicate that human capital upgrading can enhance the degree of enterprise digital transformation, thereby improving enterprise innovation efficiency.  \n\n#### 4.6.2. Mechanism analysis based on risk-taking  \n\nThe level of enterprise risk-taking may also serve as a mediator influencing the relationship between human capital upgrading and enterprise innovation efficiency. On one hand, employees with higher education levels participating in enterprise operations can optimize decision-making, enrich the information available to the enterprise, and better understand and promote the execution of organizational decisions. On the other hand, the specialized technical knowledge possessed by technical personnel helps enhance their confidence in selecting risky projects. Both aspects of human capital upgrading contribute to enterprises selecting more high-risk and high-return innovative projects, thereby enhancing enterprise innovation outcomes. To verify this, this study adopts the approach of Li and Yu (2012) to measure the level of enterprise risk-taking. Using the mediation effect test model constructed by Wen and Ye (2014), the study examines whether enterprise risk-taking can serve as a mediator variable, with the results shown in columns (5) - (6) of Table 8. The results indicate that a higher proportion of employees with bachelor's degrees or higher can increase the level of enterprise risk-taking, thereby enhancing enterprise innovation efficiency. As for enterprise risk-taking as a mediator, it is not significant in the proportion of technical employees, but due to space limitations, it is not shown here.  \n\n## 5. Conclusion  \n\nIn order to fill the research gap between human capital and enterprise innovation efficiency, this study first unifies enterprise innovation efficiency with human capital upgrading at the level of all employees into a unified framework. It examines the effects of upgrading human capital on enterprise innovation efficiency and its processes, beginning with the viewpoint that human capital is the whole employees. The following are the primary conclusions: (1) Upgrading human capital greatly increases the innovation efficiency. (2) This relationship varies depending on industry types and enterprise scales. (3) The degree of enterprise digital transformation and the level of risk-taking serve as important mediating variables for the impact of human capital upgrading on enterprise innovation efficiency. A growth in the percentage of technical employees and employees with higher education level supports enterprise digital transformation, and these employees are more likely to use of digital tools and technologies improves organizational innovation efficiency. Higher educated employees contribute to an organization's increased risk-taking, which makes it easier to choose more potential business innovation initiatives and boosts enterprise innovation efficiency. Enterprises need to adopt efective management strategies in the process of human capital upgrading, such as recruiting more employees with higher education and technical skills, encouraging employees to improve their education levels, and incentivizing technical personnel, to give full play to the facilitating effect of human capital upgrading on enterprises innovation efficiency.  \n\nTable7 Heterogeneity test based on enterprise scale.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Sources ofheterogeneity</td><td>(1) Low size enterprises</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3) High size enterprises</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td>IId</td><td>PII</td><td>PII</td><td>PII</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">PEBD</td><td>0.022***</td><td></td><td>0.012***</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>(15.530)</td><td></td><td>(9.484)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>PTE</td><td></td><td>0.016***</td><td>-0.024*** (-5.993)</td><td>0.010***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Constant</td><td rowspan=\"2\">-0.025***</td><td>(10.913)</td><td></td><td>(6.881)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.021***</td><td></td><td>-0.028***</td></tr><tr><td>Controls</td><td>(-6.024) YES</td><td>(-4.968) YES</td><td>YES</td><td>(-7.018) YES</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise FE</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>YearFE</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>N</td><td>7884</td><td>7884</td><td>7884</td><td>7884</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.094</td><td>0.097</td><td>0.092</td><td>0.087</td></tr><tr><td>Empirical p-value</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>AboutPEBD</td><td colspan=\"2\">0.010</td><td colspan=\"2\"></td></tr><tr><td>About PTE</td><td colspan=\"2\">0.160</td><td colspan=\"2\"></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTable 8 Mechanism analysis.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Mechanism</td><td colspan=\"4\">DT</td><td colspan=\"2\">RT</td></tr><tr><td>(1) DT</td><td>(2) PII</td><td>(3) DT</td><td>(4) PII</td><td>(5) RT</td><td>(6) PII</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">PEBD</td><td>1.114***</td><td>0.018***</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.013***</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>(15.426)</td><td>(17.733)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(5.437)</td><td>0.018***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">DT</td><td></td><td>0.001***</td><td></td><td>0.001***</td><td></td><td>(18.667)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(7.145)</td><td></td><td>(8.394)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>PTE</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.634***</td><td>0.015***</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>RT</td><td></td><td></td><td>(8.353)</td><td>(14.911)</td><td></td><td>0.006*</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Constant</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(1.745)</td></tr><tr><td>-13.430***</td><td>-0.004</td><td>-14.853***</td><td>-0.023***</td><td>0.169***</td><td>-0.016***</td></tr><tr><td>Controls</td><td>(-44.393) YES</td><td>(-0.966) YES</td><td>(-51.865) YES</td><td>(-5.416) YES</td><td>(16.409)</td><td>(-3.865)</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise FE</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>YearFE</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Industry</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>N</td><td>15,768</td><td>15,768</td><td>15,768</td><td>15,768</td><td>15,768</td><td>YES 15,768</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.227</td><td>0.104</td><td>0.268</td><td>0.098</td><td>0.027</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.101</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n# CRediT authorship contribution statement  \n\nZhuqing Cui: Writing - original draft.

Introduction  \n\nThe information asymmetry between managers and investors is a fundamental issue for investors and market observers. In equilibrium, cross-sectional variation in the benefits and costs associated with gathering and disclosing information leads to variation in information asymmetry. We examine three significant sources of information, financial statements, analyst following, and news, to assess the marginal effect of each on the information asymmetry between managers and investors. We use the predictive power of insider trades and insider trading intensity as proxies for the level of information asymmetry. Thus, this paper integrates the existing literature on insider trading with the literature seeking to understand factors that influence information asymmetry.  \n\nReducing information inequities has long been a regulatory goal in the United States. Indeed, a desire to reduce information asymmetry guided the 1934 Securities Act. As Benston (1973) notes,  \n\nUnderlying the disclosure requirements of the $^{\\circ}34~\\mathrm{Act}$ is the belief that required disclosure of financial data is necessary for the fair and efficient operation of capital markets...Perhaps even more important is the concept of “fairness,”’ the belief that all investors, big and small, insiders and outsiders, should have equal access to relevant information. (p. 134.)  \n\nThe need to reduce asymmetry in order to strengthen markets is acknowledged by former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Arthur Levitt, who states that the SEC is “working with similarly interested parties from around the globe to advance the cause of efficient and transparent markets.\"” (SEC, 200o) The International Accounting Standards Board and some financial executives share this opinion. Lev (1988) cites the potential adverse liquidity consequences of information asymmetry to argue for mandated disclosure of financial information. While some emphasize regulation to reduce information asymmetry, investors? demand for information and entrepreneurs’ desire for capital motivate private information production and disclosure, providing an alternative means to reduce information asymmetry.2  \n\nThis study contributes to the literature in a number of ways. First, we provide evidence on the relation between the informativeness of financial reports and information asymmetry. Accounting researchers generally recognize the role of financial reporting in reducing information asymmetry between managers and investors (e.g., Healy and Palepu, 2001). Indeed, one argument for allowing managers the discretion inherent in accrual accounting is that such flexibility allows managers to better communicate their knowledge of the firm's economic position in financial reports (Dechow, 1994). We use the $R$ -squared from a time-series regression of price on earnings and book value as a measure of accounting informativeness. Cross-sectional $R$ -squares are widely used in research to evaluate the quality of accounting information (Collins et al., 1997; Ely and Waymire, 1999; Francis and  \n\nSchipper, 1999). Yet, Brown et al. (1999) raise questions about the interpretability of R-squares produced by cross-sectional levels regressions. Our analysis provides evidence on the relation between R-squares derived from time-series regressions and the extent of information asymmetry between managers and outsiders.  \n\nSecond, our investigation provides insight into the role of sell-side analysts as information intermediaries in the capital markets. Events, such as the bankruptcy of Enron and the decline in the market values of Internet companies, have led some to allege that incentives to generate investment banking and trading revenues bias analysts' recommendations (Thorton et al., 2002; Munk, 2002). In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a formal inquiry into these potential conflicts of interest (White and Day, 2002). According to this view, analysts do little to reduce the information asymmetry between managers and investors. On the other hand, Hong et al. (20oo) finding of reduced price momentum in stocks followed by more analysts is consistent with the hypothesis that analysts increase the speed of diffusion of firm-specific information across market participants. Our study provides additional evidence on the relation between the intensity of analyst activity (analyst following) and the information asymmetry between managers and investors.  \n\nFinally, we study an additional component of the firm's information environment: articles in the popular press and corporate news releases. These articles are a significant source of firm-specific information, but their relation to information asymmetry has only begun to be examined (e.g., Chan, 2003). Like analyst following, news articles can proxy for the resources devoted to private information collection. Thus, we include news to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the primary sources of firm-specific information and to investigate the relation between this important source of firm-specific information and information asymmetry.  \n\nTo explore the information asymmetry that exists between managers and investors, we begin with a sample of trades made by managers and directors between January 1, 1982 and December 31, 1997. Within this sample, we investigate the profitability of insider trades or more specifically, the relation between managers? trades in a given firm in a given month and subsequent returns. We then examine whether the profitability of insider trades is related to the price relevance of financial statements, analyst following, and the number of news items on Dow Jones News Retrieval.  \n\nThis analysis yields several interesting results. First, we find that analyst following and news available each substitutes for financial statement informativeness. That is, firms with financial statements that are less value relevant tend to have higher analyst following and more news coverage. Further, we find that the profitability of insider trades declines as the number of analysts following the firm increases. News and $R^{2}$ are not significantly related to insider trading profits after controlling for the variance of returns.  \n\nThis return-based analysis has reduced ability to distinguish  variation in information asymmetry across firm-months. We can only measure profits conditional on trade. Insiders will not trade unless they can earn a profit that covers trading costs (including legal liability). The exclusion of unprofitable potential trades reduces cross-sectional variation in the profitability of observed trades. Therefore, we also examine cross-sectional variation in insider buying activity under the assumption that buying activity, in particular, is precipitated by the existence of a profitable trading opportunity, and the frequency of profitable trading opportunities is related to information asymmetry. We find that insider buying is significantly less for firms with large analyst following. This result reinforces the inference that outside investors in firms with greater analyst following face less information asymmetry. In addition, management share purchases are less frequent for firms with higher accounting $R^{2}$ , indicating a negative relation between financial statement informativeness and the frequency of profitable insider buying opportunities. Interestingly, we find that increased news coverage is associated with greater insider buying activity. Greater news coverage is likely to occur in uncertain times. This result supports the intuition that greater news coverage also proxies for increased opportunities for information-based trade.  \n\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we discuss our proxy for information asymmetry, insider trading profits. Section 3 analyzes each of our three information sources and develops our hypotheses. Section 4 describes the sample, our variables, and gives summary statistics. In Section 5, we provide results for the predictive ability of insider trades and explore the relation between this predictive power and the firm's information environment. Section 6 concludes the study.  \n\n## 2. Insider trading profits as a measure of information asymmetry  \n\nThe logic behind the use of insider trading as a proxy for information asymmetry is as follows. Insiders profit when they trade on value-relevant information before public disclosure leads to its full incorporation into stock prices. Thus, insider trading profits are related to the degree of information asymmetry between managers and outside investors. Intuitively, insider trading profits should be zero if market participants have the same information as managers. Indeed, Kyle (1985) demonstrates that insider profits increase in insiders’ information advantage. In his model, only the insider knows the liquidation value of the risky asset. Thus the insider's information advantage can be defined as the variance of this liquidation value. In a model that incorporates financial disclosure into Kyle's (1985) setting, Baiman and Verrecchia (1996) show that insider profits decrease as public information becomes more precise. Their model explicitly links disclosure incentives, information asymmetry, and insider trading profits.  \n\nKyle's model does not fully capture market characteristics that limit insider profits. For example, uninformed traders aware of information asymmetry may limit the losses sustained at the hands of insiders. Uninformed traders are likely to alter their trading behavior (Admati and Pfleiderer, 1988) or, in the extreme, leave the market (Merton, 1987). Uninformed traders can also respond to information asymmetry by gathering information either themselves or via intermediaries. For example, Barth et al. (2001) suggest that high information asymmetry makes private information acquisition more profitable and thus increases the number of analysts following the firm. In their study, they find increased analyst following for firms with more intangible assets. Incentives to gather information reduce the profits of information gathering so in equilibrium the degree of information asymmetry and the amount of information gathering are such that information gatherers earn only a normal rate of return on their activities (Grossman and Stiglitz, 1980; Verrecchia, 1982). Holden and Subrahmanyam (1992) find that competition among insiders also reduces the profitability of their trades.  \n\nAside from private information acquisition and trader competition, other actions limit the profits of insiders with superior private information. For example, corporate policies or governmental regulations restrict inside trades. In addition, specialists can increase spreads or reduce depth as information asymmetry increases, limiting insider profits (Glosten and Milgrom, 1985; Bettis et al. 2000).  \n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, organizational economics suggests that individuals will strive to create efficient organizations because such organizations produce greater gains to be shared (Coase, 1937, 1960). The ability to profit from information asymmetry can lead managers to make production/investment decisions that create private information even if they are less efficient. Incentive signaling theory (Ross, 1979) suggests that in the presence of competitive labor and capital markets, managers’ salaries will be reduced by expected insider profits and that managers will be penalized for the loss in efficiency associated with retaining the ability to profit from private information. Thus managers have a strong incentive to reduce information asymmetry. In short, numerous factors affect managers’ ability to garner profits from private information.  \n\nNonetheless, previous research finds that insider trades are profitable. Jaffe (1974), Finnerty (1976), Seyhun (1986, 1992), Rozeff and Zaman (1988), and Jeng et al. (1999) find insiders earn abnormal returns.3 More recently Lakonishok and Lee (2001) find that insider purchases in smaller firms predict future returns but that this predictive power does not hold for larger firms. Similarly, Finnerty (1976) and Seyhun (1986) find insider profits are larger for smaller firms.4 Research suggests that size proxies for the amount of prior information available about a firm (e.g., Grant, 1980; Atiase, 1985; Collins et al.,1987; Freeman, 1987; Bhushan, 1989). Indeed, Elliot et al. (1984) hypothesize that because fewer analysts follow smaller firms, small firms’ prices do not “completely reflect information,\" and insiders can more successfully use private information (p. 522). If firm size is a proxy for information asymmetry and information asymmetry is greater in smaller firms, then the results of Lakonishok and Lee (2001), Seyhun (1986), and Finnerty (1976) suggest insider profits are larger when greater information asymmetry is present.  \n\nAboody and Lev (20oo) provide further evidence on the relation between insider trading profits and the superiority of insider information. They study the effect of R&D investment on insider trading profits and find that insider trading profits are higher for firms with R&D expenditures. Aboody and Lev contend that this relation results from the information asymmetry induced by R&D investment. They argue that lack of organized markets for R&D projects, their uniqueness, and the inability of financial reporting to measure their value all contribute to the information advantage of insiders. The present study examines this conjecture by directly examining whether the value relevance of financial reporting is related to insider trading profits.  \n\nTo summarize, empirical evidence suggests that Kyle's (1985) model of insider profits is descriptive. Moreover, research finds that insider profits are more significant in smaller firms and firms with R&D spending. These results imply an inverse relation between the availability of information to outsiders and the profitability of inside information. We test this notion by identifying specific sources of information utilized by investors and by examining the marginal contribution of each to the reduction of information asymmetry. In doing so, we directly illuminate the link between financial statements, analysts, and news outlets and one of their key objectives—providing investors with information about what is going on inside the firm.  \n\n## 3. Sources of information and hypothesis development  \n\nIn this section we develop our hypotheses on the relation between financial statement informativeness, analyst following, and news and information asymmetry. We also discuss the use insider trading as a measure of information asymmetry.  \n\n### 3.1. Hypothesis development  \n\nThis study focuses on three potential sources of information about a firm's future profitability: financial statements, analysts, and firm-related material generated by news outlets. These sources proxy for the degree of information asymmetry between market participants and insiders and thus affect the magnitude of insiders’ profits.  \n\nAccording to the effcient contracting perspective, managers choose accounting methods to minimize ^contracting? costs (Holthausen, 1990; Watts and Zimmerman, 1990). In this framework, managers have an incentive to reduce information asymmetry, when the adverse effect of insider trading on firm value exceeds disclosure costs (Watts and Zimmerman, 1986; Diamond and Verrecchia, 1991). Consistent with this intuition, firms requiring external financing tend to issue earnings forecasts more frequently (Frankel et al., 1995; Ruland et al., 1990). If managers have an incentive to reduce information asymmetry, managers of firms with larger insider profit opportunities will take steps to reduce them. Aside from issuing forecasts, these steps could include attempts to increase analyst following or the value relevance of financial statements.  \n\nEndogeneity in the relation between information asymmetry and information sources is likely to be most problematic in the case of voluntary disclosures by the firm. By definition, managers have direct control over this information channel. Moreover, voluntary disclosure can supplement deficient financial statements, limited analyst following, and sparse news coverage.  \n\nWithin the framework of efficient contracting and efficient capital and labor markets, the existence of cross-sectional variation in the level of information asymmetry can be driven by cross-sectional variation in disclosure costs (Verrecchia. 1983). Insider trading profits thus proxy for the costs (e.g., proprietary costs) associated with reducing information asymmetry. Alternatively, one can assume that the parties involved do not instantaneously adjust in response to a shock to the information environment. As this adjustment occurs, cross-sectional variation in insider trading opportunities will result. Finally, one can assume that individuals take existing contracts as given and do not explicitly consider future periods. This ‘opportunistic behavior perspective’ (Holthausen, 1990) supports our research design, and is the basis for much research, including, for example, studies of earnings management (e.g., DeFond and Jiambalvo, 1994; McNichols and Wilson, 1988; Jones, 1991; Healy, 1985).?  \n\nFinancial statements. Financial statements are an important source of information for outsiders. According to the SEC, \"The annual report to security holders has long been recognized as the most effective means of communication between management and security holders.’ (SEC Handbook, Section 102, para. 38,025) Beginning with Ball and Brown (1968), researchers have focused considerable attention on the value relevance of financial statement information. In addition, many note the central importance of “high quality” financial accounting information to robust and effective capital markets (Sutton, 1997; Beresford, 1997). Despite this consensus regarding the importance of financial statements, few researchers have examined the relation between value relevance and the extent of insiders' information advantage.6  \n\nTo assess the value relevance of financial statement information, we use the $\\mathsf{R}^{2}$ from a regression of stock price on earnings and book value. Many studies use this measure to assess the value relevance of financial statement information. We use it as a proxy for cross-sectional differences in the informativeness of financial statements.7 Yet, some have begun to question the relevance of value-relevance research (e.g., Holthausen and Watts, 2001). Our examination of the $R^{2}$ proxy provides evidence on the implications of this measure for information asymmetry.  \n\nGiven greater information asymmetry implies larger insider trading profits and value relevant financial statements, ceteris paribus, reduce information asymmetry, we expect a negative relation between the value relevance of financial statements and insider trading profits.  \n\nH1: Insider trading profits are decreasing in value relevance of financial statements.  \n\nAnalyst following. Analysts play a significant role as intermediaries between managers and investors. For example, Givoly and Lakonishok (1979) and Lys and Sohn (1990) find that markets react to the release of individual analyst forecasts. Devoting more resources to information gathering should, ceteris paribus, reduce information asymmetry, leading to a negative relation between analyst following and insider trading profits.  \n\nHowever, the market's response to analyst reports may reflect “hype.’ Indeed, some allege analysts’ recommendations are misleading, because of incentives to generate profits for their employers. Examining the relation between insider trading profits and analyst following contributes to this debate, by providing evidence on the relation between analyst activities and information asymmetry between investors and managers. Under market efficiency, prior findings of a market reaction to the release of analyst reports (e.g., Givoly and Lakonishok, 1979) imply that they are informative. Thus we state our second hypothesis in the following alternative form. H2: Insider trading profits are negatively associated with analyst following.  \n\nTesting H2 requires controlling for the fact that analysts’ incentives may be affected by required disclosures of financial information. Bhushan (1989) models the supply of and the demand for analyst services and concludes that supply decreases as costs increase. If financial statements are an important source of information for analysts, then reducing the usefulness of financial statements should increase the costs of processing information and reduce the supply of analyst information. However, reduced financial statement informativeness may increase investor demand for the services of experts, including financial analysts.  \n\nEmpirical evidence on the relation between analyst activities and financial statement informativeness is mixed. Results depend on the proxies used for analyst activities and financial statement informativeness. Results in Lang and Lundholm (1996) suggest that more informative financial statements are associated with an increase in the net benefits available to information intermediaries and increased resources devoted to information discovery. They find a positive relation between disclosure quality and analyst following. On the other hand, Frankel et al. (2003) find a negative relation between analyst informativeness and the value relevance of book value and earnings (i.e., they are substitutes). Frankel et al. (2003) focus on the market reaction to analyst reports while Lang and Lundholm (1996) use analyst following as a proxy for analyst activities. In contrast to Frankel et al. (2003), Francis et al. (2002) find that the informativeness of analysts’ reports is not negatively related to price reaction at earnings announcements (i.e., they are not substitutes). Moreover, unlike Lang and Lundholm (1996), they do not find systematic evidence that they are complements. Whether, analyst activities are positively or negatively correlated with financial statement informativeness, the correlation between financial statement information and the intensity of analyst activities can lead one to incorrectly attribute cross-sectional variation in insider profits to the value relevance of financial statement information when it is related to analyst activities. Because of the potential for correlation between analyst activities and financial statement informativeness it is necessary to include both factors in any regression analysis designed to understand the marginal effect of either factor on the information asymmetry between managers and investors.  \n\nNews coverage. The final source of information that we study is news coverage of firms. News unrelated to the announcement of financial statement information and analyst disclosures provides information to market participants and thus is expected to affect the degree of information asymmetry between managers and outsiders (Thompson et al., 1987; Mitchell and Mulherin, 1994). For example, pre-emptive news releases affect the market's reaction to earnings announcements and thus the information asymmetry between managers and investors prior to earnings announcements (Atiase, 1985). In addition, news analysis stories can directly affect companies’ stock prices (Foster, 1979). Thus news coverage can reduce information asymmetry and affect the predictive ability of insider trades.  \n\nMoreover, news coverage should be considered when one attempts to understand the relation between other information sources (e.g., financial statements and analysts) and insider trading profits. News coverage is driven by the demands of market participants. This demand should be related to the availability of other information suggesting the need to control for all important sources of information when assessing the link between any one source and information asymmetry.  \n\nDemand for information by outsiders and the existence of profitable insider trading opportunities are both likely to be related to uncertainty. Therefore, uncertainty may act as a correlated omitted variable. We control for uncertainty when we examine the association between news and information asymmetry.  \n\nLike analysts, reporters' interests are not necessarily aligned with investors. To sell their services, reporters must convince investors that they provide useful information. Ross (1979) notes that the costs of entry in the information market are generally low and that individuals have an incentive to profit by selling false information. Uninformed investors are aware of these incentives and will discount investment advice. Yet, these incentives create the possibility that reporters’ activities will, at times, accentuate the information gap between managers and uniformed investors who have difficulty identifying useful information. However, our priors are that more news coverage, like increased analyst following, reduces information asymmetry. Our third hypothesis, stated in alternative form, is as follows.  \n\nH3: Insider trading profits are negatively associated with news coverage.  \n\n### 3.2. Measures of insider trading profits  \n\nWhile theory guides our search for insider profit proxies, it does not delineate the choice. In particular, Baiman and Verrecchia (1996) and Fishman and Hagerty (1992) model trade taking place in a single round so that insider profits are not a function of insiders’ trading frequency. In Kyle (1985), insider information is gradually incorporated into price as insiders submit orders and earn profits.  \n\nIntuitively insider trading profits are an increasing function of the profitability of each trade and the number of trades executed. This logic suggests two measures of insider trading profits: (l) the profitability of an individual insider trade and (2) the frequency of insider trades. Measuring the frequency of insider trading is important for another reason. If insiders incur a fixed cost when executing a trade, then they will not trade unless the expected profits of the trade exceed this cost. If this cost is cross-sectionally constant, then we should see fewer trades when insiders’ private information is less valuable (e.g. situations of low information asymmetry).8 Thus trading frequency can serve as an important measure of information asymmetry. We discuss our measures these variables in more detail in Section4.  \n\n## 4. Data and sample selection  \n\n### 4.1. Data  \n\nThe source of our insider trading data is the SEC's Ownership Reporting System (ORS) data file. The ORS data file contains all transactions by insiders after 1975 that are subject to disclosure under Section 16(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. According to Section 16(a), insiders include any director or officer of the issuer as well as any beneficial owners of more than $10\\%$ of any class of the issuer's equity securities (para. 23,711 of the Exchange Act Rules). Such individuals are required to file a Form 4 on or before the tenth day after the end of the month in which a trade has occurred.9  \n\nFollowing Lakonishok and Lee (2001), we apply several filters to the data to ensure our insider transactions are both meaningful and consistent with the information we obtain from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP). First, following our focus on the information asymmetry between managers and investors we eliminate non “management'’ insider transactions from our sample. “Management’ transactions refer to those trades made by CEOs, CFOs, presidents, officers, vice presidents, treasurers, divisional officers, general partners, and controlling persons. These filters as well as their effects on the total number of trades in our sample are listed in Table 1. The requirement that transactions represent open market purchases and/or data problems results in a large number of lost observations. After deleting duplicate observations, approximately $1.2\\mathbf{M}$ observations remain. Sixty percent of these (approximately 800,0oo) are then deleted because prices are outside of acceptable ranges or share amounts exceed the daily volume. While these results are similar to those of Lakonishok and Lee (2001), they indicate the potential for errors in the SEC's insider trading database.  \n\nThe stock return data are obtained from the 20o0 CRSP tapes. Financial data are obtained from the 2000 Compustat tapes. News data are from Dow Jones News Retrieval (DJNR), and analyst data are from $\\mathrm{I}/\\mathbf{B}/\\mathbf{E}/\\mathbf{S}$ summary tape.  \n\nTable1 Sample selection and number of observations removed by each filter  \n\nThis table reports the sequential filters applied to obtain the final sample of insider trades. We begin with insider trades in the Security and Exchange Commission's Ownership Reporting System data file; this file covers the period from 1975 to 1997. The sample is constructed as follows. First, we limit our sample to relevant transactions, such as common shares and meaningful trades. We define “Purchases\" and “Sales\" as open market or private purchases and sales respectively. “Option\" refers to the purchase of shares through the exercise/conversion of options, warrants, or convertible bonds and sales of those shares acquired through options. Second, we compare the prices and volume data on $O R S$ to similardataon CRSP and discard transactions with suspect values.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>NumberoftransactionsintheoriginalORSdatabase</td><td>4,422,216</td></tr><tr><td>Eliminate:</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Non-common shares,i.e.,CUSIP class code other than“10\"or“11\"</td><td>(429,237)</td></tr><tr><td>Missingdateoftransaction</td><td>(268,209)</td></tr><tr><td>Transaction types are not“Purchases\", “Sales\" and “Option\"</td><td>(1,993,497)</td></tr><tr><td>Transactionpriceislessthan$2ashare</td><td>(332,022)</td></tr><tr><td>Numberoftransactionsharesislessthan1o0shares</td><td>(106,379)</td></tr><tr><td>Duplicatetransactionby all thecommonvariables</td><td>(51,648)</td></tr><tr><td>NumberoftransactionsharesismorethanCRSPdailyvolume</td><td>(306,293)</td></tr><tr><td>TransactionpricefallingoutofbidloandaskhiofCRSPdailyfile</td><td>(494,934)</td></tr><tr><td>Transaction type is “Option\" and/or insiders are not “Management\"</td><td>(231,639)</td></tr><tr><td>Totalremainingtransactions</td><td>208,358</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n### 4.2. Dependent variable  \n\nAny study of the relation between information sources and information asymmetry must utilize an appropriate event window. The post-trade return window should provide a measure of the insider's information advantage at the time of the trade. A short-window may not allow sufficient time for the insider's information to become incorporated in the stock price. In this case, returns measured over a shortwindow will not reflect the full extent of their information advantage. However, a long-window can extend beyond the time horizon of the insiders’ informational advantage and simply add noise. The proper window depends on the time necessary for insider information to become incorporated in price.  \n\nPrior research indicates two qualities of insider trades that are helpful for choosing the proper event window. First, evidence suggests that insiders take positions based on longer-term information. For example Elliott et al. (1984) and Shivakumar and Waymire (1994) are unable to find a relation between insider trading activity/profits and specific information releases. These results as well as those of Noe (1999) and Ke et al. (2001) suggest that insiders’ information advantage is not related to advance knowledge of upcoming announcements. Second, evidence suggests that insiders' trades predict returns for up to a year following the trade, but that the majority of the abnormal return occurs in the first six months after the trade (Seyhun (1998)). These results suggest the use of a six-month return-window to measure the extent of insiders? private information.  \n\nTable2 Descriptive statisticsfor variables This table provides descriptive statistics for variables used in subsequent tests. To be included in this table, a firm-month observation must be accompanied by sufficient data to compute the variables displayed below. The statistics for all variables are based on 47,266 firm-month observations. Firm-months with no management trading activity are excluded because NPR cannot be computed.

Raw returns are adjusted by subtracting the buy and hold return of the relevant Fama-French book-to-market and size quintile portfolio obtained from Ken French's web site.1o Descriptive statistics for returns and the independent variables discussed below can be found in Table 2. These statistics are weighted by the number of months containing insider transactions, because we include only those firm-months containing insider transactions in our tests.  \n\n### 4.3. Independent variables  \n\n$R$ -squared. We measure the informativeness of financial statements using the adjusted $R^{2}$ from a firm-specific time-series regression. The regression model used is  \n\n$$\nP_{i t}=a+b_{1}E_{i t}+b_{2}B V_{i t}+\\varepsilon_{i t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $P_{i t}$ is the price-per-share of firm $i$ three months after fiscal year-end $t$ $E_{i t}$ is the earnings-per-share of firm $i$ during year $t$ $B V_{i t}$ is the book-value-per-share of firm $i$ at the end of year $t$ , and $\\varepsilon_{i t}$ is the regression residual.  \n\nWe require firms to have a minimum of 5 yearly observations to compute the $R^{2}$ To prevent overlap between prices used in the $R^{2}$ estimation and the adjusted-returns used as the dependent variable in the main estimation, the yearly observations corresponding to the year of the event-month and the year after the event-month are deleted from the observations used to estimate $R^{2}$ . Thus, the $R^{2}$ measure may differ across years for a given firm. As shown in Table 2, the average and median $\\stackrel{\\cdot}{R^{2}}\\mathrm{s}$ are $31.75\\%$ and $30.04\\%$  \n\nAnalyst activity. Our proxy for the intensity of analyst activity in a given firm-year is number of analysts following the firm. Number of analysts is a widely-used proxy for analyst activity in the accounting literature. For example, Bhushan (1989) uses analyst following as a proxy for the total resources spent on private information collection. Note that if analyst following reflects the broader concept of information collection, as Bhushan (1989) assumes, then we must be careful in attributing the effects of analyst following on insider information solely to the activities of analysts.1l However, if analyst following proxies for information collection, then we can use it to better measure the marginal effects of financial statement informativeness. In other words, analyst following can provide a control for the interaction between financial reporting and information collection for a broader group of market participants.  \n\nWe measure analyst following using the $\\mathrm{I}/\\mathbf{B}/\\mathbf{E}/\\mathbf{S}$ Summary Tape. For each firmcalendar-year we use the maximum number of analysts making one-year-ahead forecasts. The number of analysts following a frm is positively related to the firm's market value (Bhushan, 1989). Thus, analyst following may increase when stock price increases. To prevent look-ahead bias from affecting this variable, we use analyst coverage in the year prior to the year of the insider trading firm-month.  \n\nTo avoid unnecessary deletion of observations with all other necessary data, we code firms missing from the $\\mathrm{I/B/E/S}$ database after 1990 as having zero analysts. Prior to 1991 we code firms missing from the $\\mathrm{I}/\\mathbf{B}/\\mathbf{E}/\\mathbf{S}$ database as having missing analyst data. Thus, we exclude such firms from the sample. This cut-off was chosen because $\\mathrm{I/B/E/S}$ coverage has become more comprehensive over time. Thus, firms with no data after 1990 likely have no analyst following.12 The distribution of the analyst following variable is presented in Table 2. Note that the mean (median) number of analysts predicting earnings in year $t-1$ for a firm-month with insider trading activity is approximately eight (10).  \n\nCompany news. To measure voluntary disclosure and press coverage for a firm, we search the “all news\"’ category of the DJNR to identify the number of companyspecific news stories. For each firm-year we examine CRSP for availability of returns data between January 1, 1980 and December 29, 2000. We then search DJNR for all news articles on that company over the subinterval containing CRSP returns for that firm-year. Searches for a given company during a given firm-year are done using the company ticker symbol found in the CRSP database for that company during that time. The “all news” category of DJNR contains articles from approximately 6000 magazines, newspapers, and trade journals and includes the major business publications as well as the news wires generally used by companies to release news (i.e., PR News Wire and Business Wire). Thus, this measure incorporates both firm initiated disclosures such as new product announcements as well as reporter-initiated news items.  \n\nThe time interval searched in a given firm-year may differ across companies, and more articles are likely to be found over longer time-intervals.13 To adjust for this potential bias, we standardize our measure by dividing the number of articles found in the firm-year by the number of days in the firm-year.14 To avoid potential lookahead bias, we match our standardized news measure in year $t{-}1$ to the event month in year t. Table 2 shows that the mean (median) number of articles per day in the year prior to the event-month year is 0.12 (0.10) in our sample.  \n\nOur news variable focuses on the quantity rather than the quality of disclosure. In addition, this variable is a noisy measure of unique stories because it counts rebroadcasts of stories carried by multiple news services. Thus the measure is susceptible to the criticism that 1) it can be inflated for firms and/or 2) the same story is ^over-hyped' by the press. In these situations, more news may lead to an increase in profitable trading opportunities by insiders. On the other hand, rebroadcasts are more likely to occur when an article is viewed as relevant to many investors and thus can measure of the importance or “quality'” of a story.15  \n\nInsider trading activity. We compute a net purchase ratio (NPR) similar to that of Lakonishok and Lee (2001) to measure the direction of insider trading (i.e., whether they buying or selling) in a given firm-month. NPR is computed by dividing the net purchases by managers in a given month by the total number of manager transactions over the same period. Net purchases are computed by subtracting the number of sale transactions from the number of purchase transactions in a given month. In our sample, 44 percent of firm-month observations contain only one transaction. Further, the majority of transactions are insider sales. Table 2 shows that the third quartile of the NPR distribution is negative, indicating that in at least 75 percent of firm-months, managers sell more often than buy. Our sample contains 10,281 firm-months with more buy than sell transactions and 36,985 firm-months with more sell than buy transactions. Lakonishok and Lee (2001) using management transactions from the ORS database between 1975 and 1995 find 1.7 times more sell transactions than buy transactions. We have relatively more sell transactions because we use a later time period (1982-1997). Option and stock-based compensation has increased over time. We expect selling to increase over time as managers attempt to diversify the increasing large percentages of their wealth held in their company's securities.  \n\n## 5. Results  \n\n### 5.1. Correlation analysis  \n\nPearson and Spearman correlation coefficients presented in Table 3 show that the different information sources are correlated.16 For example, we find that both analyst following and the number of news releases about a firm are higher when financial statements are less value relevant. This finding is consistent with the intuition that growth firms tend to have less informative financial statements, but are more news worthy and attract greater interest. This negative correlation suggests that either (1) analyst following and news coverage substitute for financial statement information or (2) the resources devoted to analysis increase as financial statements become less informative. In either case, this result suggests that, in terms of investor informativeness, financial statements and analyst following or news coverage offset each other (i.e., they are substitutes).17 Consequently, we must jointly control for these factor to determine the marginal effects of each.  \n\nIn contrast to the negative correlation between financial statements and other information sources, the results in Table 3 show that analyst following and firm news coverage are positively correlated. This correlation suggests that these information sources are complementary. One interpretation is that our news measure, LnNews, can proxy for investor interest in a company. Analysts may find more demand for their services in cases of higher investor interest and begin following these firms. However, if news coverage subsumes analyst forecast revisions, then the results merely reflect a mechanical relation between these two sources. To control for this possibility, we created a similar news variable using only firm-specific announcements from PR Newswire and Business Wire. Firms use these services to make public announcements. Though not as strong, the correlation between this news variable and analyst following continues to be significantly positive, suggesting that the two sources are complementary. The Pearson correlation is 0.40.18 This result is not surprising given the high correlation between LnNews and a yearly article-count measure comprised only of news announcements from PR Newswire and Business Wire. The Pearson and Spearman correlations between these two news measures are 0.84 and 0.81, respectively.  \n\nCorrelations among variables This table provides the value of the correlation between each of the variables used in subsequent tests. Spearman (Pearson) correlations are above (below) the diagonal. To be included in this table, a firm-month observation must be accompanied by suffcient data to compute the variables displayed below. Therefore, the statistics for all variables are based on 47,266 firm-month observations. Firm-months with no management trading activity are excluded because NPR cannot be computed.

We create a variable, Mfind, equal to one if the firm issued a management forecast in a given year and zero otherwise. The First Call management forecast database is used to construct this variable. Controlling for firm size, we find no significant relation between LnNews and Mfind. These results indicate that earnings forecasts are unlikely to be a correlated omitted variable that confounds the interpretation of our LnNewsresults.  \n\n### 5.2. Predictive ability of insider trades  \n\nWe first provide descriptive evidence on the univariate relation between the predictive ability of insider trades and our information environment variables. These results are shown in Table 4. In each firm-month containing insider trades, we form three portfolios based on NPR. Firm-months are placed into the ‘High’ NPR portfolio if NPR is equal to one and into the “Low' NPR portfolio if NPR is equal to negative one. All remaining firm-months containing insider trades are placed in the 'Medium’ NPR portfolio. Firm-months are also classified into three categories on thebasisof $R^{\\bar{2}}$ , analyst following, and news stories in panels A, B, and C, respectively. This three-by-three independent sort produces nine portfolios in each panel and we measure the returns on each of these portfolios over the next six months. We expect high NPR portfolios to produce higher returns than low NPR portfolios. Consistent with prior results (e.g., Seyhun, 1998), we find the High NPR portfolio outperforms the Low NPR portfolios by 8.7 percent over the subsequent sixmonths.  \n\nPanel A shows that the differences between High NPR portfolios and Low NPR portfolios are not monotonically decreasing in $\\overset{\\cdot}{R}^{2}$ .Similarly, Panel B shows no monotonic relation between high and low NPR portfolio returns differences and analyst following categories. In contrast, Panel C provides evidence that the predictive ability of insider trades is decreasing in news. However, given the correlation among these information-environment variables as well as the need to control for other potentially correlated-omitted variables, we are reluctant to draw conclusions from these results and view them as descriptive statistics.  \n\nWe present the main regression results of our study in Table 5. In our analysis of the relation between insider trading profits and information availability, the following regression model is estimated for all observations with manager trades  \n\nTable 4   \nReturns for portfolios formed based on insider trading, accounting $R^{2}$ , analyst following, and news This table presents average six-month portfolio returns. Observations are shown in parentheses. We construct portfolios each month of the sample period based on the net purchase ratio (NPR) of the firm in the prior month and another firm characteristic. Firms are placed into the “High\" NPR category if $N P R=1$ , the “Medium\" NPR category if $-1<N P R<1$ , and “Low NPR category if $N P R=-1$ Returns are the six-month buy and hold return adjusted for the Fama-French $5\\times5$ size and book-tomarket portfolio return. In panel A, we form portfolios based on $N P R$ and $R^{2}$ . In panel B, we form portfolios based on NPR and LnAnalyst. In panel C, we form portfolios based on $N P R$ and LnNews. The sample period is 1982-1997.  \n\nPanel A:NPR-R2   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"3\">R2</td><td></td></tr><tr><td

We eliminate observations with duplicate dependent variables by using only the last transaction for any given firm-month.20  \n\nThe LnHold variable is included to control for cross-sectional variation in the stock holdings of management-insiders. Individuals may be motivated to trade for reasons other than private information. These reasons could include changes in risk preferences, consumption preferences, or wealth. If these reasons vary systematically with information availability, they may act as correlated-omitted variables. For example, insiders may trade as a result of their option or stock-based incentive compensation. Furthermore, this compensation may be tied to the level of information asymmetry between firm managers and investors. If insiders receive more stock compensation when information asymmetry is low, they may choose to sell more stock to diversify their holdings.2l Thus, we could find a relation between information asymmetry and the predictive ability of insider trades that is driven by the firm's compensation plan instead of the characteristics of its information environment. We control for this effect by creating a control variable for the stock holdings of insiders. For each firm-month observation, we compute the average market value of stock holdings across all management/officer trades for that firm. We include the log of this variable (LnHold) as an interactive term in our analysis.  \n\nThe correlation results in Table 3 suggest that return variance, StdRet, can act as a correlated omitted variable. It is significantly correlated with LnNews, $R^{2}$ and, LnAnalyst. Moreover, return variance is potentially related to the profitability of insider trades. Given a manager can correctly (on average) predict the sign of future abnormal returns, an increase in the return variance implies an increase in the manager's expected payoff. Results in Table 5 confirm this result. The coefficient on the StdRet interaction term (i.e., StdRet $\\times\\:\\:N P R)$ is significantly positive implying the profitability of insider trades is increasing in return variance. This result does not necessarily imply \\*abnormal'' profits are available to insider in higher variance firms. If insiders cannot hedge their bets, the risks of trading on inside information will also be higher in these circumstances.  \n\nThe coefficient on NPR in Table 5 is significantly positive in the regression. It means that insider buying earns significantly higher returns than insider selling. We interact the three information environment variables with NPR to determine their marginal effects on the ability of managers’ trades to predict returns. The coefficient On the $R^{2}$ interactive term is significantly negative indicating that more informative financial statements tend to reduce insider trading profits. However, the significance of the $R^{2}$ interactive term is eliminated by the addition of StdRet, suggesting the explanatorypower of $R^{2}$ is in part driven the its correlation with StdRet.  \n\nThe coefficient on the analyst following interaction term is significantly negative in all specifications. The ability of insiders’ trades to predict future returns is reduced for firms with larger analyst following. Further, this effect is incremental to firm size. Indeed, while the LnM V interaction term is significant in a univariate regression, it is insignificant in the presence of our information environment variables. Thus these information environment variables seem to better proxy for the underlying factors leading to cross-sectional variation in the predictive ability of insider trades than firm Size.  \n\nThe effect of news reports on insider profits is positive but insignificant after controlling for variance. Insider profits tend to increase when more news is generated about their firms. However, like $R^{2}$ , this effect also seems to be related to an association between return variance and news. Untabulated regression results indicate that conditional on $L n M V,$ . LnNews is positively correlated with return variance. More news is associated with greater return variance and the insignificance of the coefficient on the news interaction term when StdRet is included in the regression suggests that this variance (or uncertainty) effect is driving the relation between news coverage and the profitability of insider trades.  \n\nIn addition, we find that the coefficient on the insider holdings interactive term is positive and marginally significant indicating that information asymmetry is larger in situations where managers hold more stock. This result indicates that increased stock/option compensation is associated with greater information asymmetry. It can also indicate that information asymmetry is larger in situations where stock is closely held.  \n\nWe include market-to-book and research and development variables in our regressions as indicators of the informativeness of financial statements. Companies with high market-to-book ratios and research and development expenditures tend to have relatively more unrecorded assets. We find no significant relation between these variables and insider trading profits.  \n\nIn addition to these interactive effects two main effects are notable. First, firms with greater prior insider holdings are associated with higher future abnormal returns. When insiders trade, returns are more likely to positive when these insiders hold more stock. This result suggests a trading strategy that warrants future investigation. Second, when firms have high $R^{2}$ , future returns are likely to be negative. Given the construction of our $R^{2}$ measure requires future as well as past prices, this result does not necessarily suggest a trading strategy.  \n\n### 5.3. Insider trading intensity  \n\nOur next tests use trading frequency as a proxy for the extent of insider trading profits. We estimate the following regression model:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{T R A N S=\\alpha+\\beta_{1}R^{2}+\\beta_{2}L n N e w s+\\beta_{3}L n A n a l y s t+\\beta_{4}L n M V+\\beta_{5}L n H o l d Y R}}\\ {{+\\beta_{6}S t d R e t+\\beta_{7}M B+\\beta_{8}R d i n d+\\varepsilon,~(3-\\alpha)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere TRANS is the number of transactions in year $t$ and LnHold YR is the log of the average market value stock holdings across all management/officer trading in year t-1.22  \n\nEach observation corresponds to one firm-year. TRANS, $R^{2}$ ,LnNews, LnAnalyst, LnMV, LnHold, StdRet, and $M B$ are measured by firm by year. The results are shown in Table 6.  \n\nWe focus on buy transactions. In contrast to sell transactions, buy transactions are less likely to occur because of liquidity and portfolio rebalancing reasons. Thus buy transactions are more likely to reflect trading motivated by the insider's superior information. The coefficient on $R^{2}$ is significantly negative indicating that buying activity is significantly lower in high $\\bar{R^{2}}$ firms. In addition, the number of buy transactions is significantly lower for firms with a larger analyst following. These results are consistent with the presence of lower information asymmetry in situations of higher analyst following and higher $R^{2}$ . There are fewer profitable trading opportunities for insiders in such firms. Interestingly, buying activity is higher in high-news situations. Insiders also trade more often in these “high-news’ firms.  \n\nTaken together, the results in Tables 5 and 6 indicate that the trades of insiders in firms with large analyst following are less profitable and less frequent. If analyst following proxies for resources devoted into private information collection, this finding is consistent with less information asymmetry when more resources are devoted to private information collection.  \n\n$T R A N S=\\alpha+\\beta_{1}R^{2}+\\beta_{2}L n N e w s+\\beta_{3}L n A n a l y s t+\\beta_{4}L n M V+\\beta_{5}L n H o l d y r+\\beta_{6}M B+\\beta_{7}R d i n d+\\alpha_{1}R e a d,i f$ This table presents the time-series means of coefficients and adjusted $R^{2}\\mathrm{s}$ produced by 17 yearly crosssectional regressions using the model shown above.

Robustness checks using bid-ask spread  \n\nTo provide additional evidence that our insider trading measures and information environment variables are related to information asymmetry, we examine their relation to bid-ask spread. Prior research has used bid-ask spread as a measure of the information asymmetry between informed and uninformed traders (e.g., Neal and Wheatley, 1998; Huang and Stroll, 1997; Easly et al., 1996; Lee et al., 1993). In Table 7, we present results on the relation between profitability of insider trades and bid-ask spread and on the relation between insider trading activity and bid-ask spread. For each firm-month, we divide observations into three portfolios on the basis of NPR and three portfolios on the basis of a bid-ask spread measure. Our bidask spread measure is computed as follows. Between 1993 and 1997, we compute the median bid-ask spread for each firm-month based on all quotes available on the Trade and Quote (TAQ) database. Panel A shows the average returns over the next six months produced by portfolios formed via this independent three by three sort. We find a monotonic relation between insider trading profits and bid-ask spread. Indeed, the difference between “High’ NPR portfolios and “Low’ NPR portfolios is almost four times higher for High' bid-ask spread firms compared to the ‘Low' bidask spread firms.  \n\nResults in Panel A also illustrate the positive relation between insider buying activity and information asymmetry. Of high bid-ask spread firm-months, 37 percent (2,559/6,918) are high NPR firm-months. In contrast, only 14 percent (974/6,902) of low bid-ask spread firm-months are high NPR firm-months. The number of high NPR firm-months is positively related to bid-ask spread.  \n\nPanel B indicates that the interactive effect between bid-ask spread and NPR is significant. Insider trading profits are increasing in bid-ask spread. We regress returns on NPR, bid-ask spread, and $N P R\\times$ bid-ask spread. The coefficient on $N P R\\times$ bid-ask spread is positive and significant. If bid-ask spread is a proxy for information asymmetry, this result provides support for the construct validity of insider trading profits as a measure for information asymmetry. The profitability of insider trades is amplified in periods of high information asymmetry (i.e., high bidaskspread).  \n\nPanel C presents results of a regression of bid-ask spread on $R^{2}$ ,LnAnalyst, LnNews, and various control variables. The results reinforce our LnAnalyst results in Tables 5 and 6. LnAnalyst is negatively related to bid-ask spread implying analyst following is negatively related to information asymmetry. Consistent with the results in Table 6, news is positively related to bid-ask spread again indicating that news coverage is positively related to information asymmetry. These results fail to confirm the relation between $R^{2}$ and information asymmetry, suggesting that the relation between financial statement informativeness and information asymmetry is weak and/or sensitive to the proxy for information asymmetry.  \n\nAdditional sensitivity analysis. We examine the sensitivity of the Table 5 results to variation in the return window and the number of insiders trading. Results are qualitatively similar when Ret is defined as the Fama-French adjusted buy and hold return in the twelve months subsequent to the insider transaction. However, the analyst following/NPR interactive term becomes insignificant at a one-month return interval. When we confine our sample to firms where more that one insider is trading in a given month, the sample size shrinks and we find no association between the predictive ability of insider trades and returns.  \n\nTable 7   \nBid-ask spread, insider trading profitability, and characteristics of the firm's information environment This table presents results relating bid-ask spread to insider trading profitability and the characteristics of the firm's information environment. Panel A presents average six-month portfolio returns. Observations are shown in parenthesis. Portfolios are formed each month of the sample period based on the bid-ask spread and the NPR of the firm in the prior month. NPR is computed each firm-month as (number of purchase transactions—number of sales transactions)/(number of purchase transactions $+$ number of sales transactions). Firms are placed into the “High\" NPR category if $\\mathrm{NPR}=1$ , the“Medium'NPR category if $-1<\\mathrm{NPR}<1$ , and “Low” NPR category if $\\mathrm{{NPR}=-1}$ .Bid-AskSpread is computed each firm-month by taking the median bid-ask spread from all quotes for the firm-month recorded in the TAQ database. Returns are six-month buy and hold returns adjusted for Fama-French $5\\times5$ size and book-tomarket portfolio return. Panel B presents the time-series means of coefficients and the adjusted $R^{2}$ produced by 60 monthly cross-sectional regressions using 20,766 observations. In each month we regress returns on the three NPR and Bid-Ask Spread ranks as well as the product of these ranks. Newey-West time-series $t$ statistics are shown in parenthesis. Panel C presents the time-series mean coefficients from yearly cross-sectional regressions using 6,857 observations. In each year, we regress, Bid-Ask Spread on $R^{2}$ LnAnalyst, LnNews, and various control variables. (Please see prior tables for variable definitions.) Timeseries t-statistics are shown in parenthesis.

We use the First Call management forecast database for this analysis and define an indicator variable, Mfind, as equal to one if the firm has a management forecast in this database in the prior firm-year and zero otherwise. Unfortunately, we lose a substantial number of observations because while the insider trading database spans 17 years, the First Call database overlaps with our insider trading database in only five of these years. We repeat the Table 5 (Table 6) estimation adding a $M\\hbar n d\\times N P R$ (Mfind) term. The coefficients on these management forecast variables are insignificant.  \n\n## 6. Conclusion  \n\nThis paper analyzes the relation between key characteristics of a firm's information  environment  and information asymmetry between  managers and investors. We first analyze the relations between each of our information environment variables and find that analyst activity and news reports are reduced as the informativeness of a firm's financial statements is increased. Controlling for the potentially confounding relations among our independent variables, we find the relation between analyst following and the predictive power of insider trades is negative and statistically significant. Further, analyst following subsumes the ability of firm size to explain cross-sectional variation in the predictive ability of insider trades. Controlling for return variance, we find no significant relation news coverage (or $R^{2}.$ ) and the ability of managers’ trades to predict returns.  \n\nThese results provide evidence that increased analyst following is associated with reduced information asymmetry between managers and investors. However, the coefficients on financial statement informativeness and news in these return regressions are only marginally significant and become insignificant when we add return variation as an independent variable. We posit that these weak results are due to bounds on the profitability of insider trades. Thus we examine the frequency of information-motivated insider trading activity to provide an alternative measure of information asymmetry. We find that the frequency of insider buy transactions is significantly lower when financial statements are more informative and when more analysts follow the firm. Interestingly, increased news coverage is associated with more frequent insider buying suggesting a positive relation between news coverage and frequency of profitable trading opportunities.  \n\nThe fundamental contribution of this research is that we use insider trading profits as a measure of cross-sectional variation in information asymmetry and thus crosssectional variation in the costs of information collection. Our results indicate that analyst following, a widely used measure of resources devoted to information collection, is closely related to insider trading profits. Future research can attempt to use insider trading profits as a means to identify the drivers of information costs. Future research can also use the profitability of insider trading to examine the effect of regulation (e.g., regulation FD or new FASB standards) on the costs of information collection.  \n\n## References  \n\nAboody, D., Lev, B., 2000.

Previous research found that when current employers have better information than potential employers, the later use job assignment to infer an employed worker's qualifications. As a result, assignment of workers to jobs is inefficient. I find that when current employers can match outside offers the equilibrium outcome may be efficient despite the asymmetric information. I then analyze the effect of the asymmetric information on investment in human capital made by employers and workers, and find these investment levels to be first best.  \n\n## 1 Introduction  \n\nLabor market competition over employed workers affects firms′ practices and compensation policies. It is a common practice in skilled-worker labor markets for competing firms to make offers to employed workers, and for the current employers to make counteroffers. One characteristic of competition for employed workers is that the current employer often has better information regarding the workers’ quality than do potential employers. Thus, when outside firms make offers to employed workers they use publicly observable characteristics to infer the worker's skills. Michael Waldman [1984] was the first to observe that outside firms use job assignment to infer employed workers’ qualifications, and that employers take this into consideration when they make promotional decisions.  \n\nThe goal of this paper is to analyze the effect of counteroffers on compensation policies when employers have better information about their workers' productivity than outside firms do. The ability to match outside offers is potentially important as employers have discretion regarding the quality of workers in their firms. By matching offers potential employers make, the current employer decides which workers stay in the firm based on his knowledge of a worker's productivity. In addition, I analyze the effect of the asymmetric information on investment in human capital. I find that despite the asymmetric information, the equilibrium can be efficient.  \n\nPrevious literature that analyzes the effect of asymmetric information between current and potential employers on firms’ practices found that this asymmetric information causes firms to dissipate resources in order to prevent loss of informational rents. In particular, papers that analyze the effect on promotion policies found that insufficient workers are promoted. When outside firms cannot directly observe employed workers’ abilities and skills, they use signals such as education, training, past experience, and job assignment to infer an employed worker's qualifications. Waldman [1984] showed that when employers promote workers to a higher-level job, outside firms infer that the worker is of high quality. In Waldman's model the market is competitive, firms are homogenous ex-ante, and workers are heterogenous with respect to their productivity. Firms try to raid workers assigned to high-level jobs, and make a wage offer equal to the expected marginal revenue product (MRP), conditional on the job assignment. Hence, employers promote workers to high-level jobs only if the increase in productivity exceeds the increase in the wage required to retain a worker in that job. As a result, some workers who would be more productive in high-level jobs than in low-level jobs are not promoted.2  \n\nI use a similar framework, but formally analyze competition for employed workers. When employers can match offers, the winner's curse phenomenon arises; that is, outside firms can only raid workers with a wage that exceeds the worker's value. As a result, outside firms will offer a wage equal to the lowest MRP, based on the worker's job assignment and other publicly observed characteristics (e.g., education, past experience). Although the expected marginal product of a worker who's been promoted increases, the lower bound on the worker's productivity doesn't increase; as a result, the increase in wages required to retain the worker is smaller than the increase in productivity efficient matching of workers to jobs causes. Hence, the job assignment that maximizes the output produced also maximizes the employer's profit.  \n\nI then extend the model and analyze investment in general and firmspecific human capital. Investment in human capital in the context of asymmetric information is similar to job assignment in the sense that if competing firms observe training (general and firm-specific), such training may reveal information regarding the worker's productivity. Further, if training is observable and general, it will also increase the value of the worker to the competing firms.3 Similar to promotions, investment in skills that workers and employers make in skills when they have private information conveys information to the market. In my model, unlike promotions, investment may also affect earnings. I first analyze investment in firm-specific skills. I find investment is effcient; in contrast to predictions of the standard theory (symmetric information models) in which workers do not invest in firm-specific skills, workers share investment costs with the employer. Workers invest in firm-specific skills only when it is productive to train a group of high-ability workers (and technology is common knowledge). The logic behind this result is as follows. Outside firms observe that the worker was trained, and infer that the lowest possible MRP of the worker is higher than the lowest MRP of an untrained worker. Therefore, the worker's wage increases if he is trained, although training did not make him more productive in outside firms. In equilibrium, the worker's share in investment cost is equal to the increase in wage, and the employer earns the rents. Since the worker's share in investment costs covers the future increase in wage due to training, the employer trains workers if the increase in output is expected to exceed the cost of training; hence, the equilibrium is efficient.4  \n\nThe analysis of investment in general skills is similar. The difference is that a worker is more productive in outside firms if trained. In equilibrium.  \n\nthe worker's share in investment costs is the increase in wage due to training (which is larger than in the firm-specific skills case). In contrast to the prediction of the standard theory (e.g., Becker [1975]), employers invest in general skills because they capture the rents.5 As in the case of investment in firm-specific skills, investment is efficient. The worker's share covers the increase in wages, and the employer invests if the increase in output is expected to exceed training costs.6  \n\nI then examine workers' investment in human capital prior to entering the labor market. I find that the output level in the economy is the first best level (due to efficient assignment of workers to jobs), and hence, the investment level is also a first best. Whereas wages in each period are not the expected MRP of the worker, the present value of career wages is equal to the expected output produced. This result arises because the market is competitive. The first period wages, which are determined when the information is symmetric, satisfy the condition that the expected profit from hiring a worker is zero; hence, the entry-level wages include the expected profit in the second period, and the expected sum of wages over time is equal to the expected output. Since investment made before entering the labor market maximizes lifetime earnings, it also maximizes the expected output.7 The investment level, however, is first best, and is similar to the investment level in symmetric learning case (in which information regarding the worker's productivity is symmetric) because job assignment and output level are first best.  \n\nSeveral other papers are related. Milgrom and Oster [1987] analyze a model of promotion under asymmetric information. They found that minorities who are less visible to the market are less likely to be promoted. Promotions are inefficient in their model because they assume that if a worker is promoted his actual productivity is revealed to the market, and competition for workers in high-level jobs occurs when the information is symmetric. Lazear (1986) and Greenwald (1986) analyze models of asymmetric information. They focus on the effect of the asymmetric information on mobility and do not analyze job assignment or investment in human capital. Lazear (1986) analyzes the effect of stigma of not receiving outside offers. In his model, outside firms receive private signals regarding employed workers′ productivity. Information regarding a worker's productivity is revealed in a diffused fashion to the market.8 Laing [1994] develops a model of involuntary layoffs and analyzes the properties of the optimal contract. He considers the informational content of layoffs when the employer has better information about the worker's productivity than outside firms. Gibbons and Katz [1991] test empirical implications of asymmetric information, considering the effect of layoffs on future wages.  \n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2, I describe the model. Section 3 contains equilibrium analysis, and section 4 examines investment in human capital. In section 5 I discusses the robustness of the equilibrium outcome, and section 6 concludes.  \n\n## 2 The model  \n\nThe economy: In the two-period economy, there is one good and its price is normalized to one. There is no discounting between periods. The identical risk-neutral firms compete over risk-neutral workers when workers are inexperienced, and again when outside frms try to raid employed workers. For notational simplicity, I assume there is one worker, and three firms: the employing firm, which is denoted by $e$ , two outside firms denoted by $r$ . The output of each firm is normalized to equal the worker's labor input. There are two types of jobs in each firm: a high-level and a low-level one, each requiring different skills. Employment contracts pair a wage and a job assignment, and can only be made for one period at a time (spot contracts). Output in the high-level job is unobserved and unverifiable by a third party, and contracts cannot be contingent on output. If a worker quits or is fired, he can not work for that firm again.9 The worker's productivity in the low level job, $z$ , is common knowledge. The worker produces $\\theta$ if assigned to the high-level-job. $\\theta$ is drawn from a continuous distribution $f(\\theta)$ with a lower support below $z$ . This assumption can be made weaker, but the implication of this assumption that the lower support of productivity in the high-level job is weakly lower than the lower support of productivity in the low-level job is important for the effciency result.10 I assume the expected productivity $E(\\theta)$ is sufficiently lower than $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{Z}}$ , So talent in high-skill jobs is scarce. Workers display no disutility from effort and have a reservation utility of zero; the worker's utility function is the sum of the first period wage and second period wage.  \n\nThe assumption that there is no discounting between periods is made to reduce notation. Introducing a discount factor will not change the analysis.  \n\nThe assumption that output in low-level jobs is observed publicly, is made for expositional simplicity. The second assumption, that output in high-level job is only observed by the employer, is made to generate asymmetry in information between the employer and outside firms after the first period. The assumption that the unconditional mean productivity is lower than productivity in the low-level job is made for simplicity. As a consequence of this assumption, if a firm has no information about the worker's productivity in the high-level job, it is optimal to assign the worker to the low-level job.  \n\n### 2.1  Timing and information structure of the game  \n\nThe timing of the game is described in figure 1. At the beginning of the first period, the information is symmetric, all frms and workers know $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{Z}}$ and $f(\\theta)$ and no one knows $\\theta$ . Outside firms offer the worker a contract, which is a wage and a job assignment pair. The worker decides which offer to accept. Production then takes place. Payments are made at the end of the first period.  \n\nAt the beginning of the second period, the employer and worker know $\\theta$ All firms in the market observe job assignments. If the worker is assigned to the high-level job, outside firms make simultaneous offers, and the employer makes a counteroffer.ll The worker chooses a firm, and production takes place. At the end of the second period payments are made and the worker retires.12  \n\n![](images/6e69953f18f976520789c36dfa4d88e466e60af8e4fa795f0d66e3fc0ee5be94.jpg)  \nFigure 1: The Two Period Game.  \n\n### 2.2 Strategies  \n\nThis section describes the strategies of each player.  \n\nFirst period: At the beginning of the first period, the information is symmetric and imperfect: neither party (firms and worker) observes the productivity of the worker in the high- level job. Each firm's strategy is to offer a wage and a job assignment. The worker's strategy is a choice of a firm. I denote strategies by uppercase letters (job assignment and wages) and wage and job assignment realizations by lowercase letters.  \n\nSecond period: At the beginning of the second period, the employer assigns the worker to a job. The employer knows the worker's ability to perform in both jobs. I denote the employer's job assignment as $J_{2}^{e}(\\theta)\\in\\{H,L\\}$ $J_{t}^{n}$ is a job assignment offered by firm $n$ at time $t$ ， $H$ is a high-level job assignment, and $L$ is a low-level job assignment.  \n\nAfter outside firms observe the worker's job assignment, they form beliefs regarding the productivity of the worker based on his job assignment and productivity in the low-level job. Each offer is a job assignment and a wage pair: $[W_{2}^{r}(j_{2}^{e}),J_{2}^{r}(j_{2}^{e})]$ ,where $r=1,2$  \n\nAfter observing the outside firms’ offers the employer makes a counteroffer: $W_{2}^{e}(\\theta,w_{2}^{1},w_{2}^{2})$  \n\nThe worker then observes outside firms’ wage offers, and the employer and chooses a firm to work for.  \n\n## 3 Equilibrium Analysis  \n\nThere are multiple equilibria in the model, which is a typical characteristic of signaling models. In this section, I analyze the unique equilibrium which is robust. I discuss other equilibria and robustness in section 5.  \n\nThe solution concept I use is perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE). An equilibrium consists of ex-ante uniform first period contract offers that clear the market, a second period job assignment (made by the first period employer), outside firms’ wage ofers (if the worker is assigned to high-level jobs), the first period employer's wage offer, a worker's choice of a job offer, and outside firms' beliefs about the worker's ability. I start by describing the equilibrium strategies.  \n\nSecond period Equilibrium strategies  \n\nEach worker's equilibrium strategy is to accept the highest offer and accept the current employer's offer if there is a tie. If more than one outside firm makes the highest offer, then the worker chooses an offer randomly.  \n\nThe employer's strategy is a second period job assignment and a counteroffer. The counteroffer is given by  \n\n$$\nW_{2}^{e}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{w_{2}^{M}}&{\\mathrm{if}\\theta\\geq w_{2}^{M},}\\ {x,w h e r e0\\leq x<w_{2}^{M}}&{\\mathrm{otherwise}}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nwhere $w_{2}^{M}$ is the highest offe made byan outside fm. I refer to $w_{2}^{M}$ as the \"market offer.\"  \n\nThe employer's second period job assignment is given by  \n\n$$\nJ_{2}^{e}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{H}&{\\mathrm{if}\\theta\\ge z,}\\ {L}&{\\mathrm{otherwise.}}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nThe employer assigns the worker to the job in which the worker is the most productive.  \n\nOutside firms form beliefs regarding the worker's productivity based on the worker's job assignment. Outside firms offer a worker who is assigned to a high-level job a contract of a low-level job and a wage equal to the MRP in the low-level job:  \n\n$$\n\\{W_{2}^{r}(j_{2}^{e}=H)=z,J_{2}^{r}(j_{2}^{e}=H)=L\\}.\n$$  \n\nThe beliefs are the expected MRP in the high-level job conditional on the job assignment and the productivity in that job,  \n\n$$\nE(\\theta|H).\n$$  \n\nOutside firms offer the same contract to workers assigned by the employer to low-level jobs, and the beliefs are  \n\n$$\nE(\\theta|L).\n$$  \n\n### 3.1 Equilibrium outcome  \n\nProposition 1: in equilibrium at the second period,  \n\n(a) The worker stays with the first period employer.   \n(b) If the worker is assigned to a high-level job in the second period, then outside firms’ wage offers are the worker's MRP in the low-level job assignment, $w_{2}^{M}=z$   \n(c) The second period wage is the MRP in the low-level job, $w_{2}=z$ ,regardless of the second period job assignment.   \n(d) The worker is assigned efficiently to a job in which he is the most productive:  \n\n$$\nJ_{2}^{e}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c c}{H}&{i f\\theta\\ge z,}\\ {L}&{o t h e r w i s e}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\n(e) The employer's second period informational rent is $M A X\\{0,\\theta-z\\}$ .If the worker is assigned to the low-level job, the employer's rent is zero. If the worker is assigned to the high-level job, the employer's informational rent is $\\theta-z$ , which is positive.  \n\nProof: See appendix A. Below is an intuitive discussion.  \n\nThe current employer's offer (equation 1) maximizes his profit. Since the worker chooses the highest offer and stays with the current employer if there is a tie, the lowest wage that enables the employer to retain the worker is the outside firm's offer. If the market wage exceeds the worker's MRP, however, offering a lower wage than the market wage yields a higher payoff than retaining the worker and paying a wage that exceeds the worker's MRP. This strategy implies that outside firms will only be able to raid an employed worker with a wage that exceeds his MRP.  \n\nThe offer in equation (3) maximizes the outside firm's profit. To see that, notice that outside firms can only raid an employed worker with a wage higher than the worker's MRP. Therefore, any offer that yields zero expected profit is optimal (because of competition, outside firms offers will not be below $z$ 一  \n\nOutside firms form beliefs of the worker's MRP in the high-level job. The information available to these firms is the job assignment and the productivity in the low-level job. Interestingly, the expected productivity of a worker does not affect the wage offers outside firms make. This is because it is optimal for an outside frm to offer a wage that is the lowest MRP of the worker, provided the worker is assigned to a high-level job in the second period. The information a promotion reveals to outside firms is that the worker is more productive in the high-level job than in the low-level job, that is, $\\theta\\geq z$ . The beliefs should satisfy bayes' law. The beliefs in equation 4 are consistent with the employer's strategy and satisfy bayes' law.  \n\nThe employer assigns the worker to the job he is most productive. It is key to the efficient job assignment of workers to jobs that the employer can match outside offers. If an outside firm makes the last offer, the wage is the expected MRP conditional on job assignment (and other observable characteristics). Retaining a promoted worker, therefore, requires wage increases. In Waldman [1984] job assignment is inefficient because the increase in wages exceeds the increase in MRP of some workers who are more productive in the high-level job.13 Thus, if the employer makes the final the offer, outside firms suffer from the winner's curse. That is, a raided worker's MRP is always lower than the wage required to raid him. As a result, promotion does not increase the market value of an employed worker.14 Since assigning workers to jobs according to their comparative advantage is not costly to the employer, and since the employer gains any surplus produced above the market value, profit maximization coincides with output maximization, which implies that workers are assigned to jobs efficiently.  \n\nTo summarize, the equilibrium is constrained Pareto efficient. I do not compare the equilibrium obtained to the full information case; instead, the benchmark is an allocation that maximizes total welfare, given the information available to all players. In the economy the total surplus is the total output produced.  \n\n### 3.2 First Period Equilibrium Wages  \n\nAt the beginning of the first period the information is symmetric. Each firm offers a contract of a job assignment and a wage, and the worker chooses a firm.  \n\nProposition 2: in equilibrium, in the first period:  \n\n(a) An ex-ante uniform contract of a low-level job assignment and a wage isoffered:  \n\n$$\nW_{1}=z+E_{\\theta}[M A X\\{\\theta-z,0\\}]\n$$  \n\n(b) The market clearing condition is satisfied and each firm earns zero erpected profit (over the two periods).  \n\nProof:  \n\nClearly, offering the worker a lower wage than the wage described in equation (6) is not a profitable deviation, since a firm will not be able to hire a worker with a wage lower than the competitive wage. Ofering a higher wage than the competitive wage is not a profitable deviation, since the expected profit the competitive wage yields is zero (over the two periods). It suffices to show two things. First, the expected profit the first period contract combined with the expected profit the second period contract yield zero. Second, in each period the wage is such that the worker's utility exceeds the reservation  \n\nutility.  \n\nThe expected profit a frm earns if it hires a worker (in both periods) is  \n\n$$\nE\\Pi^{e}=(z-w_{1})+\\int M A X\\{0,\\theta-z\\}f(\\theta)d\\theta\n$$  \n\nThe first term, $z-w_{1}$ , is the profit in the first period. The second term is the expected profit in the second period. In the second period the worker is assigned to the job in which he is more productive, and hence, the employer's expected profit in the second period is $\\begin{array}{r l}{\\int M A X\\{z,\\theta\\}f(\\theta)d\\theta-z}\\end{array}$ .By construction, the first period contract in equation (6) yields zero expected profit. The wages in the first and second period are positive and hence exceed the reservation utility. Therefore, the first period contract satisfies the market clearing condition.  \n\nQ.E.D  \n\nIn the model, workers experience wage decline after the first period. This is due to competition, and is a typical feature of asymmetric learning models. Since employers earn informational rents in the second period, the first period wage includes the future expected information rent, and employers earn zero expected profits.15 This model, however, is simple and does not include on-the-job training (in which workers accumulate general human capital). Extending the model to include on-the-job training will tend to make ageearning profiles upwards sloping.16  \n\nThe first period can be interpreted as a “test\" period in which the employee is trained, and in which the employer gains information about whether the inexperienced employee is qualified for the high-level job. In this period the profit, $z-w_{1}$ , is negative and offsets the positive expected informational rent of the second period. Since a firm earns zero expected profit over the two periods, workers receive the entire surplus. Suppose that workers have different initial observable skills $z_{i}$ which are uncorrelated with productivity in the high-level job.17 Denote the portion the employer's profit due to the expected informational rent (note that the employer's profit is positive only if the worker is promoted) by $\\Delta(z_{i})$  \n\n$$\n\\Delta(z_{i})=\\int_{z_{i}}f(\\theta)\\theta d\\theta-z_{i}\\int_{z_{i}}f(\\theta)d\\theta\n$$  \n\nThe derivative of $\\Delta(z_{i})$ is negative.  \n\nThe informational rent declines because the probability of promotion declines and because the wage in the high-level job increases.  \n\nThe fact that the wage in the high-level job is increasing in $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{Z}}$ although the MRP in the high-level job is uncorrelated with $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{Z}}$ can be a rationale for why firms prefer not to hire “overqualified\" workers: \"overqualified\" worker does not necessarily mean the worker is expected to be more productive, but that he has other skills, that may be irrelevant to the productivity in this job.18 The reason the wage is larger although the worker is expected to be as productive as other less qualified (in different jobs) workers is that once hired, outside frms expect the worker to be at least as productive in the current job as he is in other jobs. For example, consider two workers who are expected to be equally productive in the job but have other skills that may be uncorrelated with the skills required for the specific jobs. The wage of the overqualified worker will be larger if he is promoted after the first period. Further, since both workers have skills required in other jobs, it is less likely that these workers will be more productive in the job the employer seeks to fill. Put differently, workers who have more qualifications, even if they are irrelevant to the job, may have higher outside options than workers with fewer skills. Therefore, they are paid higher wages even if they are less productive. As a result, if such a worker is expected to be as productive as workers with fewer qualifications, employers earn lower rents.  \n\n## 4 Investment in human capital  \n\nInvestment in skills employers and workers make when they have private information regarding the worker's skills conveys information to the market. In the previous section I showed that although job assignments convey information regarding a worker productivity and skills, job assignment does not affect wages, and employers promote workers efficiently. Investment in skills, however, can potentially affect earnings. Whereas job assignment did not affect wages, training a group of workers can potentially increase earnings. The difference is that promotion of workers did not change the lower bounds on a worker's productivity since it is profitable to promote a worker if he is more productive in the high-level job. If it is only productive to train some workers (for example, the increase in productivity due to training exceeds the costs of training of only high ability workers), then potentially the lower bound on the productivity of a worker who was trained exceeds the lower bound on the ability of a worker who was not.  \n\nI will show next that although trained workers will experience increase in earnings, workers are trained efficiently. The cost of investment are shared by the employer and the worker. I provide analysis for the case in which skills are general and for the case in which skills are firm-specific.  \n\n### 4.1 Firm-Specific Skills  \n\nI extend the basic model in the following way. Assume that after learning the worker's productivity in the high-level job, the employer decides whether to train the worker, and proposes a fee $(p_{w})$ . The worker has to agree, otherwise he is not trained. Training takes place before the beginning of the second period, and outside firms can observe whether the worker was trained. As before, the information available to outside firms is the job assignment. For simplicity, assume training is only productive in the high-level job. If a worker is trained, his productivity increases by $\\Delta(\\theta)$ , and $\\Delta(\\theta)$ is increasing in $\\theta$ . The cost of investment $C(\\theta)$ depends on the worker's productivity. $\\Delta(\\theta)-C(\\theta)$ is increasing in $\\theta$ and there exists $\\theta_{*}>0$ such that $\\Delta(\\theta_{*})-C(\\theta_{*})=0$ 19 Outside firms observe whether a worker is trained, but cannot observe the increase in productivity or the cost (as both the costs and the increase in productivity are a function of $\\theta$ , which is only observed by the worker and the employer). Notice that the wage the employer pays during training has to be such that the worker agrees to participate in training. I interpret the wage reduction a worker is willing to take as the worker's share in the investment cost and denote it by $p_{w}$ . Assume that outside firms observe $p_{w}$  \n\nThe efficient investment rule is to invest if the increase in productivity exceeds investment costs, $\\Delta(\\theta)-C(\\theta)>0$  \n\nProposition 5:  \n\nIf the increase in productivity is due to firm-specific skills then:  \n\n1. The wage of a worker in a high-level job that was trained is $m a x\\{z,\\theta_{*}\\}$   \n2. the employer trains a workers if  \n\n$$\n\\Delta(\\theta)\\geq C(\\theta)\n$$  \n\n3. Investment cost is shared: the employer's share is $C(\\theta)-m a x\\{\\theta_{*}-z,0\\}$ and the worker's share is $m a x\\{\\theta_{*}-z,0\\}$  \n\nProof: The employer's strategy to train workers efficiently is optimal. The profit if the worker is not trained is, $\\theta-z$ . The profit if the worker is trained is the output produced by a trained worker net of investment cost payed by the employer and the wage:  \n\n$\\theta+\\Delta(\\theta)-C(\\theta)+m a x\\{\\theta_{*}-z,0\\}-m a x\\{\\theta_{*},z\\}$ . This equals $\\theta+\\Delta(\\theta)-$ $C(\\theta)-z$ . If the worker is not trained, the profit is $\\theta-z$ . Clearly, it is profitable to train workers efficiently ( $\\theta\\geq C(\\theta),$ ). The wage during training (or worker's share of investment costs) maximizes the employer's payoff, as it is the lowest wage the worker will agree to receive and still participate in training.  \n\nWorkers are indifferent about being trained or not being trained. If trained, a worker's earnings net of investment cost is $m a x\\{\\theta_{*},z\\}-m a x\\{\\theta_{*}-z,0\\}=z$ . If not trained, the worker earns $z$ as well.  \n\nOutside firms’ strategy is to offer the MRP of the least productive worker in each group: $\\operatorname*{max}\\{\\theta_{*},z\\}$ if a worker is trained and $z$  \n\nQ.E.D  \n\nThe current employer makes the last offer. The results do not change, however, if outside frms observe the employer's offer before making their own offers (any process besides the process in which the employer can not match outside offers will yield the same result). The reason again is that wages will not reflect information beyond that which training provides.20  \n\nWages in the model are the lower bound on the worker's MRP. When the entire increase in productivity is firm specific, the increase in wage is only due to the fact that training signals the worker's ability is above the minimal ability that makes training productive.  \n\nIn contrast to symmetric information models, investment in firm-specific skills increases earnings. Therefore, workers invest in firm-specific skills. Workers' share in the investment cost is the increase in wage due to training.  \n\nAs a result, the employer captures all the rents and faces only the true cost of investment. Investment therefore maximizes the net benefit of training (increase in output net of cost of training).  \n\n### 4.2 Investment in general skills  \n\nThe model is similar to the previous model. The only difference is that $\\Delta(\\theta)$ is increase in general skills. In contrast to symmetric information models, employers earn rents even if investment develops general skills. As a result, employers invest in workers? general human capital.  \n\nProposition 6: If the increase in productivity is due to general skills: $\\mathit{1}$ . The wage of a worker in a high-level job that was trained is $m a x\\{z,\\theta_{*}\\}+$ $\\Delta(m a x\\{z,\\theta_{*}\\})$   \n$\\mathcal{Q}$ . the employer trains a worker if $\\Delta(\\theta)\\geq C(\\theta)$   \n3. Investment cost is shared: the employer's share is $C(\\theta)-m a x\\{\\theta_{*}-z,0\\}-$ $\\Delta(m a x\\{z,\\theta_{*}\\})$ and the worker's share is $m a x\\{\\theta_{*}-z,0\\}+\\Delta(m a x\\{z,\\theta_{*}\\})$  \n\nProof: The employer's strategy to train workers efficiently is optimal. Profit from an untrained worker is $\\theta-z$ . The employer's profit if the worker is trained is: θ+△(0)-C(0)+max{0\\*-z,0}+△(max{z,0\\*})-max{2,0\\*}+ $\\Delta(m a x\\{z,\\theta_{*}\\})$ . The profit if the worker is not trained is $\\theta-z$ . It is profitable, therefore, to train workers efficiently (equation 8).  \n\nWorkers are indifferent about being trained or not being trained. If trained, a worker's earnings net of investment cost is  \n\n$$\nm a x\\{\\theta_{*},z\\}-m a x\\{\\theta_{*}-z,0\\}=z\n$$  \n\nIf not trained, he earns $z$ as well.  \n\nOutside firms’ strategy to offer $\\operatorname*{max}\\{\\theta_{*},z\\}$ if a worker is trained and $z$ if not, is optimal. These are the MRP of the least productive worker in each group.  \n\nQ.E.D  \n\nThe difference between investment in general and firm-specific skills is that the increase in a worker's wage is due to both the lower bound on the fundamental ability and the actual increase in productivity. Hence, the increase in wage is larger. The worker share is the increase in wage due to investment and therefore, the employer captures all the rents.  \n\n### 4.3 Workers’ investment in human capital  \n\nIn previous sections I provide \"short-term” analysis, in the sense that $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{Z}}$ is exogenous. I show next that investment workers make before they enter the labor market is first-best.  \n\nInvestment made before the worker enters the labor market is first-best because output is first-best and due to competition. Although wages in each period are not the expected MRP of a worker, competition for inexperienced workers imposes zero expected profit over the two periods. As a result, lifetime earnings is the expected output produced over the worker's career. Since investment in skills made before they enter the labor market maximize workers’ lifetime earnings net of investment costs, it also maximizes the expected output net of investment costs. Output level is first-best due to efficient assignment of workers to job; as a result, investment level is first best.  \n\nI extend the basic model and include investment in skills. Before entering the labor market, the worker can invest in skills required in the low-level job. For simplicity assume the worker investment determines the productivity of the worker in the low-level job, $z$ .21 $c(z)$ is the cost of acquiring skill level of $z$ (the cost is increasing in $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{Z}}$  \n\nAn efficient investment in $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{Z}}$ maximizes the social benefit (SB). The social benefit is the sum of the output produced in the first period (in the low-level job) added to the output produced in the second period (in which the worker is assigned either to a low or a high-level job) minus investment costs:  \n\n$$\nS B(z)=z+E_{\\theta\\vert z}[M A X\\{\\theta,z\\}]-c(z)\n$$  \n\nThe worker maximizes the sum of the expected wages net of investment costs. The first period wage, $z+E_{\\theta\\vert z}[M A X\\{\\theta-z,0\\}]$ , has two components: the MRP in the low-level job, and the expected value of the employer's informational rent. The second period wage is the MRP in the low-level job $z$ , regardless of the worker's job assignment:  \n\n$$\nW_{1}(z)+W_{2}(z)=z+E_{\\theta\\vert z}[M A X\\{\\theta-z,0\\}]+z-c(z)\n$$  \n\nProposition 7: Worker investment is efficient (investment macimizes the social benefit.) Proof: Immediate. The social benefit and total earnings are equal .  \n\n## 5 Robustness  \n\nThis section discusses the robustness of the equilibrium outcome and extends the analysis.  \n\n### 5.1 The structure of the game  \n\nA key result is that wages are the lower bound on the worker's productivity conditional on information available to outside firms (job assignment). Efficient job assignment is achieved because in the model the lower bound on the worker's productivity doesn't change when job assignment changes, although the expected MRP may change.22  \n\nThere are two job levels to capture the idea that different jobs involve different tasks which may require different skills. The assumption that productivity in the low-level job is constant and publicly observed (therefore, it is uncorrelated with productivity in the high-level job) is for convenience.23 If outside frms cannot observe productivity in the low-level job, the wage offered to workers in the low-level job is the lower bound on the worker's productivity $\\mathcal{Z}$ . The effcient promotion rule is to promote a worker if $\\theta\\geq z$ and the outside offers to workers in high-level jobs are $\\boldsymbol{\\underline{{\\boldsymbol{z}}}}$ .24  \n\n### 5.2 Uniqueness  \n\nThere is a continuum of P.B.E. in the model. The source of multiplicity of equilibria is that outside firms can (correctly) believe that only workers for which the productivity in the high-level job exceeds a threshold level $\\theta_{*}$ are promoted. Therefore, outside firms offer a promoted worker a wage of  \n\n$$\nw_{2}^{M}=M A X[\\theta_{*},z]\n$$  \n\nThe beliefs are  \n\n$$\n{\\hat{\\theta}}(H)={\\frac{\\int_{m a x[\\theta_{*},z]}\\theta f(\\theta)d\\theta}{\\int_{m a x[\\theta_{*},z]}f(\\theta)d\\theta}}\n$$  \n\nIt is profitable then for the employer to promote a worker according to the following rule25:  \n\n$$\nJ_{2}^{e}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c l}{H}&{\\mathrm{if}\\theta\\geq M A X[\\theta_{*},z],}\\ {L}&{\\mathrm{otherwise}}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nPromoting a worker with $\\theta_{*}>\\theta>z$ , although efficient, will result in separation of the worker and the first period employer. Therefore, outside frm beliefs satisfy bayes’ law. All workers with $z<\\theta<\\theta_{*}$ are assigned inefficiently to low-level jobs.  \n\nProposition 3:  \n\nIn nearby games in which employers make mistakes in promotional decisions with an arbitrarily small probability, the only equilibrium outcome is the one described in proposition 1 (effcient equilibrium).  \n\nFirst, I show that any wage offer that is made by outside firms and exceeds $z$ yields negative expected profit, and therefore, there are no equilibria of the type described above in nearby games. Then I show that offering $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{Z}}$ is an equilibrium.26  If outside firms offer $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{Z}}$ in equilibrium, the proof that the equilibrium outcome is as described in proposition 1 is identical to the proof in the original game.  \n\nThe reason that in nearby games no outside firm offers a wage that exceeds $z$ is that any such offer yields negative expected payoff; offering a wage $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{Z}}$ and a low-level job contract yields zero expected payoff. More formally, assume there is an exogenous and arbitrarily small probability $\\epsilon>0$ thatthe employer promotes a worker with ability $\\theta<\\theta_{*}$  \n\nClaim 1: Any offer an outside firm makes that satisfies $w_{2}^{r}>z$ yields a negative expected payoff.  \n\nProof: The employer's strategy is given by equations 12, and 1. The worker's strategy is similar to the strategy in the original game. The expected payoff of an outside firm is  \n\n$$\n\\Pi^{r}(w_{2}^{r},H)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{\\theta-\\theta_{*}}&{\\mathrm{if}\\:\\:w_{2}^{e}<w_{2}^{r},}\\ {0}&{\\mathrm{otherwise}.}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nIf $\\theta\\geq\\theta_{*}$ , the employer will match the offer and the outside firm's expected payoff is zero. If $\\theta<\\theta_{*}$ , the expected payoff for an outside firm is $\\left(\\theta-\\theta_{*}\\right)<0$  \n\nTherefore, the expected payoff is:  \n\n$$\n\\Pi^{l}=\\epsilon(\\theta-\\theta_{\\ast})<0\n$$  \n\nClaim $\\mathcal{L}$ : An outside frm's offer of a low-level job assignment and a wage equal to the MRP in the low-level job, yields zero profit.  \n\nProof: Immediate. Given the employer's counteroffer strategy (equation 1), the employer will match the offer, and the worker rejects the outside offer.  \n\nTo summarize, the difference between the payoff in nearby games and the original game is that in the original game the probability that $\\theta<\\theta_{*}$ is zero. Since an offer of a low-level job and a wage equals the MRP in the low-level job always yields zero profit, no equilibrium in which the outside firms offer a wage larger than $z$ exists. Since the worker's outside offers are $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{Z}}$ ,regardless of the job assignment, the only optimal job assignment strategy is to assign workers to jobs they are most productive.  \n\n### 5.3 Infinite horizon sequential offers game  \n\nThe proofs of the previous results hinge on the assumption that the employer makes the final offer. The equilibrium outcome depends, however, on the ability to match offers rather than on the ability to make the final offer. The employer has private information regarding the worker's MRP, and he matches outside offers only if the worker's MRP exceeds the outside offer. As a result, outside firms can only raid a worker with a wage greater than the worker's MRP. This logic holds as long as the employer can match outside offers. The employer, if interested in retaining the worker, offers the lowest wage required to do so. Hence, unless an outside offer exceeds the worker's MRP, the employer's counteroffer is similar to the outside offer. Since outside firms cannot elicit further information observing the employer's counteroffers and successfully raid a worker, they will not match the employer's counteroffer. As a result, the employer makes the final offer in equilibrium, and the equilibrium outcome is similar to the equilibrium outcome in the finite horizon game in which the employer makes the final offer.  \n\nI generalize the basic model and allow each firm to match offers without assuming that there is a final round of offers and counteroffers. The extended model is similar to an ascending auction held by the worker. Apart from modelling the offers and counteroffers as an infinite horizon process, the extended game is similar to the finite horizon game. The employer offers a job assignment and a wage at the end of the first period, and outside firms make an offer after observing the job assignment. The employer then makes a counteroffer, and firms in the market observe the offer and decide whether to raise the previous ofer. I assume a firm cannot offer a wage lower than the wage in its previous offer, and if a firm offers a high-level job, it can not offer a low-level job later.27 The offers are observed by all players. If both the employer and outside firms do not raise their previous offers, the worker chooses one of the offers. $w_{l}^{M}$ is the highest outside offer a worker receives in round l, where l = 1, 2, ....  \n\nI denote the wage offer that the employer makes to its worker in round $l$ by $w_{l}^{\\mathrm{{e}}}$ . The first round of offers takes place at the beginning of the second period and is denoted by $l=1$ . The employer makes offers in odd rounds, and outside firms make offers in even rounds.  \n\n### 5.4 Equilibrium strategies  \n\nThe worker's strategy is to accept the highest wage offer. If the highest outside offer and the employer's offer are equal, the worker accepts the employer's offer. This is the equilibrium strategy for any history in any round.  \n\nThe employer's strategy is a job assignment at the end of the first period, and wage offers in odd rounds. At the end of the frst period, the employer  \n\nassigns the worker to the job in which he is most productive:  \n\n$$\nJ_{2}^{e}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{H}&{\\mathrm{if}\\quad\\theta\\geq z,}\\ {L}&{\\mathrm{otherwise}}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nWage offers are given by $w_{1}^{e}=z$ , and for $l>2$  \n\n$$\nw_{l}^{e}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{w_{(l-1)}^{M}}&{\\mathrm{if~}\\theta>w_{(l-1)}^{M}}\\ {w_{(l-2)}^{e}}&{\\mathrm{otherwise}}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nIn every round, outside firms' strategy is to match the highest offer in the history (if it exceeds $z$ ). Otherwise, outside firms offer $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{Z}}$ . I describe formally the \"market” offer and beliefs below. are follows. Denote the wage offers' history in round $l$ by $h^{l}$ . Consider a worker who is assigned to a high-level job. In the first round (of the second period), $l=2$ , the offer is given by the following equations:  \n\nIf $w_{1}^{e}\\leq z$ , then:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\{J_{2}^{M}=L,W_{2}^{M}=z\\},b e l i e f s:\\hat{\\theta}_{2}=E(\\theta|h^{2})=\\frac{\\int_{z}\\theta f(\\theta)d\\theta}{\\int_{z}f(\\theta)d\\theta}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIf $w_{1}^{e}>z$ the offer is given by  \n\n$$\n\\{J_{2}^{M}=H,W_{l}^{M}=w_{1}^{e}\\},b e l i e f s:\\hat{\\theta}_{2}=E(\\theta|h^{2})=\\frac{\\int_{w_{1}^{e}}\\theta f(\\theta)d\\theta}{\\int_{w_{1}^{e}}f(\\theta)d\\theta}\n$$  \n\nIn any round, $l>2$ outside firms offers are given by the following equations:  \n\n1. If $w_{l-1}^{e}\\leq w_{l-2}^{M}$ and $j_{l-2}^{M}=L$ ,thena. If $w_{l-2}^{M}=z$ ：  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\{J_{l}^{M}=L,W_{l}^{M}=w_{l-2}^{M}\\}{b e l i e f s:\\hat{\\theta}_{l}}=E(\\theta|h^{l})=\\frac{\\int_{z}\\theta f(\\theta)d\\theta}{\\int_{z}f(\\theta)d\\theta}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nb. If $w_{l-2}^{M}>z$  \n\n$$\n\\{J_{l}^{M}=H,W_{l}^{M}=w_{l-2}^{M}\\}b e l i e f s:\\hat{\\theta}_{l}=E(\\theta|h^{l})=\\frac{\\int_{w_{l-2}^{M}}\\theta f(\\theta)d\\theta}{\\int_{w_{l-2}^{M}}f(\\theta)d\\theta}\n$$  \n\n2. If $w_{l-1}^{e}\\leq w_{l-2}^{M}$ and $j_{l-2}^{M}=H$ , then:  \n\n$$\n\\{J_{l}^{M}=H,W_{l}^{M}=w_{l-2}^{M}\\}b e l i e f s:\\hat{\\theta}_{l}=E(\\theta|h^{l})=\\frac{\\int_{w_{l-2}^{M}}\\theta f(\\theta)d\\theta}{\\int_{w_{l-2}^{M}}f(\\theta)d\\theta}\n$$  \n\n3. If $w_{l-1}^{e}>w_{l-2}^{M}$ , then:  \n\n$$\n\\{J_{l}^{M}=H,W_{l}^{M}=w_{l-1}^{e}\\},b e l i e f s:\\hat{\\theta}_{l}=E(\\theta|h^{l})=\\frac{\\int_{w_{l-1}^{e}}\\theta f(\\theta)d\\theta}{\\int_{w_{l-1}^{e}}f(\\theta)d\\theta}\n$$  \n\nProposition 4:  \n\nThe above strategies constitute a PBE with the following outcomes:  \n\n(a) Outside firm offers $z$ to worker assigned to a high level job. (b) The employer matches outside firm's offer and offers $z$ (c) No turnover occurs. (d) The worker is assigned to the job in which he is most productive.  \n\nProof: See appendix B.  \n\nThis extension shows that when an employer learns his workers′ productivity privately, outside frms cannot elicit this information by observing the employer's offers. This can be seen in equation 14. The employer's wage offer simply reflects the information available to outside firms. The fact that the employer matches the offer informs outside firms that the worker's MRP is larger than the offer (equations 16, 18, 19, and 20). Thus, any offer that exceeds the employer's offer, and potentially can provide new information to outside frms, yields negative expected payoff due to the winner's curse. Since any offer outside firms make that might extract new information regarding the worker's MRP yields negative expected payoff, outside firms will not match the employer's offer. As a result, the employer makes the final Offer.  \n\n### 5.5 Multiple periods  \n\nIn this section, I show that the equilibrium outcome does not hinge on the assumption that there are only two production periods. There are several ways in which incorporating more periods may affect the equilibrium outcome. If there are more than two production periods, new information about the worker's productivity is not revealed to the market. Three possible sources can reveal information regarding the worker's productivity: promotion, wages, and turnover. I already showed promotion reveals information regarding the worker's productivity, but due to the winner's curse promotion does not affect wages. In the two-period model, information regarding job assignment is revealed to outside firms before they make offers for the second period. Wages are always the highest offer made by outside employers. As long as they are uninformed, employers will not offer wages that reveal information to the market; therefore, wages here will not convey information to the market.  \n\nAnother reason extending the model to include more than two periods can affect the equilibrium outcome is that it may affect the off-equilibrium path analysis. In the two period model, if outside firms raid an employed worker they learn the worker's productivity. Since this is the last period, however, they cannot benefit from this information. When firms make offers to employed workers for the second period, the offers may differ depending on the number of periods left. If there is more than one period left, especially since they learn about the worker's productivity during this period. Next, I describe the equilibrium outcome and strategies for N periods case and show that the equilibrium outcome does not change. The main point is that employers have better information at the time outside firms make offers, and outside firms can only raid an employed worker with a contract which exceeds the worker's value to the firm.28  \n\nSuppose there are $N>2$ periods, and consider the following outside frm's strategy if it observed a worker who changed employers after the first period.  \n\nOutside firm's offer: $W_{t}^{M}=M A X\\{w_{2},...,w_{t-1},z\\}$ ; that is, each period the firm observes the worker's wage history and offers the highest wage (excluding the first period wage). In the periods proceeding the second period, the profit is positive only if the worker's actual productivity exceeds the wage the firm offered in the second period. As argued previously, however, the employer always matches an offer if the worker's productivity exceeds it. Therefore, for any offer above $z$ in the second period, the firm cannot profitably make a positive profit by offering $w_{2}>z$ , and the equilibrium outside offers are $z$ . Therefore, firms assign workers to jobs effciently.  \n\n## 6 Applications and Conclusions  \n\n### 6.1 A note about discrimination  \n\nThis section extends the basic model and analyzes the effect of offer matching in the presence of asymmetric information on job assignment and wages discrimination.  \n\nThere are two different groups of workers: $a$ and $b$ (these groups can be race, gender, or class). Both groups have the same distributions of abilities, $f(z,\\theta)$ . Thus, potential employers have more information on the ability of workers from one group than the workers from the other group. When the worker enters the labor market, potential employers observe past experience, education, and other traditional ability indicators. The employer observes privately $\\theta,z$ , during the first period. Denote the lower bound on a worker's MRP conditional on publicly observable characteristics of a worker from a group $k$ by $z_{0}^{k}$ where $k\\in a,b$ . Workers with the same abilities $\\theta,z$ from the disadvantaged group, $a$ ,havelower $z_{0}$ $\\dot{z}_{0}^{a}<z_{0}^{b}$ ). This difference implies that when these workers enter the market, their traditional indicators are less informative and hence, the inference about the MRP they can surely produce is lower than for workers in the advantaged group. As such the expected MRP, conditional on the observable characteristics, is higher in the disadvantaged group than in the other group, whereas the unconditional expected MRP is similar. After a worker works for one period, the employer and the worker realize the ability parameters, and outside firms observe job assignment and $z_{0}^{k}$  \n\nProposition 8: In equilibrium,  \n\n1. The employer promotes effciently the same proportion of workers to the high-level job from each group.   \n2. In the second period, workers from the disadvantaged group, a, will earn less on average in both high-level and low-level jobs than workers in group b. 3. The average entry wage of workers from the disadvantaged group is higher (conditional and unconditional on the observable characteristics).   \nProof: Proposition 8 follows immediately from the equilibrium properties of the original game.  \n\n1. Workers are promoted efficiently. The difference from the original game is that $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{Z}}$ is unobserved. As a result, the minimum MRP outside firms know a worker can produce is $z_{0}^{k}$ instead of $z$ . Hence, in the second period, wages are $z_{0}^{k}$ , regardless of the worker's job assignment. Therefore, employers do not need to raise a promoted worker's wage in order to retain the worker. Since the surplus produced is larger when workers are sorted to jobs efficiently, the employer promotes workers from both groups who are more productive in high-level jobs.  \n\n2. Wages in the second period are $z_{0}$ , regardless of the job assignment. Since on average workers from the disadvantaged group have lower $z_{0}$ ,the second period average wages in this group are lower.  \n\n3. The first period wage is determined before the employer and the worker learn the worker's ability. Since the market is competitive, the expected profit from hiring a worker is zero:  \n\n$$\n\\Pi(z_{0}^{k})=\\int z f_{k}(\\theta,z)d z-w_{1}(z_{0}^{k})+\\int M A X(z-z_{0}^{k},\\theta-z_{0}^{k})f_{k}(\\theta,z)d z d\\theta.\n$$  \n\nImposing zero profit condition on equation 21 yields the first period wages:  \n\n$$\nw_{1}(z_{0}^{k})=\\int z f_{k}(\\theta,z)d z+\\int M A X(z-z_{0}^{k},\\theta-z_{0}^{k})f_{k}(\\theta,z)d z d\\theta.\n$$  \n\nThe expected productivity conditional on the observable characteristics is higher in the disadvantaged group by assumption. In addition, the expected MRP in the high-level job conditional on $z_{0}^{k}$ is greater in the disadvantaged group. Hence, entry-level wages are greater (the unconditional entry-level wages are greater as well). Whereas the expected productivity in the first period (first term in equation 22) and the expected productivity in the second period are the same in both groups, the average second period wage is lower. Hence, the second term in equation 22 is larger.  \n\nQ.E.D  \n\nIn this model wages are equal to the MRP outside firms know a worker can produce rather than the expected MRP conditional on observable characteristics. In models in which wages are the expected MRP conditional on publicly observable characteristics such as Phelps(1972) and Lundberg and Startz(1983), employers interpret the ability signals of workers from the disadvantaged group less accurately and hence, place less reliance on them. In this model employers are equally informed about workers from both groups after one period. Thus, outside firms can interpret less accurately the signals of one group. Since wages are equal to the highest outside offer a worker receives, workers from the disadvantaged group earn less than workers from the advantaged group. This is despite the fact that the expected MRP is known to be higher.  \n\nA major difference from models in which wages are the expected MRP of a worker conditional on his observable characteristics is that if an individual from the disadvantaged group would have had ability signals employers could interpret more accurately (for example, a degree from a good college), he would be paid the same wage as an individual from the advantaged group.  \n\nThe model predicts that as long as the expected productivity is similar across groups, workers from the disadvantaged group earn higher entry level wages. The model, however, is simple and does not capture other aspects that may cause the observed differences between groups as captured in the empirical literature. For example, differences in employment opportunities for young workers may have permanent effect on career paths. In reality, firms are heterogeneous, and provide different career opportunities. Promotion prospects, quality of training and labor market connections differ across firms. Thus, workers from the disadvantaged group are less likely to be hired by firms with better career prospects, then workers from the advantaged groups are likely to experience better career outcomes.  \n\n### 6.2 Conclusions  \n\nOffer matching is a common feature of skilled-workers labor markets. I showed that when employers have better information regarding their workers' productivity, offer matching affects employers’ promotion and job assignment decision. Due to the winner's curse, wages are the MRP of the least productive worker (conditional on the information available to outside frms), and the asymmetric information need not cause distortion. I then analyzed investment in human capital, as training programs of employed workers can be used by outside firms to infer workers qualifications. I showed that investment in skills is efficient when investment costs are shared by workers and employers. Due to competition over inexperienced workers, workers' premarket investment maximizes expected productivity. Since the output level is first-best, investment level is frst-best as well.  \n\nSeveral interesting issues are not addresses in this paper. One issue is labor market turnover. No turnover occurs in equilibrium mainly for the reason that each worker is equally productive in all firms. Bernhardt and Scoones [1993] develop a model of job assignment in which workers’ productivity is dispersed across firms.29 In their paper, the heterogeneity of worker-firm matches alone doesn't generate turnover. Turnover, however, occurs when outside firms can learn employed workers’ productivity by making a costly investment. Once investment is made, the competition is between symmetrically informed employers.30  \n\nOther issues that are not explored are outside employers’ ability to screen workers, and workers? ability to signal their productivity. The frst issue is addressed in Ricart I Costa [1988]. The paper develops a model in which contingent contracts are feasible.31 The later issue is explored in Golan [2002] which develops a wage signaling model. The model allows wages to be determined by negotiation between the employer and worker. As a consequence, equilibrium wages of some workers depend on their productivity and therefore reveal information to potential employers.  \n\n## Appendix A: Proof of proposition 1  \n\nTo prove that the strategies and beliefs above constitute a PBE, I show that: 1) each player's behavioral strategy maximizes his expected payoffs given the other player's strategies, 2) outside firms′ strategies maximize their expected payofs given their beliefs and other players strategies and, 3) these beliefs satisfy Bayes’ rule and are consistent with the employer's and the worker's equilibrium strategies.  \n\nWorker: a worker's strategy, which is to choose the highest offer and stay with the first period employer if there is a tie, maximizes his utility (trivially).  \n\nThe employer's strategy: First, I show that the wage offer is optimal, and then I show that the job assignment is optimal as well. As denoted earlier, the highest outside offer that a worker receives is $w_{2}^{M}$ $\\Pi_{2}^{e}$ is the employing firm's second period profit. In order to show that the wage offer is optimal. $w_{2}^{e}$ should satisfy (for all $w_{2}^{M}$ 二  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{w_{2}^{e}\\in a r g m a x~\\Pi_{2}^{e},~\\mathrm{where}~\\Pi_{2}^{e}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{\\theta-w_{2}^{M}}&{\\mathrm{if}~w_{2}^{M}\\leq w_{2}^{e},}\\ {0}&{\\mathrm{otherwise}}\\end{array}\\right.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nNext I show that the strategy in (1) maximizes the employer's profit: Consider the two possible cases:  \n\n1. w >0.   \n2. $w_{2}^{M}\\leq\\theta$   \nIn the first case each offer that the worker will aept, i.e, $w_{2}^{e}\\geq w_{2}^{M}$ , will yield a negative profit (since $w_{2}^{M}-\\theta<0)$ . Hence, ffering a wage that is lower than and “losing? the worker to another firm is optimal, since it yields zero profit.   \nIn the second case, where $w_{2}^{M}\\leq\\theta$ , each offer $w_{2}^{e}\\geq w_{2}^{M}$ will enable the employer to retain the worker; the minimum wage that is required to retain the worker is w2 = w2 . .Therefore, the strategy described in equation 1, is optimal.  \n\nI show next that assigning the worker to the job he is most productive, is optimal.  \n\nConsider a worker with $\\theta\\geq z$ . If the worker is assigned to a high-level job, $j_{2}^{e}=H$ , then the employer's rent is: $\\theta-z$ . If the worker is assigned to a low-level job $j_{2}^{e}=L$ , the employer gains rent of: $z-z=0$ . Hence, assigning such worker to high-level jobs, is optimal.  \n\nConsider a worker, $\\theta<z$ ; assigning such worker to a low-level jobs is optimal, since the employer will gain a higher payoff: $\\Pi_{2}^{e}(L)=z-z=0>$ $\\Pi_{2}^{e}(H)=\\theta-z<0$ Therefore, assigning the worker, at the end of the first period, to a job he i most productive, is optimal.  \n\nOutside firms: I next show that offering a worker that is assigned to a high-level job in the second period, a contract: $\\{W_{2}^{r}=z,J_{2}^{r}=L\\}$ , is optimal. To prove that, I show that if an outside firm offers a low-level job assignment, then the optimal wage offer is $z$ ; this offer yields zero profit. Then I show, that if the firm offers a high-level job, then for every wage the firm offers, the expected profit is non-positive. Any contract that includes high-level job offer will yield lower payoff to the outside firm than the highest payoff that can be achieved by offering a contract that includes a low-level job assignment offer. Since the market is competitive any wage offer will yield an expected zero profit. Therefore, no outside firm can deviate and offer a wage different from the worker's MRP in low-level job: $z$ . If an outside firm offers a high-level job, the expected profit, $\\Pi_{2}^{r}(J_{2}^{r}=H)$ , is always non-positive. Any wage offer should satisfy: $w_{2}^{r}\\in a r g m a x\\Pi_{2}^{r}(J_{2}^{r}=H)$ ,where  \n\n$$\n\\Pi_{2}^{r}(J_{2}^{r}=H)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{\\theta-w_{2}^{r}}&{\\mathrm{if}\\:\\:w_{2}^{e}<w_{2}^{r},}\\ {0}&{\\mathrm{otherwise}.}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nThere are 2 possible cases: 1. $w_{2}^{r}>\\theta$ , which is a necessary condition to raid a worker in equilibrium. In this case the payoff is negative $\\Pi_{2}^{r}(J_{2}^{r}=$ $H)=\\theta-w_{2}^{r}<0$  \n\n2. $w_{2}^{r}\\leq\\theta$ . In this case the employer will match the offer, and the expected payoff is zero.  \n\nI established that offering a contract $\\{z,J_{2}=L\\}$ yields zero profit, while offering a contract that includes a high-level job assignment yields at most 0 profit. Therefore, offering the contract $\\{z,J_{2}=L\\}$ is optimal.  \n\nBeliefs: I proved above that the raiding-firms’ strategy is optimal given the other players’ equilibrium strategies. Notice that the above equilibrium strategies are optimal for any beliefs about the ability of a worker that is assigned to a high-level job; regardless of the expected MRP of the worker that is promoted, it is always optimal to offer a wage that is equal to the productivity of the least productive worker that the employer promotes. Denote by $\\hat{\\theta}(H)$ , the expected productivity of a worker that is promoted (for any distribution with finite mean). In equilibrium the expected productivity if the worker was assigned to a high-level job in the first period is as described in equation 4. Since a worker is promoted to the job in which he is most productive $\\theta>z$ ), the beliefs satisfy Bayes’ rule; the equilibrium strategies and the beliefs described above constitute a PBE (the strategies are optimal given these beliefs). These strategies imply that the equilibrium outcome is as described in proposition 1.  \n\nQ.E.D  \n\n## Appendix B: Proof of proposition 4  \n\nIn order to prove that (a)-(d) hold in equilibrium, I prove that the equilibrium strategies constitute a PBE. I show that no player can deviate from the equilibrium strategy and increase by that his expected payoff (given the beliefs), at any node. Then I show that (a)-(d) follow from the equilibrium strategies.  \n\nWorker: Since the worker moves only at the terminal nodes, it is straightforward that any deviation from the strategy of choosing the highest wage offer (and choose the employing firm if there is a tie) cannot increase the worker's payoffs.  \n\nEmployer: I First show that at the end of the first period, the employer cannot make a profitable deviation by assigning the worker to a job in which he is not the most productive. Consider a worker who is more productive in low-level jobs, $z>\\theta$ . If the employer deviates and assigns the worker to a high-level job, then given the outside firms’ strategies and his own strategy, the worker will be raided. Hence, the expected payoff is zero, and the employer cannot deviate profitably.  \n\nClearly, the employer cannot deviate profitably by assigning a worker who is more productive in the high-level job, to a low-level job (since the profit will be zero).  \n\nI show next that the employer cannot profitably deviate from his wage offe strategy (equation 14). Consider the case in which $\\theta\\geq w_{l-1}^{M}$ if the employer deviates and offer: $w_{l}^{e}>w_{l-1}^{M}$ , then in the next round the market will offer a wage: $w_{l+1}^{M}=w_{l}^{e}$ , then the employer will not raise the ofer in round $l+2$ , the market will not raise the offer in round $l+3$ , and the employer will stay with the employer. In this case, $\\Pi_{2}^{e}=\\theta-w_{l}^{e}$ . However, the payoff if the employe ofers $w_{l}^{e}=w_{l-1}^{M}$ is higher, since its the lowest wage that is eeded to retain the worker. Hence, any wage offer that is larger is not a profitable deviation.  \n\nClearly, any wage lower than $w_{l-1}^{M}$ is not a profitable deviation, as the employer cannot retain the worker at a wage lower than the market offer. In this case, the employer will rase the ofer in the next round he offers to $w_{l}^{e}=w_{l-1}^{M}$ ， and receive the same payoff. Hence, any lower offer is not a profitable deviation. Consider the case in which $\\theta<w_{l-1}^{M}$ , any offer $w_{l}^{e}>w_{l-2}^{e}$ is not a profitable deviation (cannot offer less by assumption). To see that observe that if $w_{l}^{e}\\ge w_{l-1}^{M}$ than the worker wil stay with the employer and the profit is $\\theta-w_{l}^{e}<0$ , it is easy to see that the lower $w_{l}^{\\mathrm{{e}}}$ the higher the employer's payoff. If $w_{l}^{e}<w_{l-1}^{M}$ than any offer $w_{l}^{e}>w_{l-2}^{e}$ will yield negative payoff (the worker will stay with the employer); the equilibrium strategy wage offer yields zero profit (the worker leaves the firm). Hence, the employer cannot profitably deviate from his wage offer strategies.  \n\nOutside Firms: In the first round ( $l=2$ ) a firm cannot profitably deviate from its contract offer strategy. In case 1 equation 15, it is clear that if $J_{2}^{M}=L$ the outside firm cannot offer a wage larger than $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{Z}}$ and increase the expected payoff. I show next that any contract that include a high-level job offer can yield at most zero profit; hence, it cannot be a profitable deviation. In order to show that, I argue that any wage offer larger than $z$ and a highlevel job assignment will yield a negative expected payoff, and an offer of $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{Z}}$ ， yield zero expected payoff.  \n\nConsider a contract of $\\{J_{2}^{M}=H,w_{2}^{M}>z\\}$ . There are two case: 1. $\\theta>w_{2}^{M}$ . In that case the employer will not match the offer in $l=3$ )and the frm's payoff: 0 - w Case 2. $\\theta\\leq w_{2}^{M}$ . In this case, the employer will match the offer in the next round: $w_{3}^{e}=w_{2}^{M}$ and in round 4, the outside frms do not raise the offer. Therefore, the worker stays with the employer and the outside firms' payoff is zero. Therefore, an outside firm cannot deviate profitably. In the second case, equation 16. A frm cannot deviate profitably. The contract in 16 yields zero expected payoff (since in the next round the employer will not raise his offer and then the outside firms will not raise the offer and the worker stays with the first period employer). Clearly, any offer of a low-level job cannot yield more than zero expected profit. Any wage offer $w_{2}^{M}>w_{1}^{e}$ and a high-level job offer, cannot yield more than zero expected payoff. The argument is the same as in case 1. If the offer exceeds the worker's MRP in high-level jobs then the worker will accept the firm's offer and the firm's expected payoff will be negative. In all other case the worker will stay with the first period employer and then the firm's expected payoff will be zero. Hence, an outside firm cannot profitably deviate from the strategies in 16. For any $l>2$ : Any deviation from the strategy in equation 17 cannot increase the expected payoffs. As in the argument for the $l=2$ , no contract that offer a low-level job assignment can yield more than zero expected payoff. Any contract that include a high-level job ofer yields zero profit if $\\theta\\geq w_{l}^{M}$ and a negative payoff if $\\theta\\geq w_{l}^{M}$ . In equation 18, the argument is similar. $w_{l}^{M}=w_{l-2}^{M}$ is the lowest ofer that outside frms can make In the case that $\\theta\\geq w_{l}^{M}$ the expected payoff from 18 is zero. Any higher wage offer will yield zero payoff if the wage offered is still lower than the worker's MRP. However, if the wage offer exceeds the worker's MRP then the payoff is negative. In the case where $\\theta<w_{l}^{M}$ the worker will accept the frms offer. In order to minimize the cost, the firm's needs to offer the lowest possible wage which . $w_{l-2}^{M}$ Therefoe fm camot poftably devae from 8 he argument for the contract in 19 is similar. $w_{l}^{M}=w_{l-2}^{M}$ is the lowest offer that outside frms can make. If $\\theta\\geq w_{l}^{M}$ then it yields zero expected payoff. Any offer higher than this wage will yield zero expected payoff if the worker MRP is still larger than the wage offer (the worker will stay with the employer). Any offer that exceeds the worker's MRP will yield negative payoff since the employer will not match the offer and the worker will accept the outside firms' offer. The argument for optimality of equation 20 is as follows: The employer offers a wage that is strictly greater than the outside firms' offer (out of the equilibrium path). Given the firms' believe that the lowest possible MRP of that worker is $w_{l-1}^{e}$ , the contract in 20 yields zero expected payoff. Any offer below that wage yields zero expected payoff as well. Any offer that exceeds the employer's previous offer yields zero expected payoff if the offer is still lower than the worker's MRP and a negative payoff if it exceeds the worker's MRP.  \n\nTherefore outside frms cannot deviate profitably from their strategy. Note that on the equilibrium path the beliefs satisfy Bayes' law.  \n\n$$\n\\hat{\\theta}_{l}=E(\\theta|h^{l})\n$$  \n\nSince the employer assigns workers efficiently, the expected productivity of a worker in a high-level job, with MRP in low-level jobs of $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{Z}}$ , is the expected MRP above.  \n\nEquations 14, 15, and 17 describe the strategies on the equilibrium path. Clearly, the marker offer is $z$ , the employer's counteroffer is $z$ , and the market will not make an additional ofer. Hence, the equilibrium outcome is similar to the equilibrium outcome in the finite horizon game (proposition 1), and is described in proposition 4.  \n\nQ.E.D  \n\n## References  \n\n[Acemoglu, D. and Pischke, J.] \"Why Do Firms 'Irain?

Our point of departure is the Montgomery (1991) model of employee referrals which suggests that it is optimal for firms to hire new workers through referrals from their most productive existing employees, as these employees are more likely to know others with high unobserved productivity. Empirically, we identify the networks through coworker links within a rich matched employer-employee data set with cognitive and non-cognitive test scores serving as predetermined indicators of individual productivity. The results corroborate the Montgomery model's key predictions regarding employee selection patterns and entry wages into skill intensive jobs. Incumbent workers of high aptitude are more likely to be linked to entering workers. Firms also acquire entrants with higher ability scores but lower schooling when hiring linked workers supporting the notion that firms use referrals of productive employees in order to attract workers with better qualities in dimensions that would be difficult to observe at the formal market. Furthermore, the abilities of incumbent workers are refected in the starting wages of linked entrants, suggesting that firms use the ability-density of social networks when setting entry wages. Overall the results suggest that firms use social networks as a signal of worker productivity, and that workers therefore benefit from the quality of their social ties.  \n\nKeywords: Referrals, wage inequality, employer learning, cognitive skills JEL-c0des: M51, J64, J24, J31, Z13  \n\n## Table of contens  \n\nINTRODUCTION   \n2 THEORY   \n2.1 The Montgomery model   \n2.2 Relationship to alternative network models 9   \n3 TAKING THE MODEL TO THE DATA 11   \n3.1 AGENTS, NETWORKS AND WAGES   \n3.2 OBSERVED AND UNOBSERVED PRODUCTIVITY 12   \n3.3 Testable micro-level elements 13   \n3.4 Previous empirical evidence 15 DATA   \n4.1 \"PLACEBO\" LINKS: NON-OVERLAPPING EMPLOYMENT SPELLS, AND OTHER PLANTS WITHIN THE SAME FIRM .19   \n4.2 SUMMARY STATISTICS 20   \n5 EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS 21   \n5.1 EMPIRICAL SPECIFICATIONS. 21   \n5.2 RESULTS ON EMPLOYEE SELECTION 22   \n5.2.1 TESTABLE ELEMENT 1: INCUMBENT ABILITY AND THE USE OF REFERRALS 22   \n5.2.2 TESTABLE ELEMENT 2: REFERRALS AND ENTRANT ABILITY 24   \n5.2.3 EMPLOYEE SELECTION, NETWORK INBREEDING AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL SKILLS.. 26   \n5.3  RESULTS ON ENTRY WAGES. 30   \n5.3.1 TESTABLE ELEMENT 3: AVERAGE ENTRY WAGES . 30   \n5.3.2 TESTABLE ELEMENT 4: ENTRY WAGES AND INCUMBENT SKILLS .31 PLACEBO AND ROBUSTNESS. 35  \n\n#  \n\n6.1 EVIDENCE FROM PLACEBO LINKS 35   \n6.2 COVARIATES AND SAMPLES 37   \n6.3 EXTENDING THE ANALYSIS TO LOW-SKILLED JOBS 39  \n\n## CONCLUSIONS.  \n\n## References  \n\n## 1 Introduction  \n\nThe inherent uncertainty about worker productivity that firms face when selecting new employees is at the core of modern labor economics. It motivates fundamental economic concepts such as statistical discrimination, the signaling value of education, and the matching function, which serves as the keystone of current unemployment theory. Ex ante information imperfections between workers and firms also motivate large scale public interventions through job-matching services and short-term employment subsidies. Recent research within personnel economics has drawn the attention to the various strategies employed by firms to overcome this information problem (Oyer and Schaefer, 2011). In this paper we provide an in-depth empirical analysis of the hypothesis that firms use social networks when selecting employees in order to reduce the uncertainty about newly hired workers’ abilities.1  \n\nOur analysis takes its starting point in the theory outlined by Montgomery (1991). This model, which provides the foundation for much of the existing literature on employee referrals, presupposes that the quality of social networks serve as a signal of the productivity of prospective workers.2 The model assumes that high ability workers on average are more likely to know other high-ability workers (network inbreeding). Referrals from high ability employees therefore serve as a positive signal to employers in search of the most able workers. Firms price these signals by paying referred workers higher wages in order to avoid losing them to competing firms who may have the same information. Since the pass-through from the value of the signal onto wages is partial, the model also allows for positive profits from referrals in equilibrium, despite free entry of firms. In addition, the model presents a natural rationale for endogenous skill segregation across firms. But most importantly, the model shows that firms’ inability to ex ante observe worker ability can generate wage inequality between workers who are equally productive but embedded in social networks with different ability densities.  \n\nDespite these important implications, and the fact that the model provides a fundamental link between the social network literature and the literature on employee selection under uncertainty, this is to our knowledge the first paper to directly test the empirical relevance of the key micro-level arguments.3 One likely reason for the scarce set of direct evidence on the relevance of the Montgomery model is lack of appropriate data. The model argues that employers use referrals in order to discriminate between high- and low ability workers who are observationally equivalent, and that employers rely on information about the abilities of entrants’ social ties when entry wages are set. Hence, key elements of the model can only be analyzed using data on determinants of entrants? individual productivity that are unavailable to employers at the time of recruitment alongside indicators of social networks, referring workers’ abilities and entry wages.  \n\nOur empirical strategy builds on insights from the literature on employer learning. Following Farber and Gibbons (1996) and Altonji and Pierret (2001) we use test scores from armed forces qualifying tests (AFQT) as indicators for elements of worker productivity that are not directly observable to recruiting employers. Consistent with this notion and the existing literature, we show that our Swedish AFQT scores are not fully priced into wages at the initial hiring stage. However, the association between wages and test scores increases with tenure in contrast to the returns to schooling, which fall or remain constant over time depending on the choice of specification. Building on this result, we therefore argue that the test scores can be used as proxies for a wider set of productivityenhancing factors that are not easily observed by employers at the time of recruitment, and therefore also not fully priced by the market, along the lines of the unobserved productivity components of the Montgomery (1991) model. To further substantiate the validity of this strategy, we throughout compare patterns related to test scores (interpreted as only partially observed by the market) with patterns related to years of schooling (assumed to be readily observed by all agents).  \n\nEmpirically, we focus our analysis on firms who recruit former co-workers of incumbent employees into skill-intensive jobs in the private sector.4 Within our 20 years of Swedish population-wide data, 12 percent of new recruits have a shared working history with an incumbent employee, hence co-worker links constitute a non-trivial fraction of new hires. Our data are further linked to AFQT-scores and measures of non-cognitive abilities for 32 full cohorts of male workers, allowing us to provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between worker ability and the use of workplace-based social ties.  \n\nUsing these data, we analyze key elements of the Montgomery model, focusing on employee selection and entry wages. In particular, we study the relationship between recruitments of former coworkers and the abilities of the incumbent and entering workers, while separating abilities that are are difficult to observe (ability scores) from those that are easy to observe by employers (schooling). We further study the relationship between recruitments of former coworkers and entry wages, and the relationship between incumbent workers’ abilities and the starting wages of linked entrants.  \n\nTo preview our results, we first document that entrants are more likely to be linked to high ability incumbent employees than to low ability incumbents (defined from test scores or wages). We find a much weaker correlation between formal schooling and the frequency of used links. Second, we show that linked entrants have higher test scores given their level of schooling, suggesting that they are of higher (unobserved) ability. In sharp contrast, we find that linked entrants have less formal schooling than other entrants. Third, we show that entering workers receive higher initial wages if they have a link to an existing employee. Fourth, we show that entering workers benefit (through higher wages) from the abilities of linked incumbent workers. Qualitatively, these estimates are very robust to variations in the use of control variables, including establishment fixed effects. Accounting for potential correlations between abilities and network size or quality does  \n\nnot affect the results.  \n\nOur broad multi-firm data further allows us to test if the empirical regularities are driven by personal interactions, or if other correlated factors are confounding the results. A specific concern is the possibility that the results are driven by alternative mechanisms related to the employment histories of the agents, including, e.g., that employers draw inference from the previous work history rather than from social networks as such. To address this concern, we derive \"placebo-type” estimates by analyzing recruitments of workerswho either $(i)$ worked at the same establishments as incumbent workers, but not at the same point in time or $(i i)$ worked within the same (previous) firm as an incumbent worker, but in a different establishment. Reassuringly, and despite the obvious fact that some of these workers also may be acquainted with incumbent workers due to overlapping networks, we find empirical patterns that are heavily muted when replacing linked employees with either of these two sets of \"placebo-linked”’ entrants; placebo-linked entrants do not differ from other entrants in terms of cognitive abilities and they do not earn higher wages than other entrants.  \n\nIn line with the notion of network inbreeding as a key element in the selection process, we also show that entrants and incumbents share similar types of skills. We document this by separately exploring the role of our measures of cognitive skills and measures of noncognitive skills derived from psychological assessments administered at the same time as the cognitive tests. We also show that the data, in general, are less in line with the model when studying recruitments to jobs with a lower skill content. The patterns also suggest that non-cognitive abilities are more relevant for jobs with a low skill content which is well in line with the notion that cognitive skills primarily are linked to productivity within high skilled jobs, and that non-cognitive skills are relatively more important within less skill demanding jobs (see also Lindqvist and Vestman (2011) and Brown et al. (2012) for similar conclusions).  \n\nOverall, we interpret our results as being consistent with Montgomery's model suggesting that firms use social networks of productive incumbent employees as a tool to reduce uncertainty and select high ability employees into skill-intensive jobs. Apart from these firm-side benefits, the referral process also appear to have real effects on the labor market outcomes of the individuals by providing wage returns to workers who are embedded in ability-dense networks. Our results thus support the notion that social networks can generate wage inequality between equally productive workers.  \n\nThe paper is structured as follows: In section 2, we introduce the Montgomery model, Section 3 describes the key components of our empirical analysis and the testable elements of the model that we take to the data, section 4 describes the empirical design and the data in more detail, Section 5 contains the results, section 6 presents robustness checks and section 7 concludes.  \n\n# 2 Theory  \n\n### 2.1 The Montgomery model  \n\nThis paper builds on Montgomery's (1991) formalization of employers’ use of referrals. In this two-period model of the labor market, each worker lives for one period. Workers are observationally equivalent for employers, but can be of two types, either high $(H)$ Or low $(L)$ ability. High ability workers produce 1 and low ability workers produce O, but employers are uncertain of the productivity of any particular worker at the initial hiring stage.  \n\nThe social structure is characterized by two parameters; the density of the network, $\\tau$ and the degree of inbreeding bias $\\alpha$ . Workers hired in the first period knows (at most) one period 2 worker with probability $\\tau$ . Conditional on holding a tie, workers in period 1 know someone of his own type with probability $\\alpha>0.5$ . This means that workers are more likely to know someone of their own type; Montgomery refers to this as the \" inbreeding bias\"'. The links from period 1 workers are randomly distributed over period 2 workers (conditional on $\\alpha$ ) so that some period 2 workers may have multiple ties and some may have none.  \n\nEach firm employs up to one worker per period. In period 1, firms hire workers through the market. As noted above, prospective workers are observationally equivalent, hence employers cannot observe whether any given worker is of high or low ability prior to hiring. Period 1 workers’ types are revealed after hiring and prior to the start of the second period. In period 2 employers can choose whether to hire from the formal market, to awage of $w_{M2}$ or to hire the referrals that current employees provide, to a wage of $w_{R}$  \n\nFirm profits are given by worker productivity minus the wage, and there is free entry of firms. In period 2, firms make referral offers if the expected profits from doing so exceeds expected profits from recruiting workers at the formal market. A key prediction of the model is that firms who, by chance, received workers of type $H$ in period 1 always will prefer to make referral offers in period 2, whereas firms who received workers of type $L$ in period 1 will prefer to hire through the market.  \n\nIntuitively, the inbreeding bias generates adverse selection in the open market. More high quality than low quality workers are removed from the formal market since $\\alpha>$ 0.5. Hence, workers remaining on the period 2 open market will only be of high ability with a probability less than 0.5 whereas workers available through referrals from high ability period 1 workers are high ability workers with a probability larger than 0.5. It is therefore evident that workers hired through referrals (from high ability workers) are more productive on average.  \n\nThe model results in a partly undetermined wage distribution, but it is shown that (some) firms will find it optimal to offer a wage to referred workers that exceeds the market wage by a non-trivial amount since the same workers may receive a referral offer from competing firms (essentially, the information structure provides an idiosyncratic expected match-specific surplus which is shared between the agents). The profit levels remain positive for a distribution of wage offers ranging from the market wage to an upper bound which depends on the network density and inbreeding bias in the economy.  \n\nImportantly, the model proposes a mechanism by which differences in social networks may generate wage differences between equally productive workers. In equilibrium, each worker's wage is determined not by the actual skills but by the number and types of social ties to period 1 workers. Period 2 workers with ties to high ability workers will receive more referrals and hence have higher expected wages, regardless of the individual productivity. All workers who lack social ties to high ability workers are forced to find employment on the open market, even if they actually are of the high ability type. Since the market is aflicted by adverse selection, market wages tend to be lower the more social ties are used in the economy.  \n\n### 2.2  Relationship to alternative network models  \n\nThere is a long and well-established theoretical literature on job search networks, which dates back to the 1960s. In this section we provide a brief overview of of this literature and relate the Montgomery model to alternative network models. Broadly, the literature is divided into two main strands which differ in the role played by the firm (see e.g. Jackson (2010). The first part focuses on job search networks as a channel through which workers acquire information about vacancies on a market which is populated by homogeneous agents (see e.g. Calvo-Armengol and Jackson (2004)). The second strand, in which Montgomery (1991) provides the canonical model, stresses the role played by networks as a firm-side tool to acquire information about worker characteristics, often in the form of employee referrals. Since most of the empirical analysis of this paper explicitly concerns the role of individual heterogeneity, our analysis will clearly diverge from any predictions derived from models with homogeneous agents and we therefore focus the discussion below on papers in the second strand of the literature.  \n\nBy now the referral based literature contains a number of different types of models which partly can be viewed as complementary. The models differ in their focus on the relevant aspects of unobserved qualities, and on the exact nature of the information transmission process. Simon and Warner (1992) provide a theoretical model where referrals are made by random incumbent employees in order to reduce the uncertainty regarding match specific productivity. Dustmann et al. (2011), Galenianos (2011), Brown et al. (2012) and Pinkston (2012) provide recent extensions and applications.  \n\nIn contrast to these models, the Montgomery (1991) model focuses on the selection of employees with good unobserved predetermined abilities. The key distinguishing aspect of the Montgomery model is, however, the role played by the productivity of the referring worker as a signal used by the employer to form expectations about the productivity of prospective employees. This aspect of the model, which mirrors models of statistical discrimination, also drives the link between the ability density of social networks and wage inequality that persists in equilibrium.  \n\nThere also exists a set of models which we view as complementary extensions of the Montgomery model. Casella and Hanaki (2006) and Casella and Hanaki (2008) emphasize the signaling role of social networks and explore the resilience of the model predictions to an extension where workers who are not hired through referrals can obtain a costly imperfect signal of true productivity (e.g. through education). The results show that the usefulness of job search networks is very resilient since they provide employers with privileged (and thus not fully priced) information at a low cost.5 Since the model essentially is an extension of Montgomery (1991), our analysis cannot distinguish between the two, but Casella and Hanakis′ emphasis on the signaling aspect of the referral process is very much in line with the structure of our empirical analysis. One particularly relevant result which emerges in the Casella and Hanaki formulation is that workers hired through referrals can forgo the step of obtaining formal productivity signals, which implies that referrals and education are substitutes. Beaman and Magruder (2012) which replaces Montgomery's inbreeding mechanism by the presumption that high ability workers are more able to identify other high ability workers, and that they will do so if properly incentivized.6 Hence, if firms provide explicit or implicit incentives for incumbent workers to refer good entrants, the models become observationally equivalent in the dimensions related to employee selection.  \n\n# 3 Taking the model to the data  \n\nThe key components of the Montgomery model are $(i)$ the social ties between period 1 and period 2 workers, $(i i)$ the correlation between these workers in terms of inherent productivity, and (ii) the setting of (entry) wages according to expected, rather than actual, productivity. In this section we describe how we take these central aspects to the data. We return to more specific details about the data construction in Section 4, where we also discuss the empirical specifications in more detail and provide summary statistics.  \n\n### 3.1 Agents, networks and wages  \n\nThe Montgomery model defines a matching process involving demand side agents (period 1 workers) and supply side agents (period 2 workers). We let incumbent workers be the empirical counterparts of period 1 workers whereas entrants represent period 2 workers. This implies that entry wages is a straightforward measure of period 2 wages in the model. We return to our measures of worker productivity in section 3.2 below.  \n\nTo define the ties between incumbent workers and entrants, we use data on links acquired through previous employment relationships (details are in the following subsection). We find this particular type of network to be a useful starting point to test the relevance of the Montgomery model. It seems a priori plausible that network inbreeding (in terms of productive capacities) is particularly prominent for social networks that are formed at the labor market. Thus, it may be particularly useful for employers to let incumbent employees refer their former co-workers.7 Previous research have also documented the importance of co-worker networks for the reemployment probability of laid-off workers (see e.g. Cingano and Rosolia (2012).  \n\n### 3.2  Observed and unobserved productivity  \n\nThe model builds on the notion that individual workers’ productive abilities are partly unknown at the time of recruitment. To take this key aspect of the model to the data we follow Altonji and Pierret (2001) and decompose prospective workers’ individual productivity $(y_{i})$ into four different components:  \n\n$$\ny_{i}=r s_{i}+\\mu q_{i}+\\kappa z_{i}+\\eta_{i}\n$$  \n\nwhere all employers can observe $(s_{i},q_{i})$ while the elements $(z_{i},\\eta_{i})$ are unobserved. On the other hand, $(s_{i},z_{i})$ are observed by the econometrician. To be precise, we can think of $s$ as capturing formal merits such as schooling which is easily observed to all, $q_{i}$ indicates parts that are easily observed for firms but are outside of our data, such as letters of recommendation, $z_{i}$ captures productive elements that we are able to observe but which are unobserved to the firms, and $\\eta_{i}$ captures fundamentally unobserved elements. Importantly, these elements may be correlated, although each element is assumed to contain some independent information.  \n\nThe central feature of the Montgomery model is that firms can mitigate the information problem at the recruitment stage by asking incumbent workers for referrals. More specifically, the inbreeding feature of networks allows firms to form expectations about $z_{i}$ and $\\eta_{i}$ by observing the productivity of the referring employee. Assessing the relevance of the model therefore requires access to some information about worker skills that are not directly observed by employers at the initial hiring stage.  \n\nDrawing on insights from Farber and Gibbons (1996) and Altonji and Pierret (2001) we assume that cognitive test scores are a valid measure of such skills. In particular, Altonji and Pierret (2001) show that characteristics that are difficult (easy) to observe should be given a growing (diminishing) weight over time if employers learn about worker productivity as they acquire experience. Altonji and Pierret (2001) further show that  \n\nAFQT scores have this property.8. It is important to emphasize that the scores, in general, may be correlated with factors that are indeed observed by employers (such as schooling); the crucial assumption is that the scores capture skills that are at least partly unobserved.  \n\nTo strengthen the interpretation of the test scores as valid proxies for abilities that are difficult to observe, we have replicated the analysis of Altonji and Pierret (2001) using our Swedish data (described below). In line with the previous literature, the results shown in Table A 2 in Appendix A suggest that cognitive test scores have a negligible effect on wages during the year of market entry, but become increasingly important with experience. In contrast to Altonji and Pierret (2001), which emphasizes public learning as workers accumulate experience, the Montgomery model stresses the potential role played by private information about the expected productive ability of workers obtained by firms via referrals. We therefore also show that the patterns look similar when we focus on how the returns to schooling and ability vary within employment spells for workers who remain in their jobs, suggesting that employer learning also affects wages within ongoing employment relationships. We take these results as support for the idea that the test scores known to us capture worker skills that are partly unobserved to employers at the initial hiring stage and therefore not fully priced into workers’ entry wages. Since part of the analysis below will incorporate a measures of non-cognitive skills, we also extend the model to account for these measures showing that they exhibit a similar relationship to wages and experience as the cognitive test scores.  \n\n### 3.3 Testable micro-level elements  \n\nRelying on our measures of network links, period 2 workers’ (entry) wages and unobserved components of individual productivity as defined above, we formulate four testable elements regarding the selection of new employees and the setting of entry wages based on the Montgomery model as outlined in Section 2.  \n\n### Employee selection:  \n\n1. The main proposition stated of the Montgomery model is that firms make referral offers (R) $i f f$ they employ type $H$ workers in period 1, i.e $P r(R=1|T y p e^{1}=H)=1$ and $P r(R=1|T y p e^{1}=L)=0$ . As an empirical counterpart of this stylized result, we expect that the probability of hiring through social ties will increase in the productivity of the incumbent worker.  \n\n2. Because workers (by assumption) are more likely to know someone of their own type $\\langle\\alpha>0.5)$ , the probability that an entrant is of type $H$ is greater for firms who hire through referrals than for firms who hire through the anonymous market, i.e. $P r(T y p e^{2}=H|R=$ $1)>P r(T y p e^{2}=H|R=0)$ . Thus, we expect workers hired through referrals to, on average, have more productive unobserved abilities than workers hired through the market. Entry wages:  \n\n3. Montgomery shows that referral wages will be dispersed over an interval ranging from the wage received by period 2 workers hired on the market $w_{M2}$ to an upper bound $w_{R m a x}(\\alpha,\\tau)$ . Thus, we expect entry wages of workers hired through social networks to be higher than entry wages amongst workers that found their jobs through the formal market. 4. The basic presumption of the Montgomery model is that referred period 2 workers signal their abilities through the abilities of referring period 1 workers. As a consequence, we expect entry wages of workers that are hired through referrals to be correlated with the abilities of linked incumbent workers.  \n\nThe micro elements listed above are all related to fundamental parts of the Montgomery model, but they are also jointly (although not necessarily individually) fairly unique to the distinct class of models related to Montgomery (1991), see Section 2.2. The predictions we are testing, with the exception of the relationship between social ties and average wages (element 3), all explicitly concern the role of individual heterogeneity and the elements therefore clearly diverge from any predictions derived from models with homogeneous agents. In addition, the predictions explicitly tests the role of pre-determined time constant, instead of match-specific, characteristics (element 1, 2 and 4) and emphasize the role of the characteristics of the inside agent both for employee selection (element 1) and for entry wages (element 4).  \n\n### 3.4   Previous empirical evidence  \n\nA growing body of empirical studies document various aspects of the usage and consequences of labor market networks. A stylized fact emerging from the existing literature is that labor market outcomes are correlated within networks.9 For the purpose of this paper we are however primarily interested in the relationship between networks and demand side characteristics, agent heterogeneity and the seting of entry wages.  \n\nConsidering the amount of papers that have analyzed the usage of networks using supply side data, we know surprisingly little from the demand side. Most of what we do know is based on single firm studies such as Fernandez et al. (2000), Castilla (2005) and Yakubovich and Lup (2006) for call centers, Brown et al. (2012) for a retail firm as well as Burks et al. (2013) for seven call centers, a trucking firm and a \"'high-tech'\"’ firm. These studies all explore detailed and accurate data from referral systems that are welldocumented by the firms’ human resource departments. Although the data analyzed in these studies are intriguing, a natural limitation arising from the study design is that the results pertain to firms with well-structured internal documentation of formalized referral processes. With the exception of minor parts of both Brown et al. (2012) and Burks et al. (2013), the focus is also on jobs with a low skill content, which, as our results will indicate, may be an important factor.  \n\nThe paper which most closely investigates the role of the productivity of the inside agent is Yakubovich and Lup (2006), who show that the productivities of the referring employees within virtual call centers are correlated with the probability that referred applicants are being recruited. Somewhat related, both Fernandez et al. (2000) and Burks et al. (2013) show that the characteristics of referrals and referrers tend to be correlated. Kramarz and Skans use economy-wide data to study family ties and youth labor market entry. Consistent with the notion that firms use employee productivity as a signal of the productivity of linked prospective workers, parents are found to be more relevant in the job finding process if they have longer tenure and higher wages, even conditional on firm fixed effects and observable characteristics of the youths. Kramarz and Skans also find a positive association between the use of family networks and firm profitability as suggested by the Montgomery model.  \n\nThe evidence is also scarce when it comes to differences in individual productivity between workers who enter through social ties and workers who enter through other means. In general, conclusions regarding this issue is either inferred from the wage impact, which we return to below, or derived from readily observed indicators of productivity (i.e. schooling).10 However, by relying on easily observable indicators of productivity such as schooling, these results are by definition uninformative regarding the role played by social networks for overcoming information asymmetries at the time of recruitment.11  \n\nThe existing evidence on the relationship between social networks and wages provides very mixed results in general. Since the focus of our paper is on uncertainty and asymmetric information during recruitment, we are primarily interested in studies documenting the association between networks and entry wages. Here, Bentolila et al. (2010) using survey data on youths for various European countries and the Us find a negative association and Kramarz and Skans find negative associations between entry wages the use of family ties, in particular when conditioning on firm fixed effects. In contrast Dustmann et al. (2011) find positive effects from ethnic networks conditional on worker and firm fixed effects. In general, it is not clear why the wage estimates differ so much between studies, but one possible explanation is that the role of networks differ depending on the type of information they can convey regarding workers abilities, see e.g. Loury (2006). An alternative interpretation, consistent with Montgomery, is that the wage premium depends on employers's expectations regarding the degree of skill-segregation (or inbreeding) within different types of networks. An interesting recent contribution is Brown et al. (2012), who study explicit data on referrals (within a single firm) and find a positive impact on entry wages for most (but not all) types of jobs.12 They also show that employees who receive referrals from older workers, more tenured workers or workers in higher ranks have the highest initial starting salaries. Importantly, we have not found any studies directly exploring the relationship between incumbent worker abilities and the abilities and wages of linked entrants.  \n\n# 4 Data  \n\nOur analysis uses a large Swedish sample of entering and incumbent male workers during the years 2000-2005, drawn from administrative employment registers provided by Statistics Sweden. The data cover the work histories of all employed workers aged 16-65 for the period 1985-2007. In addition, we use detailed individual demographics (e.g. age, gender and education level) along with military draft scores for males born between 1951 and 1979. In these cohorts almost all males went through the draft procedure at age 18 or 19 (they took the draft in 1969-2000). The cognitive test scores provide an evaluation of cognitive ability based on several subtests of logical, verbal and spatial abilities and are similar to the AFQT in the US. Individuals are graded on a 1-9 scale, which we standardize to mean zero and standard deviation one within each cohort of draftees. In addition, the data contain non-cognitive scores based on assessments by a trained psychologist. We return to a discussion of these data in section 5.2.3.  \n\nWe construct the data for our analysis by generating (yearly) matched pairs (dyads) of incumbent workers $(j)$ and entrants $(i)$ . For computational convenience, we exclude plants with more than 5o0 employees. We define incumbents as workers observed at the establishment in the current and in the previous year. Entrants are workers entering from outside the firm into establishments where they have never worked before (at least since 1985). For entrants with multiple jobs during the year, we keep the work spell generating the highest annual income. We exclude entrants who arrive in large groups (more than 5) from the same establishment. We do this to avoid classifying entrants through mergers as new hires. This restriction excludes 2.9 percent of the entrants.  \n\nWe characterize the entry jobs using full-time adjusted monthly entry wages as well as occupational classifications using an additional register (Strukturlonestatistiken), which is fully linked to the employment register on both the worker and the establishment side. Wages are collected in September or October each year for a large firm-based sample of private sector workers.13 The private sector sample which is stratified by firm size and industry covers about 30 percent of the target population.  \n\nIn the main analysis we restrict the sample to workers entering skill-intensive jobs in the private sector. More specifically, we select all entry jobs in occupations with ISCO-88 1-digit codes equal to 2 (Professionals) or 3 (Technicians and associate professionals). About $1/3$ of all entry jobs in the private sector are high-skilled according to this definition. We take this as the starting point since Montgomery-type referral processes are likely to be more relevant for skill intensive jobs (Montgomery (1991)), and since the correlations between productivity and different skill dimensions may depend on job complexity (Lindqvist and Vestman, 2011). We complement these results in Section 6.3 with models focusing on low-skilled jobs, exploiting also variations in worker's non-cognitive testscores.  \n\nFor each incumbent-entrant dyad, we define a variable indicating whether $(j)$ and $(i)$ are former co-workers, which is our measure of $(j)$ and $(i)$ being linked to one another. Pairs are defined as linked if they were (previously and simultaneously) employed at the same establishment anytime since 1985.14  \n\n### 4.1 \"Placebo\" links: non-overlapping employment spells, and other plants within the same firm  \n\nTo assess the importance of the actual personal interaction between former co-workers, we will contrast our empirical results to two sets of \"'placebo-links’ between incumbent workers and entrants.  \n\nOur first approach is to define placebo-linked entrants as workers who have been employed at the same establishment as an incumbent worker, but not at the same time. We refer to these links as Placebo links of Type I. We require that the placebo-linked entrant was employed at the (old) establishment within 3 years after the incumbent worker left, or within 3-years before the incumbent joined that employer. Since placebo-linked workers have a non-overlapping, but otherwise similar, work history as incumbent workers, they provide a measure of the impact of (indirect) factors related to former workplaces, other than those related to personal interactions at the workplace.  \n\nOur second definition of placebo-linked entrants (Placebo links of Type II) are workers that were employed in the same firm at the same time as an incumbent worker, but in a different establishment.15 The strategy can only be used for frms with at least two establishments, which implies that we for this analysis will restrict the set of former workplaces where valid \"interactions\" can take place to multi-establishment firms. To generate a plausible comparison to the true links we furthermore require that the two establishments defining the placebo-link must operate within the same 5-digit industry. Since the necessary restrictions change the identifying sample, we will also present results of the actual links for an overlapping sample.  \n\n### 4.2 Summary statistics  \n\nTable $I$ shows summary statistics for the establishments, incumbent workers, entrants and incumbent-entrant pairs included in our estimating sample of high skilled jobs. The median establishment has 37 employees, with an upper limit of 499, including both the incumbent and the entering worker. For consistency, we focus on pairs with non-missing wages for the entrant and test-scores for both agents throughout our analysis. The average incumbent worker in our data is 37 years of age, has 13 years of schooling, 7 years of tenure and a mean cognitive (non-cognitive) test score of 5.5 (5.3) on the 1-9 scale.16 Entering workers are four years younger on average, have one additional year of schooling and higher mean cognitive and non-cognitive test scores. 72 percent of the entrants were employed the year prior to entry.  \n\nThe table also reports the frequency of true and placebo links among incumbents and entrants described in the previous section. About 3 percent of the incumbent workers share a link with an entrant in a given year; 12 percent of the entrants are former coworkers with someone in the entry establishment; and 1 percent of the entrant-incumbent dyads share a link with each other.  \n\nThe numbers are similar for the placebo-links although we do see a somewhat lower frequency of placebo links defined from non-overlapping employment spells in the same previous establishment (Placebo co-workers of Type I). This is not surprising as the definition of this placebo-link requires that the two agents joined/left the previous plant during a time window of 3 years.  \n\nTable 1: Summary statistics: 2000-2005   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>mean</td><td>sd</td><td>p50</td><td>min</td><td>max</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\">Incumbent workers:</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>37.3</td><td>8.3</td><td>37</td><td>16</td><td>57</td></tr><tr><td>Schooling</td><td>13.2</td><td>2.3</td><td>12</td><td>8</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Experience</td><td>12.4</td><td>4.6</td><td>13</td><td>0</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Tenure</td><td>7.2</td><td>5.2</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Cognitive test score</td><td>5.6</td><td>1.9</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Non-cognitive test score</td><td>5.3</td><td>1.7</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>At least one co-worker link to entrant in a givenyear</td><td>0.03</td><td>0.16</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>At least one placebo link of Type / to entrant in a given year</td><td>0.01</td><td>0.10</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>At least one placebolink of Type ll to entrant in a given year</td><td>0.04</td><td>0.20</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Number of truelinksgiven at least oneinagivenyear</td><td>1.22</td><td>0.70</td><td>1 n=359,462</td><td>1</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\"></td></tr><tr><td>Entrants: Age</td><td>33.3</td><td>7.6</td><td></td><td>18</td><td>55</td></tr><tr><td>Schooling</td><td></td><td></td><td>32 16</td><td>8</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Experience</td><td>14.3</td><td>2.1</td><td>12</td><td>0</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Cognitive test score</td><td>12.0 6.1</td><td>4.6 1.7</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Non-cognitive test score</td><td>5.7</td><td>1.6</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>log(entry wage)</td><td>10.1</td><td>0.33</td><td>10.1</td><td>8.9</td><td>13.5</td></tr><tr><td>From employment</td><td>0.72</td><td>0.45</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>No.ofpreviousemployers</td><td></td><td>2.8</td><td>5</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>At least one co-worker linkin entering establishment</td><td>5.1</td><td></td><td></td><td>0</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.12</td><td>0.32</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>At least one placebo link of Type/ in entering establishment</td><td>0.07</td><td>0.26</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>At least one placebo link of Type Il in entering establishment</td><td>0.09 3.34</td><td>0.29</td><td>0 1</td><td>0 1</td><td>1 136</td></tr><tr><td>Number of true links given at least one:</td><td colspan=\"5\">7.47 n=28,414</td></tr><tr><td>Establishments:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>75.7</td><td>94.5</td><td>37</td><td>2</td><td>499</td></tr><tr><td>Single plant firm Private sector</td><td>0.25</td><td>0.43</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Fraction in metropolitan area</td><td>1 0.39</td><td>0</td><td>1 0</td><td>1 0</td><td>1 1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"5\">0.49 n =8,264</td></tr><tr><td>Incumbent-entrantdyads:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Co-worker link</td><td>0.01</td><td>0.10</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Placebo link Type /</td><td>0.004</td><td>0.06</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Placebo link Type II</td><td>0.02</td><td>0.13</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Size of plant where linkwas established</td><td>212.0</td><td>147.0</td><td>190</td><td>2</td><td>499</td></tr><tr><td>Years since link was established</td><td>5.8</td><td>4.0</td><td>4 n = 1,065,480</td><td>2</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"5\"></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNotes. The table displays summary statistics for the incumbents, entrants, establishments and incumbent-entrant dyads included in our sample. Placebo links of Type / are defined from non-overlapping employment spells in the same establishment; placebo links ofType $I I$ are defined from overlapping employment spells in the same firm but at different establishments (within industries). Establishments are defined to be in a metropolitan area if located in one of Sweden's three largest cities (Stockholm, Gothenburg or Malmo).  \n\n# 5 Empirical analysis  \n\n### 5.1 Empirical specifications  \n\nIn this section we analyze the testable elements of Montgomery's referral model outlined in Section 3.3 using our data on co-worker links. We use a separate model for each of the four elements. For each of these models, we provide estimates from four empirical specifications: Specification (1) controls for individual (incumbent and/or entrant) background characteristics, an indicator for whether the establishment is located in a metropolitan area, log size of the establishment, and year effects. Specification (2) adds firm-type dummies obtained from the interaction between establishment size in six brackets (1-9, 10-19, 20-49, 50-99, 100-199, 200-499) and 3-digit industry. Specification (3) adds jobtype dummies referring to the first two digits of the ISCO-88 occupation code of either the incumbent or entrant depending on the specification. Finally, specification (4) adds establishment fixed effects.  \n\nBecause the Montgomery model in its purest form is a model of differences in referral hiring patterns between firms, specification (2) is most closely related to the theory. However, by adding additional controls, we reduce the risk that the results are driven by differences between firms that are outside the scope of the stylized model.  \n\nTo assess the robustness of the estimates, we also estimate models accounting for additional controls such as network size and quality and/or the labor market history of the relevant agent. In the interest of streamlining the presentation, we have however deferred models using these controls to a robustness section since the set of additional covariates will differ depending on the estimated model. In the robustness section, we also present our two sets of \"placebo tests'.  \n\n### 5.2 Results on Employee selection  \n\n#### 5.2.1 Testable element 1: Incumbent ability and the use of referrals  \n\nThe first prediction of the Montgomery model suggests that firms hire through employee referrals if, and only if, they employ already productive incumbent employees. To test this prediction, we define a model which allows us to associate the incidence of recruitments through social links (former colleagues) with the abilities of the incumbent workers. Using data on incumbent workers, we estimate a model of the following form:  \n\n$$\nP r(L i n k_{j t}=1)={\\beta_{0}}+{\\beta_{1}}z_{j}+{\\beta_{2}}s_{j}+{\\beta_{3}}X_{j t}+W_{j},\n$$  \n\nwhere $L i n k_{j t}$ takes the value one if incumbent worker $j$ is linked (through the employment history) to any worker entering the establishment in year $t$ , and where $z_{j}$ is the standardized cognitive test score of the incumbent worker. We also control for the incumbent workers² years of schooling $s_{j}$ , as well as age and $a g e^{2}$ through $X_{j t}$ $W_{j}$ represent the various sets of dummy controls in the four specifications, as outlined in Section 5.1 above.17 As mentioned, we return to specifications with additional controls, variations in the measured skills and 'placebo\"'-type tests in section 6.  \n\nBased on the prediction derived from the Montgomery model, we expect that $\\beta_{1}>0$ In line with this prediction, the results in Table 2 show that able (in terms of test scores) incumbent workers are more likely to be linked to new entrants. The estimated impact of the incumbent's test score remains positive if we add firm and job characteristics to the model, although the magnitudes diminish quite substantially when we control for \"^firm type' (i.e. size-bracket specific industry dummies). Thus, high-skilled firm types are more likely to employ former coworkers of incumbent employees. As discussed above, the Montgomery model is in essence a model of between-firm differences, but to reduce the potential impact of alternative explanations we let our most stringent specification (column 4) compare incumbent workers who are employed at the same establishment. The results from this specification stil indicate that a one standard deviation higher cognitive test scores for an incumbent worker is associated with a 0.1 percentage points higher probability of being linked to an entrant. Notably however, the schooling of the incumbent worker does not have a robust relationship to the incidence of being linked to an entrant (conditional on the cognitive test scores).  \n\nIn the second panel (b) of Table A 4 in Appendix B, we replace the cognitive test score of the incumbent employee with the wage as an alternative measure of incumbent skills. In line with the results of Table 2 we find that high-wage workers are more likely to be linked to entrants, conditional on their level of schooling.18 We provide further robustness checks and analyse our placebo links in Section 6.  \n\nTable 2: Incumbent test score and linked entrants   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td>Incumbentcognitivetestscore</td><td>0.0042***</td><td>0.0017***</td><td>0.0011***</td><td>0.0011***</td></tr><tr><td>Incumbentschooling</td><td>(0.0003) 0.0016*** (0.0001)</td><td>(0.0003) 0.0006*** (0.0001)</td><td>(0.0004) 0.0002 (0.0002)</td><td>(0.0003) 0.0002 (0.0001)</td></tr><tr><td>Fixedeffects</td><td></td><td>Firm Type</td><td>Firm Type 十 Job Level</td><td>Establishment</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.0041</td><td>0.0322</td><td>0.0377</td><td>0.2086</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>359,462</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>359,462</td><td>308,136</td><td>359,462</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNotes. \\*\\* $\\mathsf{p}{<}0.01$ ， $^{\\ast\\ast}{\\mathsf{p}}{<}0.05$ $*_{{\\sf p}<0.1}$ . The level of observation is the incumbent worker and the dependent variable takes the value one if any of the entrants is a former colleague of incumbent worker $j$ in year t. Standard errors are robust to heteroscedasticity and accounting for the fact that there are multiple observations for each incumbent worker due to the panel structure of the data. Firm type is the interaction between workplace size (1-9, 10-19, 20-49, 50-99, 100-199 and 200-499) and 3-digit industry. The job level dummies refer to the first 2 digits in the occupation of the incumbent worker, observed for 85 percent of the total sample. All regressions include year dummies, incumbent characteristics (age and age2), a dummy indicating if the employer is located in one of Sweden's three metropolitan areas and log size of the establishment. The mean of the dependent variable is 0.025.  \n\n#### 5.2.2 Testable element 2: Referrals and entrant ability  \n\nThe second element of the Montgomery model which we take to the data is the prediction that employers obtain workers with better unobserved abilities when they hire workers with social links to incumbent employees. We test this prediction by measuring if the cognitive skills of entrants with links to incumbent employees are higher than the cognitive skills of entrants without such links. In this particular model, we rely on the part of the entrant test scores $(z_{i})$ which is orthogonal to schooling $(s_{i})$ as in Farber and Gibbons (1996) since the model-prediction calls for unobserved skills as the outcome variable.19 Formally, we estimate the following model:  \n\n$$\n\\hat{\\theta}_{i}=\\delta_{0}+\\delta_{1}L i n k_{i j}+\\delta_{2}z_{j}+\\delta_{3}X_{j}+W_{i j t_{0}}+\\varepsilon_{i j},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\hat{\\theta}_{i}$ is the orthogonal part of the cognitive skills, $L i n k_{i j}$ is a dummy indicating whether worker $i$ and $j$ have a social link (they worked together in the past); $z_{j}$ is the standardized cognitive test score of the incumbent worker; $X_{j}$ includes the incumbent's age and years of schooling; $W_{i j t_{0}}$ is the same vector of dummy controls as in equation (1) measured at the time of entry $\\left(t_{0}\\right)$ and $\\varepsilon_{i j}$ is the error term. We should expect to find $\\delta_{1}>0$ , if firms use referrals of former co-workers in the Montgomery-sense.  \n\nWe use the dyad-level data in this specification (i.e. with one observation for each combination of entrants and incumbent workers) since we, in variations presented below, interact incumbent workers? abilities with $L i n k_{i j}$ , and we wish to keep the same sample for consistency, but collapsing the data to the entrant level provide very similar results. The standard errors are clustered to handle the dyad structure of the data by accounting for repeated observations of both entering and incumbent workers Cameron et al. (2011).  \n\nThe estimates are reported in Panel A of Table 3. They show that linked entrants on average have between 0.13 and 0.16 standard deviations higher (residual) cognitive test scores than entrants without co-worker links. Here, we find estimates that are very stable across specifications. The estimates are only marginally affected by covariates that account for establishment type (column 2), job type (column 3), or establishment fixed effects (column 4). The results thus suggest that employers receive workers with higher (unobserved) ability, when recruiting through co-worker based networks, and that this pattern holds both between and within firms and job types.  \n\nIt should be noted that we are unable to rule out that the residual test scores are correlated with other worker characteristics that employers can observe. But, if we replace the residual test scores as the outcome variable with an easier-to-observe skill of the entrant (years of schooling) we find a robust and significant negative relationship. The estimates, reported in Panel B suggest that linked entrants have attained O.3 years less schooling than non-linked entrants. Thus, firms appear able to find workers with higher (unobserved) ability through high ability referrals although they hire entrants of lower education level.  \n\nNotably, the negative results on years of schooling are well in line with the substitutability between referrals and education implied by Casella and Hanaki's extension of the Montgomery model, as well as earlier studies showing a negative correlation between the use of social ties and educational attainment (Pellizzari, 2009).  \n\nTable 3: Links and entrant skills   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Dep. var:\"unobservable skills\"(0i)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Co-workerlink</td><td>0.1537*** (0.0283)</td><td>0.1289*** (0.0295)</td><td>0.1219*** (0.0291) Dep. var:\"observable skills\"(si)</td><td>0.1418*** (0.0258)</td></tr><tr><td>Co-workerlink</td><td>-0.4559*** (0.0853)</td><td>-0.4088*** (0.0825)</td><td>-0.4235*** (0.0793)</td><td>-0.3108*** (0.0735)</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed effects</td><td></td><td>Firm Type</td><td>Firm Type</td><td>Establishment</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>十 Job Level</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1,065,480</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td></td><td>1,065,480</td><td></td><td>1,065,480</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1,065,480</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNotes. \\*\\*\\* $\\mathsf{p}{<}0.01$ \\*\\* $\\mathsf{p}{<}0.05$ ， $^{*}{\\mathsf{p}}{<}0.1$ The level of observation is the incumbent-entrant pair. The dependent variable in the first panel is the part of the entrant's cognitive skills, $z_{i}$ which is orthogonal to years of schooling, $s_{i}$ . Standard errors are corrected to account for the dyad structure of the data by clustering on both entrants and incumbents as suggested by Cameron et al. (2011). Firm type is the interaction between firm size in 6 bins (1-9, 10-19, 20-49, 50-99, 100-199 and 200-499) interacted with 3-digit industry. The job level dummies refer to the first 2 digits in the occupation of the entrant. All regressions include year dummies, the age, schooling and standardized cognitive test score of the incumbent worker, a dummy indicating if the employer is located in one of Sweden's three metropolitan areas and the log size of the hiring plant.  \n\nBefore turning to the analysis of wages it is worth noting that the results presented so far are consistent with the notion that firms use referrals when they have high-ability employees and that an outcome of this process a further acquisition of high ability workers. A natural interpretation of this result is that the skill content of firms is likely to be path dependent.  \n\n#### 5.2.3 Employee selection, network inbreeding and multidimensional skills  \n\nOur baseline model relies on measures of cognitive abilities for worker productivity but our data also contain information about non-cognitive skills, which are based on standardized, mandatory, interviews with certified psychologists during the draft process. The psychologist evaluates non-cognitive traits that are deemed important in order to succeed in the military, such as responsibility, independence, outgoing character, persistence, emotional stability, power of initiative and social skills. The non-cognitive skills are graded on a similar 1-9 scale as the cognitive skills. The motivation for doing the military service is not taken into account when grading.20 In Table 4 we utilize this information and introduce the non-cognitive test score alongside the cognitive skills in equations 1 and 2.  \n\nThe point of this exercise is twofold; first it serves as a validation check for the use of the cognitive skills as the preferred measure of worker productivity in the high-skilled segments of the labor market. In this respect, the results clearly support that it is the cognitive skills that matter. More specifically, Panel A shows that only the cognitive skills of incumbent workers predict the hiring of linked to entrants, while their non-cognitive skills have no significant impact. Moreover, firms hiring linked entrants obtain entrants with higher average residual cognitive skills but there is no significant difference in terms of (residual) non-cognitive skills (suggested by the main effect captured by the \"co-worker link'’ estimates in Panel B).  \n\nCharacterizing incumbents and entrants in two dimensions also allows us to provide a deeper investigation of the concept of network inbreeding, the key assumption in the Montgomery model. More specifically, we test whether realized matches occur between linked workers that have similar types of qualities, as would be expected if the driving force is networks formed between agents that are fundamentally similar. In our view, the results seem more open to alternative explanations if incumbents with better cognitive (non-cognitive) abilities also \"refer’ entrants with better non-cognitive (cognitive) abilities.  \n\nWe find that the sorting indeed appear to be ability-specific. We derive this result by enriching the analysis of equation 2, interacting the main effect of being linked to an incumbent worker with the vector $z_{j}$ , now including both the incumbent link's cognitive and non-cognitive ability:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\hat{\\theta}_{i,c o g.}=\\delta_{0}+\\delta_{1}L i n k_{i j}+\\delta_{2}L i n k_{i j}\\times z_{j}+\\delta_{3}z_{j}+\\delta_{4}X_{j}+W_{i j t_{0}}+\\varepsilon_{i j}}\\ {\\hat{\\theta}_{i,n o n-c o g.}=\\delta_{0}+\\delta_{1}L i n k_{i j}+\\delta_{2}L i n k_{i j}\\times z_{j}+\\delta_{3}z_{j}+\\delta_{4}X_{j}+W_{i j t_{0}}+\\varepsilon_{i j}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIn a world with continuous skill-inbreeding we can think of this interaction as measuring the strength of the inbreeding bias (are better incumbents linked to better entrants?). The results clearly shows that incumbent cognitive skills predict entrant residual cognitive skills, while incumbent non-cognitive skills have no relationship to the entrants? cognitive abilities (panel $B$ ). Similarly, incumbent cognitive abilities are unrelated to entrants non-cognitive skills, whereas incumbent non-cognitive skills appear related to entrant non-cognitive skills although the estimates are not statistically significant.  \n\nTable 4: Employee selection and inbreeding, by type of skills   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"4\"></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\">A: Dep. var: Co-worker link (eq. 1)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Incumbent cog.test score</td><td>0.0040*** (0.0003)</td><td>0.0017*** (0.0003)</td><td>0.0010** (0.0004)</td><td>0.0010***</td></tr><tr><td>0.0007**</td><td>-0.0000</td><td>0.0001</td><td>(0.0003)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Incumbent non-cog.testscore</td><td>(0.0003)</td><td></td><td></td><td>-0.0002</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.0003) 359,462</td><td>(0.0004)</td><td>(0.0003)</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>359,462</td><td></td><td>308,137</td><td>359,462</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Fixed effects</td><td>Firm Type</td><td>Firm Type + Job Level</td><td>Establishment</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\">B: Dep. var: Entrant residual skills (eq. 2), Inbreeding highlighted in bold</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Co-worker link</td><td>0.1561***</td><td>0.1268***</td><td>Dep.var:Cognitive test scores 0.1202***</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>(0.0283)</td><td>(0.0295)</td><td>(0.0291)</td><td>0.1363*** (0.0252)</td></tr><tr><td>Co-worker link × Incumbent cog.</td><td>0.0208</td><td>0.0222*</td><td>0.0208</td><td>0.0205**</td></tr><tr><td>testscore</td><td>(0.0135)</td><td>(0.0132)</td><td>(0.0130)</td><td>(0.0102)</td></tr><tr><td>Co-worker link × Incumbent non-cog.</td><td>-0.0022</td><td>-0.0035</td><td>-0.0009</td><td>-0.0004</td></tr><tr><td>test score</td><td>(0.0103)</td><td>(0.0105)</td><td>(0.0105)</td><td>(0.0087)</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>1,065,480</td><td>1,065,480</td><td>1,065,480</td><td>1,065,480</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td></td><td>Dep.var:Non-cognitive test scores</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.0315</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Co-worker link</td><td>0.0368</td><td></td><td>0.0400</td><td>0.0171</td></tr><tr><td>(0.0401)</td><td>(0.0375)</td><td>(0.0368)</td><td>(0.0291)</td></tr><tr><td>Co-worker link × Incumbent cog.</td><td>0.0123</td><td>0.0061</td><td>0.0059</td><td>0.0019</td></tr><tr><td>test score</td><td>(0.0140)</td><td>(0.0137)</td><td>(0.0137)</td><td>(0.0116)</td></tr><tr><td>Co-worker link × Incumbent non-cog.</td><td>0.0200</td><td>0.0166</td><td>0.0143</td><td>0.0104</td></tr><tr><td>test score Observations</td><td>(0.0141)</td><td>(0.0128)</td><td>(0.0126)</td><td>(0.0102)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1,065,480</td><td>1,065,480</td><td>1,065,480</td><td>1,065,480</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Fixed effects</td><td>Firm Type</td><td>Firm Type 十 Job Level</td><td>Establishment</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes. \\*\\*\\* $\\mathsf{p}{<}0.01$ .\\* $\\mathsf{p}{<}0.05$ $^{*}{\\mathsf{p}}{<}0.1$ .

The main effect of incumbent cognitive and non-cognitive test scores are included in the regression but not reported in the table (see Table 3 for all the controls included).  \n\n### 5.3 Results on entry wages  \n\n#### 5.3.1 Testable element 3: Average entry wages  \n\nIn this subsection we turn to an analysis of the relationship between co-worker links and wages. As noted in Section 3.4 results from various countries and contexts provide very mixed results regarding the relationship between social networks and entry wages. In our application, we add to this literature by first examining the third testable element of the Montgomery element outlined in Section 3.3 (i.e. higher entry wages): Employing firms should, according to the model, expect referred workers to be more productive and therefore share parts of the expected surplus with the workers to avoid losing them to other linked firms. We use data on entering workers and capture the association between their entry wages and the Link indicator through a straightforward wage equation:  \n\n$$\nl o g(w_{i t_{0}})=\\phi_{0}+\\phi_{1}L i n k_{i t_{0}}+\\phi_{2}X_{i t_{0}}+W_{t_{0}}+\\varepsilon_{i j t_{0}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $w_{i t_{0}}$ is the entry wage of worker $i$ starting employment in year $t_{0};L i n k_{i t_{0}}=1$ if the entrant has at least one former co-worker in the new establishment and zero otherwise. $X_{i t_{0}}$ includes schooling, age and experience of the entrant. As before, $W_{t_{0}}$ denote the control variables by specification.  \n\nThe results, reported in Table 5, suggest a sizable positive wage premium for entering workers with links to existing employees consistent with the notion of Montgomery type referrals. Linked entrants have, on average, four percent higher wages than non-linked entrants. About half of this association remains when we control for firm-type in Column (2), and the estimates change very little when adding controls for job type in column (3) and even increase somewhat when we include establishment fixed effects in column (4). Notably, our within-establishment estimate of 3.6 percent is almost identical to that of  \n\nBrown et al. (2012) who analyze referred workers within a single U.S corporation.21  \n\nAlthough a positive wage effect of referrals is in line with Montgomery, it should be noted that it also is consistent with other types of network models, including the supplyside model of Calvo-Armengol and Jackson (2004), where well-connected workers earn higher wages because they have better outside options, as well as matched based models such as Simon and Warner (1992), Dustmann et al. (2011) and Brown et al. (2012) where referred workers earn higher starting salaries than non-referred workers because employers have better ex ante information about their match-specific productivity.  \n\nTable 5: Entry wages for linked and non-linked entrants   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td>Co-workerlink</td><td>0.0461*** (0.0068)</td><td>0.0299*** (0.0061)</td><td>0.0297*** (0.0059)</td><td>0.0360*** (0.0071)</td></tr><tr><td>Fixedeffects</td><td></td><td>Firm Type</td><td>Firm Type + Job Level</td><td>Establ.</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>28,414</td><td>28,414</td><td>28,414</td><td>28,414</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.2871</td><td>0.4026</td><td>0.4325</td><td>0.6820</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNotes.\\*\\*\\* $\\mathsf{p}{<}0.01$ ，\\* $\\mathsf{p}{<}0.05$ $^{*}p{<}0.1$ The level of observation is the entrant worker and the dependent variable is the (log) entry wage.

The regressions also include year dummies, entrant background characteristics (years of schooling, a full set of age and experience dummies), a dummy indicating whether the workplace is located in one of Sweden's three metropolitan areas (Stockholm) and the log size of the hiring plant.  \n\n#### 5.3.2 Testable element 4: Entry wages and incumbent skills  \n\nA more unique prediction following the fundamental logic of the Montgomery model is that entering workers signal their productivity through the abilities of linked incumbent employees. Thus, we expect workers to receive a payoff from the skills of other members of their networks, which we listed as the fourth testable element in Section 3.3. Networks convey a signal of the entrants true productivity due to the inbreeding bias. This signal feeds into entry wages if firms fear that some competing recruiters may have access to the same information. The logic of the model therefore suggests that entry wages should be higher for entrants that are linked to high ability incumbents than they are for workers who are linked to less able incumbents.  \n\nTo test the prediction that entry wages are a function of the linked incumbent worker's ability, we use the full data, including all combinations of entrants and incumbents, in order to relate the wages of entrants to the measured skills of the linked incumbents. Formally, we estimate :  \n\n$$\nl o g(w_{i t_{0}})=\\gamma_{0}+\\gamma_{1}(L i n k_{i j}\\times z_{j})+\\gamma_{2}L i n k_{i j}+\\gamma_{3}z_{j}+\\gamma_{4}s_{i}+X_{i j t_{0}}+W_{j t_{0}}+\\varepsilon_{i t_{0}}\n$$  \n\nwhere the dependent variable is the entry wage and, as before, $L i n k_{i j}$ is an indicator for having worked together in the past, $z_{j}$ is the skill of incumbent workers, $s_{i}$ measures entrant observable skills (years of schooling), $X_{i t_{0}}$ measures demographic characteristics of the entering worker at the time of entry and $W_{t_{0}}$ denote the control variables by specification. As before, we cluster standard errors for repeated observations of both entering and incumbent workers using the procedure suggested by Cameron et al. (2011).  \n\nBy including $z_{j}$ , which capture the impact of co-worker skills in general, we parametrically control for many of the unobserved differences between establishments that could motivate differences in pay between workers depending on the skill structure of the firm. Hence, if there are general returns from entering a firm with a skilled labor force, this will becaptured by $\\gamma_{3}$  \n\nEstimation results are reported in Table 6. The first row of the table shows that entry wages are related to the skills of linked incumbent workers. Entry wages are 1.3 percent higher for each standard deviation of incumbent worker's ability, which corresponds to the impact of one year of own schooling in this sample. The association drops somewhat when accounting for differences related to the type of establishment and job, but remains statistically significant also in the establishment fixed effects specification. The latter suggests a wage impact of about 0.84 percent per standard deviation in test scores, or about one third of the impact of one year of own schooling.22 We interpret the association between entry wages and the ability of the linked worker as strong support for a signaling value of networks along the lines of the Montgomery-model.  \n\nNote that the model does not account for entrant test scores. The reason is that we expect a wage premium from the incumbent worker's skills precisely because these help firms to make inference about the entrant's unobserved skills. However, the estimate is only slightly reduced if we do account for the entrants’ own test score (it changes from 0.0084 (s.e. 0.0035) to 0.0078 (s.e. 0.0035)). The fact that the wage premia from incumbent workers remains even after controlling for the skills of the entrant is in line with Montgomery's notion that employers discriminate on the basis of expected rather than actual productivity, which in turn generates wage differences between entrants with identical skills.  \n\nTable 6: Entry wages as a function of links and incumbent skills   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td>Incumbentskills:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Co-workerlinkxCognitivetestscore</td><td>0.0137***</td><td>0.0129***</td><td>0.0114**</td><td>0.0084**</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Co-workerlink</td><td>(0.0053)</td><td>(0.0049)</td><td>(0.0049)</td><td>(0.0035)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0184*</td><td>0.0075</td><td>0.0085</td><td>0.0207***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Cognitivetestscore</td><td>(0.0105)</td><td>(0.0101)</td><td>(0.0099)</td><td>(0.0083)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0263***</td><td>0.0127***</td><td>0.0113***</td><td>-0.0001***</td></tr><tr><td>Entrant skills:</td><td>(0.0013)</td><td>(0.0010)</td><td>(0.0009)</td><td>(0.0000)</td></tr><tr><td>Schooling</td><td>0.0267*** (0.0013)</td><td>0.0279*** (0.0013)</td><td>0.0215***</td><td>0.0185***</td></tr><tr><td>Fixedeffects</td><td></td><td>Firm Type</td><td>(0.0013) Firm Type</td><td>(0.0013) Establishment</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>十 Job Level</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>1,065,480</td><td>1,065,480</td><td>1,065,480</td><td>1,065,480</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.3191</td><td>0.0519</td><td>0.0307</td><td>0.0127</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNotes.\\*\\*\\* $\\mathsf{p}{<}0.01$ $^{\\ast\\ast}{\\mathsf{p}}{<}0.05$ $^{*}p{<}0.1$ The level of observation is the incumbent-entrant pair. Standard errors are corrected to account for the dyad structure of the data by clustering on both entrants and incumbents as suggested by Cameron et al. (2011). The cognitive skills have been mean centered to facilitate interpretation. The job level dummies refer to the first 2 digits in the occupation of the entrant. Firm type refers to the interaction between firm size in 6 bins (1-9, 10-19, 20-49, 50-99, 100-199 and 200-499) interacted with 3-digit industry. The regressions also include year dummies, incumbent years of schooling, and incumbent years of schooling interacted with the \"'co-worker link\"' dummy, entrant background characteristics (a full set of age and experience dummies), a dummy indicating whether the workplace is located in one of Sweden's three metropolitan areas, and the log size of the hiring plant.  \n\n# 6 Placebo and robustness  \n\n### 6.1 Evidence from placebo links  \n\nA key advantage of our broad data set is that we are able to present an empirical test assessing to what extent the patterns we derive are due to the personal interactions (networks) we are interested in or if it stems from alternative factors related to the labor market history. To this end we use the two sets of \"placebo-linked’ workers defined in Section 4.1 to see if the empirical patterns are similar for entrants who are not linked, but who still share employment patterns with incumbent workers in a similar fashion as the linked entrants. Our first test defines entrants as placebo-linked of Type I if they previously worked for the same employer as an incumbent employee, but at a different point in time (but less than three years apart). Our second test, defines entrants as placebo-linked of Type $I I$ if they simultaneously worked within the same firm (and establishment-level industry), but within a different establishment, as an incumbent worker. The point of these exercises is to assess whether the associations we measure are driven by other, non-network, aspects related to the joint work histories of the employees. This includes the possibility that employers draw inference from the firms or the actual establishments, rather than from referrals as such, which may convey a similar type of information as the referrals we have in mind.  \n\nIt is clear however that incumbent workers are likely to know some of the placebolinks if they have overlapping networks through intermediaries. If this is the case, and such overlapping networks also result in referrals, we should see evidence of Montgomerytype effects also in the placebo analysis. We therefore interpret the placebo exercises as providing a very conservative baseline for our main analysis (see also Kramarz and Skans for similar tests).  \n\nTable A 5 in Appendix B contrasts the baseline results to the results for the placebolinks. To conserve space we rely on the establishment fixed effects specification throughout. The results, with one exception, do not suggest that key elements of the Montgomery model are present for placebo-linked workers of either type. The one exception is the impact of incumbent ability on the probability of hiring a placebo-linked worker of Type I (see Panel A). Here we find a significant effect which is less than half as large as when analyzing actual links. The estimate thus suggests that employers are more likely to recruit workers from the establishments where their high ability workers used to work in the past. The difference in magnitude between actual links and placebo links does however suggest that the direct personal interaction at the workplace between the incumbent worker and prospective employees reinforces this process. The estimates for placebo linked workers of Type I are positive, but insignificant, in this specification.  \n\nThe results related to equations 2-6 are all small in magnitude and statistically insignificant for both types of placebo links: Placebo linked entrants are not more skilled than other entrants to the same firms (Panel B). Placebo linked entrants do not earn higher wages than other entrants to the same firms (Panel C). And placebo linked entrants do not earn higher wages if they have a placebo link to a high skilled incumbent worker (Panel D).  \n\nIn order to assess if the samples used for the placebo-links are comparable to those of the actual links, we also present models where we introduce placebo-links alongside actual links into the same model.23 Here we restrict the sample to employers hiring both true and placebo links over the sample period. This exercise is however not possible to execute for equation 1 where the links serve as the dependent variable. For all other models we do however find a very similar pattern as in the main analysis, although with dwindling precision in some cases.  \n\nOverall, we interpret the evidence from this exercise as reassuring. The regularities we document in the baseline analysis appear to require a history of direct interactions between the involved agents. Indirect effects caused by, or transmitted through, the work history, or the firm as such appear to be confined to the first of our four testable elements (if at all present), and even in this case with a heavily muted impact compared to that of the actual links.  \n\n### 6.2 Covariates and samples  \n\nIn our main specifications we tried to keep a uniform set of covariates for ease of exposition. But in Table A 6 we include various additional controls capturing incumbent and entrant characteristics to equations 1-6. As in the placebo analysis above, we rely on the establishment fixed effects specification throughout.  \n\nPanel A repeats the estimates from equation 1. To recap, this model estimates the association between the skills of incumbent workers and the probability of having at least one former co-worker among the set of new hires. A potential concern with the baseline specifications of this model is that high-ability workers may have a larger network or contacts with a stronger labor force attachment, which could explain why they more often are linked to entrants. To investigate whether the effects are driven by the characteristics of the networks, we add controls for the size of the incumbent worker's total network (defined from past co-workers) as well as the quality of this network as indicated by the employment rate within the network.24 As is evident from the results in column (2) of Table A 6, the estimated effect of interest is unaffected by the inclusion of these controls. Both network size and network employment rate are however significantly and positively associated with the probability of hiring a co-worker link (not reported in the table).25  \n\nPanel B reports the association between a co-worker link and the entrant's residual cognitive skills as specified in equation 2. In order to reduce the potential for a spurious correlation, we include the same controls for the incumbent worker's network as in  \n\nPanel A, but also add the controls for the entrant's total number of former employers, as well as monthly earnings on the previous job.26 The point of adding these two additional sets of controls is to account for aspects of the networks of both incumbent and the entering workers which may be correlated with the ability measures of the agents on both sides. The estimated effect of interest is, again, very similar to the effect in our baseline specification.  \n\nPanel C and D report results regarding entry wages corresponding to equations 5 and 6 respectively. Here we add variables capturing the entering worker's total number of former employers and monthly earnings in the previous job (as in Panel B).27 As in panels A and B, these variables do not affect the estimates of interest. We interpret this as suggesting that the entry wage impact of referrals, and of linked workers’ skills, are not due to omitted variables that are correlated with network characteristics.  \n\nWe also evaluated the sensitivity of our estimates to variations of the type of controls for observable skills, modelled as a linear function of the entrant's years of schooling in our main analysis. More specifically, we ran specifications replacing the years of schooling with indicators for the highest completed level of education of the entrant as well as for the detailed (4-digit) field of education. Overall these results were similar to the ones reported in our main analysis, which supports the idea that the test scores, given the number of years of schooling, capture correlates of productivity that are difficult to observe for employers at the time of the hire.  \n\nOur main sample consist of private sector employees. But we have also reestimated the model using the full sample which also include the universe of public sector employees. The results, which are presented in the final column of Table A 6 in Appendix B are very similar (although in most cases somewhat muted) as when focusing on the private  \n\nsector sample.  \n\n### 6.3  Extending the analysis to low-skilled jobs  \n\nWe have so far tested the elements of the Montgomery model when firms hire workers to fill high-skilled jobs. In this section we turn our focus to the low-skilled jobs in order to assess the model's ability to explain the sorting and wage patterns in the low-skilled segments of the labor market. We utilize the information on both cognitive and noncognitive test scores, as previous research suggests that non-cognitive skills may be more relevant for individual productivity in the low-skilled labor market (see e.g. Lindqvist and Vestman (2011)). On a similar note Brown et al. (2012) argue that different traits may be valued at different positions within the firm (e.g. simpler traits such as punctuality in positions with lower educational requirements, and strategic thinking higher up in the hierarchy) and that firms may use referrals to detect different types of worker skills needed at different levels of the within-firm hierarchy.  \n\nTwo indications consistent with this notion are found in Appendix B. First, the difference in cognitive ability between workers in high-skilled and low-skilled jobs is almost twice as large as the difference in non-cognitive skills (see Table A 3). Second, although the probability of hiring a linked entrant has a positive relationship to the wages of incumbents at high-skilled and low-skilled jobs, the impact of cognitive abilities have opposing signs (see Table A 4). This contrast is a clear indication that the cognitive skills fail to capture the relevant aspects of the referral process in low-skilled jobs.  \n\nTable 7 contrasts all our results (element by element) for the high-skilled jobs with those obtained for low-skilled jobs. Although some elements appear to be present also for the low skilled jobs, our general impression is that the data are less in line with the model for these jobs. As when Burks et al. (2013) analyze call centers and truckers, links do not result in entrants with better cognitive or non-cognitive skills in our broad sample of low skilled jobs, although network inbreeding is still present. The results further suggest a notable heterogeneity in the importance of different types of skills along the lines suggested by Lindqvist and Vestman (2011). In particular, while cognitive skills are a better predictor of linked hires in high-skilled jobs, it is the non-cognitive skills of the incumbent worker that predict the recruitments of linked entrants into low skilled jobs. On a similar note, the incumbent's non-cognitive skills appear to predict both cognitive and non-cognitive scores among the linked entrants for the low-skilled jobs (panel B.2). For both types of jobs, the linked incumbent's cognitive score only predict the entrant's cognitive score.  \n\nThe wage results show an insignificant wage return for low-skilled jobs (Panel C). For both types of jobs we do however find that the entry wage of linked entrants is associated with the (cognitive and non-cognitive) skills of their incumbent link, although precision is an issue and the estimate appear smaller for the low-skilled (Panel D).  \n\nTable 7: Extension to non-cognitive test scores and low skilled jobs   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1) High-skilled jobs</td><td>(2) Low-skilled jobs</td></tr><tr><td>A:Dep.var: Co-worker link (eq.1)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Incumbent cognitive test score</td><td>0.0010***</td><td>-0.0009***</td></tr><tr><td>(0.0003)</td><td>(0.0003)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Incumbent non-cognitive test score</td><td>-0.0002</td><td>0.0007**</td></tr><tr><td>(0.0003)</td><td>(0.0003)</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>359,462</td><td>509,972</td></tr><tr><td>B:Dep. var: Entrant residual skills (eq.3 and 4)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Co-worker link</td><td>1.Dep.var:Cognitive test scores 0.1363***</td><td>0.0046</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Co-workerlink×Incumbentcognitive test score</td><td>(0.0256)</td><td>(0.0184)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0205**</td><td>0.0356***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Co-worker link × Incumbent non-cognitive test score</td><td>(0.0102)</td><td>(0.0088)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.0004</td><td>0.0266***</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>(0.0087) 1,065,480</td><td>(0.0068)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2.

This paper has provided an empirical assessment of the key aspects of this model, using an empirical strategy which builds on the literature on employer learning as formulated by, in particular, Altonji and Pierret (2001). Using a very large Swedish register data set with information on co-worker networks, wages, AFQT scores, and indicators of non-cognitive abilities, we show several pieces of evidence suggesting that key elements of the Montgomery model of referrals are well aligned with the data in the high-skilled segment of the labor market.  \n\nIn particular we first find that high ability workers are more likely to be linked to entering workers and that the test scores of entrants and linked incumbents are correlated. Previous research suggests that cognitive abilities are closely related to individual productivity among the high skilled, whereas non-cognitive abilities are more important for the low skilled (Lindqvist and Vestman, 2011). Consistent with this notion, we show that recruitments of previous coworkers mainly appear to be related to cognitive scores for the more skill demanding jobs, whereas recruitments of previous coworkers appear more closely linked to the non-cognitive scores of the incumbent worker when jobs are less skill intensive. In line with models of network inbreeding between similar individuals, the analysis also suggests that referral recruitments are ability specific: incumbent cognitive abilities only predict linked entrants’ cognitive abilities, whereas incumbent non-cognitive abilities primarily predict linked entrants? non-cognitive abilities.  \n\nSecond, we show that entering workers receive higher entry wages if they have links with an existing employee and that this wage premium is increasing in the abilities of the linked incumbent worker. This result is in line with the model suggesting that employers discriminate between observably equivalent workers based on the ability of their social links when setting entry wages.  \n\nOverall, the paper provides one of the first large-sample documentations of the role played by networks for the behavior on the demand-side of the labor market. The results suggest that mechanisms related to uncertainty about worker qualities in the employeeselection process is a key explanation for why firms rely on employee networks when searching for new workers. As a result, referrals foster endogenous skill sorting between firms. In addition, the results support the notion that workers who are embedded in low ability social networks will be profiled as low productive since they remain in the pool of adversely selected workers who use formal search channels. The results therefore imply that the use of networks is a source of wage inequality, and that changes in the social structure can affect the wage distribution.  \n\n## References  \n\nAltonji, J.

Following the work of Farber and Gibbons (1996), Altonji and Pierret (2001) and Lange (2007) on employer learning we assume that cognitive test scores are a valid measure of such skills. Altonji and Pierret (2001) specify the productivity of individual $i$ in time $t$ as:  \n\n$$\ny_{i,t}=r s_{i}+\\mu q_{i}+\\kappa z_{i}+\\eta_{i}+E(t_{i})\n$$  \n\nwhere employers observe $(s_{i},q_{i})$ while $(z_{i},\\eta_{i})$ are unobserved. $(s_{i},z_{i})$ observed by econometrician and $E(t_{i})$ is the experience profile of productivity. Observed and unobserved skill components are assumed to be correlated. Firms cannot observe $z_{i}$ , but draw inference about $z_{i}$ by observing $s_{i},q_{i}$ and the productivity tracks workers accumulate with experience. As employers learn by experience, wages should become increasingly aligned with true productivity, hence also ability scores, and less aligned with the easily observed characteristics such as schooling in a competitive labor market.  \n\nWe replicate the analysis in Altonji and Pierret (2001) using male workers in 1997 to 2007. We use the same administrative data as for the main analysis to create a dataset containing individual demographics (age, education level and field) and the full-time equivalent monthly wage. In addition we construct measures of potential experience, counted from when the person leaves school (i.e. negative values are excluded). The wages are measured once a year (in September or October) and available for all public sector employees and a sample of private sector employees. The sampling is stratified by firm size and industry covering 30 percent of all private sector employees in total.  \n\nWe focus on the cohorts of males who went through the mandatory draft procedure at age 18 in 1969-1997.28 The cognitive tests provide an evaluation of cognitive ability based on several subtests of logical, verbal and spatial abilities and are similar to the  \n\nAFQT in the US. Individuals are graded on a 1-9 scale, which we standardize within each cohort of draftees.  \n\nWe regress log wages on schooling, $s_{i}$ and ability $z_{i}$ , interacted with experience replicating the same specification as Altonji and Pierret (2001). Thus, the estimating equation controls for calender year dummies, a cubic in experience, as well as education and cognitive standardized test scores interacted with a cubic time trend (base year 2007). We perform the analysis on the stock of male employees with non-missing wages during the period 1997-2007.  \n\nTable A 1 displays descriptive statistics for both samples and Table A 2 reports the returns to schooling and test scores by experience. Overall, the picture concur with the conclusions of Altonji and Pierret (2001). First, cognitive test scores have a strong relationship with wages after controlling for education; a one standard deviation increase is associated with an increase in the log wage of 0.04. Second, the effects of education on wages is estimated to increase with experience if we assume that the impact of cognitive abilities is constant. Third, the relationship changes dramatically when we also let the returns to cognitive test scores change with experience (Column 2). Here, we find a sharp contrast between the two skill measures: The returns to schooling is close to flat from a non-trivial initial level (0.04). But the initial impact of cognitive test scores is essentially zero (0.004) and instead grows sharply with experience (0.02 per year).29  \n\nWe proceed by extend the analysis from Altonji and Pierret (2001) in a couple of ways which we find illustrative for the purpose of this paper. First, we included worker fixed effects in the regressions to account for selection in and out of employment. Obviously, this precludes us from estimating the direct impact of the skill measures, but the interactions with experience are still identified. As shown in Column (3) these interactions clearly diverge, with a positive interaction estimate for ability scores and a negative interaction estimate for schooling. Next, we examine how the returns to schooling and test scores change along the duration of an employment spell. Here, we account for a fixed effect for each interaction between a worker and a workplace identifier. The results displayed in Columns (4) are very similar to those of Column (3), suggesting that employer learning affect worker's wages also within ongoing employment spells. This part is important since our main analysis rests on the presumption that recruiting employers, in general, are partially uninformed about entrant abilities at the time of recruitment.30  \n\nFinally, in Column (5), we add non-cognitive test scores from the enlistment procedure as an additional measure of skills that are difficult to observe for employers at the time of recruitment. The non-cognitive test scores are based on standardized, mandatory, interviews with certified psychologists during the draft process aimed to evaluate traits to succeed in the military, such as responsibility, independence, outgoing character, persistence, emotional stability, power of initiative and social skills. The schooling coefficient remains negative when we include the non-cognitive skills, and the interaction between non-cognitive skills and experience is 0.0213, suggesting a positive increase in the returns to both cognitive and non-cognitive traits with labor market experience (the correlation between the cognitive and non-cognitive test score is 0.36).  \n\nTable A 1: Summary statistics   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>mean</td><td>sd</td><td>p50</td><td>min</td><td>max</td></tr><tr><td>Logof annual wage</td><td>10.05</td><td>.345</td><td>9.99</td><td>8.66</td><td>14.03</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>37.98</td><td>8.48</td><td>38</td><td>18</td><td>63</td></tr><tr><td>Potentialexperience</td><td>22.92</td><td>12.03</td><td>23</td><td>0</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Tenureatworkplace</td><td>6.44</td><td>4.35</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Yearsofschooling</td><td>12.89</td><td>2.64</td><td>12</td><td>8</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Cognitivetestscore</td><td>5.35</td><td>1.92</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Non-cognitivetestscore</td><td>5.21</td><td>1.70</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Standardizedtestscore</td><td>.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>-.11</td><td>-2.69</td><td>2.75</td></tr><tr><td>Standardized non-cog.test score</td><td>.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>-.11</td><td>-2.87</td><td>3.76</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Correlation cog.and non-c.test scores</td><td></td><td>0.36</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTable A 2: Returns to skills by experience   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"6\">Panel A-Full sample</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>4</td><td>(5)</td></tr><tr><td>Schooling</td><td>0.0334*** (0.0002)</td><td>0.0400*** (0.0002)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cognitivetestscore</td><td>0.0424*** (0.0001) 0.0121***</td><td>0.0044*** (0.0005) 0.0078***</td><td>-0.0120***</td><td>-0.0111***</td><td>-0.0114***</td></tr><tr><td>Schoolingxexperience</td><td>(0.0000)</td><td>(0.0000) 0.0225***</td><td>(0.0002) 0.0031***</td><td>(0.0002) 0.0144***</td><td>(0.0002) 0.0072***</td></tr><tr><td>CognitivetestscoreXexperience Non-cognitivetestscoreX experience</td><td></td><td>(0.0001)</td><td>(0.0011)</td><td>(0.0012)</td><td>(0.0012) 0.0213***</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.492</td><td>0.496</td><td>0.918</td><td>0.949</td><td>(0.0003) 0.949</td></tr><tr><td>Educationfield</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>Workerfixedeffects</td><td>no</td><td>no</td><td>no</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>Worker*Workplacefixedeffects</td><td>no</td><td>no</td><td>no</td><td>no</td><td>yes</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNotes.\\*\\* $^{\\ast}{\\sf p}<0.01$ ，\\*\\* $\\mathsf{p}{<}0.05$ $^{\\star}{\\sf p}<0.1$ .

Thus, when facing organized labor, management has an incentive to preserve the information asymmetry with outsiders. This study uses a sample from a large cross-section of the economy over several years to test this relation. Results are consistent with this prediction. Strong organized labor is associated with higher bid-ask spreads, higher probability of informed trading, lower trading volume and lower analyst coverage. These relations hold after controlling for numerous factors such as growth opportunities or risk.  \n\nAuthor: Gilles Hilary, acgh $@$ ust.hk, HKUST, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Tel: $+852~/~2358{-}7579$ ,Fax: $+852$ / 2358-1693.

I would also like to thank the Wei Lun Foundation for its financial support.  \n\n## 1 Introduction  \n\nThis study examines if “strong” organized labor (i.e., labor able to extract a large proportion of the firm's resources) is associated with higher information asymmetry between informed and uninformed investors in the financial markets.  \n\nThe literature has already documented that firms facing strong labor tend to select income-decreasing accounting choices. However, the link between labor and information asymmetry is less understood. Unions need information to function effectively but management may hide information that labor is unable to extract by itself. For example, Leap (1991) notes “the union generally does not have access to the employer's production, financial, and personnel information” and may have to sue to obtain some of this information. Nevertheless, management does not have to reveal business and trade secrets to labor negotiators. Hence, management retains discretion on what should or should not be revealed. A seemingly accepted view among practitioners is that further reducing the information asymmetry would be damaging to management. Several studies (detailed in Section I) support this view. They indicate that information sharing is associated with increased bargaining power among American unions.  \n\nThe empirical results presented in this study are consistent with this idea. Specifically, they show strong organized labor is significantly and positively correlated with bid-ask spreads and probabilities of informed trading (PIN) but negatively correlated with trading volume and analyst coverage. The links are robust to different econometric specifications and hold both in cross-sectional and in panel settings. Additional tests rule out the possibility that the association with spreads is due to higher administrative or inventory costs (idiosyncratic risk). For example, the standard deviations of both prices and returns are lower for firms with strong labor, suggesting that idiosyncratic risk and the inventory component of the spreads is not higher for those firms. This indicates that the association is due to information asymmetry, the third component of spreads. This interpretation is reinforced by the negative relation between strong labor and analyst coverage, an alternative proxy for information asymmetry unaffected by micro-structure issues.  This relation is robust to different controls for idiosyncratic risk, growth opportunities and numerous other factors such as market structure, size, economic performance, outside monitoring, complexity of the firm, managerial incentives and the importance of the cost of capital for the firm. In other words, the asymmetry is not due to an intrinsically greater uncertainty about the corporate performance or growth of those firms.  \n\nThis study contributes to the literature by establishing an empirical link between labor strength and information asymmetry in financial markets. The result, based on a large cross-section of firms over several years, is robust to alternative empirical specifications. It furthers our understanding of the informational environment in relation to stakeholders. This approach differs from, but complements, research on the effect of labor on accounting choices. In particular, it is consistent with the perception by American managers that reducing information asymmetry is harmful to their interests.  \n\nThe rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Part II reviews prior literature and develops the main hypothesis. Part MI describes the empirical design. Part IV provides the main results. Part V offers some concluding remarks.  \n\n### I1. Literature review and hypothesis development  \n\n1.1. Does information asymmetry help management in labor negotiations?  \n\nA seemingly accepted view among practitioners is that reducing the information asymmetry with labor would be damaging to the management. For example, Reynolds, Masters and Moser (1998) state in a commonly used manual on labor relations that “an important feature of the [labor] negotiations is an effort to conceal or even misrepresent one's true position\". This idea is supported by empirical, clinical and experimental evidence.  \n\nEmpirically, Kleiner and Bouillon (1988) report that information sharing is associated with increased bargaining power for American unions. They interpret this result as suggesting that more information enables unions to bargain more effectively and gain more resources. They examine the effects of management-initiated information sharing  with production employees  in 106 union and  non-union manufacturing businesses. Their results show that disclosing information about the firm's financial condition, productivity, future investments and relative wages was significantly related to higher levels of wages and benefits for production employees in both unionized and nonunionized firms. Contrary to managers? expectations, providing additional information did not improve productivity. Scott (1994) describes how Canadian firms facing a higher likelihood of strike or operating in an industry with high average salaries reduce the amount of information provided on pension-related issues.  \n\nClinical results also support the idea that reducing information asymmetry helps unions. Frost (2000) describes examples of decentralized bargaining between local unions and plant managers about restructuring an industrial process. She lists “accessing information\"’ as one of the key factors for local unions to secure favorable results. The local negotiations that Frost observed were different from tri-annual firm-wide talks and were conducted over several years. This suggests that the importance of information is not limited to major negotiations but that there is a continuous demand for information from the unions. Kochan and Katz (1988) report that few mechanisms exist in the United States for entry-level labor-management information compared with countries with less adversarial systems. This result is also consistent with the observation that American managers perceive that reducing their informational advantage over labor is damaging.  \n\nExperimental evidence is also consistent with this hypothesis. For example, Croson (1996) offers the results of the following experiment.  A fully informed “Proposer” and a “Responder’ share $\\$10$ if they can both agree on the split. The \"Responder’ may or may not be informed about the total pay-off. Croson reports that the \"Proposer”’ makes significantly lower offers when the “Responder” is not informed and that the “Responder’ is more likely to accept the (lower) offer when uninformed. This form of bargaining is clearly a special case. In particular, it ignores dynamic aspects of the negotiation. However, this result would suggest that management would be better off negotiating with an uninformed labor.  \n\n#### 1. 2. A possible theoretical explanation.  \n\nIf the results discussed in the previous section suggest that reducing information asymmetry with labor is costly, they do not address the issue of why such costs may exist.  The following discussion provides an explanation that is consistent with this apparent cost. However, it is important to note that this study does not aim to test any model in particular.  Instead, it presents empirical results consistent both with the preliminary empirical results above and with the intuition discussed below.  \n\nAnalytical research suggests the existence of benefits from voluntary revealation of information to capital markets.1 The empirical literature generally supports the existence of these benefits.2 In the absence of costs (e.g., Jovanovic (1982)) or uncertainty about the existence of information (e.g., Dye (1985), Jung and Kwon (1988)), the theoretical literature suggests that firms should follow a policy of fully eliminating the information asymmetry. The main intuition is that, when a price-maximizing manager withholds information, investors' suspicions about the quality of the investment are so great that they discount its quality to the point where the manager is better off with a policy of entirely removing the information asymmetry.?  \n\nHowever, in the presence of economically significant stakeholders, the manager must balance her actions to consider the potentially conflicting goals of all parties (e.g. employees, shareholders) that may affect her objective function. This complexity affects the financial communication policy. The often-maintained hypothesis in the earnings management literature is that managers have incentives to artificially increase reported earnings.4 However, those facing strong labor also have incentives to bias reported results downward. For example, Cullinan and Knoblett (1994) find that labor influences accounting policy choices in several industries. Bowen, DuCharme and Shores (1995) report that labor-intensive firms or firms that offer a defined pension benefit are more likely to adopt income-decreasing accounting methods. D'Souza, Jacob and Ramesh (2001) report that unionized firms are more likely to use the immediate recognition option under SFAS 106.  \n\nThe relative importance of these conflicting goals (i.e., over- versus underreporting) in any given period is not obvious for outsiders. For example, DeAngelo and DeAngelo (1991) document the use of accounting numbers to obtain concessions from unionized workers in the steel industry during the 1980s. The authors show that managers report larger losses in years when labor negotiations occurred. This finding may be surprising. Considering that the  stel industry  was  experiencing dificult economic times and declining stock prices, one may have expected the firms to try to over-report earnings instead of artificially depressing them.  Making matters more complicated, managerial objectives are likely to change over time as a function of expected investments, technology changes, manager's time horizons and other strategic considerations. These shifts are not readily observable by outsiders or by labor.6  \n\nIn turn, this uncertainty about managerial objectives in any given period7 may prevent the receiver from unraveling any bias in reporting. For example, Cukierman and Meltzer (1986)8 show that, even if the information recipients have rational expectations and are capable of learning, biasing is still beneficial for the manager.9 The intuition is that the manager “derives a positive gain, on average, from the ability to create surprises because it can allocate large positive surprises to periods in which [the incentive to positively bias] is relatively high and leave the inevitable negative surprises for periods with relatively low values of (the incentive to positively bias)\". Thus, the uncertainty concerning her objectives gives a valuable option to the manager to convincingly manipulate reporting, both for financial markets and for labor negotiations.1o Fisher and  \n\nVerrecchia (2000) propose a model where the ex ante\" net benefit of biasing the report is positive if there is sufficient uncertainty about managerial objectives.  \n\nAdditional revelation of information by the firm would reduce the value of this option by making more apparent both the goals of the managers and the methods used to manipulate reporting. For example, revealing the intention to close a factory in the near future would hint that managers are currently trying to bias earnings downward; revealing information about unconsolidated subsidiaries may indicate how this bias has been obtained. Since revelation of information is costly in this case, the manager has an interest in reducing it and in behaving strategically to maintain her informational advantage. For example, Cukierman and Meltzer (1986) show that the manager will reduce the speed at which the public becomes aware of changes in managerial objectives when the incentives to over report are lower on average or when the uncertainty concerning managerial objectives in each period is higher.12 This would be true when managers are facing strong labor.  \n\nNote that, in this framework, the manager considers ex ante the expected benefit of the option versus the cost of opacity (e.g., a higher cost of capital) and selects the optimal policy based on these expectations. To the extent that revealing information irredeemably damages the possibility of manipulating information (for example, by forfeiting the possibility in the future of pretending that certain information is unavailable),13 the influence of labor on the level of the information revealed should be stable over time and should not be affected by temporary shocks, such as current labor negotiations or momentary weak economic performance. This can be related to findings suggesting  that  disclosure  policies  are  not  systematically  modified around  labor negotiations. For example, Yamaji (1986) finds that earnings are not harder to forecast around labor negotiations. Liberty and Zimmerman (1986) and Mautz and Richardson (1992) find no change in accounting policy around labor negotiations.  \n\nIn summary, absent any cost of revealing information, theory suggests that managers should be entirely forthcoming. However, strong labor creates uncertainty about managerial incentives to over or under-report economic performance.  This uncertainty gives management a valuable option to convincingly manipulate reporting, for both financial markets and labor negotiations. Additional reduction in information asymmetry is costly because it reduces the value of this option. This view is consistent with extant empirical literature that suggests that reducing information asymmetry will enable labor to extract more resources. This motivates the expectation of a higher level of information asymmetry compared to firms that do not have a similar option to bias.  \n\n#### 1.3. Empirical challenges.  \n\nThis  study examines  direct  measures of information asymmetry  (discussed below). An alternative approach would be to focus on measures of raw disclosure (e.g., the number of press conferences) instead of information asymmetry, a measure of relative disclosure (e.g., the amount disclosed conditional on what is known by the manager). However, this approach would have at least two empirical problems.  \n\nFirst, unions and financial markets have numerous alternative sources of information. It is not immediately clear which ones should be used. This would not necessarily be a problem if all media where complements but prior literature suggests that various channels of raw disclosure may be substitutes for each other. For example, Tasker (1998) finds an inverse relation between the informativeness of a firm's financial statements and the likelihood that the firm will use quarterly conference calls. Therefore, focusing on any particular medium may lead to spurious conclusions on the overall level of disclosure. On the other hand, proxies used in this study (trade-based measures and analyst coverage) are summary statistics for relative disclosure and enable us to bypass this issue.  \n\nSecond, raw disclosure is likely to be endogenous with respect to information asymmetry. Absent any strategic considerations, a firm with high intrinsic asymmetry may increase raw disclosure, for example, to reduce the cost of capital. In other words, observing a high level of disclosure may indicate a high level of intrinsic information asymmetry. In principle, one could empirically address this endogeneity concern by using a Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) procedure. Absent such a specification, results would be difficult to interpret. However, this analysis would require having good proxies for raw disclosure and for the intrinsic asymmetry, being able to correctly specify the different functional forms and finding instruments to estimate the parameters. This seems to be a serious empirical challenge. For example, instruments correlated with information asymmetry but not with the error term of the raw disclosure regression are not obvious. As an alternative empirical strategy, I directly estimate the relation between information asymmetry and labor strength. To frame the issue in econometric terms, I estimate the reduced form system instead of the structural model.  \n\nTo summarize, the link between labor strength and raw disclosure is not empirically tested to avoid several empirical problems such as the correlation between disclosure media and the endogeneity between raw disclosure and  information asymmetry. Instead, the main hypothesis being tested is that labor strength is associated with higher information asymmetry in financial markets.  \n\n#### 1.4. Proxies for information asymmetry.  \n\nTo test this hypothesis, I consider two types of proxies that are commonly used to measure information asymmetry: trade-based measures (bid-ask spread, in particular) and analyst coverage.  \n\n#### 2.4.1. The relation between information asymmetry and bid-ask spread  \n\nThe literature (e.g., Stoll (1989), Callahan, Lee and Yohn (1997)) explains that bid-ask spreads contain three components: order-processing costs, inventory holding costs and adverse selection costs. Order processing costs are the administrative costs for clearing the transactions. Inventory costs are the costs of holding disproportionate amounts of the security, therefore exposing oneself to an idiosyncratic risk of a nondiversified portfolio. The adverse selection component is arguably the one that has been the most studied. Its existence is theoretically well established: the spread will be higher when expected losses from trading with informed traders are larger. For example, Copeland and Galai (1983) and Glosten and Milgrom (1985) show that a spread arises that is independent of any exogenous transaction or inventory cost. Trades with informed investors are on average unprofitable for uninformed traders.  Therefore, uninformed participants have to be compensated to be induced to trade.  \n\nEmpirically, the bid-ask spread has been used as a proxy for information asymmetry. Welker (1995) documents a significant negative relation between AIMR rankings within industries and firms’ bid-ask spreads. The relation is robust to controlling for simultaneity in the determination of disclosure and spreads and to controlling for the effects of return volatility, trading volume and share price (factors that I also control for). Greenstein and Sami (1994), Coller and Yohn (1997), Healy and Wahlen (1999) and Leuz and Verrecchia (2000) provide additional empirical evidence while Bloomfield and Wilks (2000) offer experimental support for this relation.  \n\n#### 1.4.2. The relation between information asymmetry and analyst coverage.  \n\nI also consider analyst coverage. This second proxy is independent from microstructure issues but is related to information asymmetry in two ways. First, there is an exogenous relation between analyst coverage and information asymmetry.  Analysts acquire information otherwise unknown to market participants by interacting with management, visiting plants and so forth. Analysts also process and aggregate complex information in a way that unsophisticated or uninformed investors can understand. Hence, everything else equal, lower analyst coverage is likely to increase information asymmetry.  \n\nSecond, there is an endogenous relation between information asymmetry and coverage. Prior literature has shown that analyst following is positively correlated with disclosure. Although the theoretical prediction is ambiguous ex ante (e.g., there could be a higher demand for analyst coverage when the firm is more opaque), the empirical literature has consistently indicated that the effect of the supply side (i.e., there are fewer analysts when lack of information makes coverage more costly) is more important than that of the demand side. For example, Francis, Hanna and Philbrick (1997) have shown that firms making corporate presentations to analysts enjoy larger analyst coverage. However, they find no improvement in forecast dispersion, accuracy or bias.14 Similarly,  \n\nLang and Lundholm (1996) and Healy and Wahlen (1999) report that firms who expanded voluntary disclosure (proxied by AIMR ratings) benefited from larger analyst coverage. Chang, Dasgupta and Hilary (2006) use the number of analysts following a firm as a summary statistic for information as ymmetry.  \n\nUsing financial analyst coverage as an additional proxy is also useful because it helps to identify who the informed traders are likely to be. If the higher spreads evidenced in Section 3 were due to trades based on information obtained from the unions, analysts would be unlikely to be concerned and would not reduce their coverage. On the other hand, if the higher information asymmetry were due to a reduction in information publicly available, the prior literature discussed above would suggest a reduction in analystcoverage.  \n\n## II Empirical Design  \n\nI regress bid-ask spreads and analyst coverage against a measure of labor strength. The sample period runs from 199315 to 1999. Data are retrieved from the Trade and Quote (TAQ),16 IBES, Compustat and the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) databases. Utilities (SIC code between 49 and 50) and firms from the financial sector (SIC code between 60 and 68) are excluded since they have different disclosure incentives (e.g., Beatty et al. (1995), Ramesh and Revsine (2001)). The sample is restricted to firms listed on the NYSE, AMEX or NASDAQ.17 ADRs or other securities incorporated outside the U.S.A., preferred stocks or securities different from common stocks,18 and “penny stocks” (i.e., firms with a price below $\\$3$ ) are excluded. To reduce the high computational costs of the spread, I follow the analyst literature (e.g., Francis and Philbrick (1993)) and focus on firms with a December fiscal year end. This leads to a sample with 3,204 firms for which information on the main variables (i.e., spreads, analyst coverage and labor data) are available.  \n\n### 3.1 Dependent variable  \n\nBid-ask spread (RAW, PERC): Monthly median bid-ask spreads are first calculated. The median of monthly spreads (PERC when deflated by price, RAW otherwise) is then calculated over the year for each firm. This procedure is designed to capture the “steady state'\" and to mitigate the effects of outliers and special events (e.g., take-over, seasoned equity offering). Callahan et al. (1997) suggest that the bid-ask spread should not be deflated in order to avoid spurious results due to variations in the deflator (price) instead of variations in the numerator (i.e., spread). However, most of the prior literature deflates the spread. Results are essentially unaffected by this design choice and are reported for both specifications.19  \n\nProbability of informed trading (PIN): Aside from directly using the spreads, I also consider a related measure proposed by Easley et al. (1997) and Easley et al. (2002). This proxy measures the prevalence of private information in trades. It is calculated through the estimation of a structural market microstructure model. The main intuition is that abnormal buy or sell volume can be interpreted as information-based trade. The more information-based trade, the more information asymmetry there is. For example, Easley et al. (2002) report that PIN is positively associated spreads, the cost of capital and the variability of returns. I use the values estimated by Easley et al. (2002) and accessible on the authors’ website.20 Note that this measure is mainly available for NYSE-listed stock.  \n\nAnalyst coverage (NbrAnal): NbrAnal is the number of analysts that cover the firm on a yearly basis (as reported in the “Detail File” of IBES). Firms not included in the database are assumed to have zero coverage.21  \n\n### 3.2 Treatment variable  \n\nLabor strength (LSTR): LSTR is calculated as the interaction of labor intensity (LINT) with unionization rate $(R)$ . LSTR is expected to be positively associated with spreads but negatively with trading volume and analyst coverage.  \n\nThe unionization rate $\\left(R\\right)^{22}$ was obtained through a request to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If the labor market is fully competitive, wages are exogenously determined. In this case, there should be no impact from firm specific actions. Thus, unionization is a proxy for the degree of bargaining that affects wages. This rate is calculated at three-digit SIC code.\" Rosen (1969) proposes an analytical model describing the effect of unionization “spill-over'. In essence, spill-overs are an externality caused by the threat of unionization. In other words, the pressure of unions is not limited to their own firms but provides a credible threat for other firms in the same industry. The magnitude of this spill-over effect appears to empirically dominate the direct effect. Bronars and Deere (1994) empirically show “the total negative effects of unionization on profits, after crossfirm or spillover effects are included, are nearly three times as large as the own-firm effects\". They explicitly defined the firms subject to the spill-over effect as the ones in the same industry. In this context, firm specific proxies are likely to underestimate the effect of unions on information asymmetry?4  \n\nThe unionization rate is interacted with labor intensity (LINT) calculated as the number of employees (Compustat item 29) scaled by total assets (Compustat item 6). In other words, I use the ratio of the factors of production (labor to capital).25 If labor represents a very small proportion of the factors of production, it will not significantly affect the manager's decision: if capital represents $99\\%$ of the factors, managers will not be seriously concerned if labor doubles its share of the firm's resources. Although all firms in a similar industry will be subject to a comparable pressure from unions, the impact of the industry-wide pressure will be firm specific.  \n\n### 3.3 Control variables.  \n\nI propose two models of control variables for the spreads. Results from both models are reported and are qualitatively similar. The first one is more parsimonious. It minimizes the risk that the results are spuriously introduced by irrelevant control variables. A second, more extensive model introduces more control variables to minimize the risk of correlated omitted variables. The parsimonious model includes the following controlvariables:  \n\n1) Trading Volume (VOL): The median daily volume is first calculated on a monthly basis for each firm. The median of monthly volumes (VOL) is then calculated over the year for each firm.26 Spreads are expected to be decreasing in volume but analyst coverage should not be affected after controlling for size. Volume itself could be an alternative proxy for information asymmetry. When subject to uncertainty due to the absence of information about future cash-flows, a firm is likely to face high trading volume (e.g., Karpoff (1986)). However, in the presence of informational asymmetry, uninformed participants may not want to trade with potentially informed traders (e.g.. Milgrom and Stokey (1982), Wang (1994)). This prediction is consistent with the limited empirical evidence (e.g., Leuz and Verrecchia (2000)). For completeness, I also investigate volume as a potential dependent variable (but results are not tabulated).  \n\n2) Price (LogPrice): I use the $\\log^{27}$ of price as a control in the spread regressions. Spreads are expected to be decreasing in price but not proportionally. Therefore, LogPrice is expected to be positive in the raw spread regressions but negative in the percentage spread regressions.  \n\n3) Market Dummies (NYSE, AMEX): NYSE is a dummy variable that takes the value of one if the stock is traded on the NYSE market, zero otherwise. AMEX is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if the stock is traded on the AMEX, and zero otherwise. Past research (e.g., Huang and Stoll (1996) and Bessembinder and Kaufman (1997)) suggest that firms traded on the NASDAQ are associated with a higher bid-ask spread. Huang and Stoll (1996) report that higher spreads are not due to differences in adverse information, but rather in micro-structure. Therefore, the NYSE and AMEX variables can be seen as controls for cross-sectional variations of the order-processing component of the bid-ask spread.  \n\n4) Size: Following prior literature (e.g., Scott (1994), Size is the log of sales (Compustat item 12). Past literature has shown a negative link between size and the bidask spread and a positive relation between size and volume or between size and analyst coverage.  \n\nThe extended model includes the following additional variables:  \n\n5) Sensitivity to cost of capital: All managers are expected to minimize their cost of capital. However, the importance of this goal may vary cross-sectionally. I expect firms with higher sensitivity to the cost of capital to experience lower information asymmetry.  \n\n5.1)  Personal  managerial  incentives $(S h r P c)$ : A  disclosure  policy  may be influenced by a manager's personal incentives. For example, if the manager owns a significant share of the equity of the firm, she may have a greater incentive to reduce the spread or the cost of capital. To control for this possibility, I include in the regression the percentage of equity held by insiders (the dollar amount of holdings by all executives of the firm as reported in Compustat divided by the market capitalization at the end of the period).  \n\n5.2) Seasoned equity offering (SEO): A firm that issues equity may have an incentive to increase disclosure in order to reduce adverse selection (Lang and Lundholm (1993, 1997)). To control for this possible effect, I include a dummy variable that takes the value of one if the firm issues equity in the U.S. during the year, zero otherwise. Data are retrieved from the SDC database.  \n\n6) Industry Dummies: To control for possible industry-specific effects unrelated to labor issues, I include a dummy for all but one industry (defined by two-digit SIC codes) in both the extended spread model and the analyst regressions. Results for these variables are not tabulated. This additional set of control variables is quite taxing on the data, considering that the unionization rate is calculated at the (three-digit) industry level.  \n\n7) Risk and Growth Opportunities: Risk affects the inventory component of the bid-ask spread. Therefore, I use the following four variables as controls of risk. Risk is expected to be positively associated with spreads.  \n\n7.1) Price Volatility (StPrice): StPrice is the standard deviation of the daily price calculated for each firm each year.28 The data is retrieved from CRSP. Volatility is expected to be associated with higher bid-ask spreads (e.g., Stoll (1978)). In particular, it should control for the idiosyncratic risk of the security that increases the inventory component of the bid-ask spread.  \n\n7.2) Sales volatility (StSales): StSales is the standard deviation of the yearly sales calculated for each firm over the period 1991 to 2000. This variable proxies for operational risk.29  \n\n7.3) Book-to-Market ratio (BM): BM is the log of the ratio of book equity to market value.30 Firms with low book-to-market ratios have been shown to be more risky (e.g., Fama and French (1993)). An alternative interpretation for BM is a control for the growth option/ investment opportunity set. To further control for the growth option, I also include the ratio of earnings divided by price (the E/P ratio) and a dummy variable that takes the value of one if the firm's title contains “.com\" or “.net'\". Results (not reported) still hold.  \n\n7.4) Leverage (Debt): I use the ratio of debt (Compustat items 9, 34 and 130) divided by equity (items 60, 35 and 71) as an additional measure of risk.  \n\n8) Proxies for the level of outside monitoring in the environment of the firm. Monitoring by a rating agency is expected to decrease the information asymmetry. I create Rating, a dummy variable that takes the value of one if there is a bond rating by Standard & Poor's in the Compustat database, zero otherwise.31  \n\n9) Profitability: Jovanovic (1982) suggests higher quality sellers may be more forthcoming with information. In the absence of labor issues, more profitable firms may disclose more information. I control for this possible effect by introducing the variables below. On the other hand, managers facing strong labor may want to reduce the disclosure when the firms are more profitable. In an untabulated robustness check, I also use an interaction with LSTR.  \n\n9.1) Profitability (MeanRet, ROA): I use two proxies for profitability. MeanRet is the arithmetic mean of the daily returns (calculated for the year). ROA is the return on asset calculated by dividing earnings before extraordinary items (Compustat item 18) by total assets (item 6).32  \n\n9.2) Expectations (Expect): The manager may be more forthcoming if she has good news about future cash-flows. I proxy for the manager's expectations by calculating the growth of sales in the following year.  \n\n9.3) Concentration (Herf):  Industry concentration is  measured using  the Herfindahl index. Harris (1998) shows empirically that higher industry concentration is associated with lower disclosure of segment information. This would suggest a positive link between concentration and information asymmetry.33  \n\n10) Proxy for the complexity of the firm: A more complex firm is expected to be associated with higher information asymmetry. Industries with strong organized labor do not appear to be particularly complex. They largely belong to basic goods industries or to low-technology service industries (see Table 1, Panel B). Nevertheless, I include NbrSeg, the number of industrial segments as reported in Compustat.34  \n\n## IV Empirical results.  \n\nTable 1 provides the unionization rate by industry and year. It ranges from less than $2\\%$ in agricultural industry to over $40\\%$ in the automobile industry. Unionization is generally low in the service industry.35 Table 2 provides summary statistics. Panel A reports summary statistics for $R$ , LINT and LSTR. The average unionization rate in the sample is close to $14\\%$ and has both cross-sectional and time series variation. For example, I calculate the mean and the standard deviation of $R$ by industry. I then take the ratio of the standard deviation divided by the industry mean of $R$ . The overall sample of these ratios is $12\\%$ . In other words, the average standard deviation over time in a given industry  is  greater  than $10\\%$ of its mean. A similar procedure on cross-sectional variations gives an overall sample mean of $75\\%$ , indicating a high level of cross-sectional variation. A regression of LINT on industry dummies has a coefficient of determination of $5\\%$ , suggesting LINT is largely a firm specific variable (as intended). Panel B reviews industries where labor is the strongest. Not surprisingly, low-technology service industries and basic goods sectors are largely represented. These sectors do not appear to be intrinsically more risky or difficult to evaluate. Panel C indicate that although the percentage spread might be small for larger firms, the spread represents $2.6\\%$ of the stock price on average ( $3.5\\%$ for firms whose sales are below the median sales, untabulated results).  \n\nTable 3 offers a correlation table. Results show labor strength is positively correlated with spreads (deflated or not) but negatively correlated with trading volume and analyst coverage. At the time, the correlation between LSTR and different measures of risk such as the variance of price or sale is negative (although only the first correlation is significant and tabulated). The correlation with Debt is essentially zero (not tabulated). Although univariate correlations are hardly conclusive, this suggests the association between spreads and LSTR is not due to a higher risk.  \n\n### 4.1 Bid-ask spread and other trade-based proxies.  \n\nThe results for the bid-ask spreads are presented in Table 4.  All models (including the unreported parsimonious one using deflated spreads) are qualitatively similar. They indicate a positive and significant relation between labor strength and bidask spreads. The effect on spreads is such that a deviation from one standard deviation  \n\n36 leads to an increase of about $15\\%$ of the median spread.\" This effect is incremental to other potential sources of higher spreads (such as lower profitability, higher risk and so forth) that may be affected by labor but are controlled for in the regressions. LINT is negative but the significance varies across models while the effect of $R$ differs across specifications.37  \n\nThe standard errors in the OLS specifications (columns 1 to 3 and unreported parsimonious model with PERC) are robust and allow for clustering of observations by year. The corrected t-statistics for LSTR range from 4.15 to 5.86 in the four different OLS models. Results (not tabulated) still hold when standard errors allow for clustering by industry instead of by year. When LSTR is logged, the t-statistics range from 8.29 to 13.03.38 The results (not tabulated) are also stronger when I exclude outliers (defined as observations where PERC, RA W or LSTR lie in the top or bottom $1\\%$ of the distribution) or when I use a median regression.39 Additionally, the results hold when the standard errors are corrected by simultaneously using the Rogers (1983, 1993) and the NeweyWest (1987) (one lag) corrections to adjust for unspecified cross-correlation,40 heteroskedasticity and serial correlation. Results (not tabulated) still hold when a time trend as an additional control variable. I also consider a panel setting, yearly regressions (Fama-McBeth (1973)) and industry average estimations. In this last one, I average all variables by 3 digit SIC-code to match the categories used by the BLS to calculate the unionization rate. Results hold in all three when LSTR is logged. To address a potential endogeneity problem between spreads and analyst coverage, I also consider a Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) procedure. I use NbrSeg, and Service as instruments for NbrAnal. The2SLS $\\mathbf{Z}$ -statistics for LSTR are 4.74 (deflated, not tabulated) and 4.96 (raw, Table 3,  \n\nColumn 5). The first-stage F-statistic is equal to $61.25^{41}$ and a Hansen J test fails to reject the orthogonality condition (chi-square p-values are 0.61 and 0.16), suggesting that the instruments are adequate. I also use count-data techniques (both Poisson and Negative binomial) to take into account raw spreads are discrete and bounded at zero. The coefficient (not tabulated) on LSTR doubles (to approximately 4.1) and the t-statistic becomes to 4.33 (allowing for robust standard errors and clustering of observations by year). In other words, the higher information asymmetry is not simply due to a lower analyst coverage.  \n\nIn addition, the results (not tabulated) hold when the regressions are run either with firms listed only on NYSE or on the NASDAQ, suggesting that the results are not driven by micro-structure factors.42 To further investigate whether the results are caused by the inventory component of the spread, I regress both price and return volatility on LSTR and the control variables of the extended model. Results (not tabulated) indicate that both volatilities are negatively associated with labor strength (although the significance of this result varies across specifications).43 This would suggest the inventory costs would be lower for those firms and, therefore, do not drive the spread results.44  \n\nThe coefficients on the control variables generally have the expected signs. NASDAQ and smaller firms have larger spreads. 45 As expected, LogPrice is positive in the undeflated specifications and negative in the deflated ones. The four measures of risk are positively correlated with higher spreads and are generally significant. The effect of outside monitoring is ambiguous. Consistent with the idea of firms disclosing more good than bad news, future sales growth is associated with smaller spreads. However, contemporaneous returns do not seem to affect the spreads (at least when BM is included in the regression).46 ROA is positive, perhaps because of a correlation between ROA and intangible assets or industry maturity. Spreads are smaller when managers are more sensitive to the cost of equity, either because they personally own more of the firm (although the coefficient is only significant in the deflated specifications), or because they plan a SEO. This result is consistent with managers disclosing more information to reduce the adverse selection problem in these cases. As expected, higher volumes are associated with smaller spreads.  \n\nWhen LSTR is interacted with measure of the current or future economic situation (ROA and Expect) in the extended model, LSTR remains significant. The interaction between Expect and LSTR is never significant while the interaction with ROA is negatively significant in the PERC regression but insignificant in the RAW one. This suggests the disclosure policy is not affected by the current or expected state-of-the-world but rather is determined by the long-term value of the parameters.  \n\nFinally, I consider two additional measures of information asymmetry as dependent variables: PIN and trading volume. In the PIN regression, LSTR is consistently positive in all the specifications similar to the ones used with RAW and PERC. For example, Column 4 of Table 4 indicates that the corrected t-statistic is 5.35 in the extended model (7.14 in the parsimonious model, untabulated). The economic magnitude is such that increasing LSTR by one standard deviation increases PIN by approximately $5\\%$ of the median PIN. In other words, increasing labor strength reduces the likelihood that trades are carried out for liquidity purpose and increases the likelihood they are based on private information. When I use the log of the trading volume as a dependent variable, LSTR is negative in all specifications (with t-statistics between -4.37 and -25.35 depending on the specification). The economic magnitude is such that increasing LSTR by one standard deviation decreases trading volume by approximately $6\\%$ of the average trading volume. This results is consistent with the “no trade theorem' (see Milgrom and Stokey (1982)) that suggests trade will be reduced in the presence of higher information asymmetry.  \n\nTo summarize, empirical results show a positive relation between labor strength and spreads. Spreads are composed of three components. Different tests rule out the possibility this relation is due to micro-structure factors or to higher inventory costs (idiosyncratic risk). This indicates the empirical relation is due to the last component, information asymmetry. The asymmetry is the difference between what is known by the most informed traders but not disclosed to uninformed traders. This relation is robust to control for growth option, risk, managerial incentives and numerous other factors, including firm and industry fixed effects. In other words, the relation is not due to a greater intrinsic uncertainty about the corporation performance. This interpretation is reinforced by a positive relation of labor strength with the probability of informed trading (PIN) and a negative one with volume.  \n\n### 4.2 Analyst coverage  \n\nThe results from the analyst coverage regressions are presented in Table 5. 1 present results using OLS specification (column 1) and a count-data (negative binomial) technique (e.g., Rock, Sedo and Willenborg (2000), column 2). The standard errors are robust and allow for clustering of observations by year but results are qualitatively similar when observations are clustered by industry (results not tabulated). They are also robust to the use of a panel specification (random effects). Column 3 reports results of the 2SLS procedure where LogPrice and ROA are used as instruments. The standard errors are estimated through a robust GMM procedure. The first-stage F-statistic in the 2SLS is equal to 200 and a Hansen J test fails to reject the orthogonality condition, suggesting that the instruments are adequate.47 Finally, I perform a two-step procedure. In a first step, I estimate the predicted value of the spreads using LogPrice and ROA as instruments. In the second step, I use a negative binomial regression to estimate the effect of LSTR on analyst coverage. I boot-strap the system 100 times to obtain consistent standard errors in the second step. This procedure is analogous to the usual 2SLS but uses a count-data technique in the second step instead of the standard OLS. Average coefficients and $95\\%$ confidence intervals are reported in brackets in column 4 of Table 5.  \n\nAll models indicate a significantly negative relation between labor strength and analyst coverage. The t-statistics for LSTR are respectively -5.43, -4.16 and -6.40 in columns 1 to $3.R$ and Lint are positive and usually significant. Both the statistical and the economic significance of the results (not tabulated) typically increases when I log LSTR or I use the log of the number of analysts (plus one since the log of zero would not be defined if the firm is not covered at all) as the dependent variable. Substituting PERC for RA W gives qualitatively similar results (not tabulated). The variable is also significant at less than $1\\%$ level in column 4 of Table 5. Results (not reported) still hold in the four specifications at a confidence level of less than the $1\\%$ when the only control variables are size and the spread (deflated or not), suggesting that the results are not driven by the introduction of irrelevant variables. The effect on analyst coverage is such that an increase by one standard deviation of LSTR would lead to a decrease of approximately $18\\%$ of the median coverage. The economic magnitude materially increases when LSTR is logged.48 Analyst coverage is increasing in size, price volatility, future economic prospects, issuance of security and outside bond rating but decreasing in complexity (number of segments), market concentration and spreads. These results are generally consistent with prior literature.  \n\nTo summarize, empirical results establish a negative link between labor strength and analyst coverage. Analyst coverage has been used by prior literature as a direct summary measure for information asymmetry. This result is consistent with the result found in section 4.1 and reinforces its interpretation based on an informational explanation.  \n\n## V Conclusion and Extension  \n\nThis study examines whether the existence of strong organized labor is associated with  higher information asymmetry between informed  and uninformed  market participants. Prior literature suggests that reducing information asymmetry weakens management's position in collective bargaining. A possible theoretical explanation is that strong labor increases the ambiguity concerning managerial objectives. This ambiguity gives management a valuable option to credibly manipulate expectations and in turn an incentive to protect its information asymmetry to preserve this option. The empirical results are generally consistent with this hypothesis and show a positive relation between labor strength and spreads and the probability of informed trading as well as a negative one between labor strength and both trading volume and analyst coverage.  \n\n#  \n\nDionograpny Aboody, David, and Ronald Kasznik, “CEO Stock Option Awards and the Timing of Corporate Voluntary Disclosures\", Journal of Accounting & Economics, Volume 29, Issue 1, Feb. 2000, pp. 73-100.
