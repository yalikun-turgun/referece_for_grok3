Gompers  \n\nHartard Business School,Harvard Unicersity,Boston,MA 02163,USA  \n\n(Received August 1993; final version received February 1996)  \n\n## Abstract  \n\nI develop and test the hypothesis that young venture capital firms take companies pubic carlier than older venture capital firms in order to establish a reputation and successfully raise capital for new funds. Evidence from a sample of 433 IPOs suggests that companies backed by young venture capital firms are younger and more underpriced at their IPO than those of established venture capital firms. Moreover, young venture capital firms have been on the board of directors a shorter period of time at the IPO, hold smaller equity stakes, and time the IPO to precede or coincide with raising money for follow-onfunds.  \n\nKey words: Venture capital; Initial public offerings: Reputation JEL classification: G2; G3  \n\n### 1. Introduction  \n\nReputation and its effect on attracting capital are important topics in recent corporate finance research. Theoretical work by Diamond (1989) shows that reputation can be important in accessing debt and equity markets. Empirical research by Sirri and Tufano (1993) and Chevalier and Ellison (1995) demonstrates that past performance is a strong indicator of the ability to attract investors. This study analyzes venture capital organizations to provide new evidence about the relation between performance and capital raising and its implications for fund managers' incentives. I argue that young venture capital firms have incentives to grandstand, i.e., they take actions that signal their ability to potential investors.' Specifically, young venture capital frms bring companies public earlier than older venture capital firms in an effort to establish a reputation and successfully raise capital for new funds.  \n\nThe importance and size of the venture capital industry have increased dramatically since 1978 when 211 venture capital firms invested $\\$218$ million of new capital and managed a capital pool of $\\$2.5$ billion. By 1988, 658 venture capital firms invested $\\$4.2$ billion and managed an aggregate capital pool of $\\$31$ billion (Venture Economics, 1988). Barry, Muscarella, Peavy, and Vetsuypens (1990), Megginson and Weiss (1991), and Lerner (1994) document the important role that venture capitalists play in bringing companies public.  \n\nThe venture capital industry is particularly well suited for examining reputation and capital raising because most venture capital organizations raise money in limited partnerships. These partnerships have finite lifetimes, so that a venture firm must periodically completely recapitalize itself by raising a new limited partnership. A venture capital organization would cease operations without raising a new fund. This puts pressure on young venture capital firms to establish a reputation and raise a new fund within a short, predetermined time.  \n\nEmpirical tests for a sample of 433 venture-backed initial public offerings (IPOs) from January 1, 1978 through December 31, 1987 and a second sample consisting of the first IPO brought to market by 62 venture capital funds support predictions of the grandstanding hypothesis. For example, the effect of recent performance in the IPO market on the amount of capital raised is stronger for young venture capital firms, providing them with greater incentive to bring companies public earlier. Similarly, young venture capital firms raise new funds closer to the IPO. Young venture capital firms have been on the IPO company's board of directors 14 months less than older venture firms, hold smaller percentage equity stakes at the time of IPO than the stakes held by established venture firms, and the IPO companies they finance are nearly two years younger and more underpriced when they go public than companies backed by older venture capital firms. Much of the difference in underpricing and the venture capitalists percentage equity stake is associated with a shorter duration of board representation, indicating that rushing companies to the IPO market imposes costs on the venture firm. The results suggest that the relation between performance and capital raising affects the incentives and actions of venture capitalists.  \n\n### 2. Incentives to grandstand  \n\nGompers and Lerner (1995a) show that over $80\\%$ of venture capital funds are organized as limited partnerships with predefined lifetimes, usually ten years with an option to extend the fund for up to three years. Venture capitalists must therefore liquidate investments and distribute proceeds to investors within that time. Consequently, no new investments are made after the first four or five years of a fund. The predetermined lifetime of a particular fund means that venture capital firms must periodically raise follow-on partnerships to remain active in venture capital financing. Venture capital firms may have two or three overlapping funds each starting three to six years after the previous fund.  \n\nGompers and Lerner (1995a) also find that most limited partners in venture capital funds are institutional investors whose role in the day-to-day operations of the fund is restricted by law if they are to retain limited liability. Limited partners receive periodic updates about the status of projects and new investment activity within the portfolio managed by the venture capitalist, but they do not participate in policy decisions. Evaluating a venture capitalist's ability is therefore diffcult. Investors thus search for signals of ability when evaluating venturecapitalists.  \n\nTheoretical and empirical research on other types of investment funds demonstrate the importance of reputation and fund performance in raising capital. Lakonishok, Shleifer, Thaler, and Vishny (1991), Patel, Zeckhauser, and Hendricks (1991), and Sirri and Tufano (1993) examine fundraising and investment patterns of various types of institutional fund managers and find that past performance infuences fundraising ability. Stein (1988, 1989) and Rajan (1993) develop models in which investors horizons lead to managerial decisions that do not maximize shareholder value. Incentives to boost performance in the short run lead to activities that lower firm value. Chevalier and Ellison (1995) show that the relative performance of mutual fund managers affects growth in capital contributions to their funds. Funds that underperform the market in the first nine months of a year have an incentive to increase the riskiness of their portfolio. This incentive is particularly strong for new mutual funds.  \n\nA formal model of grandstanding is developed in Gompers (1993) and demonstrates that new venture capital firms are willing to incur costs by taking companies public earlier than would maximize the return on those individual companies and earlier than would an established venture capital firm. I assume that venture capitalists have different abilities to select or create companies that have a high probability of going public. The most effective way of signaling ability or the value of portfolio companies might therefore be to bring one of the portfolio companies public in an IPO.^ Sahlman (1990) documents that almost all of the returns for investors in venture capital are earned on companies that eventuallygo public.  \n\nIf investors believe that high-ability venture capitalists are more likely to fund companies that eventually go public, then taking a portfolio company public would be interpreted as a sign that the venture capitalist is skilled at financing start-up companies. After an IPO, investors increase their assessment of the venture capitalist's ability. Because investors know more about older venture capital firms, an additional IPO will not affect their beliefs about an old firm's ability as much as it would their beliefs about a young venture firm's ability.  \n\nIf the amount of capital that venture capitalists can raise is an increasing function of their perceived ability, and the costs of earlier IPOs (e.g., greater underpricing or smaller equity stakes) are not trivial, then only young venture capital firms are willing to incur those costs. Old venture capital firms with good reputations do not need to signal, because investors have evaluated their performance over many years and believe in their high ability. Only new venture capital firms will benefit from signaling in the IPO market. Firms that are believed to be of low quality (through their inability to bring companies public) are unable to raise new funds. Diamond (1989) shows how reputation can similarly affect the debt market. In his model, young borrowers choose risky projects. If they survive for a certain length of time and acquire reputations as reliable borrowers, their investment behavior changes and they choose safe projects. Age becomes a proxy for reputation. Reputation can work in a similar way in the venture capital industry.  \n\nThe grandstanding hypothesis predicts that the relation between bringing companies public and fundraising ability should be stronger for young venture capital firms. Each additional IPO attracts relatively more capital from investors for a young venture capital firm than for an old venture capital firm. An additional IPO changes investors' estimates of a young venture capitalist's ability more than it does their estimate of an old venture capitalist's ability. Therefore, if we compare the fundraising activity of venture capital firms, each additional IPO for a young venture capital firm attracts significantly more capital than each additional IPO for an older venture capital firm. Because the reputation of established venture capital firms is affected less by doing an IPO, the incentive to raise new funds immediately following an IPO should be smaller. If we compare the average time from an IPO to the closing of the venture capital firm's next fund, young venture firms will raise money sooner than older venture firms.  \n\nThe relation between reputation and capital raising is consistent with industry wisdom. Established venture capital firms with long track records raise large funds quickly and with little effort. When Greylock Management Company, one of the nation's oldest and most prestigious firms, began their eighth venture fund early in 1994, they collected more than \\$175 million in only a few months (\\$ 150 million had originally been targeted). All of the investors in Greylock's new fund were previous Greylock investors.  \n\nVenture capital firms in their first fund who have shown no returns find it dificult to raise new money. These firms may have strong incentives to grandstand. For example, Hummer-Winblad formed its first venture capital fund in 1989. When Hummer-Winblad tried to raise a second fund in 1992, they found it extremely difficult to attract investors despite nearly a half-year of marketing. This lack of interest stemmed largely from the lack of successes; Hummer-Winblad had never taken a firm public. After Powersoft, one of their investments, went public on February 3, 1993, Hummer- Winblad raised a $\\$60$ million second fund in a few months.  \n\nAn additional prediction of the grandstanding hypothesis is that companies brought to market by young venture capital firms should be less mature. I examine two measures of IPO maturity. The age of the offering company at the time of issue is one measure of an early IPO. If new venture capital firms grandstand, companies they back will be younger at the offering date than companies backed by older venture firms. Similarly, if young venture capital firms rush companies to market (compared to older venture capital firms), they will have shorter relationships and will have served on the boards of IPO companies for a shorter length of time.  \n\nOne cost incurred by new venture capital firms doing early IPOs is greater underpricing. Muscarella and Vetsuypens (1989) show that the older the firm at IPO (controlling for various factors), the lower the underpricing. As in Rock's (1986) IPO model, older firms have longer track records, reducing asymmetric information and underpricing. Models of 1PO underpricing (Welch, 1989; Grinblatt and Hwang, 1989; Allen and Faulhaber, 1989) view underpricing as a costly signal of a company's quality. The greater the uncertainty surrounding a company, the greater the underpricing. A company that goes to market earlier is younger and has less information available for evaluation by potential investors and so is underpriced to a greater degree. Underpricing is a real loss for the venture capital firm because it transfers wealth from existing shareholders (including the venture capitalist) to new shareholders. Companies brought to market by young venture capital firms should therefore be more underpriced at the IPO.  \n\nAdditional costs occur when bringing a company to market early reduces prospects for future growth. The venture capitalist may bear much of the cost of taking companies public early by receiving a smaller equity stake. A comparison of the equity stakes of young and old venture capital firms should reveal that venture capitalists investing in a company with a young lead venture capital firm should hold a smaller percentage of the offering company's equity at the IPO date.  \n\nThe grandstanding hypothesis predicts that young venture capital firms incur the costs of signaling because the company goes public earlier than if it had been financed by a more established venture capitalist. When the costs associated with an IPO are examined in regressions, the age of the IPO company and the length of the venture capitalist's board service should explain some of the difference in underpricing and percentage equity stakes at IPO between young and established venture capital providers. It is not the presence of a young venture backer that increases underpricing and reduces equity stakes but rather the early timing of the IPO. The age of the offering company and the length of board service should be negatively related to underpricing and positively related to the size of the venture capitalist's equity stake.  \n\n### 3. Empirical results  \n\n#### 3.1. Data set and descriptive statistics  \n\nTwo samples are used to test the predictions of the grandstanding hypothesis. The first sample, collected and described by Barry, Muscarella, Peavy, and Vetsuypens (1990), consists of 433 venture-backed IPOs taken public between January 1, 1978 and December 31, 1987. Kemper Financial Services and Brinson Partners, two investment advisors, supplied a second data set that includes all IPOs for 62 venture capital funds between August 1, 1983 and July 31, 1993. This data set is useful for addressing potential selection biases in the first sample. IPO prospectuses are from Harvard Business School's SEC document collection.  \n\nBarry et al. identify their sample using the Venture Capital Journal, which regularly publishes information on such IPOs. The sample of 433 excludes any IPOs for which a venture capital investor could not be identified, reverse LBOs, and IPOs for which the offering prospectus was unavailable. For the age of the venture capital firm and the offering company at IPO, I searched the Lexis/Nexis's COMPNY database for incorporation and partnership flings. I also use Ritter's (1991) IPO dataset to cross-check incorporation dates, offering size, and underpricing. For age at IPO, 1 always use the earliest incorporation date. Dates and sizes of new funds are from Venture Economics, a consulting frm that tracks investments and fundraising by venture capital firms.  \n\nVenture capitalists most often syndicate their investments with other venture capitalists. When this occurs, one investor usually takes the role of lead venture capitalist. This investor ordinarily has significant control over the decisions of the firm and more actively monitors the company through board service. I classify the firm that has been on the board the longest as the lead venture capitalist; this classification differs from that of Barry et al. (1990), who classify the lead venture capitalist as the firm that owns the largest equity stake and has a board seat. If two firms have been on the board the same length of time, I designate the larger equity holder as the lead. Gorman and Sahlman (1989) find that the venture capital firm originating the investment is usually the firm that acquires a board seat first and has the most input into the decisions of the offering company. The originating firm does not always end up owning the largest stake at IPO.  \n\nTo test the grandstanding hypothesis, I divide the sample of venture-backed companies into two groups: those backed by experienced venture capital firms and those backed by young venture capital firms. The age of the lead venture capital firm at IPO serves as a proxy for reputation, although it is an imperfect measure of reputation because experienced partners sometimes leave to start new venture capital firms, which effect would tend to bias the results away from seeing any difference between new and old venture capital frms. I classify all lead venture capital firms that are under six years old at the IPO date as young and those that are six years old or more as old. The results are not sensitive to cutoffs between four and ten years.3  \n\nTable 1 presents summary information for the IPOs backed by young and old venture capital firms. Younger venture capital firms bring companies public closer to the firms' next fund, an average (median) of 16 months (12) prior to the next fund for young venture capital firms and 24 (24) months prior for old venture capital firms. The Venture Economics Funds database shows that experienced venture capital firms raise new funds every two to four years while young venture capital firms raise new money only every five or six years. If IPOs occur randomly, the average IPO for an old venture capital firm should be closer to its next fund than the average IPO for a new venture capital firm. Because it takes approximately one year to solicit money and close a new fund, the eight-to-twelve-month difference implies that young venture capital firms could be bringing companies public in the period immediately preceding or during the time they are raising money while established firms are not. The average size of a new venture capital firm's next fund (S77.5 million) is also smaller than the size of an old venture firm's next fund (\\$120.4 million).  \n\nTable1 Comparison of the characteristics for initial public offerings backed by young and old venture capitalfirms   \nSample is 433 venture-backed companies that went public between January 1, 1978 and December 31, 1987.

The average (median) age of the offering company is 56 (42) months for IPOs backed by young venture capitalists and 80 (64) months for IPOs backed by old venture capitalists. Similarly, young venture capital firms sit on the board of directors for a shorter period of time with an average (median) 25 (20) months for young venture firms versus 39 (28) months for established venture firms.  \n\nTable 1 also shows that unseasoned venture capital firms bring to market IPOs that are more underpriced. The average (median) underpricing at the IPO date is $13.6\\%$ $(6.7\\%)$ for IPOs brought to market by young venture capital firms versus $7.3\\%$ $(2.7\\%)$ for older venture capital firms. The average offering size is also significantly smaller for IPOs brought to market by young venture capital firms and old venture capital firms tend to use higher-quality underwriters (the established venture capital firms may have contacts with more reputable underwriters through previous IPOs or other business dealings). As expected, on average old venture capital firms have financed more companies that have gone public (6.0) than have unseasoned venture capital firms (1.0).  \n\nThe summary statistics in Table 1 show that venture capitalists receive a significantly smaller share of the equity in companies that go public when the lead venture capital firm is under six years old. The average (median) equity stake of all venture capital investors is $32.1\\%$ $(28.7\\%)$ of the equity prior to the IPO when the lead venture capital firm is under six years old compared to $37.7\\%$ $(37.1\\%)$ when the lead venture capital firm is older.  \n\nThe market value of the lead venture capitalist's equity stake is also significantly lower for new venture capital organizations. IPO prospectuses indicate the number of shares sold in the IPO and the number of shares held after IPO by the lead venture capitalist. In calculating the market value of shares sold, I assume that the venture capitalist receives the IPO offering price for all shares sold in the IPO. Shares held after IPO are valued at the first price listed on the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) data tapes. The first price listed on CRSP is usually (but not always) on the IPO date, but it is never more than several days from the listed IPO date. Table 1 shows that the average (median) market value of a young lead venture capital firm's equity stake is $\\$8.4$ (\\$3.8) million while the market value of an established lead venture capital firm's equity stake is \\$ 12.9 (\\$ 7.7) million. These summary statistics are consistent with the grandstanding hypothesis. Young venture capital firms bring companies public early and bear real costs through greater underpricing and lower-valued equity stakes, although the company going public also bears some of the cost.  \n\nAn alternative explanation for the differences in firm age and board service is a selection bias caused by classifying young venture capital firms as all firms that are under six years old. The age of the venture capital firm might be correlated with the age of the IPO company without a causal relationship. By definition, no young venture capital firm will have been on the board of the IPO company for more than 71 months. This would cause companies brought to market by young venture capital firms to have shorter venture capitalist board representation on average even though the IPO process was the same for young and old venture capital firms.  \n\nThis potential selection bias should not be important because the length of time that the typical investment is held from first funding to IPO is significantly less than 71 months. Gompers (1995a) shows that the average (median) time from first-round venture financing to IPO date for a sample of 127 venturebacked IPOs is 34 (31) months. While the date of initial funding is unknown for my sample, in virtually all cases of first-round financing the venture capital firm receives a seat on the board of directors.4 Old venture capital firms are on the board for an average (median) of 39 (28) months while new venture capital firms are on the board 25 (20) months.  \n\nTo determine the extent of the selection bias, I use the second set of IPOs provided by Kemper Financial Services and Brinson Partners for the period August 1, 1983 to July 31, 1993. The sample consists of 19 venture capital firms in their first fund and 43 venture capital firms in their second fund or later. Funds that had not performed an IPO prior to July 1993 are excluded. From the complete fund histories, I identify the first IPO brought to market by each fund. I compare the characteristics of the first IPO for first-fund venture capital firms to the first IPO of second-or-later-fund venture capital firms. Because a successful venture fund may have only two or three IPOs, the first IPO is a strong signal of ability to take companies public. Comparing first IPOs for various funds eliminates any selection bias but sacrifices sample size.  \n\nTable 2 presents summary statistics for the 62 IPOs. The results support conclusions from the larger sample and are consistent with the grandstanding hypothesis. First IPOs for first-fund venture capital firms are significantly younger (32 vs. 54 months) and more underpriced ( $18.5\\%$ Vs. $7.8\\%$ )than first IPOs for second-or-later-fund venture capital firms. First-fund venture capital firms have also been on the board for a shorter period of time and they raise money significantly sooner following the IPO (13 vs. 29 months). Neither the offering size nor average underwriter rank differs significantly. Average aftermarket standard deviation, however, is higher for the first-fund sample. Selection biases do not appear to drive the results.  \n\nTable2 Comparison of the characteristics for initial public offerings backed by young and old venture capitalfirms   \nSample is the first IPO for cach of 62 venture capital funds for two institutional investors from August 1, 1983 through July 31, 1993.

Size of next fund and time to next fund  \n\nResults from regressions for the size of the lead venture capitalist's next fund and the length of time from IPO to the firm's next fund are presented in Table 3. The dependent variable in the first set of regressions is the logarithm of the amount of capital raised in the lead venture capitalist's next fund in constant 1992 dollars. The grandstanding hypothesis predicts that the amount of capital a venture firm can raise should be positively related to the number of companies the firm has taken public. Capital raising should also be more sensitive to IPOs for young venture capital firms.  \n\nTable 3 shows that the number of companies that the lead venture capitalist has taken public is positively related to the amount of capital raised. In the first regression, the coefficient of 0.039 means that each additional IPO translates into roughly \\$8 million dollars more capital committed to the firm's next fund. I find that underwriter rank for the most recent IPO is also positively related to the amount of capital raised. Higher-quality underwriters tend to take larger, more promising companies public. If underwriter rank is related to the quality of the IPO company, then the relation between rank and capital raised should be positive. Taking higher-quality firms public is a stronger signal of ability. Industry reports and fund offering memoranda touting recent IPO successes clearly indicate that venture capitalists understand this relation.  \n\nThe second regression includes interaction terms between the young venture capital firm dummy variable, the number of IPOs brought to market, and underwriter rank. The significantly positive coefficients on both interaction terms show that the amount of capital raised by young venture capital firms is more sensitive to both the number of IPOs they have financed and the underwriter rank of the most recent IPO, consistent with the predictions of the grandstanding hypothesis. Because older venture capital firms have established reputations, beliefs about their ability are not very sensitive to an additional IPO or the quality of the underwriter for that IPO. New venture capital firms have considerably more to gain (in terms of reputation and fundraising ability) by doing an IPO. The limited lifetime of venture funds and the strong relation between recent IPO performance and fundraising provide powerful incentives for young venture capital firms to bring companies to market earlier than older venture firms. The third and fourth regressions in Table 3 show that the results are robust to using the logarithm of age specification for venture capital firm reputation.  \n\nThe second set of regressions in Table 3 indicates that new venture capital firms raise money for follow-on funds significantly sooner after the date of the IPO (between five and nine months sooner) despite the fact that the older venture capital firms started more funds during the time period. The results also indicate that larger venture capital firms wait longer to raise a new fund. Firms with more capital have less incentive to grandstand because they have more money in reserve for future investment opportunities. While five to nine months may not seem like a large difference between young and established venture firms, the evidence is consistent with the existence of reputational concerns and the predictions of the grandstanding hypothesis. Reputation affects fundraising in the venture capital market.  \n\n#### 3.2.2. Length of board service and age at IPO  \n\nThe regressions in Table 3 indicate that the sensitivity of fundraising to recent IPO performance is stronger for young venture capital firms than it is for older ones. This relation provides an incentive for young firms to rush companies to the IPO market. Table 4 examines the effects of venture capital firm reputation on two measures of IPO timing. The first is the length of time that the lead venture capital firm has served on the board of directors. If young venture capital firms take companies public earlier, they will have served on the board of directors for a shorter length of time. The second measure of early IPOs is age of the issuing company. The first two regressions indicate that young venture capital firms (those under six years old) have served on the board of directors between 12 and 14 months less than established venture capital firms. Similarly, companies backed by a new venture capital firm are between 26 and 28 months younger than companies backed by more established venture capital firms. These results are consistent with the grandstanding hypothesis that companies backed by young venture capital firms go public sooner, controlling for other factors.  \n\nTable 4 aiso presents results from the sample of first IPOs for the 62 funds to examine potential selection biases. The results show that first-fund venture capitalists have been on the board of their first IPO 13 to 14 months less than second-or-later-fund venture capitalists. The first company brought public by a new fund is 19 to 20 months younger on average than the fist IPO of a second-or-later-fund venture firm. These results are nearly identical to the results for the entire sample, indicating that selection bias is not a problem.  \n\nThe differences in board service (14 months) and IPO firm age (28 months) are important. They represent a $30\\%$ difference in firm age and board service between the new venture capital firm sample and the old venture capital firm sample. Moreover, these companies are very young, and 14 to 28 months is a substantial fraction of their existence. Because young companies often grow by $50{-}100\\%$ per annum in their first years of operation, the small differences in board service and IPO company age mean that new venture-backed companies have only half the level of sales and earnings of old venture-backed companies have when they go public. This is a significant reduction in firm size. (As seen below, the effect of board service on the size and market value of equity stakes is quite large in economic terms.)  \n\nOdudunsspeeqju sa   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"10\">Sample of first IPOs for 62 funds Full sample of 433 1POs Dependentvariable</td><td rowspan=\"10\">Age of IPO Duration of board</td><td rowspan=\"10\">firm (months) service (months) frm (months) Agc of IPO</td><td></td><td>[-2.85] -0.018 -19.40</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[-- 3.25] 0.037 -20.76</td></tr><tr><td>-14.94</td><td>[-2.55] 0.045 [1L0-]</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[8s-] 0.082 - 1.47] -13.00 一</td></tr><tr><td>[- 3.43] -- 28.81 -26.83</td><td>0.106 [1.55]</td></tr><tr><td>[-3.91]</td><td>-0.030 [-0.48]</td></tr><tr><td>[-2.95]</td><td>0.091 [2.23]</td></tr><tr><td>[- 3.26]</td><td>0.037 [0.95]</td></tr><tr><td>First-fund venture firms sixyearsold</td><td>previousfourmonths Number of IPOs in</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>6.674 [1.25]</td><td>3.312 [1.25]</td><td rowspan=\"11\">[- 1.41] Venturc capital under firms prior to IPO</td><td rowspan=\"11\">[-- 1.41]</td><td rowspan=\"11\">0.075 [3.31] 96.81 [1.01]</td><td rowspan=\"11\"></td><td rowspan=\"11\">0.351 0.001 0.189 0.007</td></tr><tr><td>6.475 [1.22]</td><td></td><td>-- 54.84 [-0.61]</td></tr><tr><td>4.736 [1.04]</td><td>2.466 [1.10]</td><td>-0.004 [610-] -55.65 [89'0-] 0.192</td></tr><tr><td>2.718 [0.64]</td><td></td><td>[0.01] 0.168 0.77</td></tr><tr><td>[- 3.38] --16.92</td><td>2.816 [s11] 0.035 [0.22] -0.037</td><td>319.15 [4.15] 0.235</td></tr><tr><td>[-3.81] - 15.20</td><td></td><td>[4.90] 0.207 0.000 326.65</td></tr><tr><td>-0.781 [870-]</td><td>1.059 [SL'0] 0.265 [2.71] -0.020</td><td>[0.57] 0.232 24.46 [2.66] 0.171</td></tr><tr><td>-4.6.30 [8-」</td><td>Equity stake of all venture Underwriter rank offering size</td><td>109.13 management Constant</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n#### 3.2.3. Underpricing  \n\nTable 5 presents underpricing regressions. Muscarella and Vetsuypens (1989) and Ritter (1987) view underpricing as a cost that companies bear when they go public because of the uncertainty surrounding the true value of the offering. Younger companies have more uncertainty and hence greater underpricing. I use two specifications to control for the reputation of the venture capital frm. In all regressions, IPOs backed by young venture capital firms are associated with greater underpricing (whether new venture capital firms are defined as firms under six years old or using the logarithm of venture firm age). When the logarithm of the length of board service and the age of the offering company at IPO are included, the size and significance of the reputation coefficients change very little. Of the two variables that represent early IPOs, length of board service has the larger impact on underpricing although it is only marginally significant. When underwriter rank is included in the regressions (third and sixth columns), the size and significance of the coeffcients on the reputation variables are greatly reduced. Although companies brought to market by established venture firms are less underpriced, the difference is largely due to higher underwriter reputation. Finally, greater IPO market liquidity, smaller offering sizes, and less uncertainty reduce underpricing.  \n\n#### 3.2.4. Venture capitalists′ equity stakes  \n\nTable 6 reports results for regressions examining a direct measure of the cost of grandstanding: the fraction of the company's equity held by all venture capitalists prior to the IPO. If young venture firms incur costs by rushing companies to the IPO market, the percent of equity held by venture capital investors should be lower.  \n\nThe regressions show that young venture capital firms (using either firms that are under six years old or the logarithm of age to control for reputation) receive a significantly smaller fraction of the company's equity. The offering size has little impact on the venture capitalists' equity stake. The most important factor in the percentage of equity held prior to the IPO is the length of board service for the lead venture capital firm. In fact, when length of board service is included, the size and significance of the venture capital reputation variables are reduced, indicating that shorter relationships (and hence earlier IPOs) are the cause of reduced equity stakes as predicted by the grandstanding hypothesis. The longer the venture capital firm has been on the board of directors, the larger is its equity stake. The results in Table 6 indicate that the 12- 14 month shorter board service by young lead venture capital firms estimated in Table 4 accounts for more than half of the smaller equity stake of young venture firms (nearly $3\\%$ of the $4.7\\%$ difference).  \n\nThe sample is 433 venture-backed IPOs from 1978-1987. The dependent variable is underpricing of the IPO (i.e., the first-day return on the IPO firm). Independent variables include a dummy variable that equals one if the venture organization is less than six years old, the logarithm of the lead venture capital firm's age in months,the cumulative number of IPOs(bothventure-backed and nonventurebacked) in the previous four months, the logarithm of IPO offering size, the standard deviation of the stock returns from day 2 to day 20 after the IPO, the natural logarithm of the IPO company's age in months, the logarithm of the number of months that the lead venture capitalist has been on the company's board of directors, the Carter and Manaster (1990) underwriter rank, and the capital under management at the lead venture capital firm. All regressions include industry dummy variables to control for any fixed effects.

Much of the difference between young and old venture capital firms in percentage equity stakes is explained by the length of board service, an indication that young venture capital firms incur costs by taking companies public earlier. To test whether early IPOs have differential costs on young and old venture firms, I include interaction terms between reputation measures and IPO maturity in the regressions of Tables 5 and 6, but these interaction terms are insignificant.  \n\n### 4. Alternative explanations  \n\nMegginson and Weiss (1991) and Barry, Muscarella, Peavy, and Vetsuypens (1990) offer evidence that venture-backed firms go public earlier than nonventure-backed firms because venture capitalists certify the quality of offerings. Venture capitalists repeatedly bring companies to the IPO market and can credibly commit not to offer overpriced shares. Their conclusions are similar to Carter and Manaster's (1990) findings about the reputation of underwriters and the underpricing of public offerings. Certification by venture capitalists is potentially consistent with grandstanding. Megginson and Weiss examine venture-backed versus nonventure-backed IPOs, but they do not directly test for differences between types of venture capitalists. The grandstanding hypothesis has important implications for the IPO timing of young and old venture capital firms. Venture capital certification could lower underwriting costs and underpricing on average, but young venture capital firms may still have incentives to bring IPOs to market earlier than established venture capital firms in order to establish a track record and raise new capital.  \n\nAnother explanation of earlier venture-backed IPOs is that investors recycle money within asset classes. Venture capitalists bring companies public to provide liquidity for previous investments. If investors reinvest the profits from previous venture capital investments into new venture capital funds, the venture capital firm can receive capital sooner by returning cash to investors.  \n\nHowever, only the grandstanding hypothesis implies that young venture capital firms have an incentive to perform early IPOs. The certification predicts that older venture capital firms should be associated with IPOs that are earlier or at least not later than those of new venture firms. If certification affects the cost but not the timing of IPOs, then there should be no difference between the two groups. The recycling hypothesis also predicts no difference in IPO timing between old and young venture capital firms. The results in Section 3, however, show that young venture firms do take companies public earlier, supporting the existence of grandstanding.  \n\nGrandstanding also predicts that young venture capital firms have an incentive to incur the costs of early IPOs because their fundraising is significantly more sensitive to performance than is an older firm's fundraising. Consequently, the duration of board service or the age of the offering company should explain a portion of the differences in underpricing and equity stakes. Certification implies that older venture capital firms have more reputational capital and hence lower costs of going public early. Neither the certification nor recycling hypothesis predicts that the length of board service at IPO explains the differences in underpricing and equity stakes between young and old venture firms. The results in Section 3 establish that a portion of the underpricing and equity stake differences is explained by length of board service, supporting the predictions of the grandstanding hypothesis.  \n\n### 5. Conclusion  \n\nReputational concerns affect the IPO timing decisions of young venture capital fund managers. Young venture capital firms raise money for a new fund sooner after an IPO and the size of a young firm's next fund is more dependent on the number of IPOs it has financed previously than is the size of an old venture firm's next fund. Companies backed by new venture capital firms are younger at IPO than those backed by established venture capital firms, and the young venture capitalists have been on their boards for a shorter time. However, young lead venture firms bear the costs of early IPOs by receiving smaller equity stakes. These differences are consistent with the predictions of grandstanding.  \n\nThe issues addressed by the grandstanding hypothesis and the empirical results provide insights for the venture capital industry. Signaling seems to cause real wealth losses. Limited partners bear a large fraction of the costs from early IPOs. More than 400 new venture capital firms entered the industry after 1978. The tremendous entry of new venture capital firms and the incentives to grandstand potentially explain some of the declining returns on venture capital in the 1980s.  \n\nBecause the venture capitalist typically receives a fixed fee compensation based on the size of the fund $(2-3\\%$ of assets under management per annum) in addition to $20\\%$ of the fund's profits from investing, the venture capitalist has incentives to grow the firm's capital under management by starting large follow-on funds. Gompers and Lerner (1995b) show that the present value of the annual fee is typically as large as the present value of the profits. Annual fixed fees are four to six times larger than the fees received by public market money managers documented by Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1992). The desire to increase the size of the funds in turn increases the incentive to grandstand. Reduced fixed fees and increased profit sharing in large funds might better align the incentives of venture capitalists with the goals of investors.  \n\nFuture research should examine the effects of venture capital on the long-run prospects of entrepreneurial projects and its relation to underpricing and investment characteristics. Entrepreneurs have little information on the IPO market in general or venture capitalists’ role in that process in particular. While this paper does not address the reasons entrepreneurs seek financing from young venture capital firms who then rush them to the IPO market, the issue deserves greater attention by examining the relation between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs, the decision to accept venture financing, the process of deciding to go public, and the long-term impact of venture capital financing in general and grandstanding in particular on the life cycle and performance of companies. For example, what is the impact of venture capital financing on pre- and post-IPO sales, earnings, and asset growth rates? Mikkelson, Partch, and Shah (1995) examine accounting performance in a sample of venture-backed and nonventure-backed IPOs and find no long-run differences, but costs of early IPOs could exist. Assessing these other costs would be an important addition not only to the literature on venture capital investments, but also to the knowledge about the decision to go public.  \n\n## References  \n\nAllen, Franklin and Gerald Faulhaber, 1989, Signalling by underpricing in the IPO markei, Journal of Financial Economics 23. 303--323.   \nBarry.

This paper examines how changes in public market signals affected venture capital investing between 1975 and 1998. We find that venture capitalists with the most industry experience increase their investments the most when public market signals become more favorable. Their reaction to an increase is greater than the reaction of venture capital organizations with relatively little industry experience and those with considerable experience but in other industries. The increase in investment rates does not affect the success of these transactions adversely to a significant extent. These findings are consistent with the view that venture capitalists rationally respond to attractive investment opportunities signaled by public market shifts.  \n\nPaul Gompers   \nMorgan Hall   \nGraduate School of Business Administration   \nHarvard University   \nBoston, MA 02163   \nand NBER   \npgompers @hbs.edu   \nJosh Lerner   \nRock Center for Entrepreneurship   \nGraduate School of Business Administration   \nHarvard University   \nBoston, MA 02163   \nand NBER   \njosh@ hbs.edu   \nAnna Kovner   \nMorgan Hall   \nGraduate School of Business Administration   \nHarvard University   \nBoston, MA 02163   \nakovner@hbs.edu   \nDavid Scharfstein   \nMorgan Hall   \nGraduate School of Business Administration   \nHarvard University   \nBoston, MA 02163   \nand NBER   \ndscharfstein $@$ hbs.edu  \n\n### 1. Introduction  \n\nThe high volatility of the venture capital industry is well documented.  This volatility manifests itself in a number of ways: the funds flowing to venture capital firms, the investments firms make in portfolio companies, and the financial performance of portfolio companies and venture capital firms. (Gompers and Lerner, 2004). Much of this volatility appears to be tied to valuations in public equity markets. An increase in IPO valuations leads venture capital firms to raise more funds (Gompers and Lerner, 1998; Jeng and Wells, 2000), an effect that is particularly strong among younger venture capital firms (Kaplan and Schoar, 2005). Moreover, returns of venture capital funds appear to be highly correlated with the returns on the market as a whole (Cochrane, 2005; Kaplan and Schoar, 2005; Ljundqvist and Richardson, 2003).  \n\nMany industry observers (see, for instance, Gupta, 2000) argue that the volatility of the venture capital industry is a symptom of overreaction by venture capitalists and entrepreneurs to perceived investment opportunities. These swings result in periods in which too many competing companies are funded, followed by ones in which not enough companies have access to capital. The boom of 1998-2000 provides an extreme illustration of these problems. Funding during these years grew dramatically—in real terms, the financing level in 2000 was more than 30 times the level in 1991—and was concentrated in two areas: Internet and telecommunication investments, which accounted for $39\\%$ and $17\\%$ of all venture disbursements in 1999. Considerable sums were devoted to supporting very similar firms—e.g., the nine dueling Internet pet food suppliers and the many companies that undertook the extremely capital-intensive process of building second cable networks in residential communities. Meanwhile, many apparently promising areas such as advanced materials, energy technologies, and micro manufacturing languished unfunded as venture capitalists raced to focus on the most visible and popular investment areas.  \n\nThis alleged overreaction may have its roots in the behavioral biases of venture capitalists who irrationally associate past investment successes with future investment opportunities. Or it may stem from venture capitalists who feel compelled to follow the herd out of concern for the reputation consequences of being contrarians (Scharfstein and Stein, 1990) Indeed, in 1999, even private equity firms with investment mandates to invest in leveraged buyouts felt compelled to back Internet startups.  \n\nA contrasting view is that the volatility of the venture capital industry stems not from overreaction, but from the inherent volatility of fundamentals. In this view, fluctuation in venture capital investment activity is simply a response to changes in investment opportunities.  There may be shocks to the investment opportunities of existing entrepreneurial firms, or entry by new entrepreneurs, both of which increase the demand for capital.  \n\nThis paper takes a step towards distinguishing between the “overreaction view and the “fundamentals view” by examining the responses of different classes of venture investors. We start with the observation (and empirically document) that the most experienced venture capital firms generally have the best performance (Sorensen, 2004). We then examine how these most successful investors respond to public market signals of investment opportunities. Are they more prone to increase their investments when the market heats ups? And, how well do they do on these investments relative to less experienced venture capitalists? If we find that the most experienced investors are more prone to increase their investment levels when the market heats up, this suggests that shifts in fundamentals are likely an important component of venture capital investing. This interpretation is further supported if there is also little degradation in their performance. On the other hand, if we observe that the least experienced venture capitalists are most likely to increase their investment activity during hot markets, this lends more credibility to the view that overreaction is a more important cause of volatility in the venture capital industry.  \n\nOur empirical results indicate that investment by the most experienced venture capital firms—notably those with the most industry experience—are most responsive to public market signals of investment opportunities. We start by showing that venture capital investment activity at the industry level is very sensitive to public market signals of industry attractiveness such as Tobin's Q and IPO activity; a shift from the bottom to the top quartile in these measures increases the number of investments by more than $20\\%$ . This effect is driven largely by venture capital firms with the most experience doing deals in the industry. General experience (across all industries) has no effect on investment sensitivity to industry $\\mathsf Q$ and IPO activity, once we control for industry experience. Moreover, although the success rate for deals done in a hot market is lower than it is for deals done in a cold market, the difference is small. This difference between hot and cold market performance is even smaller for experienced venture capital firms than it is for less experienced venture capital firms. These findings suggest that an important component of volatility in venture capital investment activity is driven by volatility of fundamentals.  \n\nOf independent interest is our finding of the importance of industry-specific rather than general experience. It points to the importance of industry-specific human capital and suggests that a critical part of venture capital investing is the network of industry contacts to identify good investment opportunities as well as the know-how to manage these investments.  These contacts and know-how come only from long-standing experience doing deals in an industry.  \n\nThis rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the construction of the data and provides some basic summary statistics. Section 3 examines the impact of shifts in valuations and IPO activity and the determinants of venture capital organization investment activity. In that section, we also look at the determinants of successful investments both in terms of the investment cycle and the characteristics of the venture capital organizations. Section 4 concludes the paper.  \n\n### 2. The Data  \n\n#### A. Constructing the Sample  \n\nOur data on venture investments come from Thomson Venture Economics (Venture Economics). This database provides information about both venture capital investors and the portfolio companies in which they invest. We consider an observation to be the first record of a venture capital organization and portfolio company pair, i.e., the first time a venture capitalist invests in a particular company. This approach results in a dataset with multiple observations for most portfolio companies since several venture capital firms typically invest in a company. We exclude follow-on investments by a venture capital organization in the same portfolio company since these investments may result from different considerations than do initial investments.  \n\nOur analysis focuses on data covering investments from 1975 to 1998, dropping information prior to 1975 due to data quality concerns.1 In keeping with industry estimates of a maturation period of three to five years for venture companies, we drop information after 1998 so that the outcome data can be meaningfully interpreted. As a result, we are not studying investments made at the height of the Internet boom (1999 and 2000) and the crash that followed.  \n\nFrom 1975 to 1998, Venture Economics provides information on 2,179 venture capital firms investing in 16,354 companies. This results in a sample of 42,559 observations of unique venture capital firm - portfolio company pairs.  \n\n#### B. Critical Measures and Summary Statistics  \n\nBefore we turn to an analysis of investment cycles, there are three data construction issues we need to address.  \n\nThe first issue is how to classify venture capital industries. Our approach is to assign all investments into nine broad industry classes based on Venture Economics' classification of the industry. The original sample of investments was classified into 69 separate industry segments. However, these 69 industries are too narrowly defined for our purposes, as they do not correspond to lines of specialization within or across venture capital firms. These 69 industries were thus combined to arrive at nine broader industries. The industries we construct from the narrower definitions are: Internet and  \n\nComputers, Communications and Electronics, Business and Industrial, Consumer, Energy, Biotech and Healthcare, Financial Services, Business Services, and all other. While any industry classification is somewhat arbitrary, we believe that our classification scheme captures businesses that have similarities in technology and management expertise that would make specialization in such industries meaningful. In addition, this scheme minimizes the subjectivity associated with classifying firms into narrower industry groupings.  \n\nPanel A of Table 1 shows the distribution across the nine broad industries. The first column is the number of companies in each industry. It is no surprise that Internet and Computers is the largest industry with 4,679 companies. Biotech and Healthcare, Communications and Electronics, and Consumer are the next largest industries with between 2,285 and 2,745 companies. The other industries are considerably smaller. The table also reports the number of observations for each industry in our sample; there are more observations than companies because there are multiple venture capital investors in most of the companies in our sample. On average, there are 2.6 venture capital investors in each company. The overall industry distribution provides some comfort that our industry classification is meaningful.  While there is variation in the number of observations across industries, there are enough observations in each industry to make our analysis feasible.  \n\nThe second challenge has to do with the measurement of perceived investment opportunities.  We use two measures of perceived investment opportunities in our analysis, industry Q and IPO activity. Because we do not know whether these measures overstate or understate true investment opportunities, we will refer to industry Q and IPO activity simply as “public market signals.'\"  \n\nThe measurement of Q follows the standard approach in the investment literature. We calculate Q as the ratio of market value of the firm to the book value of assets, where the market value of the firm is measured as the book value of assets plus the market value of equity less the book value of equity. Since we cannot observe the Q of private firms that constitute the pool of potential venture capital investments, we use an estimate of Q for public companies as a proxy. However, in order to do so, we need to link the SIC codes of public companies to Venture Economics industries on which our data is based. Our procedure is to identify the SIC codes of all Venture Economics firms that went public. Because there are multiple SIC codes associated with each of our nine industries, we construct Q as a weighted average of the industry Q of the public companies in those SIC codes, where the weights are the relative fractions of firms that went public within our nine industries. Within the SIC code, Q is calculated by equally weighting all public companies.  \n\nOur second, less standard measure is the level of venture capital-backed IPO activity in an industry. We use this measure for both theoretical and practical reasons. The theoretical rationale is based on the observation that IPOs are by far the most important (and profitable) means for venture capitalists to exit an investment (Gompers and Lerner, 2004). Thus, an increase in the number of IPOs in a particular sector may make investing in that sector more attractive. In addition, an increase in IPO activity may also attract more potential entrepreneurs into a sector, thereby increasing the pool of potential investments and the likelihood that a venture capitalist will find an attractive one. The practical rationale for using IPO activity is that our Q measure may not accurately reflect the shifts in public investors? appetite for venture capital-backed firms both because it uses data on mature public companies and relies on an inexact match between SIC codes and Venture Economics codes. Given the strong link between IPO activity and market valuations (Pagano, Panetta, and Zingales, 1998 and Ritter and Welch, 2002), the IPO measure may actually be a better proxy for the public market's perception of the types of investments in our sample.  \n\nFigure 1 shows the relationship between industry venture capital investment activity and the two measures of public market signals for four of the industries in the sample. In Internet and Computers, the correlation between IPOs and investment activity appears to be very high throughout the period. This high correlation can also be seen in Q in Figure 2. In other industries, the relationship is less pronounced. For instance, in both Biotechnology and Healthcare and Energy, the number of investments declined during the last half of the 1990s, even as the number of IPOs in the industry climbed.  \n\nThe final challenge is to measure the experience of the venture capital groups in the sample. The second panel of Table 1 presents data on three characteristics of venture capital firms that we use throughout the paper. The first such characteristic, “General Experience,”’ is the total number of investments made by a venture capital firm prior to the time of the investment in question. The second characteristic, \"Industry Experience, is constructed similarly, but includes only investments in the same industry as the investment in question. The third characteristic, “Specialization\" is the fraction of all previous investments that the venture capital organization made in a particular industry, i.e., this specialization measure is the ratio of industry to general experience. The specialization measure is not computed for the first investment by each venture Organization.  \n\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the distribution of general experience, industry experience, and specialization measures across all venture organization-industry pairs in the sample. Since many of these observations include cases where the venture capital firm did not invest in an industry in a particular year, we report the sub-sample that includes only investors in the industry in a given year. In addition, we provide summary data for 1985, 1990, and 1995.  \n\nOverall, venture capital firms made an average of 36.3 previous investments, of which 4.1 were in the same industry. The numbers are higher if one conditions the observation on the venture capital firm making an investment in the industry during the year. The medians of these experience measures are considerably lower, reflecting the skewness of the distribution. Not surprisingly, there is an increase in experience over time. On average, investments are made by venture capital firms with $19.75\\%$ Of their investments in the industry of the company in which they are investing. This suggests that most venture capital firms spread out their investments across industries.  \n\nTable 2 breaks out venture capital firm characteristics by quartile, and examines the relationships among them.  Industry experience and specialization quartiles were calculated by industry, by year, so that industries with fewer investments would not be disproportionately sampled in lower quartiles, and that the highest experience quartiles would not disproportionately reflect later investments. The first quartile represents the least experienced or specialized firms, while the fourth quartile measures the highest. Not surprisingly, venture capital firms in the higher quartiles of industry experience have made more investments overall than firms in lower quartiles of industry experience. This shows up as well as a high correlation between industry experience and general experience. Specialization, on the other hand, is not highly correlated with the experience measures; in fact, it is negatively correlated with general experience. This low correlation is driven by the firms in the highest specialization quartile who make fewer investments than those firms who specialize less. The pattern is probably due to the fact that extreme specialization limits the pool of investments from which a venture capital firm can choose.  \n\n### 3. Analysis  \n\n#### A. The Determinants of Investments  \n\nWe first focus on understanding how public market signals affect the investment decisions of venture capitalists.  In Section 3.B, we turn to understanding the determinants of investment success.  \n\nTable 3 presents a regression-based analysis of the relationship between the number of investments and our public market signals. The first column shows the results of regressing the logarithm of the annual number of investments in an industry on the lagged logarithm of the number of IPOs in the industry, including industry and year fixed effects. The coefficient estimate implies that an increase in IPO activity from the bottom to the top quartile increases the number of investments by $22\\%$ . Likewise, the second column indicates that there is a strong positive relationship between industry investment activity and Q. An increase from the bottom Q quartile to the top $\\mathsf Q$ quartile increases industry investment by $22\\%$ . The third and fourth columns of Table 3 report the results of using detrended variables in the regression. For each industry, we detrend both industry investments and the public market measures. We then use the residuals in the regression. Again the magnitude of the effects is large and similar across regressions, although the explanatory power of the IPO measure appears to be significantly greater than that of Q. These regressions would appear to validate the use of Q and IPO activity as measures of public market signals that affect venture capital investments.  \n\nTable  4  begins  to  look at  the  relationship  between  venture  capital  firm characteristics and investment behavior. In this table, we use as observations each venture capitalist-industry pair in each year the venture organization is active, i.e., all years following the first observation of an organization and ceasing in the year in which the organization's final investment is observed.  We first present results using IPO activity and then check for robustness using the Q measure. The results are essentially the same using either measure.  \n\nThe first column of Table 4 repeats the industry level regression at the venture organization-industry level. We include both industry and year fixed effects. Not surprisingly, the regression indicates that venture capital firms tend to increase their investments in years and industries in which IPO activity increases. The coefficient, which is statistically significant, implies that an increase in IPO activity from the $25^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile to the $75^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile boosts the venture organization’s investment activity in the industry by $4.9\\%$  \n\nAs the second column of Table 4 indicates, there is also a strong positive relationship between general experience and investment activity.  The third column decomposes experience into industry experience and non-industry experience. The regression indicates that what drives the relationship is industry experience; prior investment activity outside the industry has no appreciable relationship to investment activity within the industry. The average venture capital firm in the highest quartile of industry experience invests $24\\%$ more in the industry than a firm in the lowest quartile of industry experience.  \n\nColumns 4 and 5 of Table 4 add industry specialization to the regressions. In both regressions, it is clear that prior focus on a particular industry increases future investment in the industry. The results in column 5 indicate that an organization in the top industry specialization quartile makes $8\\%$ more investments in that the industry than one in the bottom quartile. Finally, the last two columns of Table 4 replicate the results in columns 3 and 5 using Q rather than IPO activity as the measure of the public market. The basic patterns continue to hold in these regressions, and the magnitude of the effects is similar.  \n\nThe next two tables present our main results on how venture capital firms with different characteristics respond to changes in public valuations and activity. In this table, we add to the specifications in Table 4 variables that interact our public market measures with our measures of firm characteristics, i.e., general experience, industry experience, and industry specialization. Throughout our discussion of the results, when we refer to periods with high IPO activity we are referring to those in the top quartile of IPO activity; low IPO activity refers to those periods in the bottom quartile. Likewise, high general experience, industry experience, and specialization refers to venture capital firms in the top quartile, while those with low general experience, industry experience, and specialization refers to those in the bottom quartile.  \n\nThe first column of Table 5 indicates that the industry investment activity of more experienced venture capital firms is more sensitive to IPO activity than it is for less experienced venture capital firms. This effect is statistically significant. It is also much larger in magnitude than the effect from the average firm in the sample. At the mean of the other variables, highly experienced venture capital organizations invest $9.2\\%$ more when IPO activity is high than when it is low. By contrast, relatively inexperienced venture capital firms actually invest $1.2\\%$ less at times when IPO activity is high rather than low. The results also indicate that industry experience increases the level of investment, not just the sensitivity of investment to IPO activity. More industryexperienced venture capital firms invest $11.9\\%$ more than industry-inexperienced firms when IPO activity is low and $22.4\\%$ more when IPO activity is high.  \n\nWhile both industry and non-industry experience is positively associated with greater investment sensitivity to IPO activity (columns 2 and 3 of Table 5), only industry experience retains its positive effect when both interaction terms are included in the same regression (column 4 of Table 5). In fact, the non-industry experience interaction with industry IPO activity is negative in this regression. When IPO activity is high, industryexperienced venture capital firms invest $7.4\\%$ more than when it is low, while venture capital firms with experience out of the industry invest $2.0\\%$ less when IPO activity is high.  \n\nThe fifth and sixth columns of Table 5 look at the effect of industry specialization on investment behavior. Consistent with our findings on industry experience, we find that more specialized venture capital firms tend to increase their industry investments by more than less specialized firms when IPO activity increases. The effect, however, is small, implying an increase in investment by $5.7\\%$ for specialized firms and $3.9\\%$ for less specialized firms.  \n\nFinally, Table 5 in the last two columns, reports the results using $\\mathsf Q$ asan alternative public market measure. Those columns replicate the basic findings in columns 4 and 6 of the table. The magnitude of the effects is similar to those estimated using IPO activity.  \n\nIn Table 6 we check whether our results are driven by venture capital firms that choose not to invest in a given industry. Thus, we eliminate from the regressions all observations in which the venture capital firm made no investments in the industry in a given year. All of the findings in Table 5 continue to hold although the magnitude of the effects is somewhat smaller.  \n\nCollectively, these results suggest that industry-specific human capital is an important channel through which experience influences the reactions of venture capital firms to shifts in public market signals. Contrary to popular wisdom, it does not appear that the booms and busts are being driven by the investment behavior of inexperienced or new venture capital firms. In fact, these results suggest that the cyclicality seen in the venture capital industry is driven mostly by the more successful venture firms, that is, those with the most experience. Section 3.B considers the question of whether the sensitivity of more experienced firms to public market signals is a rational reaction to fundamentals or an overreaction.  \n\n#### B. The Determinants of Investment Success  \n\nIn this section we explore whether the greater responsiveness of more experienced venture capital firms to public market signals is efficient. If these experienced firms are able to ramp up the number of investments they make in response to public market signals, but suffer a significant degradation of performance, the investment response to public market signals may, in fact, be an overreaction. In addition to the practitioner accounts alluded to above, there are at least two reasons to believe this might be the case. First, Baker, Wurgler, and Stein (2003) show that industrial firms whose investment is most sensitive to Q have the lowest subsequent stock returns following periods of heavy investment. A similar effect might be observed among experienced venture capital firms whose investment is most sensitive to Q and IPO activity. Second, at the same time that venture capital firms are buying equity in portfolio companies, these companies are, of course, issuing equity. We know from numerous studies, including Loughran and Ritter (1995), that when firms issue equity, their subsequent stock returns are abnormally low.  \n\nTo assess this question, we examine the performance of the companies in which the venture capital firms invest. Ideally, one would have data on the actual returns on the firm's investment. Unfortunately, the best we can do is to determine whether the investment resulted in what would appear to be a profitable exit for the venture capital firm. This is most likely the case if the company went public, registered for an IPO (as of the date we collected the data from Venture Economics), or was acquired or merged. Venture Economics does not collect valuation information for all of the companies that were merged or acquired and it is possible that these outcomes are not as lucrative as those where the company exited with a public offering. However, investments in the category we characterize as successes are likely to have generated higher returns that the investments those that have not yet exited or have been characterized as bankrupt or defunct.  \n\nThe final column of Table 2 provides some initial indications of the patterns of success by venture capital firm characteristics. The tabulations suggest that investments made by venture capital firms with more general—and especially more industryspecific—experience are more successful. The patterns with specialization are nonlinear, but the least specialized organizations appear to be the poorest performers. One consideration in the definition of specialization is that young venture capital firms are more likely to be in the first or fourth quartile, since the specialization measure is always $100\\%$ if its second deal is in the same industry as its first, or $0\\%$ if its second investment is in a different industry. We later consider the results looking only at organizations at the point in time where they made more than 10 investments and achieve consistent results. Our interpretation of these tabulations must be cautious, of course, because of the lack of controls for industry and time period.  \n\nTable 7 examines the determinants of success in a regression framework. The dependent variable here is a dummy variable, which takes on the value one if the company was successful before the end of 2003.2 Each initial investment by a venture capital firm in a portfolio company is used as an observation.? In addition to the industry and year controls used earlier, we also control for the stage of the company and the financing round at the time of the investment, since these are likely to be associated with the outcome. As in our previous regressions, we exclude observations occurring after 1998 in order for the outcomes of the investments to be meaningful.  \n\nThe first two columns of the table suggest there is a negative, but statistically insignificant, relationship between IPO activity and success in the sample as a whole. The third column of Table 7 indicates that more experienced venture capital firms are more likely to make successful investments. However, the fifth column shows that the effect of experience is limited to venture capital firms with industry experience. Investments made by venture capitalists with the most industry experience are $4.3\\%$ more likely to succeed than those made by the least experienced venture capitalists. Given a baseline success rate of $54\\%$ , this amounts to a significant increase in the probability of success. The regressions with industry specialization in columns 6 and 7 support this basic finding on the role of industry specialization. The last two columns replicate the results using $\\mathsf Q$ as our measure of the public market signal.  \n\nTable 7 makes it clear that experienced venture capital firms do not perform worse on average, as a result of being more sensitive to shifts in public market activities. Table 8 digs deeper by investigating whether experienced venture capital firms perform worse on the investments they make when IPO activity and $\\mathsf Q$ are high. The results indicate that just the opposite is true. Overall, venture capital firms do somewhat worse on the investments they take when there is a lot of IPO activity and Q is high, although the estimated effect is statistically insignificant. However, the more experienced venture capitalists exhibit less degradation in their performance than do the less experienced venture capitalists. Based on the results in Table 7 and Table 8, it would be hard to argue that the greater responsiveness of experienced venture capital firms to IPO activity and Q comes at the expense of performance.  \n\n#### C. Robustness Analyses  \n\nThis section summarizes further analyses we undertook to determine whether our basic findings are robust.  \n\nAlternative Proxies for Public Market Signals. Our analysis used Q and the IPO activity of venture capital-backed firms as proxies for public market signals. We expanded our IPO activity measure to include all IPOs, not just those that were venture capital backed. The two measures are highly correlated (O.81) since both measures include venture-backed IPOs. Not surprisingly, the results were not appreciably altered. We also considered several other market based measures, including the earnings to price ratio, market to book ratio and historical industry returns. All of these measures led to similar results to those presented.  \n\nAlternative Success Measures. Our primary outcome measure codes all mergers and acquisitions as successes. To validate this choice, we further researched the 3,650 outcomes that Venture Economics recorded as mergers or acquisitions using the Factiva database and the SDC mergers and acquisitions database, finding values for 1,263 companies. Of the 508 merged or acquired companies for which Venture Economics had information on the total amount invested in the company and for which we found valuation information, 431 companies $(94\\%)$ had merger or acquisition values greater than the total amount invested in the company, with a median sale price of seven times the amount of money invested. This supports our thesis that merged or acquired companies are likely to have been high-return investments for venture capital firms. However, one must be cautious in this interpretation since we were unable to find information on the majority of the mergers and acquisitions, either because they were purchased by other private entities or purchased by public companies in deals that were not accompanied by a press release (perhaps because of their small size). Making the highly conservative assumption that all companies whose value we could not determine were not successful, we then redefined a successful investment as one in which the company went public, or was in registration for a public offering, or was in a merger or acquisition for which we were able to find a value. The results were similar to those presented.  \n\nOne Observation per Company. Since the dataset includes multiple observations on the same portfolio companies, each outcome reflects not only a given venture capital firm's characteristics, but those of the other venture capitalists invested in the company. As an additional robustness check to the relationship between experience, industry experience, specialization, and success, we used a sample with one observation for each portfolio company and the average levels of each variable of the venture capitalists investing in the company. In these specifications, both industry and non-industry experience are positively associated with success, as is specialization, although the coefficient on specialization is not significantly different than zero. In the absence of more information about the specific roles that each venture capital organization plays in the selection and development of the company, it is difficult to draw any conclusions from the interaction of the different venture capitalists which invested in the company. This is a rich topic for future research.  \n\n### 4. Conclusions  \n\nThe venture capital industry is a highly volatile one, as dramatic fluctuations in fundraising and investment activity over the past few years demonstrate. These fluctuations seem to be related to changes in the public market valuations and activity. Practitioner accounts and the academic literature suggest that it would be valuable to understand the impact of this volatility on the success of venture capital investments: do public market shifts lead venture capitalists to make poor investment choices, or rather do they provide valuable information to investors? We address this question by examining the determinants and success of investments by the venture industry as a whole, as well as by subclasses of firms with different levels of experience and specialization.  \n\nWe analyze over forty thousand venture capital investment decisions over the past two decades. We find that the greatest response to shifts in the public markets is not by new or inexperienced groups, but rather by specialized organizations with considerable industry experience. Not only do the investments of these organizations tend to be more successful in general, but there is no appreciable degradation in their performance with the changing conditions.  \n\nOur results suggest that shifts in public markets provide information, whether directly to the venture investors or else to individuals who then seek venture financing. Not all venture groups, however, are able to take advantage of this information: the critical factor appears to be human capital.4  \n\nThe greater investment sensitivity is associated with industry, but not nonindustry, investment experience. Whether that effect is from greater knowledge of the industry or better networks that allow for recruitment of senior management, customers, and strategic partners needs further exploration.  \n\nA variety of open issues remain for future research. First, as we acknowledge above, the precise mechanisms behind the relative performance of more specialized organizations remain unclear. For instance, is it possible to disentangle the relative importance of superior investment selection and ability to add value from the ability to persuade entrepreneurs to accept ones’ capital? (While Kaplan and Stromberg (2004) present an intriguing initial look at the venture capital decision-making process, many open questions remain. Sorensen (2004) represents another important step in untangling these issues.) Second, because we sought to examine investment outcomes, our analysis only extends through 1998: we do not analyze the events of 1999 and 2000. While the venture capital market has seen many cycles in the past, the magnitude of the boom and bust during this period was second to none. Understanding whether the patterns delineated above continued to hold during that most dramatic of cycles is an important question for future researchers to examine.  \n\naccess to a large pool of human capital that they can redeploy across sectors. That is, one might think of venture capital firms as having an internal labor market to complement an internal capital market. However, our finding that industry experience is the key driver of investment activity suggests that it is not easy to redeploy venture capitalists across sectors. This would be the case if human capital in other sectors—in the case of venture capitalists within an organization that specialize in a given industry, say biotechnology—-were unable or unwilling to shift focus to a different industry, e.g., the Internet. This prediction is in line with the view that diversified firms have a difficult time redeploying capital into sectors with more investment opportunities: see Scharfstein and Stein (2000), Scharfstein (1998), and Rajan, Servaes, and Zingales (2000). Fulghieri and Sevilir (2004) model some of these issues in a venture capital context.  \n\n## Kererences  \n\nBaker, Malcolm, Jeremy C. Stein, and Jeffrey Wurgler, When Does the Market Matter?

Industry experience and specialization quartiles were calculated by industry, so that industries with fewer investments would not be disproportionately sampled in lower quartiles. The first quartile represents the least experienced or specialized, while the fourth is the highest.

    "reference_markdown": "# The Venture Capital Revolution  \n\nPaul Gompers and Josh Lerner  \n\nV enture capital has developed as an important intermediary in financial markets, providing capital to firms that might otherwise have difficulty attracting financing. These firms are typically small and young, plagued by high levels of uncertainty and large differences between what entrepreneurs and investors know. Moreover, these firms typically possess few tangible assets and operate in markets that change very rapidly. Venture capital organizations finance these high-risk, potentially high-reward projects, purchasing equity or equity-linked stakes while the firms are still privately held. The venture capital industry has developed a variety of mechanisms to overcome the problems that emerge at each stage of the investment process. At the same time, the venture capital process is also subject to various pathologies from time to time, which can create problems for investors or entrepreneurs.  \n\nThe primary focus of this article is on drawing together the empirical academic research on venture capital and highlighting what is still not known. With this focus in mind, four limitations should be acknowledged at the outset.  \n\nFirst, this paper will not address the many theoretical papers that examine various aspects of the venture capital market, much of it examining the role that venture capitalists play in mitigating agency conflicts between entrepreneurial firms and outside investors.1 Second, this article does not focus on the intricacies of the venture financing process from a practitioner point of view, nor on the legal and institutional considerations associated with raising venture financing. For discussion in this area, see Bartlett (1995), Halloran et al. (1998), and Levin (1998). Third, this paper will focus on the venture capital industry, and not on the economic function played by venture capitalists. In other words, we will not seek to address all methods of financing high-risk young firms. Along with venture capital, banks, individual investors (or “angels\"), and corporations are among the other providers of capital for these firms. Our understanding of many of the alternative forms of finance—especially “angel\" investing—is highly incomplete (Lerner, 1998). Thus, we will focus here on venture capital, defined as independent, professionally managed, dedicated pools of capital that focus on equity or equitylinked investments in privately held, high growth companies.  \n\nFinally, venture capital itself is a very young industry, which has been changing rapidly. Thus, while we can discuss the economics of venture capital in past years and today, the extent to which these insights will continue to apply to the venture industry of tomorrow remains unclear.  \n\n## The Origins of the Venture Capital Industry  \n\nThe first true venture capital firm was American Research and Development (ARD), established in 1946 by MIT President Karl Compton, General Georges F. Doriot, who was a professor at Harvard Business School, and local business leaders. This small group made high-risk investments in emerging companies that were based on technology developed for World War I1. The success of the investments ranged widely: almost half of ARD's profits during its 26-year existence as an independent entity came from its $\\$70,000$ investment in Digital Equipment Company in 1957, which grew in value to $\\$355$ million. ARD was structured as a publicly traded closed-end fund. A closed-end fund is a mutual fund whose shares trade from investor to investor on an exchange like an individual stock. These funds raise capital up front by selling shares to investors. If investors no longer desire to hold the investment, they can sell the shares on a public exchange to other investors. This provision allowed the fund to invest in illiquid assets, secure in the knowledge that they would not need to return investors’ capital in an uncertain time frame. Because it was a liquid investment that could be freely bought or sold, Security and Exchange Commission regulations did not preclude any class of investors from holding the shares. Institutional investors showed little interest in these shares, citing the risks associated with such an unproven new style of investing. As a result, shares in ARD were marketed mostly to individuals (Liles, 1977).  \n\nThe few other venture organizations begun in the decade after ARD's formation were also structured as closed-end funds. The publicly traded structure, however, was soon found to have some significant drawbacks. In a number of cases, brokers sold the funds to inappropriate investors: for example, to elderly investors who had a need for high current income rather than long-term capital gains. When the immediate profits promised by unscrupulous brokers did not materialize, these investors vented their frustration at the venture capitalists. In fact, much of General Doriot's time during the mid-1950s was spent addressing investors who had lost substantial sums on their shares of American Research and Development during theseyears.  \n\nThe first venture capital limited partnership, Draper, Gaither, and Anderson, was formed in 1958. Unlike closed-end funds, partnerships were exempt from securities regulations, including the exacting disclosure requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The set of the investors from which the funds could raise capital, however, was much more restricted. The interests in a given partnership could only be held by a limited number of institutions and high net-worth individual investors.  \n\nThe Draper partnership and its imitators followed the template of other limited partnerships common at the time: for example, those that had been formed to develop real estate projects and explore oil fields. In such cases, the partnerships had predetermined, finite lifetimes (usually ten years, though extensions were often allowed). Thus, unlike closed-end funds, which often had indefinite lives, the partnerships were required to return the assets to investors within a set period. From the days of the first limited partnerships, rather than selling successful investments after they went public and returning cash to their investors, the venture capitalists would simply give investors their allocation of shares in the company in which the venture firm had invested. In this way, the investors could choose when to realize the capital gains associated with the investment.  \n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, although limited partnerships became more common, they still accounted for a minority of the venture pool. During this time, most venture organizations raised money either through closed-end funds or Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs), which were federally chartered risk capital pools that proliferated during the 1960s. Spurred by fears of lagging American technological competitiveness after the Soviet launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957, the federal government had launched the SBIC program to encourage the development of the venture capital industry. Applicants who were able to secure a small amount of private capital received generous marching funds (or loan guarantees) from the government (for an overview, see Noone and Rubel, 1970). The SBIC program was poorly designed. The extensive regulations soon discouraged most established venture capitalists from participating in the program. Meanwhile, the limited scrutiny of applicants led to the entry of unscrupulous operators who invested either in firms with poor prospects or in outright fraudulent enterprises, typically controlled by friends or relatives. In a scenario that foreshadowed the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s, most of the SBICs collapsed in the late 1960s and1970s.  \n\nActivity in the venture industry increased dramatically in late 1970s and early  \n\n![](images/f8312f70c1b6b1bdb30936cb8ee736936574453a24489b3766543bf8b80df163.jpg)  \nFigure1 Commitments to the Venture Capital Industry (billions of 1999 dollars)   \nNote: Commitments are defined as the amount of money that is pledged to U.s. venture capital funds in that year. Source:Venture Economics and Asset Alternatives.  \n\n1980s. Figure 1 shows the total amount raised by venture partnerships since the late 1960s. The sources of funding have also shifted over time. In 1978, when $\\$424$ million was invested in new venture capital funds, individuals accounted for the largest share, 32 percent, while pension funds supplied just 15 percent. In 1979, the U.S. Department of Labor clarified its “prudent man\" rule in a way that explicitly allowed pension fund managers to invest in high-risk assets, including venture capital. Eight years later, when more than $\\$4$ billion was invested, pension funds accounted for more than half of all contributions.  \n\nWhen venture capital disbursements are divided by industry, about 60 percent in 1999 went to information technology industries, especially communications and networking, software, and information services. About 10 percent went into life sciences and medical companies, and the rest is spread over all other types of companies. When venture capital disbursements are viewed geographically, a little more than one-third of venture capital went to California. A little less than onethird went to Massachusetts, Texas, New York, New Jersey, Colorado, Pennsylvania, and Mllinois, combined. The remaining third was spread between the other 42 states. The concentration on high technology industries and in California and  \n\n![](images/ed0d0553ebac4f9c172b5ae1cda60c4e87c2a0fb612e6eaab1f9bc1b3ce2b38b.jpg)  \nFigure 2 Average Annual Rate of Return that Investors in U.s.

Source: Compiled from Venture Economics data.  \n\nMassachusetts has been a consistent feature of venture capital investments since at least the mid-1960s.4  \n\nThe past two decades have seen both very good and very trying times for venture capitalists. On the one hand, venture capitalists backed many of the most successful high-technology companies during the 1980s and 1990s, including Apple Computer, Cisco Systems, Genentech, Microsoft, Netscape, and Sun Microsystems. A substantial number of service firms (including Staples, Starbucks, and TCBY) also received venture financing.  \n\nAt the same time, commitments to the venture capital industry were very uneven. As Figure 1 shows, the annual flow of money into venture funds increased by a factor of ten during the early 1980s, peaking at just under $\\$6$ billion (in 1999 dollars). From 1987 through 1991, however, fundraising steadily declined. This fallback reflected the disappointment that many investors encountered with their investments. As Figure 2 shows, returns on venture capital funds declined in the mid-1980s, apparently because of overinvestment in various industries and the entry of inexperienced venture capitalists. As investors became disappointed with returns, they committed less capital to the industry.  \n\nThis pattern reversed dramatically in the 1990s, which saw rapid growth in venture fundraising. The explosion of activity in the market for initial public offerings and the exit of many inexperienced venture capitalists led to increasing venture capital returns. New capital commitments rose in response, increasing twenty-fold between 1991 and 2000. As Table 1 shows, much of the recent growth in fundraising was fueled by pension funds, whether those of private companies such as the General Motors Investment Management Company or public agencies like the California Public Employees Retirement System, many of which entered venture investing for the first time in a significant way. While previous investment surges have been associated with depressed venture capital returns, the most recent expansion in fundraising has seen a rise in the returns to venture funds.  \n\nCorporate investments in venture capital, whether investments in independent partnerships or direct investments in privately held firms, also increased substantially in the 1990s. While the late 1960s and mid-1980s had seen extensive corporate experimentation with venture funds, the late 1990s saw an unprecedented surge of activity. One reason is that the high degree of publicity associated with the successful venture investments of the period, such as eBay and Yahoo!, triggered the interest of many CEOs, who sought to harness some of the same energy in their organizations.  \n\nBut the substantial increase in corporate venture capital spending also reflected some more fundamental shifts as well. Many corporations were rethinking the way in which they managed the innovation process. Established mainline corporations that had relied on central R&D laboratories for new product ideas during most of the century were exploring alternatives, including joint ventures, acquisitions, and university-based collaborations. Managers and academics alike had realized that management difficulties led to corporations extracting only a small amount of the value from centralized R&D facilities. Many of the best ideas languished unused or were commercialized in new firms founded by defecting employees. A number of fast-growing technology firms such as Cisco Systems, which relied on acquisitions rather than internal R&D for the bulk of their new ideas, made it apparent that outside venture capital might be a practical alternative even a superior alternative-to an internal, centralized R&D process.6  \n\nThe growing diffusion of the Internet and an understanding of its implications also triggered the increasing corporate interest in venture capital. A wide range of media, service, and manufacturing firms realized the potential of the Internet to challenge their traditional ways of doing business—but they had few internal resources to address the new communications technology. A corporate venturing effort provided one way to grapple with these new technologies and their implications.  \n\nFinally, interest in corporate venturing programs was intensified by a growing receptiveness to corporate collaborations by independent venture capital groups.  \n\nTable1 Summary Statistics for Venture Capital Fund-raising by Independent Venture Partnerships   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>1979</td><td>1983</td><td>1987</td><td>1991</td><td>1995</td><td>1999a</td></tr><tr><td>Firstclosingoffunds</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Number offunds</td><td>27</td><td>147</td><td>112</td><td>34</td><td>84</td><td>204</td></tr><tr><td>Size (billions of 1999 $)</td><td>.53</td><td>6.01</td><td>5.93</td><td>1.69</td><td>4.60</td><td>37.46</td></tr><tr><td>Sources of funds</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Private pension funds</td><td>31%</td><td>26%</td><td>27%</td><td>25%</td><td>38%</td><td>9%</td></tr><tr><td>Public pension funds</td><td>b</td><td>5%</td><td>12%</td><td>17%</td><td>b</td><td>9%</td></tr><tr><td>Corporations</td><td>17%</td><td>12%</td><td>10%</td><td>4%</td><td>2%</td><td>16%</td></tr><tr><td>Individuals</td><td>23%</td><td>21%</td><td>12%</td><td>12%</td><td>17%</td><td>19%</td></tr><tr><td>Endowments</td><td>10%</td><td>8%</td><td>10%</td><td>24%</td><td>22%</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td>Insurance companies/banks</td><td>4%</td><td>12%</td><td>15%</td><td>6%</td><td>18%</td><td>11%</td></tr><tr><td>Foreign investors/other</td><td>15%</td><td>16%</td><td>14%</td><td>12%</td><td>3%</td><td>22%</td></tr><tr><td>Independentventurepartnershipsasashareof</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>thetotalventurepoolc</td><td></td><td>68%</td><td>78%</td><td>80%</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>\n\naIn 2000, there were 228 funds raised with total committed capital of $\\$67.7$ billion. bPublic pension funds are included with private pension funds in these years. cThis series is defined differently in different years. In some years, the Venture Capital Journal states that non-bank SBICs and publicly traded venture funds are included with independent venture partnerships. In other years, these funds are counted in other categories. It is not available for 1979 and after 1994. Source: Compiled from the unpublished Venture Economics funds database and various issues of the Venture Capital Journal. The numbers differ slightly from Lerner and Gompers (1996) due to continuing emendations to thefundsdatabase.  \n\nIn earlier years, corporate interest in venture capital had waxed and waned with seemingly little reason, and so traditional venture capital firms had been quite wary of entering into financial arrangements with corporate groups. But as the venture capital arena became increasingly crowded in the late 1990s, the venture community's attitudes began subtly changing. Relationships with corporations were increasingly seen as a source of differentiated competitive advantage. Venture groups were increasingly willing to consider working with these investors, not only accepting money from them as limited partners, but also in structuring various types of collaborations. For example, the venture capital firm Softbank set up a joint venture with K-Mart for the purpose of providing regular customers of the retailers with free Internet access, discounted shopping, and services from Yahoo! (a company in which Softbank was an early investor). The venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins set up the Java Fund as a mechanism for a variety of corporations interested in stimulating demand for software written in the Java language to invest in companies with potential new applications.  \n\nAlthough the limited partnership form continues to dominate the venture capital industry, the 1990s have also seen a revival of the publicly traded venture fund. This revival has occurred despite the troubled historical record noted above and the increasing severity with which the Securities and Exchange Commission sought to enforce regulatory provisions related to such funds. This renaissance has included the emergence of organizations that were pure venture funds, such as the Internet Capital Group, as well as hybrids that combined a venture fund with operating companies (for instance, CMGI put together under a single corporate umbrella a number of operating Internet business and a substantial venture capital fund, $@$ Ventures) and operating companies that included an “incubator” for new firms (examples include Idealab! and Divine InterVentures).  \n\nThe renewed appeal of public venture funds stemmed from the desire of individual investors to put some of their money into venture capital and the inaccessibility of traditional venture funds to these investors. More and more workers were managing their own savings in the form of 401(k) plans and other \"defined contribution\" plans. But for these investors, obtaining access to traditional venture funds was virtually impossible. Securities regulations restricted the funds to individuals who met stringent tests of “sophistication,” which were based on levels of net worth and income tests well beyond those of the average middle-class family. The venture capital firms, mindful of requirements that a limited partnership should not have too many investors, typically set minimum investment levels in the millions or tens of millions of dollars. Indeed, many of the most established funds did not accept any capital at all from new investors: there was sufficient demand from existing investors who had “grandfather rights\" to invest in subsequent funds. In the years to come, it is likely that increasing experimentation will seek to match medium-scale individual investors with venture funds.  \n\n## What We Know About Venture Capital Activity  \n\nTo understand the venture capital industry, one must understand the whole \"venture cycle.\" The venture capital cycle starts with raising a venture fund; proceeds through the investment in, monitoring of, and adding value to firms; continues as the venture capital firm exits successful deals and returns capital to its investors; and renews itself with the venture capitalist raising additional funds. The organization of this section mirrors this cycle, highlighting research that has been done on each topic.7  \n\n### Fundraising  \n\nCommitments to the venture capital industry have been highly variable over the past 30 years. One topic of continuing interest to researchers has been investigating the determinants of this variability.  \n\nThe impact of variations in the capital gains tax rate has received particular attention (for example, Poterba, 1987, 1989). The bulk of venture capital funds are from tax-exempt investors, who are not directly affected by a higher or lower capital gains tax rate. In regression analyses, however, Gompers and Lerner (1998b) find that lower capital gains taxes seem to have a particularly strong effect on the amount of venture capital supplied by these tax-exempt investors. The empirical results suggest that the impact of the capital gains tax does not arise through its effect on those supplying venture capital, but rather by spurring corporate employees to become entrepreneurs, leading to more demand for venture capital.  \n\nSome other factors already mentioned include regulatory changes such as the Department of Labor's shift in ERISA policies which eased investment restrictions in venture capital and recent past returns of venture funds (for more discussion, see Gompers and Lerner, 1998b).  \n\nBlack and Gilson (1998) argue that the health of the venture capital market depends fundamentally on a vibrant public market that allows new firms to issue shares. For example, few firms went public in the 1970s and very little venture capital was raised. The growth of the venture capital industry in the early 1980s, the decline in such fundraising in the late 1980s and the unprecedented growth in venture capital fundraising in the 1990s were matched by a rise, then a fall, and then a rise in initial public offering market activity.  \n\nA second major research question in this area focuses on whether an independent venture capital limited partnership has organizational advantages over the typical American corporation with dispersed shareholders ( Jensen, 1993; Porter, 1992). The key elements of the research inspired by these claims focus on understanding the conditions that govern the relationship between investors (limited partners) and the venture capitalist (general partner) during the fund's life and the incentives that these conditions create.  \n\nGompers and Lerner (1999a) examine the nature of venture capitalists’ incentive compensation in 419 venture partnership agreements and “offering memoranda\" for funds formed between 1978 and 1992. They find that compensation for older and larger venture capital organizations is more sensitive to performance than the compensation of other venture groups. For example, the oldest and largest venture groups command about a 1 percent greater share of the capital gains from their investment than do their less established counterparts. This greater profit share matters little if the fund is not successful, but can represent a 4 percent or greater increase in the net present value of total compensation if the fund is successful. These differences are statistically significant. Gompers and Lerner do not, however, find any relationship between the incentive compensation and the subsequent performance of the fund.  \n\nThe most plausible explanation for these empirical patterns appears to be a learning model in which neither the venture capitalist nor the investor initially knows the venture capitalist's ability. A venture capitalist who is just getting started will work hard even without explicit pay-for-performance incentives, because if the fund can establish a good reputation either for selecting attractive investments or adding value to firms in its portfolio, the venture capitalist will gain additional compensation in later funds. These reputation concerns lead to lower pay-forperformance for smaller and younger venture organizations, and explains the apparent lack of a relationship between incentive compensation and performance.  \n\nIn addition to the incentives provided by the high-powered compensation, covenants and restrictions that govern the relationship between investors and venture capitalists often play an important role in limiting conflicts. Such restrictions might include, for instance, prohibitions against the venture capitalists raising another fund until this fund is fully invested; investments in areas where the venture capitalist is not expert (for example, in securities of publicly traded firms); and investments in companies where one of the venture capitalists’ earlier funds had invested. A single limited partnership agreement governs the relationship between the limited and general partners over the fund's life of a decade or more. Unlike other agreements, like employment contracts or strategic alliances, these contracts are rarely renegotiated.  \n\nGompers and Lerner (1996) examine a sample of 140 executed partnership agreements from a major endowment and two investment managers that select venture capital investments for pension funds and other institutional investors. The evidence illustrates the importance of general market conditions on the restrictiveness of venture capital limited partnerships. Fewer restrictions are found in funds established during years with greater inflows of new capital, funds in which limited partners do not employ investment managers, and funds where general partners enjoy higher levels of compensation. Thus, in settings when venture capitalists have relatively more bargaining power, the venture capitalists are able to raise money with fewer strings attached.  \n\nThis research has given us a better understanding of how venture capitalists differ from corporations. For instance, corporate middle managers are very unlikely to receive a substantial share of the wealth that the innovations they champion produce. Similarly, corporations do not face the discipline of needing to return their capital to shareholders and to finance new projects through the raising of additional funds. This research, however, can shed only limited light on the relative strength of the venture capital organization as a mechanism for funding innovation. We will revisit that issue later in this paper.  \n\n### Venture Investing  \n\nA lengthy literature has discussed the financing of young firms. Uncertainty and informational asymmetries often characterize young firms, particularly in high-technology industries. If the firm raises equity from outside investors, the manager has an incentive to engage in wasteful expenditures (like lavish offices) because the manager may benefit disproportionately from these but does not bear their entire cost. Similarly, if the firm raises debt, the manager may increase risk to undesirable levels ( Jensen and Meckling, 1976). If all the outcomes of the entrepreneurial firm cannot be foreseen, and effort of the entrepreneur cannot be ascertained with complete confidence, it may be difficult to write a contract governing the financing of the firm (Grossman and Hart, 1986; Hart and Moore, 1998).  \n\nThese problems are especially difficult for companies with intangible assets and whose performance is difficult to assess, such as early stage, high technology companies with a heavy reliance on R&D.\\* Entrepreneurs might invest in strategies, research, or projects that have high personal returns but low expected monetary payoffs to shareholders. For example, a biotechnology company founder may invest in a certain type of research that brings great personal recognition in the scientific community, but provides little return for the investor. Entrepreneurs may receive initial results from market trials indicating little demand for a new product, but may want to keep the company going because they receive significant private benefits from managing their own firm. In addition, entrepreneurs have incentives to pursue highly volatile strategies, such as rushing a product to market when further testing may be warranted, because they benefit from success but do not actually suffer losses from failure. As a result, external financing for these firms is costly or difficult to obtain.  \n\nSpecialized financial intermediaries, such as venture capital organizations, can alleviate these information gaps and thus allow firms to receive the financing that they cannot raise from other sources. The tools that venture capital firms have to address these information issues are to scrutinize firms intensively before providing capital and then to monitor them afterwards. The monitoring and information tools of venture capitalists include: meting out financing in discrete stages over time; syndicating investments with other venture capital firms; taking seats on a firm's board of directors; and compensation arrangements including stock options. A number of studies have investigated how venture capitalists employ these tools.  \n\nStaged capital infusion may be the most potent control mechanism a venture capitalist can employ (Sahlman, 1990). Staged capital infusion keeps the owner/ manager on a “tight leash\" and reduces potential losses from bad decisions. The venture capitalist can increase the duration of funding and reduce the frequency of reevaluation as the company becomes better established and conflicts with the entrepreneur appear more likely.  \n\nGompers (1995) uses a random sample of 794 venture capital-financed companies to examine how venture capitalists use staged infusions of capital and other types of monitoring. In fact, venture capitalists do concentrate investments in early-stage companies and high technology industries where informational asymmetries are likely to be most significant and monitoring most valuable. When venture capitalists learn negative information about future returns, the project is cut off from new financing. Firms that go public (these firms yield the highest return for venture capitalists on average) receive more total financing and a greater number of rounds than other firms (which may go bankrupt, be acquired, or remain private). Early-stage firms receive significantly less money per round. Increases in asset tangibility increase financing duration and reduce monitoring intensity. As the role of future investment opportunities in firm value increases (as measured by higher market value-to-book value ratios or R&D intensities), firms are refinanced more frequently.9  \n\nIn addition to the staged capital infusions, a venture capitalist who originates a deal will often look to bring in other venture capital firms. This syndication serves multiple purposes. By syndicating investments, each venture capital firm can invest in more projects and largely diversify away firm-specific risk. Involving other venture firms also provides as a second (and third and fourth) opinion on the investment opportunity, which limits the danger that bad deals will get funded.  \n\nLerner (1994a) tests this “second opinion\" hypothesis in a sample of 271 biotechnology venture capital investments. He finds that in the early rounds of investing, experienced venture capitalists tend to syndicate only with venture capital firms that have similar experience. This finding supports the second opinion hypothesis, since a venture capitalist looking for a second opinion would want to get a second opinion from a firm of similar (or better) ability, rather than just looking for money from any other firm.  \n\nThe advice and support provided by venture capitalists is often embodied by their role on the firm's board of directors. In keeping with the approach of Fama and Jensen (1983) and Williamson (1983), who hypothesize that the composition of the board should be shaped by the need for oversight, Lerner (1995) examines whether the representation of venture capitalists on the boards of the private firms in their portfolios is greater when the need for oversight is larger. Specifically, Lerner examines changes in board membership around the time that a firm's chief executive officer is replaced, since the replacement of the top manager at an entrepreneurial firm is likely to coincide with an organizational crisis and to heighten the need for monitoring (Hermalin and Weisbach, 1988). Lerner finds that an average of 1.75 venture capitalists are added to the board between financing rounds when the firm's chief executive officer is replaced in the interval; between other rounds, 0.24 venture directors are added. No differences are found in the addition of other outside directors.  \n\nLerner (1995) also finds evidence that board service is driven by a need to provide monitoring, showing that geographic proximity is an important determinant of venture board membership. Organizations with offices within five miles of the firm's headquarters are twice as likely to be board members as those more than 500 miles distant. Over half the firms in his sample have a venture director with an office within 60 miles of their headquarters. The transaction costs associated with frequent visits and intensive involvement are likely to be reduced if the venture capitalist is geographically nearby.  \n\nYet another mechanism utilized by venture capitalists to influence managers and critical employees is to have them receive a substantial fraction of their compensation in the form of equity or options, which tends to align the interests of employees and investors. Baker and Gompers (20o0) find that fixed salaries are lower and the size of the equity stake held is higher for venture capital-backed chief executive officers, when compared to similar companies not financed by venture capital.  \n\nThe venture capitalist also employs additional controls on compensation. For example, they usually require vesting of the stock or options over a multiyear period, so that the entrepreneur cannot leave the firm and take his shares. Similarly, the venture capitalist can significantly dilute the entrepreneur's stake in subsequent financings if the firm fails to realize its targets. This means that an entrepreneur who wishes to maintain the relative size of the personal stake in the firm will need to meet the agreed-upon targets.  \n\nUntil this point, this section has highlighted the ways in which venture capitalists can address agency problems. The argument is often made by venture capital practitioners, however, that the quality of the investment process changes with the amount of money flowing into the industry.  \n\nWhen a surge of money enters the venture capital industry, but there are only a certain number of worthy projects to finance, the result can be a substantial decline in the returns on investment in the industry. The phrase “too much money chasing too few deals\" is a common refrain in the venture capital market during periods of rapid growth. Sahlman and Stevenson (1987) describe this situation arising in the disk drive industry in the early 1980s,1° and similar stories are often told concerning investments in software, biotechnology, and the Internet.  \n\nGompers and Lerner (20oo) examine these claims through a dataset of over 4000 venture investments between 1987 and 1995 developed by the consulting firm VentureOne. They examine the effect of the inflow of funds into the venture capital industry on the valuations that venture capitalists paid when investing in young firms. They control for various firm attributes that might affect firm valuation, including firm age, stage of development, industry, public market values for firms in the same industries, and average book-to-market and earnings-to-price ratios. While other variables also have significant explanatory power—for instance, the marginal impact of a doubling in public market values was between a 15 and 35 percent increase in the valuation of private equity transactions—the inflows variable is significantly positive. A doubling of inflows into venture funds leads to between a 7 and 21 percent increase in valuation levels.  \n\nThe results are particularly strong for specific types of funds and funds in particular regions. Because funds have become larger in real dollar terms, with more capital per partner, many venture capital organizations have invested larger amounts of money in each portfolio company. Firms have attempted to do this in two ways. First, there has been a movement to finance later-stage companies that can accept larger blocks of financing. Second, venture firms are syndicating less.  \n\n![](images/0fe17dad1cdbebfa6f768343c62d77d2bfbfb96219e5668c6fbb4a992e391288.jpg)  \nFigure 3 Number of Venture-backed IPOs and Total Number of IPOs by Year in the United States   \nSources: Barry et al. (1990), Ritter (1998), and various issues of Going Public: The IPO Reporter and the VentureCapitalJournal.  \n\nThis leads to greater competition for making later-stage investments. Similarly, because the majority of money is raised in California and Massachusetts, competition for deals in these regions has been particularly intense and venture capital inflows have had a more dramatic effect on prices in those regions.  \n\nGompers and Lerner (2000) is based on data only through the mid-1990s, but it seems unlikely that adding data through the end of the 1990s would alter the conclusion that inflows of venture capital tend to raise valuations. After all, in the late 1990s, a surge of money into venture capital funds was accompanied by lofty valuations. In the past, overinvestment by venture capitalists led to too many projects at too high valuations resulted in low returns. Indeed, one reason for the very low returns of venture capital funds from about 1985 to 1990 (as shown in Figure 2) is that the surge of venture capital funds at this time (shown in Figure 1) exceeded the productive projects to be financed. The next few years will show whether information technology companies can absorb very large increases in venture capital from 1998 to 2000, or whether the inflow of venture funds has overwhelmed the number of profitable opportunities.11  \n\n![](images/43cf161ca85a2f8a0ad5b141e25b20bc15a0674cad8571d5c4895ea5bedc67b0.jpg)  \nFigure 4 Dollar Volume of Venture-backed IPOs and All IPOs By Year in the United States   \nSources: Barry et al. (1990), Ritter (1998), and various issues of Going Public: The IPO Reporter and the VentureCapitalJournal.  \n\n### Exiting Venture Capital Investments  \n\nTo make money on their investments, venture capitalists need to turn illiquid stakes in private companies into realized return. Typically, the most profitable exit opportunity is an initial public offering, in which the company issues shares to the public.  \n\nFigures 3 and 4 summarize the trends in initial public offerings, both those that originated in venture capital investments and others. The proportion of all initial public offerings that are backed by venture capitalists rose from under 10 percent in the 1980s to about 31 percent in the 1990s-and a remarkable 56 percent in 1999. Interestingly, the share of money raised by initial public offerings that are backed by venture capital has not increased as much. Although the share jumps around a lot, about 17 percent of all funds raised by initial public offerings in the 1980s went to just under 20 percent in the 1990s—and almost all of this increase can be traced to the very large amount of venture-backed initial public offerings in 1999.  \n\nInitial empirical research in this area focused on the structure of venturebacked initial public offerings. Barry, Muscarella, Peavy and Vetsuypens (1990) established a broad array of facts about the role of venture capitalists in initial public offerings, using a sample of 433 venture-backed and 1123 non-venture initial public offerings between 1978 and 1987. They document that venture capitalists hold significant equity stakes in the firms they take public (on average, the lead venture capitalist holds a 19 percent stake immediately prior to the initial public offering, and all venture investors hold 34 percent), and control about one-third of the board seats. They continue to hold their equity positions in the year after the initial public offering. Unlike non-venture initial public offerings, the typical venture-backed offering is not yet profitable at the time it goes public. Finally, venture-backed initial public offerings have less of a positive return on their first trading day. The authors suggest that this implies that investors need less of a discount to purchase these shares (that is, the offerings are less “underpriced\"), because the venture capitalist has monitored the quality of the offering.  \n\nMegginson and Weiss (1991) argue that because venture capitalists repeatedly bring firms to the public market, they can credibly stake their reputation that the firms they bring to market are not overvalued. They test this idea using a matched set of 640 venture-backed and non-venture initial public offerings between 1983 and 1987. They confirm the finding that the underpricing of venture capitalbacked initial public offerings is significantly less than the underpricing of nonventure initial public offerings. Some of their other findings offer an explanation for this pattern. For example, they show that the underwriters of venture-backed firms are significantly more experienced than the underwriters of comparable non-venture offerings. Venture-backed initial public offerings have significantly lower fees than non-venture initial public offerings. Venture capitalists also retain a majority of their equity after the initial public offering, which serves as a commitment device. These factors help to explain yet another of their findings, that institutional investors-who may be presumed to be especially knowledgeable— have larger holdings of venture-backed firms after the initial public offering than they do of comparable non-venture companies.  \n\nMore recent research in this area has examined the timing of the venture capitalist's decision to take firms public and the timing of the decision to liquidate the venture capitalists’ holdings, which frequently occurs well after the initial public offering.  \n\nSeveral potential factors affect when venture capitalists choose to bring firms public. One of these is the relative valuation of publicly traded securities. Lerner (1994b) examines when venture capitalists choose to finance a sample of 350 privately held venture-backed biotechnology companies with another private round versus taking the firm public. He shows that the venture capitalists take firms public at market peaks, relying on private financings when valuations are lower. Seasoned venture capitalists appear more proficient at timing initial public offerings. The results are robust to the use of alternative criteria to separate firms and to the addition of controls for the firms’ quality.  \n\nThe superior timing ability of established venture capitalists may be in part due to the fact that they have more flexibility as to when to take companies public. Less-established groups may be influenced in this decision by other considerations. For instance, Gompers (1996) argues that young venture capital firms have incentives to “grandstand\": that is, they take actions that signal their ability to potential investors. Specifically, young venture capital firms bring companies public earlier than older venture capital firms in an effort to establish a reputation and raise capital for new funds. He examines a sample of 433 venture-backed initial public offerings between 1978 and 1987, as well as a second sample consisting of the first initial public offerings brought to market by 62 venture capital funds. Young venture capital firms have been on the initial public offering company's board of directors 14 months less and hold smaller percentage equity stakes at the time of initial public ofering than the more established venture firms. The initial public offering companies that they finance are nearly two years younger and more underpriced when they go public than the companies backed by older venture capital firms. Rushing companies to the initial public offering market, however, imposes costs on the venture firm: a shorter duration of board representation is associated with a greater degree of underpricing and a lower percentage equity stake for the venture capitalist.  \n\nThe typical venture capital firm does not sell its equity at the time of the initial public offering, since this would send a negative signal to the market that the insiders are “cashing out.\" Indeed, most investment banks require that all insiders, including the venture capitalists, do not sell any of their equity after the offering for a pre-specified period, usually six months (Brav and Gompers, 2000). Once that lock-up period is over, venture capitalists can return money to investors either by selling shares on the open market and paying the proceeds to investors in cash or by making distributions of shares to investors in the venture capital fund.  \n\nThese distributions to investors have several features that make them an interesting testing ground for an examination of the impact of transactions by informed insiders on securities prices. Because they are not considered to be \"sales,” the distributions are exempt from the anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions of the securities laws. In addition, transactions are not revealed publicly at the time of the transaction. To identify the precise date of these transactions, one needs to rely on the records of the partners in the fund.  \n\nGompers and Lerner (1998a) construct a representative set of over 700 transactions by 135 funds over a decade-long period, based on the records of four institutional investors. The results are consistent with venture capitalists possessing inside information and of the (partial) adjustment of the market to that information. As depicted in Figure 5, after significant increases in stock prices prior to distribution, abnormal returns immediately after the distribution are a negative and significant -2.0 percent, which is comparable to the market reaction to publicly announced secondary stock sales. The cumulative excess returns for the months following the distribution are negative, but the significance of the long-run returns is sensitive to the benchmark used. Moreover, distributions that occur in settings where information asymmetries may be greatest—especially where the firm has been taken public by a lower-tier underwriter and the distribution is soon after the initial public offering—-have larger immediate price declines.  \n\n![](images/ea33d0d34452b372218c42f1f91f1d77b704cd04f0b2c0cebf0cd02b0cb413aa.jpg)  \nFigure5 Stock Price around Distribution of Equity by Venture Capitalists   \nNote: The graph plots the cumulative abnormal return from 60 days prior to distribution to 60 days after distribution by U.S. venture capital funds. Source: Gompers and Lerner (1998a).  \n\nMany institutional investors have received a flood of these venture capital distributions during the past several years and have grown increasingly concerned about the incentives of the venture capitalists when they declare these transfers. The evidence on a run-up of returns before the distribution and decline after the distribution suggests that they are right to be concerned.  \n\n## What We Don't Know About Venture Capital  \n\nWhile financial economists know much more about venture capital than they did a decade ago, many unresolved issues would reward future research. In this final section, we highlight three of these issues.  \n\n### Understanding Risk and Return  \n\nMany institutions, like public and private pension funds, have increased their allocation to venture capital and private equity in the belief that the returns of these funds are largely uncorrelated with the public markets. It is natural to see how they reached this conclusion. Firms receiving capital from venture capital funds often remain privately held for a number of years after the initial investment. These firms have no observable market price. To present a conservative assessment of the portfolio valuation, venture capitalists often refrain from marking portfolio firm values to market, preferring to maintain the investments at book value until the company goes public. Thus, reported returns during years with many initial public offerings are biased upwards: had the portfolio been marked to market, many of  \n\nthe gains would have been realized in the years before the initial public offering.   \nSimilarly, returns in years with few initial public offerings are biased downwards.  \n\nBut the accounting practice of using unvarying book values, of course, does not demonstrate that the market value of these investments is uncorrelated with the stock market. As discussed throughout this analysis, there appear to be many linkages between the public and private equity market values. Thus, the stated returns of venture capital funds may not accurately reflect the true evolution of value, and the correlations reported by Venture Economics (2ooo) and other industry observers may be deceptively low. In a preliminary analysis using data from one venture group, Gompers and Lerner (1997) find that the correlation between venture capital and public market prices increases substantially when the underlying venture portfolio is “marked-to-market.\" An alternative approach is to examine the relatively modest number of publicly traded venture capital funds, as is done by Martin and Petty (1983). These authors showed that eleven publicly traded funds had superior returns relative to the market during the years 1974 through 1979 (a period of strong returns to the venture capital industry as a whole, as Figure 2 notes).  \n\nTo ignore the true correlation may lead to incorrect investment decisions. This inaccuracy may only have been a modest problem when venture capital was only a minute fraction of most institutions’ portfolios. Today, endowments and pension funds are allocating 10 percent, 20 percent, or even 50 percent of their portfolios to illiquid investments such as venture capital. Not to think carefully about the risk and reward profile of venture capital is thus fraught with potential dangers.  \n\n### The Internationalization of Venture Capital  \n\nUntil very recently, there has been little venture capital activity abroad. For instance, in 1996, the U.s. venture capital pool was about three times larger than the total venture capital pool in 21 other high-income nations ( Jeng and Wells, 2000). Moreover, about 70 percent of the venture capital in the rest of the world was in three countries with especially strong ties to the U.s. economy: Israel, Canada, and Netherlands.12 This pattern raised questions of why such differences existed, and whether they were permanent.  \n\nBlack and Gilson (1998) argue that the key source of the U.s. competitive advantage in venture capital is the existence of a robust market for initial public offerings. Because of this market, venture capitalists can commit to transfer control back to the entrepreneur when a public equity market for new issues exists. They point out that this commitment device is unavailable in economies dominated by bank financing, such as Germany and Japan.  \n\nThis argument, however, has diminished in credibility in the past two years. There has been a surge in venture capital investment, particularly relating to the Internet, in a wide variety of nations across Asia, Europe, and Latin America. While local groups (many recently established) have made some of these investments, much of the activities have been driven by U.s.-based organizations.  \n\nIn a pioneering study, Jeng and Wells (2ooo) examine the factors that influence venture capital fundraising internationally. They find that the strength of the initial public offering market is an important factor in the determinant of venture capital commitments, echoing the conclusions of Black and Gilson (1998). Jeng and Wells also find, however, that the initial public offering market does not seem to influence commitments to early-stage funds as much as later-stage ones. Another provocative finding from the Jeng and Wells analysis is that government policy can have a dramatic impact on the current and long-term viability of the venture capital sector. In many countries of continental Europe, entrepreneurs face numerous daunting regulatory restrictions, a paucity of venture funds focusing on investing in high-growth firms, and illiquid markets where investors do not welcome initial public offerings by young firms without long histories of positive earnings.  \n\nMany nations are interested in encouraging greater venture capital investment, but only very recently have researchers begun to examine the ways in which policymakers can catalyze the growth of venture capital and the companies in which they invest. The recent initiatives along these lines undertaken both in the United States and abroad are summarized in Lerner (1999) and Gompers and Lerner (1999b). (Other analyses are in Irwin and Klenow, 1996, and Wallsten, 2000.) But while this work represents an important initial step, much more remains to be explored regarding the impact of government on venture capital and the extent to which these actions can explain or change the international patterns of venture capital.  \n\n### The Real Effects of Venture Capital  \n\nMany policymakers have a perception that venture capital organizations have had much to do with the rising leadership of U.s. frms in high-technology industries (which can be measured through patent counts or more qualitative measures). But demonstrating a causal relationship between the presence of venture capital investment and innovation or job growth is a challenging empirical problem.  \n\nFor example, one straightforward approach is to look at regressions across industries and time and examine whether, controlling for other potentially important factors like the level of R&D spending, venture capital funding has an impact on the number of patents or other measures of innovation. But this approach is quite likely to give misleading estimates. Both venture funding and patenting could be positively related to a third unobserved factor—the arrival of technological opportunities. To date, only two papers have attempted to address these challenging estimation issues.  \n\nIn the first of these papers, Hellmann and Puri (2000) distributed a questionnaire to a sample of 170 firms in Silicon Valley, including both venture-backed and nonventure firms. They find that firms pursuing what they term an “innovator strategy” (a classification based on the content analysis of survey responses) are significantly more likely to obtain venture capital, and to receive such financing at a younger age. The presence of a venture capitalist is also associated with a significant reduction in the time taken to bring a product to market, especially for innovators. Further, innovators are more likely to list obtaining venture capital as a significant milestone in the life cycle of the company, as compared to other financing events. Their results suggest that venture capital may be especially important for innovative companies. They devote only modest attention, however, to concerns about causality: the possibility remains that more innovative firms select venture capital for financing, rather than venture capital causing firms to be more innovative. Furthermore, the small size and concentrated location of the sample, as well as the sampling procedure employed, raise concerns about the generality of the results.  \n\nKortum and Lerner (2ooo) examine whether these patterns can be discerned on an aggregate industry level, rather than on the firm level. They address concerns about causality in two ways. First, they focus on the surge of venture capital funds that occurred after 1978, when the U.s. Department of Labor freed pensions to invest in venture capital. This change in venture capital funding is unlikely to be related to the arrival of entrepreneurial opportunities and so can be taken as exogenous. As a second approach, they estimate the impact of venture capital on the ratio of patents to R&D spending, rather than on patenting itself. In a simple model, they show that dividing by R&D spending acts as a control for the arrival of technological opportunities that are anticipated by economic actors at the time.  \n\nAfter addressing these causality concerns, the results suggest that venture funding does have a strong positive impact on innovation. The estimated coefficients vary according to the techniques employed, but on average, a dollar of venture capital appears to be three to four times more potent in stimulating patenting than a dollar of traditional corporate R&D. The estimates therefore suggest that venture capital, even though it averaged less than 3 percent of corporate R&D from 1983 to 1992, is responsible for perhaps 10 percent of U.s. industrial innovations in this decade.  \n\nUltimately, the goal must be to see the role that venture capital plays in an economy's overall process of innovation. For example, as venture capital funding has increased in recent years, central R&D facilities of large corporations have also been redirected toward more applied problems. Determining the extent to which these changes are related, and how both are related to other R&D management innovations, is worthy of further investigation.  \n\n## Wrapping Up  \n\nEmpirical research into the venture capital industry has made considerable strides over the past decade. The manners in which venture capital funds are raised and structured, the capital is invested in young firms, and these investments are concluded are now much better understood.  \n\nBut at the same time, much remains to be learned. In some cases, the unanswered questions have been posed for years, but lack of access to data has proved to be a major barrier. For instance, confidentiality concerns have made a thorough understanding the risk and reward characteristics of venture capital elusive. In other cases, new research questions have been posed by the recent rapid changes in the venture capital industry. For example, the impact of the dramatic growth in the industry over the past two decades on venture capital organizations and the high-technology companies they fund remain quite uncertain. These and other questions should reward research in the years to come.  \n\n■ This article is based in part on Gompers and Lerner (1999c, 2001).

Following the staggered adoption of the inevitable disclosure doctrine that restricts labor mobility, VCs are less likely to invest in affected states. This effect is more pronounced when human capital is more important to startups, when VC investment is more uncertain, and when VCs’ monitoring costs are higher. The reduced innovation productivity of employees is a plausible underlying mechanism. To mitigate this adverse effect, VCs stage finance startups more and syndicate more with other VCs. Our paper sheds new light on the real effects of labor market frictions.  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nHow does the human capital of startups affect the investment propensity and outcomes of venture capital (VC) firms? As emphasized in Zingales (2000), “human capital is emerging as the most crucial asset' in today's world. Human capital is crucial for a firm because employees possess intimate knowledge of the firm's operations, of its trade secrets, and, in particular, of its innovation. This knowledge is lost when employees leave a firm (Hall and Lerner (2010)). Therefore, it is important to understand how the human capital of startups affects VC investment.  \n\nVCs have been an essential ingredient of the private market and have contributed significantly to the rapid development of US economic growth, entrepreneurship, and technological innovation in the past several decades.1 Although numerous studies have explored how a variety of VC investors? characteristics (e.g., industry expertise, reputation, experience, network connections, etc.) affect their investment in startups, little attention has been given to how the human capital embedded in startups affects VC investment. Studies by Hellmann and Puri (2000) and by Chemmanur, Simonyan, and Tehranian (2016) have explored other aspects of startups? human capital. In their study of 170 high-tech startups in Silicon Valley, Hellmann and Puri (2000) find that VCs help professionalize startup management teams. Chemmanur et al. (2016) show that VC financing is associated with higher-quality startup management teams. These papers, however, do not explore how VC investment is influenced by startup human capital or, in particular, by the mobility of human capital. In this paper, we fill this gap in the existing literature and explore how labor mobility affects VC investment.  \n\nA major challenge for our empirical analyses is the likely endogeneity of labor mobility to VC investment. Thus, a correlation between labor mobility and VC investment may tell us little about the causal effect of labor mobility on VC investment. We alleviate endogeneity concerns by exploiting the staggered adoption of the inevitable disclosure doctrine (IDD) by US state courts; this doctrine prevents a firm's employees who have knowledge of the firm's trade secrets from working for another firm, and hence creates plausibly exogenous variations in the mobility of a startup's labor. IDD is a stronger restriction than non-compete or non-disclosure agreements because it can be applied to a broader geographical area and is applicable even in cases where the employee has not signed a non-compete or nondisclosure agreement with the firm. In addition, the variation generated by the IDD represents multiple shocks that affect labor mobility (and hence startups) in different states at different times. We thus avoid a common  \n\nidentification difficulty of studies that use a single shock-—namely, the existence of potential omitted variables coinciding with a shock that directly affects VC investment.2  \n\nWe propose two competing hypotheses regarding the effect of labor mobility restrictions on VC investment and outcomes. Our first hypothesis, the talent retention hypothesis, argues that restricting the labor mobility of startups encourages VC investment because the restriction retains talent and thus makes startups more competitive and more attractive to VC investors. Our second hypothesis, the talent distortion hypothesis, predicts that labor mobility restrictions could impede VC investment for two reasons. First, reduced labor mobility makes it more difficult for startups to recruit the necessary talent from outside. Second, labor mobility restrictions reduce existing employees? incentives to work hard (Fulghieri and Sevilir (2011). Detailed discussions of hypothesis development are in Section III.  \n\nWe first examine directly whether the adoption of the IDD indeed reduces labor mobility. We focus on the mobility of startups’ key employees, i.e., inventors. Inventors are the producers of a startup's innovation output, which is crucial to the startup's survival and growth. Given that a substantial fraction of patentable inventions are not patented and remain trade secrets (Mansfield (1986), Anton and Yao (2004)), inventors may possess important trade secrets of the startups and are thereby restricted from moving because of the IDD. We find that, following IDD adoption, the mobility of inventors is significantly reduced both within a state and across states.  \n\nWe then undertake our baseline regressions that examine the effect of the IDD on VC investment propensity. Our baseline results show that, following adoption of the IDD, there is a $2\\%$ unconditional drop in the likelihood of VC investment; this represents $15\\%$ of the average investment likelihood.3 The evidence is consistent with the talent distortion hypothesis. To ensure that the parallel trends assumption of the difference-in-differences approach is satisfied, we follow Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003) and examine the dynamics of VC investments surrounding the adoption and rejection of the IDD. We find no prior trend in VC investment in the pre-IDD era and the results become significant only after IDD adoptions.  \n\nTo further strengthen the causal link, we next examine how our baseline results vary in the cross section. If labor mobility restrictions reduce the likelihood of VC investment through increased talent distortions, we expect to observe that our baseline results are more pronounced in more innovative industries in which human capital is particularly important, in early-stage VC investment when investment uncertainty is especially high, and in “long-distance” investment in which VC monitoring costs are particularly high. These are indeed what we find. Our crosssectional tests lend further credence to the negative, causal effect of labor mobility on VC investment likelihood and support the talent distortion hypothesis.  \n\nWe then explore plausible mechanisms through which the IDD affects the likelihood of VC investment. We conjecture that the reduction in employees? innovation productivity might be a plausible underlying mechanism. Consistent with our view, we find a reduction in patent counts and in patent citations at both the inventor-year level and the startup-year level following IDD adoptions. To explain the reduction in patenting activities, we explore two plausible reasons. We term these the incentive channel and the knowledge spillover channel. Under the incentive channel, inventors are incentivized to produce innovation output to signal their quality to the external labor market; this incentive is reduced by the passage of the IDD, which restricts  \n\ninventors? mobility to rival companies. If the incentive channel is supported, the productivity of inventors in industries with higher labor mobility should be hurt more by the passage of the IDD; we find evidence consistent with this conjecture. Under the knowledge spillover channel, the IDD reduces patenting activities because it restricts the idea recombination that comes from the moves of inventors. If the knowledge spillover channel is supported, we should observe that the effect of the IDD is more pronounced in industries with higher knowledge spillovers. We, however, do not find consistent evidence that supports the knowledge spillover channel.  \n\nNext, we examine whether VCs are able to counter the perceived adverse effects of restricted labor mobility on startups by adjusting their investment strategies.4 We focus on two important VC investment strategies: staging and syndication. Staging refers to the stepwise capital infusions from VCs to startups and has been well documented as an effective way to mitigate agency problems (Gompers (1995), Tian (2011). According to the real options theory, VCs stage their financing of startups to reduce investment uncertainty (Sahlman (1988), (1990)); this is an effective tool for mitigating agency problems and for keeping entrepreneurs on a tight leash, which helps overcome talent distortions (Sahlman (1990), Gompers (1995). Syndication refers to the cooperation among VCs when they invest in startups and is an enduring and distinct feature of the VC industry (Lerner (1994), Tian (2012), Gompers, Mukharlyamov, and Xuan (2016), and Tian, Udell, and Yu (2016)). Syndication allows VCs to seek a second opinion from other VCs about the startups, to peer monitor, and to share the risk—especially that of possible talent distortions associated with startups-with other VCs (e.g., Lerner (1994), Brander, Amit, and Antweiler (2002), and Bayar et al. (2020). Therefore, if the restriction of labor mobility  \n\nleads to talent distortions, VCs could mitigate the adverse effect by intensifying staging and engaging more in syndication. Consistent with our conjecture, we find that VCs increase their staging efforts and are more likely to co-invest with other VCs in startups following the adoption Of theIDD.  \n\nGiven that VCs adjust their staging and syndication strategies in response to the IDD, it is interesting to examine a “bottom line” question, i.e., whether VCs are able to reduce the adverse effects of labor mobility restrictions. We investigate the question by looking into VCs' investment outcomes. Following the literature, we measure VCs’ successful investment outcomes by IPOs and by acquisitions of VC-backed startups (see Da Rin, Hellman, and Puri (2013) for a discussion). We find the restriction of labor mobility leads to fewer successful exits, especially in terms of IPOs. This finding suggests that, while VCs increase both stage financing and syndication with other VCs, they still cannot completely eliminate the negative effect of restricted labor mobility. Consistently, we find that VCs tilt their portfolios to states without the IDD.  \n\nFinally, it is worth noting that our sample includes only startups that have received funding from at least one VC investor. Our analysis does not include startups that have never received funding from any VCs. Therefore, our study examines whether the IDD affects investment decisions in all “infra-marginal’ startups, excluding any effect that the IDD may have on the marginal startups. It is possible that the IDD reduces entrepreneurship. We show that startups are less likely to receive subsequent-round financing from VCs after the passage of the IDD. We further show that VCs shift their investment away from states that passed the IDD; this could lead to a reduction in entrepreneurship. These results are consistent with the talent distortion hypothesis.  \n\nThe rest of the paper proceeds as follows: Section I reviews the literature. Section III describes the institutional background of the IDD and develops the hypotheses. Section IV reports data and summary statistics. Section V presents our main empirical results. Section VI concludes.  \n\n## I1. Literature Review  \n\nOur paper contributes mainly to three strands of the literature. First, it contributes to the literature on VC investment. Prior research has studied how a variety of VC investor characteristics—such as industry expertise, reputation, past experience, and network connections—-as well as startup characteristics affect VCs’ investment in startups and eventually affect the public market. (See Da Rin et al. (2013) for a survey of the literature.) Regarding the human capital of startups, Hellmann and Puri (2000), in their study of 170 high-tech startups in Silicon Valley, find that VCs help professionalize startup management teams. Chemmanur et al. (2016) find that VC financing is associated with higher-quality startup management teams. Amornsiripanitch, Gompers, and Xuan (2019) find that successful and well-connected venture capitalists play an important role in recruiting managers and outside board members for portfolio companies; this finding is consistent with that of Ewens and Marx (2018) who provide evidence that VCs improve the performance of their portfolio firms by replacing founders. Gompers et al. (2016) show that VCs who share the same ethnic, education, or career background are more likely to syndicate with each other, but this kind of collaboration tends to perform poorly. Our study complements the existing literature by exploring how labor mobility affects VC investment likelihood, investment strategy, and investment outcomes.  \n\nSecond, this paper is related to the studies of non-compete agreements and labor mobility in general. For example, Garmaise (2011) shows that increased non-compete agreements lead to executive stability and reduction in firm investment per employee. Samila and Sorenson (2011) document the enforcement of non-compete agreements as impeding entrepreneurship and reducing patenting activities. Using Michigan data and the auto-manufacturing-industry setting, Marx, Strumsky, and Fleming (2009) present direct evidence that non-compete agreements lead to a reduction in labor mobility. Jeffers (2019) shows that greater enforceability of non-compete agreements leads to a substantial decline in employee departures, especially in knowledgeintensive occupations, and reduces new firm entry in corresponding sectors. Given that an IDD is applicable regardless of whether an employee signs a non-compete agreement, our finding that there is a lower likelihood for startups to receive VC funding following adoption of the IDD is generally consistent with that of Jeffers (2019). We take a further step by showing the response of VCs to the IDD in adjusting their investment strategy and the outcomes of VC-backed startups in terms of successful exits.  \n\nThird, this paper is related to recent studies that explore the relation between labor mobility and economic dynamism. Klasa et al. (2018) show that firms increase their financial leverage following a state's adoption of the IDD. Chen, Gao, and Ma (forthcoming) find that, when labor mobility is restricted, US firms are more likely to be acquired. Contigiani, Hsu, and Barankay (2018) show that strengthening employer-friendly trade secret protection adversely affects innovation. Ouimet and Zarutskie (2016) find that some mergers and acquisitions (M&As) are motivated by acquirers? incentives to acquire and retain the key talents of target firms. Qiu and Wang (2018) show that the adoption of the IDD leads to positive stock market reactions. By using VC investment amounts aggregated at the state level, Castellaneta et al.  \n\n(2016) find that the IDD affects VC financing. Our paper contributes to this literature by showing the economic consequences of restricting labor mobility in the VC setting.  \n\nIt is worth noting that our results are different from those of Castellaneta et al. (2016) because we take startups? demand for VCs into consideration by creating hypothetical VCstartup pairs. While overall VC investment could increase after the passage of the IDD as shown in Castellaneta et al. (2016), the probability of each startup receiving VC funding could decrease if there is an increase in the number of startups demanding VC funding.5 Our study contributes to the literature by exploring the underlying mechanism of the reduction in the matching rate between VCs and startups. We present evidence of VCs adjusting their investment strategies and of the drop in startups’ innovation productivity due to muted incentives for inventors to signal their capability to the external labor market.  \n\n## II1.  Institutional Background and Hypothesis Development  \n\n### A. Institutional Background  \n\nThe IDD was first recognized by the state of New York in 1919 to protect trade secrets. In the original New York state court ruling, a trade secret is defined as any business information that can generate economic value if disclosed or used by the companies? employees. The court also ruled that a trade secret is subject to reasonable protections by the company as a business secret. The recognition of the IDD by state courts reinforces the protection of trade secrets for firms located in those states. According to the IDD, a firm can file a lawsuit against another firm that has hired a former employee of the first firm if the first firm can provide evidence that (1)  \n\nthe employee had access to its trade secrets, (2) the employee's duties in the new employment would inevitably require her to disclose or use those trade secrets, and (3) the disclosure or use of the trade secrets would cause irreparable economic harm to the suing firm. Furthermore, the IDD protects the firm's trade secrets even if the employee is hired by a firm that is located in a state that has not adopted the IDD. The IDD maintains that if the new employment would inevitably lead to the disclosure of the trade secret to competitors and would cause irreparable harm to the suing firm, a state court can prevent the employee from moving to the competitor or can limit her responsibility in the new job.6  \n\nThe IDD reduces the risk that an employee will disclose a business secret to a competitor or take advantage of her knowledge of trade secrets to start a new company in a similar industry. Before an employee decides to move to a new company or to start her own company, she must consider whether she will be breaking any regulations related to the IDD. As a result, an employee has less incentive to switch jobs if doing so could lead to a lengthy lawsuit filed by a prior employer operating in a state that has adopted the IDD.  \n\nFor our analysis, we start with all court rulings on the IDD. If a state court ruled in favor of the IDD, we categorize this state as one that has adopted the IDD as of the time of the court ruling. If a court in such a state ruled against the IDD in a later case, we define this state as one that has rejected the IDD from the date of the subsequent ruling. For example, a Texas court ruled in favor of the IDD on May 28, 1993. However, on Apr. 3, 2003, another Texas court decided against the IDD. Such occurrences are rare, with only three instances so far. Florida, Michigan, and Texas rejected the previously adopted IDD several years after its initial adoption. Table 1 shows the adoption and rejection dates of the IDD in twenty-one US states. The earliest adoption year was New York's in 1919, and the most recent was that of Kansas in 2006. Klasa et al. (2018) provide details about the precedent-setting legal cases in which state courts adopted the IDD or rejected it after adoption.  \n\n[Insert Table 1 Here]  \n\nBecause of its important impact on young startups, the IDD is of particular relevance in the VC setting. Startups, in their early years, have difficulty providing competitive compensation packages that are comparable to those of their established counterparts. Employees who work in startups, however, are usually passionate about the firms? growth opportunities and hope for a big payout later when the venture succeeds, even though it is well known that the odds are small. Also, with so much uncertainty, startups are more likely to lose key employees to their competitors.  \n\nIn the states that have adopted the IDD, employees find it more difficult to move, making it easier for the startups to retain talent. While the adoption of the IDD makes it hard for startups? employees to leave for a more established firm, it also hampers startups? ability to attract outside talent. Thus, the adoption of the IDD leads to a decline in the mobility of human capital, which is the key to startups′ success. The suboptimal allocation of human capital, which is caused by the decline in mobility, leads to greater concerns among VCs about talent distortions associated with investing in startups. Therefore, the adoptions and rejections of the IDD provide us a good opportunity to examine the important role played by startups? labor mobility in various aspects of VC financing.  \n\nFurthermore, the staggered adoption and rejection of the IDD in different states provide us with an ideal empirical setting from which to draw causal inferences in the spirit of Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003). States become part of the treated group once they adopt the IDD. The states that have not yet passed the IDD, have rejected the IDD, or have never tried IDD cases are in the control group. Hence, our control group is not restricted to states that have never passed the IDD. Our identification strategy implicitly takes as the control group all firms in states that had not yet adopted the IDD, even if they did so later. We are essentially carrying out a difference-in-differences estimation by exploiting the staggered passage of the IDD.  \n\nCertain types of employees—-including executives, sales staff, and research and development-related technical workers-are required to sign employment contracts containing a nondisclosure agreement (NDA), a covenant not to compete, i.e., non-compete clauses (CNC), or both, which are designed to protect firms′ trade secrets. However, the protection offered by these contracts is limited and the IDD adds significantly more protection to firms’ trade secrets.7  \n\nThere are several important differences between the IDD and employment contracts that contain an NDA or a CNC-type clause. First, NDAs or CNCs are usually more effective within a specific geographic area, e.g., a state or a part of a state. However, the IDD can be enforced across a much broader geographic area. For example, the IDD can prevent employees from switching to competing firms that operate in another state, including a state that has not adopted the IDD. Second, the IDD allows state courts to grant injunctions even if the job-switching employees did not sign an NDA or a CNC with their former employers. Third, the IDD allows courts to prevent employees from working for competing firms if such employment would inevitably lead to future violations of NDAs or CNCs, thus even before actual violations are detected. This significantly increases the enforceability of NDAs and CNCs. To clearly identify the impact of the passage of the IDD, we control for the effect of CNCs in the empirical analysis.  \n\n### B. Hypothesis Development  \n\nWe propose two competing hypotheses regarding the effect of labor mobility restrictions on VC investment and outcomes. Our first hypothesis, the talent retention hypothesis, argues that restricting startups’ labor mobility encourages VC investment. Hart and Moore (1994) argue that, in an incomplete contract framework, entrepreneurs could not commit to staying with a startup in which their human capital is critical to achieving the venture's full potential after it starts (i.e., a holdup problem); consequently, the entrepreneurs would not be able to raise capital for some profitable ventures. Bolton, Wang, and Yang (2019) further extend the model and show that the inalienability of human capital has important implications for corporate risk and liquidity management. Consistent with these theoretical arguments, Kaplan and Stromberg (2003) use real contracts between VCs and startups to show that it is prevalent for VCs to use CNCs to compel entrepreneurs to stay with a firm; they suggest that CNCs could mitigate the holdup problem. Examining public companies, Qiu and Wang (2018) show that the adoption of the IDD has positive effects on firms? market valuations. Motivated by these studies, we argue that restricting key employees? mobility prevents the leakage of business secrets and could increase a startup's competitiveness by allowing it to fully appropriate the returns from its own human capital development. In addition, restricting key employees (especially those who possess knowledge about core technologies) from moving to rivals allows startups to retain their key talent. As a result, both the startups and the employees are incentivized to invest more in employees? firmspecific human capital: startups are willing to invest in the employees? human capital, because labor mobility frictions lower the possibility of their losing the return from investment in the employees; and employees are willing to build firm-specific human capital because the labor  \n\nmobility friction restricts their outside options. Overall, this hypothesis predicts a higher success rate for startups with the restriction of human capital mobility. Therefore, VCs are more willing to invest in these startups.  \n\nOur second hypothesis, the talent distortion hypothesis, predicts that labor mobility restrictions could impede VC investment. We argue that there are two plausible channels through which labor mobility restrictions discourage VC investment: the incentive channel and the knowledge spillover channel. The argument for the incentive channel is that low labor mobility could reduce existing employees? incentives to work hard (Fulghieri and Sevilir (2011)). As in the signaling game where there is incomplete information on workers? ability, inventors have incentives to generate patents to signal their ability in the labor market (Spence (1973), Gibbons et al. (2005)). However, restrictions on labor mobility make it difficult for skilled workers to move and therefore reduce their incentives to innovate (Contigiani et al. (2018)), which could negatively affect a startup's performance and VCs’ incentives to invest. The knowledge spillover channel argues that low labor mobility makes it more difficult for startups to recruit necessary talent from outside and can distort the allocation of human capital across startups (Amornsiripanitch et al. (2019)). As argued by previous studies (Fleming (2001), Hellmann and Perotti (2011), idea recombination is important for innovation and hence for a startup's growth potential and eventual success. Low labor mobility dampens the circulation of ideas among inventors and thus reduces the possibility of idea recombination and technological innovation. Therefore, VCs may recognize the risk and be less willing to invest in startups (Contigiani et al. (2018)).  \n\n## IV. Data and Variable Construction  \n\nOur main data come from the Thomson Reuters VentureXpert database. We include all ventures located in the United States that received their first-round funding during the period 1980 through 2012. We require the ventures to have complete financing information. We exclude ventures in the utilities (2-digit SIC code 49) and financial services (2-digit SIC code between 60 and 69) industries to avoid potential confounding effects from deregulation in those industries during the same time period. We end up with about 15,000 unique startups and around 1,100 VCs in the sample. Several other data sources are also employed in our analysis. For example, we obtain firms’ accounting information from the Compustat Annual File Database and inventor information from the patent inventor database of Harvard Business School.  \n\nIn the baseline analysis, we study how labor mobility restrictions affect VCs? investment decisions. That is, we investigate the changes in the likelihood of VC investment in a startup after the IDD. To conduct this analysis, we construct a hypothetical sample of potential deals in the spirit of Bottazzi, Da Rin, and Hellman (2016) and Gompers et al. (2016). Specifically, for every deal in our sample, we create hypothetical VC-startup pairs. For each VC, we consider all possible startups in which the VC could have invested. For example, suppose a VC invests in a startup and there are nine other startups in which the VC could have invested but did not. The data structure for this deal has ten rows: one row for the startup in which the VC has invested plus nine rows, one for each potential startup in which the VC could have invested but did not. Using this hypothetical sample, we construct our main dependent variable, Investment, which is a dummy variable that equals 1 if the VC-startup deal takes place and O otherwise.  \n\nWe create this hypothetical sample with two restrictions in mind. First, we require that the VCs exist before the startups are founded. Second, we restrict the sample to VCs that have invested, within the next 30 days, in at least one other deal in the same industry as the startups.8 This restriction allows us to better capture the true investment intention of the VCs. Finally, we end up with around 372,000 potential deals.  \n\nOur main independent variable, IDD, is a dummy variable that equals 1 if the state has passed the IDD and O otherwise. In our regression analysis, we control for a set of variables that have been identified by prior literature that could affect VCs′ investment decisions: VC_REPUTATION is defined as the number of IPOs backed by a VC as a fraction of IPOs backed by all VCs in the market in the previous 3 years; AGE represents the natural logarithm of the number of years since the inception of the venture; EARLY_DUMMY equals 1 if the firm is in the “startup/seed” or “early stage” as indicated by the VentureXpert database and O otherwise; DISTANCE is defined as the natural logarithm of the distance (in miles) between the startup and the VC; INDUSTRY_FIT is the percentage of deals made by a VC in the same industry as its portfolio firm; and, to control for the effect from non-compete clauses, we include CNC, which is an enforcement index for the covenant not to compete at the state level following Bird and Knopf (2015) by using the Garmaise (2011) sample from 1974 through 2004 and by extending the sample using Malsberger (2017) for years from 2005 through 2012.  \n\nMoreover, we explore how VCs alter their investment strategies in response to labor mobility decline induced by the IDD. To do this, we construct two variables—DURATION and SYNDICATION—which are used extensively by prior literature, to gauge VCs? investment strategy. DURATION is constructed as the natural logarithm of the number of days between the current-round date and the final-round date divided by the number of rounds left.  \n\nSYNDICATION is a dummy variable that equals 1 if a round is financed by more than one VC and O otherwise.  \n\nWe also investigate the effect of the IDD on VCs’ investment outcomes. To perform this analysis, we define three investment outcome variables: SUCCESS, a dummy variable that equals 1 if the firm exits through either IPO or M&A and O otherwise; IPO, a dummy variable that equals 1 if the venture goes public and O otherwise; and ACQUISITION, a dummy variable that equals 1 if the startup is acquired and O otherwise.  \n\n# [Insert Table 2 Here]  \n\nThe Appendix provides detailed variable definitions for all variables used in our tests and Table 2 presents summary statistics of our main variables. We report the mean, the standard deviation, the 25th percentile, the median, and the 75th percentile for each variable. As shown in Table 2, the average startup's probability of receiving VC financing is $13.4\\%$ within all hypothetical VC-startup pairs; the average startup in the sample is about 4.5 years old; and $69.2\\%$ of startups are in the early stage. In the startup-round panel, we find $14.6\\%$ of the firms exit either through an IPO $(5.7\\%)$ or through M&A $(13.5\\%)$  \n\n## V. Empirical Results  \n\nIn this section, we present our empirical results. We first explore whether the adoption of the IDD restricts labor mobility and then examine how labor mobility restrictions, i.e., the recognition of the IDD, affect VC investment likelihood. Moreover, to strengthen the causal link and explore underlying mechanisms, we perform cross-sectional tests and examine inventors' patent characteristics and startups? innovative output after the IDD. Finally, we provide evidence on how VCs adjust their investment strategy in response to the effect of the IDD and their ultimate investment outcome.  \n\n### A. Labor Mobility  \n\nFor our identification strategy—that is, the adoption of the IDD restricts labor mobilityto work, we first need to establish the fact that employees who work for VC-backed startups are indeed less likely to carry out job-hopping activities after the IDD. In this subsection, we examine inventors′ mobility surrounding the adoption of the IDD. We focus on inventors for two reasons. First, for our sample of VC-backed startups, inventors—-who are equipped with technical trade secrets that are extremely important to the startup development—-are the backbones of startup operations. Second, it is difficult to find micro-level datasets that track each employee's employment history. However, the inventor database maintained by Harvard Business School provides us with abundant information about patent inventors. Using records on patent filings—such as filing company, filing date, patent class, and patent inventors—we are able to track each inventor's employment history information.  \n\nIn terms of the IDD, court rulings often come as a surprise and represent plausibly exogenous shocks to labor mobility. Different states adopt and reject the IDD on different dates. We implement a difference-in-differences approach in which the staggered recognition of the IDD provides us with both the control and treatment groups (as in Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003). In our analysis, we examine inventors′ within-state mobility and out-of-state mobility separately. As long as the state where a worker's employment contract is written has adopted the IDD, the IDD can prevent the employee from working for competing firms that operate in other states that have not adopted the IDD. Thus, we expect that the adoption of the IDD by a state should reduce the mobility of inventors in that state from relocating to competing firms in the same state or in any other state.  \n\nTo carry out the test, we obtain the Disambiguation and Co-authorship Networks of the US Patent Inventor Database (1975-2010) maintained by Harvard Business School. We restrict our sample period to 1980-2010 to match the VC sample as closely as possible. We identify an inventor as a “mover”’ (someone who has moved to a new job) if she has two successive patent filings assigned to different firms. We start by matching the patent assignees to the startups in the VentureXpert database. The goal is to restrict our inventor sample to inventors who work for startups initially. We track the job changes of those inventors, who could be changing to other startups or to established firms. Because the IDD is specifically designed to prevent employees from disclosing trade secrets to their subsequent employers, which are more likely to be rival firms, we further refine our sample by focusing on within-industry moves. We eliminate all inventors who filed only one patent in our sample period. We keep only one observation for each inventor if she has multiple patent filings during the same year.? Following the literature on labor mobility, we define the year of the move as the midpoint between the years of filing two successive patents that are assigned to different firms.1° In our final sample, we have around 220,000 inventors. Inventors on average move to another company every 3 years. We then estimate the following equation:  \n\n$$\nM O V E_{i,t}=\\beta\\cdot I D D_{s,t}+\\gamma^{\\prime}\\cdot X_{s,t}+\\mu_{i}+\\delta_{s}+\\eta_{j,t}+\\epsilon_{i,t},\n$$  \n\nwhere the dependent variable, $\\mathrm{MOVE_{\\mathrm{i,t}}}$ , is a dummy variable that equals 1 if an inventor $i$ moves in year $t$ (as indicated by the same inventor filing two successive patents that are assigned to different firms) and O otherwise. To study separately the effects for within-state moves and outof-state moves, we create two other dependent variables: IN_STATE_MOVE, a dummy variable that equals 1 if an inventor moves within the same state and O if an inventor does not move; OUT_OF_STATE_MOVE, a dummy variable that equals 1 if an inventor moves to a different state and O if an inventor does not move. In other words, the control groups for both in-state moves and out-of-state moves are inventors who do not move. $\\mathrm{IDD}_{s,\\mathrm{t}}$ is a dummy variable that equals 1 if state $s$ has passed the IDD by year $t$ (and has not subsequently rejected the IDD) and 0 otherwise. $X_{s,t}$ represents a set of state-year-level variables that might affect an inventor's mobility in the analysis: UNEMPLOYMENT is the unemployment rate of each state; GDP_GROWTH is the growth rate of each state's GDP; and POLITICAL_BALANCE is defined as the fraction of a state's representatives in the US House of Representatives that belong to the Democratic Party. To control for the effect of CNC on labor mobility, we include CNC, which is an index of CNC enforcement. The symbols $\\mu_{i},\\delta_{s}$ and $\\eta_{j,t}$ represent inventor, state, and industry-year fixed effects, respectively.  \n\n[Insert Table 3 Here]  \n\nTable 3 presents the results of our linear probability regression related to the effects of IDD adoption on inventor mobility. As shown in column 1, the coefficient estimate on the IDD dummy is negative and statistically significant, which suggests that IDD adoption makes it more difficult for inventors to move. In columns 2 and 3, we test in-state and out-of-state moves, respectively. Our results indicate that after adoption of the IDD, inventors are less likely to move, either in state or out of state, indicating that the IDD restricts overall labor mobility. In  \n\nterms of economic significance, the decrease in the probability of moving is around $40\\%$ compared to the unconditional mean.11  \n\nOverall, the analysis in this subsection suggests that there is a significant reduction in inventor mobility after the adoption of the IDD. The passage of the IDD distorts human capital allocation across startups by reducing labor mobility. This finding provides further support to our identification strategy and serves as a foundation for our main analysis of the impact of the IDD on VC investment.  \n\n### B. Baseline Results  \n\nIn this subsection, we present our baseline findings on how the adoption of the IDD affects the likelihood of VC investment.  \n\n#### 1. Investment Likelihood  \n\nWe construct a hypothetical sample of potential deals in the spirit of Bottazzi et al. (2016) and Gompers et al. (2016). Specifically, for each VC in our sample, we create hypothetical VCstartup pairs by forming a universe of startups that are in the same industry in which the VC has invested within 30 days; this yields approximately 372,000 potential deals. We then estimate the VCs’ investment decisions with the following specification:  \n\n$$\nI N V E S T M E N T_{p}=\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{I}\\boldsymbol{D}\\boldsymbol{D}_{s,t}+\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}^{\\prime}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{X}+\\varphi_{k}+\\delta_{s}+\\eta_{j,t}+\\epsilon_{p},\n$$  \n\nwhere $p$ indexes potential investor-firm pairs. The dependent variable is INVESTMENTp, which is a dummy variable that equals 1 if a VC finances the startup and O otherwise. IDD is a dummy variable that equals 1 if firm $i$ is in state $s$ that has adopted the IDD by year $t$ and O otherwise. If state $s$ subsequently rejected the IDD at year $t{+}n$ , then we assign Os to IDD for firm $i$ in state $s$ for the years after the rejection. $X$ represents the host of variables to account for observable characteristics. Specifically, $X$ includes VC_REPUTATION, EARLY_DUMMY, AGE, DISTANCE, INDUSTRY_FIT, and CNC. These variables potentially influence the likelihood of VC investment and are frequently examined in the VC literature. Moreover, we include various fixed effects: $\\varphi_{k},\\delta_{s}$ , and $\\eta_{j,t}$ represent lead VC, state, and industry-year fixed effects, respectively. These fixed effects control for unobservable lead VC characteristics, state heterogeneity, and industry-year specific characteristics, respectively. We cluster standard errors by state. $\\beta$ is the coefficient of interest, and it captures the effect of the IDD on VCs′ investment decisions.  \n\n[Insert Table 4 Here]  \n\nTable 4 presents our baseline results. Columns 1, 2, and 3 report the estimation results for three different specifications. All three columns show a negative and statistically significant coefficient estimate on the IDD dummy. Taking column 3 as an example, the regression coefficient on the IDD dummy is $-2\\%$ , which is statistically significant at the $5\\%$ level. This result is also economically sizable. Given that the unconditional probability of VCs? investing in startups is around $13\\%$ , our findings represent a $15\\%$ drop in the likelihood of VC investment in a startup after the adoption of the IDD. Together our results suggest that, after the adoption of the IDD, the likelihood of VC investment decreases significantly. In other words, startups are less likely to receive VC financing after IDD adoption. This observation is consistent with our  \n\nhypothesis that VC investors are concerned about talent distortions embedded in startups after the adoption of the IDD and hence are less likely to invest in startups.12  \n\n#### 2. Dynamic Trend  \n\nAs shown in Table 1, there are three states that rejected previously adopted IDD rulings several years after the initial adoption. The IDD dummy in Table 4 captures the effect of both adoptions and subsequent rejections (if any) of the IDD by each state. Next, we examine the effects of adoptions and rejections separately.  \n\nTo carry out the analysis, we slightly modify equation (2) by replacing the IDD dummy with an ADOPTION dummy and a REJECTION dummy. Specifically, we estimate the following model:  \n\n(3) $\\mathrm{INVESTMENT_{p}}=\\beta_{1}\\cdot\\mathrm{ADOPTION}+\\beta_{2}\\cdot\\mathrm{RE}\\mathrm{JECTION}+\\gamma^{\\prime}\\cdot\\mathrm{X}+\\phi_{\\mathrm{k}}+\\delta_{s}+\\eta_{\\mathrm{j,t}}+\\mathrm{e.e.c.}$ .p where ADOPTION is a dummy variable that equals 1 if firm $i$ is in state $s$ that has adopted the IDD from year $t$ and O otherwise. REJECTION is a dummy variable that equals 1 if firm $i$ is in state $s$ that has rejected IDD from year $t$ and O otherwise. $\\beta_{I}$ and $\\beta_{2}$ are the coefficients of interest. They separately demonstrate the effects of IDD adoptions and rejections on VC investment likelihood.  \n\n[Insert Table 5 Here]  \n\nColumns 1 and 2 in Table 5 present the estimation results. Similar to the baseline results, we observe negative and statistically significant coefficients on the ADOPTION dummies. The regression coefficients are qualitatively similar to those in Table 4. This observation tells us that adopting the IDD leads to a significant decrease in the likelihood of VC investment. Rejecting the IDD should have the opposite effect, and this is exactly what we observe in column 1: a positive and statistically significant coefficient on the IDD rejection dummy. However, this coefficient becomes insignificant in column 2 after more control variables are included. This result is not surprising because the number of states (three) that have rejected the IDD is very Small.  \n\nWe then carry out formal tests to ensure that the parallel trends assumption of the difference-in-differences approach is satisfied. Following Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003), Giroud and Mueller (2010), and Acharya, Baghai, and Subramanian (2013) among others, we replace the IDD dummy in equation (2) with six dummy variables that capture different time points around the adoption of the IDD. Specifically, we estimate the following model:  \n\n(4) ${\\mathrm{INVESTMENT}}_{\\mathrm{p}}=\\upbeta_{1}\\cdot{\\mathrm{ADOPTIONM3}}_{-}{\\mathrm{PLUS}}+\\upbeta_{2}\\cdot{\\mathrm{ADOPTIONM2}}+\\upbeta_{3}\\cdot{\\mathrm{ADOPTIONM2}}$ 1ONM1+ β4 ·ADOPTIONP1 + β5·ADOPTIONP2 + β6·ADOPTIONP3_PLUS + β7·REJECTION + ' : $\\mathrm{X}+\\mathrm{\\varphi_{\\mathrm{k}}}+\\delta_{s}+\\eta_{\\mathrm{j,t}}+\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{p}}$  \n\nWe define ADOPTIONM3_PLUS, ADOPTIONM2, ADOPTIONM1, ADOPTIONP1, ADOPTIONP2, and ADOPTIONP3_PLUS as dummy variables that equal 1 if the state adopts the IDD within 3 or more years, 2 years, 1 year, the past year, the past 2 years, and the past 3 or more years respectively in reference to the date of VC investment and O otherwise. The REJECTION dummy is defined the same as in equation (3). If we observe statistically significant coefficients on the ADOPTIONM3_PLUS, ADOPTIONM2, or ADOPTIONM1  \n\ndummies, it implies that the parallel trends assumption is not satisfied and changes in VC investment precede the changes in law.  \n\nColumn 3 in Table 5 shows no statistically significant coefficients on the ADOPTIONM3_PLUS, ADOPTIONM2, or ADOPTIONM1 dummies, which suggests that the parallel trends assumption of the difference-in-differences approach is satisfied and changes in VC investment do not precede the adoption of the IDD. The coefficient estimates on ADOPTIONP1, ADOPTIONP2, and ADOPTIONP3_PLUS are consistent with our baseline results in Table 4. Note that the rejection effect is again statistically insignificant.  \n\nTaking the investment likelihood analyses together, we are able to test the two competing hypotheses, i.e., the talent retention hypothesis and the talent distortion hypothesis. Our main results show that, following the adoption of the IDD, there is a drop in the likelihood of VC investment with meaningful economic magnitudes, i.e., IDD reduces the likelihood of VC investment by around $15\\%$ . The evidence appears to be consistent with the talent distortion hypothesis.  \n\n### C. Cross-Sectional Tests  \n\nOur baseline results suggest that the adoption of the IDD discourages VC investment. If talent distortions created by the adoption of the IDD are indeed the reason, we would expect this negative effect to be stronger in human-capital-intensive industries, for startups that are in greater need of human capital, and among startups whose human capital is difficult to monitor by VCs. Therefore, in this subsection, we strengthen the causal link between talent distortions caused by the IDD and VC investment by carrying out tests with our rich cross-sectional data. More concretely, we examine whether our main results become more pronounced in startups that are in industries with intensive patenting activity, are in the early financing stage when concerns about talent distortions are more significant, or are located farther from VCs and hence are more difficult for VCs to monitor.13 We expect to observe more negative effects of the IDD among these firms.  \n\nWe estimate equation (2) by including an interaction term to capture the cross-sectional effects. Table 6 presents our estimation results. We test the investment likelihood effect using the hypothetical sample of VC-startup pairs from Subsection V.B.1. The dependent variable is INVESTMENT, which is a dummy variable that equals 1 if the VC-startup deal takes place and O otherwise.  \n\n[Insert Table 6 Here]  \n\nWe start by comparing startups in patenting-intensive industries with firms in industries with low patenting intensity and report the results in column 1 of Table 6. We construct an INDUSTRY_PATENTING_INTENSITY_DUMMY using all firms in the Compustat database by calculating the average number of patents in an industry classified at the 3-digit SIC code level.14 We define patenting-intensive industries as those with patenting output in the top $50\\%$ and low-patenting-intensity industries as those with patenting intensity in the bottom $50\\%$ Because startups in patenting-intensive industries devote more resources to research and development, they are in greater need of talent. The adoption of the IDD should, therefore, have a stronger effect on those startups. We find statistically significant results, which is consistent with our conjecture.  \n\nWe next compare startups that receive investments at early stages with those that receive investments at later stages. The results are presented in column 2 of Table 6. Startups that seek VC financing at an early stage need more talented employees to help the development of the venture and thus should be affected more by talent distortions created by the adoption of the IDD. Therefore, we expect our main findings to be more pronounced among startups that receive VC financing at their early stages. We define EARLY_DUMMY as 1 if the firm is in the \"'startup/seed\"' or “early stage” as indicated by the VentureXpert database and O otherwise. We interact EARLY_DUMMY with the IDD dummy, and the coefficient estimate on the interaction term is the coefficient of interest. Again, the test result is in line with our expectation, as shown by the negative and significant coefficient estimate on the interaction term.  \n\nLastly, we investigate how our main results are altered by VCs’ cost of effectively monitoring startups. As shown in Tian (2011), the physical distance between VCs and startups is a good proxy for VCs’ monitoring cost. Hence, when talent distortions are high, we postulate that VCs invest in startups that are in closer proximity to themselves for more effective monitoring. If this conjecture is supported, we expect to observe a reduction in VC investment for startups located farther from them. We define DISTANCE_DUMMY as a dummy variable that equals 1 if the firm is located more than 150 miles from the VC (Tian (2011) and 0 otherwise, and interact it with the IDD dummy. We present the results in column 3 of Table 6. For the interaction term, we find a negative and statistically significant coefficient, suggesting that VCs are less likely to invest in startups that are located farther from them after the adoption of the IDD.  \n\nTo summarize, the cross-sectional tests show that our main findings are more pronounced in industries with higher patenting intensity, among startups with earlier-stage VC investments, and among firms located farther from VCs. Startups with these characteristics tend to rely more on human capital in their development; hence restrictions on labor mobility lead to greater talent distortions in these firms. These results suggest that reduced labor mobility (induced by the adoption of the IDD) leads to reductions in VC investment.  \n\n### D. Mechanisms  \n\nIn this subsection, we explore plausible underlying mechanisms through which the IDD affects VC investment. We suspect that the reduction in employees? innovation productivity is a plausible underlying mechanism. To test this conjecture, we examine patent counts and patent citations at both the inventor-year level and the startup-year level following the IDD adoptions. Next, we propose two potential reasons why reduced labor mobility caused by the IDD affects employees? innovation productivity. First, under normal conditions in a signaling game with incomplete information, inventors are highly incentivized to generate patents in their focal domain; this signals their abilities to innovate to the labor market, which could lead to outside employment options (Spence (1973), Gibbons et al. (2005)). However, after the adoption of the IDD, inventors are less likely to switch jobs due to restrictions on labor mobility, leading to lower incentives to innovate in their focal patents; this could take a toll on the startups? productivity and eventually on the VCs’ bottom lines (Fulghieri and Sevilir (2011)). Second, innovation requires idea recombination (Fleming (2001), Hellmann and Perotti (2011)). The adoption of the IDD impedes labor mobility, which makes it more difficult for ideas to circulate, thus resulting in lower innovation output from startups.  \n\nWe empirically test the above mechanisms and two plausible explanations using data on individual inventors? innovative output. We again use the patent network database from Harvard  \n\nBusiness School to construct inventor-level innovative output measures. We restrict our sample period to 1980-2010 to match the VC sample as closely as possible. We also require our sample to include only inventors who work for startups. First, we directly test whether there is a reduction in firms? innovative output as a response to the IDD shock. We use two dependent variables to gauge a firm's innovative output: NUMBER_OF_PATENTS and NUMBER_OF_CITATIONS. We define Ln(PATENT) as the natural logarithm of 1 plus the total number of patents produced by the startup in a year. We also define Ln(CITATION) as the natural logarithm of the average number of citations per patent for a startup.  \n\n[Insert Table 7 Here]  \n\nPanel A in Table 7 reports the estimation results at both the inventor-year level and the startup-year level. As shown in columns 1 and 2, the coefficient estimate on the IDD dummy is negative and significant at the $5\\%$ and $1\\%$ levels, respectively. This result suggests that inventors produce fewer patents and that their patents receive fewer subsequent citations after the adoption of the IDD. The lower output at the inventor-year level is also confirmed by the results at the startup-year level reported in columns 3 and 4, which show that startups experience a drop in the number of patent counts and patent citations following the adoption of the IDD. Overall, our findings in Table 7 Panel A suggest that the adoption of the IDD has a negative effect on startups’ patenting activities.15  \n\nWe then examine plausible reasons for our above observations by distinguishing the incentive channel and the knowledge spillover channel in the cross section of innovative output.  \n\nWe implement the same empirical design as in Panel A and define two indicator variables, HIGH_MOBILITY_DUMMY and HIGH_SPILLOVER_DUMMY, to capture signaling and idea recombination, respectively. In industries with higher labor mobility, the incentives to signal are higher. As a result, the decrease in innovation output following the adoption of the IDD (restricting labor mobility) would be higher in these industries. We define a HIGH_MOBILITY _DUMMY as 1 if the industry-level number of inventor moves scaled by the total number of inventors is above the median and O otherwise. We then interact this variable with the IDD dummy. We would expect a negative coefficient estimate on the interaction term after the adoption of the IDD if our early finding is due to the incentive channel. To test the knowledge spillover channel, we define a HIGH_SPILLOVER_DUMMY as 1 if the industry. level number of within-industry patent citations scaled by total patent citations is above the median and O otherwise. We then interact this variable with the IDD dummy. We would expect a negative coefficient estimate on the interaction term after the adoption of the IDD if the idea combination is at play here because our measure captures the industries in which knowledge spillovers are more important.  \n\nTo test these two plausible channels, we carry out regressions similar to equation (1) and present the results in Panel B of Table 7. In columns 1 to 4, we carry out an inventor-year level analysis. We use Ln(PATENT) and Ln(CITATION) as the dependent variables. In columns 1 and 2, we test the incentive channel. We find a negative and significant relation between the innovation measures and the interaction term, suggesting that inventors further decrease their innovative output in industries with higher labor mobility. In other words, inventors are not actively patenting their innovative work that pertains to their focal areas, which could serve as a potential explanation for the talent distortions that concern VCs. In columns 3 and 4, we test the knowledge spillover channel. The coefficient estimates on the interaction terms are economically small and statistically insignificant, suggesting that the knowledge spillover argument is not supported by the data. In columns 5 to 8, we implement the same analysis, but at the startup level. We find qualitatively similar results.  \n\n### E. VC Investment Strategy  \n\nSo far, we have established the adverse effect of the IDD on the likelihood of VC investment. In this subsection, we study the intensive margin: given their investment in startups, whether VCs adjust their investment strategies to mitigate talent distortions caused by the IDD. In particular, we focus on two important aspects of VC investment strategies, i.e., staging and syndication.  \n\nStaging, the stepwise disbursement of capital from VCs to startups, is an effective way to mitigate agency problems in VC financing. This is because VCs split funding for startups into multiple rounds of financing instead of making a larger, lump-sum payment upfront (Gompers (1995), Tian (2011)). VCs take such caution to reduce investment uncertainty because it keeps entrepreneurs on a “tight leash\" (Sahlman (1990), Gompers (1995)), and hence staging has real option value. Syndication, a striking feature of the VC industry, is co-investment in the same startups by multiple VCs (Lerner (1994). Similar to syndicated bank loans, syndication allows VCs to share the risk associated with startups. In a VC syndicate, the participating VCs can share opinions about the investment and make joint decisions based on their combined knowledge. Therefore, VCs could mitigate the adverse consequences of talent distortion by intensifying staging and relying more on syndication.  \n\nTo test the above conjecture, we estimate a regression specification that is similar to equation (2), but we replace the outcome variable with VC investment strategy measures. More specifically, we run OLS regressions in the following model:  \n\n$$\nI N V E S T M E N T S T R A T E G Y_{l}=\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{I}\\boldsymbol{D}\\boldsymbol{D}_{s,t}+\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}^{\\prime}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{X}+\\varphi_{k}+\\delta_{s}+\\eta_{j,t}+\\epsilon_{p}.\n$$  \n\nIn a startup-round level panel, we use two variables to gauge VC investment strategy in startups: DURATION and SYNDICATION. We define DURATION as the natural logarithm of the number of days between the current round date and final round date divided by the number of rounds left. The variable SYNDICATION is a dummy variable that equals 1 if a round is financed by more than one VC and O otherwise. Table 8 presents the estimation results. In column 1, DURATION is the dependent variable.16 We observe a negative and significant coefficient estimate on the IDD dummy, which suggests that, in response to increased talent distortions, VCs maintain greater control over the startups by splitting financing into a shorter duration between two successive rounds after the adoption of the IDD.  \n\n[Insert Table 8 Here]  \n\nIn column 2, we replace the dependent variable with SYNDICATION. The coefficient estimate on the IDD dummy is positive and significant at the $1\\%$ level. The evidence suggests that VCs are likely to co-invest with other VCs in startups after a state adopts the IDD to mitigate the adverse effect of talent distortions. It is, once again, consistent with our conjecture.  \n\n### F. VC Investment Outcome  \n\nThe ultimate goal for VCs is to earn high financial returns when they exit from the startups. As we have argued before, the adoption of the IDD could have both positive and 16 A longer incubation period is typically associated with more rounds of financing. Thus, we include startup incubation period as one of the control variables in the estimation.  \n\nnegative effects. On the one hand, the IDD deters key talents from leaving for a competing firm. On the other hand, labor mobility restrictions reduce employees’ outside options and thus their incentives to work hard to signal their ability in the labor market. Furthermore, the IDD makes it more difficult for startups to recruit outside talent. If the positive effect dominates, startups are more likely to exit successfully. If the negative effect dominates, startups are less likely to exit successfully. Overall, the effect of IDD adoption on startups? exits depends on the dominance of the positive or negative effects of the IDD. Therefore, how the IDD affects VCs’ investment outcomes is an empirical question.  \n\nTo test the effect of IDD adoptions on VC exits, we consider IPOs and M&As as two successful exit pathways (e.g., Brander et al. (2002), Sorensen (2007), Bottazzi et al. (2016)). We conduct the analysis at the startup-round level. Therefore, the SUCCESS dummy equals 1 if the startup exits during the round by IPO or M&A and O otherwise. We also distinguish the two successful exit pathways. The IPO dummy equals 1 if the firm exits by going public and 0 otherwise. And similarly, the ACQUISITION dummy equals 1 if the firm exits by M&A and 0 otherwise. Specifically, we estimate the following equation:  \n\n$$\nO U T C O M E_{l,t}=\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{I D}\\boldsymbol{D}_{s,t}+\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}^{\\prime}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{X}+\\varphi_{k}+\\delta_{s}+\\eta_{j,t}+\\epsilon_{p},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathrm{0UTCOME_{l,t}}$ equals 1 if the startup $i$ has a successful exit during round $t$ and O otherwise Following the standard approach in the VC literature on VC exit, we require the sample to include VC-backed firms that received first-round funding from 1980 through 2012. Table 9 presents our estimation results.  \n\n[Insert Table 9 Here]  \n\nIn column 1, we use SUCCESS as the dependent variable. We find a negative and significant relation between probabilities of successful exits and the passage of the IDD. This result suggests that the probability of successful VC exits is significantly lower after the adoption of the IDD than it is before the adoption. In column 2, we examine how VC exits through IPOs are affected by the IDD adoption, excluding from the sample those startups that are eventually acquired. We find that, after the adoption of the IDD, VCs are less likely to exit through an IPO. In column 3, we examine how the IDD affects VCs’ exits through M&As, excluding from the sample those startups that eventually go public. We also find a negative coefficient estimate on the IDD dummy, suggesting that fewer VC exits are through M&As. The results are both statistically and economically significant.17  \n\nOverall, if the adoption of the IDD leads to a higher success rate for startups as the positive talent retention effect dominates the negative talent distortion effect, we would expect to observe more successful VC exits. This is because, according to our results on the likelihood of VC investment, VCs tend to reduce the size of their investment portfolios after the adoption of the IDD. A reasonable conjecture is that, if VCs would like to invest in fewer startups, they may select better startups. However, the analysis in this subsection reveals that VCs’ investment outcomes become worse after the adoption of the IDD. This finding suggests that the negative talent distortion effect dominates and thus the adoption of the IDD reduces startups’ success rate.  \n\nOne question naturally follows: do VCs tilt their investments toward startups located outside of IDD states to circumvent the negative effects of the IDD? We find evidence that supports this conjecture. Specifically, we show that VCs tilt their portfolios away from states that pass the IDD. We report the results in Table IA4 in the Supplementary Material.  \n\n### G. Discussions of an Alternative Interpretation  \n\nWe have shown that increased restrictions on labor mobility induced by the IDD reduce VC investment. However, labor mobility restrictions also enhance trade secret protections, which could potentially affect VC investment. To investigate how reduced labor mobility and trade secret protections affect VC investment differently, we make use of the Uniform Trade Secret Act (UTSA), which strengthens the protection of trade secrets but does not restrict labor mobility. The UTSA broadens the definition of a trade secret, and merely defines the acquisition of a trade secret as a misappropriation.18  \n\n[Insert Table 10 Here]  \n\nIn Table 10, we examine whether the UTSA takes away the effect of the IDD on VC investment likelihood. In columns 1 to 3, the key independent variable is the 2010 UTSA index that we obtained from Png (2017b). Because the index covers years through 2010, we restrict our sample period accordingly. Columns 1 and 2 show that the UTSA does not have a significant effect on VC investment likelihood. Column 3 runs a horse race between the UTSA and IDD, and shows that the UTSA does not absorb the impact of the IDD on the likelihood of VC investment. The coefficient estimate on the IDD also has a similar magnitude to that of the main results (Table 4). In columns 4 to 6, we repeat the analyses reported in columns 1 to 3 using the 1998 UTSA index that we obtained from Png (2017a). In this case, the index covers all the years before 1998. As a result, we end our sample in 1998. Again, the results show that the effect of the IDD on VC investment continues to hold with the UTSA being included in the regressions.  \n\nHence, our baseline results are not driven by trade secret protections, but by reduced labor mobility.  \n\n## VI. Conclusion  \n\nIn this paper, we investigate how restrictions of labor mobility affect VC investment. To establish causality, we use the plausibly exogenous variation generated by staggered adoption of the IDD, which causes a decline in labor mobility. We find that the adoption of the IDD reduces the likelihood of VC investment. Moreover, this negative effect is concentrated in innovative industries, among firms with earlier-stage VC investment, and in longer-distance investments. Further analysis supports a talent distortion hypothesis. That is, labor mobility restrictions reduce employees? innovation productivity. To mitigate the adverse effect of the IDD, VCs engage in more staged financing of startups and more syndication with other VCs, but these efforts do not completely counter the effect; VCs still experience a drop in successful exit rates. Our paper sheds new light on the real effects of labor market frictions via the lens of VC markets.  \n\n## References  \n\nAcharya, V.; R. Baghai; and K.

Using a panel dataset of Chinese manufacturing frms, we find that VC-backed firms outperform non-VC-backed ones in patenting activities, new product sales, and exports because of the ex-ante selection and ex-post value-added effects of vC investment. Firms with better performance in innovation are more likely to get vC support, and such outperformance is magnified after the VC investment is made. Moreover, the impact of vC investment on frm innovation is greater when the protection of IPR is stronger. In addition, frms backed by more experienced vC frms (VCFs) generate more commercialized innovation but are less productive in patenting activities than firms backed by less experienced VCFs. Finally, firms backed by state-owned VCFs outperform in patenting activities but underperform in commercialized innovation those backed by other types of vCFs. ldentification and selection issues are addressed by the propensity score matching approach and twostageestimations.  \n\n## ARTICLE HISTORY  \n\nReceived 30 March 2021   \nAccepted 24 March 2022  \n\n## KEYWORDS  \n\nVenture capital; innovation; intellectual property rights protection; VCFs'   \ncharacteristics  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nIn a free market, frms may underinvest in R&D activities because the social returns to R&D are greater than their private returns (Nelson 1959). Venture capital (VC) investment is considered as one of the most effective financial instruments for financing innovative frms, especially young ones, which have difficulty obtaining other types of external financing (Kortum and Lerner 2ooo). Studies suggest that venture capital firms (VCFs) provide capital, exert intensive monitoring efforts and provide value-added support to their portfolio companies, mitigating investment risks and filling the market niche left by traditional financial institutions (Sahlman 1990; Gompers and Lerner 2001). Since the 1980s, many countries have initiated priority policies to promote the VC industry, expecting to stimulate corporate innovation (Brander, Egan, and Hellmann 2010).  \n\nEmpirical studies on the relationship between VC investment and firm innovation are ample, but the findings are heterogenous. For example, some studies find that VC investment has significantly positive effects on firm innovation (Hellmann and Puri 2000; Mann and Sager 2007; Lockett et al. 2008), while others find no statistical relationship between the two (Bottazzi and Da Rin 2002; Engel and Keilbach 2007; Hirukawa and Ueda 2011; Arvanitis and Stucki 2014; Lahr and Mina 2016). Such results suggest that the impact of VC investment on firm innovation may depend on different factors and through different mechanisms.  \n\nDespite the large body of empirical research on the relationship between VC investment and firm innovation, some knowledge gaps have not been adequately studied. First, we know very little about the factors that influence the impact of VC investment on firm innovation (Bertoni, Croce, and DAdda 2010). The answer to this question is crucial because only a better understanding of this issue will bring us closer to explaining why existing empirical studies have reached different conclusions about the relationship between VC investment and firm innovation. Second, the existing literature either uses patenting behavior or R&D investment, or new product sales or export output to measure firm innovation. However, none of it examines how VC investment affects different types of firm innovation in different contexts at the same time. For entrepreneurs and vCs, different goals and institutional contexts may influence their responses to different types of innovation. Thus, the impact of VC investment on different types of firm innovation is expected to be heterogeneous under different conditions. Third, existing studies rarely separate the selection effect from the treatment effect when examining the impact of VC on firm innovation. Research on this issue is important because only with answers to this question can we better understand the channels through which vC investment (if it does facilitate firm innovation) helps companies innovate.  \n\nThis study attempts to fill the existing knowledge gap by adding evidence on how VC investment affects different types of firm innovation under different conditions based on firm-level data from China. Specifically, we focus on both technological innovation outputs measured by patenting activities (e.g. patent counts and patent citation counts) and commercialized innovation outputs measured by sales from new products and exports of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We first ask whether VC-backed firms outperform non-VC-backed ones in the two types of innovation in China, and,if so, we disentangle whether such outperformance is caused by the ex-ante selection or ex-post value-added efforts by VCFs with rigorous research approaches. In addition, we examine how the impact of VC investment on different types of firm innovation is moderated by intellectual property rights (IPR) protection. Finally, we investigate how the characteristics of VCFs, including the ownership structure and experience, affect the impact of vC investment.  \n\nWe are particularly interested in China for several reasons. First, China is currently the secondlargest VC market globally (Guo, Jiang, and Mai 2015). However, systematic analysis of this market is limited. More importantly, as a transitional economy, China's institutions are fundamentally different from those under a free market economy $(\\mathsf{X u}2011)$ . Therefore, an insightful understanding of this market may complement existing research on institutional factors influencing VC investment in different contexts. Finally, China is a vast country with significant cross-regional variations in economic development and institutional environments. Those variations allow us to examine how IPR protection influences VC effects in different regions within the same country, thereby controlling many country-specific effects that cannot be achieved in cross-country comparisons.  \n\nBased on a firm-level dataset ranging from 1998 and 2007, we find that VC-backed firms outperform non-VC ones in terms of both technological and commercialized innovation in China. In addition, we find that the outperformance of VC-backed firms in innovation is driven by both the exante project selection and ex-post monitoring efforts of VCFs. We use two methods, i.e. the Heckman two-stageleastsquaresestimations(2SLS)withaninstrumentalvariable(IV)andadifferencein difference (DID) method, to address identification problems. Furthermore, we discover that the effects of VC investment are moderated by IPR protection and depend on VCF characteristics. Specifically, the impact of VC investment on firm innovation is further enhanced by stronger IPR protection. Moreover, government-owned/controlled VCFs (GVCFs) have greater impacts on firms' patenting activities but weaker impacts on firms' business innovation output than private VCFs (PVCFs) do. Finally, firms supported by more experienced VCFs generate greater commercialized innovation output while less technological innovation output than those supported by less experiencedvcFs.  \n\nAs the first systematic analysis on the impact of VC investment on the innovation of SMEs in China, this study enriches our understanding of vC investment in emerging markets and makes a general contribution to the literature in several ways. Above all, this study complements the existing literature on the relationship between institutions and VC investment. First, this study provides the first empirical analysis linking VC investment, corporate innovation, and IPR institutions at the frm level. Many studies have highlighted the importance of institutions for VC investment and various institutions are identified to affect the investment behaviors of VCFs and the performance of VCbacked frms (Black and Gilson 1998; Jeng and Wells 2000; Lerner and Schoar 2005; Kaplan and Stromberg 2003; Djankov et al. 2010; Bozkaya and Kerr 2014). However, surprisingly, how IPR institutions affect VC investment has attracted limited scrutiny (Ueda 2004). IPR institutions are critical to corporate R&D activities, as the extent to which innovations are legally protected determines the residual value that entrepreneurial frms can claim from (Griliches, Hall, and Pakes 1991). Therefore, it is expected that IPR institutions would affect the motivations and behaviors of VC investors and, hence, the impact of vC investment on firm innovation. As the first to provide evidence on how the effects of VC investment are sensitive to IPR protection, this study explores a new institutional dimension to explain the conditions under which VC affects firm innovation. Second, this study complements the existing studies on the impact of government engagement in VC investment by providing evidence from China, where the government has been deeply involved in business activities. The impact of government engagement has been a long-debating topic (Stiglitz 1988; Lerner 2009) and empirical studies have provided inconclusive evidence for the impact of GVCFs (Da Rin, Nicodano, and Sembenelli 2006; Cumming 2007; Brander, Egan, and Hellmann 2010; Bertoni and Tykvova 2015). The relationship between GVCFs and frm innovation in China remains understudied. Our study finds that in China, GVCFs have a greater impact on firms' patenting activities but a smaller impact on firms' commercialized innovation than other VCFs do. These results suggest that the impact of government participation in VC markets is heterogeneous, depending on the motivation and capacity of venture experts in different institutional contexts, and merit future research.  \n\nIn addition, this study is among the first attempts to distinguish the ex-ante and ex-post effects of vC investment on firm innovation. Existing studies that separate treatment and selection effects mainly focus on firm growth or productivity (Bertoni, Croce, and DAdda 2010, Chemmanur, Krishnan, and Nandy 2011; Croce, Marti, and Murtinu 2013; Guo and Jiang 2013), and the fndings are heterogeneous. Lahr and Mina (2016) is the only empirical work examining the impact of vC investment on firm innovation, differentiating the selection and treatment effects with rigorous approaches. The authors find evidence for the selection effects of VC investment on corporate patenting activity in the UsA and UK. However, no treatment effects are discovered. This study complements while differs from Lahr and Minas (2016). By examining both the patenting activities and commercialized innovation, we find support for both selection and treatment effects of vC investment on both types of innovation output in China. Such results suggest that the channels through which VC investment affects frm innovation may differ under different institutional and financial environments, calling for further research on this subject.  \n\nFinally, this study complements but differs from existing research in that it examines VC effects on both the technological innovation (patent counts and patent citation) and the commercialization of the technological innovation (sales from new product and exports) and how different types of innovation are sensitive to IPR institutions and depend on the features of VCFs. Most existing studies focus on either the patenting activities (Mann and Sager 2007; Bertoni, Croce, and DAdda 2010) or the new product sales (Hellmann and Puri 2000) or export intensity (Lockett et al. 2008) of a firm. The heterogeneous effects of VC investment on different types of innovation attract little scrutiny. As Kortum and Lerner (200o) discussed, firms may spur patenting activities that do not impact innovation solely for impressing investors. If this is the case, investigating the patenting activities of entrepreneurial firms backed by VC investment alone may not tell how much contribution venture investment makes to innovation. This study shows that VC effects on different types of innovation vary under various IPR institutions and according to VCF characteristics.  \n\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature and develops hypotheses. Section 3 describes the data and sample. Section 4 presents the findings on ${\\mathsf{V C s}}^{\\prime}$ contributionsto entrepreneurial firms' innovation, focusing on distinguishing the effects of ex-ante project screening and ex-post value-added efforts. Section 5 examines how the IPR institutions and the experience and ownerhship of VCFs influence the VC effects on firm innovation. Section 6 concludes the study.  \n\n## 2. Literature review and hypothesis development  \n\nIn this section, we review the existing literature and discuss why we expect VC investment to be related to innovation outputs of entrepreneurial frms and how IPR institutions and the experience and ownership structure of VCFs are relevant in the Chinese context.  \n\n### 2.1VC market in China and related studies  \n\nChina is among the leading countries that have made numerous efforts to develop a vibrant VC industry and promote innovations. It has been the fastest-growing VC market in the past two decades. Currently, China is the second-largest VC market in the world. The annual disbursements of VC investment have increased from virtually zero in the 1980s to ${0555.6}$ billion in 2010 and reached ${\\sf U S S105}$ billion in 2018.1 China share of the global VC market rose from $12\\%$ in 2010 to $38\\%$ in 2018. Meanwhile, VC investment plays an essential role in startups of high-tech firms in China, and VC-backed Chinese firms have become major contributors to the global initial public offering (IPO) market. By the end of the third quarter of 2018, China has 206 unicorn firms (203 in the USA), representing $41.7\\%$ of the globe total.² Moreover, more than $90\\%$ of Chinese unicorn firms are backed either by VC or other types of private equity investment.? In 2017 alone, 470 VC-backed Chinese firms went IPO in major stock markets globally (Zero2IPO, 2018), representing $30.9\\%$ of the total number of IPO cases and following-on offering deals globally in that year. These data suggest that the development of the Chinese VC market affects innovation in China and the world significantly.  \n\nHowever, concrete evidence is still lacking in the literature for knowing exactly how VC investments contribute (or do not contribute) to China innovation. This question is crucial for the following reasons. The number one reason is in practice, investment, and policymaking, given the size of the VC sector in China and the importance of sustainability of the Chinese economy to the world. The second reason is in academia. There have been intensive interests in the literature on the effectiveness of VC financing on innovation. Evidence, however, is mixed. One cannot take for granted believing or assuming that VC will work or should work in China as it does in some well-developed market economies. It is well documented that China suffers severely from many institutional problems that could impede VC and R&D in China. Among the examinations on VC investment in China, scholars mainly investigate the effects of vC investment on entrepreneurial firms' financial performance and growth (Guo and Jiang 2013; Jiang et al. 2014; Guo, Jiang, and Mai 2015). A few studies on the effects of VC investment on innovation are based on either province-level (Wen et al. 2018; Sun et al. 2019) or city-level data (Cheng et al. 2019). These studies mainly find positive effects of VC investment on a region innovation. However, many firm-level characteristics that may affect the influences of vC investment are not controlled without firm-level analysis. The only exception is the study of Jiang et al. (2019), which examines the post-IPO performance of VCbacked frms based on listed firms. Nevertheless, as it is well documented that only a small percentage of VC-backed frms have a chance to go IPO, an analysis on a sample focusing on only publicly listed firms may only capture successful vC-backed firms that may cause biases. How VC investment contributes to the innovation of SMEs in China still lacks scrutiny.  \n\n### 2.2VC investment and firm innovation  \n\nThe rationale which links VC investment and innovation lies in the fact that high-tech SMEs, usually financially constrained and having great growth potentials, can hardly access external funding because of the lack of collateral, severe information issues, and a high level of uncertainty. VCFs take high-risk-return profiles and fill in the market niche left by traditional financial institutions by playing an active role in selecting projects with growth potentials and putting great effort to monitor and support the firms they invest in (Gompers and Lerner 2001). In return, VC investment may enjoy high financial returns and promote innovation simultaneously.  \n\nEmpirical studies find that the relationship between VC investment and innovation is heterogeneous. Primarily, studies find VCs indeed invest more in young and R&D-oriented companies in some countries (e.g. United States, Taiwan, and Israel) as they are expected (Elango et al. 1995; Gupta and Sapienza 1992; Avnimelech, Kenney, and Teubal 2004). However, in some other countries (e.g. Japan, Spain and Germany, among others), VCFs tend to support late staged privately held firms (Jeng and Wells 2000; Mayer, Schoors, and Yafeh 2005). Similarly, mixed results are found in terms of the relationship between VC investment and innovation outputs. Kortum and Lerner (2ooo) find that VC investment promotes innovation (measured by patents) based on Us industry-level data. However, using similar US industry-level data, but with a longer time range, Hirukawa and Ueda (2011) find no relationship between patent counts and VC investment. At the firm level, some studies discover positive effects of VC investment on patent generation (Mann and Sager 2o07; Bertoni, Croce, and DAdda 2010), marketing of new products (Hellmann and Puri 2000), and export intensity (Lockett et al. 2008) of entrepreneurial firms. Some other studies find no evidence to prove that VC investment is associated with firms'innovations (Bottazzi and Da Rin 2002; Engel and Keilbach 2007; Arvanitis and Stucki 2014; Mayer, Schoors, and Yafeh 2005). Moreover, Arqué-Castells (2012) discovers that the effects of vC investment on firm innovation appear to be an inverted U-shape over time in Spain. Most existing studies examine the relationship between VC investment and firm innovation without disentangling between the selection and treatment effects. To our knowledge, the study of Lahr and Mina (2016) is the only empirical work that examines the impact of VC investment on firm innovation, distinguishing between selection and treatment effects with a focus on frm patenting activities. This study finds that the positive relationship between VC investment and firm patenting activities is mainly caused by selection rather than ex-post effects. The authors suggest that such results may indicate that patents are used in VC investment primarily as a signal of commercially viable know-hows of entrepreneurial frms at the time of project selection.  \n\nWe still lack a systematic and thorough understanding of the different results from the above empirical studies. However, the mixed results suggest that the impact of VC investment on firm innovation depends on various factors. Above all, the pre-condition for VC investment having positive effects on innovation is that high-tech SMEs, which can generate innovations, are financially constrained, and they may not invest in R&D activities unless they can access external funding from VCs. Investing and implementing R&D activities may involve various costs due to the handling of new resources or reallocation of existing firm resources (Lucas 1967). If a firm chooses to finance itself regardless of whether it gains VC investment or not, the adjustment costs of additional R&D investment will likely become too high. VC investment may exert limited effects on R&D investments or firm innovation in this situation. So, it is expected that the effects of vC investment on firm innovation depend on the severity of entrepreneurs' financial constraints and innovation motivations.  \n\nIn addition, the capabilities and motivations of venture experts, market conditions and institutional environments may influence the effects of VC investment on different types of innovation. It is worth noting that VC, as a particular type of private equity instrument, is not designed to promote innovation but to provide high returns to investors in a market economy (Kortum and Lerner 200o). Therefore, VCFs should only strive to invest and support innovative projects if they foresee that the innovation will be commercialized and translated into a high return that offsets the risk. Thus, the more competent and incentivized the venture experts are, and the more the institutional environment encourages firms to commercialize their innovations, the more likely VCFs are to support and commit to innovations with high levels of uncertainty and information problems. On the other hand, however, the greater the uncertainty in the market is and the more severe the information problems are, the more likely VCFs are to select and support innovations with less uncertainty. The fact that VCFs invest more in early-stage high-tech companies and have a greater impact on firm innovation in the UsA than in Europe generally supports the arguments about the incentives for frms to innovate, the competence and incentives of venture experts, and the information issues as well as institutional environments for innovation in different regions.  \n\nIn China context, Chinese SMEs have suffered from a lack of access to external finance (Gordon and Li 2003; Allen, Qian, and Qian 2005; Guo, Guo, and Jiang 2022). For example, Guo et al. (2014) discovered that private enterprises' bank loan over equity ratios were $0.6\\%$ and $0.8\\%$ in2006and 2010, respectively. Furthermore, Chinese firms generally have higher proportions of short-term debt in their capital structures than firms in other countries (Li, Yue, and Zhao 2oo9). The lack of access to external financing resources and long-run debts suggests that firms in the private sector may face severe liquidity constraints for long-run investment in R&D activities. Therefore, VC investment is a critically important source of funding for high-tech SMEs to pursue innovation activities in China (GuoandJiang2013).  \n\nAt the same time, there is a high degree of uncertainty and severe information problems associated with investing in innovative SMEs in China for a variety of reasons, including the weak IP institutions and law enforcement, the lack of corporate credit and business records, and the absence of standard accounting and auditing systems in this country (Allen, Qian, and Qian 2005; Guo, Guo, and Jiang 2016). With such uncertainty and information issues, we expect VCFs in China to choose and commit to frms with the innovation of lower risks and stronger commercialization potentials.  \n\nOn the other hand, encouraging corporate innovation, especially patenting activities, has become a strategic national policy in China since the late 1980s. Various fiscal policies, including direct R&D subsidies, interest-free loans and tax breaks for innovative firms, have been designed to incentivize firms to invest in R&D activities.4 Firms' patenting activities serve as one of the most important factors for gaining these policy supports (Guo, Guo, and Jiang 2016; Gong and Peng 2018). In China, obtaining government support brings not only direct economic benefits but also political capital that can generate a strong certificate effect, thus helping firms to obtain huge commercial benefits such as follow-up investments or bank loans or government procurement contracts (Guo, Guo, and Jiang 2022). Therefore, although the effects of these favorable policies on the commercialization of technologies are heterogeneous, the number of invention patents granted increased by 97-fold between 2000 and 2016 (Gong and Peng 2018). As a result, both venture experts and entrepreneurs see significant economic and political benefits from continuously generating technological innovations.  \n\nCombining the discussions on the factors affecting the impact of VC investment on firm innovation and the understanding in China contexts, we posit the following hypothesis:  \n\nHypothesis 1a: VC-backed firms outperform non-VC-backed firms in technological and commercialized innovation output.  \n\nHypothesis 1b (ex-ante selection effects of VC investment): More innovative firms are more likely to beselected byVCs.  \n\nHypothesis1c (ex-post effects of VC investment): VC-backed firms generate magnified innovation output after receiving VC investment compared with non-VC-backed ones.  \n\n### 2.3 IPR protection, VC investment and firm innovation  \n\nThe relationship between IPR protection, external financing and innovation is debated among scholars. In this subsection, we will first discuss the existing literature on this issue and then turn to an analysis of the Chinese context and our prediction regarding how IPR protection affects the impacts of VC on innovation in China.  \n\nOn the one hand, IPR protection may positively affect investment in R&D activities and thereby the innovation outputs of the high-tech firms. First, the rationale for external financiers and entrepreneurs to invest in innovations is to seek the profit generated from the innovative products or services. However, it is known that innovations usually generate positive externalities that competitors may have a chance to free ride the intellectual properties of inventors (Nelson 1959). Therefore, investors and entrepreneurs may lack interest in investing in innovations when the imitation costs of competitors are low. In this case, strong protection of IPRs may increase the costs of imitation of competitors so that the investment returns from innovation can be increased (Griliches, Hall, and Pakes 1991). Second, as we have discussed, investment in R&D is associated with a high level of information asymmetries. Such information asymmetry may reduce the incentives of financiers to invest in R&D projects and thereby lead to underinvestment in innovation. This situation is particularly serious when IPRs are not well protected because entrepreneurs may hesitate to provide sufficient confidential information to investors if they expect that the financiers may have a chance to steal their innovative ideas (Ueda 2004). In such a case, strong IPR protection may help mitigate the information issues between financiers and entrepreneurs and thereby stimulate external finance in innovations.  \n\nOn the other hand, IPR protection may be useless or negatively affect external investment in R&D activities and innovation outputs under certain circumstances. Several recent studies argue that some innovations are sequential and complementary so that an inventor payoff may be enhanced by imitation and competition (Scotchmer and Green 1990; Bessen and Maskin 2009). Specifically, these studies suggest that imitation of these innovations can be socially and privately desirable. Imitators may have better ideas to enhance the original inventor innovations, thereby pushing the pace of overall innovation of a sector. Moreover, with inspirations from various imitators, the original inventor may generate more innovations and the future profits from the follow-up innovations may offset the reduced profits caused by imitations. However, as Bessen and Maskin (2009) emphasized, there are two pre-conditions for imitations of sequential innovations to be desirable for inventors, i.e. the entry cost for imitators is not zero and it takes time for imitators to enter so that the inventors can enjoy the returns from the original innovations at least temporarily. In such a case, IPR protection may not help stimulate innovations. Indeed, the empirical analysis presents a mixed picture. Some empirical studies find IPR institutions positively affect innovation (Mansfield, Schwartz, and Wagner 1981; Ang, Cheng, and Wu 2014; Fang, Lerner, and Wu 2017) and technology transfer (Gallini 2002; Branstetter 2006). Some others discover an insignificant or negative relationship between IPR institutions and innovation (Branstetter and Sakakibara 2002; Qian 2007).  \n\nAs far as China is concerned, IPR protection is still a new concept. IPRs were not legally protected until the 1980s, when China became a member of the main international conventions to protect intellectual property rights. Since then, a comprehensive legal framework for protecting trademarks, copyrights and patents has been established by drawing on international standards. Meanwhile, a series of policies and laws focused on strengthening IPR protection has been enacted since 2000. Examples of such policies include The Opinions on Strengthening the Protection and Management of Intellectual Property Rights Related to Science and Technology of China promulgated in 2ooo, and the revised Science and Technology Progress, which took effect in 2007. In addition, as discussed previously, China has been very active in encouraging corporate innovation by offering various incentives to companies that apply for patents. As a result, by the end of 2018, China had granted more than 1.6 million patents for inventions, with 432,000 granted in 2018 alone.  \n\nAlthough legislation for IPR protection is progressing well and patent applications are growing rapidly, it is well documented that enforcement of IPR laws is weak and IPR violations are common in China (Wang 2004). In 2018, more than $35\\%$ of members of the American Chamber of Commerce in China suggested that weak IPR protection is a severe impediment to their R&D investments in this country. 5 In addition, studies discover that IPR enforcement varies significantly across regions in China. For example, Ang, Cheng, and Wu (2014) find that plaintiffs' success rates in IPR infringement casesrangefrom $25\\%$ to $87.5\\%$ across Chinese provinces. Similarly, Fang, Lerner, and Wu (2017) find that the length, cost, and fairness of resolution vary significantly across regions in China. This crossregional variation in IPR enforcement in China is understandable. As Xu (2011) discussed, local authorities have significant power in almost every aspect of local governance under the authoritarian system of regional decentralization, including enforcement and implementation of central government policies. The cross-regional differences in IPR institutions provide an excellent opportunity to estimate, using a quasi-experimental approach, how the impact of VC on firm innovation is sensitive to IPR protection.  \n\nBased on the literature mentioned above and the understanding of IPR protection in China, we argue that the effects of VC investment on firm innovation are positively moderated by IPR protection. On the one hand, the potential risk of IPR infringement is high due to weak IP law enforcement and the low cost of patent imitation in China. On the other hand, suppose technology-oriented firms backed by VC investment are in a region with relatively weak IPR protection. In that case, competitors can easily exploit the benefits of innovation and entrepreneurs may not be willing to share confidential information of their technologies with potential investors, which may discourage external investment in R&D activities and reduce external investment in R&D-intensive frms. As a result, the marginal returns from strong IPR protection are high. On the other hand, it is well documented that Chinese frms lack breakthrough innovations and many firms apply imitation strategy in innovation (Luo, Sun, and Wang 2011). In addition, Chinese companies are known for their ability to quickly emulate the latest technologies through reverse engineering and advanced manufacturing facilities (Luo, Sun, and Wang 2011). At the same time, studies find that imitations, especially creative imitations, may bring about significantly high financial performance in China (Lee and Zhou 2012). As such, the benefits of relaxing IPR protection for sequential and complementary innovation may not apply in China, given that the entry costs for imitators are relatively low and the imitation lead time is short. Hence, inventors may not enjoy the first-mover advantage suffciently before the imitators share the innovation returns. Therefore, we suggest that in China context, strong IPR protection is vital for external financiers to invest in and support innovations of SMEs and therefore magnify the VC investment effects on the entrepreneurial firms' innovation outputs, including the technological and commercialized ones. We posit the following hypothesis:  \n\nHypothesis 2: The positive effects of VC investment on both types of firm innovation are magnified when the IPR protection is stronger.  \n\n### 2.4 VC investment, characteristics of VcFs and firm innovation  \n\nThe characteristics of VCFs may affect the impacts of VC investment on firm innovation. In this study, we focus on two major aspects, i.e. the experience and ownership of VCFs.  \n\nAbove all, vCFs' experience and reputation are suggested to be critically important to determine the investment effects. As we have discussed earlier, innovation is a complex process associated with profound information problems, and it is well documented that investing in innovation is highly risky. The experience of VCFs may determine whether the project screening and monitoring strategies can be implemented well and, therefore, reduce the investment risk. Indeed, Hsu (2004) finds that reputable VCFs may invest in entrepreneurial frms at discounted prices. Petkova et al. (2014) discover that more reputable VCFs invest more in the emerging sector and employ more riskreduction strategies. Meanwhile, Nahata (2008), Krishnan et al. (2011), and Guo, Jiang, and Mai (2015) find that companies backed by more reputable VCFs or VCFs with more experiences are more likely to have better performance at and after IPOs. Furthermore, Atanasov, Ivanov, and Litvak (2012) discover that reputation limits opportunistic behaviors of VCFs towards entrepreneurs.  \n\nAlthough studies have linked the experience of VCFs and entrepreneurial firms' performance, most of them are focused on the financial returns or corporate governance rather than the firms' innovation outputs. For career and reputation concerns, a manager normally hesitates to engage in risky R&D activities because if such projects fail, it is difficult to distinguish whether the outcome is caused by a purely technological failure or by moral hazard issues of the manager. Entrepreneurs' reputation is even more important than that of managers in established companies because startups often require more than one round of investment and many entrepreneurs are serial entrepreneurs. Damage to reputation will lead to significant losses. Therefore, research suggests that increased monitoring from capable institutional investors can provide firms with more incentive to innovate because this insulates managers from the reputational concerns of failure (Aghion, Van Reenen, and Zingales 2013).  \n\nIn China context, information issues are even more severe than those in developed counties, given the lack of credit record systems and weak law enforcement. Therefore, we would expect that the investment professionals' capability to monitor and support entrepreneurial firms is critically essential in VC investment. Indeed, Guo and Jiang (2013) and Guo, Jiang, and Mai (2015) find that VCs' efforts and experience affect entrepreneurial firms' financial performance in the long run. As for innovation incentives, we expect entrepreneurs in China to be even more unwilling to undertake R&D activities with high risks than their counterparts in western countries because of the more severe information issues. Therefore, the experience of VCFs should be potent in determining the R&D decisions and innovation outputs of entrepreneurial frms in this country. Moreover, the experience of VCFs may affect different types of innovations in different ways. More experienced VCFs may have greater ability and motivation to identify a technology commercialization potential and, therefore, have a greater positive impact on commercialized innovation than less experienced VCFs. On the other hand, lacking the ability to judge the commercialization prospects, less experienced VCFs may use a firm patenting behavior as a signal of commercialization potential and thus have a greater influence on a firm patenting activities. We posit the following hypothesis:  \n\nHypothesis 3a: Firms backed VCFs with more investment experience outperform those backed by VCFs with less investment experience in commercialized innovation.  \n\nHypothesis 3b: Firms backed VCFs with less investment experience outperform those backed by VCFs with more investment experience in patenting activities.  \n\nAt the same time, the ownership of VCFs may affect the objectives and governance of VCFs and therefore affect the impact of VC investment. In this study, we focus on comparing GVCFs and their private counterparts. Governments in many countries worldwide promote VC investment (Brander, Egan, and Hellmann 2010). One of the main approaches, especially in Europe and some emerging markets, is the direct creation of GVCFs, with the aim that these state-owned or controlled VCFs can fillthe market gap left by PVCFs by supporting high-tech companies with higher levels of uncertainty and more severe information problems. It has been a long-term debate regarding whether government interventions can be a real solution to the market failure of underinvestment in R&D by forprofit frms. Governments may fail due to rent-seeking issues and bureaucratic inefficiencies, and thereby the public intervention may crowd out private R&D investments (Stiglitz 1988; Lerner 2009).  \n\nEmpirical studies provide inconclusive evidence for the impact of GVCFs. At the aggregate level, some studies find GVCFs complement the PVCFs (Cumming 2007, 2011), while some find GVCFs crowd out private funds (Cumming and Maclntosh 2006; Da Rin, Nicodano, and Sembenelli 2006). Estimations based on firm-level data emerged more recently and similarly, mixed findings are discovered. For instance, a few studies find that GVCFs select promising firms to help them access further external investment (Guerini and Quas 2016) or increase the valuation of these frms (Colombo et al, 2016). Some other studies find that GVCFs have limited effects on the growth (Grilli and Murtinu 2014) and patenting activities (Bertoni and Tykvova 2015) of their portfolio companies in Europe. Moreover, several studies find that GVCFs negatively affect firm productivity (Alperovych, Hubner, and Lobet 2015) or patenting activities (Brander, Egan, and Hellmann 2010).  \n\nThe relationship between GVCFs and firm innovation in China remains understudied. In China, as in many other countries around the world, GVCFs have specific political and social objectives: to support young high-tech companies and stimulate corporate innovation, which can bring positive externalities to society (Suchard, Humphery-Jenner, and Cao 2021). Above all, we expect that both GVCFs and PVCFs positively affect firm innovation because of the severe financial constraints faced by entrepreneurs and the strong public policy to encourage firm innovation, as we have discussed earlier. However, the two types of VCFs may have different effects on the commercialized innovation and patenting activities of their portfolio companies.  \n\nCompared to PVCFs, GVCFs may have a stronger positive impact on firms' patenting activity. As we have discussed earlier, encouraging corporate innovation is one of the primary goals for establishing GVCFs. Moreover, patents have been regarded as one of the most critical measures for firm innovation in the past years (Gong and Peng 2018). How well the portfolio companies do in patenting serves as an essential performance measurement for GVCFs (Guo 2010). Moreover, venture capitalists of GVCFs may be less capable and have lower incentives to take high-level risks and identify the commercialization potentials due to $\\mathsf{S O E S^{\\prime}}$ lower-powered incentive schemes and bureaucratic organizational structure $(\\mathsf{X u}2011$ ; Guo et al. 2021). Thus, both political pressure and the organizational nature of GVCFs dictate that GVCFs may be inclined to invest and provide more effort to help firms with more active patenting activities because patents are more visible, easier to measure and verify, and more likely to be recognized by the higher authorities of GVCFs. As a contrast, as we have discussed earlier, PVCFs may only commit to technology when they see the commercial promises of such technology. We therefore expect them to have more impacts on the commercialized innovation of their portfolio firms. We hence posit the following hypothesis:  \n\nHypothesis 3c: Firms backed by GVCFs outperform those backed by PVCFs in technological innovation measured by patenting activities.  \n\nHypothesis 3d: Firms backed by PVCFs outperform those backed by GVCFs in commercialized innovation.  \n\n## 3. Data and samples  \n\n### 3.1 Data sources  \n\nThe data in this study mainly come from four sources, namely, Above-scale Industrial Firms Panel 1998-2007 (ASIFP), VentureXpert, State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO), and European Patent Office (EPO). First, firm-level data on financial information, sales from new products, exports, and other firm-specific characteristics are obtained from ASIFP, published annually by the National Bureau of Statistics of China from 1998 until 2007.6 This database consists of virtually all stateowned manufacturing firms and non-SOEs with annual sales of at least RMB 5 million. One limitation of ASIFP is that it does not include non-state firms with less than RMB 5 million sales. One potential concern with such limitation is that VCs are interested in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); estimations based on the ASIFP dataset may cause biases if such SMEs are missed in the data. To estimate whether the limitation of ASiFP may cause severe biases for our estimations, we compare the data in ASIFP 2004 with those in the Chinese Economic Census conducted in 2004. The comparison shows that the enterprises covered by this database account for $90\\%$ ofthetotalsalesof all industrial firms in China.7 For the period 1998-2007, approximately $84\\%$ of the firms in the sample were small or micro-enterprises according to the standard released by the Chinese government; thus, most of the firms covered in the ASIFP database are SMEs.8 Another limitation of the ASIFP database is that it only covers manufacturing firms. However, VC investment is concentrated on the service sector such as software, Al, online commerce and entertainment, and the Internet of Things. So, our analysis will not capture the innovation of those companies, which calls for concerns of lack of representativeness. However, we also realize the limitations of the current academic analysis in measuring innovation outputs for the service sector. The usually applied observable measurements may not reflect many innovations of the service sector (e.g. new products sales, patents and patent citations, etc.); instead, they are embedded in trade secrets, process innovation or business model innovations that can hardly be accessed. The advantage of using ASlFP data is that we may have more observable and more accessible measurements for innovation for manufacturing firms.  \n\nSecond, the investment information for VC-backed firms comes from VentureXpert. For each VCbacked firm, the dataset includes the name, location, industry (in four digits) of the firm, the total amount of venture investment gained by the firm, the number of vCFs involved in each deal, and the number of venture financing rounds for each firm. In addition, for each vCF, the dataset provides information on its age, location, and the number of funds under management.  \n\nThird, patent data are obtained from the SIPO and EPO. The SIPO database provides complete information on all patents granted in China, including the application and publication number of the patent, application and grant year, IPC classification number, type of the patent, and assignee of the patent. EPO provides information on the citation of patents across the world.  \n\n### 3.2 Data matching and samples  \n\nThe first challenge of this study is data matching because we utilize data from various sources, and the names of the firms listed in the four databases may not be entirely consistent. First, we need to match the list of VC-backed firms in the VentureXpert with the list in the ASiFP database to identify which firms in the ASiFP database have won VC investment and obtain detailed financial information for these firms. We also need to match the firms in the ASIFP database with those in SIPO and EPO patent databases to identify patent information for all frms in the estimations. We generally borrow data matching strategies used by the NBER Patent Data Project? (NBER Project) to ensure matching accuracy.  \n\nOverall, our basic sample contains two parts: VC-backed frms and randomly matched non-VCbacked frms. We first match the data from VentureXpert and ASIFP to obtain detailed financial information for VC-backed firms for each year. As the first step, we extract a list of 2,527 VC-backed firms that received their first VC investment before January 2011 from the VentureXpert database. The firm names listed in VentuerXpert are in English; thus, we first confirm their Chinese names through websites and other online sources. As a result, we obtain the Chinese names of 2,518 firms. Next, we standardize firm names in both databases and create a 'standard name' for each firm in the two databases by removing the punctuations, spaces, or other special characters (e.g. $:\\%\\wedge\\&\\cdot=[\\varLambda\\rangle,$ etc.) and by standardizing the legal entity identifiers (e.g. we converted Limited into Ltd.), using similar algorithms used by NBER Project. We then created a 'stem name' for all firms by removing all legal entity identifiers in firm names (e.g. a firm called Long Cheng Logistics Ltd' is changed to Long Cheng Logistics). Afterward, we match the Venturexpert data with ASIFP data by the standard names, locations (at city level), and the industries of firms using computerized matching to generate a matched file called 'full matching'. Subsequently, we match VC-backed frms with the ASIFP database using 'stem names', locations (at city level), and industries of the firms to generate a matched file called 'partial matching'.1° We then combine the matching results of the two matching approaches and delete duplicates by using identical legal person codes of each firm by year. After computerized matching, we cross-check the matching results manually to ensure accuracy using Google and Baidu search engines.  \n\nAfter the matching mentioned above, we identify 847 VC-backed firms covered by ASIFP, which obtained their first round of VC investment before 2011. The sharp decrease in the number of firms reflects the presence of numerous VC-backed firms in the Internet service or software-related industries, which are not included in ASiFP. We then further trim the sample by excluding frms that received their first round of VC investments after 2007, leaving a sample of 311 frms. The reason is that ASIFP data is only available between 1998 and 2007. So, for those firms which obtained their first round of VC investment after 2oo7, we will not be able to access the firm-level financial data after they obtained the VC investment. As our estimates focus on the difference-in-difference comparison for the innovation outputs for firms before and after gaining the VC investment, losing the firm-level information for the ex-post VC investment period would not allow us to apply the DiD estimates. We therefore have to exclude those observations. We also need to exclude VC-backed firms for which ASIFP does not have financial information in the year before gaining their first round of VC investment because we need such information for the DiD matching. So, eventually, 268 VCbacked firms covered by AsIFP are left for our estimations. The final sample represents approximately $50\\%$ of all manufacturing firms in China that received venture investment between 1998 and 2007.11  \n\nAdditionally, to examine the effects of vC investment, we need to construct a control group of firms that did not receive VC (i.e. non-VC-backed firms). To define this control group, for each VCbacked firm, we select all potentially matchable non-VC-backed firms from ASiFP to first construct a potential matching sample through a pre-filtering with the following characteristics: same industry (at the two-digit SIC level), same location (at the provincial level), similar firm age (the difference in terms of firm age between VC-backed and non-VC-backed firms is not larger than one year), and similar firm size (the difference in terms of the total number of employees is not larger than $10\\%$ of VC-backed firms' size) at the time of VC investment, following the existing studies (Croce, Marti, and Murtinu 2013; Grilli and Murtinu 2014; Colombo and Murtinu 2017; Cumming, Grilli, and Murtinu 2017; Murtinu 2021). Then, for each vC-backed firm, we randomly draw one-to-five matched pairs to build the control group from the potential matching sample of a non-VC-backed firm sample. To ensure that our control group is representative, we repeat this random drawing methodology 15 times. The results have remained consistent.  \n\nTable 1 presents the industry distribution of the sampled VC-backed firms at the two-digit SIC level. VC-backed frms are concentrated in high-tech industries, such as those that produce telecommunication and computer products, electronic and electrical equipment, chemical products, pharmaceutical products, machinery and equipment products, and instrument-related products. Firms in these industries comprise about $60\\%$ of the VC-backed firms sampled. This figure is consistent with the industry distribution of VC-backed firms reported by Zero2IPO 2001-2009). The distribution of the sampled VC-backed firms suggests that our sample fairly represents the entire sample of VC-backed firms.  \n\nAfter identifying VC-backed firms and their non-VC-backed counterparts from ASIFP, we obtain the information on patents and patent citations for each firm in the sample. SIPO database and EPO database offer firm-level patent information. In particular, SIPO provides all patents granted to firms in China since 1985, whereas EPO provides information on the citation of the patents across the world. We first match the data of SIPO and ASIFP to gain information for patents for each firm. The matching between SIPO and ASIFP is similar to that between VentureXpert and ASIFP. After matching, patent information from SIPO, such as the publication number of a patent, is attached to the firms in ASIFP. We then match EPO data with ASIFP using the publication number of the patents, which is identical for each patent listed in the two patent databases. By doing so, we gain patent information for both VC-backed firms and their non-VC-backed counterparts. Given that creating patentable works and applying for a patent take time, we use the filing time of newly granted patents as a basis in panel estimations. We also use the one-year lag of filing time for all estimations to check therobustnessof theresults.  \n\nTable 1.

Industries are presented in 2-digit standard industry codes (2-digit SIC).We report the total number of frms in an industry (# of Firms) and the percentage of firms of an industry in the total sample (Percent).  \n\nA potential concern with patent matching is the miscounting patents generated by firms' subsidiaries. According to the Patent Law of China, organizational patent applicants must provide the registration license while applying to file a patent, suggesting that a firm that applies for patents must be an independent legal entity. Patents applied by subsidiaries that are not registered as independent legal entities will be filed to the parent firms. Similarly, only an independent legal entity will be recognized as an individual frm. Therefore, based on the names and locations of frms (for cross-sectional data matching by year) and legal person codes (for panel construction), our matching approach should not be affected by miscounts for firm subsidiaries.  \n\n### 3.2 Variables  \n\nThe innovation of firms is our primary interest in this study. We examine two aspects of innovation, namely, the technological innovation outputs and the commercialized innovation outputs. We measure technological innovation outputs by the number of newly granted patents of the firm in a given year (Patent) and the increase in the number of patent citations of the firm in a given year (Citation) as derived from SIPO and EPO, respectively. Commercialized innovation outputs are measured by the increase in sales from new products (Dif _New_Prdct) and the increase in exports (Dif_Exports) of the firm in a given year.  \n\nWe are interested in the effects of VC investment on the innovation of entrepreneurial firms within the examination period. Hence, we need a variable to distinguish whether VCs back the firm or not. First, the VC_Dummy variable equals one if the firm is backed by VCs and zero if otherwise. A significantly positive coefficient on this variable implies that VC-backed firms generally have stronger innovation outputs. Second, the VC_Entry dummy variable divides the entire examination period into two parts: before and after venture investment. VC_Entry is equaled zero for the period before the investment is made and one for the period after the investment is made. The value of this variable for the firms in the control group is determined by their pairs in the VC-backed group. We use this variable to test the structural change effect before and after the infusion of VC investment. Finally, we include VC_Post, an interaction term of Vc_ Dummy and vC_Entry, in our regression to test whether the innovation change after the VC investment infused is the same for VC-backed and non-VC-backed firms.  \n\nWe use three variables to capture the level of IPR protection across regions. The first two variables focus on the severity of patent infringement in a region. Patent infringement is not without cost. An infringer will only infringe a patent if he/she expects the penalties for an infringing activity to be lower than the benefits. According to Chinese law, lawsuits on IPRs need to be raised in local courts where the infringement occurs. In regions with stronger IPR protection, the infringement cost should be higher than that in other regions, so the patent infringement is more likely to be deterred (Schankerman and Scotchmer 2001). Serious IPR infringements reflect the lack of proactive and deterrent IPR enforcement in China, especially locally (Stratford 2006; Du, Lu, and Tao 2008). The first variable for IPR protection is the ratio of the total number of patent infringement cases filed over the total number of patents granted in a province each year (denoted as Infringement Filed). The second variable is the ratio of the total number of patent infringement cases closed over the total number of patents granted in a province each year (denoted as Infringement Closed). The lower the two ratios are in a region, the stronger the IPR protection is. The third measurement for IPR protection, as an alternative one, is the IPR index (denoted as IPR_Index) obtained from China Marketization Index (CMl, 1998-2007). The CMl is a set of indices published annually since 1997 to date, constructed based on data from various sources at the provincial level (Fan, Ma, and Wang 2019). One sub-index is the index measuring IPR protection, a weighted score calculated based on the total number of patents fled and granted per R&D professional in a province each year. We understand that this is not an ideal measurement for IPR protection because the number of patents can be driven by other factors. However, there is no doubt that the local IPR law enforcement is essential for patenting activities. We use such a variable to conduct some supplementary estimations for robustness checks. The higher the value of this variable is, the better IPR protection is in that region.  \n\nWe are also interested in how the different types of VCFs add value to their portfolio firms, which necessitates analyzing the investment experience and ownership of the VCFs. VCFs typically syndicate investment, and the lead VCF is intensively involved in the governance of portfolio companies. Hence, we use the information of the lead VCF to measure the experience and ownership of VCFs. Based on literature (Lee and Wahal 2004; Nahata 2008), we define the lead VCF as the firm that makes the largest total investment across all rounds of funding in an entrepreneurial frm. The information for measuring the characteristics of VCFs is obtained from the VentureXpert database.  \n\nWe measure the experience of a VCF in two ways; namely, the age of a VCF and the total number of VC deals a VCF has closed at the time of investing in a specific entrepreneurial firm. The first set of measurements is constructed according to the age of the lead vCF at the time of making the investment. VCFs need to continuously raise new venture funds based on their reputation to survive in the VC market. Therefore, the longer a VCF exists, the greater the number and the larger amount of VC funds it manages, and the more investment deals it closes (Gompers 1996; Lee and Wahal 2004; Gompers and Lerner 1999). On average, the life span of a VC fund is seven to ten years (Gompers and Lerner 1999). However, according to the Yearbook of the National Venture Capital Association), most of VCFs seek an extension of fund management. The average time to liquidation for VC funds is between 12 to 14 years, with $46\\%$ of VCFs taking 15 years or even more to liquidate. VCFs younger than ten years old usually do not liquidate their first VC funds under management and cannot demonstrate their performance to the market, making it difficult to raise many next rounds of fundraising. Therefore, these VCFs should have substantially less investment experience than those which have survived the first ten years and should have secured the next rounds of funding raising. We therefore take ten years as a cut-off for VCF age as a proxy for the experience of a VCF. Dummy variable VCF_Age1 is equal to one if the lead VCF is younger than ten years when the VCbacked firm gained its first VC investment. Otherwise, it is equal to zero. Dummy variable VCF_Age2 is equal to one if the lead VCF is older than ten years when the VC-backed firm gained its first VC investment. Otherwise, it is equal to zero.  \n\nThe second set of measurements for ${\\mathsf{V C F S^{\\prime}}}$ experience is the total number of deals closed by the VCFs when investing in a given firm. As discussed, the larger the number of deals a VCF closes, the more experience it has accumulated. Specifically, we employ 1o0 deals as a cutoff for this measurement. Among the 268 VC-backed firms covered by our sample, 141 firms' lead VCFs $(52.6\\%)$ have closed 100 or more venture deals by the time of the investment, while 127 firms' lead VCFs $(47.39\\%)$ have closed fewer than 1o0 venture deals by the time of the investment. Dummy variable VCF_Comp1 is equal to 1 if the lead VCF has closed fewer than 100 venture deals by the time the investment in a given entrepreneurial firm has been concluded and 0 if otherwise. Likewise, dummy variable VCF_Comp2 is equal to 1 if the lead VCF has closed 100 or more venture deals by the time the investment in a given entrepreneurial firm has been concluded. Otherwise, it is equal to 0.  \n\nFortheownershipof ${\\mathsf{V C F S}},$ we took the names of the lead VCFs from the Venturexpert database and then browsed the websites of every lead VCF to collect the ownership information. Although Venturexpert provides the ownership information for VC funds, i.e. whether a VC fund under the management of a VCF belongs to a government program, it does not provide the ownership information for the VCF. So, we hand collected such data to ensure the accuracy of the estimations. GVCF is a dummy variable that equals one if more than $50\\%$ of the VCF is owned by the state and zero if otherwise. PVcF is also a dummy variable that equals one if the state owns less than $50\\%$ Oof theVCF and zero if otherwise.  \n\nFour control variables, namely, age, size, leverage ratio, and the percentage of state shares of the firm, are included in the analysis. ASIFP provides information on the founding date of firms. We use this information to calculate the Firm Age. Firm size is measured by the total number of employees in a natural logarithm format. We also include the leverage ratio in the estimates. vC investment does not require collateral. However, investing in entrepreneurial firms is associated with severe information and uncertainty issues. Hence, VCs may consider the liquidation value of firms when making investment decisions, inducing them to select frms with low leverage ratios. Leverage is the total liability divided by the total assets of a firm.  \n\nAdditionally, we control the ownership structure of the firm. Major institutional shareholders would affect the extent to which VCs may influence decision-making in their portfolio companies. VCs may prefer firms with fewer state shares because the non-profit-oriented interests of state owners may conflict with their interests. Additionally, state ownership may affect VC governance after the investment is made. State Ownership is the ratio of state-owned stake divided by the firm total equity.  \n\n### 3.4 Summary statistics  \n\nTable 2 provides the summary statistics of VC-backed frms, including means, minimums, maximums, and standard deviations of the variables we are interested in. The average annual sales of VC-backed firms across the panel is RMB 453.5 million. The average annual exports and sales from new products are RMB 102 million and RMB 88 million, respectively. The increases in the annual sales, exports, and sales from new products are also presented. The average increase in annual sales is RMB 104 million, accountingfor $22.9\\%$ of the average annual sales. By contrast, the average increases in exports and sales from new products of VC-backed firms are RMB 27 million $26.4\\%$ of average annual exports) and RMB20 million $(23.2\\%$ of the average annual sales from new products), respectively. In addition, each VC-backed firm has been granted 7.44 patents annually on average. Finally, among 1613 observations of VC-backed firms, 464 $(28.77\\%)$ have been granted patents at least once. Moreover, 104 $(22.41\\%)$ out of 464 observations indicate that other firms have cited the patents at least once.  \n\nTable 2.

We report the total number of observations (Obs), as well as the average (Mean) of exports (Exports), increase of exports (Dif_Exports), new product sales (New_Prdct), increase of new product sales (Dif_New_Prdct), the number of newly granted patents (Patent), and the increase in patent citations (Citation) for each group of frms over the entire period examined, the year of VC entry, and the year afterVC entry.We also present the differences between the two groups of firms (Diff) and the T-statistics.Exports, Dif_Exports, New_Prdct and Dif_New_Prdct are RMB $10\\mathrm{mi}$ $\\#\\#\\#$ $1\\%$ significance;\\*\\*: $5\\%$ significance; \\*: $10\\%$ significance.  \n\nTable3reports the $t$ -test results for the differences in commercialized and technological innovation outputs between VC-backed and non-VC-backed firms. We compare the two groups of firms using the onset of the VC investment. Results show that VC-backed firms have 4.87 times as much export and approximately 9.86 times as much sales from new products as non-VC-backed firms in the VC investment year. Furthermore, VC-backed firms have a significantly higher number of patents than non-VC-backed ones. The number of patents granted to VC-backed firms in the year of investment averages 3.89, whereas the number granted to non-vC-backed ones averages 0.19. Moreover, a significantly higher number of the patents of vC-backed frms have been cited than that of non-VC-backed firms. Lastly, we also observe gaps between VC-backed firms and their non-VC -backed counterparts regarding the increases in exports and sales from new products when the venture investment was made. More importantly, all the observed differences in exports, sales from new products, and the number of newly granted patents have persisted for at least two years after the venture investment was made.  \n\n## 4.

Models (1） and (2) are linear regressions, while Models (3) and (4) are Negative Binomial regressions for panel data. The dependent variables are the increase of exports of a firm in a given year (Dif_Exports), the increase of new product sales of a firm in a given year (Dif_New_Prdct), the number of newly granted patents of a firm in a given year (Patent) and the increase in patent citations of a firm in a year (Citation). VC_Dummy is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the firm is backed by VC and O if otherwise. Ln (Firm Age) is the age of a firm in a given year in a natural logarithm format. Firm size is measured by the total number of employees of the firm in a given year in a natural logarithm format. Leverage is the total liability divided by the total assets of a firm in a given year. State Ownership is the ratio of state-owned stake divided by the total equity of a firm in a given year. Province fixed effects, Industry fixed effects, and Year fixed effects are controlled. Values in parentheses are standard errors; $\\L^{*}=p<0.1$ $^{**}=p<0.05;$ $\\mathtt{\\star\\star\\star}=\\mathtt{p}<0.01$  \n\nwhere $y_{i t}$ is firm $i$ innovation output in year $t,$ including Dif_New_Prdct, Dif_Exports, Patent, and Citation, as we discussed before, VC_Dummy; helps separate VC backed firms from non-VC-backed counterparts. $\\beta$ is the estimated coeffcient capturing the impact of venture investment on firm innovation. $Z_{i t}$ is a vector of firm-level characteristics we control for, and it includes firm size, firm age, leverage and ownership structure. We also incorporate a series of control variables for unobserved heterogeneity at the provincial level (by using regional fixed effects $\\delta_{j}$ ) and at the industry level (by using industry fixed effects $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{n}}_{\\mathrm{m}})$ , and for time trends in firm innovation activities (by using year fixed effects $\\theta_{t})$  \n\nTable 4 shows the results of the regressions specified in Equation (1), which help to compare innovation outputs of VC-backed and their non-VC-backed counterparts. Models (1) and (2) present the linear regressions for firm commercialized innovation outputs measured by the increase of sales from new products and exports. Models (3) and (4) report the count data model estimations (negative binomial regressions) on technological innovation outputs of the firms measured by newly approved patent counts and the increase of citations of the frms' patents. We have controlled year, industry, and regional fixed effects for all the regression models.  \n\nThe coefficients of vc_Dummy are constantly significantly positive across Models (1) to (4), implying that VC-backed firms outperform non-VC-backed ones in innovation as measured by all the different approaches. Model (1) shows the increase in the annual exports of VC-backed firms is higher than that of non-VC-backed counterparts by RMB 23.9 million, and Mode (2) presents that the increase in sales from new products of VC-backed firms is higher than that of their non-VC-backed firms by RMB 17 million yearly. Lastly, Model (3) shows that VC-backed firms annually have 1.7 more newly granted patents than non-VC-backed firms, representing $43.7\\%$ of the number of newly granted patents of the VC-backed firms at the time of receipt the venture investment.  \n\nOverall, Table 4 shows a significant and positive relationship between venture investment and innovation outputs of entrepreneurial firms in China. However, identification concerns remain despite using a matched group of firms as the basis of our estimations and firm-level panel data that may help us rule out the effects of region, industry, and time-specific factors. The primary concern is whether the innovation outperformance of VC-backed firms is driven by VC investment or some other unobservable factors. Several missing variables, aside from VC involvement, may contribute to the improved performance of frms after VC investments are made. These variables include the personality of entrepreneurs, the human resource of the frms, and the market opportunity for VC-backed firms, which may affect the R&D investment and the innovation outputs of frms. If these factors co-exist with venture investment, the effects of venture investment found in Table 4 may be inflated.  \n\nWe address the identification concern with unobservable variables by employing a two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimation procedure to identify venture investment effects. We employ an instrumental variable to predict the probability for a firm to be backed by venture investment in the first stage estimation and then test the effects of the VC investment after the independent variable is instrumented. The instrumental variable is the historical importance of traditional Chinese lineage value measured by the total number of genealogies in logarithm format (denoted as Genealogies) that appeared in a city before 1949. Genealogy information is obtained from http://ouroots.nlc.cn/, an online database covering 30,581 genealogies nationwide constructed by the National Library of China. It is well known that lineage groups play an essential role in the social life of Chinese society, especially in Southern China. As a unique type of community organization, lineage groups coordinate and protect local residents in traditional China (Fei and Fei 1953; Freedman 1966). In addition, such lineage groups with intensive interpersonal relationships and close ties have a high degree of trust and better internal coordination within the community (Coleman 1990; Putnam 2000). Specifically, studies have evident that informal finance has been crucial in business activities (Tsai 2004; ; Ma and Yang 2011;). Moreover, Tsai (2o04) discovers that informal finance in some regions substitutes formal finance in China. In China case, it is very hard to access external finance for entrepreneurial firms, especially for R&D-oriented ones that are engaged with a high level of uncertainty and information issues. Therefore, social trust plays an even more critical role in investing in such projects. We expect informal finance to substitute VC investment for high-tech SMEs in regions with a strong impact on the traditional lineage value, particularly for the early-staged projects. Although the lineage system, as an important institution in Chinese societies, has been eliminated by the Chinese Communist Party since the early 1950s, regions with deep roots of the lineage culture would have survived through the radical political changes (Greif and Tabellini 2015). Therefore, we expect to observe a negative correlation between the number of genealogies that appeared before 1949 in a city and the probability of a frm being backed by VC investment. Meanwhile, the historical importance of the traditional lineage system should not directly affect individual frms' innovation in contemporary China. Therefore, we suggest this is a valid IV for our study.  \n\nTable 5 presents the results of the 2SLS estimations. Panel A shows the first stage estimations, in which we regress VC_Dummy on the set of independent variables, including our instrumental variable. The first stage regressions in Panel A confirm that Genealogies is a statistically qualified instrumental variable because of its significant and negative correlation with VC_Dummy for all the estimates. Panel B of Table 5 shows the results of the second stage regressions. The instrumented vc_Dummy is significantly and positively correlated with all the innovation output measurements. These results are consistent with the results in Table 4, indicating that the differences in the innovation outputs between VC-backed and non-VCbacked frms are driven by venture investment. In sum, using the two-stage Heckman estimation has enabled us to identify the causal impact of vC investment on firm innovation.  \n\nThe results of the 2SLS regressions confirm the effects of VCs on both the commercialized and technological innovation outputs in China, supporting hypothesis 1a. These findings are consistent with some existing studies (e.g. Kortum and Lerner 2000; Hellmann and Puri 2000; Mann and Sager 2007; Lockett et al. 2008; Bertoni, Croce, and DAdda 2010), which find positive effects of VC investment  \n\nTable 5.

Panel A reports the first stage of estimations, in which the dependent variables across the four models are VC_Dummy, a dummy variable equal to 1 if the firm is backed by VCs, and O if otherwise. The instrumental variable is the total number of genealogies that appeared in a city before 1949 in logarithm format (Genealogies). Panel B reports the second stage estimations, in which the independent variables are the instrumented VC_Dummy and the dependent variables are measurements for firm innovation output, i.e.the increase of exports of a firm in a given year (Dif_Exports), the increase of new product sales of a firm in a given year (Dif_New_Prdct),the number of newly granted patents of a firm in a given year (Patent) and the increase in patent citations of a firm in a year (Citation). The control variables of estimations shown in Panel A are the same as those in Panel B. Ln (Firm Age) is the age of a firm in a given year in a natural logarithm format. Firm size is measured by the total number of firm employees in a given year in a natural logarithm format. Leverage is the total liability divided by the total assets of a firm in a given year. State Ownership is the ratio of state-owned stake divided by the total equity of a firm in a given year. Province fixed effects, Industry fixed effects, and Year fixed effects are controlled. Values in parentheses are t-statistics; $^{*}=p<0.1;^{**}=p<0.05;^{***}=p<0.01$ on innovation. However, our estimation results contradict those of studies that find limited or no impact of VC investment on firm innovation, mainly in Europe (Bottazzi and Da Rin 2002; Engel and Keilbach 2007; Arvanitis and Stucki 2014; Mayer, Schoors, and Yafeh 2005). We suggest that the severe financial constraints faced by SMEs and the strong incentives provided by the state for corporate innovation in China play an important role for VCFs in stimulating firm innovation.  \n\n### 4.2 Do VCs select more innovative firms?  \n\nIn the previous subsection, we confirm the positive relationship between venture investment and innovation outputs of firms. This subsection tries to detangle the ex-ante and ex-post effects of venture investment on innovation. We conduct logit regressions with a set of cross-sectional data on the year before the VC investment is made to determine whether VCs choose to invest in more innovative frms. The regression specification is the following:  \n\n$$\n\\log\\left[\\mathfrak{p}_{\\mathrm{i,t}}/\\left(1-\\mathfrak{p}_{\\mathrm{i,t}}\\right)\\right]=a+\\beta\\mathsf{X}_{\\mathrm{i,t}-1}+\\gamma\\mathsf{Z}_{\\mathrm{i,t}-1}+\\delta_{\\mathrm{j}}+\\eta_{m}+\\theta_{\\mathrm{t}}+\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{i,t}}\n$$  \n\nTable 6.

The independent variable is the increase of exports of a firm in a given year (Dif _Exports), the increase of new product sales of a firm in a given year (Dif_New_Prdct), the number of newly granted patents of a firm in a given year (Patent) and the increase in patent citations of a firm in a year (Citation) in Models (1), (2), (3) and (4), respectively. Ln (Firm Age) is the age of a firm in a given year in a natural logarithm format.Firm size is measured by the total number of frm employees in a given year in a natural logarithm format. Leverage is the total liability divided by the total assets of a firm in a given year. State Ownership is the ratio of state-owned stake divided by the total equity of a firm in a given year. Province fixed effects, Industry fixed effects, and Year fixed effects are controlled. Values in parentheses are standard errors; $^{*}=p<0.1$ $^{**}=p<0.05$ $^{***}=p<0.01$  \n\nwhere $p_{i,t}$ is the probability of firm i being backed by V $\\mathsf{C},L o g[p_{i,\\textit{t}}/(1{-}p_{i,\\textit{t}})]$ is the logarithm of the odds. $X_{i},\\mathsf{t}{-}1$ measures firm-level innovation output, and it could be one of Dif_New_Prdct, Dif_Exports, Patent, and Citation. $Z_{i},t-1$ is the same vector as we define in Equation (1). $\\delta_{j},\\eta_{m},$ and $\\theta_{t}$ are used to control regional fixed effects, industry fixed effects, and year fixed effects, respectively.  \n\nTable 6 presents the logit regression results in which vc_ Dummy is the dependent variable. In Models (1) to (4), we separately place the innovation variables into the estimates. Model (1) shows that Vc Dummy is significantly related to the annual increase in a firm exports, indicating that a larger increase of exports increases the probability of a firm being selected by VCs in China. Specifically, if the annual change of export is increased by 6 million (approximately $10\\%$ of the mean of Dif_Exports for VC-backed firms in the VC investment year), it may elevate the probability of such a firm being selected by VCs by $4.1\\%$ . Model (2) reports a significant and positive relationship between the annual increase of sales from new products and venture investment, suggesting that firms are more likely to be backed by vCs if they have track records in bringing more new products to the market. These results are consistent with the findings of Helmann and Hellmann and Puri (2ooo) that were derived from the US market. Specifically, if the increase of annual sales from new products of the firm is increased by 3 million from its mean (approximately $10\\%$ of the mean of Dif_New_Prdct for VC-backed firms in the VC investment year), it may elevate the probability of such a firm to be selected by VCs by $14.4\\%$ . Models (3) and (4) report the relationship between venture investment and technological innovation outputs. We observe significant and positive relationships between Patent and VC Dummy and between Citation and VC Dummy, which suggests that those firms with track records of having more technological innovation outputs tend to be selected by VCs. One more newly granted patent of the firm increases the probability of such a firm being backed by VCs by $8.17\\%$ . The quality of these patents is also a decisive factor, and one more citation of these patents increases the probability of these firms being backed by VCs by $18.1\\%$  \n\nWe also control for the firm leverage ratio, firm size, age, and state share. Firm size is significantly and positively correlated with VC Dummy, which implies that VCs tend to choose larger frms in China with everything else being equal. Furthermore, the leverage ratio is significantly and negatively correlated with vc Dummy, suggesting that firms with a higher leverage ratio may have a lower chance for selection by vCs. Finally, firm age is significantly and positively associated with VC Dummy as shown in Models (1) to (3), and the state ownership is significantly and negatively correlated with vc Dummy as reported in Models (1), (2) and (4).  \n\nAlthough the logit regression results show that the increase of exports and sales from new products, the number of newly granted patents and increased patent citations of firms are strongly and positively correlated with the probability of being backed by VCFs, we cannot conclude that the ex-ante project selection causes these findings. Other unobservable factors may have affected these results. An alternative explanation for these findings is that VCs attract rather than select firms with more innovations. For instance, only entrepreneurial firms with a high level of innovation may seek venture investment because such firms are associated with more uncertainties that diminish the chance to seek other means of external finance. Furthermore, the entrepreneurs who approach vCs may be very innovative and possess the vision and knowledge of the potential added value of vC investment. We cannot rule out these alternative explanations because we have no information on which entrepreneurs seek vC investment or which projects are rejected by vCs.  \n\nTo address this concern, we use in-depth interviews with VCs to explore the causal relationship between VC investment selection and innovation of firms. The interviews were conducted with 37 VCs in China between 2005 and 2006. Guo and Jiang (2013) discussed the interview methodology and sampling strategy. The interview results show that the ex-ante project assessment process is highly selective and results in a very high rejection rate. According to the interviews with 37 VCs from 34 VCFs, on average, only 1.3 out of the 100 business plans submitted to VCs have received investment in China.12 vCs also devote much of their effort to ex-ante project selection. More than $85\\%$ of the interviewed VCs suggest that assessing projects before making investment decisions takes more than three months. These VCs visit entrepreneurial firms more than six times before making investment decisions. VCs assess projects in various ways during the due diligence process, such as visiting the customers and suppliers of frms, tracking the business and personal records of entrepreneurs and management teams, consulting experts in relevant markets, assessing technological improvements, and consulting accounting and auditing firms.  \n\nThe interview results also reveal that VCs consider the technological improvements of entrepreneurial projects as important aspects when making investment decisions. As shown in Table A1, 12 out of the 39 criteria are related to the product and market of entrepreneurial frms. Meanwhile, VCs consider the demonstrated market acceptance and the proprietary of the product or service as the top two most important criteria in terms of the characteristics of the product or service of the project. In addition, the market share growth rate is ranked as the second most important factor among the 39 criteria in project screening identified by VCs. We also ask the VCs to list the essential criteria without which they will reject projects regardless of other aspects. As shown in Table A2, the market growth, market acceptance, and proprietary of products are listed as essential criteria. These three aspects are reflected by sales growth from new products and patent-related measurements in our regression estimations.  \n\nTable 7.

Panel A reports the summary statistics of the PSM control group during the entire examination period. We report the total number of observations (Obs), mean (Mean), standard deviation (SD.), minimum (Min) and maximum (Max) for all the variables of interest. Panel B presents the t-tests (T-stats) of the difference (Dif) in terms of variables of interest for the VC-backed firms and the PSM control group one year before the VC entry. Firm innovation is measured by the increase of exports (Dif_Exports), the increase of new product sales (Dif_New_Prdct), the number of newly granted patents (Patent), and the increase in patent citations (Citation) of a firm in a given year.Firm Size is measured by the total number of employees of a firm in a given year in natural logarithm format; Ln (Firm Age) is the age of a firm in a given year in natural logarithm format; Leverage is the total liability divided by the total assets of a firm in a given year; State Ownership is the ratio of state-owned stake divided by the total equity of a frm in a given year.  \n\nThe interview results suggest that VCs exert considerable efforts in ex-ante project selection and that the selection criteria are consistent with the aspects that we have defined in our regression analysis results. However, we do not claim that the ex-ante project selection process is the sole explanation for our statistical examinations. Instead, we suggest that our interview findings may help us identify the mechanisms that underlie our regression estimates.  \n\nIn sum, companies with better track records in both commercialized and technological innovation outputs have a higher probability of gaining funding from VCs in China. These findings support our hypothesis 1b and are consistent with those of studies that suggest VC investment supports more firms of more uncertainty in the US, Israel and Taiwan (Elango et al. 1995; Gupta and Sapienza 1992; Avnimelech, Kenney, and Teubal 2004; Lahr and Mina 2016). However, such results differ from many findings from Europe, where VC investment tends to choose firms of less uncertainty (Jeng and Wells 2000; Mayer, Schoors, and Yafeh 2005) and has limited ex-ante effects on firm growth (Bertoni, Croce, and DAdda 2010). In particular, our findings on the ex-ante effects of VC investment on both types of firm innovation in China may have two implications. First, venture experts consider both the realized commercialized innovation and technological innovation when making the investment decision to deal with the information issues and uncertainty in China. Second, although information issues in China are serious, venture experts and entrepreneurs foresee great potential for R&D-oriented SMEs to capitalize on their innovations because of the strong state incentives provided to corporate innovation.  \n\n### 4.3Ex-post effects ofVCinvestment on innovation  \n\nThe results from the previous subsections confirm that VC-backed firms outperform non-VC-backed firms in terms of innovation and that part of such outperformance comes from the VC selection efforts.This subsection examines whether ${\\mathsf{V C s}}^{\\prime}$ post-investment monitoring and supporting efforts add value to their portfolio companies. Specifically, we focus on the difference-in-difference estimates of innovation outputs of VC-backed and non-VC-backed firms.  \n\nAs discussed in Subsection 4.2, VCs select firms with more innovation outputs. To capture the difference-in-difference effects, we need to control selection biases. We construct a new control group of non-VC-backed frms using the PSM methodology, in which we match frms with different dimensions (Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983; Chemmanur, Krishnan, and Nandy 2011). In our context, we specifically choose the PSM approach proposed by Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) because this matching method eliminates a significant proportion of the systematic difference in baseline characteristics between treated and untreated subjects than the stratification on propensity score or the covariate adjustment using such a score does (Austin et al. 20o7). The matched firms must be in the same industry (at the two-digit level), the same location, and have a similar level of exports, sales from new products and patents in the year before VCs back them. With the help of one-to-five, nearest-neighbor PSM, we identify non-VCbacked firms in the control group.  \n\nIn total, we have a sample of 1328 firms in the PSM control group. The summary statistics of the PSM control group during the whole examination period are presented in Panel A of Table 7. Panel B of Table 7 presents the t-tests of the variables of interest for the VC-backed firms and the PSM control group one year before the VC entry. It shows that there is no significant difference between the two groups regarding annual sales, an annual increase of exports, an annual increase of sales from new products, newly granted patents, and an annual increase of patent citations, indicating that firms in the PSM control group are similar to VC-backed frms before the VC entry.13 The PSM method helps alleviate selection biases caused by observed factors.  \n\nBased on this control group matched by propensity scores, we estimate the ex-post effects of venture investment. The regression model is as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\mathsf{y}_{\\mathrm{it}}=a+\\beta\\mathsf{V C}\\_\\mathsf{D u m m y}_{i}+\\beta_{1}\\mathsf{V C}\\_\\mathsf{F n t r y}_{\\mathrm{it}}+\\beta_{2}\\mathsf{V C}\\_\\mathsf{P o s t}_{\\mathrm{it}}+\\gamma Z_{\\mathrm{it}}+\\delta_{\\mathrm{j}}+\\theta_{\\mathrm{t}}+\\eta_{\\mathrm{m}}+\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{it}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $y_{i t}V C\\_D u m m y_{i},Z_{i t},\\delta_{j},\\upeta_{\\mathrm{{m}}},$ and $\\theta_{t}$ are defined exactly the same as they are in Equation (1). $V C\\_E n t r y_{i t}$ helps separate the whole period into before and after the VC investment. $V C\\_P o s t_{i t}$ is the interaction term of VC_Dummy; and $V C\\_E n t r y_{i t},$ and its coefficient $(\\beta_{2})$ captures both the betweengroup and within-group differences (i.e. the difference-in-difference) in terms of the effects of venture investment on frms' innovation output. A significantly positive coefficient of $V C\\_P o s t_{i t}$ indicates that VC-backed firms experience a magnified increase in post-investment innovation compared with non-VC-backed firms.  \n\nTable 8 shows the estimated innovation outputs of VC-backed and non-VC-backed firms matched using the PSM approach. We observe a significant and positive relationship between VC_Post and the increase in annual exports and sales from new products in Model (1) and (2), respectively. Such results indicate that firms experience a magnified increase in both exports and sales from new products after VC investment. After the VC investment, the treatment effect is increased by RMB 11.5 million for the annual increase in export and RMB 12.1 million for the annual increase in sales from new products. In addition, Model (3) shows that VC_Post is significantly and positively associated with the number of newly granted patents. This result indicates that firms experience magnified improvements in their technological innovations after VC investment. Specifically, after VC investment, the treatment effect of VC investment in terms of the number of newly granted patents increasesby0.385.  \n\nTable 8.

Values in parentheses are standard errors; ${\\bf\\nabla}^{*}=p$ $<0.1$ $^{**}=p<0.05$ $^{***}=p<0.01$  \n\nThe above estimates suggest that the outperformance of VC-backed firms in terms of commercialized and technological innovation outputs is further magnified. We observe ex-post effects of venture investment on exports, sales from new products, and the number of newly granted patents in China. These results support hypothesis 1c and contradict the findings of Lahr and Mina (2016), who find no ex-post effects of VC investment on firm patenting activities in the Us. We suggest that two primary reasons may drive the differences. First, as we have discussed, the information problem in China is so severe that VCFs must monitor their portfolio companies after investment and set milestones for commercialization of innovations and patenting activities to validate and certify the future financial promise of these companies. Second, R&D-oriented firms, especially those in the private sector, may face much more severe financial constraints than their counterparts in developed economies that the availability of VC investment has significantly long-lasting effects on them.  \n\n## 5. IPR protection, characteristics of VCFs and VC effects  \n\n### 5.1 IPR protection and the impact of VC investment  \n\nThis subsection explores the heterogeneous effects of VC investment focusing on IPR protection. The regressionmodelsareasfollows:  \n\n$$\n\\mathsf{y}_{\\mathrm{it}}=a+\\beta\\mathsf{V C}\\mathrm{{.Dummy}}_{\\mathrm{i}}+\\beta_{1}\\mathsf{I P R}_{\\mathrm{jt}}+\\beta_{2}\\mathsf{V C}\\mathrm{{.Dummy}}_{\\mathrm{is}}\\mathsf{I P R}_{\\mathrm{jt}}+\\gamma Z_{\\mathrm{it}}+\\delta_{\\mathrm{j}}+\\theta_{\\mathrm{t}}+\\eta_{\\mathsf{m}}+\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{it}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $y_{i t}V C\\_D u m m y_{i,}Z_{i t},\\delta_{j{'}}\\eta_{m},$ and $\\theta_{t}$ are defined exactly the same as they are in Equation (1). $I P R_{j t}$   \nmeasureslocation $j$ IPR protection at time t.  \n\nAs discussed in Section 2, we expect to observe that VC effects on firm innovation are stronger in regions with better IPR institutions in China. Table 9 presents the results of the regression estimations. In these regressions, we add a dummy variable, i.e. VC_Dummy, to differentiate VC-backed firms from non-VC-backed firms. We further add two more variables, i.e. the measurements of IPR protection and the interaction term between VC_Dummy and the measurements of IPR protection. With the interaction terms included in the regression model, we aim to capture the sensitivity of the VC effects on firm innovation to IPR institutions. Panel A presents the results in which IPR protection is measured by Infringement_Filed, and Panel B reports the results in which IPR protection is measured by Infringement_Closed, respectively. As shown in Panel A, the coefficients of VC_Dummy are constantly and significantly positive across all the estimations for firm innovation measured by all ways, confirming the positive effects of vC investment in firm innovation. At the same time, the interaction terms between Infringement_ Filed and vc_Dummy are significantly and negatively associated with most of the variables measuring firm innovation, including the increase of sales from new projects and exports and the number of newly granted patents. We observe similar results when IPR protection is measured by the ratio of the number of infringement cases closed over the total number of patents granted in a province each year. Such results suggest that the VC effects on firm innovation are weakened when the patent infringement rate is high. As discussed earlier, we conduct a set of robustness checks using an alternative IPR protection measurement, namely the IPR index published by the CMl between 1998 and 2007. The results are presented in Table A3. It shows that results are similar to thosereported inTable 9.  \n\nThe results shown in Table 9 and Table A3 support hypothesis 2, which predicts VC effects are strengthened on firm innovation when IPR protection is strong. These findings suggest that with weak IPR protection in China in general that competitors can easily exploit the benefits of innovation, the marginal returns from stronger IPR protection are high, consistent with the theories of Griliches, Hall, and Pakes (1991) and Ueda (2004). However, our empirical results suggest that the arguments of Bessen and Maskin (2009) regarding the benefits of imitation do not seem to be valid in China when the overall IPR protection isweak.  \n\n### 5.2 Characteristics of VCFs and the impact of VC investment  \n\nIn this subsection, we investigate how the impact of VC investment depends on the characteristics of VCFs. The regression models are as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\mathsf{y}_{\\mathrm{it}}=a+\\beta\\mathsf{V C F}_{-}\\mathsf{E X P}_{\\mathrm{i}}+\\gamma\\mathsf{Z}_{\\mathrm{it}}+\\delta_{\\mathrm{j}}+\\theta_{\\mathrm{t}}+\\eta_{\\mathrm{m}}+\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{it}}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\mathsf{y}_{\\mathrm{it}}=a+\\beta\\mathsf{N C F}\\_\\mathsf{O w n e r s h i p}_{\\mathrm{i}}+\\gamma\\mathsf{Z}_{\\mathrm{it}}+\\delta_{\\mathrm{j}}+\\theta_{\\mathrm{t}}+\\eta_{\\mathrm{m}}+\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{it}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $y_{i t}\\mathbb{Z}_{i t}\\delta_{j},\\eta_{m},$ and $\\theta_{t}$ are defined exactly the same as they are in Equation (1). The expertise of the lead VCF is measured by $V C F\\_E X P_{i} $ . The value of this variable is defined as O for non-VC-backed firms. It could be either ${\\mathsf{V C F S^{\\prime}}}$ age or the total number of closed investment deals. The ownership structure of the lead VCF is measured by VCF_Ownership. The value of this variable is equal to O for non-VCbacked firms.  \n\nTable 10 reports the regression results for the relationship between firm innovation and the experience of VCFs. Panel A shows the effects of ${\\mathsf{V C F S}}^{\\prime}$ age on firms' innovation outputs. Both VC_Age1 and vc_Age2 are significantly and positively related to all the innovation output measurements. Panel B focuses on the effects of VCFs' experience, measured by the total number of closed investment deals at the time of investment. Similarly, we observe that both the Vc_Comp1 and VC_ Comp2 are constantly and positively associated with the firm innovation measured by all means. The above results indicate that regardless of the experiences of the lead VCF, VC-backed firms generate higher commercialized and technological innovations compared with non-vC-backed firms, consistent with the results shown in Tables 4 and 5. However, we observe that the effects of ${\\mathsf{V C F S}}^{\\prime}$ experience differ for commercialized and technological innovations. Specifically, we observe that the coefficients of Vc_Age 2 and Vc_ Comp2 are constantly much larger than those of Vc_Age1 and vc_ Comp1 in estimations on the commercialized innovation output, i.e. the increase of new  \n\nTable 9.

VC_Age1 equals one if the lead VCF is younger than 10 years when the VC-backed firm gained its first VC investment and equals zero if otherwise.VC_Age2 equals one if the lead VCF is older than ten years when the VC-backed firm gained its first VC investment and equals zero if otherwise. Panel B reports the results in which ${\\mathsf{V C F S}}^{\\prime}$ experienceis measured by the number of deals closed by the VCF.

For instance, Models (1) and (2) of Panel A show that firms backed by VCFs younger than ten years gain RMB 16.4 and 12.4 million more increase in exports and new products sales, respectively. However, firms backed by VCFs older than ten years enjoy 31.1 and 21.4 million more increase in exports and new products sales, respectively. Similar trends are found with the estimations on the effects of VCFs' experience measured by the total deals closed before the specific investment. These results suggest that the more experienced the lead VCF is, the more likely the VC-backed frms generate more commercialized innovation output. However, we observe different patterns from the estimations for firms' technological innovation. We find that the coefficients of VC_Age2 and VC_Comp2 are smaller than those of VC_Age1 and VC_Comp1 in most of the estimates on technological innovation output measured by the number of newly granted patents and the increased frequency of patent citations, expect for Model (3) of Panel A. Such results suggest that although vC-backed firms generate a higher number of patents and their patents are cited more than non-VC-backed ones, firms backed by more experienced VCFs generate fewer technological innovations than those backed by less experienced ones. A potential explanation is that with more experience in the Chinese market, VCs realize that patents may not be well protected under the weak enforcement of IRP, and they focus more on monitoring and supporting firms to commercialize their innovative ideas as soon as possible than those VCFs with less experience. Meanwhile, VCFs with less experience may focus more on the number of patents and citations as they are more observable and easier to measure than the market performance of the innovations. In all, these results are partially consistent with the prediction of hypotheses 3a and 3b and the findings from developed economies in the existing literature (e.g. Nahata 2008; Krishnan et al. 2011).  \n\nTable 11 reports the regression results for the relationship between firm innovation and the ownership structure of VCFs, which show that PVCF and GVCF are constantly and positively associated with the firm innovation measured by all means. However, the coeffcients of PVcF are constantly much larger than those of GVcF in estimations on the commercialized innovation output, i.e. the increase of new product sales and the increase of exports of a firm. For instance, Models (1) and (2) show that frms backed by PVCFs enjoy RMB 31.6 and 16.8 million more increase in exports and new products sales, respectively. However, firms backed by GVCFs gain 18.2 and 15 million more in exports and new products sales, respectively. These results show that frms backed by PVCFs generate more commercialized innovation output, supporting hypothesis 3d.  \n\nTable 11.

Specifically, Models (3) and (4) show that firms backed by PVCFs generate 1.68 and 2.54 more patents and citations, while those backed by GVCFs generate 1.88 and 3.12 more patents and citations. These findings support hypothesis 3c that firms backed by GVCFs outperform those backed by PVCFs in technological innovation.  \n\nThe results shown in Table 11 are in some sense consistent with the findings of several studies which find that government VC programs or GVCFs have positive effects on frm innovation either at industry or frm-level in the USA and Australia (Kortum and Lerner 2000; Cumming 2007; Colombo and Murtinu 2017). However, they contradict other studies' discoveries that find VC investment has limited or even negative effects on firm innovation in Europe and Canada (e.g. Cumming and Maclntosh 2006; Da Rin, Nicodano, and Sembenelli 2006; Brander, Egan, and Hellmann 2010; Bertoni and Tykvova 2015). We suggest that, on the one hand, the severe financial constraints and the strong state incentives for corporate innovation determine that the equity investment from either GVCFs or PVCFs is ultimately important for frms to initiate R&D activities that help them enhance innovation output. On the other hand, the strong political and social pressure carried by GVCFs, as well as the lack of incentives and investment capacity, may prompt GVCFs to focus on patent activities of the companies they invest in, as patents are more visible, easier to measure and validate, and more likely to be recognized by the higher authorities compared to the commercialized innovation.  \n\n## 6. Conclusion  \n\nThis study examines the contributions of vC investment to innovation outputs of entrepreneurial frms in China. By analyzing frm-level panel data, we find that VCs contribute to the commercialized and technological innovation outputs of entrepreneurial frms in China. We use 2SLS estimations to address identification issues, and our results have remained robust. These findings are consistent with some existing studies (e.g. Kortum and Lerner 2o00; Hellmann and Puri 2000; Mann and Sager 2007; Lockett et al. 2008; Bertoni, Croce, and DAdda 201o), which find positive effects of vC investment on innovation. However, our estimations' results contradict those of studies that find limited or no impact of VC investment on firm innovation, mainly in Europe (Bottazzi and Da Rin 2002; Engel and Keilbach 2007; Arvanitis and Stucki 2014; Mayer, Schoors, and Yafeh 2005). We suggest that the severe financial constraints faced by SMEs and the strong incentives provided by the state for corporate innovation in China play an important role for VCFs in stimulating firm innovation. Moreover, we distinguish the selection and ex-post effects of vC investment and confirm that VC investment has significant impacts on the innovation of entrepreneurial frms in two ways. First, VCFs in China select more innovative frms. Second, VC-backed frms experience a magnified improvement in their innovation after the VC investment. These results are partially consistent with Lahr and Mina (2016), who find only selection effects but no ex-post effects of VC investment on frm patenting activities in the Us. We suggest that with more severe information problems in China, VCFs may have to put more effort both before and after the investment is made than their counterparts in the Us, thereby having both selection and treatment effects on their portfolio companies. Additionally, R&D-oriented SMEs in China may face much more severe financial constraints than their counterparts in the UsA, and the availability of VC investment has significantly long-lasting effects on them.  \n\nWe also observe that the effects of vCs are heterogeneous, depending on both the institutional environments and the features of VCFs. VC effects on firm innovation significantly stronger when the IPR protection is stronger. At the same time, firms backed by more-experienced VCFs generate more commercialized innovation outputs but fewer technological innovation outputs than those backed by less-experienced VCFs. Finally, firms backed by GVCFs are more productive in patenting activities but less productive in generating commercialized innovation outputs than those backed by PVCFs. The findings in this study evident that the impact of VC investment varies under different institutional environments. In particular, IPR institutions, the institutional environments for controlling information issues, and government engagement in the VC market play an important role in determining the effects of VC investment on firm innovation.  \n\nThis study contributes to the literature on VC investment in several aspects. This study is the first to systematically estimate the contribution of vC investment to the innovation of entrepreneurial firms in China, where financial and legal systems are significantly different from those of Western countries. It extends the findings of previous studies by exploring factors that influence the effects of vC investment with a focus on both external institutional environments and the features of VCFs. Using a difference-in-difference approach based on cross-regional variations within the same country, this study is among the first that links private equity investment, IPR institutions, and firm innovation, ruling out the potential biases caused by cross-country studies. This study, therefore, contributes to the debating literature on IPR institutions, R&D investment and innovation with evidence from the Chinese private equity market (Gallini 2002; Branstetter and Sakakibara 2002; Branstetter 2006; Qian 2007; Ang, Cheng, and Wu 2014; Fang, Lerner, and Wu 2017). Furthermore, following Chemmanur, Krishnan, and Nandy (2011) and Guo and Jiang (2013), the current study is among the first that attempts to answer a puzzling question earlier raised by Kortum and Lerner (2ooo): ‘lf vC-backed firms outperform non-vC-backed frms, does the advantage come from ex-ante project selection or monitoring and control after the investment is made?' Finally, we add the existing studies on the relationship between the characteristics of VCFs and the impact of VC investment by providing evidence on how different experiences and ownership of VCFs affect different types of firm innovation in various ways.  \n\nSome limitations of this study and potential questions for future research are worthwhile to mention. Above all, the estimations of VC investment and innovation are just up to 2007 because of the constraints of data sources. China VC market and the innovation systems have experienced significant changes since then, and more updated data may help explore more insights regarding the institutional impacts on the effect of vC investment on innovation. However, it is important to note that the theoretical nature of the research questions focused on in this study and the corresponding empirical findings (i.e. the impact of vC investment on firm innovation and the mechanisms by which vC investment works under different institutional environments that provide different incentives to entrepreneurs and venture experts) are time- and context independent. Therefore, we suggest that such limitations should not have significant impacts on the contributions of this study. In addition, we can only focus on manufacturing frms in this study because of the data constraints. It is ideal if the effects of VC investment on the service sector can be studied in future research. Finally, other institutional factors and other features of VCFs (e.g. the relationship between VCFs and local and central governments, the governance efficiency of vCFs, etc.) and entrepreneurial firms' characteristics should be examined in the future.  \n\nThis study has significant implications for policymaking and business practice. By identifying different conditions under which the impact of VC investment vary, this study suggests that the factors including financial constraints entrepreneurs face, the information issues associated with investing in high-tech SMEs, the IPR institutions, the government engagement in R&D activities as well as the experience of VCFs may all influence the effects of VC investment on firm innovation. Policymakers need to consider the local contexts when they make decisions for stimulating the local VC market to maximize the impact of VC investment (Lerner and Nanda 2020). Meanwhile, given that the Chinese VC market is the fastest growing one in the world and the innovation capacity and sustainability of the Chinese economy is one of the most critical concerns of the globe, understanding the private equity market and the innovation system in this country is ultimately important for policymakers to consider how they should prepare for the potential dominance or the uncertainty associated with the financial markets and the innovation system of this country. Finally, this study provides helpful information for investors and entrepreneurs regarding what conditions they may gain more in terms of financial outcomes and technological aspects of innovation.  \n\n## Notes  \n\n1.

ASIFP data are available for the years between 1998 and 2009. However, we chose not to use the data for 2008 and 2009 because of two major reasons. First, the data quality for years 2008 and 2009 is poor. For example, the legal person ID of firms, which is the only information for identifying the same firm accurately for the panel data, is not available in the data for 2008. In addition, we noted missing variables in the data for years 2008 and 2009. One missing variable is state-owned capital, which is one of our control variables. Important financial information, such as sales income, is missing as well. Additionally, the year 2009, the number of observations dropped significantly (frommore than $400\\textsf{K}$ in 2008 to320 Kin 2009).We suspect that the sample does not represent the full sample of the above-scale manufacturing firms in China. All existing studies in China that used this dataset did not adopt the data in 2008 and 2009 to ensure the consistency of the estimations (e.g. Hsieh and Klenow, 2009; Guariglia, Liu, and Song 2011; Brandt, Zhang, and Zhang 2012). Second, we did not use the data for years 2008 and 2009 because of the financial crisis in 2008. Many other external shocks, including the crisis itself and the sequential stimulus packages after 2008, could cause noises in our estimations. Hence, we chose to limit our data between 1998 and 2007 for the examinations. 7. In the first Chinese Economic Census conducted in 2o04, the amount of the total sales for all industrial firms was RMB 218 billion, whereas that of the total sales for all ASIFP frms was RMB 196 billion.   \n8. In China, enterprises with employment of less than 300 people or annual sales of less than RMB 20 million are classified as small enterprises. Enterprises with employment of less than 20 people or annual sales of less than RMB 3 million are classified as micro enterprises.   \n9. For more detailed methodology and the codes of patent matching of the NBER Patent Data Project, please refer to https://sites.google.com/site/patentdataproject/Home.   \n10. We use'stem names' to conduct the matching in order to capture potential missed cases during matching using 'standard names' (we might not have exhausted all expressions of the legal entity identifiers and converted them into standard identifiers when we created 'standard names').   \n11. According to our data sorting on VentureXpert database, there are about 540 manufacturing firms gaining their first round of VC investment between 1998 and 2007.   \n12. The interviewees were asked about the percentages of the business plans submitted to them that eventually gain the investment in the interview. According to the interviews with the 37 VCs from 34 VCFs, the minimum was $0.6\\%$ whilethemaximumwas $2.5\\%$ Themeansuccessratewas $1.3\\%$  \n\n13. We also conduct balancing tests for each variable of interest by year (results are provided by request). The t-statistics of the balance tests show that firms in control group matched by PSM are similar to VC-backed firms at the time of VC backing in all the relevant aspects that may predict the probability of a firm being picked up by VCs.  \n\n## Disclosure Statement  \n\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).  \n\n## References  \n\nAghion, P., J.

We focus on an important form of intangible resource—firm reputation—and examine how it affects a firm's propensity to form alliances. We propose an inverted $U$ shapedrelationship between a firm's reputation and its likelihood of alliance formation, resulting from the opposing mechanisms of opportunity and need. We also examine how this relationship may vary across two contingencies: (1) foreign and domestic firms; and (2） different levels of institutional development. Empirical analyses of China's venture capital (VC) industry provide support for ourhypotheses.Copyright $\\copyright$ 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.  \n\n### INTRODUCTION  \n\nDespite the prevalence of alliances in today's business world (Baum, Calabrese, and Silverman, 2000; Chung, Singh, and Kyungmook, 2000; Gulati, 2009), considerable variance in firms' use of partnerships continues to occur. Although previous studies have demonstrated the role of organizational resources as important drivers of alliance formation, such studies disagree on the specific roles these resources play. One research stream focuses on the need for alliances. It suggests that firms with weak resources face a greater need to form or join an alliance (Hennart, 1988; Aldrich and Fiol, 1994). The other stream emphasizes alliance opportunities. It argues that firms in a strong resource position are more likely to enter into an alliance given the opportunities available to them (Gulati, 1999; Chung et al., 2000). Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven (1996) and Ahuja (2000) were among the first researchers to incorporate both need and opportunity perspectives in studying alliance formation. Nonetheless, such research continues to emphasize the logic of opportunity in assessing the role of resources. For example, Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven (1996) use firms’ resource conditions to elucidate opportunity, but they use external factors, such as market competition and pioneering technology, to explain need. Ahuja (2000) demonstrates that firm resources positively affect alliance formation through the opportunity mechanism, but provides unclear empirical evidence for the need mechanism. As such, previous studies fall short in terms of developing a truly integrative framework of how firms’ resources shape their decisions of alliance formation. How do opportunity and need interact to determine the ultimate effects of resources on alliance formation? Under what conditions will the opportunity effect outweigh the need effect or vice versa? These unanswered questions prompt a closer examination of the relationship between organizational resources and alliance formation.  \n\nTo unravel the complex mechanisms of alliance formation, this article focuses on an important intangible resource—firm reputation——-and examines its effect on the creation of partnerships. On the basis of the contrasting mechanisms of opportunity and need, we propose a curvilinear relationship between a firm's reputation and its likelihood to form an alliance. The threshold of the curvilinear relationship depends on whether a reputation's positive effect through the opportunity mechanism outweighs its negative effect through the need mechanism. To further elucidate how reputation affects a firm's propensity to form alliances, we examine two contingencies. First, we distinguish firm ownership by foreign and domestic firms in the context of emerging economies. Second, we identify the level of institutional  development as another key  contingency for the relationship between reputation and alliance formation. We expect the underlying mechanisms of reputation to vary between foreign and domestic firms and across different stages of institutional development.  \n\nThis study uses China's venture capital (VC) industry as our empirical context, and contributes to the literature on alliance formation, reputation, and international management as follows: first, we disentangle the complex mechanisms that underlie the relationship between organizational resources and firms’ propensities for alliance formation. The curvilinear effect of reputation provides evidence for the coexistence of the opposing perspectives of need and opportunity. Second, previous research on reputation has generally focused on the linkage between reputation and performance; by contrast, the current study explores the effect of reputation on firms’ alliance behavior. We demonstrate the dual nature of reputation in shaping firms’ strategic decisions, such as those made on alliance formation. Third, although international management studies have proposed the liability of foreignness as a challenge for foreign firms, our findings show that foreign firms may enjoy the advantage of foreignness under certain conditions. In the context of China's VC industry, foreign firms are subject to less institutional pressure to conform to guanxi and are, therefore, more likely to opt for the standalone approach as their reputation increases.  \n\n### REPUTATION AND ALLIANCE FORMATION  \n\nReputation  has been considered an  important intangible resource leading to sustainable competitive advantage (Barney, 1991; Deephouse, 2000). Dollinger, Golden, and Saxton (1997) argue that reputation can be a source of rent and profit, since it is valuable, rare, hard to duplicate, and nonsubstitutable. Hall (1992） further documents that reputation was ranked as the most important among 13 organizational resources by top executives in the United Kingdom (U.K.). Following Fombrun (1996: 72), we define reputation as ‘a representation of a company's past actions and future prospects that describes the firm's overall appeal.’ Scholars have generally considered a firm's past performance as the most direct and influential source of reputation (Dollinger, Golden and Saxton 1997; Washington and Zajac, 2005).  \n\nReputation positively affects a firm's opportunities to form alliances. A good reputation creates a positive perception about the firm's ability to create value and attract other resources (Stuart, Ha, and Hybels, 1999; Turban and Cable, 2003). Consequently, reputation enhances a firm's desirability as a network partner.  \n\nMeanwhile, a good reputation can also decrease a firm's need to form alliances. Firms with cumulative successes are likely to have developed a pool of resources and capabilities critical for good performance. As a result, reputable firms will have less reliance on partners and will be more likely to proceed alone.  \n\nWhether reputation enhancement will exert a positive or a negative effect on the propensity to form alliances is determined by the interplay of opportunity and need. When a firm has a poor reputation, it faces a high need for alliances but also experiences a low opportunity to form them. In this situation, the effect of reputation on alliance formation is dominated by the opportunity mechanism. As a firm's reputation improves, it signals that the firm has achieved higher levels of trustworthiness and legitimacy (Parkhe, 1993), which are considered valuable and rare resources, particularly in emerging economies characterized by market inefficiency and information asymmetry. With these improved reputations, firms will be more likely to overcome constraints on alliance formation and have greater opportunities to form alliances. In other words, for firms with poor reputations, the positive effect of opportunity outweighs the negative effect of need; thus, an improved reputation will lead to a higher likelihood of alliance formations.  \n\nIn contrast, when a firm already has a good reputation, it faces a high opportunity and a low need to form alliances. Given sufficient opportunity to collaborate, the marginal effect of reputation on opportunity will diminish as reputation increases. Meanwhile, these firms′ needs to collaborate continue to fall as they accumulate more knowledge and capabilities to achieve success on their own (Sitkin and Pablo, 1992; Wiseman and GomezMejia, 1998). Therefore, for firms with good reputations, the extent to which reputation affects the propensity for alliance will mainly be driven by the need mechanism, resulting in a negative relationship between reputation and alliance formation.  \n\nBased upon these arguments, we propose that the relationship between alliance formation and reputation is nonlinear. Firms with moderate reputations will have both high needs and high opportunities to collaborate, making them more likely to form an alliance rather than go alone.  \n\nHypothesis 1 (Hl): A firm's likelihood of forming allianceswill firstincrease as reputation improves and then decline after the firm's reputationcrossesathreshold.  \n\n#### Reputation and alliance formation: foreign versus domestic firms  \n\nForeign and domestic firms represent two distinct forms of organizations and tend to behave differently (Zaheer, 1995; Peng, 2003). For foreign firms, the liability of foreignness often limits their ability to gather local knowledge and achieve market legitimacy (Nachum, 2010). Therefore, the simple act of being foreign serves as a primary motivation for foreign firms to form alliances.  \n\nNotwithstanding liability of foreignness, foreign firms from developed economies are likely to be considered more capable and reliable than those from less developed economies (Peng, 2003; Douma, George, and Kabir, 2006). In the context of China's VC industry, foreign firms generally have comparative advantages that arise from their global operations and their ability to reach offshore for fundraising. As a result, foreign firms are more desirable partners for alliances and enjoy considerable opportunities in spite of their liability of foreignness.  \n\nIt is important to note that foreign firms originating in developed economies tend to rely more heavily on regulations, contracts, and marketbased competition, but are less bounded by social networks and reciprocal exchanges (Bruton and Ahlstrom, 2003; Li, Popp0, and Zhou, 2008). The cultural differences can generate conficts and disruptions in alliances between foreign and domestic firms (Li et al., 2008). Indeed, our interviews suggest that many foreign firms find it difficult to work with domestic firms. A foreign investor shared the story of a domestic company that approached him, recommending a joint investment and attempting to charge a ‘matchmaking fee’ for the deal. ^This really turned us away. That's not our way of doing business,’ the foreign investor commented. Moreover, foreign firms’ emphasis on market-based competition and profit maximization often leads to a preference for the stand-alone approach, which generates lower coordination costs and avoids revenue sharing with partners (Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven, 2006). Consequently, as a foreign firm's reputation improves, its perceived need to ally will decline substantially, and it will favor the stand-alone approach for investments.  \n\nBy comparison, for domestic firms, the access to complementary resources and future deals may account for more important incentives to form alliances. In the context of the VC market in China, where fundraising and exits (IPOs) often take place overseas, domestic VC firms are more dependent on partners who have access to overseas capital markets for the success of portfolio companies (PCs). An international network with investment banks and other financial  institutions overseas cannot be developed in a short period of time (Shenkar and Li, 1999). As a result, although domestic firms’ need for alliances will decrease as their reputations improve, the magnitude of such a negative effect may be limited. More importantly, the institutional forces that domestic firms are subject to are conducive to alliance formation. The importance of interorganizational or interpersonal relationships, also known as guanxi in China (Xin and Pearce, 1996; Peng and Luo, 2000), is deeply rooted for domestic firms. The norm of guanxi leads to a higher obligation for domestic firms to share information and reciprocate with existing partners. Failure to do so may hurt their position in the community and their access to future deal opportunities. For these reasons, domestic firms tend to have strong imperatives to commit to networking, even when they are reputable and capable of succeeding on their own.  \n\nIn sum, compared to domestic firms, foreign firms with poor reputations will have more opportunities to collaborate, and those with good reputations will have less of a need to ally. Consequently, the threshold at which the negative need effect outweighs the positive opportunity effect underlying the curvilinear relation between reputation and alliance formation will be lower for foreign firms than for domestic firms.  \n\nHypothesis 2(H2):The threshold at which reputation enhancement will lead to a lower likelihood of allianceformation will be lower for foreign firms.  \n\n#### Reputation and alliance formation: institutional development  \n\nInstitutions shape economic activities and firms' strategic choices through formal and informal constraints (North, 1990; Aldrich and Fiol, 1994). Therefore, the effect of reputation on alliance formation is likely to be contingent on the institutional environment. While institutional change is ubiquitous, emerging economies are characterized by the high velocity of institutional change (Zhou et al., 2003). As a result, the greater variation allows for a more nuanced understanding of how the reputational effect on alliance formation varies across different levels of institutional environments.  \n\nInstitutional  changes  affect  the  reputationalliance relationship in several ways through the mechanisms of opportunity and need. First, with increasing levels of market transparency and institutional efficiency, transaction costs will be reduced and market opportunities will expand in the later stage (Peng and Luo, 2000). Even firms without lengthy track records will find it easier to obtain network information and have greater access to potential alliance partners. Second, as the regulatory regime evolves, more effective third-party enforcement emerges to facilitate and safeguard firms’ investments. As a result, marketbased and impersonal transactions become more viable, reducing the need to resort to networks and alliances (Peng, 2003; Steensma et al., 2005). Therefore, when the level of institutional development is higher, a firm with a poor reputation will have more opportunities to collaborate and will, hence, be more likely to enter into an alliance. At the same time, firms with better reputations will have less need to collaborate and therefore be less likely to form an alliance. As a consequence, for the inverted-U relationship between reputation and alliance performance, the threshold at which the negative effects outweigh the positive effects will occur earlier as the institutional environment becomes better developed.  \n\nIn summary, when institutions are underdeveloped, reputation is especially important for helping firms overcome institutional constraints and access opportunities to form alliances (Xin and Pearce, 1996). As institutions develop, opportunities to form alliances increase and the need to form alliances decreases. As a result, the opportunity mechanism typically has a greater influence on the reputation-alliance formation relationship in the earlier stage, whereas the need mechanism tends to carry a greater weight in the later stage of institutional development. Accordingly, the threshold at which the negative need effect outweighs the positive opportunity effect will be higher in the earlier stage and lower in the later stage.  \n\n# Hypothesis 3(H3): The threshold at which reputation enhancement willlead to a lower likelihood of alliance formation will be lower when the level of institutional development is higher.  \n\n### METHOD  \n\n#### Data  \n\nWe study the effects of reputation on firms’ decisions regarding alliance formation in the context of China's VC industry. This industry presents an ideal context to research alliance formation behavior for three reasons. First, syndication, a common practice in the VC industry, is a typical form of alliance formation (Wright and Lockett, 2003).  \n\nVC syndication information is publicly announced, and thus allows for a systematic analysis of the pattern  of  VC  alliance formation.  Second, the choice between the alliance approach and the stand-alone approach is an important and inevitable decision that any leading VC has to make prior to the investment (Lerner, 1994). Accordingly, the VC industry allows multiple observations of alliances formed and not formed to acquire a better understanding of the dynamics of competition and collaboration among firms (Dimov and Milanov, 2010). Third, despite its short history, the VC industry in China has become the second largest in the world, second only to that in the United States (U.S.). The growth momentum of China's VC industry has attracted significant foreign entrants (Bruton and Ahlstrom, 2003), which leads to greater variance and allows for a more nuanced understanding of the research question in this study.  \n\nWe compiled our data from the CVSource, Zero2IPO, and VentureXpert databases. CVSource and Zero2IPO are both leading research institutes in China, with coverage of the entire range of firms in China's VC industry. VentureXpert purports to offer comprehensive information on Asian private equity markets from 1962 to the present. Its database has been extensively used in research of the VC industry (Sorenson and Stuart, 2001; Gompers and Lerner, 2004).  \n\nAlthough the first international VC firms entered China in the early 1980s, VC investment in China did not take off until the late 1990s (see Ahlstrom, Bruton, and Yeh, 2007 for a detailed review on the VC industry in China). Accordingly, we used January 1, 1999 as the starting point, and December 31, 2011 as the closing point for our sampling. Left censoring should not be a serious concern, since the majority of VC investments in China were made after 2000.  \n\nTo test our hypotheses, we constructed panel data by recording all the deals invested by each focal VC in chronological order. As a result, our unit of analysis is firm-deal. This approach allows us to observe VC syndication decisions over time and to control for the conditions and characteristics associated with each deal. While firms may choose to invest in different rounds, we restricted our observations to the first round investment for two reasons. First, Firms’ alliance decisions in later rounds are influenced by the PC performance. However, early performances cannot be attributed to the later investors, and separating PC performance to make distinctions for each round is very difficult and would complicate the analysis (Sorensen, 2007). In addition, firms usually have the most fexibility to make decisions in the first financing round, and they routinely invest in subsequent rounds after the initial investment. Following previous studies, we used two criteria to identify lead VC firms in each deal (Sorensen, 2007). When only one firm had invested in the target PC's first round, we identified the VC as the lead. In cases where the first round included multiple VCs, we identified the VC with the largest investment as the lead. After excluding inconsistent or missing data, we were left with $285~\\mathrm{VC}$ firms that participated in a total of 3,033 deals. Each VC firm took part in an average of 11 deals, resulting in 583 successful exits.  \n\n#### Variables  \n\n#### Dependent variable  \n\nWe used syndication as the dependent variable to account for the likelihood of VC investment through the alliance formation for each deal. It was coded ‘1’ if the VC firm invested through syndication and $\\mathbf{\\nabla}^{\\cdot}0^{\\cdot}$ in all other situations.  \n\n#### Independent variable  \n\nWe measured firms’ reputation with the most visible marker of a VC's prior performance: the IPO event. Successfully taking companies public helps VCs liquidate their investment and achieve positive cash flow. Furthermore, the media coverage of the IPO event can enhance the public awareness and, therefore, the legitimacy of the VC firms, allowing them to syndicate with better partners or invest in more promising PCs (Deephouse, 2000; Dacin, Oliver, and Roy, 2007). This endorsement effect is magnified in emerging markets such as China due to environmental uncertainty and information asymmetry. In previous studies, the number of IPOs has been widely applied to assess the reputation of VC firms (Dimov and Milanov, 2010; Park and Steensma, 2012). Accordingly, we examined VC reputation by the number of prior exits in China before the focal deal.  \n\nWe constructed the variable foreign to indicate the focal firm's country of origin. It was coded '1′ for firms registered or headquartered abroad and $\\mathbf{\\nabla}^{\\cdot}0^{\\cdot}$ for firms registered in China. Our data set included VC firms from 16 countries (regions) outside mainland China: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the U.K., and the U.S. The gross domestic product (GDP) per capita  indicates a substantial  difference  in economic development between China and these foreign countries (regions).  \n\nTable　1． Factor analysis results 　of 　institutional indicators   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Country-level institutional characteristics</td><td>Rotated factor loading</td></tr><tr><td>Business environment</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1.

We obtained institutional data from the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)'s database. EIU data have been employed to examine country-level institutional environments (Chakrabarti, Singh, and Mahmood, 2007; Chan, Isobe, and Makino, 2008). To confirm the proposed dimensions of China's institutional environment, we factor analyzed the relevant indicators for each year using principal components analysis with varimax rotation. The analysis generated two distinct factors (Table 1). We then used the factor scores to account for the business and political environment in China.  \n\n#### Controlvariable  \n\nWe included a group of control variables pertaining to the VCs and PCs. First, to control for the dependency between deals, we constructed industry experience by aggregating the number of deals in which the VC firm had invested before the focal deal. We also gauged Chinese experience as the number of years since the focal VC firm first invested in the Chinese market. Second, we captured the network embeddedness (network centrality） of a VC firm among its syndicate partners for the three most recent years using Bonacich's (1987) eigenvector centrality measure. Third, we controlled for foreign VCs’ network centrality prior to entry. Drawing on the VentureXpert database, we constructed investment matrices for the relevant time period that included all active foreign VC firms. We then gauged the eigenvector centrality score using the coinvestment matrices from the five most recent years when the focal VC first invested in the Chinese market. Fourth, we controlled for the age and the government ownership of each VC firm. VC firm age was the number of years since the firm was registered. Government ownership was equal to‘1'if the VCs were owned by the government. We also included two dummy variables, venture capital and private equity, to distinguish firms that focus on entrepreneurial ventures and those that concentrate on private equity.  \n\nWe used several variables tocontrol for the variations in the PC firms. As the geographic distribution of PC firms can influence VCs' investment strategies (Sorenson and Audia, 2000), we first controlled for the location of the PC. The VC investment is mainly concentrated in three political/economic centers in China: Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong. The number of IPOs and the amount of VC investment in these areas account for about 95 percent of the total in China. Accordingly, we coded $P C$ in major city as ‘1' if the funded PCs were located in Beijing, Shanghai, or Guangdong and $\\mathrm{{}^{\\circ}}0^{\\circ}$ otherwise. We also constructed PC overseas, which was equal to $\\mathbf{\\nabla}^{\\langle}1\\mathbf{\\nabla}^{\\rangle}$ if the funded PC were overseas and $\\mathrm{{}^{\\circ}}0^{\\circ}$ if they were not. Second, the syndication decisions of VCs may be influenced by the VCs’ preference for different stages of PC development (Shane and Stuart, 2002). Thus, we distinguished four stages of PC investment based on a widely applied classification (Pratt, 1984): seed stage, growth stage,expansion stage, and mature stage. Third, we included industry dummies across all models to control for the different competitive intensity and growth prospects across industries.  \n\n#### Model  \n\nWe employed logistic regressions to estimate the likelihood that a VC firm will choose to invest through syndication. A similar approach has been adopted by studies that analyze exchange partner selection (Podolny, 1993) and alliance formation decisions (Chung et al., 2000). The Hausman test fails to reject random effects in favor of fixed effects estimators (Hausman, 1978). Due to our focus on the heterogeneity of syndication decisions among VC firms, we used random effects in the reported models and fixed effects for a robustness test. Because previous characteristics may affect firms’ subsequent decisions, we applied a one-year lag to all time variant independent variables and control variables in every model.  \n\n### RESULT  \n\nTable 2 presents the summary statistics and correlation matrix for all variables. Table 3 reports our major findings. H1 predicts an inverted U-shaped relationship between firm reputation and the likelihood to form an alliance. The coefficients for reputation and reputation square in Model 3 confirm our hypothesis. The reputation enhancement will first increase VC firms’ likelihood to syndicate and then decrease their tendency to do so after a certain threshold.  \n\nH2 proposes different effects of reputation on alliance formation between domestic and foreign firms, such that the threshold at which the positive effect of reputation on alliance formation turns negative is lower for foreign firms. Consistent with our argument, the coefficients of the interactions between reputation and foreign in Model 4 are negative and significant. To correctly interpret the moderating effects in a nonlinear model, we further separated the samples based on firm ownership. The results stay consistent.  \n\nTable 2.

The interactions between reputation and institutional development (business environment and political environment） in Model 6 are significant and negative, indicating a lower threshold for more mature institutions. Therefore, H3 is supported.  \n\n#### Robustness check  \n\nThese results are robust to a variety of sensitivity analyses. First, the curvilinear relationship between reputation and alliance formation may be driven by the search for different resources from different partners. To rule out the alternative explanation, we applied a multinomial logit model to test the relative probability of different types of alliances (foreign only, domestic only, and both foreign and domestic) to the stand-alone option (Parmigiani and Mitchell, 2009). The inverted-U relationship between reputation and the likelihood of syndication is confirmed.  \n\nSecond, we constructed two alternative measures for the reputation of VC firms. We constructed the IPO ratio, which was equal to the number of prior exits in China divided by the total number of investments before the focal deal. We also constructed a categorical variable VC rank published by the Zero2IPO research institute. Both results are in consistence with our proposition.  \n\nThird, we used a dummy variable, year 2004, as an alternative to measure different stages of institutional development. Year 2004 marks the turning point between the early and the later phase because important regulations designed to promote VC and entrepreneurial activities became effective in 2004. The moderating effect of year 2004 is negative and significant, thus lending support to H3. In addition, we ran separate regressions for each year. As predicted, the thresholds at which the negative effects of reputation outweigh the positive are lower in more recent years.  \n\nFourth, we employed a Wu-Hausman test to address the potential endogeneity issue and used Heckman's two-stage model to assess the potential reverse causality issue. Fifth, we excluded Hong Kong and Taiwan firm data from the sample. Sixth, we confined our sample to the first investment by each VC firm to eliminate the dependence among multiple deals by the same VC. Finally, we excluded PCs that were older than 10 years. All the findings conform to our hypotheses.  \n\n### DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION  \n\nIn this study, we systematically demonstrate an inverted U-shaped pattern between firms’ reputations and their likelihood of forming alliances and illustrate how this pattern is contingent on foreignness and different levels of institutional development. This study contributes to the literature on alliance formation, reputation, and international management.  \n\nPrior studies have highlighted the important role that organizational resources play in shaping firms' decisions regarding whether or not to form an alliance. While some studies have adopted the need perspective and emphasized a negative association between firms’ resource positions and their likelihood to form alliances, others have focused on the opportunity perspective and suggested a positive association. The curvilinear effect we found in this study supports the coexistence of the opposing mechanisms of need and opportunity. Essentially, our results suggest that firms will be most likely to form alliances when they reach an intermediate level of reputation because they have both the need and the opportunity to do so. More importantly, we examine the contingencies of foreignness and institutional development to further disentangle opportunity from need, which enable us to unpack the complex mechanisms underlying the relationship between resources and alliance formation.  \n\nWith respect to the reputation literature, most studies have focused on the link between reputation and performance. Few studies, however, have examined the effect of reputation on firms’ alliance behavior. Moreover, prior studies have generally taken a unidirectional approach when examining the role of reputation. For example, Dollinger et al. (1997) show that a focal firm's reputation increases others’ willingness to collaborate with it. However, highly reputable firms that are attractive to potential partners may not have the need to enter into alliances. Instead, they may be more inclined to go alone. By applying an integrative perspective of opportunity and need in studying reputation, we have revealed the dual nature of reputation in shaping firms’ strategic decisions. This finding also offers a significant practical implication. Managers who are contemplating interfirm relationships should perform closed monitoring of the reputation development of potential partners prior to initiating an alliance. Being better informed about these potential partners’ critical reputation levels may allow a firm to have a strategic advantage in the course of searching and forming alliances.  \n\nIn addition, this study provides insights into the international management literature and the issue of liability of foreignness in particular (Zaheer, 1995). One of our most intriguing findings is the different tendencies toward alliance formation in response to reputation enhancement between domestic and foreign firms. We find that foreign firms reach the peak of the inverted-U shape earlier than domestic firms, which indicates that foreign firms are more likely to opt for the standalone approach as they develop a track record of successes. This finding is consistent with the widely held belief that foreign firms will prefer the alliance approach to wholly owned subsidiaries due to the liability of foreignness (Hennart, 1988). Because reputation serves as an important countermechanism for the liability of foreignness, foreign firms are much less likely to form alliances as their reputations improve. To further examine this mechanism, we added the interaction between reputation and network centrality prior to entry into our model. The interaction is significantly negative, indicating that foreign firms with a better reputation prior to their entry into China will opt for the stand-alone approach more quickly once they establish their reputations in China. In addition, foreign firms may enjoy the advantage of foreignness in some areas—for instance, by being subject to less institutional pressure to conform to local norms compared to domestic firms. In the context of China's VC industry, foreign firms are not as bounded by the norm of guanxi as are domestic firms; therefore, they will be more likely to go alone as their reputations increase.  \n\nOur focus on China affords us a unique opportunity to examine how institutions and resources interact to shape firms’ strategic choices in emerging economies. The importance of social relationships in emerging economies has been widely documented in prior research (Xin and  \n\nPearce, 1996; Peng and Luo, 2000). Our results suggest that while social relationships remain important, the extent to which firms rely on their competitive competences to network with other companies may still change as institutions develop. It is worth noting that the negative moderating effect of institutional development on reputation does not mean that reputation will play a less important role in a firm's strategy and performance as the institution develops. Instead, it implies that reputation may actually have a greater independent effect on firm performance when the institutional environment is developed, as more reputable firms become less dependent on networks and alliances.  \n\nThis study can be extended by future research in a number of ways. First, although our focus is on reputation, we believe that the underlying mechanisms can be applied to study other resources that may be determinants of alliance formation, such as status, innovativeness, and social capital. Understanding firms’ signals about how their resources are orchestrated can facilitate potential partners to effectively integrate resources and achieve successful alliances.  \n\nSecond, in this study, we adopt a performancebased definition of reputation  (Washington and Zajac, 2005) and employ the most direct indicator of reputation: past success. Nevertheless, reputation has multiple facets. A firm can have a reputation for high-quality products (Rhee and Haunschild, 2006), business integrity (Jensen and Roy, 2008), or being cooperative (Baum et al., 2000). It will be interesting for future studies to distinguish various aspects of reputation and to examine their distinctive influences on firms' alliance behavior.  \n\nAnother possible direction for future research is to move beyond the question of whether or not to form an alliance and instead to investigate choices of alliance partners. We have made some efforts to explore this. Based on the first-round syndications in our data, we find that the pattern of firms’ partner selection changes as the institution develops over time. Both domestic and foreign VC firms are more likely to syndicate with foreign VCs at an early stage of institutional development. As the institution matures, however, syndications with domestic VCs increase substantially and eventually exceed those with foreign VCs. When we use the subsample of domestic VC firms, we find that an alliance consisting of both foreign and domestic firms is more likely to occur than an alliance consisting of only domestic firms. This suggests that complementarity of resources may be a factor in alliance formation. Other factors that can affect partner selection include resource complementarity, geographic proximity (Stuart and Sorenson, 2003), repetitive relationships (Beckman, Haunschild, and Phillips, 2004), and status homophily (Chung et al., 2000).  \n\nFinally, while we are confident that our theory and findings can be extended to other contexts (especially emerging economies), a comparative study of firm alliance formation in Europe, North America, and Asia would be an interesting avenue for future research.  \n\nIn summary, our study presents an integrative framework of how a firm's reputation affects its decisions of alliance formation. The inverted Ushaped relationship between a firm's reputation and its likelihood of alliance formation manifests the coexistence of and the interplay between the opposing mechanisms of need and opportunity. Overall, this research highlights the importance of incorporating the dual nature of organizational resources in the understanding of a firm's strategic decisions.  \n\n### ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  \n\nThis research is supported by NUS Research Grant R-313-000-077-112.We would like to thank Coeditor Will Mitchell and two anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments.

We focus on an important form of intangible resource—firm reputation—and examine how it affects a firm's propensity to form alliances. We propose an inverted $U$ shapedrelationship between a firm's reputation and its likelihood of alliance formation, resulting from the opposing mechanisms of opportunity and need. We also examine how this relationship may vary across two contingencies: (1) foreign and domestic firms; and (2） different levels of institutional development. Empirical analyses of China's venture capital (VC) industry provide support for ourhypotheses.Copyright $\\copyright$ 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.  \n\n### INTRODUCTION  \n\nDespite the prevalence of alliances in today's business world (Baum, Calabrese, and Silverman, 2000; Chung, Singh, and Kyungmook, 2000; Gulati, 2009), considerable variance in firms' use of partnerships continues to occur. Although previous studies have demonstrated the role of organizational resources as important drivers of alliance formation, such studies disagree on the specific roles these resources play. One research stream focuses on the need for alliances. It suggests that firms with weak resources face a greater need to form or join an alliance (Hennart, 1988; Aldrich and Fiol, 1994). The other stream emphasizes alliance opportunities. It argues that firms in a strong resource position are more likely to enter into an alliance given the opportunities available to them (Gulati, 1999; Chung et al., 2000). Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven (1996) and Ahuja (2000) were among the first researchers to incorporate both need and opportunity perspectives in studying alliance formation. Nonetheless, such research continues to emphasize the logic of opportunity in assessing the role of resources. For example, Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven (1996) use firms’ resource conditions to elucidate opportunity, but they use external factors, such as market competition and pioneering technology, to explain need. Ahuja (2000) demonstrates that firm resources positively affect alliance formation through the opportunity mechanism, but provides unclear empirical evidence for the need mechanism. As such, previous studies fall short in terms of developing a truly integrative framework of how firms’ resources shape their decisions of alliance formation. How do opportunity and need interact to determine the ultimate effects of resources on alliance formation? Under what conditions will the opportunity effect outweigh the need effect or vice versa? These unanswered questions prompt a closer examination of the relationship between organizational resources and alliance formation.  \n\nTo unravel the complex mechanisms of alliance formation, this article focuses on an important intangible resource—firm reputation——-and examines its effect on the creation of partnerships. On the basis of the contrasting mechanisms of opportunity and need, we propose a curvilinear relationship between a firm's reputation and its likelihood to form an alliance. The threshold of the curvilinear relationship depends on whether a reputation's positive effect through the opportunity mechanism outweighs its negative effect through the need mechanism. To further elucidate how reputation affects a firm's propensity to form alliances, we examine two contingencies. First, we distinguish firm ownership by foreign and domestic firms in the context of emerging economies. Second, we identify the level of institutional  development as another key  contingency for the relationship between reputation and alliance formation. We expect the underlying mechanisms of reputation to vary between foreign and domestic firms and across different stages of institutional development.  \n\nThis study uses China's venture capital (VC) industry as our empirical context, and contributes to the literature on alliance formation, reputation, and international management as follows: first, we disentangle the complex mechanisms that underlie the relationship between organizational resources and firms’ propensities for alliance formation. The curvilinear effect of reputation provides evidence for the coexistence of the opposing perspectives of need and opportunity. Second, previous research on reputation has generally focused on the linkage between reputation and performance; by contrast, the current study explores the effect of reputation on firms’ alliance behavior. We demonstrate the dual nature of reputation in shaping firms’ strategic decisions, such as those made on alliance formation. Third, although international management studies have proposed the liability of foreignness as a challenge for foreign firms, our findings show that foreign firms may enjoy the advantage of foreignness under certain conditions. In the context of China's VC industry, foreign firms are subject to less institutional pressure to conform to guanxi and are, therefore, more likely to opt for the standalone approach as their reputation increases.  \n\n### REPUTATION AND ALLIANCE FORMATION  \n\nReputation  has been considered an  important intangible resource leading to sustainable competitive advantage (Barney, 1991; Deephouse, 2000). Dollinger, Golden, and Saxton (1997) argue that reputation can be a source of rent and profit, since it is valuable, rare, hard to duplicate, and nonsubstitutable. Hall (1992） further documents that reputation was ranked as the most important among 13 organizational resources by top executives in the United Kingdom (U.K.). Following Fombrun (1996: 72), we define reputation as ‘a representation of a company's past actions and future prospects that describes the firm's overall appeal.’ Scholars have generally considered a firm's past performance as the most direct and influential source of reputation (Dollinger, Golden and Saxton 1997; Washington and Zajac, 2005).  \n\nReputation positively affects a firm's opportunities to form alliances. A good reputation creates a positive perception about the firm's ability to create value and attract other resources (Stuart, Ha, and Hybels, 1999; Turban and Cable, 2003). Consequently, reputation enhances a firm's desirability as a network partner.  \n\nMeanwhile, a good reputation can also decrease a firm's need to form alliances. Firms with cumulative successes are likely to have developed a pool of resources and capabilities critical for good performance. As a result, reputable firms will have less reliance on partners and will be more likely to proceed alone.  \n\nWhether reputation enhancement will exert a positive or a negative effect on the propensity to form alliances is determined by the interplay of opportunity and need. When a firm has a poor reputation, it faces a high need for alliances but also experiences a low opportunity to form them. In this situation, the effect of reputation on alliance formation is dominated by the opportunity mechanism. As a firm's reputation improves, it signals that the firm has achieved higher levels of trustworthiness and legitimacy (Parkhe, 1993), which are considered valuable and rare resources, particularly in emerging economies characterized by market inefficiency and information asymmetry. With these improved reputations, firms will be more likely to overcome constraints on alliance formation and have greater opportunities to form alliances. In other words, for firms with poor reputations, the positive effect of opportunity outweighs the negative effect of need; thus, an improved reputation will lead to a higher likelihood of alliance formations.  \n\nIn contrast, when a firm already has a good reputation, it faces a high opportunity and a low need to form alliances. Given sufficient opportunity to collaborate, the marginal effect of reputation on opportunity will diminish as reputation increases. Meanwhile, these firms′ needs to collaborate continue to fall as they accumulate more knowledge and capabilities to achieve success on their own (Sitkin and Pablo, 1992; Wiseman and GomezMejia, 1998). Therefore, for firms with good reputations, the extent to which reputation affects the propensity for alliance will mainly be driven by the need mechanism, resulting in a negative relationship between reputation and alliance formation.  \n\nBased upon these arguments, we propose that the relationship between alliance formation and reputation is nonlinear. Firms with moderate reputations will have both high needs and high opportunities to collaborate, making them more likely to form an alliance rather than go alone.  \n\nHypothesis 1 (Hl): A firm's likelihood of forming allianceswill firstincrease as reputation improves and then decline after the firm's reputationcrossesathreshold.  \n\n#### Reputation and alliance formation: foreign versus domestic firms  \n\nForeign and domestic firms represent two distinct forms of organizations and tend to behave differently (Zaheer, 1995; Peng, 2003). For foreign firms, the liability of foreignness often limits their ability to gather local knowledge and achieve market legitimacy (Nachum, 2010). Therefore, the simple act of being foreign serves as a primary motivation for foreign firms to form alliances.  \n\nNotwithstanding liability of foreignness, foreign firms from developed economies are likely to be considered more capable and reliable than those from less developed economies (Peng, 2003; Douma, George, and Kabir, 2006). In the context of China's VC industry, foreign firms generally have comparative advantages that arise from their global operations and their ability to reach offshore for fundraising. As a result, foreign firms are more desirable partners for alliances and enjoy considerable opportunities in spite of their liability of foreignness.  \n\nIt is important to note that foreign firms originating in developed economies tend to rely more heavily on regulations, contracts, and marketbased competition, but are less bounded by social networks and reciprocal exchanges (Bruton and Ahlstrom, 2003; Li, Popp0, and Zhou, 2008). The cultural differences can generate conficts and disruptions in alliances between foreign and domestic firms (Li et al., 2008). Indeed, our interviews suggest that many foreign firms find it difficult to work with domestic firms. A foreign investor shared the story of a domestic company that approached him, recommending a joint investment and attempting to charge a ‘matchmaking fee’ for the deal. ^This really turned us away. That's not our way of doing business,’ the foreign investor commented. Moreover, foreign firms’ emphasis on market-based competition and profit maximization often leads to a preference for the stand-alone approach, which generates lower coordination costs and avoids revenue sharing with partners (Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven, 2006). Consequently, as a foreign firm's reputation improves, its perceived need to ally will decline substantially, and it will favor the stand-alone approach for investments.  \n\nBy comparison, for domestic firms, the access to complementary resources and future deals may account for more important incentives to form alliances. In the context of the VC market in China, where fundraising and exits (IPOs) often take place overseas, domestic VC firms are more dependent on partners who have access to overseas capital markets for the success of portfolio companies (PCs). An international network with investment banks and other financial  institutions overseas cannot be developed in a short period of time (Shenkar and Li, 1999). As a result, although domestic firms’ need for alliances will decrease as their reputations improve, the magnitude of such a negative effect may be limited. More importantly, the institutional forces that domestic firms are subject to are conducive to alliance formation. The importance of interorganizational or interpersonal relationships, also known as guanxi in China (Xin and Pearce, 1996; Peng and Luo, 2000), is deeply rooted for domestic firms. The norm of guanxi leads to a higher obligation for domestic firms to share information and reciprocate with existing partners. Failure to do so may hurt their position in the community and their access to future deal opportunities. For these reasons, domestic firms tend to have strong imperatives to commit to networking, even when they are reputable and capable of succeeding on their own.  \n\nIn sum, compared to domestic firms, foreign firms with poor reputations will have more opportunities to collaborate, and those with good reputations will have less of a need to ally. Consequently, the threshold at which the negative need effect outweighs the positive opportunity effect underlying the curvilinear relation between reputation and alliance formation will be lower for foreign firms than for domestic firms.  \n\nHypothesis 2(H2):The threshold at which reputation enhancement will lead to a lower likelihood of allianceformation will be lower for foreign firms.  \n\n#### Reputation and alliance formation: institutional development  \n\nInstitutions shape economic activities and firms' strategic choices through formal and informal constraints (North, 1990; Aldrich and Fiol, 1994). Therefore, the effect of reputation on alliance formation is likely to be contingent on the institutional environment. While institutional change is ubiquitous, emerging economies are characterized by the high velocity of institutional change (Zhou et al., 2003). As a result, the greater variation allows for a more nuanced understanding of how the reputational effect on alliance formation varies across different levels of institutional environments.  \n\nInstitutional  changes  affect  the  reputationalliance relationship in several ways through the mechanisms of opportunity and need. First, with increasing levels of market transparency and institutional efficiency, transaction costs will be reduced and market opportunities will expand in the later stage (Peng and Luo, 2000). Even firms without lengthy track records will find it easier to obtain network information and have greater access to potential alliance partners. Second, as the regulatory regime evolves, more effective third-party enforcement emerges to facilitate and safeguard firms’ investments. As a result, marketbased and impersonal transactions become more viable, reducing the need to resort to networks and alliances (Peng, 2003; Steensma et al., 2005). Therefore, when the level of institutional development is higher, a firm with a poor reputation will have more opportunities to collaborate and will, hence, be more likely to enter into an alliance. At the same time, firms with better reputations will have less need to collaborate and therefore be less likely to form an alliance. As a consequence, for the inverted-U relationship between reputation and alliance performance, the threshold at which the negative effects outweigh the positive effects will occur earlier as the institutional environment becomes better developed.  \n\nIn summary, when institutions are underdeveloped, reputation is especially important for helping firms overcome institutional constraints and access opportunities to form alliances (Xin and Pearce, 1996). As institutions develop, opportunities to form alliances increase and the need to form alliances decreases. As a result, the opportunity mechanism typically has a greater influence on the reputation-alliance formation relationship in the earlier stage, whereas the need mechanism tends to carry a greater weight in the later stage of institutional development. Accordingly, the threshold at which the negative need effect outweighs the positive opportunity effect will be higher in the earlier stage and lower in the later stage.  \n\n# Hypothesis 3(H3): The threshold at which reputation enhancement willlead to a lower likelihood of alliance formation will be lower when the level of institutional development is higher.  \n\n### METHOD  \n\n#### Data  \n\nWe study the effects of reputation on firms’ decisions regarding alliance formation in the context of China's VC industry. This industry presents an ideal context to research alliance formation behavior for three reasons. First, syndication, a common practice in the VC industry, is a typical form of alliance formation (Wright and Lockett, 2003).  \n\nVC syndication information is publicly announced, and thus allows for a systematic analysis of the pattern  of  VC  alliance formation.  Second, the choice between the alliance approach and the stand-alone approach is an important and inevitable decision that any leading VC has to make prior to the investment (Lerner, 1994). Accordingly, the VC industry allows multiple observations of alliances formed and not formed to acquire a better understanding of the dynamics of competition and collaboration among firms (Dimov and Milanov, 2010). Third, despite its short history, the VC industry in China has become the second largest in the world, second only to that in the United States (U.S.). The growth momentum of China's VC industry has attracted significant foreign entrants (Bruton and Ahlstrom, 2003), which leads to greater variance and allows for a more nuanced understanding of the research question in this study.  \n\nWe compiled our data from the CVSource, Zero2IPO, and VentureXpert databases. CVSource and Zero2IPO are both leading research institutes in China, with coverage of the entire range of firms in China's VC industry. VentureXpert purports to offer comprehensive information on Asian private equity markets from 1962 to the present. Its database has been extensively used in research of the VC industry (Sorenson and Stuart, 2001; Gompers and Lerner, 2004).  \n\nAlthough the first international VC firms entered China in the early 1980s, VC investment in China did not take off until the late 1990s (see Ahlstrom, Bruton, and Yeh, 2007 for a detailed review on the VC industry in China). Accordingly, we used January 1, 1999 as the starting point, and December 31, 2011 as the closing point for our sampling. Left censoring should not be a serious concern, since the majority of VC investments in China were made after 2000.  \n\nTo test our hypotheses, we constructed panel data by recording all the deals invested by each focal VC in chronological order. As a result, our unit of analysis is firm-deal. This approach allows us to observe VC syndication decisions over time and to control for the conditions and characteristics associated with each deal. While firms may choose to invest in different rounds, we restricted our observations to the first round investment for two reasons. First, Firms’ alliance decisions in later rounds are influenced by the PC performance. However, early performances cannot be attributed to the later investors, and separating PC performance to make distinctions for each round is very difficult and would complicate the analysis (Sorensen, 2007). In addition, firms usually have the most fexibility to make decisions in the first financing round, and they routinely invest in subsequent rounds after the initial investment. Following previous studies, we used two criteria to identify lead VC firms in each deal (Sorensen, 2007). When only one firm had invested in the target PC's first round, we identified the VC as the lead. In cases where the first round included multiple VCs, we identified the VC with the largest investment as the lead. After excluding inconsistent or missing data, we were left with $285~\\mathrm{VC}$ firms that participated in a total of 3,033 deals. Each VC firm took part in an average of 11 deals, resulting in 583 successful exits.  \n\n#### Variables  \n\n#### Dependent variable  \n\nWe used syndication as the dependent variable to account for the likelihood of VC investment through the alliance formation for each deal. It was coded ‘1’ if the VC firm invested through syndication and $\\mathbf{\\nabla}^{\\cdot}0^{\\cdot}$ in all other situations.  \n\n#### Independent variable  \n\nWe measured firms’ reputation with the most visible marker of a VC's prior performance: the IPO event. Successfully taking companies public helps VCs liquidate their investment and achieve positive cash flow. Furthermore, the media coverage of the IPO event can enhance the public awareness and, therefore, the legitimacy of the VC firms, allowing them to syndicate with better partners or invest in more promising PCs (Deephouse, 2000; Dacin, Oliver, and Roy, 2007). This endorsement effect is magnified in emerging markets such as China due to environmental uncertainty and information asymmetry. In previous studies, the number of IPOs has been widely applied to assess the reputation of VC firms (Dimov and Milanov, 2010; Park and Steensma, 2012). Accordingly, we examined VC reputation by the number of prior exits in China before the focal deal.  \n\nWe constructed the variable foreign to indicate the focal firm's country of origin. It was coded '1′ for firms registered or headquartered abroad and $\\mathbf{\\nabla}^{\\cdot}0^{\\cdot}$ for firms registered in China. Our data set included VC firms from 16 countries (regions) outside mainland China: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the U.K., and the U.S. The gross domestic product (GDP) per capita  indicates a substantial  difference  in economic development between China and these foreign countries (regions).  \n\nTable　1． Factor analysis results 　of 　institutional indicators   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Country-level institutional characteristics</td><td>Rotated factor loading</td></tr><tr><td>Business environment</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1.

We obtained institutional data from the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)'s database. EIU data have been employed to examine country-level institutional environments (Chakrabarti, Singh, and Mahmood, 2007; Chan, Isobe, and Makino, 2008). To confirm the proposed dimensions of China's institutional environment, we factor analyzed the relevant indicators for each year using principal components analysis with varimax rotation. The analysis generated two distinct factors (Table 1). We then used the factor scores to account for the business and political environment in China.  \n\n#### Controlvariable  \n\nWe included a group of control variables pertaining to the VCs and PCs. First, to control for the dependency between deals, we constructed industry experience by aggregating the number of deals in which the VC firm had invested before the focal deal. We also gauged Chinese experience as the number of years since the focal VC firm first invested in the Chinese market. Second, we captured the network embeddedness (network centrality） of a VC firm among its syndicate partners for the three most recent years using Bonacich's (1987) eigenvector centrality measure. Third, we controlled for foreign VCs’ network centrality prior to entry. Drawing on the VentureXpert database, we constructed investment matrices for the relevant time period that included all active foreign VC firms. We then gauged the eigenvector centrality score using the coinvestment matrices from the five most recent years when the focal VC first invested in the Chinese market. Fourth, we controlled for the age and the government ownership of each VC firm. VC firm age was the number of years since the firm was registered. Government ownership was equal to‘1'if the VCs were owned by the government. We also included two dummy variables, venture capital and private equity, to distinguish firms that focus on entrepreneurial ventures and those that concentrate on private equity.  \n\nWe used several variables tocontrol for the variations in the PC firms. As the geographic distribution of PC firms can influence VCs' investment strategies (Sorenson and Audia, 2000), we first controlled for the location of the PC. The VC investment is mainly concentrated in three political/economic centers in China: Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong. The number of IPOs and the amount of VC investment in these areas account for about 95 percent of the total in China. Accordingly, we coded $P C$ in major city as ‘1' if the funded PCs were located in Beijing, Shanghai, or Guangdong and $\\mathrm{{}^{\\circ}}0^{\\circ}$ otherwise. We also constructed PC overseas, which was equal to $\\mathbf{\\nabla}^{\\langle}1\\mathbf{\\nabla}^{\\rangle}$ if the funded PC were overseas and $\\mathrm{{}^{\\circ}}0^{\\circ}$ if they were not. Second, the syndication decisions of VCs may be influenced by the VCs’ preference for different stages of PC development (Shane and Stuart, 2002). Thus, we distinguished four stages of PC investment based on a widely applied classification (Pratt, 1984): seed stage, growth stage,expansion stage, and mature stage. Third, we included industry dummies across all models to control for the different competitive intensity and growth prospects across industries.  \n\n#### Model  \n\nWe employed logistic regressions to estimate the likelihood that a VC firm will choose to invest through syndication. A similar approach has been adopted by studies that analyze exchange partner selection (Podolny, 1993) and alliance formation decisions (Chung et al., 2000). The Hausman test fails to reject random effects in favor of fixed effects estimators (Hausman, 1978). Due to our focus on the heterogeneity of syndication decisions among VC firms, we used random effects in the reported models and fixed effects for a robustness test. Because previous characteristics may affect firms’ subsequent decisions, we applied a one-year lag to all time variant independent variables and control variables in every model.  \n\n### RESULT  \n\nTable 2 presents the summary statistics and correlation matrix for all variables. Table 3 reports our major findings. H1 predicts an inverted U-shaped relationship between firm reputation and the likelihood to form an alliance. The coefficients for reputation and reputation square in Model 3 confirm our hypothesis. The reputation enhancement will first increase VC firms’ likelihood to syndicate and then decrease their tendency to do so after a certain threshold.  \n\nH2 proposes different effects of reputation on alliance formation between domestic and foreign firms, such that the threshold at which the positive effect of reputation on alliance formation turns negative is lower for foreign firms. Consistent with our argument, the coefficients of the interactions between reputation and foreign in Model 4 are negative and significant. To correctly interpret the moderating effects in a nonlinear model, we further separated the samples based on firm ownership. The results stay consistent.  \n\nTable 2.

The interactions between reputation and institutional development (business environment and political environment） in Model 6 are significant and negative, indicating a lower threshold for more mature institutions. Therefore, H3 is supported.  \n\n#### Robustness check  \n\nThese results are robust to a variety of sensitivity analyses. First, the curvilinear relationship between reputation and alliance formation may be driven by the search for different resources from different partners. To rule out the alternative explanation, we applied a multinomial logit model to test the relative probability of different types of alliances (foreign only, domestic only, and both foreign and domestic) to the stand-alone option (Parmigiani and Mitchell, 2009). The inverted-U relationship between reputation and the likelihood of syndication is confirmed.  \n\nSecond, we constructed two alternative measures for the reputation of VC firms. We constructed the IPO ratio, which was equal to the number of prior exits in China divided by the total number of investments before the focal deal. We also constructed a categorical variable VC rank published by the Zero2IPO research institute. Both results are in consistence with our proposition.  \n\nThird, we used a dummy variable, year 2004, as an alternative to measure different stages of institutional development. Year 2004 marks the turning point between the early and the later phase because important regulations designed to promote VC and entrepreneurial activities became effective in 2004. The moderating effect of year 2004 is negative and significant, thus lending support to H3. In addition, we ran separate regressions for each year. As predicted, the thresholds at which the negative effects of reputation outweigh the positive are lower in more recent years.  \n\nFourth, we employed a Wu-Hausman test to address the potential endogeneity issue and used Heckman's two-stage model to assess the potential reverse causality issue. Fifth, we excluded Hong Kong and Taiwan firm data from the sample. Sixth, we confined our sample to the first investment by each VC firm to eliminate the dependence among multiple deals by the same VC. Finally, we excluded PCs that were older than 10 years. All the findings conform to our hypotheses.  \n\n### DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION  \n\nIn this study, we systematically demonstrate an inverted U-shaped pattern between firms’ reputations and their likelihood of forming alliances and illustrate how this pattern is contingent on foreignness and different levels of institutional development. This study contributes to the literature on alliance formation, reputation, and international management.  \n\nPrior studies have highlighted the important role that organizational resources play in shaping firms' decisions regarding whether or not to form an alliance. While some studies have adopted the need perspective and emphasized a negative association between firms’ resource positions and their likelihood to form alliances, others have focused on the opportunity perspective and suggested a positive association. The curvilinear effect we found in this study supports the coexistence of the opposing mechanisms of need and opportunity. Essentially, our results suggest that firms will be most likely to form alliances when they reach an intermediate level of reputation because they have both the need and the opportunity to do so. More importantly, we examine the contingencies of foreignness and institutional development to further disentangle opportunity from need, which enable us to unpack the complex mechanisms underlying the relationship between resources and alliance formation.  \n\nWith respect to the reputation literature, most studies have focused on the link between reputation and performance. Few studies, however, have examined the effect of reputation on firms’ alliance behavior. Moreover, prior studies have generally taken a unidirectional approach when examining the role of reputation. For example, Dollinger et al. (1997) show that a focal firm's reputation increases others’ willingness to collaborate with it. However, highly reputable firms that are attractive to potential partners may not have the need to enter into alliances. Instead, they may be more inclined to go alone. By applying an integrative perspective of opportunity and need in studying reputation, we have revealed the dual nature of reputation in shaping firms’ strategic decisions. This finding also offers a significant practical implication. Managers who are contemplating interfirm relationships should perform closed monitoring of the reputation development of potential partners prior to initiating an alliance. Being better informed about these potential partners’ critical reputation levels may allow a firm to have a strategic advantage in the course of searching and forming alliances.  \n\nIn addition, this study provides insights into the international management literature and the issue of liability of foreignness in particular (Zaheer, 1995). One of our most intriguing findings is the different tendencies toward alliance formation in response to reputation enhancement between domestic and foreign firms. We find that foreign firms reach the peak of the inverted-U shape earlier than domestic firms, which indicates that foreign firms are more likely to opt for the standalone approach as they develop a track record of successes. This finding is consistent with the widely held belief that foreign firms will prefer the alliance approach to wholly owned subsidiaries due to the liability of foreignness (Hennart, 1988). Because reputation serves as an important countermechanism for the liability of foreignness, foreign firms are much less likely to form alliances as their reputations improve. To further examine this mechanism, we added the interaction between reputation and network centrality prior to entry into our model. The interaction is significantly negative, indicating that foreign firms with a better reputation prior to their entry into China will opt for the stand-alone approach more quickly once they establish their reputations in China. In addition, foreign firms may enjoy the advantage of foreignness in some areas—for instance, by being subject to less institutional pressure to conform to local norms compared to domestic firms. In the context of China's VC industry, foreign firms are not as bounded by the norm of guanxi as are domestic firms; therefore, they will be more likely to go alone as their reputations increase.  \n\nOur focus on China affords us a unique opportunity to examine how institutions and resources interact to shape firms’ strategic choices in emerging economies. The importance of social relationships in emerging economies has been widely documented in prior research (Xin and  \n\nPearce, 1996; Peng and Luo, 2000). Our results suggest that while social relationships remain important, the extent to which firms rely on their competitive competences to network with other companies may still change as institutions develop. It is worth noting that the negative moderating effect of institutional development on reputation does not mean that reputation will play a less important role in a firm's strategy and performance as the institution develops. Instead, it implies that reputation may actually have a greater independent effect on firm performance when the institutional environment is developed, as more reputable firms become less dependent on networks and alliances.  \n\nThis study can be extended by future research in a number of ways. First, although our focus is on reputation, we believe that the underlying mechanisms can be applied to study other resources that may be determinants of alliance formation, such as status, innovativeness, and social capital. Understanding firms’ signals about how their resources are orchestrated can facilitate potential partners to effectively integrate resources and achieve successful alliances.  \n\nSecond, in this study, we adopt a performancebased definition of reputation  (Washington and Zajac, 2005) and employ the most direct indicator of reputation: past success. Nevertheless, reputation has multiple facets. A firm can have a reputation for high-quality products (Rhee and Haunschild, 2006), business integrity (Jensen and Roy, 2008), or being cooperative (Baum et al., 2000). It will be interesting for future studies to distinguish various aspects of reputation and to examine their distinctive influences on firms' alliance behavior.  \n\nAnother possible direction for future research is to move beyond the question of whether or not to form an alliance and instead to investigate choices of alliance partners. We have made some efforts to explore this. Based on the first-round syndications in our data, we find that the pattern of firms’ partner selection changes as the institution develops over time. Both domestic and foreign VC firms are more likely to syndicate with foreign VCs at an early stage of institutional development. As the institution matures, however, syndications with domestic VCs increase substantially and eventually exceed those with foreign VCs. When we use the subsample of domestic VC firms, we find that an alliance consisting of both foreign and domestic firms is more likely to occur than an alliance consisting of only domestic firms. This suggests that complementarity of resources may be a factor in alliance formation. Other factors that can affect partner selection include resource complementarity, geographic proximity (Stuart and Sorenson, 2003), repetitive relationships (Beckman, Haunschild, and Phillips, 2004), and status homophily (Chung et al., 2000).  \n\nFinally, while we are confident that our theory and findings can be extended to other contexts (especially emerging economies), a comparative study of firm alliance formation in Europe, North America, and Asia would be an interesting avenue for future research.  \n\nIn summary, our study presents an integrative framework of how a firm's reputation affects its decisions of alliance formation. The inverted Ushaped relationship between a firm's reputation and its likelihood of alliance formation manifests the coexistence of and the interplay between the opposing mechanisms of need and opportunity. Overall, this research highlights the importance of incorporating the dual nature of organizational resources in the understanding of a firm's strategic decisions.  \n\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  \n\nThis research is supported by NUS Research Grant R-313-000-077-112.We would like to thank Coeditor Will Mitchell and two anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments.

While much of the literature on information asymmetries focuses on patent applications, we argue that the entire examination process should be considered, including information that emerges in the course of patent examination and review. We test several hypotheses using a sample of British and German companies that seek venture capital. We find that the filing of patent applications is positively related to VC financing.

Introduction  \n\nThe quality of intangible assets, such as know-how, business concepts and technologies is often more difficult toassess for outsiders than for insiders (Lev, 2001). To limit the perils of asymmetric information, economic agents need to communicate the quality of their projects or ventures to investors, potential partners and customers. We are particularly interested in how entrepreneurs communicate quality to venture capitalists (VCs) as external providers of equity, since VC financing is among the most important forms of financing for startups with high growth potential(Gompers and Lerner, 2004). Previous studies have shown that founders use a variety of mechanisms to signal quality, e.g.. through forming an alliance with a prominent partner (Stuart et al., 1999), their industrial and entrepreneurial experience (Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven,1990; Burton et al., 2002; Hsu, 2007), certain top management team characteristics (Zhang and Wiersema, 2009; Higgins and Gulati, 2006), or by choosing a particular board composition (Certo, 2003). Several authors have pointed out that technology-based startups may also want to utilize patent rights to communicate the quality of their underlying technologies to investors (e.g., Lemley, 2000; Mann and Sager, 2007; Hsu and Ziedonis, 2013, Conti et al., 2013a). However, the relationship between the information generated by the patenting process and VC-financing has turned out to be a complex one. Besides serving as a signaling device, patent information may convey two additional types of information: information about the strength of protection of the underlying technology and information about the prospects of theventurewhichis evennewtothefounders of theventure.  \n\nIn our paper, we seek to contribute to the literature by presenting a framework in which the filing of a patent application is a signal which informs investors' expectations in terms of a venture's prospects. This aspect is not novel. But going beyond previous studies, we argue that subsequent processes at the patent office generate a flow of information which allows investors to update the initially formed expectations. While prior literature has mainly relied on a static interpretation of the informational value of patent applications, we complement this perspective by taking subsequent information processes into account which allow dynamic updating of expectations formed by the initial signal.  \n\nOur theoretical discussion suggests that once companies reach a quality threshold (e.g., in the development of their invention), they can inform third parties about their quality by filing patent applications. VCs should be able to observe the actions of the patent applicant and draw conclusions from these actions. Explanatory power should therefore reside with the filing of applications. However, over time, the patent office will generate additional information pertaining to the quality of the patent. Moreover, if competitors oppose a patent grant, they may also become engaged in the information updating process. If information of this type affects VC financing in a major way, the entire patenting process appears relevant for our understanding of how information asymmetries are reduced over time.  \n\nEmpirically, we utilize a unique survey dataset of 190 VCseeking German and British biotechnology companies to test our theoretical reasoning. The survey provides us with comprehensive information on the technologies used by the startups, the riskiness of the ventures, the origin of the startups and their target market. We have also identified all patent applications filed and all patent grants received by these companies. The ventures in our sample predominantly file their applications at the European Patent Office (EPO). For these EPO patent applications, a particularly rich set of data is available, which contains information from search reports and from the EPO's opposition procedure. We assemble from these data sources a panel dataset and employ hazard-rate models with time-varying covariates to test our hypotheses. Our results suggest that the information generated in the course of the patenting process is indeed useful to VCs, and that positive information from the patent system significantly increases the hazard of VC financing, while negative information reduces it.  \n\nFollowing a 'pin factory' approach (see Borenstein et al., 1998), we complement our econometric results with information from interviewswithVCs.Bothourestimates and the qualitativeresults support our assumption that patent applications per se significantly impact VC financing. But subsequent information generated in the course of the patenting process also contributes to explaining VC financing events by allowing VCs to update the expectations formed initially.This is true even after controlling for the fact that VCs can anticipate information by carefully reading the patent application. Based on our theoretical framework and empirical results, we develop a number of implications and recommendations.  \n\nWhile empirical research on signaling has gained momentum in the past years, applying signaling theory as developed by Spence (1973) to real-world contexts has not been without difficulties. In particular, scholars in the field of strategic management and organization have noted that transferring signaling theory to the context of companies is challenging, since the ability to interpret signals may vary among actors (Connelly et al., 2011) and agreement on a specific action that serves as a signal is hard to achieve (Holm, 1995). Recently, Montiel et al. (2012) have argued that the current literature typically does not take into account the institutional context and design through which signals are being diffused. By simply assuming that regulatory institutions work effectively, the literature has so far understated the need for appropriate institutional design.  \n\n### 2.2. The impact of patents on VC financing decisions  \n\nFollowing this line of reasoning, we add the observation that the limitations of signaling theory become even more apparent when a specific action - which can be a signal - starts an institutional process. Signaling theory restricts its attention to the initial action or impulse and the sender of the signal, but may not give sufficient attention to subsequent mechanisms or institutional processes. These may be set in motion by the signal and tend to generate valuable information over time. In this paper, we outline a more comprehensive framework which takes both the initial signal and subsequent information generating processes into account. A signal is a helpful mechanism when the quality of an actor or project is not directly observable (Stuart et al., 1999). We argue that individuals form expectations based on a signal, but may still be under considerable uncertainty. But, as receivers gather more information about an issue, and this information might be triggered by the signal, they derive tighter estimates (Benoit and Dubra, 2011). Hence, the subsequent information results in an update of information and also tends to reduce uncertainty.1 Bayes' Rule is frequently used to describe how individuals update their expectations or beliefs under uncertainty. Related research by behavioral economists has mainly investigated if and in which contexts individuals update their expectations according to Bayes' Rule (Rabin and Schrag, 1999; Charness and Levin, 2005; Charness et al.,2007) and which type of information triggers updating (Eil and Rao, 2011; Chambers and Healy, 2012). Our approach is to link the signaling theory with an updating process. This allows us to build a framework which is in line with various real life situations in which a signal is coupled with an information generating process initiated by the signal. Hence, our study emphasizes the dynamic accumulation of information over time, which may include 'good' and ‘bad' news.  \n\n## 2. Theory and hypotheses  \n\n### 2.1. Signals for forming and subsequent information for updating expectations  \n\nSpence (2002, 407) characterizes signals as ‘things one does that are visible and that are in part designed to communicate'. Signaling theory is based on the assumption that an effective signal is too costly for low-quality actors to pursue. In an equilibrium separating high- from low-quality actors, the signal allows outsiders to distinguish among different types of actors. In the context of new ventures seeking VC financing, the founders are better informed about the quality of their venture (e.g., the ability of the management team, development stage and success chances of the product or technology) than a potential investor. An effective signaling device would allow investors to distinguish accurately between new ventures in terms of quality and potential return on investment.  \n\nIn our paper, we focus on information generated through the patenting process. A large strand of literature has investigated the traditional view of patents as an asset (see Hall and Harhoff, 2012). Long (2002） notes that the signaling function of patents has been overlooked in much of the earlier literature. Patents may indicate to outsiders that a company has developed its technology to a certain extent and that it has‘defined and carved out a market niche' (Lemley, 2001,1505).  \n\nA number of scholars have recently investigated the signaling role of patents for investors. Heeley et al. (2007) study the role of patents in IPO underpricing and argue that the role of patents in the reduction of information asymmetries is highly contextdependent. In a recent study, Hsu and Ziedonis (2013) report that patents have a positive effect on investors' estimates of company value for a sample of VC-financed semiconductor startups. They find stronger effects for early funding rounds, where information asymmetry is more pronounced, and for companies which lack alternative means of signaling quality to investors. Furthermore, Conti et al. (2013a) suggest a model including the preferences of externalinvestors andshow that thiseffects thefounders'investment in patents as signals. They outline that VCs take patent signals into account while angel investors do not.  \n\nMann and Sager (2007） investigate correlations between the availability of patents and performance indicators. Without taking the timing of events into account, they generally find positive correlations.Baum and Silverman(2004)examine some of the selection criteria used by VCs and subsequent company performance and find a positive association between patent applications at the USPTO and pre-IPo financing. The effect of patent grants is also positive, but considerably smaller than that of patent applications. In comparison to thesepapers,our contribution contains a more detailed assessment of the information flow generated by the patent office and of its impact on a startup's first VC financing. By taking the timing of patent information into account, we are able to address endogeneity concerns.  \n\nThe existing literature has largely focused on companies with VC financing and on subsequent performance measures such as IPO or company profitability. Evidence on whether patents play a role in the initial selection decision of VCs is still scarce (for an exception see Cockburn and MacGarvie, 2009), and there is no empirical evidence as to which information from the patent system is taken into account. We aim to fill this gap and provide a detailed study on the role of the patent system as information provider; in doing so, we take the timing, type and source of information that is produced in the course of the patenting process into account.  \n\nWe consider these aspects to be potentially important and in need of detailed analysis. Given that first-round financing is the starting point of the relationship between VCs and startups, it is of some importance to gain more insight into determinants of VC financing at this stage. At this particular point, VCs need to make their investment decisions under considerable uncertainty. Technology startups are typically hard to evaluate when they seek to obtain external financing for the first time. They do not have a track record that is indicative of their growth potential, they are often years away from first revenues, their assets are mostly intangible and they are plagued by a high failure rate. Moreover, VCs are often under considerable time pressure to make investment decisions. Information generated by patent filings and in the subsequent patenting process may therefore have considerable impact.  \n\n### 2.3.Sources of information within the patent system  \n\n#### 2.3.1. The entrepreneur as initiator of the patenting process  \n\nBy filing a patent application, an entrepreneur informs that the startup has matured sufficiently to invest in the protection of the technology it is developing for commercialization. We build on Spence's definition of a (productive) signal (1973, 1974, 2002) and argue that patent applications provide a mechanism to sort companies and, thus, are related to the presence of a separating equilibrium (Long, 2002; Hsu and Ziedonis, 2013; Conti et al., 2013b). The criteria of patenting require an invention to be novel, inventive and capable of industrial application. The preparation of patent applications requires effort and time, since applicants have to follow strict guidelines and describe technical information in detail. In addition, patenting is quite costly as applicants have to cover fees, translation costs,as well as the fees of patent lawyers. We follow Conti et al. (2013b) in arguing that the effort and cost involved in showing that an invention is in line with the patenting criteria, are a decreasing function of the quality of the underlying technology. Hence, the filing of a patent informs outsiders that an inventionhas been sufficiently developed tobe described in a patent application. This conceptualization is similar to the educational model by Spence whereby the“employer reads the educational signal and predicts productivity with it\" (Spence, 1974, 297). While Spence (1974, 301) illustrates that signaling may work even if acquiring the signal does not affect the ability of the individual, he also states that “the signal can be directly productive as embodied human capital of some kind. Both education and job experience probably fit this description\". A patent application might, in addition to signaling, provide value for the company by facilitating the protection of the technology. Thus, we follow the broader conceptualization of a patent application as a signal by allowing the signal to be correlated with the actual quality of the underlying venture.  \n\nOur empirical tests use data on patent applications at the EPO. This choice entails several important advantages for our empirical investigation. First, obtaining patent protection in Europe via the EPO is considerably more costly than at the USPTO (de Rassenfosse and van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie, 2007). Second, contrary to the USPTO, patent filings at the EPO involve a strong ex ante commitment by the patent applicant. There are no provisional patents at the EPO which can be easily amended later. Moreover, the possibility of filing continuations is more limited at the EPO than at the USPTO. Thus, the initial EPO filing commits the applicant more strongly than it would at the USPTO.This is important as it makes the signaling story more compelling: the applicant will only submit a filing once a minimum quality standard for the invention is reached. Third, at the EPO the examiner has greater decisionmaking authority than at the USPTO and may ultimately stop the examination process with a rejection of the application. Fourth, by using data from the EPO we are able to observe unsuccessful applications that were never granted. Using USPTO data would not allow us to do that for longer periods. Finally, third parties can intervene and improve the quality of information to a greater extent than at other patent offices,thus contributingto the processofinformation aggregation (Graham and Harhoff, 2009). Hence, EPO data provide a particularly suitable institutional setting in which we can test our hypotheses  \n\nAs already outlined, patents not only reveal information, but are also attractive assets from the VC's perspective, since they allow the venture to exclude rivals from using the underlying product or technology. In addition, patents may facilitate the licensing of technology (e.g., Gans et al., 2008; Haeussler, 2011), giving the venture an additional source of revenue. Moreover, patents enable VCs to recover some salvage value from failing companies (Hall and Harhoff, 2012). Hence, it can be expected that companies in need of capital willbeinformed about thepotentiallyhelpfulroleofpatents and will try to obtain patents ifthe cost of doing sois not too high for them. Our most basic hypothesis therefore postulates a relationship between the filing of a patent application and VC investment:  \n\nHypothesis 1. As startups file patent applications, the likelihood of obtaining VC financing increases.  \n\nThis hypothesis serves as the starting point of our evaluation. However, empirical evidence supporting this hypothesis is subject to various caveats. Harhoff et al. (1999), among others, have shown that patent value has a highly skewed distribution, with very few patents being highly valuable. Hence, the patent application per se may be of limited value for identifying particularly promising investment targets from a VC's perspective. A clearer picture may emerge, once further information provided by the patent examination process is considered in more detail. With the patent application, the entrepreneur sets in motion an institutionalized process at the patent office. The process itself provides a rich source of technological and commercial information, but also includes the assessment of various third parties which are called to intervene and allow investors to update their expectation about a company's prospects.Please note that we onlyinterpret the original patent application as a signal. The subsequent information which emerges in the course of the patenting process is seen as a refinement regarding the value of the original signal but not as new signal per se.2 In the following sections we will take a closer look at these sources of information, which have been neglected in the existing literature.  \n\n#### 2.3.2. The patent office as information provider  \n\nWhile the filing of patent applications may provide a first indicator of the technological progress of a company, the information contained in patent filings is technical and often only accessible to individuals with considerable expertise (Heeley et al., 2007). However, the patent office may act as an independent and objective evaluator of the patent's quality. Information by the patent system is guided by official procedures and in this respect more objective and credible than the information provided by the entrepreneur. If VCs want to take‘official' information into account, they can use the information contained in the patent office's search reports, in which examiners include their view of the underlying prior art. Such search reports are made publicly available quite early on in the patenting process, typically 18 months after a patent has been filed for the first time. The assessment contained in the search report will affect the likelihood of a patent being granted and the scope of the patent, if it is granted. It may therefore affect the financing decision. Hence, we propose:  \n\nHypothesis 2. The more favorable the evaluation of the startup's patents in the search reports, the shorter the time to receiving VC financing.  \n\nUsually the search report is published together with the patent application 18 months after the priority date of the patent filing. However, in some cases there is a delay in the publication of the search report, which prolongs the period of uncertainty concerning the potential scope of the patent right. Delays in search reports occur for purely administrative reasons and are unrelated to the quality of the underlying invention. They mostly occur if the patent office experiences a shortage of examiners in a given technology field. We treat these delays as exogenous sources of variation in our data which can be used to identify the impact of information flows on VC financing. Unanticipated publication of a supplementary search report may occur as well; this report then contains additional prior art discovered in the course of examination and thus reduces the scope of the patent. Both types of events may be interpreted as a prolongation or even an increase in uncertainty, which is likely to reduce the attractiveness of a startup for a potential investor. This leads us to our third hypothesis:  \n\nHypothesis 3. Delays in the publication of search reports and publication of additional search reports cause uncertainty and thus increase the time to receiving VC financing.  \n\nWhereas the search report is available quite early, the final decision at the EPO to grant the patent is made about three to four years after the application has been filed. Clearly, a granted patent will be of higher value to a startup (and thus to a VC) than a mere patent application, as the grant offers higher certainty concerning the scope and strength of patent protection. However, if the VC has inspected the patent application and the search report and has come to a positive assessment with sufficient confidence, then the grant event may not include surprising information. To summarize,we expect thatVCs will - on average- react favorably to grant decisions:  \n\nHypothesis 4. The patent office's decision to grant a patent positively affects the likelihood of VC financing.  \n\n#### 2.3.3. Technology followers as an information source  \n\nThe patenting process not only reveals the quality assessment by the patent office but also elicits valuable third-party information on the quality of a technology and on its commercial potential. Early information about the commercial value of a technology is of utmost importance for an investor in startups. While patent office examiners as insiders are highly qualified to judge the technical novelty and inventive step, technology followers and competing companies are most qualified to reveal information about the commercial value of apatented invention.  \n\nIn our setting,technology followers,whom we identify via patent citations, build their inventions on the basis of a venture's patented technology. The presence of technology followers may provide indirect information about the attractiveness and potential of a patented invention.Previousliterature has shown that the number of citations received is positively related to the economic and technological importance of the underlying technology (e.g.. Jaffe et al., 2005). Moreover, a large follower might even be considered to be an attractive licensing partner for the venture. VCs can make use of this information in order to decide to invest in a startup.Hence, we expect that:  \n\nHypothesis 5. Startups with highly cited patents and with patents cited by large technology followers receive VC financing faster than startupswithout such patents.  \n\nThe patent system also generates information on a patent's potential value through the opposition mechanism. In the first nine months after the grant of a patent, any third party can file an opposition at the EPO. Because engaging in an opposition procedure is costly, we expect that a technology has high commercial value, if a third party engages in opposition (Harhoff and Reitzig, 2004). However, an opposition also indicates that the patent faces a threat of revocation. Statistically, the VC can expect that the patent is revoked in one third of the cases, while the opposition is rejected or the patent is maintained in amended form in the remaining two thirds of cases (Harhoff and Reitzig, 2004). Interestingly, an opposition exhibits inconsistent information in terms of the future commercial prospects of the venture. While it threatens to undermine the strength of patent protection, it also conveys credible information about future market prospects of the invention. As such, opposition provides an opportunity to test whether the positive information about the market potential or the negative information in terms of patenting protection dominate empirically.  \n\nOverall, we conjecture that the aspect of value discovery in the opposition proceeding may be considerably more important than the threat of revocation. We come to this conclusion as it is well known that market-related information on the commercial potential of a venture is rarely available, though such information is highly relevant for investors. An opposition filed by a competitor thus informs the VC about commercial prospects and contributes to an updating of the expected value of the company and a reduction of uncertainty.3 Second, proponents of the updating literature have shown that individuals react to a positive update of information stronger than to negative information (Eil and Rao, 2011; Camerer and Lovallo, 1999). This suggests that the positive impact of an opposition outweighs the negative impact.  \n\nThus, we hypothesize:  \n\nHypothesis 6. Startups whose patents are being opposed in postgrant reviews receive VC financing faster.  \n\nThe patenting process generates detailed information about the technology of the potential portfolio company. This information can be of a positive or negative nature. We end our hypothesis development with a summary hypothesis of how we expect information generated in the course of the patenting process to be relevant to funding decisions:  \n\nHypothesis 7. If the patent system reveals positive information regarding the patents of a startup, the time to receiving VC financing decreases. Conversely, if it discloses negative information, the respective time increases.  \n\n## 3. Data and sample  \n\n### 3.1. Data and sample description  \n\nWe study the role of information generated in the course of patenting for VC financing in the German and British biotechnology industry.Our database combines informationfrom a 2006 company survey of German and British biotechnology companies with detailed information from patent offices. The relevant population comprises all companies active in the bio-pharmaceutical sector according to the OECD definition (OECD, 2005). We identified the population for our analysis using several industry sources (e.g., Bio Commerce, Dechema, Biocom, and regional databases like erbi and Bio-M) and internet resources. Companies not founded in one of the two countries, subsidiaries of foreign companies and companies offering solely services or supplying products without conducting research were excluded. The companies we identified were validated against our selection criteria with the help of biologists and biotechnologists. We ended up with a well-defined population of 346 German and 343 British core biotechnology companies that were at least one year old. We performed face-to-face interviews with 162 German and 118 British companies from this population using a preformatted and intensively tested questionnaire.4  \n\nThe objective of the current analysis is to shed light on how information generated during the patenting process influences VC financing. Therefore, we excluded companies that - according to our survey responses - were not interested in VC financing, either because they did not want to give up control of the company or were not in need of vC financing.5 Moreover, we only included companies that were founded after 1990. Our analysis is based on  \n\n116 German and 74 British companies that match our criteria and for which we have all the data needed to test our hypotheses. Of these, 87 received VC financing by the end of our sampling period, while 103 did not. For these 190 companies we compiled data on all patents filed at the EPO. We used information from an EPO patent database and from EPO search reports in order to operationalize the variables that measure the emergence of information which VCshaveaccessto.6  \n\n### 3.2. Measures  \n\n#### 3.2.1. Dependent variable  \n\nThe dependent variable in our analysis is the time of first VC financing. The variable is measured on a quarterly basis. The last time period observed in the data is the second quarter of 2005. Data are right-censored if the company has not obtained VC financing by the date of the survey.  \n\n#### 3.2.2. Independent variables  \n\nThe main variables of interest in the regression specification contain patent-related information.All patent-related variables are measured on a quarterlybasis.We use thevariable EPO applicationstock toinvestigatetheinfluenceof thecumulativenumber of patent applications filed at the EPO. This variable is time-variant, i.e.,it measures the size of the application stock as it could be observed in each quarter.For the empirical analysis we use the natural logarithm of the stock variable, assuming that additional patent applications would have a decreasing marginal effect on the hazard rate (Hall et al., 2009). We increase the stock by one before calculating the logarithm in order not to lose observations for companies without patent applications.  \n\nThesearchreportspublishedby the EPOprovide theearliest official information about the quality of an application. The prior art references in the search report are allocated to one of several categories. An X-type reference means that a claim about a certain aspect of the invention cannot be considered novel or inventive, and that the claim may thus not deserve patent protection. A Y-type reference is also detrimental to the novelty requirement, but only calls a claim into question if it is combined with another Y reference.We compute the variable share high proportion X/Y references as the share of patent applications that receive a proportion ofX and Y references, which is in the highest decile of all applications held by the companies included in our analysis. A Y reference is given half the weight of an X reference in our composite measure.7 Applications with a high share of X and Y references can be considered to have low novelty or inventive step. Harhoff and Wagner (2009) show that such applications are particularly likely to be refused or withdrawn at the EPo.  \n\nPatent applications at the EPO are published 18 months after the priority date in a so-called A1 publication. The A1 document typically contains a search report. However, due to delays and backlogs at the patent office, the search report may not have been completed - in this case, the publication is made in an A2 document. The search report is then published later separately as a separate A3 document. Whether publication occurs with (A1) or without search report (A2) is not known ex ante, nor is the publication date of the A3 document. The publication of an A2 document therefore indicates a prolongation of the period during which external parties have no access to the patent office's assessment of novelty and inventive step of the application. Moreover, the EPO may decide at any time to issue an additional (supplementary) search report, the A4 document, if further prior art becomes available. Typically, A4 documents contain negative news, since the previously published search results were incomplete. The timing of an A4 document is not tied to any schedule, either. The publication of either A2 or A4 documents is therefore likely to be interpreted as negative news. During our sampling period, first publications were A1 documents in $64.4\\%$ . and A2 documents in $35.6\\%$ of all cases. Supplementary reports (A4) were issued in $10.5\\%$ of all cases.8 The variable separate search reports/application stock gives the time-variant share of patent applications that are subject either to unexpected delays in the publication of the search report (A2) or to the presence of supplementary search reports (A4).  \n\nA further step in the process pursued by the patent office is the grant decision (which is published at the EPO as the B1 document). The variable share granted EPO applications is the share of patent applications that have already been granted at the time of the respective quarter.  \n\nAs a measure of the quality of a company's patent portfolio, we use the variable share highly cited patents. For the patents held by the companies included in our analysis we calculate the distribution of patent citationsreceived within thefirst four years after publication (this occurs 18 months after priority). A patent application is counted as highly cited from the quarter onwards in which its citations reach the highest decile of this distribution(which corresponds to three citations). We count citations in the quarter in which the search report of the citing patent was published. Thus, theinformation used for the calculation of this variableis derived from publicly available information. We exclude self-citations to focus our measure on the impact of a company's patent on subsequent technological developments outside the focal company. The variable share highly cited patent is calculated as the number of highly cited applications divided by the total number of applications. This variable should indicate whether a company has potentially valuable applications, i.e., applications that are of special interest to VCs. As a further measure of quality and commercial potential, we use the variable cited by large technology follower, which is a dummy equal to one if at least one application of the focal company has been cited by a large company. A company is defined as large if it generates at least 15 citations to the applications of our sample companies. With this definition we cover the most active $5.0\\%$ of the citing companies. Share opposed patents measures the share of the patent applications that received an opposition. It is calculated as the total number of oppositions received, divided by the application stock. Oppositions are measured at the quarter in which they occur, divided by the patent application stock in that specific quarter.  \n\nTo come to a more parsimonious specification, we aggregate the information generated during and after the examination process into positive news and negative news. We calculate these aggregate measures by summing the standardized values of the underlying variables.Positivenews is composed ofsharehighlycitedpatents, cited by large technology follower and share opposed patents; negative news is composed of share high proportion X/Y references and separatesearchreports/applicationstock.  \n\n#### 3.2.3.Control variables  \n\nThe regressions also contain controls for company characteristics. All company characteristics are defined with reference to the time of founding. Technological capabilities are proxies for the skill set of the employees. The variable depicts the number of biotechnical methods a company is working with at the time of foundation, e.g., DNA, proteins and molecules or cell and tissue culture. This may include up to nine methods. High risk startup measures the self-reported risk at founding that the company would fail to bring its technology to the market.9 The variable CEO industry experience is included to account for the experience of entrepreneurs. Previous research has shown that experienced entrepreneurs are more likely to be able to secure financial resources and go IPo (Gompers et al., 2010). In a related study, Hsu and Ziedonis (2013) show that patents are less relevant to entrepreneurs with IPO experience who seek funding from a prominent VC investor. Our variable CEO industry experienceis coded1 when thefounder CEOhas worked inbiotechnology or in the pharmaceutical industry in a leading position, and 0 when the founder has not accumulated industry experience before founding the focal company.  \n\nAt themacroeconomiclevel,theregressions include acontrol for the supply conditions in the market for VC financing (early stage financings). The early stage financings are comprised of seed and startup financings. The data for Germany were taken from the annual statistical publication of the German Private Equity and Venture Capital Association‘BVK Statistik'(BVK, 2007); the data for the UK were taken from the statistical publication of the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association ‘Report on investmentactivity ${}_{2006},$ (BVCA, 2007).The average number of annual early stage financings over the sample period 1990-2005 is 401 for Germany and 307 for the UK.  \n\nFinally,the binary variable therapeutics is equal to one if at least one of the core areas of a company is in therapeutics. Other industries are diagnostics, vaccines or platform technologies. Spinout science is a dummy variable indicating that the company is a spin-out from a university or a publicly funded research institute. Spin-out company indicates a spin-out from a private-sector company. The reference group consists of independently founded companies. We also included controls for the founding period. We differentiate the periods 1990-1995, 1996-1999, 2000-2002, and 2003-2005. German company is a dummy indicating that the company is based in Germany as opposed to the UK.  \n\n## 4. Analysis and results  \n\n### 4.1. Descriptive statistics  \n\nIn Figs. 1 and 2, we explore the differences between VCfinanced and non VC-financed companies. While Fig. 1 does not account for the timing of VC financing, Fig. 2 includes only patent applications for VC-financed companies before they receive VC funding. Fig. 1 shows that VC-financed companies have a higher average number of patent applications per quarter than non VC-financed companies. Part of the difference can be due to the additional VC funds to support R&D. When excluding postfinancing information in Fig. 2, we find that VC-financed companies have slightly more patent applications than non VC-financed companiesin the first sixyears afterfounding,thereafter the differences become more pronounced. The descriptive statistics in Table 1 are calculated for the first 16 quarters (4 years) after founding and show pronounced differences between the patenting activities of VC-financed and non VC-financed companies. Please note that this table does not account for the timing in terms of pre and post VC financing, this is accounted for in the multivariate hazard model. The share of observations with at least one patent application is higher for VC-financed than for non VC-financed companies ( $46\\%$ Vs. $39\\%$ ). Furthermore, VC-financed companies have a larger application stock.There are also differences in the characteristics of the patent portfolios. Companies that receive VC financing have portfolios of applications with a lower incidence of the share of $\\mathsf{X-}$ and Y-type references and with a lower incidence of separate search reports. The share of granted patents is higher for VC-financed companies but the difference is only marginally significant. Again, applications ofVC-financed companies have a higher probability of being highly cited, being cited by a large company and receiving an opposition. When aggregating the information from the patent office, we find that VC-financed companies receive positive news more often and negative news less often than non VC-financed companies.10 Further differences in company characteristics are displayed in Table 2. Companies that receive VC financing have capabilities in more technical areas and are less likely to be a highrisk startup than startups that do not receive VC financing. Their CEOs are more likely to have gained industry experience before founding but the difference is not significant. Neither the type of founding nor whether the company is situated in Germany or the UK has a significant relationship with VC financing. However, companies founded during or shortly before the boom period of VC financing (1996-1999) have a higher probability of obtaining VC financing, as have companies that are active in the field of therapeutics.  \n\nTable1 Descriptivestatisticsoftime-variantvariables.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Variable</td><td colspan=\"3\">VC-financedcompanies</td><td colspan=\"3\">NonVC-financedcompanies</td><td rowspan=\"2\">Diff.mean p-Value</td></tr><tr><td>Obs</td><td>Mean</td><td>St.Dev.</td><td>Obs</td><td>Mean</td><td>St.Dev.</td></tr><tr><td>EPOapplication(0/1)</td><td>1258</td><td>0.46</td><td>一</td><td>1748</td><td>0.39</td><td>一</td><td>0.00</td></tr><tr><td>EPOapplicationstocka</td><td>864</td><td>5.27</td><td>6.98</td><td>696</td><td>3.42</td><td>3.37</td><td>0.00</td></tr><tr><td>SharehighproportionX/Yreferences</td><td>864</td><td>0.03</td><td>0.09</td><td>696</td><td>0.06</td><td>0.16</td><td>0.00</td></tr><tr><td>Separatesearchreports/appl.stocka</td><td>864</td><td>0.11</td><td>0.20</td><td>696</td><td>0.20</td><td>0.32</td><td>0.00</td></tr><tr><td>SharegrantedEPOapplicationsa</td><td>864</td><td>0.05</td><td>0.16</td><td>696</td><td>0.04</td><td>0.13</td><td>0.10</td></tr><tr><td>Sharehighly cited patents(excl.self-cites)a</td><td>864</td><td>0.003</td><td>0.014</td><td>696</td><td>0.001</td><td>0.017</td><td>0.00</td></tr><tr><td>Cited bylarge technologyfollower(0/1)</td><td>864</td><td>0.21</td><td></td><td>696</td><td>0.16</td><td>一</td><td>0.01</td></tr><tr><td>Shareopposedpatents</td><td>864</td><td>0.008</td><td>0.052</td><td>696</td><td>0.001</td><td>0.009</td><td>0.00</td></tr><tr><td>Positivenewsa</td><td>864</td><td>0.50</td><td>3.49</td><td>696</td><td>-0.13</td><td>1.73</td><td>0.00</td></tr><tr><td>Negativenewsa</td><td>864</td><td>0.07</td><td>1.37</td><td>696</td><td>0.76</td><td>2.34</td><td>0.00</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: The statistics refer to the first 16 quarters after founding.

Quarterly patent applications. Including only patents pre-financing for the VC-financed companies.  \n\n### 4.2. Multivariate methodology  \n\nUsing a proportional hazard model with time-varying covariates, we estimate the effect of a company's patenting activities on the hazard of acquiring VC financing in a specific quarter. From the date of founding onward, the companies are ‘at risk' of a VC investment. To accommodate time-varying covariates, we split the complete time period into quarter-year spells. The hazard of obtaining VC financing is defined as the probability of obtaining VC financing in the current period, given that no VC financing has been received up to the previous period. The Cox proportional hazard model accommodates the influence of covariates by multiplying the baseline hazard by a function of observables. The hazard function itself is estimated non-parametrically and can take any form. Companies that have not received VC financing by the time of the survey are treated as right-censored. Tied failure times are dealt with according to the Breslow method. In our data,we observed 190 companies for a total of 3001 quarterly observations. Of these, 87 companies received VC during our observation period, while the dependent variable is right-censored for 103 companies.  \n\nTable2 Descriptivestatistics oftime-invariantcontrolvariables.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Variable</td><td colspan=\"3\">VC-financedcompanies</td><td colspan=\"3\">NonVC-financedcompanies</td><td rowspan=\"2\">Diff.mean p-Value</td></tr><tr><td>Obs</td><td>Mean</td><td>St.Dev.</td><td>Obs</td><td>Mean</td><td>St.Dev.</td></tr><tr><td>Technologicalcapabilities</td><td>87</td><td>2.16</td><td>1.31</td><td>103</td><td>1.69</td><td>1.04</td><td>0.006</td></tr><tr><td>High riskstartup(0/1)</td><td>87</td><td>0.06</td><td></td><td>103</td><td>0.21</td><td></td><td>0.000</td></tr><tr><td>CEOindustryexperience</td><td>87</td><td>0.47</td><td></td><td>103</td><td>0.36</td><td></td><td>0.118</td></tr><tr><td>Spin-outscience(0/1)</td><td>87</td><td>0.61</td><td></td><td>103</td><td>0.53</td><td></td><td>0.297</td></tr><tr><td>Spin-out company(0/1)</td><td>87</td><td>0.06</td><td></td><td>103</td><td>0.12</td><td></td><td>0.156</td></tr><tr><td>Independentlyfounded(0/1)</td><td>87</td><td>0.33</td><td></td><td>103</td><td>0.35</td><td></td><td>0.793</td></tr><tr><td>Therapeutics(0/1)</td><td>87</td><td>0.64</td><td></td><td>103</td><td>0.47</td><td></td><td>0.014</td></tr><tr><td>Founded'90-'95(0/1)</td><td>87</td><td>0.09</td><td></td><td>103</td><td>0.14</td><td></td><td>0.345</td></tr><tr><td>Founded'96-'99(0/1)</td><td>87</td><td>0.39</td><td></td><td>103</td><td>0.23</td><td></td><td>0.019</td></tr><tr><td>Founded'00-'02(0/1)</td><td>87</td><td>0.46</td><td></td><td>103</td><td>0.49</td><td>一</td><td>0.627</td></tr><tr><td>Founded'03-'05(0/1)</td><td>87</td><td>0.06</td><td>一</td><td>103</td><td>0.14</td><td></td><td>0.073</td></tr><tr><td>German company(0/1)</td><td>87</td><td>0.63</td><td>一</td><td>103</td><td>0.59</td><td>一</td><td>0.574</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nVote: These variables are time-invariant, therefore one observation is available per company. For the dummy variables the last column shows the two-sample test of Oroportion.  \n\n### 4.3. Main results  \n\nOur hazard rate results are shown in Table 3 and shed light on whether patentinformationimpacts thetime toreceivingVCfinancing. Our estimation strategy is as follows: we present estimates from Cox proportional hazard models in which we include our time-varying patenting variables, as well as our control variables. In column (1) we introduce only one patenting-related variable - the logarithm of the application stock. This is the only component of information that is generated by the startup so it serves a signaling function. All other patent variables are generated by either the patent office or by rival companies. Consistent with H1, which is our base hypothesis, the application stock has a positive significant effect on the hazard. Thus, once companies apply for patent protection, they receive VC financing faster.  \n\nIn column (2) we add another six time-varying variables,which represent the information generated by the patent office and third parties. The first two variables are generated by the patent examiner: a high share of negative ‘marks' in the search report and the occurrence of belated search reports. The results suggest that concerns about novelty and/or inventive step matter for the timing of VC finance. The variables share high proportion X/Y references and separate search reports/appl. stock indicate a lower degree of novelty and/or inventive step. In line with H2 and H3, we find that VC financing will be delayed if the search reports contain a high number of negative references and if they are delayed.  \n\nAs an additional variable we include the share of granted patents. We find that, although the share of granted patents is positively related to VC financing, the coefficient is not significant so there is no statistical support for H4.11  \n\nWe do not find a positive and significant coefficient for share highly cited patent either; nevertheless, citations by large technology followers appear to speed up the time to receiving VC financing. Thus, the evidence for hypothesis H5 is mixed. It might be that the rich information provided by the search report reduces the surprise factor of the variable that captures the number of citations. Another reason might be that VCs focus on citations by large technology followers because these indicate relatively important commercial opportunities for licensing.  \n\nLastly, the variable share opposed patents has a significant hazard ratio that is larger than one. In support of H6, a company receives VC financing significantly faster if a relatively high share of patents is opposed by a third party. Oppositions can indicate that the company possesses a valuable technology that competitors would like to use as well. Thus, the occurrence of an opposition informs the VC about the commercial potential of a patent.  \n\nIn column (3), we aggregate the (standardized) variables into our construct of positive news and negative news. The aggregation indeed allows us to identify significant effects for positive and as well as for negative information, providing support for H7.12 This specification summarizes the main result of our analysis: the initial patent application as well as the information generated by the ensuingprocess at thepatent office constitutesvaluableinformationfor thefundingdecisions ofVCs.  \n\nIt is not clear a priori whether VCs need to rely at all on information generated by the patent system or if they can evaluate the technology of startups more cheaply on their own. Because entrepreneurs may be reluctant to disclose details of their invention to VCs before they have filed a patent application, we assume that VCs get full insight into the potential of a particular technology from the time of the filing. The question now arises whether VCs are able to evaluate fully the technology at the time of the patent application or whether they make use of the information which is generated by the patent system.  \n\nIf quality-related information were indeed fully anticipated at the time that the patent application is filed, then the timing of VC financing should be related to information that is effectively already available at the filing date. We can rigorously test for this possibility in our dataset since it contains time-series information.In order to do so, we define modified variants of \"good news\" and “bad news\" in which we time the variables describing the information from searchreports and other events to the date of application rather than to the actual event date. This is equivalent to assuming that the information revealed publicly is already available to VCs at the time of filing. Including both variables (timed separately on the date of disclosure and on the filing date) allows us to conduct a ‘horse race' test. If information is fully anticipated at the time of the filing, then our modified variable should perform better in statistical terms than thevariable timed to the official disclosuredate.  \n\nTable 3 Cox-hazard models.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variable</td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td></tr><tr><td>In EPO application stock</td><td>1.454***</td><td>1.564**</td><td>1.632***</td><td>1.496**</td><td>1.416</td><td>1.430</td></tr><tr><td>Share high proportion X/Y references</td><td>(0.181)</td><td>(0.245) 0.938*</td><td>(0.231)</td><td>(0.246)</td><td>(0.332)</td><td>(0.337)</td></tr><tr><td>(scaled by 100)</td><td></td><td>(0.032)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Separate search reports/appl.stock</td><td></td><td>0.979**</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>(scaled by 100)</td><td></td><td>(0.009)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Share granted EPO applications</td><td></td><td>1.115</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(0.995)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Share highly cited patents</td><td></td><td>0.992</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>(scaled by 100)</td><td></td><td>(0.041)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cited by large technology follower (0/1)</td><td></td><td>2.258*</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(0.900)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Share opposed patents</td><td></td><td>1.091**</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>(scaled by 100)</td><td></td><td>(0.043)</td><td>1.157***</td><td>1.148***</td><td>1.126**</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Positive news</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1.127**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.054)</td><td>(0.061)</td><td>(0.058)</td><td>(0.058)</td></tr><tr><td>Negative news</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.579</td><td>0.572*</td><td>0.591***</td><td>0.598***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.103)</td><td>(0.102)</td><td>(0.110)</td><td>(0.111)</td></tr><tr><td>Anticipated positive news</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1.057</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.084)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Anticipated negative news</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1.094</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.075)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Average lagbetween application</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1.000</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>and publication of search report</td><td>1.193**</td><td>1.200**</td><td>1.221 **</td><td>1.209*</td><td>(0.000533) 1.156</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Technological capabilities</td><td>(0.104)</td><td>(0.109)</td><td>(0.108)</td><td>(0.108)</td><td>(0.155)</td><td>1.133</td></tr><tr><td>High risk startup</td><td>0.420*</td><td>0.406*</td><td>0.400*</td><td>0.412*</td><td>0.925</td><td>(0.150) 0.996</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.200)</td><td>(0.195)</td><td>(0.191)</td><td>(0.199)</td><td>(0.531)</td><td>(0.569)</td></tr><tr><td>CEO industry experience</td><td>1.656*</td><td>1.817**</td><td>1.794**</td><td>1.805*</td><td>1.408</td><td>1.552</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.417)</td><td>(0.473)</td><td>(0.464)</td><td>(0.470)</td><td>(0.560)</td><td>(0.597)</td></tr><tr><td>Early stage financings</td><td>1.120*</td><td>1.097</td><td>1.096</td><td>1.096</td><td>1.084</td><td>1.092</td></tr><tr><td>(scaled by 1/100)</td><td>(0.062)</td><td>(0.063)</td><td>(0.062)</td><td>(0.062)</td><td>(0.085)</td><td>(0.085)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>3001</td><td>3001</td><td>3001</td><td>3001</td><td>1266</td><td>1266</td></tr><tr><td>Chi-squared</td><td></td><td>64.72</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Log likelihood</td><td>42.71</td><td></td><td>62.17</td><td>64.15</td><td>25.14</td><td>24.28</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: Standard errors in parentheses.

The variables capturing the anticipated information are neither individually nor jointly significant $\\'{C h i^{2}}=2.17$ $(\\mathrm{df}=2)$ $p{=}0.34^{\\cdot}$ ,while the two variables capturing the actual timing of information retain their significance $(\\mathrm{Chi}^{2}=13.13$ $(\\mathrm{df}=2)$ $p<0.01$ ).13 These results allow us to conclude that VCs rely on information as it is generated through the whole patenting process, as the actual information disclosure is more closely aligned with the VC financing events than the information structure constructed for our thought experiment. We readily admit that this is not a full substitute for an experimental design; nor does it rule out all possibilities of spurious effects. Nevertheless, this result clearly underlines the earlier insight that information generated during the patenting process is impacting VC financing and that this information is not anticipated fully at the time of patent filing.14  \n\nSome of the coefficients of our control variables in Table 3 are of interest in their own right.Since the results are fairly robust across specifications, we focus on the estimates in column (3). Companies with a larger set of technological capabilities receive VC financing faster. The variable high risk startup leads to a considerable reduction of the hazard of VC financing. Companies characterized by particularly high risks are less likely to be financed than other startups. The variable CEO industry experience suggests that companies founded by a CEO with industry experience access VC financing faster than companies whose CEOs had not gained industry experience before founding the company. Our control for the supply side conditions in the VC market, early stage financings, has the expected positive influence but is not statistically significant in all models. The sample companies receive VC financing faster if more companies are financed in a given year. The additional control variables for type of founding, founding period, therapeutics, and location in Germany are individually and jointly insignificant (e.g., for specification 1 in Table 3: $\\mathrm{Chi}^{2}=4.97\\$ $(\\mathrm{df}=7^{\\cdot}\\$ 一 $p=0.66$ 0.15  \n\n### 4.4.Robustness checks and auxiliary analyses  \n\nAs already noted,thepresence of unobserved heterogeneityin the technology of the startups can lead to a spurious correlation between patent information and the time to receiving VC financing. As an alternative to our ‘horse race' specification, we employed the method suggested by Abbring and van den Berg (2003), which was applied by Gans et al. (2008). To control for unobserved heterogeneity, we included the average time lag between the publication date of the search report and the application date as a regressor in the hazard function.16 A long time lag between the application and the publication of the search report prolongs the initial period of uncertainty. Our number of observations was reduced to 1,266 as wecould onlyinclude observationsforwhich thereis atleastone patent application with an associated search report in the current or preceding calendar quarters. Column (5) in Table 3 shows that the odds ratio of the variable average lag between application and publication of search report is close to one and insignificant, suggesting that unobserved heterogeneity is not a problem in this study. In addition, when we include the lag variable, we find that the size of the other hazard rates remains almost unchanged.Furthermore,the hazard rates of positive and negative news remain significant. For comparison, column (6) in Table 3 contains the specification with the restricted number of observations but without the lag-variable.  \n\nIn order to test the proportionality assumption implied by the Cox model, we included interactions of our time-varying covariates with time. We chose to use log (time), which is the most common functional form. No time interaction with a time-varying covariate shows up significantly in our models, which indicates that the proportionality assumption of the Cox model is not violated.  \n\nIn Table A1 in Appendix we further investigate the relative importance of early versus late applications and the speed with which VCs react to patent-related information. Column (1) shows a specification in which the logarithmic functional form for the application stock has been replaced with a linear functional form. The likelihood ratio test as quality indicator for the overall specification indicates a better fit for the logarithmic form. The $\\operatorname{Chi}^{2}$ (12df) test statistic is 42.71 for the logarithmic specification (see Table 3, column (1)) and only 42.36 for the linear specification. This suggests that additional applications tend to have a decreasing marginal influence. Thus, earlier patents are more relevant for the VC investment decision compared to later patents.  \n\nWe also investigate whether the influence of patent-related information decays over time. In column (2) we add a dummy variable that indicates whether an additional application was filed in the current quarter. A hazard ratio of larger than one for this variable indicates that current filings speed up the time to VC financing to a larger extent than implied alone by the application stock. In column (3) we include an additional dummy variable indicating not the current quarter but the quarter after the additional application has been filed. The variable is still significant but to a lower degree and with a smaller hazard ratio than the dummy with the current timing. Further, column (4) adds a dummy indicating two quarters after an additional application has been filed. The insignificance of this variable shows that VCs react quite fast upon new information from patent filings.  \n\n## 5. Interview evidence  \n\nWe conducted five in-depth interviews with vCs from Germany and the United Kingdom to complement our analysis in the ‘pin factory' tradition (Borenstein et al., 1998). We were interested in getting the views of different types of VCs and selected our interview partners accordingly. We interviewed investment managers of early stage VCs, late stage VCs and of a corporate VC. The aim of these interviews was to gain insights into the importance of patent information for the financing decision and detailed information on the patent due diligence. To that end, we constructed a guide that had open-ended questions. Typically, the interviews lastedfrom1to $1.5\\mathrm{h}$ and were transcribed.We also collected relevant documents from the VCs about the due diligence. Finally, the interviewer discussed her impressions with the VCs to ensure alignment between interviewer and interviewee.  \n\nThe first insight we gained from our interview partners is that both the protection and the information function of patents and the patent system are of great importance to VCs. One of the interviewees stressed that ‘patent applications signal that companies have done their homework'. We also learned from our interview partners thatcompaniesarewell awareof theimportanceVCs attach to patent applications and the importance of applying for a patent prior to entering negotiations with the Vc.  \n\nSecond, we were interested in learning from our interview partners whether patents are able to convey information at a relatively low cost. This potential advantage of patents has been mentioned in the literature (Long, 2002). Our interview partners suggested that patent documents offer information on the technology in a condensed and standardized format, which helps in the process of due diligence. Nevertheless, patent applications are often quite technical and formal and therefore difficult forVCs toread.To overcome this hurdle, VCs use highly specialized technical experts and patent lawyers to evaluate the patents. Consequently, patents may not reduce the costs of the due diligence process, but they provide precise information on the technology.  \n\nThird, our interviewees indicated that the VCs evaluate patents and related documents (e.g., search reports) very carefully, although the differences among VCs seem to be considerable. One of our interviewees gave us a list of 35 criteria on which hired technology experts in the field of biotechnology that the company focused on should base their evaluation of the patent portfolio. Another interviewee said that the respective company had no standardized patent due diligence. When we asked interviewees about the relevance of information contained in the search report, the responses were greatly heterogeneous.Whereas one VC appeared to be very interested in the information from the search report ‘to see what the examiner thinks, to learn who [else] is also working in this area and how the prior art limits the possibilities of the company under consideration', another VC of similar size and with similar investment focus rarely made use of search reports. The interviewed CVC investor pointed out that the final report of a technology expert hired to evaluate the patent portfolio of a company is explicitly asked to include all relevant prior art from the search report. When we asked about the importance of the grant decision, we learned that patent grants are preferred, but are not particularly important for the investment decision, since VCs ‘are able to decide whether there is something valuable based on the patent application document'. In addition, VCs highlighted that, particularly in biotechnology, the picture that emerges from evaluating the entire patent portfolio is relevant to the evaluation process, while the appraisal of a single patent is less meaningful. With regard topatent oppositions, our interviews revealed that an opposition informs the VC that a third party is interested in the technology, which signals commercial opportunity. The opposition positively influences the financing decision when the patent is perceived to be strong or if the company is able to make commercial use of the third party's interest, e.g., by licensing or selling the patent to the opposing party. The VC may abandon the investment opportunity if the commercial potential of the startup is severely endangered by the opposition.  \n\nTo sum up, the interview evidence shows that (1)entrepreneurs are aware of the positive signaling aspect of patent applications and (2) even though the further processing of information generated by the patenting process incurs certain costs, VCs do make use of this detailed information.  \n\n## 6. Implications and conclusion  \n\n### 6.1. Implications for research  \n\nOur paper seeks to make several contributions. First, we extend a growing body of literature on entrepreneurial resource allocation by showing that information generated in the patenting process facilitates access to external finance and thus helps companies to overcome the liabilities of newness. Moreover, while recent research has shown that investors pay attention to patent portfolios in their valuation decision (Hsu and Ziedonis, 2013; Mann and Sager, 2007), we show that information generated in the course of the patenting process affects the financing decision dynamically, even long before a first patent is granted.  \n\nSecond, the types and sources of information which we focus on in this paper (search reports, unexpected delays in communication by the patent office, opposition) have not been considered in prior literature. Our study demonstrates that the positive as well as negative news generated in the patenting process impact VC decision-making. Moreover, the patenting process also entails the discovery and dissemination of information generated by third parties (technology followers and competitors). This information should be especially valuable to resource providers such as investors, because it relates to the commercial potential as opposed to the technological relevance of inventions. Our investigation of the wide array of patent information does allow us to gain insights intohow information regarding the quality ofthe venture and information regarding the patent protection impact investor's decision making. While most types of patent information do not allow us to make this distinction, opposition information is a promising candidate to separate the two effects. An opposition provides negative information about patenting but positive information about the underlying value of a venture. By opposition exerting a large positive effect on investors financing decision, we conclude that the new information about the quality of the venture dominates the increasing uncertainty regarding patent protection.  \n\nThird, our results portray the patent office in a new role - rather than merely creating a time-limited exclusion right at some point, the patent office affects VC decision-making by providing - over an extended time period - information related to the quality of a company's patents. Very few studies highlight the patent office's role as information provider. Our interviews confirm that VCs invest in the exploitation of this information by trying to stay informed about available patent documents and by hiring external experts to evaluate the patent portfolios of potential investment targets in the light of information released by the patent office.  \n\nFinally, our results should give researchers reason to reconsider the welfare economics of the patent system. Patents are usually seen as a barrier to entry in a given sector. For instance, studies show that with increasing patenting, entry rates of startups in the software sector are reduced (Cockburn and MacGarvie, 2011). Furthermore, Cockburn and MacGarvie (2009) report that companies operating in markets with denser patent thickets experience a delay in receiving their first funding from external investors. Our results, however, suggest that the welfare impact of patenting is more complex: by facilitating the entry of VC-financed startups, patents also fulfill a pro-competitive role. This finding is in line with earlier studies providing support for the idea that patent protection under a strong appropriability regime allows new entrants to partner in the market for ideas and successfully profit from their invention (e.g., Teece, 1986; Gans et al., 2002; Hall and Ziedonis, 2001; Haeussler, 2011).  \n\n### 6.2. Practical implications  \n\nBesides extending the scientific literature, our results have practical implications for entrepreneurs, investors, and public policy. When entrepreneurs weigh the costs and benefits of applying for a patent, they consider various tradeoffs. For example, refining the application prior to filing may yield a broader patent scope and better protection, but delaying the filing may raise the danger of being pre-empted by rivals. We find that the mere existence of patent applications reduces the time to receiving VC financing, presumably because an application reflects progress in the development of a technology. However,in order to reduce the time to financing further it is also important that the application generates good news at and from the patent office. These dynamic aspects of information provision need to be taken into account in addition to the standard considerations of protection and reputation when drafting the patent and deciding about the fling strategy.  \n\nOur results also have implications for investors who can make use of patent-related information in order to learn about a startup's technology. VCs may improve their investment decisions by taking various forms of information generated in the course of the patenting process into account more systematically. Some VCs may profit from making further investments in their capability to analyze patent related information.  \n\nWith respect to public policy, we show that the current design of the EPO allows this patent office to generate information reflecting the quality of inventions and to trigger the provision of third-party information, e.g. via opposition. Good news from the patent system is associated with faster acquisition ofVC; the reverse applies in the case of bad news. Our findings lead to an important design question: how can the information-generating function of the patent system be supported and optimized? While we have shown that disclosure of patent information may facilitate the financing of ventures, further research may lead to improvements in the informational value of patent office information and disclosures.  \n\n### 6.3.Limitations and future research  \n\nVarious caveats need to be taken into account when consideringourresults,but thesemay alsobecomestartingpointsfor new studies.First, there is the question of external validity. This study investigated the importance ofinformation generated by the patent system for obtaining VC financing in biotechnology. As in other discrete technologies such as chemicals and pharmaceuticals (Cohen et al., 2o00), patent protection plays a very important role in this sector and is unusually strong when compared to mechanical or electrical engineering. Hence, our insights may not be applicable to other sectors. It must be left to future research to determine to what extent the patenting process generates useful information in thesesectors.  \n\nSecond, the patenting process at the EPO differs from the process at the USPTO. Historically, the EPO has generated more information because all patent applications have been published 18 months after priority - typically with a search report. References are qualified according to whether they are detrimental for patentability (X and Y references) and the opposition process provides early information regarding patent validity (Graham and Harhoff, 2009). Although the USPTO has recently adopted an 18-month publication regime, there are still differences in the content of information available to outside observers. A study comparing the impact of information generated through the patenting process at the USPTO and the EPO respectively could reveal interesting insights into institutional differences.  \n\nTableA1 Cox-hazard models - analysis of functional form and timing.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variable</td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">EPOapplicationstock</td><td>1.041**</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>(0.018)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">In EPO application stock</td><td></td><td>1.288</td><td>1.148</td><td>1.204</td></tr><tr><td>2.098*</td><td>(0.178)</td><td>(0.180)</td><td>(0.196)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Additionalapplicationinthecurrentquarter</td><td></td><td></td><td>2.126**</td><td>2.093**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.628)</td><td>(0.645)</td><td>(0.634)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Additional applicationin the current quarter(t+1)</td><td></td><td></td><td>1.799*</td><td>1.787</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(0.587)</td><td>(0.579) 0.623</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Additional applicationin the current quarter(t+2)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.313)</td></tr><tr><td>1.225**</td><td>1.199*</td><td>1.210**</td><td>1.202*</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Technological capabilities High riskstartup</td><td>(0.106)</td><td>(0.105)</td><td>(0.106)</td><td>(0.106)</td></tr><tr><td>0.375*</td><td>0.411*</td><td>0.410*</td><td>0.413*</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td>(0.177)</td><td>(0.195)</td><td>(0.195)</td><td>(0.197)</td></tr><tr><td>1.714**</td><td>1.702**</td><td>1.688**</td><td>1.677**</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">CEOindustryexperience</td><td>(0.429)</td><td>(0.429)</td><td>(0.426)</td><td>(0.424)</td></tr><tr><td>1.118**</td><td>1.118*</td><td>1.116*</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Earlystagefinancings (scaled by1/100)</td><td>(0.062)</td><td>(0.0615)</td><td>(0.0613)</td><td>1.118*</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>3001</td><td>3001</td><td></td><td>(0.0616)</td></tr><tr><td>Observations Chi-squared</td><td>42.36</td><td>48.30</td><td>3001</td><td>3001</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-402.5</td><td></td><td>51.34</td><td>52.32</td></tr><tr><td>log likelihood</td><td></td><td>-399.5</td><td>-398.0</td><td>-397.5</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote:Standard errors inarenthesesHazard ratis shown 9fm exits frm thrisk et.ll spcifcations contain dummiesforpi-out science, sin-out comany therapeutics, founded $^{\\ '}90-^{\\ '}95$ founded $96-99$ founded $ '_{03-}'_{05}$ German company. : Significant at $10\\%$ \"\\* ignificant at $5\\%$ \\*\\* Signficant at $1\\%$  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nAnearlierversion of this paperwascirculated underthe title“To Be Financed or Not ...

The criteria venture capitalists use to make their venture investment decisions are of interestforseveral reasons.First,venture capitalists areconspicuously successful intheirinvestment decisions.The success rateofventurecapital-backedventuresissignificantlyhigherthanthe success rate of new ventures generally (Dorsey 1979: Davis and Stetson  \n\n1984). A better understanding of the criteria used could lead to a better understanding of the reasons forthissuccess.  \n\nSecond,abetterunderstandingofthecriteriaforsuccessfulnewventurescouldleadtoan improvement in the success rate of new ventures.Although there is no clear agreement on the precise rate, the failure rate among new ventures is generally viewed as significantly higher than the average failure rate (Dun and Bradstreet 1984; Van deVen 1980:Shapero 1981).  \n\nFinally,venture capitalists' investment criteria are of enormous import to entrepreneurs seeking venture funding. Such entrepreneurs require a significant infusion of capital in order to grow their businesses, and knowledge of the criteria sought by venture capitalists can aid entrepreneurs in gaining thenecessaryfinancing.  \n\nThis study attempts to uncover the criteria used by venuure capitalists through semistructured interviews and verbal protocol analysis of venture capitalists' evaluations of actual venture proposals. Sixteen verba' protocols--in which the participants“think aloud\"as they review business proposals-- weremadeofventurecapitalists'ventureevaluationdecisions.  \n\nThe findings of this study suggest that venture capitalists screen and assess business proposals very rapidly: the subjects in this study reached a GOINO-GO decision in an average of less than six minutes on initial screening and less than 21 minutes on proposal assessment. In venture capitalists' initial proposal screening, key criteria identifed include fit with the venture firm's lending guidelines and the long-term growth and profitability of the industry in which the proposed business will operate. In the second stage of proposal assessment, the source of the business proposal also played a major role in the venture capitalists’ interest in the plan, with proposals previously reviewed by persons known and trusted by the venture capitalist receiving a high level of interest.  \n\nIn addition to the specific criteria identified and how they were used in reaching GO/NO-GO decisions, the findings of this study also were surprising for the lack of importance venture capitalists attached to the entrepreneurlentrepreneurial team and the strategy of the proposed venture during these early stages of theventure evaluation process.  \n\n### INTRODUCTION  \n\nThis article reports the findings of an exploratory research project on venture capitalist decision-making. The objectives of the entire project are (1) to refine the stages of venture capitalists' venture evaluation decision processes; and (2) to identify the criteria used in each of these processes. This article discusses the findings to date on venture capitalists’ decision criteria used in the initial stages of the decision process (i.e., proposal screening and proposal evaluation).  \n\nVenture capitalists’ are conspicuously successful at selecting new ventures (Dorsey 1979; Bruno and Tyebjee 1983; Davis and Stetson 1984) and researchers credit much of this success to the criteria they use in assessing proposed new ventures. It is not surprising, then, that most of the research on venture capitalist decision-making has focused on identifying their venture evaluation criteria (Wells 1974; Poindexter 1976; Tyebjee and Bruno 1984; MacMillan et al 1985, 1987). Criteria identified in these studies are summarized in Table1.  \n\nOne interesting aspect common to these studies is that several of the key characteristics identified were consistent across various studies, and the criteria identified can be grouped into six distinct categories. As shown in Table 1, the preponderance of criteria identified to date are related to the characteristics of the entrepreneur or entrepreneurial team and to the requirements of the venture firm.  \n\nThere are, however, two key weaknesses common to these studies. First, all are open to errors and biases as a result of self-reporting of data. As MacMillan et al. (1985) note: \"It is possible that respondents could be influenced by their perception of what is a desirable response or a response that is seen as appropriate to their position as representatives of the venture capital community. There is also a danger that some respondents may not use the criteria in the ways that they think they do' (p. 122).  \n\nSecond, each of these studies has examined the key characteristics sought by venture capitalists using ex post facto data-gathering techniques. As a consequence, the results could be biased by inaccuracies in the recall ability of the venture capitalists, especially in trying to differentiate between the criteria that led to success vis-a-vis those that led to failure. The criteria depicted in Table 1 provide a critical insight to this research. Because most studies did not specify the stage of the decision process that was studied, it is likely that the criteria identified came from different stages of venture capitalists’ venture evaluation process. To the extent that this is true, it means that the criteria identified in these studies cannot be compared directly with one another, as the authors of some of these studies have tried to do, until they can be placed in the context in which they occurred. While it appears that these contexts may be similar, insufficient data were presented to be certain of this.  \n\nTo date only three researchers have studied venture capitalists' decision-making from a process perspective (Table 2).  \n\nTABLE 1 Findings on Venture Capitalists’ Investment Criteria   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Tyebjee&</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Wells (1974)</td><td>Poindexter (1976)</td><td>Bruno (1984)</td><td>MacMillan et al.

These were (1) the search for investment opportunities, which involved contacting other intermediaries (e.g., banks, other venture capital firms); (2) the screening of proposals, in which several standardized questions were asked; and (3) the evaluation of proposals, in which the proposed business deal was investigated “\"as completely as possible\" (p. 187). Once these evaluations were completed, the new businesses were either funded or rejected, after which the venture capitalist spent significant amounts of time with the new firms (4)  \n\nTABLE 2 Stages of Venture Capitalists’ Management Process   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Wells (1974)</td><td>Tyebjee & Bruno (1984)</td><td>Silver (1985) Hall (1989)</td></tr><tr><td>Search</td><td>Deal origination Search</td><td>Generating a deal flow</td></tr><tr><td>2 Screening</td><td>Screening</td><td>Initial screen Proposal screening</td></tr><tr><td>3 X</td><td>X X</td><td>Proposal assessment</td></tr><tr><td>4 Evaluation</td><td>Evaluation X</td><td>Project evaluation</td></tr><tr><td>5 X</td><td>X</td><td>Due diligence Due diligence</td></tr><tr><td>6 X</td><td>Deal structuring</td><td>Deal structuring Deal structuring</td></tr><tr><td>7 (a)Venture board meet-</td><td>Postinvestment activities</td><td>Monitorprogress Venture operations</td></tr><tr><td>ings (b) venture</td><td>X</td><td>X X</td></tr><tr><td>operations</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nLines are used to separate different stages in venture capitalists' venture management process.  \n\nin venture board meetings and follow-up; (5) in dealing with venture operations; and ultimatcly (6) in cashing out of the ventures.  \n\nWells found that different criteria were applied at the screening and evaluation phases, moving from broad questions at the screening stage to specific ones during evaluation.  \n\nIn their 1984 study, Tyebjee and Bruno went beyond the identification of venture evaluation criteria by developing a five-stage model of venture capital investment activity. The five stages they identified were: (1) deal originating, or the search for prospective investments; (2) screening, in which most proposals are rejected based on the venture capital firm's investment criteria; (3) evaluation, during which the proposed venture is examined in detail; (4) deal structuring, during which the venture capitalist and the entrepreneur agree to specific financial arrangements; and (5) postinvestment activities, which encompasses the venture capitalist's involvement in the management of the new venture. Basically, Tyebjee and Bruno's framework condensed the fourth and fifth stages of Well's framework into a single stage, added a new stage called deal structuring, and dropped the cashing out stage.  \n\nIn 1985, A. David Silver, an experienced venture capitalist, described the venture evaluation process in very similar terms. According to Silver, the process consisted of six stages, the first of which was generating a deal fow, with the best deals coming from previously backed entrepreneurs and other venture capitalists. Next came an initial screen in which most proposals were rejected. This was followed by the due diligence process, which Silver described as a series of five audits: the size of the problem the business is attempting to solve, the elegance of the solution, the entrepreneurial team, the financial statement, and legal aspects. The fourth phase involved the structuring of the terms and conditions for funding of the venture. Once the agreement to finance the venture had been made, the venture capitalist then monitored the progress of the new investment and attempted to add value to the business. In the final phase, the venture capital firm's involvement in the new business ended when it sold or liquified its investment.  \n\nBasically, Silver's model followed Tyebjee and Bruno's (1984) except in the term used for the pre-cash stage.  \n\nAs part of his 1989 study, Hall interviewed venture capitalists to identify the stages in their decision-making process. He identified eight stages: work aimed at generating a deal fow was followed by brief proposal screening. Proposals that successfully passed this stage were then assessed in more detail. The fourth step involved project evaluation, during which the venture capitalist(s) actually toured the business and/or met with the entrepreneurial team. Ventures in which the venture capitalist(s) was still interested were then subjected to due diligence. Once the agreement to make a deal was made in principle, a deal structuring meeting was conducted, and venture operations begun. The final stage occurred if and when the venture capital firm cashed out of the venture.  \n\nAs shown in Table 2, perhaps the most significant facts revealed by this review are that all of the researchers who studied venture capitalists’ decision-making agreed (1) that it consisted of muitiple stages; and (2) that the venture evaluation itself involved at least two distinct stages: (a) screening, and (b) evaluation. The latter point is especially important because, as noted above, of all the researchers who studied the criteria used by venture capitalists to evaluate new venture proposals, only Wells (1974) differentiated between these different stages in his research. This means not only that it is highly probable that different criteria are used in different stages but also that any new research of venture capitalist decision-making must use methodologies that can and will capture any possible differences among stages. It also means that the findings reported to date have probably “\"mixed\" different stage criteria and possibly even generated some spurious results.  \n\nBecause the criteria used by venture capitalists at each stage of the decision process has been the focus of few studies, this exploratory study sought to identify the specific criteria examined by venture capitalists during the early stages of their evaluation (i.e., the initial screening and assessment of venture funding proposal requests).  \n\n### METHODS  \n\nFirst, semistructured interviews on the decision process and criteria were conducted at four venture capital firms. These venture capitalists then provided the protocols for this study. While confidentiality was guaranteed in order to gain the cooperation of the venture capitalists, general information about the firms is provided in Table 3. The protocols were taped on an audio tape recorder and verbatim transcriptions were made of the tapes. A total of 16 protocols were collected. Ten of the protocols involved proposal screenings; the remaining six were proposal assessments. As shown in Table 4, the 16 protocols covered a wide range of businesses, including both high-technology and service ventures, and including requests for start-up, second stage, and leverage buy-out funding.  \n\nThe number of protocols was limited both by accessibility and the large volume of data provided by the protocols. A major limitation of verbal protocol analysis is that the volume of data collected necessitates a small sample size. Isenberg (1986) notes that the sample sizes in studies using this methodology have typically ranged from three to 15. Thus, this project, using 16 verbal protocols, is not only within an acceptable range in terms of number of protocols, but is at the upper limit of that range.  \n\n## Methodology  \n\nThe primary methodology used to identify these criteria was verbal protocol analysis as the venture capitalists reviewed actual business proposals they had received. Verbal protocols involve the participant “\"thinking aloud\"’ as he or she performs a particular task (Ericsson and Simon 1984). Verbal protocols have been used extensively in studying a variety of situations involving problem-solving and decision-making, such as job choice (Soelberg 1965), strategic decision-making (Schweiger 1980), consumer choice (Bettman 1974), and the design of management information systems (Vitalari 1980).  \n\nTABLE 3  Profiles of the Venture Capital Firms Studied   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Firm A</td><td>Firm B</td><td>Firm C</td><td>Firm D</td></tr><tr><td>Location</td><td>Midwest U.S.</td><td>Southeast U.S.</td><td>Southeast U.S. 3</td><td>West Coast U.S. 8</td></tr><tr><td>Number of partners Experience of partner</td><td>1 VC 14 years;</td><td>2 VC 8 years;</td><td>VC and Firm C</td><td>VC 20 yrs;</td></tr><tr><td>interviewed Portfolio size (approximate)</td><td>Firm A 8 years Size undisclosed</td><td>Firm B 3 years $20 million</td><td>Firm C 3 years Size undisclosed</td><td>Firm D 3 years $200 million</td></tr><tr><td>Number of ventures invested</td><td></td><td></td><td>but under $20</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>(1987) Typical deal size</td><td>3 $175,000--$1</td><td>6 $800,000-$1</td><td>4 $250,000-$1</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>million</td><td>million</td><td>million</td><td>$1-1.25 million</td></tr><tr><td>Geographic specialization Financing stages</td><td>Midwest U.S. Seed & 2nd</td><td>Southeast U.S. 2nd Stage</td><td>Southeast U.S. 2nd Stage</td><td>Primarily West Coast Seed, 2nd Stage,&</td></tr><tr><td>Industry specialization</td><td>Stage Health care & office</td><td>None</td><td>High tech, 30%; real</td><td>LBOs Avoid oil, gas & real estate</td></tr><tr><td>Total time frame for investment decision</td><td>equipment 1-6 months</td><td>2 weeks-4</td><td>estate,70% 6 months</td><td>2 weeks-6 months</td></tr><tr><td>Number of proposals received</td><td>100-150</td><td>months 580</td><td>350</td><td>500-600</td></tr><tr><td>in 1987 (approximate) Souce of proposals</td><td>100% referred</td><td>50% referred;</td><td>Majority cold</td><td>Majority cold</td></tr><tr><td>Searchforinvestments</td><td>None</td><td>50% cold Informal calls uo accounting& law firms,</td><td>None</td><td>Active; seeks and maintains contacts with current</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nIn any methodology involving self-reporting, the validity of the responses is a concern. Ericsson and Simon (1984) outline eight conditions under which verbal reports will be most accurate: (1) the information reported is the focus of attention; (2) the task is not highly routinized; (3) a short time elapses between task and recording; (4) verbalization does not require excessive encoding; (5) the reports are oral; (6) subjects are free of distractions; (7) the questions and instructions on how to verbalize are clear and specific; and (8) the reports are as complete as possible. All eight conditions were met in this research.  \n\n### Procedures  \n\nThe subjects were told that they were going to analyze some of the business plans they had recently received but not yet read. They were asked to read the business plan the way they would normally read it, but to verbalize their thoughts as they reviewed the plan. They were free to make notes or use a calculator if they so wished. They were instructed to verbalize their thoughts constantly, even though they were reading the proposals. In order to provide participants with clear, specific instructions on protocols, Ericsson and Simon (1984) recommend walking through a practice protocol and then discussing with the participant what they were thinking about as they answered the practice question. In this study, the researcher demonstrated the think-aloud procedure by asking the venture capitalists, \"How many windows do you have in your house?\" and \"What did you think about as you tried to answer that question?\"  \n\nTABLE 4  The Proposals Reviewed   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Nature of the Business</td><td>Financing Stage</td><td>Review Time</td><td>Disposition & Reasons For It</td></tr><tr><td>Protocol 1</td><td>Mfr.& dist.of electronics product</td><td>Start-up</td><td>1 min 20 sec</td><td>Rejected: (1) start-up; (2) product difficult to sell</td></tr><tr><td>Protocol 2</td><td>for industry Computer software</td><td>2nd</td><td>1 min 32 sec</td><td>Rejected: not a long-term</td></tr><tr><td>Protocol 3</td><td>Specialty building material</td><td>Start-up</td><td>1 min 54 sec</td><td>opportunity Rejected: low margin business</td></tr><tr><td>Protocol 4</td><td>Mfr.&dist.of consumer audio</td><td>Start-up</td><td>2 min 45 sec</td><td>Rejected: no financial information</td></tr><tr><td>Protocol 5</td><td>equipment Mfr.of military</td><td>Start-up</td><td>2 min 50 sec</td><td>Rejected:venture firm does not</td></tr><tr><td>Protocol 6</td><td>equipment Ali terrain vehicle</td><td>2nd</td><td>10 min 16 sec</td><td>fund companies in this industry Rejected: disagreed with plan to</td></tr><tr><td>Protocol 7</td><td>Mfr.& dist.of a specialty sporting goods product</td><td>Start-up</td><td>6 min 29 sec</td><td>distribute product Rejected: (1) consumer product, not proprietary; (2) no</td></tr><tr><td>Protocol 8</td><td>Chemical dependency</td><td>2nd</td><td>6 min 38 sec</td><td>management team; (3) organization of company; (4) unrealistic numbers Probable turndown, but was to</td></tr><tr><td>Protocol 9</td><td>programs Amusement operations</td><td></td><td></td><td>phone someone on board for additional information</td></tr><tr><td>Protocol 10</td><td>Computer software</td><td>2nd 2nd</td><td>6 min 34 sec 16 min 19 sec</td><td>Rejected: no financial information Follow up meeting with</td></tr><tr><td>Protocol 11</td><td>systems Consumer product</td><td>2nd</td><td>14 min 21 sec</td><td>management team Rejected: narrow interest product;</td></tr><tr><td>Protocol 12</td><td>Communities for senior</td><td>2nd</td><td>20 min 43 sec</td><td>questions on use of funds Rejected:venture firm does not</td></tr><tr><td>Protocol 13</td><td>citizens Computer-aided</td><td>2nd</td><td>18 min 43 sec</td><td>fund real estate projects Follow up meeting with</td></tr><tr><td>Protocol 14</td><td>publishing Winery</td><td>LBO</td><td>10 min 17 sec</td><td>management team Set aside to see if winery</td></tr><tr><td>Protocol 15</td><td>Electronic publishing</td><td></td><td></td><td>management follows up</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>2nd</td><td>35 min 27 sec</td><td>Defer decision until company grows</td></tr><tr><td>Protocol 16</td><td>Product for computer</td><td>2nd</td><td>23 min 7 sec</td><td>Get people from funded company in same industry to examine plan, talk with management</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nAfter each protocol, the venture capitalist was debriefed with an unstructured interview on the reasons for some of the comments and decisions.  \n\n### Data Analysis  \n\nThe verbatim transcriptions of the protocols were coded into thought segments, which were then analyzed in detail. Thought segments are clauses, sentences, and phrases that are independent units (Ericsson and Simon 1984). Thought segments in the verbal protocols are identified most frequently through pauses in speech. For coding purposes, each thought segment should be understandable when taken out of context. Thought segments were numbered sequentially in each protocol. A typical thought segment coding (from Protocol 7) isshownbelow:  \n\n1 2 [Picks up. scans proposal] / Alright, this is [Company 7]./ 3 I don't know where this one came from, [Manager 7],/ 4 this one is, this one just came cold in the mail./ 5 6 Uh,/ executive summary, oral prospectus./ Speciality 7 8 sporting goods manufacturing and marketing./ Doesn't sound 9 10 very tangible./ Technology is proprietary./ Question-- how can, how can there be technology in sporting goods 11 12 manufacturing?/ Well, let me see./ Patent's pending,/ not 13 very many venture-backed companies have been successful because of patents although that's electronics./ Company 14 may be considered somewhere between seed and start-up./ 15 16 Prototype of main product./ Four functional preproduction 17 18 prototypes./ Okay,/ let's look at the executive summary./  \n\nUsing the definition of thought segments as a guide, an independent judge (a Ph.D. student who had field experience with qualitative methods) coded a random sample of $25\\%$ of the verbal protocols. The percentage of agreement (POA) between the researcher and the judge was .907. Gellert (1955) notes that POA reliability below .70 is considered poor and above .85 is “very satisfactory.\"  \n\nThe thought segments in each protocol were then classified by the criteria in the business proposal the venture capitalist was examining. The initial coding scheme utilized criteria developed from literature on venture capitalists' venture evaluation criteria as described in Table 1. After coding two protocols using these criteria, it was decided to revise the coding scheme using two additional categories: (7) financial information on the proposed business, and (8) actions and pauses. While statements on financial information could have legitimately been coded under nature of the proposed business, a large number of comments were made in the protocols that related strictly to financial information. It was decided therefore, that the addition of a category to capture just the financial information might shed some additional insight on the venture evaluation process, particularly as venture capitalists seemed to focus on this information as a separate aspect of the business. The actions category was added to permit coding of the natural pauses that occur in speech, as well as to indicate physical actions.  \n\nAfter coding all 1,939 thought segments into one (and only one) of these eight categories, each thought segment was then further classified according to the nature of the statement involved in order to examine the thought segments in finer detail.  \n\nMany of the thought segments were direct quotes from the business plans. However, based on reviews of the protocols, the researchers believed that some of the more interesting thought segments were questions, opinions, and decision statements made by the venture capitalists. Based on the data, five types of statements were proposed for such classification: (1) actions (A) and verbal pauses (VP); (2) descriptive statements (DS); (3) questions (Q); (4) opinions (O); and (5) decisions (D). This coding scheme proved to be both exclusive and exhaustivefor all protocols.  \n\nUsing these criteria, a random sample of $20.6\\%$ of all thought segments were coded by both the researcher and two independent judges. Both of the judges were doctoral students in strategic management who had completed course work and field work in qualitative methods. The levels of agreement were measured using both POA and Cohen's (1960) K (k). The median interrater scores were (1) criteria categories k, .778, POA, .820, (2) statement categories k, .842, POA, .885. After subsequent discussion among the raters, the major disagreements were resolved by sharpening the coding definitions. The median revised POAs were (1) .970 for the criteria categories, and (2) .980 for the statement categories.  \n\nThe coded protocols were presented in transition matrices, in which the thought segments in each protocol are numbered sequentially and the criteria and statement category codings are displayed such that the patterns of thought are shown.

As shown in Tables 5 and 6, all seven of the criteria were touched on in the protocols. However, not all criteria were assessed in each proposal. Rather, the process proceeded until the venture capitalists identified a reason to reject the proposal or completed that stage of review without discovering a \"fatal flaw.\"  \n\nWhile the criteria examined in each protocol are interesting, the specific criteria cited in the protocols as the reasons for the venture capitalists’ decisions were examined most closely. The reasons for the decisions were deduced by examining the pattern of comments surrounding the decision in each protocol and through debriefing interviews with the venture capitalists.  \n\n### REASONS FOR PROPOSAL SCREENING DECISIONS  \n\nOf the 10 proposal screening protocols, eight were rejected, one was a likely rejection, and one was moved to the next stage in the decision process. Table 7 outlines the major criteria noted in the proposal screening protocols.  \n\nProtocols I and 5 were rejected due to the lending policies at the venture capital firm. Venture Capitalist B had defined the preferred financing as second stage, and the proposed company in Protocol 1 was seeking start-up money. In Protocol 5, Venture Capitalist C clearly stated that he did not invest in defense companies. Rejection due to the lending guidelines of the venture firm is not surprising, as all 10 proposal screening protocols were sent to the venture capital firms without referral. One can assume that these 10 proposals were mailed to a number of venture capital firms, and detailed information on the kinds of investments a venture firm makes is difficult (and sometimes impossible) to get without some personal interaction with or introduction to the firm.  \n\nThe stated reason the venture capitalists rejected Protocols 4 and 9 was the lack of financial information in the proposals. Based on the lack of a full proposal ( and the inclusion of two “extremely thick\" curriculum vitae) in Protocol 4, Venture Capitalist C inferred that the entrepreneurs were \"mad scientists.\" At the end of his brief (2 minutes 45 seconds) review, Venture Capitalist C commented that he could not understand the nature of the product from the executive summary. Also, there is some question as to whether or not, Venture Capitalist D ever seriously considered following up on Protocol 9; essentially, he found the product/service interesting from a personal but not a business perspective. Given the comments on financial information in the 10 protocols, it is likely that a financial section with realistic projections is necessary in a business proposal—-even though the venture capitalists do not put much faith in the numbers. Rather, the absence of financial information raises questions about the seriousness of the request for funds and the business capabilities of the entrepreneur.  \n\nProtocol 6 was rejected due to the manner in which the firm proposed to develop and distribute its product. What is interesting about this protocol is that Venture Capitalist C appeared to have some interest in the product and could have requested more information or inquired whether the entrepreneurs would be interested in changing their distribution plans. There are two plausible explanations why Venture Capitalist C did not request more information: (1) there was some other factor in the proposal that caused rejection; or (2) there was not sufficient interest in the proposal to overcome objections to the existing plans. Throughout the protocol, Venture Capitalist C indicated a favorable attitude toward the product and the market. Therefore, explanation 2 appears to be the more reasonable one.  \n\nTABLE 5 Thought Segments for All Proposal Screening Protocols?   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"9\">Thought Segments--Frequencies</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Action</td><td>VC Firm</td><td>Proposal</td><td>Ent.</td><td>Bus.</td><td>Fin.</td><td>Env.</td><td>Strat.</td><td>TOT.</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>24</td><td></td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td><td>一</td><td></td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>VP</td><td>80</td><td></td><td>一</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>DS</td><td>4</td><td>30</td><td>90</td><td>51</td><td>118</td><td>33</td><td>23</td><td>2</td><td>351</td></tr><tr><td>Q</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td></td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td></td><td>7</td><td>20</td><td>23</td><td>19</td><td>10</td><td>9</td><td>6</td><td>94</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td></td><td>18</td><td>6</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>一</td><td></td><td></td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>TOT</td><td>109</td><td>59</td><td>120</td><td>83</td><td>146</td><td>48</td><td>36</td><td>8</td><td>609</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Action</td><td>VC Firm</td><td>Proposal</td><td>Ent.</td><td>Bus.</td><td>Fin.</td><td>Env.</td><td></td><td>'TOT.</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>3.9</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Strat.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VP</td><td>13.1</td><td></td><td>.2</td><td></td><td></td><td>—</td><td></td><td>1</td><td>4.1</td></tr><tr><td>DS</td><td>.7</td><td>4.9</td><td>14.8</td><td>8.4</td><td>19.4</td><td></td><td>3.8</td><td></td><td>13.1 57.7</td></tr><tr><td>Q</td><td>.2</td><td>.7</td><td>.5</td><td>1.1</td><td>1.1</td><td>5.4 .8</td><td>.7</td><td>.3</td><td>5.1</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td></td><td>1.1</td><td>3.3</td><td>3.8</td><td>3.1</td><td>1.6</td><td>1.5</td><td>1.0</td><td>15.4</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td></td><td>3.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>.3</td><td>.3</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>4.6</td></tr><tr><td>TOT</td><td>17.9</td><td>9.7</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>6.0</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n\"MeanElapsedTime $\\approx5$ minutes 40.7 seconds. Median Elapsed Time $\\approx$ 4 minutes 39.5 seconds.  \n\nThe proposals presented in Protocols 2, 3, and 7 were rejected, and Protocol 8 conditionally rejected, due to a combination of the nature of the products/services and the industries in which the businesses proposed to enter. In all four cases, the venture capitalists were familiar with the nature of the businesses and industries because they had previously reviewed proposals for such businesses. While the specific reasons for rejection varied, the key to the venture capitalists′ thinking appears to follow intuitive logic: I have rejected other proposals in this business/industry; there is nothing in this proposal to indicate it is different from or better than previously reviewed proposals in this business/industry; therefore, this proposal should be rejected. The effect of this is to screen quickly (and reject) a large number ofproposals.  \n\nProtocol 10 was the only one of the 10 screening protocols to move to the next stage of the venture capitalist's decision process. It also was the longest of the 10 protocols in terms of review time (16 minutes 19 seconds versus a mean of 5 minutes 40.7 seconds), and these two factors are probably related: venture capitalists spend relatively more time on a proposal that interests them as an investment. There were four factors that favorably impressed Venture Capitalist D about the proposal. These were (in the order in which they were mentioned in the protocol) (1) the company was located in Venture Firm D's geographic area of interest; (2) the industry was viewed as \"a real market\"; (3) Venture Firm D had seriously investigated a business in this industry in the past; and (4) the company involved had been a profitable small business for 19 years. Factor 3-—-prior investigation by the venture capital firm—appeared to be the most important of these factors. This decision process is the fip side of the decisions to not pursue Protocols 2, 3, 7, and 8; while those protocols were rejected because similar proposais had been rejected, Protocol 10 was accepted at this stage because a similar proposal had been accepted in the past. The effect is the same in all five cases: it reduces the amount of time spent screening a large number of proposals.  \n\nTABLE 6  Thought Segments for All Proposal Assessment Protocols\"   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"11\">Thought Segments——Frequencies</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Action</td><td>VC Firm</td><td>Proposa!</td><td>Ent.</td><td>Bus.</td><td>Fin.</td><td>Env.</td><td>Strat.</td><td>TOT.</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>45</td><td></td><td>1</td><td></td><td>-—</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td>VP</td><td>161</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>162</td></tr><tr><td>DS</td><td>13</td><td>58</td><td>213</td><td>100</td><td>171</td><td>102</td><td>76</td><td>32</td><td>764</td></tr><tr><td>Q</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>21</td><td>13</td><td>17</td><td>10</td><td>86</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>13</td><td>75</td><td>19</td><td>59</td><td>37</td><td>11</td><td>7</td><td>226</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>2</td><td>32</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td></td><td>一</td><td>3</td><td>一</td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td>TOT</td><td>227</td><td>108</td><td>302</td><td>135</td><td>251</td><td>152</td><td>107</td><td>48</td><td>1330</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Action</td><td>VC Firm</td><td>Proposal</td><td>Thought Segments--Proportions</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Ent.</td><td>Bus.</td><td>Fin.</td><td>Env.</td><td>Strat.</td><td>TOT.</td></tr><tr><td>VP</td><td>3.4 12.1</td><td>一 .1</td><td>.1</td><td></td><td>一</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>3.5</td></tr><tr><td>DS</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>12.2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1.0</td><td>4.4 .3</td><td>16.0 .7</td><td>7.5</td><td>12.9</td><td>7.7</td><td>5.7</td><td>2.3</td><td>57.5</td></tr><tr><td>Q 0</td><td>.1 .4</td><td>1.0</td><td>5.6</td><td>.7</td><td>1.6</td><td>1.0</td><td>1.3</td><td>.7</td><td>6.4</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>.1</td><td>2.4</td><td>.2</td><td>1.4 .5</td><td>4.4</td><td>2.8</td><td>.8 .2</td><td>.5</td><td>16.9</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>一</td><td></td><td></td><td>3.4</td></tr><tr><td>TOT</td><td>17.1</td><td>8.2</td><td>22.6</td><td>10.1</td><td>18.9</td><td>11.5</td><td>8.0</td><td>3.5</td><td>99.9</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n“Mean Elapsed Time $=~20$ minutes 26.33 seconds.

Throughout Protocol 11, Venture Capitalist C commented on the nature of the product and business, specifically that it was a consumer product with what he believed was a very narrow segment of the market. One question raised on this proposal is why the venture capitalist invested the time to review it in depth (i.e., why wasn't it screened out?). A clue to the answer to this question came early in the protocol, in which Venture Capitalist C noted that he had screened the proposal when it came in because the proposal came with a sample of the product attached.  \n\nTABLE 7   Criteria Evaluated in Proposal Screening and Proposal Assessment   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Proposal Screening</td><td>Proposal Assessmel</td></tr><tr><td>Venturecapitalfirmrequirements Must fit within lending guidelines of venture</td><td>Protocols 1, 5</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>firm for stage and size of investment and kind of industries invested in or reject</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Proposed business must be within geographic area of interest</td><td>Protocol 10</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Prefer proposals recommended by someone known to venrure capitalist</td><td>Protocols 7, 8, 10</td><td>Protocols 12, 13,14,1</td></tr><tr><td>Proposed industry must be kind of industry invested inbyventure firm orreject</td><td></td><td>Protocol 12</td></tr><tr><td>Characteristics of theproposal Must havefull information orreject</td><td>Protocols 4, 8, 9</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Should be a reasonable length,easy to scan, have an executive summary, and professionally presented</td><td>Protocols 4, 6, 7, 10</td><td>Protocols 12, 14, 16</td></tr><tr><td>Proposal must contain a balanced presentation or reject</td><td></td><td>Protocols 11, 14</td></tr><tr><td>Use graphics, large print to emphasize key</td><td></td><td>Protocols 12, 15</td></tr><tr><td>points</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Characteristicsoftheentrepreneur/team Relevant experience or reject</td><td></td><td>Protocols 12, 13, 14</td></tr><tr><td>Should have abalancedmanagement team in</td><td>Protocols 7, 8, 9 Protocols 4, 7, 8</td><td>Protocol 16</td></tr><tr><td>place Management must be willing to work with</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>venture partrers Entrepreneur who has successfully started</td><td>Protocol 10</td><td>Protocol 12</td></tr><tr><td>previous business given special considerationt</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Nature oftheproposedbusiness Projected growth should be relatively large withinfiveyearsofinvestment</td><td>Protocol 8</td><td>Protocol 11</td></tr><tr><td>Economicenvironmentofproposedindustry Industry must be capable of long-term growth</td><td>Protocols 2,3, 8</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>and profitability Economicenvironmentshouldbefavorableto a new entrant</td><td></td><td>Protocols 12, 13, 16</td></tr><tr><td>Strategyof theproposedbusiness</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Selection of distribution channel(s) must be feasible or reject</td><td>Protocol 6</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Productmust demonstrate defendable competitive position</td><td></td><td>Protocols 13, 15</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Financialinformationontheproposedbusiness</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Financial projections should be realistic</td><td>Protocol 7</td><td>Protocol 12</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nVenture Capitalist D rejected Protocol 12 because, although the proposal claimed the business was in the health care industry, Venture Capitalist D perceived it to be in the real estate business, and Venture Firm D did not invest in real estate projects. This proposal was assessed (rather than screened out) because it came recommended by an investment banker Venture Capitalist D had dealt with on the phone. Because the proposal was for a real estate project, Venture Capitalist D revised his opinion (downward) of the investment banker.  \n\nDecisions on Protocols 14 and 15 were deferred indefinitely. Protocol 14 appealed to Venture Capitalist D in terms of the industry (a winery), the management team (three of the four top managers had extensive experience in wineries), the state of funding (leveraged buyout), and the concept the business had developed of using the plant and equipment to produce both wine and other alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. However, the proposal itself was written in what Venture Capitalist D viewed as a disjointed manner; he inferred from this that the principals did not yet have a deal on the leveraged buy-out of the winery. Venture Capitalist D decided to set the proposal aside to see if the management team followed up.  \n\nIn Protocol 15, the reason for Venture Capitalist D's decision to wait for the company to grow more before investigating it further was clearly linked to what he viewed as a lack of clearly defined strategy. In this case, Venture Capitalist D had screened an earlier version of the proposal and visited with people at the company. Indeed, this may be the reason that Protocol 15 was the only one of the six proposal assessments in which strategy played a major role in the decision: it was the only one in which the venture capitalist had invested significant amounts of time in investigating. Because he was further along in his investigation than the venture capitalists were on the remaining protocols, a defensible strategy may have been the last major prerequisite prior to moving forward in the decision process.  \n\nProtocols 13 and 16 were moved to the next stage in the decision process. Venture Capitalist D was predisposed toward Protocol 13 because it had been screened and recommended to him by one of his partners. However, the major turning point in the decision to proceed came when Venture Capitalist D recognized the company's president as someone who had successfully started a company in a similar business and who had worked with venture capitalists before. This was a sufficiently strong criterion to overcome some objections about the nature of the business and industry.  \n\nProtocol 16 also had been referred to the venture capitalist by one of his partners. Early in the protocol, the venture capitalist indicated an interest in the nature of the product/business and the industry. Ultimately, the proposed business's claims for their product were sufficiently strong for him to move forward on further evaluation.  \n\n# STRATEGY, FINANCE, AND THE ENTREPRENEUR  \n\nThe criteria not used in the proposal screening and assessment decisions were somewhat surprising in that they appear to contradict previous studies that found that the strategy of the proposed venture, financial factors such as risk and return on investment, and characteristics of the entrepreneur are major decision criteria in venture capitalists’ decision-making (Wells 1974; Poindexter 1976; Tyebjee and Bruno 1984; MacMillan et al 1985, 1987).  \n\nThe strategy of the proposed business was relatively unimportant in the proposal screening and proposal assessment protocols. Thought segments relating to the strategy of the proposed business accounted for only $1.3\\%$ of all thought segments in the proposal screeningprotocols and $3.5\\%$ of all thought segments in the proposal assessment protocols, and no proposals in these stages were rejected as the result of this criterion. One plausible explanation for this is that the strategy a proposed business intends to use is difficult to assess effectively based on the limited information contained in most written proposals. It is, therefore, usually examined in depth during the stage of the venture evaluation process in which the venture capitalist has the time needed to perform this examination.  \n\nWhile financial information on the proposed businesses was reviewed and commented on in a majority of proposals, it did not appear to be a major criterion in the venture capitalists’ decisions. There are two plausible interpretations that may explain this apparent contradiction. First, the importance of risk and return to the venture capitalist may have been articulated through other criteria, such as the venture capital firm's venture preference criteria, the nature of the proposed business, the economic environment of the proposed busines, or the strategy of the proposed venture. For example, when a proposed business was rejected because the venture firm did not wish to invest in the industry in which the proposed business planned to enter, it may have been that the reason for this criterion was the fact that the venture firm had found this particular industry to be relatively risky or to have a generally lower rate of return than other industries and, as a consequence, chose not to pursue any investments in such industries.  \n\nA second possible explanation is that venture capitalists make their final in-depth assessments of financial worthiness in the project evaluation stage and/or in the structuring of the deal stage of their decision-making process. If so, they could have easily been missed in this study due to the stages of the venture capitalists’ decisions examined.  \n\nIt is likely that both of these explanations apply. Thus, general risk/reward potentials are clearly captured through several of the other criteria examined by venture capitalists, and, quite probably, specific risk/reward trade-offs of the venture investment are then determined by and considered in the process of structuring the deal.  \n\nFinally. criteria relating to the characteristics of the entrepreneur or founding management team did not play a major role in the proposal screening and proposal assessment stages of the venture evaluation process. While observations on the entrepreneur were made in most of the proposals (e.g., age, experience), they did not usually play a major role in the decision to reject or accept the proposals studied. There were two exceptions to this general lack of attention to the entrepreneur in proposal screening and proposal assessment. In Protocol 4, Venture Capitalist C made some negative assumptions about the entrepreneurs involved based on the way in which the business proposal was packaged (i.e., he assumed that a competent entrepreneur would not have packaged the proposal so poorly). In Protocol 13, Venture Capitalist D became more interested in the proposed business when he recognized the company's president as someone who had previously founded a successful company in the same industry.  \n\nThe basic conclusion based on both the more general observations and the two exceptions is that the characteristics of the entrepreneur are not important in proposal screening and proposal assessment, except at the extreme ends of the distribution of entrepreneurial talent (i.e., the very incompetent and the potentially very competent).  \n\n## WHAT VENTURE CAPITALISTS AND ENTREPRENEURS SHOULDKNOW  \n\nThe findings of this study suggest several areas in which venture capitalists and prospective entrepreneurs seeking venture capital funding can be better served in their decisions.  \n\nVenture capitalists’ venture investment decisions can be viewed from an informationprocessing perspective. A fuller understanding of this process by venture capitalists could lead to greater efficiency in the ways in which they evaluate prospective businesses. This study investigated decision-making at four venture capital firms, and it is likely that a number of individual variations exist and quite possible that certain decision-making models are more effective than others.  \n\nThere are a number of implications for prospective entrepreneurs seeking venture capital funding. First, they should know the investment preferences of the venture firms they are targeting. Venture firms have different preferences as to the kinds of investments they make and sending a business plan to a venture capital firm that does not invest in the industry in which the proposed business intends to enter is a waste of time and effort. A second point related to successful funding is the importance of contacts in reaching the appropriate venture capital frm. Blindly sending business plans with a generic cover letter was not a successful approach in the proposals studied. The ideal situation is when the entrepreneur knows the venture capitalist. However, other contacts whose track record the venture capitalist appreciates--such as lawyers, bankers, accountants, consultants, and business school faculty-can be utilized.  \n\nBased on the observations made by the venture capitalists in the protocols, an idea for a product or service—-no matter how brilliant-must be presented in a professional package. The plan also should be simple, including all relevant information while keeping extraneous information to a minimum. Despite the number of books and articles written as aids in preparing a business proposal, a well-written plan was no guarantor of success. However, a professionally presented proposal appeared to be a necessary but insufficient criterion for acceptance. The thrust of the protocol comments was that venture proposals should be short documents that provide the major picces of information the venture capitalist needs to make a decision. This information includes an overview of the proposed business, the amount of funding requested, the use of these funds, a brief listing of the management of the proposed business, and a summary of both current financial information and financial projections.  \n\nFinally, as venture capital firms typically make large investments in the businesses they fund, and as they will typically be called on to make additional investments if things develop as anticipated, the entrepreneur/founding management team must be willing to work closely with the venture capitalists after the initial investment has been made. As a consequence, one of the factors carefully considered in the final stages of project evaluation is the entrepreneur's willingness and ability to do this and whether or not the “chemistry\" between the entrepreneur and the venture capitalist is right.  \n\n## CONCLUSIONS  \n\nThere remains much to be learned about venture capitalists’ decision-making. This study has contributed to this area in several respects. First, we suspected that previous research on the criteria used by venture capitalists was not reconciled with the research on the process of venture capitalist decision-making, and therefore that the findings reported to date have probably “mixed’ different stage criteria. By designing this study with in-depth field work and qualitative methods,we found that previous research that focused only on criteria without regard for the stage of the decision process very likely generated spurious results. Second, by focusing on the criteria venture capitalists' examine in the early stages of the venture evaluation process, this study helps move the literature from a single-stage, single-set of criteria to the more complex, and realistic, perspective of a multistage, multicriteria, and multiperson decision. Finally, this study demonstrates that when real-time decisions are made, verbal protocol analysiswhich can capture the full range of data nuances and conditionality-—-is a powerful data-collection method that deserves far greater use than it has received in the past.  \n\nFor prospective entrepreneurs, this study provides information on the criteria sought by venture capitalists that can aid the entrepreneur in seeking venture capital funding. Finally, for venture capitalists, this study has provided a starting point for discussing the effciency and effectiveness of the venture investment decision-making process.  \n\n## REFERENCES  \n\nBettman, J.R. 1974.

The paper examines a model where a strategic investor can achieve synergies, but can also face a confict of interest with the entrepreneur. If the start-up is a complement to the strategic partner, it is optimal to obtain funding from the strategic investor. If the start-up is a mild substitute, the entrepreneur prefers an independent venture capitalist. With a strong substitute, syndication becomes optimal, such that the independent venture capitalist is the active lead investor and the strategic partner a passive coinvestor. The expected returns for the entrepreneur are nonmonotonic, lowest for a mild substitute, and higher for a strong substitute as well as for a complement. The paper also explains why a strategic investor often pays a higher valuation than an independent venture capitalist. $\\copyright$ 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

How is a strategic investor like Intel different from a purely financial investor, such as an independent venture capitalist? What does it mean to be a strategic investor? And how do entrepreneurs view an investor with a strategic objective?  \n\nWith the growing importance of entrepreneurial ventures, these questions are becoming increasingly pertinent. Not only is the venture capital industry growing dramatically, but it is also populated by an increasingly diverse set of investors. In addition to the traditional purely financial investors (namely the many private independent venture capital partnerships), corporations as diverse as Microsoft, UPS, or Reuters hope to leverage their existing businesses into the venture capital market. There are investment banks (such as Hambrecht and Quist) that hope to extend their expertise and relationships into venture investing. There are some network-based concepts of strategic venture investing, such as the Kleiner Perkins Java fund, which combines the interests of a number of \"Java-centric’ corporations, or CMGI which is an Internet-focussed business incubator. Most recently even the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) decided to launch its own strategic venture capital fund.  \n\nWhat objectives do these so-called “captive”’ venture capitalists pursue? Consider the following press release, announcing a \\$1 bilion fund by CMGI and its venture capital affiliate, $@$ Ventures (January 24th, 2000):  \n\nThe new venture fund will focus exclusively on investing in and supporting the rapid development and growth of Internet enabling technologies and infrastructure companies that are synergistic with the CMGI and $@$ Ventures network.  \n\nAchieving synergies with their core business is the leading explanation for these strategic venture investments. In a survey of corporate venture capitalists, Yost and Devlin (1993) find that $93\\%$ of all respondents considered strategic returns a main objective. Achieving synergies is typically viewed as something desirable. But there is a question of exactly who benefits from them? In particular, it is not obvious that entrepreneurs would actually want their investors to be pursuing synergies. For example, in an extensive study of corporate venture investing, Block and MacMillan (1993) note that entrepreneurs can distrust corporate investors because “they will control their ventures to satisfy corporate objectives at the expense of the ventures' well being'.  \n\nThis paper provides a theoretical foundation to address the topic of strategic venture investments. It examines a model in which a strategic investor competes with independent venture capitalists to finance an entrepreneur's new venture. An important aspect of venture financing is the support provided by the investor.1 Investors compete not only on the price of equity (i.e., the valuation), but also with the level of support that they can credibly provide. We define a strategic investor as an investor that owns some asset whose value is affected by the new venture. From this definition we derive that an independent venture capitalist only pursues financial objectives, while the strategic investor also cares about the new venture's strategic impact. The model allows for both positive and negative interactions, i.e., success of the new venture could complement or cannibalize the strategic investor's asset.  \n\nDepending on the underlying characteristics of the new venture, our analysis uncovers three distinct optimal financing arrangements. If the new venture is a complement, the entrepreneur chooses the strategic investor. Although the strategic investor's level of support is below the first-best level, it is higher than what a venture capitalist would provide. But if the venture is a substitute, then the entrepreneur prefers venture capital financing. Even though the entrepreneur could extract a higher valuation out of the strategic investor, the independent venture capitalist offers more support ex post. This result holds when the strategic investor is equally or less able than a venture capitalist, and it frequently continues to hold even when the strategic investor is more able. Moreover, it only holds when the venture poses a relatively small threat to the strategic investor's asset. A third type of financing arises when the new venture poses a large threat. In this case, there is syndicated financing. The venture capitalist is the lead investor, actively supporting the venture and typically holding a board seat. The strategic investor, by contrast, remains a passive investor, not providing support nor holding a board seat. In fact, the strategic investor's main role is to hold equity, so as to reduce the venture capitalist's stake in the new venture. This reduces the venture capitalist's support for the new venture and thereby curbs excessive cannibalization.  \n\nThe model also makes predictions about the valuation that the entrepreneur can obtain from the two types of investors. We find that for a wide range of parameters the strategic investor is willing to pay a higher valuation, i.e., take a smaller equity stake. However, we also show that the so-called post-money valuation, which is the standard way of valuing firms in the venture capital industry, can be a very misleading indicator of underlying firm values. This is because it does not reflect the intangible value of investor support. If we consider an accurate measure of value, such as the expected return for the entrepreneur, then we find another interesting result. The more a new venture threatens to cannibalize the value of existing assets, the lower its chances of success, but the higher its value for the entrepreneur.  \n\nWe also consider a number of extensions of the model that show the robustness of the results and provide some additional insights. For example, we show that if the strategic investor and the venture capitalist have very distinct abilities, then it is possible to have syndicated finance where both types of investors hold board seats and actively provide support. Moreover, if there is more than one strategic investor, then it is also possible that several of them will hold passive stakes.  \n\nThis work is related to a number of papers in the financial contracting literature. Aghion and Tirole (1994), for example, derive conditions under which entrepreneurs might seek external finance to alleviate a hold-up problem with a contracting partner. The question of how ownership of one asset affects the ability to invest in other assets is also central to the analysis of conglomerate structures (see, e.g.,  \n\nGertner et al., 1994; Stein, 1997). The paper is also related to the work by Anton and Yao (1994,1995),Anand and Galetovic (2000), and Gans and Stern (2000) on contracting between entrepreneurs and established corporations in the presence of weak intellectual property rights.2 It also contributes to the growing literature on finance and product market interactions (see, e.g., Brander and Lewis, 1986; Maksimovic and Titman, 1991). While much of this literature has been concerned with how financing affect a firm's strategy, this paper examines how the strategy pursued by the financiers affects firms. On the empirical side, Gompers and Lerner (2000) provide some evidence on corporate venture capital. They find that the main measurable difference between corporate and independent venture capitalists is that corporations pay higher valuations. This is consistent with the analysis of this paper.3  \n\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the basic model. Section 3 derives the optimal financing pattern. Section 4 explores the difference between valuation and value. Section 5 examines a variety of model extensions. Section 6 concludes. All formal proofs are relegated to Appendix A.  \n\n## 2. The model  \n\nConsider a risk-neutral world with no discounting. An entrepreneur $(E)$ wants to start a new venture, but has no wealth. She requires an amount $I$ to fund the venture. She can approach a competitive pool of independent venture capitalists $(V)$ and/or a strategic investor $(S)$ . There are two possible future states of nature that we call success and failure. Success occurs with probability $q$  \n\nConsider first the case in which $E$ contracts with $V$ . If the venture fails there are no returns, and we normalize the ex post utilities by $u_{E}=0$ and $u_{V}=0$ . In case of success, the new venture generates transferable profits that are normalized to one, and a nontransferable value of $\\beta\\geqslant0$ to $E$ Let $\\alpha_{V}\\in[0,1]$ be $V$ 's share in the profits, so that $u_{V}=\\alpha_{V}$ and $u_{E}=1+\\beta-\\alpha_{V}$ in case of success. This simple specification eliminates any considerations of capital structure from the analysis. Without loss of generality we can represent ownership stakes with equity stakes.?  \n\n$V$ is a purely financial investor that only cares about the profits generated by the new venture. $S$ differs from $V$ in one important dimension: $S$ owns an asset that is affected by the performance of the new venture. The asset can be thought of in a number of ways, most naturally as a line of business, but also as physical assets, contractual assets, or even human capital. If $E$ contracts with $S$ instead of $V$ $E$ will also get $u_{E}=0$ in case of failure and $u_{E}=1+\\beta-\\alpha_{S}$ in case of success. The value of $S$ 's asset is given by $\\underline{{u}}_{S}$ in case of failure and $\\bar{u}_{S}$ in case of success, so that $S^{\\prime}$ s ex post utility is given by $u_{S}=u_{S}$ in case of failure and $u_{S}=\\bar{u}_{S}+\\alpha_{S}$ in case of success. $\\underline{{u}}_{S}$ and $\\bar{u}_{S}$ can be thought of as the reduced form utilities of the potentially very complicated interaction between the new venture and the strategic investor.6  \n\nWe define $\\theta\\equiv\\bar{u}_{S}-\\underline{{u}}_{S}$ , then $\\theta$ measures the change in the value of the strategic investor's asset, if the new venture were to succeed. $\\theta$ measures the net impact of all the strategic actions between the new venture and assets of the strategic investor. It summarizes how valuable the success of the new venture would be for S's existing asset. If $\\theta>0$ we say that $S$ has a complementary asset, and if $\\theta<0$ the new venture partially substitutes (or cannibalizes) $S$ s asset. Most models of competition suggest $\\theta<0$ , as the industry changes from an oligopoly of $n$ firms to one with $n+1$ firms. $\\theta>0$ may arise because of demand externalities, such as between software and hardware (Katz and Shapiro, 1994) or because of cost complementarities (such as through the reduction of input prices). $\\theta$ also corresponds directly to well-known concepts in strategic management, namely competence-enhancing and competencedestroying innovations (Tushman and Anderson, 1986). Finally, the model is sufficiently general to accommodate an interpretation where managers do not always act in the best interest of the shareholders (Jensen and Meckling, 1976). In this case, $\\theta$ represents the impact on the incumbent management team's utility, which may differ from the shareholder's utility functions.7  \n\nWhether the new venture succeeds or fails depends on the support of the investor. In the context of venture capital investments, investors can engage in a number of activities that increase the value of the venture. These activities are by and large subtle so that they cannot be contracted upon. Even if some actions are contractible, what matters is that there are some others that are not contractible. The level of support is then endogenously determined by the investor's incentives. We model this with a simple linear quadratic model. Let $q_{i}=P_{i}+p_{i}\\sigma_{i}$ where $\\sigma_{i}$ is the level of support provided by $i=V,S$ at a private cost $\\textstyle c(\\sigma_{i})={\\frac{1}{2}}\\sigma_{i}^{2}$  \n\nIn addition to having a strategic objective, we also allow $S$ to differ from $V$ in a number of other dimensions. In particular, the base probability of success can differ for $S$ and $V$ ,as captured by $P_{S}$ and $P_{V}$ . And the extent to which their support further increases the base probability of success can also differ for $S$ and $V$ ,as captured by $p_{S}$ and $p_{V}$ . In general there can be a large number of investor- and dealspecific factors that influence these ability parameters, such as experience, technology, or fit. The model allows for this heterogeneity, and we say that $S$ is more (less) able than $V$ if $P_{S}>(<)P_{V}$ and/or $p_{S}>(<)p_{V}$ ：  \n\nWe assume that investors can only duplicate each other's support activities (we relax this assumption in Section 5.3). As a consequence, only one investor actively provides support. The other investor, however, can still hold a passive stake. The active investor can hold a board seat and/or other control rights, whereas the passive investor has no board seats or other control rights.  \n\nIf $V$ is the active investor, we denote the ex ante utilities of all parties by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{U_{E}^{V}=q_{V}(1+\\beta-\\alpha_{V}-\\alpha_{S}),}\\ &{U_{V}^{V}=q_{V}\\alpha_{V}-c(\\sigma_{V})-I_{V},}\\ &{U_{S}^{V}=\\underline{{u}}_{S}+q_{V}(\\alpha_{S}+\\beta)-I_{S},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $q_{V}=P_{V}+p_{V}\\sigma_{V}$ and $I_{S}+I_{V}=I$ . For $I_{S}=\\alpha_{S}=0$ , we talk of pure $V$ financing, whereas for $I_{S}>0$ and $\\alpha_{S}>0$ , we talk of mixed financing, where $S$ is a passive investor.  \n\nIf $S$ is the active investor then $V$ never becomes a passive investor (see Appendix A). We can therefore limit ourselves to pure $S$ -financing. We have  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{U_{E}^{S}=q_{S}(1+\\beta-\\alpha_{S}),}}\\ {{}}\\ {{U_{S}^{S}={\\underline{{u}}}_{S}+q_{S}(\\alpha_{S}+\\theta)-c(\\sigma_{S})-I,}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $q_{S}=P_{S}+p_{S}\\sigma_{S}$  \n\nWe make some assumptions on parameter values. First, we assume that $1+\\beta+$ $\\theta>0$ , so that the value of the new venture in case of success is always positive. Second, we assume that $I{<}P_{V}+{\\textstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}}p_{V}^{2}$ . This guarantees that the project can always be financed by_ a competitive $V$ . Third, we assume that $P_{V}>(1+\\beta)p_{V}^{2}$ and $P_{S}>$ $(1+\\beta-\\theta)p_{S}^{2}$ . This guarantees that the utility frontier between $E$ and $V$ or $S$ is always downward sloping.  \n\nWeassumethat $0\\leqslant I_{j}\\leqslant I.$ $j=S,V$ , and that no other transfer payments are possible at date zero between the three parties. This assumption is standard in a moral hazard model and ensures that the agent, in this case the investor, cannot simply buy the asset. It can be justified by a simple no-free-profits assumption that says that no imposter can ever make a profit by pretending to be one of the involved parties. More specifically, assume that there is a large pool of impostors with zero reservation utility. Whenever there are positive transfer payments, they can mimic the receiving party and take the money. As a consequence, no party will ever make any upfront payments. Moreover, we assume that $\\alpha_{i}\\in[0,1]$ , which also follows from the no-free-profits assumption. If $\\alpha_{i}<0$ were possible for some $i$ , then the other two parties would have an incentive to claim the venture was successful, even when it was not, and thereby make free profits. Apart from this, all parties have symmetric information.  \n\nWe also need to specify how contracts are generated. As a base case we use a simple game in which $E$ has all the bargaining power. The contract game is as follows. $E$ can make a take-it-or-leave-it offer to $S$ , who can either accept or reject the offer. $E$ 's take-it-or-leave-it offer to $S$ can also stipulate syndication, in which case both $S$ and some designated $V$ have to accept the offer. If $E$ does not want to make an offer to $S$ , or if the offer was rejected, $E$ can access a perfectly competitive market of $V\\mathrm{s}$ . To model the competitive market of $V\\mathrm{s}$ ,we assume that $E$ can make a take-it-or-leave-it offer to any $V$ (we would obtain exactly the same outcome if the V's make competitive offers to $E$ ). In Section 5.1 we will examine the importance of this game structure. Contracts are written at date zero. Between date zero and one the active investor provides noncontractible support. At date one the project is either successful or not, and returns are paid out.  \n\n## 3. Optimal choice of investors  \n\nTo solve for the optimal contract, we will first consider what happens if no deal is made with $S$ . In this case $E$ approaches the competitive pool of $V$ , and obtains a contract $\\underline{{{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}}}_{V}^{V}$ , so that $U_{V}^{V}(\\underline{{{\\alpha}}}_{V}^{V})=0\\equiv U_{V}$ $S$ 's utility is by $U_{S}^{V}(\\alpha_{V}^{V})=u_{S}+q_{V}\\theta\\equiv U_{S}$ Consider now $E$ 's optimal offer to $S$ . If she wants $S$ to be the active investor, she maximizes $U_{E}^{S}$ , subject to $U_{S}^{S}\\geqslant\\underline{{U}}_{S}$ Naturally, we also have $U_{V}^{S}\\geqslant\\underline{{U}}_{V}$ If she wants $V$ as the active investor, she maximizes $U_{E}^{V}$ , subject to $U_{S}^{V}\\geqslant\\underline{{U}}_{S}$ and $U_{V}^{V}\\geqslant\\underline{{U}}_{V}$ . Note that the case of pure $V$ -financing is a special case of this, in which $E$ does not actually have to make an offer to $S$ With downwardsloping utility frontiers, these participation constraints are always binding, so that $U_{j}^{i}=\\underline{{U}}_{j}$ for all $i=S,V$ and $j=S,V$ .Since $\\underline{{U}}_{S}$ and $\\underline{{U}}_{V}$ do not depend on the offer to $S$ , maximizing $U_{E}^{i}$ is equivalent to maximizing $U_{E}^{i}+\\underline{{U}}_{S}^{i}+\\underline{{U}}_{V}^{i}$ $i=S,V$ . But this is also equivalent to maximizing the sum of utilities $W_{i}=U_{E}^{i}+U_{S}^{i}+U_{V}^{i}$ . This is a useful transformation. It allows us to express $E$ 's optimal offer as the contract that maximizes $W=$ $\\operatorname{Max}[W_{S},W_{V}]$  \n\nThe choice of investor depends on the level of support provided by $S$ and $V$ .This depends on the endogenously determined equity stakes $\\alpha_{i},~i=S,V$ Consider the privately optimal choices from the first-order conditions:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{}}&{{\\sigma_{S}=p_{S}(\\alpha_{S}+\\theta),}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{}}&{{\\sigma_{V}=p_{V}\\alpha_{V}.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nBy contrast, the efficient level of support, that would maximize $W_{i}$ givenby  \n\n$$\n\\sigma_{i}^{*}=p_{i}(1+\\beta+\\theta).\n$$  \n\nThere are several reasons why an investor provides an inefficient level of support. First, the investor only considers his share of profits, $\\texttt{\\em}$ , ignoring the profits that accrue to $E$ $(1-\\alpha)$ . Second, the investor does not take into account $E$ 's private benefits $\\beta$ Third, if $V$ is the active investor, he does not take into account the externality $\\theta$ on $S^{\\mathfrak{s}}$ other asset. And finally it can be that the less efficient investor is chosen.  \n\nWithout the no-free-profits constraint, it would be easy to achieve the efficient equilibrium. For $W_{S}({\\sigma}_{S}^{*})>W_{V}({\\sigma}_{V}^{*})$ ， $S$ would be the active investor, and $\\alpha_{S}=1+\\beta$ $\\sigma_{S}$ would then maximize $W_{S}$ , and transfer payments would be used to ensure ${\\cal U}_{V}=$ $\\underline{{U}}_{V}$ and $U_{S}=\\underline{{U}}_{S}$ . Similarly, for $W_{S}({\\sigma}_{S}^{*})<W_{V}({\\sigma}_{V}^{*})$ $V$ would be the active investor, and $\\alpha_{V}=1+\\beta+\\theta$ would achieve the efficient outcome. These arrangements, however, are rather artificial. Consider $W_{S}(\\sigma_{S}^{*})>W_{V}(\\sigma_{V}^{*});$ $S$ would not only have to make a transfer payment to $E$ to buy all the returns of the new venture (i.e., buy out the venture), but it would also have to make a transfer payment to $V$ , so that in return $V$ offers an additional incentive payment $\\beta$ to $S$ . Such transfer payments are rarely observed in reality, partly because parties do not trust each other enough to transfer large sums of money for financing a new and unproven opportunity. We capture this with our assumption of no-free-profits, which eliminates these artificial solutions. It allows us to focus on outcome-based equity contracts that resemble much more closely the contracts actually used.  \n\nConsider thus the model with the no-free-profits constraint. Define $\\theta_{0}$ from $\\sigma_{V}(\\theta_{0})=\\sigma_{V}^{*}$ and $\\theta_{1}$ from $U_{E}^{S}(\\theta_{1})=U_{E}^{V}(\\theta_{1})$  \n\nProposition $I$ (Equilibrium financing pattern). Suppose $S$ and $V$ are equally able.  \n\n(i If $\\theta>\\theta_{1}=0$ , then there is pure $S$ financing. Relative to the first-best, there is too little support, i.e., $\\sigma_{S}<\\sigma^{*}$   \n(i) If $\\theta_{0}<\\theta<\\theta_{1}=0$ , then there is pure $V$ -financing. Relative to the first-best, there is too little support, i.e., $\\sigma_{V}<\\sigma^{*}$   \n(ii) If $\\theta<\\theta_{0}$ , then there is mixed financing, where $V$ is the active and $S$ is the passive investor. The level of support is first-best, i.e., $\\sigma_{V}=\\sigma^{*}$  \n\nProposition 1 shows that even though $S$ and $V$ may be equally able investors, the choice of investor still matters. If the new venture is a complement to $S$ , then $S$ is the optimal investor. But if the new venture is a substitute to S's existing asset, then $E$ prefers to have $V$ as active investor. Moreover, if the new venture is only a mild threat, $V$ will be the sole investor, whereas if it is a strong threat, then there will be a syndicate in which $V$ is the active and $S$ the passive investor.  \n\nTo provide some intuition for this result, consider Fig. 1. It exploits the property that $E$ s preferred solution is also the one that maximizes $W$ . It shows the endogenous levels of $q_{S}$ and $q_{V}$ . These depend on the support $\\sigma_{i}$ , which are a function of $\\theta$ and $\\alpha_{i}$ , where $\\alpha_{i}$ is chosen endogenously to satisfy $U_{i}=\\underline{{U}}_{i},i=S,V.$ In Appendix A we show that $q_{V}(\\theta)$ is constant, $q_{S}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ is increasing in $\\theta$ , and $q_{S}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ equals $q_{V}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ at $\\theta=0$ . Moreover, $q^{*}({\\boldsymbol{\\theta}})$ always lies above $q_{S}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$  \n\nConsider now $\\theta>0$ . Both $S$ and $V$ provide too little support relative to the firstbest. But $S$ always provides a higher level of support than $V$ . Hence $S$ -financing is more efficient. This explains the first part of Proposition 1. The situation changes for $\\theta<0$ $V$ now provides the higher level of support than $S$ .For $\\theta$ not too negative, pure $V$ -financing now dominates. The reason that $S$ loses out as an investor is that it cannot commit to provide an adequate level of support. This explains the second part of Proposition 1. As $\\theta$ becomes strongly negative, however, yet another situation arises. For $\\theta<\\theta_{0}$ , we have $\\sigma^{*}(\\theta)<\\sigma_{V}(\\theta)$ , i.e., the efficient level of support drops below that offered by V. $E$ can find a better solution by asking $S$ to co-finance the project. $S$ is eager to take some of the equity, to reduce $V$ 's incentives. The outcome is syndicated financing, in which $V$ remains the active investor, but $S$ invests as a passive investor without control.  \n\n![](images/ad45ca86182567033549a6b6aba1bec930ee559774cad0a0139ce17b11e37f68.jpg)  \nFig. 1. $q^{*}$ is the efficient level. $q_{S}$ and $q_{V}$ are $S^{\\gamma}\\mathrm{s}$ and $V$ 's privately optimal effort levels. If $q_{V}$ is smaller than $q_{S}$ then pure $S$ -financing is optimal. If it is bigger, then $V$ -financing is optimal, except when $q_{V}$ becomes bigger than $q^{*}$ , in which case mixed financing becomes optimal.  \n\nProposition 2 (Comparative statics)  \n\n(i) An increase in $\\beta$ decreases $\\theta_{0}$ and leaves $\\theta_{1}$ constant. (i) An increase in $I$ increases $\\theta_{0}$ and leaves $\\theta_{1}$ constant. (ii) An increase in $P_{S}$ andlor $p_{S}$ leaves $\\theta_{0}$ constant and decreases $\\theta_{1}$ (iv) An increase in $P_{V}$ andlor $p_{V}$ decreases $\\theta_{0}$ and increases $\\theta_{1}$  \n\nProposition 2 shows how the three different financing regions depend on model parameters. Fig. 2 shows that an increase in $\\beta$ will not affect region in  which  \n\n![](images/3cc44cb2768f1a6bc30c1a3ec6c265afbf71edec5f131c5322d90fdbea79349b.jpg)  \nFig. 2. An increase of $\\beta$ from $\\beta_{1}$ to $\\beta_{2}$ will increase the effcient level $q^{*}$ .V's effort level $q_{V}$ remains unaffected, and $S^{\\prime}$ s effort level $q s$ increases (decreases) for $\\theta>0$ $\\left(\\theta<0\\right)$ . This leads to an increase in the range where pure $V$ -financing is optimal.  \n\n$S$ -financing is optimal. However, it will increase the range in which $V$ -financing is optimal and reduce the range in which mixed financing is optimal. The intuition is that if $E$ cares more about success per se, she is less interested in having $S$ absorb equity to reduce $V$ 's support. From Fig. 3 we see that a decrease in $I$ will have the same effect as an increase in $\\beta$ . The reason here, however, is that the lower $I$ implies a lower $\\alpha_{V}$ , and thus lower support $\\sigma_{V}$ by $V$ $V$ 's thus overinvest less often, and hence there is less mixed finance. Figs. 2c and d consider the case in which $S$ and $V$ differ in terms of underlying ability. Fig. 4 considers the case in which $S$ becomes more able than $V$ i.e., $P_{S}>P_{V}$ and/or $p_{S}>p_{V}$ . The range in which $S$ -financing is optimal becomes larger, and now also includes some cases in which $\\theta<0$ . This is because a higher ability now compensates for $S$ 's strategic motivation. The range in which $V$ financing is optimal naturally shrinks. The range of mixed financing, however, is not affected, as $V$ is the active investor under both $V$ -financing and mixed financing. Finally, consider Fig. 5 where $V$ becomes a more able investor than $S$ ,i.e., $P_{V}>P_{S}$ and/or $p_{V}>p_{S}$ . In this case, the range of $V$ -financing increases, whereas both $S$ financing and mixed financing become less likely.  \n\nThe key insight from this section is that with non-contractible support the choice of investor matters. Even if $S$ is more able than $V$ , the opportunity to internalize externalities actually becomes a competitive disadvantage. In particular, it prevents $S$ from providing an adequate level of support to $E$ .Ex ante $S$ would like to commit to a high level of support, but ex post it cannot promise to deliver it. Achieving synergies can thus become a competitive hinderance.  \n\n![](images/e6db1b02c20b0f15743fc2e2e23eab3dfaf7f4d8e316d553625fdb481d659dae.jpg)  \nFig. 3. An increase of $I$ from $I_{1}$ to $I_{2}$ will not affect the efficient level $q^{*}$ ,but increase $S$ s and $V$ 's effort levels $q_{S}$ and $q_{V}$ . This leads to an increase in the range where mixed financing is optimal.  \n\n![](images/eca327237b5eba211d33114ab1d8a4632a83fa310b25ad7cfd77de62bcd7e0ec.jpg)  \nFig. 4. An increase of $P_{S}$ from $P_{S}^{1}$ to $P_{S}^{2}$ increases the efficient effort level under $S$ -financing, but not under $V$ -financing. It also increases the optimal effort for $S$ but not for $V$ . This leads to an increase in the range where $S$ financing is optimal. The same is also true for an increase in $p_{S}$  \n\n![](images/338c8bf7ee788aca39255b6df8c19e04957f2991aa83f79476d0f8ed81d1ec32.jpg)  \nFig. 5. An increase of $P_{V}$ from $P_{V}^{1}$ to $P_{V}^{2}$ increases the efficient effort level under $V$ financing, but not under $S$ financing. It also increases the optimal effort for $V$ but not for $S$ . This leads to an increase in the range where $V$ -financing is optimal. The same is true for an increase in $p_{V}$  \n\n## 4. Valuation and value  \n\nThe analysis so far focuses on the question of who will get to finance the new venture. We now use the model to make predictions about the equity stakes offered in equilibrium. In the venture capital industry, offers are measured in terms of their implied valuation of the firm. The so-called post-money valuation calculates the value of the firm on the basis of the stake purchased by the investor. If an investor pays an amount $I$ to obtain a stake $\\texttt{\\em}$ ，then the valuation $\\varGamma$ is given by $\\alpha I=$ $I\\Leftrightarrow T=I/\\alpha$ . The so-called pre-money valuation is given by $\\mathnormal{T}-\\mathnormal{I}=((1-\\alpha)/\\alpha)\\mathnormal{I}$ and behaves analogously. The larger $\\texttt{\\em}$ , the more the entrepreneur has to give up to raise an amount $I$ , and thus the lower the valuation of the new venture.  \n\nWhen $E$ chooses an investor, let $T_{S}$ and $T_{V}$ be the highest valuation that she can obtain from $S$ or $V$ . Furthermore, let $\\boldsymbol{{T_{M}}}=\\boldsymbol{{I}}/(\\alpha_{S}^{M}+\\alpha_{V}^{M})$ be the highest valuation under  mixed  financing. Finally，define $\\theta_{\\Gamma}\\dot{\\equiv}(P_{V}^{2}-P_{S}^{2}+2I(p_{V}^{2}-2p_{S}^{2}))$ $/2p_{S}^{2}\\sqrt{P_{V}^{2}+2I p_{V}^{2}}$  \n\nProposition 3 (Valuation).  \n\n(i) If $S$ and $V$ are equally able, $E$ can always extract a higher valuation from S, i.e., $T_{S}>T_{V}$ forall $\\theta\\neq0$   \n(i) $T_{V}$ is independent of $\\theta.$ $T_{S}$ is decreasing in $\\theta$ for $\\theta<\\theta_{I}$ and increasing for $\\theta>\\theta_{T}$   \n(i) $T_{V}$ is increasing in $P_{V}$ and $p_{V}.\\boldsymbol{{I}}_{S}$ is increasing in $P_{S}$ and $p_{S}$   \n(iv)For $\\theta<\\theta_{0}$ , mixed financing achieves a higher valuation than pure $V$ -financing, i.e., $T_{M}>T_{V}$ ：  \n\nFig. 6 illustrates $T_{S}$ and $T_{V}$ , as a function of $\\theta$ . Consider first the case in which $S$ and $V$ are equally able. $T_{V}$ is constant, but $T_{S}$ lies above $T_{V}$ except for $\\theta=0$ Moreover, $T_{S}$ is decreasing for $\\theta<0$ and increasing in $\\theta>0$ . Even if a corporation is an equally able investor, it will pay a higher valuation than an independent venture capitalist. Because $S$ cares about the externality $\\theta,S$ is always keen to influence the new venture. Interestingly, this is true for complements and substitutes. For $\\theta>0$ $S$ 's opportunity cost of not becoming the investor is that it will receive too little support. And for $\\theta<0$ , S's opportunity cost of not becoming the investor is that it will receive too much support. In either case, $E$ can extract a higher valuation from $S$ because of its strategic motivation. Fig.6 also indicates the effect of increasing and decreasing S's ability (i.e., changing $P_{S}$ and $p_{S}$ ). If $S$ becomes more able, $E$ can extract more value, and $S$ has to pay a higher valuation. But even if $S$ is less able, he may still have to pay a higher valuation, either if $\\theta$ is sufficiently large and positive, or if $\\theta$ is sufficiently large but negative.  \n\n![](images/4cd5b121929f0f9d17eba001e345ba47a18cf60d0ce9d20afbac9cc06053b8c6.jpg)  \nFig. 6. If $P_{S}=P_{V}$ and $p_{S}=p_{V}$ , then $S^{\\prime}$ 's valuation is always higher than $V$ 's, except at $\\theta=0$ ,where they are the same. An increase in $P_{S}$ and/or $p_{S}$ will shift the valuation function up and to the left, so that $S$ S valuation is always higher than $V$ s. A decrease in $P_{S}$ and/or $p_{S}$ will shift the valuation function down and to the right, so that $V$ 's valuation is higher around $\\theta=0$  \n\nProposition 3 also shows that over the range in which mixed financing is optimal, the valuation of the firm is higher under mixed financing than under pure $V$ financing. The intuition is that mixed financing improves $S$ 's utility by preventing excessive cannibalization. In return for this benefit, $E$ can again extract better terms from $S$ . This increases the overall valuation.  \n\nA key thing to recognize at this point is that valuation alone does not determine the investor choice. The following corollary emphasizes this point.  \n\nCorollary to Propositions 1 and 3. The entrepreneur does not always choose the investor from whom she could extract the highest valuation. A higher valuation may not imply a higher expected utility for the entrepreneur.  \n\nThis corollary exposes the inadequacy of post-money valuations as a criterion for investment decisions. The valuations offered by different types of investors is a poor indicator of the attractiveness of the offers. This is because the valuation is not an indicator of the intangible benefit of having a value-added investor. To the contrary, it can be very misleading. As $\\theta$ extends further into the negative range, $S$ s valuation rises. However, since $S$ provides increasingly less support, the utility of choosing $S$ can actually decline. The correct decision criterion for making the investor choice is obviously $E^{\\prime}$ s expected utility. All of our results also hold for $\\beta=0$ . Maximizing $U_{E}$ is thus equivalent to maximizing the expected returns of the insiders. The following proposition examines the structure of these expected returns.  \n\nProposition $^{4}$ (Non-monotonic returns).  \n\n(i) Suppose investors are equally able. E's expected utility $U_{E}(\\theta)$ isdecreasingfor $\\theta<\\theta_{0}$ , constant for $\\theta_{0}<\\theta<\\theta_{1}$ , and increasing for $\\theta>\\theta_{1}$   \n(i An increase in $P_{S}$ or $p_{S}$ increases $U_{E}(\\theta)$ for $\\theta>\\theta_{1}$ . An increase in $P_{V}$ or $p_{V}$ increases $U_{E}(\\theta)$ for $\\theta<\\theta_{1}$  \n\nThis proposition shows that the expected utility has a nonmonotonic shape, as depicted in Fig. 7. The intuition is as follows. As a benchmark, consider the intermediate region $[\\theta_{0},\\theta_{1}]$ in which $V$ -financing is optimal. In this region $U_{E}$ is constant, since $\\theta$ does not influence $V$ 's support.  \n\nFor $\\theta<\\theta_{0}$ ， $E$ is better off with mixed financing, even though pure $V$ -financing is still available. The lower $\\theta$ , the better the terms that $E$ can extract from $S$ as a passive investor. Hence $U_{E}(\\theta)$ decreasing in $\\theta$ . This result is particularly surprising. The lower $\\theta$ , the more $S$ dilutes V's stake, and thus the lower the equilibrium probability of success $q_{V}(\\theta)=q^{*}$ .Yet the lower $\\theta$ , the higher $E$ 's expected returns. This is because $E$ can extract additional rents through the terms at which she sells a passive stake to $S$  \n\nA different rationale drives the result that $U_{E}(\\theta)$ is increasing for $\\theta>\\theta_{1}$ . In this range, $E$ can improve on pure $V$ -financing by obtaining pure $S$ financing. The greater $\\theta$ , the greater the value created by the new venture, and thus the greater the value captured by $E$  \n\n![](images/b1f2f220141ebb62f5bdfacabb1c10ab9d3aecd46d6ca10a8dc9131868593cc3.jpg)  \nFig. 7. $E$ s expected utility (which equals the expected returns for $\\beta=0$ ) is a decreasing function of $\\theta$ in the mixed financing region, a constant function of $\\theta$ in the $V$ -financing region, and an increasing function of $\\theta$ in the $S$ -financing region.  \n\nProposition 4 has interesting implications for the choice of entrepreneurial projects. $E$ is better off generating projects that create large externalities on $S$ be they positive or negative. The intriguing aspect is that it can be better to be a big threat, rather than a small threat. This is because only a big threat will force $S$ to join the deal and allow $E$ to extract additional rents.  \n\nThe key insight here is that under a wide set of circumstances, $S$ would pay a higher valuation than $V$ . The post-money valuation, however, can be a misleading indicator of true firm values, since they do not account for the intangible benefits of support that different investors bring to the venture.  \n\n## 5. Extensions of the model  \n\nThe previous two sections establish the main properties of the model. In this section we briefy consider a number of extensions. We focus on examining the robustness of the basic results, as well as pointing out some of the new insights. For simplicity we only consider the case in which $S$ and $V$ are equally able, i.e., $P_{S}=$ Pv = P and ps = pv = p.  \n\n### 5.1. The role of bargaining power  \n\nSo far the equilibrium is based on a simple contracting game in which $E$ can make a take-it-or-leave-it offer to $S$ If this offer is rejected, $E$ has the option to obtain pure  \n\n$V$ -financing from a competitive set of V's. In this specification $E$ has all the bargaining power vis-a-vis $S$ , by virtue of making the take-it-or-leave-it offer. To examine how our results are affected by this specific assumption, we now consider a simple alternative model in which $S$ has the bargaining power. Specifically, we assume that $S$ can make a take-it-or-leave-it offer to $E,S$ can offer either pure $S$ financing, or some type of syndicated financing. $E$ can either accept the offer, or else take her outside option of pure $V$ -financing.  \n\nProposition 5. If $S$ can make a take-it-or-leave-it offer, then (i) Propositions 1 and 2 continue to hold; (i) $T_{S}$ is decreasingin $\\theta$ with $T_{S}={\\cal{T}}_{V}$ at $\\theta=0$ ; and (ii) $U_{E}$ doesnot depend on $\\theta$  \n\nPart (i) says that the parameter regions in which $S$ financing, $V$ financing, or mixed financing are optimal do not depend on bargaining power. Intuitively, giving $S$ more bargaining power changes $\\alpha_{S}$ , which affects the shape of the $q_{S}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ function in Fig. 1. However, $q_{S}$ continues to be an increasing function of $\\theta$ , it continues to intersect $q_{V}$ at $\\theta_{1}=0$ , and the intersection of $q_{V}$ with $q^{*}$ continues to be at the same $\\theta_{0}<0$ . Therefore, the critical values between the three regions are not affected by relative bargaining power.  \n\nThe main effect of bargaining power thus concerns valuation (i.e., Propositions 3 and 4). For $\\theta>0$ $S$ can now obtain a lower valuation than $V$ $S$ no longer has to pay for the fact that it is able to achieve synergies. Instead, $S$ only has to ensure that the offer is attractive enough to prevent $E$ from taking the outside option. The higher $\\theta$ the easier it is to get $E$ . Since $S$ wants to provide more support, it can also offer a lower valuation to $E$ . This explains part (ii). For part (ii), we simply note that if $S$ has all the bargaining power, then it can always hold down $E$ to her reservation utility. This is given by $E^{\\prime}$ s utility from pure $V$ -financing, which is independent of $\\theta$  \n\nThis last result, however, depends on the extreme assumption that $S$ has all the bargaining power. If we take a model in which $E$ and $S$ share bargaining power, we get back a nonmonotonic return function. In Appendix A, we consider the generalized Nash bargaining solution, which allows for a continuous parameterization of relative bargaining power. As long as $E$ has some bargaining power $U(\\theta)$ has a nonmonotonic shape as depicted in Fig. 7. Moreover, the greater $E$ 's bargaining power, the greater the absolute (i.e., both negative and positive) slope of $U(\\theta)$  \n\nThere are obviously many other variations of the contracting game that one could consider. In Appendix A, at the end of the proof of Proposition 5, we examine whether it matters that $E$ approaches $S$ before approaching $V$ . We consider a simple model in which $E$ can choose any sequence of offers, and in which it is never too late to make another offer. We show that such a model yields exactly the same outcome as our base model. Moreover, the exact sequence of offers does not matter in this model. Similarly, if the investors can make the offers, and it is never too late to make another offer, then the results from Proposition 5 apply. Appendix A also shows that if there is a last period to make an offer, then the order of offers may matter. The results, however, remain very similar. The main difference is that for $\\theta>0$ $E$ prefers to wait until the last period before approaching $S$  \n\nThe main insight from this subsection is that the structure of the offer game affects bargaining power. This influences valuation, but not the overall contract structure.  \n\n### 5.2. Multiple strategic investors  \n\nSo far the analysis assumed that there is only one strategic investor. The success of a new venture can affect several asset-owners. As a consequence, there can be several strategic investors that can all be characterized by their respective $\\theta_{i}$ s.Wewill now extend the basic model and allow for two strategic investors.  \n\nWe denote our two strategic investors by $S_{H}$ (high $S$ ) and $S_{L}$ (low $S$ ), and w.1.o.g. assume $\\theta_{H}>\\theta_{L}$ . For simplicity, assume that $S_{H},~S_{L}$ and $V$ are all equally able. The efficient level of support is now given by $\\sigma^{*}=p(1+\\beta_{\\mathrm{\\small{\\widehat{\\alpha}}}}+\\theta_{H}+\\theta_{L})$ .Define $\\hat{\\theta}=$ $\\alpha_{S H}-1-\\beta<0$ where $\\alpha_{S H}$ satisfies $U_{S H}^{S H}(\\alpha_{S H})=U_{S H}^{V}$ and $\\hat{\\theta}=\\alpha_{V}-1-\\beta<0$ ,where $\\alpha_{V}$ satisfies $U_{V}^{V}(\\alpha_{V})=0$  \n\n### Proposition 6. Suppose $\\theta_{H}>0$ ,then  \n\n(i) for $\\theta_{L}>\\hat{\\theta}$ ,we have pure $S_{H}$ -financing with $\\sigma_{S H}<\\sigma^{*}$   \n(i) for $\\theta_{L}<\\ensuremath{\\hat{\\theta}}$ wehave mixed financing,where $S_{H}$ is the active investor, $S_{L}$ the passive investor, and $\\sigma_{S H}=\\sigma^{*}$ Suppose $\\theta_{H}<0$ , then   \n(i) for $\\theta_{L}+\\theta_{H}>\\hat{\\hat{\\theta}}$ we have pure $V$ -financing with $\\sigma_{V}<\\sigma^{*}$   \n(iv) for $\\theta_{L}+\\theta_{H}<\\hat{\\hat{\\theta}}$ wehavemixedfinancing,where $V$ is the active investor, $S_{L}$ and $S_{H}$ are passive investors, and $\\sigma_{V}=\\sigma^{*}$  \n\nThis proposition shows how Proposition 1 can be extended to the case of multiple strategic investors. There always continues to be exactly one active investor. As long as the $S$ with the highest $\\theta$ is a complement (i.e., $\\theta_{H}>0$ ), it is chosen to be the active investor. Otherwise $V$ becomes the active investor. Note that since $V$ is an investor with $\\theta=0$ $V$ effectively becomes the investor with the highest $\\theta$ . Proposition 6 also shows that the role of passive investors can be shared by several strategic investors. For $0>\\theta_{H}>\\theta_{L}$ ，both $S_{H}$ and $S_{L}$ could be asked to make investments without control.  \n\nWe thus find that the basic structure of the model generalizes to the case with multiple investors. The main new insights are that the investor with the highest value Oof $\\theta_{i}$ becomes the active investor, and there can be several passive investors.  \n\n### 5.3.Distinct investor abilities  \n\nSo far we assumed that support activities are duplicative, i.e., that there is a set of tasks that can be performed by one investor. Support from a second investor does not affect the venture's probability of success, since it only duplicates what the first investor has already done. Consider now a variation of the model in which $S$ and $V$ have distinct abilities, and in which the support provided by one investor does not subtract from the value of support by the other investor.  \n\nWe can examine this using a simple extension of the model, in which we allow both investors to contribute to the success of the new venture. Assume that the probability of success is now given by $q=P+p\\sigma_{V}+p\\sigma_{S}$  \n\n### Proposition 7.  \n\n(i) If $|\\theta|$ is not too large, then both $S$ and $V$ become active investors. The optimal contract satisfies $\\alpha_{V}=\\alpha_{S}+\\theta$ , and the optimal $\\alpha_{S}$ $(\\alpha_{V})$ is decreasing (increasing) in $\\theta$ ：   \n(i) If $\\theta$ is suffciently large and positive, then $V$ is an active investor. $S$ is an active partner, but without a stake in the company.   \n(ii) If $\\theta$ is sufficiently large and negative, then $V$ is an active investor. $S$ is not an active investor, though it can still be a passive investor.  \n\nConsider first the case in which $|\\theta|$ is not too large. In this case $E$ wants to use both $S$ and $V$ as active investors, to benefit from their respective support. The optimal contract balances the incentives for $S$ and $V$ ,so that $c_{S}^{\\prime}(\\theta)=p(\\alpha_{S}+\\theta)=p\\alpha_{V}=$ $c_{V}^{\\prime}(\\theta)$ . For larger $\\theta,S$ will be allocated a smaller and $V$ a larger equity stake. This means the stronger $S^{\\dagger}$ s strategic motivation, the less it requires monetary incentives. If $\\theta$ becomes sufficiently large and positive, the optimal contract has $\\alpha_{S}=0$ and $I_{S}=0$ ,i.e., $E$ wants to allocate maximal equity to $V$ . She nonetheless keeps $S$ as an active partner without equity stake, since $S$ is strategically motivated to provide support. The situation is very different for the case when $\\theta$ is large and negative. In this case, giving control to $S$ means giving $S$ the opportunity to reduce the probability of success. Indeed, if $\\alpha_{S}$ small, then $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{S}=p(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{S}+\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ is negative, and $S$ becomes destructive to the new venture. Obviously, $E$ could increase $\\alpha_{S}$ , but there is a cost in terms of reducing $V$ 's incentives. Instead, it can be better for $E$ to simply refuse access to $S$ . In this case the model actually reduces back to the standard model with $V$ as the only active investor. From our previous analysis, we know that for $\\theta<\\theta_{0}$ $S$ becomes a passive investor.  \n\nThe model in which investors have distinct abilities is fairly similar to the basic model. The main new aspect is that there can be a syndicate in which both investors are active. It can even be that $S$ is an active partner, say with a board seat, but without an equity stake.  \n\n### 5.4. Endogenous strategic effects  \n\nSo far, $\\theta$ is exogenous. By becoming an investor, $S$ can gain additional means of influencing the new venture. $S$ may want to reduce cannibalization or increase the complementarity of the new venture to its existing asset. In such an environment, the choice of investor can influence the level of $\\theta$ . In particular, it can be that high values of $\\theta$ can be partly caused by choosing $S$ as an investor. We now show that such endogeneity does not affect the basic results.  \n\nWhen $S$ is not the active investor, we denote the default level of $\\theta$ by $\\theta_{V}$ .We now  assume  that if $S$ becomes an active investor, it can make additional investments to increase $\\theta.\\cal{S}$ privately bears the cost of these investments. They are given by $\\psi(\\theta)$ with $\\psi^{\\prime}(\\theta_{V})>0$ $\\psi^{\\prime\\prime}(\\theta_{V})<0$ for $\\theta>\\theta_{V}$ and $\\psi(\\theta)=0$ and $\\psi^{\\prime}(\\theta)=0$ for $\\theta=\\theta_{V}$ . We denote $S$ 's optimal choice of $\\theta$ by $\\theta_{S}$ , which (using the envelope theorem) is given by $q_{S}(\\theta_{S})=\\psi^{\\prime}(\\theta_{S})$ It immediately follows that $S$ always wants to increase $\\theta$ i.e., $\\theta_{S}>\\theta_{V}$ . The following proposition shows how this affects the equilibrium.  \n\nProposition 8. If $S$ can influence $\\theta$ by becoming an active investor, then the range of parameters in which $E$ chooses pure $S$ financing becomes larger (relative to when $\\theta$ is exogenously fixed).  \n\nThe intuition for this result is that if $S$ is not the active investor, it forgoes the opportunity to influence $\\theta$ to his advantage. This increases his willingness to pay for becoming an active investor. As a consequence, $E$ is also more likely to choose $S$ and the range of pure $S$ -financing increases.  \n\nThis result is also useful for empirical testing. In particular, while the model predicts a positive correlation between $\\theta$ and $S$ -financing, it does not depend on the direction of causality. In equilibrium, the positive correlation can be due both because higher $\\theta$ -firms choose $S$ -financing and because $S$ -financing further increases $\\theta$ . This greatly facilitates empirical testing of the theory since we can test for simple correlations without having to disentangle the direction of causality.  \n\n### 5.5. Entrepreneurial effort  \n\nWhile the investor's support is clearly important for the success of a new venture, it can be argued that the entrepreneur's effort should also have a large, and possibly larger, impact on the likelihood of success. We thus extend the model to allow for double moral hazard, in which both $E$ and $S$ Or $V$ affect the performance of the new venture. In this case, there is a tradeoff between incentives for $E$ versus incentives for the active investor. The most interesting aspect of this model is that the assumption of no ex ante side payments can be relaxed.  \n\nSuppose that $E$ can provide effort $\\sigma_{E}$ at cost ${\\scriptstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\sigma_{E}^{2}$ This affcts the probability of success, now given by $q_{i}=P+p_{E}\\sigma_{E}+p\\sigma_{i}$ $i=S,V$ , where we allow for $p_{E}\\neq p$ ：  \n\nProposition 9. Suppose ex ante transfer payments are feasible, then $\\begin{array}{r}{\\theta_{0}=-\\frac{1}{2}-\\beta}\\end{array}$ and $\\theta_{1}=0$  \n\n(i) If $\\theta>\\theta_{1}$ , then there is pure $S$ -financing. Relative to the frst-best, there is too little suport ie., $\\sigma_{S}<\\sigma_{S}^{*}$ and $\\sigma_{E}<\\sigma_{E}^{*}$   \n(i) If $\\theta_{0}<\\theta<\\theta_{1}$ ,then there is pure $V$ -financing. Relative to the first-best, there is too litlesuport ie. $\\sigma_{V}<\\sigma_{V}^{*}$ and $\\sigma_{E}<\\sigma_{E}^{*}$   \n(ii) If $\\theta<\\theta_{0}$ ,then there is mixed financing, in which $V$ is the active and $S$ is the passive investor. The level of support is first-best, i.e., $\\sigma_{V}=\\sigma_{V}^{*}$ and $\\sigma_{E}=\\sigma_{E}^{*}$  \n\nThe basic intuition is that with a double moral hazard, there is a team problem in which both $E$ and the active investor would invest more efficiently if they had a larger share of the total returns $(1+\\beta+\\theta)$ . In this setting it continues to be true that $S$ is the more effcient investor for $\\theta>0$ , since there are more total incentives to go around between $E$ and $S$ than between $E$ and $V$ (i.e., $1+\\beta+\\theta>1+\\beta)$ . And for $\\theta<0$ , there are more total incentives to go around between $E$ and $V$ than between $E$ and $S$ (i.e., $1+\\beta>1+\\beta+\\theta)$ . In this case $V$ -financing is more efficient. If, however, there is overinvestment under pure $V$ -financing, then $S$ can absorb some equity as a passive investor.  \n\nThe main insight from Proposition 9 is that the basic insights are not affected by entrepreneurial effort, and that with this extension, it is also possible to relax the assumption of no ex ante transfer payments.  \n\n## 6. Conclusion  \n\nWhat is the difference between a strategic and a purely financial venture investor? The venture capital market is not only growing significantly in terms of size and economic importance, it is also witnessing the entry of a large diversity of new investor types, such as corporations, banks, and other established organizations. Identifying the fundamental differences between various types of venture investors is central to an understanding of entrepreneurial finance.  \n\nThis paper provides a theoretical foundation for analyzing the competitive advantages and disadvantages of strategic investors. It explains when entrepreneurs prefer investors that operate in related segments, and when they prefer independent venture capitalists. The analysis generates a large number of testable implications. If the new venture is a complement to the asset of the strategic investor, then the strategic investor is more likely to finance the new venture. If it is a substitute, but poses only a small threat to the strategic investor, then venture capitalist financing is more likely. However, if the venture poses a bigger threat to the strategic investor, the model predicts syndicated finance where the venture capitalist holds board seats and control rights and the strategic investor is relegated to a more passive role. If there are several strategic investors that are all complements, then the strategic investor with the highest complementarities should finance the new venture. If several are substitutes, they may all become passive investors. If the strategic investor is better able to provide support to a venture, then he may finance it even if it is a substitute. But if he is less able, the venture capitalist can finance the venture even if it is a complement. And if the two investors bring different skills to the table, there can be syndicated finance with both types of investors holding boards seats and/or other control rights.  \n\nThe paper also makes some predictions about the relative valuations that a strategic investor and a purely financial investor would offer for a given investment opportunity. If the new venture is a complement and the entrepreneur has a lot of (little) bargaining power, then the strategic investor would pay a higher (lower) valuation. If the new venture is a substitute, then the strategic investor always pays a higher valuation, regardless of bargaining power. Moreover, syndicated financing commands a higher valuation than pure venture capital financing.  \n\nA central insight of the analysis is that the strategic investor's quest for synergies can turn into a competitive disadvantage. The next logical step in this line of research would be to examine how strategic investors can create structures that partially overcome these problems. Future research might want to focus on issues of organizational design and the compensation structure of venture managers. These issues have recently reached a new level of prominence as a large number of companies are actively  looking  for  a comprehensive strategy  for investing  in  entrepreneurial companies. Some companies, like Cisco, favor an approach where the venture capital activity is closely integrated with the core business. Others like Texas Instruments have essentially outsourced all their venture capital investments with minimal organizational control. Further deepening our understanding of the strategic investment process is thus highly relevant from an academic as well as a practical perspective.  \n\n## Appendix A. Proofs  \n\nProof of Propositions $I$ and 2. Consider frst pure $V$ -fnancing. $E$ maximizes $U_{E}^{V}$ subject to $\\begin{array}{r}{U_{V}^{V}=(P_{V}+p_{V}\\sigma_{V})\\alpha_{V}-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_{V}^{2}-I=0}\\end{array}$ and the first order condition $\\sigma_{V}=$ $p_{V}\\alpha_{V}$ . Using $\\alpha_{V}=1$ , we recognize that the project is feasible as long as $I{\\leqslant}P_{V}+\\textstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}p_{V}^{2}$ We can solve for $\\alpha_{V}$ in $U_{V}^{V}=0$ to obtain $\\dot{\\alpha_{V}}=(\\sqrt{P_{V}^{2}+2p_{V}^{2}I}-\\stackrel{\\_}{P}_{V})/p_{V}^{2}$ . It will be useful for later to note that $q_{V}=P_{V}+p_{V}\\sigma_{V}=\\sqrt{P_{V}^{2}+2p_{V}^{2}I}$ ， $U_{S}^{V}=\\underline{{{u}}}_{S}+q_{V}\\theta$ , and $U_{E}^{V}=q_{V}(1+\\beta-\\alpha_{V})$ . Also note that $\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{V}/\\mathrm{d}I>0$ $\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{V}/\\mathrm{d}P_{V}<0$ and $\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{V}/\\mathrm{d}p_{V}<0$  \n\nConsider next pure $S$ -financing. $S$ s outside option is that $V$ -financing goes ahead. $E$ thus chooses $\\alpha_{S}$ to maximizes $U_{E}^{S}$ subject to $U_{S}^{S}=U_{S}^{V}$ ,and subject to the first order  condition $\\sigma_{S}=p_{S}(\\alpha_{S}+\\theta)$ .Solving  for $\\alpha_{S}$ in $U_{S}^{S}=U_{S}^{V}$ we get after transformation $\\alpha_{S}+\\theta=(\\sqrt{P_{S}^{2}+2p_{S}^{2}(I+\\theta q_{V})}-P_{S})/p_{S}^{2}$ .It follows that $\\sigma_{S}=$ $p_{S}(\\alpha_{S}+\\theta)$ is an increasing function of $\\theta$ . Obviously, $\\sigma_{V}=p_{V}\\alpha_{V}$ is independent of $\\theta$ . Moreover, for $P_{S}=P_{V}$ and $p_{S}=p_{V}$ , we have $\\sigma_{S}=\\sigma_{V}$ at $\\theta=0$  \n\nConsider also mixed financing in which $V$ is the active investor. Let $I=I_{S}^{M}+I_{V}^{M}$ $E$ chooses $\\alpha_{V}^{M},\\alpha_{S}^{M},I_{S}^{M}$ and $I_{V}^{M}$ to maximizes $U_{E}^{V}$ subject to $U_{V}^{M}=0$ and $U_{S}^{M}=U_{S}^{V}$ and  subject  to the  first-order condition $\\sigma_{V}=p_{V}\\alpha_{S}^{M}$ .Since the contract that maximizes $U_{E}$ also maximizes $W$ , it is immediate that mixed financing is better than $V$ financing whenever $\\sigma_{V}>\\sigma_{V}^{*}\\Leftrightarrow\\alpha_{V}>1+\\beta+\\theta$ .We have $\\theta_{0}=\\alpha_{V}-1-\\beta$ Using this and the comparative statics of $\\alpha_{V}$ ,  we  immediately recognize $\\mathrm{d}\\theta_{0}/\\mathrm{d}\\beta<0$ $\\mathrm{d}\\theta_{0}/\\mathrm{d}I>0$ $\\mathrm{d}\\theta_{0}/\\mathrm{d}p_{S}=\\mathrm{d}\\theta_{0}/\\mathrm{d}P_{S}=0$ $\\mathrm{d}\\theta_{0}/\\mathrm{d}p_{V}<0$ , and $\\mathrm{d}\\theta_{0}/\\mathrm{d}P_{V}<0$  \n\nTo see that $E$ prefers $S$ financing over $V$ -financing for $\\theta>\\theta_{1}=0$ , simply note that for $\\sigma<\\sigma^{*}$ ， $W$ is an increasing function of $\\sigma$ .For $\\theta>\\theta_{1}$ , we have $\\sigma^{*}>\\sigma_{S}>\\sigma_{V}$ and for $\\theta_{0}<\\theta<\\theta_{1}$ , we have $\\sigma^{*}>\\sigma_{V}>\\sigma_{S}$ . Increases in $\\beta$ or $I$ do not affect the fact that $\\sigma_{S}=\\sigma_{V}$ at $\\theta=0$ . However, an increase in $P_{S}$ or $p_{S}$ implies $\\sigma_{S}>\\sigma_{V}$ for $\\theta=0$ . It follows that $\\theta_{1}<0$ . Note also that $\\theta_{1}<\\widetilde{\\theta}$ , where $\\sigma_{S}(\\widetilde{\\theta})=\\sigma_{V}$ , since switching to $V$ now also implies an efficiency loss, i.e., $W_{S}(\\sigma_{S}(\\tilde{\\theta}))>W_{V}(\\sigma_{V})$ . Similarly, an increase in $p_{V}$ or $P_{V}$ implies $\\sigma_{V}>\\sigma_{S}$ for $\\theta=0$ , so that $\\theta_{1}>0$ . Moreover, $\\theta_{1}>\\tilde{\\theta}$ , since switching to $V$ now also implies an efficiency gain.  \n\nIt is now also easy to see that it is never optimal to have $S$ as the active investor and $V$ as a passive investor. This is simply because the level of support with this inverted type of mixed financing always lies below $\\sigma_{S}$ , which itself lies below the efficient level $\\sigma_{S}^{*}$  \n\nThe proof uses the property that the contract that maximizes $U_{E}$ , subject to $U_{V}=\\underline{{{U}}}_{V}=0$ and $U_{S}=\\underline{{{U}}}_{S}=U_{S}^{V}$ , also maximizes $W=U_{E}+U_{V}+U_{S}$ , subject to the same constraints. This requires that all participation constraints are binding. We need to check that $E$ would never give any investor any additional equity, to improve incentives. Consider $U_{E}^{V}=(P_{V}+p_{V}^{2}\\alpha_{V})(1+\\beta-\\alpha_{V})$ , so that $\\mathrm{d}U_{E}^{V}/\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{V}=p_{V}^{2}(1+$ $\\beta)-P_{V}-2p_{V}^{2}\\alpha_{V}$ . This is always negative for $P_{V}>p_{V}^{2}(1+\\beta)$ Similarly, consider $U_{E}^{S}=(P_{S}+p_{S}^{2}(\\alpha_{S}+\\theta))(1+\\beta-\\alpha_{S}),$ \"sothat $\\mathrm{d}U_{E}^{S}/\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{S}=p_{S}^{2}(1+\\beta-\\theta)-P_{S}-$ $2p_{S}^{2}\\alpha_{S}$ , which is always negative for $P_{S}>p_{S}^{2}(1+\\beta-\\bar{\\theta})$  \n\nProof of Proposition 3. We begin with the comparative statics. It is immediate to see that $\\mathrm{d}\\mathsf{\\alpha}_{\\mathrm{d}}/\\mathrm{d}P_{i}<0$ and $\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{i}/\\mathrm{d}p_{i}<0,i=S,V$ so that ${\\cal T}_{i}=I/\\alpha_{i}$ increasing in $P_{i}$ and $p_{i}$ To see  how $\\underline{{\\boldsymbol{{T}}_{S}}}$ depends  on $\\theta$ ， rewrite $\\alpha_{S}=-\\theta-P/p_{S}^{2}+\\xi/p_{S}^{2}$ where $\\xi=$ $\\sqrt{P_{S}^{2}+2p_{S}^{2}(I+\\theta q_{V})}$ . Consider $\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{S}/\\mathrm{d}\\theta\\:=\\:-1+(1/p_{S}^{2})(1/2\\xi)2p_{S}^{2}q_{V}=q_{V}/\\xi-1$ .But so that  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}&{}&{\\lor^{\\textbf{J}^{\\bot}S}\\lor^{\\bot}\\ X^{\\bot}P S^{\\bot}\\lor^{\\bot}\\ X^{\\cup}V^{\\bot}\\lor^{\\bot}\\ X^{\\cup}S^{\\bot}\\lor^{\\bot}\\ X^{\\cup}V^{\\bot}}\\ &{}&{q_{V}>\\xi\\Leftrightarrow P_{V}^{2}+2p_{V}^{2}I>P_{S}^{2}+2p_{S}^{2}(I+\\theta\\sqrt{P_{V}^{2}+2I p_{V}^{2}})}\\ &{}&{\\quad\\quad\\displaystyle\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{S}}{\\mathrm{d}\\theta}>0\\Leftrightarrow\\theta<\\frac{P_{V}^{2}-P_{S}^{2}+2I(p_{V}^{2}-2p_{S}^{2})}{2p_{S}^{2}\\sqrt{P_{V}^{2}+2I p_{V}^{2}}}\\equiv\\theta_{Y}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nNext, compare $T_{V}$ and $T_{S}$ at $P_{S}=P_{V}=P$ and $p_{S}=p_{V}=p$ We claim that for $\\theta\\neq0$ we  have $\\nonumber T_{S}>T_{V}\\Leftrightarrow\\alpha_{S}<\\alpha_{V}\\Leftrightarrow-\\theta+(\\sqrt{P^{2}+2p^{2}(I+\\theta q_{V})}-P)/p^{2}<(q_{V}-P)/p^{2}\\nonumber$ After transformations we obtain $P^{2}+2p^{2}I<q_{V}^{2}+(p^{2}\\theta)^{2}$ ，and using $q_{V}^{2}=P^{2}+$ $2p^{2}I$ we obtain $P^{2}+2p^{2}I<P^{2}+2p^{2}I+(p^{2}\\theta)^{2}\\Leftrightarrow0<(p^{2}\\theta)^{2}.$ This implies $T_{S}>T_{V}$ for $\\theta\\neq0$  \n\nTo see that $\\displaystyle{T_{V}<T_{M}=I/(\\alpha_{S}^{M}+\\alpha_{V}^{M})}$ , consider $\\alpha_{V}$ from pure $V$ -financing, and suppose that $\\alpha_{S}^{M}+\\alpha_{V}^{M}=\\alpha_{V}$ We ill show that $S$ isbetterffwithispariar contract, i.e.,. $U_{S}^{M}>U_{S}^{V}$ To see this, use $\\alpha_{V}^{M}=(1+\\beta+\\theta)$ to obtain  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{U_{S}^{M}-U_{S}^{V}=(P_{V}+p_{V}^{2}(1+\\beta+\\theta))(\\alpha_{V}-(1+\\beta+\\theta))-(I-I_{V})}\\ &{\\qquad+~[(P_{V}+p_{V}^{2}(1+\\beta+\\theta))-(P_{V}+p_{V}^{2}\\alpha_{V})]\\theta.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFrom $U_{V}^{M}=0$ we obtain $\\scriptscriptstyle1I_{V}=P_{V}\\alpha_{V}^{M}+(p_{V}^{2}/2)(\\alpha_{V}^{M})^{2}=P_{V}(1+\\beta+\\theta)+(p_{V}^{2}/2)(1+$ $\\beta+\\theta)^{2}$ so that $(I-I_{V})=P_{V}\\alpha_{V}+(p_{V}^{2}/2)\\alpha_{V}^{2}-P_{V}(1+\\beta+\\theta)-(p_{V}^{2}/2)(1+\\beta+\\theta)^{2}.$ After some transformations, the first two terms of $U_{S}^{M}-U_{S}^{V}$ are thus given by $-(p_{V}^{2}/2)((1+\\beta+\\theta)-\\alpha_{V})^{2}<0$ .This says that when $S$ takes a passive stake, it becomes less valuable than under pure $V$ -financing. This is because $V$ now provides less support. But $S$ also gets a utility from the lower support, as measured by the third  term,  which  simplifies  to $p_{V}^{2}((1+\\beta+\\theta)-\\alpha_{V})\\theta>0$ Putting these terms together, we obtain $\\begin{array}{r}{U_{S}^{M}-U_{S}^{V}=\\frac{1}{2}p_{V}^{2}(\\alpha_{V}-(1+\\beta+\\theta))[(1+\\beta+\\theta)-\\alpha_{V}-2\\theta].}\\end{array}$ Take $\\theta_{0}$ where $\\sigma^{*}=\\sigma_{V}$ At $\\theta_{0}$ , we have $(1+\\beta+\\theta_{0})=\\alpha_{V}$ , so that $U_{S}^{M}-U_{S}^{V}=0$ . For all $\\theta<\\theta_{0}$ we  have $1+\\beta+\\theta=1+\\beta+\\theta_{0}-(\\theta_{0}-\\theta)=\\alpha_{V}-(\\theta^{*}-\\theta)$ so that $U_{S}^{M}-$ $\\begin{array}{r}{U_{S}^{V}=\\frac{1}{2}p_{V}^{2}(\\theta^{*}-\\theta)[-\\theta^{*}-\\theta0}\\end{array}$ ,which thus proves $U_{S}^{M}>U_{S}^{V}$ This says that the particular offer we considered is too generous to $S$ . In equilibrium, $E$ thus offer $S$ less equity, i.e.,. $\\alpha_{S}^{M}<\\alpha_{V}-\\alpha_{V}^{M}\\Leftrightarrow\\alpha_{V}^{M}+\\alpha_{S}^{M}<\\alpha_{V}$ , so that $T_{V}<T_{M}$  \n\nProofofProposition4.Consider $U_{E}^{S}=(P_{S}+p_{S}^{2}(\\alpha_{S}+\\theta))(1+\\beta-\\alpha_{S})$ Using $\\alpha_{S}=$ $-\\theta-P/p_{S}^{2}+\\xi/p_{S}^{2}$ Where $\\underline{{\\xi}}=\\sqrt{P_{S}^{2}+2p_{S}^{2}(I+\\theta q_{V})}$ wehave $\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{S}/\\mathrm{d}\\theta=$ √P + 2p1/  P + 2p’(I + 0qv) - 1 = qv/qs - 1 and thus  \n\nWith equal abilities, we have $q_{S}>q_{V}$ for $\\theta>\\theta_{1}=0$ ,and thus $\\mathrm{d}U_{E}^{S}/\\mathrm{d}\\theta>0$ . For $\\theta_{0}<\\theta<\\theta_{1}$ , we have $U_{E}^{S}=(P_{V}+p_{V}^{2}(\\alpha_{V})(1+\\beta-\\alpha_{V})$ which is independent of $\\theta$ . And to see that $U_{E}(\\theta)$ is decreasing for $\\theta<\\theta_{0}$ , note from $W_{M}=U_{E}^{M}+U_{V}^{M}+U_{S}^{M}$ and $\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\overset{M}{,}=0,\\mathrm{that}\\quad U_{E}(\\theta)=W_{M}-U_{S}^{M}.\\mathrm{Using}\\quad U_{S}^{M}=U_{S}^{V}=u_{S}+\\theta\\sqrt{P^{2}+2I p_{V}^{2}}\\quad\\mathrm{an}}\\ &{Y_{M}=(P_{V}+p_{V}^{2}(1+\\beta+\\theta))(1+\\beta+\\theta)-p_{V}^{2}(1+\\beta+\\theta)^{2}/2+\\ u_{S}-I,\\quad\\mathrm{we}\\quad\\mathrm{obtai}}\\ &{\\overset{c}{E}(\\theta)=P_{V}(1+\\beta+\\theta)+p_{V}^{2}(1+\\beta+\\theta)^{2}/2+u_{S}-I-\\theta\\sqrt{P_{V}^{2}+2I p_{V}^{2}}\\quad\\mathrm{and}\\quad\\mathrm{thul}}\\ &{U_{E}/\\mathrm{d}\\theta=P_{V}+p_{V}^{2}(1+\\beta+\\theta)-\\sqrt{P_{V}^{2}+2I p_{V}^{2}}\\quad\\mathrm{Using}\\quad\\sigma_{V}>\\sigma_{V}^{*}\\Leftrightarrow-P_{V}/p_{V}^{2}.}\\ &{P_{V}^{2}+2I p_{V}^{2}/p_{V}^{2}>(1+\\beta+\\theta)\\Leftrightarrow\\sqrt{P_{V}^{2}+2I p_{V}^{2}}>P_{V}+p_{V}^{2}(1+\\beta+\\theta),\\mathrm{we}\\quad\\operatorname*{get}\\mathrm{d}U_{E}}\\end{array}$ d n U S d $\\mathrm{d}\\theta<0$ for $\\sigma_{V}>\\sigma_{V}^{*}$ . When mixed financing is optimal, $U_{E}(\\theta)$ is thus decreasing in $\\theta$  \n\nTo see that $U_{E}(\\theta)$ increasing in $p_{V}$ and $P_{V}$ for $\\theta<\\theta_{1}$ , consider first $\\theta<\\theta_{0}$ . In this case, $\\mathrm{d}U_{E}/\\mathrm{d}P_{V}=(1+\\beta+\\theta)-\\theta P_{V}/\\sqrt{P_{V}^{2}+2I p_{V}^{2}}>0$ and $\\mathrm{d}U_{E}/\\mathrm{d}p_{V}=p_{V}(1+\\beta+$ $\\theta)^{2}-\\theta2I p_{V}/\\sqrt{P_{V}^{2}+2I p_{V}^{2}}>0$ , where we use $\\theta_{0}<-\\beta<0$ For $\\theta_{0}<\\theta<\\theta_{1}$ ，， $U_{E}(\\theta)=$ $U_{E}^{V}(\\theta)=({P_{V}}^{\\l}+{p_{V}^{2}}{\\alpha_{V}})(1+\\beta-{\\alpha_{V}})$ sothat $\\mathrm{d}U_{E}(\\theta)/\\mathrm{d}p_{V}=(\\mathrm{d}U_{E}(\\theta)/\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{V})(\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{V}/$ $\\mathrm{d}p_{V})+2p_{V}\\alpha_{V}(1+\\beta-\\alpha_{V})>0$ since $\\mathrm{d}U_{E}(\\theta)/\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{V}<0$ and $\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{V}/\\mathrm{d}p_{V}<0$ .Similarly, $\\mathrm{d}U_{E}(\\theta)/\\mathrm{d}P_{V}=(\\mathrm{d}U_{E}(\\theta)/\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{V})(\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{V}/\\mathrm{d}P_{V})+\\alpha_{V}(1+\\beta-\\alpha_{V})>0$ . since $\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{V}/\\mathrm{d}P_{V}$ $<0$ .Finally, for $\\theta>\\theta_{1}$ , we have $U_{E}(\\theta)=U_{E}^{S}(\\theta)=(P_{S}+p_{S}^{2}\\alpha_{S})(1+\\beta-\\alpha_{S})$ and $\\mathrm{d}U_{E}(\\theta)/\\mathrm{d}p_{S}=(\\mathrm{d}U_{E}(\\theta)/\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{S})(\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{S}/\\mathrm{d}p_{S})+2p_{S}\\alpha_{S}(1+\\beta-\\alpha_{S})>0$ since $\\mathrm{d}U_{E}(\\theta)/$ $\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{S}<0$ and $\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{S}/\\mathrm{d}p_{S}<0$ Similarly, $\\mathrm{d}U_{E}(\\theta)/\\mathrm{d}P_{S}=(\\mathrm{d}U_{E}(\\theta)/\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{S})(\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{S}/\\mathrm{d}P_{S})+\\alpha_{S}(1+$ $\\beta-\\alpha_{S})>0$ since $\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{S}/\\mathrm{d}P_{S}<0$  \n\nProof of Proposition 5. Suppose now that $S$ can make a take-it-or-leave-it offer to $V$ If $E$ rejects this offer, she simply obtains a competitive bid for pure $V$ -financing. As before, we denote this bid by $\\underset{-V}{\\underbrace{\\alpha_{-V}^{V}}}$ It satisfies $U_{V}^{V}(\\underline{{{\\alpha}}}_{V}^{V})=0$ , and we denote $E$ 's resulting utility by $U_{E}^{V}(\\underline{{\\alpha}}_{V}^{V})\\equiv\\underline{{U}}_{E}$ $S$ 's bid, denoted by $\\pmb{\\alpha}_{S}^{i}$ , satisfies $U_{E}^{i}(\\alpha_{S}^{i})=\\underline{{{U}}}_{E}$ . Note that we can think of the case in which $S$ makes no bid a special case in which $S$ proposes $\\alpha_{S}^{V}=0,\\alpha_{V}^{V}=\\alpha_{V}^{V}$ . S's optimal offer thus maximizes $U_{S}=\\mathbf{M}\\mathrm{ax}[U_{S}^{S},U_{S}^{V}]$ subject to $U_{E}^{i}=\\underline{{U}}_{E}$ and $U_{V}^{i}=0,i=S,V.$ Maximizing $U_{S}^{i}$ is thenquivalent tomaximizing $\\begin{array}{r}{U_{S}^{i}+U_{V}+U_{E}=U_{S}^{i}+U_{V}^{i}+U_{E}^{i}=W_{i},}\\end{array}$ so that $S$ 's optimal offer always maximizes $W=\\mathbf{M}\\mathrm{ax}[W_{S},W_{V}]$ . This maximization problem is very similar to before.  \n\nFor part (i), we need to show that $q_{S}$ is again an increasing function of $\\theta$ . To see this, differentiate $U_{E}^{S}(\\alpha_{S}^{S},\\theta)=\\underline{{U}}_{E}$ to get $(\\partial^{\\aa}U_{E}^{S}/\\partial\\alpha_{S}^{S})\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{S}^{S}+(\\bar{\\partial}U_{E}^{S}/\\partial\\theta)\\mathrm{d}\\theta=0$ . Using $(\\partial U_{E}^{S}/\\partial\\alpha_{S}^{S})=p_{S}^{2}(1+\\beta-\\alpha_{S}^{S})-[P_{S}+p_{S}^{2}(\\alpha_{S}^{S}+\\theta)]<0$ (since $P_{S}>(1+\\beta-\\theta)p_{S}^{2})$ and $(\\partial U_{E}^{S}/\\partial\\theta)=p_{S}^{2}(1+\\beta-\\alpha_{S}^{S})>0$ we  get $\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{S}^{S}/\\mathrm{d}\\theta=-p_{S}^{2}(1+\\beta-\\alpha_{S}^{S})/(P_{S}+p_{S}^{2}(\\alpha_{S}^{S}+$ $\\theta)-p_{S}^{2}(1+\\beta-\\alpha_{S}^{S}))>0$ $\\alpha_{S}^{S}$ is thus an increasing function of $\\theta$ With $q_{S}=P_{S}+$ $p_{S}(\\alpha_{S}^{S}+\\theta)$ , it follows that $q_{S}$ is also an increasing function of $\\theta$ .At $\\theta=0$ we naturally have $q_{S}=q_{V}$ . Since the optimal offer again maximizes the joint surplus $W$ ，the remainder of the analysis is analogous to the proof of Propositions 1 and 2.  \n\nFor _part (i), we simply use $\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{S}^{S}/\\mathrm{d}\\theta>0$ tonotethat $\\mathrm{d}{\\cal F}_{S}/\\mathrm{d}\\theta=$ $-(I/(\\alpha_{S}^{S})^{\\hat{2}})(\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{S}^{S}/\\mathrm{d}\\theta)<0$ . Moreover, at $\\theta=0$ ,wehave $\\alpha_{S}^{S}=\\underline{{{\\alpha}}}_{V}^{V}$ ,so that $T_{S}={\\cal{I}}_{V}$  \n\nFor part (i) we simply note that the condition $U_{E}^{i}(\\alpha_{S}^{i})=\\underline{{{U}}}_{E}$ is binding for all values of $\\theta$ and that $U_{E}$ is independent of $\\theta$  \n\nTo see that $U_{E}(\\theta)$ is independent of $\\theta$ only in the extreme case in which $E$ has no bargaining power, we examine the generalized Nash bargaining solution. In this case, $E$ and $S$ maximize $W$ , subject to their outside options, given by $U_{E}^{V}(\\underline{{{\\alpha}}}_{V}^{V})=\\underline{{{U}}}_{E}$ and $U_{S}^{V}(\\underline{{{\\alpha}}}_{V}^{V})=U_{S}(\\theta)$ . Let $\\tilde{W}(\\theta)=W(\\theta)-U_{E}-U_{S}(\\theta)$ be the net surplus, and $\\tau_{E}$ be $E$ 's bargaining strength, then $U_{E}(\\theta)=U_{E}+\\tau_{E}\\tilde{W}(\\theta)=(1-\\tau_{E})U_{E}+\\tau_{E}[W(\\theta)-$ $\\underline{{U}}_{S}(\\theta)]$ . Clearly, $U_{E}$ is independent of $\\theta$ only for $\\tau_{E}=0$ . Moreover, for $\\tau_{E}=1$ ,we have $U_{E}(\\theta)=W(\\theta)-\\underline{{U}}_{S}(\\theta)$ ，so that $W(\\theta)-\\underline{{U}}_{S}(\\theta)$ has the same shape as in Proposition 4 (Fig. 7). Its slope is given by $\\mathrm{d}U_{E}(1)/\\mathrm{d}\\theta=\\mathrm{d}W(\\theta)/\\mathrm{d}\\theta-\\mathrm{d}\\underline{{U}}_{S}(\\theta)/\\mathrm{d}\\theta.$ It follows that $U_{E}(\\theta)=(1-\\tau_{E}){\\cal{U}}_{E}+\\tau_{E}[W(\\theta)-U_{S}(\\theta)]$ also has the same shape, except that the slopes of $U_{E}(\\theta)$ are reduced by a factor $\\tau_{E}$ ,i.e., $\\mathrm{d}U_{E}(\\tau_{E})/\\mathrm{d}\\theta=$ $\\tau_{E}(\\mathrm{d}W(\\theta)/\\mathrm{d}\\theta-\\mathrm{d}U_{S}(\\theta)/\\mathrm{d}\\theta)=\\tau_{E}\\mathrm{d}U_{E}(1)/\\mathrm{d}\\theta$  \n\nWe will now discuss the importance of offer sequence. Our model so far assumes that $E$ approaches $S$ before approaching the market of V's. Consider now a more general model in which $E$ can make offers in any sequence. We also assume that there is no last date, i.e., it is never too late to make another offer. Suppose that $E$ always makes the offers that we derived in the base model. Every $V$ will always accept an offer $\\underline{{{\\boldsymbol{\\upalpha}}}}_{V}^{V}$ since $E$ will never make any better offer. Similarly, $S$ will always accept the equilibrium offers $\\alpha_{S}^{i},i=S,V$ , that we derived for the base model. $S$ knows that $E$ can always get pure $V$ -financing, and knows that $E$ will never want to make a better offer either. In this model it does not matter whether $E$ approaches $S$ first. Indeed, for pure $V$ -financing $E$ may as well approach $V$ directly, since she will not make an acceptable offer to $S$ anyway.  \n\nAs long as $E$ is making the offers, it is easiest to assume that $E$ makes one offer at a time. This way there is no problem that several investors might want to accept different contracts at the same time. If investors are making the offers, and offers can be made at any time, then there can also be simultaneous offers. In any period, $E$ can either chose to accept one offer or none. Consider the model in which the investors can make offers at any time and in which it is never too late to make further offers. All the V's are willing to make competitive bids $\\underline{{{\\boldsymbol{\\mathfrak{X}}}}}_{V}^{V}$ at any time. And $S$ is willing to make the same bid as in Proposition 5 at any date too. The results from Proposition 5 thus continue to hold, and the exact order of bids does not matter.  \n\nConsider next final period effects. If investors make the offers, then it is easy to see the model is as before. This is because all the investors are always willing to make the above bids even on the final period. We therefore focus on the case in which $E$ makes the offers. $V$ behaves just as before in the last period. But $S$ has a different outside option, since refusing the offer now terminates the venture. This changes S's reservation utility from $\\underline{{U}}_{S}=\\underline{{u}}_{S}+q_{V}\\theta$ to ${\\underline{{U}}}_{S}={\\underline{{u}}}_{S}$ .For $\\theta>0$ ， $S$ 's reservation utility is now lower, so that $E$ can extract a higher valuation than before. Disregarding any costs of delay, $E$ would thus actually wait for the last period. This yields a higher equilibrium valuation, given by $T=I/\\alpha_{S}$ ,where $\\alpha_{S}$ satisfies $\\begin{array}{r}{P_{S}(\\alpha_{S}+\\theta)+\\frac{1}{2}p_{S}(\\alpha_{S}+}\\end{array}$ $\\bar{\\theta)^{2}}=I_{S}$  \n\nFor $\\theta<0$ ， $S$ s reservation utility is now higher. In the last period, $E$ will always choose pure $V$ -financing, rather than syndicated finance. To see this, consider $\\alpha_{V}$ from pure $V$ -financing, and consider mixed financing at the same valuation, i.e., $\\alpha_{S}^{M}+\\alpha_{V}^{M}=\\alpha_{V}$ In the proof of Proposition 3, we showed that $S$ would be better off with mixed financing at the same valuation. With an altered outside option, however, we will now show that $S$ is worse off. We have $U_{S}^{M}=(P_{V}+p_{V}^{2}(\\bar{\\alpha}_{V}-\\alpha_{S}^{M}))(\\alpha_{S}^{M}+$ $\\theta)-(I-I_{V})$ From $U_{V}^{M}=0$ we obtain $I_{V}=P_{V}\\alpha_{V}^{\\tilde{M}}+p^{2}\\alpha_{V}^{M}/2$ so that $(I-I_{V})=$ $P_{V}\\alpha_{V}+(p_{V}^{2}/2)\\alpha_{V}^{2}-P_{V}(\\alpha_{V}-\\alpha_{S}^{M})-(p_{V}^{2}/2)(\\alpha_{V}-\\alpha_{S}^{M})^{2}$ After transformations we obtain $U_{S}^{M}=\\underline{{u}}_{S}+(P_{V}+p_{V}^{2}(\\alpha_{V}-\\alpha_{S}^{M}))\\theta-(p_{V}^{2}/2)(\\alpha_{S}^{M})^{2}<\\underline{{u}}_{S}$ .This says that $S$ is worse off. To have mixed financing, $E$ would have to give up proportionally more equity, i.e.,. $\\alpha_{S}^{M}>\\alpha_{V}-\\alpha_{S}^{M}$ . But this means that mixed financing makes $E$ worse off on two counts: lower support from $V$ and greater ownership dilution. In the last period, $E$ would thus prefer pure $V$ -financing. Prior to the last period, however, $E$ can still approach $S$ . S's outside option is then given by what would happen in the last period, namely pure $V$ -financing. $E$ can thus propose the same mixed finance contract as before, and we are back to the base model. The equilibrium for $\\theta<0$ is thus the same as in the base model, even if there is a last period in the game.  \n\nThese results show that if either the entrepreneur, or the investors, make all offers, the actual sequencing of offers does not matter very much, except for final period effects. Obviously, one could further complicate the game structure, such as by having $E$ $V$ and $S$ all make offers at different times. Recent work by Hart and MasColell (1996), Hellmann (2000), and Marx and Shaffer (2000) suggests that the sequencing of offers might affect the distribution of bargaining power in such multiparty games. More complex offer structures might thus influence the valuation, although our previous analysis also suggests that it need not affect the overall contractingstructure.  \n\nProof of Proposition 6. Suppose that $E$ can make a take-it-or-leave-it to any subset of $\\{S_{\\mathrm{H}},S_{\\mathrm{L}},V\\}$ , and if the offer is rejected, $E$ seeks funding from some other V's. The proof is then a direct extension of Proposition 1. Suppose here that $\\theta_{H}>0$ . The proof with $\\theta_{H}<0$ is analogous, except that we replace $S_{H}$ with $V$ , which implicitly has $\\theta=0$ . Using Proposition 1, $S_{H}$ is preferred to $V$ . If $\\theta_{L}>0$ , we can see from Proposition 4 that $S_{H}$ is preferred to $S_{L}$ because $U_{E}^{S}$ is increasing in $\\theta$ . This continues to be true for $0>\\theta_{L}>\\hat{\\theta}$ , where we still have $\\sigma_{S H}<\\sigma^{*}$ . For ${\\theta_{L}}\\mathrm{{<}}\\hat{\\theta}$ , however, we get $\\sigma_{S H}>\\sigma^{*}=p(1+\\beta+\\theta_{H}+\\theta_{L})$ . We only need to verify that $\\sigma^{*}=p(1+\\beta+\\theta_{H}+\\theta_{L})$ is the relevant threshold for mixed financing when $S_{H}$ is active and $S_{H}$ is passive. Consider αMH so that $S_{H}$ is indifferent etween $U_{S H}^{M}$ and $U_{S H}^{V}$ ,i.e, $P(\\alpha_{S H}^{M}+$ $\\theta_{H})+p^{2}(\\alpha_{S H}^{M}+\\theta_{H})^{2}/2-I_{S H}=\\theta_{H}q_{V},$ . where $q_{V}=\\sqrt{P^{2}+2I p^{2}}$ . Solving the quadratic  equation   we  have $\\alpha_{S H}^{M}+\\theta_{H}=-P/p^{2}+q_{S H}/p^{2}$ ，where $q_{S H}=$ $\\sqrt{P^{2}+2p^{2}(I_{S H}+\\theta_{H}q_{V})}$ : Consider next $\\pmb{\\alpha}_{S L}^{M}$ and $I_{S L}=I-I_{S H}$ so that $S_{L}$ ${U}_{S L}^{M}$ $U_{S L}^{V}$ $q_{S H}(\\alpha_{S L}^{M}+\\theta_{L})-I_{S L}=q_{V}\\theta_{L}$ $\\alpha_{S L}^{M}+\\theta_{L}=(q_{V}\\theta_{L}+I_{S L})/q_{S H}$ $U_{E}^{\\tilde{\\cal M}}=(P+p^{2}(\\alpha_{S H}^{M}+\\theta_{H}))(1+\\beta-$ $\\alpha_{S H}^{M}-\\alpha_{S I}^{M})=q_{S H}(1+\\beta+\\theta_{H}+\\theta_{L})+q_{S H}P/p^{2}-q_{S H}^{2}/p^{L}-q_{V}\\theta_{L}-I_{S L}$ OWe have $\\mathrm{d}U_{E}^{M}/\\mathrm{d}I_{S L}=-1+(\\mathrm{d}U_{E}^{M}/\\mathrm{d}q_{S})(\\mathrm{d}q_{S H}/\\mathrm{d}I_{S L})=1-(p^{2}/q_{S H})(1+\\beta+\\theta_{H}+\\theta_{H}),$ L)-P/ $q_{S H}$ , so that $\\mathrm{d}U_{E}^{M}/\\mathrm{d}I_{S L}>0$ if $q_{S H}>P+p^{2}(1+\\beta+\\theta_{H}+\\theta_{L})$ or $\\sigma_{S H}>p(1+\\beta+\\$ $\\theta_{H}+\\theta_{L})=\\sigma^{*}$ . Thus $\\sigma^{*}$ is the relevant threshold.  \n\nTo complete the proof, we need to examine whether $S_{L}$ and $S_{H}$ are both used as a passiv investors.Consider $\\alpha_{V}^{M}$ so that $U_{V}^{M}=U_{V}^{V}=0$ ie, $P\\alpha_{V}^{M}+p^{2}\\alpha_{V}^{M}/2-I_{V}=0$ $\\alpha_{V}^{M}=-P/p^{2}+q_{V}^{M}/p^{2}$ $q_{V}^{M}=$ P2 + 2p-Iy.Considernext asy $I_{S L}$ $S_{L}$ ${U}_{S L}^{M}$ and $U_{S L}^{V}$ We have $(P+p^{2}\\alpha_{V}^{M})(\\alpha_{S L}^{M}+\\theta_{L})-I_{S L}=q_{V}\\theta_{L}$ so that fte transformation $(\\alpha_{S L}^{M}+\\theta_{L})=(q_{V}\\theta_{L}+I_{S L})/q_{V}^{M}$ $(\\alpha_{S H}^{M}+\\theta_{H})=(q_{V}\\theta_{H}+I_{S H})/q_{V}^{M}$ Weuse $U_{E}^{M}=(P+p^{2}\\alpha_{V}^{M})(1+\\beta-\\alpha_{V}^{M}-\\alpha_{S H}^{M}-\\alpha_{S L}^{M})=q_{V}^{M}(1+\\beta+\\theta_{H}+\\theta_{L})+$ $q_{\\scriptscriptstyle V}^{\\cal M}P/p^{2}-q_{\\scriptscriptstyle V}^{\\cal M}/p^{2}-q_{\\scriptscriptstyle V}\\theta_{\\scriptscriptstyle L}-I_{S L}-q_{\\scriptscriptstyle V}\\theta_{\\cal H}-I_{S H}$ $\\mathrm{d}U_{E}^{M}/\\mathrm{d}I_{S L}=-1+$ $\\mathrm{d}U_{E}^{M}/\\mathrm{d}q_{V}^{M})(\\mathrm{d}q_{V}^{M}/\\mathrm{d}I_{S L})=1-(p^{2}/q_{V}^{M})(1+\\beta+\\theta_{H}+\\theta_{L})-P/q_{V}^{M}$ ，0 SO that $\\mathrm{d}U_{E}^{M}/\\mathrm{d}I_{S L}>0$ $q_{\\scriptscriptstyle V}^{M}>P+p^{2}(1+\\beta+\\theta_{\\scriptscriptstyle H}+\\theta_{\\scriptscriptstyle L})$ $\\sigma_{V}^{M}>(1+\\beta+\\theta_{H}+\\theta_{L})$ And similarly, $\\mathrm{d}U_{E}^{M}/\\mathrm{d}I_{S H}>0$ whenever $\\sigma_{V}^{M}>p(1+\\beta+\\theta_{H}+\\theta_{L})=\\sigma^{*}$ . It follows that increasing $I_{S L}$ and $I_{S H}$ is beneficial whenever $\\sigma_{V}^{M}>\\sigma^{*}$ , so that both $S_{H}$ and $S_{L}$ can become passive investors.  \n\nProof of Proposition 7. $E$ will chooses $\\propto_{V},\\propto_{S},I_{V},I_{S}$ to maximize $W=q(1+\\beta+$ $\\theta)-\\sigma_{V}^{2}/2-\\sigma_{S}^{2}/2-I$ subject to the participation constraints $U_{S}^{M}=U_{S}^{V}$ and $U_{V}^{M}=$ $U_{V}^{V}=0$ . We use the subscript $J$ for joint finance (instead of $M$ for mixed finance) to emphasize that both investors are active. The first order conditions are now given by Eqs. (6) and (7) simultaneously. Let $q=(P+p^{2}\\alpha_{V}+p^{2}(\\alpha_{S}+\\theta))$ , then $E$ maximizes $W=q(1+\\beta+\\theta)-p^{2}\\alpha_{V}^{2}/2-p^{2}(\\alpha_{S}+\\theta)^{2}/2-I$ subject to $q\\alpha_{V}-p_{V}^{2}\\alpha_{V}^{2}/2-I_{V}=0$ and $q(\\alpha_{S}+\\theta)-p^{2}(\\alpha_{S}+\\theta)^{2}/2-(I-I_{V})-\\theta\\sqrt{P^{2}+2I p^{2}}=0$ , as well as the inequality constraints $I_{V}\\geqslant0$ and $I_{V}\\leqslant I$ We associate $\\lambda_{V}$ to first and $\\lambda_{S}$ to second constraint. Increasing the  Lagrangian with  respect to $I_{V}$ ， we have $\\lambda_{V}=\\lambda_{S}=\\lambda$ ，unless the inequality constraints are binding, which only occurs for $|\\theta|$ sufficiently large. Consider an increase in $\\alpha_{V}$ , then $\\mathrm{d}W/\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{V}=p^{2}(1+\\beta+\\theta)-p^{2}\\alpha_{V}+\\lambda[P+p^{2}\\alpha_{V}+$ $p^{2}(\\alpha_{S}+\\theta)]=0$ and $\\mathrm{d}W/\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{S}=p^{2}(1+\\beta+\\theta)-p^{2}(\\alpha_{S}+\\theta)+\\lambda[P+p^{2}\\alpha_{V}+p^{2}(\\alpha_{S}+$ $\\theta)]=0$ . It immediately follows that $\\alpha_{V}=\\alpha_{S}+\\theta$ . Moreover, the level of $\\alpha_{S}$ and $\\alpha_{V}$ is determined by the participation constraints $U_{S}^{J}=U_{S}^{V}$ and $U_{V}^{J}=U_{V}^{V}=0$ . We can use $\\alpha_{V}=\\alpha_{S}+\\theta$ $q=P+2p^{2}(\\alpha_{S}+\\theta)$ and $q\\alpha_{V}-p_{V}^{2}\\alpha_{V}^{\\widetilde2}/2-I_{V}=0$ in $U_{S}^{J}=U_{S}^{V}$ to obtain after transformation $2P(\\alpha_{S}+\\theta)+3p^{2}(\\alpha_{S}+\\theta)^{2}-I-\\theta q_{V}=0$ ,where $q_{V}=$ $\\sqrt{P^{2}+2I p^{2}}$ . Solving this quadratic equation, we obtain $\\alpha_{S}+\\theta=(1/3p^{2})(-P+$ $\\sqrt{P^{2}+(I+\\theta q_{V})3p^{2}})$ .Replacing $\\alpha_{V}=\\alpha_{S}+\\theta$ we  immediately  recognize_ that $\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{V}/\\mathrm{d}\\theta>0$ Moreover, $\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{S}/\\mathrm{d}\\theta=-1+(1/3p^{2})\\sqrt{P^{2}+2I p^{2}}3p^{2}/$ $2\\sqrt{P^{2}+(I+\\theta q_{V})3p^{2}}<0$ since $\\sqrt{P^{2}+2I p^{2}}<2\\sqrt{P^{2}+(I+\\theta q_{V})3p^{2}}$ since $P^{2}+$ $2I p^{2}<4P^{2}+12I p^{2}+12\\theta q_{V}p^{2}$  \n\nThe above contract holds for $|\\theta|$ not too large. As $\\theta$ becomes large and positive, $\\alpha_{V}$ is increasing and eventually $I_{V}\\leqslant I$ becomes binding. In this case $\\alpha_{S}=0$ and $S$ is active, but without equity stake. As $\\theta$ becomes large and negative, $\\alpha_{V}$ is decreasing and eventually $I_{V}\\geqslant0$ becomes binding, so that $\\alpha_{V}=0$ . But this supposes that both $S$ and $V$ are active investors. Consider the alternative of excluding $S$ , so that $\\sigma_{S}=0$ To see how exclusion of $S$ can be beneficial, compare $W_{J}$ for joint financing, with $W_{V}$ for pure $V$ -financing. Keeping the participation constraints always binding, we can decompose $W_{J}-W_{V}$ into two components. First there is the net benefit of giving $S$ access (without any financial investments or stakes), which is given by $W_{J}(\\alpha_{S}=0)-W_{V}$ . And second, there is the net benefit of giving $S$ optimal incentives through a financial investment and stake, which is given by $W_{J}(\\alpha_{S}^{*})-W(\\alpha_{S}=0)$ where $\\alpha_{S}^{*}$ is the optimal choice. If $\\theta>0$ ，then $W(\\alpha_{S}=0)>W(V)$ and $W(\\alpha_{S}=$ $\\alpha_{V}-\\theta)\\geq W(\\alpha_{S}=0)$ , so that giving $S$ access is always beneficial. But for $\\theta<0$ , it is possible that $W(\\alpha_{S}=0)<W(V)$ . This is because giving $S$ access immediately triggers negative support of $\\sigma_{S}=p_{S}\\theta<0$ , i.e., giving access to $S$ creates potential for value destruction. Obviously, one can reduce or eliminate the negative support by giving $S$ some financial stake. While this incentive effect creates a positive net benefit, it may not be enough to offset the access effect which creates a negative net benefit. While the comparison of these effects is too difficult to trace analytically, we only need to provide a numerical example, to show that it is possible that the access effect dominates. In particular, we calculated the equilibrium contracts under the following parametric assumptions: $\\beta=0.2,~p=0.1,~P=0.5,~{\\underline{{u}}}_{S}=0.$ , and $I=0.3$ . All calculations were performed in Mathematica, and are available upon request. We obtained the following results:  \n\nAs a well-behaved benchmark case, consider $\\theta=0.1$ . If both $V$ and $S$ active we obtain $U_{S}^{J}=0.0560$ $U_{V}^{J}=0$ $U_{E}^{J}=0.3072$ ， $\\alpha_{S}=0.3470$ $\\alpha_{V}=0.2470$ and $I_{V}=$ 0.1753, whereas if only $V$ is active we obtain $U_{S}^{J}=0.0560,~U_{V}^{J}=0,~U_{E}^{J}=0.3054,$ $\\alpha_{V}=0.5964$ , which is less favorable for $E$  \n\nTo show that excluding $S$ can be optimal, consider $\\theta=-0.9$ .With both $V$ and $S$ active we obtain $U_{S}^{J}=-0.4554$ $U_{V}^{J}=0,~U_{E}^{J}=0.3039$ ， $\\alpha_{S}=0.5883$ ， $\\alpha_{V}=0$ and $I_{V}=0$ . If only $V$ is active again we obtain $U_{S}^{J}=0.0560,~U_{V}^{J}=0,~U_{E}^{J}=0.3054,$ $\\alpha_{V}=0.5964$ . We immediately see that $U_{E}^{J}=0.\\tilde{3}039<U_{E}^{J}=0.3054$ , so that having only $V$ active is better than having both $S$ and $V$ active.  \n\nTo see that $S$ can still be useful as a passive investor, simply note that without accessfor $S$ , the model reverts back to the standard model, and Proposition 1 applies. Note also that restricting access to $V$ is never necessary, since $V$ would never engage in negative support.  \n\nProof of Proposition 8. If $\\theta$ exogenous, the critical level where pure $S$ -financing becomesbetter than pure $V$ -financing, denoted by $\\theta_{1}$ , is given by $U_{E}^{S}(\\sigma_{S}(\\theta_{1}))=$ $U_{E}^{V}(\\sigma_{V})$ . For any exogenous $\\theta_{V}$ ,denote $S^{\\prime}$ s equilibrium stake by $\\alpha_{S}(\\theta_{V})$ . Allow $S$ now to make some investments in increasing $\\theta$ from $\\theta_{V}$ to $\\theta_{S}$ .At $\\alpha_{S}(\\theta_{V})$ , this would increase $U_{S}^{S}$ from $U_{S}^{S}(\\alpha_{S}(\\theta_{V}),\\theta_{V},\\psi(\\theta_{V})=0)=U_{V}^{S}(\\theta_{V})$ to $U_{S}^{S}(\\alpha_{S}(\\theta_{V}),\\theta_{S},\\psi^{\\prime}(\\theta_{S})=$ $q_{S})$ ．Moreover, since $q_{S}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ increasing  in $\\theta,~E$ is also better off, i.e., $U_{E}^{S}(\\alpha_{S}(\\theta_{V}),\\theta_{S},\\psi^{\\prime}(\\theta_{S})=q_{S})>U_{E}^{S}(\\alpha_{S}(\\theta_{V}),\\theta_{V},\\psi(\\theta_{V})=0)$ ．In equilibrium, $E$ will further  increase  her  utility  by  offering  an  alternative  contract $\\tilde{\\alpha}_{S}$ so that $U_{S}^{S}(\\tilde{\\alpha}_{S},\\theta_{S},\\psi^{\\prime}(\\theta_{S})=\\tilde{q}_{S})=U_{V}^{\\dot{S}}(\\theta_{V})$ .This further increases $E$ 's utility, i.e.,  \n\n$U_{E}^{S}(\\tilde{\\alpha}_{S},\\theta_{S},\\psi^{\\prime}(\\theta_{S})=\\tilde{q}_{S})>U_{E}^{S}(\\alpha_{S}(\\theta_{V}),\\theta_{S},\\psi^{\\prime}(\\theta_{S})=q_{S})$ .It follows that the critical value $\\theta_{1}$ decreases when $\\theta$ is endogenously increased from $\\theta_{V}$ to $\\theta_{S}$  \n\nProof of Proposition 9. Suppose ex ante transfers are feasible. Under pure $S$ financing, $E$ chooses $\\alpha_{S}$ to maximize $W=(P+p_{S}\\sigma_{S}+p_{E}\\sigma_{E})(1+\\beta+\\theta)-\\sigma_{S}^{2}/2-$ $\\sigma_{E}^{2}/2-I$ subject to the first order conditions $\\sigma_{E}=p_{E}(1+\\beta-\\alpha_{S})$ and $\\sigma_{S}=p_{S}(\\alpha_{S}+$ $\\theta$ ). We immediately see that $\\mathrm{d}W/\\mathrm{d}\\theta=(P+p_{E}^{2}(1+\\beta-\\alpha_{S})+p_{S}^{2}(1+\\beta+\\theta)>0$ This shows that $S$ financing dominates (is dominated by) $V$ -financing for $\\theta>0$ $(\\theta<0)$ . It is also useful to note that $\\mathrm{d}W/\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{S}=(p_{S}^{2}-p_{E}^{2})(1+\\beta+\\theta)+p_{E}^{2}(1+\\beta-\\alpha_{S})-$ $p_{S}^{2}(\\alpha_{S}+\\theta)=0$ which  yields $\\alpha_{S}=(p_{S}^{2}/(p_{S}^{2}+p_{E}^{2}))(1+\\beta)-(p_{E}^{2}/(p_{S}^{2}+p_{E}^{2}))\\theta$ For convenience we assume that $p_{E}$ not too small (or $\\beta$ not too large), so that $\\alpha_{S}\\leqslant1$  \n\nConsider now mixed financing, in which $V$ is active and $S$ passive. In this case the optimal  contract  maximizes $\\bar{\\cal W}=(P+p_{E}^{2}(\\alpha_{E})+p_{S}^{2}(\\alpha_{V}))(\\bar{1+}\\beta+\\theta)-p_{E}^{2}(\\alpha_{E})^{2}/2-$ $p_{S}^{\\bar{2}}(\\alpha_{V})^{2}/2-I$ ，subject to $\\propto_{E}+\\propto_{V}+\\propto_{S}=1$ and $0\\leqslant\\mathfrak{X}_{i}\\leqslant1$ . We have d ${|W/\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{E}=}$ $p_{E}^{2}(1+\\beta+\\theta)-p_{E}^{2}\\alpha_{E}=0$ , so that $\\alpha_{E}=1+\\beta+\\theta$ Similarly, we get $\\alpha_{V}=1+\\beta+\\theta$ and thus $\\alpha_{S}=1-2(1+\\beta+\\theta)$ We require $\\alpha_{S}\\geqslant0$ i.e., $\\begin{array}{r}{1\\geqslant2(1+\\beta+\\theta)\\Leftrightarrow\\theta\\leqslant-\\frac{1}{2}-}\\end{array}$ $\\beta$ It follows that mixed finance optimal for $\\begin{array}{r}{\\theta<\\theta_{0}=-\\frac{1}{2}-\\beta}\\end{array}$  \n\nAnother interesting aspect to note in this model is that for $\\theta_{0}<\\theta<\\theta_{0}$ $S$ would still want to be involved in the optimal contract. If $E$ and $V$ contract on their own, then they would choose $\\alpha_{V}=(p_{S}^{2}/(p_{S}^{2}+p_{E}^{2}))(1+\\beta)$ . But if they bring in $S$ , then they choose $\\alpha_{V}^{S}$ to maximize $W=(P+p_{E}^{2}(1+\\beta-\\alpha_{V}^{S})+p_{S}^{2}\\alpha_{V}^{S})(1+\\beta+\\theta)-p_{E}^{2}(1+\\beta-$ $\\alpha_{V}^{S})^{2}/2-^{\\prime}p_{S}^{2}(\\alpha_{V}^{S})^{2}/2-I$ so that d $\\begin{array}{r}{|W/\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{V}=(p_{S}^{2}-p_{E}^{2})(1+\\beta+\\theta)+p_{E}^{2}(1-}\\end{array}$ +β-αv)- $p_{S}^{2}\\alpha_{V}^{S}=0$ and  thus $\\alpha_{V}^{S}=(p_{S}^{2}/(p_{E}^{2}+p_{S}^{2}))(1+\\beta)+((p_{S}^{2}-p_{E}^{2})/(p_{E}^{2}+p_{S}^{2}))\\theta$ ，which differs from $\\alpha_{V}$ whenever $p_{E}\\neq p$ . For $\\theta<0$ , this allocates more shares to $V$ whenever $E$ is more productive than $V$ ,i.e., $p_{E}>p$ . This reduces the probability of success. $S$ obviously needs to make a transfer payment to convince $E$ and $V$ to move to this alternative allocation of shares.  \n\nNote that we retained the assumption that all returns are paid from profits of the firm, i.e., $0\\leqslant\\mathfrak{X}_{i}\\leqslant1$ . If we relaxed this, then it is easy to see that the first-best can always be achieved. All that is required is to set $\\alpha_{i}=p_{i}(1+\\beta+\\theta)$ for both $E$ and the active investor. This reflects the well-known result that the team-incentive problem can be solved through budget-breaking. Budget-breaking, however, is generally not collusion proof. Indeed, our constraint $\\alpha_{S}\\geqslant0$ binds naturally if $E$ and $V$ could collude to pretend that the venture succeeded, even if it failed.  \n\n## References  \n\nAdmati, A., Pfeiderer, P., 1994.

We estimate the model using venture capital (VC) co-investment networks,employing factor analysis to characterize orthogonal, interpretable resources for VC firms.

Introduction  \n\nEconomic and financial networks frequently exhibit ties (e.g., syndication activity, strategic alliances, joint ventures, or contracting) between similar partners. Observers often infer that a preference for similarity drives the pairing, particularly as a means to avoid agency costs.  \n\nHowever, similarity along a particular dimension can also result from a desire for resource accumulation with highly endowed partners or resource exchange across dimensions with differently endowed partners. In this paper, we proposearigorousmethodologytoinfer themotives underlying the choice of partner in the formation of such economic ties, and thus inform the relative importance of agency costs and resource accumulation in the formation of economic ties.  \n\nWe develop a robust and generalizable methodology that allows for theidentificationof seeking asimilar versus highly or differently endowed partner, and estimate our model in a setting in which organizational networks are of primary importance: the VC industry. Our findings suggest that concerns over agency conflicts are not a primary concern in our setting, but instead are dominated by the desire to accumulate distinct resources for the production function. Furthermore, in the VC setting, value-added resources other than capital appear to be able to exist separately from capital and still be exploited effectively.  \n\nOrganizationsformeconomictiesthroughshared activity in many financial and product markets. For example, lenders often prefer to syndicate corporate loans over being the sole source of capital; financial institutions tend to co-underwrite securities offerings; biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies regularly engage in strategic alliancesandjointventuresforthedevelopmentofnew drugs; and venture capital and private equity firms often syndicate their investments in private companies. These ties form networks that havebeen shown toinfluence governance, investment performance,and competition (Robinson and Stuart, 2007; Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu, 2007, 2010; Lindsey, 2008).  \n\nImportantly, while there has been a great deal of empirical work on the effects of tie formation, there is little empirical work characterizing how and why organizations choose the partners with whom they engage in economic activity. In contrast to the literature on social networks among individuals, it is unclear in an organizational setting that explicit preferences for similarity would underlie the motive to tie.Similarity-based motives for organizational network ties are generally attributed to the avoidance of agency conflicts, as disparate levels of a given resource maylead to expropriation, to hold-up due to informational advantages, or to extraction of rents from different outside options (e.g., Casamatta and Haritchabalet, 2007; Cestone, Lerner, and White, 2007).  \n\nAlternatively, firms may choose partners in an effort to aggregate particular resource endowments. They may therefore seek the highest-endowed partner, with the desirability ranking of a prospective partner independent of an organization's own resource levels. We refer to this driver as cumulative advantage.Cumulative advantage suggests that output of the production function underlying the shared economic activity is increasing over the observed levels of input, and thus that the input is important to the organization.  \n\nFurthermore,organizations may be endowed with multiple resources and, thus, examining similarity versus cumulative advantage alone may not give a complete picture of underlying motives for ties. Given the existence of multiple resources, it is possible that firms also distribute resources, i.e., trade, in addition to aggregating them. If organizations lack the full set of resources required to fulfill their objectives, they may form economic ties to trade distinct resources (e.g., Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven, 1996). Critically, for resource trading to be possible, it must be the case that agency concerns are either sufficiently small or resolvable through other means such that firms with differing endowments can engage in joint activity (e.g., one firm has more expertise and less available capital for investment, while the other firm has more available capital and less expertise). Both cumulative advantageandresourcetradingreflect a desiretoaccumulate particular resources for production, and we regard both as different forms of resource accumulation.  \n\nTo distinguish the underlying motives for network ties, we develop a methodology that allows us to test for the presence of similarity-based matching, cumulative advantage, and resource sharing in the formation of network ties. Existing work in the area tends to examine a single firm attribute (such as experience or location) in isolation, and typically focuses on the question of whether potential partners are similar in that particular attribute, often making inferences from coefficient loadings on differences in the observed level of the attribute for each partner. However,because multiple theoretical motivationsfor the formation of a partnershipmay lead to the observation of ties amongst partners that are similar in an attribute, previously employed approaches are insufficient to capture questions relating to the economics underlying organizational ties.  \n\nContrary to what one might expect, we show that it is insufficient to simply interpret negative coefficients on measures of absolute differences in resource levels between partners alone as evidence for similarity-based motives. Similarly, it is insufficient to interpret positive coefficients on sums of resource levels alone as evidence for cumulative advantage motives. Instead, our methodology explicitly separates the effects of variation in the endowments of the more-highly endowed and the lessendowed partners, allowing us to analyze the two variations separately. We can thus distinguish between gains from partnership that increase when the more-highly endowed partner in a pair becomes weaker or the lessendowed partner becomes stronger (consistent with a desire for similarity) versus gains that accrue when either of the partners in the pair is more-highly endowed (consistent with a desire for cumulative advantage).1  \n\nOur methodology models the gains from tie formation between a pair of firms or organizations as a function of the resources of the pair, as well as interactions among resources, which allows us to capture patterns related to the above motives of tie formation. Under the identifying assumption that ties are more likely formed when the (net) gains from tying are higher, we employ standard latent variable models to estimate the gains model and, thus, interpret the model coefficients as describing the net anticipated gains from the formation of particular types of matches.  \n\nThe VC setting is a natural laboratory for our analysis. VC firms tend to form ties with other VCs rather than investing alone (Lerner, 1994). At the same time, VCs vary greatly in their investment styles, types, and histories and, therefore, in the resources available to employ in the selection and development of their portfolio companies. In addition, the venture capital industry itself, through the funding and nurturing of startup firms, is an important engine of growth for the overall economy. In 2010, for example, revenue from formerly venture-backed firms comprised $21\\%$ of GDP, and these firms employed $11\\%$ of the private sector workforce (as reported in the National Venture Capital Association Yearbook, 2012). Since inter-organizational network ties amongst VCs have been shown to affect performance of their portfolio companies, understanding the underlying motives for these network ties is interesting and important in its ownright.  \n\nA key feature of our analysis is how we define resources and characteristics for firms. A standard problem in the literature is that many firm characteristics observable to researchers are highly correlated and can be thought of as a proxy for some facet of unobservable or harder-toquantify resources such as‘quality'Thus,while resources may be observed by market participants and in theory may be orthogonal,the proxies used to represent resources are often inexact and correlated. When resource trading exists and proxies for resources are positively correlated, estimating equations that do not account for resource tradingwillproducebiasedcoefficients witha tendency to confirm similarity (Hochberg, Lindsey, and Westerfield, 2015). While our methodology accounts for the possibility of resource trading, our characterization of resources provides advantages in avoiding such issues: we employfactor analysistoidentify orthogonal sources of variation in firm characteristics, which we then utilize as measuresofresourceendowments.  \n\nIn our particular laboratory of the VC industry, the underlying factors we uncover all have natural, intuitive interpretations. The characterization is parsimonious: we are able to capture $95\\%$ of the observable variation across 27 VC attributes with four linear and uncorrelated factors. Because they are constructed to be orthogonal, we can interpret them more easily as separate dimensions of variation. The first factor loads strongly on variables related to VC firm time-in-existence, both generally and as an investor in specific industry sectors, and thus appears to measure experience. The second loads strongly on various measures of network centrality, closeness and betweenness, as well as the number of companies in which a firm has recently invested, and thus appears to measure access. The third loads strongly on measures of firm assets under management, dollar volume of investment, and uninvested capital, and can be interpreted as measuring available capital. The fourth loads strongly on measures of VC firm diversity of investment across industry sectors, geography, and stage of investment, and thus measuresinvestmentscope.  \n\nWe find little evidence for similarity as the primary driver of tie formation in any of the four resources.2 This result is contrary to the predictions of many agency and adverse selection models, which suggest that matching should be sought based on similarity when the resource in question would allow the better-endowed partner to holdup the less-endowed partner. Only in tying over available capital do we see evidence in support of similarity as a motive for partner selection, but it exists in tension with cumulative advantage motives: as the available capital endowment of the lower-endowed of the pair increases, net gains from tying increase; but an increase in the capital of the higher-endowed of the pair exhibits no relationship to tie formation.  \n\nFurther, we find that VC firms appear to link based on cumulative advantage with respect to access and investment scope. In other words,VC firms seek partners with better network positioning and with a more generalist approach, and this preference is independent of their own positioning and approach.In contrast, economic ties appear to be enhanced by dissimilarity in experience (which we will call 'anti-similarity motives' or 'anti-similarity-based matching'). This finding suggests that not all resources related to the value-added capacity of the VC firm behave in a similar fashion. Importantly, we note that our results are consistent with the observation of similarly aged or sized VCs in the same deals. Because our factors are orthogonal, we are able to separate out the component of age that relates to experience or skill from the component that relates to capital availability or access (Lerner, 1994).3  \n\nLooking across resources, we find clear evidence of trading motives. The specific patterns of resource trading are informative and of particular interest: only some resource pairs can be traded while others must be inside the same firm to be used effectively. Anticipated net gains from trade increase when one partner has more available capital and the other is more experienced, has greater access,or greater investment scope, but there is no evidence of gains from trading across value-added resources (scope, access, or experience). Thus, our model estimates suggest that net gains from trade are larger when a single firm in the pair is endowed with higher levels of all of experience, access, and investment scope and the other VC in the pair has a high endowment of available capital. Combined with our other empirical findings, it appears that capital can exist outside the firm and be combined effectively with inside value-added, but the same does not apply to combinations of inside and outside value-addedresources.  \n\nWe also examine patterns for VC firms that share indirect ties (two VC firms that share a tie with a third VC firm but not with each other, which we call \\*friend-offriends') and VC firms with repeated ties. We find substantially similar patterns for firms with and without indirect ties, and for firms with repeat and new ties. While our specific results are confined to the VC setting, the resource factors we characterize are quite general and might reliably apply to syndicates formed by other financial intermediaries or even tothe formation of alliances among firms more broadly.  \n\nOur contribution is threefold. First, we make a methodological contribution. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to formalize an empirical model for testing commonly accepted theories of economic tie formation between organizations. Much of the prior literature on motives for inter-organizational relationships relies on indirect measures, such as stock price reactions to the announcement of an alliance (Park,Mezias, and Song, 2004) or the presence of dissimilar partners, to infer that resource trading occurred (Chung, Singh, and Lee, 2000).Further, a large literature extending the social networkconceptofhomophilytoorganizationalnetworks tends to test for partner similarity along a single dimension. Testing across competing theories of network tie formation simultaneously can be crucial, particularly if observable characteristics are correlated. Our methodology allows us to provide evidence that resources are traded across co-investment ties in the VC setting, while at the same time allowing for matching motivated by similarity, anti-similarity, and cumulative advantage.We are therefore able to determine which resources are traded and which are accumulated, as well as distinguish between similarity as a motive versus an outcome of an assortative process or an artifact of correlated levels of resources within an organization.  \n\nSecond, we contribute to the large literature exploring thenature and driversof alliances and other economicties amongst firms (see, e.g., Das and Teng, 2000; Parmigiani and Rivera-Santos, 2011, for an extensive review). Here, we focusonresourcesof VC partnerships andhowthese partnerships source additional resources through shared economic activity.In particular, we show that VCs are much more able to externally source capital than they are other resources and that agency concerns are not the primary driver of partner selection. Viewed through the lens of transaction costs (Coase, 1937; Williamson, 1981), our findings suggest that the costs for sourcing certain resources outside the partnership arelow relative to the costs associated with coordination of human capital within the VC partnership.  \n\nLast, we also contribute to the literature on VC syndication. In contrast to prior empirical work which focuses on syndication at the level of the individual deal (Lerner, 1994; Du,2008),we focus on the networks formed from the aggregation of syndicate deals. This approach allows for the influence of externalities that may accrue to the firm beyond the level of an individual deal. Theory has long recognized the need for assembling complementary resources in entrepreneurial ventures (see, e.g., Hellmann, 2007), and a number of studies have explored the valueadded activities of the venture capitalist as a financier of entrepreneurial ventures (Lerner, 1995; Hellmann and Puri, 2000, 2002; Hsu, 2004; Hochberg, 2012; Lindsey, 2008). Yet, there has been little empirical work that has explored what these resources are and how they combine to produce these value-added activities.Here,we find that different value-added resources cannot be easily combined when endowed toseparate VCs,and that not all valueadded resources (e.g., experience) behave in the same way.  \n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the empirical methodology. Section 3 describes the sample used in our empirical analysis, including the construction of the resource factors. Section 4 presents the results. Section 5 concludes.  \n\n## 2. Methodology  \n\nWe consider the network of organizations that is formed through shared economic activity, such as syndication, strategic alliances, or joint ventures. The standard description of a network is a graph with firms or agents as nodes and connections between nodes indicating ties. Each firm node is indexed by $i\\in\\{1,...,n\\}$ and has a vector of attributes, $X_{i}$ which we denote as resources. Each pair of firms $(i,j)$ on the graph may also have a set of joint attributes, $\\hat{X}_{i j}$ ，which denote pair-specific attributes. In our setting, these joint attributes consist of resource interaction effects, the existence of a past connection, and having had a common geographic area or industry sector in past investment. The matrix of connections $M$ is $n\\times n$ ,with $M_{i j}=1$ if firms $i$ and $j\\neq i$ form a tie based on shared economic activity in a given time period, and $M_{i j}=0$ otherwise.  \n\n### 2.1. Latent variable approach  \n\nThe probability that any given pair of firms form a tie is a function of the individual and joint attributes of those firms:  \n\n$$\n\\mathsf{P}\\big[M_{i j}=1\\big]=G(X_{i},X_{j},\\hat{X}_{i j})\\in[0,1].\n$$  \n\nBecause the net gains from tie formation are unobservable, this setting corresponds to a latent variable model in which there is an unobserved variable which represents the anticipated net gains (quality) of a tie. We assume that any pair of firms in the network will form a connection when the net gain from doing so is positive. We denote the net gains from the formation of a tie between firms i and $j$ by $Y_{i j},$ sothat $M_{i j}=1_{Y_{i j}>0}$ We further specify the gains function $_g$ so that $Y_{i j}=g(X_{i},X_{j},\\hat{X}_{i j})-\\epsilon_{i j}$ where $\\epsilon_{i j}$ is an independent, mean zero error term with cumulative density function $F.$ Then  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{G(X_{i},X_{j},\\hat{X}_{i j})=\\mathsf{P}\\big[M_{i j}=1\\big]=\\mathsf{P}\\big[Y_{i j}>0\\big]=\\mathsf{P}\\Big[g(X_{i},X_{j},\\hat{X}_{i j})>\\epsilon_{i j}\\Big]}\\ &{\\qquad=F(g(X_{i},X_{j},\\hat{X}_{i j})).}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nTo simplify notation, we denote $g(X_{i},X_{j},\\hat{X}_{i j})$ as $g(i,j)$ and $G(X_{i},X_{j},\\hat{X_{i j}})$ as $G(i,j)$ . Since ties are bi-directional in this model $(M_{i j}=M_{j i,\\ast}$ $_g$ and $G$ must be symmetric: $g(i,j)=g(j,i)$ and ${G}(i,j)={G}(j,i)$ . Given a set of binary bi-directional ties between firms, the gains function can be estimated via a standard logit or probit model.Also,since we do not observe the ultimate division of surplus, our model implicitly assumes that the total gains from tie formation are what drives theformation of a tie.  \n\nWe can extend this framework to include the possibility that ties may be of different strengths. To do so, we set $M_{i j}$ to equal the number of interactions that underly a single link. Then $G(X_{i},X_{j},\\hat{X}_{i j})=\\operatorname*{max}(0,Y_{i j}),$ andweidentify the net gains from a given potential match from the number of ties rather than the existence of a tie, putting more weight on a link when it occurs more frequently. Given a set of weighted bi-directional ties between firms, the gains function can then be estimated using a Tobit regression.  \n\nIn our tests, we will first estimate the determinants of the latent variable Y (the $_g$ function)to test theories of tie formation. This approach allows us to escape the problems inherent in interpreting effects of interaction terms and compound terms in probit and logit regressions described by Ai and Norton (2003). We will then use the marginal effects (the G function) to interpret the economic magnitudes of the determinants of tie formation.  \n\nWe make three identifying assumptions in our estimation procedure. The first assumption is that higher quality matches have a higher propensity to be realized, and we believe this assumption is innocuous. The second assumption is that pair-tie-qualities are independent, or, put differently, that the firm-pair is the correct unit of observation, and the presence of a third firm does not change the propensity of the first two firms to tie. In other words, we are treating the group of three VC firms A-B-C as three pairs of VC firms: A-B, B-C, and A-C, and we assume that the presence of C does not affect the propensity of A and B to tie.4 This assumption does not prevent tactical formation of ties in the future-a tie between A and B may have value toBfrom anticipated future ties-aslongas thebasis for anticipated future ties can be proxied by current characteristics, such as network centrality or betweenness. Thus, our third assumption is that ties are formed based on information contained in current characteristics.  \n\nIn order to disentangle cumulative advantage and similarity empirically, we also require that firms are sufficiently unconstrained in the number of ties that they can form. In a standard one-to-one matching model (e.g.,  \n\nBecker, 1973; Shimer and Smith, 2000), each partner is limited to one other partner. While each participant prefers the best available partner, the observed ties in equilibrium are between similar partners, despite the fact that firms formed such ties as a result of cumulative advantage motives. In contrast, if each partner could link with many others,partners with a high endowment of the resource in question will link with other highly endowed partners, but alsowill linkwithpartners that havelower endowments of that resource once matches with highly endowed partners are exhausted. Since ties between two firms with alowendowmentof theresourcearetheleastvaluable, they will be the least frequent. Thus, it is the desire to matchwith thebestavailablepartnerincombinationwith capacity constraints that lead to similarity in outcomes in standard positive assortative matching. If capacity constraints are relaxed, one may observe a pattern of high-low links along with many high-type links, enabling the observer to separate cumulative advantage from similarity. Our empirical results (a lack of similarity-based matching; see Section 4) suggest that capacity constraints are not binding in our setting.  \n\n### 2.2. Specification and tests  \n\nFor simplicity, we assume a linear structure on $g(i,j)$ 5. Consider a pair of resources, A and $B$ ; firm i's holding of A is $A_{i}$ and firm j's holding of $B$ is $B_{j}$ . Our basic specification is that the gains from a tie are determined by the quantity of resources available to the pair and the resource arrangement:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{g(i,j)=\\underset{r e s o u r c e s}{\\sum}\\beta_{S}^{A}\\big(A_{i}+A_{j}\\big)+\\beta_{D}^{A}\\big|A_{i}-A_{j}\\big|}\\ &{\\qquad+\\underset{p a i r s}{\\sum}\\beta_{R S}^{A B}[(A_{i}-A_{j})(B_{j}-B_{i})]^{+}+\\gamma Z_{i j},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $Z$ are any additional controls (such as past shared investment sectors, etc.). ‘Pairs' are unordered resource pairs, so four resources leads to six combinations. When we are discussing a generic resource, we will omit the superscript on $\\beta_{S}$ and $\\beta_{D}$  \n\nThe first two terms test for the effects of the total level of any one resource across both firms $(A_{i}+A_{j})$ and its arrangement $(|A_{i}-A_{j}|)$ .A naive approach in theliterature is tointerpret $\\beta_{D}<0$ as evidence for similarity-based motives in tie formation; alternatively, a positive coefficient on an indicator variable for similarity along some dimension is interpreted as evidence of similarity-based matching. To test for cumulative advantage, a naive approach is to interpret $\\beta_{S}>0$ as evidence that firms use their ties to accumulate as much of a given resource as possible. However, neither of these two approaches is correct. To illustrate how these sums and differences interact, we consider a simple economy made up of two types of firms: High-type firms have one unit of resource A, low-type firms have zero units of $A,$ .and firms are identical along all other dimensions.  \n\nBoth  cumulative  advantage   and  similarity-based matching predict that high types prefer to link with other high types over linking with low types: $g(H,H)-g(H,L)=\\beta_{S}(1+1)+\\beta_{D}|1-1|-\\beta_{S}(1+0)-\\beta_{D}|1-$ $0|=\\beta_{S}-\\beta_{D}>0$ .Thus, to distinguish between the two hypotheses, we must examine the preferences of the low types. Similarity-based matching implies low types prefer other low types $(g(H,L)-g(L,L)=\\beta_{S}+\\beta_{D}<0)$ ，while cumulative advantage implies that low types prefer to match with high types $(g(H,L)-g(L,L)=\\beta_{S}+\\beta_{D}>0)$ .Akey point is that both similarity-based matching and cumulative advantage may lead to the observation of many ties between two high-type firms. The distinction is that similarity also predicts more ties between two low-type firms, whereas cumulative advantage predicts some mixing between high and low types.  \n\nIt is also possible that firms prefer to match with partners that differ with respect to a particular resource level ('anti-similarity'). Anti-similarity may result, for example, if firms trade a particular pair of resources as a result of differing endowments. For low-type firms, antisimilarity and cumulative advantage have the same prediction that low-type firms will prefer to match with hightype firms $(g(H,L)-g(L,L)=\\beta_{S}+\\beta_{D}>0)$ . However, antisimilarity implies high types prefer to match with low types rather than other high types $(g(H,H)-g(H,L)=$ $\\beta_{S}-\\beta_{D}<0)$ . We can therefore distinguish anti-similarity from cumulative advantage by examining the behavior of high types. To sum, the predictions of anti-similaritybased matching are the opposite of similarity-based matching.  \n\nThus, we can reject hypotheses based on the signs of $\\beta_{S}$ and $\\beta_{D}$ alone, but sums and differences are required to confirm. For example, cumulative advantage implies $\\beta_{S}-\\beta_{D}>0$ and $\\beta_{S}+\\beta_{D}>0$ .Adding these two equations together, we see that cumulative advantage implies $\\beta_{S}>0$ SO $\\beta_{S}{\\geqslant}0$ is sufficient to reject cumulative advantage. However, $\\beta_{S}>0$ alone is not sufficient to confirm cumulative advantage. Similarly, we can reject similarity-based matching if $\\beta_{D}\\neq0$ but $\\beta_{D}<0$ is not sufficient to confirm. Distinguishing the various forms of matching requires tests of the sums and differences of coefficients on paired resources, rather than of each individual coefficient alone.  \n\nMore generally, holding the levels of all other resources equal, we can take the derivative of the gains function (1) with respect to the resource levels of the two firms:  \n\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial g(i,j)}{\\partial A_{i}}\\right|_{B_{i}=B_{j}}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{{\\beta_{S}+\\beta_{D}}}&{{\\mathrm{if}\\quad A_{i}>A_{j}}}\\ {{\\beta_{S}-\\beta_{D}}}&{{\\mathrm{if}\\quad A_{i}<A_{j}}}\\end{array}\\right..\n$$  \n\nHere, $\\beta_{S}+\\beta_{D}$ describes the effect of variation in the resource level of the firm with more of the resource, whereas $\\beta_{S}-\\beta_{D}$ describes the effect of variation in the resource level of the firm with less of the resource. Under cumulative advantage, increasing either potential partner's resource level increases the net gains from a potential match, and so we should observe both $\\beta_{S}+\\beta_{D}>0$ and $\\beta_{S}-\\beta_{D}>0$ In contrast, if similarity enhances the net gains from a potential match,increasing the resource level of the partner with less of the resource will increase the quality of a tie, while increasing the resource level of the partner with more will decrease the quality. Thus, we require $\\beta_{S}+\\beta_{D}<0$ and $\\beta_{S}-\\beta_{D}>0$  \n\nTo confirm our interpretation, observe that the specification in (1) is mechanically equivalent to  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\displaystyle{g(i,j)=\\sum_{r e s o u r c e s}\\beta_{M A X}^{A}\\mathrm{max}(A_{i},A_{j})+\\beta_{M I N}^{A}\\mathrm{min}(A_{i},A_{j})}}\\ &{\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad+\\displaystyle{\\sum_{p a i r s}+\\beta_{R S}^{A B}[(A_{i}-A_{j})(B_{j}-B_{i})]^{+}+\\gamma Z_{i j}},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\beta_{M A X}=\\beta_{S}+\\beta_{D}$ and $\\beta_{M I N}=\\beta_{S}-\\beta_{D}$ 6 Cumulative advantage requires that the quality of a potential link increases in either firm's resource level, so that $\\beta_{M A X}>0$ and $\\beta_{M I N}>0$ . Similarity-based matching requires that the quality of a potential link increases in the resource level of the smaller partner and decreases in the resource level of the larger partner: $\\beta_{M A X}<0$ and $\\beta_{M I N}>0$  \n\nFinally, resource sharing motives imply that partnerships are driven by trade across resources. If both A and $B$ are important inputs into the production function of the firm, two firms i and $j$ are more likely to engage in shared activity (and thus form a tie) if one of the pair has a high endowment of resource $A$ and little of resource B, and the other is endowed with a high level of $B$ and little of A. Tests forresource sharing should therefore considerpairs of resources and focus on potential pairings in which the VC firms have resources to trade.A straightforward term for capturing this notion is $[(A_{i}-A_{j})(B_{j}-B_{i})]^{+}$ . The $[X]^{+}$ notation is used to denote the positive component of $X$ $\\operatorname*{max}(X,0)$ .Themax operatorseparates out thoseobservations for which one firm has more of resource A and the other firm has more of resource B: $(A_{i}-A_{j})(B_{j}-B_{i})>0$ when one firm, i or $j,$ has more of one resource and less oftheother.This structureidentifiescasesin which resource trading is possible. Under resource sharing, ties are of higher quality when the differences in resource levels are greater, and therefore, we would expect this term to have a positive effect on $g(i,j)$ .In a linear specification, a sufficient test for resource trading motivations is thus $\\beta_{R S}>0$  \n\nThe presence of resource trading can also inform the importance of agency considerations (e.g., as in Casamatta and Haritchabalet, 2007; Cestone,Lerner, and White, 2007) beyond tests for similarity-based matching. Suppose two firms differ in their levels of a resource such as expertise, and a firm with higher levels of expertise can hold up or expropriate a partner with less expertise. If agency costs are a first-order consideration in the selection of partners, expertise should not be traded for other resources, as such trade would imply that one of the partners who is trading is highly endowed with expertise (and less endowed with a different resource they are trading for）while the second partner is endowed with little expertise (but a high amount of the second resource that is being traded). More generally, we should not observe economic ties between firms with different levels of any type of resource if agency concerns are important for that resource: observed ties should be purely between similar firms. In contrast, if agency concerns are not primary, then we may observe high-expertise firms with low levels of capital co-investing with firms that have high levels of capital but low levels of expertise, for example. Thus, the relative frequency of similar pairs versus resource trading can shed light on the relative importance of agency problems.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Theory</td><td colspan=\"3\">Single resource</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Prediction</td><td>Test</td></tr><tr><td>Similarity-based matching</td><td>0g(i, j) | 0A B;=Bj</td><td>0> if Ai>Aj >0 if Ai< Aj</td><td>βs+βD<0 βs-βD >0</td></tr><tr><td>Anti-similarity-based matching</td><td>0g(i, j) 0Ai B;=Bj</td><td>>0 if Ai> Aj 0> if Ai< Aj</td><td>βs +βD >0 βs-βD<0</td></tr><tr><td>Cumulative advantage</td><td>dg(i, j) 0Ai B;=Bj</td><td>>0 if Ai>Aj >0 if Ai< Aj</td><td>βs+βD>0 βs-βD>0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Theory</td><td colspan=\"3\">Resource pairs</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Prediction</td><td>Test</td></tr><tr><td>Resource sharing</td><td colspan=\"2\">0g(i, j) >0 θ[(A- A;)(B;- B:)]+</td><td>βRs >0</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nOur predictions and the respective empirical tests are summarized in Fig. 1. We note that resource sharing, cumulative advantage, and similarity-based motives for ties need not be mutually exclusive. For example, one might imagine that firms match on certain resources based on cumulative advantage while seeking similarly endowed partners with regards to other resources that are more prone to lead to agency conflicts.  \n\n## 3. Data  \n\nThe data for our analysis come from Thomson Financial's Venture Economics database. Our sample, which is also employed in Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu (2007), begins in 1980, marking the beginning of venture capital as an asset class that attracts institutional investors, and extends through 2003, with firm exit information updated through 2009.7 As many of our computed measures require five years of historical data,we include all VC investments made from1975 onwards.We concentrate solely on U.s.-based VC investments, excluding investments by angels and buyout funds. While VC funds have a limited (usually ten-year) life, the VC management firms that manage the funds have no predetermined lifespan. Success in a first-time fund often enables the VC firm to raise a follow-on fund (Kaplan and Schoar, 2005; Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Vissing-Jorgensen, 2014; Chung, Sensoy, Stern, and Weisbach, 2012), resulting in a sequence of funds raised a few years apart. Experience and contacts acquired in the running of one fund carry over to the firm's next fund and, therefore, we measure VC characteristics at the firm rather than fund level.  \n\n### 3.1. Ties  \n\nTo construct the pattern of economic ties among VC firms, we follow Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu (2007), and use co-investments in VC portfolio companies. As our analysis will focus on undirected ties, we define the syndicate as the collection of VC firms that invested in a given portfolio company across all rounds.8  \n\nIaDleI Summarystatistics:characteristics.

Within each of these five-year windows, we make nodistinctionbetweenrelationships reflected in earlier or later co-investments. We compute both binary networks that record a tie if vC i and VC $j$ formoneor more syndicates over the course of the five-year period, and valued networks that weight each tie between VC i and $j$ by the number of companies in which they have coinvested over the five-year period, forming a count of the ties. Each of these is used as a dependent variable in our analysis.  \n\nIn addition, we create four indicator variables for each VC-pair's interactions in each five-year period: if the VCfirm-pair invested in the same industry segment; if the VC-firm-pair invested in the same geography segment; if the VC-firm-pair had a tie in the previous five years; and if each VC firm in the pair had a tie with a common third firm (i.e., were friends-of-friends).  \n\n### 3.2. VC firm characteristics  \n\nWe compute a variety of vC firm-level characteristics. In Table 1, we present the number of observations, mean, and standard deviation for each of the VC firm characteristic measures presented below.  \n\nTo measure the overall time in existence of the VC firm, we take the natural logarithm of the number of days since the VC firm's first-ever investment. Additionally, we calculate VC time in existence on a per-sector basis. During the period of our sample,Venture Economics classifies investments into six broad industry sectors: Biotechnology; Communications and media; Computer-related; Medical, health, life sciences; Non-high-technology; and Semiconductors, other electronics. We calculate a VC firm's duration in each sector as the natural logarithm of the number of days since the firm's first-ever investment in that sector, to year t.  \n\nMany VC firms may focus their investments in a particular industry sector or geographic location (Sorenson and Stuart, 2001) or by stage of initial investment. We define three measures of VC firm specialization, each using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of investment over the five-year period ( $t-5$ to $t-1$ )based on the dollar amount of investment. We compute specialization measures for industry using the six broad Venture Economics (VE） sectors, geography using Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), and stage (as defined by VE) using only the earliest round in which each firm invests for each portfolio company.? To ease interpretation in our subsequent analysis, we transform these variables to obtain measures of generalization across industry, geography, and stage, defined as $1-H H I(X)$  \n\nThe size of a VC firm, the extent of its investment activities, and the amount of capital it has available for investment may all influence its desirability as an investment partner. We construct a number of measures that capture the extent and size of a VC firm's activity. In each year t, we compute VC firm assets under management as the sum of the total dollars committed to its currently active funds, where a fund is defined as active for ten years from its initial raising. We compute the total number of dollars invested by the firm, number of companies invested in by the firm, and number of investment rounds participated in by the firm over the period $t-5$ to $t-1$ as measures of overall extent of recent firm investment activity. We compute the VC's ‘dry powder′ or capital available for investment, as the total committed capital of its most recently raised fund minus the dollars already invested by that fund in portfolio companies by time t. To capture the typical size of deals in which the firm invests, we compute the average total round size for the investing syndicate for rounds of investment in which the VC firm participated over the period $t-5$ to $t-1$ .Wealso compute the number of portfolio companies a VC firm has funded and the fraction of the firm's total deals that it originated (participated in the first round) since its inception. We further compute measures of the past success of a VC firm. Following common convention in the literature, wecompute twomeasures of success:theVC firm's historical IPO rate, defined as the proportion of its portfolio firm investments that have successfully exited via initial public offering (IPO), and the VC firm's historical M&A rate, defined as the proportion of its portfolio firm investments that have successfully exited via trade sale, merger, or acquisition (M&A). As more recent exit activity may be more salient, we additionally compute the number of IPOs and the number of M&A exits the firm has had over the preceding five-year period.  \n\nFinally, Gulati (1998,1999) suggests that current network position can influence the future formation of ties. We utilize five measures of the VC's current network position, each of which captures a slightly different aspect of a VC firm's influence in the network.We compute the VC firm's degree as the number of unique VCs in the network with which a VC has ties, normalized by the maximum possible degree for that size network (i.e., $n{\\mathrm{-}}1)$ , as a proxy for the information, deal flow, expertise, and contacts to which it has access. We compute indegree as the number of unique VCs in the network who have invited the VC firm in question to join them in a syndicate as a junior co-investor, thereby expanding its investment opportunity set, and outdegree as the number of unique VC firms in the network that the VC firm in question has invited into syndicates it has led,which captures the VC firm's ability to generate such co-investment opportunities. As with the previous measure, both indegree and outdegree are normalized by the maximum possible measure obtainable in a network of that size. We compute eigenvector centrality as the sum of a VC firm's ties to other VCs, weighted by their respective centralities, and normalized by the highest possible eigenvector centrality in a network of that size. This captures a VC's access to the best-connected VCs. Last, we compute betweenness, which captures a firm's ability to act as an intermediary in bringing together VCs for investment opportunities, as the proportion of all paths in the network linking any two other VCs in the network that pass through the VC firm, normalized by the maximum betweenness for a network of that size.  \n\n### 3.3. Characterizing resource factors  \n\nMany VC firm characteristics likely measure aspects of the same underlying feature of the firm, making it difficult to interpret empirical models that employ all observable characteristics as independent variables. We employ a factor analysis to extract the main variation in the VC firms' characteristics. Factor analysis reduces the attribute space from a larger number of variables to a smaller number of latent factors. Further, the factors can be specified to be orthogonal to one another.10  \n\nOur factor analysis uses as inputs all of the VC firm characteristics described in Section 3.2. Table 2 reports the results of the factor analysis, with orthogonal factors of mean zero and standard deviation one. Factors are expressed as loadings on the characteristics. A factor's eigenvalue is a measure of the amount of information captured by the factor. A standard criterion is to include all factors with eigenvalues greater than one-meaning all factors that in some sense have more information than the average variable. The first four factors have eigenvalues greater than one and cumulatively explain approximately $95\\%$ of the variation in the VC characteristics variables. The fifth factor produced in the rotated analysis has an eigenvalueof0.56.  \n\nThese factors also have natural interpretations. The first factor has an eigenvalue of 10.71 and can be interpreted as an experience factor. The characteristics with the highest loadings on this factor are the VC firm's overall experience and the six sector-specific experience variables, with rotated loadings ranging from 0.67 for experience in the biotechnology sector to 0.93 for general VC firm experience. The total number of companies in which the firm has invested and its recent round activity load moderately, with loadings of 0.53 and 0.49. The set of variables with the next highest loadings in this factor are variables related to past investment success: the historical exit rate, historical IPO rate, recent IPOs, and recent M&A exits have loadings that are considerably lower, ranging from 0.3 to0.4.  \n\nThe second factor, with an eigenvalue of 3.70, can be interpreted as an access factor. The characteristics with the highest loadings on this factor are the five normalized measures of network position (normalized degree, indegree, outdegree, eigenvector centrality, and betweenness), with rotated loadings ranging from 0.73 for betweenness to 0.95 for degree.Additionally, the number of companies in which the VC firm has invested over the preceding fiveyear period has a loading of 0.67. Recent IPO activity loads moderately, at 0.54. This likely captures the VC firm's  \n\nThis table presents results from a principal factor analysis with orthogonal varimax rotation (Kaiser, 1958). In Panel A, we report the eigenvalues, cumulative variance, and factor loadings for the first four factors. Panel B presents scoring coefficients. The analysis, which produced a total of 15 factors explaining $104.7\\%$ of total variance, is based on 27 VC firm characteristics for 18,615 VC-firm-year observations from 1980 to 2003. Summary statistics for each characteristic can be found in Table 1. Loadings and scoring coefficients in bold indicate that the characteristic can be considered to be represented by the factor. Scoring coefficients are obtained using the regression method and are computed by multiplying the inverse of the observed variable correlation matrix by the matrix of factor loadings. To locate particular VCs along each factor, we multiply the scoring coefficients by the standardized values of observed characteristics and take the sum.  \n\nTable 2 Factor analysis.

 \n\nportfolio company network reach, and thus perhaps the firm's more general network access.  \n\nThe third factor, with an eigenvalue of 2.08, can be interpreted as capturing available capital. The characteristics with the highest loadings on this factor are assets under management, the total dollars the VC firm has invested over the prior five years,and the measure of 'dry powder, or uninvested capital, with rotated loadings ranging from 0.70 for dry powder to 0.90 for assets under management.  \n\nFinally, the fourth factor has an eigenvalue of 1.32, and can be interpreted as an investment scope factor. The characteristics with the highest loadings on this factor are the three measures of generalization along industry, geography, and stage, with rotated loadings ranging from 0.75 for industry scope to 0.78 for geographic scope.  \n\nWe note that a number of the included characteristics do not load strongly on any of the factors. These include the fraction of deals that the firm originates, average round size, and, to a lesser extent, historical and recent exit rates. To our knowledge, there is no formal method for determining whether to consider a factor as representative of a particular attribute. In our analysis, the largest break in loadings across all factors occurs between the 0.67 loading onrecent number of companies and the 0.54 loading on recent IPO activity, both for the access factor. In providing intuition about the magnitudes of effects, we take this break as determining whether a factor represents a particular attribute. All of our tests, however, consider the full vector of factor loadings.  \n\nIn Panel B of Table 2, we present scoring coefficients used to determine resource factors for each VC-year. While the loadings (discussed above) describe how to recover characteristics from factors, the scoring coefficients describe how to recover factors from the observed characteristics. Scores are obtained using the regression method, with coefficient weights computed by multiplying the inverse of the observed variable correlation matrix by the matrix of factor loadings. To calculate a particular VC's resource endowment, we multiply the scoring coefficients by the standardized values of observed characteristics and take the sum.  \n\nTo further the intuition for the resource factors, we relate them both to partnership performance and to the breadth and depth of a VC firm's co-investment ties over the subsequent period. In untabulated results, we estimate fractional logit models of IPO and exit rates as a function of the four resource factors.11 We also estimate probit and  \n\nTobit models relating a firm's four factor resources to the firm's likelihood of forming any tie, the proportion of the VC firms in the network with which it ties, and the strength (i.e., number) of ties formed. The models include year indicators, with robust heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors clustered at the VC-firm level.  \n\nThe estimates from these models suggest that experience, access, and scope are positively related to VC performance as measured by the proportion of successful exits. This result is consistent with our interpretation of these factors as value-added resources. In addition, higheraccess, better-capitalized, and more broadly focused firms are more likely to form any tie, tie with a larger number of distinct partners in the network, and form stronger and more stable ties. Experience, in contrast, is associated with fewer, weaker ties: it exhibits no significant effect on the likelihood of having a tie in the network and is negatively and significantly related to the number of VC firms with whicha givenfirm ties and the strengthof thoseties. Already, we observe that not all resource factors behave similarly in predicting either success or the formation of ties.  \n\n## 4. Empirical analysis  \n\nFor our analysis, we estimate the likelihood of a tie existing between a pair of vC firms as a function of the resource profiles of the two firms in question using the model described in Eq. (1). The unit of observation is a pair of VC firms in a given year, constructed using data over a five-year period.12 In each specification, we include eight single-resource terms: for each of the four resource factors, there is a summation term and an absolute difference term describing the resources of the pair. We include six dual-resource terms to capture resource trading,representing the ${\\binom{4}{2}}=6$ pairs of distinct resources.  \n\nThe estimates from our models are presented in Tables 3 and 4. Table 3 presents an estimation of the model that includes only the single-resource terms. Table 4 adds the resource trading terms to the model. For both tables, Panel A presents the results of the estimation, and Panel B presents the $t\\cdot$ -testsforthe hypotheses of cumulative advantage and similarity-based  \n\nTable3 Pair level ties—single-resource-terms only.  \n\nPanel A of the table reports estimated coefficients from pair-level models of whether a pair of vC firms in the network forms a tie. The observation is a VC firm-pair-year $\\overset{\\prime}{N}=1,087,372\\$ 1. In column 1 the dependent variable is an indicator variable taking the value of one if the pair of VC firms has a tie in the undirected network matrix, and zero otherwise. In column 2, the dependent variable is the valued tie measure, which weights the binary tie indicator by the number of deals underlying the network link. Columns 3 and 4 repeat these analyses with additional controls for investments in the same industry and geography. Columns 1 and 3 are estimated via probit regressions; columns 2 and 4 are estimated via Tobit regressions.

Two-way clustering produces the most conservative standard error estimates of the methods employed, and as such are reported in the tables throughout.  \n\nIn column 2,we replace our binary measure of ties with the valued measure that captures the strength of the tie betweenVC i and $j$ if such ties exists, and zero otherwise, and we estimate a Tobit model. In columns 3 and 4, we reestimate the baseline models from columns 1 and 2, adding indicator controls for whether the pair of vC firms in question had previously invested in a common geography or industry segment. In all specifications of Tables 3 and 4, we also include indicator variables for each year.  \n\nAcross all four specifications in each table, we observe that the coefficients on the summed factors for access, capital, and investment scope are positive and significant, as are coefficients for the absolute value of differences in the experiencefactor.The differencefactor coefficients for access and capital are negative and significant. As previously noted, on their own, the signs and significance of the coefficients tell us very little about the nature of the ties. Instead, we focus on the relation between the coefficients for the sum and absolute difference coefficients for each of the individual resource factors.  \n\nWe first consider tests for similarity-based matching and cumulative advantage motives. The patterns we describe below are apparent regardless of whether we estimate the model with or without the resource sharing terms. First, recall that if firms seek similarity in a particular resource, we expect $\\beta_{S}+\\beta_{D}$ (the coefficient on the summed resource levels of firm i and firm $j$ plus the coefficient on the absolute differences of theresourcelevel of firm i and the resource level of firm $j_{\\cdot}^{\\cdot}$ to be negative, while we expect $\\beta_{S}-\\beta_{D}$ to be positive. For the experience factor, the first of these predictions is violated in the baseline model $(\\beta_{S}+\\beta_{D}$ is positive) and the second is inconclusive $(\\beta_{S}-\\beta_{D}$ is insignificantly different from zero); both of these predictions are violated in the models controlling for past shared investment location or industry $(\\beta_{S}+\\beta_{D}$ positive and $\\beta_{S}-\\beta_{D}$ negative). These results suggest that the motive for matching on experience is not similarity-based. Furthermore, only one of the two conditions for cumulative advantage on experience is met: $\\beta_{S}+\\beta_{D}$ is positive, as predicted by cumulative advantage, but $\\beta_{S}-\\beta_{D}$ is negative (or zero), where cumulative advantage would predict it positive as well. Thus, neither similarity-based matching nor cumulative advantage appear to be supported for formation of ties on the experience factor; rather, the coefficients for the experience factor terms are consistent with anti-similarity. In contrast, we find clear support for cumulative advantagefor the access and investment scope factors, with both conditions for cumulative advantage met for each, and the $\\beta_{S}+\\beta_{D}<0$ conditionfor similarity-based matching violated.  \n\nThe tests for the capital availability factor are more nuanced. From Eq. (2), the term $\\beta_{S}+\\beta_{D}$ gives the effect of increasing capital availability for thepartner that has more capital. The term $\\beta_{S}-\\beta_{D}$ does the same for the partner that has less capital. Since $\\beta_{S}+\\beta_{D}$ is near zero and not significant, while $\\beta_{S}-\\beta_{D}$ is large and significant, our estimates imply that ties are more likely when the partner with less capital has more, but not when the partner with more capital has more. From Fig. 1, this outcome would ensue when cumulative advantage and similarity-based matching both exist at roughly the same magnitude.13  \n\nWe now turn to the resource sharing terms in the model. The test for resource sharing is that the coefficient $\\beta_{R S}$ for a pair of resources be positive. Examining the estimate summary in Fig. 2 indicates a number of resource pairs that appear to be traded. The coefficient of interest, $\\beta_{R S},$ is positive and significant for the pairs (experience, available capital) and (investment scope, available capital) in all specifications, and additionally for the pair (access, available capital) in the models that control for past shared investment location and industry. Thus, VC firm i's availability of capital appears to trade with firm j's experience, investment scope, and access. In contrast, $\\beta_{R S}$ isnegative and significant for the pairs (access, experience) and (access, investment scope), suggesting that the gains from trade are higher when the firms in the pair are not trading these resources, but rather, only one firm of the pair is highly endowed with both resources. The combination of thepositive $\\beta_{R S}s$ for capital availability vis-a-vis experience,investment scope,and access and the negative $\\beta_{R S}s$ for access vis-a-vis experience and investment scope suggests formation of a tie between two VC firms is especially beneficial when one of the pair is endowed with high levels of experience, access, and investment scope, and low levels of capital availability,while the other is endowed with low levels of skill, access, and scope, but high levels of capital. In industry parlance, this can be interpreted as the equivalent of ‘high value-added' pairing with‘dumb money.'  \n\nA natural question is whether observing higher gains for \"high value-added’ firms forming ties with ‘dumb money' might be an artifact of measuring ties using all rounds of investment. Common belief among VC practitioners is that investors often bring in syndicate partners that have high capital availability in later rounds of investment, while experience, networks, or other expertise may be more beneficial in earlier rounds of investment. For robustness, in unreported results, we reformulate our networks such that a VC-firm-pair has a network tie only if they have coinvested in one or more first-round deals; we then reestimate our models using the measures of ties that result from these first-round co-investments. We observe qualitatively similar patterns for both the one-resource and tworesource tests, suggesting that the patterns of resource combination and distribution over tie formation are also present for first-round investment ties.  \n\nOur findings on trade are more intuitive than they may perhaps seem: for certain deals, high-value-added VC firms may prefer to avoid syndicate conflicts that can arise from partnering with another high-value-added VC whose opinions may differ from theirs but who may believe that their signal is the correct one. They may therefore partner with low-value-added, potentially passive, VC firms who are likely to let them set strategy for the syndicate. Along this same line, it is possible that organizations with large amounts of capital but less in the way of value-added resources are more likely to rely on the signal of the high-value-added resource investor rather than seeking their own signal, thus reducing coordination costs. This interpretation is consistent with the findings of Brander, Amit, and Antweiler (2004), who report evidence against the second-opinion hypothesis as a motive for syndication.  \n\nOne might think access and perhaps scope are more likely to be developed over time if a VC firm has a preference for tying in general. While our goal is to describe patterns of observed tie formation as related to existing characteristics, in unreported tests we augment our models with acontrol for the total number of ties for both VC firms in the pair and also estimate alternative specifications that include a fixed effect for the level of pair ties. These tests also serve to assuage concerns over VC firms facing some form of loose capacity constraint for ties. Given the high correlation between the access resource factor and ties, some coefficients are unsurprisingly weakened. Nevertheless, the pattern of resource combination and distribution remains qualitatively similar.  \n\n### 4.1. Robustness: past ties and indirect ties  \n\nThus far, the patterns we observe are consistent for both binary and valued measures of pair-level ties, both with and without controls for similar areas of investment as proxied by geography or industry. Because the networks we explore arebased on co-investment activities,the VC firms involved in the relationship presumably evaluate their partner and may build partner-specific capital. Once the relationship is formed,such costs are sunk,but VCs gain additional information about partner quality. Thus, it isnaturaltoaskwhetherinitialtieformationandtie continuation manifest of the same process.  \n\nWe can test for the role of past ties either by including an additional control or by separating the sample into VCpairs that have a previous tie and VC-pairs that do not. Separating the sample allows us to test for different patterns of network formation without having to specify a functional form for the difference. Table 5 presents the  \n\nTable 5   \nPair-level repeat and new ties-subsamples.Panel A of the table reports estimated coefficients from pair-level models of whether a pair of VC firms in the network forms a tie for subsamples of pairs of firms that tie in the prior period (repeat tie formation, $N{=}90{,}699;$ Iand firms with no tie in the prior period (new ties, $N{=}996{,}673{.}$ .The observation is a VC firm-pair-year. In columns 1 and 3 the dependent variable is an indicator variable taking the value of one if the pair of VC firms has a tie in the undirected network matrix, and zero otherwise. In columns 2 and 4, the dependent variable is the valued tie measure, which weights the binary tie indicator by the number of deals underlying the network link. We tabulate baseline models; all results are robust to adding controls for both firms in the pair having past investments in the same industry or geography segment. Columns 1 and 3 are estimated via probit regression; columns 2 and 4 are estimated via Tobit regression.

The table presents estimates from our baseline models (including resource sharing terms) when run on the two subsamples; all of our results are robust to controlling for whether the pair in question had, in the immediate prior period, invested in the same industry segment or same geography segment (MSA).14  \n\nFig. 3 summarizes the results in Table 5. The subsample results are broadly similar to the main results, with two important differences. First, the access for capital trade is statistically significant only for repeat ties. Second, experience does not have a statistically significant impact on repeat ties and the statistical significance of investment scope is less. One interpretation for these differences is a fixed assets effect: once formed, relationships may persist even if the characteristics of the underlying firms change, and this effect may drive coefficients to zero. In particular, as opposed to access, scope, or capital, which may or may not change over time, experience must necessarily change for firms as they move from one five-year period to the next.For the resource sharing terms,we observe far less resource sharing than in the full sample, and no negative resource sharing. Here, capital trades with experience only in the specification for the valued tie measure, though it continues, as in the full sample, to trade with access in both specifications. In contrast to the full sample, we see no negative resource sharing on the pairs (capital availability, access) and (access, investment scope), suggesting that the ‘smart skills/dumb money' trade is not a significant driver of tie formation when a tie between the parties existed in a previous time period. As with the singleresource patterns, we can interpret the differences between the results for the repeat ties subsample as consistent with relationships being fixed assets for firms with changing characteristics over time.  \n\nNext, it is reasonable to posit that tie formation may be facilitated by the underlying organizational social network formed by co-investment activities. For example, forming ties based on indirect network ties, e.g., with a friend of a friend, might play a role. We test for the role of indirect network formation by examining the subsample of VCpairs that are indirectly linked (friends-of-friends), and the subsample of VC-firm-pairs that do not share an indirect link.Table6 presents estimates of the modelsfor tie existence and tie strength for the subsample of VC-firmpairs that have indirect ties, and those that do not. As in previous analysis, all of our estimated results are robust to the inclusion of the controls for both VCs in the pair having previously invested in the same industry or geography segment.  \n\nFig. 4 summarizes the one- and two-resource hypothesis tests. The patterns of network formation for indirectly linked VC-firm-pairs(friends-of-friends)are qualitatively similar to those observed in the full sample. One difference is that matching on the experience factor, while still taking the form of anti-similarity, differs across the two subsamples. In the friends-of-friends subsample, matches are more frequent when the stronger (i.e., more experienced) of the two firms in the pair gets even stronger, whereas in the not friends-offriends subsample, matches are less frequent when the weaker (i.e., less experienced) of the two firms in the pair gets even weaker. The full sample had both effects. For the resource sharing terms, we observe not only the patterns evidentinthefullsample,but alsotheadditionof significant negative resource sharing between experience and investment scope among firms without indirect ties, lending further support to the 'smart skills trade for dumb money' interpretation of the full-sample estimates.15  \n\n### 4.2. Interpretation and discussion  \n\nIn the description of the empirical estimates above, we deferred discussion of relative magnitudes for the effects on the latent gains function and associated probabilities. To more concretely translate factors and observable characteristics to outcomes,in this section we evaluate the effects of varying factor endowments and of varying the observable characteristics underlying the factor analysis on the probability of pairing.  \n\nWe begin by comparing the probability of a pairing between two VCs with average endowments of each factor to pairings in which we vary a particular factor by one standard deviation for one of the VCs in the pair. Based on the estimates in Table 4, column 1, the probability of two averageVCspairingis $14.51\\%$ .Column 1 of Table7 reports the probability of a VC with a single factor endowment reduced by one standard deviation and average endowments across all other factors pairing with a VC with average endowments across all factors. Column 2 reports the probability of a VC with a single factor endowment increased by one standard deviation and average endowments across all other factors pairing with a VC with average endowments across all factors. Since the two VCs in the pair will have the same average endowments in three of the four factors, the resource sharing terms will not affect the probabilities.  \n\nAs discussed previously, the experience resource appears to enhance ties between dissimilar partners (antisimilarity). Thus, reducing the endowment of experience for the lower-endowed of the pair increases the probability of pairing slightly (the one-standard deviation reduction in the experience factor changes the probability of the pairing to $15.27\\%$ , as does raising the endowment of the more highly endowed of the pair (the one-standard deviation increase changes the probability of the pairing to $16.32\\%$ .Theoverall effect of having one VC of the pair move from a low endowment (minus one standard deviation） to a high endowment of experience(plus one standard deviation）is modest, an increase of approximately one percentage point.  \n\nIn contrast, access and scope both exhibit traits indicative of cumulative advantage. Lowering the endowment of either of these resources for one of the VCs in the pairing reduces the probability of a match substantially (to $5.68\\%$ and $10.69\\%$ respectively), and increasing the endowment increases the probability (to $20.89\\%$ and $18.8\\%$ respectively). Recall that the single-resource estimates suggest that the capital factor exhibits evidence of a tension between cumulative advantage and similarity-based matching. From the probabilities in Table 7, we see that when lowering the capital endowment of a VC in the pair the probability of pairing decreases dramatically to $2.92\\%$ whereasincreasing theendowment leaves the probability of a pairing with an averagely endowed VC virtually unchanged.  \n\nIn columns 4 through 6 we perform similar computations, but rather than varying the factor endowments, we instead vary the (normalized) observable characteristics that load strongly for each factor by one standard deviation. All other characteristics for these (hypothetical) VCs are held at the sample mean. For this calculation, we consider factors with loadings (Table 2) of 0.66 and above as strong, corresponding to a natural break in our observed  \n\nPanel A of the table reports estimated coefficients from pair-level models of whether a pair of Vc firms in the network forms a tie for the subsample of VC-firm-pairs that are ‘friends-of-friends,' i.e., who share a tie with a third party $\\scriptstyle{N=706,927},$ , and the subsample of VC-firm-pairs that do not share such an indirect tie ( $N{=}380{,}445\\$ . The observation is a VC firm-pair-year. In columns 1 and 3 the dependent variable is an indicator variable taking the value of one if the pair of VC firms has a tie in the undirected network matrix, and zero otherwise. In column 2 and 4, the dependent variable is the valued tie measure, which weights the binary tie indicator by the number of deals underlying the network link. Columns 1 and 3 are estimated via probit regression; columns 2 and 4 are estimated via Tobit regression. All results are robust to adding controls for both firms in the pair having past investments in the same industry orgeography segment.We calculate the sums, absolute differences, and resource sharing terms for each VC-pair in a given yearusing the scoring coefficients from the factor analysis presented in Table 2. Year indicators are included but not reported. Standard errors are robust heteroskedasticityconsistent and clustered two-way by VC firm, and are presented in parentheses below the coefficients.

For robustness, we consider other thresholds such as 0.5 and 0.7 and obtain qualitatively similar results. To provide a more direct comparison to variation in the factors, we include only the single-resource effects in the calculation. Because many of these observable characteristics are correlated, the realized values for all factors change as we vary the characteristics for each single factor's primary characteristics. For example, because proxies for experience (e.g., age) and proxies for access (e.g.,centrality) are positively correlated in-sample but the underlying factors are orthogonal, increasing proxies for experience and holding other observables constant will increase the experience factor but decrease the access factor. This in turn will affect the gains function and probability of a pairing not only through an increased experienceendowment,butalsothroughareducedaccess endowment. Since the coefficient estimates on terms for the access factor are many times greater than those for the experience factor, the net effect of varying characteristics related to time-in-existence may be related more to a decrease in the access factor rather than an increase in experience factor.  \n\nAs seen in Table 7, varying the characteristics that load on the experience factor results in an increase in the probability of pairing when reducing endowments by one standard deviation, just as it did when reducing the factor itself by one standard deviation.However, the probability is also reduced when endowments relating to time-in-existence are all increased by one standard deviation, resulting in a negative overall change. This makes sense given the strong  \n\nThis table presents the probability of a pairing between hypothetical VC firms with particular endowments in factors and characteristics based on estimates in Table 4, column 1. Variation by a single standard deviation in each direction for single-resource factors and characteristics are computed for each VC matching with an average VC. The probability of a pairing between two average VC firms is $14.51\\%$ For resource sharing,wecompute the probability of pairing with and without resource sharing for a VC evaluated with a one-standard deviation increase in one resource and a decrease of one standard deviation in a second resource pairing with a‘mirror-image' VC that has an increase of one standard deviation in the second resource and a decrease of one standard deviation in the first (and all other factors and characteristics evaluated at the average). For the characteristics calculations, we vary characteristics with loadings above 0.66, corresponding to a natural break in our data, and keep other characteristics at the sample means. The factor analysis can be found in Table 2.  \n\nTable 7 Implied probabilities.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"3\">Variationbased onfactors</td><td colspan=\"3\">Variation based on characteristics</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"7\">Panel A:Single-resourcevariation</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Minus 1 standard</td><td>Plus 1 standard</td><td>Difference</td><td>Minus 1 standard</td><td>Plus 1 standard</td><td>Difference</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>deviation</td><td>deviation</td><td></td><td>deviation</td><td>deviation</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Experience Access</td><td>15.27% 5.68%</td><td>16.32% 20.89%</td><td>1.05% 15.21%</td><td>16.28% 4.89%</td><td>12.81% 19.15%</td><td>-3.47% 14.26%</td></tr><tr><td>Capital</td><td>2.92%</td><td>14.21%</td><td>11.29%</td><td>2.53%</td><td>13.17%</td><td>10.65%</td></tr><tr><td>Scope</td><td>10.69%</td><td>18.80%</td><td>8.11%</td><td>11.06%</td><td>15.48%</td><td>4.42%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"7\">PanelB:Resourcepairvariation</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Directeffects (no trading)</td><td>Total effects (with trading)</td><td>Difference</td><td>Direct effects (no trading)</td><td>Total effects (with trading)</td><td>Difference</td></tr><tr><td>Experience/Access</td><td>11.00%</td><td>7.47%</td><td>-3.53%</td><td>9.22%</td><td>4.24%</td><td>- 4.97%</td></tr><tr><td>Experience/Capital</td><td>3.62%</td><td>7.54%</td><td>3.93%</td><td>2.40%</td><td>7.42%</td><td>5.01%</td></tr><tr><td>Experience/Scope</td><td>16.79%</td><td>17.16%</td><td>0.37%</td><td>15.11%</td><td>15.65%</td><td>0.54%</td></tr><tr><td>Access/Capital</td><td>1.45%</td><td>1.73%</td><td>0.28%</td><td>0.74%</td><td>1.00%</td><td>0.27%</td></tr><tr><td>Access/Scope</td><td>8.87%</td><td>8.29%</td><td>-0.58%</td><td>6.45%</td><td>5.39%</td><td>-1.06%</td></tr><tr><td>Capital/Scope</td><td>2.75%</td><td>4.00%</td><td>1.25%</td><td>1.74%</td><td>3.19%</td><td>1.45%</td></tr><tr><td>Low cap-high val. add /High cap-low val. add</td><td>1.84%</td><td>4.21%</td><td>2.37%</td><td>0.76%</td><td>3.19%</td><td>2.43%</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\neffects of cumulative advantage for access (and scope). Also, varying characteristics relating to scope leads to a smaller predicted change in probability relative to what happens when we vary the scope factor itself. This is driven by a similar reduction in the access endowment.16  \n\nTo gauge magnitudes of the effects on the latent gains function and associated probabilities from resource trading, we construct hypothetical VCs for each factor-pair evaluated less one standard deviation and plus one standard deviation from the mean, with average endowments in the other two factors. For each resource pair, we consider the magnitude of the gains from trade between two VCs, with the first VC having a lower endowment on one factor and a higher endowment on the other and the other VC endowed in the reverse.As before,we also perform the computations varying characteristics that load on each factor rather than factor levels themselves,with similar results.  \n\nTo better understand and isolate the effects of trade, we illustrate with an example the joint role of single-resource endowments and the capital sharing result implied by the resource pair tests. Consider the gains from tying for two  \n\nVCs with differing endowments in capital and experience. Using the results in Table 4 and substituting zeroes for statistically insignificant coefficients for illustration purposes (and recalling that $\\beta_{M A X}=\\beta_{S}+\\beta_{D}$ and $\\beta_{M I N}=$ $\\beta_{S}-\\beta_{D})$ wehave  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{g(i,j)=0.078\\times\\operatorname*{max}(E_{i},E_{j})+0\\times\\operatorname*{min}(E_{i},E_{j})}\\ &{\\qquad+0\\times\\operatorname*{max}(C_{i},C_{j})+0.8834\\times\\operatorname*{min}(C_{i},C_{j})}\\ &{\\qquad+0.0978[(E_{i}-E_{j})(C_{j}-C_{i})]^{+}+\\{\\mathrm{other~terms}\\},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $E$ is the experience factor and $C$ is the capital factor. Since the factors are normalized to be mean zero and standard deviation one, we examine $E_{i}=C_{j}=-1$ and $E_{j}=C_{i}=1$  \n\nConsider first the direct effects of experience and capital as single resources, as discussed above. Because $j$ is more experienced, gains are higher by 0.078; because i is less experienced, gains are lower by O; the net direct effect of experience is $+0.078$ . Because i has more capital, gains are higher by O; because $j$ has less capital, gains are lower by 0.8834; the net direct effect of capital is $-0.8834$ As previously discussed, both of these changes reflect cumulative advantage: gains are higher because one firm has more experience and lower because onefirmhas less capital. Because the capital effect is so much larger than the experience effect, gains from the pairing as a whole are lower by $0.078-0.8834=-0.8054$ .Now we examine the resource sharing effect. Since $[(E_{i}-E_{j})(C_{j}-C_{i})]^{+}=4$ gains increaseby $0.0978\\times4=0.3912$ . This effect is larger than the direct effect of experience but smaller than the direct effect of capital. The resource sharing effect is both economically meaningful and positive while, simultaneously,firmswhoseresource endowments are such that they might trade capital and experience have a lower propensityto match than twofirms both with endowments equal to the mean.  \n\nComputations for the resource pairs are tabulated in Panel B of Table 7. We also include computations for the pairing of a VC with a high endowment in all of the valueadded resources and a low endowment of capital with a VC endowed in the reverse (i.e., having high levels of available capital and low levels of the three value-added resources). In the absence of resource sharing, varying the endowments of resources as described above results in a lower probabilityof a matchbetweentwoVC firms relative to two average VC firms,for all resource pairs except experience/scope. To gauge the economic significance of resource trading, therefore, we compare the probability of a pairing between VCs implied by the full model with a base case for which resource sharing coefficients are zero.  \n\nFor the VC-pair differently endowed with experience and capital,the probability of a match is $3.62\\%$ if we consider only single-resource effects. Once the effects of trade are considered, the probability increases to $7.54\\%$ The effects of capital trading with scope are also influential, with an increase in probability from $2.75\\%$ based on direct effects only, to $4\\%$ with the full model. Potential trade among value-added resource pairs decreases the probability of a match, with the (experience/access) pair reducing the probability from $11\\%$ to $7.47\\%$ ,and (access/ scope) reducing the probability from $8.87\\%$ to $8.29\\%$ .When we consider variation in observable characteristics instead of factors, the changes are enhanced but similar in magnitude. For a high-value-added, low-capital VC matching with ‘dumb money' the probability climbs from $1.84\\%$ $(0.76\\%)$ from direct effects alone to $4.21\\%$ $(3.19\\%)$ with resource sharing when wevarythe resource factors (underlying characteristics). Conditional on resource endowments, there is a substantial role for trade.  \n\nIn sum, we see little evidence that the preference for resource similarity is a primary driver of ties in the VC network. This finding suggests that agency considerations may not be first-order in determining which partners are selected by a VC firm from the network. This finding also stands in stark contrast to the large literature describing social networks,in which people tend to form ties with people who are similar to them (McPherson, Smith-Lovin, and Cook, 2001).17 Further, the lack of similarity-based matching implies that capacity constraints are not binding in this setting. Rather, we see evidence that in forming economic ties, VC firms on the one hand appear to gain most from ties with partner firms who are highly endowed with access and investment scope, regardless of the firm's own endowment of these resources, and exhibit antisimilarity tendencies in choosing partners on endowments of experience. Our findings support theoretical arguments that partnerships may be formed to accumulate higher levels of resources required by the production function. The only evidence of a preference for similarity is in the formation of ties across the capital availability resource, though this too exhibits a tension with simply preferring a more-highly endowed partner. Finally, VC firms appear to gain most from trade when one firm is highly endowed in value-added abilities and the other has a high endowment of capital availability, again supporting the notion of resource accumulation.  \n\n## 5. Conclusion  \n\nIn this paper, we develop a rigorous methodology to infer the underlying motives for the formation of ties between particular sets of partners in a network, thus informing the relative importance of agency cost and resourceaccumulationconsiderationsintheformationof economic ties. To the best of our knowledge, our work provides the first formalized tests to disentangle existing underlying economic explanations for organizational tie formation.  \n\nOur methodology builds an empirical model of the gains from forming a tie between two firms. Using the assumption that ties aremostlikely formed when the anticipated net gains from doing so are higher, we employ latent variable models to study the economic drivers of network tie formation across organizations. With venture capital syndication networks as our test setting, we employ factor analysis to extract the main patterns of variation in firm characteristics and identify a set of resources for our analysis. We find four significant, orthogonal resource factors, all of which have intuitive interpretations: experience, access, capital availability, and investment scope.  \n\nOverall, our findings suggest that concerns over agency conflicts are not a primary concern in the formation of VC syndication networks, as we find little evidence of preferences for similarity as the primary driver of partnership formation. Instead, these concerns appear to be dominated by a desire for resource accumulation.  \n\nWhile we find that firms do appear to trade resources in forming economic ties in the co-investment network, such resource sharing is not generic: capital availability appears to trade with experience and access, but resources related to the value-added capacity of the VC do not appear to be traded for one another. Rather, we find that a particularly beneficial trade is a tie formed between one firm who is endowed with high levels of all of experience, access, and investment scope, and a second firm who is endowed with little of these resources, but high levels of capital availability. Thus, capital can exist outside the firm and be combined effectively with inside expertise or value-added, but the same does not apply to combinations of  inside-the-firm  and  outside-the-firm  value-added resources.  \n\nOur work opens some interesting questions and avenues for future research.First and foremost is whether the patterns we identify generalize to other economic networks, particularly in settings where interactions are less frequent and less likely to be repeated (and thus, where agency concerns may be more influential).Second,the motivations typically ascribed to the formation of ties in organizationalsettings mayalsoberelevantinsocial networks. Future research analyzing social ties which considers the competing influences we identify would be useful. Finally, our approach of employing factor analysis to capture orthogonal resources suggests a solution to the standard problem of making inferences on loose proxies for an underlying characteristic of interest. In research areas where multiple characteristics of an economic actor may actually be reflections of a more fundamental unobservable attribute (such as ‘quality’ for a VC firm), the extenttowhich existingconclusionsarerobust to the use of orthogonalized attributes or factors is an area forfurther exploration.  \n\n## References  \n\nAi, C., Norton, E.C., 2003.
