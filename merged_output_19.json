Using micro-data on the universe of French manufacturing exporters over 1995-2007, I show that a measure of export demand growth exogenous to firm-level outcomes drives down the manufacturing labor share through two effects. First, foreign demand shocks allow low-labor share, highly internationalized \"superstar\" exporters to grow disproportionately more. Second, foreign demand growth decreases the labor share of exporters and this effect is stronger for larger exporters. Both effects explain $12\\%$ of the labor share decline 0ver 1995-2000 and led to a 1.2 percentage point drop over 2000-2007. A simple model of endogenous competition with heterogeneous firms rationalizes the findings. A market size increase allows exporters to expand, which decreases their share of fixed labor cost in value-added, and increases competition on international markets. Fiercer competition favors superstar exporters, further decreasing their labor share through the fixed cost channel. Overall, these findings provide direct causal evidence of a \"winner take most\" phenomenon induced by trade globalization.  \n\n# 1 Introduction  \n\nThe manufacturing value-added labor share has experienced changes in several OECD countries in recent decades.1 This phenomenon casts doubt on the future of work and its value.2 The causes of the evolution of the labor share, however, remain uncertain.3 While international trade has been put forward as an explanation for labor share changes, the only mechanism highlighted in the literature is increased import exposure (Elsby et al., 2013). It is likely that the export side of trade, which refers to changes in demand conditions on foreign markets,4 also causes changes in the manufacturing labor share. On the one hand, an increase in foreign demand could increase or decrease the labor share of firms depending on the relative response of labor compensation and value-added. On the other hand, an increase in foreign demand could favor firms with a low labor share, decreasing the aggregate labor share through compositional changes. In a recent paper, Autor et al. (2020) show that the labor share decline is explained by the rise of \"superstar firms\", which have a low labor share. However, the precise origins behind the reallocation of sales towards large players remain to be uncovered. In this article, I use detailed micro-data on the universe of French exporters over 1995-2007 to highlight a new trade determinant of changes in the manufacturing labor share and show that it generates reallocation forces as hypothesized by Autor et al. (2020).5  \n\nThe contribution of the article is threefold. First, I provide causal empirical evidence that an increase in foreign demand decreases the labor share at home through two effects. Foreign demand growth generates intensive margin reallocations towards lowlabor share, more internationalized \"superstar\" exporters (between-exporter effect). Foreign demand growth also drives down exporters' labor share and the effect is stronger for superstar exporters (within-between exporter effect). Importantly, my framework makes it possible to disentangle the effect of foreign demand shocks from other firm-level changes affecting a firm's growth rate and its labor share, such as automation, outsourcing and offshoring. Second, I provide some back-of-the-envelope calculation to assess the magnitude of both between and within-between exporter effects. This exercise sheds quantitative light on the effect of export demand on the labor share. Third, I investigate the channels behind the labor share changes and show that the results are consistent with increased competition on international markets. My findings thus point to a previously unexplored dimension of labor share changes and establish a direct causation link with the \"winner take most\" mechanism of Autor et al. (2020).  \n\nUsing French balance-sheet and customs data 0ver 1995-2007, I document three facts for the manufacturing sector. The labor share experiences a decline over 1995-2007: it decreases 0ver 1995-2000 and starts increasing 0ver 2000-2007.6 Second, decomposing the change in the labor share into a within-firm, between-firm and entry-exit margin,7 I find that the reallocation of output towards low labor share firms drives down the labor share, consistent with recent evidence for the US (Autor et al., 2020; Kehrig and Vincent, 2018).8 Third, I show that more internationalized exporters have a lower labor share, especially those that sell more internationally. Taken jointly, these facts suggest that a reallocation of value-added towards superstar exporters generated by export demand shocks has the potential to generate changes in the aggregate labor share. Moreover, the use of goodquality micro data for France provides additional external validity to the existence of a reallocation effect towards low-labor share firms.  \n\nEmpirically, I study whether foreign demand growth impacts the value-added growth rate of firms and their labor share differently depending on their degree of internationalization.9 To do so, I rely on a shift-share identification strategy. The foreign demand measure uses the fact that firms initially have a different export basket and export different goods to different countries. Changes in imports from the rest of the world excluding France affect firms differently, depending on their initial exposure to foreign markets.  \n\nThis firm-level foreign demand measure is exogenous to firm-level decisions that could impact their growth rate or labor share, such as the decision to offshore, outsource or automate. The most important empirical finding is that the effect of foreign demand growth on exporters' value-added growth rate and labor share is heterogeneous. More specifically, I find that top sellers on international markets grow faster whereas less internationalized exporters shrink, following an increase in foreign demand. I also find that exporters experience a decrease in their labor share following an export demand shock, and this negative effect is magnified for top exporters. Although labor compensation increases with foreign demand, the labor share goes down because of the disproportionate rise of value-added. These results highlight the existence of intensive margin reallocations towards superstar exporters. The results do not appear to be driven by confounding factors such as automation, offshoring, outsourcing, by the choice of sample or specification, by the definition of superstar exporters, or by the existence of pre-trends.  \n\nI examine the quantitative impact of export demand on the manufacturing labor share. Both between and within-between exporter effects generate a 1.4 percentage point labor share decline over 1995-2007. This change is almost entirely driven by the within-between exporter effect. Focusing on 1995-2000, I find that both effects explain $12\\%$ of theobserved labor share decline. Over 2000-2007, both effects generate a 1.2 percentage point drop, implying that the observed labor share increase would have been stronger had export demand not risen. In exploring the importance of superstar exporters in driving the results, I further find that roughly half of the magnitude of the within-between exporter effect is driven by larger exporters experiencing a stronger labor share decline and by the top $1\\%$ of superstar exporters. In other words, intensive margin reallocations towards large players on international markets are key to understanding the role played by export demand growth in shaping the aggregate labor share.  \n\nFinally, I rely on a monopolistic competition model with heterogeneous firms and endogenous competition to understand why foreign demand shocks decrease firm-level labor shares and why superstar exporters experience a larger labor share decline. In the model, the price elasticity of demand decreases with consumption, a case long recognized to be the most plausible by Marshall (1890) and Krugman (1979).10 The labor share of firms is pinned down by their markup and by their share of fixed labor cost in valueadded: an increase in market power or a decrease in the share of fixed labor cost in valueadded results in declining firm-level labor shares.11 A foreign demand increase generates two counteracting forces on firms' profits: the positive effect arising from the increase in market size is counterbalanced by a negative effect caused by an increase in competition arising from the entry of new firms on the foreign market. The direct market size effect dominates for larger firms, while the indirect competition effect dominates for smaller firms. Larger firms can therefore expand with respect to smaller firms that squeeze. The rise in competition on international markets decreases firm-level markups and implies that declining labor shares can only be explained by the fixed cost channel.12 Superstar exporters experience a stronger labor share decline because they grow relatively more and thus experience a greater decline in their share of fixed labor cost in value-added.  \n\ncandidate explanation for the labor share decline in the US. My paper differs from theirs in that I instead focus on the role of export demand using micro-data. Furthermore, my empirical framework allows me to disentangle the effect of export demand from that of technology. Finally, in a series of papers, De Loecker et al. (2020) and De Loecker and Eeckhout (2018) show that rising aggregate markups driven by the growth of highmarkup firms and an increase in their markup are consistent with the US labor share decline. The negative correlation that I find between the degree of internationalization of firms and their labor share is consistent with larger exporters having higher markups in the cross-section because of Marshall's Second Law of Demand. The disproportionate growth of superstar exporters caused by foreign demand shocks is thus consistent with a rise in manufacturing markups driven by high-markup superstar exporters.  \n\nRecent papers have revived the idea that the demand elasticity is not constant across firms and more specifically, that it decreases with consumption, a case deemed \"plausible\" by Krugman (1979). This has important consequences as an increase in market size generates intensive margin reallocation effects favoring larger firms because of the endogenous response of competition (Zhelobodko et al., 2012; Mrazova and Neary, 2017). I build on these papers for the theoretical framework. My paper is also related to Mayer et al. (2020). Their focus, however, is on how reallocations of export sales across products within multi-product firms generate aggregate productivity growth.16 I am instead interested in how foreign demand shocks generate reallocations across firms and highlight the heterogeneous response of firms′ growth rate and labor share to foreign demand changes. I further quantify the importance of both effects in generating aggregate labor share changes. My results are also consistent with aggregate productivity gains, as superstar exporters are larger and more productive.  \n\nParenti et al. (2017) argue that \"it is time to pay more attention to the demand side\". Indeed, recent evidence by Hottman et al. (2016) stress the importance of demand in determining firm size. They find that $80\\%$ of firm growth is caused by firm \"appeal\" which loosely refers to demand (differences in tastes or quality). My paper also highlights the importance of foreign demand growth in generating value-added growth favoring more internationalized firms. Aghion et al. (2018) document the role of foreign demand growth on patenting at the firm level and show that initially more productive firms patent more. My paper differs from theirs is that my focus is on providing an alternative mechanism for the evolution of the labor share through between and within-firm changes. My results, if anything, are short-term effects while innovation is a longer-run phenomenon. Their findings, however, could reinforce my key finding. Foreign demand growth might also contribute to reallocating value-added shares towards superstar exporters through innovation, as larger exporters are more likely to innovate.  \n\nThe rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data sources and the stylized facts. Section 3 describes the identification strategy and empirical framework. Section 4 presents the results and robustness tests. Section 5 examines the magnitude of the effect while Section 6 investigates the mechanism behind the labor share changes. Section 7 concludes.  \n\n# 2 Data and Stylized Facts  \n\n## 2.1 Data Sources and Sample  \n\nI use two main sources of micro data: balance-sheet and customs data. Each firm in France is assigned a unique identifier (\"SIREN\" code), which facilitates keeping track of them over time and matching firm-level datasets.  \n\nThe balance-sheet data contain the universe of French firms. I keep both large and small firms. This classification is based on a firm's tax regime: the Regime of Normal Real Profits (BRN) applies to large firms while the Simplified Regime for the Self-Employed (RSI) applies to smaller companies. BRN contains firms with annual sales above 763K euros (230K euros for services) whereas smaller firms included in RSI sell at least 76.3K euros (but less than 763K euros) a year and more than 27K euros for services. This dataset has been used in previous studies, for instance in Di Giovanni et al. (2014) and I refer to their paper for more details. Given the focus of the paper, I only keep firms that operate in the manufacturing sector (sector 15 to 37 in NAF Rev. 1). This exhaustive database allows me to build a firm's labor share and all other relevant variables that will be used in the empirical framework. I also rely on customs data. They contain information on a firm's export sales and export quantities of each product defined at the 8-digit level towards each destination country in a given year. I use this additional data source to recover information on the number of products exported by each firm in a given year, the number of foreign countries served, the total amount of expenditures spent on imports and total export sales. More information on the sample selection procedure and on the variables used can be found in Appendix A. My sample of French manufacturing exporters spans the period 1995-2007.17 Exporters are representative of overall changes in manufacturing.  \n\nIndeed, exporting firms are the largest firms operating in manufacturing (Bernard et al., 2007), and represent $74\\%$ of the sector's total value-added. Moreover, they are the only firms for which foreign demand shocks can be defined. I will therefore use the term \"firm\" or \"exporter\" interchangeably, unless explicitly stated.  \n\n## 2.2  Stylized Facts  \n\nI now document the evolution of the labor share in French manufacturing. I then decompose this change into different margins and document the fact that larger, more internationalized exporters have a lower labor share.  \n\nLabor share and trade flows. Given the focus of the paper, the labor share or aggregate labor share refers to the manufacturing labor share, not the economy-wide labor share. It is defined as the ratio of total labor compensation (including employers′ contributions to social security etc.) to gross value-added. Figure 1 highlights the evolution of the labor share in the French manufacturing sector over 1995-2007 for my sample of exporting firms. The French manufacturing labor share experiences a 0.35 percentage point decline over the period. Interestingly, it decreases up until 2000 and experiences an increase over the 2000-2007 period. The pattern is very similar using macro data from EU KLEMS, as displayed in Figure A2.18 19 Finally, I note that the drop in the manufacturing labor share is a within-industry phenomenon. As shown in Figure A3 in the Appendix, the decline occurs in all industries within manufacturing and is not due to a reallocation towards low labor share industries.  \n\nOn the trade side, Figure A4 displays the evolution of export sales. Exports have considerably increased over the period averaging about $4\\%$ annually 0ver 1995-2007. This sharp increase in exports is plausibly caused by an increase in foreign demand and I will later use a direct measure of foreign demand to study how foreign demand growth affects the aggregate labor share. Figure A5 shows the exports of goods and services in percentage of GDP. This ratio steadily increases over the period.20  \n\nDecomposition of labor share changes. Denoting labor compensation by wL and valueadded by VA, the aggregate labor share $\\mathrm{L}S_{t}$ also writes as a weighted average of firms' labor share, weighted by their share in total value-added  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{LS}_{t}=\\frac{\\sum_{i}w L_{i t}}{\\mathrm{VA}_{t}}=\\sum_{i}\\omega_{i t}\\mathrm{LS}_{i t}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\omega_{i t}$ is firm i's value-added share in total manufacturing value-added at time $t$  \n\nI decompose the change in the labor share from one year to the next into the contribution of surviving firms, new entrants and exiters.21 To do so, I use a decomposition method initially developed by Baily et al. (1992) and refined in Foster et al. (2001) (FHK). This decomposition is extremely tractable and will be used to compute the magnitude of the effect of export demand growth on the aggregate labor share. The manufacturing labor share change between any two time periods is given by:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\Delta\\mathrm{LS}_{t}=\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in\\mathrm{S}}\\omega_{i t-1}\\left(\\mathrm{LS}_{i t}-\\mathrm{LS}_{i t-1}\\right)+\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in\\mathrm{S}}\\left(\\omega_{i t}-\\omega_{i t-1}\\right)\\left(\\mathrm{LS}_{i t-1}-\\mathrm{LS}_{t-1}\\right)}\\ &{\\qquad+\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in\\mathrm{S}}\\left(\\omega_{i t}-\\omega_{i t-1}\\right)\\left(\\mathrm{LS}_{i t}-\\mathrm{LS}_{i t-1}\\right)+\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in\\mathrm{ENT}}\\omega_{i t}\\left(\\mathrm{LS}_{i t}-\\mathrm{LS}_{t-1}\\right)}\\ &{\\qquad-\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in\\mathrm{E}\\mathrm{XT}}\\omega_{i t-1}\\left(\\mathrm{LS}_{i t-1}-\\mathrm{LS}_{t-1}\\right)}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathrm{L}S_{t-1}$ is the aggregate labor share in the previous year, also called the reference labor share level. The first term of (2) is the within-firm effect, the second and third terms are the between-firm (reallocation) component while the last two terms are the contribution of entry and exit, respectively.22 Equation (2) states that the manufacturing labor share can decrease for several reasons. A negative within-firm effect means that surviving firms experience a decrease in their labor share. A negative between-firm effect means that output is reallocated towards low-labor share survivors so that these firms become larger. Crucially, output corresponds to value-added from the definition of the labor share given in (1) so that the value-added growth of low-labor share firms can drive down the labor share. The contribution of entrants and exiters is allowed to be positive or negative. This depends on whether their labor share is higher than the reference labor share level.  \n\nI make use of the FHK decomposition to study which margin drives the change in the labor share over the period of interest. To do so, I apply (2) to each year interval, namely 1995-1996, 1996-1997 etc.  \n\nFigure 2 presents the result of this decomposition and shows the cumulative change in each component over time. The blue line represents the aggregate change while the blue dotted line represents the contribution of the between-firm component. The black full line and the red dashed line represent the contribution of the within-firm component and entry-exit, respectively. The blue dotted line is always negative and keeps decreasing over time. The overall small decrease in the labor share is explained by a reallocation towards low labor share firms, suggesting that the key message of Autor et al. (2020) also holds for French manufacturing over 1995-2007. The contribution of entry and exit is aggregated and is stable over the period. The within firm effect is positive and contributes to increasing the manufacturing labor share. This is consistent with Table A1 that shows that firms, on average, experience an increase in their labor share. Interestingly, in the US over 1982-2012, Autor et al. (2020) document that the within-firm component is negative and that the reallocation term is larger in magnitude than the within-firm one. In France, however, the within-firm effect is strongly positive and almost cancels out the strong reallocation effect towards low-labor share exporters over the whole 1995-2007 period. The between-firm component is responsible for the labor share decline over 1995-2000, while the within-firm component explains its increase 0ver 2000-2007.23 The results for each year interval are displayed in Table 1. The qualitative finding of this decomposition is unaltered when considering the Melitz and Polanec (2015) decomposition method as shown in Table A3. The description of that method is relegated to Appendix B.  \n\nFact 2: The reallocation of value-added shares towards low-labor share firms drives down the labor share. The within-firm component increases the labor share.  \n\nInternationalization and labor share. I now document that low-labor share firms are more internationalized.  \n\nTable 2 displays the labor share of firms whose log export sales, export intensity, log number of products exported and log number of destinations served is above the median, in the top $25\\%$ $10\\%$ and $1\\%$ of each corresponding distribution. The figures in the table show that more internationalized exporters have a lower labor share. For example, firms in the top $1\\%$ of the export sales distribution have a labor share that is about 11 percentage points lower than firms in the top $50\\%$ . This pattern is true regardless of the internationalization measure used,24 but is particularly exacerbated for firms in the top of the export sales distribution. I will therefore use this measure as the key measure of internationalization for my baseline results and will show that the results are qualitatively unchanged when considering other internationalization measures. Table A4 tests the difference in mean between the labor share of firms with an internationalization measure above and below a certain threshold and confirms the finding that more internationalized exporters have a lower labor share. In columns 1 to 4 of Table A5, I regress a firm's labor share on the four internationalization measures, controlling for the industry composition and supply and demand shocks occurring at the 2-digit sectoral level. I further control for firm-specific, time-invariant characteristics. This shows that an increase in openness compared to the firm mean leads to a lower labor share. Column 5 shows that the sign on log export sales and export intensity remain the same in the multivariate regression. Column 6 shows that this result survives the inclusion of total firm sales. Finally, I show in Table A6 that defining labor as \"labor-plus-capital\" (Alvarez and Lucas Jr, 2007; di Giovanni et al., 2018) and computing the labor share as the ratio of value-added to total sales yields very similar results. This alternative measure, which reflects all primary factors of production, also decreases with the degree of internationalization of firms.  \n\nThese pieces of evidence lead to the same conclusion. There exists a strong negative relationship between a firm's degree of internationalization and its labor share, and this is particularly true for firms at the top of the export sales distribution.  \n\nFact 3: More internationalized exporters have a lower labor share. This is especially true for exporters at the top of the export sales distribution.  \n\n# 3 Empirical Framework  \n\nThis section presents the identification strategy and empirical framework I rely on to study the effect of foreign demand changes on the manufacturing labor share.  \n\n## 3.1 Identification Strategy  \n\nWorld import demand shocks are used as a source of exogenous changes to a firm's foreign demand as in Hummels et al. (2014), Berman et al. (2015) and Mayer et al. (2020).25 This measure is exogenous to other firm-level determinants of a firm's growth rate and labor share, such as outsourcing, automation, offshoring.  \n\nThe growth rate of each foreign country's imports of each product is weighted by that firm's export share for that specific product and destination country. Averaging across products and countries gives a firm-level measure of changes in demand conditions on foreign markets.26 As an illustrative example, Figure A6 shows that these foreign demand shocks will capture the expansion of the BRIC countries or the rise of Eastern-Europe following the 2004 European enlargement.27 In order to build these firm-level demand shocks, I use French customs data and the BACI database (Gaulier and Zignago, 2010). A product is defined at the HS6 level as this is the lowest level of disaggregation in BACI. The customs data allow me to map each firm's exports into this product classification as the NC8 category's six first digits exactly correspond to the HS6 classification. Therefore, the world import demand component comes from BACI while the weights are built using the customs data. Product codes from the customs data and BACI are harmonized over the period using the procedure detailed in Van Beveren et al. (2012). This allows me to have a consistent set of product categories over 1995-2007.  \n\nMore formally, let us denote by $X_{l j p t}$ the value of exports of a particular product $p$ from country $l$ to country $j$ at time $t$ . The total value of imports of product $p$ by country $j$ in $t$ is defined as  \n\n$$\nM_{j p t}=\\sum_{l\\in L\\backslash\\{{\\mathrm{France}}\\}}X_{l j p t}\n$$  \n\nwhere $M_{j p t}$ is destination country $j^{\\prime}$ s total imports of product $p$ from the rest of the world excluding France.  \n\nThe firm-level foreign demand shock for an exporter $i$ in year $t$ is given by:28  \n\n$$\n\\tilde{\\Delta}\\mathrm{Shock}_{i t}=w_{i t_{0}}\\sum_{j,p}\\frac{X_{i j p t_{0}}}{X_{i t_{0}}}\\frac{M_{j p t}-M_{j p t-1}}{\\frac{1}{2}(M_{j p t}+M_{j p t-1})}\n$$  \n\nChanges in $j^{\\prime}$ s imports of $p$ (the second component of the sum) are weighted by the relativ importanceo firm ' xportsof that produt in the inital year Mio Xipeo. This measure is then scaled by the initial export intensity $w_{i t_{0}}:=X_{i t_{0}}^{*}/S_{i t_{0}}^{*}$ of that firm using the production data, where $X_{i t_{0}}^{*}$ and $S_{i t_{0}}^{*}$ represent firm's initial total export sales and total sales, respectively. This weighting scheme ensures that the foreign demand shocks capture the expansion in foreign markets relative to the French domestic market.  \n\nThe exogeneity of $\\tilde{\\Delta}\\mathrm{Shock}_{i t}$ hinges on two conditions. First, it must be the case that the growth rate of $M_{j p t}$ does not reflect any supply-side shocks arising in France, which Would lead to a rise of French exports to foreign countries and would boost their imports. The fact that aggregate imports of country $j$ have been purged from the French exports rules out this channel. The only source of time series variation I exploit comes from this purged growth rate of imports.29 The second important condition is that the firm-level weights are exogenous. A recent literature aims to identify the conditions under which a shift-share measure such as the one described in (3) is exogenous. Goldsmith-Pinkham et al. (2018) show that the exogeneity of the shift-share hinges on the exogeneity of the weights. The idea is that a firm's initial composition of export sales across products and destinations could have a direct effect on its growth rate or on the evolution of its labor share. In order for the shock not to reflect self-selection of French firms into exporting to booming markets (or conversely, exporting less or not exporting at all to markets experiencing a bust in demand), the weights are defined in the initial year the firm appears in the customs data. Second, I show that the results are robust to including firm fixed effects in the first-differences specifications. These firm trends plausibly absorb the variation in the growth rate of value-added or labor share caused by the initial export structure of the firms. Third, I show that future demand shocks do not predict contemporaneous outcomes, which provides reassuring evidence that the measure is not picking up pre-trends affecting the dependent variables of interest.  \n\nAlthough it is unlikely given the structure of the firm's foreign demand shock detailed above, I will also provide robustness checks to control for the possibility that other timevarying and firm-specific determinants of a firm's growth rate and its labor share might be correlated with changes in that firm's foreign demand. First, changes in a foreign country's demand might be associated with changes in wages or quality improvements. These changes might incentivize firms to offshore more, thereby affecting their growth rate and their labor share. I will control for this possibility by including total firm-level imports to control for offshoring.30 Second, foreign demand changes could be correlated with technological improvements occurring at the firm-level. I will control for the growth rate of capital intensity of firms to control for the fact that firms might automate part of their activity in response to changes in foreign demand, which could affect their growth rate and labor share. I will therefore add a vector of controls $\\mathbf{\\boldsymbol{x}}_{i t},$ which includes the firm's growth rate of imports, growth rate of capital intensity and firm-specific fixed effects. These additional results along with alternative robustness checks are provided in Section 4.3.  \n\n## 3.2 Empirical Specifications  \n\nTo study how foreign demand shocks affect the manufacturing labor share, I make use of the fact that the labor share can be rewritten as a value-added weighted average of individual firms' labor shares from equation (1). I am therefore going to study how foreign demand affects the value-added growth rate of firms and their labor share. The analysis is restricted to firms that survive over at least two periods of time.  \n\nFigure 2 shows that the reallocation of value-added shares towards low-labor share firms drives down the labor share, while Table 2 shows that low-labor share firms are highly internationalized, superstar exporters. To determine whether foreign demand changes can contribute to this between-firm effect, I test whether these changes benefit disproportionately more to superstar exporters. To do so, I estimate the following speci  \n\nfication (between-exporter specification):  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\Delta\\ln\\mathrm{VA}_{i t}=\\alpha^{\\mathrm{Rank}}\\tilde{\\Delta}\\mathrm{Shock}_{i t}+\\beta^{\\mathrm{Rank}}\\tilde{\\Delta}\\mathrm{Shock}_{i t}\\times\\mathrm{Superstar}_{i t_{0}}}\\ {+\\gamma^{\\mathrm{Rank}}\\mathrm{Superstar}_{i t_{0}}+\\Delta\\delta_{k t}+\\xi_{a}w_{i t_{0}}\\times\\psi_{t}+\\Delta\\varepsilon_{i t}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe dependent variable is the growth rate of value-added between $t-1$ and $t$ . The important term is the second one that interacts a firm's foreign demand shock with its degree of internationalization, Superstar $i t_{0}.$ which is defined in the first year in which that firm appears in the sample to avoid endogeneity issues. Superstar $i t_{0}$ is measured by a firm's (log) export sales.31 $\\Delta\\delta_{k t}$ are 2-digit industry by year fixed effects and absorb changes in business cycles conditions or competition shocks occurring at the industry level. Finally, by construction, the firm-level weights used to create the foreign demand shocks do not add up to unity. I therefore control for a firm's initial export intensity interacted with year dummies, as suggested by Borusyak et al. (2018). The specification is expressed in firstdifferences so that all unobserved drivers of a firm's value-added that are time invariant and that might be correlated with that firm's foreign demand (high-quality $\\mathrm{firm},$ good management practices etc.) are wiped out.  \n\nThe impact of foreign demand changes on firm growth is $\\partial\\Delta\\ln\\mathrm{VA}_{i t}/\\partial\\tilde{\\Delta}\\mathrm{Shock}_{i t}=$ $\\alpha^{\\mathrm{Rank}}+\\beta^{\\mathrm{Rank}}\\times{\\mathrm{Superstar}}_{i t_{0}}$ . Absent th interaction erm, one can expet $\\alpha^{\\mathrm{Rank}}>0$ an increase in foreign demand should increase a firm's value-added. The main test is whether $\\beta^{\\mathrm{Rank}}>0$ If this coeffcient is positive, superstar exporters grow relatively more when hit by foreign demand shocks. Note that this elasticity varies across firms, depending on the rank of the firm in the export sales distribution.  \n\nGiven equation (1), I also study how an increase in foreign demand at the firm level impacts the labor share of exporters and how the effect might vary depending on their degree of internationalization (\"within-between\" exporter specification). The dependent variable is the labor share change in percentage points:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\Delta\\mathrm{LS}_{i t}=\\zeta^{\\mathrm{Rank}}\\tilde{\\Delta}\\mathrm{Shock}_{i t}+\\chi^{\\mathrm{Rank}}\\tilde{\\Delta}\\mathrm{Shock}_{i t}\\times\\mathrm{Superstar}_{i t_{0}}}\\ {+\\rho^{\\mathrm{Rank}}\\mathrm{Superstar}_{i t_{0}}+\\Delta\\delta_{k t}+\\xi_{b}w_{i t_{0}}\\times\\psi_{t}+\\Delta v_{i t}\\centering\\qquad}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe effect of foreign demand growth on the firms' labor share is allowed to vary across firms, depending on their degree of internationalization, as in the between-exporter specification described in equation (4). Given that the labor share is the ratio of total labor compensation to value-added, an increase in foreign demand can increase or decrease this ratio, depending on which effect is strongest. On the one hand, we can expect a rise in foreign demand to increase labor compensation through an increase in the number of Workers or in wages. To meet the increase in foreign demand, firms might need to hire more workers. Similarly, an increase in foreign demand might lead firms to raise wages in order to incentivize workers to meet the increase in demand. On the other hand, given that the firm might also sell more and experience an increase in its value-added as argued above, its labor share could go down if this effect dominates the increase in labor compensation. It is therefore not clear how foreign demand can impact a firm's labor share and what the effect might be for larger exporters.  \n\nThe relationship between foreign demand shocks and the growth rate of firms and their labor share is illustrated as a bin-scatter plot in Figure 3 and Figure 4, respectively. These Figures show that larger exporters grow faster and experience a stronger labor share decline. All the results reported in the next section will corroborate these descriptive pieces of evidence.  \n\n# 4 The Impact of Foreign Demand on Firm Growth and Labor Shares  \n\nThis section presents the empirical results of the paper. The main results are introduced in the first two subsections while the last subsection introduces the robustness tests considered.  \n\n## 4.1 Foreign Demand Growth and Reallocation  \n\nHow does a foreign demand increase affect the value-added growth rate of heterogeneous exporters? Figure 5 highlights the first main empirical result. The estimated coefficients are reported in the first column of Table 3.32 A clear picture emerges: foreign demand growth allows larger exporters to grow faster. More specifically, highly internationalized exporters grow following an increase in foreign demand while firms in the bottom $1\\%$ to $10\\%$ of the initial export sales distribution squeeze, although the effect is not significant at conventional levels. Figure 5 points to the existence of intensive margin reallocations favoring more internationalized exporters. Indeed, the elasticity of value-added growth to foreign demand growth displayed in the Figure means that firms that are in the top $1\\%$ of the initial export sales distribution experience a $1.5\\%$ increase in their value-added following a $10\\%$ increase in their foreign demand. This elasticity becomes negative for firms in the bottom $1\\%$ of the export sales distribution. Changes in value-added are driven by changes in total sales as shown in Figure 6.33 Foreign demand shocks therefore have a heterogeneous effect on value-added growth and favor superstar exporters with a low-labor share.  \n\nThis result complements the findings of Autor et al. (2020) who show that the growth of superstar firms explains the decline of the labor share across sectors in the US and in several other OECD countries. Their work does not explore specific causes behind the rise of superstar firms, which can include globalization, mergers and acquisitions, technological advances. Figure 5 shows that changes in demand conditions on foreign markets can rationalize part of the rise of superstar exporters, at least in the manufacturing sector.  \n\n## 4.2  Foreign Demand Growth and Labor Shares  \n\nWhat is the effect of foreign demand shocks on firm-level labor shares? The results from estimating equation (5) are displayed in column 2 of Table 3. The elasticity of labor share changes to foreign demand growth is displayed in Figure 7. It shows that exporters that are not highly internationalized experience an increase in their labor share following an increase in foreign demand. More internationalized exporters, on the other hand, experience a drop in their labor share while the labor share of top exporters exhibit an even larger decrease.  \n\nEmpirically, the fact that the labor share of superstar exporters decreases relatively more is consistent with the reallocation effect depicted in Figure 5. Top exporters grow disproportionately more, pushing down their labor share. Conversely, firms in the bottom $1\\%$ of the export sales distribution experience an increase in their labor share, driven by the fact that their value-added is going down. To explore the possibility that the effect depicted in Figure 7 is not driven by a decrease in labor compensation, I estimate equation 4 where the dependent variable is the growth rate of labor compensation. The estimates are shown in the third column of Table 3 and plotted in Figure 8. Larger exporters experience an increase in their labor compensation. While the effect is positive and significant for all exporters with export sales above the sample median, it is not disproportionately stronger for superstar exporters at the top of the export sales distribution.  \n\nAlthough changes in demand conditions abroad generate an increase in labor compensation, they shrink the share of the pie going back to workers. This within-between exporter effect points to the importance of the reallocation effect displayed in the previous subsection in driving changes in the labor share of exporters.  \n\n## 4.3 Robustness Tests  \n\nI show that both the intensive margin reallocations of value-added towards superstar exporters and the stronger decrease in the labor share they experience are not driven by the choice of sample, variables or specification.  \n\nAdditional controls and firm-specific trends. Table 4 confirms the findings of Table 3 when adding additional controls and controlling for firm trends. Columns 1 and 5 display the baseline results on the same sample for comparison purposes. In columns 2 and 6, I address the concern that offshoring may confound the effect of foreign demand by including the growth rate of each firm's total imports. The point estimates on the interaction terms remain statistically significant at the $1\\%$ level. In columns 3 and 7, I include the growth rate of capital intensity, which controls for the fact that foreign demand shocks may also incentivize firms to automate part of the production process. The main effect on the interaction term is largely stable. Finally, in columns 4 and 8, I control for firm-specific trends by adding firm fixed-effects. The point estimates on the interaction term survive this tough test and remain significant. If anything, the point estimates are larger.  \n\nFuture demand shocks. Figure A7 further tests whether the initial export composition of firms can be responsible for the growth of value-added and changes in the firms' labor share. If pre-trends were responsible for these changes, we should expect future demand shocks to have a statistically significant impact on contemporaneous outcomes. Reassuringly, none of the point estimates are statistically significant. This confirms that firm-specific trends are unlikely to drive the results.  \n\nAlternative internationalization measures. Table A7 uses two alternative internationalization measures, namely the number of products exported by a firm and the number of destination countries served. The interaction term is positive (negative) and significant in the first (last) two columns. The finding that superstar exporters grow relatively faster than less internationalized firms and experience a stronger decrease in their labor share is robust to using alternative internationalization measures.  \n\nExclusion of key industries.  The different industries within manufacturing experienced a different growth rate of exports over the period as shown in Figure A8. Firms' valueadded and labor share can evolve differently within different industries and be driven by industry-specific trends. I further exclude the industries whose growth rate of exports was particularly high to test whether the results are driven by these industries. More specifically, I exclude the chemical, rubber, plastics and fuel, and transport equipment industries from my sample. Table A8 shows that the results survive this restriction and are not driven by a few key industries.  \n\nAlternative firm size measures. Fact 3 shows that more internationalized exporters have a lower labor share. I test whether the results hold when considering other \"superstar” firm characteristics instead of these internationalization measures. I instead use capital intensity and labor productivity as alternative measures of heterogeneity. The results are displayed in Figure A9 and Figure A10, respectively. The elasticities displayed in all four panels leave the key results reported in Figure 5 and Figure 7 unchanged, though the coefficients are slightly smaller in magnitude and slightly less precisely estimated.  \n\nAlternative lag structure. Internationalized exporters are defined in the first year in which they appear in the sample to avoid simultaneity issues. This choice, however, prevents firms from becoming large players on international markets. I assess the robustness of the main results to lagging the internationalization measures, in order to allow exporters to move along the export sales distribution. This test is reported in Table A9. The results are robust to lagging the superstar variable once (columns 1 and 2) or twice (columns 3 and 4).  \n\nSample of survivors. Table 3 contains firms that survive over at least two time periods. Table A10 tests whether the subsample of exporters surviving the entire 1995-2007 period yields similar results. The estimated coefficients of interest $(\\beta^{\\mathrm{Rank}}$ and $\\chi^{\\mathrm{Rank}}$ havethe same sign as the baseline estimates that contain entrants and exiters and are statistically significant. This test shows that entrants and exiters over the period do not seem to drive the results.  \n\nOutsourcing. An alternative mechanism that could explain the reallocation of valueadded shares towards large exporters and the decline in their labor share is outsourcing. Over the last decades, several industries such as the automobile industry have transferred part of their activity to business partners to focus on their core activity. Two observable consequences of outsourcing could be a sudden increase in investment as the firm narrows its activity to its core competency and large changes in employment. I therefore remove firm-year observations for which the growth rate of total investments and the growth rate of employment is lower than the bottom or higher than the top $10\\%$ percent of each growth rate distribution within each 2-digit industry. This allows me to keep a sample of firms that have arguably not experienced any restructuring which would affect their value-added growth rate or their labor share. The point estimates reported in Table A11 are qualitatively very similar to those reported in Table 3 and are estimated precisely.  \n\nIndustry Fixed Effects and Superstar within Industry. I test the robustness of the results to using an alternative set of industry fixed effects and to changing the way superstar exporters are defined. In the second and fifth column of Table A12, I include 4-digit industry by year fixed effects, instead of the 2-digit sector by year fixed effects that are reported in the first and fourth column for comparison purposes. The point estimate on the interaction term decreases slightly but remains highly significant. In the third and last column, I instead consider a dummy variable that takes the value one if a firm's export sales is higher than its 4-digit industry median (at times $t_{0}$ ). The results are qualitatively unchanged and remain significant.  \n\nExcluding firms reporting affiliates abroad.  One might worry that the presence of multinational companies (MNC) might undermine the quality of the foreign demand shocks as foreign subsidiaries may drive the increase in foreign imports. An attempt to alleviate this concern consists of using the French \"Liaisons Financieres\" (LIFI) survey. This nonexhaustive survey contains information on the nationality and ownership status of firms that are headquartered in France. It also contains some information on the nationality of firms that are owned by French headquartered firms. In Table A13, I exclude firm-year observations (columns 1 to 2) or firms (columns 3 to 4) for which a foreign affiliate is reported in LIFI. The results are extremely robust to the exclusion of these observations.  \n\n# 5 Magnitude  \n\nHow large is the impact of a surge in foreign demand on the manufacturing labor share? I make use of the Foster et al. (2001) decomposition method and the point estimates obtained in Section 4.1 and 4.2 to get a sense of the magnitude of the effects. Although the following results are partial equilibrium in nature, they provide interesting evidence on the magnitude of the effect of foreign demand growth in generating changes in the manufacturing labor share.  \n\nFrom equation (2), the reallocation margin is given by:  \n\n$$\n\\lambda\\mathrm{LS}_{t}^{\\mathrm{Between}}:=\\sum_{i\\in S}\\left(\\omega_{i t}-\\omega_{i t-1}\\right)\\left(\\mathrm{LS}_{i t-1}-\\mathrm{LS}_{t-1}\\right)+\\sum_{i\\in S}\\left(\\omega_{i t}-\\omega_{i t-1}\\right)\\left(\\mathrm{LS}_{i t}-\\mathrm{LS}_{i t}\\right).\n$$  \n\nwhile the within-firm effect is given by:  \n\n$$\n\\Delta\\mathrm{LS}_{t}^{\\mathrm{Within}}:=\\sum_{i\\in\\mathrm{S}}\\omega_{i t-1}\\mathopen{}\\left(\\mathrm{LS}_{i t}-\\mathrm{LS}_{i t-1}\\right)\n$$  \n\nUsing the point estimates obtained, I can compute the percentage point change in the labor share caused by the reallocation effect and arising from foreign demand changes, labeled $\\Delta\\mathrm{L}\\hat{\\mathbf{\\nabla}}S_{t}^{\\mathrm{Between}}$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\Delta\\mathrm{L}\\hat{\\cal S}_{t}^{\\mathrm{Between}}=\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in S}\\left(\\hat{\\omega}_{i t}^{\\mathrm{Between}}-\\omega_{i t-1}\\right)\\left(\\mathrm{L}{\\cal S}_{i t-1}-\\mathrm{L}{\\cal S}_{t-1}\\right)}\\ &{+\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in S}\\left(\\hat{\\omega}_{i t}^{\\mathrm{Between}}-\\omega_{i t-1}\\right)\\left(\\hat{\\zeta}^{\\mathrm{Rank}}\\tilde{\\Delta}\\mathrm{Shock}_{i t}+\\hat{\\chi}^{\\mathrm{Rank}}\\tilde{\\Delta}\\mathrm{Shock}_{i t}\\times\\mathrm{Superstar}_{i t_{0}}\\right)}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe predicted values for the value-added weights are given by  \n\n$$\n\\hat{\\omega}_{i t}^{\\mathrm{Between}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{VA}_{i t-1}\\biggl(1+\\hat{\\alpha}^{\\mathrm{Rank}}\\tilde{\\Delta}\\mathrm{Shock}_{i t}+\\hat{\\beta}^{\\mathrm{Rank}}\\tilde{\\Delta}\\mathrm{Shock}_{i t}\\times\\mathrm{Superstar}_{i t_{0}}\\biggr)}{\\sum_{i}\\mathrm{VA}_{i t-1}\\biggl(1+\\hat{\\alpha}^{\\mathrm{Rank}}\\tilde{\\Delta}\\mathrm{Shock}_{i t}+\\hat{\\beta}^{\\mathrm{Rank}}\\tilde{\\Delta}\\mathrm{Shock}_{i t}\\times\\mathrm{Superstar}_{i t_{0}}\\biggr)}\n$$  \n\nValue-added is lagged in the previous equation. If there were no effect, $\\hat{\\alpha}^{\\mathrm{Rank}}=\\hat{\\beta}^{\\mathrm{Rank}}=0$ $\\hat{\\omega}_{i t}^{\\mathrm{Between}}=\\omega_{i t-1}$ $(\\Delta\\mathrm{L}\\dot{\\boldsymbol{S}}_{t}^{\\mathrm{Between}}=0)$  \n\nThe percentage point change arising from changes in firms' labor share and caused by foreign demand changes can be obtained using the estimated coefficients from equation (5). This gives the predicted within-between term $\\Delta\\hat{\\mathrm{LS}}_{t}^{W\\mathrm{ithin}}$  \n\n$$\n\\Delta{\\mathrm{LS}}_{t}^{\\mathrm{Within}}=\\sum_{i\\in\\mathrm{S}}{\\omega_{i t-1}}\\bigg(\\hat{\\zeta}^{\\mathrm{Rank}}\\tilde{\\Delta}\\mathrm{Shock}_{i t}+\\hat{\\chi}^{\\mathrm{Rank}}\\tilde{\\Delta}\\mathrm{Shock}_{i t}\\times\\mathrm{Superstar}_{i t_{0}}\\bigg)\n$$  \n\nI use the OLS coefficients provided in the first two columns of Table 3 to compute the predicted between-firm margin $\\Delta\\mathrm{L}\\mathbf{\\hat{S}}_{t}^{\\mathrm{B}}$ etwe and the predicted within-between frm margin $\\Delta\\mathrm{L}\\mathbf{\\hat{S}}_{t}^{V}$  \n\nThe main quantitative results are displayed in Table 5. For comparison purposes, the first three columns report the observed labor share change, reallocation and within components shown in Table 1. Columns 4 and 5 display the predicted between and withinbetween effects. In column 4, foreign demand growth generates a 0.04 percentage point decline in the labor share through reallocation towards low-labor share exporters over 1995-2007. The within-between firm effect is much stronger and generates a 1.4 percentage point decline in the labor share. Both between-firm and within-between firm effects arising from foreign demand growth therefore generate a 1.4 percentage point decline in the manufacturing labor share over the whole period. Given the evolution of the labor share depicted in Figure 1, the last two rows focus on the two sub-periods 1995-2000 and 2000-2007. Over 1995-2000, foreign demand growth explains about $12\\%$ of the overall decline in the French manufacturing labor share.34 The within-between effect represents two-thirds of this number. When the aggregate labor share increased over 2000-2007, foreign demand led to a 1.2 percentage point decline,35 driven by the within-between effect.  \n\nThese results are arguably a lower bound for the overall effect of international trade on the labor share. Aghion et al. (2018) provide causal empirical evidence that foreign demand shocks induce firms to patent more. The authors find that the effect is stronger for more productive exporters. This increase in innovation could further reallocate output towards larger exporters. A more globalized economy also means a country more open to imports from the rest of the world. Bloom et al. (2016) show that the rise of Chinese exports to European countries 0ver the period 1996-2007 spurred innovation. This channel, which goes through the import side of trade, can also lead to intensive margin reallocations towards larger firms.  \n\nI further investigate the role of firm heterogeneity in driving the within-between effect. In Table 6, I shut down the heterogeneity parameters $\\beta^{\\mathrm{Rank}}$ and $\\chi^{\\mathrm{Rank}}$ 36 The first two columns report the baseline estimated effects from Table 5. Columns 3 and 4 display the estimated between and within effects without accounting for the heterogeneous impact of foreign demand. The last column shows the contribution of firm-heterogeneity in driving the baseline within-between effect. The message from this table is that the heterogeneous impact of foreign demand matters substantially. Column 3 shows that foreign demand leads to a small labor share increase through the between-firm effect. This result is not surprising given that the reallocation effect is about the interaction term between a firm's foreign demand and its degree of internationalization. Column 4 shows that the pure effect of foreign demand shocks on the firms' labor share is negative. More importantly, column 5 indicates that allowing the effect of foreign demand to be heterogeneous across exporters leads to a within-between exporter effect to be more than twice as important. Understanding the role played by foreign demand growth in generating changes in the labor share boils down to understanding the reason why exporting firms experience a labor share decline and why the reallocation effect that takes place favors larger exporters, driving down their labor share by a larger amount. This is examined in the next section.  \n\nFinally, to examine the sensitivity of the results to the exclusion of superstar exporters, I first trim the top $1\\%$ of the export sales distribution and estimate baseline specifications (4) and (5). The first two columns of Table 7 report the baseline numbers provided in the last two columns of Table 5. I then use the point estimates reported in columns 1-2 of Table A14 and compute the new predicted between and within-between effects. Columns 3 and 4 show the new between and within-between effects, while the last column computes the contribution of superstar exporters to the within-between effect. The contribution of these superstar exporters to the within-between effect is quantitatively important. This effect is halved without these special exporters. Moreover, not accounting for top sellers on international markets leads to foreign demand growth explaining only $3\\%$ of the 1995- 2000 labor share decline versus $12\\%$ as reported before. Over 2000-2007, the effect is als0 roughly halved. These results stress the key role of superstar exporters.  \n\n# 6 Inspecting the Mechanism  \n\nI now discuss plausible channels behind the empirical findings of Section 4. To do so, I first examine the channels behind the response of labor shares before turning to the differentiated impact of foreign demand on labor shares. The full model and proofs are detailed in Appendix C. The model focuses on intensive margin reallocations towards large firms.37  \n\n## 6.1  Labor Share Changes: Fixed Costs or Markups?  \n\nWhy do labor shares decrease when exporters experience an increase in foreign demand? A firm's production function is given by $q_{i}=\\varphi l_{i}$ where $l_{i}$ is variable labor, $\\varphi$ is its productivity and is firm-specific. Total labor of firm $i$ is given by $L_{i}=l_{i}+f$ where $f$ is the fixed labor cost of production.  \n\nThe condition for profit maximization such that marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost entails that the price $p_{i}$ of a good is equal to that firm's markup $\\mu_{i}$ times its marginal cost of production:  \n\n$$\np_{i}=\\mu_{i}{\\frac{w}{\\varphi}}\n$$  \n\nMultiplying both sides of the previous equation by $q_{i}$ and using the fact that $l_{i}=L_{i}-f,$ one obtains:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{w L_{i}}{p_{i}q_{i}}=\\frac{1}{\\mu_{i}}+\\frac{w f}{p_{i}q_{i}}\n$$  \n\nFirms that charge higher markups or have a lower share of fixed labor cost in valueadded have a lower labor share.38 In a monopolistic competition framework with constant elasticity of substitution (CES) preferences, markups would be constant across firms and pinned down by the elasticity of substitution across goods $\\sigma$ .39 In the present model, a firm's demand elasticity varies with its size, generating heterogeneous markups. The main assumption, which is discussed in the Appendix, is that Marshall's Second Law of Demand holds:  \n\nAssumption 1. (Marshall's Second Law of Demand) The inverse demand elasticity $\\sigma_{p}(x_{i}):=$ ap(xa)/axi increases in xi: xi $\\frac{\\partial\\sigma_{p}(x_{i})}{\\partial x_{i}}>0$  \n\nThis assumption is equivalent to saying that the demand elasticity decreases with consumption $x_{i}$ . It implies that a profit-maximizing firm's marginal revenue decreases in $x_{i},$ as shown in Appendix C. The fact that marginal revenues decrease with consumption generates a positive relationship between a firm's productivity level and its size. Assumption 1 is sufficient to generate a positive relationship between firm size and markups as found in the literature (De Loecker and Warzynski, 2012; Autor et al., 2020). Proposition 1 follows:  \n\nProposition 1. A market size increase decreases firm-level markups and decreases the share of fixed labor cost in value-added.  \n\nProof. See Appendix C.  \n\nIn the model, an increase in demand, i.e. an increase in market size, impacts both components of (9). First, the market size increase generates entry of new firms and thus an increase in competition on the foreign market, leading to a higher price elasticity of demand and to lower markups charged on the foreign market. Everything else being equal, firm-level markups will decrease, leading to an increase in firm-level labor shares. Second, the increase in market size allows all firms to grow. Everything else equal, this increases the denominator of $w f/p_{i}q_{i}$ and thus decreases the labor share of exporters. This is the only channel that can rationalize the empirical finding documented previously and shown in column 4 of Table A14.  \n\nThe French micro-data allow me to further investigate the channel through which foreign demand affects the labor share of firms by investigating the response of the number of workers, wages and output. To meet the increase in foreign demand, firms might need to hire more workers. Similarly, an increase in foreign demand might lead firms to raise wages in order to incentivize workers to meet the increase in demand.40 Figure 9a suggests that individuals working in larger exporting firms experience small wage gains.41 Figure 9b shows that exporters do not hire more workers following an increase in foreign demand.42 As labor supply is arguably inelastic in the short-run, the increase in labor demand brought about by foreign demand growth leads to higher wages, thereby driving up total labor compensation (Figure 8). Moreover, the finding that the number of workers does not react and that superstar exporters grow disproportionately more suggests that their labor productivity is going to increase. If the labor share decline within firms was predominantly driven by an increase in markups, there is no strong reason to believe this would be associated with wage gains. Finally, I investigate the response of output to foreign demand shocks. Figure 10 shows that the elasticity of output growth to foreign demand growth closely corresponds to that of value-added growth reported in Figure 5, so that the results are driven by an increase in output, consistent with the theory.  \n\nThese results corroborate the existence of a market size effect that allows firms to expand on international markets. This decreases their labor share by decreasing their share of fixed labor cost in value-added, consistent with the result shown in the last two columns of Table A14.  \n\n## 6.2  Market Size and Competition  \n\nWhy do superstar exporters experience a larger labor share decline following a foreign demand shock as shown in Figure 7?  \n\nThe overall effect of market size $L$ on a firm's profits $\\Pi$ is given by:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\Pi}{d L}\\frac{L}{\\Pi}=\\frac{\\partial\\Pi}{\\partial L}\\frac{L}{\\Pi}+\\frac{\\partial\\Pi}{\\partial\\lambda}\\frac{\\lambda}{\\Pi}\\times\\frac{d\\lambda}{d L}\\frac{L}{\\lambda}\n$$  \n\nThe elasticity of profits to a change in demand can be decomposed into two effects: a direct market size effect, which is the first component on the right hand side of the equation, and a competition effect, where $\\lambda$ is the competition shifter. The first component tends to rise firms' profits as highlighted in the previous subsection. The second one decreases profits as competition becomes fiercer via the entry of new firms.43 In general, the overall effect is indeterminate but with additively separable preferences, the solution turns out to be tractable. As shown in the Appendix, the previous equation boils down to:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\Pi}{d L}\\frac{L}{\\Pi}=1-\\frac{[\\sigma_{p}(\\varphi,\\lambda)]^{-1}}{\\int_{\\varphi^{*}}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\pi^{c}(\\varphi,\\lambda)}{\\pi^{c}(\\lambda)}[\\sigma_{p}(\\varphi,\\lambda)]^{-1}d G(\\varphi)}\n$$  \n\nThe market size effect equals unity. The competition effect is the ratio of a firm's demand elasticity to a weighted average of demand elasticities faced by all surviving firms. These demand elasticities are weighted by the share of each firm's profit in total profits. The denominator is thus an average demand elasticity. Firms with a lower than average de$\\begin{array}{r}{[\\sigma_{p}(\\varphi,\\lambda)]^{-1}/\\int_{\\varphi^{*}}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\pi^{c}(\\bar{\\varphi},\\lambda)}{\\pi^{c}(\\lambda)}[\\sigma_{p}(\\varphi,\\lambda)]^{-1}d G(\\varphi)<1}\\end{array}$ Propstion 2follows:  \n\nProposition 2. A market size increase reallocates profits towards larger firms and decreases their labor share relatively more through the fixed cost channel.  \n\nProof. See Appendix C.  \n\nThe intuition of the result is as follows. Under Assumption 1, more productive firms face a lower demand elasticity. The market size effect dominates the competition effect for larger firms as they face a lower than average demand elasticity and are not highly penalized by the concomitant increase in competition. Firms with a higher than average demand elasticity, namely less productive firms, will experience a decrease in profits as the competition effect dominates. A market size increase thus triggers intensive margin reallocations towards larger firms.44 45 As Mrazova and Neary (2017) put it, an increase in demand generates a \"Matthew Effect\".46 These results are not new. The new feature that the model puts forward is that intensive margin reallocations towards larger exporters have implications for firm-level labor shares via the fixed cost channel.  \n\n# 7 Conclusion  \n\nThis paper studies and quantifies the impact of export demand on the labor share. To do so, I use firm-level data on the universe of French exporters operating in the manufacturing sector.  \n\nForeign demand growth allows low-labor share firms, superstar exporters, to grow disproportionately more. Importantly, this reallocation effect towards superstar exporters generates a stronger decrease in their labor share. These effects appear to be extremely robust. Foreign demand accounts for $12\\%$ of the labor share decline over 1995-2000 and generates a 1.2 percentage point labor share decline over 2000-2007, suggesting that the increase observed over the second period could have been substantially higher.  \n\nMy findings uncover a previously unexplored dimension of labor share changes and show that the impact of international trade on the labor share goes beyond changes in import exposure. The results provided in the paper are arguably a lower bound for the effect of international trade more broadly construed on the manufacturing labor share. First, this article has focused exclusively on the role played by export demand. Second, the analysis is partial equilibrium and does not capture the impact of export demand and import competition on innovation (Aghion et al., 2018; Bloom et al., 2016). Innovating is also a means to grow and gain market shares, which would likely strengthen the importance of reallocations towards superstar exporters.  \n\nOverall, this paper adds causal evidence from an international trade perspective to the \"winner take most\" phenomenon highlighted by Autor et al. (2020). Indeed, the labor share changes arising from foreign demand shocks are consistent with fiercer competition on international markets, which generates intensive margin reallocations towards superstar exporters. The paper thus suggests that the consequences of globalization are not so malign. First, the labor share changes are consistent with a decrease in the share of fixed labor cost in value-added rather than rising firm-level markups. Second, superstar exporters are also more productive so that their rise is a source of aggregate productivity growth.  \n\n# References  \n\nACEMOGLU, D. AND P.

I drop firmyear observations with missing SIREN or with a SIREN number that only contains zeros or nines. I further keep observations whose first two digits of main activity code is strictly between 15 and 37. That is, I keep manufacturing firms according to NAF Rev. 1. I drop observations with negative, null or missing values for sales, value-added, number of workers. I also get rid of firm-year pairs with negative values for domestic sales, export sales, wages, social contributions. Firm-year observations with a labor share lower than zero or higher than unity are dropped. Finally, I drop values equal to zero for labor compensation and eliminate observations for which the growth rate of sales is lower than the bottom or higher than the top $1\\%$ percent of the growth rate distribution within each 2-digit industry. This allows me to remove outliers. I only keep firm-year observations that exported at least once according to the customs data. This sample of exporting firms represents $74\\%$ of total value-added of the raw manufacturing sample.  \n\n### A.2 List of Variables  \n\n· Capital: The capital measure is measured as the book value of fixed tangible assets. I deflate capital expenditures by sector-level price indices from EUKLEMS. Source: FICuSand author'scalculation   \nCapital Intensity: The capital intensity of a firm is the log of the capital-labor ratio of the firm. Source: Author's calculation   \n· Destination Served: Total number of destinations (European and Extra-European) served by a firm in a given year. Source: Customs data and author's calculation  \n\n· Employment: Total number of employees working in each firm. Source: FICUS · Export Intensity: Export intensity is the ratio of export sales as reported in FICUS to total sales. This is to ensure that the number takes values between O and 1. Source: FICUS  \n\n· Export Sales: Export sales reported by the firm in thousands of euros. This variable is available in the fiscal files and is highly correlated (correlation coefficient above 0.9) with total export sales computed from the customs data. Firms are classified as exporters if they sell a positive amount abroad according to the customs. I use export sales from the customs data for the empirical analysis. Figure A4 uses export sales from the balance-sheet data but the pattern is similar when using data from the customs instead. Source: FICuS and customs data  \n\n· Imports: Imports are available from the customs data and are disaggregated at the firm-origin-product-year level. Firm-level imports are obtained by summing a firm's imports across origin countries and product types in a given year. Source: Author's calculation and customs data  \n\n· Labor Compensation: This variable is the sum of two components separately avail able in the fiscal files: salaries and social benefits that are paid by the employer and that benefit the worker in the form of retirement funds, social security funds etc. Source:FICuS  \n\n· Labor Productivity: Labor productivity is the ratio of real value-added to the number of employees. Source: FICUS and author's calculation  \n\n· Labor Share: I construct the firm-level labor share variable as follows. In accounting, gross value-added is equal to the sum of gross operating surplus, labor compensation (as defined above) and taxes net of subsidies. We therefore do not allocate taxes net of subsidies and build the labor share as the ratio of labor compensation to gross value-added. Observations with values outside the (0, 1) interval are discarded.Source:FICuS and author's calculation  \n\n● Labor Share (Equipped): Equipped labor shares are defined as the ratio of a firm's value-added to its total sales. This definition captures the supply of all primary factors of production (labor and capital). It is defined as $\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathrm{LS}_{i t}^{\\mathrm{Equipped}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{VA}_{i t}}{\\mathrm{Sales}_{i t}}}\\end{array}$ VAi_.Source: Author's calculation  \n\n● Output: Output is defined as a firm's total sales divided by the coresponding 2- digit sector price index. Source: FICUS and author's calculation   \n· NAF Code: 2-digit sector code according to the NACE Rev. 1 classification. Some sectors are pooled together, depending on the availability of sector-price deflators from EUKLEMS. Source: FICUS   \n● Products: Total number of products defined at the 8-digit level (CN8 classification exported by a firm in a given year. Source: Customs data and author's calculation   \n● Total Sales: Total sales (domestic sales plus export sales) reported by the firm in thousands of euros. Source: FICuS   \n· Value-Added: This variable is directly available in FICUS and follows the accounting definition according to which it is equal to total sales minus input expenses taking into account changes in inventories. Source: FICUS   \nWages: Firm-level wages are obtained by dividing labor compensation by the number of employees for each firm-year observation. Source: FICUS and author's calculation  \n\n## B  Alternative Decomposition of Labor Share Changes  \n\nDefining $\\overline{{\\mathrm{L}S}}_{t}$ and $\\overline{{\\omega}}_{t}$ as the unweighted mean labor share and value-added share, respectively, and $\\bar{\\Delta}X_{i t}=X_{i t}-\\overline{{X}}_{t},$ one can decompose (1) into two components as initially done in Olley and Pakes (1996) for productivity. This yields  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{L}S_{t}=\\overline{{\\mathrm{L}S}}_{t}+\\sum_{i}\\bar{\\Delta}\\omega_{i t}\\bar{\\Delta}\\mathrm{L}S_{i t}\n$$  \n\nSubtracting $\\mathrm{L}S_{t-1}$ from (12), the change in the labor share from one year to the next is therefore given by:  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{LS}_{t}-\\mathrm{LS}_{t-1}=\\left(\\overline{{\\mathrm{LS}}}_{t}-\\overline{{\\mathrm{LS}}}_{t-1}\\right)+\\left(\\sum_{i}\\bar{\\Delta}\\omega_{i t}\\bar{\\Delta}\\mathrm{LS}_{i t}-\\sum_{i}\\bar{\\Delta}\\omega_{i t-1}\\bar{\\Delta}\\mathrm{LS}_{i t-1}\\right)\n$$  \n\nMelitz and Polanec (2015) (MP) further refine this decomposition method in order to account for entry and exit of firms. Writing the change in a variable $X$ between $t-1$ and $t$ by $\\Delta X_{t},$ this decomposition writes:47  \n\n$$\n\\Delta\\mathrm{LS}_{t}=\\Delta\\overline{{\\mathrm{LS}}}_{t}^{\\mathrm{S}}+\\Delta\\bigg(\\sum_{i}\\bar{\\Delta}\\omega_{i t}\\bar{\\Delta}\\mathrm{LS}_{i t}\\bigg)^{\\mathrm{S}}+\\omega_{t}^{\\mathrm{ENT}}\\bigg(\\mathrm{LS}_{t}^{\\mathrm{ENT}}-\\mathrm{LS}_{t}^{\\mathrm{S}}\\bigg)+\\omega_{t-1}^{\\mathrm{ENT}}\\bigg(\\mathrm{LS}_{t-1}^{\\mathrm{S}}-\\mathrm{LS}_{t}^{\\mathrm{NT}}\\bigg),\n$$  \n\nBetween any two years, firms can be survivors (superscript S), new firms or entrants (ENT) or exiters (EXT). $\\omega_{t}^{\\mathrm{ENT}}$ is the overall value-added share of new firms at time $t,$ while $\\omega_{t-1}^{\\mathrm{EXT}}$ is that o exites at $t-1.^{48}~\\mathrm{LS}_{t}^{\\mathrm{S}},\\mathrm{LS}_{t}^{\\mathrm{ENT}}$ and $\\mathrm{L}S_{t}^{\\mathrm{EXT}}$ are each group's aggregate labor share at time $t$  \n\nThe first two terms of (14) are the within and between-firm effects previously mentioned. The third term reflects the contribution of entrants to labor share changes. The entry of firms with a larger labor share than survivors in the same period could increase the aggregate labor share. The effect will be larger, the larger the share of entrants in value-added in the second period. The intuition is similar for the last term of the decomposition accounting for the contribution of exit.  \n\nThe results of this decomposition are provided in Table A3 for the sample of exporting firms. The within-firm effect given in column 2 is positive over the period. Column 3 shows that reallocations of output towards low-labor share firms drive down the labor share. The between-firm and within-firm components roughly offset each other, as was already the case with the FHK decomposition. The contribution of entry and exit is roughly constant over the whole 1995-2007 period.  \n\n## C Theoretical Appendix  \n\nThe empirical results highlight the importance of reallocations towards superstar exporters in driving down the manufacturing labor share, through between-firm and withinbetween firm effects. I now rely on a monopolistic competition model with endogenous competition to rationalize these effects. The two key results of the model is that a market size increase decreases markups and the share of fixed labor cost in value-added, and leads to intensive margin reallocations towards larger firms.  \n\nThe framework builds on Zhelobodko et al. (2012). The market structure is monopolistic competition and firms are heterogeneous in terms of their productivity. For sake of simplicity and because the focus of the paper is on reallocations across firms, firms are assumed to be single-product firms.49  \n\n### C.1 Closed Economy Model  \n\nThe economy is assumed to be closed. The model in open-economy delivers the same results as the one in closed-economy and is therefore relegated to Appendix C.3. An increase in foreign demand will lead to a reallocation of output towards the most productive exporters with a low labor share.  \n\nConsumers side. There are $L$ consumers in the economy who demand $x_{i}$ units of a differentiated good indexed over the interval $i\\in[0,N]$ . The wage is the numeraire so that a consumer's income is set equal to one. Preferences are additively separable and each consumer solves:  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{max}_{x_{i}}\\int_{0}^{N}u(x_{i})d i\\quad\\mathrm{s.t.}\\quad\\int_{0}^{N}p_{i}x_{i}d i=1\n$$  \n\nThe first-order condition with respect to $x_{i}$ yields the following inverse demand function:  \n\n$$\np(x_{i};\\lambda)={\\frac{u^{\\prime}(x_{i})}{\\lambda}}\n$$  \n\nThe inverse demand function is positive and downward sloping if and only if $u^{\\prime}(x_{i})>0$ and $u^{\\prime\\prime}(x_{i})<0,$ which I assume. The marginal utility of income $\\lambda$ isdefined from the budget constraint and (15) as:  \n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\int_{0}^{N}u^{\\prime}(x_{i})x_{i}d i\n$$  \n\nFrom (15), the marginal utility of income acts as a demand shifter. If it increases, the residual demand curve shifts inward so that prices decrease at any given quantity level.  \n\nFirms side. Firms produce a distinct differentiated good and there is a set of entrants $N_{e}$ who can pay a sunk cost of entry expressed in units of labor $f_{e}$ to produce or not. If they decide to pay that cost, they draw their productivity level $\\varphi$ from a distribution $G(\\varphi)$ whose support is given over $[0,\\infty]$ . When producing, firms have to pay a fixed cost $f$ which gives rise to increasing returns to scale. Each firm $i$ produces a good $q_{i}$ using labor $l_{i}$ as a variable input. A firm's production function is $q_{i}=\\varphi l_{i}$ where $\\varphi$ is its productivity and is firm-specific. The total cost function $\\mathrm{TC}_{i}$ of the firm is $\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathrm{T}\\boldsymbol{C}_{i}=\\frac{w}{\\varphi}q_{i}+w f}\\end{array}$ where $f$ .s the fixed cost of production.  \n\nThe condition for profit maximization such that marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost entails that the price $p_{i}$ of a good is equal to that firm's markup $\\mu_{i}$ times its marginal cost of production:  \n\n$$\np_{i}=\\mu_{i}{\\frac{w}{\\varphi}}\n$$  \n\nMultiplying both sides of the previous equation by $q_{i}$ and using the fact that $l_{i}~=$ $L_{i}-f,$ . one obtains equation (9) in the text.  \n\nFrom the goods market equilibrium condition, total quantity produced is $q_{i}=x_{i}L$ Firms choose the $x_{i}$ that maximizes their per-consumer operating profits $\\pi^{c}$ .50  \n\n$$\n\\pi^{c}(\\varphi,\\lambda):=\\operatorname*{max}_{x_{i}}\\left\\{\\left({\\frac{u^{\\prime}(x_{i})}{\\lambda}}-{\\frac{1}{\\varphi}}\\right)x_{i}\\right\\}\n$$  \n\nThis gives rise to the optimal quantity demanded by individual consumers:  \n\n$$\nx(\\varphi,\\lambda):=\\arg\\operatorname*{max}_{x_{i}}\\left\\{\\left({\\frac{u^{\\prime}(x_{i})}{\\lambda}}-{\\frac{1}{\\varphi}}\\right)x_{i}\\right\\}\n$$  \n\nRevenue sales per-consumer are defined as:  \n\n$$\nr(\\varphi,\\lambda)=p\\big({x}(\\varphi,\\lambda),\\lambda\\big)x(\\varphi,\\lambda)\n$$  \n\nwhile total net profits are given by:  \n\n$$\n\\Pi(\\varphi,\\lambda)=\\pi^{c}(\\varphi,\\lambda)L-f\n$$  \n\nTotal profits are continuous and from the envelope condition, profits increase in $\\varphi$ that there exists a unique cutoff productivity level $\\varphi^{*}$ that solves:  \n\n$$\n\\Pi(\\varphi^{*},\\lambda)=0\\Longleftrightarrow\\pi^{c}(\\varphi^{*},\\lambda)L=f\n$$  \n\nFirms that are less productive than the cutoff productivity level $(\\varphi<\\varphi^{*})$ Will not find it profitable to produce and will exit.  \n\nFree entry is assumed to hold and this condition writes:  \n\n$$\n\\int_{\\varphi^{*}}^{\\infty}\\Big[\\pi^{c}\\big(\\varphi,\\lambda\\big)L-f\\Big]d G(\\varphi)=f_{e}\n$$  \n\nMarshall's Second Law of Demand. The two key results of the model hinge on an assumption relating a firm's demand elasticity to its size, assumption commonly referred to as Marshall's Second Law of Demand (MSLD) and stated in the text. MSLD means that the demand elasticity decreases with $x_{i}$ . Krugman (1979) derives a model of international trade with increasing returns to scale in which he studies the effect of an expansion of the world economy on welfare. His model with no firm heterogeneity predicts that trade leads to pro-competitive effects (lower markups). This is because the demand elasticity is not constant. More specifically, \"these results depend [..] on the assumption that the elasticity of demand falls with c(onsumption). This assumption, which might alternatively be stated as an assumption that the elasticity of demand rises when the price of a good is increased, seems plausible. In any case, it seems to be necessary if this model is to yield reasonable results, and I make the assumption without apology\" (Krugman, 1979). De Loecker and Warzynski (2012) show that exporting firms that are larger than domestic firms charge higher markups. De Loecker et al. (2016) shows that markups and quantities are positively correlated with one another. Their method of estimating markups does not make any assumption on the market structure in which firms operate and is therefore consistent with larger firms facing a lower demand elasticity in a monopolistic competition context. Mayer et al. (2020) show that the patterns of product-mix reallocations they find in French manufacturing are consistent with larger firms facing a lower demand elasticity.51  \n\n### C.2 Firm-Level Results  \n\nMSLD leads to the following claim:  \n\nClaim 1. Marshal's Second Law of Demand implies that marginal revenues decrease with $x_{i}$ Proof. The first-order condition of the firm's optimization problem given in (17) gives:  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{\\partial p(x_{i})}{\\partial x_{i}}}x_{i}+p(x_{i})={\\frac{1}{\\varphi}}\n$$  \n\nDefining the inverse demand elasticity as $\\begin{array}{r}{\\sigma_{p}(x_{i}):=-\\frac{\\partial p(x_{i})/\\partial x_{i}}{p(x_{i})/x_{i}}}\\end{array}$ equation (23) rewrites:  \n\n$$\np(x_{i})\\left(1-\\sigma_{p}(x_{i})\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\varphi}\n$$  \n\nThis condition states the well-known condition that profit-maximizing firms produce up to the point where their marginal revenue $\\operatorname{MR}(x_{i})$ is equal to their marginal cost MC. Given the support of $G(\\varphi)$ , the marginal cost is always non-negative which entails that a firm's marginal revenue must be non-negative. This condition is met if the inverse demand elasticity is such that $\\sigma_{p}(x_{i})\\leq1$ . A second important condition for profit maximization is that the second-order condition on (17) is met. This condition reads:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p(x_{i})}{\\partial x_{i}}\\bigg(1-\\sigma_{p}(x_{i})\\bigg)-p(x_{i})\\frac{\\partial\\sigma_{p}(x_{i})}{\\partial x_{i}}<0\n$$  \n\nThis condition is equivalent to saying that a firm's marginal revenue decreases in $x_{i}$ .Using the definition of the inverse demand elasticity and rearranging (24), this yields:  \n\n$$\n-p(x_{i})\\left(\\left(1-\\sigma_{p}(x_{i})\\right)+\\frac{\\partial\\sigma_{p}(x_{i})}{\\partial x_{i}}\\frac{x_{i}}{\\sigma_{p}(x_{i})}\\right)<0\n$$  \n\nGiven Assumption 1 that the inverse demand elasticity increases in $x_{i},$ or conversely, that the demand elasticity decreases in $x_{i}$ and that $\\sigma_{p}(x_{i})\\leq1$ this yields a downward sloping marginal revenue curve:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\mathrm{MR}(x_{i})}{\\partial x_{i}}<0\n$$  \n\nTherefore, MSLD implies that marginal revenues decrease with $x_{i}$ . Alternatively, defining the convexity of the demand function as p := -\\* $\\begin{array}{r}{\\rho:=-\\frac{\\partial^{2}p(x_{i})/\\partial x_{i}^{2}}{\\partial p(x_{i})/\\partial x_{i}}x_{i}}\\end{array}$ dp(x)/ax x and rearranging the second  \n\norder condition yields $\\rho<2$ . This condition will be used to prove that markups decrease when the market size increases.  \n\nCES preferences are very often used in international trade. Their inverse demand function is given by:52  \n\n$$\np(x_{i})=\\kappa^{\\frac{1}{\\sigma}}x_{i}^{-\\frac{1}{\\sigma}}\n$$  \n\nDeriving $\\sigma_{p}(x_{i})$ given the CES inverse demand function leads to $\\begin{array}{r}{\\sigma_{p}(x_{i})=\\frac{1}{\\sigma}}\\end{array}$ . This trivially entails that $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{\\partial\\sigma_{p}(x_{i})}{\\partial x_{i}}=0}\\end{array}$ so that MSLD does not hold for this class of functions. As shown in the next subsection, this implies that CES preferences are not consistent with a positive relationship between firm size and markups. More details on functions consistent with MSLD can be found in Mrazova and Neary (2017). 口  \n\nClaim 2. More productive firms charge higher markups and have a lower share of fixed labor cost invalue-added.  \n\nProof. Using the first-order condition (23) and the definition of the inverse demand elasticity, the inverse demand function writes:  \n\n$$\np(x_{i})=\\frac{1}{1-\\sigma_{p}(x_{i})}\\frac{1}{\\varphi}\n$$  \n\nEquation (26) implies that for any two firms 1 and 2 such that $\\varphi_{2}<\\varphi_{1}$  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{MR}(x_{1})}{\\mathrm{MR}(x_{2})}=\\frac{\\varphi_{2}}{\\varphi_{1}}<1\n$$  \n\nwhich implies that $x_{1}>x_{2}$ . Therefore, more efficient firms produce more. Since $p(x_{i})=$ is decreasin inx, more prductie frms also sll a lower pries.  \n\nA firm's markup is defined as $\\begin{array}{r}{\\mu(x_{i}):=\\frac{1}{1-\\sigma_{p}(x_{i})}}\\end{array}$ This implies that:  \n\n$$\ns\\mathrm{gn}\\bigg\\{\\frac{\\partial\\mu(x_{i})}{\\partial x_{i}}\\bigg\\}=\\mathrm{sgn}\\bigg\\{\\frac{\\partial\\sigma_{p}(x_{i})}{\\partial x_{i}}\\bigg\\}>0\n$$  \n\nGiven that more productive firms also produce more,53 these firms face a lower demand elasticity which allows them to charge higher markups. It follows from equation (9) that   \n5Thisqutostabymamiznteutlitytn $\\begin{array}{r}{U=\\left(\\int_{0}^{1}c_{i}^{\\frac{\\sigma-1}{\\sigma}}d i\\right)^{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma-1}}}\\end{array}$ subject to the budgel constraint $\\begin{array}{r}{\\int_{0}^{1}p_{i}c_{i}d i=1}\\end{array}$ with Fpa - p where Pisthe prce idex.   \n53Figure A11 shows that more productive firms are larger. Indeed,there exists a strong positive relationship between (labor) productivity and firm size, as measured by total sales.  \n\nlarger firms have a lower labor share.  \n\nProposition 1. (Reminded) A market size increase decreases firm-level markups and decreases the share of fixed labor cost in value-added.  \n\nProof. I start by showing that markups decrease with an increase in market size. Totally differentiating the first-order condition (23) and using the fact that $x=x(\\varphi,\\lambda)$ at the optimum yields:  \n\n$$\n2{\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}}d x+{\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial\\lambda}}d\\lambda+x{\\frac{\\partial^{2}p}{\\partial x^{2}}}d x+x{\\frac{\\partial^{2}p}{\\partial x\\partial\\lambda}}d\\lambda=0\n$$  \n\nTaking partial derivatives of the inverse demand function $p(x;\\lambda)=\\lambda^{-1}u^{\\prime}(x)$ to compute the relevant terms and rearranging yields:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d x}{d L}\\frac{L}{x}=\\frac{\\sigma_{p}(\\varphi,\\lambda)^{-1}-1}{\\rho-2}\\frac{d\\lambda}{d L}\\frac{L}{\\lambda}\n$$  \n\nI now proceed to evaluating how competition $\\lambda$ changes with market size. First, total operating profits are given by:  \n\n$$\n\\Pi(\\varphi,\\lambda,L):=\\operatorname*{max}_{q_{i}}\\left\\{\\left(\\frac{u^{\\prime}(\\frac{q_{i}}{L})}{\\lambda}-\\frac{1}{\\varphi}\\right)q_{i}\\right\\}\n$$  \n\nApplying the envelope theorem and differentiating profits with respect to $\\lambda$  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\Pi}{\\partial\\lambda}\\frac{\\lambda}{\\Pi}=-\\frac{u^{\\prime}(x)q}{\\lambda^{2}}\\frac{\\lambda}{\\Pi}=-p\\frac{q}{\\Pi}=-\\frac{p q}{\\left[p-\\frac{1}{\\varphi}\\right]q}=-\\frac{p}{\\left[p-\\frac{1}{\\varphi}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nMaking use of (23):  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\Pi}{\\partial\\lambda}\\frac{\\lambda}{\\Pi}=-\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{p}(\\varphi,\\lambda)}<0\n$$  \n\nby the definition of the inverse demand elasticity and the fact that $x=x(\\varphi,\\lambda)$ at the optimum.  \n\nFinally,deriving $\\frac{d\\lambda}{d L}\\frac{L}{\\lambda}$ entails making use of the fre-entry condition Let us denotethe value of a firm by $V(\\lambda,L)$ . The expected value of a firm must equal the sunk cost from the free entry condition:  \n\n$$\nV(\\lambda,L):=\\int_{\\varphi^{*}}^{\\infty}\\Big[\\pi^{c}(\\varphi,\\lambda)L-f\\Big]d G(\\varphi)=f_{e}\n$$  \n\nTotally differentiating this equation and solving for $\\frac{d\\lambda}{d L}$ yields:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\lambda}{d L}=-\\frac{\\partial V(\\lambda,L)/\\partial L}{\\partial V(\\lambda,L)/\\partial\\lambda}\n$$  \n\nApplying Leibniz's rule to the free-entry condition and using the cut-off condition in (21) I obtain:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial V(\\lambda,L)}{\\partial L}=\\int_{\\varphi^{*}}^{\\infty}\\pi^{c}(\\varphi,\\lambda)d G(\\varphi)-\\left[\\pi^{c}(\\varphi^{*},\\lambda)L-f\\right]\\frac{d\\varphi^{*}}{d L}=\\int_{\\varphi^{*}}^{\\infty}\\pi^{c}(\\varphi,\\lambda)d G(\\varphi)-\\left[\\pi^{c}(\\varphi^{*},\\lambda)L-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right]\\frac{d\\varphi^{*}}{d L}=\\int_{\\varphi^{*}}^{\\infty}\\pi^{c}(\\varphi,\\lambda)d G(\\varphi).\n$$  \n\nApplying Leibniz's rule to the denominator of (32) and (21):  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\frac{\\d}{\\d t}(\\lambda,L)}{\\partial\\lambda}=\\int_{\\varphi^{*}}^{\\infty}{\\cal L}\\frac{\\partial\\pi^{c}(\\varphi,\\lambda)}{\\partial\\lambda}d G(\\varphi)-\\left[\\pi^{c}(\\varphi^{*},\\lambda)L-f\\right]\\frac{d\\varphi^{*}}{d\\lambda}=\\int_{\\varphi^{*}}^{\\infty}{\\cal L}\\frac{\\partial\\pi^{c}(\\varphi,\\lambda)}{\\partial\\lambda}d\\Omega(\\varphi)-h(\\lambda)L.\n$$  \n\nSubstituting the previous two equations in (32):  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\lambda}{d L}=-\\frac{\\int_{\\varphi^{*}}^{\\infty}\\pi^{c}(\\varphi,\\lambda)d G(\\varphi)}{\\int_{\\varphi^{*}}^{\\infty}L\\frac{\\partial\\pi^{c}(\\varphi,\\lambda)}{\\partial\\lambda}d G(\\varphi)}\n$$  \n\nRewriting this equation to obtain an elasticity:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\lambda}{d L}\\frac{L}{\\lambda}=-\\frac{\\int_{\\varphi^{*}}^{\\infty}\\pi^{c}(\\varphi,\\lambda)d G(\\varphi)}{\\int_{\\varphi^{*}}^{\\infty}\\lambda\\frac{\\partial\\pi^{c}(\\varphi,\\lambda)}{\\partial\\lambda}d G(\\varphi)}=-\\frac{\\int_{\\varphi^{*}}^{\\infty}\\pi^{c}(\\varphi,\\lambda)d G(\\varphi)}{\\int_{\\varphi^{*}}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\partial\\pi^{c}(\\varphi,\\lambda)}{\\partial\\lambda}\\frac{\\lambda}{\\pi^{c}(\\varphi,\\lambda)}\\pi^{c}(\\varphi,\\lambda)d G(\\varphi)}\n$$  \n\nUsing (31) and substituting finally yields:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\lambda}{d L}\\frac{L}{\\lambda}=\\frac{\\int_{\\varphi^{*}}^{\\infty}\\pi^{c}(\\varphi,\\lambda)d G(\\varphi)}{\\int_{\\varphi^{*}}^{\\infty}\\pi^{c}(\\varphi,\\lambda)\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{p}(\\varphi,\\lambda)}d G(\\varphi)}\n$$  \n\nDefining $\\begin{array}{r}{\\pi^{c}(\\lambda):=\\int_{\\varphi^{*}}^{\\infty}\\pi^{c}(\\varphi,\\lambda)d G(\\varphi)}\\end{array}$ and using this expressing into equation (29):  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d x}{d L}\\frac{L}{x}=-\\frac{\\sigma_{p}(\\varphi,\\lambda)^{-1}-1}{2-\\rho}\\frac{1}{\\int_{\\varphi^{*}}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\pi^{c}(\\varphi,\\lambda)}{\\pi^{c}(\\lambda)}\\sigma_{p}(\\varphi,\\lambda)^{-1}d G(\\varphi)}\n$$  \n\nwhere $[\\sigma_{p}(\\varphi,\\lambda)]^{-1}$ is the demand elasticity and the denominator of the second ratio on the right-hand side is a profit-weighted average demand elasticity. Given that competition increases with market size and that the first and second-order conditions for profit maximization are met, this entails that the quantity consumed of each variety falls. This  \n\nimplies that the demand elasticity increases via MSLD and thus that markups decrease.   \nThis increases the labor share of firms everything else equal via equation (9).  \n\nTo show that the share of fixed labor cost in value-added decreases with market size, we must show that output rises and prices decrease less than the output rise for the average firm.54 Output is given by $q=x L$ . Totally differentiating the quantity produced and using equation (34) I obtain:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d q}{d L}\\frac{L}{q}=1-\\frac{\\sigma_{p}(\\varphi,\\lambda)^{-1}-1}{2-\\rho}\\frac{1}{\\int_{\\varphi^{*}}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\pi^{c}(\\varphi,\\lambda)}{\\pi^{c}(\\lambda)}\\sigma_{p}(\\varphi,\\lambda)^{-1}d G(\\varphi)}\n$$  \n\nFrom the inverse demand function, we obtain the change in prices by totally differentiating the equation:  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{d p}{d L}}{\\frac{L}{p}}={\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}}{\\frac{x}{p}}\\times{\\frac{d x}{d L}}{\\frac{L}{x}}+{\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial\\lambda}}{\\frac{\\lambda}{p}}\\times{\\frac{d\\lambda}{d L}}{\\frac{L}{\\lambda}}\n$$  \n\nUsing the terms derived above, I obtain:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d p}{d L}\\frac{L}{p}=\\frac{\\sigma_{p}(\\varphi,\\lambda)^{-1}-1}{\\sigma_{p}(\\varphi,\\lambda)^{-1}(2-\\rho)}-\\frac{1}{\\int_{\\varphi^{*}}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\pi^{c}(\\varphi,\\lambda)}{\\pi^{c}(\\lambda)}\\sigma_{p}(\\varphi,\\lambda)^{-1}d G(\\varphi)}\n$$  \n\nThe previous equation and equation (35) entail that the value-added $p q$ of theaverage firm rises with market size This decreases the share of fixed labor cost in value-added in equation (9).  \n\nProposition 2. (Reminded) $A$ market size increase reallocates profits towards larger firms and decreases their labor share relatively more through the fixed cost channel.  \n\nProof. Differentiting total operating profits with respect to $L$ we get (10) in the text. Differentiating (30) with respect to $L$ and applying the envelope theorem yields:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\Pi}{\\partial L}\\frac{L}{\\Pi}=-\\frac{u^{\\prime\\prime}}{\\lambda}\\frac{q^{2}}{L^{2}}\\frac{L}{\\Pi}=-p^{\\prime}\\frac{q^{2}}{L}\\frac{1}{\\left[p(x,\\lambda)-\\frac{1}{\\varphi}\\right]q}\n$$  \n\nUsing the first-order condition (23) we get:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\Pi}{\\partial L}\\frac{L}{\\Pi}=1\n$$  \n\nCombining (37), (31) and (33) in (10) gives:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\Pi}{d L}\\frac{L}{\\Pi}=1-\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{p}(\\varphi,\\lambda)}\\frac{\\int_{\\varphi^{*}}^{\\infty}\\pi^{c}(\\varphi,\\lambda)d G(\\varphi)}{\\int_{\\varphi^{*}}^{\\infty}\\pi^{c}(\\varphi,\\lambda)\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{p}(\\varphi,\\lambda)}d G(\\varphi)}\n$$  \n\nUsing $\\begin{array}{r}{\\pi^{c}(\\lambda):=\\int_{\\varphi^{*}}^{\\infty}\\pi^{c}(\\varphi,\\lambda)d G(\\varphi).}\\end{array}$ (38) writes as (11) in the text.  \n\nProfits rise with market size for firms that face a lower than average demand elasticity. Given MSLD, firms that are more productive than average experience an increase in their profits following an increase in market size.  \n\nIt is important to note that when preferences are CES, the inverse demand elasticity is constant and given by $\\begin{array}{r}{\\sigma_{p}(x_{i})=\\frac{1}{\\sigma}}\\end{array}$ With $\\sigma$ the elasticity of substitution across varieties. Both effects turn out to be equal to one and cancel each other out:  \n\n$$\n\\sigma_{p}(x_{i})={\\frac{1}{\\sigma}}\\Longrightarrow{\\frac{d\\Pi}{d L}}{\\frac{L}{\\Pi}}=0\n$$  \n\nIntensive margin reallocations are incompatible with CES preferences when the market structure is monopolistic. 口  \n\n### C.3 Open-Economy Framework  \n\nThis section sketches the open economy framework.55 There are two countries that populate the world economy. The domestic economy $D$ trades with a foreign economy denoted $F$ . This foreign economy is characterized by a market size level $L_{F}$ and a competition level $\\lambda_{F}$ . Preferences are the same on both markets which implies that per-consumer profits, quantity levels and revenues depend on both the competition level and the firm's productivity level, as in the closed economy case. As in Demidova and Rodriguez-Clare (2013), I assume that country $F$ is a small economy so that changes in market size abroad do not impact the number of domestic entrants, the competition level $\\lambda_{D}$ nor the domestic productivity cutoff in $D$  \n\nExporting is costly. There is a fixed cost of serving the foreign market for domestic firms. This fixed cost of exporting writes $f_{F}$ and is paid in units of domestic labor. Exporters also incur an additional iceberg trade cost so that exporting one unit of a good requires sending $\\tau>1$ units. This leads to the following total export profits for any  \n\ndomestic firm:56  \n\n$$\n\\Pi_{X}^{D}(\\varphi,\\lambda_{F})=\\pi^{c}\\big(\\frac{\\varphi}{\\tau},\\lambda_{F}\\big)L_{F}-f_{F}\n$$  \n\nAs before, total export profits $\\Pi_{X}^{D}(\\varphi,\\lambda_{F})$ are an increasing function of its first argument, so that firms below a certain export productivity threshold $\\varphi_{X}^{*}$ might decide not to export. This is given by the following condition:  \n\n$$\n\\Pi\\bigl(\\varphi_{X}^{*},\\lambda_{F}\\bigr)=0\\Longleftrightarrow\\pi^{c}\\bigl({\\frac{\\varphi_{X}^{*}}{\\tau}},\\lambda\\bigr)L_{F}=f_{F}\n$$  \n\nThe condition for producing on the domestic market for domestic firms is still given by (21).  \n\nFirms in $F$ draw their productivity level from a distribution $G_{F}(\\varphi)$ and a there is pool of entrants $N_{e}^{F}$ . Firms in $F$ will self-select into producing domestically and exporting to $D$ if they are productive enough with the relevant cutoff productivity levels given by the usual zero-profit conditions.  \n\nWhat matters for the purpose of the analysis is that an increase in $L_{F}$ generates intensive margin reallocation effects towards larger exporters from country $D$ . A change in market size abroad leads to an increase in the level of competition $\\lambda_{F}$ because profit opportunities are higher. Some firms enter because of the free-entry condition, which increases the degree of competition in $F$ 57 Because larger domestic exporters face a lower demand elasticity, the market size effect still dominates for these firms, leading to higher export sales and allowing them to grow relative to smaller exporters. This decreases their labor share relatively more via a larger decrease in their share of fixed labor cost in valueadded.  \n\n## D Appendix Tables  \n\nTable A1: Summary Statistics Main Sample   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Mean (1)</td><td>Standard Deviation (2)</td><td>Median (3)</td></tr><tr><td>Labor share (%)</td><td>70.3</td><td>17.4</td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td>In Export sales</td><td>5.1</td><td>2.8</td><td>5.1</td></tr><tr><td>In Value-added</td><td>7</td><td>1.6</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>In Labor compensation</td><td>6.6</td><td>1.6</td><td>6.6</td></tr><tr><td>Export-intensity (%)</td><td>18.9</td><td>24.1</td><td>8.2</td></tr><tr><td># Products exported</td><td>9</td><td>18</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td># Destinations served</td><td>9</td><td>13.4</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>△ Labor share</td><td>0.28</td><td>11.3</td><td>0.02</td></tr><tr><td>△ In Export sales</td><td>0.07</td><td>1.1</td><td>0.05</td></tr><tr><td> Shock</td><td>0.009</td><td>0.06</td><td>0.0004</td></tr><tr><td>△ In Value-added</td><td>0.04</td><td>0.3</td><td>0.03</td></tr><tr><td>△ ln Labor compensation</td><td>0.05</td><td>0.3</td><td>0.03</td></tr><tr><td>△ Export-intensity</td><td>0.5</td><td>11.9</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>△ In # Products exported</td><td>0.02</td><td>0.6</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>△ In # Destinations served</td><td>0.03</td><td>0.5</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td># Firms</td><td></td><td>71,095</td><td></td></tr><tr><td># Observations</td><td></td><td>355,746</td><td></td></tr><tr><td># Survivors (1995-2007)</td><td></td><td>5,634</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: The sample consists of exporting firms.

ROSENBAUM and DONALD B. RUBIN\\*  \n\nMatched sampling is a method for selecting units from a large reservoir of potential controls to produce a control group of modest size that is similar to a treated group with respect to the distribution of observed covariates. We illustrate the use of multivariate matching methods in an observational study of the effects of prenatal exposure to barbiturates on subsequent psychological development. A key idea is the use of the propensity score as a distinct matching variable.  \n\nKEY WORDS: Observational studies; Bias reduction; Propensity scores; Mahalanobis metric matching; Nearest available matching.  \n\n### 1. INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND; WHY MATCH?  \n\nMatched Sampling in Observational Studies. In many observational studies, there is a relatively small group of subjects exposed to a treatment and a much larger group of control subjects not exposed. When the costs associated with obtaining outcome or response data from subjects are high, some sampling of the control reservoir is often necessary. Matched sampling attempts to choose the controls for further study so that they are similar to the treated subjects with respect to background variables measured on all subjects.  \n\nThe Danish Cohort.We examine multivariate matched sampling using initial data from a proposed study of the effects on psychological development of prenatal exposure to barbiturates. The children under study were born between 1959 and 1961 and have been the object of other studies (e.g., Mednick et al. 1971; Zachau-Christiansen and Ross 1975). Prenatal and perinatal information is available for 221 barbiturate-exposed children and 7,027 unexposed children. A battery of measures of subsequent psychological development are to be obtained from all 221 exposed children, but cost considerations require sampling of the unexposed children to create a control group in which the measures will be obtained. The cost of the study will be approximately linear in the number of children studied—with basic costs that are largely independent of the number of children, and other costs associated with locating and examining the children that are approximately proportional to the number of children studied.  \n\nApproximate Efficiency Considerations.To obtain a rough idea of the loss in efficiency involved in not including all unexposed children as controls, suppose for the moment that there is no concern with biases between exposed and unexposed groups, in the sense that the mean difference between the groups can be regarded as an unbiased estimate of the effect of prenatal exposure to barbiturates. If control children are randomly sampled from among the 7,027 unexposed children, and if the variance, $\\sigma^{2}$ , of a particular psychological response is the same in the treated and control groups, then the standard error of the treated versus control difference in means will be $\\sigma(1/221~+~1/N_{c})^{1/2}$ , where $N_{c}$ is the number of control children studied. For $N_{c}~=~100$ 221,442 $(=2\\times221)$ ，663 $\\mathrm{~\\ensuremath~{~\\vert~\\phi~\\vert~=~3~\\times~}~}221;$ ，884 $(=4\\times$ 221), 2,210 $(=10\\times221).$ ), and 7,027 ( $=31.8\\times221$ the multipliers $(1/221~+~.1/N_{c})^{1/2}$ are, respectively, .121, .095, .082, .078, .075, .071, and .068. The cost of studying all 7,027 control children would be substantially greater than the cost of a modest sample, and the gain in precision would not be commensurate with the increase in cost. Cost considerations in this study led to a sample of 221 matched controls.  \n\nDistributionsofBackgroundVariablesBeforeMatching. In fact, forming a control group by random sampling of the unexposed children is not a good idea. Many of the unexposed children may not be good controls because they are quite different from all exposed children with respect to background variables. Consequently, controls will not be selected by random sampling, but rather by matched sampling on the basis of the covariates listed in Table 1. From the t statistics and standardized differences in Table 1, we see that the exposed and unexposed children differ considerably. The hope is that matched sampling will produce a control group that is similar to the treated group with respect to. these covariates.  \n\nFor Nontechnical Audiences, Matched Sampling Is Often a Persuasive Method of Adjustment. One virtue, not the least important, of matched sampling is that nontechnical audiences often find that matching, when successful, is a persuasive method of adjusting for imbalances in observed covariates. Although matching algorithms can be complex, the simplest methods, such as comparisons of sample moments, often suffice to indicate whether treated and matched control groups can be directly compared without bias due to observed covariates.  \n\nTable 1.

Perhaps the most obvious matching method involves categorizing each of the 20 variables in Table 1 and considering a treated child and control child as a suitable matched pair only if they fall in the same category on each variable. Unfortunately, even if each of the 20 variables is divided into just two categories, the 7,027 potential controls will be distributed among $2^{20}\\doteq1$ million matching categories, so exact matches may be hard to find for some treated children. If a version of categorical matching described by Rosenbaum and Rubin (in press) is applied to the current data, only 126 of the 221 treated children have exact matches, $8095(43\\%)$ of the treated children are discarded as unmatchable. Discarding treated children in this way can lead to serious biases, since the unmatched treated children differ systematically from the matched treated children. We consider only methods that match all 221 exposed children.  \n\n### 2. THEORY RELEVANT TO THE CHOICE OF A MATCHING METHOD  \n\n#### 2.1 The Most Important Scalar Matching Variable: The Propensity Score  \n\nLet x denote the vector of covariates for a particular child, and let the binary variable $z$ indicate whether the child was exposed $(z=1)$ or unexposed $(z=0)$ 0. The propensity score, $e(\\mathbf{x})$ , is the conditional probability of exposure given the covariates; that is, $e(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{Pr}(z=1|\\mathbf{x})$ ：Treated children and control children selected to have the same value of $e(\\mathbf{x})$ will have the same distributions of $\\mathbf{X}_{i}$ formally, $z$ and $\\mathbf{x}$ are conditionally independent given $e(\\mathbf{x})$ . Exact matching on $e(\\mathbf{x})$ will, therefore, tend to balance the $\\mathbf{x}$ distributions in the treated and control groups. Moreover, matching on $e(\\mathbf{x})$ and any function of $\\mathbf{x}$ , such as selected coordinates of $\\mathbf{x}$ will also balance x. (For proofs of these balancing properties of propensity scores, see Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983a, Theorems 1 and 2. For related discussions of propensity scores, see Rubin 1983, 1984; Rosenbaum 1984b; and Rosenbaum and Rubin 1984.) The propensity score is a potential matching variable because it does not depend on response information that will be collected after matching. Since exact adjustment for a known propensity score will, on average, remove all of the bias in $\\mathbf{x}$ , the propensity score $e(\\mathbf{x})$ is in a sense the most important scalar matching variable.  \n\nMatching on $e(\\mathbf{x})$ balances the observed covariates $\\mathbf{x}.$ however, unlike randomization, matching on $e(\\mathbf{x})$ doesnot balance unobserved covariates except to the extent that they are correlated with x. For discussion of methods for addressing the possible effects of unobserved covariates in observational studies, see Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983b) and Rosenbaum (1984a and in press).  \n\nIn practice, several issues need to be addressed before the propensity score can be used as a matching variable. First, the functional form of $e(\\mathbf{x})$ is rarely if ever known, at least in observational studies such as the one we describe, and therefore $e(\\mathbf{x})$ must be estimated from the available data. Second, exact matches will rarely be available, and so issues of closeness on $e(\\mathbf{x})$ must be addressed. Third, adjustment for $e(\\mathbf{x})$ balances $\\mathbf{X}$ only in expectation, that is, averaging over repeated studies. In any particular study, further adjustment for $\\mathbf{X}$ may be required to control chance imbalances in x. Such adjustments, for example by covariance analysis, are often used in randomized experiments to control chance imbalances in observed covariates.  \n\nAs noted by Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983a, sec. 2.3), matching on the propensity score is generalization to arbitrary $\\mathbf{x}$ distributions of discriminant matching for multivariate normal $\\mathbf{x}$ as proposed by Rubin (1970) and discussed by Cochran and Rubin (1973) and Rubin (1976a,b; 1979; 1980). Propensity matching is not, however, the same as any of the several procedures proposed by Miettinen ( 1976): the propensity score is not generally a confounder score (see Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983a, sec. 3.3, for discussion).  \n\n#### 2.2  Estimating the Propensity Score  \n\nWe estimated the propensity score in the Danish cohort using a logit model (Cox 1970):  \n\n$$\nq(\\mathbf{x})\\equiv\\log[(1-e(\\mathbf{x}))/e(\\mathbf{x})]=\\alpha+\\mathbf{\\beta}\\mathbf{\\mathbf{\\alpha}\\mathbf{\\beta}\\mathbf{\\mathbf{)}}^{T}\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\alpha$ and $\\upbeta$ are parameters to be estimated, $q(\\mathbf{x})$ is the log odds against exposure, and $\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})$ is a specified function, which in this instance included quadratic terms and transforms (see Table 1 for details). A logit model for $e(\\mathbf{x})$ can be formally derived from $\\mathbf{Pr}(\\mathbf{x}|z=t)$ if the latter has any of a variety of exponential family distributions, such as the multivariate normal $N(\\pmb{\\upmu}_{t},\\pmb{\\Sigma})$ , the multivariate logit model for binary data in Cox (1972), the quadratic exponential family of Dempster (1971), or the multinomial/multivariate normal distribution of Dempster (1973); see Rosenbaum and Rubin [1983a, sec. 2.3(ii)] for details.  \n\nThe sample means of the maximum likelihood estimates ${\\hat{q}}(\\mathbf{x})$ Oof $q(\\mathbf{x})$ are 3.06 and 3.76 in the treated and control groups, respectively. The sample variance of ${\\hat{q}}(\\mathbf{x})$ is2.3 times greater in the treated group than in the control group. The standardized difference for ${\\hat{q}}(\\mathbf{x})$ is .77 (calculated as in the footnote to Table 1), which, as one would expect, is larger than the standardized difference for any single variable in Table 1. In the treated and control groups, respectively, the minimum values of ${\\hat{q}}(\\mathbf{x})$ are $-3.9$ and - .6; the lower quartiles, 2.5 and 3.2; the medians, 3.1 and 3.7; the upper quartiles, 3.8 and 4.2; and the maximums, 5.1 and 7.5. Three treated children have ${\\hat{q}}(\\mathbf{x})$ values lower than any control child: their ${\\hat{q}}(\\mathbf{x})$ values are -- 3.9, - 1.3, and $-1.2$  \n\nThere is, then, a substantial difference along the propensity score. The larger variance in the treated groups suggests that finding appropriate matches will be relatively more difficult than if the variances were equal (Cochran and Rubin 1973, Table 2.3.1; Rubin 1973a, Table 5.1; Rubin 1980, Table 1). The reason for the difficulty is the concentration of the ${\\hat{q}}(\\mathbf{x})$ 's around 3.76 in the control group and the wider dispersion of the $\\hat{q}({\\bf x})^{\\prime}$ s around 3.06 in the treated group: for matching, controls are required with low values of ${\\hat{q}}(\\mathbf{x})$ , which are relatively uncommon in the control group.  \n\n#### 2.4 Matching Methods That Are Equal-Percent Bias Reducing  \n\nThe mean bias or expected difference in $\\mathbf{X}$ prior to matching is $E(\\mathbf{x}|z=1)-E(\\mathbf{x}|z=0)$ , whereas the mean bias in $\\mathbf{X}$ after matching is $E(\\bf{x}|z=\\bf{1})\\to\\pmb{\\upmu}_{0\\bf{M}}$ ，where $\\pmb{\\upmu}_{0\\mathsf{M}}$ is the expected value of $\\mathbf{x}$ in the matched control group. Generally, $\\upmu_{0\\mathrm{M}}$ depends on the matching method used, whereas $E(\\mathbf{x}|z~=~1)$ and $E(\\mathbf{x}|z\\textrm{}=0)$ depend only on population characteristics. As defined by Rubin (1976a,b), a matching method is equal-percent bias reducing (EPBR) if the reduction in bias is the same for each coordinate of $\\mathbf{X}$ ,that is, if  \n\n$$\nE(\\mathbf{x}|z=1)-\\mathbf{\\nabla}|\\mathbf{\\varepsilon}_{0\\mathrm{M}}=\\gamma\\{E(\\mathbf{x}|z=1)-E(\\mathbf{x}|z=0)\\}\n$$  \n\nfor some scalar $0\\leqslant\\gamma\\leqslant1$ . If a matching method is not EPBR, then matching actually increases the bias for some linear functions of $\\mathbf{x}$ . If little is known about the relationship between $\\mathbf{x}$ and the response variables that will be collected after matching, then EPBR matching methods are attractive, since they are the only methods that reduce bias in all variables having linear regression on $\\mathbf{X}$ . Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983a, sec. 3.2) show that matching on the population propensity score alone is EPBR whenever $\\mathbf{x}$ has a linear regression on some scalar function of $e$ ; that is, whenever $E(\\mathbf{x}|e)=\\mathbf{\\alpha}+\\mathbf{\\gamma}\\mathbf{\\gamma}^{T}g(e)$ for some scalar function $g(\\cdot)$  \n\n### 3. CONSTRUCTING A MATCHED SAMPLE: AN EMPIRICAL COMPARISON OF THREE MULTIVARIATE METHODS  \n\n#### 3.1  Overview: How Much Importance Should Be Given to the Propensity Score?  \n\nMatched samples were constructed by using three different methods that matched every treated child to one control child. By design, all three methods required exact matches on sex. The three methods differed in the importance given to the estimated propensity score relative to the other variables in $\\mathbf{x}$  \n\n#### 3.2 Nearest Available Matching on the Estimated Propensity Score  \n\nWith nearest available propensity score matching, (a) treated and control children are randomly ordered; (b) the first treated child is matched with the control child of the same sex having the nearest ${\\hat{q}}(\\mathbf{x})$ ,and both children are removed from the lists of treated and control children; (c) step (b) is repeated for the remaining unmatched treated children. The decision to define distance in terms of $\\hat{q}(\\mathbf{x})$ rather than $\\hat{e}(\\mathbf{x})$ was somewhat but not entirely arbitrary and probably had negligible effect. It did, however, avoid the compression of the $\\hat{e}(\\mathbf{x})$ scale near 0 and 1, and moreover, ${\\hat{q}}(\\mathbf{x})$ was more nearly normally distributed, which is relevant in the context of Section 3.4. Nearest available matching on a scalar covariate $x$ was studied by Rubin (1970), reviewed by Cochran and Rubin (1973), and extended by Rubin (1973a,b); its application to matching on linear discriminant scores with bivariate normal $\\mathbf{X}$ was studied, using Monte Carlo, by Rubin (1979, 1980). The effects of random ordering in step (a) rather than ordering by $q({\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}})$ are discussed by Rubin (1973a).  \n\nIn Tables 2 and 3, column 1 describes the balance obtained in the samples matched by nearest available propensity matching. Note that the standardized differences in Table 2 have the same denominator as the standardized differences in Table 1, whereas the $t$ statistics indicated by the footnotes to Table 2 have denominators that are affected by the matching and so are not directly comparable. (For discussionof therelationshipbetweent statisticsoncovariate means and the coverage of confidence intervals for treatment effects formed by ignoring the variable, see, e.g., Cochran 1965, sec. 3.1.) The two-sample t statistics (values indicated by pluses in Table 2) are relevant for comparing the distributions of the covariates in the treated and matched control groups. The paired t statistics (values indicated by asterisks) are relevant for assessing the effects of residual biases in the covariates in analyses of outcome variables based on matched pair differences.  \n\nTable 2.Covariate Imbalance in Matched Samples: Standardized Differences (%)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Factor</td><td rowspan=\"2\">Nearest available matching on the propensity score</td><td colspan=\"2\">Mahalanobis metricmatching</td></tr><tr><td>Including the propensity score</td><td>Within propensity score calipers</td></tr><tr><td>Child characteristics</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Sex</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Twin</td><td>-3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>SIBPOS</td><td>-5</td><td>5*</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>C-age</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>-6</td></tr><tr><td>Mothercharacteristics</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>SES</td><td>-10*</td><td>5</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>-- 17 +</td><td>3</td><td>-7*</td></tr><tr><td>Single</td><td>-7</td><td>-3*</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>M-age</td><td>-8*</td><td>5</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>-8</td><td>3</td><td>-9+**</td></tr><tr><td>Characteristicsof</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>thepregnancy</td><td>-0</td><td>-3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>WGTHGT3 PBC415</td><td>~14+*</td><td>6*</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>PRECLAM</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>RESPILL</td><td>-7</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>LENGEST</td><td>-12+</td><td>-3*</td><td>-4</td></tr><tr><td>Cigarette</td><td>0</td><td>10+***</td><td>9***</td></tr><tr><td>Drugs</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Antihistamine</td><td>-3</td><td>4</td><td>9*</td></tr><tr><td>Hormone</td><td>8*</td><td>6***</td><td>6*</td></tr><tr><td>HRMG1</td><td>-2</td><td> 7**</td><td>-6</td></tr><tr><td>HRMG2</td><td>-2</td><td>-5**</td><td>-9*</td></tr><tr><td>HRMG3</td><td>-3</td><td>-8**</td><td>-11*</td></tr><tr><td>g(x)</td><td>-3**</td><td>-20++****</td><td>-3**</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNOTE: The standardized difference in percent is $100(\\overline{{x}}_{1}-\\overline{{x}}_{0M})/[(s_{1}^{2}+~s_{0\\mathsf{R}}^{2})/2]^{1/2}$ where for each covariate, $\\overline{{x}}_{1}$ and $\\overline{{x}}_{0M}$ are the samplemeans in the treated group andmatched control group and $s_{\\uparrow}^{2}$ and $s_{0\\mathsf{R}}^{2}$ are the sample variances in the treated group and control reservoir.Notethat thedenominatorofthestandardizeddifferenceisthesameforallthree matchingmethods.Thevaluesofpaired()and two-sample $({}^{+})$ t-statisticsareindicated as folliows:\\* and $^+$ ,between 1.0 and 1.5 in absolute value;\\*\\*and $^{++}$ ,between1.5and 2.0 in absolutevalue; $\\bigstar\\bigstar\\bigstar$ between2and3in absolutevalue;\\*\\*\\*,above3 in absolute value.  \n\nIn Table 3, the sample percent reduction in bias for a covariate is $100(1\\textrm{--}b_{M}/b_{I})$ ,where $b_{I}$ and $b_{M}$ are the treated versus control differences in covariate means initially and after matching, respectively. When the initial mean sample bias, $b_{I}$ , is small, the sample percent reduction in bias, 100(1 $-\\ensuremath{b_{M}}/\\ensuremath{b_{I}})$ , is quite unstable; therefore, we report percent reductions only for variables with large initial biases (i.e., standardized differences above $20\\%$ in Table 1).  \n\nTables 2 and 3 both suggest that nearest available matching on the propensity score has removed almost all of the mean difference along the propensity score——arguably the mostimportantvariable-and that therehasbeensubstantial reduction in the standardized differences for most variables. Still, the residual differences on several variables (Education, PBC415, LENGEST) are bothersome; further analytical adjustments for these variables might be required, for example, using analysis of covariance on matched-pair differences (Rubin 1973b, 1979).  \n\n#### 3.3  Mahalanobis Metric Matching Including the Propensity Score  \n\nMahalanobis  metric matching has been described by Cochran and Rubin (1973) and Rubin (1976a) and studied in detail by Carpenter (1977) and Rubin (1979, 1980). With nearest available Mahalanobis metric matching, treated and control children are randomly ordered. The first treated child is matched with the closest control child of the same sex, where distance is defined by the Mahalanobis distance:  \n\n$$\nd(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v})=(\\mathbf{u}-\\mathbf{v})^{T}\\mathbf{C}_{0\\mathrm{R}}^{-1}(\\mathbf{u}-\\mathbf{v}),\n$$  \n\nwhere u and $\\mathbf{v}$ are values of $\\{\\mathbf{x}^{T},\\hat{q}(\\mathbf{x})\\}^{T}$ and $\\mathbf{C}_{\\mathrm{0R}}$ is the sample covariance matrix of $\\{\\mathbf{x}^{T},\\hat{q}(\\mathbf{x})\\}$ in the control reservoir. The two matched children are then removed from the treated and control lists, and the process is repeated. In the case of multivariate normal covariates with common covariance matrix in treated and control groups, Rubin (1976a, Theorem 2) has shown that Mahalanobis metric matching is EPBR.  \n\nTable 3.Covariate Imbalance in Matched Samples: PercentReductionsinBiasforVariablesWith Substantial Initial Bias(standardized absolutebiasof $20\\%$ orgreater)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">propensity score</td><td rowspan=\"2\">Nearest available matchingonthe</td><td colspan=\"2\">Mahalanobismetricmatching</td></tr><tr><td>Includingthe propensity score</td><td>Within propensity scorecalipers</td></tr><tr><td>Single</td><td>84</td><td>93</td><td>95</td></tr><tr><td>Hormone</td><td>71</td><td>79</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>SES</td><td>140</td><td>81</td><td>105</td></tr><tr><td>M-age</td><td>114</td><td>91</td><td>102</td></tr><tr><td>q(x)</td><td>96</td><td>74</td><td>96</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThe results of applying Mahalanobis metric matching are given in column 2 of Tables 2 and 3. As one might expect, Mahalanobis metric matching is somewhat more successful than propensity matching in reducing the standardized differences for individual coordinates of $\\mathbf{x}$ , but it is far less successful in reducing the standardized difference along the propensity score. The standardized difference of $20\\%$ and two-sample t statistic of $-1.99$ for ${\\hat{q}}(\\mathbf{x})$ are disturbing.  \n\nMahalanobis metric matching produces several large matched-pair $t$ statistics, as indicated in the footnotes to Table 2. The standard deviations of the within-pair differences in covariate values are smaller than under nearest available propensity score matching, so the matched-pair $t$ statistics are larger. As noted previously (Sec. 3.2), the $t$ statistics for different methods are not directly comparable. Nevertheless, the large values of the matched-pair $t$ statistics indicate that analyses based on matched-pair differences can be misleading unless analysis of covariance is used to control within-pair differences due to $\\mathbf{x}$  \n\n#### 3.4  Nearest Available Mahalanobis Metric Matching Within Calipers Defined by the Propensity Score  \n\nIn an effort to obtain the best features of both previous methods, we now consider a hybrid matching method that first defines a subset of potential controls who are close to each treated child on the propensity score (i.e., within “calipers,\" Althauser and Rubin 1971) and then selects the control child from this subset by using nearest available Mahalanobis metric matching (for variables $\\{\\mathbf{x},\\hat{q}(\\mathbf{x})\\})$ . The details of the procedure are given in Figure 1. With multivariate normal covariates having common covariance matrices in treated and control groups, and with ${\\hat{q}}(\\mathbf{x})$ replaced by its population value (the linear discriminant), this matching method would be EPBR, since each of the two stages would reduce bias in $\\mathbf{X}$ by a constant percentage. A computational advantage of this method is a substantial reduction in the number of Mahalanobis distances that need to be computed. The method in Section 3.3 required the computation of about 1.5 million Mahalanobis distances.  \n\n![](images/790a72182718ea6a89c80dd18428ff8b3e49a7bfa8dfe46796afcc2ecd88dec1.jpg)  \nFigure 1.NearestAvailableMahalanobisMetricMatchingWithin Calipers Defined by the Propensity Score.  \n\nThe caliper width, $c$ , used in step 2 of Figure 1 was determined by using results from Cochran and Rubin (1973) concerning the performance of caliper matching. Write $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{1}}^{2}$ and $\\sigma_{0{\\tt R}}^{2}$ for the variances of ${\\hat{q}}(\\mathbf{x})$ in the treated and untreated groups, and let $\\sigma=[(\\sigma_{1}^{2}+\\sigma_{0R}^{2})/2]^{1/2}$ .Table 2.3.1 of Cochran and Rubin (1973) suggests that when $\\sigma_{1}^{2}/\\sigma_{0{\\tt R}}^{2}=2\\$ , a caliper width of $c=.2\\sigma$ would remove $98\\%$ of the bias in a normally distributed covariate, that $c=.4\\sigma$ would remove $93\\%$ ,and that $c=.6\\sigma$ would remove $86\\%$ . That table also suggests that narrower caliper widths (i.e., smaller values of $c$ are required as $\\sigma_{1}^{2}/\\sigma_{0{\\tt R}}^{2}$ increasesThepoint estimate of $\\sigma_{1}^{2}/\\sigma_{0{\\mathrm R}}^{2}$ for $\\hat{q}(\\mathbf{x})$ s $s_{1}^{2}/s_{0\\mathrm{R}}^{2}$ $=2.3$ . Therefore, in the hope of removing at least $90\\%$ of the bias along ${\\hat{q}}(\\mathbf{x})$ by caliper matching, we took $c=.25s$ $=(.25)(.930)=.232$ , where $s=[(s_{\\mathrm{l}}^{2}+s_{\\mathrm{0R}}^{2})/2]^{1/2}$ . (For further discussion of caliper matching, see Cochran 1972 and Raynor 1983.) There were four treated children who had no available matches within the calipers; following step 2 of Figure 1, they were matched with the nearest available control on ${\\hat{q}}(\\mathbf{x})$  \n\nSome results of this matching appear in column 3 of Tables 2 and 3. Mahalanobis metric matching within calipers defined by the propensity score appears superior to the two other methods: it is better than matching on the propensity score in that it yields fewer standardized differences above $10\\%$ in absolute value, and it is better than Mahalanobis metric matching in controlling the difference along the propensity score.  \n\n#### 3.5 Nonlinear Response Surfaces  \n\nTables 1-3 compare the three matching methods in terms of the means of $\\mathbf{x}$ in the treated and matched control groups. If, however, the response has a nonlinear regression on $\\mathbf{x}$ in the treated and control groups, then equal $\\mathbf{X}$ means in matched samples do not necessarily indicate the absence of bias due to $\\mathbf{x}$ . For example, if the regressions on $\\mathbf{x}$ are quadratic, then the means on $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{x}\\mathbf{x}^{T}$ are both relevant. Table 4 summarizes the standardized biases for $230~=$ $({}_{2}^{20})~+~2~\\times~20$ variables: the 20 coordinates of $(\\mathbf{x},{\\hat{q}}(\\mathbf{x}))$ with sex excluded because exact matches for sex were obtained, the squares of these 20 variables, and the cross products of pairs of these variables. The third matching method—Mahalanobis metric matching within propensity score calipers-—-appears clearly superior.  \n\nTable 4.Summarized Standardized Differences $(\\dot{m}\\%)$ for Covariates, Squares of Covariates, and CrossProducts of Covariates   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Rootmean square</td><td>Maximum absolute</td></tr><tr><td>Prior to matching</td><td>24</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>Nearestavailablematchingon thepropensityscore</td><td>9</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>Mahalanobis metric matching Including the propensity score</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Usingpropensity score calipers</td><td>7</td><td>76 27</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n$\\overline{{100(\\overline{{b}}2+s_{b}^{2})^{1/2}}}$ whereband $s_{b}^{2}$ are the sample mean and variance of standardized differencesforthe $({\\frac{20}{2}})+2({\\frac{20}{1}})={\\tilde{2}}30$ variables.  \n\n## 4. SUMMARY  \n\nWhen combined with covariance adjustments of matchedpair differences, multivariate matched sampling is known to be one of the most robust methods for reducing bias due to imbalances in observed covariates (Rubin 1973b, 1979). Three methods for multivariate matched sampling have been illustrated and compared on data concerning the effects of prenatal barbiturate exposure. The first method was nearest available matching on the estimated propensity score; this method required less computation than the others and was fairly successful in reducing bias. The second method was nearest available Mahalanobis metric matching using all variables and the estimated propensity score; this method produced smaller standardized differences for  individual variables but left a substantial difference along the propensity score. The third method—Mahalanobis metric matching within calipers defined by the estimated propensity score——appeared superior to the others with respect to balancing the covariates, their squares, and their cross products. Since the current study has examined just three possible methods on a single set of data, additional work on multivariate matching is needed in several areas: (a) theory concerning the effects on the best choice of matching method of (i) reservoir size, (i) the magnitude of initial biases, (iii) dimensionality of $\\mathbf{X}$ , and (iv) covariate distributions; (b) theory concerning multivariate measures of the quality of matched samples involving non-Gaussian covariates; and (c) further empirical studies of multivariate matching methods.  \n\n[Received December 1983.

In our model, investors? income has two sources, wages and dividends, that grow stochastically over time. As a consequence, the fraction of total income produced by wages changes over time de-pending on economic conditions. We show that as this fraction fluctuates, the risk premium that investors require to hold stocks varies as well. We test the main implications of the model and find substantial support for it. A regression of stock returns on lagged values of the labor income to consumption ratio produces statistically significant coefficients and adjusted $\\mathsf{R}^{2}$ 's that are larger than those generated when using the dividend price ratio. Tests of the cross sectional implication find considerable improvements on the performance of both the conditional CAPM and CCAPM when compared to their unconditional counterparts.  \n\nTano Santos   \nGraduate School of Business,   \nUniversity of Chicago   \nand NBER   \njesus.santos@gsb.uchicago.edu   \nPietro Veronesi   \nGraduate School of Business,   \nUniversity of Chicago,   \nNBER, and CEPR   \npietro.veronesi@gsb.uchicago.edu  \n\n### 1. INTRODUCTION  \n\nPredictability, both in the time series and the cross section of stock returns, has been the focus of much research in the field of empirical finance. At the time-series level, the main finding is that variables like the price-dividend ratio and term premia can predict stock returns variation at long horizons.1 As for the cross section of stock returns, predictability translates into the use of conditioning variables to improve on the performance of the CAPM and Consumption CAPM (CCAPM) versus their unconditional counterparts. These two strands of the literature connect because lagged instruments that are shown to predict market returns are natural conditioning variables for tests of the cross section.2  \n\nExtant economic explanations for the time-series and cross-sectional predictability are notably sparse and detached from one another. Time series predictability is obtained by either investors’ learning about some unobservable fundamental process as in Timmermann (1993, 1996) and Veronesi (2000) or cyclical variations in investors' risk aversion as in Campbell and Cochrane (1999) and Barberis et al. (2001). Instead, at the cross-sectional level, the theoretical models concentrate either on portfolio constraints (Cuoco (1997) or the exploitation of growth options’ opportunities (Gomes et al. (2000)). A notable exception is Berk et al. (1999) who construct a model of firm's investment with implications for the cross section and that yields interest rates as predictors of market returns.  \n\nand consumption growth varies as well, thereby generating changes in the risk premia investors require to hold stocks. Clearly some portfolios will be more sensitive than others to these fuctuations and as a consequence will demand different premia, generating the desired cross sectional predictability.  \n\nAn obvious candidate for this additional source of consumption is labor income and it is to this interpretation that we restrict ourselves throughout the paper. Labor income, after all, accounts for more than 80% of total consumption on average and, as shown in Figure 1, varies between 75% and 90%. At the aggregate level it is rather intuitive that periods characterized by a high labor-income to consumption ratio should also imply a low expected excess return: Since most of consumption is not stemming from the stock market, investors do not need to require a high premium. A similar intuition holds at the cross-sectional level.  \n\nTo formalize this intuition we write a minimal extension of the standard Lucas (1978) exchange economy to accommodate, in a tractable model, the possibility of multiple sources of consumption. In our set up investors receive both dividend income from many risky securities and “other income,” such as labor income. By concentrating on the “fractions\" of dividends and wages to consumption, and under conventional preferences, we can solve for stock prices in closed form and obtain simple formulas for stock returns. As mentioned, our first finding is that the ratio of labor income to consumption is the main determinant of the predictability of stock market returns because of the intuitive mechanism developed above. In addition, we also obtain a stochastic beta representation for the cross-section of stock returns as well as intuitive formulas for the “betas\" themselves. These “betas\" are indeed mainly affected by the labor income to consumption ratio with a sensitivity that is asset specific and depends on the characteristics of the underlying dividend process.  \n\nWe test the main predictions of the model by running predictive regressions using both the ratio of labor income over total consumption and/or the dividend price ratio as explanatory variables. Our frst main empirical finding is that for the overall sample 1946-1999 the ratio of labor income to total consumption performs much better than the (log) dividend price ratio to forecast future returns. For example, the $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ of the one year predictive regression is $6.1\\%$ (against 3.9% for the log dividend-price ratio) and it reaches 34.6% for the four year ahead regression (against 20.7% for the dividend price ratio.) Since this result may be driven by the inclusion of the 1995-1999 period in the data sample (which witnessed a low dividend price ratio and high returns,) we also run regressions over the more conventional 1952-1994 data period where it is known that the dividend price ratio is working well (see e.g. Campbell et al. (1997)). In this case the dividend price ratio is performing better than the wages-to-consumption ratio, but the latter is still a significant regressor at long horizons where it still produces a good forecasting power: The $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ is 3% for the one year ahead regression but it reaches 22.6% for the 4 year ahead regression.  \n\nInterestingly, the inclusion of both regressors - either linearly or in a multiplicative fashion - dramatically improves upon the predictive power of the regression at every horizon. For example, in the 1952-1994 sample the (adjusted) $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ ranges between $25.1\\%$ atthe oneyear horizon to above 60% at the four year horizon. This finding is indeed fully consistent with our model, which implies that both expected returns and the dividend yield are non linear functions of the labor income to consumption ratio. It follows that the dividend yield may proxy for the non linear relation between expected returns and this ratio and it is then not surprising that it improves the predictability.  \n\nThe cross-sectional implications of the model, that is, the stochastic beta representation for the expected returns of individual securities, are investigated next. Roughly, we test whether conditioning the CAPM and the CCAPM by the share of labor income to consumption improves the fit on the cross section relative to their unconditional counterparts.  \n\nTo test these hypothesis we use a set of portfolios that has become standard in the literature, the 25 Fama and French (1992, 1993) portfolios, which are portfolios sorted by size and book to market. A novel feature though is that we use a longer sample period than the one originally used by these two authors and others after them. Whereas the standard sample period is 1963-1998 in this paper we use the 1946-1998 period, but we also report results in the more restricted sample.  \n\nAs many have noted before us, the standard CAPM explains little of the cross sectional variation in stock returns. The adjusted $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ is only 10%, that is, the unconditional CAPM can only explain 10% of the cross sectional variation in returns. In contrast the inclusion of the returns on the market portfolio scaled by the fraction of labor income to consumption considerably increases the explanatory power of the CAPM. In this case the adjusted $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ is $43\\%$ . We show that this cross term is significant and it's relevance robust to several specifications. Furthermore when the fraction of labor income to consumption enters independently the adjusted $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ is as a high as $61\\%$ , a notable improvement over unconditional versions of the model.  \n\nWe test whether the results are present in the more standard period of 1963-1998. They are. In this case the specification suggested by our model can explain as much as 54% of the cross sectional variation in returns whereas the unconditional CAPM explains a puny $-2\\%$  \n\nWe also test whether our specification is robust to the “dating convention” advocated by Jagannathan and Wang (1996) which provides investors with an information set consistent with the release of data by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In an environment where human capital is a tradable asset investors need to know it's price in order to form their optimal portfolio. Jagannathan and Wang (1996) argue that that it is not reasonable to assume that investors posses information on data collected by the BEA and that is released with delay. Our results are robust to this dating convention. Furthermore we show that the role of labor income growth in tests of the cross section as a proxy for human capital returns depends critically on the dating convention adopted by the researcher.  \n\nBecause this paper shows evidence pertaining to both the time series of the aggregate market and the cross section of stock returns it naturally relates to the two strands of the empirical asset pricing literature that have respectively dealt with these two issues. Our work though presents important differences with these two bodies of evidence.  \n\nFirst, the early predictability literature documents the forecasting power of either prices scaled by dividends or earnings and of various interest rate measures.3 More recently Lettau and Ludvigson (2000a) (LLa henceforth) manipulate the budget constraint to show that the consumption to total wealth ratio, which includes labor income and financial wealth, contains information about stock returns.  \n\nOur paper adds to this literature by providing yet more evidence on the predictability of stock returns. A critical difference between our work and previous empirical research though is the fact that our predictive variable is neither a version of the stock price scaled by either dividends or earnings nor some other financial variable like the term premium, but rather a pure macroeconomic variable. Furthermore, it does not need to be estimated as in LLa as it is directly observable. Finally it is important to emphasize that our testable implication does not result from basic manipulations of either the definition of returns (Cochrane (2001), page 395-6) or the budget constraint as in LLa.  \n\nfar back as Mayers (1972) and Fama and Schwert (1977) and, more recently, authors like Jagannathan and Wang (1996) and Campbell (1996) have included human capital returns to improve on the definition of the market portfolio. For instance, in tests of the cross section, Jagannathan and Wang (1996) find that the inclusion of human capital in the definition of the market portfolio considerably improves the ability of the CAPM to explain the cross section of portfolios sorted by size and beta.  \n\nIn a different direction Lettau and Ludvigson (2000b) (LLb henceforth) explicitly model the discount factor as a function of current information and show that the ratio of consumption to total wealth, a variable shown to predict market returns in LLa, is an important instrument for tests of the conditional CAPM and CCAPM. In particular they show that their version of the conditional CAPM and CCAPM provides a remarkable fit to the 25 Fama and French (1993) portfolios.  \n\nAs already emphasized our conditioning variable is not a version of the price scaled by any other variable, whether it be earnings, dividends, or consumption itself. In this sense it is free from the concerns advanced by Berk (1995), namely, that because returns are mechanically related to prices, ratios that have prices either in the numerator or denominator are in turn automatically related to returns. For this reason these ratios cannot identify whether they correlate with the cross section because they proxy for economically meaningful forces or some other reason, like misspricing effects.  \n\nWe close this introduction by pointing out that our framework does not attempt to resolve other long standing issues in the field of empirical asset pricing, such as the equity-premium puzzle or the risk-free rate puzzle. Rather, it illustrates how alternative sources of income other than dividends may have a role to play in accounting for the empirical properties of stock return data. As a consequence, and to offer a clear picture of the economic forces at work in our set up, we depart from the recent trend of investigating alternative preference specifications to match the moments of stock and bond returns to focus on the well known iso-elastic case. Clearly a full account of empirical properties of returns require additional ingredients like variation in the investors attitudes towards risk, as in Campbell and Cochrane (1999) or Barberis, Huang, and Santos (2001) but we do not attempt such a comprehensive exercisehere.  \n\nSection II contains the model and discussion of the assumptions. Section IHI provides the results that motivate our empirical strategy. Data description and the empirical results are reported in section IV. Section V concludes. Proofs, tables, and figures are in the appendix.  \n\n### II. THE MODEL  \n\nConsider a standard pure exchange economy populated by identical investors whose utilit.y function is4  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{U(C_{t},t)=e^{-\\phi t}\\log\\left(C_{t}\\right),}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $C_{t}$ denotes consumption at time $t$ . There is a riskless asset in zero net supply that pays a continuous rate of return $r_{t}$ . There are $n-1$ risky assets in positive net supply that pay a continuous dividend rate $D_{t}^{i}$ for $i=2,3,\\dots,n$ , and that trade competitively at a price $P_{t}^{i}$ . Agents are endowed with an additional source of income other than dividends from these competitively traded financial assets. In accordance with our empirical strategy below, we assume that this other income springs from a human capital asset that pays a continuous wage rate $w_{t}$ .5 For ease of notation we will sometimes denote $w_{t}$ by $D_{t}^{1}$  \n\nThe problem of the investor is then the usual one:  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{max}_{N_{t}^{i},C_{t}}E_{0}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\infty}U(C_{t},t)d t\\right]\n$$  \n\nsubject to the standard dynamic budget constraint  \n\n$$\nd W_{t}=\\sum_{i=2}^{n}N_{t}^{i}\\left(d P_{t}^{i}+D_{t}^{i}d t\\right)+\\left(W_{t}-\\sum_{i=2}^{n}N_{t}^{i}P_{t}^{i}\\right)r_{t}d t+\\left(w_{t}-C_{t}\\right)d t,\n$$  \n\nwhere $N_{t}^{i}$ denotes the number of shares of stock $i$ held by the investor and $W_{t}$ is his total wealth at time $t$  \n\nA rational expectations equilibrium is then a set of price functions $P_{t}^{i}$ , allocation process $N_{t}^{\\i}$ , and consumption process $C_{t}$ such that agents maximize and markets clear, that is, $N_{t}^{\\i}=1$ or all $i=2,3,\\hdots,n$ and $\\begin{array}{r}{C_{t}=w_{t}+\\sum_{i=2}^{n}D_{t}^{i}}\\end{array}$  \n\nAs already mentioned, our emphasis is on the general payoff structure available to the investor rather than the more traditional concerns on preferences. A basic requirement in modeling this general payoff structure is that dividends and wages add up to an aggregate consumption process that is consistent with the observed behavior of the US time series, which is roughly a random walk. Once this requirement is met, the proposed endowment structure will also naturally embed the standard endowment economy of Lucas (1978).  \n\nWe start then by modeling consumption growth as  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d C_{t}}{C_{t}}=\\mu_{c}d t+\\sigma_{c}d\\mathbf{B}_{t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mu_{c}$ is a scalar and $\\sigma_{c}$ is a $1\\times n$ vector of constants and $\\mathbf{B}_{t}=\\left(B_{t}^{1},\\ldots,B_{t}^{n}\\right)^{\\prime}$ are $n$ independent Brownian motions. The specification of $\\mu_{c}$ is flexible and in particular it can be time varying to reflect any weak autocorrelation in consumption growth that may be observed in the data.  \n\nIn order to model dividends and wages define first the share of these dividends and wages over consumption:  \n\n$$\ns_{t}^{w}=s_{t}^{1}=\\frac{w_{t}}{C_{t}}\\quad\\mathrm{and}\\quad s_{t}^{i}=\\frac{D_{t}^{i}}{C_{t}}\\quad\\mathrm{for}\\quad i=2,...,n,\n$$  \n\nBy construction then wages and dividends will add up to the consumption process in (1) if $\\textstyle\\sum_{j=1}^{n}s_{t}^{j}=1$ . To illustrate the economic forces at work we propose a simple process for the share dynamics and leave for the appendix the description of a richer, but equally tractable, model. In particular we assume that:  \n\n$$\nd s_{t}^{i}=a\\left(\\overline{{s}}^{i}-s_{t}^{i}\\right)d t+s_{t}^{i}\\sigma_{i}\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{t}\\right)d\\mathbf{B}_{t}\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\sigma_{i}\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{t}\\right)=\\nu_{i}-\\sum_{j=1}^{n}s_{t}^{j}\\nu_{j},\n$$  \n\n$\\nu_{i}$ for $i=1,2,\\dots,n$ are $n$ dimensional vectors, and $\\mathbf{s}_{t}=\\left(s_{t}^{1},\\ldots,s_{t}^{n}\\right)$ . Our choice for the functional form of the volatility function (4) guarantees that both $s_{t}^{i}>0$ and $\\textstyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n}s_{t}^{i}=1$  \n\nWe model then these shares as a mean reverting process with a common reversion speed, $a$ , and conditional expected value given by  \n\n$$\nE_{t}\\left[s_{\\tau}^{i}\\right]=\\overline{{s}}^{i}+\\left(s_{t}^{i}-\\overline{{s}}^{i}\\right)e^{-a(\\tau-t)}.\n$$  \n\nIf a particular “tree” is contributing little to consumption compared to its unconditional level, as expressed by it's low $s_{t}^{i}$ , then one should expect a high positive growth rate of this share. In the future a larger percentage of consumption will come from asset $i$  \n\nBut, as it is intuitive, what is critical in the valuation of any of the available assets is whether on average they grow when consumption does. It can be easily shown that the  \n\ncovariance between consumption growth and share growth is given by  \n\n$$\nc o v_{t}\\left(\\frac{d s_{t}^{i}}{s_{t}^{i}},\\frac{d C_{t}}{C_{t}}\\right)=\\theta_{i}-\\sum_{j=1}^{n}s^{j}\\theta_{j}\n$$  \n\nwith $\\theta_{i}\\:=\\:\\nu_{i}\\sigma_{c}^{\\prime}$ . The parameters $\\theta_{i}$ 's, that regulate the covariance between consumption growth and the growth of the share of consumption produced by asset $i$ , will play an important role in the formula for asset returns, and for this reason we elaborate on them further.  \n\nFirst, equation (6) shows that the constants $\\theta_{i}$ are not identified as we can add a constant to all of them without changing any of the covariances. For this reason we can renormalize them and we find it convenient to set $\\theta_{1}=0$ . Second, since the fraction of consumption generated by wages $s_{t}^{w}$ is by far the largest component of all $s_{t}^{i}$ 's, it is convenient to find a an expression for the covariance in (6) that makes explicit the dependence on $s_{t}^{w}$ . By substituting the identity $\\begin{array}{r}{s_{t}^{i}=1-\\sum_{j\\neq i}s_{t}^{j}}\\end{array}$ in equation (6) and rearranging terms we immediately find that  \n\n$$\nc o v_{t}\\left(\\frac{d s_{t}^{i}}{s_{t}^{i}},\\frac{d C_{t}}{C_{t}}\\right)=s_{t}^{w}\\theta_{i}+\\sum_{j\\neq1,i}s_{t}^{j}\\left(\\theta_{i}-\\theta_{j}\\right)\n$$  \n\nWe use equations (6) and (7) repeatedly throughout.  \n\n### II. RESULTS  \n\nIn this section we describe the asset pricing implications of the model introduced in the previous section. We derive first the equilibrium price dividend ratios for both individual assets and the market portfolio. Then we explore the implications for the market asset returns and the cross section of stock returns.  \n\n#### III.A Equilibrium prices  \n\nIn our set up, as in others, labor income is a tradable asset $^6$ and we abstract from any effect that market incompleteness may have on asset prices. For this reason the standard asset pricing formula applies:  \n\n$$\nP_{t}^{i}=E_{t}\\left[\\int_{t}^{\\infty}\\frac{U_{c}\\left(\\tau,C_{\\tau}\\right)}{U_{c}\\left(t,C_{t}\\right)}D_{\\tau}^{i}d\\tau\\right].\n$$  \n\nGiven our assumptions on preferences and dividends, $U_{c}\\left(\\tau,C_{\\tau}\\right)=e^{-\\phi\\tau}C_{\\tau}^{-1}$ and $D_{\\tau}^{i}=s_{\\tau}^{i}C_{\\tau}$ equilibrium prices are:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{P_{t}^{i}}}&{{=}}&{{E_{t}\\displaystyle\\left[\\displaystyle\\int_{t}^{\\infty}e^{-\\phi(\\tau-t)}\\displaystyle\\frac{C_{t}}{C_{\\tau}}s_{\\tau}^{i}C_{\\tau}d\\tau\\right]}}\\ {{}}&{{=}}&{{C_{t}\\displaystyle\\int_{t}^{\\infty}e^{-\\phi(\\tau-t)}E_{t}\\left[s_{\\tau}^{i}\\right]d\\tau}}\\ {{}}&{{=}}&{{C_{t}\\displaystyle\\left\\{\\displaystyle\\frac{a\\overline{{{s}}}^{i}}{\\phi\\left(a+\\phi\\right)}+\\displaystyle\\frac{s_{t}^{i}}{a+\\phi}\\right\\},}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $7$ we used equation (5). The expression for the price dividend ratio of asset $i$ now follows trivially from equation (11):  \n\n$$\n\\frac{P_{t}^{i}}{D_{t}^{i}}=\\left(\\frac{1}{\\phi}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{\\phi+a}\\right)\\left[\\phi+a\\left(\\frac{\\overline{{s}}^{i}}{s_{t}^{i}}\\right)\\right].\n$$  \n\nThat is, the price-dividend ratio of asset $i$ depends on the share of consumption that the representative consumer derives from asset $i$ . In addition, the price dividend ratio of security $i$ depends on the “distance” of its current level $s_{t}^{i}$ from its long-run average ${\\overline{{s}}}^{i}$  \n\nEquation (12) extends naturally to the price dividend ratio of the market portfolio. Define $\\begin{array}{r}{P_{t}^{M}=\\sum_{i=2}^{n}P_{t}^{i}}\\end{array}$ and $\\begin{array}{r}{D_{t}^{M}=\\sum_{i=2}^{n}D_{t}^{i}}\\end{array}$ . Then it is straightforward to show that:  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{P_{t}^{M}}{D_{t}^{M}}}=\\left({\\frac{1}{\\phi}}\\right)\\left({\\frac{1}{\\phi+a}}\\right)\\left[\\phi+a\\left({\\frac{1-{\\overline{{s}}}^{w}}{1-s_{t}^{w}}}\\right)\\right]=\\left({\\frac{1}{\\phi}}\\right)\\psi(s_{t}^{w})\n$$  \n\nEquation (13) has a strong intuitive appeal. The frst term of the expression, $\\frac{1}{\\phi}$ ,is the standard price dividend ratio in one endowment economy with log utility function. The secondterm, $\\psi(s_{t}^{w})$ , corrects for the presence of an alternative source of income other than dividends from the market portfolio.  \n\nNotice that $\\psi(s_{t}^{w})=1$ only if $\\overline{{s}}^{w}=s_{t}^{w}$ . That is an economy in its steady state yields a price dividend ratio that is no different than the usual one. Deviations form this steady state generate movements in the price dividend ratio of the market portfolio. For instance, if $\\overline{{s}}^{w}<s_{t}^{w}$ then the price dividend ratio is higher than it's long run level, $\\frac{1}{\\phi}$ . There are two reasons for this. First, if $s_{t}^{w}$ is relatively high investors are less exposed to fuctuations in the stock market, and hence they require a lower compensation to hold it, and this, in turn, translates into higher prices. Also, a high share of labor income to consumption signals that future aggregate dividend growth is going to be above that of consumption as $s_{t}^{w}$ will mean revertto $\\overline{{s}}^{w}$ . This further reinforces the positive effect on the price dividend ratio.  \n\nEquation (13) then captures an alternative source of variation in the price dividend ratio to the ones that have been emphasized in the literature.8 As the share of labor income to consumption ratio varies the price dividend ratio will vary unambiguously. In the next section we explore whether the intuition carries to the aggregate market returns.  \n\n#### III.B Market returns  \n\nThe excess stock returns of the market portfolio, $d R_{t}^{M}$ , is defined as:  \n\n$$\nd R_{t}^{M}=\\frac{d P_{t}^{M}+D_{t}^{M}d t}{P_{t}^{M}}-r_{t},\n$$  \n\nwhere the risk free rate can be easily proved to be equal to:9  \n\n$$\nr_{t}=\\phi+\\mu_{c}-\\sigma_{c}\\sigma_{c}^{\\prime}.\n$$  \n\nIn appendix we show that a straightforward application of Ito's lemma together with the fact that $E_{t}\\left[d R_{t}^{M}\\right]=c o v_{t}\\left(d R_{t}^{M},\\frac{d C_{t}}{C_{t}}\\right)$ yields the following expression for the expeted excess return of the market portfolio:  \n\n$$\nE_{t}\\left[d R_{t}^{M}\\right]=\\sigma_{c}\\sigma_{c}^{\\prime}+\\frac{1}{1+\\left(\\frac{a}{\\phi}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1-\\overline{{s}}^{w}}{1-s_{t}^{w}}\\right)}\\left(\\frac{s_{t}^{w}}{1-s_{t}^{w}}\\right)\\sum_{j=2}^{n}s_{t}^{j}\\theta_{j}.\n$$  \n\nIn the standard “one tree” economy the conditional expected excess return of the market portfolio is simply $\\sigma_{c}\\sigma_{c}^{\\prime}$ . Whether the level of the conditional expected excess return is above or below this benchmark depends on the covariance between wage income share growth and consumption growth, which, from equation (6), equals $\\textstyle-\\sum_{j=1}^{n}s_{t}^{j}\\theta_{j}$ (recall that $\\theta_{1}=0$ ) If this covariance is negative, then the premium is higher than in the standard case as the market tends to pay in the presence of consumption growth. If on the other hand the covariance is positive the expected excess return is lower than $\\sigma_{c}\\sigma_{c}^{\\prime}$ as the market provides a natural hedge against weak consumption growth.  \n\nAs equation (14) shows, there are two sources of variation in expected excess returns: changes on the distribution of dividends across the market portfolio and fuctuations in $s_{t}^{w}$ What is the economic intuition behind each source of variation?  \n\nTo gain some insights on the impact of cross sectional variation in the distribution of dividends across the market, $\\textstyle\\sum_{j=2}^{n}s_{t}^{j}\\theta_{j}$ , assume that the share of labor income to consumption, $s_{t}^{w}$ , stays constant and that we “redistribute\" an amount $\\delta$ away from share $s_{t}^{i}$ to share $s_{t}^{j}$ . Then the change in conditional expected excess return is given by:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l c l}{{E_{t}\\left[d R_{t}^{M}\\right]}}&{{=}}&{{\\delta\\left(\\frac{s_{t}^{w}}{\\left(1-s_{t}^{w}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{a}{\\phi}\\right)\\left(1-\\overline{{{s}}}^{w}\\right)}\\right)\\left[\\theta_{j}-\\theta_{i}\\right]}}\\ {{}}&{{=}}&{{\\delta\\left(\\frac{s_{t}^{w}}{\\left(1-s_{t}^{w}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{a}{\\phi}\\right)\\left(1-\\overline{{{s}}}^{w}\\right)}\\right)\\left[c o v_{t}\\left(\\frac{d s_{t}^{j}}{s_{t}^{j}},\\frac{d C_{t}}{C_{t}}\\right)-c o v_{t}\\left(\\frac{d s_{t}^{i}}{s_{t}^{i}},\\frac{d C_{t}}{C_{t}}\\right)\\right]}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere the last equality follows from equation (6). The expected rate of return of the market portfolio will rise if the covariance of asset $j$ is higher than that of asset $i$ . This is only natural, as dividends are redistributed towards the asset whose share growth covaries more strongly with consumption growth and hence the overall market is more strongly correlated with consumption growth.  \n\nVariations in the share of labor income to consumption is the second source of fuctuations in expected market returns. Unlike before though, it is not possible now to hold distributional effects fixed, as changes in $s_{t}^{w}$ necessarily result in changes in $\\textstyle\\sum_{j=2}^{n}s_{t}^{j}\\theta_{j}$ .An example then could be helpful here.  \n\nAssume that $\\theta_{j}=\\theta$ for all $j=2,3,\\hdots,n$ , that is, that the share growth rates have the same covariance with consumption growth. In this case, $\\begin{array}{r}{\\sum_{j=2}^{n}s_{t}^{j}\\theta_{j}=\\theta\\left(1-s_{t}^{w}\\right)=}\\end{array}$ $\\begin{array}{r}{-c o v_{t}\\left(\\frac{d s_{t}^{w}}{s_{t}^{w}},\\frac{d C_{t}}{C_{t}}\\right)}\\end{array}$  \n\n$$\nE_{t}\\left[d R_{t}^{M}\\right]=\\sigma_{c}\\sigma_{c}^{\\prime}+\\frac{\\theta s_{t}^{w}\\left(1-s_{t}^{w}\\right)}{\\phi\\left(1-s_{t}^{w}\\right)+a\\left(1-\\overline{{s}}^{w}\\right)}\n$$  \n\nEquation (15) shows that the instantaneous expected return depends non-linearly on the fraction of consumption produced by labor income $s_{t}^{w}=w_{t}/C_{t}$ . Its functional form shows that expected returns are equal to $\\sigma_{c}\\sigma_{c}^{\\prime}$ both when $s_{t}^{w}=0$ and when $s_{t}^{w}=1$ . To understand this result, notice that when $s_{t}^{w}=0$ , then $\\begin{array}{r}{C_{t}=\\sum_{j=2}^{n}D_{t}^{j}=D_{t}^{M}}\\end{array}$ and hence we are in the usual Lucas (1978) economy with no other endowment than the risky assets. The results that in the log utility case ${\\cal E}_{t}\\left\\vert d{\\cal R}_{t}^{M}\\right\\vert=\\sigma_{c}\\sigma_{c}^{\\prime}$ is indeed standard. More puzzling at first is that this model implies that $E_{t}\\left\\lfloor d R_{t}^{M}\\right\\rfloor\\:=\\:\\sigma_{c}\\sigma_{c}^{\\prime}$ when $s_{t}^{w}=1$ . In this case we must have s\\* = 0 for all = ..,n which from (11) entails PM = Cta+) . Since we would also have $C_{t}=w_{t}$ , we obtain that the price is perfectly correlated with wages (and hence consumption), yielding the result. Of course, both these limit cases are extreme, given that, as shown in Figure $1$ ， $s_{t}^{w}$ lies comfortably in the interval (0.75, 0.9). In this case, what is the relationship between $E_{t}\\left\\lfloor d R_{t}^{M}\\right\\rfloor$ and $s_{t}^{w}$ ? In the simplified example of equation (15) where $\\theta_{j}=\\theta$ for all $j=2,3,\\dots,n$ , we can see that the denominator of the second term is always positive, hence the behavior of expected stock returns depend on the sign of $\\theta$ . To gain intuition on the likely sign of this term, recall again that $s_{t}^{w}\\left(1-s_{t}^{w}\\right)\\theta=-c o v\\left(d s_{t}^{w},d C_{t}/C_{t}\\right)$ . If wages are much smoother than dividends, we can imagine that an increase in dividends is accompanied by an increase in consumption and hence a decrease in $s_{t}^{w}=w_{t}/C_{t}$ (if wages do not move much). This induces a natural negative covariance between consumption growth and the changes in $s_{t}^{w}$ . Indeed, evidence (not reported) shows a negative covariance between $d s_{t}^{w}$ and $d C_{t}/C_{t}$ Since $s_{t}^{w}\\left(1-s_{t}^{w}\\right)$ is positive, this implies $\\theta>0$ . This in turn yields a negative relationship between expected returns and the labor share $s_{t}^{w}$ when $s_{t}^{w}$ is in the relevant range (0.75, 0.9). The economic intuition of this result is clear: as $s_{t}^{w}$ increases, consumption becomes fueled by labor income only, decreasing the covariance between consumption growth and dividend growth. This in turn translates into a lower covariance between consumption growth and returns, generating a lower risk premium.  \n\n#### III.C The cross section of stock returns  \n\nSimilar arguments to the ones used in the previous section yield a closed form solution to the conditional expected rate of return of asset $i$ . Let $P_{t}^{\\prime I^{\\prime}W}=P_{t}^{M}+P_{t}^{w}$ the value of the total wealth portfolio, that is, the portfolio that comprises the value of the market portfolio $P_{t}^{M}$ and the value to human capital $P_{t}^{w}$ . Notice that the latter can be computed from equation (11) for $i=1$ . If we denote by $d R_{t}^{T W}$ the excess return from the total wealth portfolio, standard equilibrium conditions require $E_{t}\\left[d R_{t}^{i}\\right]=c o v_{t}\\left(d R_{t}^{i},d R_{t}^{T W}\\right)$ which in turns implies the “beta” representation  \n\n$$\nE_{t}\\left[d R_{t}^{i}\\right]=\\beta_{i}\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{t}\\right)E_{t}\\left[d R_{t}^{T W}\\right],\n$$  \n\nwhere the conditional beta $\\beta_{i}\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{t}\\right)=c o v_{t}\\left(d R_{t}^{i},d R_{t}^{T W}\\right)/v a r_{t}\\left(d R_{t}^{T W}\\right)$ can be written explicitly  \n\nas a function of $s_{t}^{w}$ and $s_{t}^{j}$ 's as:  \n\n$$\n\\beta_{i}\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{t}\\right)=1+\\left(\\frac{\\theta_{i}}{\\sigma_{c}\\sigma_{c}^{\\prime}\\left(1+\\frac{a}{\\phi}\\left(\\frac{\\overline{{{s}}}_{i}^{i}}{s_{t}^{i}}\\right)\\right)}\\right)s_{t}^{w}+\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{c}\\sigma_{c}^{\\prime}\\left(1+\\frac{a}{\\phi}\\left(\\frac{\\overline{{{s}}}_{i}^{i}}{s_{t}^{i}}\\right)\\right)}\\right)\\sum_{j\\neq1,i}s_{t}^{j}\\left(\\theta_{i}-\\theta_{j}\\right)\n$$  \n\nThe conditional beta of each asset $i$ with respect to the total wealth portfolio depends on both the share of labor income to consumption $s_{t}^{w}$ and on the distribution of shares across the stock market $\\textstyle\\sum_{j\\neq1,i}s_{t}^{j}$ . The coeffcients on each of this common “factors\" depend on the relative position of $s_{t}^{i}$ with respect to its steady state value, ${\\overline{{s}}}^{i}$ ． For instance, in the case where $\\theta_{i}=\\theta$ for all $i=2,3,\\hdots,n$ ， $\\beta_{i}\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{t}\\right)$ varies as a function of just $s_{t}^{w}$ and $s_{t}^{\\i}$ (the second term in (17) vanishes). The reason for this is as follows: In this case we recall that $\\begin{array}{r}{c o v_{t}\\left(\\frac{d s_{t}^{i}}{s_{t}^{i}},\\frac{d C_{t}}{C_{t}}\\right)=\\theta s_{t}^{w}}\\end{array}$ . If $\\theta>0$ , conditional on $s_{t}^{i}$ , an increase in $s_{t}^{w}$ results in a higher conditional expected rate of return as a result of the increase of the covariance between consumption growth and share growth. The degree to which changes in $s_{t}^{w}$ affect the beta $\\beta_{i}\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{t}\\right)$ of asset $i$ depends also on the value of $s_{t}^{i}$ . If $s_{t}^{\\i}\\approx0$ changes in $s_{t}^{w}$ do not affect the required return, as asset $i$ does not contribute to consumption and does not covary with its growth.  \n\nGiven that the return on the total wealth portfolio is not directly observable, from (16) we obtain a formulation more suitable for the empirical analysis. Define first:  \n\n$$\n\\Phi(\\mathbf{s}_{t})=\\frac{P_{t}^{w}}{P_{t}^{w}+P_{t}^{M}},\n$$  \n\nwhere ${\\bf s}_{t}=\\left(s_{t}^{1},s_{t}^{2},\\ldots,s_{t}^{n}\\right)$ , and again $P_{t}^{w}$ is the price of the human capital asset. Then the return on the total wealth portfolio is given by:  \n\n$$\nd R_{t}^{T W}=\\Phi(\\mathbf{s}_{t})d R_{t}^{w}+\\left(1-\\Phi(\\mathbf{s}_{t})\\right)d R_{t}^{M},\n$$  \n\nwhere $d R_{t}^{w}$ is the rate of return on the human capital asset. Given that $E_{t}\\left[d R_{t}^{i}\\right]=c o v_{t}\\left(d R_{t}^{i},d R_{I}^{T W}\\right)$ we can use the definition of the return on the total wealth portfolio, equation (18), to obtain:  \n\n$$\nE_{t}\\left[d R_{t}^{i}\\right]=\\Phi(\\mathbf{s}_{t})c o v_{t}\\left(d R_{t}^{i},d R_{t}^{w}\\right)+\\left(1-\\Phi(\\mathbf{s}_{t})\\right)c o v_{t}\\left(d R_{t}^{i},d R_{t}^{M}\\right).\n$$  \n\nThen equation (19) implies that the conditional expected rates of return on both the human capital asset and the market are given by:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{[E_{t}[d R_{t}^{w}]\\quad E_{t}[d R_{t}^{w}]]^{\\prime}=\\Sigma^{w M}\\left[\\Phi(\\mathbf{s}_{t})\\quad(1-\\Phi(\\mathbf{s}_{t})\\right]^{\\prime},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\sum^{w M}$ as the variance-covariance matrix of $d R_{t}^{w}$ and $d R_{t}^{M}$ . From equation (20) we can get an expression for $\\begin{array}{r l}{[\\Phi(\\mathbf{s}_{t})}&{{}(1-\\Phi(\\mathbf{s}_{t})]^{\\prime}}\\end{array}$ that we can readily substitute back into (19) to obtain the beta representation:  \n\n$$\nE_{t}\\left[d R_{t}^{i}\\right]=\\beta_{i w}(\\mathbf{s}_{t})E_{t}\\left[d R_{t}^{w}\\right]+\\beta_{i M}(\\mathbf{s}_{t})E_{t}\\left[d R_{t}^{M}\\right],\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\beta_{i w}(\\mathbf{s}_{t})$ and $\\beta_{i M}({\\bf s}_{t})$ are the multiple regression coefficients:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{[\\beta_{i w}(\\mathbf{s}_{t})}&{\\beta_{i M}(\\mathbf{s}_{t})]^{\\prime}=\\left(\\Sigma^{w M}\\right)^{-1}\\times\\left[c o v_{t}\\left(d R_{t}^{i},d R_{t}^{w}\\right)\\right.\\quad c o v_{t}\\left(d R_{t}^{i},d R_{t}^{M}\\right)\\right].}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nVersions of equation (21) have been the focus of much research lately. For instance, Jagannathan and Wang (1996) test a version the above equation where they also extend the definition of the market portfolio to include returns in human capital and where their conditioning variable is the properly defined default premium, shown to forecast business cycles. More recently LLb have tested a similar equation in a different set of test portfolios where the conditioning variable is the consumption to wealth ratio, a conditioning variable that they show predicts future market returns.  \n\nOur version of the conditional CAPM has the advantage of unambiguously specifying the set of conditioning variables that could improve the performance of the conditional CAPM and CCAPM, namely, the shares of dividends and wages over consumption. We return below to the question of how to derive a specific test of our model.  \n\nWe can derive along very similar lines the conditional Consumption CAPM which is given b.y:  \n\n$$\nE_{t}\\left[d R_{t}^{i}\\right]=\\beta_{1i}^{c}\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{t}\\right)d t+\\beta_{2i}^{c}\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{t}\\right)E_{t}\\left[\\frac{d C_{t}}{C_{t}}\\right]\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\beta_{1i}^{c}\\left(\\mathbf{s}\\right)$ is a function of $\\mathbf{s}_{t}$ and $\\beta_{2i}^{c}\\left(\\mathbf{s}\\right)$ is the regression coefficient of $d R_{t}^{\\i}$ onto $d C_{t}/C_{t}$ As before we delay the specific test on this model to the empirical section.  \n\nWhat is the intuition behind these results? Recall that we have established earlier that movements in the share of labor income to consumption together with variation in the distribution of shares across the market result in variations in the conditional expected rate of return on the market portfolio. These changes are likely to affect alternative portfolios differently as they will display varying sensitivities to the share of labor income to consumption for example. This is what provides a role for this variable in tests of the cross section of stock returns.  \n\n### IV. EMPIRICAL TESTS  \n\nIn this section we test the main predictions of our model. We start by providing a brief description of the data set employed. We then test the implications for the time series behavior of the aggregate market portfolio. Last we explore whether our version of the conditional CAPM and CCAMP provides a better description of the cross section of stock returns.  \n\nWe emphasize that in what follows we concentrate in the role of the share of labor income to consumption, $s_{t}^{w}$ , as a predictive and conditioning variable and leave the effects of the cross sectional distribution of dividend shares for future research. There are two main reasons for this. We are interested in the role of labor income, a variable that has proved to play a considerable role in recent asset pricing tests (Jagannathan and Wang (1996), LLa and LLb,) and that seems a clear first order effect given the large percentage of consumption it funds. Another reason is our emphasis in bringing in conditioning information that is “purely” non financial as it provides a sharper view on the links between macroeconomics and financial markets.  \n\n#### IV.A Data description  \n\nThe financial data we use is standard. We consider returns on the value weighted CRSP index, which includes NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ, as our measure of financial asset returns. Dividend price ratios are also obtained from CRSP and the risk free rate is the 90-day Treasury bill.  \n\nFor both consumption and labor income we use data from the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA). Following the literature (see LLa), we define consumption as nondurable plus services excluding shoes and clothing. The argument behind this idea is that the theory applies to the fow of consumption and it should not include additions or replacements to the stock of durable goods. As it is also traditional we assume that total consumption is proportional to consumption of non durables plus services and we choose a constant of proportionality to be the long term ratio between total consumption and consumption of non durables plus services. This ratio is estimated to be 1.15.  \n\nThe labor income series is as in LLa. It is constructed by adding to wages and salaries, transfer payments plus other labor income and subtracting personal contributions to social insurance and taxes.1o Both the consumption and labor income series are quarterly.  \n\nFor the cross sectional tests we use the sets of test portfolios constructed by Fama and French (1993). These portfolios are formed by intersecting 5 portfolios sorted by size with other five portfolios sorted by book-to-market. We convert the returns to quarterly data producing a time series covering 1946 to 1998.  \n\n#### IV.B Predictability of aggregate returns  \n\n#### IV.B.1 Forecasting regressions  \n\nWe test first the forecasting power of the ratio of labor income to consumption. Recall that the main prediction of our model postulates that the high share of labor income to consumption, $s_{t}^{w}$ , predicts low future returns. For this reason we run regressions of returns on lagged values of $s_{t}^{w}$ . We also rerun the standard predictability regression to check its performance during our sample period and frequency. Finally we run two additional regressions that try to asses whether the role of the share of labor income to consumption in the predictability regression is robust to the inclusion of the price dividend ratio. That is we estimate:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{r_{t,t+K}}&{=}&{\\alpha_{1}+\\beta_{1}(K)s_{t}^{w}+\\varepsilon_{t+k}}\\ {r_{t,t+K}}&{=}&{\\alpha_{2}+\\beta_{2}(K)\\log\\displaystyle\\left(\\frac{D_{t}^{M}}{P_{t}^{M}}\\right)+\\varepsilon_{t+k}}\\ {r_{t,t+K}}&{=}&{\\alpha_{3}+\\beta_{3}(K)\\log\\displaystyle\\left(\\frac{D_{t}^{M}}{P_{t}^{M}}\\right)+\\beta_{4}(K)s_{t}^{w}+\\varepsilon_{t+k}}\\ {r_{t,t+K}}&{=}&{\\alpha_{5}+\\beta_{5}(K)\\left(s_{t}^{w}\\times\\log\\displaystyle\\left(\\frac{D_{t}^{M}}{P_{t}^{M}}\\right)\\right)+\\varepsilon_{t+k}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $r_{t,t+K}$ is the cumulative log return over $K$ periods. For each regression, Tables II-IV report the point estimate of the included explanatory variable, the Newey-West corrected $t-$ statistic for the null hypothesis that the coefficients are zero, and the adjusted $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$  \n\nWe start discussing our results for the whole sample period at our disposal, 1946-1999. The first row of Table II-A shows that the ratio of labor income to consumption $s_{t}^{w}$ is statistically significant at any forecasting horizons between one quarter and four years. The sign of the regression coefficient is negative, giving support to the view expressed in the previous section that positive innovations in $s_{t}^{w}$ lead to low future returns. The explanatory power is also high, ranging from $6.1\\%$ for the one year regression to $34.6\\%$ for the four year  \n\nregression.  \n\nWe compare these results with those of the standard predictability regression, equation (24). In this case, the dividend price ratio is never significant at any horizons and the predictive power is rather low, ranging from 3.9% at the one year horizon to 20.7% at the four year horizon. As we will see below, this poor performance of the dividend-price ratio to forecast future returns is partly due to the inclusion of the period 1995-1999 in the data sample. Indeed, during this period the dividend price ratio was extremely low and yet returns have been record high.  \n\nRecall that, as shown in equation (13), the dividend price ratio is a non linear function of $s^{w}$ . Including the dividend price ratio then may proxy for any non linearities in the relation between returns and $s^{w}$ . When both ratios enter linearly (regression (25)) both regressors are significant and the predictive power ranges from an adjusted $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ of $16.2\\%$ at the one year horizon to an $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ of over $61\\%$ at the four year horizon. Interestingly, a similar result obtains when we only use the interaction factor $s^{w}\\times\\log\\left(D/P\\right)$ in the regression (regression (26)). In this case again the coefficient is highly significant and the $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ ranges from $13.4\\%$ at the one year horizon to over 50% at the four year horizon.  \n\nAs shown in Figure 1, the first two years of our sample, 1946-7, showed a remarkable drop in the ratio of labor income to consumption. The special circumstances of those years may account for that event. We reran the predictability regression excluding those eight initial data points and we report the results in Table II-B. The short term predictability of our variable improves slightly but overall the estimates are very similar.  \n\nextremely well in predicting future returns. Our results using quarterly data are comparable to the ones reported in Campbell et al. (1997) who instead used monthly data. For instance, for the one year and four year horizons they obtain $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ 's of 18.8% and 41.7% respectively, matching our results almost to the point. The use of quarterly data then does not seem to be producing any particular bias in the results.  \n\nAs can be seen in the first line of Table IHI, the ratio of labor income to consumption is now only a significant predictor at horizons of two years or more. The $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ is 3% for the one year regression but rises to $22.6\\%$ for the four year regression. Interestingly, however, when both the dividend price ratio and the wages-to-consumption ratio are included - either in linear fashion as in regression (25) or in a nonlinear one as in regression (26) - the performance of the predictability regression improves considerably, with $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ ranging between 25.1% for the one year regression to above 62.7% for the four year regression.  \n\nWe can compare the results in Table IHI with those in Table IV, where the same exercise is carried out for the sample period 1952:01-1999:04. We include these results to show the dramatic decrease in the predictive power of the dividend price ratio due to the impressive stock market surge of the 90's (see e.g. Cochrane (1997) for a similar point) and to show how the labor income-to-consumption ratio still works well. Indeed, we see that over this sample period the dividend price ratio is never significant at any horizon and the $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ of the predictive regressions does not go above 7% at any horizon. Instead, the wages-to-consumption ratio is performing quite well: The coefficients are statistically significant at all horizons and its predictive power ranges between $7.4\\%$ at the one year horizon to $35.4\\%$ at the four year horizon. As before, using both ratios greatly improves upon the predictability regression: using regression (25) for example we obtain $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ ranging from 19.6% at the one year to above 56% at the four year horizon.  \n\nHow does our model perform when confronted with the extraordinary stock market of the 90s? Figures 2 and 3 plot the time series of wages-to-consumption ratio, dividend price ratio and the four year cumulative stock return. As it can be seen in Figure 2, the dividendprice ratio and the cumulative four year return started moving in opposite directions at the end of the 80's. As already mentioned this is at the heart of the failure of the standard predictability regression (equation (24)) in our sample. However Figure 3 shows that the negative relation between the cumulative four year return and the ratio of labor income to consumption held well even in the last part of the sample. Still, our model cannot reconcile the very low dividend price ratios observed in the 90s with the high expected returns during the same period because low $s_{t}^{w}$ imply relatively high dividend price ratios rather than low ones.  \n\nThis is not unique to the model proposed in this paper. Barring bubbles, the low dividend price ratios and high expected returns observed in the 90s can only be rationalized with expectations of very high dividend growth or an impressive string of unexpected positive shocks to returns. Notice though that in the context of the model presented in section II there is still no room to simultaneously obtain low shares of labor income to consumption with low dividend price ratios. This though is an unfortunate feature of the log utility case and it can be proved that under more general preference specifications the dividend price ratio of the market portfolio depends on the entire distribution of dividend payments across the market.  \n\nThe negative relation between the share of labor income to consumption and future stock returns has received subsequent support in a recent research by Lettau and Ludvigson (2001c). They isolate the permanent and transitory shocks of the cointegrated vector formed by consumption, labor earnings, and financial wealth. There are two permanent shocks of which only the “first” affects consumption. The second one they term income neutral as it does not result in any significant impact on consumption but rather “causes labor income to increase and asset wealth to decrease.\" A positive income neutral shock then results in an increase in the ratio of labor income to consumption which is followed by low financial returns as postulated in this paper.13  \n\n#### IV.B.2 Spurious regressions tests  \n\nTable I reports standard unit root tests. As can be seen, most series used in this paper are close-to-unit root series and hence there is a justified concern that the results about the time-series predictability may be due to spurious regressions.14 In this section we tackle this problem by performing tests of spurious regressions as presented by Richardson and Stock (1989) and Torous and Yan (1999). We describe the procedure in detail in Appendix II, but, roughly, the test amounts to generate, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, the empirical distribution of the estimated regression coeffcient under the null hypothesis that the population coefficient is zero. Such a distribution is reported in Table IX and we compare the estimated coefficient in Tables II-IV to the cutoff points for the preferred confidence level.  \n\nFor the sample period 1946-1999 the estimated coefficients reported in Table II-A are extremely close to being statistically significant at the 10% level for the one quarter, one year, and two year regression. For example, the one quarter ahead predictive regression yields a coefficient $\\beta(1)=-308$ while from the simulations, the 90% confidence interval is $[-0.309,0.282]$ . For the three and four year regression both coefficients are statistically significant at the $10\\%$ level. For instance for the four year regression the estimated coefficient is given by $\\beta(16)=-4.902$ while the 90% confidence interval is [-4.441, 4.129].  \n\nIn contrast the dividend price ratio is never significant at the $10\\%$ . This is partly due to the fact that the correlation between returns and dividend price ratio, $\\rho$ , is much higher in this case (around $-$ .96) than in the case where the predictive variable is the labor income to consumption ratio (in which case $\\rho\\approx-.02$ ). As explained in the appendix, a higher correlation $\\rho$ makes the distribution of $\\beta\\left(K\\right)$ even more “non-normal\". For example, using the dividend price ratio for the one quarter and four year regression we obtain $\\beta\\left(1\\right)=.022$ and $\\beta\\left(K\\right)=.475$ respectively while robust confidence intervals are $\\left\\lfloor-0.0027,0.0598\\right\\rfloor$ and $\\left\\lfloor-0.048,0.7655\\right\\rfloor$ respectively.  \n\nLooking at the regression where both the share and the log dividend price ratio enter linearly the estimated coefficient on $s_{w}$ is significant at all horizons. For instance, for the one quarter predictability regression the estimated value of the coefficient is $\\beta(1)=-.467$ whereas the $90\\%$ confidence interval is given by $[-.424,.363]$ . Once again, the dividend price ratio is never significant at this level of statistical significance.  \n\nThe results are even stronger when the sample is restricted to the period 1948-1999 (see Table HI-B). The estimated coefficients for the univariate regression with $s_{w}$ are all significant at the 10% level with the exception of the one year ahead regression, which is, in any case, extremely close to the cut-off value. All of them are statistically significant in the regression where the dividend price ratio enters linearly.  \n\nOverall, this section confirms from a statistical point of view that the predictive regression results obtained in the previous subsection section are unlikely to be spurious, and it lends further credence to the hypothesis of an economic relation linking returns on the aggregate market portfolio and the share of labor income to consumption.  \n\n#### IV.C Cross sectional Regressions  \n\nIn this section we test the implications of the model for the cross-section of stock returns,  \n\nwhich was developed in section IHl.C. Recall that the model has predictions for both the conditional CAPM and the conditional Consumption CAPM. We derive first specific testable implications and then conduct the empirical analysis on two sets of tests portfolios.  \n\n#### IV.C.1 Cross-sectional Implications  \n\nThe starting point of our tests of the conditional CAPM is the beta representation given in expression (21). This conditional beta representation implies that both $\\beta_{i w}\\left({\\bf s}_{t}\\right)$ and $\\beta_{i M}\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{t}\\right)$ are (complicated) functions of all the state variables, namely $\\left(s_{1},..,s_{n}\\right)$ . We argue though that the share of labor income to consumption is the most important common component driving the variation in “betas\" and the conditional expected rates of return as it is, by far, the largest share. Furthermore, and as shown in equation (17), the beta of the total wealth portfolio is “almost” linear in $s_{t}^{w}$ .By analogy with this we approximate the $\\beta_{i w}(\\mathbf{s}_{t})$ and $\\beta_{i M}({\\bf s}_{t})$ in the two beta representation by:  \n\n$$\n\\beta_{i w}\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{t}\\right)\\approx\\beta_{i w1}+\\beta_{i w2}s_{t}^{w}\\quad\\mathrm{and}\\quad\\beta_{i M}\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{t}\\right)\\approx\\beta_{i M1}+\\beta_{i M2}s_{t}^{w}.\n$$  \n\nIn this case (21) becomes  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{E_{t}\\left[d R_{i}\\right]}&{=}&{\\beta_{i w1}E_{t}\\left[d R_{t}^{w}\\right]+\\beta_{i w2}E_{t}\\left[s_{t}^{w}d R_{t}^{w}\\right]}\\ &&{+\\beta_{i M1}E_{t}\\left[d R_{t}^{M}\\right]+\\beta_{i M1}E_{t}\\left[s_{t}^{w}d R_{t}^{M}\\right]}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nWe can condition down this expression to obtain  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{E\\left[d R_{t}^{i}\\right]}&{=}&{\\beta_{i w1}E\\left[d R_{t}^{w}\\right]+\\beta_{i w2}E\\left[s_{t}^{w}d R_{t}^{w}\\right]}\\ &{+}&{\\beta_{i M1}E\\left[d R_{t}^{M}\\right]+\\beta_{i M2}E\\left[s_{t}^{w}d R_{t}^{M}\\right],}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhich is the version of the conditional CAPM that we test below. Notice that the coefficients $\\beta_{i j k}$ for $j=w,M$ and $k=1,2$ are no longer regression coefficients as in a standard Conditional CAPM formulation. However, for the purpose of this paper we can test the predictions of our model by checking the improvement in the fit of the cross-sectional regression when we impose $\\beta_{i j2}\\neq0$ for $j=w,M$ . Indeed, by using a standard Fama-MacBeth (1972) procedure, the restricted case would imply a model with a “beta” that is independent of $s_{t}^{w}$ ， while the latter allows for a stochastic beta relationship.  \n\nSimilarly the starting expression for our tests of the conditional Consumption CAPM is (22) , and, as before if we assume, $\\beta_{i}^{c}\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{t}\\right)\\approx\\beta_{i1}^{c}+\\beta_{i2}^{c}s_{t}^{w}$ ,weobtain  \n\n$$\nE_{t}\\left[d R_{t}^{i}\\right]=\\beta_{i11}^{c}+\\beta_{i12}^{c}s_{t}^{w}+\\beta_{i21}^{c}E_{t}\\left[\\frac{d C_{t}}{C_{t}}\\right]+\\beta_{i22}^{c}E_{t}\\left[s_{t}^{w}\\frac{d C_{t}}{C_{t}}\\right]\n$$  \n\nBy taking the unconditional expectation in (28)  \n\n$$\nE\\left[d R_{t}^{i}\\right]=\\beta_{i11}^{c}+\\beta_{i12}^{c}E\\left[s_{t}^{w}\\right]+\\beta_{i21}^{c}E\\left[\\frac{d C_{t}}{C_{t}}\\right]+\\beta_{i22}^{c}E\\left[s_{t}^{w}\\frac{d C_{t}}{C_{t}}\\right]\n$$  \n\nand it is this last expression that we test in the empirical section.  \n\n#### IV.C.2 Empirical Results  \n\nIn this section we test equations (27) and (29) in the set of test portfolios introduced by Fama and French (1993). In what follows we compare different specifications by reporting $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ , both adjusted and unadjusted, in the different regressions, but the reader should bear in mind that we have only 25 (cross-sectional) observations, the Fama-French portfolios, and that, as a consequence this statistic should be interpreted with caution.  \n\n#### a. Tests of the CAPM  \n\nTests of equation (27) require an estimate of the return to human capital, which is not observable. We follow Jagannathan and Wang (1996) and LLa and proxy the return on human capital as the growth rate of wages $\\Delta\\log{(w_{t})}$ .15  \n\nTable V presents the main results of this section. There we test several empirical specifications that are consistent with the theoretical implications developed above. For every specification we report the estimate, the t-statisitic, and the Shanken (1992) corrected $t-$ statisitic (in brackets). The last column reports the $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ and, below it, the adjusted $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ (in brackets). Our discussion centers around the adjusted $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$  \n\nPanel A reports the results for our test of the conditional CAPM as given by expression (27). The first line shows the weak performance of the unconditional CAPM. The beta on the value weighted return is not statistically significant, enters with the wrong sign, and the $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ is a just $10\\%$ , that is, the unconditional CAPM only explains $10\\%$ of the cross section of stock returns. The second line shows that adding the excess return on labor income $R^{w}$ does not help much, given that the adjusted $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ drops to 6%. A better definition of the market portfolio does not seem to improve the dismal performance of the CAPM.  \n\nresult in severe multicollinearity problems. For this reason we include only the component of $s^{w}R^{M}$ that is orthogonal to $R^{M}$ . As shown in line 3, conditioning market returns by the variable $s^{w}$ dramatically improves the cross-sectional fit to an adjusted $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ of 43%. The coefficient is strongly significant and positive. This sign is not easily interpretable as, recall, this only refects the premium associated with the orthogonal component. As we shall see, the strong significance and explanatory power of the this term will be robust to different specifications and sample periods, lending credence to the mechanism emphasized in this paper. Surprisingly, the coeffcient on $R^{M}$ is now significant, but this is not stable across specifications. We share with many other studies $^{16}$ the negative sign in the market premium.  \n\nAdding labor income further improves the fit to an adjusted $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ of 47% though the coefficient is not significant and enters with the wrong sign (see line 4.) Line 5 drops $s^{w}R^{M}$ in order to purely measure the impact of labor income, and it's scaled counterpart, on the cross section of stock returns.17 The scaled factor is strongly significant and negative. As in the case of $s^{w}R^{M}$ , this result is fairly stable throughout. Interestingly, the fit is fairly high, and the adjusted $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ is $32\\%$ . Finally line 6 is the full specification as presented in equation (27). All coefficients are strongly significant, with the exception of the coefficient on $R^{w}$ , and the adjusted $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ achieves a robust 49%. The top two panels of Figure 4 offers a quick visual impression of the ability of the share of labor income to consumption to properly rearrange the set of tests portfolios.  \n\nIn summary, the introduction of the share of labor income to consumption as a scaling variable considerably improves the performance of the CAPM. As already mentioned, we emphasize that our conditioning variable is not a financial variable and it is free of the concerns voiced by Berk (1995). He expressed that because returns are mechanically related to prices, ratios that have prices either in the numerator or denominator are in turn automatically related to returns, independently of whether they proxy for economically meaningful forces or not.  \n\nTable V also includes $t-$ statistics using the correction in the computations of the standard errors proposed by Shanken (1992). This correction takes into account the fact that the betas are estimated rather than fixed.18 In particular Shanken (1992) showed that under the assumption that asset returns have a conditional joint distribution with constant covariance matrix, the Fama-MacBeth procedure overstates the precision of the estimated parameters. As LLb note, the size of the correction is much larger when using macroeconomic factors than when using purely financial variables. Indeed, notice that for the standard CAPM there is essentially no difference between the uncorrected and the corrected $t-$ statistic associated with $R^{M}$ , whereas there is a much stronger correction when the share of labor income to consumption enters into the different specifications.19  \n\nPanel B of Table V reports similar regression results for the case where also $s^{w}$ is entered in the cross-sectional regression as an independent factor. Although our test, as shown in equation (27), does not imply this regression, the results are nonetheless interesting to understand the effect of the labor-to-consumption ratio on the cross-section of stock returns. The first line in Panel B reports the CAPM regression where only $s^{w}$ is added as explanatory variable and we see that the adjusted $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ jumps to $45\\%$ (against 10% for the unconditional CAPM). Adding the scaled return on the market portfolio $s^{w}R^{M}$ increases the adjusted $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ to 52% while when also the scaled return to labor is included the adjusted $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ increases to $61\\%$  \n\n#### b. Robustness and comparison with related work  \n\nOur use of the sample period 1946-1998 is novel and the reader may have some concerns as to whether the results are robust to the more standard period 1963-1998, which was the one used originally by Fama and French (1993) and more recently by LLb. We show next that the results do indeed improve for this truncated sample.  \n\nTable VI reports the results for the sample period 1963-1998. First notice that the adjusted $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ for the standard CAPM has collapsed to a dismal $-2\\%$ as compared to 10% in the full sample. The very poor performance of the unconditional CAPM in this sample period and tests portfolios is indeed consistent with previous findings.20  \n\nAs in the previous sample, the addition of the scaled market portfolio results in a remarkable improvement in the ability of the CAPM to explain the cross section. The coefficient is strongly significant and the adjusted $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ is $46\\%$ .Again the role of $s^{w}R^{M}$ is robust throughout the various specifications. Adding labor income further improves the fit to 55% and the coefficient is now significant. Finally line 6 reports the full specification, which reports a slight improvement of the cross sectional fit over the sample period 1946-1998 (from 49% t0 $55\\%$ .) As before panel B shows the results where the variable $s^{w}$ is included independently and again the results are very similar. Once gain, panels C and D of Figure 4 plot the unconditional and conditional performance of the CAPM in the 1963-1998 sample period.  \n\nA puzzling result of Table VI is that adding labor income growth as a proxy for the returns on human capital does not result in any improvement on the ability of the CAPM to explain the cross section of stock returns (see line 2.) This is all the more surprising in light of recent findings by LLb in the same set of test portfolios. These authors report an adjusted $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ of 54% when they include labor income growth to improve on the definition of the market portfolio.2l What is the reason behind this difference? The answer lies in the dating convention used in the construction of the labor income series.  \n\nJagannathan and Wang (1996) use a dating convention that involves lagging the labor income series one month to account for the one month delay in the release of the data by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The argument is that investors need information about the price of the human capital asset in order to form their optimal portfolios and that it is not reasonable to assume that they posses such information prior to it's release. LLb appeal to this argument to also use a lagged labor income series.  \n\nUnlike Jagannathan and Wang (1996), who use a monthly data set, we only have quarterly data. We lag the labor income by one quarter in order to provide agents with an information set comparable to that used by Jagannathan and Wang (1996). This time series has a correlation coefficient of .88 with the one used in LLb for their cross sectional study.22  \n\nTable VII contains the results where the labor income series has been lagged. In order to ease the comparison with LLb we report the results for the sample period 1963-1998. Clearly the only lines that are different with respect to Table VI are those that involve $R^{w}$ .Notice that indeed now the return on human capital is a significant variable that greatly improves the performance of the CAPM. The adjusted $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ goesfrom $-2\\%$ in the case of the standard unconditional CAPM to 17% (see lines 1 and 2.) Furthermore, and as also found by LLb and Jagannathan and Wang (1996), it enters with the right sign. A quick impression of this improvement can be obtained from panel C of Figure 5.23  \n\nInterestingly the main difference with respect to Table VI is that now scaling $R^{w}$ With the share of labor income to consumption improves the performance of the CAPM to an adjusted $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ of 54% as opposed to the 27% found with the unlagged labor income series (see line 5 in both Tables VI and VII1.) Finally the full specification (line 6) is very similar to the previous one and the adjusted $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ is 57% (see panels B and D of Figure 5.)  \n\nIn summary, the role of $s^{w}$ is then robust to different sample periods and alternative assumptions about the investors’ information set. Furthermore most of the improvement comes from scaling returns, $R^{M}$ and $R^{w}$ , by the share of labor income to consumption, as prescribed by our model, a variable that is not automatically related to returns by construction.24 Importantly it also has a significant explanatory power when it enters independently.  \n\n#### c. Tests of the CCAPM  \n\nTable VIII reports tests for the unconditional and conditional CCAPM as given by expression (29). As can be seen from panel A results for the period 1946-1998 are disappointing. The share of labor income to consumption does not seem to play any role in improving the appalling performance of the CCAPM. Only in the full specification is the share of labor income to consumption significant but the adjusted $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ is just 2% (see panels A and B of Figure 6.)  \n\nThe picture improves substantially in the sample period 1963-1998 (see panels C and D of Figure 6.) The inclusion of $s^{w}$ results in significant coefficient and an adjusted $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ of $15\\%$ Scaling consumption growth does not seem to add any explanatory power to the CCAPM by itself. In contrast the full specification shown both $s^{w}$ and $s^{w}{\\Delta c}$ as significant regressors and the adjusted $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ improves to a more respectable 30%.25  \n\n### V. FURTHER TESTS AND CONCLUDING REMARKS  \n\nWe propose a simple general equilibrium model to show that changes in expected returns may be generated by changes in the relative importance of various sources of income. In our model, total income is funded by dividends and labor income that grow stochastically over time. We show that equilibrium expected returns change as the fraction of total income funded by labor income fuctuates over time, because the latter affects the conditional covariance between equilibrium returns and consumption growth. We then obtain a new and simple testable implication, namely, that the ratio of labor income to consumption should help predicts stock returns. This is strongly confirmed in the data. The regression of stock returns on lagged values of this ratio produces statistically significant coefficients and adjusted $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ that are larger than those generated when using the dividend price ratio as a single explanatory variable. Notice that differently from the dividend price ratio, our variable is a pure macroeconomic variable that is constructed with no reference to financial variables and it is in this sense that we provide a powerful test of our theory.  \n\nWe derive and test a version of the conditional CAPM and the conditional consumption CAPM, where the variable we use to condition is the aforementioned ratio. Tests are conducted on the 25 Fama-French portfolios. We find that when we use our labor-income to consumption ratio as conditioning variable, the CAPM does a substantially better job in capturing cross sectional variation in returns. The result is robust to alternative sample periods and dating conventions regarding the returns on the human capital asset. Results for the Consumption CAPM are more disappointing.  \n\nIn addition to the robustness tests performed above, a previous version of the paper contained others that further confrmed the share of labor income to consumption as an economically meaningful variable.  \n\nFirst we checked the robustness of our results to alternative specifications of the variable $s^{w}$ . For instance the model proposed in this paper implies that total consumption equals total income in equilibrium. As a consequence, the same relationships that hold for the labor income to consumption ratio should also hold for the labor income to total income ratio. $^{26}$  \n\nThese regressions showed that the ratio of labor income to disposable income ratio has a very good predictive power for future returns in all subsamples, although the results were not so strong for the one quarter ahead predictive regression.  \n\nWe also performed a direct test of our theory. Essentially the economic model that motivated our empirical investigation entails that the covariance between returns and consumption growth moves over time due to the change in the ratio between labor income and total consumption. In order to test whether the ratio between labor income and consumption predicts the level of covariance between returns and real consumption growth, we first obtained an estimated time series of the latter by fitting a bi-variate GARCH(1,1) model to data from 1946-1999. We then ran a regression of the estimated covariance versus past covariances and the share of labor income to consumption. Again the share of labor income to consumption obtained as a significant predictor of changes in the covariance between returns and consumption growth.27  \n\nWe also tested the cross sectional implications of our model the alternative set of test portfolios used by Jagannathan and Wang (1996), which were portfolios sorted by size and beta.28 In the full specification of our model the adjusted $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ was 18% and rose to 55% when the share of labor income to consumption was independently included. Furthermore tests of the CCAPM in this set of tests portfolios resulted in adjusted $\\mathrm{R^{2}}$ as high as 38%. These results were also robust to alternative dating conventions concerning human capital returns.  \n\nIn conclusion, we find a substantial support for the economic model proposed in this paper, that is, that the time variation in the relative importance of the various sources of income has an important effect on the required expected return. Furthermore, our model is also fully consistent with a recent body of of evidence uncovered by Martin Lettau and Sydney Ludvigson documenting that cyclical variation in the consumption to wealth ratio affect future expected returns. Although our model is presented in the log-utility case for simplicity, which implies a constant consumption to wealth ratio, the same results of this paper can be obtained with higher degrees of risk aversions, as shown in the appendix. In this case, one can show that the consumption to wealth ratio is a non-linear but decreasing function of the labor income to consumption ratio. Hence, this model predicts that the consumption to wealth ratio should also be a predictor of future returns, a finding that is well documented in LLa.  \n\n## References  \n\nBarberis, Nick, Ming Huang and Tano Santos (2001), “Prospect Theory and Asset Prices,” Quarterly Journal of Economics, February.

Proofs and extensions  \n\nIn this appendix we generalize some of the results obtained in the body of the paper. We start with a more general model for the vector process for shares $\\mathbf{s}_{t}=\\left(s_{t}^{1},...,s_{t}^{n}\\right)$ .Let $\\mathbf{s}_{t}$ be a $1\\times n$ vector evolving according to the stochastic differential equations  \n\n$$\nd s_{t}^{i}=\\left[\\mathbf{s}_{t}\\pmb{\\Lambda}\\right]_{i}d t+s_{t}^{i}\\sigma_{i}\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{t}\\right)d\\mathbf{B}_{t}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathbf{s}_{0}~=~{\\widehat{\\mathbf{s}}}$ with $\\textstyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\widehat{s}}^{i}=1$ ， $\\pmb{\\Lambda}$ is a matrix with the property that $\\lambda_{i j}~\\geq~0$ for all $i j$ and $\\begin{array}{r}{\\lambda_{i i}=-\\sum_{j\\neq i}\\lambda_{i j}}\\end{array}$ and finally  \n\n$$\n\\sigma_{i}\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{t}\\right)=\\left(\\nu_{i}-\\sum_{j=1}^{n}s_{t}^{j}\\nu_{j}\\right)\n$$  \n\nand where $\\nu_{i}$ and $1\\times n$ vectors. In other words, (30) is the continuous time analog of a standard multivariate autoregressive process for the fractions $s_{i}$ , with some restrictions on $\\pmb{\\Lambda}$ and $\\sigma_{i}\\left(s\\right)$ to make sure that $\\begin{array}{r}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}s_{i}\\left(t\\right)=1}\\end{array}$ for all $t$ . Notice that by choosing the parametrization of the matrix $\\pmb{\\Lambda}$ as $\\lambda_{i j}=a\\overline{{s}}^{i}$ for $i\\neq j$ , where $\\textstyle\\sum_{j=1}^{n}{\\overline{{s}}}^{j}=1$ (which implies $\\lambda_{i i}=a\\overline{{s}}_{i}-a$ ) yields the case studied in the body of the paper, namely  \n\n$$\nd s_{i}=a\\left({\\overline{{s}}_{i}}-s_{i}\\right)d t+s_{i}\\sigma_{i}\\left({\\bf s}_{t}\\right)d{\\bf B}_{t}\n$$  \n\nWe next assume that  \n\n$$\nU\\left(C,t\\right)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{e^{-\\phi t}\\frac{C^{1-\\gamma}}{1-\\gamma}}&{\\mathrm{for}\\gamma\\ne1}\\ {e^{-\\phi t}\\log\\left(C\\right)}&{\\mathrm{for}\\gamma=1}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nWe now prove the following:  \n\nProposition A1 Let either of the following assumptions hold.  \n\nI.

However, in both cases (a) and (b) we find that it actually becomes linear:In case (a)we have $\\beta=0$ (which also implies that $X_{t}^{i}=s_{t}^{i}$ )while in case (b)we assumed  \n\n$\\textstyle\\mu_{c}=\\overline{{\\mu}}_{c}+\\sum_{j=1}^{n}s_{j}\\theta_{j}$ , which cancels with the non-linear part of the drift. In either case (by setting $\\beta=0$ in case (a), we then obtain  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l l l}{{d X_{t}^{i}}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\left\\{\\beta X_{t}^{i}\\overline{{{\\mu}}}_{c}+\\frac{1}{2}\\beta\\left(\\beta-1\\right)X_{t}^{i}\\sigma_{c}^{2}+\\left[{\\bf X}_{t}{\\bf A}\\right]_{i}+\\beta X_{t}^{i}\\theta_{i}\\right\\}{d t}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{\\displaystyle+X_{t}^{i}\\left\\{\\beta\\sigma_{c}+\\sigma_{i}({\\bf s}_{t})\\right\\}{d{\\bf B}}_{t}}}\\ {{}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\left[{\\bf X}_{t}\\left({\\bf A}+\\phi{\\bf I}-\\widehat{\\Theta}\\right)\\right]_{i}{d t}+X_{t}^{i}\\left\\{\\beta\\sigma_{c}+\\sigma_{i}({\\bf s}_{t})\\right\\}{d{\\bf B}}_{t}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nDefining $\\overline{{\\pmb{\\Lambda}}}=\\left(\\pmb{\\Lambda}+\\phi\\mathbf{I}-\\widehat{\\Theta}\\right)$ and $\\widehat{\\sigma}_{i}(\\mathbf{s}_{t})=\\beta\\sigma_{c}+\\sigma_{i}(s)$ we can rewrite  \n\n$$\nd X_{t}^{i}=\\left[\\mathbf{X}_{t}\\overline{{\\mathbf{\\Lambda}}}\\right]_{i}d t+X_{t}^{i}\\widehat{\\sigma}_{i}(\\mathbf{s}_{t})d\\mathbf{B}_{t}\n$$  \n\nUsing the vector notation, with $\\mathbf{X}=\\left(X^{1},...,X^{n}\\right)$ as a $1\\times n$ vector, we can rewrite this in its integral form as  \n\n$$\n{\\bf X}_{u}={\\bf X}_{t}+\\int_{t}^{u}{\\bf X}_{\\tau}\\overline{{{\\bf X}}}d\\tau+\\int_{t}^{u}X_{\\tau}\\widehat{{\\bfSigma}}({\\bf s}_{\\tau})d{\\bf B}_{\\tau}\n$$  \n\nNotice that also that for all $\\imath$ ， $X_{t}^{i}<C_{t}^{i}$ . Hence, all the integral below exist as long as the expected present value of future consumption can be computed, which in turn is ensured by choosing $\\phi$ sufficiently large. Let $\\widetilde{{\\mathbf{X}}}_{u}=E_{t}\\left({\\mathbf{X}}_{u}\\right)$ .Since $\\widehat{\\Sigma}(s)$ is bounded,  \n\n$$\nE_{t}\\left[\\int_{t}^{u}{\\bf X}_{\\tau}{\\widehat{\\bf\\Sigma}}({\\bf s}_{\\tau})d{\\bf B}_{u}\\right]=0\n$$  \n\nHence, taking expectations on both sides of (40) with respect to time $t$ weobtain  \n\n$$\n\\widetilde{{\\mathbf X}}_{u}={\\mathbf X}_{t}+\\int_{t}^{u}\\widetilde{{\\mathbf X}}_{\\tau}\\overline{{{\\mathbf\\Lambda}}}d\\tau\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\widetilde{\\bf X}}{d\\tau}=\\widetilde{\\bf X}\\overline{{{\\Lambda}}}\n$$  \n\nThis is a linear system of differential equations with initial condition $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{X}}_{0}=\\mathbf{X}_{t}$ .If $\\overline{{\\Lambda}}^{\\prime}$ admits real and distinct eigenvalues, its general solution is then given by  \n\n$$\n{\\widetilde{X}}_{u}^{i}=\\sum_{j=1}^{n}k_{j}w_{i j}e^{\\omega_{j}(u-t)}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\omega_{j}$ are the eigenvalues of $\\Lambda^{\\prime}$ and $w_{i j}$ are associated eigenvectors.

Let $\\Omega$ the diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues $\\omega_{j}$ of $\\overline{{\\Lambda}}^{\\prime}$ on the principal diagonal. We then have:  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{B}=W\\left(\\mathbf{I}\\phi-\\Omega\\right)^{-1}W^{-1}\n$$  \n\nIn fact, by letting $D=({\\bf I}\\phi-\\Omega)^{-1}$ in this case the $i k$ element of $\\mathbf{B}$ can be written as  \n\n$$\nB_{i k}=\\sum_{j}\\sum_{\\ell}w_{i j}D_{j\\ell}w_{\\ell k}^{-1}=\\sum_{j=1}^{n}{\\frac{w_{i j}w_{j k}^{-1}}{\\phi-\\omega_{j}}}\n$$  \n\nThe identity $\\mathbf{W}\\left(\\mathbf{I}\\phi-\\Omega\\right)^{-1}\\mathbf{W}^{-1}=\\left(\\phi I-\\overline{{\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}}}^{\\prime}\\right)^{-1}$ yields the result.

Spurious regression tests  \n\nWe describe the particular spurious regression tests as presented in Torous and Yan (1999), who closely follow Richardson and Stock (1989). Suppose that we have the pair of series  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{y_{t+1}}}&{{=}}&{{a+b x_{t}+u_{t+1}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{x_{t+1}}}&{{=}}&{{\\alpha+\\phi x_{t}+v_{t+1}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $y_{t}=\\log{\\left(R_{t}\\right)}$ is the log return and where $\\varepsilon_{t}=(u_{t},v_{t})^{\\prime}$ is a martingale difference sequence such that $E\\left[\\varepsilon_{t}\\varepsilon_{t}^{\\prime}|\\varepsilon_{t-1},\\varepsilon_{t-2}...\\right]=\\Sigma$ and such that $u_{t}$ and $v_{t}$ have only contemporaneous correlation $\\rho=C o r r\\left(u_{t},v_{t}\\right)$ . Tourus and Yan (1999) study the asymptotic distribution of the least square estimator obtained by regressing the long-term return $\\begin{array}{r}{y_{t+1}(K)=\\sum_{i=1}^{K}y_{t+i}}\\end{array}$ onto the predictive variable $x_{t}$ under the null hypothesis that there is no relation between $y_{t}$ and $x_{t}$ but through the contemporaneous correlation of the series. That is, the null-hypothesis is $\\mathcal{H}_{0}:b=0$ . They show that indeed the for given $K$ , the estimated $\\beta\\left(K\\right)$ is consistent as $T\\to\\infty$ , but its NeweyWest adjusted $t$ statistic $t_{\\beta(K)}$ has a non-standard distribution which depends on the correlation $\\rho$ between $u_{t}$ and $v_{t}$ . If $\\rho=0$ , then $t_{\\beta(K)}$ has indeed a standard normal distribution. They also show that if the number of non-overlapping intervals does not grow to infinity with $T$ , that is if $T/K\\to c$ , constant, then $\\beta\\left(K\\right)$ is no longer consistent and $t_{\\beta(K)}$ has a non-standard distribution that depends on both $\\rho$ and $c$  \n\nIn order to check the robustness of our results, we take the suggestions contained in Torous and Yan (1999) and obtain more robust confidence intervals for the coefficient $\\beta\\left(K\\right)$ in our predictive regressions by means of Monte Carlo Simulations. More specifically, we perform the following exercise: Let $x_{t}$ in equation (53) be any of the regressors used in the forecasting regressions, i.e. the labor-income to consumption ratio $s_{w,t}$ , the (log) dividend price ratio $\\log\\left(D_{t}/P_{t}\\right)$ , both of them or the interaction term $s_{w,t}\\log\\left(D_{t}/P_{t}\\right)$ . For each of them, we first compute the parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\phi$ in equation (53) from a time-series regression and the matrix $\\Sigma=E\\left[\\varepsilon_{t}\\varepsilon_{t}^{\\prime}\\right]$ to take into account the correlation between $u_{t}$ and $v_{t}$ (recall that if the correlation $\\rho=0$ , then $\\beta\\left(K\\right)$ is indeed consistent as $T\\to\\infty$ and $t_{\\beta(K)}$ is indeed distributed as a standard normal distribution. In this case all the results in the previous section hold.) Given our sample size $T=216$ for the period 1946-1999, we simulate 10,000 paths of the system (52)-(53) under the null hypothesis that $b=0$ . For each sample, we compute the predictive regressions as in equations (23)-(26) and obtain a distribution for $\\beta\\left(K\\right)$ . This is tabulated in Table VII. We repeated the experiment using both the estimations of the relevant parameters of (52)-(53) and the sample sizes corresponding to the periods 1952-1999 and 1952-1994 and obtained extremely similar cutoff values for $\\beta\\left(K\\right)$ , which we do not report for brevity.  \n\nTABLEI Summary Statistics: 1946:01 - 1999:04   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>mean (quarterly)</td><td>st.dev.

I find that firms reduce debt ratios following the adoption of these laws, with this result stronger for firms that experience larger increases in firing costs. I also document that, following the adoption of these laws, a firm's degree of operating leverage rises, earnings variability increases, and employment becomes more rigid. Overall, these results are consistent with higher firing costs crowding out financial leverage via increasing financial distress costs.  \n\nKeywords: Capital structure, Firing costs, Employment protection, Financial distress costs  \n\nJEL Classifications: G32, G33, J63, K31  \n\nHow do the costs associated with discharging workers (i.e., “firing costs\") affect capital structure decisions? Prior work finds that firms with higher financial leverage ratios and those in technical default are more likely to discharge workers (e.g., Sharpe (1994), Hanka (1998), Falato and Liang (2015)).1 Yet, discharging workers can involve hidden costs, such as those arising from collective bargaining agreements, discrimination claims, and wrongful termination lawsuits. These employee firing costs create frictions that constrain a firm's ability to discharge workers. While it is well recognized in economics that firing costs can have a significant effect on real outcomes such as wages, employment, and investment, it is less clear how these costs relate to financing decisions.  \n\nFrom a theoretical perspective, the effect of firing costs on capital structure decisions is ambiguous. On the one hand, an increase in firing costs could lead to higher debt ratios by lowering employees' risk of unemployment. Titman (1984) and Agrawal and Matsa (2013) suggest that employees demand a wage premium for bearing the increased risk of unemployment that arises from using financial leverage. Thus, if higher firing costs reduce an employee's risk of dismissal, this wage premium shrinks and firms could increase debt ratios so as to capture a larger share of the tax benefits of debt.  \n\nOn the other hand, higher firing costs could lower optimal debt ratios by increasing financial distress costs. First, because distressed firms are often forced to discharge workers to cover cash flow shortfalls (e.g., Ofek (1993), Kang and Shivdasani (1997)), the additional firing costs incurred as a result of discharging workers increase the total costs of distress. Second, higher firing costs make it more difficult to reduce employment when firms need to do so, such as during economic downturns (e.g., Bentolila and Bertola (1990), Autor, Donohue, and Schwab (2006), Messina and Vallanti (2007). This effect can make labor costs more fixed in nature, which can raise operating leverage and increase a firm's risk of becoming distressed (e.g., Mandelker and Rhee (1984), Mauer and Triantis (1994), Kahl, Lunn, and Nilsson (2014).  \n\nTo test these competing predictions, one needs to overcome the endogeneity problem associated with the fact that a firm's firing costs are determined in part by its financial leverage. In particular, firing costs are a function of the expected costs from firing employees combined with the probability of firing such employees, which increases with a firm's debt ratio. A second concern is that firing costs are unobservable. However, even if they were observable, it is likely impossible to control for all factors that affect both leverage and firing costs. In this paper, I attempt to identify the causal effect of firing costs on capital structures by exploiting the quasi-natural experiment created by the adoption of Wrongful Discharge Laws (WDLs) by U.S. state courts over the period 1967 to 1995.  \n\nWDLs matured into three common law exceptions to “at-will employment\" in an effort to protect against wrongful termination.2 I focus on the effect of the adoption of one particular WDL—the good faith exception. In its broadest sense, this exception applies when a court determines that an employer discharged a worker out of bad faith, malice, or retaliation. In these cases, employees can recover contractual losses and punitive damages. This exception represents the largest deviation from at-will employment and is arguably the most far reaching of the three (e.g., Dertouzos and Karoly (1992), Kugler and Saint-Paul (2004)).  \n\nImportantly, WDLs increase firing costs. Jung (1997) finds that plaintiffs won $\\$1.29$ million on average in 1996, and Boxold (2008) documents average (maximum) awards of $\\$0.59$ million $\\$5.4$ million) over the 2001 to 2007 period. While these average awards are arguably small for large firms, firms can be subject to several lawsuits at any point in time, which can substantially raise their legal liability.3 Also, the fear of very large settlements could alter the behavior of risk-averse managers (Dertouzos, Holland, and Ebener (1988), as  \n\n$46\\%$ of surveyed public firms' managers express concerns regarding losses arising from such lawsuits.4 Consistent with these laws increasing firing costs, prior research finds that employment levels, employment volatility, and firm entry decrease following the adoption of the good faith exception (Dertouzos and Karoly (1992), Autor, Kerr, and Kugler (2007)). I also find that firms experience cumulative abnormal stock returns of $-1.05\\%$ to $-1.22\\%$ anda reduction in the market value of equity of $\\$4.3$ to $\\$5.0$ million when their state adopts this law, suggesting that the law's adoption is not only costly but also partially unanticipated.  \n\nTo test for the effect on capital structure decisions, I use a difference-in-differences approach in which the treatment and control groups consist of firms headquartered in states that have and have not adopted the good faith exception, respectively. The regressions control for firm and year fixed effects and firm characteristics known to affect capital structure decisions. I also control for several state-level variables to help ensure that economic and political conditions do not spuriously drive the results. I find that, following the adoption of the good faith exception, book and market leverage ratios decrease by 1.5 and 1.0 percentage points, respectively. Compared to their respective sample means, book and market leverage decreaseby $6.1\\%$ and $3.6\\%$ . These results continue to hold when I use alternative measures of leverage, such as leverage net of cash holdings.  \n\nThe key identifying assumption central to a causal interpretation of the results is that, in the absence of the treatment, the average change in debt ratios would have been the same for both treatment and control firms. Several features of WDLs and results from a variety of robustness tests suggest that this parallel trends assumption is satisfied. First, because WDLs are based in common law, a judge's decision to adopt the good faith exception is more likely due to the merits of the case than political and economic factors (e.g., Walsh and Schwarz (1996). In line with this view, I find that out of a large set of economic and political variables that potentially affect whether courts adopt the good faith exception, almost none of them are correlated with the law's adoption. Second, due to the staggered adoption of the good faith exception, firms can be in both the treatment group and the control group at different times, which helps alleviate concerns about large differences between treatment and control firms. Third, I find that changes in leverage appear only after the passage of this law and that this result is robust to controlling for state-specific time trends in leverage. The results are also robust to matching treatment to control firms based on year, industry, and firm characteristics.  \n\nI also exploit two sources of cross-sectional variation in industry characteristics and estimate triple-difference regression models. These tests not only shed further light on the mechanisms underlying my results but also address econometric concerns by controlling for state $\\times$ year fixed effects that difference out all confounding factors that vary at the stateyear level. First, because firms that discharge workers more frequently face a higher risk of wrongful termination lawsuits, these firms should reduce debt more following the adoption of the good faith exception. Second, WDLs do not generally pertain to temporary or unionized employees (Miles (2000), Autor (2003)), and thus firms operating in industries that employ a smaller fraction of these workers should also reduce debt more following the law's adoption. Consistent with these predictions, declines in leverage following the adoption of the good faith exception are larger for firms operating in industries and states that have more employee discharges, volatile earnings, full-time workers, or nonunionized workers.  \n\nOverall, my findings are consistent with higher firing costs affecting debt ratios via increased financial distress costs. While I am unable to test how much of this effect is due to an increase in financial losses once a firm becomes distressed, I show that higher firing costs affect risk and employment decisions in ways that are consistent with increased operating leverage. In particular, I find that the sensitivity of changes in earnings to changes in sales (i.e., degree of operating leverage) is higher following the adoption of the good faith exception. Earnings are also less persistent and display greater year-over-year variation. Further, firms are less likely to discharge workers after a decline in earnings, employment flows are less volatile, and variation in employment is less sensitive to variation in earnings.  \n\nIn sum, this paper documents that firms reduce financial leverage when it becomes more expensive to discharge workers, and that the effect of employee firing costs on capital structure works largely though traditional trade-off theory mechanisms rather than pure labor mechanisms, such as workers unemployment risk (e.g., Agrawal and Matsa (2013), Kim (20i3)). This study thus broadly contributes to the literature examining the determinants of capital structure decisions (e.g., Titman and Wessels (1988), Rajan and Zingales (1995), Lemmon, Roberts, and Zender (2008).  \n\nMy paper is not the first to document results consistent with less flexible labor markets crowding out financial leverage by increasing operating leverage. In a closely related paper, Simintzi, Vig, and Volpin (2015) find a negative relation between the debt ratios of firms in a number of countries and an index of country-level employment protection legislation. My study is distinct, however, in that I provide empirical evidence that an increase in firing costs raises operating leverage. Further, I study the effect of an individual employment law on firms in a single country (the U.S.), which is advantageous because it allows me to employ a relatively homogeneous sample in terms of legal structure, financial and economic development, infrastructure, etc. In addition, because the U.S. has substantially less rigid labor protection laws compared to European countries, there is much less research on the effects of these laws in the U.S. Notwithstanding, a significant number of firms in the U.S. are subject to employment protection legislation and lawsuits (wrongful termination lawsuits rose $260\\%$ over a recent 20-year period and $40.7\\%$ between2005and 2010 (Boxold (2008), Haider and Plancich (2012)).5 My study therefore provides insights on how U.S. employment protection laws can also shape corporate financing behaviors.  \n\nIn other related work, Schmalz (2015) shows that unionization, which increases labor adjustment costs, causes financially unconstrained U.S. firms to decrease debt ratios and increase cash holdings, and Kuzmina (2013) documents that lower operating flexibility associated with employing more full-time workers results in Spanish manufacturing firms lowering financial leverage. While these papers and my own have similarities, each study has a different research design, including sample construction (e.g., U.S. vs. international and manufacturing vs. all industrial), estimation strategy (differences-in-differences, regression discontinuity, and instrumental variables), and worker focus (unionized vs.  \n\nnonunionized and temporary vs. full-time). Thus, while each study has strengths and weaknesses with respect to external and internal validity, the consistent results across the studies complement one another.  \n\nMy study also extends prior work that focuses largely on the real effects of WDLs, such as employment outcomes (e.g., Dertouzos and Karoly (1992), Autor (2003), Autor, Donohue, and Schwab (2006)), capital expenditures and productivity (Autor, Kerr, and Kugler (2007)), and innovation (Acharya, Baghai, and Subramanian (2014)). One implication of my findings is that some of the results in these papers could be related to the effect of WDLs on firms financing decisions.  \n\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section I develops the theoretical link between firing costs and capital structure decisions. Section I discusses institutional background, identification, and the endogeneity of WDLs. Section IHI describes the data and empirical methodology. Section IV reports the main empirical results. Section V discusses alternative explanations. Section VI concludes.  \n\n## 1. Theoretical Link between Firing Costs and Capital Structure  \n\nWhy would higher employee firing costs affect capital structure decisions? On the one hand, an increase in firing costs could lead to higher debt ratios by lowering employees' unemployment risk. Titman (1984) and Agrawal and Matsa (2013) suggest that firms trade off the benefits of debt financing against higher wages demanded by workers in compensation for bearing higher unemployment risk in the event the firm goes bankrupt or experiences severe financial distress. In particular, because the use of more debt financing increases the likelihood that the firm will become distressed and discharge workers, employees demand a wage premium for bearing the higher risk of unemployment. These wage premiums offset the benefits of debt financing, resulting in a negative relation between debt ratios and workers' unemployment risk. Thus, if higher firing costs reduce the risk that employees will be discharged, higher firing costs could decrease unemployment risk, leading to lower wage premiums and higher financial leverage ratios.  \n\nOn the other hand, higher firing costs could lead to lower optimal debt ratios by increasing a firm's financial losses in the event of distress as well as its risk of becoming distressed. Under the traditional trade-off theory of capital structure, firms weigh the benefits from tax shields against financial distress costs (e.g., Kraus and Litzenberger (1973), Scott (1976), Bradley, Jarrell, and Kim (1984), Graham (2003). Several studies suggest that distressed firms often discharge workers to meet outstanding debt obligations by reducing costs (e.g., John, Lang, and Netter (1992), Ofek (1993), Kang and Shivdasani (1997), Denis and Kruse (2000). Thus, when firms incur the firing costs associated with discharging workers, these additional costs increase the losses associated with financial distress. Consequently, if firing costs increase, this effect should directly offset the tax benefits of debt and result in lower optimal financial leverage ratios.  \n\nIn addition, if it is costlier to dismiss employees, firms are less likely to adjust their labor force in response to prevailing economic conditions, for instance, by discharging workers during economic downturns. This result has been documented in international settings. For example, Messina and Vallanti (2007) show that more stringent European firing laws significantly weaken the relation between layoffs and the business cycle, and Kugler and Pica (2008) find that higher dismissal costs in Italy reduce worker separation rates.6 This lower sensitivity of workforce reductions to economic downturns makes labor costs more fixed in nature, resulting in greater operating leverage. Thus, higher firing costs can also reduce optimal financial leverage ratios by increasing a firm's likelihood of becoming financially distressed through higher operating leverage (e.g., Van Horne (1974), Mandelker and Rhee (1984), Mauer and Triantis (1994), Kahl, Lunn, and Nilsson (2014)).  \n\n## I1. Wrongful Discharge Laws  \n\n### A. Institutional Background  \n\nTo help protect employees from unfair dismissal practices, many states began recognizing exceptions to the terminate at-will rule in the 1970s typically known as WDLs. These WDLs matured into three common law exceptions. Some states recognize all three exceptions, while others recognize two, one, or none at all. Unlike federal laws that aim to protect a particular class of workers, such as union members, racial minorities, women, or the aged, these exceptions pertain to workers not already covered by federal legislation or by explicit contractual agreements (Miles (2000)).  \n\nThe good faith exception is based on the legal theory that an implied promise of good faith and fair dealing exists between employers and employees. This exception requires employers to treat workers in a fair manner (i.e., in good faith) and not take actions that would deprive employees of the benefit of employment without just cause. For example, employers cannot discharge workers out of bad faith, malice, or retaliation. Employers also violate this law if they discharge workers before pensions vest or employees receive bonuses or commissions that they are entitled to. However, in its broadest sense, this exception has been interpreted to imply that dismissal decisions are subject to a “just cause” standard, which can vastly expand the set of situations under which employees can sue.7  \n\nThe implied contract exception protects workers from termination when an employer has implicitly promised employees that they will not be discharged without good cause. These promises may be oral; if written in a handbook, they do not need to be negotiated with employees individually. Courts have also determined that employee tenure, a history of promotions or salary raises, general company policies, and typical industry practices can constitute an implied promise of ongoing employment.  \n\nLast, the public policy exception protects employees from termination for refusing to violate an established public policy or commit an illegal act, such as reporting an employer's wrongdoing, refusing to commit perjury, filing a worker's compensation claim, or performing jury duty. The underlying motivation behind the public policy exception is to protect employees from being discharged for performing a public service even if the action is not in the employer's interest.  \n\nBased on findings in prior work, it is possible that firms will adjust leverage ratios following the adoption of any (or all) of the WDLs. However, the good faith exception is arguably the most far-reaching of the three WDLs and hence likely to have the greatest impact on corporate outcomes, for several reasons. First, this exception represents the largest deviation from at-will employment because it can imply that termination must always be for just cause (e.g., Dertouzos and Karoly (1992), Kugler and Saint-Paul (2004). Second, unlike the implied contract exception but similar to the public policy exception, employees have both a contract and tort cause of action under the good faith exception. This means that an employee can recover not only contractual losses but also compensation for emotional distress and punitive damages. Importantly, emotional and punitive damages can substantially increase an employer's liability. Moreover, because punitive and emotional damages are determined by a jury without a clear formula, there is greater uncertainty associated with settlement amounts. Third, Miles (2000) and Autor, Kerr, and Kugler (2007) suggest that firms can largely prevent lawsuits arising from the implied contract exception by including disclaimers in their personnel manuals and employees handbooks stating that employment contracts are always at-will. Last, Autor, Kerr, and Kugler (2007) also note that the public policy exception generally does not impose substantial constraints on employer behavior because courts typically limit recovery to dismissals in which the employer violated or encouraged the violation of an identifiable statute or constitutional provision. Given that I find that the adoption of only the good faith exception affects leverage ratios, I focus my analyses and discussions on this exception and treat the adoption of the implied contract and public policy exceptions as additional control variables.  \n\n### B. Workforce Reductions, EPLI, and Wrongful Termination Lawsuits?  \n\nIn assuming that the adoption of WDLs increases employee firing costs, two questions arise. First, can workforce reductions lead to wrongful termination lawsuits? And second, can firms insure against wrongful termination claims?  \n\nUnder ordinary circumstances, economically motivated workforce reductions do not give rise to a claim of wrongful termination (e.g., Strong (1989)). Employers could be subject to wrongful termination claims, however, if they use layoffs as a pretext to fire certain employees for reasons unrelated to the economic necessity of the dismissals (see Appendix A for a discussion of two relevant cases). Thus, while layoffs may reduce the risk of wrongful termination lawsuits, they do not eliminate this risk.  \n\nA claim of wrongful termination under the good faith exception can also arise in the context of plant closings (Rhine (1986)). In general, a claim arises when employers, who have an informational and economical advantage over employees, harm employee welfare by concealing information about closings. For example, if an employer knows that it will close despite increased employee effort or productivity, any false assurances of job security could be deemed in violation of the good faith exception.8  \n\nToday, firms can purchase Employment Practices Liability Insurance (EPLI) to partially or completely offset losses related to wrongful termination claims (see Appendix B for a more in-depth discussion of EPLI). Over the period 1967 to 1995, however, the majority of sample firms were severely limited in their ability to insure against such claims because the market for EPLI did not start developing until the early 1990s, and was still in early stages of development by the mid-1990s. Further, the nearly universal consensus of firms and brokers was that early EPLI coverage was poor and pricing too high. Policies also contained exclusions related to downsizing, retaliation, and punitive damages.9 Moreover, prior to the introduction of EPLI, firms were rarely, if ever, able to recover wrongful termination damages under traditional forms of insurance, such as commercial general liability insurance and directors and officers liability insurance. Nevertheless, to the extent that insurance coverage reduces the risks and costs associated with employee litigation, the presence of insurance should only reduce the effect of the good faith exception on capital structures.10  \n\n### C. The Passage of Wrongful Discharge Laws by State Courts  \n\nTo identify precedent-setting court cases signaling that a state has passed a particular WDL, I largely follow Autor, Donohue, and Schwab (2006), who search for the first major appellate court decision that indicates the sustained adoption of a particular employment atwill exception. If a lower court's decision to adopt an exception is reversed on appeal, this state is not coded as passing the exception, whereas a state Supreme Court decision or a lower court decision that is not later reversed is coded as the passage of the exception. This coding is done separately for the good faith, implied contract, and public policy exceptions. However, in contrast to Autor, Donohue, and Schwab (2006), I code Utah as recognizing the good faith exception in 1989, as done by Walsh and Schwarz (1996) and Littler (2009). I next match these laws to the state in which each firm is headquartered (see, for example, Matsa (2010), Agrawal and Matsa (2013), Acharya, Baghai, and Subramanian (2014), Dougal, Parsons, and Titman (2015).11,12  \n\nFor each exception type, Table I summarizes the dates when exceptions were passed by state, and Figure 1 shows the number of states that had passed exceptions by year. The table and figure show that there is substantial variation in the passage of all three types of exceptions both across states and over time. The majority of states adopted WDLs between the early 1970s and the early 1990s. For example, while one, two, and five states had respectively passed good faith, implied contract, and public policy exceptions as of 1975, by 1995 11, 41, and 43 states had passed these three types of exceptions.  \n\n### D. Endogeneity and Predictability of the Adoption of the Good Faith Exception  \n\nMy identification strategy assumes that absent the passage of the good faith exception, the financial leverage ratios of firms headquartered in states that do and do not adopt this law would have evolved in the same way. This parallel trends assumption would be violated if the law's adoption systematically coincides with state-level political or economic factors and the regression models do not adequately control for these factors. In the following subsections, I discuss the extent to which the adoption of the good faith exception is a function of political and economic characteristics as well as the extent to which its adoption is predictable by firms and market participants.  \n\n#### D.1. Endogeneity of the Adoption of the Good Faith Exception  \n\nTwo common sources of endogeneity could affect interpretation of the results. First, lobbying activities may influence courts′ decisions to recognize stronger employment laws. This concern is unlikely a large problem because, unlike other corporate laws such as business combination laws, the enactment of WDLs is based on judicial rather than legislative decisions. Because judicial decisions are more likely driven by the merits of the case than political economy considerations, lobbying activities are not likely to influence the enactment of these laws (Autor (2003), Acharya, Baghai, and Subramanian (2014).  \n\nSecond, changes in financial leverage and the adoption of the good faith exception could be spuriously correlated with underlying economic and political conditions. Walsh and Schwarz (1996) analyze published court decisions and find that judges cite the following reasons for adopting WDLs: (1) enhancing fairness in employment relationships, (2) assuring consistency with established principles of contract law, and (3) following other states that have already passed WDLs. These reasons do not appear to be related to factors that could lead firms to change their leverage. Moreover, these rationales imply that judges were not adopting the good faith exception with the intention of altering firms? financial policies or profitability. These findings therefore provide initial evidence that the adoption of this law likely represents an exogenous shock with respect to capital structure decisions and that any effect of its adoption on leverage ratios is an unintended consequence.  \n\nNevertheless, it is possible that judges are directly or indirectly motivated by factors that they do not cite. Accordingly, I also explore whether several state-level variables that have been hypothesized to impact a court's decision to adopt WDLs are correlated with the passage of the good faith exception. This set of economic variables draws largely on the discussion from Dertouzos and Karoly (1992).  \n\nMany states adopted the good faith exception in the 1980s. The adoption of this law could have coincided with several economic features. First, the fraction of unionized workers protected by collective bargaining agreements declined over time. Because this law protects nonunionized workers, the decline in union protection could have increased demand for its adoption. Second, the recession in the 1980s coincided with high unemployment rates, and courts may have been more likely to recognize the good faith exception when the unemployment rate in their state was higher, when a larger fraction of workers would benefit from protection. Third, ideological positions and attitudes towards labor could be a contributingfactor.  \n\nTo test these predictions, I follow Acharya, Baghai, and Subramanian (2014) and estimate a Cox proportional hazard model, where a failure event represents the adoption of the good faith exception. Table II presents the results. The sample spans the period 1967 to 1995, and states are excluded from the sample after they adopt this law. All predictor variables are measured as of year t-1 relative to the law's adoption. Also, all independent variables, except indicator variables, are standardized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Column 1 includes the following state-level explanatory variables, which are calculated each year: the fraction of unionized workers, the unemployment rate, GDP per capita, the fraction of a state's Congress members in the U.S. House of Representatives that belong to the Democratic Party, an indicator variable for whether the state has right-to-work laws, and indicator variables for whether the state has already adopted the implied contract and public policy exceptions.13 Column 2 further includes the change in the unionization rate, the change in the unemployment rate, and the percentage change in the state's GDP. Both columns show that only GDP per capita is positively related to the adoption of the good faith exception.  \n\nDertouzos and Karoly (1992) highlight potential regional patterns in the adoption of WDLs and suggest that a court's decision to adopt WDLs could be influenced by whether neighboring states have already enacted these laws. Bird and Smythe (2008) show that this spillover effect is driven by whether other states in the same federal circuit region have already adopted WDLs. To test for such an effect, column 3 also includes the fraction of states in the firm's federal circuit region that have already passed good faith, implied contact, and public policy exceptions. The results show a positive correlation between the adoption of the good faith exception and the fraction of states in the same federal circuit region that have already adopted this law.  \n\nColumn 4 shows that the adoption of the good faith exception is unrelated to preexisting state-level financial leverage (measured as the sales-based weighted average of book leverage per state-year), which provides initial evidence ruling out reverse causality.14 Last, column 5 adds year dummy variables. Both columns show that, after controlling for state. level leverage, GDP per capita no longer predicts the adoption of the good faith exception. However, the adoption of this law remains significantly correlated with the fraction of states in the same federal circuit region that have already adopted the law.  \n\nOverall, Table II shows that the adoption of the good faith exception is correlated with only GDP per capita and the fraction of other states in the firm's federal circuit region that have already adopted this law. These findings are consistent with the notion that political and economic factors do not significantly influence whether judges adopt this law.  \n\n#### D.2. Predictability of the Adoption of the Good Faith Exception  \n\nThere is little empirical evidence on whether the adoption of the good faith exception was anticipated. Given that the adoption of this law relates to two economic characteristics, firms and investors likely had some idea of whether a given state would eventually enact the law. However, as noted by Autor (2003, p.16), “because a court's issuance of a new precedent is an idiosyncratic function of its docket and the disposition of its justices, the timing of a change to the common law is likely to be in part unanticipated.\" In Section IV.B.1, I provide evidence in support of this conclusion by showing that debt ratios do not decline until after the passage of the law.  \n\nI next test whether capital markets fully anticipated the adoption of the good faith exception by examining stock price reactions around the dates when courts ruled on precedent-setting cases.15 Because all firms in a state are subject to the same announcement date, events are not independent and standard errors are biased due to correlation across firms in the same state. To address this issue, I create state-level portfolios and analyze announcement returns for the 12 states that have adopted this law (MacKinlay (1997)).16 I construct daily portfolio returns by equally weighting the daily stock returns of firms headquartered in a given state. I then calculate cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) using either the market model (equally weighted CRSP market portfolio) or the Fama and French (1993) three-factor model. Parameters are estimated over trading days [-280,-61] relative to the announcement date $(t{=}0)$  \n\nTable III presents the results. I find that, in the pre-announcement periods (days [- 21,-4] and [-3,-2]), CARs are negative and statistically insignificant. However, over the event window (days [-1,3]), CARs are negative and statistically significant, ranging from $\\cdot1.05\\%$ to $1.22\\%$ . Across the portfolios, the average firm's market capitalization is $\\$406$ million on day $t{=}{\\cdot}20$ . Thus, the average firm loses $\\$4.3$ to $\\$5.0$ million when its state adopts the good faith exception. This result could be interpreted as the amount investors expect this law to cost the average firm. Overall, these findings suggest that the adoption of this law was at least partially unanticipated and had an economically meaningful effect on firm value.17  \n\n## II1. Data and Empirical Methodology  \n\n### A. Sample Selection  \n\nThe main sample includes 88,997 firm-years for industrial firms (utilities and financial firms are excluded) that have publicly traded stock over the 1967 to 1995 period, are incorporated in the U.S., and have nonmissing data for the main variables of interest. The sample period starts five years before the second-earliest enactment of a WDL when California passed the implied contract exception in 1972. Data limitations prevent the sample from encompassing the first event, California's passage of the public policy exception in 1959.18 The sample period ends five years after Ohio passed the public policy exception in 1990. I select this year as my cutoff rather than extending the analysis to cover the last event (Louisiana's passage of the good faith exception in 1998) because few additional observations enter the treatment group when Delaware, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Wyoming pass a WDL $1.19\\%$ of firms are headquartered in these states during these later years), and using the extended sample period may create noise around identification of the effect that the adoption of these laws has on capital structures.19  \n\n### B. Empirical Methodology  \n\nI adopt a difference-in-differences research design to examine the relation between  \n\nthe passage of the good faith exception and financial leverage at the firm-year level. Specifically, I estimate the following panel regression model:  \n\n$$\nD e b t_{i s t}=a_{1}G F_{s t}+a_{2}I C_{s t}+a_{3}P P_{s t}+X_{i s t}\\beta+\\nu_{i}+\\omega_{t}+\\varepsilon_{i s t}~,\n$$  \n\nwhere $D e b t_{i s t}$ is a specific measure of financial leverage at firm $i$ in state $s$ and year $t$ , and $G F_{s t,}I C_{s t}$ and $P P_{s t}$ are indicator variables for whether the state in which a firm is headquartered has adopted the good faith, implied contract, and public policy exceptions as of year $t$ , respectively. The regression model also includes a set of control variables $X_{i s t},$ firm fixed effects $\\nu_{i}$ , and year fixed effects $\\omega_{t}$ . The firm fixed effects control for time-invariant omitted firm characteristics and ensure that estimates of $a_{1}$ reflect average within-firm changes in leverage over time rather than simple cross-sectional correlations. The year fixed effects account for transitory nation-wide factors such as macroeconomic conditions that could affect debt ratios and the likelihood that a state adopts the good faith exception.  \n\nThe control variables include variables commonly found in leverage regressions (see, for example, Harris and Raviv (1991), Rajan and Zingales (1995), Frank and Goyal (2008), Lemmon, Roberts, and Zender (2008)). These variables include log assets (a control for firm size), the market-to-book ratio (a proxy for growth opportunities), profitability (a proxy for the availability of internal funds), the proportion of assets that are fixed (a proxy for potential collateral), and an indicator variable for whether the firm paid a common dividend (a proxy for financial constraints). Following recent work examining the effect of labor market frictions on financial leverage (e.g., Matsa (2010), Agrawal and Matsa (2013)), I also include the modified Altman's $\\mathbf{Z}$ -score to control for a firm's probability of going bankrupt (MacKieMason (1990). Last, to control for local political and economic conditions, I include statelevel GDP per capita, the fraction of other states in the same federal circuit region that have passed the good faith exception as of year $t$ , the state-level one-year GDP growth rate, and the fraction of a state's Congress members representing their state in the U.S. House of Representatives that belong to the Democratic Party in a given year.  \n\nI correct estimated standard errors in all regressions for heteroskedasticity and clustering at the state level. Given that the variation in the good faith exception is at the state level, this clustering method accounts for potential time-varying correlations in unobserved factors that affect different firms within a given state (Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan (2004). This methodology also corrects for within-firm error term correlations over time and is therefore more general than firm-level clustering.  \n\nAppendix C provides detailed variable definitions. Panel A of Table IV presents summary statistics. Continuous variables, except economic variables, are winsorized at their $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$ and $99^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentiles, and dollar values are expressed in 2009 dollars. For this sample, the average ratio of debt to the book value of assets is $24.5\\%$  \n\nPanel B of Table IV compares variable means for firms headquartered in states that eventually adopt the good faith exception against those of firms headquartered in states that do not adopt this law during the sample period. All the variables, except for political balance, are significantly different across the two samples. Ideally, the treatment and control firms would be relatively similar along these dimensions. However, because they are not, in a first pass at controlling for these differences, I include each variable as a control variable. In Section IV.B.2, I address this issue more directly by performing propensity score matching and interacting each control variable with a treatment dummy, which allows the effect of the variables to be different for treatment and control firms.  \n\n## IV. Empirical Results  \n\n### A. Wrongful Discharge Laws and Financial Leverage  \n\nI create two measures of financial leverage. I use Book Leverage (total debt divided by book value of assets) as my primary measure because many managers focus on book leverage rather than market leverage when making capital structure decisions (Graham and Harvey (2002)). Further, Welch (2004) shows that a substantial portion of the variation in market leverage ratios stems from variation in market values rather than changes in debt policies. Nevertheless, in all of the analyses that follow, I also report results using Market Leverage (the book value of long-term debt plus debt in current liabilities divided by market value of assets) because this measure is more closely tied to theoretical predictions related to target leverage levels. All of the results are robust to using either measure of leverage as the dependent variable.  \n\nFigure 2 presents a graphical analysis of the relation between the adoption of the good faith exception and financial leverage. To create this figure, I follow Acharya, Baghai, and Subramanian (2014) and regress book leverage (or market leverage) on year fixed effects and dummy variables indicating the year relative to the law's adoption, for up to 10 years before and after its adoption. The last variable is set to one if 10 or more years has passed since the adoption of this law. The y-axis plots the estimated coefficients on each indicator variable (Panel A for book leverage and Panel B for market leverage). The x-axis shows the time relative to the adoption of the good faith exception for $\\pm5$ years around its adoption. The dashed lines correspond to the $90\\%$ confidence intervals of the coefficient estimates, where confidence intervals are calculated from standard errors clustered by state. Both graphs show that leverage is not statistically different between treated and control firms before the adoption of this law. However, in the years after its adoption, book and market leverage are significantly lower for treated firms.  \n\nPanel A of Table V presents the results of the analysis examining the effect of the adoption of the good faith exception on book leverage in a multivariate framework. Column 1 includes only year and firm fixed effects as control variables and shows a negative but statistically insignificant relation between its adoption and book leverage. This insignificant relation could be due in part to changes in other known predictors of leverage following the adoption of the good faith exception. For example, I find that size and asset tangibility increase following the law's adoption, which could be related to firms engaging in capital deepening (Autor, Kerr, and Kugler (2007). Profitability also declines slightly, but this effect is statistically insignificant. Because size and asset tangibility are positively correlated with leverage, excluding these variables from the regression potentially offsets part of the effect of the adoption of the good faith exception on debt ratios. Consistent with this notion, after controlling for size, profitability, and asset tangibility in column 2, the negative relation between its adoption and leverage becomes statistically significant. The estimated coefficients imply that book leverage declines by 1.1 percentage points following the enactment of this law. Relative to the sample mean of book leverage of $24.5\\%$ , this finding represents a reduction in leverage of $4.5\\%$ (=0.011/0.245).  \n\nColumn 3 further controls for the market-to-book ratio, and column 4 controls for the modified z-score and whether a firm pays dividends.20 Adding these controls increases both the economic and statistical significance of the effect of the passage of the good faith exception. Last, column 5 controls for the four political and economic variables. Including these variables does not affect the economic significance of the effect of the law's adoption. Book leverage declines by 1.5 percentage points or $6.1\\%$ relative to its  sample mean $(=0.015/0.245)$ . While controlling for these variables weakens the statistical significance slightly, its effect remains significant at the $5\\%$ level. This last model with the full set of control variables is my main specification, which I use throughout the rest of the paper.  \n\nPanel B of Table V shows a similar relationship between the adoption of the good faith exception and market leverage. The effect of its adoption becomes negative and statistically significant only after controlling for size, profitability, and asset tangibility. In terms of economic significance, the estimated coefficients in column 2 imply that market leverage declines by 0.9 percentage points or $3.3\\%$ relative to its sample mean of $27.5\\%$ . Controlling for growth opportunities, dividend payments, and financial distress increases the economic and statistical significance of the effect of the law's adoption. Column 4 shows that market leverage declines by 1.3 percentage points.21 Last, controlling for political and economic factors in column 5 reduces the economic significance of the effect of the passage of this law. Market leverage declines by 1.0 percentage points or $3.6\\%$ relative to its sample mean. However, this result remains statistically significant at the $1\\%$ level.  \n\nTo establish whether the estimates from Table V are reasonable, I follow an approach similar to Agrawal and Matsa (2013) and calculate the average tax shield loss due to reducing leverage following the adoption of the good faith exception. The present value of the tax shield can be estimated as the value of debt times the marginal tax rate. Assuming that the average firm has a marginal tax rate of $30\\%$ , the present value of the incremental loss in the value of the tax shield from permanently decreasing book leverage by 1.5 percentage points following the law's adoption (column 5 of Panel A) is $0.45\\%$ of the firm's asset value $(=1.5\\%\\times30\\%)$ 0. Given that the average firm's book value of assets is $\\$953$ million, this reduction in the tax shield amounts to $\\$4.29$ million $(=0.45\\%\\times\\$953$ million).  \n\nIf the average wrongful termination award is $\\$1.29$ million (Jung (1997)), this 1.5 percentage point reduction in leverage would have to prevent at least 3.3 lawsuits over the life of the firm $(=\\$4.29/\\$1.29)$ . However, for this value to be meaningful, it needs to be compared to how many wrongful termination claims a firm could face over its lifetime. Unfortunately, deriving such estimates is difficult because the decisions in many wrongful termination cases are never published and are often settled before trial. Therefore, I start with the estimate from Westin and Feliu (1988) that there are 20,000 wrongful termination cases pending in state courts at any point in time. Because WDLs apply to full-time, nonunionized workers, I obtain U.S. employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for 1988 and estimate the number of workers protected by WDLs as 78.2 million. This value equals the total number of nonfarm full-time employees (about 95.2 million) less the number of unionized workers (about 17.0 million). These figures imply that, on average, approximately one out of every 3,910 employees will file a wrongful termination claim in state courts. In my sample, the mean firm has 6,167 employees and could therefore expect 1.56 wrongful termination lawsuits per year. I use the number of years firms in my sample trade as public corporations to proxy for the number of years they could expect to operate. This figure is 14.6 years based on CRSP data. Thus, the average firm could expect 22.8 $(=14.6\\times1.56)$ wrongful termination lawsuits over its lifetime, suggesting that the reduction in leverage following the adoption of the good faith exception would have to reduce the number of lawsuits by $14.5\\%$ $(=3.3/22.8)$ . Overall, these back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that the estimates from Table V are reasonable.  \n\n### B. Econometric Concerns and Robustness Tests  \n\nI next address econometric concerns and discuss several robustness tests.  \n\n#### B.1. Pre-Treatment Trends  \n\nFigure 2 suggests that treatment and control firms share similar pre-treatment trends. Next, I follow Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003) and conduct an additional test to help alleviate potential endogeneity concerns related to reverse causality and provide further support for the conclusion that my experiment likely satisfies the parallel trends assumption. To do so, I examine the timing of financial leverage changes relative to the timing of the passage of the good faith exception. If reverse causality is an issue or pre-treatment trends exist, then there would be a trend of declining (possibly increasing) leverage before the enactment of this law.  \n\nSimilar to the regression used to create Figure 2, I replace the variable for whether the state in which a firm is headquartered has adopted the good faith exception as of year $t$ with the following indicator variables: Good Faith-1, Good Faitho, Good Faith1, and Good Faith2+. These four variables are set to one if the firm is headquartered in a state that (1) will pass the law next year, (2) passes the law in the current year, (3) passed the law one year ago, and (4) passed the law two or more years ago.22 The results in Table VI imply that there is no trend of declining book or market leverage before the adoption of the good faith exception and that they decline only after the enactment of this law (columns 1 and 3). These results survive after including state-specific time trends that allow each state to have different trends in leverage that could have coincided with the adoption of this law (columns 2 and 4). Overall, the finding that debt ratios decline only after the enactment of the good faith exception suggests that the relation does not suffer from reverse causality and that there are no pre-treatment trends.  \n\n#### B.2. The Effect of Covariate Balance  \n\nI next examine the robustness of the negative relation between leverage and the adoption of the good faith exception to controlling for differences in firm characteristics between treatment and control firms as shown in Panel B of Table IV. First, I create two matched samples by matching treatment firms to control firms using a propensity score methodology. I start by retaining all observations for treatment and control firms in year t-1 relative to the adoption of the good faith exception. I require that both sets of firms have at least one observation in the -5 years and at least one observation in the $+5$ years around the adoption of the law. I then use a logistic regression to estimate the probability of being a treated firm. For the first match, I estimate propensity scores using Log Assets, Profitability, Fixed Assets, and Market-to-Book. For the second match, I also include Modified Z-Score as a regressor.  \n\nFor both matches, I match each treatment firm in year t-1 to a control firm (with replacement), matching on year, three-digit SIC industry, and closest propensity score (with a max difference between propensity scores of 0.o1). When treatment firms have multiple control firm matches, I retain the control firm with the closest propensity score. I keep all observations in the $\\pm5$ years around the adoption of the good faith exception. For the second match, I also match treatment firms to control firms based on whether they pay dividends. Panel A of Table VII shows a successful matching procedure. The sample means of control variables for matched treated and control firms are not significantly different.  \n\nNext, I estimate the effect of the adoption of the good faith exception for the matched samples using the model specification from column 5 of Table V that includes the full set of control variables. Columns 1 to 4 of Panel B continue to show a significant decline in financial leverage ratios for treatment firms relative to control firms after the adoption of this law.  \n\nAs a last robustness test addressing covariate balance, I estimate regression models using the full sample but interact each control variable with an indicator variable for whether the firm is in the treatment group. This test therefore allows the effect of control variables to be different across treatment and control firms. The results, reported in Internet Appendix  \n\nTable IAI, are robust to this model specification.23  \n\n#### B.3. Additional Robustness Tests of the Main Specification  \n\nI conduct several additional robustness tests of the main specification. Table VIII shows that the decline in financial leverage following the adoption of the good faith exception is robust to using alternative definitions of leverage, including (1) the natural logarithm of one plus the total value of debt, to address the concern that the observed decline in debt ratios could be due to an increase in assets, (2) net book and market leverage (debt less cash), to account for firms increasing liquid assets when firing costs increase, and (3) adding the value of capitalized operating leases to debt, to account for potential underestimation of a firm's true degree of financial leverage by ignoring operating lease commitments (Eisfeldt and Rampini (2009), Rauh and Sufi (2012)).24  \n\nIn Internet Appendix Tables IAII to IAV, I also document that the negative relation between the adoption of the good faith exception and book and market leverage ratios is robust to the following:  \n\ni. Controlling for all the economic and political factors discussed in Section II.D.1 that could be correlated with the adoption of the good faith exception.   \nii. Including year $\\times$ two-digit SIC industry fixed effects to control for industry shocks that could have coincided with a decline in leverage and the adoption of this law.   \nii. Including Log Assets $\\times$ two-digit SIC industry fixed effects to control in part for the extent to which a firm could have out-of-state operations.   \niv. Controlling for average state-level financial leverage (as measured by the sales-based weighted average of book (or market) leverage per state-year).   \nV. Using alternative sample periods. In particular, the results are robust to (1) extending the sample period to 2003, which is five years after the last event (i.e., when Louisiana adopted the good faith exception in 1998), and (2) restricting the sample to the period 1978 to 1999, as in Autor, Donohue, and Schwab (2006).   \nvi. Using the dating schemes and precedent-setting cases employed by Autor, Donohue, and Schwab (2006), Dertouzos and Karoly (1992), and Morriss (1995) to account for subjectivity in identifying precedent-setting cases.   \nVii. Restricting the sample to firms that are more likely to have geographically concentrated operations and thus firms for which state-level laws better capture an increase in their firing costs. In particular, the results are robust to (1) excluding firms with international operations as indicated by nonmissing and nonzero foreign income or foreign taxes and (2) excluding firms in industries in which a large percentage of the workforce is likely geographically dispersed, which include retail, wholesale, and transportation (Agrawal and Matsa (2013).  \n\nvi.  Attempting to account for relocations of headquarters. Because Compustat provides only the most recent state in which headquarters are located, I use the programming language PHP to collect reported locations from 10-K filings on the SEC Edgar website. I obtain these data for most firms between 1996 and 2011 and for some firms as early as 1992. The results are robust to excluding all firms identified as having relocated to another state. A limitation of this sample restriction, however, is that it only accounts for firms that relocated to a different state over the 1992 to 2011 period. Thus, following an approach similar to that in Amore, Schneider, and Zaldokas (2013), I also eliminate firms that likely switched locations during the earlier years in my sample. The results are robust to excluding firms that had sales or asset growth of more than $100\\%$ in any year when 10-K data are unavailable.25  \n\n### C. Cross-Sectional Tests of the Effect of the Good Faith Exception on Financial Leverage  \n\nI next exploit cross-sectional variation in industry characteristics to estimate difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) regression models. These tests serve two purposes. First, they provide evidence on which industries and firms are more affected by higher firing costs and hence provide support for the underlying hypothesized mechanisms. Second, it is possible that unobserved trends in leverage or other unobserved factors affect firms headquartered in states that do and do not adopt the good faith exception differently. By identifying firms within treated states that are more likely affected by the adoption of this law and comparing groups of firms within the same state, the DDD estimator can help alleviate these concerns.  \n\nThe first set of cross sections is based on industry cash flow volatility and labor turnover rates. Firms operating in industries with more volatile cash flows are more likely to need to adjust employment in response to cash flow fluctuations (e.g., Cunat and Melitz (2012)). Similarly, firms operating in industries that discharge workers more frequently likely rely on layoffs to make staffing changes and manage costs. Thus, the adoption of the good faith exception should lead to a larger increase in expected firing costs for firms in these industries and hence have a larger effect on their capital structure decisions.  \n\nI measure industry cash flow volatility as the average cash flow volatility across all firms in the same three-digit NAICS industry, state, and year. A firm's cash flow volatility is the standard deviation of the ratio of income before extraordinary items plus depreciation and amortization to book assets over the preceding 10 years. Firms must have at least three years of data to enter the industry average calculation. I measure each industry's employee discharge rate in two ways. For the first proxy, I calculate the fraction of firms in each firm's three-digit NAICS industry, state, and year that reduce their number of employees by at least $5\\%$ and average this measure over the previous 10 years.26 The second proxy is similar to that in Agrawal and Matsa (2013). For each three-digit NAICS industry, state, and year, I collect data on the total number of employee separations from the Bureau of Labor  \n\nStatistics’ “Mass Layoff Statistics\" and the number of total employees from the Bureau of Economic Analysis 0over the years 1998 to 2006.27 I then average separation rates (number of separations divided by number of employees) for each industry and state over the entire 1998 to 2006 period and use this variable as a single industry measure for the entire sample period. For all three industry measures, I create an indicator variable that is set to one if its value is above the sample median and zero otherwise.  \n\nColumns 1 to 3 of Panels A and B in Table IX show that the adoption of the good faith exception has little to no effect on the leverage ratios of firms operating in industries with below-median cash flow volatility or separation rates. For firms with above-median values of each measure, however, both book and market leverage significantly decline following the adoption of this law.  \n\nThe second set of cross-sectional tests exploits the fact that WDLs apply to some workers but not others. WDLs do not typically apply to temporary workers and employees who are already covered by a collective bargaining agreement (e.g., Miles (2000), Autor (2003)). Thus, the adoption of the good faith exception should also have greater influence on the capital structures of firms operating in industries with a larger fraction of full-time or nonunionized workers.  \n\nI measure the fraction of full-time workers, who are employees that work at least 40 hours a week, for each three-digit NAICS industry, state, and year using data from the IPUMS-CPS database.28 I also use data from the IPUMS-CPS database to calculate the fraction of workers in each three-digit NAICS industry, state, and year that are nonunionized. I consider workers unionized if they are a member of a union or covered by a union but not a member. These data are available beginning in 1990. Thus, I create a single industry measure that is used for the entire sample period by averaging the fraction of nonunionized workers over the years 1990 to 1995. For both industry measures, I create an indicator variable that is set to one if its value is above the sample median and zero otherwise.  \n\nColumns 4 and 5 of Panels A and B show that the adoption of the good faith exception does not affect the leverage ratios of firms operating in industries with a below-median fraction of full-time or nonunionized workers. However, for firms with above-median values of each measure, both book and market leverage significantly decline following its adoption.  \n\nPanels C and D repeat the analysis in Panels A and B but include the interaction of state and year fixed effects in each model. These models therefore compare the effect of the adoption of the good faith exception across firms with different industry characteristics headquartered in the same state. Effectively, the inclusion of state $\\times$ year fixed effects removes all time-varying omitted variables that affect all firms within the same state during a given year by demeaning all variables by state each year. The results are similar to those found in the first two panels and therefore provide further assurance that the finding that the adoption of this law results in lower leverage is robust to controlling for omitted statelevel factors.  \n\n### D. Mechanisms of the Adoption of the Good Faith Exception  \n\nThe results so far are consistent with higher firing costs influencing capital structures by raising financial distress costs. While I am unable test how much of this effect is due to higher firing costs increasing a firm's financial losses after it becomes distressed, I next test whether higher firing costs increase the firm's risk of becoming distressed by increasing its operating leverage.  \n\n#### D.1. The Good Faith Exception, Operating Leverage, and Earnings Variability  \n\nA firm has greater operating leverage if, for a given percentage change in sales, it has a greater percentage change in earnings. To test whether operating leverage increases following the adoption of the good faith exception, I follow an approach similar to Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou (2013) and estimate the following panel regression model:  \n\n$$\n\\Delta\\log E_{i t}=a_{i}+a_{t}+\\beta_{1}\\Delta\\log S_{i t}+\\beta_{2}\\Delta\\log S\\times G F_{i t}+\\beta_{3}G F_{i t}+\\gamma X_{i t}+\\varepsilon_{i t}~,\n$$  \n\nwhere $E_{i t}$ is earnings before interest and taxes, $S_{i t}$ is firm sales, $G F_{i t}$ is an indicator variable set to one if the state has adopted the good faith exception as of year $t$ and zero otherwise, and $X_{i t}$ is the same set of control variables as used in the financial leverage regressions. Standard errors are clustered by state.  \n\nColumn 1 of Table X shows that the sensitivity of changes in earnings to changes in sales is significantly higher after the adoption of the good faith exception. The coefficient estimates imply that before the adoption of this law, a $1\\%$ decrease in sales is associated with a $1.37\\%$ decrease in earnings. Following its passage, however, a $1\\%$ decrease in sales is associated with a $1.58\\%$ decrease in earnings, for a relative increase of $15.4\\%$ $(=0.206/1.37)$ Column 2 shows that this result is robust to controlling for book leverage.  \n\nColumns 3 to 6 examine the effect of the adoption of the good faith exception on earnings variability. If higher firing costs increase operating leverage, earnings should be more volatile following its passage. Traditional measures of earnings variability, such as cash flow volatility, require using data over several consecutive years and thus have overlapping data. However, it is problematic to use such measures in the context of my difference-indifferences research design, which measures the average treatment effect from the adoption of this law over time. To overcome this challenge, I first investigate the effect of the adoption of the good faith exception on earnings persistence. This test is motivated by findings in Dichev and Tang (2009) and Frankel and Litov (2009) that firms with more volatile earnings also have less persistent earnings. Therefore, I expect earnings to be less persistent after the law's adoption. To test this prediction, I regress profitability in year $_{t+1}$ on the good faith dummy, contemporaneous profitability, the interaction of the good faith dummy and contemporaneous profitability, and the same set of control variables as used in the main leverage tests. Column 3 shows that after the adoption of this law, earnings are significantly less persistent. Column 4 shows that this finding is also robust to controlling for book leverage.  \n\nIn a second test, I examine how the passage of the good faith exception affects variation in year-over-year profitability. Similar to the motivation behind the earnings persistence test, if adoption of this law increases earnings variability, it should result in more variation in year-over-year earnings. Columns 5 and 6 support this prediction and show that after enactment of the law, the absolute value of one-year changes in profitability is significantly higher. Overall, the results in Table X are consistent with high firing costs increasing operating leverage.  \n\n#### D.2. The Good Faith Exception and Employment Decisions  \n\nI next conduct an indirect test of the operating leverage channel. If operating leverage increases because firms find it more difficult to adjust employment, then I should observe that after the adoption of the good faith exception, firms are less likely to downsize employment following negative cash flow shocks. I should also find lower overall fluctuations in employment.  \n\nTable XI presents the results. All dependent and independent variables (except the good faith indicator variable) are standardized to have a standard deviation of one to ease interpretation of coefficient estimates. In columns 1 and 2, I follow Hanka (1998) and define the dependent variable as the percentage decline in the number of firm employees over the previous year, with employment gains (positive percentage changes) set to zero.29 I capture declines in profitability as the change in profitability from year t-1 to $t$ .Again, increases in profitability are set to zero.  \n\nThe positive coefficient of 0.054 on the decline in profitability in column 1 suggests that, before the adoption of the good faith exception, if profitability declines by one standard deviation (about 9.3 percentage points), firms discharge 0.054 of a standard deviation of their workers(about $11.1\\%$ . The negative coefficient of -0.032 on the interaction of the good faith dummy and the decline in profitability suggests that adoption of this law more than halves this sensitivity (a $59.3\\%$ reduction $[=0.032/0.054])$ . Column 2 further controls for book leverage and the interaction of the good faith dummy and book leverage to examine how possible debt reductions affect this relation. The results remain unchanged.  \n\nIn columns 3 to 5, I follow Autor, Kerr, and Kugler (2007) and test the effect of the adoption of the good faith exception on net employment flows, which is the absolute value of the percentage change in the number of employees. Column 3 shows that employment flows decline by 0.064 standard deviations following the adoption of this law. The sensitivity of net employment flows to the absolute value of the change in profitability is also significantly lower following the adoption of this law (column 4), and this result holds after controlling for book leverage and the interaction of the good faith dummy and book leverage (column 5). Overall, the results in Table XI provide further evidence that is consistent with higher firing costs increasing operating leverage.  \n\n## V. Alternative Explanations  \n\nWhile my findings are consistent with higher firing costs affecting leverage via increasing financial distress costs, two alternative explanations are possible.  \n\nFirst, the passage of the good faith exception could reduce employment levels. Thus, firms may not need to borrow as much to fund labor expenses, which could also result in lower leverage ratios following the adoption of this law. To explore this possibility, I first check whether employment levels decline for my sample of firms. I regress the natural logarithm of the number of employees on the good faith dummy and the same set of control variables as used in column 5 of Table V. The results show a small decrease in employment ofabout $1\\%$ following the adoption of the good faith exception, but this decrease is not statistically significant( $p$ -value of about 0.50). Thus, this alternative explanation does appear to hold in my sample. As an additional robustness check, I rerun my main leverage tests and include the natural logarithm of the number of employees as a control variable. The results remain unchanged (see columns 1 to 3 of Table IAVI in the Internet Appendix).  \n\nSecond, it is possible that firms do not adjust leverage in response to the adoption of the good faith exception, but rather, that the observed decline in leverage is spurious in that it reflects other actions that firms take in response to higher firing costs. For example, firms could employ more temporary workers or shift from relatively more expensive labor inputs to less labor-intensive capital investments to reduce their exposure to litigation and employee firing costs (e.g., Autor (2003), Autor, Kerr, and Kugler (2007). While true, it is unlikely that these actions result in firms lowering leverage. Indeed, shifting to more flexible temporary workers and increasing capital-intensive assets would increase debt capacity and result in higher financial leverage ratios. Nonetheless, I estimate my main leverage regressions including a proxy for the fraction of a firm's workers who are full-time and the firm's laborto-asset ratio. The results continue to show that debt ratios decrease following the passage of the good faith exception (see columns 4 to 5 of Table IAVI in the Internet Appendix).  \n\n# VI. Conclusion  \n\nIn this paper, I study the relation between employee firing costs and capital structure decisions. To identify the causal effect of firing costs on capital structures, I exploit the adoption of the good faith exception by U.S. state courts. This exception protects workers from termination out of bad faith, malice, or retaliation and raises the costs associated with discharging workers. Using a difference-in-differences research design, I compare changes in the debt ratios of firms headquartered in states that adopt this law to changes in the debt ratios of firms headquartered in states that do not adopt it.  \n\nI document a significant decline in both book and market leverage ratios following the adoption of the good faith exception. Results of several robustness tests support a causal interpretation of this finding. I also find that the negative relation between the adoption of this law and financial leverage is stronger for firms operating in industries with a higher likelihood of discharging workers and for firms that employ a larger fraction of workers who are protected by this law.  \n\nThese findings are consistent with theories predicting that higher firing costs lower optimal financial leverage ratios by increasing a firm's financial losses in the event of distress and, by increasing operating leverage, the likelihood of becoming distressed. I provide evidence of this latter channel by showing that, following the adoption of this law, a firm's degree of operating leverage rises, earnings variability increases, and employment becomes more rigid. In sum, the results emphasize the interdependence of financial policies with labor market frictions and provide insights into how labor regulations and employee firing costs affect capital structure.  \n\n# Appendix A: Workforce Reductions and Wrongful Termination Lawsuits  \n\nWhile economically motivated layoffs typically do not give rise to wrongful termination claims. In Coelho v. Posi-Seal International, Inc., 208 Conn. 106, 544 A.2d 170, 544 A. 2 (1988) and Ewers v. Stroh Brewery Company, 178 Mich. App. 371, 443 N.W.2d 504 (1989), employees were discharged as part of layoffs that the employers claimed were economically motivated. However, the plaintiffs claimed the layoffs were an excuse. In PosiSeal, the plaintiff claimed he was discharged as a result of a dispute with a manager of a different division. In Ewers, the plaintiff challenged the economic necessity of the layoff, as there was evidence that Stroh was actually experiencing substantial economic growth and operating at a substantial profit before and after Ewer's discharge.  \n\nIn both cases, the defendants argued that termination due to a reduction in workforce is, as a matter of law, a just cause. The courts agreed with this premise. However, they concluded that an employer's claim that some employees were terminated as a result of a legitimate reduction in workforce does not necessarily establish that all employees were discharged for the same reason. Further, the courts noted that employers may not use a reduction in workforce as a pretext for discharges that would otherwise be subject to justcause attack by the employee. In these cases, the courts ruled in favor of the plaintiffs because the evidence indicated that the layoffs were used as a pretext to fire the employees.  \n\n# Appendix B: Employment Practices Liability Insurance  \n\nThe following discussion is based largely on Klenk (1999) and Daris and Gassman (2013). In deciding whether to offer EPLI and the premium to charge, insurers consider a number of factors including information on employee turnover and the frequency and dollar volume of prior claims. Insurers also consider the firm's employment practices, such as whether the firm has an employee manual, has someone dedicated to addressing employment-related issues, has a progressive discipline policy, and requires harassment training. Insurers may also require firms’ financial statements because their financial condition can be a predictor of future involuntary turnovers or layoffs.30  \n\nEPLI largely emerged in the 1990s due to an onslaught of employment litigation following the enactment of several federal and state laws that raised the cost and awareness of employee litigation, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1991, WDLs, the Federal Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Prior to the introduction of EPLI, firms tried to recover losses under traditional forms of insurance, including commercial general liability insurance and directors and officers liability insurance. However, insurers often denied coverage based on policy terms and conditions. Commercial general liability policies provide coverage for claims arising from accidents and contain provisions stating that accidents cannot be expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured, which essentially barred coverage for wrongful termination practices (Machson and Monteleone (1994).31 Further, insurers often modified these policies to exclude coverage for wrongful termination. Firms also had difficulty recovering claims under directors and officers liability insurance because employment claims are typically asserted against corporate entities and not individuals. Moreover, if individuals are sued, they are not typically directors or officers and therefore not covered.  \n\nEarly EPLI policies also had a number of problems. Firms and brokers contended that EPLI coverage was poor and pricing too high. Early EPLI policies often contained “intentional acts\" exclusions as well as exclusions related to downsizing, retaliation, and punitive damages, which rendered coverage for wrongful termination illusory at times. As a result of these issues, demand for these early policies was low. However, once the market developed and EPLI coverage expanded, demand increased. For instance, while $22\\%$ ofsurveyed employers had EPLI in 1997, 50 to $60\\%$ of surveyed employers carried EPLI in 2012.32  \n\n# Appendix C: Variable Definitions  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Appenar 101IS</td></tr><tr><td>Variable</td><td>Description (variable definitions in parentheses refer to Compustat designations where appropriate)</td></tr><tr><td>Assets</td><td>The value of total book assets (at) in millions.</td></tr><tr><td>Book Leverage</td><td>The book value of long-term debt (dltt) plus debt in current liabilities (d divided by book value of assets (at).</td></tr><tr><td>CircuitStates'Good Faith</td><td>The fraction of other states in the same federal circuit region as the firm headquarters state that have passed the good faith exception by year t.</td></tr><tr><td>Circuit States' Implied Contract</td><td>The fraction of other states in the same federal circuit region as the firm headquarters state that have passed the implied contract exception by year t.</td></tr><tr><td>Circuit States'Public Policy</td><td>The fraction of other states in the same federal circuit region as the firm headquarters state that have passed the public policy exception by year</td></tr><tr><td>Dividend Payer</td><td>An indicator variable set to one if a firm pays a common dividend (duc) during a fiscal year and zero otherwise.</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed Assets</td><td>The ratio of property, plant, and equipment (ppent) to book value of asse (at).</td></tr><tr><td>Full-Time</td><td>The fraction of workers in each three-digit NAICS industry, state, and year that work at least 40 hours per week.</td></tr><tr><td>Good Faith</td><td>An indicator variable set to one if the state in which a firm is headquartered has adopted the good faith exception by year t and zero otherwise.</td></tr><tr><td>Implied Contract</td><td>An indicator variable set to one if the state in which a firm is headquartered has adopted the implied contract exception by year t and zero otherwise.</td></tr><tr><td>Ind.

These dates are the dates when a good faith exception case is ruled on. The sample includes all firms headquartered in one of the adopting states over the 1967 to 1995 period that have nonmissing and positive book assets and sales. Financial and utility firms are excluded. Due to data availability, this sample is restricted to the following 12 adopting states: AZ, CA, CT, DE, ID, MA, MT, NH, NV, OK, UT, and WY. In columns 1 and 2, an observation is an equally weighted state-level portfolio. Cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) are calculated over the pre-event windows (trading days [-21,-4] and [- 3,-2]) and event window (trading days [-1,3]), where $\\scriptstyle t=0$ is the date the court adopts the good faith exception. In column 1, abnormal returns are calculated from the market model using CRSP equally weighted market returns. In column 2, abnormal returns are calculated from the three-factor model, in which firm returns are regressed on value-weighted market returns as well as the returns to zero-investment long-short portfolios formed from small cap stocks minus large cap stocks and high book-to-market stocks minus low book-to-market stocks. The parameters for the market and three-factor models are estimated over the [-280,-61] trading days relative to the announcement date. $t$ -statistics are reported in parentheses. \\*, \\*\\*, and $\\ast\\ast\\ast$ denote significance at the $10\\%$ $5\\%$ , and $1\\%$ level, respectively.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">Equally Weighted State-Level Portfolios (Obs. = 12)</td></tr><tr><td>MarketModelCARs (1)</td><td>3-FactorCARs (2)</td></tr><tr><td>CARWindow</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>[-21,-4]</td><td>-1.511%</td><td>-1.471%</td></tr><tr><td>[-3,-2]</td><td>(-1.52) -0.058%</td><td>(-1.74) -0.045%</td></tr><tr><td>[-1,3]</td><td>(-0.14) -1.045%** (-3.01)</td><td>(-0.12) -1.219%*** (-3.59)</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n# Table IV Summary Statistics  \n\nThis table reports summary statistics for the main variables in the regression models.

The treatment and control groups consist of firms headquartered in states that adopt and do not adopt the good faith exception, respectively. For the first match, I estimate propensity scores using Log Assets, Profitability, Fixed Assets, and Market-to-Book. For the second match, I also include Modified Z-Score as a regressor. For both matches, I match each treatment firm in year $t{-}1$ to a control firm (with replacement), matching on year, three-digit SIC industry, and closest propensity score (with a max difference between propensity scores of 0.01). For the second match, I also match on Divided Payer. When treatment firms have multiple control firm matches, I retain the control firm with the closest propensity score. Panel A tabulates the means of the matched variables and propensity scores for the treatment and control groups in year t-1 (the control variables are not statistically different across groups at the $10\\%$ significance level). Panel B presents the results examining the impact of the adoption of the good faith exception on firms' leverage in columns 1 to 4. Treatment is an indicator variable set to one if the firm is headquartered in a state that adopts this law. Post is an indicator variable set to one in the five years after the adoption of this law (same for matched control firms). I exclude the year in which a state adopts this law from the regressions. Control variables in Panel B include Implied Contract, Public Policy, Log Assets, Market-to-Book, Profitability, Fixed Assets, Dividend Payer, Modified Z-Score, Log(State Per Capita GDP), Circuit States' Good Faith, State GDP Growth, and Political Balance. Appendix C provides variable definitions.

The dependent variables in columns 1 to 5 are as follows: $L o g({\\cal{I}}{+}T o t a l{\\cal{D}}e b t)$ is the natural logarithm of one plus the book value of longterm debt plus debt in current liabilities and is expressed in 2009 dollars; Net Book (Market) Leverage is the book value of long-term debt plus debt in current liabilities less the book value of cash and short-term investments divided by the book value of assets (market value of debt and equity); Book (Market) Leverage with Leases is the book value of long-term debt plus debt in current liabilities plus the value of leases (xrent\\* 10) divided by the book value of assets plus the value of leases (market value of debt and equity plus the value of leases). In columns 4 and 5, all control variables are adjusted to account for the value of leases by adding the value of leases to the book value of debt and/or assets. The value of leases is obtained by capitalizing annual rental expenses at a $10\\%$ discount rate. Good Faith is an indicator variable set to one if the state in which a firm is headquartered has adopted the good faith exception by year $t$ and zero otherwise. The control variables include Implied Contract, Public Policy, Log Assets, Market-to-Book, Profitability, Fixed Assets, Diuidend Payer, Modified Z-Score, Log(State Per Capita GDP), Circuit States' Good Faith, State GDP Growth, and Political Balance.

The dependent variable in Panels A and C is Book Leverage, and the dependent variable in Panels B and D is Market Leverage. Good Faith is an indicator variable set to one if the state in which a firm is headquartered has adopted the good faith exception by year $t$ and zero otherwise. For the continuous measures Ind. Volatility, Sep. Rate, Sep. Rate BLS, Full-Time, and Non-Union, I create an indicator variable $(H i g h)$ that is set to one if the value of the particular measure is above the sample median and zero otherwise. Each regression includes the interaction term and the main effect of each crosssection, but these variables are not tabulated for brevity. The control variables in Panels A and B include Implied Contract, Public Policy, Log Assets, Market-to-Book, Profitability, Fixed Assets, Dividend Payer, Modified Z-Score, Log(State Per Capita GDP), Circuit States' Good Faith, State GDP Growth, and Political Balance. The control variables used in Panels C and D are the same as those used in Panels A and B. However, because the models in Panels C and D include state $\\times$ year fixed effects, these models exclude state-level variables (i.e., Good Faith, Log(State Per Capita GDP), Circuit States' Good Faith, State GDP Growth, and Political Balance). Appendix C provides variable definitions. Continuous variables are winsorized at their $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$ and $99^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentiles, and dollar values are expressed in 2009 dollars.

regressions relating financial leverage to the enactment of the good faith exception for Compustat industrial firms from 1967 to 1995. The dependent variables in Panels A and B are Book Leverage and Market Leverage, respectively. Good Faith is an indicator variable set to one if the state in which a firm is headquartered has adopted the good faith exception by year $t$ and zero otherwise. Column 1 includes the interactions of two-digit SIC industry and year fixed effects. Column 2 includes the interactions of Log Assets and two-digit SIC industry fixed effects. Column 3 controls for Sales-Weighted State Book (Market) Leverage, which is the sales-based weighted average book (market) leverage of all other companies in a firm's headquarters state (with the firm excluded from the calculation). The control variables include Implied Contract, Public Policy, Log Assets, Market-to-Book, Profitability, Fixed Assets, Diuidend Payer, Modified Z-Score, Log(State Per Capita GDP), Circuit States' Good Faith, State GDP Growth, and Political Balance. Appendix C provides variable definitions. Continuous variables are winsorized at their $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$ and $99^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentiles, and dollar values are expressed in 2009 dollars.

The dependent variable is either Book Leverage or Market Leverage. Panel A presents results using alternative sample periods. Columns 1 and 2 of Panel A use the period 1967 to 2003. Columns 3 and 4 use the period 1978 to 1999. Good Faith is an indicator variable set to one if the state in which a firm is headquartered has adopted the good faith exception by year t and zero otherwise. Panel B presents results using alternative dating schemes for the enactment of WDLs. In columns 1 to 3 and 4 to 6 of Panels B and C, Good Faith, Implied Contract, and Public Policy are defined using the precedent-setting cases identified in Autor, Donohue, and Schwab (2006), Dertouzos and Karoly (1992), and Morriss (1995), respectively. Panel B uses the full sample from 1967 to 1995, and Panel C restricts the sample to the years 1967 to 1991. Because Dertouzos and Karoly (1992) and Morriss (1995) are earlier studies, they do not code Delaware as adopting the good faith and implied contact exceptions in 1992 or Wyoming as enacting the good faith exception in 1994. To account for this issue, in Panel B I assume that these two studies would have coded these three events using the same precedent-setting court cases and dates as Autor, Donohue, and Schwab (2006). Panel C ends the sample in 1991 so that these three events do not enter the sample period. The control variables in all model specifications include Implied Contract, Public Policy, Log Assets, Market-to-Book, Profitability, Fixed Assets, Dividend Payer, Modified Z-Score, Log(State Per Capita GDP), Circuit States' Good Faith, State GDP Growth, and Political Balance.

Variable definitions refer to Compustat designations where appropriate. The dependent variables in columns 1 to 4 and 5 to 8 are Book Leuerage and Market Leverage, respectively. Good Faith is an indicator variable set to one if the state in which a firm is headquartered has adopted the good faith exception by year t and zero otherwise. Columns 1 and 5 exclude all observations when a firm reports nonmissing and nonzero foreign income (pifo) or foreign taxes $(t x f o)$ . Columns 2 and 6 exclude all observations in which a firm is in a geographically dispersed industry. Dispersed industries include retail, wholesale, and transportation. Columns 3 and 7 exclude all observations for firms that have moved their headquarters locations to different states over the 1992 to 2011 period. To identify firms that switch headquarters, I use the programming language PHP and collect each firm's state of headquarters from their 10-K filings over the 1992 to 2011 period when available. Columns 4 and 8 exclude the same observations as in columns 3 and 7 and also exclude all observations for firms that have ever had a one-year increase in total assets (at) or total sales (sale) exceeding $100\\%$ in the years when I do not have headquarters data from 10-K filings.

Variable definitions refer to Compustat designations where appropriate. The dependent variables in columns 1 to 5 are as follows: Log(# of Employees) is the natural logarithm of the number of employees (emp); Book Leverage is the book value of long-term debt plus debt in current liabilities divided by book value of assets; and Market Leverage is the book value of long-term debt plus debt in current liabilities divided by market value of assets. Good Faith is an indicator variable set to one if the state in which a firm is headquartered has adopted the good faith exception by year $t$ and zero otherwise. Labor-to-Capital is the number of employees (emp) to the real book value (2009 dollars) of property, plant, and equipment (ppent). Full-Time Workers is the fraction of workers in each three-digit NAICS industry, state, and year that work at least 40 hours per week. Appendix C provides variable definitions.

In this paper, we study the impact of dialect diversity on the labor income share in China. We find that regional dialect diversity depresses the labor income share in manufacturing firms in China.

We explore the transmission channels underlying this negative relationship and find that dialect diversity depresses the labor income share by decreasing worker bargaining power, and this channel can be further explained by the depressing effect of dialect diversity on the participation of firms in export trade and regional human capital accumulation. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the negative effect of dialect diversity on the labor share is weak or insignificant in sectors with strong worker bargaining power such as state-owned enterprises, labor-intensive enterprises, and high-skill-intensive enterprises.  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nWhile cultural diversity leads to creativity and knowledge spillovers, the negative effects on communication and integration costs may outweigh the positive effects in a culturally diverse environment (Parrotta et al., 2012). Language, as a prominent cultural characteristic of a region, has a lasting and extensive impact on economic performance. The communication function of language can reach an ideal state when a group has a consistent linguistic system and then can be beneficial to bilateral trade (Isphording and Otten, 2013; Melitz and Toubal, 2014) or migration (Adsera and Pytlikova, 2016). However, when there exists a heterogeneous linguistic system in a group, communication costs could depress workers' wage (Pendakur and Pendakur, 2002) or firms' productivity (Parrotta et al., 2014; Dale-Olsen and Finseraas, 2020).  \n\nIn China, people recognized the existence and influence of language differences as early as the Western Han Dynasty. It is recorded in section Royal Regulations of the Book of Rites, “the people of the different regions have different phonologies and different desires\". Even in ancient China with underdeveloped transportation and less cross-regional communication, the impact of different languages on life has been deeply rooted in people's minds. Although China began to unify written characters as early as the Qin Empire period, due to the differences in the literary and colloquial systems in different regions, the disunity between written characters and language makes it difficult for languages to converge in form and function (Zhou and You, 2015). Considering that ancient Chinese characters are the exclusive skills of senior intellectuals, the unification of written characters can play a very limited role in the unification of spoken Chinese system. There are two main reasons for the formation of dialect diversity in China. The first is geographical separation, which leads to different regions having their own phonetic systems. The other is the language integration caused by several large-scale population migrations in history. According to the Chinese Dialects Dictionary (Xu and Miyata, 1999), there are 105 types of dialects, which can be classified into 20 groups and 10 super-groups, leading to the dialect diversity in China.  \n\nWhile there has been an extensive movement for the promotion of Standard Chinese, the local dialect is more often used in daily conversation within the local area. It has been found that China's economic performance and labor market are affected by dialect diversity, either positively or negatively. For example, dialect diversity can be beneficial to enterprise innovation (Pan et al., 2017) and regional economic growth (Zhu and Grigoriadis, 2022), but increase the psychological distance between people speaking different dialects (Zhang and Xu, 2022). The psychological distance caused by dialects influences labor mobility and wages of migrants. Labor mobility tends to happen within the same dialect group and is less likely to occur across the dialect super-group (Liu et al., 2015), and the wages of migrants are depressed in a region with diverse dialects (Ma and Zhao, 2019). In addition, dialect diversity depresses foreign trade because it impedes the market scale (Jiang et al., 2019).  \n\nThe influence of dialect diversity on labor market and economic performance indicates that it may affect an economic variable of wide concern: the labor share of income, or simply the labor share. Kaldor (1961) argues that one of the stylized facts of economic growth is a constant labor share, but the global decline in the labor share over the past few decades clearly violates this conclusion (Karabarbounis and Neiman, 2014). Studies have focused on the impact of technical change (Acemoglu, 2003; Bassanini and Manfredi, 2014; Karabarbounis and Neiman, 2014), capital intensity (Bentolila and Saint-Paul, 2003), globalization (Elsby et al., 2013; Jayadev, 2007; Perugini et al., 2017), increased product market power (Kehrig and Vincent, 2021), and the market power of workers (Checchi and Garcia-Penalosa, 2010; Damiani et al., 2021; Deakin et al., 2014; Guschanski and Onaran, 2022) on the labor share?. Until now, however, no study has focused on cultural factors. Culture has a profound influence on the economy, and it plays a more significant role in contemporary society with more frequent and complicated economic activities. As a prominent cultural characteristic of a region, dialect diversity may influence the labor share by depressing wages.  \n\nThe share of labor income in China is $6{-}7\\%$ lower than that in developed countries, such as France and England, and has experienced a decline (Liu and Bai, 2022). In this paper, we study the effect of dialect diversity on the labor share in China. Based on firm-level data from China's manufacturing sector, we find that dialect diversity is negatively related to labor share. We examine the transmission channels behind this relationship from the perspective of worker bargaining power. First, as there is only one official language (Standard Chinese) in China, communication can be achieved smoothly in the workplace and workplace productivity is less affected by dialect diversity. However, the local dialect is often used in daily conversation within the local area, and dialect is a channel through which people expose their identity (Chen et al., 2014). Social trust is depressed in a region with diverse dialects because of the widened psychological distance (Zhang and Xu, 2022). It is difficult for migrants to integrate themselves into local society in a social environment with low social trust (Chen et al., 2014), which leads to lower bargaining power and lower wages (Ma and Zhao, 2019). Second, most export enterprises in China were labor-intensive during the 2000s and increased the worker bargaining power (Sheng and Lu, 2016; Xie et al., 2019). Studies have found that dialect diversity depresses the regional foreign trade (Jiang et al., 2019; Li et al., 2017) and consequently decreases worker bargaining power, which may lead to a lower labor share. Third, as workers with higher human capital have higher bargaining power, dialect diversity may depress the human capital accumulation and thus the labor share. Specifically speaking, dialect inhibits students' English learning ability because of the contradiction of the local dialect's phonetic system with English pronunciation (Fan and Wang, 2013; Jiang, 2010). One of the main reasons for students to drop out of school is the learning weariness caused by a poor performance learning English (Shu, 2002; Su and Ding, 2007). For these reasons, dialect diversity may inhibit regional human capital accumulation and results in lower worker bargaining power, and consequently a lower labor share.  \n\nMost existing studies focused on the market structure and institutions to analyse the relationship between worker power and the labor share. For example, Deakin et al. (2014) find labor laws for worker protection are positively correlated with the labor share of national income. Damiani et al. (2021) find that legislative innovations that favor the extensive use of temporary contracts negatively affect the labor share. Guschanski and Onaran (2022) find that the fallin labor's bargaining power due to the decline in union density and social government expenditure leads to a declining labor share in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. In this paper, we focus on the effect of a non-institutional factor, namely culture represented by dialect diversity, on the labor share from the perspective of worker power.  \n\nIn this paper, dialect diversity refers to the diversity of local varieties of Chinese, while linguistic diversity or language diversity in previous studies refers to the diversity of different languages (Dale-Olsen and Finseraas, 2020). While a dialect is a local variety of Chinese, local varieties from different areas of China are often mutually unintelligible. For example, in Fujian provinces, the dialect of neighboring counties or even villages may be mutually unintelligible (Norman, 1988). Thus, our study provides reference for other multilingual and multicultural countries regarding the role of language in the labor share. In addition, as local dialects are valued as symbols of regional culture (Chen, 1999), our study enriches existing research relevant to cultural economics.  \n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the empirical strategy and description of the data. Section 3 presents the empirical results. In Section 3, we present the results of the baseline regression and discuss the omitted variable and endogeneity issues. Section 4 discusses the transmission channels underlying the negative relationship between dialect diversity and labor share. Section 5 discusses the heterogeneous effects of dialect diversity on the labor share across different types of enterprises. Section 6 concludes.  \n\n## 2. Empirical strategy and variables description  \n\n### 2.1. Empirical strategy  \n\nThe effect of dialect diversity on labor share can be examined by estimating the following regression model:  \n\n$$\nl s_{i t}=\\alpha+\\beta d i a_{i}+\\psi X_{i t}+\\xi_{t}+\\vartheta_{j}+\\varsigma_{s}+\\varepsilon_{i t}\n$$  \n\nwhere $l s_{i t}$ is the labor share in firm i at time $t$ $d i a_{i}$ is the dialect diversity index of the prefecture-level city where the $\\mathrm{firm}i$ is located; $X_{i t}$ denotes other control variables at the firm-level and city-level; and $\\xi_{t},\\:\\mathfrak{g}_{j}$ and $\\varsigma_{s}$ are the province fixed effect, year fixed effect, industrial sector (2-digit classification) fixed effect, respectively. Firm fixed effect is not included because the dialect diversity index (as we will show in Section 2.2.2) is time invariant for each firm. $\\varepsilon_{i t}$ is the error term.  \n\n### 2.2.Data  \n\nThe data we use in the baseline regression model include firm-level variables, city-level variables, and the diversity indexes of the prefecture-level city. The firm-level data are from the Industrial Enterprise Database (IED), which is the product of annual surveys conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics of China. We exclude the firms in IED with missing values and abnormal values. Specifically, firms with missing values of sales, number of employees, total assets or net fixed assets are excluded. Firms with fewer than 8 employees, total assets less than current assets, total assets less than net fixed assets, and accumulated depreciation less than current depreciation are excluded. The dialect diversity index of the prefecture-level city is from Xu et al. (2015). City-level data are from the China City Statistical Yearbook.  \n\n#### 2.2.1. Labor share  \n\nLabor share of each firm is defined as the compensation of employees as a share of value added. There are different methods for the measurement of value added. Given the availability of data, the following two measures are used in this paper. The first one measures value added using the income approach, and the labor share can be calculated as:  \n\n![](images/2e7126fc70ee759be2ab3284db431b20a9e0005d1c990e806010812f85a3d3f2.jpg)  \nFig. 1. Chinese dialect families. Source: Xu and Miyata (1999), Liu et al. (2020).  \n\nwhere the production taxes include the VAT and tax and extra charges of the main business. The second approach is based on the definition of value added at factor cost and the labor share is calculated as:  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">LS_2=</td><td colspan=\"4\">compensation of</td><td colspan=\"4\">Employees</td></tr><tr><td>operating</td><td>revenue-operating</td><td>cost+compensation</td><td>of</td><td>employees+depreciation</td><td>offixed</td><td></td><td>assets</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nFig. 1 shows the trend of the average labor income share in manufacturing firms from 1998 to 2007 and $2011-2013^{3}$ under different measurement approaches. The labor share calculated based on the national account is also included in Fig. 2 for comparison. The average labor share at firm level is lower than that calculated from the national accounts. This is because labor compensation measured at the firm level includes only wages, while labor compensation in national accounts includes wages and a broader set of benefits paid to labor. LS_1 is much closer to the labor share calculated based on the national account; thus, our analysis focuses on the labor share in manufacturing enterprises measured by LS_1, and LS_2 serves as a robustness check.  \n\n#### 2.2.2. Indexes of dialect diversity  \n\nThe indexes of dialect diversity are obtained from Xu et al. (2015). Based on the Chinese dialect dictionary, which records the Chinese dialects used in each county, Xu et al. (2015) construct the absolute index $d i\\nu_{n}$ and the relative index $d i\\nu_{p}$ for the mea$\\begin{array}{r}{d i\\nu\\_p_{i}=1-\\sum_{j=1}^{N}S_{j i}^{2};}\\end{array}$ ferent dialects within a prefecture-level city. $N$ represents the total number of dialects in the city and $S_{j i}$ represents the percentage of people in city i who speak dialect $j$ . Xu et al. (2015) calculated $S_{j i}$ based on 5th national census in 2000. $d i\\nu_{p}$ ranges from 0 to 1, and the larger the value is, the higher the degree of dialect diversity. Compared to the absolute index, the relative index can reflect the effect of the regional population distribution on dialect diversity. It is worth noting here that both the absolute index and the relative index do not change in the sample period because the dialect each county used and the $S_{j i}$ Xu et al. (2015) used are both crosssectional data.  \n\n#### 2.2.3.Control variables  \n\nThe control variables include firm-level variables and city-level variables. Since technological progress and capital deepening are important factors affecting the labor income share (Acemoglu, 2003; Bentolila and Saint-Paul, 2003), total factor productivity $(t f p)$ and the capital-output ratio (capital-output ratio) are included as control variables. The total factor productivity of each firm in each sector is calculated using the OP method (Olley and Pakes, 1996) following Yang's (2015) procedure. The capital-output ratio is measured by a firm's book value of total stock of fixed assets over output. Other control variables at the firm-level include firm's age (age); firm financial situation (asset-liability ratio), which is measured using the ratio of asset over liability; firm size (size), which is the natural logarithm of total assets; firm's profit rate (profit rate), which is measured by the ratio of net profit over sales; and the logarithm of government subsidy (subsidy). Dummy variables are included to indicate whether the firm is state-owned (state-owned) or an export enterprise (export). The logarithm of the average wage (city wage), the logarithm of GDP in each prefecture-level city (GDP), and the proportion of the manufacturing sector in GDP (industry structure) are the city-level control variables.  \n\nWe trim the top and bottom $1\\%$ of the firm-level variables to eliminate outliers. After data cleaning, our sample covers 478,463 firms distributed in 221 prefecture-level cities and 29 provinces. Table 1 gives the descriptive statistics of the sample and also lists variables used in latersections.  \n\n## 3. Empirical results  \n\nWe start with the baseline regression results and then discuss the issues of omitted variables and endogeneity.  \n\n### 3.1. Baseline results  \n\nTable 2 presents the estimation results of the baseline model. In all regressions, we control for the year, sector, and province fixed effects. The standard errors are clustered at the city-sector level.  \n\nIn column (1) and column (4) of Table 2, we include only the variable of the index of dialect diversity, and the results show a negative and significant relationship between dialect diversity and labor share. In columns (2) and (5) firm-level control variables are included. In columns (3) and (6) city-level control variables are included. The negative relationship between dialect diversity and labor share remains significant.  \n\nFrom columns (3) and (6) of Table 2, we find that the labor income share of enterprises decreases by $2.57\\%$ $3.12\\%$ foreach unit increase in the relative (absolute) diversity of dialects. In terms of the control variables, both total factor productivity and the capitaloutput ratio have significant negative effects on the labor share. As Bentolila and Saint-Paul (2003) proposed, the impact of capitalaugmenting technological progress could be captured by a measure of TFP; then, the negative coefficient means that technological developments increasing capital augmentation have a negative impact on the labor share. The negative relationship between the capital-output ratio and labor share also indicates a negative effect of capital augmentation on the labor share. Firm size and firm profit margin are negatively related to the labor share, which is consistent with the conclusion that the emergence of superstar firms that have increasing revenues but stable labor costs leads to a low labor share (Autor et al., 2020). Workers in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in China have higher bargaining power because union and collective contracts are more effective in SOEs (Yao and Zhong, 2013; Feng and Guo, 2021). The estimation results in Table 2 show that the labor share in SOEs is higher than that in non-SOEs. Finally, consistent with Weng and Zhou (2010), export firms have a higher labor income share because most export enterprises were labor-intensive during the 2000s and this contributes to the increased bargaining power of workers (Sheng and Lu, 2016; Xie et al., 2019). For the city-level controls, we find that the average wage and GDP in the city are positively related to the labor share. A higher share of the manufacturing sector is negatively correlated with labor share, which means that the labor share is relatively low in the capital-intensiveeconomy.  \n\n![](images/6ed755fcc6adf214c8bf018538c9c8d16890c5b34a4d70fedc5561019d14a917.jpg)  \nFig. 2.

Robustness test  \n\n#### 3.2.1.Alternative measure of the labor share  \n\nIn this section, we use LS_2 measured based on the definition of value added at factor cost to examine the effect of dialect diversity on the labor share as a robustness test. The estimation results in Table 3 show that the negative relationship remains significant4.  \n\n#### 3.2.2.Omitted variables  \n\nAs we discussed in the previous section, geographical separation is an important reason for the formation of dialects. In addition, geographical conditions could affect firm behavior. For example, in coastal cities and open cities, enterprises are more likely to engage in export trade, and the interaction with outsiders is more frequent in coastal and open cities. Language integration is more likely to occur in these cities, which changes the pattern of dialect diversity. In contrast, if interaction with outsiders is depressed, then there will be decreased engagement of enterprises in export trade, and the pattern of dialect diversity is expected to be more stable. Considering the concerns above, we add the average slope within a city (slope), which is calculated based on the ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model vo03 and dummy variables to the regression model to indicate whether the enterprise is located in a coastal city (coastal) or an open city (open). The estimation results listed in Table 4 show that there is no significant change in the effect of dialect diversity on the labor share.  \n\nOne may question whether dialect diversity fully represents cultural diversity. In other words, other cultural factors may influence both dialect diversity and the labor share. Regarding this consideration, we introduce the minority proportion in a prefectural-level city and the proportion of migrants in a prefectural-level city to the regression model. Ethnic minorities differ from the Han in terms of culture and language, and some minorities have their own written and spoken languages. Regions with larger ethnic minority populations may have a higher degree of cultural and dialect diversity. In addition, migration enriches local culture, while the language integration caused by several large-scale population migrations is one of the main reasons for the formation of dialect diversity. We include the proportion of minorities and migrants in the Ming and Qing dynasties in prefectural level cities to the regression model to address the above concerns. The proportion of ethnic minorities in each prefecture-level city comes from the fifth population census, and the data on the proportion of immigrants in the Ming and Qing dynasties are from Ge (2022), who recorded the proportion of immigrants in the Ming and Qing dynasties in 91 prefecture-level cities. The estimation results in Table 4 show that the negative relationship between dialect diversity and the labor share remains significant. Migrants in history do not show a significant effect. The minority proportion in a prefectural-level city has a significant effect, but the effect is too small to account for the change in labor share.  \n\n#### 3.2.3. Endogeneity  \n\nAlthough we consider the issue of omitted variables, the baseline results may suffer from endogeneity problems because other possible omitted variables may be correlated with both the firm labor share and the city-level dialect diversity. In this section, we use the number of rivers in a prefectural city (rivers) as an instrumental variable to address the endogeneity problem.  \n\nAs an old Chinese saying goes, there are different accents on opposite banks of a river, which means that the geographical barrier caused by a river restricted communication between residents on each side of the river in ancient time, resulting in different accents. The more rivers in a region, the more economic zones are divided by rivers in that region, and the more accents emerge because of the geographical isolation, leading to dialect diversity. In addition, with the development of modern transportation systems, rivers barely affect the share of labor income, which meets the exclusion restriction.  \n\nThe descriptive statistics of number of rivers in a prefectural city (rivers) are listed in Table 1. The estimation results using the number of rivers as an instrumental variable are presented in Table 5. The first-stage estimation results show that the number of rivers within a prefecture-level city is significantly and positively correlated with dialect diversity, which means that the number of rivers is particularly effective for predicting the dialect diversity in a region. The $F$ statistic indicates that our instruments are valid. The second-stage estimation results show that dialect diversity still has a significant negative effect on the labor income share, and the impact of dialect diversity on labor share is found to be larger in the second-stage results. This may be because the use of instrumental variables helps to eliminate the effects of omitted variables that produce a downward bias in the baseline regression.  \n\nThe exclusion restrictions may not be fully guaranteed because we cannot fully confirm that the number of rivers does not affect the labor share through other channels. Therefore, following Conley et al. (2012), IV estimation is performed again assuming that the instruments are only plausibly exogenous. Table 6 gives the results based on the local near zero method (LTZ) proposed by Conley et al. (2012). The results show that dialect diversity still has a significant negative effect on the labor share.  \n\n## 4. Transmission channel analysis  \n\nIn this section, we analyze the mechanism underlying the negative relationship between dialect diversity and labor share from the perspective of bargaining power.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"4\">3 LS_1 E -0.0291*** LS_1 LS_1 -0.0259*** 3</td><td>-0.0057** (0.003)</td><td></td><td>441,315 0.0001 (0.000) 0.1605 (0.099) YES YES YES YES</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">-0.0340*** (0.007) -0.0114*** (0.002)</td><td></td><td>0.2494** 0.0000 (0.000) (0.104) YES YES</td></tr><tr><td>***2000'0</td><td>0.4406*** (0.000) (0.066) YES YES YES</td></tr><tr><td>0.0008***</td><td>0.4099*** (0.000) (0.067) YES YES YES YES</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"4\">LS_1 LS_1 5</td><td>-0.0111*** (0.002)</td><td>0.0051 (0.004)</td><td>0.4398*** 1599,202 (0.067) 0.398 YES YES YES YES</td></tr><tr><td>-0.0254*** (0.009)</td><td>0.0052 (0.004)</td><td>0.4055*** 1599,202 (0.067) YES YES YES YES</td></tr><tr><td>-0.0112*** (0.002)</td><td>0.0014 (0.004)</td><td>0.4347*** 1599,202 (0.067) YES YES YES YES</td></tr><tr><td>(0.009) 0.0019</td><td>(0.004)</td><td>0.4001*** 1599,202 (0.067) 0.397 YES YES YES YES</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">LS_1 ②</td><td>-0.0106*** (0.002) -0.0004</td><td>(000'0)</td><td>0.4307*** (0.066) YES</td><td>1599,202 0.398 YES YES YES</td></tr><tr><td>-0.0236*** (0.009) -0.0006</td><td>(0.000)</td><td>0.3963*** (0.067)</td><td>1599,202 0.397 YES YES YES YES</td></tr><tr><td>dA!P UA!P slope</td><td>coastal open</td><td>Constant minority migrant</td><td>Industry FE Observations Province FE R-squared Controls Year FE</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nAruo G 100  \n\nTable5 IV estimation: 2SLS estimation results.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"4\">Second-stage estimation</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">LS_1</td><td colspan=\"2\">LS_2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td>div_p</td><td>-0.3002***</td><td></td><td>-0.2187*** (0.024)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>div_n</td><td>(0.029)</td><td>-0.0269***</td><td></td><td>-0.0196***</td></tr><tr><td>Controls</td><td></td><td>(0.003)</td><td></td><td>(0.002)</td></tr><tr><td>N</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1599,202</td><td>1599,202</td><td>1599,202</td><td>1599,202</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.356</td><td>0.396</td><td>0.263</td><td>0.298</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>First-stage estimation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>div_p</td><td>div_n</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>rivers</td><td>0.0014***</td><td>0.0162***</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.000)</td><td>(0.000)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Controls</td><td></td><td>Yes</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>N</td><td>Yes 1599,202</td><td>1599,202</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>F</td><td></td><td>17624</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>11386</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.366</td><td>0.472</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Robust standard errors in parentheses. $\\mathtt{s}\\mathbin{\\vrule w\\vrule w\\vrule w\\vrule w\\vrule w}<0.01,\\mathtt{s}\\mathbin{\\vrule w\\vrule w\\vrule w}<0.1$  \n\nTable6 IV estimation assuming the instruments are only plausibly exogenous.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>LS_1</td><td>LS_2</td></tr><tr><td>div_p</td><td>-0.4281***</td><td>-0.2566**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.143)</td><td>(0.127)</td></tr><tr><td>div_n</td><td>-0.062</td><td>-0.0477***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.011)</td><td>(0.011)</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Robust standard errors in parentheses. $\\iint\\mathrm{~\\boldmath~\\vec{~}{~p~}~}<\\mathrm{~\\boldmath~0.~}01$ $\\tilde{\\mathbf{\\eta}}\\rightleftarrows\\mathbf{\\eta}_{\\mathbf{p}}<\\mathbf{\\eta}_{0.05}$ $\\mathfrak{R}\\mathfrak{p}<0.1$  \n\n### 4.1. Transmission channel: Dialect diversity and bargaining powe  \n\nAs mentioned in Section 1, as there is only one official language (Standard Chinese) in China, communication can be achieved smoothly in the workplace and productivity is less affected by dialect diversity. However, the local dialect is often used in daily conversation within the local area, and dialect is a channel through which people expose their identity. Social trust is depressed in a region with diverse dialects because of the widened psychological distance (Zhang and Xu, 2022). It is difficult for migrants to integrate into the local society in a social environment with low social trust, which grants them lower bargaining power in the labor market and lower wages (Ma and Zhao, 2019). In this regard, labor share is depressed in a city in which various dialects are used due to the lower worker bargaining power. To confirm the channels above, we estimate the effect of dialect diversity on bargaining power. Following Xie et al. (2019), we measure worker bargaining power at the firm level. The descriptive statistics of labor bargaining power (bargaining) are presented in Table 1.  \n\nTable7 Transmission channel: Bargaining power.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1) bargaining</td><td>(2) bargaining</td></tr><tr><td>div_p</td><td>-0.0552*</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>div_n</td><td>(0.031)</td><td>-0.0231***</td></tr><tr><td>Constant</td><td>0.9718***</td><td>(0.009) 0.9985***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.027)</td><td>(0.030)</td></tr><tr><td>Controls Year FE</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Province FE</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Industry FE Observations</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>1599,202</td><td>1599,202</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.615</td><td>0.615</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Robust standard errors in parentheses. $\\stackrel{***}{\\mathtt{p}}\\mathtt{<}0.01$ ， $\\ddot{\\mathrm{~\\scriptsize~\\cdot~}}\\ddot{\\mathrm{~\\scriptsize~p~}}<0.05$ ,\\*p< 0.1  \n\nTable8 Transmission channel: Export trade.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1) export</td><td>(2) export</td></tr><tr><td>div_p</td><td>-0.2963***</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>div_n</td><td>(0.081)</td><td>-0.0886***</td></tr><tr><td>tfp</td><td>0.1511***</td><td>(0.021) 0.1520***</td></tr><tr><td>age</td><td>(0.020) -0.0036***</td><td>(0.020) -0.0036***</td></tr><tr><td>subsidy</td><td>(0.000) 0.0250***</td><td>(0.000) 0.0250***</td></tr><tr><td>size</td><td>(0.003) 0.3078***</td><td>(0.003) 0.3080***</td></tr><tr><td>Constant</td><td>(0.006) -3.4614***</td><td>(0.006)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.102)</td><td>-3.3805*** (0.105)</td></tr><tr><td>Year FE Province FE</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Industry FE</td><td>YES YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>1599,202</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Pseudo R2</td><td></td><td>1599,202</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.1515</td><td>0.1514</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Robust standard errors in parentheses. $\\mathtt{p}<0.01,\\mathtt{**p}<0.05,\\mathtt{*p}<0.1$  \n\nTo estimate the effects of dialect diversity on labor bargaining power, the following regression model is estimated:  \n\n$$\nb a r g a i n i n g_{i t}=\\alpha+\\beta d i a_{i}+\\psi X_{i t}+\\xi_{t}+\\vartheta_{j}+\\varsigma_{s}+\\varepsilon_{i t}\n$$  \n\nwherebargaini $n g_{i t}$ is the worker bargaining power in firm i at time $t$ , and the other variables are the same as those in Eq. (1). The estimation results in Table 7 show that dialect diversity has a significant negative effect on worker bargaining power. Since worker bargaining power is positively related to the labor share, we can conclude that dialect diversity depresses the labor share through workerbargainingpower.  \n\n### 4.2. Further analysis of the transmission channel  \n\nIn this section, we further examine the effects of dialect diversity on enterprises' export participation and regional human capital accumulation to provide a more detailed investigation of the mechanism underlying the negative relationship between dialect diversity and the labor share.  \n\n#### 4.2.1. Dialect diversity and foreign trade  \n\nMost export enterprises in China were labor intensive during the 2000s and increased workers' bargaining power (Sheng and Lu, 2016; Xie et al., 2019), which means that export enterprises should have a higher labor share, on average. The results in Table 3 confirm that export enterprises have a higher labor share. Since studies have found that dialect diversity depresses regional foreign trade (Jiang et al., 2019; Li et al., 2017), it consequently decreases workers? bargaining power. Thus, dialect diversity may have an impact on the labor share by inhibiting firms export trade. In this section, we estimate the effect of dialect diversity on the extensive margin of firms′ export trade. The extensive margin is denoted by whether firms participate in export trade. The following probit model is used for estimation:  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Pr}(e x p o r t_{i t}=1)=\\alpha+\\beta d i a_{i}+\\psi X_{i t}+\\xi_{t}+\\mathfrak{g}_{j}+\\varsigma_{s}+\\varepsilon_{i t}\n$$  \n\n$e x p o r t_{i t}$ indicates whether firm i participates in export trade at time t. The control variables include total factor productivity $(t f p)$ firm size (size), and firm age (age). The province, sector, and year fixed effects are included. From the estimation results in Table 8, we find that dialect diversity depresses the extensive margin of firm exports. Since exports have been proven to have a positive effect on workers? bargaining power, the estimation results in Table 8 indicate that dialect diversity inhibits the bargaining power of workers by depressingexporttrade.  \n\n#### 4.2.2. Dialect diversity and human capital accumulation  \n\nWorkers with higher human capital have higher bargaining power. Studies have found that dialect diversity could depress regional human capital accumulation (Li et al., 2017). Specifically, different dialects inhibit students? English learning ability because of the contradiction between the phonetic system of the local dialect and English pronunciation (Jiang, 2010; Fu, 2012; Fan and Wang, 2015). One of the main reasons students drop out of school is the learning weariness caused by a poor performance in learning English (Su and Ding, 2007; Su et al., 2015). Thus, dialect diversity may inhibit regional human capital accumulation. To examine the effect of dialect diversity on regional human capital accumulation, we use the data from the 5th census of China, in which the average education attainment (edu mean), illiteracy rate (ilteracy_rate) and number of illiterates (iliteracy_sum) in each prefectural-level city are surveyed. These three variables are used as dependent variables. The logarithm of annual government expenditures on education (exp_education), logarithm of GDP (GDP), and teachers per 10,000 people (teacher) in prefectural-level city are used for control variables. Province fixed effects are controlled. The estimation results in Table 9 show that dialect diversity decreases average education attainment and increases the illiteracy rate and number of illiterates, which means that dialect diversity is detrimental to workers? bargaining power because it depresses regional human capital accumulation.  \n\nTable9 Transmission channel: Human capital accumulation.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1) edu_mean</td><td>(2) edu_mean</td><td>(3) illiteracy_rate</td><td>(4) illiteracy_rate</td><td>(5) illiteracy_sum</td><td>(6) illiteracy_sum</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">div_p</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>-0.5186***</td><td></td><td>2.8005***</td><td></td><td>0.6578***</td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">div_n</td><td>(0.137)</td><td>-0.1357***</td><td>(0.738)</td><td>0.6503***</td><td>(0.161)</td><td>0.1873***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.038)</td><td></td><td>(0.205)</td><td></td><td>(0.044)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">exp_education</td><td>0.2701***</td><td>0.2666***</td><td>-0.4132</td><td>-0.4142</td><td>-0.1245 *</td><td>-0.1165 *</td></tr><tr><td>(0.055)</td><td>(0.055)</td><td>(0.295)</td><td>(0.299)</td><td>(0.064)</td><td>(0.064)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">GDP</td><td>0.2055***</td><td>0.2221***</td><td>-1.3156***</td><td>-1.3771***</td><td>0.5288***</td><td>0.5025***</td></tr><tr><td>(0.062)</td><td>(0.063)</td><td>(0.332)</td><td>(0.340)</td><td>(0.073)</td><td>(0.073)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">teacher</td><td>0.0220***</td><td>0.0211***</td><td>-0.0384*</td><td>-0.0330</td><td>-0.0214***</td><td>-0.0204***</td></tr><tr><td>(0.004)</td><td>(0.004)</td><td>(0.020)</td><td>(0.020)</td><td>(0.004)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Constant</td><td>2.3222***</td><td>2.4217***</td><td>25.6377***</td><td>25.1693***</td><td>12.4667***</td><td>(0.004) 12.3280***</td></tr><tr><td>(0.690)</td><td>(0.693)</td><td>(3.712)</td><td>(3.754)</td><td>(0.810)</td><td>(0.809)</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>231</td><td>231</td><td>231</td><td>231</td><td>231</td><td>231</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.697</td><td>0.695</td><td>0.663</td><td>0.656</td><td>0.689</td><td>0.691</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Standard errors in parentheses. $\\mathtt{s}\\mathbin{\\stackrel{\\r{*}\\ne}{\\mathtt{s}}}\\mathtt{p}<0.01,\\mathtt{s}\\mathbin{\\stackrel{\\r{*}\\ne}{\\mathtt{p}}}<0.05,\\mathit{\\varphi}^{\\ast}\\mathtt{p}<0.1$  \n\n## 5. Heterogeneity analysis  \n\nIn this section, we discuss the heterogeneous effect of dialect diversity on the labor share across different types of enterprises. Specifically, sectors with strong bargaining power may be less affected by dialect diversity. Thus, we focus on the differences between state-owned and non-state-owned enterprises, capital-intensive and labor-intensive enterprises, and high-skill-intensity and low-skill-intensive enterprises.  \n\n### 5.1.State-owned enterprises vs.non-state-owned enterprises  \n\nState-owned enterprises (SOEs) in China take social responsibility for expanding employment (Bai et al., 2006), and have great advantages in obtaining state loans at low interest rates (Brandt and Zhu, 2ooo) so as not to transfer capital costs to labor. Although SOE reform has reduced the responsibility of employment stability, SOEs still have more stable labor contracts and better employee benefits than non-SOEs, and thus employees in SOEs have stronger bargaining power (Feng and Guo, 2021). For these reasons, we assume that there exists a heterogeneous effect of dialect diversity on the labor share between SOEs and non-SOEs. The estimation results listed in Table 10 show that dialect diversity has a significantly negative effect only for non-SOEs.  \n\n### 5.2. Capital-intensive enterprises vs. labor-intensive enterprises  \n\nThe estimation results in Table 3 show that capital augmentation decreases the labor share. For capital-intensive enterprises, the bargaining power of capital is higher than the bargaining power of labor. Therefore, the negative effect of dialect diversity on labor is expected to be higher in capital-intensive enterprises than in labor-intensive enterprises. We group the sample according to capital intensity. The capital intensity is measured by the ratio of the book value of the total stock of fixed assets over the number of employees. Enterprises above the median are defined as capital-intensive enterprises, and those below the median as labor-intensive enterprises. The estimation results listed in Table 11 show that the negative effect of dialect diversity on the labor share in capitalintensive enterprises is larger than that in labor-intensive enterprises.  \n\nTable10 Heterogeneity: SOEs vs. non-SOEs.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1) SOEs</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3) non-SOEs</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">div_p</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>-0.0003</td><td></td><td>-0.0265*** (0.009)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>div_n</td><td>(0.007)</td><td>-0.0029</td><td></td><td>-0.0116***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Constant</td><td></td><td>(0.002)</td><td></td><td>(0.003)</td></tr><tr><td>0.4022***</td><td>0.4174***</td><td>0.3903***</td><td>0.4264***</td></tr><tr><td>Controls</td><td>(0.120)</td><td>(0.120)</td><td>(0.071)</td><td>(0.071)</td></tr><tr><td>Year FE</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Province FE</td><td>YES YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Industry FE</td><td>YES</td><td>YES YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>88,322</td><td>88,322</td><td>YES 1510,880</td><td>YES 1510,880</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.375</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.398</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>0.375</td><td>0.398</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Robust standard errors in parentheses. $\\mathtt{s}\\mathbin{\\vrule w\\vrule w\\vrule w\\vrule w\\vrule w}<0.01,\\mathtt{s}\\mathbin{\\vrule w\\vrule w\\vrule w}<0.1$  \n\nTable11 Heterogeneity: Capital-intensive enterprises vs. labor-intensive enterprises.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>VARIABLES</td><td>(1) capital-intensive</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3) labor-intensive</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td>div_p</td><td>-0.0342*** (0.007)</td><td></td><td>-0.0231***</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>div_n</td><td></td><td>-0.0125*** (0.002)</td><td>(0.009)</td><td>-0.0101*** (0.002)</td></tr><tr><td>Constant</td><td>0.1501***</td><td>0.1804***</td><td>0.2179***</td><td>0.2500***</td></tr><tr><td>Controls</td><td>(0.056) YES</td><td>(0.055) YES</td><td>(0.071) YES</td><td>(0.070) YES</td></tr><tr><td>Year FE</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Province FE</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Industry FE</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>799,600</td><td>799,600</td><td>799,602</td><td>799,602</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.381</td><td>0.382</td><td>0.431</td><td>0.431</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Robust standard errors in parentheses. $\\stackrel{**}{\\mathtt{p}}\\rVert<0.01$ $\\mathit{\\Pi}^{*}\\texttt{p}<0.05$ $\\mathfrak{R}\\mathfrak{p}<0.1$  \n\nTable12 Heterogeneity: High-skill-intensive enterprises vs. low-skill-intensive enterprises.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1) high-skill-intensive</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3) low-skill-intensive</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">div_p</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0.0034</td><td></td><td>-0.0197*</td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">div_n</td><td>(0.009)</td><td>-0.0003</td><td>(0.012)</td><td>-0.0063*</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.002)</td><td></td><td>(0.004)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Constant</td><td>0.7595***</td><td>0.7608***</td><td>0.7780***</td><td>0.7840***</td></tr><tr><td>(0.008)</td><td>(0.009)</td><td>(0.012)</td><td>(0.013)</td></tr><tr><td>Controls</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Province FE</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Industry FE</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>73,998</td><td>73,998</td><td>73,976</td><td>73,976</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.372</td><td>0.372</td><td>0.388</td><td>0.388</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Robust standard errors in parentheses. $\\mathtt{s}\\mathbin{\\vrule w\\vrule w\\vrule w\\vrule w\\vrule w}<0.01,\\mathtt{s}\\mathbin{\\vrule w\\vrule w\\vrule w}<0.1$  \n\n### 5.3. High-skill-intensive enterprises vs. low-skill-intensive enterprises  \n\nWorkers with higher human capital have higher bargaining power, and therefore, worker power is expected to be higher in enterprises with a high proportion of high-skill workers (high-skill-intensive enterprises) than in an enterprise with a high proportion of low-skill workers (low-skillintensive enterprises). Therefore, we assume that the negative effect of dialect diversity on the labor share is much stronger in the low-skill-intensive enterprises. The IDE database provides detailed information on the number of workers with different education attainments in 2004, and we can calculate the proportion of workers with at least a high school diploma in the total number of employees. We group the sample according to the proportion of workers with at least a high school diploma in the total number of employees. Then, enterprises above the median are defined as high-skill-intensive enterprises, and those below the median are defined as low-skill-intensive enterprises. The estimation results for these two groups are shown in Table 12. We find that dialect diversity does not show significant effects on the labor share in high-skill-intensive enterprises, but does show significant negative effects on the labor share in low-skillintensive enterprises.  \n\n## 6. Conclusion  \n\nLanguage, as one of the prominent cultural characteristics of a region, has a lasting and extensive impact on economic performance. Based on the data of Chinese industrial enterprises from 1998 to 2013, we find that the labor income share is significantly negatively affected by regional dialect diversity. We study the transmission channels underlying this negative relationship from the perspective of worker bargaining power and find that dialect diversity depresses the labor share by decreasing worker bargaining power. This channel can be further explained by the depressing effect of dialect diversity on firms′ export participation and regional human capital accumulation. In addition, different types of firms are affected by dialect diversity to different degrees. SOEs, laborintensive enterprises, and high-skillintensive enterprises are less affected by dialect diversity.  \n\nThe findings in this paper indicate that attention should be given to the interaction effects between the market, government, and culture. Taking the labor share as an example, most studies focus on the effect of market structure and institutions but ignore the underlying role of culture. This paper not only provides a new perspective for other countries looking for socioeconomic factors that determine the share of labor income but also serves as inspiration for research on the effects of culture on economic outcomes.  \n\n# Fundings  \n\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 72173012), National “Four Batches of Talent\" Project of China (Publicity Department of CPC Central Committee [2017] No. 47) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (grant number 2022CDJSKPT24).  \n\n# Data Availability  \n\nData in support of the findings of this study is available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.  \n\n# References  \n\nAcemoglu, D., 2003.

    "reference_markdown": "# Labor Protection and Leverage  \n\nElena Simintzi University of British Columbia  \n\nVikrant Vig London Business School  \n\nPaolo Volpin Cass Business School, City University London  \n\nThis paper exploits intertemporal variations in employment protection across countries and finds that rigidities in labor markets are an important determinant of firms’ capital structure decisions. Over the 1985-2007 period, we find that reforms increasing employment protection are associated with a 187 basis point reduction in leverage. We interpret this finding to suggest that employment protection increases operating leverage, crowding out financial leverage. This result does not appear to be due to pretreatment differences between treated and control firms, omitted variables, unobserved changes in regional economic conditions, and reverse causality. Heterogeneous treatment effects are consistent with our economic intuition.(JEL J31, J51, G32, G33,K31)  \n\nSince Modigliani and Miller's (1958) irrelevance proposition, financial economists have devoted considerable efforts to understand the nature of the frictions that affect firms’ financial choices. This paper attempts to further our understanding of one such friction, namely, the effect of labor regulation on the capital structure of firms.  \n\nUsing firm-level data from twenty-one countries over the 1985-2007 period, we exploit intertemporal variations in labor regulation across countries, adopting a difference-in-differences (DID) research design to investigate the impact of employment protection legislation on firm financial structure. We find that firms reduce the amount of leverage in their capital structure by 187 basis points, or about $10\\%$ relative to the median leverage, following a reform that increases the employment protection, relative to a set of control firms operating in the same industry at the same time but which are located in countries without changes in employment protection.  \n\nOur explanation for this finding is that an increase in employment protection increases restructuring costs and thus increases the cost of financial distress for a given level of debt. Because of this, firms should react to an increase in employment protection by reducing financial leverage. This follows from a simple static trade-off model of capital structure in which employment protection increases the fixed costs that a firm has to pay independently of its performance, that is, its operating leverage. Essentially, prolabor employment legislation converts the labor contract into a debt-like contract, in turn generating a crowding out effect, namely, operating leverage crowds out financial leverage.  \n\nThe empirical identification in our DID approach comes from the comparison of firms in countries that are subject to a change in employment protection (treated firms) with firms in countries that have no such change (control firms). The key identifying assumption is that, conditional on controls, treated and control firms are only randomly different. Our empirical specification controls for time-invariant firm characteristics by  including firm fixed effects. Year/industry fixed effects absorb time-varying industry characteristics (e.g., investment opportunities). The traditional determinants of leverage (profitability, tangibility, size, and growth opportunities) control for timevarying firm characteristics, whereas time-varying country-level controls take care of time-varying country conditions.  \n\nThe advantage of this approach, as highlighted by Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003), is that most firms over time are both in the treated and control group, thus alleviating the concern that the two sets of firms may differ along other dimensions aside from the change in employment protection. To assuage these concerns further, we show that there are no differences in pretreatment trends between treated and control firms by examining the dynamics of leverage around the passage of these laws. The dynamic analysis also allows us to investigate the presence of pretreatment trends that may be the result of, for instance, the business-cycle effects on both leverage and EPL. We find no statistically significant change in leverage prior to the passage of these laws, although we do find a significant effect on leverage one and two years after the passage of the laws.  \n\nTo sharpen this analysis further, we repeat our estimations using a matched sample. We do this in two ways. We select only control firms that match the treated firms by their size and industry. We also implement a propensity score matching and select control firms that are a good match according to a larger set of observable firm characteristics (profitability, tangibility, size, growth opportunities, and industry). We find that the negative effect of an increase in employment protection on leverage is robust to these changes.  \n\nThe remaining important concern is that there may be other concomitant changes in these countries that may be driving the results, that is, an omitted variable varies within countries in a way that coincides with the change in employment protection. For example, it is plausible that other contemporaneous reforms, such as changes in tax laws, might affect firms’ capital structure decisions besides labor reforms. In this case, the effect on leverage also may be incorrectly attributed to employment protection. Ideally, to control for such reforms or country-specific shocks, one needs to include country/year fixed effects. Unfortunately, this is not possible, as these fixed effects would also absorb EPL, our variable of interest.  \n\nWe perform several tests (other than controlling for countries’ economic conditions) to evaluate this concern. First, we show that employment protection regulations are not sensitive to economic conditions (such as economic growth, recession, or unemployment rates). Second, we restrict our sample of control firms to neighboring countries only. In this way, we can control for shocks that are common to a region, and our results become statistically stronger. Third, we control for other reforms that may be occurring at the same time as the change in employment protection. We find that there is no change in the significance of the coefficient of employment protection when we control for labor market characteristics. We also control for corporate and personal taxes using the data from Faccio and $\\mathrm{Xu}$ (Forthcoming), and the statistical significance of our results does not change. Collectively, the results of these analyses mitigate the concern that some unobserved variables may be driving the results.  \n\nMoreover, although our indicator of employment protection is based on changes in the employment laws of countries, which are not (by their own nature) under direct control of firms, a possible concern is that changes in employment protection are endogenous to firms’ economic conditions because of lobbying activity. We address this concern by studying the political economy of labor reforms. Existing political economy models have highlighted several potential determinants of employment protection. Saint-Paul (2002) suggests that employment protection should be positively correlated with employees’ bargaining power. Pagano and Volpin (2005) predict that lower employment protection is likely to emerge as a political outcome in countries with majoritarian (as compared with proportional) electoral rules. Perotti and Von Thadden (2006) argue that when financial wealth is more concentrated, labor rents and labor protection are higher. Labor market characteristics, economic conditions, and characteristics of the median firm in a country are also potential determinants of employment protection legislations. To our leverage specifications, we add the variables that are significant in our political economy empirical model. The effect of employment protection on leverage is unchanged.  \n\nAs an additional test, we exploit cross-sectional variation in labor turnover across different industries. Because the economic effect that we are emphasizing goes through the labor channel, it is natural to expect firms that have high labor turnover to be more likely affected by a change in EPL. So we divide the firms within a country according to the labor turnover in their industry in the United States and evaluate the differential effect of the EPL reform across these firms. This strategy can be understood as follows: within both treatment and control groups, we are varying the treatment intensity to certain groups. Because this specification allows for country/year fixed effects, all variables at the country level are differenced out, including EPL and any omitted variables. The point of such an exercise is not to estimate the direct effect of EPL on leverage but its differential effect across firms that differ in terms of labor turnover. To the extent that the omitted variables are uncorrelated with labor turnover, the estimate can be interpreted as a triple-difference effect. We find that an increase in EPL has a greater negative effect on leverage in industries with more labor turnover.  \n\nOur findings are robust across definitions of employment protection legislation and leverage. We have constructed our own indicator of employment protection from a careful study of the labor reforms in our sample. These reforms entail significant changes in the costs of firing employees and the flexibility of hiring new ones, distinguishing between reforms that increased and those that decreased employment protection. As a measure of robustness, we also use the Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) indicator produced by Allard (2005), measuring the level of employment protection in a country as a score between zero and six. Results are very similar using these two indicators.1 As our main measure of leverage, we use the ratio of the book value of total debt over the book value of assets and long-term debt over total assets. We also find similar results if we measure leverage as the logarithm of debt or logarithm of long-term debt, as well as other definitions of leverage.  \n\nThe existing literature studying the effect of labor claims on leverage has emphasized the strategic role of debt (Baldwin 1983; Bronars and Deere 1991; Perotti and Spier 1993; Dasgupta and Sengupta 1993; Hennessy and Livdan 2009; Matsa 2010; among several others). This literature argues that debt is strategically used by firms to lower the bargaining power of labor and other suppliers of inputs, and this may be beneficial to the firm as it reduces the cost of these inputs and alleviates the underinvestment problem caused by labor holdout power. To the extent that increases in employment protection increase labor bargaining power, a prediction from these papers is that leverage should increase with employment protection. In the terminology of the trade-off theory of capital structure, this literature predicts that the marginal benefit of debt should increase with employment protection. Clearly, the negative effect of employment protection on leverage is not consistent with this prediction. Our explanation is that the increase in the marginal benefit of debt is more than offset by an increase in the marginal costs of debt due to the increase in fixed labor costs brought about by the increase in employment protection.  \n\nAnother channel in the existing literature through which employment protection may affect leverage is the human costs of bankruptcy. Berk, Stanton, and Zechner (2010) derive the optimal compensation contract for risk-averse workers in the presence of leverage and show that wages must increase with leverage to compensate workers for the costs of financial distress that they suffer. Because of the greater labor costs, an increase in the human costs of financial distress is associated with a reduction of leverage. Agrawal and Matsa (2013) find consistent evidence with this hypothesis: higher labor unemployment benefits are associated with increases in firms’ leverage. It is difficult to relate our analysis to this literature because the effect of employment protection on the human cost of bankruptcy for an employee is theoretically unclear. On the one hand, employment protection may decrease the human cost of bankruptcy because employees receive higher compensation in case their employer files for bankruptcy when employment protection is higher. On the other hand, employment protection may increase the human cost of bankruptcy because it may increase the duration of unemployment in the economy.  \n\nThis paper is also related to the recent literature on labor regulations and economic growth. Using industry-level data from India, Besley and Burgess (2004) find that more proworker regulation is associated with lower investment and economic growth. Botero et al. (2004) show that more stringent labor regulation is associated with lower labor force participation and higher unemployment. Contrarian evidence is offered by Acharya, Baghai, and Subramanian (2010), who find that prolabor laws can have an ex ante positive effect on firms' innovation. This paper revisits the link between labor regulation and growth using microlevel evidence and identifies the mechanism through which labor stifles growth, namely, labor crowds out external finance.  \n\nThis paper also builds on the literature on labor bargaining and firm financing and real activity. Ruback and Zimmerman (1984), Abowd (1989), and Hirsch (1991) document that labor union coverage has a negative association with U.S. firms earnings’ and market values. Lee and Mas (2012) study the impact of firm-level union elections on firm performance and find that union wins are associated with stock price losses, as well as decreases in firm profitability and growth. Chen, Kacperczyk, and Molina (2011) find that the cost of equity is higher in more unionized industries. Atanassov and Kim (2009) provide international evidence that strong unions play an important role in firms' financial and economic restructuring. Benmelech, Bergman, and Enriquez (2009) show that companies in financial distress extract surplus from workers by achieving substantial wage concessions.  \n\nFinally, the paper contributes to a broader body of literature arguing that firms' input markets and product markets are important factors interacting with firms’ capital structure decisions. MacKay and Phillips (2005) find that the position of firms within their industries determines their financial structure. Leary and Roberts (2014) show that firms make decisions on their leverage by responding to capital structure decisions by their peers. Kim (2012) shows that human capital specificity has a negative effect on firms' debt.  \n\n## 1. Data  \n\nWe combine (1) firm-level financial data, (2) country-level control variables, and (3) our indicator on employment protection legislation changes. All of our variables are defined in Appendix A.  \n\n### 1.1 Firm-level data  \n\nOur main data source is Worldscope. Our sample contains financial information on over 30,0o0 nonfinancial companies in the twenty-one countries for which the EPL indicator is available. The sample spans the 1985-2007 period. We start in 1985 because we could not find systematic information about employment protection before 1985. We stop in 2007 because the financial crisis that followed represented a severe structural shock to both financial leverage and employment regulation. From our sample, we exclude financials, utilities, and public administration companies, as well as firms with missing total assets (i.e., a total of 46,034 observations). The final sample consists of 217,183 firm years, though sample size varies over time because of missing information on some variables used in the analysis.  \n\nAs our main measures of leverage, we use the ratio of total debt over total assets and the ratio of long-term debt over total assets. As robustness checks, we also consider the ratio of total leverage over the market value of assets (the latter is defined as total assets, i.e., book value of equity plus market value of equity), the ratio of long-term debt over the market value of assets, net debt (defined as total debt minus cash and other marketable securities) over total assets, net debt over the market value of assets, the logarithm of one plus total debt, and the logarithm of one plus long-term debt.  \n\nIn our regression analysis, we include the standard, firm-level set of explanatory variables for leverage, as identified in the literature (see, for instance, Rajan and Zingales 1995): tangibility (which is defined as net property, plant, and equipment over total assets) as a proxy for the amount of collateral that a firm can pledge, size (which is defined as the logarithm of firms’ real assets) as a control for the degree of diversification and thus the risk of default, profitability (as measured by the return on assets, whichis the ratio of EBIT over total assets) as a proxy for the availability of internal funds, and the market-tobook ratio (i.e. the ratio of the market value of equity plus book value of debt over the book value of debt plus equity), as an indicator of growth opportunities. In panelAof Table 1, we report mean, median, the 25th and 75th percentiles, and standard deviation of the main variables used in the analysis. For this sample, the average ratio of debt to assets is about $25\\%$ .ROA is $2.4\\%$ for the average firm in our sample; tangibility is $31.2\\%$ ; and the average firm has assets of $\\$1.4$ million and trades at a market-to-book ratio of 1.88.  \n\nTable 1 Summary statistics   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Mean</td><td>Median</td><td>SD</td><td>25thpercentile</td><td>75thpercentile</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\">PanelA:Firm-levelvariables</td></tr><tr><td>Total debt/assets</td><td>0.255</td><td>0.203</td><td>0.194</td><td>0.063</td><td>0.352</td></tr><tr><td>Long-term debt/assets</td><td>0.172</td><td>0.119</td><td>0.155</td><td>0.004</td><td>0.218</td></tr><tr><td>Totaldebt/marketvalue assets</td><td>0.285</td><td>0.232</td><td>0.234</td><td>0.035</td><td>0.403</td></tr><tr><td>Long-term debt/market value assets</td><td>0.180</td><td>0.133</td><td>0.172</td><td>0.003</td><td>0.230</td></tr><tr><td>Net debt/assets</td><td>0.070</td><td>0.091</td><td>0.317</td><td>0.114</td><td>0.277</td></tr><tr><td>Net debt/marketvalue assets</td><td>0.105</td><td>0.082</td><td>0.309</td><td>0.071</td><td>0.302</td></tr><tr><td>Log(debt)</td><td>9.015</td><td>10.003</td><td>4.075</td><td>7.573</td><td>11.783</td></tr><tr><td>Log(long-term debt)</td><td>7.761</td><td>9.058</td><td>4.619</td><td>5.024</td><td>11.244</td></tr><tr><td>Size($ mil)</td><td>1,378</td><td>148.0</td><td>73,043</td><td>36.4</td><td>577.7</td></tr><tr><td>ROA</td><td>0.024</td><td>0.060</td><td>0.230</td><td>0.016</td><td>0.108</td></tr><tr><td>Tangibility</td><td>0.312</td><td>0.275</td><td>0.215</td><td>0.115</td><td>0.417</td></tr><tr><td>Market/book</td><td>1.880</td><td>1.001</td><td>5.122</td><td>0.693</td><td>1.635</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\">Panel B: Country-level variables</td></tr><tr><td>GDP growth rate (%)</td><td>2.825</td><td>2.823</td><td>1.947</td><td>1.696</td><td>3.932</td></tr><tr><td>GDP per capita (in thous.$)</td><td>24.115</td><td>22.888</td><td>11.567</td><td>15.502</td><td>30.574</td></tr><tr><td>Creditorrights</td><td>1.910</td><td>1.000</td><td>1.164</td><td>1.000</td><td>3.000</td></tr><tr><td>Unemployment rate (%)</td><td>5.963</td><td>5.406</td><td>2.430</td><td>4.608</td><td>7.134</td></tr><tr><td>Union density(%)</td><td>37.909</td><td>33.491</td><td>20.508</td><td>22.489</td><td>52.207</td></tr><tr><td>Bargaining centralization</td><td>2.571</td><td>3.000</td><td>1.174</td><td>2.000</td><td>3.000</td></tr><tr><td>Income inequality</td><td>31.480</td><td>31.400</td><td>4.441</td><td>28.000</td><td>34.225</td></tr><tr><td>Recessionindicator</td><td>0.078</td><td>0</td><td>0.269</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Miller taxindex</td><td>0.317</td><td>0.321</td><td>0.165</td><td>0.235</td><td>0.388</td></tr><tr><td>Rule of law</td><td>0.918</td><td>1</td><td>0.116</td><td>0.833</td><td>1</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nThis table reports summary statistics for firm-level variables and country-level controls used in the analysis. Firm-level controls are winsorized at $1\\%$ level. The sample consists of 217,183 firm-years for all nonfinancial and nonuntility firms included in Worldscope database for the twenty-one countries of our sample. It covers the period 1985-2007. All variables are defined in Appendix A.  \n\n### 1.2 Country-level control variables  \n\nTo control for the differences in macroeconomic conditions and income across countries, we include GDP growth and GDP per capita in all of our regressions. We also control for creditor rights, as reported by Djankov, McLiesh, and Shleifer (2007), to capture differences in investor protection. The creditor rights index takes values from zero to four, with higher values indicating stronger creditor rights, and it provides time variation in creditor protection.  \n\nIn our robustness analysis, we consider several possible omitted variables: unemployment rates, union density (which is obtained from the OECD), an indicator of the degree of labor bargaining centralization (from the OECD), the Gini coefficient of income inequality, corporate and personal tax reforms (as measured by the Miller index computed using the data in Faccio and Xu (Forthcoming), and an indicator of recessions. This indicator takes a value of one if there are two consecutive quarters with negative GDP growth in a country and zero otherwise. This definition of recession is standard in the macroliterature.  \n\nTo take into consideration differences in the enforcement of the law across countries, we also interact our indicators of employment protection with rule of law (from International Country Risk). Summary statistics for these variables are presented in panel B of Table 1.  \n\n### 1.3 Employment protection indicators  \n\nTo find a measure of labor regulation that varies across countries and over time, we collected data on the major labor reforms across twenty-one OECD countries.2 Following the Employment Protection Legislation indicator produced by the OECD, we focus on laws protecting workers with regular contracts, those affecting workers with fixed-term (temporary) contracts, and regulations applying to collective dismissals.  \n\nTo create our indicator, we selected those reforms that had a significant effect on employment protection, consulting a wide range of sources. Appendix B includes descriptions of the law changes used to build our indicator for each country. Distinguishing between reforms that increased and those that decreased employment protection, we produced an indicator that takes values $R_{k,t}=+1$ (if EPL went up in country $k$ in year $t$ )’ $R_{k,t}=-1$ (if EPL went down in country $k$ in year $t$ ), and $R_{k,t}=0$ otherwise.  \n\nThere are twenty-one major labor reforms in our sample period. Some countries have no major reform (Canada, Finland, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom), while others have two major reforms (Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Sweden). Nine of the reforms led to an increase in employment protection, whereas twelve led to a decrease in employment protection. Table 2 shows the country split in the total number of observations and distribution of treated firms across countries. U.s. firms represent about one-third of the treated sample, followed by France (with $15\\%$ and Germany and Australia (with $11\\%$  \n\nOur indicator, $E P L^{R}$ , is defined recursively starting from $E P L_{k,1985}^{R}=0$ For any given country $k$ in year $t$  \n\n$$\nE P L_{k,t}^{R}=E P L_{k,t-1}^{R}+R_{k,t}.\n$$  \n\nThis indicator is designed to capture the long-run effects of changes in employment regulation. By construction, it is a good indicator over time within a country, but is not comparable across countries: that is, the fact that $E P L^{R}$ is greater in one country than in another does not imply that employment protection is greater in the first country compared with the second one. The variability of this index over time is shown in Figure 1.  \n\nAs a robustness check, we also use the OECD indicator of employment protection as modified and extended by Allard (2005).3 This indicator, which we call $E P L^{A}$ , ranges between zero and six and, unlike $E P L^{R}$ , does not treat all law changes equally. Ahigher $E P L^{A}$ score indicates strongerjob security for workers. The main difference between the two indicators $\\langle E P L^{R}$ and $E P L^{A}$ is that $E P L^{R}$ focuses on large changes in the law, whereas $E P L^{A}$ also considers smaller changes.  \n\nTable2 Distribution of observations by country and EPL reforms   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Country</td><td>Number of firm-year observations</td><td>Number of treatedfirms</td><td>%of treatedfirms (at time of change)</td><td>EPL reforms</td></tr><tr><td>Australia</td><td>7,763</td><td>683</td><td>11.07</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Austria</td><td>1,239</td><td>105</td><td>1.70</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Belgium</td><td>1,658</td><td>117</td><td>1.90</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Canada</td><td>11,662</td><td>0</td><td>0.00</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Denmark</td><td>2,345</td><td>121</td><td>1.96</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Finland</td><td>2,035</td><td>0</td><td>0.00</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>France</td><td>10,777</td><td>948</td><td>15.36</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Germany</td><td>10,115</td><td>688</td><td>11.15</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Greece</td><td>2,718</td><td>23</td><td>0.37</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Ireland</td><td>990</td><td>0</td><td>0.00</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Italy</td><td>3,254</td><td>329</td><td>5.33</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Japan</td><td>48,072</td><td>0</td><td>0.00</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Netherlands</td><td>3,081</td><td>334</td><td>5.41</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>NewZealand</td><td>838</td><td>0</td><td>0.00</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Norway</td><td>2,166</td><td>97</td><td>1.57</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Portugal</td><td>979</td><td>41</td><td>0.66</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Spain</td><td>1,915</td><td>95</td><td>1.54</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Sweden</td><td>3,944</td><td>399</td><td>6.47</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Switzerland</td><td>2,915</td><td>130</td><td>2.11</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>UnitedKingdom</td><td>23,060</td><td>0</td><td>0.00</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>UnitedStates</td><td>75,657</td><td>2,060</td><td>33.39</td><td>1</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nThis table reports the distribution of observations in our sample across countries (Column 1), the number of treated firms (Column 2), and the percentage of treated observations at the time of treatment (Column 3).

EPL and Leverage  \n\nIn this section, we investigate the relation between EPL and leverage. By employing a DID methodology that exploits the intertemporal variations in employment laws, we find that firms reduce their use of debt following legal changes that increase employment protection. We then address possible concerns with our analysis.  \n\n### 2.1 DID approach  \n\nUsing firm-level data, we estimate the following specification:  \n\n$$\ny_{i t}=\\lambda_{i}+\\delta\\cdot E P L_{k,t-1}+\\beta\\cdot X_{i t-1}+\\alpha_{j}\\cdot\\gamma_{t}+\\epsilon_{i t},\n$$  \n\n![](images/402af474eda52f08ed3d1368d3183a27b384b456978e915a7d0ae925bd1a4a37.jpg)  \nFigure 1 Employment protection legislation  \n\nwhere $i$ denotes a firm, $t$ denotes a year, $j$ is an industry, and $k$ is a country. The dependent variable $y_{i t}$ is our measure of leverage; $E P L$ is measured by $E P L^{R}$ $X_{i t-1}$ is the vector of control variables; the $\\lambda_{i}$ is a firm fixed effect; $\\alpha_{j}\\cdot\\gamma_{t}$ is an industry/year fixed effect; and $\\epsilon_{i t}$ is the error term. $X_{i t-1}$ includes the lagged effect of profitability, investment opportunities, size, and tangibility, all of which are the controls typically used in leverage regressions. It also includes macroeconomic variables (GDP growth, GDP per capita, and creditor rights). We cluster the standard errors at the country level, because the labor laws are changing at the country level.4  \n\nA similar research design has been used in several studies, particularly in labor economics. The methodology is best illustrated by the following example. Suppose there are two countries, $A$ and $B$ , undergoing legal changes at times $t=1$ and $t=2$ , respectively. Consider $t=0$ to be the starting period in our sample. From $t=1$ to $t=2$ ,country $B$ initially serves as a control group for legal change; after that it serves as a treated group for subsequent years. Therefore, most countries belong to both treated and control groups at different points in time. This specification is robust to the fact that some groups might not be treated at all or that other groups were treated prior to 1985, which is our sample's start date. It is also robust to using a continuous index (like $E P L^{A}$ ) or a discrete one (like $E P L^{R}$ ).  \n\nFigure 2 presents graphically the within-firm variation in leverage, as a function of changes in employment protection legislation. It plots the average annual leverage in years $t=-3$ to $t=+3$ for the group of treated firms and for the comparison group of control firms, while controlling for firm and industry/year fixed effects that remove the effect of firm-specific characteristics and timevarying industry conditions, respectively. Because of the firm-fixed effects, the annual leverage for both treated and control firms floats around zero. The treated firms have relatively higher leverage before a change in EPL and relatively lower leverage after the change, as compared with their long-run average. No such change happens to control firms. The reduction in leverage between the year before the reform and the year after is 124 basis points for a unit increase in $E P L^{R}$  \n\nIn Table 3, we turn to our regression specifications. Leverage is defined as total debt over book value of assets in Columns 1 and 2 and as long-term debt over book value of assets in Columns 3 and 4. In Columns 1 and 3, we control for industry/year fixed effects (to control for industry-level time-varying characteristics), firm fixed effects (to control for firm-specific characteristics), and country-level control variables, but we do not include the firm-level control variables. In Columns 2 and 4, we add the firm-level control variables.  \n\n![](images/0e43979674ad060e45cecfae03d9727a1e8a0a39f83f7a25b51a4c87605623e9.jpg)  \nFigure2 Firm leverage around employment protection legislation changes The figure plots the within-firm variation in leverage, as a function of changes in employment protection legislation, net of firm-specific characteristics, and time-varying industry conditions.The average annual leverage for the group of treated firms (solid line) in years $\\scriptstyle{\\mathrm{t}}=-3$ to $\\scriptstyle{\\mathrm{t}}=+3$ is compared to the one for control firms (dotted line). $\\mathbf{t}{=}0$ corresponds to the year of the reform.  \n\nAcross all specifications, we find that the coefficient of interest (8 in specification 2 above) is negative and statistically different from zero at the $1\\%$ Or $5\\%$ level. The effect of an increase in EPL on total debt over assets is a reduction of 173 basis points in Column 1 and 187 basis points in Column 2, Or $9\\%$ relative to the median leverage. The fact that the estimated coefficient on EPL is almost identical across the two specifications indicates that EPL changes are not systematically correlated with firm-level variables; that is, they are random at the firm level. The effect of an increase in EPL on long-term debt over assets is a reduction of 106 basis points in Column 3, and 113 basis points in Column 4, or $10\\%$ relative to the median long-term leverage.  \n\nThe coefficients on Tangibility, Size, ROA, and Q have the expected sign. They are allstatistically significant, except for Q.6 GDP growth has the expected  \n\nTable3 EPL and leverage: Baseline results   \nLong-term debt/assets   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\"></td></tr><tr><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.0173</td><td>0.0187</td><td>-0.0106</td><td>0.0113</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.0084)**</td><td>(0.0080)**</td><td>(0.0028)***</td><td>(0.0037)***</td></tr><tr><td>Tangibilityt=-1</td><td></td><td>0.1220</td><td></td><td>0.0780</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Sizet=-1</td><td></td><td>(0.0111)***</td><td></td><td>(0.0055)***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.0360</td><td></td><td>0.0270</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(0.0068)***</td><td></td><td>(0.0026)***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">ROA=-1</td><td></td><td>-0.0880</td><td></td><td>0.0516</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.0202)***</td><td></td><td>(0.0077)***</td></tr><tr><td>Market/Bookt=-1</td><td></td><td>0.0012</td><td></td><td>-0.0004</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">GDPGrowtht=-1</td><td></td><td>(0.0008)</td><td></td><td>(0.0004)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0024</td><td>-0.0020</td><td>0.0004</td><td>0.0007</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.0010)**</td><td>(0.0007)***</td><td>(0.0006)</td><td>(0.0006)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">GDPperCapitat=-1</td><td>0.0036</td><td>0.0028</td><td>0.0019</td><td>0.0011</td></tr><tr><td>((0.0006)***</td><td>(0.0004)****</td><td>(0.0004)***</td><td>(0.0003)***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Creditor Rightst=-1</td><td>0.0073</td><td>0.0011</td><td>0.0137</td><td>0.0101</td></tr><tr><td>(0.0060)</td><td>(0.0065)</td><td>(0.0046)***</td><td>(0.0050)**</td></tr><tr><td>Firm FE</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>Industry*year FE</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>R2</td><td>0.72</td><td>0.75</td><td>0.70</td><td>0.72</td></tr><tr><td>No.of observations</td><td>217,183</td><td>178,419</td><td>223,651</td><td>178,336</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table reports the results of regressions of leverage on the $E P L^{R}$ indicator. In Columns 1 and 2, we define leverage as total debt over assets, and in Columns 3 and 4, we define leverage as long-term debt over assets. The regressions control for GDP growth, GDP per capita, and creditor rights. Columns 2 and 4 also include the standard leverage firm-level controls (tangibility, size, profitability, and market to book). All controls are lagged by one year. Firm and industry/year fixed effects are included in all columns.

All variables are defined in Appendix A.  \n\nnegative sign in Columns 1 and 2 (although it is not significant for longterm leverage), consistent with the view that firms increase debt following macroeconomic downturns. GDP per capita is positive and significant, consistent with the idea that leverage is higher when economic development is higher. Creditor rights index is positively correlated with leverage, as demonstrated in the law and finance literature.  \n\n### 2.2 Econometric concerns: Pretreatment trends  \n\nThe empirical identification in the DID approach presented in Table 3 comes from the comparison of the change in leverage in firms that are subject to a labor law reform (treated firms) with the change in leverage in firms that do not experience such a reform (control firms). One concern with this approach is that the estimated treatment effect could be due to pretreatment differences in the characteristics of treated and control firms. We address this concern in three ways. First, we examine the dynamics of leverage in the years around the enactment of the labor reform. Second, we control for country-specific trends, allowing countries to follow different trends. Third, we match firms according to their geographical location, their industry and size, or other observable characteristics.  \n\n2.2.1 Capital structure dynamics and country trends. To examine the dynamic effects of EPL changes on firms’ capital structure, in Columns 1, 2, 5 and 6 of Table 4, we replace the EPL indicator with four variables: EPL $(+2)$ is the 2-year forward value of EPL; EPL $(+1)$ is the 1-year forward value of EPL; EPL (O) is the contemporaneous value of EPL; EPL $(-1)$ is the 1-year lagged value of EPL; and EPL $(-2)$ is the 2-year lagged value of EPL. We estimate a similar specification to those presented in Table 3, with firm fixed effects, year/industry fixed effects, firm control variables, and country control variables. Columns 1 and 2 present the results with total debt as our measure of leverage, whereas Columns 5 and 6 present results with long-term debt. The coefficients on EPL $(+1)$ and EPL $(+2)$ allow us to assess whether any leverage effects can be found prior to the passage of labor laws. Finding such an effect of the legislation prior to its introduction could be symptomatic of pretreatment trends in leverage or reverse causation. Across all specifications, we find that the estimated coefficients on EPL $(+1)$ and EPL $(+2)$ are economically and statistically insignificant. This rejects any support for pretreatment trends and reverse causality. Moreover, both EPL $(-1)$ and EPL $(-2)$ are statistically and economically significant across specifications. Similarly to Table 3, we exclude (in Columns 1 and 5) and include (in Columns 2 and 6) firm-level controls to control for the effect of firm-level controls on the EPL coefficient. These findings support our causal interpretation of the results. The long-run effect of EPL on leverage is captured by the coefficient on $\\mathrm{EPL}(-2)$ , which amounts to 111 basis points for total leverage and 73 basis points when leverage is defined by the ratio of long-term debt to assets.  \n\nWe further check whether different country trends are driving the results. We augment our baseline with country-specific time trends. Results are shown in Columns 3 and 4 and 7 and 8 of Table 4.In this case, the identification of the effects of employment protection on firm leverage comes from whether these labor reforms lead to deviations from pretreatment country-specific trends. Despite the fact that this is a very tough specification, our results remain statistically significant at $10\\%$ level for total debt and at $5\\%$ level for long-term debt. Our results also remain significant economically.7  \n\n2.2.2 Matching: Geography and firm-level characteristics. To address further the concern that pretreatment differences between treated and control firms are behind the differential effect on leverage, in Table 5 we adopt a matching approach.  \n\nWe start controlling for geographical differences between treated and control firms (e.g., a German firm may be quite different from a U.S. firm, even if they are in the same industry, but may be similar in many aspects to an Austrian firm). To control for geography, we define fifteen regions to include bordering  \n\nTable 4 Dynamic analysis and country trends   \nTotal debt/assets   \nLong-term debt/assets   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td><td>(7)</td><td>(8)</td></tr><tr><td>EPLR t=+2</td><td>0.0053</td><td>0.0020</td><td></td><td></td><td>-0.0026</td><td>0.0037</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.0073)</td><td>(0.0069)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.0039)</td><td>(0.0051)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>EPLR</td><td>0.0113</td><td>0.0122</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.0020</td><td>0.0016</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>‘↑=+1</td><td>(0.0084)</td><td>(0.0088)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.0037)</td><td>(0.0039)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>EPLR</td><td>-0.0072</td><td>0.0116</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.0002</td><td>-0.0009</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>t=0</td><td>(0.0110)</td><td>(0.0120)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.0027)</td><td>(0.0033)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>EPLR ‘t=-1</td><td>0.0077</td><td>-0.0073</td><td>0.0167</td><td>0.0163</td><td>0.0041</td><td>0.0042</td><td>-0.0098</td><td>-0.0093</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.0037)**</td><td>(0.0036)**</td><td>(0.0092)*</td><td>(0.0093)*</td><td>(0.0017)**</td><td>(0.0019)**</td><td>(0.0038)**</td><td>(0.0040)*</td></tr><tr><td>EPLR</td><td>0.0142</td><td>0.0111</td><td></td><td></td><td>-0.0095</td><td>-0.0073</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>t=-2</td><td>(0.0053)**</td><td>(0.0043)**</td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.0039)**</td><td>(0.0039)*</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Firm-level controls</td><td></td><td>yes</td><td></td><td>yes</td><td></td><td>yes</td><td></td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>Country-level controls</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>Firm FE</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>Industry*yearFE</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>Countryyear trends</td><td></td><td></td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td></td><td></td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>R2</td><td>0.77</td><td>0.78</td><td>0.72</td><td>0.75</td><td>0.74</td><td>0.75</td><td>0.72</td><td>0.72</td></tr><tr><td>No.of observations</td><td>139,110</td><td>118,420</td><td>217,183</td><td>178,419</td><td>142,843</td><td>118,306</td><td>223,651</td><td>178,336</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nThistable eports therelts ofrgresiosof lveragonthtw-alagedneyealagged, tecotoraneous andthneyar andtw-yar forwad valf $E P L^{R}$ indicator IColraatlvadlrangeresol capita, and creditor rights.

Column 3 regresses leverage on both $E P L^{R}$ and $E P L^{O t h e r}$ indicators. $E P L^{O t h e r}$ is computed as the average of $E P L^{R}$ indicator in year $t$ for the neighboring countries. We call neighboring countries those which share common borders. Columns 4-6 use a matched sample for the analysis. Columns 4 and 5 match treated and control firms by industry and size. Column 4 selects control firms using all matching firms that differ at most by a factor of two with respect to the treated firm, whereas Column 5 matches each treated firm to its nearest neighbor in terms of size and industry. Column 6 matches treated and control firms using a multivariate propensity score methodology,selecting control firms within a predefined caliper distance of $\\delta=0.01$ . The regressions include the standard leverage firm-level controls (tangibility, size, profitability, and market to book). In addition, they control for GDP growth, GDP per capita, and creditor rights. All controls are lagged by one year. Firm and industry/year fixed effects are included in all columns. Columns 1 and 2 also include region/year fixed effects. Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses.\\*, $^{**}$ , and $***$ indicate significance at the $10\\%$ $5\\%$ , and $1\\%$ level, respectively.Standard errors are clustered at the country level.

All variables are defined in Appendix A.  \n\ncountries (for example, the United States and Canada). In Column 1, we add region/year fixed effects to the specification estimated in Column 2 of Table 3. These fixed effects control for shocks that are common to neighboring countries. We report only the coefficient for the EPL indicator, which we find to be negative and strongly statistically significant at the $1\\%$ level. In Column 2, we estimate the same specification as in Column 1 in a smaller sample, in which we drop observations with no EPL change in a region. The coefficient of interest remains negative and strongly statistically significant at $1\\%$ level.  \n\nInterestingly, these tests also alleviate concerns that changes in local macroeconomic conditions are driving our results. Although we control for the standard macroeconomic variables in our regressions, including region-specific shocks in these specifications absorbs any variation at the regional level that might be driving our results. Following Heider and Ljungqvist (2013), we use information on geography to develop a placebo test that further addresses this concern. For each country $k$ and year $t$ , we compute the average of $E P L^{R}$ indicator in year $t$ for the neighboring countries $(E P L^{O t h e r})$ . To the extent that a local economic shock is also affecting neighboring countries, we would expect to find a negative and significant coefficient on $E P L^{O t h e r}$ . In Column 3 of Table 5, we add $E P L^{O t h e r}$ to the basic specification, and we find that it is not statistically different from zero, whereas the coefficient on the EPL indicator for country $k$ itself remains statistically and economically significant. This result suggests that the effect on leverage is not driven by business-cycle effects.  \n\nA further concern with our analysis is that treated and control firms may differ in terms of basic characteristics like size and industry. In Columns 4 and 5, we address this concern by selecting as control firms only those that match the treated firms in terms of size and industry.8 The number of control firms varies depending on the choice of the maximum difference in size required for a match. In Column 4, we report the results selecting control firms with replacement using all matching firms that differ at most by a factor of two with respect to the treated firm.? In Column 5, we report the results matching each treated firms to its nearest neighbor in terms of size and industry. In both cases, the effect of labor reforms on leverage is unchanged.  \n\nIn Column 6, we match treated and control firms using a multivariate propensity score methodology. We estimate a probit model of the probability of being treated as a function of firm-level characteristics (besides size and industry, we include profitability, tangibility, and growth opportunities) and country-level characteristics (GDP growth, per capita GDP, and creditor rights). For each observation in our sample, we compute a propensity score as the predicted value of the probability of being treated according to the probit model. We report the results selecting control firms within a predefined propensity score distance with caliper $\\delta{=}0.01$  \n\nAcross all specifications, the coefficient on the EPL indicator is virtually unchanged from the specification estimated in Table 3. This alleviates concerns that pretreatment differences may be responsible for our results.  \n\n### 2.3 Econometric concerns: Confounding changes  \n\nWe already mentioned in the previous section that business-cycle effects might be responsible for our findings, and we have already addressed some of these concerns by controlling for GDP growth in Table 3, country-specific trends in Table 4, and geography in Table 5. A further concern with respect to a causal interpretation of our findings is that other reforms may be also happening at the same time as the change in employment protection (e.g., tax changes). In this case, the change of leverage may be incorrectly attributed to employment protection because of an omitted variables problem. We address this concern by studying the political economy of labor reforms and by controlling for corporate and personal taxation and other country-level variables. We also consider the differential impact of a change in EPL on different firms within a country.  \n\n2.3.1 Political economy of EPL. In this section, we tackle the concern that changes in labor regulation may be endogenous to firms’ financial decisions.  \n\nThis concern is likely to be less severe than in the case of changes in variables that are directly affected by the choice of an individual firm, such as the unionization rate. This is because changes in EPL reflect changes in laws and are thus not directly affected by the decisions of individual firms. However, there still may be some concerns about the political economy of changes in labor protection. After all, firms or unions may lobby politicians to change labor regulations when it is in their interest to do so.  \n\nThe existing empirical studies on the political economy of labor regulation do not find much support for a lobbying explanation. Botero et al. (2004) show that legal origin and economic development are the most important determinants of labor regulation, with ideology being of secondary importance. Moreover, existing political economy models have highlighted several potential determinants of employment protection that are exogenous to firms’ decisions: Saint-Paul (2002) indicates that greater employment protection is likely to emerge in countries in which employees have greater bargaining power; Pagano and Volpin (2005) predict that lower employment protection is likely to emerge as a political outcome in countries with majoritarian (as compared with proportional) electoral rules; and Perotti and Von Thadden (2006) argue that when financial wealth is more concentrated, labor rents and labor protection arehigher.  \n\nIn untabulated regressions, we study the determinants of changes in EPL, estimating a linear probability model at the country/year level. We consider the lagged values of unemployment rate, union density, and centralized bargaining as proxies for the rigidity of the labor market, the lagged proportionality index as a measure of the proportionality of the electoral system, the lagged value of income inequality as a proxy for wealth inequality, an indicator for leftwing governments (also lagged) to capture ideology, and an indicator for technological progress at the country-year level (as proxied by a measure of multifactor productivity). Further determinants of changes in EPL may be the characteristics of the median firm in the country. If the median firm in a country is larger or older, firms may be more effective in lobbying politicians for a reduction in EPL. We also control for lagged GDP growth and a lagged indicator capturing recession years to control for business-cycle effects and GDP per capita to capture general economic development. We include year dummy and country fixed effects to capture general macroeconomic conditions and country-level heterogeneity. We cluster standard errors at the country level.  \n\nWe find that union density and income inequality (as proxied by the Gini indicator) are the only variables that are statistically significant. EPL increases when a country changes toward more unionized labor markets and when income inequality increases. In the next section, we will control for these potential omitted variables.  \n\n2.3.2 Omitted variables. In Table 6, we consider several possible omitted variables. We start with those variables that were significant in our political  \n\nTable6 EPL and leverage: Political economy   \nTotal debt/assets   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td></tr><tr><td>EPLR ↑=-1</td><td>-0.0166 (0.0078)**</td><td>-0.0166 (0.0077)**</td><td>0.0177 (0.0074)**</td><td>0.0147 (0.0035)***</td><td>-0.0135 (0.0030)***</td></tr><tr><td>UnionDensityt=-1</td><td>-0.0020 (0.0006)***</td><td>-0.0022 (0.0007)***</td><td>0.0019 (0.0007)** 0.0008</td><td>0.0014 (0.0006)**</td><td>0.0012 (0.0007)*</td></tr><tr><td>Gini=-1</td><td></td><td>0.0007 (0.0005)</td><td>(0.0004)* 0.0171</td><td>0.0002 (0.0004) 0.0135</td><td>0.0006 (0.0003)* 0.0116</td></tr><tr><td>BargainingCentralization=-1</td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.0054)*** 0.0019</td><td>(0.0036)*** 0.0037</td><td>(0.0030)***</td></tr><tr><td>UnemploymentRatet=-1</td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.0016)</td><td>(0.0011)***</td><td>-0.0041 (0.0013)***</td></tr><tr><td>Recessiont=-1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.0060 (0.0014)***</td><td>0.0054 (0.0018)***</td></tr><tr><td>Taxest=-1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.0703 (0.0245)***</td></tr><tr><td>Firm-levelcontrols</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>Other country-level controls</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>FirmFE</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>Industry*year FE</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>R2</td><td>0.75</td><td>0.71</td><td>0.71</td><td>0.76</td><td>0.72</td></tr><tr><td>No.ofobservations</td><td>178,419</td><td>171,561</td><td>169,265</td><td>150,806</td><td>145,814</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table regresses leverage (defined as total debt/assets) on the $E P L^{R}$ indicator, controlling for potential omitted variables. Column 1 controls for union density. Column 2 adds the Gini coefficient, and Column 3 additionally controls for bargaining centralization and unemployment rates. Column 4 includes an indicator of recession to the previous set of controls,whereas Column 5 adds the miller tax indicator.The regressionsinclude the standard leverage firm-level controls (tangibility, size, profitability, and market to book). In addition, they control for GDP growth, GDP per capita, and creditor rights. All controls are lagged by one year. Firm and industry/year fixed effects are included in all columns.

All variables are defined in Appendix A.  \n\neconomy analysis, namely, union density and income inequality. We then control for additional variables to capture potential confounding effects that may be biasing our findings.  \n\nIn Column 1, we add union density to the specification estimated in Column 2 of Table 3. We find that union density is statistically (and economically) significant, but its addition does not change the coefficient on the EPL indicator. Here, it is worth noting that the coefficient of union density is negative, which is not consistent with the theory of debt as a bargaining tool. Column 2 adds the Gini coefficient of income inequality, which is not statistically significant and does not change the results.  \n\nIn Column 3, we look at whether EPL is proxying for other employment indicators. In addition to union density, we include centralized bargaining and unemployment rates as proxies for the rigidity of the labor market. We find that leverage increases in countries in which bargaining becomes more centralized and decreases in countries in which union density increases. The coefficient on unemployment rates is not statistically significant. The coefficient on employment protection is not affected by the addition of these variables.  \n\nHence, the EPL channel is independent of the effects of unionization or how centralized bargaining is.  \n\nIn Column 4, we add an indicator of recession. This variable is strongly correlated with leverage. EPL is statistically significant at the $1\\%$ level. Finally, in Column 5, we consider tax reforms. Using data from Faccio and Xu (Forthcoming), we construct the Miller tax index, which measures the relative tax advantage of debt versus equity, including personal and corporate taxes. As expected, leverage increases in the Miller tax index. The coefficient of EPL is still significant at $1\\%$ level but is smaller in magnitude.  \n\nAlthough we cannot completely rule out the possibility that some unobserved variable may be driving the results, the robustness of our findings across differentspecificationsreduces the omittedvariableconcerns.  \n\n2.3.3 Cross-sectional heterogeneity. As an additional test, we exploit crosssectional variation in labor turnover across different industries. Because the economic effect we are emphasizing goes through the labor channel, it is natural to expect firms in sectors that experience high labor turnover to be more likely to be affected by a change in EPL. The assumption is that industries share common characteristics (e.g., technological) across countries. Higher values of this variable mean that these industries require higher labor turnover for their operations, and therefore increases in employment protection would impact these industries more negatively.  \n\nThis test can be understood as follows: we sort firms into buckets that differ in terms of sensitivity to the treatment and test whether the impact of a change in EPL is greater in firms with higher sensitivity to the treatment. The point of such an exercise is not to estimate the direct effect of EPL on leverage, but its differential effect across firms that differ in terms of labor turnover. To the extent that the omitted variables are uncorrelated with labor turnover, the estimate can be interpreted as a triple-difference effect. In other words, the identification assumption is that omitted variables have a similar impact on leverage across buckets.  \n\nTherefore, in Table 7, we estimate the following regression specification:  \n\n$$\ny_{i t}=\\alpha_{j}\\cdot\\gamma_{t}+\\lambda_{i}+\\delta\\cdot E P L_{k,t-1}^{R}+\\zeta\\cdot E_{j}+\\theta\\cdot\\left(E P L_{k,t-1}^{R}\\times E_{j}\\right)+\\beta\\cdot X_{i t-1}+\\epsilon_{i t}.\n$$  \n\nAs before, we include firm fixed effects, industry/year fixed effects, firm-level controls, and country-level controls. $E_{j}$ denotes a measure of labor turnover for industry $j$ in year $t$ based on data provided by Davis, Haltiwanger, and Schuh (1996) (at the 2-digit SIC industry level) for the United States. This measure is available only for manufacturing industries.  \n\nIn Column 1, we find that the interaction of EPL and turnover is negative and statistically significant at the $5\\%$ level. The coefficient on EPL by itself loses statistical significance. In Column 2, we also control for country/year fixed effects. In such a specification we cannot estimate the direct effect of EPL on  \n\nTable7 Cross-sectional heterogeneity: Labor turnover   \nTotal debt/assets   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td>EPLR t=-1</td><td>0.0305</td><td></td><td>0.0075</td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">EPLR *Turnover t=-1</td><td>(0.0245)</td><td></td><td>(0.0122)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>-0.0056</td><td>-0.0057</td><td>-0.0025</td><td>-0.0022</td></tr><tr><td>(0.0027)**</td><td>(0.0027)**</td><td>(0.0012)**</td><td>(0.0011)*</td></tr><tr><td>Firm-levelcontrols</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>Country-levelcontrols</td><td>yes</td><td></td><td>yes</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>FirmFE</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>Industry*year FE</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>Country*yearFE</td><td></td><td>yes</td><td></td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>Drop U.S.</td><td></td><td></td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>R2</td><td>0.72</td><td>0.73</td><td>0.74</td><td>0.75</td></tr><tr><td>No.of observations</td><td>91,472</td><td>91,472</td><td>59,569</td><td>59,569</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table reports the results of regressions of cross-sectional heterogeneity. Total debt over assets is regressed on the interaction of $E P L^{R}$ indicator with labor turnover. Turnover is a proxy for employment turnover calculated using data by Davis, Haltiwanger, and Schuh (1996), available for manufacturing industries in the United States. United States observations are included in Columns 1 and 2 but are not included in Columns 3 and 4. Firm and industry/year fixed effects are included in all columns. Columns 2 and 4 also include country/year fixed effects, which absorb the level EPL effect. The turnover variable is also absorbed and thus cannot be estimated. The regressions include the standard leverage firm-level controls (tangibility, size,profitability, and market tobook). In addition, they control for GDP growth, GDP per capita, and creditor rights. All controls are lagged by one year. Firm and industry/year fixed effects are included in all columns.

All variables are defined in Appendix A.  \n\nleverage, but we can estimate the differential effect of a change in EPL on firms in sectors that differ in their labor turnover. The estimated coefficient for this interaction term is in fact more carefully estimated in this setup because the country/year fixed effects control for other factors that vary at the country/year level. This addresses concerns that there could be changes at the country level, such as changes in the tax rates, which can impact firms' leverage and coincide with the labor regulation changes. The coefficient on the interaction of EPL and turnover is negative and statistically significant at the $5\\%$ level, which is consistent with our intuition.  \n\nAs in Rajan and Zingales (1998), one concern might be that including the United States in this regression might bias our results because we define labor turnover using U.s. data. To address this concern, in Columns 3 and 4, we repeat the same analysis dropping U.S. firms. Our results remain statistically significant. In summary, across all specifications, we find that an increase in EPL is associated with a greater decrease in leverage in sectors with more labor turnover.  \n\n## 3. Further Tests  \n\nIn this section, we show that the results are robust to alternative definitions of leverage and alternative indicators of employment protection.  \n\nTable 8 Alternative definitions of leverage   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Log (totaldebt)</td><td>Log (long-term debt)</td><td>Total debt/market value assets</td><td>Long-term debt/market valueofassets</td><td>Net debt/book assets</td><td>Net debt/market assets</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td></tr><tr><td>EPLR t=-1</td><td>-0.109 (0.0334)***</td><td>0.136 (0.0469)***</td><td>-0.0248 (0.0161)</td><td>0.0147 (0.0059)**</td><td>0.0217 (0.0116)*</td><td>0.0320 (0.0133)**</td></tr><tr><td>Firm-levelcontrols</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>Country-levelcontrols</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>FirmFE</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>Industry*yearFE</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>R2</td><td>0.90</td><td>0.87</td><td>0.75</td><td>0.70</td><td>0.77</td><td>0.73</td></tr><tr><td>No.ofobservations</td><td>178,419</td><td>178,336</td><td>175,920</td><td>175,910</td><td>159,920</td><td>157,379</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table reports the results of regressions of alternative definitions of leverage on the $E P L^{R}$ indicator. Leverage is defined as logarithm of one plus total debt (Column 1), logarithm of one plus long-term debt (Column 2), total debt over market value of assets (Column 3), long-term debt over market value of assets (Column 4), net debt over book value of assets (Column 5), and net debt over market value of assets (Column 6). The regressions include the standard leverage firm-level controls (tangibility, size, profitability, and market to book). In addition, they control for GDP growth, GDP per capita, and creditor rights. All controls are lagged by one year. Firm and industry/year fixed effects are included in all columns. Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. \\*, \\*\\*, and $***$ indicate significance at the $10\\%$ $5\\%$ ,and $1\\%$ level, respectively. Standard errors are clustered at the country level.Firm-level controls are winsorized at the $1\\%$ tails. Our sample includes twenty-one countries and covers the period 1985-2007.All variables are defined in Appendix A.  \n\n### 3.1 Alternative definitions of leverage  \n\nOur findings are robust across definitions of leverage. As our main measure of leverage, we use the ratio of the book value of total debt over total assets and long-term debt over book value of assets. For robustness, in Table 8, we consider three alternative definitions of leverage: the logarithm of total debt (and the logarithm of long-term debt), market leverage (where we replace the book value of equity with its market value), and net debt (defined as debt net ofcash).  \n\nColumns 1 and 2 of Table 8 report the coefficient for EPL of a regression similar to the one in Table 3, Column 2, where the dependent variable is the logarithm of one plus total debt (Column 1) or the logarithm of one plus long-term debt (Column 2). This specification deals with the concern that the uncovered negative effect on leverage is due to an increase in assets (at the denominator) rather than a reduction in leverage (at the numerator) following an increase in EPL. The fact that the coefficient on EPL is strongly significant (at the $1\\%$ level) and negative in both columns addresses this concern.  \n\nIn Columns 3 and 4, the dependent variable is market leverage measured as the ratio of total debt over market value of assets (in Column 3) and longterm debt over market value of assets (in Column 4). The coefficient on EPL is marginally insignificant (in Column 3), significant at the $5\\%$ level (in Column 4), and negative in both cases. The weaker results with market leverage may be due to the fact that prolabor regulation is treated as negative news by the market and thus may reduce the market value of equity. Evidence provided by Ruback and Zimmerman (1984), Abowd (1989), Hirsch (1991), and Lee and Mas (2012) shows that labor union coverage has a negative association with U.S. firms′ earnings and market values. This biases against finding any results.  \n\nColumns 5 and 6 estimate the same specification using net debt over total assets (in Column 5) and net debtover market value ofassets (in Column 6). This deals with concerns that an increase in EPL may lead firms to reduce cash. This reduction may more than offset the reduction in debt, making firms effectively more levered after, rather than before, the reform. Because the coefficients are significant at the $10\\%$ level (Column 5), at the $5\\%$ level (Column 6), and negative, these concerns are dismissed.  \n\nTo summarize, the results in Table 8 are similar to those in Table 3: across all our specifications, increases in labor protection are associated with decreases in leverage.  \n\n### 3.2 Alternative measure of EPL  \n\nIn Table 9, we consider alternative measures of EPL to check the robustness of ourresults.  \n\nIn Columns 1-4, we measure employment protection with $E P L^{A}$ , that is, the indicator developed by Allard (2005). The main difference between $E P L^{A}$ and $E P L^{R}$ is that $E P L^{R}$ focuses on large changes in the law, whereas $E P L^{A}$ also considers smaller changes.  \n\nIn Columns 1 and 2, we replicate our baseline specifications as reported in Table 3. In Column 1, we control for industry/year fixed effects (to control for industry-level dynamics), firm fixed effects (to control for firm-specific characteristics), and country-level control variables, leaving out the firm-level control variables. In Column 2, we also add the firm-level control variables. The coefficients on the EPL indicator are identical in the two specifications, indicating that EPL changes are not systematically correlated with firm level variables; that is, they are random at the firm level. The magnitude of the coefficient is larger than in Table 3: a 1-unit increase of $E P L^{A}$ is associated with a 300-basis-point decrease in leverage, 0r $15\\%$ relative to the median leverage. This indicates that focusing only on major reforms (as done when using $E P L^{R}.$ ) leads to an underestimation of the true effect of employment protection on leverage.  \n\nIn Columns 3 and 4, we replicate some of the dynamic analysis as reported in Table 4. Column 3 adds country-specific trends to the specification of Column 2 to address whether different country trends are driving the results. In this case, the identification of the effects of employment protection on firm leverage comes from whether these labor reforms lead to deviations from pretreatment country-specific trends. Despite the fact that this is a very tough specification, our results remain statistically significant at the $10\\%$ level.

Column 5 uses the E PLA indicator scaled by the rule of law indicator to account for the quality of legal enforcement, whereas Column 6 uses the $E P L^{R}$ indicator scaled by the ruleof law.The regressions controlforGDP growth,GDPer capita, and creditor rights. Columns 2-6 also include the standard leverage firm-level controls (tangibility, size, profitability, and market to book). All controls are lagged by one year. Firm and industry/year fixed effects are included in all columns. Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. \\*, $^{**}$ , and $***$ indicate significance at the $10\\%$ $5\\%$ , and $1\\%$ level, respectively. Standard errors are clustered at the country level. Firm-level controls arewinsorized at the $1\\%$ tails. Our sample includes twenty-one countries and covers the period 1985-2007.All variables are defined in Appendix A.  \n\nexamines the dynamics of capital structure as presented in Column 2 of Table 4 to check whether there are pretreatment trends driving the analysis. We find that the estimated coefficients on EPL $(+1)$ and EPL $(+2)$ are economically and statistically insignificant. Therefore, there is no evidence for pretreatment trends and reverse causality. We find that the coefficient on EPL(-2) is negative and significant at the $5\\%$ level, indicating that the long-run effect on leverage is 124 basis points.  \n\nA concern with our indicators might be that they do not account for the effectiveness of litigation in different countries. If laws are not well enforced, then they are less effective. In Columns 5 and 6, we take into account the quality of legal enforcement as measured by rule of law. We interact the rule of law indicator with $E P L^{A}$ in Column 5, and with $E P L^{R}$ in Column 6. The results are somewhat stronger than those in the baseline specification: a unit increase in $E P L^{A}*$ Rule of Law is associated with a decrease in leverage of 308 basis points, whereas an increase in $E P L^{R}*$ Rule of Law is associated with a decrease in leverage of 174 basis points.  \n\n## 4. Conclusion  \n\nThe recent financial crisis and the subsequent global recession have once again brought the contentious topic of employment protection to the fore of the policy debate. Policy makers around the world are contemplating how to reform the rules that govern industrial relations. Although some countries, such as the United States, are moving toward greater labor protection,10 continental European countries are discussing how to amend their current labor laws in an attempt to boost potential growth.11 These recent developments demonstrate the need to revisit the role of labor in shaping corporate behavior and pin down the economic channel through which labor may affect firms’ economic activities.  \n\nUsing firm-level data from twenty-one OECD countries over the 1985-2007 period, we find that leverage decreases when employment protection increases, a result that is robust across all specifications. Our theoretical argument is that prolabor regulations, by making it difficult for firms to adjust labor force, increase labor market rigidity. This makes the labor claim resemble a debt claim, where wages can be construed as coupon payments on debt. This transformation of labor claim into a senior debt-like claim crowds out financial leverage. We also find that increases in employment protection have more negative effects on firms’ leverage for firms for which hiring and firing is more frequent. Our findings provide supporting evidence for the critics of employment protection laws by showing that labor-friendly regulation may have negative real effects via a finance channel.  \n\n## Appendix A: Variable Definitions  \n\nA.1 Firm-level variables  \n\nTotal Debt (Book)/Assets is defined as the sum of long-term debt and short-term debt over the book value of assets (source:Worldscope).  \n\nLong-term Debt (Book)/Assets is defined as long-term debt over the book value of assets (source: Worldscope).  \n\nTotal Debt (Market)/Assets is defined as the sum of total debt over the sum of total debt (book) and the market value of equity (source: Worldscope).  \n\nLong-term Debt (Market)/Assets is defined as the sum of long-term debt over the sum of long-term debt (book) and the market value of equity (source: Worldscope).  \n\nNet Debt (Book)/Assets is defined as total debt minus cash over the book value of assets (source: Worldscope).  \n\nNet Debt (Market)/Assets is defined as total debt minus cash over the sum of total debt (book) and the market value of equity (source: Worldscope).  \n\nLog Total Debt is defined as the natural logarithm of one plus total debt (source: Worldscope).  \n\nLog Long-term Debt is defined as the natural logarithm of one plus long-term debt (source: Worldscope).  \n\nROA (return on assets) is defined as earnings before interest and taxes over the book value of assets (source:Worldscope).  \n\nFirm Size is defined as the natural logarithm of total real assets (source: Worldscope).  \n\nTangibility is defined as net property, plant, and equipment, over the book value of assets (source: Worldscope).  \n\nMarket/Book is defined as the ratio of the market value of equity plus book value of debt over the book value of debt plus equity (source: Worldscope).  \n\n### A.2 Country-level variables  \n\nGDP growth rate is the real annual growth rate in gross domestic product (GDP) (source: IMF Database).  \n\nGDP per capita is GDP in thousands of U.S. Dollars devided by total population (source: IMF Database).  \n\nCreditor Rights is an indicator that measures creditor power and scores between zero and four (source: Djankov, McLiesh, and Shleifer 2007).  \n\nUnion Density is the ratio of union membership divided by employment (source: OECD).  \n\nUnemployment Rate is the ratio of unemployment divided by labor force (source: OECD).  \n\nCentralization Indicator is an indicator of bargaining centralization that scores between one and five. It is increasing in the degree of centralization. A value of one means that bargaining is at the company/plant level, and a value of five means that central-level agreements at the country-level are of overriding importance (source: OECD).  \n\nIncome Inequality is the Gini indicator of income inequality (source: Deininger and Squire Database of Income Inequality).  \n\nRecession Indicator takes a value of one if there are two consecutive quarters with negative gdp growth in a country and zero otherwise (source: OECD).  \n\nMiller Tax Index is computed as 1 - [(1 - corporate tax rate)-(1 - personal dividend rate) /( 1- personal interest rate)] (source: Faccio and $\\mathrm{Xu}$ (Forthcoming)).  \n\nRule of Law Indicator takes values between zero and one and characterizes legal enforcement in different countries (source: International Country Risk).  \n\n## Appendix B: Labor Law Reforms  \n\nWe searched a number of sources, listed below each country for changes in labor laws in the twenty-one countries of our sample over the 1985-2007 period. Mainly, we focus on changes in the procedural requirements that need to be followed when firing an employee with a regular employment contract, the notice and severance pay requirements, the prevailing standards of (and penalties for) “unfair” dismissals, the conditions under which temporary contracts can be offered, the maximum number of successive renewals and the maximum cumulated duration of these contract, the notification requirements provided by law in case of collective dismissals and the associated delays and costsfor the employers.  \n\nAustralia: A reform was passed in 2005 with a significant reduction of the concept and applicability of unfair dismissal. The Workplace Relations Amendment Bill removed protection against unfair dismissal for employees employed in firms with less than 100 employees. Employees of larger firms were also affected as unfair dismissal can no longer be claimed for reasons that include genuine operational reasons. Source: Vranken (2011).  \n\nAustria: There were two changes in EPL. A 1988 law increased the protection of workers with temporary contracts. In particular, the law changed the conditions under which the employees are placed at the disposal of third parties. It also outlawed agreements that are at the disadvantage of the employee. A reduction in EPL happened in 2003. The main reform was the introduction of private job placement agencies to offer services as temporary work agencies. This facilitated the development of the market for temporary workers. Sources: LABREF, OECD.  \n\nBelgium: The main change was the Employment Law of 1998. This law was prompted by the closure of a plant by Renault in 1997. Hence, it became known as the Renault law. The plant closure was sudden and unexpected. The law introduced a procedure to inform workers and enable labor negotiations in case of mass layoffs or plant closures. In particular, the law introduced the obligation of employers to consult with workers representatives and to analyze and formally respond to any proposals from workers representatives. Source: ILO.  \n\nCanada: There was no change in EPL according to all our sources and direct searches. Source:ILo.  \n\nDenmark: The main change in EPL was in 1990 with the deregulation of temporary work agencies (TWAs). Danish law now provides free entitlement to establishing and operating TWAs. This reform significantly expanded the use of temporary work contracts. Source: EIRO.  \n\nFinland: There was no major change in EPL according to our sources and direct searches. Source: fondazione Rodolfo De Benedetti (fRDB).  \n\nFrance: There were two reforms that increased EPL during this period. In 1990, a law imposed restrictions on firing. Collective redundancies must be accompanied by“social plans\"(such as early retirement schemes, retraining contracts, etc.). The drawing of social plans is compulsory for firms with more than fifty employees, where ten or more people are to be made redundant over a 30-day period. All eligible individuals dismissed for economic reasons are offered a retraining contract. Employers are obliged to state in all cases the reason for dismissal, even when not requested by the employee. All eligible individuals dismissed for economic reasons are offered a retraining contract, jointly financed by the state and the companies. If the employer does not correctly follow the formalities, then the employer must pay the employee one month's wages in compensation. In 1993, a law transferred further powers to the public administration in drafting the social plans. If there is no social plan, or the measures proposed are inadequate, then the redundancies will be considered null and void. Workers representatives must be consulted about the plan before the notice of termination is issued. The plan must also be submitted to the Departmental Labor Inspectorate, which may propose changes if it considers the measures to be taken insufficient. Source: Bertola et al. (1999), fRDB.  \n\nGermany: EPL's main reform occured in 1997. Legal conditions covering dismissals were relaxed. The size threshold for dismissal protection was doubled. In the event of redundancies, employers have to take into consideration stricter social selection criteria: for example, age, length of service, or the family situation of the employee must be taken into account. Temporary contracts were fully liberalized. In the Labor Placement Act, the renewal period for fixedterm contracts was extended and the admissible frequency of renewals was increased.Source: OECD,fRDB.  \n\nGreece: A reform occured in 1988 to harmonize Greek legislation with the European Council Directive of 14 February 1977 (77/187/CEE). The law specified what are the rights and obligations of the new owner of the firm, which were less clear and thus less restrictive before. It also increased the protection accorded to collective contracts (Respect of collective contracts - Presidential Decree n.572).Source: Natlex.  \n\nIreland: Areform was passed in 2003, but we decided that the change is not of similar importance to the rest, and thus we do not report it. Source: Labref and OECD.  \n\nItaly: There were two important changes during this period. In 1991, a law on collective redundancies was passed. The employer has the duty to inform union representatives about the reasons for the proposed layoffs. In particular, the employer needs to show the unions that it is not possible totake alternative measures to the intended dismissals.The employer alsoneedsto describe the measures that are planned to mitigate the social consequences of the collective dismissal. The unions may request an examination of the reasons for the layoffs and the possibilities of utilizing the workforce in different ways within the firm. If the parties fail to reach an agreement, the next step is a conciliation phase conducted by the Labor Office. Failure to follow the procedure properly is penalized by the obligation to reinstate the employees who have thus been dismissed unlawfully. In 1998, there was a reduction in EPL through a deregulation of temporary contracts. Agencies were created to carry out the activities of selection, employment, and placement of temporary workers. “Atypical” contracts were encouraged and the automatic transformation of fixed-term contracts into open-end ones was removed (Law 24/06/1997 n.196. \"Treu Package\"). Source: fRDB,EIRO.  \n\nJapan: There was no change in EPL according to all our sources and direct searches. Source:ILo.  \n\nNetherlands: There were two reforms, both of which decreased employment protection. In 1988, requirements for dismissals were eased for cases of bankruptcy. Companies no longer need to get authorization for dismissals from the Public Employment Office. In 1999, the Flexibility and Security Act was passed. The aim of the law was to provide more room to extend the duration of fixed-term contracts, to strengthen the legal position of temporary workers and stand-by workers and to allow for temporary contracts to be used over a longer period. Moreover, in 1999, procedures for dismissal on economic, technical, and organizational grounds were shortened and simplified. Once a dismissal permit has been granted, the employer can give notice of termination. The new law shortens and simplifies notice. At least one month's notice must be given, and the maximum term of notice will be four months (before it was six months). Source: EIRO,fRDB, OECD.  \n\nNew Zealand: There was no change in EPL according to all our sources and direct searches. Source:OECD.  \n\nNorway: In 1994, reforms introduced the use of contracted labor and temporary employment. Temporary working agencies were also deregulated and their scope was extended. The duration of temporary work contracts was also increased. Source: OECD.  \n\nPortugal: EPL increased in 1989. Part-time employees were given the same contractual rights as full-time employees (among them, the right to claim for unfair dismissal). Moreover, regulations were introduced with respect to the conditions governing the application of fixed-term contracts. In 1991, a labor reform had the effect of decreasing EPL. Firing restrictions were eased, through a wider range of admissible layoffs. For instance, dismissals for unsuitability were authorized. Source:OECD.  \n\nSpain: The major change occured in 1994. This reform saw the amendment of many of the pre-existing labor laws (the Workers’ Statute, the Labor Procedure Act and the Labor Offences and Sanctions Act) and the adoption of a number of new laws. The major aspects of the reform are the following: (l) the public monopoly of job placement was lifted to allow the operation of private employment agencies and temporary work agencies, (2) there was a reduction of the costs of individual dismissal (for instance, there was a restriction of the number of cases in which employees are awarded compensation in case of dismissal), and (3) there was also a relaxation of the rules governing collective dismissals. For example, the legally acceptable reasons for collective dismissals have been extended to include production and organizational changes in order to guarantee the future viability of the firm. Source: ILO, fRDB.  \n\nSweden: In 1993, temporary contracts were deregulated, permitting temporary work agencies to operate. The reform also amended the Employment Protection Act, allowing firms to decide more fexibly whether to retain workers of their own choice in redundancy situations (i.e., the last-in-first-out rule was relaxed). A further reduction in EPL happened in 1997. Since the reform, firms'rehiring obligations vis-a-vis dismissed workers expire after nine months (instead of twelve). Twelve-month fixed-term contracts are available with no restrictions and can be extended up to 18 months. The criteria determining the length of notice periods were also relaxed. Source: OECD, Natlex,fRDB.  \n\nSwitzerland: An increase in EPL happened in 1994. New provisions on collective redundancies apply to an employer if at least $10\\%$ of the workforce are dismissed. The employer has an obligation to give advance notice to employees or their representatives of the collective redundancy and the reasons for it. The representatives may make proposals on how the dismissals could be avoided or reduced but cannot block the dismissals. After consultation with employees or their representatives, the employer has to notify the cantonal employment office of the intended redundancies and the results of the consultation process. The sanctions for failure to consult will be fixed by a judge and may not exceed an amount equal to twice the employee's monthly salary. Source: Practical Law.  \n\nUnited Kingdom: There was no major change in EPL according to our sources and direct searches.Source:fRDB.  \n\nUnited States: There was an increase in EPL in 1989. The WARN Act was a federal law that required employers to give written notice of 60 days, before the date of a mass layoff or plant closing, to affected workers, the chief elected official of the local government where the employment site is located, and the State Rapid Response Dislocated Worker Unit. Subject to the law are private employers with 100 or more full-time employees. In the case of noncompliance, employees, their representatives, and units of local government can bring lawsuits against employers. Employers who violate the WARN Act are liable for damages in the form of back pay and benefits to affected employees.Source: Levine (2007).  \n\n# References  \n\nAbowd, J. M. 1989.

It is the result of a multi-year project, launched to understand and analyze how large corporations are contributing to inequality trends. As the dominant actors of the US [and global) economy, large corporations influence how and where economic output is generated and distributed, and they play a critical role in shaping global and domestic inequality. Their impact on inequality is neither accidental nor peripheral but rather intricately linked to their core business models and strategies.  \n\nAssessing the inequality \"footprint\" of individual companies is an inherently complex endeavor. Our framework attempts to find a middle ground between embracing this complexity while keeping the data manageable, and useful for interested stakeholders. Taking a holistic approach, we apply a variety of inequality lenses [economic, social, political, environmental) and analyze different assessment levels [policy, performance, disclosure]. The result is a holistic Corporate Inequality Framework (CiF) that analyzes corporations across 78 indicators divided into four pillars:  \n\nPEOPLE: The \"people\" dimension of this framework examines how equitably a company treats the people it impacts, especially those most vulnerable and marginalized. It examines if a company pays a living wage, if its workforce demographics across job functions reflect the social diversity of the US, if it pays women and men equally, if it ensures safety in the workplace, and the degree to which it respects human rights.  \n\nPoWER: The interests of a corporation's decisionmakers shape its inequality footprint. Key areas of power assessed by this framework include a company's governance and decision making, the ability of its workers to bargain collectively, companies' competitive behavior, and how it exercises political influence.  \n\nPROFITs: Profits-namely, how they are made and where they go-represent the elephant in the room when it comes business and inequality. In our framework, we consider three dimensions: CE0 pay (both in terms of how much and in what way CEOs are paid), shareholder payouts, and tax practices.  \n\nPLANET: Corporations are major contributors to climate change, which is a major driver of inequality. This pillar assesses a company's commitment to and progress towards a net-zero economy, its Just Transition efforts, and its wider environmental impact by assessing its environmental justice performance.  \n\nThe findings and learnings from this pilot run of the Corporate Inequality Framework are manifold. Some of the overarching takeaways include:  \n\n### 1. Corporations perform poorly across issue areas critical to tackling inequality.  \n\nIn our baseline analysis of corporate policies and practices relevant to inequality, we found sobering results. Less than $5\\%$ of companies are committed to paying a living wage, while only a handful publish pay equity data. Across companies and sectors, women and people of color are overrepresented in low-wage categories and underrepresented in corporate leadership positions. Shareholder payouts, along with CE0 pay, have risen to record levels in the aftermath of the CoviD-19 crisis. And instead of leading the way towards a low carbon future, few corporations have set net-zero targets. On average corporations in our sample actually increased their emissions by $3\\%$ between 2020 and 2021.  \n\n### 2. Gaps in disclosure limit holistic and reliable assessments of corporate inequality contributions.  \n\nBecause companies' public disclosure on inequality-relevant indicators remains limited, we encountered many roadblocks in our analysis due to prevailing data gaps. Across issues areas-from labor practices to political engagements to tax strategies-corporations enjoy significant leeway around whether and in what form to disclose relevant information. There is an urgent need to strengthen and expand corporate disclosure if we want to be better able to track and hold corporations accountable for their inequality performance.  \n\n![](images/4120e004c623abc9d0c216ec6a2b1f59f0a125972378a368fa2dbda51dfb3431.jpg)  \n\n### 3. Corporate policies do not necessarily lead to improved performance.  \n\nIn recent years, there have been growing calls for corporations to adopt policy commitments on issues relevant for curbing inequality. However, our analysis finds that the existence of a corporate policy is not a reliable predictor of improved corporate performance. Companies with DEl policies are not necessarily more diverse. Companies with responsible lobbying policies do not spend less on lobbying. And companies with net-zero commitments are not more likely to reduce their emissions. On the other hand, however, corporate policies do appear to curb certain types of corporate violations. For example, companies with policies in support of workers' right of collective bargaining are less likely to engage in anti-union behavior, while companies with strong DEl policies are less likely to be cited for EEO violations.  \n\n### 4. There is a need for sector-specific analyses.  \n\n![](images/b96fb7a2ecbc0a09c1e527c51f06107bcf5ae070fc3ca96f1abe25d559b071db.jpg)  \n\nThere are windows of opportunity to   \nchange course   \nand invest in   \nanew economic   \nparadigm that   \ncreates value   \nnot just for   \nshareholders   \nbut workers,   \ncommunities and the planet.  \n\nThe findings of our pilot assessment highlight sector-specific differences across topics. For example, the retail industry stands out on workplace equity; tech and pharma companies on tax practices; and oil and transportation sectors on GHG emissions. These sector-specific findings are rooted in key differences between companies' business models and the impacts that their products and services have on inequality. Our sector-agnostic framework is not designed to assess sector-specific business models and product impacts. Going forward, we recommend complementing our universal framework with sectorspecific deep dives.  \n\nOverall, the findings of our analysis paint a concerning picture of corporate America's impacts on inequality. US companies wield tremendous power in the global economy and through their current actions, are driving inequitable outcomes for their stakeholders on both an organizational and societal level.  \n\nHowever, there are windows of opportunity to change course and invest in a new economic paradigm that creates value not just for shareholders but workers, communities, and the planet. Through this analysis, we hope to help identify key areas of change for both driving more equitable outcomes and curbing the corporate practices that have massively contributed to rising inequality.  \n\n## 1.INTRODUCTION  \n\n### Putting the inequality spotlight on corporations  \n\nIn recent years, rising inequality has emerged as one of the most urgent systemic risks of our time.l Leaders from across the public and private sectors-including investors, policy makers, and corporate executives alike-are increasingly focused on the impacts of inequality and many are looking to understand how particular companies may be linked to or even driving this trend.  \n\nAs a whole, the private sector plays a crucial role when it comes to inequality, generating the dominant share of household incomes at the national level. Companies drive the distribution of this income, impacting broader trends with how they compensate their employees, distribute profits to shareholders, or pay suppliers. And due to their significant size and wide reach, large US corporations have a particularly outsized impact on the global economy.  \n\nBut beyond income distribution, there are many indirect ways through which a company can shape inequality trends at the societal level. For example, a company's political influence can shape government policy and its tax practices can impact income redistribution and the provision of public services for lower income groups.  \n\nInequality is a far-reaching and systemic challenge, but in order to begin to address its impacts, we need to look beneath the macro level and consider the variables that shape individual companies' \"inequality footprint.\" This footprint is driven by many factors, such as whether a company pays its workers a living wage, whether it compensates men and women equally, whether the company pays its fair share of tax or and whether the C-suite is incentivized to invest in the company's workforce or extract returns for shareholders.  \n\nEach of these elements are important to evaluate when thinking about the link between business and inequality, but assessed in isolation, they provide a limited picture of a company's inequality footprint. To date, few studies have grappled with this question in a systematic and holistic manner. A literature review conducted as part of this project found that there are few existing frameworks that look holistically at how companies contribute to inequality. The few frameworks that do exist have limited alignment or even overlap.  \n\nWith this report, Oxfam seeks to build awareness among corporate, investment, and government leaders of the many ways that inequality is shaped at the company level. Our paper identifies and analyzes a variety of mechanisms companies have at their disposal to exacerbate or mitigate inequality and proposes a comprehensive framework to assess a company's inequality footprint. Next it applies that framework  \n\n![](images/03c1299aec62efe2ecdb2b90a29d27d14638dc7e9aa17af09a72186f54016a04.jpg)  \n\nThe private sector plays a crucial role when it comes to inequality, generating the dominant share of household incomes atthe national level.  \n\n![](images/8c282a86c42bc8054e0196c8ea934c723347a5728e81f1892016bf843cec4f09.jpg)  \n\nOur framework   \ndissects the   \nrelationship   \nbetween individual companies'   \npractices and   \ntheir inequality   \nimpacts as a   \nstarting point for building stronger accountability   \nmechanisms.  \n\nby analyzing the 200 largest US corporations, to better understand how their individual practices and strategies are actively contributing to inequality today.  \n\nThe conversation around business and inequality is still in a relatively early stage, and in order to move forward with effective policy solutions, we need to establish a common understanding, framework, and agenda to assess the current state of this issue. Our framework dissects the relationship between individual companies′ practices and their inequality impacts as a starting point for building stronger accountability mechanisms. By shining a light on the various ways through which the largest US corporations contribute to inequality, we hope to be able to engage companies, investors, and governments around potential pathways towards its reduction.  \n\nThis report is divided into four parts. In the first, we outline the relationship between corporations and inequality and explore why it's particularly important to focus on large corporations in the US context. The second part summarizes Oxfam's business-inequality framework, including its underlying rationale, design principles, and assessment approach. Third, we present the framework in more detail, including an explanation of measurement areas and findings from our pilot run. Each topic in this section is divided into three categories: why it matters, what we assessed, and what we found. The last section articulates recommendations for future actions, both on the standardsetting and policy front.  \n\n## 2. LINKING BUSINESS AND INEQUALITY  \n\n### Rising inequality in the US  \n\nInequality is one of the defining issues of our time. The growing divide between rich and poor over the past four decades is destroying our social fabric, polarizing our politics, and trapping millions of Americans in poverty. Since the 1970s, the richest $1\\%$ of Americans have seen their share of the national income nearly double, while the bottom $50\\%$ have experienced the reverse. We see the same trend with wealth inequality as the fortunes of the richest Americans skyrocket, despite Close to $40\\%$ of Americans saying they are unable to cover a $\\$400$ emergency expense.?  \n\n![](images/653d5f45fa7724dd8041c4adcebd665409613952294b007ed9958685f3f55752.jpg)  \nFigure l: Income inequality in the US (1980 - 2022)  \n\n![](images/d0c9c4d4031ef277046e06505b74b2ca3bfd9e1a5053f075141a844a18d134bb.jpg)  \nFigure 2: Wealth inequality in the US (1980 - 2022)  \n\nFor every Sl of wealth currently owned by white families, Black and Hispanic families on average own about 24 cents.  \n\nEven as we see the CoviD-l9 pandemic and recent inflation spike wane, the inequality crisis in the US persists. In fact, CoVID-19 only hammered home the profound inequities of our economic model, allowing wealthy corporations and individuals to amass profits in a time of crisis while leaving the vast majority of Americans vulnerable to economic disaster.3 Americans are currently contending with a cost of living crisis, with those living in poverty hit hardest as they tend to spend a higher proportion of their incomes on necessities, such as groceries, gas, and housing.\" A recent study found that in the context of rising grocery prices, wealthier Americans spend $3.5\\%$ of their income on groceries while low-income earners spend $25\\%$ S.  \n\nMeanwhile, the wealth held by US billionaires has grown by $\\$1$ trillion since 2019, despite the pandemic and recent economic crisis.6 In contrast, between 2021 and 2022,7 the US poverty rate saw its largest one-year increase in history, erasing progress made by government safety net programs, such as Economic Impact Payments and expanded child tax credit.8 As a result, post-tax income inequality increased by $3.2\\%$ during that time.9  \n\nSince the richest Americans are predominantly white and male, and people living in poverty are disproportionately women and people of color,1° economic inequality is closely coupled with social and racial injustice in the US. The significant racial wealth gap has remained unchanged in the past two decades.ll For every Sl of wealth currently owned by white families, Black and Hispanic families on average own about 24 cents. Similarly, while we have seen gradual improvement, racial and gender pay gaps persist among Us workers. Women of color continue to suffer the most severe gender wage gaps in the US, with Hispanic and Black women earning just 65 cents and 70 cents respectively for every $\\$1$ earned by white, non-Hispanic men in 2022.12  \n\n### The dominance of large corporations  \n\nThere are lots of losers in the post-CoViD US economy but there is one clear winner: large corporations. Over the past decade, and especially since 2020, they have become more powerful and profitable than ever before, with the value of S8P 500 companies [measured in market cap) nearly quadrupling from $\\$10.3$ trillion in September 2012 to $\\$40$ trillion in December 2023.13 Similarly, Fortune 500 revenues and profits have grown significantly between 2014 and 2022, and particularly since 2020, with revenues rising by $\\$4.3$ billion between 2020 and 2022. From 2020 to 2021 alone, these 500 companies almost doubled their profits by close to $\\$1$ trillion.14  \n\n### Growing concentration of market power and profits  \n\nConcentration of corporate power has been a cornerstone of the US economy since its industrialization. Starting in the 1gth century, monopolies like Standard Oil, US Steel, and American Tobacco dominated important industrial sectors, wielding vast economic power and influencing prices and market conditions, often at the expense of workers, competitors, and consumers. Like today, these monopolies were founded and led by ultra-wealthy individuals whose aggressive business strategies allowed them to amass incredible fortunes. 15  \n\nToday, the largest US corporations continue to consolidate their economic power. Over time, major US sectors have become increasingly monopolized by a handful of giant corporations,16 with higher concentration in turn cementing the dominant position of leading firms and increasing their profitability and market power.17 In several of the largest US industries, juggernauts concentrate market share, revenues, and profits among ever fewer actors. We see this in the tech sector in particular, with leading firms including Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon each valued at more than $\\$1$ trillion.18  \n\nThanks to their astonishing size and power, these companies are able to capture an ever-increasing share of profits, with the vast majority of corporate profits incurred by a small number of highly profitable companies. As of 2023, the top $1\\%$ of US corporations own $97\\%$ of corporate assets in the US, while the even more select $0.1\\%$ owns $88\\%$ of the nation's corporate assets.19 Similarly, the top $10\\%$ of US corporations earn $95\\%$ of all corporate profits-the highest level since the early 1970s.20 In other words, a very small number of dominant firms in various industries are accruing an immense share of profits and market control.  \n\nConcentration is also visible at the top of the corporate echelon. Take the Fortune 500, which represents the largest US corporations by revenue. The top 10 of the Fortune 500 make up $20\\%$ of revenues while the top 200 companies (i.e. our sample) account for $85\\%$ Of the Fortune $500^{\\prime}\\mathrm{{S}}$ revenues and $70\\%$ Of profits.21  \n\nCorporate concentration also has repercussion on US labor markets as more and more Americans are working for large employers. Very large employers [10, ${\\mathtt{O O O}}+$ employees] employ close to $30\\%$ Of the US workforce, leading to outsized impacts on the average American worker.22  \n\n![](images/29ced3cc0b9cc2b1f2d2b046588bbe0462168e63d56b88a8da722ee5633112c6.jpg)  \n\nThe top l% of US corporations own $97\\%$ of corporate assets in the US.  \n\n#### Box 1: Size matters: Amazon and Walmart  \n\nAmazon and Walmart are the largest US companies measured by both revenue and number of employees. These two companies alone earned a combined $\\$1.1$ trillion in revenues in 2022 and together would be the $17^{\\mathrm{th}}$ largest country in the world.23 They employ a combined 3.2 million workers in the US, meaning that every $50^{\\dag\\mathfrak{h}}$ US worker is employed either by Amazon Or Walmart.  \n\nTheir dominance in the US economy makes these two companies both symbols of and contributors to national inequality trends. With most jobs offered by these two companies paying less than $\\$20$ per hour $[87\\%$ of jobs for Amazon and $91\\%$ for Walmart), the fruits of their economic success are not reaching their average worker.24 Median salaries for both companies (\\$27,136 for Walmart25 and $\\$34,19526$ for Amazon in 2022) are within a stone's throw of the US poverty line for a family of four.27  \n\nIn contrast, the two companies' main owners (Jeff Bezos for Amazon and the Walton family for Walmart) are multi-billionaires who have managed to significantly increase their wealth over the past few years. The fortune of the Walton family has increased by $\\$137$ billion since 2016 t0 $\\$267$ billion in early 2024. Jeff Bezos wealth has increased by \\$145 billion during the same period to $\\$190.2$ billion in early 2024.28  \n\nThe owners of Amazon and Walmart have benefitted from the companies' generous shareholder payouts. In 2022, both companies combined spent $\\$15$ billion in stock buybacks. Walmart has paid out $121\\%$ of its net profits to its shareholders over the past five years (\\$68.3 billion in dividends and stock buybacks combined).  \n\n### An extractive corporate model  \n\nCorporate growth might pose fewer problems if workers and other stakeholders had a stake and say in this growth [and if this growth stayed within more reasonable boundaries). Unfortunately, the opposite has been the case, with both worker voice and income dwindling in recent decades. Unions have declined in the ${\\sf U S}^{29}$ andso has workers' share of corporate income, particularly since the 2000s.30 Many major companies have restructured their business models to outsource and subcontract jobs, making work more precarious for millions of Americans.31  \n\nDeclining worker power is rooted in the dominant paradigm of shareholder primacy, which aims to extract value from corporations for the short-term benefit of shareholders and executives. This comes at the expense of a company's other stakeholders-including its workers, the communities it impacts, and the planet-by reducing resources available for long-term investments in productive capabilities, such as a company's labor force and a low-carbon future.32  \n\nBecause shareholder returns tend to reward the wealthiest Americans, shareholder primacy exacerbates inequality. Share ownership in the US is highly concentrated among the richest $10\\%$ of Americans, who Own $84\\%$ of allU.S. stocks (compared to the bottom $50\\%$ whoownonly $1\\%$ .3 Shareholder primacy is also associated with other key drivers  \n\nof inequality, including the weakening of workers' collective bargaining power, climate change, and aggressive tax strategies.34 Holistically analyzing these diverse drivers is the focus of Oxfam's assessment framework.  \n\nOur analysis of financial data for the 200 largest US corporations offers a striking illustration of shareholder primacy. Corporate profits, their stock market value and CE0 pay are outpacing the growth of median salaries and employment numbers between 2018 and 2022. Thus, corporate profits are fueling economic inequality rather than tackling it.  \n\n![](images/a5c49955dab0e993efd8b671ef0b7ed69d3fd3f630b103aff9df2fa4e5a544f5.jpg)  \nFigure 3: Relative growth of profits, shareholder payouts and worker-relatedexpenses(2018-2022)  \n\n## 3. 0XFAM'S BUSINESS-INEQUALITY FRAMEWORK  \n\nOxfam's business-inequality framework looks across four pillarspeople, power, profits, and planet-and consists of 15 topics that are broken down further into 78 indicators. The framework has been several years in the making. Starting with a literature review on existing business-inequality frameworks, we commissioned a more in-depth analysis across a targeted set of inequality-relevant issues.  \n\n![](images/a0fdac92b8db46cb2a4cadefa7fc24e922f880ec45f203b277ba5b482f0dbca2.jpg)  \n\nAnalyses linking corporate practice and inequality have looked at individual aspects of the companyinequality relationship and have focused on companies' direct and internal inequality impacts.  \n\nResulting from this analysis, we developed an initial conceptual framework linking business and inequality and then operationalized this framework by developing a methodology that would allow us to assess individual companies' inequality footprint. Following a smallscale test run in 2022, we launched our first full pilot run in early 2023. Along the way, we consulted with internal and external experts and incorporated relevant feedback into our work.  \n\nIn this section, we describe the underpinning rationale and approach of our framework.  \n\n### Thinking holistically about inequality at the company level  \n\nThere is already a rich body of literature on the different forces that drive inequality in societies across the globe.35 However, there has been comparatively less attention paid to the ways in which inequality trends are fueled and reproduced by individual companies. Most existing analyses linking corporate practice and inequality have looked at individual aspects of the company-inequality relationship and have focused on companies' direct and internal inequality impacts (e.g. pay gaps or CEO-worker pay ratios). They provide a fragmented, incomplete picture and are insufficient to provide adequate guidance on the complex relationship between individual companies and inequality.  \n\n#### Box 2: Defining inequality  \n\nGiven the complex and multi-faceted nature of inequality, assessing corporate contributions requires to first develop a robust definition of inequality, its dimensions and scale. The variety of pathways through which companies can affect inequality means there are many potential starting points for developing a holistic framework. Here are four questions that serve as useful starting point to thinking about the link between companies and inequality:  \n\nInequality of what?36 Like human well-being, inequality is multi-dimensional. There are many expressions of inequality, from inequality between the rich and poor to inequalities that are based on aspects of identity such as gender, ethnicity or caste. Different dimensions of inequality often interrelate, becoming determining factors over a person's quality of life and shaping the societies we live in.  \n\nInequality of opportunity or outcome? Another important distinction is between inequality of opportunity vs. inequality of outcomes. While they are often used as alternatives, they in fact are two sides of the same coin.37 At a company level, inequality of opportunity can relate to a company's policies and practices [e.g. hiring or promotion], which in turn affects inequality in outcomes [e.g. workforce demographics, pay equity).  \n\nInequality between whom? Inequality is based on the comparison between groups. Corporations can affect inequality between a variety of stakeholder groups inside and outside its organizational boundaries. These can include employees, shareholders, consumers, community members or supply chain workers.  \n\nAssessing the inequality \"footprint\" of individual companies is an inherently complex endeavor. First, the multiple dimensions of inequality make the identification of discrete impact areas difficult. Not only can companies impact the economic dimensions of inequality, they can also affect inequality between different social groups and shift their political participation, as well as drive environmental impacts that further deepen social and economic inequality. Second, a company can affect inequality through various business functions, including its employment practices, procurement strategies, or business model. Third, companies not only affect inequities within their organizational boundaries but also across their supply chains and within the broader societies they operate in.  \n\nBecause of the many mechanisms by which companies can potentially drive inequality, there are also many potential starting points for developing a holistic framework. Based on a review of the existing literature, we identified three distinct ways of structuring the link between companies and inequality:  \n\nBy business function: A company's inequality footprint is shaped by its different operations, practices, and functions. Four core business functions with a significant inequality impact are human resources, products and services, operations management, and firm management and corporate governance.38  \n\nBy sphere of influence: Companies shape inequality in more Or less direct ways depending on their spheres of influence. As a starting point, we can distinguish between inequality within the company's sphere of control (i.e. its operations), sphere of influence [e.g. its supply chain, its customers), and its sphere of concern (i.e. the broader socio-political sphere).  \n\nBy stakeholder group: The third way of distinguishing companies' inequality footprint is focused on the stakeholder groups that are being compared. Comparisons can include different groups of employees [e.g. CEO vs. low-wage; women vs. men; part-time vs. full-time), different corporate stakeholders [e.g. shareholders vs. employees), different consumer segments or communities, or the relationship between the company and other actors in the value chain.  \n\n![](images/edceb0e1a5d189bad67d0d709bbd92ff6dc9a9e352e8c2bc7f21ec0f83e81732.jpg)  \nFigure 4: Conceptualizing inequality at the company level  \n\n### Inequality as a lens, not another ESG issue  \n\nBecause there are multiple, complex links between corporations and inequality, it's not possible to treat inequality as just another ESG issue that can be measured by one or two key indicators. Instead, inequality should be treated as a lens through which to assess a company's broader social impact. An inequality lens requires a more relational view on social issues, focusing on the ways that powerful companies impact the capacity of less powerful stakeholders to thrive. Inequality thus poses a more fundamental challenge to companies that goes to the heart of how they generate value, what their business model looks like, and how they distribute scarce financial resources among their myriad stakeholders.  \n\nAssessing these issues in a truly holistic way requires identifying and categorizing the different linkages between corporate practices and inequality impacts. In taking this holistic approach, it's essential to apply and integrate a variety of inequality lenses focused on the treatment of different groups (e.g. are men and women paid equally for the same jobs?), unequal relationships within the corporate hierarchy (e.g. what power do workers have vis-a-vis executives?), and inequality impacts beyond the boundary of the corporation (e.g. how does a company affect societal inequality through its tax or climate practices?).  \n\n### Oxfam's assessment approach: design principles  \n\nWe aim to find the middle ground by creating a balanced framework, which both respects the complex relationship between companies and inequality and keeps the data manageable, accessible, and useful for interested stakeholders.  \n\nBroad scope: We intentionally set a broad scope for this first iteration to ensure that it captures the various impact areas and pathways through which companies affect inequality. While not all indicators have the same level of relevance or will provide the same level of data, we believe a broad scope is needed in this first iteration in order to further focus the framework in the future.  \n\nUniversality: The framework encompasses a wide-ranging list of indicators, not all of which are relevant to the same degree across sectors. While the framework aims to identify relevant impact areas that exist across sectors, we acknowledge that companies in different sectors affect inequality through different pathways. Sector-specific analyses are therefore recommended in future iterations  \n\nStructured by impact areas: We chose to organize the framework by impact areas (rather than business function or stakeholder group) in order to emphasize the multi-dimensional nature of inequality. These dimensions build on Oxfam's  \n\n![](images/d071b53b0bd075eb539337be475c35909875a241daf0815031861077318578b4.jpg)  \n\nAn inequality lens requires a more relational view on social issues, focusing on the ways that powerful companies impact the capacity of less powerful stakeholders to thrive.  \n\n#  \n\nInequality forces companies to grapple with issues of fairness and social justice.  \n\nprevious framing of companies' inequality relationship-people, power, and profits.39  \n\nGoing beyond the corporate policy level: While corporate policy change represents an important starting point for addressing inequality, we aim to assess corporate practice and performance where possible. We assess companies' inequality footprint at four different levels:  \n\nDisclosure - a company's transparency regarding its inequality-related practices and impacts Policy - a company's public commitment to address key inequality impact areas Performance - a company's actual accomplishments or shortcomings, as evidenced by internal management practices, metrics, KPls, and their results Violation - a company's violation of standards and practices considered relevant to addressing inequality  \n\nPreference for quantitative indicators and ratios: Where possible, we have developed indicators that provide a quantifiable picture of companies' inequality footprint. Also, given the relational nature of inequality, we have tried to identify ratios where available.  \n\nFocus on negative inequality impacts: This methodology is primarily concerned with assessing if and how companies are driving increases in inequality (i.e. their negative impact). While we recognize the positive contributions companies can make to reversing inequality trends through their practices, we follow a human rights-based approach, which emphasizes the priority to first \"do no harm\" and that negative impacts cannot be offset by positive contributions in another category.  \n\n### Scoring/benchmarking  \n\nInequality forces companies to grapple with issues of fairness and social justice as they face ongoing decisions around who gets which piece of the pie. These distributional questions are not easy to grapple with for companies because they can clash with cultural norms around the merits of free markets, competition, and win-win solutions. Furthermore, the ethical dimension of inequality is not only subjective but also contested. While for some, inequality represents a clear social injustice, for others it might seem acceptable, inevitable, or even normal at certain levels. Contrary to other human rights issues with a clearer demarcation of right and wrong, developing benchmarks for inequality requires a more deliberative process that considers all affected stakeholders.  \n\nIn this first iteration, we refrained from defining concrete benchmarks for every indicator, especially those at the performance level, as further, more substantive discussion is required to determine what good practice should look like. We did however include benchmarks for areas where Oxfam has a long-standing history working on the  \n\nissue area [e.g. tax havens, living wage). For all other indicators, we focused on questions of data availability, policy, and performance in absolute terms. The goal is to provide a baseline upon which to specify assessment indicators and benchmarks, providing the groundwork for benchmarking in future iterations.  \n\nWe also refrained from developing aggregate scores across indicators for individual companies, which would require weighing different indicators against each other. Instead, we focus in this first iteration on aggregating indicator-specific scores across companies to identify cross-company patterns.  \n\n### Company sample  \n\nWe opted for a sector-agnostic sampling approach by taking size (measured by revenue] as our primary determinant for company selection. Given the higher level of disclosure requirements for public companies, we selected the 200 largest public US companies (i.e. companies headquartered in the US) as our primary sample, based on the Fortune 500 list from 2022.  \n\nOur sector-agnostic sampling approach limited the utility of sectorspecific indicators and instead geared us towards a universal framework applicable across a wide variety of sectors. Still, not all indicators included in our framework are equally applicable to or relevant for each company or sector in our sample.  \n\n#### Data collection and sources  \n\nThere is a lack of data available on or disclosed by companies, making it especially challenging to analyze corporate impacts on inequality [as well as many other issues]. Due to the obscurity of information on corporate practices—from workforce demographics to benefit offerings to tax practices-it is difficult to hold companies truly accountable on their inequality impacts. This tension is especially palpable for this project, as its ambition is to go beyond the policy level in its analysis.  \n\nGiven the significant data gaps inherent in assessing a company's inequality footprint, we took a pragmatic approach to collecting relevant information. While remaining committed to using only publicly disclosed information, the source of the information takes two forms:  \n\nCompany disclosure: Our primary data source is companies' own disclosure through their financial statements, government disclosure requirements [e.g. SEC), corporate websites, and sustainability reports.  \n\nExisting benchmarks and databases:4 We also draw on data collected by existing benchmarks, scorecards, and databases that cover similar indicators and track corporate policy and practice.  \n\n![](images/2271a34f9d0db896cea7265d16aab9edf6c6edd3ea04a9ded2cad0acf792c541.jpg)  \n\nThere is a lack   \nof data available on or disclosed   \nby companies,   \nmaking it   \nespecially   \nchallenging to   \nanalyze corporate impacts on   \ninequality. The idea of   \naccurately   \nassessing how   \na company   \naffects inequality is attractive   \nin theory, yet   \ncomplex in   \npractice.  \n\n![](images/310a1d180db00e49f687ec792c35561134ac2a6cc1cb87c17999d0dae3908384.jpg)  \n\nWe use existing indices in different ways. Some of them we use for their data, indicators, and scoring. Others we only use as a data source for our own indicators. Utilizing existing benchmarks and data sources does not imply our full endorsement of their methodology but rather that these indices provide data with greater scope or accuracy than we could collect ourselves.  \n\nThe absence of relevant information is not only a challenge but a driving force behind this project. Filling data gaps and strengthening transparency are two key objectives of our work, which is why we did not exclude certain indicators due to a lack of data, but instead identified them as \"push metrics\" to incentivize more robust corporate disclosures.  \n\nData collection commenced in April 2023 and was finalized in August 2023. To ensure consistency, data was collected for 202l since not all companies had yet disclosed their 2023 sustainability reports (containing data for 2022).  \n\n### Caveats and limitations  \n\nThe idea of accurately assessing how a company affects inequality is attractive in theory, yet complex in practice. The four main caveats of the current analysis are:  \n\nMultiple pathways: A company affects inequalities through multiple practice and impact areas. Assessing a company's inequality contributions across these areas provides a fragmented picture of many individual indicators that is not easily reconcilable into one score as it would require setting benchmarks and weighing different indicators against each Other.  \n\nSector-specificity: Companies' inequality contributions are sector-specific and dependent on particular business models followed by companies in a given industry. Aggregating data across companies from different sectors dilutes some of this sector-specificity [e.g. by mixing together low-wage and highwage sectors).  \n\nLong causal chains: Some inequality impacts are rather straightforward, such as the wages a company pays its workers (vs. its executives]. Other impact areas are more difficult to trace empirically back to individual companies, such as the effects of a company's lobbying efforts or tax practices on inequality.  \n\nSignificant data gaps: On issues of inequality, there is a lack of available data and data uniformity, preventing meaningful accountability on corporate inequality impacts but also making empirical assessments of individual companies' inequality footprints more difficult.  \n\nRole of products and services: One of the primary ways a company can affect inequality trends is through the goods or services it offers. Junk food, financial services, cars, tobacco, or social media platforms can all affect the social, political, and environmental dimensions of inequality. However, these impacts are sector- and industry-specific and do not lend themselves to a universal assessment framework like ours. This is why the fifth ${}^{\\prime\\prime}\\mathsf{P}^{\\prime\\prime}$ (products] is excluded from this first iteration.  \n\nGiven these caveats, any approach aiming to holistically assess a company's inequality footprint comes with limitations. However, as long as we remain conscious of these limitations and are transparent around how we manage them, we believe there is value in advancing a comprehensive lens on the business-inequality relationship.  \n\n### The 4P framework: An overview  \n\nAligned with Oxfam's organizational approach to inequality, this framework recognizes both the multidimensional and intersectional41 nature of the term. Inequality is not only an economic problem but also a political, social, and environmental one.  \n\nCompanies contribute to each of these dimensions, which is why the framework is divided into four pillars: people, power, profits, and planet. Each pillar consists of a set of topics and indicators. In total, the framework encompasses 4 pillars, 15 topics, and 78 indicators.  \n\n![](images/73942abf09fd6d1726ea5d6ac3ddeea55227833c98ce3103a8337878c86e933c.jpg)  \nFigure 5: The 4P framework at a glance  \n\n![](images/55bde1848853c63952b8f53af16e7740a4ce13c21369113bab8fff41e28ba2cc.jpg)  \n\nThe framework is tailored to the particular pathways through which companies affect inequality both within and outside of their organizational boundaries.  \n\nThe framework is tailored to the particular pathways through which companies affect inequality both within and outside of their organizational boundaries. It also reflects our understanding of the responsibility of business, which has evolved over time to include more indirect impacts [e.g. supply chain, political activities] beyond companies' own operations and core business models.  \n\n### PEOPLE  \n\nThis dimension aims to capture the social nature of inequality. In any society, the distribution of resources and opportunities favors certain social groups while disadvantaging others [e.g. along gender, racial, or class lines). The same is true for companies, whose stakeholders experience inequalities based on attributes of the different social identities they encompass.  \n\nThe \"people\" dimension of this framework examines how equitably a company treats the people it impacts, especially those most vulnerable and marginalized. It examines if a company pays a living wage, if its workforce demographics across job functions reflect the social diversity of the Us, if women and men are paid equally for the same job, the safety of its workplace, and the degree to which it respects human rights.  \n\n### POWER  \n\nInequality is not defined exclusively by economic differences between individuals and groups, but also by how these differences are maintained by certain interests and power structures. Power elucidates the political dimension of inequality.  \n\nA corporation's inequality footprint is shaped by the interests of those responsible for corporate decision making. Thus, for a company to have more equitable impacts, stakeholders across the corporate hierarchy need to possess the power to voice grievances, express their preferences, and shape corporate decision making.  \n\nPower can be an opaque concept that operates at many levels of an organization but is not always visible. Key areas of power assessed by this framework include a company's governance and decision making. the ability of its workers to bargain collectively, the way it exercises power in the marketplace (i.e. its competitive behavior), and how it exercises political influence.  \n\n### PROFITS  \n\nProfits-namely, how they are made and where they go-represent the elephant in the room when it comes business and inequality. To date, profits have been invisible in companies' sustainability agendas [apart from philanthropic giving]. But in an age of extreme economic inequality, it is no longer possible to ignore the question of how a company generates and distributes its revenues and profits.  \n\nThere are three dimensions to consider: first is the issue of CEO pay, both in terms of how much and in what way CEOs are paid. Second is the issue of profit distribution, including shareholder payouts and employee ownership. Third is a company's tax practices, including the use of tax havens and the resulting effective tax rate.  \n\n### PLANET  \n\nCorporations are major contributors to climate change,42 which is also a major driver of inequality. Through their business models and unsustainable behaviors, companies are contributing to climate change-driven inequality through the wider environmental impacts they create. Oftentimes, these impacts are disproportionately felt by marginalized and low-income communities of color who are more vulnerable to climate change and more impacted by air, water, soil, or noise pollution.  \n\nThis pillar assesses a company's commitment to and progress towards a net-zero economy. It also analyzes a company's Just Transition efforts and considers a company's wider environmental impact by assessing its environmental justice performance.  \n\n## 4. ASSESSING HOW THE LARGEST US CORPORATIONS ARE DRIVING INEQUALITY  \n\nThis chapter presents selected findings from the pilot assessment of the 200 largest US corporations. Our pilot assessment included several topics and indicators where data availability was limited, making the extent of findings varied between sections.  \n\n![](images/943b08b9748ec6f87cf979de30875827c82bf40d88b0ec8eeb603cc51dfab236.jpg)  \n\nLow and stagnant wages are critical drivers of US inequality, with more than 50 million Americans trapped in lowwage work, earning less than $\\$15$ per hour.  \n\n### Pillar l: People  \n\nThe people pillar is divided into five topics: wages, benefits, workplace equity, workplace safety, and human rights.  \n\n#### A. Living wages and pay equity  \n\n#### Why it matters  \n\nCorporate wage practices contribute to inequality in two major ways. First, companies can exacerbate vertical (or economic] inequality by paying low wages while at the same time granting lavish compensation packages to executives and managers. Second, companies can also exacerbate horizontal (or social inequality by paying some groups better than others. This might include discrepancies across employment type [e.g. full-time vs. part-time] or across racial and gender lines.  \n\nLow and stagnant wages are critical drivers of US inequality, with more than 50 million Americans trapped in low-wage work, earning less than S15 per hour.43 The perils of low-wage work have become further amplified as the cost of living continues to skyrocket.44 Without a meaningful federal minimum wage and strong unions to advocate on workers' behalf, wages are largely at the discretion of employers.  \n\nThrough their wage practices, corporations contribute not only to economic inequality but social inequality (i.e. inequality between social groups) as well. Racial and gender pay gaps among US workers have not changed much in the past two decades. Women continue to earn an average of $82\\%$ of what men earned.45 Women of color continue to suffer the most severe gender wage gap in the United States, with Hispanic and Black women having earned just 65 cents and 70 cents, respectively for every S1 earned by white, non-Hispanic men in 2022 [compared to white women who earned 83 cents to the dollar)].46  \n\nAs their workforces grow, companies have an increasingly outsized impact on the wages earned by millions of US workers. And with current wage practices already exacerbating inequality, the American workforce is increasingly at risk if those practices don't change.  \n\n#### What we assessed  \n\nPaying wages [and salaries] is the primary way that a company distributes income to one of its most important group of stakeholders-its employees. Low wages and inequitable wage practices can contribute significantly to a company's inequality footprint. In our assessment, we consider the role of wages both in terms of absolute levels [against a given threshold, i.e. living wage) and in relative terms (i.e. pay equity).  \n\nOn living wage, we assess companies at the policy, disclosure, and performance level. Policy commitments on living wage are a relevant starting point for companies to move towards paying higher wages. Next, we assess a company's disclosure regarding its living wage practices. Assessing a company's living wage practices and performance requires multiple data points to adequately conduct rigorous living wage calculations. In addition to evaluating starting hourly wages, it is also important to consider the number of hours worked per employee and potential credits for healthcare, retirement, or childcare benefits. Because companies are not required to publish this information, incorporating these disclosures into our analysis sets a much higher bar than looking just at currently mandated disclosures (i.e. median salary).  \n\nLastly, we assess a company's wage practices by comparing it to a living wage benchmark. Given the geographic fluctuation of living income benchmarks across the US, company-specific living wage benchmarks are necessary to assess a company's living wage practices. In the absence of public company-specific benchmarks, we use a national-level benchmark of \\$20 an hour (with consideration of retirement, childcare, and healthcare).47  \n\nAssessing companies' living wage performance takes our assessment a step further than most other living wage assessments, which either focus mostly on the policy (rather than performance) level or rely on company-internal information in their assessment.  \n\nWith regard to pay gaps, we distinguish between four types of pay gaps: racial and gender pay gaps as well as adjusted and unadjusted (or median] pay gaps. Adjusted pay gaps assess whether every employee earns equal pay for equivalent work (i.e. they statistically control for differences in education attainment, skills, seniority, job title, and other factors). Unadjusted pay gaps (or median pay gaps) calculate the ratio of the annual wage of one group vs. another (i.e. they consider the varying opportunities and choices employees have before they ever enter a corporation or bargain with an employer over a wage). Unadjusted pay gaps reveal broader societal factors that push women and people of color into lower-paying job positions and careers.  \n\n![](images/245fcd3cb0cfebf01f9cece6d06a74e5b0d26910f4581a48bd2b01db0eca19ce.jpg)  \n\nAssessing a company's living wage practices and performance requires multiple data points to adequately conduct rigorous living wage calculations.  \n\n#### What we found  \n\nOur assessment analyzed corporate wage practices across two primary dimensions: living wage and pay equity.  \n\n#### Living wage  \n\nPaying a living wage is a critical step in tackling rising inequality, especially in the context of the current cost of living crisis.48 The living wage movement has gained significant momentum in recent years, with many corporations grappling with their employees' need for higher wages to cover the local cost of living.49  \n\n![](images/229bac7576c4dfcb4274b897e0b8db466c6b4a29545598b24732e7d4f8c43b26.jpg)  \n\nOnly 10 companies (or $5\\%$ of our sample] have made public statements in support of paying a living wage to their employees.  \n\nHowever, corporate interest in living wage issues has not yet translated into concrete policy change or action. Only 10 companies (or $5\\%$ of our sample] have made public statements in support of paying a living wage to their employees. However, there are several caveats to even this low number. First, none of the 10 companies disclose their methodology or benchmark. In fact, there seems to be a lack of understanding around what the term \"living wage\" even means and how it is calculated (e.g. some companies conflate it with minimum wage and equal wages). Also, none of the companies that publicly support a living wage are from low-wage sectors, such as retail, making the issue a blind spot for the companies where a living wage is most needed.  \n\nNext, we examined if corporations are already paying a living wage without publicly committing to it. However, our ability to analyze corporations' actual wage practices was limited by significant data gaps. A rigorous calculation of a company's living wage performance requires several data points, including hours worked and credit for child and health care. It also requires setting a company-specific living wage benchmark, as these benchmarks differ significantly across US regions.  \n\nNone of the corporations we analyzed published sufficient information to rigorously calculate if the company is paying a living wage. While some companies have recently announced increases to their average starting hourly wage, these announcements have limited utility without information regarding workers' minimum (not average) starting wage, hours worked, and how current wage levels relate to a company's living wage benchmark.  \n\nThrough our own analysis of companies' disclosures and additional sources [e.g. job postings), we were able to determine the minimum starting pay for 67 companies. 37 of these companies stated that they respect minimum wage regulations, while only 30 companies actually disclosed their minimum starting wage. Among companies disclosing their starting wage, the estimated hourly pay was $\\$11.06,$ representing a close to $50\\%$ living wage gap.50 In terms of starting wage levels, there was no significant difference between the companies with a public statement in support of a living wage and the companies without.  \n\n#### Pay equity  \n\nIn the absence of mandatory pay equity disclosure requirements, our analysis focused on whether companies publicly share data on pay gaps [and if so, what type). We considered both gender and racial pay gaps and also distinguished between adjusted and unadjusted pay gaps.  \n\nOur analysis found that pay gap disclosure is not common practice among the largest US corporations. While more and more companies are analyzing their pay gaps, few are actually disclosing the results of their analyses.51 0nly 10 out of the 200 companies l $\\mathrm{~\\bar{~}5\\%~}$ Of the sample) disclosed some type of data on pay gaps (gender and race). Aggregating and comparing companies' pay equity performance is hampered by the lack of uniformity in reporting. Pay gap discloses are found to include different focus areas [race, gender), methodologies [adjusted, unadjusted] and geographic scales (US, global).  \n\nWhile the fact that some companies are publishing pay gaps highlights the feasibility of disclosing this type of data, there are two caveats. First, the companies that are currently disclosing their pay gaps are already at or near parity, with only one company disclosing a significant pay gap $(74\\%$ median gender pay gap]. Given the significant pay gaps that prevail in the US (esp. on median pay gaps), it's fair to say that disclosing companies are most likely outliers rather than the norm. Second, companies are disclosing pay gaps in binary categories [e.g. men vs. women, white vs. non-white], which blurs important nuances between groups and risks negating certain pay gaps [e.g. between different racial groups).  \n\n#### B.Benefits  \n\n#### Why it matters  \n\nHigher-earning workers are more likely than their lower-earning peers to have access to benefits through their employers-a disparity that further exacerbates inequality trends, as higher pay is compounded by better benefits. Benefits are thus closely linked to living wage, because for those earning a low wage, significant earnings are often allocated to benefit-related expenses [e.g. health care, childcare] if not provided for by their employer.  \n\nThe United States fares particularly poorly when it comes to benefits, particularly for low wage workers.52 From an inequality perspective, three of the most relevant benefits include health insurance, paid leave, and retirement benefits. Escalating health care costs are a key contributor to household debt, particularly for lower income families, further exacerbating US inequality.53 Skewed access to retirement savings also reinforces income inequality as many low-income workers lack access to an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan. While more than $90\\%$ of thetop $10\\%$ of households own retirement account assets, $84\\%$ in the lowest income quartile do not have such assets.54  \n\n![](images/538f731fdab3a0215b28a941e31afa2cbdf7583ef3b17aff355db02410ff82f7.jpg)  \n\nOnly 10 out of the 200 companies $15\\%$ of the sample) disclosed some type of data on pay gaps (gender and race).  \n\nBecause it can vary significantly across companies and the workers they employ, paid leave is another employer-provided benefit that can significantly impact inequality. Paid leave (including sick or parental leave] in the US is voluntary, making it a particularly pertinent factor since it is completely at the discretion of individual companies to offer it. The US is the only advanced economy that does not have a nationally mandated parental leave policy.55 Low wage workers are particularly Vulnerable with $61\\%$ of them not having access to paid sick time.56  \n\n![](images/0a8fcc698b6f84a48daeb1bbc15f4384cc733d6e8c3ac922a26327a9984fe496.jpg)  \n\nAssessing   \ncorporate benefit practices goes   \nbeyond the   \nquestion of   \nwhether or not a   \ncompany offers a certain benefit but also who exactly   \nhas access to   \nthese benefits.  \n\nIn the absence of federal laws mandating that employers provide the same benefit coverage to all employees, employers have significant discretion when structuring their benefits plans and are able to make distinctions among employee groups [e.g. based on position, full- or part-time status, etc.). Without federal mandates, it's especially critical to assess how employers manage their discretion to set benefits for employees.  \n\n#### What we assessed  \n\nWe focused our analysis on the benefits considered most relevant from an inequality perspective, including those that disproportionately impact women [e.g. paid sick, parental, and family leave and flexible work schedules) and those with strong material consequences for lowwage workers (i.e. healthcare benefits and medical debt, retirement benefits, and wealth creationJ.  \n\nAs a starting point, we assessed whether companies publish information indicating that they offer these different types of benefits. However, assessing corporate benefit practices goes beyond the question of whether or not a company offers a certain benefit. When assessing benefits through an inequality lens, it's important to consider who exactly has access to these benefits [e.g. full-time vs. non-full-time workers] and the quality of those benefits [e.g. co-pays in health care plan, length of paid leave).  \n\nBecause of this, we review disclosure language to determine if benefits are available to non-full-time employees and assess the quality of benefits [e.g. number of weeks of paid leave] where possible. As with other indicators, disclosure levels are higher among companies that already offer stronger, more accessible benefits. Disclosure can thus be used as a proxy for performance.  \n\nLike living wage data, existing benchmarks on companies' labor practices either don't cover benefits in a rigorous way or do not publish raw data. Other potential data sources, such as Glassdoor, have limited reliability. This is why we rely on companies' own disclosures as the best way of assessing their benefits performance.  \n\n#### What we found  \n\nGiven how much discretion companies have when offering benefits to their employees-including at what quality and to whom-accurate assessments of corporate performance rely on the availability of multiple data points. However, this has proven difficult given current disclosure practices. Publicly available benefits information is often vague and generally doesn't provide detail regarding the depth and breadth of coverage. Benefits disclosures tend to articulate only what is available to exempt [salaried] employees, with little-to-no detail about the quality of those benefits and what, if any, are available to non-exempt employees.  \n\nWith regard to quality, the information needed to assess benefit packages varied across indicators. The indicator with the most available information is paid parental leave, with $58\\%$ of companies disclosing the number of weeks they offer (10 weeks on average). For health care, we assessed if a company's plan meets silver, gold, or platinum standard. 57 We were able to determine that only $41\\%$ of companies offer a health care plan that fulfills at least a silver standard.  \n\nWith regard to coverage, we found a considerable gap between the general availability of a benefit and its accessibility across benefit categories. For instance, while $76\\%$ of companies state that they offer paid parental leave, only $12\\%$ indicate that this benefit is available to non-full-time employees. Similarly, while we found information for $41\\%$ of companies indicating that they offer decent quality health care benefits, the accessibility of these benefits appears limited, as only $8\\%$ of companies make them available to non-full-time employees. Interestingly, we did find that $80\\%$ of companies do emphasize inclusivity of their benefits packages when it comes to their $\\mathsf{L G B T}\\mathbb{O}+$ employees, signaling the growing corporate focus on this subset of the workforce.  \n\n#### C. Workplace conditions  \n\n#### Why it matters  \n\nThere is a strong link between workplace safety and economic inequality. Workers in lower-income brackets are disproportionately represented in industries characterized by higher risks of accidents, injuries, and occupational diseases [e.g. construction, manufacturing, agriculture). Further magnifying inequality impacts, these workers are often in more precarious employment situations, such as part-time or contract work, which typically offer fewer health benefits [see section above).  \n\nThis situation creates a vicious cycle where lower-income workers are more likely to accept dangerous jobs out of economic necessity, in turn increasing their risk of injury or illness. As they are less likely to be protected against these risks, they are at a higher risk of losing income or employment, further deepening their economic hardship.  \n\nDue to a lack of legal constraints, US corporations maintain considerable power over workplace conditions and safety risks, along  \n\n![](images/786c10cde3f112911cea222345074c80fd5033d2ffde0302177964f12f33878d.jpg)  \n\nWe found a   \nconsiderable   \ngap between the   \ngeneral availability of a benefit and   \nits accessibility   \nacross benefit   \ncategories.  \n\nwith their employees' health and capacity to protect themselves from injury, illness, death, and loss of human dignity. This level of discretion makes corporations responsible for the prevalence of work-related injuries and illnesses.  \n\n#### What we assessed  \n\nThere are different ways of calculating a company's workplace safety performance. We chose to focus on the total case incident rate (TciR), which is the number of work-related injuries per l00 full-time workers over the course of a year. A company's TCiR is based on the number of mandatory reported OSHA recordable injuries and illnesses.58  \n\n![](images/3ce691e8910f2772007de89dacf47948dfef06c391c7c6a0318e286a19ac4b67.jpg)  \n\nTotal case incident rates (TCIR) in our sample widely vary across companies, which is not surprising given the varying levels of safety risks and incidences across industries.  \n\nSince companies are not required to publicly disclose the information they report to OSHA, we focus our assessment of workplace safety on disclosure. First, we determine if a company makes its total case incident rate readily available. Second, we analyze if the company publicly discloses the raw numbers required to calculate its TCiR (i.e. the total number of injuries and illness and hours worked by all employees).  \n\n#### What we found  \n\nMore than half of the companies in our sample disclose their TCIR. However, only $6\\%$ receive a full score on TCiR disclosure by publishing both their rate and underlying figures. This disclosure gap makes it impossible to validate a given company's reported TCiR. The absence of TCIR disclosure from nearly $40\\%$ of companies can be partly explained by the fact that companies from low-risk sectors are included in our sample.59  \n\nTCIR rates in our sample widely vary across companies, which is not surprising given the varying levels of safety risks and incidences across industries. UPS stands out with the highest TCIR rate of 8.6 for 2021. Airlines [United, American, and Delta] and home improvement chains [Home Depot and Lowe] follow as top companies with the highest TCiR scores.  \n\nTCIR is an indicator that gains relevance through comparison-either through observations over time or between companies and sectors. However, we were not able to conduct this type of analysis in this iteration, which focused instead on analyzing disclosure levels. A more performance-oriented analysis needs to happen at a sector level. Determining benchmarks for TCiR largely depend on the type of industry one is analyzing (e.g., considering the inherent risk of a particular job in a certain industry and how that impacts how the company should perform in terms of injuries and illness and days away from work for the employee].  \n\n#### D. Workplace equity  \n\n#### Why it matters  \n\nSince the rise of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements in the US, there has been renewed attention, support, and activism for racial justice and gender equity. While many corporations have signaled verbal support for these movements, the authenticity and depth of their support has been called into question, given the persistent racial and gender inequalities and lack of concrete action from the corporate Sector.60  \n\nCorporations have long upheld societal structures that reproduce gender and racial inequities. These inequities are reinforced, in part, by the concentration of certain social groups within different levels of corporate hierarchies. White male CEOs are predominantly at the helm of the largest US corporations. The most recent Fortune 500 listed merely 8 Black CE0s (highest number on record] and that of the 25 Black executives ever leading a Fortune 500 companies, only 4 were women6l At the same time, close to $50\\%$ of Black employees earn less than $\\$15$ an hour [compared to $26\\%$ of their white colleagues].62  \n\n#### What we assessed  \n\nWorkplace equity is possible when companies create diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplaces and counter structures of patriarchy and racism that mark US culture and institutions. We assess workplace equity by looking at companies′ diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEl) policies and disclosure practices, their workplace equity performance, and any EE0-l violations.  \n\nAs DEl is an established policy area for many large companies, it is important to look beyond the commitment level. In particular, our assessment considers whether a company's DEl policy includes timebound targets for improvement and whether the company discloses its progress toward those targets. These distinctions are relevant as the quality, ambition, and specificity of corporate policies are assumed to be critical determinants of impactfulness.  \n\nWorkplace demographics are more closely linked to unadjusted pay gaps, as they make it possible to assess the skewed representation of women and people of color in low- vs. high-wage jobs. Companies are required to annually disclose workforce demographics data to the US Department of Labor through the Employment Information Report (or EEO-1).63 We assess whether companies make their EE0-1 data readily available to the public, as well as how companies perform in terms of racial and gender equity across job functions.  \n\nTo assess workplace equity performance, we analyze the discrepancy in demographic composition of a company's workforce and its executive leadership across gender and racial lines. This indicator is based on the assumption that the demographic composition of a company's workforce should be reflected by its leadership.  \n\n# 品  \n\nWorkplace equity is possible when companies create diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplaces and counter structures of patriarchy and racism that mark US culture and institutions.  \n\n![](images/a4f282fd776c2c90c5b5a9c9696bc9c9428d15e6ed5245337890b46794791541.jpg)  \n\nAround $80\\%$ of companies in our sample are disclosing data on their workforce demographics $179.8\\%$ disclose data on gender, $82.2\\%$ disclose data on racel.  \n\n#### What we found  \n\n#### DEl policies  \n\nThe rise of the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEl) paradigm has been the corporate response to mounting public pressure to address gender and racial inequities within their hierarchies. However, this paradigm has also been criticized for its lack of standards, consistency, and accountability,64 as well as a lack of long-term commitments and tangible results.65 With the Supreme Court's recent decision on racebased affirmative action, we may see a slowdown in corporate efforts to consider race and gender in hiring, promotion, and retention strategies.6  \n\nOur analysis started by assessing the degree to which DEl rhetoric leads to tangible changes within corporations. While all companies in our sample engage on the topic of DEl, only $44\\%$ have published concrete DEl targets. Even more worryingly, companies only score an average of $27.7\\%$ when assessed for their DEl progress disclosure by the As You Sow Racial Justice scorecard. More specifically, only $11\\%$ Of companies disclose their promotion rates, $12\\%$ their retention rates, and $21\\%$ their recruitment rates.67  \n\nStill, DEl policies seem to deter discriminatory practices. While close to $60\\%$ of companies in our sample have one or more EEO-violations on the books, having a DEl policy makes it roughly $50\\%$ less likely for a company to engage in this type of violation.  \n\n#### Workforce demographics  \n\nIn our analysis, we assessed both whether companies disclosed demographic data related to their workforce and what the data actually tells us about the representation of women and people of color across the corporate hierarchy. Availability of workplace demographic data is an important pre-condition for assessing racial and gender equity trends within a corporation. Without this information, it would be difficult—if not impossible—to determine whether a company's DEl initiatives are sufficiently addressing diversity and racial inequality issues within the workforce.  \n\nWhile just a few years ago, companies tended to treat their diversity data as trade secrets,68 data availability has significantly improved. Around $80\\%$ of companies in our sample are disclosing data on their workforce demographics $(79.8\\%$ disclose data on gender, $82.2\\%$ disclose data on race]. Aggregating and comparing companies demographic data is complicated by the fact that many publish their demographic data using company-specific classifications for job types and hierarchies. Even analyzing the data disclosed through the standardized EE0-1 form comes with limitations, as the most relevant categories vary from company to company and it is often unclear which category of employees is the lowest paid.  \n\nAnalyzing available corporate demographic data confirms the existence of racial and gender disparities in the US largest corporations. Across our sample, average workforce representation across companies is $59\\%$ men and $59\\%$ white (not taking int account difference in employee size between companies). When compared to a company's overall workforce, managers are 6.7 percentage points more likely to be men and 9.3 percentage points more likely to be white.  \n\nWhile these skewed characteristics hold across the vast majority of companies, they are likely an underestimation of racial and gender disparities across corporate hierarchies due to the fact that corporate disclosures are inconsistent and not sufficiently detailed. A more meaningful comparison would be to compare racial and gender representation of lowest and highest paying job categories. However, identifying these categories in a consistent way is complicated as companies don't disclose this type of information in a consistent way. The most consistent format companies use (EEO-l data) does not clearly identify lowest-paying job categories.  \n\nRetail and healthcare are the sectors with the highest proportion of women employees, while metals, extractive industries, and defense are the most male-dominated sectors. These sector differences highlight the intersectional nature of employment, as the sectors with the highest proportion of male employees are also the most white [e.g. metals, utilities, industrial machinery, defense] while some of the sectors with the highest proportion of women employees are also the most diverse [e.g. retail, healthcare]. The technology sector is an outlier, with a very racially diverse workforce that is also dominated by men.  \n\nWhile all sectors exhibited an over-representation of men and white employees in leadership positions compared to their overall workforce, some sectors are more demographically skewed than others. Wholesale, retail, automotive, and health care sectors are the most skewed racially, with more white employees in leadership positions, while retail, health care, insurance, and banking are the most skewed on a gender basis, with more men taking the lead.69  \n\nRetail is the most racially diverse sector with an average of $52\\%$ Of employees being non-white. However, it also has the second highest racial disparity of $18\\%$ and a gender disparity of $20\\%$ . In other words, the proportion of white (male) executives is 18 percentage points [20 percentage points] higher than that of the overall workforce. Automotive, banks, and health care are three other sectors with very diverse workforces yet a high level of racial disparity (i.e. comparatively few non-white managers and executives).  \n\n![](images/1fbb31c7ff154aa3fb84cac09c5c586950152f088c7b748103490f32edf875da.jpg)  \n\nWhile all sectors exhibited an overrepresentation   \nof men and   \nwhite employees in leadership   \npositions   \ncompared to   \ntheir overall   \nworkforce, some sectors are more demographically   \nskewed than   \nothers.  \n\n#### Box 3: Dollar Tree: the most inequitable company in America?  \n\nFrom a racial and gender justice perspective, Dollar Tree is the least equitable company. While most of its employees are women and people of color, the company is predominantly led by white men. In 2022, $68\\%$ of the workforce was female and $55\\%$ people of color, compared to the company's leadership, $75\\%$ of whom were men and $82\\%$ of whom were White.70  \n\nThe company also stands out for the growing gap between its CEO's and workers' salaries. In 2022, Dollar Tree recorded a net profit, almost doubling its profits since 2019. During the same time, the CEO's pay has increased by $32\\%$ while the company's median salary has declined by $4\\%$ to a mere S14,702 annually. As a result, its CE0-worker pay ratio has jumped from 690:1 to 950:1. Instead of raising wages and providing decent jobs, the company spent more than $\\$2.1$ billion on stock buybacks since 2019 and has the most part-time workers $(78\\%$ of its workforce] among all 200 companies in our sample at the time of data collection.  \n\nDollar Tree's poor performance is further amplified by its business model, which creates and exacerbates food deserts, especially in communities of color, maintains unsafe working environments, and uses the company's significant market power to pressure suppliers and Competitors.71  \n\n#### E. Human rights  \n\n#### Why it matters  \n\nHuman rights and inequality are deeply intertwined, with extreme inequality both a cause and consequence of human rights violations.72 Many drivers of inequality- including the erosion of labor rights; disparities in access to essential services like health, education, housing, and natural resources; and discrimination against and exclusion of vulnerable population groups—represent violations of human rights.73  \n\nFor global companies, human rights due diligence mechanisms are a critical tool to help identify, address, and monitor the ways that they impact their most vulnerable stakeholders. By protecting these stakeholders and ensuring their equitable access to resources and opportunities, companies are better poised to respect economic and social rights and thus help reduce inequality.  \n\n#### What we assessed  \n\nThe UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) provide the authoritative framework through which to assess corporations' human rights performance. It covers companies' human rights policy commitments, human rights due diligence processes, and the existence of robust grievance mechanisms for workers and other stakeholders.  \n\nWhile assessments of companies' human rights policies and practice already exist (in particular, the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark (CHRB) and the derived human rights indicators in the  \n\nWorld Benchmarking Alliance's Social Transformation benchmark) their coverage has remained limited and does not overlap fully with the scope of our assessment. As a result, we utilized the same human rights indicators of the World Benchmarking Alliance's Social Transformation Benchmark and applied them to the companies in our sample not currently covered by the benchmark.  \n\n#### What we found  \n\nThere is a significant gap between policy and practice. While $78.5\\%$ of companies have a policy commitment to uphold human rights, only $13.5\\%$ of companies are found to be in full compliance when it comes to identifying human rights risks and impacts. Only $3\\%$ are integrating these risks and impacts in their operations and supply chains and just $1\\%$ are found to be effectively engaging with stakeholders.  \n\nA relatively high number of companies provide grievance mechanisms forworkers $(83.5\\%)$ , though fewer offer them to external stakeholders $(58.5\\%)$ I. However, because the accessibility and effectiveness of these mechanisms were not also assessed, these percentages should be treated with a grain of salt. There is a risk of giving credit to companies for mechanisms that primarily exist on paper (e.g. a phone number buried in a code of conduct, which workers don't know and/or rarely review).  \n\n### Pillar ll: Power  \n\nThe power pillar encompasses three topics: corporate governance, labor relations, and political activities.  \n\n#### F. Corporate governance  \n\n#### Why it matters  \n\nCorporate governance is a critical facet of the conversation around inequality. Governance structures can influence how wealth and income are distributed within a company, with corporate boards or top management typically responsible for making decisions about executive compensation, shareholder payouts, and reinvestment strategies. Corporate governance can also shape a company's policies and strategies on other key issues relevant for inequality, including labor, climate change, or political activities.74  \n\nBecause the shareholder primacy paradigm represents the dominant corporate governance model, short-term shareholder returns tend to be prioritized over longer-term stakeholder concerns and societal welfare overall.75 When corporate decisions favor higher payouts to executives and shareholders over investments in employee wages or benefits, income inequality only grows worse.  \n\n![](images/b73dafa1b3fd609002fb0d4340c1b9c98c9408c4ee649574eb8f567000e3bbe4.jpg)  \n\nWhile $78.5\\%$ of companies have a policy commitment to uphold human rights, only $13.5\\%$ of companies are found to be in full compliance when it comes to identifying human rights risks and impacts.  \n\nIn contrast, more stakeholder-oriented governance models can positively shape a company's inequality footprint. In Europe, where employee representation on corporate boards is common, evidence has shown that employee participation in corporate governance can limit shareholder payouts76 and increase companies' effective tax rates.77  \n\n![](images/c083ab2022a8687730dd710eabaf31925dfd7049d4b3f54f2d9d082e45200275.jpg)  \n\nMore stakeholderoriented   \ngovernance   \nmodels can   \npositively shape a company's   \ninequality   \nfootprint.  \n\n#### What we assessed  \n\nCompared to the other topics in this framework, corporate governance is a more foundational category concerning the rules and decisionmaking processes that facilitate many of the other practices covered. As an assessment topic, corporate governance is closely linked to and even drives several other elements of this framework, including CEO pay and shareholder payouts.  \n\nIt is difficult to distill how best to assess the direct impacts of corporate governance on a company's inequality contributions. For this reason, our assessment framework relies on proxy indicators, based on the assumption that greater attention towards and participation from stakeholders (not only shareholders] has a positive impact on a company's inequality footprint. The two main areas of analysis for corporate governance are board composition [diversity, independence) and corporate purpose. CE0 pay is covered in a separate section.  \n\nWhen looking at board composition, we first assess board and CEO diversity from both gender and racial equity perspectives. For companies that do not disclose board diversity data, we infer gender diversity through board members' use of pronouns but do not make any inferences regarding racial diversity. Second, we assess the degree of board independence by analyzing the percentage of independent board members and whether the company separates the roles of CE0 and board chair. We define independent board members as members who have not been on the board for more than ten years, who are not a family member or part of the executive team and who are not a former employee in a senior management position.  \n\nThird, we assess if workers or other non-financial stakeholders are members of the board including if workers have a choice over the worker representative election process (nomination process or annual meeting with workforce] and if there is a worker council organizational structure one that provides a forum for worker representative to hear workforce directly and does not replace unions).  \n\nWhen assessing corporate purpose, we initially considered two options at an indicator level: first, a company's legal form [a higher bar] and the existence of a corporate purpose statement or policy (a lower bar]. As corporate purpose statements often lack clear definition and can be difficult to demarcate from other types of corporate statements (e.g. mission statements, sustainability goals), they risk rendering the idea of corporate purpose meaningless and were therefore not included. Future iterations of this framework could provide more specificity to this indicator (e.g. by focusing on board approved statements or charters for corporate purpose).  \n\n#### What we found  \n\n#### Board composition  \n\nSimilar to their disclosure of workforce composition data, companies have increasingly disclosed board diversity data in recent years. $62\\%$ of companies disclose board diversity by both gender and race, while $79.5\\%$ disclose one or the other.  \n\nAlthough corporate boards have become more diverse in recent years, they remain predominantly male and white. $67\\%$ of corporate board members are men and $71\\%$ are white. At the CE0 level demographics remain even more skewed- $91\\%$ of CEos are men. And while we were not able to analyze the racial diversity of CEOs in our company sample [due to a lack of data], the latest Fortune 500 figure highlighted that only 8 of 500 CE0s [or $1.6\\%$ are Black.78  \n\nThe findings on board independence are mixed. First, when looking at board chair independence, we found that only $46\\%$ of companies have separate CE0 and board chair roles-an important mechanism for ensuring accountability for executive leadership.79 In contrast, the average company classifies $85\\%$ of board members as independent, although this finding comes with the caveat that it primarily relies on companies' self-reported data.  \n\nSimilarly, we found that the vast majority of companies $197.5\\%$ have a board committee that is responsible for overseeing the company's sustainability and/or ESG performance, though we have little insight into the actual influence of the board on this performance. We also were not able to determine that any of the 200 companies we analyzed includes workers as members of their boards in alignment with our standards.  \n\nOur findings on corporate purpose were of limited utility due to a lack of data availability and the resulting low bar with which companies were analyzed. The analysis of corporate purpose statements proved of little value as there are no clear standards for what constitutes a corporate purpose statement. As a result, it was difficult to clearly distinguish between purpose statements and related corporate statements [e.g. mission statements, sustainability goals). When raising the bar, we analyzed whether corporate purpose is enshrined in a corporation's legal form (e.g. a B Corp or a Public Benefit Corporation), but none of the companies in our sample reached this benchmark.  \n\n![](images/670be6d89f9456c340041c2c5cf1a990b7b3d20d1906fc6b7e1ebde44e1830dd.jpg)  \n\nAt the CEO level demographics remain even more skewed $-91\\%$ of CEOs are men.  \n\n#### G. Labor relations  \n\n#### Why it matters  \n\nLabor relations cover the ways in which a company engages with its workforce. As shareholder primacy persists as the guiding paradigm for corporations, it has both contributed to and been fueled by altered labor relations in the US. As senior executives and investors alike use their power to extract resources from their companies to boost stock performance, labor remains a cost to be minimized rather an asset to be invested in.  \n\n![](images/cc8aa738f15370d884dfd457529285ef43970e4c471c6b74622d6bdf7771f03a.jpg)  \n\nThe decline of union jobs and the proliferation of part-time, temporary, and contract work arrangements are two keys ways through which shifting labor relations are affecting inequality.  \n\nOver time, legislative and organizational protections for workers to organize and bargain collectively have weakened, making labor relations another key lever for inequality impacts. With unions declining in recent decades, power relations have increasingly shifted in the favor of employers and away from workers. It is estimated that the disappearance of union jobs accounts for one-third of the wage gap that grew between high- and middle-wage earners from 1979 to 2017.8l As unionization efforts are on the rise again in the US, how companies react will be critical for determining their likelihood of Success.82  \n\nThe decline of union jobs also has exacerbated racial inequality. As unions declined and corporations reduced investments in the skills of their workforces, Black workers became particularly vulnerable to downward mobility.83 Research has shown that Black workers stand to benefit disproportionately from union membership, as the median wealth of Black households with a union member is more than three times that of nonunion Black households.84  \n\nThe proliferation of part-time, temporary, and contract work arrangements is another key way that shifting labor relations are affecting inequality, placing many workers in precarious employment situations without access to higher wages and benefits and no job security.85 In the U.S., part-time workers earn $29.7\\%$ less per hour worked than full-time workers with similar demographic characteristics and education levels. When it comes to benefits, part-time workers face even more disadvantages as they are often categorized as a separate class of employee to whom employers tend not to extend fringe benefits such as health insurance and paid leave.86  \n\nNon-standard work encompasses not only part-time work but also other work arrangements that deviate from stable, full-time employment in which the worker is employed directly by the company, including contracting, outsourcing, and temporary work.87 Through outsourcing and contracting, entire functions and departments can be separated from the companies' organizational boundaries and handled by external vendors.88 Companies use these boundary-altering strategies to keep labor costs low and employment conditions flexible.  \n\n#### What we assessed  \n\nWe assess labor relations by looking at companies' practices and policies vis-a-vis workers' rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining. First, we assess a company's policy commitment to these rights. Second, we assess the number and percentage of employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Third, we dig deeper into the obstacles faced by workers to organize by assessing if the company has been cited for anti-union behavior in union-busting databases.89  \n\nAssessing actual unionization rates is more difficult, as this data is less available at the company level than at the national and sector level. While companies are not required to disclose unionization rates, companies with a strong union record are often those that actually publicize their data. We thus assume that a company's disclosure of unionization rates is a proxy for the actual number of unionized workers, because union-friendly companies have an interest in disclosing this data while companies that resist unions do not.  \n\nInequality is also increasingly impacted by non-standard work arrangements (NsWAs] and the ways in which they shape labor relations. There are important differences in the type of non-standard work. Part-time workers are employees and thus covered by labor laws. However, the status of independent contractors, for instance, is less clear and has recently invited a lot of media attention and legal disputes as the gig economy continues to expand. Similar uncertainty arises when companies use workers from staffing or temp agencies. While these workers are usually regarded as employees of the staffing agencies, in some cases the client company may be considered a \"joint employer\" and thus have obligations to these workers.  \n\nBecause of these intricacies and because disclosure requirements on this topic are limited, we opted for a low bar, analyzing if companies disclose their use of any [and which forms of) NsWAs. This assessment connects to the topic of benefits under the \"People\" pillar, where we also assess if the company extends benefits to non-fultime employees.  \n\nAn important caveat for this category is that our assessment does not currently account for the fact that each NswA is relevant to inequality in different ways. For instance, it can be difficult to distinguish between a company using higher-paid contractors [e.g. consultants] and its use of lower-paid contractors [e.g. gig workers] as part of its business model.  \n\n#### What we found  \n\n#### Collective bargaining  \n\nGiven the key role unions play in ensuring decent jobs and better wages for workers,9 their presence [or absence] and the level of employee participation are critical indicators for a company's inequality footprint.  \n\n![](images/60464a876753d67f5fb6bb91d63d28292fc68d2cf448409d650c53d274d2ab09.jpg)  \n\nAssessing actual unionization rates is difficult, as this data is less available at the company level than at the national and sector level.  \n\nAs a starting benchmark, we analyzed whether companies have a policy protecting their workers' rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining. $67\\%$ of the companies we analyzed have published a policy like this. Companies with this kind of commitment were found to be less likely to engage in anti-union behavior, signaling that policies on these issues are material to corporate action.  \n\n![](images/3e66c1f7500b021576445881708166fccad017cbcc466b0c82c9ae8d52b90a92.jpg)  \n\nWe reviewed different unionbusting databases and found that more than half of the companies in our sample $(54\\%)$ were found to have engaged in antiunion behavior.  \n\nOur analysis found that reporting on the existence and coverage of collective bargaining agreements varies significantly across companies. First, more than half of the companies do not disclose any information regarding the number and percentage of employees' coverage under collective bargaining agreements (CBAs]. Only 98 companies disclose some type of information on CBA coverage. Of these, 3l companies disclose US-specific CBA coverage data. Furthermore, almost half of the companies [15] disclosing US data disclose that $0\\%$ of their workforce is covered by CBAs and another 6 companies disclose that $0\\%$ of US employees are covered by CBAs. Thus, only 10 companies report detailed CBA coverage data for their US employees.  \n\nSecond, comparing and aggregating data on CBAs and their coverage among the companies that disclose data is difficult since these companies don't consistently distinguish between non-US and US workforce when reporting unionization data. Also, several companies report absolute numbers of employees covered by CBAs or as percentage of a subgroup of workers, making it cumbersome to distill the % of workers for each company. What we can conclude is that the companies with the highest unionization rates (US and global) come from the following sectors: airlines, supermarkets, metals, manufacturing, and automotive.  \n\nAt the same time, we were interested in understanding the lack of a unionized workforce at certain companies by identifying if they have any instances of anti-union tactics. We reviewed different unionbusting databases and found that more than half of the companies in Our sample $[54\\%]$ were found to have engaged in anti-union behavior. Some of these violations are from several years ago. However, since anti-union actions by employers can have a chilling effect on unionization efforts that can last years, even past violations were captured. Due to the lack of public information regarding the details of these violations, no further analysis could be conducted.  \n\n#### Non-standard work arrangements (NsWAs)  \n\nTo begin our assessment of a company's practices and policies regarding non-standard work, we consider the prevalence of non-standard work at that company le.g. by comparing the numbers full-time employees to the number of those in non-standard work arrangements]. Only $36\\%$ of companies disclose the prevalence of their use of NSWAs, and among those companies, prevalence varies between sectors. Retailers lead on the use of part-time employees with workforces at Best Buy, Lowes, Kroger, Kohls, Albertsons, and Dollar Tree consisting of more than $50\\%$ of part-time employees. Dollar Tree is leading the pack at $78\\%$  \n\nWhen assessing the prevalence of non-standard work arrangements within a given company, there are limitations to the level of insight we can glean. For instance, data on the existence of part-time jobs does not tell us about the quality of these jobs vs. full-time jobs. Because these types of jobs often have less access to benefits, we also assessed a company's specific practices with NswAs. Our analysis confirmed that only a small percentage of corporations disclosed that benefits-such as paid parental leave $[1].7\\%$ , paid time off $\\left(6.8\\%\\right)$ health care $(7.8\\%)$ , and retirement benefits $\\left(6.8\\%\\right)$ J-are also available to non-full-time workers.  \n\n#### H. Political activities  \n\n#### Why it matters  \n\nThe rise in economic inequality in the US has gone hand in hand with the rising political influence of large corporations, particularly following the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which removed constraints on political spending for US corporations. Consequently, federal lobbying expenditures have been on the rise since reaching a record $\\$4.1$ billion in 2022.91  \n\nThe impacts on US politics have been significant. A vicious cycle between economic and political inequality has developed, wherein the economically privileged (i.e. wealthy corporations and individuals] are able to shape the policy environment in a way that further reinforces their economic privileges.92 while corporations have substantial influence on public policy outcomes, policies supported by lowincome groups are much less likely to receive public policy support.93 For example, the majority of Americans want to see corporations and the wealthy to pay a much higher tax rate, but there is resistance to legislative action among elected officials who rely on funding from corporations and wealthy donors.94  \n\nCorporate influence on US politics is facilitated through money and access-both of which are mired in opacity and thus often off the radar of investors and regulators. While the growing influx of corporate dollars in US politics is well-documented,95 corporations to date are rarely held accountable for their political influence. In turn, most companies continue to rely on a compartmentalized model of political engagement, separating engagement from their broader sustainability ambitions and relying on trade associations to do the \"dirty work\" of political advocacy. 96  \n\n#### What we assessed  \n\nWe start our assessment of corporations' political activities by assessing their lobbying expenditures (in absolute terms and relative  \n\n![](images/9c6d0efb165d0eabcabf39a872dd1f53a032e34e29813b98f58f2aa1178a19cc.jpg)  \n\nThe rise in   \neconomic   \ninequality in the US has gone hand in hand with the rising political   \ninfluence of large corporations.  \n\nto the size of the companys7) using the Center for Responsive Politics in their Open Secrets database.98 Political expenditures capture the extent of a company's political engagement reasonably well, particularly in revealing the participatory divide between corporate elites and ordinary citizens. This divide can eventually lead to policy outcomes that further reinforce economic disparities between the two groups.  \n\n![](images/8b25d7d5361cd1888b5f382f3c199335a1006bb1c8c0879907c8ce0924c0abd9.jpg)  \n\nCorporate political influence has increasingly drawn public scrutiny, putting pressure on companies to become more transparent about their public policy engagement.  \n\nSecond, we assess a company's political accountability by using the CPA-Zicklin Index, which assesses its political activities across three dimensions: disclosure, policies, and oversight.99 Given the vast array of tactics companies have at their disposal to influence policy and politics [e.g. revolving door, strategic litigation, astroturfing), accountability is key to ensure responsible behavior. We adopt the index's distinction between disclosure, policies and oversight as three key dimensions across which to assess corporations, along with each of the 24 CPA-Zicklin indicators.  \n\nThird, we dig deeper into the public policy issues and positions of corporations. In particular, we assess if a company discloses its positions on relevant public policy issues (building on CPA-Zicklin indicator 14) and if the company makes an active link between these positions and its declared sustainability goals. Through this, we aim to interrogate the perception that companies typically silo their political engagement efforts from their sustainability ambitions.  \n\nThere are three key methodological considerations associated with this topic. First, money does not equal influence and should not be conflated-instead, our assessment puts a spotlight on the participatory divide between individuals and wealthy corporations with the assumption that high levels of political spending from the privileged few can crowd out attention to the many. Second, there is an open question of whether it would be more impactful in the long term to reduce corporate political spending or for corporations to use their political influence in support of goals prioritized by affected stakeholders. Third, it could also be fruitful to consider a specific set of public policy issues considered most relevant to driving inequality and assess companies' positions and activities around these topics. However, we did not have sufficient bandwidth during this initial assessment to tackle this more complex level of analysis.  \n\n#### What we found  \n\nCorporate political influence has increasingly drawn public scrutiny, putting pressure on companies to become more transparent about their public policy engagement. Data that track the political engagement of corporations and wealthy individuals, particularly their political spending, have increasingly been made publicly accessible by watchdog groups such as the Center for Responsive Politics (OpenSecrets.org).100  \n\nWe assessed companies' lobbying expenditures as a proxy indicator for the extent of their political engagement. Through this assessment, we were able to find data on the corporate spending for 182 companies in our sample, which collectively spent $\\$745$ million on lobbying in 2022 [an average of $\\$4.1$ million each).  \n\nTechnology companies spent the most on lobbying (S1l4 million), followed by health care and pharmaceuticals. Over the past decade, these three sectors have seen the highest growth in lobbying expenditures. The sectors spending the highest proportion of their revenue on lobbying are defense, utilities, and pharmaceuticalsall of which are dependent on government support [e.g. contracts, regulations) for their commercial success.  \n\nThese findings are mirored at the company level. The company with the highest lobbying expenditures in 2022 was Amazon (\\$21.4 million) followed by Meta and three defense companies (Raytheon, Boeing, Lockheed Martin].  \n\nYet, these expenditure numbers only tell part of the story, as a large part of corporations' political influence is indirect, funneled through third-party groups or hidden within charitable giving.1o1 However, as we saw in our the analysis of CPA-Zicklin scores for the companies in our sample, companies only score an average of $16\\%$ when it comes to disclosing a list of recipients paid (and the amounts they received) by trade associations or other tax-exempt organizations of which the company is either a member or donor. Similarly, they score a $23\\%$ for having board oversight over political spending (i.e. have a specified board committee that approves political expenditures from corporate funds]. 102  \n\nBerkshire Hathaway stands out as a company with a very low CPAZicklin score on political accountability $\\left(2\\%\\right)$ despite spending close to $\\$6$ million in lobbying in 2021. Walmart and Meta are the two largest companies with CPA-Zicklin scores under $60\\%$  \n\nExisting disclosure requirements make it possible to identify a company's areas of engagement, but not the positions the company takes. While policy positions of corporations can sometimes be inferred based on other sources of information [e.g. business associations, press releases), it is not always possible to make these connections. This is why we developed two additional assessment criteria to elucidate the relationship between companies' political activities and inequality impacts. First, we focus on whether a company publishes its political positions on key issues. Second, we assess if the company links its public policy advocacy with its ESG commitments and goals.  \n\nInterestingly, we found that a relatively large number of companies [two-thirds] disclose information regarding their advocacy positions. However, the degree of specificity remains vague and it is not always how the positions are determined or governed. More importantly, not  \n\n![](images/69615c409d5bbb1b2ea661884b0aab2ed85c741c27303ee0eb96b01b9fda30e1.jpg)  \n\nTechnology companies spent the most on lobbying (\\$114 million), followed by health care and pharmaceuticals.  \n\none of the companies explicitly states that its advocacy positions are aligned with its sustainability goals, highlighting that companies continue to compartmentalize their political engagement.  \n\n#### I. Antitrust  \n\n#### Why it matters  \n\nThe concentration of corporate power in the hands of few large companies is both a driver and an outcome of inequality. There is a close relationship between monopolization and pivotal socioeconomic issues, beyond the traditional goals of promoting business competition and consumer protection. Corporate concentration and anticompetitive business conduct both impact worker pay and benefits, affect working conditions, stifle small businesses, disempower workers, exert undue political influence, reinforce gender and racial inequality, block strong climate action, and can raise prices for consumers.103  \n\n![](images/5b89157daa6bb7123d5f493ac9cd209c1f758a625e5e119afd1c6c79c6ed38a1.jpg)  \n\nThe concentration of corporate power in the hands of few large companies is both a driver and an outcome of inequality.  \n\nAs highlighted in section 2, corporate concentration in the US has grown continuously over the past decade with an ever-increasing proportion of corporate assets and income being captured by the top tier of corporations.1o4 A company's market power and behavior vis-avis its competitors are important areas of analysis from an inequality perspective.  \n\n#### What we assessed  \n\nThere are no existing standards or benchmarks to draw from when it comes to assessing antitrust issues at a company level. We focused our assessment on two dimensions: corporate concentration and anti-competitive behavior. To assess corporate concentration in a standardized manner, we focused our analysis on a sector level [assuming that the companies in our sample are the largest in their respective industries]. We used the Herfindahl Hirschman Index (HHl)- which calculates the level of concentration of the largest companies within their given industry-for data sourcing purposes, since HHl is how both the US Censusl05 and the Department of Justice106 currently measure concentration.  \n\nTo assess anti-competitive behavior, we began by looking at violations identified by antitrust enforcement agencies (both the DoJ and FTC), using the Good Jobs violation Tracker [since 2000). We also looked at pending and open cases during the time of data collection (looking only at the FTC library as the DOJ library was not up to date). We looked at pending and open cases because the bar for companies having a legal violation on record was too high, given how lax antitrust enforcement has been in the past and its narrow focus on consumer welfare.  \n\n#### What we found  \n\nThe analysis of the Census data on HHl was of limited utility, as the data was outdated (2017] and names of companies were not disclosed. There also seem to be significant differences between the HHI data that exists and other analyses of industry concentration for the same sectors.107  \n\nOur analysis identified 32 companies that have been cited for anticompetitive behavior. This number is a likely an underestimation, as the analysis only captured violations and pending cases in the FTC database. Reaching the level of \"violation\" is incredibly difficult and narrowly defined. Until recently, the deciding criteria of antitrust enforcement were concerned solely with consumer welfare, which means that the FTC has not necessarily captured other instances of anti-competitive behavior with other impact areas.  \n\nAs a result, antitrust remains a push indicator. While it is a critical issue from an inequality perspective, assessing individual companies practices and performance is currently severely complicated by a lack of available data.  \n\n### Pillar Ill: Profits  \n\nThe profits pillar focuses on the ways in which financial resources are distributed within and outside the company. It includes three topics: CEO pay, shareholder payouts, and tax practices.  \n\n#### J. CEO pay  \n\n#### Why it matters  \n\nThe evolving nature of CEO pay has made it a central contributor to the shareholder primacy paradigm and, consequently, a driver of inequality on several fronts. First, skyrocketing executive compensation is relevant for inequality trends at a national level, with executives and managers (including financial professionals] accounting for a large share of top income earners in the Us. In fact, it has been estimated that close to $70\\%$ of the increase in the share of national income going to the top $0.1\\%$ (between 1985 and 2005] went to executives, managers, supervisors, and financial professionals.108  \n\nSecond, exploding CEO compensation has driven massive pay inequities within firms. In recent decades, the slow growth of wages for the majority US workers has gone hand in hand with rising CEO pay. Since the 1970s, the ratio between CE0 pay and that of the average worker has widened enormously, with top CE0 compensation in the US shooting up $1,209.2\\%$ compared with a $15.7\\%$ increase in a typical worker's compensation.109  \n\n![](images/90f887cbca2cd161aabe0afaf500ae52d845895289a6cd3bf4565013abb8882a.jpg)  \n\nExecutive   \ncompensation   \nis relevant for   \ninequality trends at a national level, with executives   \nand managers   \naccounting for a   \nlarge share of top income earners in the US.  \n\nThird, CEO compensation matters not only due to its growing size but also its changing form. The proliferation of equity-based pay packages are important indicators of a company's orientation towards shortterm shareholder returns [and thus higher inequality). Shareholder primacy facilitates and encourages an increasing focus on the use of stock options for executive compensation,l1o in turn incentivizing executives to adopt short-term strategies, maximize profits, and spend the majority of those profits on dividends and stock buybacks to boost shareholder returns (rather than invest in their companies' workforce or the low carbon transition].i  \n\n#### What we assessed  \n\n![](images/f4b2e2e74f1fc486be16debff281e80d2962b087878c6fdd3cd17a295b819324.jpg)  \n\nCEO compensation matters not only   \ndue to its growing size but also its   \nchanging form.   \nThe proliferation of equity-based   \npay packages   \nare important   \nindicators of   \na company's   \norientation   \ntowards short  \nterm shareholder returns.  \n\nThere are three ways through which we analyzed CE0 pay from an inequality perspective. First is the total amount that CEOs are paid, since CEOs and other corporate executives make up a significant proportion of top income earners in the US. Second is the relationship between CEO pay and the salaries of their companies' employees. Assessing this ratio can lead to important insights, particularly when comparing similar companies.l12 Third is the composition of CEO pay (i.e. how CEOs are paid) and in particular, the use of equity-based pay as a relevant indicator of a company's focus on prioritizing shareholder returns.113  \n\nAssessing the amount of total CEO compensation comes with two main caveats. First, total compensation does not paint a complete picture, as corporate disclosures are based on when the pay package was granted, not when CEOs cashed it in (realized pay). In other words, companies' disclosure of CE0 pay can greatly understate the amount of money that CEOs actually earn.ll4 Second, without situating it in a broader context, total compensation on its own has little explanatory value, and gains meaning only when compared over time, against peers, or corporate financial performance.  \n\nCEO-to-median-worker pay ratios have become a popular metric since companies have been required to report on median salaries. We have included this ratio in our analysis, keeping in mind three caveats. First, companies have been afforded significant discretion by the SEC in determining their median salaries, making this data point less reliable.li5 Second, due to the significant variation in median salaries across sectors and companies of different sizes, analyzing CEo-tomedian-worker pay ratios is most meaningful when comparing similar companies in the same sector, rather than across different sectors. 116 Third, there is no established benchmark above which CEO-worker wage gaps become indefensible.  \n\nWe also looked at the composition of CEO pay-both in terms of the relevance of stock incentives and whether compensation is linked to ESG performance. While the data on stock incentives is quite specific, companies have remained very vague when it comes to the role of ESG factors in determining CEO pay. If, in our analysis, we give credit to  \n\ncompanies for mentioning ESG metrics in CEO compensation packages, there is a risk of greenwashing, as companies may set a low bar for ESG metrics used to determine compensation.  \n\n#### What we found  \n\nThere are myriad methodological and data challenges involved with assessing CE0 pay from an inequality perspective (see methodology note]. We focused our analysis on CE0 pay trends over time, along with the composition of CE0 pay with regards to equity-based packages and ESG performance factors.  \n\nOverall, CE0 pay has increased substantially compared to prepandemic years. Following a brief dip in 2020, CE0 pay has jumped significantly in years since. In total, we found that CEO pay grew by $31\\%$ between 2018 and 2022, acr0ss the 186 companies for which we had data. In 2022, the CE0s of these companies were paid a combined $\\$4.1$ billion. Tech and finance companies led the pack in terms of absolute pay, with six companies paying their CEOs over Sl00 million during at least one year between 2018 and 2022: Alphabet, Amazon, Intel, Oracle, Blackstone, and KKR.117  \n\n#### Box 4: Excessive CE0 pay as inequality driver: the case of Tesla  \n\nIn 2018, Tesla founder and CE0 Elon Musk negotiated a highly unique and unprecedented compensation package, not only in its size but also in its structure. The multi-billion dollar pay package was composed entirely of stock incentives and was contingent on increasing the company's market value. It was by far the largest potential compensation package ever recorded.118  \n\nMusk has received a payout to close to $\\$55$ billion to date, the highest CEO payout in US history, making Musk the richest person on Earth.l19 For workers earning the current federal minimum wage of $\\$7.25$ /hour, it would take 3.6 million years to earn the same.120  \n\nTesla's decision to base CEO pay entirely on stock incentives has had ripple effects across the corporate sector, encouraging other companies to restructure their CE0 compensation as well.12l However, following a law suit alleging excessively high compensation, a judge recently called Musk's CEO package \"unfathomable\" and ordered that it be rescinded.122  \n\nWe put CEO pay in context by analyzing companies' CEO-to-medianworker pay ratio. Starting with median pay, we found that retail and food & beverage companies have the lowest median salaries [often below \\$20,000 a year). Among the 10 companies with the lowest median salaries in 2022 are eight from these two sectors, including Ross Stores (S9,968), The Coca-Cola Company (\\$12,122), Starbucks [S12,254), Kohls [\\$12,819], TJX Corp0ration (\\$13,884), McDonalds (S14,521), Dollar Tree (S14,702), and Dollar General (S18,352]. For s0me companies with low median salaries, like Walgreens or The Coca-Cola Company, median salaries have actually declined since 2018.  \n\n![](images/8c987413a81d2103f0789300ed5d416179a48f78d87e2a26545f116fa658d97f.jpg)  \n\nWhile 80   \ncompanies   \nsay that they   \ndetermine CEO pay by factors other   \nthan financial   \nperformance, only 17 shared concrete benchmarks or   \npercentages of   \nCEO pay linked to   \nESG performance.  \n\nCompanies with low median pay are more likely to have high CE0 to worker pay ratios. However, pay ratios can change significantly year over year, due to fluctuations in CEO compensation [e.g. when a CEO is awarded a new package of stock options). Looking at companies with consistently high CE0-to-median-worker pay ratios, we identified four with average ratios above 1500:1 across five years of analysis. They include Jabil (1864:1), McDonalds (1745:1), TJX c0rporations (1604:1), and Coca-Cola (1594:1).  \n\nAnother key indicator we analyzed is the degree to which a CE0's pay package is composed of stock incentives. The more their compensation is based on stock price, the more likely a CE0 is to make decisions in the short-term interest of shareholders and potentially to the detriment of long-term value creation for all stakeholders. The rise of stock-based compensation is a key driver of CE0 pay growth over the last few decades,123 and our analysis confirms a steady incline in the proportion of CEO pay consisting of stock incentives. On average, stock incentives make up about two-thirds $[63\\%]$ Of CEO pay.  \n\nWe also assessed if, and to what degree, CE0 pay packages were conditional on their companies' ESG performance. This was a more difficult indicator to measure as there is no standardized disclosure for this kind of information. If companies do disclose a link between CEO pay and ESG performance, details are often murky. For example, while 80 companies say that they determine CE0 pay by factors other than financial performance, only 17 shared concrete benchmarks or percentages of CEO pay linked to ESG performance.  \n\n#### K. Shareholder payouts  \n\n#### Why it matters  \n\nAt the heart of an individual company's inequality contributions is the question of how its generated income is distributed between capital and labor. At the macro level, the declining share of labor income in the US has been a major driver of rising inequalityl24 and we see these dynamics play out at the micro (i.e. company) level as well.  \n\nShareholder payouts are directly tied to a company's practice of distributing earnings to shareholders vs. reinvesting those earnings into the productive capacities of the company (including its employees]. By prioritizing shareholder payouts instead of longerterm investments that would benefit the productive resources [and incomes] of workers, individual companies are contributing to the growth of inequality.  \n\nThe extent to which companies are distributing earnings to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases (i.e. buybacks] is unprecedented.125 Between 2012 and 2021, S8P 500 companies funneled $\\$9.1$ trillion to shareholders $\\$5.7$ trillion as buybacks and $\\$4.2$ trillion as dividends]-equaling $96\\%$ of their profits over that same period.126  \n\nThese vast payouts exacerbate inequality in at least two key ways. First, shareholder payouts primarily benefit those who are already welloff. Share ownership in the US is highly concentrated, with the richest $10\\%$ of Americans owning $84\\%$ of all U.S. stocks and the bottom $50\\%$ owning only $1\\%$ .127 The top $1\\%$ of income earners have been capturing an increasing proportion of corporate shares (from $41\\%$ in 2003 to $53.6\\%$ in 2023].128 Similarly, white Americans, at $59\\%$ of the country's population, own $89\\%$ of corporate shares while Black and Hispanic Americans own less than a combined $2\\%$ of shares.129  \n\nSecond, these record shareholder payouts have left very little for companies to invest in their productive capabilities or the compensation of their employees.130 Since stock-based instruments make up the majority of CE0 earnings, executives tend to prioritize shareholder value maximization in their decision-making. They may specifically use buybacks to exploit their insider status and grossly inflate returns on their own stock holdings. By artificially boosting executive compensation and depressing worker pay, shareholder payouts aggregate the divide between CEO and worker pay even further.131  \n\n#### What we assessed  \n\nWe assess shareholder payouts by considering two types of shareholder payouts: dividends and stock buybacks). While both types of payouts are important to this analysis, there are some key distinctions. While dividends (i.e. the quarterly or annual distribution of earnings to shareholders] reward long-term investors in a company, stock buybacks (i.e. companies repurchasing their own stocks from shareholders on the open market) are a more speculative tool rewarding short-term investments. Importantly, dividends are tied to a company's earnings while buybacks typically do not come out of a company's profits but excess cash.  \n\nUnder the shareholder primacy paradigm, buybacks have become a very popular corporate practice because they are an efficient mechanism for quickly raising share prices and boosting earnings per share. Corporate executives, in particular, benefit from this practice, as stock-based instruments make up the majority of their compensation and stock repurchases give them an opportunity to cash out their personal holdings at a profit.132 Short-term oriented shareholders, who have little stake in or concern for the long-term growth of the companies they invest in, can also benefit by selling their shares at these artificially inflated prices..13  \n\nTo calculate individual company's shareholder payout ratios, we analyze the sum of a company's shareholder payouts [dividends $^+$ share repurchases] as percentage of its net profits for the same year. To calculate shareholder payout ratios in the aggregate, the sum of shareholder payouts for each company were analyzed as percentage of the sum of net profits for the same companies.  \n\n![](images/9094d0e506a4ca81feddb85451c2ae0d7edff1bad5fb24b1b46dc647fae1a3ea.jpg)  \n\nShare ownership in the US is highly concentrated, with the richest $10\\%$ of Americans owning $84\\%$ of all U.S. stocks and the bottom $50\\%$ owning only $1\\%$ ■  \n\nShareholder payouts can have a variety of detrimental impacts, depending on companies' ownership structure [e.g. hedge funds vs. pension funds vs. employee ownershipl. While analyzing ownership composition goes beyond the scope of the current analysis, we do assess whether companies are employee-owned in a meaningful way.  \n\nThree options of broad-based employee ownership we considered are: Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs), Worker Cooperatives, and Employee Ownership Trusts (E0Ts).134 In terms of benchmarking, we defined the bar for employee ownership needing to be: (a) broad (providing all employees with the opportunity to become an owner, (b) meaningful (providing the potential to earn at least half of an employee's annual earnings and (c) free for all employees who earn less than S100,000 annually.135 Stock purchase options were thus not included as all employees need to purchase them.  \n\n#### What we found  \n\n![](images/1576949705852cfdd6b9d9ed2f854c82e5115d27688de64496db1a33bd79ae65.jpg)  \n\nSeveral companies in low-wage sectors have not hesitated to spend massive amounts on stock buybacks.  \n\n#### Shareholder payout ratio  \n\nA useful proxy for a company's endorsement of the shareholder primacy model is the proportion of corporate profits directed toward shareholders (vs. being reinvested in the company and its labor force).  \n\nOur analysis found that shareholder payouts significantly rebounded in the post-C0VID economy. After declining in 2020, stock buybacks roseby $81\\%$ in 202l and today are at a record level of $\\$681$ billion for the 200 companies in our sample. The same pattern prevailed for dividends, although their decline and rebound were less pronounced. Altogether, the corporations in our sample paid out more than $\\$1.1$ trillion to shareholders in 2022 (\\$448 billion in dividends and $\\$681$ billion in buybacks).  \n\nTech companies boasted the highest payouts, in absolute terms. Apple's buyback practices are particularly remarkable, spending \\$70- 90 billion on buybacks every year since 2018, while Alphabet, Microsoft, and Oracle all spent more than $\\$100$ billion in buybacks since 2018. Meta is another striking example, laying off tens of thousands of people while announcing a $\\$50$ billion buyback program.136  \n\nExtractive industries also lean heavily on stock buybacks. ExxonMobil [\\$15 billion in 2022] and Chevron (\\$11 billion in 2022] both spent significant amounts that could have otherwise been invested in a Just Energy Transition.  \n\nSeveral companies in low-wage sectors have not hesitated to spend massive amounts on stock buybacks. The highest spenders across the five years we analyzed include Lowe's (S39.5 billion], Home Depot [\\$39.2 billion], Walmart [\\$35.5 billion] and Starbucks [S21.7 billion]. FedEx spent close to $\\$6$ billion in buybacks while decreasing its median salary by $22\\%$ between 2018 and 2022. Collectively, the \"Low  \n\nWage $100^{\\prime\\prime}$ (the 100 S8P 500 companies with the lowest median worker pay) spent $\\$340$ billion on stock buybacks since 2020 alone.137  \n\nAcross sectors, it remains common practice for companies to spend more on shareholder payouts than what they earn in net profit. Wellknown companies across sectors with average payout ratios at or above $100\\%$ (between 2018 and 2022) include Best Buy $[1]7\\%]$ , Nike $(137\\%$ , Mondelez $[]00\\%]$ , and Merck $[]10\\%]$  \n\nTwice in the last five years, the aggregate payout ratio for the 200 companies we analyzed was over $100\\%$ , further underscoring just how common these high shareholder payouts are. Even in 2020, the aggregate shareholder payout ratio was $108\\%$ , despite declining profits and widespread human health, financial, and social struggles due to the C0VID-19 crisis. In 2022, companies' shareholder payouts accounted for $90\\%$ of their net profits.  \n\n#### Employee ownership  \n\nWhile there is growing attention on the potential of employee ownership to curb inequalityi38, significant momentum on employee ownership in the US, the largest US corporations seem to not yet jumping on the bandwagon. 0nly 37 of 200 companies [or $18.5\\%.$ had a partial score for employee ownership indicating that they offer some type of vehicle for employees to own a stake in the company. However, not one company made this option accessible for all employees, free Or offered a meaningful benefit.  \n\n#### L. Tax practices  \n\n#### Why it matters  \n\nTaxation is the primary redistributive mechanism available to governments when combatting inequality. Although corporate tax payments do not automatically translate to lower inequality (i.e. they have to first find their way through government institutions), they are a key funding source for essential public services and social protection programs that benefit low income groups.  \n\nTax revenue also helps provide the backbone for goods and services (e.g. infrastructure, education system] that companies rely on to be successful. While a company's strategy to minimize tax payments may reward corporate management and shareholders in the short term, such strategies often come at the cost of exacerbating income inequality and hindering long-term value creation.139  \n\nCorporate income taxes do not only matter for inequality through redistribution. Evidence suggests corporate income tax is also progressive inasmuch as shareholders who are predominantly at the top of the income distribution bear most of the tax burden.140 By minimizing their tax burden, companies can spike profits, which  \n\n![](images/0c308c5234fbeed1e95e110fa69fc82870f26cd7a5149dfc59e027d322a37c2d.jpg)  \n\nAcross sectors,   \nit remains   \ncommon practice for companies   \nto spend more   \non shareholder   \npayouts than what they earn in net   \nprofit.  \n\n![](images/1e709146b531df2b806daa19d6a6de603f9a8894eee070f64a38e039dda54dbd.jpg)  \n\nBecause opacity tends to enable corporate tax avoidance, transparency is an important assessment criterion.  \n\ntypically reward corporate executives and wealthy shareholders at the expense of not only their employees but broader systems of public services as well. These tax minimization strategies thus aggressively sustain wealth disparities, making them one of the most significant corporate practices that enable and contribute to inequality.141  \n\nCorporate tax practices occur within a global system of tax competition that has led to a steady decline in corporate tax rates. This includes the US where the corporate tax rate fell from $35\\%$ to $21\\%$ under the Trump administration.142 As a result, the amount of taxes paid by US corporations decreased immediately.143  \n\nCorporate tax avoidance is facilitated by companies' ability to move capital between jurisdictions, further reinforcing countries' tax competition and leading corporations to hoard an increasing amount of money in low-tax jurisdictions. For US corporations, this number increasedfrom $\\$1.6$ trillion at the turn of the century to about $\\$5.8$ trillion in 2022.144  \n\n#### What we assessed  \n\nWe start our assessment of corporate tax practices at the policy level. In recent years, we've seen the emergence of standards on responsible tax practices-such as the B Team responsible tax principles145 and the GRl tax standardl46-which standardize key practices such as making commitments to not engage in aggressive tax planning, establishing board oversight of tax strategies, and ensuring tax transparency. We assess the degree to which companies have adopted these principles.  \n\nDespite this progress toward developing responsible tax practices, corporations continue to be sophisticated in finding ways to reduce their tax burden. Because opacity tends to enable corporate tax avoidance, transparency is an important assessment criterion for us. Public country-by-country reporting (pCBCR) is a cornerstone of tax transparency, as it asks companies to disclose the global allocation of income, profit, taxes paid, and economic activity among tax jurisdictions in which it operates.147  \n\nOn tax practice, we assess two areas. First, we assess whether a company has a presence in tax havens, based on a list of established tax havens that Oxfam and its allies have identified.148 Second, we assess a company's actual tax payments by calculating its effective tax rate from 2018 to 2022. Tax payments are assessed by calculating companies' effective tax rate, which is often much lower than the statutoryrate.  \n\nTo calculate the effective tax rate (ETR) for individual companies, we analyzed a company's total tax payments as percentage of its % profits before tax for the same fiscal year. To calculate the average effective tax rate across companies in our sample for a given year, we calculated the mean ETR across the company sample ensuring that each companies' ETR counts equally. We omitted any firm-year with a net profit loss and omitted the top/bottom $1\\%$ of outliers.By assessing tax rates across a five-year period, we are able to detect trends over time and also account for outlier years.  \n\nThere are a couple of caveats for our tax assessment. First, several of the jurisdictions that top global tax haven lists are also places with significant commercial relevance. We are not always able to distinguish whether a company is operating in these jurisdictions for commercial reasons or to avoid paying taxes, since pcBCR information is needed to make that distinction. Second, while most large corporations have an international presence, not all of them do, making the need for pCBcR less relevant. However, we do not assess the global presence of companies.  \n\n#### What we found  \n\n#### Responsible tax policy  \n\nAs scrutiny of corporate tax practices increases, companies have started to adopt responsible tax standards and policies. In our sample, $22\\%$ of companies have published statements and policies of responsible tax practices. These policies are an important indicator, as we also found that companies with such a policy are less likely to operate in tax havens. At the same time, a closer look reveals that the specificity, scope and ambition. of these policy statements greatly vary. Very few contain provisions for the most important assessment categories, including the use of tax havens and internal structures for the accountability and governance of tax planning.  \n\n#### Tax transparency  \n\nPublic country-by-country reporting of tax-related information is a critical lever for mitigating corporate tax avoidance. In alignment with OECD tax guidelines, pCBCR requires companies to report business activities, revenues, profit, and tax payments by jurisdiction. While multinational corporations are required to disclose some pCBCR information to US tax authorities, no companies in our sample disclosed this information publicly, which is critical to tax transparency.  \n\n#### Use of tax havens  \n\nThe refusal of companies to disclose pCBCR information makes assessments of their usage of tax havens difficult. We compared companies' reports of significant offshore subsidiaries with a list of the most prominent tax havens, as defined by $\\mathsf{O x f a m^{\\perp49}}$ and tax justice allies.150 We found that $82\\%$ of companies in our sample had a presence in at least one of these identified tax havens. Without pCBCR information, it is impossible to determine whether taxes were paid in line with economic activity.  \n\n![](images/31a4ce7fa6cceee077f7d18ebe1c70699f06b403d31c2d8e8c4e9247a50fd9d5.jpg)  \n\n$22\\%$ of companies have published   \nstatements   \nand policies of   \nresponsible tax   \npractices.  \n\n#### Tax payments  \n\nFollowing the 2017 decrease in the statutory corporate tax rate from $35\\%$ to $21\\%$ under the Trump administration, the amount of taxes paid by US corporations decreased immediately.151 Our analysis looked at corporate tax payments between 2018 and 2022 and found that effective tax rates differed significantly across companies and sectors.  \n\nTechnology and pharma stand out as the two sectors with the lowest effective tax rates. On average, pharma companies paid $11.6\\%$ in taxes in 2022 $11.8\\%$ in 202l), with the lowest effective tax rates across the five years paid by AbbVie $[5.9\\%]$ and Pfizer $\\left(6.8\\%\\right)$ 1. These low tax rates are in line with broader trends of declining tax rates paid by US corporations as a result of the Trump tax cuts. A recent study found that the average tax rate of the largest US corporations fell to $14.1\\%$ between 2018 and 2022.152  \n\n![](images/af2386af71989c90ab62f4721fea75cb59b2c16e690b679e4f00e304c3b25dcb.jpg)  \n\nBecause climate change is a major contributor to inequality and corporations are major contributors to climate change, companies are poised to massively impact climate changedriven inequality.  \n\nChronically low tax payments are also characteristic of tech companies, especially in light of the sector's significant profits. In 2022, the tech sector's average effective tax rate was $14.9\\%$ $[10.3\\%$ for 2021). That year, IBM, Intel, and Nvidia all reported profits yet paid zero income taxes-instead, all received a tax credit (IBM: $\\$626$ million; Intel: S249 million; Nvidia: S187 millionJ.  \n\n### Pillar IV: Planet  \n\nThe planet pillar is focused on a company's actions and impacts related to climate action (including its efforts to contribute to the transition to a low carbon economy and its environmental justice performance).  \n\n#### M. Climate change  \n\n#### Why it matters  \n\nWhen assessing companies' inequality footprints, it's critical to consider their actions and impacts on our planet's changing climate. Because climate change is a major contributor to inequality and corporations are major contributors to climate change, companies are poised to massively impact climate change-driven inequality.  \n\nThe contributions of climate change to global inequality are welldocumented.153 People living in poverty are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, as they are more exposed to climate hazards, disproportionately susceptible to damage caused by those hazards, and have significantly less access to the political power, government institutions, and financial resources critical for anticipating, coping with and recovering from harm [e.g. natural disasters, crop failure].154  \n\nWe also know that climate change is exacerbating gender and racial inequality. $70\\%$ of those living below the poverty line are women who, because they are often in the role of caregivers and tend to have less access to political, institutional and financial resources, are more vulnerable to climate shocks.15s Similarly, because people of color are more likely to live in poverty, they generally have fewer resources to protect themselves or respond to climate-induced disasters.156  \n\nThere is a strong base of evidence for corporations' role in exacerbating climate change. As with the disproportionate contributions of rich countries and individuals,157 it is predominantly large corporations that are responsible for global emissions. Fortune 500 companies, from which our sample of companies is derived, are a prime example, as their carbon footprint represents more than $27\\%$ Of worldwide emissions.158  \n\n#### What we assessed  \n\nWhen measuring corporations' climate impacts from an inequality perspective, it is important to consider whether corporate climate standards suffice when applying an inequality lens.  \n\nWe decided in this first iteration to assess both direct and indirect ways through which companies contribute to inequality through their climate (inJaction and impacts. Indirect ways include a company's emissions along with its plans and actual progress to reduce them, which are difficult to directly connect to local inequality outcomes. After all, greenhouse gases and their climate change impacts do not recognize borders. It remains challenging to connect a specific weather event and its impacts on a population group to climate change, although the attribution science is evolving rapidly.159  \n\nWe started our climate assessment by looking at companies' commitment to net-zero. Using the Science Based Targets initiative's [SBTi) framework and database, which scientifically validates emission reduction targets adopted by companies, we analyzed if companies participated and if they had a net-zero commitment and targets in line with the SBTi.  \n\nNext, we analyzed companies' net-zero performance in terms of their actual reduction in emissions. We focused on the latest year of available data, which at the time of data collection for most companies was either 2020 or 2021. A precondition for this assessment is that companies disclose their emissions in a consistent manner. In particular, this includes Scope 3 emissions [i.e. emissions from the upstream and downstream activities of the company), which are required to meet the SBTi net-zero standard.160 However, Scope 3 emissions are more difficult to measure, as data is often not directly available to companies and because calculating them is less standardized and may differ by company and sector.161 As reporting standards vary, comparing emissions over time or across companies can come with inconsistencies.162  \n\n![](images/1bbaa02aefeccd12a2f7724b7850745856f82bad9c5d32f5f29d461a69555ad8.jpg)  \n\nFortune 500 companies, from which our sample of companies is derived, represent more than $27\\%$ of worldwide emissions.  \n\nA company's direct contributions include the inequitable social impacts of its transition towards a low carbon future. Actions taken to cut emissions could exacerbate inequality if they negatively affect vulnerable and low-income stakeholders and communities. The need for a \"Just Transition\" is key in this respect.163  \n\nWhen it comes to the issue of a Just Transition, we decided to start with a relatively low bar for our initial assessment. We assess whether a company engages on this issue and whether it publicly outlines how it plans to grapple with the socio-economic impacts of transitioning to a zero-carbon economy. The extent to which a company considers and mitigates these impacts will affect its inequality impacts in the transition process.  \n\n#### What we found  \n\n#### Net-zero targets  \n\n![](images/09fd04a9ceb8415289d7d0de5ded0212e09020d52036b630f79e6db006ef6d8e.jpg)  \n\nWhile $23.5\\%$ of companies in our sample participate in the SBTi, only $16.5\\%$ of companies have made a netzero commitment and only $6.5\\%$ of companies have set netzero targets in accordance with SBTi requirements  \n\nMost large corporations have publicly acknowledged the challenges of climate change. It has arguably become the number one corporate sustainability topic, as demonstrated by the flurry of commitments, initiatives, publications, and events on the topic.  \n\nTo assess companies' climate commitments, we used the corporate database of the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTl) and found that corporate attention to climate change has not led to sufficiently robust targets to date. While $23.5\\%$ of companies [47] in our sample participate in the SBTi, only $16.5\\%$ of companies [33] have made a net-zero commitment and only $6.5\\%$ of companies (13) have set net-zero targets in accordance with SBTi requirements. This finding aligns with the broader landscape of SBTi-validated commitments, which are currently on track to decrease emissions by only $2\\%$ by 2030.164  \n\nSince climate change is a fast-moving issue area, we undertook a quick scan in Feb 2024 to update our findings on companies' netzero commitments, which originally covered the time period until July 2023. Interestingly, we found little movement in aggregate numbers. In fact, only 12 (instead of 13] companies in our sample were listed as having a net-zero target in line with SBTi and 34 (instead of 33) companies have made a net-zero commitment (without having set a target yet). Interestingly, progress is not linear as, for example, four companies had their net-zero targets removed and three new companies published their targets [resulting in the net decrease of l).  \n\n#### Emissions disclosure and performance  \n\nA pre-condition for assessing companies' climate performance is the availability of data regarding their emissions, including Scope 3, which accounts for over three-quarters of corporate emissions overall.165 We found that the majority of companies $[85\\%]$ disclose emissions data (including Scope 3). However, while Scope l and 2 emissions disclosures are standardized and externally verified, companies have significant leeway in defining and calculating their Scope 3 emissions.  \n\nOur analysis of existing disclosures found a sobering picture of companies' ability to reduce their emissions. Only $40\\%$ of companies disclosing their emissions between 2020 and 202l actually reduced them. In fact, average emissions increased by $4\\%$ . While for some sectors this increase can be explained by the lower levels of operation in 2020 due to C0VID-19 [e.g. transportation, which saw an $18\\%$ increase), the increase in emissions in other sectors [e.g. food and beverage, with a $10.9\\%$ increase) cannot.  \n\n#### Just transition  \n\nMoving away from fossil fuels is the climate imperative of our time. Achieving a low carbon future will come with drastic economic and social changes, both positive and negative, including impacts that disproportionately hurt low income groups (e.g. job losses).  \n\nIn the last few years, momentum has been gathering around the need for a Just Transition. While definitions vary, a Just Transition generally concerns the need to move to a low carbon economy in a way that is fair and inclusive, creates decent work opportunities, and leaves no One behind.166  \n\nWe established a low bar for assessing companies on their Just Transition by simply assessing if a company is publicly engaging on the issue. However, even with this low bar we found that only 16 of the 2o0 companies we analyzed are engaging on the issue of a Just Transition.  \n\nOf the companies scoring a yes on this indicator, there is significant variation in how they grapple with what a Just Transition means for them. While some companies merely recognize the need to address the socio-economic impacts of a low carbon transition, others are more proactive in describing measures to address these impacts. That said, all the companies we analyzed have a long way to go with developing and implementing their just transition plans. Best practices are extremely limited among the companies engaging on the issue.  \n\nOur findings align with the Just Transition baseline assessment of the World Benchmarking Alliance, which found that the vast majority of high-emitting companies are failing to demonstrate efforts towards a just transition with only 9 of 180 companies scoring over $50\\%$ despite a relatively low bar.167  \n\n![](images/345142720bf8660b51d274d93b0e6c966929896cbabda1cebb9bd6c7f880fd74.jpg)  \n\nOnly 16 of the 200 companies we analyzed are engaging on the issue of a Just Transition.  \n\n![](images/6d9945390dba707dcbf13c6a0ee6c63b8fd8bd7177897219df8bed960c60acad.jpg)  \n\nAt the policy level, environmental   \njustice does not   \nseem a priority   \nissue for most   \ncompanies, with   \nonly $10\\%$ posting a public statement recognizing   \nenvironmental   \njustice as a   \nrelevant issue.  \n\n#### N. Environmental justice  \n\n#### Why it matters  \n\nOften, a company's environmental impacts are disproportionately felt by marginalized and low-income communities of color. In addition to being more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, these communities are also more impacted by air, water, soil, or noise pollution. This is why environmental impacts and social justice are interlinked. The term \"environmental justice\" captures this link by describing the importance of a fair distribution of environmental benefits and efforts to mitigate environmental burdens across all people.168  \n\n#### What we assessed  \n\nAssessing the environmental justice performance of a company is inherently complex, which is why we decided to rely on one of the few existing third-party benchmarks that assess environmental justice. The As You Sow Racial Justice Scorecard assesses companies' environmental justice performance across four dimensions: 1) if a company acknowledges environmental justice as an issue; 2) if it abides by environmental regulations; 3) if it has incurred environmental fines and penalties; and 4) if it has adverse effects to communities of Color.169  \n\n#### What we found  \n\nAs You Sow's environmental justice assessment offers a useful glimpse into the environmental justice impacts of the largest US corporations. At the policy level, environmental justice does not seem a priority issue for most companies, with only $10\\%$ posting a public statement recognizing environmental justice as a relevant issue. At a performance level, the picture looks different. $60\\%$ of companies in our sample have either not abided by environmental regulation and/ or paid environmental fines and penalties. As You Sow also filters for environmental impacts on communities of color (based on a list of industry-specific impacts] and finds that $70\\%$ of companies had business practices with negative impacts on BIPoc communities.  \n\n## 5. THE WAY FORWARD  \n\nBased on Oxfam's initial analysis, it's clear that corporate inequality impacts need urgent attention. Many of America's largest companies are exacerbating economic and social inequality through their current practices, and few are taking action to improve long-term outcomes for their stakeholders, instead focusing on short-term reward to shareholders.  \n\nWhile this initial assessment may seem to offer bleak results, this moment represents an important opportunity to shift course and advance a more equitable future. Investors and policy makers alike are well-positioned to usher in a new, stakeholder-oriented paradigm, where those at all rungs of the economic hierarchy reap the benefits Of the market.  \n\nThis analysis represents a first step toward building this paradigm, and we've identified three next steps that can help pave the way.  \n\n### 1. Create greater transparency and a stronger evidencebase.  \n\nIn this moment, there is a critical need to elevate corporate drivers of inequality to the desks of key decision makers-including investment and policy leaders. In order to do so, we need to build a stronger evidence base to allow the assessments of companies' inequality performance (individually and in aggregate).  \n\nThrough independent research and the establishment of clear benchmarks, there is a need to:  \n\nDevelop stronger disclosure requirements for companies. Our pilot assessment included several topics and indicators where we didn't have sufficient public data to draw meaningful conclusions. Either the data was not available, or companies were reporting information in a way that did not ensure confidence in its accuracy. Critical assessment areas with major disclosure gaps include:  \n\n0 Wage practices [starting wage, living wage).   \n0 Pay equity [adjusted, unadjusted pay gaps).   \n0 Non-standard work arrangements (use of part-time, temporary, and contract workers).   \n0 Tax practices (country-by-country reporting).   \n0 Political engagement Ipolitical positions, use of trade associations).   \n0 Just Transition (plan, targets, engagements). We need to build a stronger evidence base to allow   \nthe assessments of companies'   \ninequality   \nperformance   \n(individually and in aggregate).  \n\n![](images/ea1f61f4ace6ce860110e5fd1961062cdf61b031e649f026c1d75633cea4bba4.jpg)  \n\nEstablish strong standards for assessing companies' inequality performance. As different standard-setting initiatives on this topic are emerging, we need to ensure they adopt a holistic approach, assess performance [and not just policy), and don't shy away from thorny issues.  \n\nExpose the link between corporate practices and inequality. Our pilot assessment represents a first step in developing a stronger evidence base. But there is a need for more research and evidence gathering, including more targeted sector-specific analyses and issue-specific deep dives.  \n\n![](images/3fcfaec74f439e5da751e0d919961805da1be957a8f0f1db5ba2a36db2682612.jpg)  \n\nMany companies are unlikely to voluntarily and unilaterally address most critical issues, due to potential impacts on their bottom line.  \n\n### 2. Advance a corporate reform agenda.  \n\nAssessing companies' inequality contributions are only the first step toward improving them. Many companies are unlikely to voluntarily and unilaterally address most critical issues, due to potential impacts on their bottom line. This is why policy makers and investors need to establish and enforce stricter rules for corporations in order to help improve their inequality footprint. Critical policy areas include:  \n\n#### Corporate governance:  \n\n0 Redefine corporate purpose [at the board level] to include a company's stakeholders, including workers, consumers, and affected communities, as well as shareholders.   \n0 Rewrite the fiduciary duties of executives and corporate boards to cover not just shareholder returns but broader public interest. Ensure CEO compensation is tied to long-term value creation and ESG performance, not only to short-term financial objectives. Set a maximum worker-to-CEO median compensation ratio of 20-to-1.  \n\n#### Shareholder payouts  \n\nO Cap dividends paid out to shareholders. Dividends should not be paid until a corporation is paying a living wage to all workers and is investing enough in the lowcarbon transition. Prohibit open-market share buybacks as they are primarily used by companies to boost their stock market value.  \n\n#### Decent work  \n\nConduct a living wage assessment to determine whether all employees earn enough to cover the cost of local basic monthly expenses, including housing, food, health care, and transportation.  \n\nPay living wages, provide safe and healthy working conditions, and work with trade unions to increase the negotiating power of workers.   \nImplement human rights due diligence processes to ensure that workers' rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining are respected.   \nProvide paid leave and ensure women have equal opportunities for advancement. Make benefits   \naccessible to all employees including non-fultime ones.   \nSet a maximum worker-to-CEO median compensation ratio of 20-to-1.  \n\n#### Diversity, equity, and inclusion  \n\n0 Collect and publish racial equity data on compensation [e.g. EE0-1 Component 1 and Component 2 type data) for all personnel, leadership, and board members on an annual basis.   \n0 Conduct a pay equity audit across all positions and levels by race, ethnicity, and gender [adjusted and unadjusted pay gapsl; identify and correct any pay gaps; and release the results publicly.   \nO Set specific targets to hire, retain, and promote a diverse workforce, leadership, and board that mirrors the diversity of the nation and publicly disclose progress toward DEl targets. Adopt advancement practices that serve employees of color at all levels-with a particular focus on frontline workers of color-who may be harmed by the company's current business model. Update ESG and accounting metrics to ensure that they actively drive racial equity.  \n\n#### Supply chain  \n\nEliminate commercial and trading practices that place undue risk and pressure to cut costs on suppliers and vulnerable stakeholders in the supply chain. Prioritize sourcing from suppliers that guarantee a living wage and are unionized. Work with stakeholders to ensure living wages/incomes for people in poverty in the company's supply chain.  \n\n#### Political activities  \n\nMap companies' political footprint and assess the impact of their political engagement. Identify whether a company's policy priorities and positions align with its sustainability goals and reflect its responsibilities to society.  \n\nMeasure and take action on misalignment with the political activities of trade associations. Identify ways to increase access for marginalized groups to the policy making process.  \n\n#### Corporate taxes  \n\nWork towards a more progressive and equitable tax system.   \nEnsure large corporations pay their fair share of taxes in all locations where they operate, including through a corporate global minimum tax, applied at a country-by country level.  \n\n#### Climate change  \n\nInvest in a low-carbon transition. O Commit to transformational action to cut greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris Agreement and the $1.5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ temperature goal. Develop, publish, and implement a Just Energy Transition plan outlining how the company will manage the socio-economic impacts of its energy transition.  \n\n![](images/dc0f9503045db9f6b77d1bb4775e76795266de9ee797f0f7ab350b8cf0bd3bb8.jpg)  \n\nWe need   \nto promote   \nalternative   \nbusiness models and corporate   \nforms that are   \nbetter able   \nto prioritize   \nthe interests   \nof workers,   \ncommunities, and the environment.  \n\n### 3. Promote alternative business models and corporate forms.  \n\nCorporations' inequality performance is closely tied to their current business models. While stronger regulations can provide guardrails for corporate behavior, we need to also promote alternative business models and corporate forms that are better able to prioritize the interests of workers, communities, and the environment. This includes the promotion of employee-owned companies, worker cooperatives, benefit corporations, and other viable alternatives. Critical steps towards the promotion of alternative business models and corporate forms include:  \n\nDeveloping a stronger evidence base for how alternative business models and corporate forms can tackle inequality, including which alternatives have the most potential for equitable impact.   \nPromoting equitable business structures that share value   \nwith employees or workers in the supply chain, such as worker cooperatives, or benefit corporations.   \nIncentivizing companies to democratize their ownership through mechanisms like meaningful and broad-based profit sharing and employee ownership plans.   \nSupporting the solidarity economy by incentivizing the creation and expansion of cooperatives and other types of stakeholderoriented enterprises.  \n\nAPPENDIX A:METHODOLOGY   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Indicator Code</td><td>Topic</td><td>Indicator Name</td><td>Definition</td><td>Scoring</td><td>Data source</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\">Pillar I: People</td></tr><tr><td>A1.1</td><td>Living Wage</td><td>Living wage commitment [operations]</td><td>The company publicly commits to paying a living wage to all workers</td><td>Yes/No</td><td>Company Disclosure</td></tr><tr><td>A1.2</td><td>Living Wage</td><td>Living wage commitment (supply chain]</td><td>The company commits to working towards suppliers paying a living wage to all their workers</td><td>Yes/No</td><td>Company Disclosure</td></tr><tr><td>A1.3</td><td>Living Wage</td><td>Living wage implementation disclosure [operations]</td><td>The company publicly discloses a time-bound action plan including assessments and milestones towards a living wage commitment</td><td>Yes/No</td><td>Company Disclosure</td></tr><tr><td>A1.4</td><td>Living Wage</td><td>Living wage performance data disclosure</td><td>The company reports necessary data to evaluate living wage performance including hourly pay rates for their lowest wage workers and hours worked.</td><td>Yes/No</td><td>Company Disclosure</td></tr><tr><td>A1.5</td><td>Living Wage</td><td>Living wage performance</td><td>Employees starting/ minimum wage amounts to a living wage (S20.00 an hour) -

    "reference_markdown": "# General versus Specific Skills in Labor Markets with Search Frictions and Firing Costs  \n\nBy ETIENNE WASMER\\*  \n\nThis paper considers a world with matching frictions in the labor market: allocation of job offers to workers is time consuming and costly, and job separation is subject to a tax paid by firms. We show that, in general equilibrium and at the margin, workers invest more in specific human capital relative to general human capital when the allocation of workers to jobs is less efficient—i.e., a lower-scale parameter of a matching function—and when employment protection is higher. In other words, the farther away from a competitive environment, defined here as a limit case with instantaneous job matching and no employment protection, the higher are the various incentives to acquire specific skills.The mechanism is based on the ignored but robust partial equilibrium property whereby a lower job-finding rate for workers raises the relative return to specific versus general skills, since jobs are more distant.  \n\nThe task of this paper is to provide a simple, tractable model to organize the thinking and explore the consequences of these findings. Few models allow for a rigorous investigation of these issues.1 We show that specific skills and low turnover tend to reinforce each other due to a reverse causality: higher specificity of skills reduces turnover, since specialization improves the worker's current position, while it leaves outside options unchanged by definition. In contrast, general skills raise both the value of the current position and outside options, implying greater turnover: general skills and higher job turnover generate a coherent, yet different, labor market. In equilibrium, two pure strategy regimes emerge: a $G$ -regime where workers invest in general skills and an $S$ -regimewhere workers invest in job-specific skills. In addition, there is a mixed-strategy regime. These regimes do not coexist and each of them occurs separately, depending on the configuration of parameters. In the mixed strategy regime, workers are ex ante indifferent between the two types of skills and randomly choose one or the other. Although the mixed regime is more realistic,2 the pure regimes are a convenient way to illustrate the mechanisms described above.  \n\nThe model also suggests that country-differences in the accumulation of specific skills due to differences in labor market institutions may deliver an a priori plausible account of the divergence between continental Europe and the United States. To the extent that the degree of job protection induces the degree of skill specificity and therefore job turnover, this paper is in line with several recent works.3 Employment protection is seen as a key explanatory factor for the differences between labor markets, reducing not only inflows from employment into unemployment, but also outflows from unemployment into employment. More research is needed, however, in order to develop quantitative predictions and identify the relevant policy parameters accounting for productivity, mobility, and unemployment differences between the labor markets of different countries.4  \n\nSection I introduces the model. Section II summarizes the basic partial equilibrium tradeoff between general and specific skills in a frictional labor market. Section IHl derives the labor market equilibrium and identifies the conditions under which different  skill regimes emerge. Section IV examines the robustness of the model and verifies whether various extensions alter the main argument by examining the case of (a)continuous investments;(b）the firms’ provision of incentives to skills investments; (c) technology choices; and (d) education choices. Section  V suggests further quantitative research and concludes.  \n\nThe human capital of the workers is denoted by $h$ , and can be either general or specific. As Gary Becker (1964) himself noted, skills are neither purely general nor specific. This does not imply that the theoretical distinction is not useful. Both types of capital are imperfect substitutes, and, as an extreme form of complementarity, we postulate that $h$ can take only two values, $h^{s}$ or $h^{g}$ where $\\begin{array}{l l}{{h^{s}}}&{{(h^{g})}}\\end{array}$ represents the level of specific (general) skills. Gains from specialization imply that $h^{g}<h^{s}$  \n\nTo simplify, we assume that investments in human capital are made instantaneously at the time of entry into the firm and that agents are risk-neutral.5 The effort cost of each investment is respectively $C^{s}$ Or $C^{g}$ and is paid by workers.? If workers do not invest, the match is not productive and thus is immediately dissolved, so that the choice of not investing, although latent, is not done in equilibrium. We introduce below a participation constraint ruling out this latter possibility.  \n\nThe problem of the choice of skills is intertemporal. It is described at entry into the firm by the variable $i=s$ g.Thus, $i$ is a control variable. Once a newborn worker obtains a job,  \n\n## 1. The Setup  \n\n### A. Workers  \n\nThe framework extends the approach of Dale Mortensen and Chris Pissarides (1994) to a case where the human capital of workers is endogenous. Time is continuous; the discount rate of all agents is $r.$ . The mass 1 of workers die with a Poisson death rate of 8 and are replaced by newborn workers with no human capital. These newborn workers look for jobs and are randomly matched with employers who are looking for workers to fill vacant units of production. At job entry, workers decide on which type of skills they acquire. Following the bulk of human capital theory, investments in human capital are workers’ decisions under a set of incentives provided by the firm.  \n\n5 In the absence of risk aversion, we cannot discuss interesting aspects of skill investments such as the insurance components of general skills. I thank a referee, Eric Gould, and Ed Lazear for pointing this out. See also Gould (2002) and Gould et al. (2001), who focus on general education and wage inequality instead of training, as here. More generally, investments in specific skills are more risky, which justifies the assumption of a higher return. Finally, the risk associated with specific skills may require a higher demand by workers for employment protection or, alternatively, for unemployment benefits, in the absence of an insurance market. The consequence of this assumption is investigated in Rogerson and Martin Schindler (2002), who find that, in such a context, the welfare cost of displacement is large, probably above 1 percent of GDP for the United States.  \n\n6 The fact that workers pay human capital investments in terms of effort has no direct implication on the choice of skills: as shown in Becker (1964) and in a search context by Acemoglu and Pischke (1999a, b), wages partly or fully internalize the cost structure. The assumption is important, however, in that the firm cannot easily write a contract to induce an efficient level of effort if effort is imperfectly observable. We extend the model to firms paying part of the costs in Section IVC. Section IVD investigates how technology choices by firms may act as a substitute for an efficient contract. These extensions introduce no qualitative differences with the benchmark model. Finally, Section IVA relaxes the assumption of discrete human capital investments.  \n\nhe/she must choose $i=s$ or $g$ We denote by $k(i)=s$ $g$ the state variable of the employed worker corresponding to the choice $i$ that has been made, thereby refecting the human capital of the worker. Let us denote by $p$ the transition intensity of workers from unemployment to employment and by $b$ the level of unemployment benefits. Finally, $W_{0}^{k(i)}$ is the corresponding asset value of the choice. The asset value of the newborn unemployed $U^{0}$ is recursively  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{(r+\\delta)U^{0}}\\ &{\\quad\\quad=b+p\\operatorname*{Max}(W_{0}^{k(i)}-C^{i})-p U^{0}}\\ &{\\quad\\quad=\\quad}\\ &{\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad}\\ &{\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad}\\ &{\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad}\\ &{\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad}\\ &{\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad}\\ &{\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad}\\ &{\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad}\\ &{\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad}\\ &{\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad}\\ &{\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad}\\ &{\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad}\\ \\ &{\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad}\\ \\ {\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\\n$$  \n\nThe participation constraint (1.2) verifies that human capital investment costs do not discourage workers from acquiring skills.  \n\nIf the worker subsequently leaves the firm, specific skills are lost but general skills are retained. In symbols, at the time of separation, $k(i)$ becomes $k^{\\prime}(i)$ , where the state variable $k^{\\prime}(i)$ is  such that $k^{\\prime}(s)~=~0$ and $k^{\\prime}(g)~=~g$ .It is implicitly assumed that workers have a zeromass probability of subsequently obtaining a job in the same firm (there is no recall or temporary layoff). We then denote by $U^{k^{\\prime}(i)}$ the value of unemployment for a worker having already invested in skills. Unless there is an ambiguity, we describe choices and arbitrage conditions with the state variable $k$ and $k^{\\prime}$ ,thus skipping the control variable $i$  \n\n### B. Firms  \n\nA productive unit is the association of one worker and one firm. As such, worker productivity is the sum of the firm's component and the human capital of the workers. The firm's component is random and denoted by $\\varepsilon$ . It can be interpreted as a firm fixed effect. It evolves according to a Poisson process with intensity $\\lambda$ and is drawn from a density function $f(\\varepsilon)$ with c.d.f. $F(\\varepsilon)$ . The density has support $(\\varepsilon^{-},\\varepsilon_{0})$ and $\\varepsilon_{0}$ is also the initial value of $\\varepsilon$ at the time of match formation. The marginal productivity of workers $y$ with human capital $k=s.$ $g$ is  \n\n$$\ny=\\varepsilon+h^{k}.\n$$  \n\nThe timing of events and of decisions is as follows: first, at entry into the firm, the worker decides on the investment of type $i$ yielding human capital $h^{k(i)}$ . He/she correctly anticipates the outcome in terms of wages and job duration. The firm and its worker then bargain an entry wage $w_{0}^{k}$ . Second, at a random time, a new value of $\\varepsilon$ is drawn from its distribution. The worker is now protected from separation by a firing tax $T$ paid by the firm in case of separation. The worker and the firm bargain a new wage $w^{k}$ if there is a positive surplus to share. In the opposite case, they optimally separate. We assume, following the literature (Mortensen and Pissarides, 1999) that $T$ is paid by_the firm and is not transferable to the worker.7 Lastly, any subsequent change in $\\varepsilon$ leads to either a destruction of the match or a new negotiation.  \n\n### C. Stationarity Assumptions  \n\nWe will further restrict the analysis to stationary aggregate states. The following human capital choice of workers is therefore obtained. First, if newborn workers strictly prefer specific skills in their first job, they never invest later in general skills: workers with specific skills, upon separation, behave exactly as newborn workers since they have no skills outside the firm and, in equations, $W_{0}^{s}-C^{s}>W_{0}^{g}-C^{g}$ throughout the worker's career. Second, if newborn workers strictly prefer general skills in their first job, they never invest later in specific skills: workers with general skills do not have to repay the cost of general skills acquisition in the next job. If at a time $W_{0}^{g}-C^{g}>\\bar{W}_{0}^{s}-C^{s}$ a fortiori $W_{0}^{g}>$ $W_{0}^{s}~-~C^{s}$ . And third, if newborn workers are indifferent between general and specific skills in their first job, they randomize according to a mixed strategy. Those who chose general skills never invest later in specific skills, since they save on investment costs and retain their general skills. Those who invested in specific skills randomize again in the second job. If new-born workers are such that $W_{0}^{g}-C^{g}=W_{0}^{s}-C^{s}$ the same is true in the next job for those who have invested in specific skills. For those who have chosen general skills, the next job is such that $W_{0}^{g}>W^{s}-C^{s}$  \n\n### D. Wages and Surplus Sharing  \n\nIn a job of type $k=s,g$ ,the present discounted value of employment at the entry stage is $\\boldsymbol{W}_{0}^{k}$ and his/her outside option in case of separation is the asset value of being unemployed after separation, which is denoted by $\\mathbf{\\dot{U}}^{k^{\\prime}}$ . Recall that $k^{\\prime}=0$ if $k=s$ and $k^{\\prime}=g$ otherwise. Similarly, the firm's value is denoted by $J_{0}^{k}$ , and the outside option of the firm is $V$ . The entry wage is negotiated according to a Nash bargaining rule. The outside options of agents are equal to their threat point in bargaining over the wage. The total surplus of an initial match between a worker of type $k$ and a firm where the value of the total surplus is  \n\n$$\nS_{0}^{k}=W_{0}^{k}(\\varepsilon)-U^{k^{\\prime}}+J_{0}^{k}(\\varepsilon)-V\n$$  \n\nand its value is derived in Appendix A as well as the arbitrage equations of employed workers and firms. This quantity is split into shares $\\beta$ and $1-\\beta$ where $\\beta$ is an index of the bargaining power of the worker with $0\\leq\\beta\\leq1$ :we have $\\bf\\dot{W}_{0}^{k}-\\delta\\cal U^{k^{\\prime}}=\\beta\\cal S_{0}^{k}$ which determines an entry wage wo.  \n\nAfter the first transition of the firm's component $\\varepsilon$ , a new wage is negotiated. The continuing asset value for an employee of holding a job is denoted by $\\boldsymbol{W}^{k}(\\varepsilon)$ , while the continuing value of the firm is denoted by $J^{k}(\\varepsilon)$ .The firm's outside option is now $V-T$ The surplus after the first random change in $\\varepsilon$ is denoted by $S^{k}(\\varepsilon)$ It is now defined as  \n\n$$\nS^{k}(\\varepsilon)=W^{k}(\\varepsilon)-U^{k^{\\prime}}+J^{k}(\\varepsilon)-V+T\n$$  \n\nand $\\begin{array}{r}{W^{k}(\\varepsilon)-U^{k^{\\prime}}=\\beta S^{k}(\\varepsilon),}\\end{array}$ This determines the continuation wage $w^{k}(\\varepsilon)$ . All wage equations are standard and are derived in Appendix A. See equations (A10) and (A11).  \n\n### E. Job Destruction  \n\nAfter an idiosyncratic shock on $\\varepsilon$ ,if the new value is such that $S^{k}(\\varepsilon)<0$ , it is jointly profitable for both the worker and the firm to dissolve the match and to separate: indeed, in such a case, no wage renegotiation can satisfy both bargaining parties. The reservation strategy is easy to derive, following Mortensen and Pissarides (1994). One can first observe that $\\partial S/\\partial\\varepsilon=$ $(r+\\delta+\\lambda)^{-1}$ : the surplus is a linear function of $\\varepsilon$ with a positive slope. Thus, we define by $R^{k}$ the unique reservation productivity defined by $S^{k}(R^{k})\\stackrel{\\rightharpoonup}{=}0$ . The job destruction reservation rule is obtained after an integration by part using (A5):  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{\\lefteqn{\\mathrm{\\mathrm{\\ell}^{(2)}}}}\\ &{\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\Lambda}\\ &{\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad R^{k}+h^{k}+\\frac{\\lambda}{r+\\lambda+\\delta}\\displaystyle\\int_{R^{k}}^{\\varepsilon_{0}}\\left(1-F(\\varepsilon^{\\prime})\\right)d\\varepsilon^{\\prime}}\\ &{\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad}\\ &{\\quad=(r+\\delta)(U^{k^{\\prime}}-T)+r V.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe left-hand side is increasing in $R^{k},h^{k}$ , and $\\lambda$ and decreasing in 8 and $r$ . and the right-hand side is increasing in $U^{k^{\\prime}}$ and $V.$ and decreasing in $T.$  \n\n## II. Human Capital Decisions in Partial Equilibrium  \n\nWe shall ignore, for the moment, the determination of V—and thus of $p$ and $U^{k^{\\prime}}$ —andfirst describe the partial equilibrium. The reason is that introducing labor demand too early makes it impossible to separate skill supply from its demand. To get around this problem, we chose to separate the steps.8  \n\nGiven the stationarity discussed above, the partial equilibrium is simply characterized by the choice made by a newborn worker. Using equation (A9) in Appendix A, the choice can  \n\n8 In the conventional Mortensen-Pissarides analysis, the value of $V$ is equal to zero and $p$ is determined accordingly. The problem arises here from the fact that when $V=0$ $p$ itself directly depends on the choice made by workers as the overallamountofjobcreationswilldependonthetypeof investments made by workers. The method proposed here, fixing $p$ and $V$ first, reveals usually hidden aspects of the matching analysis. It is, however, not very different from a conventional neoclassical analysis, where one first derives a supply curve at all prices, and then determines an equilibrium price through aggregate demand.  \n\nbe represented by the following set of equations:  \n\n$$\ni=\\mathrm{Arg}\\operatorname*{max}[W_{0}^{k(i)}-C^{i}],\n$$  \n\n$$\nW_{0}^{s}=\\beta\\bigg(\\frac{\\varepsilon^{0}-R^{s}}{r+\\lambda+\\delta}-T\\bigg)+U^{0},\n$$  \n\n$$\n(\\mathrm{U}^{0})\\quad(r+\\delta)U^{0}=b+p\\beta\\bigg(\\frac{\\varepsilon^{0}-R^{s}}{r+\\lambda+\\delta}-T\\bigg)\n$$  \n\n$$\n(r+\\delta)U^{g}=b+p\\beta\\bigg(\\frac{\\varepsilon^{0}-R^{g}}{r+\\lambda+\\delta}-T\\bigg),\n$$  \n\nEquations $(\\mathrm{U}^{0})$ and $(\\mathrm{U}^{g})$ are obtained by replacing the worker's capital gain when hired by the value of the surplus calculated earlier.  \n\nDEFINITION: The partial equilibrium for each pureregimeischaracterizedbythedecision $i$ madebyeachtypeofworker(newbornworkers andworkerswithpreviousjob)andthecorresponding value of $\\mathbf{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{R}}}^{k}$ and $U^{\\check{k}^{\\prime}}$ ,solving equations $(R)$ and $(U^{g})o r(\\Bar{U}^{0})$ under inequality (1.2). V and $p$ aretakenasparametersbyworkersandfirms.  \n\n### A. The Basic Trade-Off of Specific Skills  \n\nWe can now rigorously explore the determinants of the human capital decisions. Assuming that $C^{s}=C^{g}=C>0$ as a normalization, i.e., to eliminate unimportant constants, we have the following trade-off.  \n\nPROPOSITION 1 (relative returns of each skill): Fix the level of the job finding rate $p$ and thevalue of avacancy $V$  \n\n$(b)$ Duration of jobs: Jobs last longer when workers have invested in specific human capital instead of general human capital, i.e., the limit productivity $R^{g}$ isstrictly largerthan $R^{s}$   \n(c) Trade-off: The choice of specific skills occurswhentheeffectofthesecondmechanismdominatestheeffectofthefirstone.  \n\n(a) Outside option of workers: Unemployed workers are better off if they have previouslyinvested ingeneralskillsrather than specific skills, i.e.,. $U^{g}\\geq U^{0}$ with,when $p=$ 0, $U^{\\check{g}}=U^{0}=b/(r+\\delta)$  \n\n# PROOF:  \n\nOn (a), unemployed workers with $k^{\\prime}=g$ have an additional option compared to unemployed workers with $k^{\\prime}=0$ : they may decide not to pay any skill investment costs and just retain their skill level $h^{g}$ . Thus, $U^{g}\\geq U^{0}$ When $p=0$ , no workers obtain jobs and the unemployed simply obtain the present discounted value of unemployment compensation. On (b), denote by $\\Delta R=R^{g}-R^{s}$ $\\Delta h=h^{g}-h^{s}<0$ and $\\Delta U=\\dot{U^{g}}-U^{0}\\geq0$ . By difference of equation (R) for $k=s$ $g$ we have  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle\\Delta R+\\frac{\\lambda}{r+\\lambda+\\delta}\\int_{R^{g}}^{R^{s}}\\left(1-F(\\varepsilon^{\\prime})\\right)d\\varepsilon^{\\prime}}\\ {=(r+\\delta)\\Delta U-\\Delta h.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe right-hand side is strictly positive. Noting that the left-hand side is equal to $\\int_{R^{s}}^{R^{s}+\\Delta R}\\mathrm{~}(r\\mathrm{~+~}$ $\\delta+\\lambda F(\\varepsilon^{\\prime}))d\\varepsilon^{\\prime}$ multiplied by a positive constant, $\\Delta R$ must necessarily be strictly positive.? The expected duration of a job is negatively related to $R^{k}$ , i.e., is given by $\\overset{\\cdot}{1}/\\lambda F(R^{k})$ . On (c), the decision to invest in specific skills occurs when $W_{0}^{s}=\\beta[(\\varepsilon^{0}-R^{s})/(\\dot{r+\\lambda}+\\delta)]+U^{0}>$ $W_{0}^{g}=\\beta[(\\varepsilon^{0}-R^{g})/(r+\\lambda+\\delta)]+U^{g}$ i.e., when $\\Delta U<\\beta\\Delta R/(r+\\lambda+\\delta)$  \n\nThe interpretation of (a) above is straightforward. We can interpret (b) by using equation (2.2) in the proof above. This equation indicates that, the larger $\\Delta U$ and $-\\Delta h$ ,the greater $\\Delta R$ This means that workers with general skills have a high outside option (higher by an amount $\\Delta U)$ which reduces the size of the surplus and makes the match more fragile: it more frequently occurs that idiosyncratic shocks to $\\varepsilon$ lead to job destruction for those workers. The productivity effect $h^{s}>h^{g}$ reinforces this gap between $R^{g}$ and $R^{s}$ , since specific skills bring higher productivity than general skills do. Note, however, that $\\Delta R$ is still strictly positive when $h^{s}=h^{g}$ since $\\Delta U>0$ for all positive $p$ .The interpretation of (c) is also easy. As equation (2.1) shows, the choice of skills depends on their gross returns in $\\boldsymbol{W}_{0}^{k}$ which themselves depend on the partial equilibrium reservation strategy $R^{k}$ Since $R^{s}<R^{g}$ , the higher duration of jobs of type $s$ favors specific skills, while since $U^{s}<U^{g}$ , the better outside option of workers with general human capital investment tends to discourage specific skills accumulation.  \n\n### B.Skills and Frictions  \n\nIn short, specific skills increase productivity more than general skills do, and thus improve workers’ wages and job duration. On the other hand, general skills raise the bargaining point of workers, thus both their wages and future utility derived from unemployment. In other words, the trade-off is between improving the workers' prospects within or outside the firm. This is naturally affected by two key variables: the first is the job-finding rate $p$ of the workers, a first measure of frictions. The second variable is $V_{:}$ the component of the threat point of firms $V_{:}$ which can be interpreted as another friction, in the good market, and reflects a barrier to entry when $V>0$ . As we shall see in the next section, $V$ itself depends on $p$ the exact link depends on the arbitrage forward value of $V$ and the equilibrium  determination  of $p$ and on the choice of skills by workers. For the sake of clarity, however, we will first decompose the impact of variation of each variable $p$ and $V$ on the human capital choice of workers, and will proceed to combine their impact in the next section.  \n\nTHEOREM 1 (the impact of frictions on the choice of skills):  \n\n(a) Effect of the job-finding rate p. At a fixed valueofavacancy $V$ (i) For low values of $p$ ,workers invest in specific skills. For large values of $p$ workers invest in general skills.

For any $V.$ there is at least one such $p^{M}$ Uniqueness is obtained assuming an additionalsufficientconditiondetailedin the proof. For all $p$ above $p^{M}$ workers prefer general skills; for all $p$ below that, they prefer specific skills. $p^{M}$ declines with $V$ and has a finite limit for large V.  \n\n![](images/37fa07a90cc99703058e3a71688fc05f67709a663641c9e306bd71b14578028d.jpg)  \nFIGURE 1.

The intuition of the proof of both (a) and (b) is given in a static case in Appendix B.1, while the full proof is developed in the Technical Appendix D. Claim (i) is true in the limits for small and large $p$ .Part (ii) rules out uninteresting cases by providing conditions for a unique frontier between general and specific skills. A sufficient condition is that $C$ is sufficiently large. For low values of $C$ an alternative sufficient condition is that job destruction rates are as elastic in $g$ -jobs as in $s$ -jobs for $p$ close to $p^{M}(V)$ . In unreported numerical exercises, the violation of uniqueness of $p^{M}(V)$ was neverobserved.  \n\nThe first part shows the effect of $p$ on human capital investments. This is one of the important properties of human capital decisions. This result could not be anticipated by Becker (1964) when he introduced the fruitful distinction between general and specific human capital. In Becker's frictionless world, the job-finding process is infinitely fast. However, when labor marketprospectsworsen,workerstend tofavor specifichuman capital investments.When labor markets improve, workers invest preferentially in general human capital. The reason is twofold: first, a low exit rate $p$ is associated with a higher surplus of a job; thus, workers tend to prefer longer-duration jobs consolidated by specific skills. Second, specific skills require repayment of the investment cost at the end of a spell of unemployment, which occurs less frequently when the exit rate $p$ is small.10 The second part of the theorem states that a larger threat point of firms $V$ reduces the value of surplus of workers and reduces their incentives to invest in skills, which may lead to the violation of the participation constraint (1.2).  \n\n## III. Labor Demand and Labor Market Equilibrium  \n\nTo make the exposition easier, we introduce the notion of regimes. Given the stationarity of worker decisions, regimes exactly match the choice $i=s$ $g$ of newborn workers. When $i=$ $s$ , the economy is in a (pure) regime $S$ when $i=$ g we have a (pure) regime $G$ .When workers are indifferent, there is a third case, a mixed regime $M.$ . The no-investment case is called regime 0. As we will see later on, regime $M$ is more than a zero-mass subset of the parameter space and must therefore be studied along with the pure regimes. Hereinafter, therefore, we will fully describe regimes S, M, and $G$ We simply verify ex post under which parameter condition the regime 0 is reached, using inequality (1.2).  \n\n### A.The Value of a Vacant Position and Matching  \n\nAt each contact generated through the matching process, firms face a relative fraction $\\kappa^{s}$ $\\kappa^{g}$ of workers making the investment $s,~g$ at the entry level. Under inequality (1.2) which is assumed to hold throughout, $\\kappa^{s}+\\kappa^{g}=1$ . In the pure regimes $S$ (respectively $G$ $\\kappa^{g}=0$ $\\kappa^{g}= $ 1 respectively). Denote by $\\gamma$ the cost of posting a vacancy and by $q$ the rate at which firms recruit a suitable worker. The value of a vacant position $V$ is then given by  \n\n$$\nr V=-\\gamma+q\\sum_{k=s,g}(1-\\beta)\\kappa^{k}\\Biggl(\\frac{\\varepsilon^{0}-R^{k}}{r+\\lambda+\\delta}-T\\Biggr).\n$$  \n\nThis equation thus makes a positive link between $V$ and $q$ for given values of $R^{k}$ We can now relate $V$ to $p.$ .In order to do so, we first note the explicit dependence between $q$ and $p$ :this link arises through the existence of an aggregate matching process between workers and firms. The labor force is normalized to 1, so that $u$ is both the unemployment rate and the number of unemployed workers.We assume the existence of a constant returns to scale matching function $x(u,~\\mathcal{V})$ between these $u$ unemployed workers and $\\mathcal{V}$ recruiting firms,1l such that, posing $\\theta=$ $\\mathcal{V}/u$ the labor market tightness and denoting by $q$ the transition intensity of firms from a vacancy to a filled position, $q=q(\\theta)=x(u,$ $\\mathcal{V})/\\mathcal{V}\\mathrm{with}-1<\\mathsf{\\hat{\\theta}}q^{\\prime}/q=-\\mathsf{\\hat{\\eta}}(\\theta)\\overset{\\cdot}{<}0$ , and $p=$ $p(\\theta)=\\theta q(\\theta)=x(u,\\mathcal{V})/u$ with $p^{\\prime}>0$ ,where $-\\eta(\\theta)$ is the elasticity of $q$ .Alternatively, we can represent $q$ as a function of $p$ by $q=p/\\theta=$ $p/\\theta^{-1}(p)$ with $d q/d p<0$ .For instance, with a Cobb-Douglas matching function $x(u,~V)~=$ $x_{0}u^{\\eta}\\mathcal{V}^{1-\\eta}$ we have $q=x_{0}^{1/(1-\\eta)}p^{-\\eta/(1-\\eta)}$ The curve $V(p,\\kappa^{g})$ is represented by the dashed line in Figure 1. We prove that $d V/d p<0$ in Appendix B.2. This allows us to derive a last partial equilibrium result which leads immediately to the labor market equilibrium.  \n\n### B.Entry of Firms and Equilibrium Labor MarketTightness  \n\nFree-entry of firms means that, as long as there are profit opportunities from opening a job vacancy, firms enter the market. In equilibrium, job creation opportunities are exhausted so that the value of a job vacancy is zero. This defines $p^{*}(\\kappa^{g})$ , the equilibrium value of $p$ in a given regime, by:  \n\nthe parameters, we may instead have a situation in which $p^{S}>p^{M}>p^{\\tilde{G}}$ In such a case, no pure regime exists. In this case, regime $M$ emerges and represents a natural convexification of the problem. Its characterization is considered in the next section.  \n\n### C. Pure Regimes  \n\nThe pure regimes are described by a pair $(R^{k}.$ $\\theta^{K})$ solving the conventional equations (JD) and (JC) with $k=s$ $g$ if $K=S$ $G$ , respectively:  \n\n$$\nV(p^{*}(\\kappa^{g}),\\kappa^{g})=0.\n$$  \n\nThe value $p^{*}(\\kappa^{g})$ is represented in Figure 1 by the intersection with the horizontal axis. To simplify the notations, denote by $p^{G}=p^{*}(1)$ $p^{S}\\doteq p^{*}(0)$ , and $\\theta^{K}$ the corresponding value for $K=S$ $G$ , M. As we shall see now, the freeentry condition simultaneously determines the regime $K$ and the corresponding value of $p$ in equilibrium.  \n\nPROPOSITION 2: If $p^{G}>p^{M},$ then the economy is in pure regime $G$ If $\\boldsymbol{p}^{S}<\\boldsymbol{p}^{M}$ the economy is in pure regime S. In equilibrium, regimes $S$ and $G$ cannot coexist.Finally,a mixed strategy regime emerges when no pure regime occurs.  \n\n# PROOF:  \n\nFor each different pure regime, there is a different curve $V(p,0)$ and $V(p,1)$ . Proposition 1 indicates that, for a given level of $p,R^{s}$ is smaller that $R^{g}$ . This implies that $V(p,1)$ is below $V(p,0)$ . This in turn implies that $\\bar{p}^{S}>p^{G}$ simply reflecting that firms prefer workers with specific skills because they are more productive and have lower outside options. Now, depending on the parameters, one can have either $\\dot{p}^{S}<$ $p^{\\breve{M}}$ or the opposite. In the first case, regime $S$ can indeed occur. However, if $p^{S}>p^{\\breve{M}}$ ,then regime $S$ does not exists. The same reasoning applies to regime $G$ If $p^{G}>p^{M}$ then regime $G$ exists; otherwise it does not. This reasoning provides two further insights. First, since $p^{S}>$ $\\overset{\\cdot}{p}^{G}$ , one cannot have, at the same time, $p^{S}\\overset{\\cdot}{<}p^{M}$ (regime $S$ ）and $p^{G}>p^{M}$ (regime $G$ ): multiple regimes cannot coexist. Second, depending on  \n\n$$\nR^{k}+h^{k}+\\frac{\\lambda}{r+\\lambda+\\delta}\\int_{R^{k}}^{\\varepsilon_{0}}\\left(1-F(\\varepsilon^{\\prime})\\right)d\\varepsilon^{\\prime}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle=b+\\frac{\\beta}{1-\\beta}\\gamma\\theta^{\\kappa}-p(\\theta^{\\kappa}){\\cal J}_{k}C^{s}-(r+\\delta)T,}}\\ {{\\mathrm{}}}\\ {{\\displaystyle{\\bf C})\\frac{\\gamma}{q(\\theta^{\\kappa})}=(1-\\beta)\\bigg(\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}-R^{k}}{r+\\lambda+\\delta}-T\\bigg)},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwith $J_{k}$ equal to zero if $k=g$ and 1 if $k=s.$ The first equation is obtained by combining (R) and $(\\mathrm{U}^{k^{\\prime}})$ for $k^{\\prime}=0$ $g$ when $V=0$ and by replacing the surplus of the worker in $(\\mathrm{U}^{k^{\\prime}})$ by its equilibrium value $\\beta/(1-\\beta)*\\gamma/q(\\theta)$ . This equation represents the job destruction margin. The binary variable ${{J}_{k}}$ indicates that specific skills acquisition must be paid for by the workers at each new job, which reduces their threat point and thus raises the stability of matches $k=s.$ . The second equation is simply the vacancy equation (V) combined with free entry (FE). It represents the job creation margin. The proof of existence and uniqueness of $R^{k}$ and $\\theta^{K}$ within a regime would follow closely that proposed by Mortensen and Pissarides (1999): (JC) and (JD) have opposite slopes and market viability is insured by a sufficient value of $\\varepsilon_{0}$ Finally, $T$ reduces $R^{k}$ in (JD) at a given $\\theta^{K}$ but reduces $\\theta^{K}$ in (JC) at a given $R^{k}$ , which is the standard effect of employment protection: ambiguous effect on $\\theta^{K}$ and a decrease of $R^{k}$  \n\n### D. Mixed Equilibrium  \n\nMixed equilibrium is characterized by a quadruple $(R^{g},R^{s},\\theta^{M},\\kappa^{g})$ , i.e., the reservation strategy of matches with general and specific skills, labor market tightness, and the fraction of workers at the entry level investing in general skills. This quadruple is obtained as the solution to the indifference condition of workers, to two job destruction margins, and to a job creation margin. These four equations are:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}{\\displaystyle{W_{0}^{g}=W_{0}^{s}\\Leftrightarrow\\beta\\frac{R^{g}-R^{s}}{r+\\lambda+\\delta}}}&{}&\\ {\\displaystyle{=\\frac{p(\\theta^{M})C}{r+\\delta+p(\\theta^{M})},}}&\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{(JD^{\\calM})}\\quad R^{k}+h^{k}+\\frac{\\lambda}{r+\\lambda+\\delta}\\int_{R^{k}}^{\\varepsilon_{0}}\\left(1-{\\cal F}(\\varepsilon^{\\prime})\\right)d\\varepsilon^{\\prime}\n$$  \n\n$$\n=b+p(\\theta^{M})\\beta{\\Bigg(}{\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}-R^{k}}{r+\\lambda+\\delta}}-T{\\Bigg)}\n$$  \n\n$$\n-\\L{p}(\\theta^{M}){\\cal J}_{k}C^{s}-(r+\\delta)T\\qquad\\mathrm{for}k=s,g,\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{(\\mathbf{J}\\mathbf{C}^{M})}&{V(p^{M},\\kappa^{g})=0\\Leftrightarrow\\displaystyle\\frac{\\gamma}{q(\\theta^{M})}=(1-\\beta)}\\ &{\\quad\\quad\\quad\\times\\left(\\displaystyle\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}-(1-\\kappa^{g})R^{g}-\\kappa^{g}R^{g}}{r+\\lambda+\\delta}-T\\right).}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe uniqueness of the quadruple is proved in two steps. First, $\\theta^{M}$ is unique and determined from Theorem 1 applied to $V=0$ . Second, the value of $\\kappa^{g}$ is uniquely determined by the last equation in the system above. Graphically in Figure 1, $\\kappa^{g}$ shifts the curve $V(p,\\kappa^{g})$ , and the equilibrium value of $\\kappa^{g}$ is such that the intersection with the horizontal axis is precisely at $p^{M}$ . Appendix C shows the existence of a steady-state, mixed-strategy equilibrium: $\\kappa^{g}$ is related to the mixed strategy of workers by a one-to-one correspondence between $\\kappa^{g}$ and the fraction of the unemployed workers without general skills randomly choosing general skills at entry into the firm, denoted by $\\alpha^{g}$  \n\n### E. Closing the Model  \n\nUnemployment is determined by  steadystate conditions on worker flows. Detailed calculations are presented in Appendix C. In  \n\n![](images/af5e8af9d37852e1fe5df3ef48572a3a08082f483926f8596ddbf1bb95758d74.jpg)  \nFIGURE 2.ROLE OF WORKERS’BARGAINING STRENGTH $\\beta$ AND EMPLOYMENT PROTECTION $T$ ON THE DETERMINATIONOF THEREGIME  \n\nregime $K$ $K=S$ $G$ , the total unemployment rate is simply  \n\n$$\nu^{K}=\\frac{\\delta+\\lambda F(R^{k})}{p+\\delta+\\lambda F(R^{k})}.\n$$  \n\nIn the mixed regime, unemployment is more complex but is derived from the system (C10) and (C11) in Appendix C.  \n\n### F. Parameter Space and the Regimes  \n\nConsider the following limit cases: first, fix $T.$ When $\\beta$ is very close to zero, we have regime O, as workers have little incentive to invest in skills. When $\\beta$ is positive but small, equation (JC) implies that tightness is large, and thus from Theorem 1 at $V=0$ , we have regime $G$ When $\\beta\\to1$ , equation (JC) implies that $\\theta\\to0$ while $\\theta^{M}$ remains finite, implying regime $S$ Now, fix $\\beta$ but let $T$ vary. A larger $T$ reduces the surplus, profits, and labor market tightness, which raises the likelihood of an $S$ regime. At a given level of $\\beta$ . a sufficiently large $T$ may eventually lead to regime O. In the space parameter $(T,\\beta)$ , we can thus illustrate the different regimes we obtain in Figure 2.  \n\nA very similar picture can be drawn when replacing $T$ by the inverse of the scale parameter of the matching function: the larger the search frictions, the stronger the incentives to acquire specific skills. The same is true if $T$ is replaced by unemployment benefits $b$ , but for a different reason: a larger $b$ raises wages and reduces profits. Aggregate job creation, and thus $p$ is lower, raising the relative returns to specific skills.  \n\nIt follows from the analysis above that the mixed regime is obtained for a potentially large combination of parameters, such that $\\theta^{G}<$ $\\theta^{M}<\\theta^{S}$ , and not for a zero-measure set, while pure regimes are corner solutions to the problem of skills investment. The mix regime is thus a convenient macroeconomic representation of a more general problem  in  which workers can invest continuously in both types of skills, detailed as follows.  \n\n## IV. Extensions  \n\n### A.Theorem 1 with Continuous Investments inSkills  \n\nSo far we have restricted human capital investments as being discrete and instantaneous at job entry. These assumptions are mostly for convenience, to avoid accounting for a too-complex distribution of workers. Nevertheless, the former assumption can be relaxed to obtain a result similar to Theorem 1 in partial equilibrium. Assume that investments in human capital are made continuously with intensity $i^{s}$ and $i^{g}$ ,at a cost $C(i^{s},$ $i^{g}$ ）where $C$ is increasing and convex for each variable. Workers obtain a human capital level $h=f(h^{g}(i^{g}),h^{s}(i^{s}))$ where $f(\\cdot),h^{g}(i^{g})$ and $h^{s}(i^{s})$ are increasing functions. Denote by  \n\n$$\n\\Phi={\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial i^{g}}}\n$$  \n\nthe slope of the outside option of employed workers with respect to their general human capital investments. One can easily derive that  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial W_{0}}{\\partial i^{g}}=B\\frac{\\partial W_{0}}{\\partial i^{s}}+A\\Phi,\n$$  \n\nwhere $A$ is a positive function of parameters and  \n\n$$\nB=\\frac{(\\partial f/\\partial h^{g})(d h^{g}/d i^{g})}{(\\partial f/\\partial h^{s})(d h^{s}/d i^{s})}>0\n$$  \n\nis a corrective term for possible differences in gross returns to skill investment. 12 One can prove fairly easily, in the spirit of Appendix B.1, that the higher the jobfinding rate $p$ thehigher $\\Phi$ and thus thehigher is theinvestment in general skills and the lower the investment in specific skills. We do not derive the demand side of the model with this continuous investment specification.13  \n\n### B.Education Choices  \n\nTheorem 1 can also be easily extended to education choices. Assume that general skills are acquired at the beginning of the worker's life, while specific skills are acquired at entry into the first job. Dirk Krueger and Krishna Kumar (2004a, b) introduced a similar setup and focus on growth differentials between Europe and the United States. They do not deal with the choice of skills, which is assumed to depend on national policies, but they investigate optimal levels of national policies.  \n\nIn our model, agents may first decide whether to invest in general skills at school or to work. On the job, they may then decide whether to invest in specific skills. Thus $h$ can take three values $(h^{s},h^{g})$ $\\boldsymbol{h}^{\\star+g}$ 0. The program of the newborn worker is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{(r+\\delta)U^{0}}\\ &{\\quad=b+\\operatorname*{max}_{i\\to{i+j\\operatorname*{max}(W_{0}^{i+j}-C^{j}-U^{i})}}],}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $i$ characterizes the education choice (none, i.e., O or general, $g\\dot{\\phantom{0}}$ ）and $j$ characterizes the choice of specific skills (O or $s$ 0. Provided that $h^{s+g}$ is not too large compared to $h^{g}$ we obtain the same properties as in Theorem 1. The argument runs as follows: in some cases, workers with a general education may find it too costly to reinvest in specific skills if $p$ and,more generally, job turnover are large, as they must reinvest in specific skills with every new job. In such a case, the program would thus simplify to  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{(r+\\delta)U^{0}=b+\\operatorname*{max}[-C^{g}+p(W_{0}^{i+j}-C^{j}}\\ {-{U^{g}});p(W_{0}^{s}-C^{s}-U^{0})].}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIn this case, it appears, even more clearly than in Section II, that as the job-finding rate $p$ goes to zero, the costs of general investments dominate the benefits, and the economy ends up in an S-regime. We thus obtain the same impact of frictions on the nature of investments.  \n\nInterestingly, the system of equations characterizing this economy is exactly the same as (JD) and (JC): the benchmark “on-the-job training\" and the “education model’ have identical steady states.14  \n\n### C. Firm-Sponsored Training  \n\nReturning to the initial specification of investments in human capital, another possible extension is to allow for a sharing of training costs. While, following Becker (1964), it is natural to assume that workers pay for general human capital—as they receive all the benefits from their investmentone can also imagine that the costs of specific human capital are partly or fully paid by the firm. Let us first assume that firms want to subsidize a fixed part of training costs; say that $C^{s}$ is shared equally by workers and frms.15 We retain the assumption that workers pay the full cost of general human capital investment $C^{g}$ . We also normalize costs such that $C^{s}=C^{g}=C$ The resolution of the model is unchanged, except that (JC) and (JD) curves are now, in regime $S$  \n\n$$\n\\gamma/q(\\theta^{s})=(1-\\beta)\\bigg(\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}-R^{s}}{r+\\lambda+\\delta}-T\\bigg)-C/2\\quad\\mathrm{and}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle R^{s}+h^{s}+\\frac{\\lambda}{r+\\lambda+\\delta}\\int_{R^{s}}^{\\varepsilon_{0}}\\left(1-F(\\varepsilon^{\\prime})\\right)d\\varepsilon^{\\prime}}}\\ {{\\displaystyle~=b+\\frac{\\beta}{1-\\beta}\\gamma\\theta^{s}-p(\\theta^{s})C/2-(r+\\delta)T,}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhile they are unchanged in the $G$ -regime. The main insight here is that firms gain from fostering specific skills acquisition by gaining more productive and stable workers, but they need to share the training cost. This shifts down the (JC) curve above (a lower $\\theta^{S}$ at a given $\\boldsymbol{R}^{s}$ 0.As workers have to repay only half of the training cost in their next job, they have a better outside option and the reservation productivity $R^{k}$ becomes higher. All properties of Theorem 1 and Proposition 1 remain true, but the frontier between general and specific skills in equation (3.1) is also affected: $p C$ must be replaced by (p - r - 8)C/2.16  \n\nWe can push the logic further and allow firms to compensate workers in order to induce specific investments. Given the timing of events, this ex post transfer to the workers would be difficult to implement, since workers might anticipate a hold-up given the nature of these investment costs, which are sunk. However, allowing for this possibility does not alter our conclusions: a $G$ -regime still exists because firms are not always able to induce specific investments when worker incentives to acquire general skills are too strong.  \n\n### D. Technological Choices by Firms  \n\nFirms have another option to induce workers to choose specific investments. They might, for instance, invest to raise the productivity of the workers $h^{s}$ Or $h^{g}$ . Here again, the extreme points in the parameter space are going to be unaffected by the firm's investment strategy: indeed, if workers are biased toward general investments in human capital, the firm is not going to spend any resources on raising the productivity of a specific technology. Instead, it will prefer to raise the productivity of the general technology. The same is true when workers are biased toward investments in specific human capital: firms prefer to invest in specific technologies. There is thus a strong complementarity between firm and worker behavior. This reinforces the differences between $S$ and $G$ economies, as well as the stability of each equilibrium with respect to changes in the macroeconomic environment. In the neighborhood of the mixed regime, instead, firms will be able to turn workers’ decisions into specific human capital by raising $h^{s}$  \n\n## V. Concluding Comments  \n\nThis paper has derived a usually ignored property of human capital: specific human capital investments have a higher relative return compared to general human capital investments when the job-finding rate is low. In general equilibrium, high employment protection raises the probability that workers will choose specific skills, by two effects: in raising the duration of jobs, it raises the relative return to specific skills; by depressing the labor market, it reduces the relative return to general skills.  \n\nFuture research could extend the model to discuss cross-country differences between labor markets. First, our model affords an alternative way of describing differences in the labor market in Europe and the United States. As a matter of fact, in a different strand of literature, Margarita Estevez et al. (2001） discuss, with no formal model, the functioning of labor markets in welfare states and notably emphasize the role of several labor market institutions on skill investments. They confirm in an accurate manner the fact that several ingredients of European labor markets, such as unemployment benefits (not discussed here) or employment protection, generate sector-specific skills.  \n\nThe impact of employment protection on human capital decisions echoes approaches where the interaction of shocks and institutions plays a central role (Blanchard and Justin Wolfers, 2000; Ljungqvist and Sargent, 1998, 2004). In our setup, macroeconomic shocks leading to job reallocation can interact with institutions that promote specific skills. S-economies or Ssectors are naturally hurt to a greater extent by job reallocation shocks, as workers have to retrain at potentially high costs. Dynamic implications could be explored: higher frictional unemployment may result, if, in addition, one considers that retraining workers takes time.17 Exploring cross-country differences along these lines would require improvements in the setup: notably, the human capital choices could deal with nonstationarity and provide a convincing quantitative exercise.  \n\nSecond, worker turnover is connected with geographic mobility. In this spirit, Bertola and Andrea Ichino (1995) have claimed that mobility costs are a central factor in the diverging development between the United States and Europe. In their setup, mobility interacts with wage institutions. Our model indicates the same direction: labor mobility costs are higher in Europe, due here to the different nature of human capital investments.18  \n\nFinally, at this stage, our model does not distinguish between job and worker fows. This is due to the fact that wages are continuously renegotiated after shocks to the productivity of the firm, implying that separation decisions are jointly efficient. Blanchard and Portugal (2001) have illustrated, however, that worker fows exhibited stronger differences between the United States and Portugal than did job fows. With the introduction of a distinction between job and worker flows (by imposing, as in Blanchard and Portugal, rigidities in wages and shocks to the utility of workers), a model based on specific human capital investments provides new insights. Indeed, while a tax on layoffs--our parameter $T-$ —is  a  direct  determinant  of  job destruction decisions by firms, the amount of specific human capital accumulated by workers acts, instead, as a penalty imposed on workers in case of a separation, which is thus a direct determinant of frequency of quitting and worker flows. With the extension suggested above, the model can be a starting point for a more general theory of job and worker flows.  \n\n### APPENDIX A: BELLMAN EQUATIONS AND WAGES  \n\nWe have for each $k=g$ s(and $k^{\\prime}=0,g$ the respective values of worker and firm surplus in the continuation and entry stage:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\mathbf{\\Psi}\\cdot+\\updelta+\\lambda)[W^{k}(\\varepsilon)-U^{k^{\\prime}}]=w^{k}(\\varepsilon)-(r+\\updelta)U^{k^{\\prime}}+\\lambda\\displaystyle\\int\\operatorname*{max}[0,W^{k}(z)-U^{k^{\\prime}}]d F(z),}\\ &{\\mathbf{\\Psi}\\cdot+\\updelta+\\lambda)[J^{k}(\\varepsilon)-V+T]=\\varepsilon+h^{k}-w^{k}(\\varepsilon)+(r+\\updelta)T-r V}\\ &{\\qquad+\\displaystyle\\lambda\\displaystyle\\int\\operatorname*{max}[0,J^{k}(z)-V+T]d F(z),}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{(r+\\delta+\\lambda)[W_{0}^{k}-U^{k^{\\prime}}]=w_{0}^{k}-(r+\\delta)U^{k^{\\prime}}+\\lambda\\displaystyle\\int\\operatorname*{max}[0,W^{k}(z)-U^{k^{\\prime}}]d F(z),}}\\ {{\\mathrm{}~}}\\ {{\\mathrm{}~+\\left.\\delta+\\lambda)[J_{0}^{k}-V]=\\varepsilon_{0}+h^{k}-w_{0}^{k}-\\left(r+\\delta\\right)V-\\lambda T}}\\ {{\\mathrm{}~}}\\ {{\\mathrm{}~+\\lambda\\displaystyle\\int\\operatorname*{max}[0,J^{k}(z)-V+T]d F(z).}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe total surplus in the continuation stage thus follows the rule:  \n\n$$\n(r+\\lambda+\\delta)S^{k}(\\varepsilon)=\\varepsilon+h^{k}-(r+\\delta)(U^{k^{\\prime}}-T)-r V+\\lambda\\int\\operatorname*{max}[0,S(z)]d F(z),\n$$  \n\n$$\n(r+\\lambda+\\delta)S_{0}^{k}=\\varepsilon_{0}+h^{k}-(r+\\delta)U^{k^{\\prime}}-r V-\\lambda T+\\lambda\\int\\operatorname*{max}[0,S(z)]d F(z),\n$$  \n\n$$\n{\\mathrm{which~notably~implies:}}S_{0}^{k}=S^{k}(\\varepsilon_{0})-T.\n$$  \n\nThe latter equality determines that  \n\n$$\nS_{0}^{k}=\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}-R^{k}}{r+\\lambda+\\delta}-T,\n$$  \n\n$$\n{\\mathrm{and~}}W_{0}^{k}=\\beta{\\Big(}{\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}-R^{k}}{r+\\lambda+\\delta}}-T{\\Big)}+U^{k^{\\prime}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathtt{R}^{k}$ is defined in equation (R) in the text. After Nash bargaining, wages are given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{w_{0}^{k}=(1-\\beta)(r+\\delta)U^{k^{\\prime}}+\\beta[\\varepsilon_{0}+h^{k}-r V-\\lambda T],}}\\ {{}}\\ {{w^{k}(\\varepsilon)=(1-\\beta)(r+\\delta)U^{k^{\\prime}}+\\beta[\\varepsilon+h^{k}-r V+(r+\\delta)T].}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nInitial bargaining over $w_{0}^{k}$ is not directly affected by firing tax $T$ because the initial threat point of the firm is simply $V$ and not $V-T,T$ still has an indirect impact because it strikes after the first shock. Indeed, the entry wage $w_{0}^{k}$ is negatively affected by the term $-\\lambda T.$ The continuation wage rises with $T$ because the same negative surplus effect $-\\lambda T$ is compensated by the increase in the relative bargaining position of workers, which adds $(r+\\lambda+\\delta)T$ to the wage.  \n\nAPPENDIX B: PROOFS  \n\n#### B.1. Proof of Theorem 1 in a Static Context  \n\nTheorem 1 concerns a model with a full intertemporal structure, with endogenous destruction and with firing costs which themselves generate a two-tier wage structure. The full proof will thus require a fair amount of calculation. Indeed, it requires us to derive the sign of $W_{0}^{g}-W_{0}^{s}$ (if positive, workers chose general skills) and of $\\boldsymbol{W}_{0}^{k}-\\boldsymbol{C}^{k}-\\dot{\\boldsymbol{U}}^{k^{\\prime}}$ (if negative, workers prefer not to invest at all). These value functions are not explicit, but depend on $R^{k}$ , which is itself implicitly defined through the job destruction equation (R).  \n\nThe main idea can be captured, however, in a very simple way. Let us assume away any dynamics and consider a simpler economy where agents live through two periods, do not discount the future, lose their jobs after the end of the first period, and obtain new jobs with probability $p\\leq1$ .Workers obtain a share $\\beta$ of the marginal product $h^{k}$ net of the threat point of firms $V$ .Thereare no unemployment benefits. Then, denoting with a hat the value functions in this static economy, we have that workers’ valuation of a job with general and specific skills is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\quad\\hat{W}^{g}=\\beta(h^{g}-V)+p\\operatorname*{max}[\\beta(h^{g}-V),\\beta(h^{s}-V)-C],}\\ &{\\quad\\quad\\hat{W}^{s}=\\beta(h^{s}-V)+p\\operatorname*{max}[\\beta(h^{g}-V)-C,\\beta(h^{s}-V)-C],}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $-C$ in both equations means that workers repay the training cost in specific skills. It follows that  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\hat{W}^{g}=\\beta(h^{g}-V)+p\\beta(h^{g}-V),\\qquad\\mathrm{if~}g\\succ s,}\\ &{}\\ &{\\hat{W}^{s}=\\beta(h^{s}-V)+p\\beta(h^{s}-V)-p C,\\qquad\\mathrm{if~}s\\succ g.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nDenote $h^{g}\\mathrm{~-~}h^{s}<0$ as $\\Delta h$ . By difference of the two equations above, the indifference curve between the types of skills is defined by  \n\n$$\ng\\succ s\\Leftrightarrow\\hat{W}^{g}>\\hat{W}^{s}\\Leftrightarrow\\beta\\Delta h+p(\\beta\\Delta h+C)>0.\n$$  \n\nDenote by $\\hat{\\Lambda}(p)=\\beta\\Delta h+p(\\beta\\Delta h+C)$ the corresponding function. Its intercept is $\\beta\\Delta h<0.$ If $C+$ $\\beta\\Delta h<0$ , the function is negative for all $0\\leq p\\leq1$ : workers always prefer specific skills, because retraining is cheap. If $C$ is sufficiently large, the function $\\hat{\\Lambda}(p)$ is increasing in $p$ and, above $p^{M}=$ $(1-C\\breve{/}(\\beta\\Delta h))^{-\\frac{1}{1}}<1$ , workers prefer general skills. Note that $p^{M}$ is independent of $V$ The participation constraints define nonincreasing curves in $(p,V)$ and we have  \n\n![](images/7659032104a46016812abb1ca4332e6c7647beb3c5a360bbbea896a1d9cf510e.jpg)  \nFIGURE B.1. PARTIAL EQUILIBRIUM IN A SIMPLER, STATICCONTEXT: EFFECT OF FRICTIONS $V$ (THREAT POINT OF FIRMS) AND$p$ (JOB FINDING PROBABILITY) ON THE WORKER SKILLS CHOICE  \n\nNote: A thinner line indicates that the border between areas still exists but is irrelevant in this region.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{0\\succ g\\Leftrightarrow\\hat{W}^{g}-C<0\\Leftrightarrow V>h^{g}-\\displaystyle\\frac{C}{\\beta(1+p)},}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{0\\succ s\\Leftrightarrow\\hat{W}^{s}-C<0\\Leftrightarrow V>h^{s}-\\displaystyle\\frac{C}{\\beta}.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIn other words, we obtain a partition of the space summarized in Figure B.1.  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{B}.2.~S l o p e~o f~V(p,~\\kappa^{g})\n$$  \n\nToobtain $d V/d p$ , we need to differentiate fully two equations: first, equation (V), and second, combination of (R) and $(\\mathrm{U}^{g})$ eliminating the value of $U^{g}$ ,i.e.,  \n\n$$\nR^{g}+h^{g}+\\frac{\\lambda}{r+\\lambda+\\delta}\\int_{R^{g}}^{\\varepsilon_{0}}\\left(1-F(\\varepsilon^{\\prime})\\right)d\\varepsilon^{\\prime}=r V-(r+\\delta)T+b+p\\beta\\bigg(\\frac{\\varepsilon^{0}-R^{g}}{r+\\lambda+\\delta}-T\\bigg),\n$$  \n\nThe derivative of those equations with respect to $p$ then yields  \n\n$$\nr\\frac{d V}{d p}=\\frac{d q}{d p}A_{0}-A_{1}\\frac{d R^{g}}{d p},\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d R^{g}}{d p}A_{2}=r\\frac{d V}{d p},\n$$  \n\nwhere $A_{0},A_{1}$ , and $A_{2}$ are unreported, positive coefficients. As explained in the text, the matching function implies that $q$ can be represented as a decreasing function of $p$ : dqldp $<0$ It follows that, necessarily, $d V/d p<0$ . The proof is by contradiction: assume that dVldp is positive. Equation (B2) would imply that $d R^{g}/d p>0$ , which in turn implies from equation (B1) that dVldp is negative, which violates the assumption.  \n\nAPPENDIX C: STOCKS AND FLOWS  \n\nIn a steady state, there are a number $e^{0}$ of new jobs, i.e., jobs at the entry value $\\varepsilon_{0}$ . The total number of jobs is denoted by $e$ .We have  \n\n$$\nd e^{0}/d t=(1-e)p-(\\delta+\\lambda)e^{0}=0.\n$$  \n\nIn regime $G$ denoting by $u^{g}$ and $u^{0}$ the stocks of unemployed workers with general or no human capital, we have  \n\n$$\nd u^{0}/d t=\\delta-(p+\\delta)u^{0},\n$$  \n\n$$\nd u^{g}/d t=(1-u^{0}-u^{g})\\lambda F(R^{g})-(p+\\updelta)u^{g},\n$$  \n\nwhere the first line shows that changes in $u^{0}$ equal the difference between the arrival of newborn workers (the total active population is normalized to unity) and the successful job seekers in that pool (remembering that a fraction $\\delta$ of them dies). The second line states that changes in $u^{g}$ equal the difference between the arrivals of laid-off workers and successful job seekers in that pool (still accounting for deaths in the pool). In a steady state,  \n\n$$\nu^{0}=\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta+p},\n$$  \n\n$$\nu^{g}=\\frac{p}{\\delta+p}\\frac{\\lambda F(R^{g})}{\\delta+p+\\lambda F(R^{g})}.\n$$  \n\nThe sum of the two rates trivially yields $u^{G}$ in the text. In regime $S$ in which every one invests in specific skills, the derivation of steady-state unemployment is straightforward and we obtain the usual value for the unemployment rate u? in the text.  \n\nIn the mixed regime, we must calculate the steady-state stocks of workers in each state: $u^{0},u^{g},e^{s}$ $e^{g}$ Wwith $e^{k}$ the number of “employed\" workers with human capital $k,k=s,g$ Wehave  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{d u^{0}/d t=\\delta+e^{s}\\lambda F(R^{s})-(p+\\delta)u^{0},}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{d u^{g}/d t=\\lambda F(R^{g})e^{g}-(p+\\delta)u^{g},}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{d e^{g}/d t=\\alpha^{g}p u^{0}+u^{g}p-(\\delta+\\lambda F(R^{g}))e^{g},}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{d e^{s}/d t=(1-\\alpha^{g})p u^{0}-(\\delta+\\lambda F(R^{s}))e^{s}.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIt follows that, in a steady state, $u^{0}$ and $u^{g}$ solve  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle{u^{0}=\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta+p}\\left(1-\\frac{\\lambda F(R^{g})}{\\delta+\\lambda F(R^{g})}\\frac{p}{\\delta+p}\\left(1-\\alpha^{g}\\right)\\right)^{-1},}}\\ {\\displaystyle{u^{g}=\\frac{\\lambda F(R^{g})}{\\delta+\\lambda F(R^{g})}\\frac{p}{p+\\delta}\\frac{\\alpha^{g}u^{0}}{1-\\displaystyle{\\frac{p}{p+\\delta}\\frac{\\lambda F(R^{g})}{\\delta+\\lambda F(R^{g})}}}.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIt is easy to verify that $\\alpha^{g}=0$ and $\\alpha^{g}=1$ revert to the pure regimes ( $\\mathbf{\\chi}_{u}^{S}$ and $u^{G}$ in the text).  \n\nEmployers recruit workers with general skills from both the pool of workers with general skills $u^{g}$ and a fraction $\\alpha^{g}$ of workers from the pool of workers without skills $u^{0}$ i.e.,  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\kappa^{g}}{\\kappa^{s}}=\\frac{\\alpha^{g}u^{0}+u^{g}}{\\alpha^{s}u^{0}}=\\frac{\\alpha^{g}+u^{g}/u^{0}}{\\alpha^{s}}.\n$$  \n\nTogether with (C11) expressing the ratio of $u^{0}$ to $u^{g}$ we obtain an expression relating $\\alpha^{g}$ to $\\kappa^{g}$  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\kappa^{g}}{1-\\kappa^{g}}=\\frac{\\alpha^{g}}{1-\\alpha^{g}}\\left(1+\\frac{\\lambda F(R^{g})}{\\delta+p+\\lambda F(R^{g})}\\frac{p}{\\delta}\\right).\n$$  \n\nNaturally, $\\kappa^{g}\\geq\\alpha^{g}$ .Further, $\\delta=0$ implies that $\\kappa^{g}=1$ whatever $\\alpha^{g}$ (i.e., the entire labor force would become skilled with general human capital in steady state). It is possible to describe the full set of $\\kappa^{g}$ in [O, 1] with any mixed strategy $0<\\alpha^{g}<1$ of newborn workers. This proves the existence of a steady-state mixed strategy equilibrium.  \n\nAPPENDIX D: TECHNICAL APPENDIX  \n\nFull Proof of Theorem 1  \n\nThe strategy of the proof is to express all quantities involved in workers’ choices of skills—-namely $W_{0}^{g}$ $-\\mathrm{~}W_{0}^{s}$ and $\\breve{W_{0}^{\\acute{k}}}-C^{k}\\stackrel{\\cdot}{-}U^{k^{\\prime}},$ -as functions of three variables: $R^{k},p$ and $V.$ The strategy is then to show that $\\stackrel{..}{R}^{k}$ are themselves a function of $p$ and $V.$ We can thus replicate the proof of Appendix B and define three frontiers in the space $(p,V)$ . The indifference between $s$ and $g$ skills defines a curve $p^{M}(V)$ .We will show that the choice of skills depends on whether $p$ is smaller or larger than $p^{M}(V)$ . For that, let us denote by a tilde the value functions or threshold points defined by the arbitrage equations, but extended out of the range, i.e., for instance, $\\tilde{U}^{g}(p,V)\\equiv U^{g}(p,V)$ even when $p$ and $V$ are such that workers prefer specific skills. The variables with a tilde thus coincide with workers? optimal behavior for some $p,V,$ but not all values. They are convenient mathematical objects used to express workers? choices precisely.  \n\nStep $I$ The quantities $\\tilde{R}^{k}$ and $\\tilde{U}^{k^{\\prime}}$ are calculated from equations (R) and $(\\mathrm{U}^{k^{\\prime}})$ in the text. Using the difference operator $\\Delta X$ as the difference between $X^{g}$ and $X^{s}$ (or $X^{0}$ when relevant), we have  \n\n$$\n\\tilde{W}_{0}^{g}-\\tilde{W}_{0}^{s}=\\Delta\\tilde{W}_{0}=\\Delta\\tilde{U}-\\beta\\Delta\\tilde{R}(r+\\lambda+\\delta)^{-1},\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n\\Delta\\tilde{U}=\\frac{p}{r+\\delta}\\left[C-\\frac{\\beta\\Delta\\tilde{R}}{r+\\lambda+\\delta}\\right].\n$$  \n\nUsing this equation in (D1), we have that  \n\n$$\n\\Delta\\tilde{W}_{0}>0\\Leftrightarrow p C-\\beta\\Delta\\tilde{R}\\frac{r+\\delta+p}{r+\\lambda+\\delta}>0.\n$$  \n\nLet us now denote by $\\tilde{R}^{k}(V,p)$ the function obtained implicitly from the job destruction rule (R) and $(\\mathrm{U}^{k^{\\prime}})$ and by $\\Delta\\Tilde{R}(V,\\dot{p})$ the difference $\\tilde{R}^{g}-\\tilde{R}^{s}$ . The properties of $\\tilde{R}^{k}(V,p)$ and $\\Delta\\Tilde{R}(V,p)$ are stated in Lemma A1.  \n\nStep 2.  \n\nLEMMA A1 (fragility of the match): The separation between worker and the firm is more frequent if p and $V$ are higher, i.e.,the reservation rule $\\tilde{R}^{k}$ is increasing in both $p$ and $V$ When $p\\rightarrow\\infty$ both reservationrulesconvergetoacommonvalue, $\\Delta\\tilde{R}\\rightarrow0$  \n\nPROOF:  \n\nCombining (R) and $(\\mathrm{{U}}^{k^{\\prime}})$ , one obtains  \n\n$$\n\\widetilde{R}^{k}\\bigg(1+\\frac{p\\beta}{r+\\lambda+\\delta}\\bigg)+\\frac{\\lambda}{r+\\lambda+\\delta}\\int_{\\widetilde{R}^{k}}^{\\varepsilon u}\\left(1-F(\\varepsilon^{\\prime})\\right)d\\varepsilon^{\\prime}=H_{k}(V,p),\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\nH_{k}(V)=h^{k}+r V-(r+\\delta)T+p\\beta\\bigg(\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}}{r+\\lambda+\\delta}-T\\bigg)+J_{k}p C,\n$$  \n\nwhere $I_{k}$ equal zero if $k=g$ and 1 if $k=s$ . Differentiating equation (D3) with respect to $p$ and $V$ we obtain  \n\n$$\nd\\tilde{R}^{k}\\bigg(\\underbrace{1-\\lambda\\frac{1-F(\\tilde{R}^{k})}{r+\\lambda+\\delta}+\\frac{p\\beta}{r+\\lambda+\\delta}}_{>0}\\bigg)=(\\underbrace{\\tilde{W}_{0}^{k}-J_{k}C}_{>0})d p+r d V.\n$$  \n\nThe quantity $\\tilde{W}_{0}^{k}-I_{k}C$ is positive in a viable economy, which simply requires $\\varepsilon_{0}$ to be large enough compared to $C$ $\\tilde{W}_{0}^{k^{\\ast}}-{\\cal I}_{k}C$ is of course positive when $k=g$ since ${{J}_{k}}\\mathrm{~=~}0$ Further, by difference of equation (D4) for $k=s$ $g$ , one can verify after a few calculations that  \n\n$$\n\\partial(\\Delta\\tilde{R})/\\partial V<0,\n$$  \n\ngiven that $\\tilde{R}^{g}>\\tilde{R}^{s}$ . The second line is only a sufficient condition, and the inequality holds when workers prefer general skills as long as $\\breve{W}_{0}^{g}-\\tilde{W}_{0}^{s}<C$  \n\nThe second part of Lemma A1 comes from the value of $\\Delta\\tilde{R}$  \n\n$$\n\\Delta\\tilde{R}=\\frac{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\lambda}{r+\\lambda+\\delta}\\int_{\\tilde{R}^{s}}^{\\tilde{R}^{g}}\\left(1-F(z)\\right)d z-\\Delta h}{1+\\displaystyle\\frac{p\\beta}{r+\\lambda+\\delta}}.\n$$  \n\nAs $p$ goes to infinity, one can verify that $\\Delta\\tilde{R}$ goes to zero.  \n\nStep 3. Coming back to the sign of $\\tilde{W}_{0}^{g}-\\tilde{W}_{0}^{s}$ we now expressit as a function of $p$ and $V.$ Denoting by $\\Lambda(V,p)=(r+\\delta)(\\tilde{W}_{0}^{g}-\\tilde{W}_{0}^{\\bar{s}})$ ,we have  \n\n$$\n\\Lambda(V,p)=p C-\\beta\\Delta\\tilde{R}(V,p)\\frac{r+\\delta+p}{r+\\delta+\\lambda}.\n$$  \n\nAssume that $f$ has no mass point, so that $\\tilde{R}^{s}$ and $\\tilde{R}^{g}$ are continuous and differentiable with respect to $p$ .Thus $\\Lambda$ is also continuous and differentiable. We can see that  \n\n$$\n\\Lambda(V,0)=\\frac{-(r+\\updelta)\\lambda}{(r+\\updelta+\\uplambda)^{2}}\\left(\\int_{\\tilde{R}(V,0)}^{\\tilde{R}^{\\it g}(V,0)}\\left(1-F(z)\\right)d z-\\Delta h\\right).\n$$  \n\nRemembering that $\\Delta h<0$ and $\\tilde{R}^{s}<\\tilde{R}^{g}$ , we have that $\\Lambda(V,0)<0$ : workers choose specific skill at $p=0$ . Further, replacing the function $\\Delta\\tilde{R}$ from equation (D6) into $\\Lambda(V,p)$ , we have  \n\n$$\n\\Lambda(V,p)=p C-\\beta\\frac{r+\\updelta+p}{r+\\uplambda+\\updelta+\\upbeta p}\\frac{\\uplambda}{r+\\uplambda+\\updelta}\\left(\\int_{\\tilde{R}^{s}}^{\\tilde{R}^{s}}(1-F(z))d z-\\Delta h\\right).\n$$  \n\nThen we see that  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{lim}_{p\\rightarrow+\\infty}\\Lambda(V,p)=+\\infty,\n$$  \n\nsince $\\tilde{R}^{s}$ and $\\tilde{R}^{g}$ converge to each other. It follows that workers choose general skills for large values of $p$ . By continuity of $\\Lambda$ with respect to $p$ , there exists thus at least one $p^{M}(V)$ such that they are indifferent between specific and general skills, i.e., $\\Lambda(V,p^{M})=0$ . The next challenge is to make sure that there is a unique $p^{M}(V)$ . Following the logic of the proof in the static case described above, it would thus be sufficient to prove that $\\partial\\Lambda/\\partial p>0$  \n\nStep 4. Let us calculate this slope $\\partial\\Lambda/\\partial p$ taking the derivative of equation (D7) with respect to $p$ wehave  \n\n$$\n\\partial\\Lambda/\\partial p=C-\\beta\\frac{\\Delta\\tilde{R}}{r+\\lambda+\\delta}-\\beta\\frac{d\\Delta\\tilde{R}}{d p}\\frac{r+\\delta+p}{r+\\delta+\\lambda},\n$$  \n\nwhich has a priori no particular sign. Nevertheless, as in the static case, we can see that a large enough $C$ may imply the monotonicity of $\\Lambda$ and thus the uniqueness of $p^{M}$ for each $V.$ Let us, however, make no assumption on $C$  \n\nOne strategy to show uniqueness is instead to compute the slope of $\\Lambda$ in points $p^{M}$ where $\\Lambda=0$ Indeed, if the slope is locally positive in such points, this means that there could be a decreasing part on $\\Lambda$ (although unreported simulations never found any) but, in any case, only for values of $\\Lambda$ distant from zero. In other words, the first intersection between $\\Lambda$ and the origin (which necessarily exists, as shown in step 3) would also be necessarily unique. So, exploiting that in points $p^{M}$ , we have  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\beta\\Delta\\tilde{R}}{r+\\delta+\\lambda}=\\frac{p^{M}}{r+\\delta+p^{M}}C,\n$$  \n\nand the slope of $\\Lambda$ is locally equal to  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{\\displaystyle{\\frac{\\partial\\Lambda}{\\partial p}}\\left(p^{M}\\right)=C\\displaystyle{\\frac{r+\\delta}{r+\\delta+p^{M}}}-\\beta\\displaystyle{\\frac{d\\Delta\\tilde{R}}{d p}}\\left(p^{M}\\right)\\displaystyle{\\frac{r+\\delta+p^{M}}{r+\\delta+\\lambda}},}}\\ {{=C\\displaystyle{\\left(\\displaystyle{\\frac{r+\\delta}{r+\\delta+p^{M}}}-\\displaystyle{\\frac{d{\\mathrm{ln}}\\Delta\\tilde{R}}{d{\\mathrm{ln}}p}}(p^{M})\\right)}.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nA sufficient condition for the uniqueness of $p^{M}$ is thus that locally in $p^{M}$ the quantity $\\Delta\\tilde{R}$ does not vary with respect to $p$ (which would be the case with exogenous destruction rates) or, as shown in the second line, the elasticity of $\\Delta\\tilde{R}$ with respect to $p$ is smaller than 1. We can actually have some intuition that, for sufficiently large values of $\\stackrel{\\cdot}{p^{M}}$ $d\\Delta\\tilde{R}/d p$ is actually negative, since when $p$ goes to infinity, $\\tilde{R}^{s}$ converges toward $\\tilde{R}^{g}$ from below. The same intuition carries through by inspection of equation (D6): the denominator is clearly driving a negative sign of $d\\Delta\\tilde{R}/d p$ . For the numerator to generate an opposite slope of $\\Delta\\tilde{R}(p)$ , it has to vary quickly. So, $p^{M}$ is unique under the sufficient condition that, when workers are indifferent between general and specific skills, job destructions rates are either: (a) inelastic to $p$ ; or (b) the cut-off point $\\tilde{R}$ is not too elastic in $g$ -jobs compared to $s$ -jobs.  \n\nStep 5. Given that $\\Delta\\tilde{R}$ decreases with $V$ from inequality (D5), it must be that $\\Lambda(V,p)$ increases with $V$ and thus that $p^{M}(V)$ decreases with $V.$  \n\nStep 6. The shape of the frontiers between regimes $S$ and o ( $G$ and 0) is part (b) of Theorem 1. Wehave:  \n\nLEMMA A2 (regime O): Workers choose O rather than specific skills when $\\tilde{R}^{s}(V,p)>\\varepsilon^{0}-(r+$ $\\delta+\\lambda)/\\beta(C^{s}+T)$ .Workers choose O rather than general skills when $\\tilde{R^{g}}(V,p)>\\acute{\\varepsilon}^{0}-(r+\\delta+$ $\\lambda)((C^{g}-\\Delta\\tilde{U})/\\beta+T)$  \n\nPROOF:  \n\nNewborn workers do not invest in skill $k$ if $\\tilde{W}^{k}-\\tilde{U}^{k^{\\prime}}-C+\\tilde{U}^{k}<U^{0},$ i.e., given Lemma A1, and $\\beta\\{[\\varepsilon_{0}-\\tilde{R}^{k}(p,V)]/(r+\\lambda+\\delta)\\}-T>C+\\tilde{U}^{0}-\\tilde{U}^{k^{\\prime}}$  \n\n## REFERENCES  \n\nAcemoglu, Daron and Pischke, Jorn-Steffen. \\*Beyond Becker: Training in Imperfect Labour Markets.\"’ Economic Journal, 1999a, 109(453), Pp.
