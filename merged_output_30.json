As primary channels financing SMEs, what roles have private equity and venture capital (PE/VC) played in this crisis? Using the 2010-2021 data of 4462 listed companies, we aimed to assess the impact of PE/VC on financial risk among Chinese SMEs. We constructedacapitalstructureselectionmodeltoassesstheriskpreferenceofPE/VC and explored the roles of PE/VC in the financial risk management of enterprises during COVID-19. Based on both theory and empirical evidence, PE/VC negatively impacts the financial risk of enterprises, implying that intervention by the management of PE/VC can aggravate the financial risk. However, in reality, PE/VC positively impacted enterprise financial risk during COvID-19. Thus, the government should implement some easing policies to stimulate access and investment policies of PE/VC as well as provide more practical policies to support investment institutions in China and other counties.  \n\n$\\copyright$ 2022 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland.

Several small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have been severely affected by the pandemic and the resultant lockdowns. Especially in developing countries, SMEs have faced multiple issues: financial problems, supply chain disruption, logistic blocks, labor shortages, decreases in demand, reduction in sales and profit, etc. (Dai et al., 2021; Zhang and Sogn-Grundvag, 2022). Shafi et al. (2020) report that $>83\\%$ of the affected enterprises in Pakistan were neither prepared nor had any plan of action to handle such a crisis. Moreover, some scholars, including Yagi and Managi (2021), think that the economic damage from the 2020 COVID-19 crisis is greater than that from the 2008 global financial crisis. Analysis of the impact of CoVID-19 on the economy and ways to overcome these impacts has become a hot research topic.  \n\nSome scholars suggest that appropriate intervention by the government, such as direct fiscal recovery policy measures in terms of the economy (Can et al.,2021), strict lockdown for firm performance (Ren et al., 2021), the establishment of regulatory and legal systems in stable countries (Ho et al., 2022), closing schools, imposing restrictions on internal movement, organizing public awareness campaigns, income support, international aid in exchange rate volatility (Feng et al., 2021), and increasing credit guarantee ratio in financial risk (Taghizadeh-Hesary et al., 2022), could help mitigate the negative impacts of CovID-19. However, some scholars also believe that not every government intervention would positively affect economic development. For instance, Gao (2022) believes that both lockdown policies and FinTech can negatively impact new firm creation in the manufacturing sector. Moreover, Lopatka and Fedorowicz (2021) believe that the Polish state aid offered to enterprises during the COvID-19 pandemic, although effective, left a few questions unanswered: if enterprises without normal businesses failed on the free market, could they be artificially sustained even after the end of the pandemic? Besides, Hu et al. (2021) report that stringent government responses can negatively impact the stock prices of most energy enterprises.  \n\nConsidering the uncertainty in the effects of government intervention, some scholars have sought survival paths for enterprise development. Many scholars, including Fitriasari (2020), Papadopoulos et al. (2020), Roffia and Mola (2022), Bai et al. (2021), Muhamad et al. (2021), Halina and Wiercioch (2021), and Obrenovic et al. (2020), agree that the use of digital technology and the complexity of information infrastructures are effective ways via which enterprises can cope with CoVID-19. Enterprises with strong managers can develop digital strategies; in contrast, this may be difficult for enterprises to have not-so-strong managers (Kong et al., 2021). Meanwhile, providing enterprises with stable finances is undoubtedly an efficient and critical approach (Naoyuki and Farhad, 2019). If enterprises can attract enough funding for their activities, they can play a pivotal role in mitigating the negative effects of COVID-19 (Farhoud et al., 2021).  \n\nIn developed countries, private equity and venture capital (PE/VC) are effective in obtaining financing for SMEs. The rapid growth of the PE/VC market in China has led to PE/VC becoming increasingly important in the financial risk control of SMEs as well as enterprise governance. According to the PE/VC data statistics of Wind Information Technology Co., LTD (WIND), PE/VC-related investments in China increased from 322.96 billion yuan to 8463.92 billion yuan from 2004 to 2020, with a growth rate of $25.21\\%$ . Even now, the PE/VC market is continually developing into a popular investment field in China's capital market. Apart from providing financial support to SMEs, PE/VC aids enterprise governance and influences the operation and management of SMEs for their own interests (Reid et al., 1997; Kortum and Lerner, 2000). PE/VC also plays a critical role in enterprises' financial strategic decisions and risk control. Hence, the following questions arise: what role has PE/VC played in the financial risk management of SMEs before and after COVID-19 and will PE/VC continue to benefit SMEs as long as the COVID-19 pandemic continues?  \n\nTo explore these issues, the present study assessed PE/VC and focused on analyzing the influence of PE/VC intervention on the financial risk of holding enterprises before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study aimed to make two main contributions to the existing literature.  \n\nFirst, we constructed a capital structure selection model based on the risk preference of major shareholders to theoretically confirm that as a major shareholder, PE/VC significantly affects the financial risk of the holding enterprise. An empirical test was performed, which confirmed the above theoretical results. Our study provides reliable theoretical and empirical bases for the management of enterprise financial risk in China, thereby adding to the available literature on enterprise finance.  \n\nSecond, considering the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we further analyzed the impact of PE/VC on enterprise financial risk by applying CovID-19 as a factor in the above-mentioned capital structure selection model. When a big change or crisis occurs, PE/VC changes its operations and management modes by focusing on risk aversion. PE/VC has continued to play positive roles in the management of enterprise financial risk during the CoVID-19 pandemic. Our study provided a new research perspective for understanding the roles of PE/VC in enterprise financial risk.  \n\nThe rest of this study has been organized as follows. Section 2 presents a review of the existing literature. Section 3 provides the theoretical background and proposes a hypothesis. Section 4 presents the data and model specifications. Sections 5 and 6 present the empirical results. Finally, the paper is concluded in the last section.  \n\n## 2. Literature review  \n\nThe primary aim of this study was to explore the role of PE/VC in the management of enterprise financial risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, the existing literature can be represented as two different strands: the first strand contained studies related to the varying impacts of CovID-19 on firms, whereas the second strand mainly concentrated on the various impacts of PE/vC on enterprises.  \n\nIn terms of the first strand, many studies have assessed the impacts of coVID-19 on firms. Clearly, these impacts are predominantly negative. Zhang and Sogn-Grundvag (2022) reported that the COvID-19 pandemic resulted in decreases in firm revenue and raised the demand for liquidity, thereby resulting in increased financial stress among firms worldwide, particularly small firms and firms with limited access to finance. Dai et al. (2021) believed that the COVID-19 outbreak and the resultant lockdowns took a heavy toll on SMEs, which were principally afflicted by blocks in logistics, labor shortages, and drops in demand. A large number of scholars, including Gao (2022), Shafi et al. (2020), Hu et al. (2021), Giddy and Rogerson (2021), Afriza (2021), Oyewale et al. (2020), Fabeil et al. (2020), Farhoud et al. (2021), and Ren et al. (2021), supported this view and believed that the COVID-19 outbreak and the lockdown policies may have inhibited the survival of SMEs. However, a few scholars think this pandemic is an opportunity for enterprises to transform and develop innovations, although the COVID-19 pandemic has undeniably been a severe disaster. Markovic et al. (2021) reported that some SMEs made relevant innovations in terms of business-to-business corporate partners during the COVID-19 pandemic. Halina and Wiercioch (2021) stated that the rate of the use of financial-accounting programs in remote work has improved during the COVID-19 pandemic. Roffia and Mola (2022) suggested that the COVID-19 pandemic enhanced SMEs' intentions to adopt enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems by mitigating barriers that hinder the adoption of ERP systems.  \n\nTable 1 Summary of previous studies.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Authors</td><td>Research objective</td><td>Major attitudes</td></tr><tr><td>Zhang and Sogn-Grundvag (2022) Dai et al.

These discussions have been mainly focused on the elaboration of two aspects. First, scholars maintain their opinion that PE/VC positively impacts enterprise governance and management. Reid et al. (1997) and Samila and Sorenson (2011) insisted that PE/VC often actively influences the decisions of enterprise governance and thus improves the structure of enterprise governance and obtains high returns to avoid downside risks to the enterprise's performance. Wright and Robbie (1996) showed that VC is more advantageous in an enterprise's development; they also reported that compared with enterprises without PE/VC support, those with PE/VC support perform better in terms of innovation ability, profitability, improvement of internal governance structure, stock price performance, and innovation capacity (Statman, 1999; Kortum and Lerner, 2000; Liang and Jiang, 2012; Zhang and Yeqing, 2016). In contrast, some scholars believed that PE/VC has barely any positive effects on the governance and operation management of enterprises and that it may even inhibit the development of enterprises. Hirukawa and Ueda (2011) believed that PE/VC cannot improve the innovation ability of enterprises but can invest in enterprises with a potentially high innovation capability. Zhang et al. (2015) reported that VC tends to participate in politically connected enterprises; however, the positive effects of VC on the performance of such enterprises are weakened after listing. In addition, Zhao et al. (2015) suggested that PE/VC exhibits chaotic phenomena such as surprise shareholding, PE corruption, right share trading, and performance change in China.  \n\nTable 1 presents details of the above-mentioned studies regarding the impacts of PE/VC and COVID-19 on enterprises.  \n\n## 3. Theoretical hypothesis  \n\nWhen considering a representative enterprise, the assets can be divided into the rights of creditors and investors, expressed with the same equation \"Assets $=$ Liabilities $^+$ Owners\". Assuming that an enterprise's assets are A, liabilities are $L$ . and owners' equity is $E$ the following accounting identity exists: $A=L+E$  \n\nAssuming that the rate of interest of the debt is fixed and marked as $r_{d}$ , the amount of principal $^+$ interest that the enterprise needs to repay at the end of the period is $L\\left(1+r_{d}\\right)$ . where the return on enterprises' assets is the random variable $r$ that is uniformly distributed as $[-1,a]$ and $a>0$ . Therefore, when the assets are lower than the amounts of the principal and interest of liabilities at the end of the period, the enterprise will be insolvent, denoted as Financialfailure $^{\\prime=1}$ otherwise,Financialfailure $=0$ . Then, the probability of financial failure or bankruptcy of the enterprise could be expressed as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{P(F i n a n c i a l f a i l u r e=1)=P(A(1+r)<L(1+r_{d}))}\\ &{\\qquad=P(r<\\frac{L(1+r_{d})}{A}-1)\\overset{r\\sim U[-1,a]}{=}\\frac{L(1+r_{d})}{A(1+a)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$p$ is the ratio of the probability of financial failure or bankruptcy to the probability without financial failure or bankruptcy, known as the probability of financial failure or bankruptcy of the enterprise:  \n\n$$\np={\\frac{P(F i n a n c i a l f a i l u r e=1)}{P(F i n a n c i a l f a i l u r e=0)}}\n$$  \n\nTo simplify the analysis, the principal-agent cost was not considered in this study; however, the goals of the major shareholders and managers were kept consistent. Based on the static tradeoff theory, debt financing has a tax shield effect-financial failure or bankruptcy does not occur, and debt financing can reduce taxes and fees and indirectly increase the enterprise's after-tax earnings. However, in the event of financial failure or bankruptcy, debt financing will increase the risk of an enterprise's financial failure or bankruptcy and thus add to the costs. Therefore, when debt financing is performed, the net income is as follows:  \n\n$$\n{N e t P r o f i t(L)}={\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{L\\cdot r_{d}\\cdot t}&{F i n a n c i a l f a i l u r e=0}\\ {-c_{0}}&{F i n a n c i a l f a i l u r e=1}\\end{array}\\right.}\n$$  \n\nWhere $t$ is the income tax rate, $C_{0}$ is assumed as fixed, and $r_{d}$ and $t$ are exogenous variables of the model.  \n\nFinancial risks increase shareholder wealth risks and result in an irreversible situation. Therefore, the present study defined the opening root of the probability of financial failure or bankruptcy of enterprise $p$ as the financial risk factor and divides the wealth utility of major shareholders into the opening root of the income factor of wealth $E(W)$ and the strengthening risk factor $p V a r(W)$  \n\n$$\nE\\left\\{U(W)\\right\\}=E(W)-\\alpha\\gamma\\sqrt{p V a r(W)}\n$$  \n\nWhere $\\alpha$ is the proportion factor set at 0.5 for simplification and $\\gamma$ is the degree of the risk aversion of major shareholders $(\\gamma\\geq0).$ 0. The greater the risk preference of major shareholders, the lower the risk aversion degree, indicating that when the major shareholder is a risk seeker, $1>\\gamma\\geq0$ . and when the major shareholder is a risk averter, $\\gamma\\geq1$  \n\nAssuming that only major shareholders receive enterprise dividends and that the dividends remain unchanged, when the enterprise conducts debt financing, the wealth function of the major shareholders will be as follows:  \n\n$$\nW=(N e t P r o f i t-R I)r_{f}+R I r\n$$  \n\nWhere $R I$ refers to the retained earnings of the enterprise, NetProfit refers to the net income obtained from debt financing of the enterprise, and (Netprofit-Rl) refers to the dividends paid by the enterprise to the major shareholders. Assuming that the major shareholders primarily use the dividends to make risk-free investments and that the investment income is $r_{f}$ , the return rate $r$ obtained from the retained earnings investment will be the same as the return on assets, and both will follow a uniform distribution on $[-1,a]$ . satisfying the criterion of $a>0$  \n\nTherefore, the major shareholders should choose an optimal solution to maximize their expected utility function of wealth, which can be expressed as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{max}_{L}\\left\\{L r_{d}t r_{f}-r_{f}(L r_{d}t+c_{0})\\frac{L(1+r_{d})}{A(1+a)}-R I r_{f}+R I\\cdot\\frac{a-1}{2}-\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\frac{(L r_{d}t+c_{0})L(1+r_{d})}{A(1+a)}\\right\\}\n$$  \n\nSo, the optional $L^{*}$ is as follows:  \n\n$$\nL^{*}=\\frac{A(a+1)}{2(1+r_{d})(1+\\frac{\\gamma}{2r_{f}})}-\\frac{c_{0}}{2r_{d}t}\n$$  \n\nTherefore, the smaller $\\gamma$ is, the larger $L^{*}$ is, indicating that the lesser the risk aversion of major shareholders, the higher the enterprise's financial risk. As a special investor, PE/VC not only provides financial support to the enterprise but also participates in an enterprise's operational management and financial strategic decisions after investing in the enterprise (Reid et al., 1997; Kortum and Lerner, 2000). Thus, PE/VC usually plays an important role in the personnel management of an enterprise (Cochrane, 2005). Besides, Ennis and Sebastian (2005) and Conroy and Harris (2007) report that PE/VC always has a high tolerance to risk. Thus, PE/VC usually enjoys the regulatory power of the enterprise as a major shareholder after investing in the enterprise; moreover, to maximize their returns, PE/VC often has a higher risk tolerance than the other investors. Thus, to pursue higher returns, PE/VC usually prefers risk over other investment institutions; that is, the risk aversion of PE/VC is smaller. To sum up, Hypothesis 1 can be proposed as follows.  \n\nHypothesis 1. PE/VC plays a deteriorating role in the financial risk of enterprises.  \n\nIn the above-mentioned selection model, the risk aversion of $\\mathsf{P E}/\\mathsf{V C}$ is assumed to be constant; however, in reality, the risk aversion changes according to the economic environment. Thus, when a big change or crisis occurs, PE/VC will consciously strengthen the companies' risk controls and tend to invest in a manner that helps avoid high risk.  \n\nTherefore, as a major shareholder, PE/VC will have different risk preferences in different economic environments (e.g., COVID-19). Thus, we adjusted Eq. (3) and introduced the economic environment factor c. Accordingly, the expected utility function of the wealth of the major shareholders could be expressed as follows:  \n\n$$\nE\\left\\{U(W)\\right\\}=E(W)-\\alpha(1+\\gamma(c))\\sqrt{p V a r(W)}\n$$  \n\nThe economic environment factor $c$ is a dummy factor; it is 1 when a big change or crisis occurs in the economic environment; otherwise, it is 0. It satisfies $\\gamma(0)=\\gamma_{0}<1$ ,where $\\gamma_{0}$ is a positive constant and $\\gamma(1)=\\gamma_{1}\\geq1$  \n\nSimilar to the above derivation, the optimization problem faced by the major shareholders is as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{max}_{L}\\left\\{L r_{d}t r_{f}-r_{f}(L r_{d}t+c_{0})\\frac{L(1+r_{d})}{A(1+a)}-R I r_{f}+R I\\cdot\\frac{a-1}{2}-\\frac{1+\\gamma(c)}{2}\\frac{(L r_{d}t+c_{0})L(1+r_{d})}{A(1+a)}\\right\\}\n$$  \n\nThe optional $L^{**}(c)$ is as follows:  \n\n$$\nL^{**}(c)=\\frac{A(a+1)}{2(1+r_{d})(1+\\frac{1+\\gamma(c)}{2r_{f}})}-\\frac{c_{0}}{2r_{d}t}\n$$  \n\nTherefore, the smaller the $\\gamma(c)$ is, the larger the $L^{**}(c)$ is, indicating that the lower the risk aversion of the major shareholders is, the higher the enterprise financial risk is. When a big change or crisis occurs, the PE/VC will change its operation and management modes by increasing risk aversion. Thus, $L^{**}(1)<L^{**}(0)$ . Hypothesis 2 can accordingly be proposed.  \n\nHypothesis 2. PE/VC plays a positive role in the financial risk of enterprises during the COVID-19 pandemic  \n\n## 4. Statistical description and model selection  \n\n### 4.1. Sample selection and data sources  \n\nOur main aim was to study the differences in the impact of PE/VC on financial risk before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. We used the data of 4462 listed companies from 2010 to 2021 as research samples. The basic information and financial data of all these listed companies were mainly obtained from the China Stock Market & Accounting Research Database (CSMAR Database). Moreover, the data on Chinese PE/VC companies were mainly obtained from the WIND database.  \n\n### 4.2. Variable selection and definition  \n\nWe aimed to study the roles of PE/VC in the financial risk of SMEs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, we selected explained variables, core explanatory variables, the CoVID-19 variable, and control variables.  \n\n#### 4.2.1. Explained variables  \n\nAltman (1968) and Altman et al. (2017) indicate that the Z value can be used to analyze and predict the possibility of financial failure or bankruptcy in listed companies by integrating their financial data scores. The lower the Z value is, the more likely the listed companies are to go bankrupt; i.e., the financial risk is greater here. Therefore, we considered the probability of financial failure or bankruptcy (Zscore) of the listed companies in the accounting year as a proxy variable of the explained variable. If the Z value is $<1.81$ , the enterprise is under a latent bankruptcy crisis. According to the z value critical point of the bankruptcy crisis of the enterprise, the dummy variable Zscoredummy is defined as an auxiliary proxy variable of the explained variable; this value is 1 when the z value of the accounting year of the listed enterprise is $<1.81$ otherwise, thevalue is 0.  \n\nTable2 Definition and description of the variables used.

Core explanatory variables  \n\nTo analyze the effects of PE/VC on the financial risk of the listed companies in China, the dummy variable of the existence of PE/VC in the listed companies was considered the core explanatory variable. The definition of VC background established by Wu and Yuan (2017) was used as a reference: PEVCdummy $=1$ if the top 10 shareholder names of the listed enterprises contained keywords related to PE/VC; otherwise, PEVCdummy $=0$ To analyze the robustness of the results, PEVCnum and PEVCradio were used as auxiliary proxy variables.  \n\n#### 4.2.3. The COVID-19 variable  \n\nTo analyze the effects of COVID-19 on SMEs, the existence of the COVID-19 pandemic was considered the dummy variable, denoted as COVID_19.  \n\n#### 4.2.4. Control variables  \n\nPE/VC may influence the financial risk of the listed companies in China on three levels: enterprise finance, enterprise capital structure, and enterprise equity. The financial level of the enterprise variables mainly refers to the return on total assets (ROA), the total market value of equity (EV), and total assets (Assets). The capital structure of the enterprise variables mainly refers to the asset-liability ratio (Debttoasset). Enterprise equity mainly refers to the total shares (Totalshares), free-float shares (Freefloatshares), and top 10 shareholders' shareholding ratios (Top10).  \n\nBased on the above analysis of the variables, the definition and description of the variables used in this study art presented in Table 2.  \n\n### 4.3. Statistical description of the data  \n\nAfter deleting outliers and missing values from the original research sample, we conducted a preliminary statistical analysis of the data and obtained the below-mentioned descriptive statistics table (Table 3).  \n\nAccording to Table 3, the mean and median values of the variable Zscore were 5.3297 and 3.0859, respectively. Both thesevalueswere $>2.675$ , indicating that the financial status of the listed Chinese companies was generally good and that the possibility of financial failure or bankruptcy was low.

The t-test and Wilcoxon's signed-rank test were conducted for the corresponding indexes of the two data groups, the test results of which are shown in Table 4.  \n\nWe found that the mean and median (average, 5.1914; median, 3.0774) of the Zscore variable in the treatment groupPEvCdummy $=1$ was less than that (average, 5.4110; median, 3.0898) of the Zscore variable in the control group PEVCdummy $=0$ . Thus, compared with the Z value of the listed companies without the support of PE/VC in China, the Z value of the listed companies with the support of PE/VC was perhaps lower.  \n\n### 4.4. Model selection  \n\nThis study assessed the role of $\\mathsf{P E}/\\mathsf{V C}$ in managing the financial risk of SMEs before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering that in China PE/VC tends to aid companies with higher financial risks in the investment process, the greater financial risks may not have been caused by PE/VC entering the enterprise. Thus, the samples selected in this study may have been subjected to a “selectivity bias\"; that is, the multiple linear regression model may have been endogenous. To reduce the endogeneity of the model as much as possible, we adopted the instrumental variable method, which represented tool variables with differing multitudes.  \n\n1) Instrumental variable two-stage linear regression (2SLS model):  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{P E V C d u m m y_{i t}=\\gamma_{0}+\\omega I n s t r u c t o r s_{i t}+\\eta C o n t r o l s_{i t}+u_{i t}}\\ &{Z s c o r e_{i t}=\\alpha_{0}+\\alpha_{1}P E V C d u m m y_{i t}+\\lambda C o n t r o l s_{i t}+v_{i t}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n(2) Instrumental variable probit regression (IVProbit model):  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{P E V C d u m m y_{i t}=\\gamma_{0}+\\omega I n s t r u c t o r s_{i t}+\\eta C o n t r o l s_{i t}+u_{i t}}\\ {Z s c o r e d u m m y_{i t}^{*}=\\alpha_{0}+\\alpha_{1}P E V C d u m m y_{i t}+\\lambda C o n t r o l s_{i t}+v_{i t}}\\ {Z s c o r e d u m m y_{i t}=I_{(0.+\\infty)}(Z s c o r e d u m m y_{i t}^{*})}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nInstructor $\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{\\mathit{S}}}_{i t}$ are observable instrumental variables, whereas PEVCdummy\\* and Zscoredummy $\\mathbf{\\chi}_{i t}^{*}$ are unobservable variables, indicating the probabilities of PE/VC shareholding and financial failure or bankruptcy. $I_{A}(\\cdot)$ is the indicative function of set A. The perturbation term $\\left(u_{i},v_{i}\\right)$ is assumed to obey two-dimensional normal distribution with an expected value of 0：  \n\n$$\n{\\binom{u_{i}}{v_{i}}}\\sim N\\left[{\\binom{0}{0}},{\\binom{\\sigma_{u}^{2}}{\\rho\\sigma_{u}}}\\quad{\\rho\\sigma_{u}}\\right)\\right]\n$$  \n\nWhere, the variance of $\\nu_{i}$ is normalized to 1 and $\\rho$ is the correlation coefficient of $\\left(u_{i},v_{i}\\right)$ If the correlation coefficients of thetwo $\\rho=0$ are valid, PEVCdummy is an exogenous variable; otherwise, endogeneity exists.  \n\nIn China, Beijing and Shanghai are important political and economic centers, and investment by PE/VC in these regions is usually quite different from that in other regions. In addition, the investment frequency and amount of PE/VC companies in each Chinese province are strongly associated with the PE/VC's investment decisions, and these decisions directly affect the possibility of local companies being invested by PE/vC. Therefore, this paper selected the dummy variables (Area) of the province in which the enterprise headquarter was located (Shanghai or Beijing) as the instrumental variable. The study also selected the investment frequency of the PE/VC companies (PEVCinvestf) in the province as another instrumental Variable.  \n\nTable5 The impact of PE/VC shareholding on enterprise financial risk in China.

The influence of PE/VC on financial risk  \n\nThis section mainly presents the findings of the analysis of the influence of PE/VC on the financial risk of its holding enterprise. Instrumental variable 2SLS two-stage regression and IVProbit regression were performed using (1) the variable enterprise Z value (Zscore); (2) the core explanatory variable if the enterprise contains PE/VC (PEVCdummy); (3) the ROA, EV, and Assets, capital structure (Debttoasset), and enterprise equity (Totalshares and Freefloatshares). The regression results are shown in Table 5.  \n\nAccording to Table 5, the following conclusions can be drawn.  \n\na. The coefficient and t value of the PEVCdummy variable of models 1-3 indicate that, at the level of $1\\%$ theZvalue (Zscore) of the explained variable enterprise is significantly negatively correlated with the existence of PE/VC. This indicates that the intervention of PE/VC will reduce the Z value of its holding enterprise before or after the COVID-19 pandemic; thus, the intervention of PE/VC will increase the possibility of financial failure or bankruptcy of its holding enterprise before or after CoVID-19. In contrast, the Zscore of the enterprise declined by approximately $5.0721\\%$ withPE/VC holding before CovID-19; however, this ratio will increase to $7.4576\\%$ once the CovID-19 pandemic ends.  \n\nb. The results of the first-stage regression of models 1-3 indicate that the regression coefficients of Area or the PEVCinvestf variable are significantly correlated with the core explanatory PEVCdummy variables at the $1\\%$ level. In the meanwhile, the Hausman test for endogeneity and the overidentifying restrictions test were performed. The results of these tests indicated that the selection of instrumental variables was rational.  \n\n### 5.2. Robustness test  \n\nTo verify the stability of the above results, auxiliary proxy variables were used to assess the regressions shown in Table 6. We noted three main points. First, there was a significant negative relation between the PEVCnum variable and Zscore variable and between the PEVCradio variable and Zscore variable at the $1\\%$ level. Second, there was a significant positive relationship between the PEVCdummy variable and $P(Z s c o r e d u m m y=1|X)_{\\scriptscriptstyle*}$ thePEVCnum variable and $P(Z s c o r e d u m m y{=}1|X)$ variable, and the PEVCradio variable and $P(Z s c o r e d u m m y{=}1|X)$ variable at the $5\\%$ level. Third, the instrumental variables were all significantly related to the endogeneity of the PEVCdummy, PEVCnum, or PEVCradio variables, and the selection of the instrumental variables was rational. Thus, we concluded that intervention by PE/VC would decrease the Zscore of its holding enterprises, thereby increasing the possibility of financial failure or bankruptcy. The decreasewas approximately $2.8276\\%$ for each PE/VC seat in the top 10 shareholders and approximately $0.8333\\%$ for each addition in terms of the number of PE/VC shares held.  \n\nTable6 Robustness test to assess the impact of PE/VC shareholding on the financial risk of enterprises in China.

Further empirical results and analysis  \n\nIn Section 5, the influence of PE/VC on the financial risk of its holding enterprises has been discussed. We mainly assessed the role of PE/VC in the management of the financial risk of SMEs before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. A new variable of covID_19 was introduced, and an adaptive model should be immediately adopted.  \n\n### 6.1. Model selection  \n\nIn this section, we chose a difference-in-difference (DID) model for preliminary analysis and the propensity score matching-DID (PSM-DID) model for the robustness test:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{Z s c o r e_{i t}=\\alpha+\\lambda D I D_{i t}+\\gamma P E V C d u m m y_{i}+\\beta C O V I D_{-}19_{t}+\\eta C o n t r o l s_{i t}+u_{i}+\\varepsilon_{i t}}\\ &{D I D_{i t}=P E V C d u m m y_{i}*C O V I D_{-}19_{t},i=1,\\ldots,n,t=1,2}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nWhere PEVCdummy; is the treatment dummy variable with or without the support of $\\mathrm{PE}/\\mathrm{VC},~C O V I D_{-}19_{t}$ is the COVID19 dummy variable before or after the COVID-19 pandemic, Conti $\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{~\\boldmath~\\omega~}}}_{0}l s_{i t}$ are the control variables, $u_{i}$ is an unobservable individual characteristic, and $\\varepsilon_{i t}$ is a residual term.  \n\n### 6.2. Further sample processing  \n\nTo obtain a good sample-matching result, we deleted the samples of companies listed after 2010 and those having null values based on previous study samples; this reduced the sample size to 2025.  \n\n6.3. Influence of COVID-19 on the impact of $P E/V C$ on companies' financial risks  \n\nAccording to Eq. (11), we obtained DID regress at the first step (Table 7). There was a significant positive relationship between the DID variable and the Zscore variable at the $10\\%$ level after 2011, indicating that the influence of PE/VC's holding on enterprises financial risk could change from positive to negative after the COVID-19 pandemic. PE/VC protects enterprises from financial risks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, the Zscore of enterprises with PE/VC holding wouldbeapproximately $1\\%$ higher than that of enterprises without PE/VC holding after the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n\nTable7 Results of the DID regression.

The mean Zscores of the enterprises before and after matching by year. Source: Drawn by the authors using STATA.  \n\nWe obtained PSM-DID regress with 1:3 (treatment group samples: control group samples) matching samples for further robustness tests. The matching characters were as follows: total assets (ROA), total market value of equity (EV), total assets (Assets), total shares (Totalshares), free-float shares (Freefloatshares), and top 10 shareholders' shareholding ratio (Top10) The mean Zscores of the enterprises before and after matching by year are presented in Fig. 1.  \n\nFig. 1 indicates that around 2019, the mean Zscores of the enterprises with PE/VC holding were higher than those withoutPE/VCholding.  \n\nThe density of the matching pscores before and after matching the results are described by year in Fig. 2. The effect of matching was fine, and the densities of matching pscores with or without PE/VC support were almost identical, indicating that the difference in the matching characters between enterprises with or without PE/VC support was weakened.  \n\nTable 8 presents the results of the DID regress depending on the matching samples. The DID variable remained significantly positively related to the Zscore variable at the $10\\%$ level after matching in the year 2011. Moreover, the COVID_19 variable significantly negatively influenced the Zscore variable. Our results showed that the COVID-19 pandemic would exacerbate financial risks for companies; however, using PE/VC can adjust the company's financial structure, reduce its financial risks, and buffer the impact of COVID-19. Moreover, as an umbrella effect, PE/VC will protect companies during the CoVID-19 pandemic.  \n\n![](images/a580c897826291a519384b32ad99c0e4f9aa4f4e5ebf199675ea4ff9407c7875.jpg)  \nFig. 2.

Conclusions and policy recommendations  \n\nThis study primarily assessed the role of PE/VC in the financial risk of SMEs. First, based on a theoretical analysis of the debt ratio and financial risk of the listed companies, an enterprise capital structure selection model was constructed according to the risk preference of the major shareholders. Next, based on a research theory, the research hypothesis was proposed, and an empirical analysis of the impact of PE/VC as a major shareholder on the financial risk of its holding enterprises before and after the COVID-19 pandemic was performed. Finally, imputing the COVID_19 factor in the capital structure selection model, the impact of PE/VC on the financial risk of SMEs during the COVID-19 pandemic was assessed.  \n\nThis paper draws the following two conclusions:  \n\na. PE/VC plays a negative role in the financial risk of SMEs in China. Compared with enterprises without PE/VC holdings, those with PE/VC holdings had greater financial risks, indicating that PE/VC could deteriorate an enterprise's financial risks. Thus, to pursue higher returns, PE/VC usually prefers risk over other investment institutions, so the financial risk of enterprises with PE/VC support is usually greater than that of other enterprises without PE/VC holding. b. PE/VC has played a positive role in the financial risk of enterprises during the COVID-19 pandemic. When a crisis occurs, PE/VC will consciously strengthen the companies' risk control and tends to invest with a lower risk to avoid high risk. Thus, PE/VC are smart investors who can change their risk preferences based on the international situation anytime, helping enterprises survive during the CoVID-19 pandemic.  \n\nBased on these conclusions, some policy recommendations can be made:  \n\ni. The government must focus on strengthening PE/VC enterprise risk control in SMEs. It is necessary to formulate relevant capital market policies and supervision systems to block the negative effects, which can help maintain the steady development of the capital market.  \n\ni. During the ongoing CovID-19 pandemic, it is necessary for governments to execute some easing policies for the access and investment policies of PE/VC; these can promote the positive impacts of PE/VC on the financial risk management of SMEs, thus helping them survive during this crisis.  \n\niii. The government should focus on smarter investment institutions, such as PE/VC, which can identify potential enterprises and provide strong financial support, thereby helping potential enterprises to thrive during the CovID-19 pandemic.  \n\nAlthough the contributions of this study to the existing literature are clear and new insights have been provided for scholars and policymakers, future studies should focus on aspects of investment institutions, such as how supportive investment institutions can help SEMs survive after the COVID-19 pandemic and provide more practical policies for such institutions in China and other counties.  \n\n# Declaration of competing interest  \n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.  \n\n# Data availability  \n\nhe data used to support the findings of this study are included within the article and supplementary information file.  \n\n# Appendix A.

We identified three network positional features: degree centrality, Eigen-value centrality, and efficiency that hypothetically are consequential to a VC firm's performance. Our data analysis reveals that network efficiency is a significant but negative determinant of a VC firm's performance - the network inefficiency, measured by the extent to which the alter firms of an ego firm are connected with each other boosts the ego firm's performance. We discuss such findings by contextualizing them in the unique institutional environment and emerging market of China.  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nA Venture Capital (VC) syndication network is comprised of venture capitalist firms investing in a common set of venture capital projects. Such a co-investment network between VC firms draws significant attention from a broad spectrum of audiences from practitioners to academics such fields as finance/accounting, management science, and sociology. Scholars from different disciplines investigate the issue with different perspectives and emphases. For example, finance and accounting faculty examine the syndication network and its fiscal returns to the VC firms. Management scholars are interested in how the syndication network affects the negotiations and power structures in corporate governance structures, especially between top management and board members. Sociologists tend to focus on the network structure itself, describing the centralities, connectivity, and efficiency of VC firms in a syndication network. This study makes use of a time-sequence dataset of VC firms in China, constructing the syndication network between VC firms from 2005 to 2009 and examining the effects of the network on firm performance between 2010 and 2014.  \n\nThe purpose of this study is twofold: first, the industry of Venture Capital is characterized by widespread activities of interfirm networking. VC firms are the most motivated to form network partnerships. So, an important research question is, do such active networking activities payoff? We especially want to know how such an effect unfold in a very different institutional environments. This study intends to develop this line of research by examining the efficacy of a syndication network on a VC firm's performance in China, an operating setting drastically different from its western counterparts. Second, at the theoretical level, this paper intends to enrich the long dispute between structural hole theory (Burt, 2001) on the one hand, and social closure on the other (Coleman, 1990) regarding what type of network configurationisconducivetosocialcapital.Thedebatebetweenthetwo streams of arguments inspired, rather than stifled, a great number of research trying to apply each insight into different research areas (see Burt 2001: 31-57). We can add to this fruitful line of contention through the empirical examination of a VC syndication network in China. As we will show, the two lines of contention generate diverging predictions regarding what type of network configuration is beneficiary to Chinese VC firms. Our empirical study demonstrates that social closure, rather than a structural hole, is instrumental in helping VC firms achieve IPO in their sponsored projects. We state that our research does not refute the structural hole argument, but instead, adds scope conditions to this line of theoretical debate. That is: with the unique institutional environment under which the Chinese VC firms operate, social closure matters more than any structural hole in affording structural leverage to those VC firms.  \n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as such: first, we discuss social networks in general, and the syndication networks among VC firms in particular, and how such networks affect a firm's performance. Second, we describe the unique institutional features of Chinese VC firms, looking at the regulatory/coercive, normative, and cognitive/ mimetic environments and how those interfere with the development of a VC firm's syndication network and its effect on the firm's performance in China. This section is followed by research hypotheses relating the network characteristics of the VC firms to their performances. Third, we explain our dataset and variable constructions, followed by discussions of main findings from our data analysis. We complete our paper with a discussion of our findings in reference to the unique cultural and institutional features of the Chinese market, alluding to future topics in this line of work.  \n\n## 2. Social networks: why do they matter?  \n\nSocial scientists have been paying attention to social networks as early as the 1920s when scholars were examining children's playground behaviors (see Freeman, 2004). Fast forwarding to the 1970s, Granovetter (1973) studied job seekers, reporting that those with many weak ties to remote others end up having better job perspectives than those with a few strong ties. Behind the “strength of weak tie” phenomenon is an informational benefit: while strong-ties lead to redundant information, weak-tie contacts provide job-seekers with useful, non-redundant information. In this case, the social network is a structure; information is the substance flowing in the structure. Other scholars developed the concept of social capital to describe in general the substances embedded in the network. For example, Bourdieu (1980) stated that social capital is the sum of the resources, actual or virtual, that accrues to an individual or group by virtue of their possessing a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition. Coleman (1990) proposed that social capital can be defined by its function: it consists of some aspect of a social structure, and it facilitates certain actions of individuals who are within the social structure. To Lin (2001), social capital is a social asset embodying all of an actor's connections and access to resources in the network or group of which they are members. Much like other capitals such as physical capital or human capital, social capital requires deliberate investment by individuals and calculated acts to recoup those investment by mobilizing those resources embedded in the social networks (Lin,2001: 21).  \n\nHence, scholars (Coleman, 1990; Granovetter, 1973; Lin,2001) converge in identifying substances such as trust, norms, information, influences, credentials or reinforcement (Lin, 2001: 20), which are embedded in social networks. Those embedded resources are social capital that, upon mobilization, can be used to facilitate the actions of members in the networks or goals of the entire collective entities. However, researchers diverge at the issue of which network configurations are conducive to resource mobilization to facilitate individual actions. For example, Coleman (1990) asserted that network closure is facilitative to the passage of useful information, the building of trust, and the formation of strong norms that in turn benefit all members of the network. In contrast, Burt (1992) propagated that network structural holes broker the flow of information between people and control the projects that bring together people from opposite sides of the hole. The section below briefly describes and compares the two distinctive network mechanisms that bring about social capital for the network members.  \n\nKey to Coleman's view of social network structure in the creation of social capital is establishing trust and norms that have binding force on the members of the network structure (Coleman, 1990: 318). A network configuration that has many dense connections between its nodes is conducive to the creations of trust and norms. Only through such dense and often redundant connections between network members can trust be developed, norms be created, and durable structures begin to emerge. In Coleman's example of a network of parents and children under supervision, a network of closure, in which all pairs of parents are connected with each other, accomplishes effective supervision of all the children in the network. This is because the dense connection between parents allows trust between parents to develop and norms to supervise all other children to emerge. In contrast, a network without closure, in which some connections between pairs of parents have gone missing, supervision suffers. The parents falling outside of the interparental linkages do not have obligations to supervise other children and cannot be expected to do so by others. Thus, Coleman's network structure that is conducive to the production of social capital emphasizes strong connections and social closures between the network components.  \n\nContrary to the social closure process, Ron Burt (1992) underscored non-redundant sources of information. While cohesive contacts (contacts strongly connected to each other) are likely to have similar information, structural holes separate non-redundant information, information coming from disjointed rather than overlapping sources. Therefore, individuals who bridge over many structural holes in their networks have the structural leverage to broker the flow of information between people, facilitating their professional performances. For example, individuals who diversify their network contacts across multiple separate groups are the first ones to know first-hand information from those disconnected groups, the first ones to exercise control over that information, and the first ones to reap the benefits from the flow of that information. Therefore, for network actors, being connected to people who are already connected with each other results in social closure and low network efficiency as the information available in the network is redundant. Instead, network actors should strategically establish connections with disjointed groups of people to receive non-redundant information.  \n\nTo better illustrate the two lines of contention, we borrow a graph from Burt (1997: 341). Fig. 1 shows that two individuals 0ccupy different network positions. James benefits from having a strong close-knit but redundant circle of friends, while Robert is situated in a network with four distinctive non-overlapping groups of people. Who has the better network structure in terms of receiving social capital to facilitate action? It depends on who you ask. Per Coleman (1988), James will benefit because the dense connections and strong ties produce norms and sanctions against opportunism, which James can capitalize on to further his personal endeavors. However, to Burt (1997), Robert would have the advantage over James because the information that flows to Robert is novel, non-redundant, and additive, unlike the redundant information available to James. Although the figure uses individuals, one can easily replace them with firms, asking do VC firms benefit from close-knit strong ties or from diverse ties that provide non-redundant, fresh information?  \n\n![](images/5bcb8ab1c0b36aafcf21c08436d1968484245166b23a6873e1d957171edc488e.jpg)  \nFig. 1. An illustration of structural hole versus social closure.  \n\nEssentially, the two network mechanisms point to two different types of social capital: while social closure breeds trust and norms, structural holes provide non-redundant information. We propose that which type of social capital (hence network mechanism) matters depends on a variety of factors, such as value addition (structural hole) or value actualization (social closure) for the network (Burt, 2001), or institutional/cultural distinctions. For example, Bian (1997) studied the Chinese labor market, where the market mechanism was in its infancy but governmental administrative control was strong; in the Chinese market, strong ties that link personal networks matter in finding a job. This is because influence rather than information (redundant or not) matters in helping the job seekers. To deal with the cumbersome bureaucracy, helpers need to exert influences to advocate for the seekers, and helpers are willing to do so only when they are connected with seekers through strong ties. Although Bian's (1997) research is not directly pertinent to dissolving the contention between social closure and structural hole theory, it alerts us to the importance of social contexts in determining which network mechanism matters in producing favorable outcomes for network actors.  \n\nIn light of the above theoretical discussions, we will review studies of VC firm syndication networks and firm performance in the following sections. Then we focus on Chinese VC firm syndication networks in particular, explaining in great detail the cultural/institutional differences between Chinese and Western networks. That section is concluded with research hypotheses that summarize our theoretical discussions.  \n\n## 3. VC firm syndication network and firm performance  \n\nAs stated above, although the discussion uses individuals/persons as the unit of analysis, these individuals can be easily replaced with aggregated units of analysis such as organizations or companies. In fact, many empirical studies in support of Burt's structural hole theory examine the work groups (Rosenthal, 1997) or look at the company level (Hansen, Podolny, & Pfeffer, 2001; Pennings, Lee, & Witteloostuijn, 1998; Stuart & Podolny, 1999). This study is about venture capitalist firms (VC) firms, firms which often engage in co-investment networks (syndication network) when it comes to making VC investment in worthy projects. The pervasiveness of VC syndication networks is unparalleled in other industries, which has provoked a great deal of research studies from a diverse group of disciplines. Many of those studies focus on the effect of syndication networks on firm performance; indeed, VC firms actively look for other firms to find good investment opportunities or good partners for a successful investment. A common presumption is that those efforts would pay off in terms of having desirable investment outcomes, a metric often measured with IPOs from the invested projects.  \n\nSo, the questions are how does the VC syndication network benefit the networked firms and how does this benefit work? Researchers generally agree that VC syndication helps with improving a firm's performance, but they diverge on what are the mechanisms linking syndication networks to desirable outcomes. For example, researchers found that syndication networks improve firms' performance by diversifying their risks (Lockett & Wright, 2001; Wilson,1968),by granting VC firms with access to a large number of investment targets (Cumming, 2006; Sorenson & Stuart, 2001), by helping VC firms to \"window dress (Lerner, 1994),” by increasing VC's power and influence (Podolny, 2001), by expanding VC's scope of operation (Sorenson & Stuart, 2001), by limiting the entries of competing VCs (Hochberg, Ljungqvist, & Lu, 2010), and by reducing market uncertainties (Podolny, 2001). Some more studies focus on trust building and access to management experiences. Syndication networks create informal mechanisms of enforcement of mutual obligations based on trust, obligations that are more efficient than legal contractual mechanisms (Wright & Lockett, 2003). Syndication also allows partnering firms to supplement each other's management experiences (Brander, Amit, & Antweiler, 2002) and optimizes VC's access to expertise in evaluating potential investment target risks (Lerner, 1994).  \n\nA couple of studies are especially worth-noting as they tried to summarize different mechanisms and identify the most potent processes. One is Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu (2007), which used sociological theories to examine whether involvement in a syndication network provides VC firms with additional power and influence. Complying with the main sociological network argument (centrality matters), they found that central network positions improve VC firm performance and increases the chance of a favorable exit for their portfolio companies.  \n\nAnother study is one by Trapido (2012), who empirically examined the four mechanisms underlying the economic benefits to recipient VC firms from a VC's participation in a syndication network. The four mechanisms under Trapido's (2012) investigation are (1) trust among VC firms is present, (2) investors in the syndication network engage in less exploitation of information asymmetries, (3) co-investment partners compensate each other's management expertise, and (4) co-investment partners diversify risk evaluation skills, reaching an optimal level of risk assessment of recipient firms. His study did not lend clear empirical support to those arguments, prompting him to resort to Brian Uzzi's (1997） optimal embeddedness theory: network ties with both arm's-length market transactions and close-knit long-term partnerships. He further cautioned that over-embeddedness may stifle innovation, suppress unconventional ideas, and inhibit the flow of non-redundant information, all critical factors in overcoming industrial-wide crises such as the one experienced by VC firms in the early 2lst century.  \n\nIn the above sections, we reviewed the literature of how a network accrues benefits to its participants in general, and how a VC syndication network benefits the VC investment firms in particular. One of the most important factors influencing how a network exerts its impact on participating actors is the national difference: distinctive institutional/ cultural environments may shape and form a network and its embedded actors in many different ways. However, all the literature we reviewed so far focuses on the US or Western Europe, areas that have mature institutional environments and advanced capitalistic markets. Such markets and environments are not present in emerging market such as China, where personal property rights are not well established, legalistic regulations are spotty, and governmental rules, guidelines, and directives often interfere with the market forces to command firms' behaviors. How does a VC syndication network impacts VC firms in the drasticallydifferent societalcontext of China?The sections below highlight some key differences in Chinese VC market and deduce testable hypotheses for our empirical studies.  \n\n## 4. VC firm syndication network in China  \n\nChinese VC firms are operating in very different legal, cultural, and institutional environments than their Western counterparts. Thanks to a few very careful and systematic studies of the Chinese VC industry, we now have a great deal of information on how the world's biggest emerging market in China shapes and forms its VC industry development (Ahlstrom,Bruton,& Yeh,2007; Bruton & Ahlstrom, 2003; Bruton, Ahlstrom, & Yeh, 2004). Below, we review those studies and deduce our testable hypotheses.  \n\nThe differences between Chinese VC firms and industry and Western firms appear in three main areas: ideological barriers, weak institutional environment and market forces, and strong governmental interventions. With ideological barriers, many governmental officials who are in charge of regulating VC firms and the industry perceive VC firms as a threat to state sectors such as the State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) They fear that VC firms are springboards for many private firms that will eventually mount significant competition with SOEs, ultimately changing the socialist Chinese society to a capitalistic society. Such hostility from government officials to an emerging industry is absent from Western societies, but it is very acute and pronounced in China where governmental policies are a strong force to shape the industry.  \n\nThe second difference in institutional environment and market forces encompasses three aspects: regulatory differences, normative differences, and cognitive differences. Western regulatory forces are characterized by strong legal frameworks, transparent financial markets, and effective corporate governance structures. In China, those forces are not in place yet: its corporate governance and legalistic backup is very weak, information is not transparent, and reporting mechanisms are very lax. With the normative aspect, Western countries have strong professional ethics and standards to follow. In China, VC firms establish associations that encourage professional conduct and propagate professional norms to shape a VC's behaviors. But those developments are in their early stages and have not yet reached Western standards. Cognitively, Western countries stress investor and stakeholder interest, a position supported with their transparent systems and disclosure practices. The Chinese system goes in the opposite direction: interpersonal connections (guanxi network) take precedence over an investor or stakeholder's rights. Information asymmetry is common and can be vulnerable to personal manipulation.  \n\nThe third pronounced difference between the Chinese VC operating environment and the Western environment is the strong governmental interventions that are common in China. Common wisdom always asserts that the Chinese industrial operating environment is characterized by weak market forces, feeble institutional regulations and norms. However, when it comes to regulating the industry, governmental interventions can be swift and strong. As early as 2oo1,the Chinese government proposed “Tentative Rules on Forming Foreign-Invested Venture Capital Investment Enterprises.\" Later in 2003, the government promulgated a new law “Regulation on the Administration of Foreign Invested Venture Capital Enterprises.\" The governmental regulations are not restricted to the central government level: often regional and provincial governments put forth their own regulations that can be at odds with the central administrative ones. It is not just foreign VC firms, however. Domestic Chinese VC firms are also subject to various rules and regulations, depending on their type. For example, the Chinese government encourages SOEs to establish VC firms, or to establish joint ventures with foreign VC firms. The government, however, limits private VC firms, and especially discourages financial institutes from engaging in VC activities. As a result, the VC firms in China are comprised mostly government of VC firms, and government-controlled VC firms through SOEs, whereas in the West, those types of VC firms are the minoritycases.  \n\nOverall, we believe the Chinese VC industry is facing a very differentenvironmentthanWesternVCfirms.Ontheonehand,the Chinese environment is very weak with regards to market forces and legalistic control; Chinese VC firms or personnel generally lack normative pressures for or cognitive recognition of professional conduct standards. On the other hand, the Chinese VC industry must battle with governmental officials who are distrusting of the VC industry or incompetent in regulating it, and yet, the governmental regulations can be strong and swift at times. Such a precarious situation compels VC firms in China to engage in pervasive guanxi networking (inter-personal network), a move that helps them obtain valuable information, receive cogent advice, and negotiate with the cumbersome governmental regulations.  \n\nKeys in the guanxi network are trust building and opportunism curbing. Amid the weak institutional and legalistic supports and strong governmental intervention, Chinese VC firms are very vulnerable to opportunism and outright cheating. For example, one Hong Kong VC firm funded a long-established business in Mainland China without conducting due diligence. One day, the recipient business suddenly closed its doors and disappeared, taking with it everything valuable, including porcelain toilets bathroom fixtures from every floor of the building (Bruton et al., 2004: 83). Without strong legal and institutional supports, Chinese VC firms rely heavily on their guanxi network to build the trust that gives them the assurances needed to conduct business. All of these factors lead to the critical assertion that we believe that social closure, not structural holes, has the most impact on the firm performance of VC syndication network in China. In the Chinese context trust building is the most important method that VC firms used to circumvent the problems of weak institutional supports and irregular government intervention. We want to clarify that we are not rejecting the information and control benefits that are associated with brokering structural holes but instead note that such actions are not as important as trust building and opportunism curbing in the Chinese context.  \n\nWe identify three network positional measures that can reveal a VC firm's closure or embeddedness in the syndication network. Here, we clarify that we use syndication network as a proxy to guanxi network as the pairs of firms engaging in co-investment would develop inter-firm relationships and inter-personal relations between their boundaryspanning personnel. The three positional measures are degree centrality, eigenvalue centrality, and efficiency. In the syndication network, degree centrality is simply the number of co-investment partners a given VC firm has. Degree centrality is often associated with influences, information, and expertise. For example, VC firms tied with other firms through co-investment gain valuable “deal-flow” information from their partners about other investment opportunities. During postinvestment, VC firms involved in co-investment often engage in valueadding activities to facilitate their co-investment projects, resulting in favorableoutcomes.  \n\nIn particular, degree centrality in the Chinese context can be related to trust building and opportunism curbing. A VC firm with many coinvestment partners builds trust in their partners by virtue of being a well-connected firm - other firms trust the VC firm with a high-degree centrality because deceptive business conducts cost them dearly in reputation. High-degree centrality also enables VC firms to spot any shirking or business deviation, allowing them to make preemptive strikes against those opportunistic acts.  \n\nHypothesis 1. The higher the degree centrality for VC firms, the higher the proportion of their funded firms exited through IPOs.  \n\nThe second measure indicative of trust building and social closure is eigenvalue centrality. Eigenvalue measures to what extent a focal VC firm's contact firms are connected with other firms in the network (Borgatti, Everett, & Johnson, 2013). To illustrate, Fig. 2 shows two VC firms that have an identical degree centrality of 3. But, the eigenvalue for firm A is higher than the eigenvalue of firm B as those firms that have ties with firm A have ties with other firms, whereas firms connecting with firm B are all isolated from the rest of network. Instead of measuring direct connections, eigenvalue measures indirect connections. High eigenvalue firms would be able to connect to a number of other firms through their immediate contacts, and in the Chinese context where relationships are paramount, having many indirect contacts is as useful as having many direct ones. This is because in relationaloriented societies, people, as well as firms, often refer to themselves in relational terms, such as I am somebody's friend, or at firm level, we are some renowned firm's partners. In such a context, indirect ties are not as remote as they are in Western societies. Thus, we anticipate that the eigenvalue exerts the same effects on firm performance as the degree centrality through trust building and opportunism curbing.  \n\nHypothesis 2. The higher the eigenvalue centrality for VC firms, the higher the proportion of their funded firms exited through IPOs.  \n\nThe third network position measure is network efficiency, measured by the extent to which a network actor's contacts are connected to each other as well (Borgatti, 1997). Such a measure directly derives from  \n\n![](images/d6b3cf5453a4236470c5d74ffa5e2ccf75056ca4a00a8ad552150771595bf9bd.jpg)  \nFig. 2. An illustration of two firms with different eigenvalues.  \n\nBurt's structural hole argument (Burt, 1992). It is called efficiency because it inversely related to Burt's redundancy - if an actor's contacts are connected with each other, the actor's network is characterized by social closure (high redundancy or low efficiency). Conversely, if an actor's network contacts are all disconnected from each other, the actor has a network with many structural holes (low redundancy or high efficiency), which gives the actor brokerage leverage to draw information and control benefits. Fig. 3 illustrates the two distinctive network configurations. Per the algorithm for efficiency computation in UCINET (Borgatti, 1997), the efficiency for ego A is $33.33\\%$ because A_1's redundancy is 2/3 -it connects with two of the total three alters of the ego. The other two alters have the same redundancy of 2/3. So, the efiency forA is $33.33\\%\\left({\\frac{3-{\\frac{2}{3}}*3}{3}}=33.33\\%\\right).$ Using the same procedure, one can easily calculate that the efficiency for ego B is $100\\%$ .Comparing the two network actors, A's efficiency is lower but its social closure is higher; in contrast, B's efficiency is higher but its social closure is lower. The efficiency measure is the most important variable to look at in our study as it simultaneously reveals both mechanisms - on one end of the continuum is the low efficiency or high redundancy, which suggests high social closure. On the other end lies the high efficiency or low redundancy, which correlates with structural holes. Based on our discussions,we contend that social closures,rather than structural holes, are conducive to trust building and opportunism curbing in Chinese VC industry, resulting in better firm performance.  \n\nHypothesis 3. The higher the efficiency measure for VC firms, the lower the proportion of their funded firms exited through IPOs.  \n\n## 5. Data and variables  \n\nOur data comes from the China Venture Source, an information company that specializes in information on Venture Capital (VC) firms in China. The China Venture Source supplied our research team with information on 3013 venture capital firms, a dataset that includes all VC firms that made at least oneinvestment since 1985 in mainland China. Over the years, many of those firms liquidated or merged with other firms. Therefore, we only look at those VC firms that have been active from 2005 to 2014,producing a list of 2708VCfirms that have at least one investment since 2005. Because we are particularly interested in the social network aspects of vC firms and how their network features affect their performance, we looked at the investment records of those firms, paying attention to co-investment events (investments that involve at least two VC firms). From the co-investment events, we created a full network of VC firms (syndication network) engaging in co-investmentwith each other.  \n\nOur data are longitudinal in that we have information on each VC firm's investment, profiles, and performance from 2005 to 2014. We construct the syndication network with co-investment data between the VC firms between 2005 and 2009. In particular, we identify 3673 coinvestment events that link 837 VC firms during these years. Because almost all co-investment between all pairs of the VC firms is one (one co-investment event for any given pair), we dichotomize the syndication network to produce a binary undirected matrix consisting of 837 VC firms. For the dependent variable, we calculate the rate of IPO exit among all exits for each of the VC firms between 2010 and 2014, so that our network measures are precedent to the performance measures. We also add to those VC firms from our original dataset other time-constant variables such as corporate profiles and background features.  \n\nUsing UCINET to analyze the syndication network comprising the 837 VC firms, we obtain the three network measures of degree centrality, eigenvalue centrality, and efficiency. We contend that our multiyear measurement of the firms' network structures overcomes the idiosyncrasies of the network activities of any single year, producing an overall(thus robust)barometer of firm network activities.We construct our dependent variable of VC firm performance from 2010 to 2014, using the rate of IPO exits among all exit options. Any VC fund under the management of a VC firm commonly produces four different outcomes: Initial Public offering (IPO), merger and acquisition, equity transfer, and liquidation. We use the rate of IPOs because it is the most successful and unambiguous outlet among all four results. For each VC firm, we add the numbers of “IPOs” of different funds under its management over the four-year span between 2010 and 2014. VC firm performance tends to fluctuate from year to year, adding multi-year performances makes our measure more robust and less vulnerable to the anomalies caused by annual fluctuations.  \n\nTable 1 displays the descriptive statistics of and bivariate coefficients between degree centrality, eigenvalue, efficiency, and IPO rate. The average degree centrality of the syndication network is 5.90, suggesting very spotty connections between VC firms as the maximum possible connection one firm can have is 836 in the network of 837 firms. The average efficiency is almost $70\\%$ , indicating high efficiency and low closure. The average eigenvalue (0.02) is also relatively low, denoting that the extent to which the focal firm's contacts are connected with other firms in the network is very limited. All three measures suggest that the syndication network density and connectivity with each other are relatively low. In contrast, the IPO rate of the sampled VC firms reaches a fairly high level of $68.79\\%$ ,meaningthat $68.79\\%$ of the firms funded by the VC firms in the sample end up reaching the IPO stage. One reason for such a high IPO rate is related to our computation procedure. For example, if one particular project that is managed by two VC firms in the sample ends up with an IPO, both VC firms would account for the project in their IPO calculation, creating an inflated IPO rate for the VC firms. Although such an inflated rate may affect the measures of central tendencies (mean and median), it should not distort the measures of standard deviation or significantly affect the multiple regression analyses. Also note that although we have 837 VC firms in the syndication network, only 466 of those reported their IPO rate, resulting in a sample of 464 firms that provided valid information on all  \n\n![](images/45d012c8a8bbc73c1d1aa4fbe47d5b1672d86905dd4ffebc02e53418ae8159cd.jpg)  \nA: Social closure: low efficiency and high redundancy, efficiency $=33.33\\%$  \n\n![](images/6c95db0a93f012ad305b4e17b88f8d9de918d43ef83d5e6f9708da97cf3b4e35.jpg)  \nFig. 3. An illustration of efficiency and redundancy.  \n\nB: structural holes: high efficiency and low redundancy, efficiency $=100\\%$ the variables in our multivariate models. To ensure consistency, this sample of 464 VC firms is our final sample for various models in our data analyses.  \n\nTable1 Descriptive statistics of key network measures and IPO rate.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Degree centrality</td><td>Eigenvalue</td><td>Efficiency</td><td>IPOrate</td></tr><tr><td>Degree centrality 一</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Eigenvalue</td><td>0.92</td><td>一</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Efficiency</td><td>-0.01</td><td>-0.027</td><td>一</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>IPOrate</td><td>-0.044</td><td>-0.075</td><td>-0.08</td><td>一</td></tr><tr><td>Mean</td><td>5.90</td><td>0.02</td><td>69.75%</td><td>68.79%</td></tr><tr><td>Median</td><td>3.00</td><td>0.01</td><td>75.00%</td><td>83.33%</td></tr><tr><td>St.d.</td><td>9.08</td><td>0.03</td><td>26.74%</td><td>37.35%</td></tr><tr><td>N</td><td>837</td><td>837</td><td>837</td><td>466</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n\\*P<.05. \\*\\*P<.01. $\\mathrm{~P~}<.001$ (two-tailed test).  \n\nThe bivariate correlations show high and significant correlation between degree centrality and eigenvalue. However, none of the other pairs of variables has significant correlation. In light of those findings, we will run separate regressions between degree centrality and eigenvalue to prevent the multi-collinearity between the two variables from affecting the parameter estimates. In addition, to curb the spuriousness, we also put several mediating variables under control in our multivariate regression analyses: capital source, VC firm headquarters, VC firm types, and VC firm backgrounds. The Appendix A displays the construction and descriptive statistics of those variables.  \n\n## 6. Findings  \n\nTable 2 shows the unstandardized coefficients of the OLS regression of the IPO rate for VC firms engaging in syndication networking. Our empirical analyses do not support the first two hypotheses - neither degree centrality nor Eigen value has a significant influence on the IPO rate of the funded projects. In contrast, Hypothesis 3 is supported since in both models efficiency exerts significant effect on the IPO rate - each unit of increase in efficiency reduces the IPO rate by about $12\\%$ .In the control variables, the VC background appears to have a significant impact on the IPO rate: government-controlled VC and independent VC all have higher IPO rate than bank VC firms. Such a result is a bit surprising since we anticipated the government VC firms would benefit from their ties with the government in the Chinese institutional environment. Our data analyses suggest that such an alleged benefit of having the governments backing did not appear in the IPO exits.  \n\nOur efficiency measurement of network configurations bears significant connotation as it identifies two network mechanisms. The high efficiency simply means disconnections between alter VC firms for a given focal firm, so that the focal firm has many structural holes to bridge. High efficiency also denotes low social closure, as the network around the focal firm tends to have low density due to disconnections between alter firms. In contrast, low efficiency suggests many connections between alter firms for a given focal firm - it is low efficiency because the focal firm does not have many structural holes to draw structural advantages. However, low efficiency also means high social closure, as the alter firms are well connected with each other. Therefore, our finding that high efficiency impedes or low efficiency facilitates VC firm performance suggests that social closure, not structural holes, produces a structural network advantage to Chinese VC firms. We contend in the previous discussions that trust building and opportunism curbing are associated with social closure, while information and control are associated with structural holes. Thus, we reason that trust building and opportunism curbing are key benefits conferred to Chinese VC firms engaging in a syndication network, while information and control do not appear to make a difference in Chinese VC firm performance.  \n\nTable2 Unstandardized coefficients of OLS regression of IPO rate for VC firms.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Predictors</td><td>Degree</td><td>Eigen-value</td></tr><tr><td>Constant</td><td>56.915***</td><td>57.758***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(17.240)</td><td>(17.204)</td></tr><tr><td>Networkpositions</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>·Degree</td><td>-0.036</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.173)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>●Eigen-value</td><td></td><td>-31.613</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(54.029)</td></tr><tr><td>●Efficiency</td><td>-12.096*</td><td>-11.949*</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(6.139)</td><td>(6.028)</td></tr><tr><td>Controls</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>● Capital source - Chinese</td><td>1.004</td><td>0.212</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(5.991)</td><td>(5.985)</td></tr><tr><td>● Capital source-Foreign</td><td>-12.048</td><td>12.455</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(6.872)</td><td>(6.801)</td></tr><tr><td>●Capital source-both (REF)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>●HQ-Beijing</td><td>-14.616</td><td>14.455</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(9.459)</td><td>(9.457)</td></tr><tr><td>●HQ-Shanghai</td><td>-16.385</td><td>-16.487</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(9.348)</td><td>(9.347)</td></tr><tr><td>●HQ-Guangdong</td><td>-5.984</td><td>6.277</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(10.174)</td><td>(10.180)</td></tr><tr><td>●HQ-Jiangsu</td><td>2.601</td><td>2.237</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(10.762)</td><td>(10.779)</td></tr><tr><td>●HQ-Hong Kong,Macau or Taiwan</td><td>6.380</td><td>6.470</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(10.013)</td><td>(10.011)</td></tr><tr><td>●HQ-China other</td><td> 4.673</td><td>4.834</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(9.863)</td><td>(9.864)</td></tr><tr><td>●HQ-US</td><td>- 4.069</td><td>-3.636</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(8.406)</td><td>(8.406)</td></tr><tr><td>●HQ-other Countries (REF)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>●VC-private equity</td><td>14.937</td><td>14.630</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(12.080)</td><td>(12.088)</td></tr><tr><td>●VC - venture capital</td><td>12.398</td><td>12.467</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>●VC-hybrid</td><td>(11.865)</td><td>(11.850)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>13.041</td><td>13.026</td></tr><tr><td>●VC -bank or corporations (REF)</td><td>(12.259)</td><td>(12.243)</td></tr><tr><td>●Background-BVC</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>28.316**</td><td>28.224**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(9.509)</td><td>(9.490)</td></tr><tr><td>●Background -CVC</td><td>20.200**</td><td>20.361**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(7.468)</td><td>(7.466)</td></tr><tr><td>●Background-GCVC</td><td>18.165*</td><td>18.077*</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(8.804)</td><td>(8.800)</td></tr><tr><td>●Background -IVC</td><td>15.701*</td><td>15.782*</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(7.062)</td><td>(7.047)</td></tr><tr><td>●Background -GVC (REF)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>ModelR²andsignificance</td><td>7.7%**</td><td>7.7%**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>464</td><td>464</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n\\* $\\mathrm{~P~}<.05$ $\\ast\\ast\\mathrm{~\\bf~P~}<.01$ $\\mathrm{~P~}<.001$ (two-tailed test).  \n\n## 7. Conclusion  \n\nWe trace the VC firms' syndication network in China using the coinvestment of funds between pairs of VC firms between 2005 and 2009 to construct the network.We then use the network measures of the firms in the network to explain the variation of their performances, indicated with the IPO rates of their funded projects between 2010 and 2014. Despite the recognition that VC firms in the financial market strongly favor networks and partnerships over the arm's-length, strict market transaction (Hochberg et al., 2007; Hochberg et al., 2010; Trapido, 2012), studies of the relations between network and VC firm are limited. Research in this vein in emerging markets such as China is even scarcer. Our investigation represents one of the first few empirical longitudinal examinations of the network positioning and its effect on performance for VC firms in China.  \n\nOur research should contribute to the extant knowledge of social network studies in general, and VC syndication network in particular. We contextualize the debate of social closure and structural holes in the Chinese institutional environments. VC firms in China operate with a great level of uncertainty due to the weak legal framework, feeble professional norms and supports, and strong and unpredictable governmental interventions. Thus, they need to build trust and develop their own monitoring mechanisms to curb opportunism - VC firms not exercising sufficient due diligence often suffer failed investments due to the weak legal protection and property right laws in China. The most pronounced benefits of having social closure to network actors are trust building, norm forming, and opportunism constraints. Therefore, those VC firms with strong social closure in their network configurations actualize their structural leverage with a higher IPO rate of their funded projects. Our research adds a scope condition to the contestation between social closure and structural holesinthe Chinese institutional environment:socialclosurefor VC firms in Chinamattersfor their performance. Perhaps in other emerging markets, or in mature markets such as North American or Western Europe, structural holes, with their information and control benefits, are a more pertinent or potent factor to influence the performance of network actors. Certainly, those are topicsworthy of future study.  \n\nGoing back to our original motivation for this research, we think we achieve the dual purposes of this study. We contribute to the knowledge base of VC syndication network by examining the effect of the network on firm performance in a different institutional context. The unique institutional environment under which Chinese VC firms operate renders those “low efficient structures - those close-knit strong connections” potent in affording network benefits to VC firms. At the theoretical level, we enhance the position in the debate between structural holes and social closures that no theory is universally true. Under the conditions of the Chinese operating environment, social closures that breed norms of trust and sanction against opportunism and malfeasance bestow VC firms with needed network benefits.  \n\nFor future studies, despite our allegation that social closure carries with it trust building, norm forming, and opportunistic behavioral constraining for VC syndication network firms, we do not have measures directly indicative of those mechanisms or processes, leaving behind an important task for scholars. Either through ethnographic methods, or quantitative surveys, researchers can go behind the scenes, examining the social capital accrued from a dense network (a focal firm is surrounded by partner firms that are also partners with each other), as opposed to the social capital from a spotty network (a focal firm is surrounded by partner firms that are disconnected from each other). Prospective research along this line can uncover the detailed processes whereby the network confers benefits to its participants. Until then, our understanding of the network and its effects on a VC firm's performance remains speculative.  \n\nFinally, we emphasize that China is changing at a fairly fast pace, so the temporal limit to our findings is very relevant. What remains to be seen is what China is changing to. Here two theories emerged to predict  \n\nChina's development. One is represented by Victor Nee's assertion that Western style (Western Europe, US, and Japan) market and institution establishments are universal, and all other social and economic systems (including the Chinese systems) converge in a common effort to imitate such a market system. Another is lead by Andrew Warder and asserts that China is experimenting with a unique path that combined Western market mechanisms with Chinese social and political systems. Unlike Russia's shock treatment that dismantled an entire political regime in favor of a total rebuild of the political and economic regime, China is conducting an iterative experiment in which market reform to imitate  \n\nWestern countries is being grafted onto its political regime that remains solid and dedicated to Communism. How do such macro societal environment changes affect the network dynamic reported here? Will structural holes become more pertinent in a VC firm's performance if Chinese market reform intensifies, or the Chinese economic system converges with the Western ones? Or will new network dynamics of VC syndication emerge out of China's unique pathway of development? Those are topics beyond the scope of our research here, but certainly worthy of further investigations.  \n\nAppendix A.

This paper empirically investigates the impact of state-owned venture capital (SOvC) on enterprise innovation and identifies that SOvC exerts a more pronounced influence on enhancing enterprise innovation capability. SovC facilitates the enhancement of enterprise innovation capability by alleviating financial constraints, fostering joint investments, and attracting technical talents. This paper not only aids in identifying effective approaches to advance SoC reform but also contributes to enhancing enterprise innovation capability through the utilization of SoC.  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nChina's restructuring of SOC has enhanced the evolution of its management structure and operational mechanisms. The StateOwned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) has transitioned from a previous role of direct control to overseeing and managing SoC operating companies. This reform has separated the functions of operation and management from SOC, leading to a distinct segregation of responsibilities related to overseeing personnel, operations, and capital within state-owned enterprises. As a pivotal component of the experimental reforms in SOC investment and operations, SOvC maintains the traditional policy-driven attributes while also embodying the profit-oriented characteristics typical of general VC. This duality not only preserves the unique features of SoC but also fosters a more market-driven approach to capital management. Consequently, a comprehensive examination is imperative to understand the impact of SOvCs on enterprise innovation post-reform, given its significance in enterprise financing.  \n\nThere are many literatures explore the correlation between VC institutions and enterprise innovation. These studies demonstrate that VC can enhance innovation capabilities by providing value-added services in science, technology, and investment, meeting enterprises' capital requirements (Cavallo et al., 2019; Andrusiv et al., 2020; Pradhan et al., 2020; Li et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2024a). However, contrasting views exist regarding how different types of VC influence technological innovation within enterprises. Some research suggests that state-owned VC contributes to enhancing enterprises’ innovation capacity (Liegsalz & Wagner, 2013; Bernstein et al., 2016; Vanderhoven et al., 2020; Shao & Sun, 2021; Battisti at al., 2022; Wu et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024b), while others argue that government-backed institutions often struggle to grasp pertinent enterprise information, leading to a limited impact on innovation (Cochrane, 2005; Chemmanur et al., 2011; Nishimura & Okamuro, 2011; Zuo et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2020). Therefore, it is imperative to investigate whether a more market-oriented approach in SOvC post-reform can significantly influence enterprise innovation systematically.  \n\nIn this paper, an empirical analysis was conducted using data from China's A-share listed companies spanning 2011 - 2020 to examine the influence of SovC on enterprise innovation. The findings indicate a significant enhancement in the technological innovation capabilities of enterprises due to SOvC. This impact is attributed to several mechanisms, including the alleviation of financing constraints, the establishment of joint investment mechanisms, and the facilitation of talent attraction for enterprises. Furthermore, the paper categorizes listed companies based on their alignment with government-supported industries and investigates the heterogeneousinnovation effects of SovC.  \n\nThe paper's contribution lies in three key areas. Firstly, it examines the impact of market-oriented SOvC on enterprise innovation post SOC reform, investigating whether the level of marketization influences the innovation incentive efficacy of such investments. Secondly, it demonstrates that a more market-oriented approach to SovC can boost enterprise innovation levels, offering insights for SOC reforms globally. Lastly, the paper delves into the precise mechanisms through which SOVC influences enterprise innovation, laying the groundwork for enhancing the innovation promotion efficacy of such investments.  \n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the econometric model and data; Section 3 presents the empirical results and robustness checks; and Section 4 concludes.  \n\n## 2. Empirical model and data  \n\n### 2.1.Empirical model  \n\nIn order to quantify the extent to which SOVC institutions promote the innovation ability of enterprises, this paper establishes the following empirical model:  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{{INent}_{\\mathrm{{i}t}}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}V C n a t u r e}_{\\mathrm{{i}t-1}}+\\beta_{2}C S t r u c t_{\\mathrm{{i},\\mathrm{{i-1}}}}+\\beta_{3}L A s s e t_{\\mathrm{{i},\\mathrm{{i-1}}}}+\\beta_{4}G r o w_{\\mathrm{{i},\\mathrm{{i-1}}}}+\\beta_{5}\\mathsf{R O E}_{\\mathrm{{i},\\mathrm{{i-1}}}}+\\mathrm{{Firm}_{\\mathrm{{i}}}+Y e a r_{\\mathrm{{t}}}+\\beta_{1}S t r u c t_{\\mathrm{{i-1}}}}+\\beta_{2}G r o w_{\\mathrm{{i},\\mathrm{{i-1}}}}\n$$  \n\nEq. (1) is established to verify the influence of state-owned VC institution intervention (VCnature) on enterprise innovation (LInvent). Eq. (1) Both the intervention variables and control variables of China's capital VC have a lag effect on the impact of enterprise innovation, so both need to lag one order. In addition, the control variables that reflect enterprise management, such as asset structure, enterprise scale, net profit growth rate and ROE, will also have a lag effect on asset structure and enterprise scale, so the control variables also need to lag one order. We include year and firm fixed effects in Eq. (1).  \n\n### 2.2. Data  \n\nThis paper focuses on Chinese A-share listed companies spanning from 2011 - 2020. It excludes underperforming ST companies, financial institutions, and entities with significant data gaps, resulting in an empirical analysis involving 3,493listed companies as the research sample. Data sources for VC characteristics include verification from the Zero2IPO Private Equity database, Tianyancha database, and prospectuses. For VC indicators not available in databases, manual searches are conducted in the enterprise prospectuses and the oficial websites of VC institutions. The determination of joint investment from VC institutions in an enterprise hinges on identifying if more than two VC entities appear among the top ten shareholders. Table 1 shows variable definitions and summary statisticsforreference.  \n\n## 3. Results and discussion  \n\n### 3.1. Baseline results  \n\nTable 2 shows the benchmark regression findings of this paper, validating the impact of SovC on enterprise innovation. The first column's regression outcomes indicate that enterprises backed by SOvC institutions exhibit a superior level of technological innovation capability compared to those lacking such investments. In the second column, the regression equation adjusts for the influence of VC on enterprise innovation, revealing a consistently positive and significant coefficient for SOvC. This reaffirms the heightened efficacy of SOvC in enhancing enterprise innovation ability relative to non-state-owned counterparts.  \n\nTable1 Variable definitions and summary statistics.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variablename</td><td>Variabledefines</td><td>Samplesize</td><td>Mean</td><td>Standarddeviation</td><td>Max</td><td>Min</td></tr><tr><td>Invent</td><td>Number of invention patent applications and authorizations</td><td>12192</td><td>84.12</td><td>896.12</td><td>4799</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>RDinput</td><td>Innovationinput</td><td>7386</td><td>9.60</td><td>282.90</td><td>2572.39</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>VC</td><td>Venture capital</td><td>12192</td><td>0.371</td><td>0.52</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>VCnature</td><td>State-ownedventurecapital</td><td>9052</td><td>0.061</td><td>0.24</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Fcash</td><td>Freecashflow</td><td>12192</td><td>7.3e+6</td><td>3.2e+9</td><td>1.7e+11</td><td>-8.3e+10</td></tr><tr><td>Unite</td><td>Jointinvestment</td><td>11808</td><td>0.37</td><td>0.50</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>RDpeople</td><td>Number ofR&Dpersonnel</td><td>1123</td><td>625.83</td><td>2466.52</td><td>88533</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Gover</td><td>Governmentpolicysupport</td><td>7851</td><td>0.42</td><td>0.49</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTable2 The impact of state-owned VC on enterprise innovation.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1) LInvent</td><td>(2) LInvent</td></tr><tr><td>VCnature</td><td>0.797*** (8.604)</td><td>0.252*** (3.531)</td></tr><tr><td>VC</td><td></td><td>0.337***</td></tr><tr><td>CStruct</td><td>-0.001</td><td>(12.667) -0.005***</td></tr><tr><td>LAsset</td><td>(-.989) 0.283*** (10.212)</td><td>(-3.745) 0.333***</td></tr><tr><td>Grow</td><td>0.001** (-2.374)</td><td>(7.043) 0.001** (-1.962)</td></tr><tr><td>ROE</td><td>-0.002* (-1.74)</td><td>-0.002 (-1.347)</td></tr><tr><td>Constant</td><td>-3.648*** (-6.456)</td><td>-4.489*** (-4.53)</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed Effects</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>9052</td><td>9052</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.077</td><td>0.187</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: Values in parentheses are t-statistics corrected for heteroscedasticity; \\*, \\*\\*, and \\*\\*\\* denote significance at the $10\\%$ $5\\%$ and $1\\%$ levels, respectively.  \n\n### 3.2.Mechanism examination  \n\nWe use a two-stage mediation effect model to examine three impact mechanisms of SovC on enterprise innovation capability.  \n\n#### 3.2.1.Ease financing constraints mechanisms  \n\nSOVC exhibits robust financial strength, a solid capital chain, higher tolerance for enterprise innovation failures, and a focus on long-term enterprise outcomes. Consequently, the entry of state-owned VC institutions is more likely to mitigate the issue of inade. quate R&D funding for innovative enterprises and bolster their innovation capabilities. Within the regression model, LFcash denotes the logarithm of enterprises? free cash flow. Table 3's first two columns investigate the mechanism of alleviating financing constraints through SovC. The findings in the first column indicate that enterprises benefiting from VC involvement witness a significant increase in free cash flow compared to those without such partnerships, thereby easing the financing constraints they face. As illustrated in the second column's regression results, the mechanism of mitigating corporate financing constraints acts as a partial intermediary in the VC regression that drives corporate innovation. Hence, SOVC fosters enterprise innovation by addressing the financing challenges encountered by invested firms.  \n\n#### 3.2.2.Joint investment mechanism  \n\nSOVC institutions not only retain the investment advantages of conventional risk institutions but also amplify the \"endorsement effect\" of the government. This release of a more potent positive spillover effect extends to external investors, attracting state-owned banks, other financial institutions, and VC firms to provide financing or equity funding for target enterprises, thereby securing additional external financial support for the invested businesses. Columns 3 and 4 in Table 3 scrutinize the collaborative investment mechanism of SOvC. The regression outcomes in these columns demonstrate that SOvC enhances the innovation capabilities of enterprises through this joint investment mechanism.  \n\nTable3 The mechanisms of state-owned VC on enterprise innovation.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1) LFcash</td><td>(2) LInvent</td><td>(3) Unite</td><td>(4) LInvent</td><td>(5) LRDpeople</td><td>(6) LInvent</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">VCnature</td><td>0.447***</td><td>0.228**</td><td>0.316*</td><td>0.281***</td><td>0.382***</td><td>0.393***</td></tr><tr><td>(10.861)</td><td>(2.533)</td><td>(1.852)</td><td>(6.816)</td><td>(6.526)</td><td>(5.706)</td></tr><tr><td>LFcash</td><td></td><td>0.139* (1.879)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Unite</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.039*** (3.451)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>LRDpeople</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.009***</td></tr><tr><td>Constant</td><td>6.353***</td><td>5.822**</td><td>-0.008</td><td>-0.001</td><td>-4.966*</td><td>(4.842) -4.816***</td></tr><tr><td>Controlvariables</td><td>(2.939)</td><td>(2.212)</td><td>(-.061)</td><td>(-1.27)</td><td>(-1.725)</td><td>(-5.104)</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed effects</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>Yes 9052</td><td>Yes 9052</td><td>Yes 9052</td><td>Yes 9052</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1123</td><td>1123</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.034</td><td>0.129</td><td>0.102</td><td>0.099</td><td>0.082</td><td>0.079</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: Values in parentheses are t-statistics corrected for heteroscedasticity; \\*, \\*\\*, and \\*\\*\\* denote significance at the $10\\%$ $5\\%$ and $1\\%$ levels, respectively.  \n\n#### 3.2.3.Talent introductionmechanism  \n\nBased on the endorsement effect exerted by state-owned VC institutions, state-owned VC holds greater appeal to external talents seeking entry into enterprises due to its policy advantages and national standing compared to regular VC entities. The regression findings in columns 5 and 6 of Table 3 indicate that the presence of state-owned VC substantially enhances enterprises' ability to attract innovative talents. The variable representing talent recruitment acts as a partial intermediary in the pathway through which stateowned VC drives enterprise innovation. These results validate that SOvC enhances enterprises’ technological innovation capabilities by drawing in external R&D personnel.  \n\n### 3.3. Endogeneity test  \n\nAs there could be a causal link between SOVC and enterprise innovation, the entry of SOvC institutions may genuinely stimulate enterprise inovation through mechanisms such as alleviating corporate financing constraints, engaging in joint investments, and attracting talents. However, VC institutions might also select investment targets based on the independent innovation capabilities of enterprises. Consequently, this paper's model may encounter endogeneity issues, leading to estimation result biases. To assess the potential impact of endogeneity on this paper's findings, the model is further examined using the Propensity Score Matching Method. Following matching, a total of 6968 samples were obtained from the experimental group and the control group, with Table 4 presenting the balance of the main matching variables.  \n\nThe matched samples underwent regression analysis once more, with the results displayed in the first column of Table 5. Based on the regression outcomes presented in the table, the coefficient associated with the participation of SovC institutions exhibits a notably positive value. This finding validates that investments from SOvC can effectively enhance the innovation capacity of invested enterprises post-matching, affirming the persistence of the hypothesis even after addressing the endogeneity concern discussed in the paper.  \n\n### 3.4. Heterogeneity test  \n\nThe findings presented in the second column of Table 5 indicate that when enterprises are backed by state-owned VC institutions and operate within industries supported by government policies, the interaction terms between state-owned VC institutions and policy support exhibit a notably enhanced impact on the technological innovation capabilities of these enterprises. This outcome validates that if enterprises operate within government-supported industries, state-owned VC institutions play a more potent role in fostering innovation capabilities.  \n\n### 3.5. Robustness test  \n\nIn this paper, the level of innovation investment replaces the count of invention patents, and a robust test is conducted. The regression outcomes of the robustness test outlined in Table 6 indicate that state-owned VC institutions exert a significantly more pronounced impact on the augmentation of enterprise innovation input. This finding substantiates that state-owned VC institutions yield a more substantial effect on enhancing the innovation level of enterprises, thereby affirming the continued validity of the three previously established mechanisms. The results presented in Table 6 validate the robustness of the empirical test findings in this paper.  \n\n## 4. Conclusion  \n\nThe empirical findings of this paper demonstrate that the reform of China's SOC enhances the degree of marketization within SOVC, subsequently leading to a significant enhancement in the innovation capabilities of the recipient enterprises. The three mechanisms through which SOvC fosters the advancement of enterprises? innovation capabilities encompass providing more ample and stable funds to alleviate financing constraints, exerting an \"endorsement\" influence on the invested enterprises to attract additional VC institutions for collaborative investments, and aiding in talent attraction for innovative endeavors. Moreover, the research identifies that the positive impact of sovC on enterprise innovation is particularly pronounced within industries that receive government policysupport.  \n\nTable4 Logit regression results and matching balance table of main variables   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variables</td><td>Category</td><td>Treatmentgroup</td><td>Controlgroup</td><td>%bias</td><td>T-Value</td><td>P-Value</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">CStruct</td><td>Beforematchmaking</td><td>37.1</td><td>44.7</td><td>-37.9</td><td>-21.7</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Aftermatchmaking</td><td>37.1</td><td>43.5</td><td>0.2</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.9</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">LAsset</td><td>Beforematchmaking</td><td>20.8</td><td>21.3</td><td>-30.6</td><td>-17.5</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>After matchmaking</td><td>20.8</td><td>20.8</td><td>2.7</td><td>1.6</td><td>0.1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Grow</td><td>Beforematchmaking</td><td>28.4</td><td>25.0</td><td>1.2</td><td>0.7</td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td>Aftermatchmaking</td><td>28.4</td><td>24.3</td><td>1.5</td><td>0.9</td><td>0.4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">ROE</td><td>Before matchmaking</td><td>11.7</td><td>12.6</td><td>-4.1</td><td>-2.3</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>After matchmaking</td><td>11.7</td><td>12.9</td><td>-3.1</td><td>-1.8</td><td>0.1</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTable5 Endogeneity test and heterogeneity test.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1) LInvent</td><td>(2) LInvent</td></tr><tr><td>VCnature</td><td>0.297*** (10.199)</td><td>0.233*** (6.268)</td></tr><tr><td>VCnature*Gover</td><td></td><td>0.112***</td></tr><tr><td>Constant</td><td>-3.329***</td><td>(7.745) -3.398***</td></tr><tr><td>Controlvariables</td><td>(-4.889) Yes</td><td>(-4.134) Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Fixedeffects</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>6968</td><td>7851</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.124</td><td>0.104</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: Values in parentheses are t-statistics corrected for heteroscedasticity; \\*, \\*\\*, and $***$ denotesignificance atthe $10\\%$ $5\\%$ and $1\\%$ levels,respectively.  \n\nTable 6 Robustness test.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1) RDinput</td><td>(2) LFcash</td><td>(3) RDinput</td><td>(4) Unite</td><td>(5) RDinput</td><td>(6) RDinput</td><td>(7) LRDpeople</td><td>(8) RDinput</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">VCnature</td><td>0.265***</td><td>0.383***</td><td>0.161***</td><td>0.265***</td><td>0.128***</td><td>0.407***</td><td>0.155***</td><td>0.176***</td></tr><tr><td>(25.59)</td><td>(6.526)</td><td>(6.831)</td><td>(25.59)</td><td>(7.037)</td><td>(8.717)</td><td>(4.612)</td><td>(10.187)</td></tr><tr><td>VCnature *LFcash</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.012** (2.027)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">VCnature*Unite</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.107**</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(2.032)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VCnature*LRDpeople</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.017** (2.472)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VCnature*Gover</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.043**</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Constant</td><td>1.366***</td><td>-1.025</td><td>1.028***</td><td>0.153**</td><td>1.235***</td><td>-6.246***</td><td>1.275**</td><td>(2.041) 6.348***</td></tr><tr><td>(4.096)</td><td>(-1.292)</td><td>(3.55)</td><td>(2.464)</td><td>(4.567)</td><td>(-8.693)</td><td>(2.526)</td><td>(5.308)</td></tr><tr><td>Controlvariables</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Fixed effects</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes Yes</td><td>Yes Yes</td><td>Yes Yes</td><td>Yes Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>Yes</td><td>7386</td><td>7386</td><td>7386</td><td>7386</td><td>Yes 1069</td><td>Yes 1069</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>7386 0.025</td><td>0.261</td><td>0.032</td><td>0.149</td><td>0.028</td><td>0.354</td><td>0.033</td><td>6792 0.251</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: Values in parentheses are t-statistics corrected for heteroscedasticity; \\*, \\*\\*, and \\*\\*\\* denote significance at the $10\\%$ $5\\%$ and $1\\%$ levels, respectively.  \n\nThe paper's conclusions yield three significant policy implications. Primarily, the distinction between the nature of VC and the enhancement of enterprise innovation primarily manifests in the marketization level of VC operations. Therefore, endeavors should focus on elevating the marketization level of sovC, enabling it to select investment targets with greater flexibility and precision. Secondly, there should be a concerted effort to leverage the \"endorsement\" role of SovC, utilizing the signal of such investment to assist enterprises in attracting additional financial and talent support. Lastly, when nations employ financial instruments to implement industrial support policies, they may consider integrating financial subsidies with SOC risk investment to enhance the execution efficiency of industrial support policies.  \n\n# CRediT authorship contribution statement  \n\nChenyang Yu: Writing - original draft, Funding acquisition, Formal analysis.

Studies find that survival for VC-backed ventures range from around $65\\%$ (Sahlman 1990) to $85\\%$ of the VC's portfolio (Dorsey 1979). Of those startups that survive, $20\\%$ fail to provide an adequate return to the VC (Ruhnka, Feldman, and Dean 1992). In effect, combining data from various failure studies results in a failure rate (from the VC's perspective) ranging from $35\\%$ to $55\\%$ Dean and Giglierano (1990) suggest that only $42\\%$ of VC-backed firms achieve an Return on Investment (ROI) of $15\\%$ which suggests a failure rate of nearly $60\\%$ . John Hill, a prominent VC in Colorado, says that out of every 10 investments, a VC hopes to hit one “home run\" which often salvages the portfolio's return (Hill 1993). Regardless of what numbers the reader chooses to believe, the data indicate that the VCinvestment decision has ample room for improvement. Thus, this paper asks the question of how can VCs improve their “hit-rate” of successfully funded ventures thereby improving their rate of return?  \n\nUsing Social Judgment Theory (SJT) as a basis, this paper employs real time policy capturing methods common in cognitive psychology to capture the VC's actual decision process, compare the VC's decision process to that of an actuarial model (a decision aide which weights information factors in such a manner as to distinguish between expected success and/or failure among new venture proposals) and determine the potential of actuarial models to improve VC decision-making. The paper proceeds as follows: First, the VC decision process is investigated. Second, the paper looks at how biases and heuristics hinder the decision. Third, the paper discusses the potential for actuarial models to improve the decision by reviewing decision domains where such models have been successful. This section builds a series of testable hypotheses. Finally, the paper discusses the results of the current study.  \n\n![](images/ef5506bcf3f573404d4d03fe8d6926f28a1341c58198c0f166750e4d73675988.jpg)  \nFIGURE 1VC Decision.  \n\n## VENTURE CAPITALIST DECISION-MAKING  \n\nVC firms can be defined as \"those organizations whose predominant mission is to finance the founding or early growth of new companies that do not yet have access to the public securities market or to institutional lenders\" (Gupta and Sapienza 1992:349; Perez 1986; Pratt 1987). As such, Gupta and Sapienza (1992) suggest that VCs add valueby:  \n\n· bringing investors and entrepreneurs together in an efficient manner, · making superior investment decisions than limited partners would make, and · providing non-financial assistance which in turn enhances survival.  \n\nAll other things equal, a VC firm's performance is a function of how well it makes the investment decision and how effective its management advice and services are after the investment decision has been made. In fact, Roure and Keeley (1990) assert that success can be predicted from information contained in the business plan. Therefore, improving the investment decision can improve the VC's performance.  \n\nDecisions can be decomposed into three basic components, (1) consequences, (2) alternatives/options, and (3) uncertainty of action (Behn and Vaupel 1982). The VC investment decision and its basic components are diagrammed in Figure 1. The consequences associated with investment decisions boil down to ROI. If the VC invests in a startup idea, ROI is a function of the new venture's performance. Successful ventures provide a high return, “living dead\" (Ruhnka et al. 1992) and failed ventures result in a loss of all or part of the investment. The basic alternatives or options that the VC has in this decision are to invest or not invest. The invest alternative can be further subdivided into an amount invested. For example, a VC can form a syndicate to spread the risk. However, Figure 1 shows the invest decision without these subdivisions. Finally, the uncertainty of any investment translates into probabilities or likelihood of the possible outcomes which cannot be perfectly known a priori.  \n\nVCs attempt to assess the probability of success or failure by evaluating information surrounding the particular venture. To receive funding, new ventures must past an initial screening (typically a review of the business plan) followed by months of due diligence. A number of researchers have examined what information is critical to the VC's decision (Table 1). A review of this literature suggests that there are four main categories on which VCs base their decision. The four categories can be summarized as (1) entrepreneur/team capabilities, (2) product/service attractiveness, (3) market/competitive conditions, and (4) potential returns if venture is successful (Wells 1974; Poindexter 1976; Tyebjee and Bruno 1984; MacMillan, Seigel, and Subba Narasimha 1985; MacMillan, Zeman, and Subba Narasimha 1987; Robinson 1987; Timmons, Muzyka, Stevenson, and Bygrave1987).  \n\n### IMPEDIMENTS TOOPTIMAL DECISIONMAKING  \n\nIt is well recognized in the decision-making literature that decision makers are not perfectly rational, but boundedly rational (Cyert and March 1963; Newell and Simon 1972; Simon 1955). Biases and heuristics inhibit optimal decisions (e.g., Tversky and Khaneman 1974; Hogarth and Makridakis 1981). The availability bias, for example, may encourage decision makers to recall past successes rather than failures (Dawes 1988; Dawes, Faust, and Meehl 1989). Therefore, a VC is apt to assess the success of a current venture prospect by how similar the current prospect is to a past success. If the venture under consideration uses the same technology, or has the same lead entrepreneur, such available information may bias the VC to overlook other information that suggests the current venture is likely to fail. Likewise, a VC utilizing a satisficing heuristic might reject new venture proposals that fail to meet any one minimum requirement on the VC's list of decision factors, even if all other remaining factors are substantially higher than the minimum requirements. As such, the VC may eliminate potentially profitable investments from further consideration because of a heuristic rule (s)he is using to keep the task manageable. However, considering the number of proposals that VCs review, such time saving tradeoffs may be more cost effective in the long run.  \n\nBiases and heuristics are more prevalent in certain tasks than others (Shanteau 1992). Some aspects of the VC task make it more difficult and susceptible to sub-optimal decision making. First, much of the information is constantly changing. The proverbial \"window of opportunity”' is typically closing or opening, but always fast moving. Second, feedback on the quality of the VC's decision is slow in coming. It generally takes 7 years to identify the portfolio winners, and 2 to 3 years to identify the losers (Timmons 1994). Slow feedback makes it difficult for VCs to adjust their decision processes. Finally, VCs rely on intuitive processes (Dominguez 1974; Khan 1987). As such, the use of decision aids may be rare.  \n\nBiases, heuristics, and a number of difficult task characteristics result in sub-optimal decisions. The decision effectiveness problem sums down to low intra-judge reliability and low inter-judge reliability. VCs are apt to consider each prospective venture as unique thereby recalling differing available information factors from memory resulting in low intra-judge reliability. The salience of certain factors surrounding a decision may unduly bias VCs by encouraging them to pay more attention to certain information factors than is warranted. Thus, VCs are likely to inconsistently apply their own decision criteria, resulting in low intra-judge reliability.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Hall & Hofer (1993) phone survey & (1976) Wells (1974) personal</td><td>16 7</td><td rowspan=\"11\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">xx</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td rowspan=\"7\"></td></tr><tr><td>Timmons et al.

These differences influence the VC's perceptions of the prospective venture (Barr, Stimpert, and Huff 1992). JohnsonLaird notes:  \n\nWe seem to perceive the world directly, not a representation of it. Yet this phenomenology is illusory: what we perceive depends on what is in our heads-on what evolution has “wired\" into our nervous systems and what we know as a result of experience. The limits of our models are the limits of our world (1989:470-471).  \n\nThe fact that each individual perceives the world differently leads to different decisions. Therefore, consistency between decision makers within the same domain may be affected; low inter-judge reliability. The problems with consistency raise the question of whether more consistent decisions would improve the VC's prediction of successful ventures? If so, how can decision consistency be improved?  \n\n### ACTUARIALMODELS  \n\nElstein and Bordage state that “actuarial (statistical) models refer to the use of any formal quantitative techniques or formulas, such as regression analysis, for . . . [deciding] clinical tasks” (1988:123). An actuarial model optimally combines decision cues (relevant information) to derive an answer. Thus, actuarial models decompose decisions into component parts. Just as an insurance actuary statistically derives the payoff risk associated with different groups of people (i.e., age, gender, etc.), actuarial models can assess the probability of certain outcomes based upon information available to the decision.  \n\nActuarial models have received a lot of attention within cognitive psychology (Dawes and Corrigan 1974; Dawes et al. 1989; Duda and Shortliffe 1983; Fischhoff 1988; Goldberg 1968; Slovic 1972). Social Judgment Theory (Brunswik 1956) from cognitive psychology provides a framework for understanding actuarial models. SJT's underlying assumption is that decision makers do not have access to “real\" information, but instead perceive that information through proximal cues (Strong 1992). These cues quantitatively describe the relationship between someone's judgment and the information used to make that judgment (Stewart 1988). As such, SJT also provides a theoretical reference to much of the past research on VC decision criteria (Wells 1974; Poindexter 1976; Tyebjee and Bruno 1984; MacMillan, Seigel and Subba Narasimha 1985; MacMillan, Zeman, and Subba Narasimha 1987; Robinson 1987; Timmons, Muzyka, Stevenson, and Bygrave 1987; Sandberg, Schweiger and Hofer 1988; Hall and Hofer 1993). SJT illustrates how these criteria are decomposed and recombined to reach a decision. Hence, SJT allows the capture of 'theories in use' as opposed to ‘espoused theories’ of action (Hitt and Tyler 1991). Within SJT, human judgments are formally modeled via the lens model.  \n\nThe lens model (Brunswik 1956; Hammond 1977) illustrates the VC investment decision (using the four major categories mentioned earlier) (Figure 2). The information factors link the objective environment (left side of Figure 2) and the assessment of that environment (right side of Figure 2). Specifically, the criterion variable (actual outcome) is linked to the information factors by what decision the VC makes, typically invest or not invest. Regardless of how optimal the VC's decision, the information factors are correlated to the ultimate decision. The judgment variable (expected venture outcome) on the right side of the model represents the VC's assessment of the venture's potential. For example, if the VC views the entrepreneur as a fatal flaw for a particular venture, then the VC would likely expect the venture to fail and not invest in it. Again, the expected outcome is correlated to the information factors. In sum, the actual outcome is linked to the expected outcome via a series of information cues.  \n\n![](images/7d7574a6e0d9be235f9f3f1199384b13858311d8eda4d803e8055fe36b5f57cb.jpg)  \nFIGURE 2 VC Investment Decision.  \n\nUsing the lens model framework, two types of actuarial models can be derived, a bootstrap and an environmental model. Bootstrapping (Dawes and Corrigan 1974; Fischhoff 1988; Slovic 1972) is a method of modeling the information cues that actual judges use. In other words, experts are queried about what information is important to the decision and then that information is used to build a model (this relationship is represented on the right side of Figure 2). As contrasted with the bootstrap model, an environmental actuarial model of the VC investment decision (see the left side of Figure 2) identifies how cues fit the environment. Discriminant or regression analysis (AbdelKhalik and EI-Sheshai 1980; Dawes, et al. 1989) identifies the optimal correlation between the available information factors (cues) and the ultimate venture outcome. Discriminant analysis basically determines which information factors from the environment distinguish between success and failure.  \n\n#### Past Studies of Actuarial Models  \n\nActuarial models have been developed in a number of decision domains and then compared to the intuitive or “clinical” decisions of experts within those domains. Goldberg (1968) extended Meehl's (1959) groundbreaking study on actuarial models. In Goldberg's study, 29 psychologists judged patient psychosis by using information from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). Each psychologist had varying experience with the MMPI. An actuarial model derived from the MMPI instrument predicted patient psychosis correctly about $70\\%$ of the time. The best psychologist, in terms of correct diagnosis, achieved a $67\\%$ accuracy rating. The average for all the psychologists was $62\\%$  \n\nActuarial models have also been tested within the domains of business decision making (e.g. Wright 1979; Abdel-Khalik and El-Sheshai 1980; Lewis, Patton, and Green 1988). In Wright's (1979) study, 47 MBA's from Stanford predicted the percentage change in security prices for 50 common stocks. Second year students achieved an accuracyof $r=0.31\\$ Vs. $r=0.20$ for first year students. In addition, students evidenced low inter-judge reliability. An environmental actuarial model, on the other hand, achieved an accuracy rating of $r=0.59$  \n\nAbdel-Khalik and El-Sheshai (1980) tested the ability of commercial lenders to predict loan defaults. Twenty-eight commercial lenders judged the likelihood of default of 46 firms and achieved an accuracy rating of $62\\%$ . In comparison, an environmental actuarial model was $90\\%$ accurate and a bootstrap model was $67\\%$ accurate. The authors contend that the primary difference in accuracy is a function of cue choice, because the bootstrap model is not statistically different than the lenders. It is possible that the non-statistical difference is a function of the strong theoretical base (i.e., ratios) that lenders use in making loan decisions. In other words, once the lender has chosen which ratios to use in making the loan decision, it is unlikely that the expert lender will misjudge such quantitative information factors.  \n\nIn another development of the actuarial model process, Lewis et al. (1988) examined the ability of 47 municipal financial analysts to determine the change in municipal bond ratings. Using 12 information factors derived from previous studies, the analysts achieved an accuracy rating of approximately $45\\%$ . An environmental model achieved $60\\%$ accuracy, however bootstrap models did not statistically differ from the experts in accuracy. Again, the fact that bootstrap models did not outperform experts may be a function of the decision and the fact that quantifiable numbers and ratios are readily available to the analyst. In decisions that use more subjective information, a bootstrap model may perform better than the expert which it is modeling.  \n\n#### The potential of actuarial models for VC decision making  \n\nIt is interesting to note that many of the prior studies into VC decision criteria that rely on surveys and questionnaires essentially derive the criteria that the experts would include in a bootstrap model (Wells 1974; Poindexter 1976; Tyebjee and Bruno 1984; MacMillan, Seigel, and Subba Narasimha 1985; MacMillan, Zeman, and Subba Narasimha 1987; Robinson 1987; Timmons, Muzyka, Stevenson, and Bygrave 1987). In essence, the questionnaires and surveys yield the cues that experts believe are most important to the decision to accept or reject investing. In other words, a bootstrap model reaches the same conclusion as an expert since it uses the same information as the expert. However, past research finds that bootstrap models perform better than experts because themodels:  \n\n· are consistent (experts are subject to random fluctuations);   \n· are not biased by a non-random sample; and optimally weigh information factors (Dawes et al. 1989; Fischhoff 1988; Slovic and Lichtenstein 1971; Slovic 1972).  \n\nGiven the forgoing reasoning, Hypothesis 1 suggests that a bootstrap actuarial model (one based upon the information that VCs deem most important to the investment decision) outperforms the VCs themselves:  \n\nH1: A bootstrap actuarial model of the VC's decision process better predicts actual outcomes than the VC's own intuitive decision process.  \n\nPast research also shows that environmental actuarial models perform better than experts for the same reasons that bootstrap models outperform experts. Additionally, environmental models use only predictive variables and disregard non-predictive ones (Dawes et al. 1989). Unlike human experts, environmental actuarial models don't develop distorted beliefs about variable relationships. Therefore, environmental actuarial models should achieve the highest accuracy rate in selecting successful ventures.  \n\nRoure and Keeley (1990) developed an environmental actuarial model for venture capital decision making. Examining business plans from 36 high tech enterprises, Roure and Keeley identified four factors that best distinguished between venture success and failure (team completeness, technical superiority of product, expected time for product development, and buyer concentration) for the firms in their sample. The researchers suggest that their model can be used to screen for successful ventures (Roure and Keeley 1990). Based upon the findings from other decision domains and Roure and Keeley's environmental model, Hypothesis 2 states:  \n\n$H2$ : An environmental actuarial model of the decision process better predicts actual outcomes than the VC's intuitive prediction.  \n\nIn a perfectly rationalideal world where the VC would use valid cues as determined by accurate statistical analyses of the environment and where the VC weighed the cues correctly, the correlations on the task (left) and cognitive (right) sides of the lens model (see Figure 2) would be equivalent. However, the probability of this perfectly correlated scenario is unrealistic. Instead, an environmental actuarial model using the task cue factors is more likely to predict the correct outcome than a bootstrap actuarial model using cognitive cue factors. As such, an environmental model should better predict venture outcome than a bootstrap model. Thus, Hypothesis 3 suggests:  \n\nH3: An environmental modelof the decision process better predicts actual outcomes than a bootstrap model.  \n\nOskamp (1982) finds that experts have greater confidence in their decisions when more information is available for analysis. In other words, VCs exposed to more information are apt to believe that they make better predictions than either of the two actuarial models or their peers who have less information with which to make the decision. But, Oskamp argues that the expert's increased confidence is unfounded. With more information, the accuracy of their decision remains unchanged (Castellan 1977; Elstein and Bordage 1988; Oskamp 1982) and may even decrease (Arkes 1981). Part of the reason that VC accuracy is not greatly improved with more information is that experts, despite their beliefs, use relatively few available cues (Brehmer and Brehmer 1988). Therefore, VC's tend to mistakenly believe that they are making a more informed decision with a greater amount of information even though they are likely ignoring the additional information or using it inappropriately. More information leads not to improved decision accuracy, just increased confidence. Given the foregoing reasoning, Hypothesis 4a is derived:  \n\nH4a: The VC's intuitive prediction of success does not improve even if (s)he has more decision factors to consider.  \n\nIf, as Hypothesis 4a posits, more information does not lead to improved decision accuracy, both the bootstrap and environmental actuarial models should still outperform those VCs who have access to more information.  \n\nH4b: A bootstrap model outperforms VC's who have access to more decision factors.  \n\nH4c: An environmental model outperforms VC's who have access to more decisionfactors.  \n\nActuarial models have proven to be robust. In a meta-analysis, only 6 of 117 studies found that clinical or intuitive decision making equaled or outperformed actuarial models (Grove 1986). Therefore, it appears that actuarial models may be useful tools for improving VC decision making.  \n\n## METHOD  \n\nThe main hypotheses propose that VC decisions are less accurate then those of bootstrap or environmental actuarial models. In this study, therefore, the VCs’ decisions are compared to the predictions of the actuarial models on 25 actual ventures that have subsequently achieved some outcome—either success or failure. The VCs receive several pieces of information about each potential investment. The actuarial models (regression equations) use the same information cues as the VCs. The exercise requests that the participants evaluate the ventures as they would during the initial screening stage of an actual decision and judge whether the venture will likely succeed or fail. Thus, the VCs were asked to rate on a seven point Likert Scale, the potential of each venture to succeed of fail. Coding ofthe VC response to success or failure was conducted as follows: 5 to 7 (success probability is high), 4 (VC is unsure or doesn't know), 1 to 3 (failure probability is high). The hit-rate—-number of correct decisions as compared to the actual outcome of the venture—is recorded for both the VCs and each actuarial model. Additionally, VCs participated in one of three treatments that varied the amount and type of information that they could use to make the decision. The hit-rate of VCs is compared across treatments.  \n\n### Decision Experiment  \n\nThe experiment was administered on a notebook PC brought to the VC's office; such convenience likely increased participation. Policy capturing experiments enable control and are conducive to quantitative statistical tests (i.e., Regression and ANOVA).  \n\n### Sample  \n\nThe sample for this experiment was 53 practicing VCs from two entrepreneurial “hotbeds,” (1) the Colorado Front Range (primarily the Denver/Boulder metro area) and (2) the Silicon Valley in California. Two of the 53 participants were removed (one because the PC crashed during the exercise and the other because he did not wish to continue past the first few decisions). Table 2 further delineates the demographics of the sample.  \n\nTABLE 2VC Demographics   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"6\">VC Firm Level Demographics</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\"></td></tr><tr><td>Variable</td><td></td><td>Description</td><td>Range</td><td>Mean</td><td>Deviation</td></tr><tr><td>Stage of</td><td>Percentage</td><td>Seed</td><td>0-100</td><td>21.6</td><td>21.214</td></tr><tr><td>investment</td><td></td><td>Start-up</td><td>0-100</td><td>35.7</td><td>21.926</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Early growth</td><td>0-60</td><td>22.8</td><td>15.324</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Expansion</td><td>0-60</td><td>18.5</td><td>17.809</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Decline</td><td>0-40</td><td>1.5</td><td>6.136</td></tr><tr><td>Size of VC firm</td><td>Dollars under investment control (in millions)</td><td></td><td>1-2000</td><td>202.9</td><td>316.196</td></tr><tr><td>Age of firm</td><td>Years since founding FT equivalents actively involved inventure</td><td></td><td>1-32</td><td>14.0</td><td>7.890</td></tr><tr><td>Number of associates</td><td>funding decisions</td><td></td><td>1-35</td><td>5.4</td><td>5.033</td></tr><tr><td>Industry requirements</td><td>versuslowtechnology</td><td>Percentage of portfolio in high technology</td><td>0-100</td><td>81.4</td><td>24.977</td></tr><tr><td>Geographic focus</td><td>State (1); regional (2); national (3) international (4); none (5)</td><td></td><td>1-4</td><td>2.4</td><td>0.753</td></tr><tr><td>Average funding per venture</td><td>Dollar amount (in thousands)</td><td></td><td>50-50,000</td><td>3304.6</td><td>7031.198</td></tr><tr><td>Type of VC firm</td><td>Independent/private, bank affiliated corporation affiliated, non-affiliated SBIC</td><td colspan=\"3\">All Independent</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Average number of investors per venture</td><td>0, 1-3, 4-5, >5</td><td></td><td>0->5</td><td>2.5</td><td>1.525</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\">Individual VC Demographics</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>Measured in years</td><td></td><td>29-72</td><td>46.5</td><td>10.366</td></tr><tr><td>Gender</td><td></td><td></td><td>50 males 3 females</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Education level</td><td>Years of education with a high school graduate = 12; 4 yr college degree = 16,</td><td></td><td>14-22</td><td>17.8</td><td>0.977</td></tr><tr><td>Education type</td><td>etc.; college, graduate, etc. Business</td><td></td><td>44</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>(number of VCs</td><td>Engineering</td><td></td><td>23</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>with degree in</td><td>Liberal Arts</td><td></td><td>17</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>field)</td><td>Science</td><td></td><td>8</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Tenure with firm</td><td>Number of years with current firm</td><td></td><td>1-25</td><td>8.7</td><td>6.104</td></tr><tr><td>Other VC experience</td><td>Years</td><td></td><td>0-19</td><td>2.3</td><td>4.239</td></tr><tr><td>Other relevant experience</td><td>Number of years working (including years as VC)</td><td></td><td>5-49</td><td>22.5</td><td>10.341</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n### Procedure  \n\nThe experiment follows a two step creation process; (1) identify information cues (decision variables) that are valuable to the investment decision and (2) create decision scenarios for the VC to judge. The number of scenarios and cues is interrelated (Stewart 1988). The more scenarios each participant completes, the higher the validity of the captured judgment policy. Unfortunately, too many scenarios may tire the judge and limit participation. Stewart (1988) suggests that 35 scenarios is typically suffcient to accurately capture the subject's decision policy. Another rule of thumb is to have a minimum of five scenarios for every cue that is being tested (Stewart 1991).  \n\nA policy capturing exercise that uses all the identified information factors from previous research would be untenable (see Table 1, approximately 25 cues in aggregate form). To achieve an appropriate scenario-to-cue ratio, the VCs would have to evaluate over 100 scenarios (5 cases/cue $\\ast25$ cues $=125$ ). Evaluating 100 scenarios would increase the required time to complete the exercise, might reduce participation, or tire each participant, thereby reducing the experiment's validity. Additionally, such an increased time requirement might discourage VCs from participating in the exercise altogether. Furthermore, several of the identified cues are probably highly correlated with each other. High multicolinearity adversely affects policy capturing experiments (Stewart 1988). Finally, most people, including experts, typically use only three to seven information cues (Stewart 1988), so a smaller set of cues is valid. For the above reasons, the number of cues used in the exercise in a subset of all possible cues.  \n\nBefore scenarios can be constructed, relevant information cues must be identified. In order to use a manageable set of cues, cue frequency across studies and reported importance within each study are used as a criterion for the inclusion of a particular cue in the experiment. Additionally, cues that are highly correlated with other cues are removed (Lewis, Patton, and Green 1988) retaining the cue that is deemed most important in the literature. A consulting expert VC also verified that the retained cue was valid and important. Although the list is not exhaustive, it is more probable that the identified cues in this study include unimportant factors rather than exclude important factors. This outcome is due to the fact that experts typically identify far more cues than they actually use (Stewart 1988).  \n\nDecision scenarios were created once the pertinent cues had been identified. Cooperative VCs outside the sample of the study (primarily VCs based in Chicago and the East Coast) provided actual investment decision scenarios. A stipulation for using the actual cases was that the entrepreneur, venture, and any associated firms or individuals remain unidentified. Such a provision does not impede this study in any way. In fact, identifying the venture or entrepreneur might bias the participant's decisions. For example, personal knowledge of an entrepreneur's reputation might lead the subjects to judge that case without fully evaluating other supplied information. Products also are not identified, because many of the actual ventures included products identified with unique firms. Moreover, identifying the product might also narrow the available sample size. A VC may be hesitant to make a decision about a biotechnology firm if (s)he specializes in computer disk storage. Although a proposed venture may not fit a particular VC firm's investment criteria, VCs within those firms often screen such ventures and, if they have potential, refer them to an more suitable VC. For the same reasons, financial cues are not included in this experiment. Different VCs use different hurdle rates. This experiment focuses on the screening stage, therefore, it is appropriate to minimize any preset biases regarding unique firm investment criteria (i.e., industry, etc.).  \n\nValue ranges given to each cue allow it to be compared across scenarios (Stewart 1988). Concrete values are used (e.g., market size) for cue values when possible, but purely representative distributions are appropriate for subjective cues (Stewart 1988). A uniform coding system for subjective information factors allows consistent coding across the business plans used in building the experiment. For instance, the subjective information factors within the Cognitive Cue Treatments were rated on a five-point scale. For example, the proprietary product cue value rated from 1 (lowest protection) to 5 (highest protection). Likewise, competitor strength was also rated on a five-point scale. Within the Task Cue Treatment, Roure and Keeley's (1990) subjective rating scale wasused.  \n\nTABLE 3MANOVA Results betweenActual and Generated Cases   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variable</td><td colspan=\"2\">Cochran's C</td></tr><tr><td>Marketfamiliarity</td><td colspan=\"2\">p = 0.173</td></tr><tr><td>Leadership ability</td><td colspan=\"2\">p = 0.813</td></tr><tr><td>Start-uprecord</td><td colspan=\"2\">p = 0.817 p = 0.154</td></tr><tr><td>Team completeness</td><td colspan=\"2\">p= 0.152 = 0.854 p = 0.857</td></tr><tr><td>Proprietary protection</td><td colspan=\"2\">p：</td></tr><tr><td>Product superiority</td><td colspan=\"2\">p = 0.945 p = 0.946</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">P = 0.817 p = 0.821</td></tr><tr><td>Time to development</td><td colspan=\"2\">P = 0.762 p = 0.774</td></tr><tr><td>Market size</td><td colspan=\"2\">P = 0.123 p =0.142</td></tr><tr><td>Market growth</td><td colspan=\"2\">P 0.813 p = 0.817</td></tr><tr><td>Direct competitors</td><td colspan=\"2\">p = 0.369 p = 0.382</td></tr><tr><td>Competitor strength</td><td colspan=\"2\">p = 0.274</td></tr><tr><td>Buyer's concentration</td><td colspan=\"2\">p = 0.499</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"4\">Multivariate tests of significance</td><td>Pillais 0.731</td><td rowspan=\"4\"></td></tr><tr><td>Hotellings 0.731 0.731</td></tr><tr><td>Wilks</td></tr><tr><td>Box's M 0.367 Wilks 0.353</td></tr><tr><td>Multivariate tests of homogeneity</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThe lead researcher pulled information factors from the business plans of the actual cases. Although there is a potential threat that the information included in the plan is inaccurate (which would carry over into the experiment), Roure and Keeley (1990) find that VCs rarely need to make “intense” corrections. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the business plans are accurate enough for this study. To insure inter-judge reliability, a colleague unfamiliar with the business plans or their outcomes also coded all appropriate cues. The lead researcher provided the second coder with the entire list and description of the information factors of interest. Overall inter-judge reliability equates to $87.5\\%$ . Berelson (1952) reports that inter-judge reliability typically ranges from $66\\%$ to $95\\%$ . As such, the coding is deemed fairly reliable.  \n\nA technique to further decrease multicolinearity while maintaining strong external validity is to combine actual and statistically derived cases. A random case generator from Policy PC software package (Stewart 1991) creates a manageable number of statistically derived cases. MANOVA verifies that the statistical cases are from the same population as the actual cases (see Table 3). The IVs have equal variance between real and generated cases and the multivariate means are equivalent. Furthermore, a consulting expert VC identified those cases that were not feasible (i.e., combination of cue values that rarely occurs in reality). Unfeasible scenarios were dropped from the sample of potential candidates.  \n\nThe final design allowed the VCs to use four to eight cues (depending upon the treatment) and judge 50 cases. The independent variables are the decision cues available within each treatment. The dependent variable is the VCs assessment of how likely the venture is to succeed as measured on a seven point Likert Scale. The participants are divided into three groups (see Table 4). Group one uses the information cues associated with a base cognitive model as derived from the literature reviewed (see Table 4). The cues are from studies (primarily Tyebjee and Bruno 1984; MacMillan et al. 1985, 1987; Robinson 1987; Timmons et al. 1987) which rely on post hoc methods. Thus, these studies basically rely on introspection by the VC as to what are the most important decision factors. Group two uses more cues than either the first or third groups to assess whether more information changes the decision process (see Table 4). Specifically, group two cues include the five used by group one VCs plus three more commonly cited from the literature. Groups one and two use cues corresponding to the cognitive side of the lens model (see Figure 2). Group three uses the information factors that best distinguish between successful and failed new ventures; these cues correspond to the task side of the lens model (see Figure 2). The group 3 treatment uses task cues derived by Roure and Keeley (1990). The regression equation for each of the three possible treatments is asfollows:  \n\nTABLE 4 Experiment Treatment Variables   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Base Cognitive Cues (Treatment 1)</td><td>Additional Cognitive Cues (Treatment 2)</td><td>Task Cues (Treatment 3)</td></tr><tr><td>1.Market familiarity—average number of years of experi- enceinmarket/industryfor team</td><td>Same five cues as base cognitive cues treatment plus: 6.Relevant track record number of past start-up</td><td>1.

The bootstrap actuarial model used the eight decision cues that VCs in the Additional Cognitive Cues Treatment used. The bootstrap actuarial model equally weighted the eight cues.

Note that each information factor is labeled. There is a numeric representation of the cue value as well as a visual bar chart of how that cue in the presented scenario relates to its respective cue in all the other scenarios.  \n\n## RESULTS  \n\nBefore launching into the results related to the hypotheses, we note that VCs within the three treatments achieved different accuracy rates (see Table 5). The next section discusses these results further as they relate to each of the hypotheses.  \n\nHypothesis 1, which posits that an equal weighted bootstrap actuarial model (one that uses the same cues that VCs believe to be important) better predicts actual outcome than the VC, receives support. The standardized bootstrap equal weighted actuarial model is as follows:  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}&{z_{Y}=({\\mathrm{mktfam}})+({\\mathrm{lead}})+({\\mathrm{proprietary}})+({\\mathrm{mktsize}})+({\\mathrm{mktgrw}})+({\\mathrm{start}}{\\mathrm{-up}})}\\ &{\\qquad-({\\mathrm{competitor}})-({\\mathrm{strength}})}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nwhere:  \n\n${\\bf Z}_{Y}=$ standardized prediction of success other variables are standardized cue values for each scenario.  \n\nThe bootstrap actuarial model achieved a hit-rate of $60\\%$ whereas VCs hit-rates were significantly lower $39.5\\%$ in the bootstrap cues treatment, $30.9\\%$ in the additional cues treatment, and $17.1\\%$ in the environmental cues treatment [see Table 5]). One of the $20\\mathrm{VCs}$ in the bootstrap cues treatment achieved a hit-rate of $60\\%$ which suggests that (s)he performed as well as the bootstrap actuarial model. None of the VCs in either the additional cues treatment ( $\\mathit{\\Omega}_{n}=17\\$ ) or environmental cues treatment $(n=14)$ matched the success of the bootstrap actuarial model. Thus, Hypothesis 1 is supported; a bootstrap model better predicts outcome than the expert VC.  \n\nHypothesis 2, which posits that an environmental actuarial model will outperform expert VCs, receives mixed support. The current study uses Roure and Keeley's (1990) environmental actuarial model as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{I R R=-486.27+2.91(\\mathrm{complete})+24.63(\\mathrm{product})+183.96(\\mathrm{buyer})}\\ {-32.30(\\mathrm{buyer})^{2}+15.88(\\mathrm{devtime})-0.78(\\mathrm{devtime})}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere:  \n\n$I R R=$ Internal Rate of Return expected from investment   \ncomplete $=$ degree of team completeness   \nproduct $=$ product's superiority over existing offerings   \ndevtime $=$ months from funding until product is ready to go buyer $=$ number of potential customers for the product.  \n\nRoure and Keeley's model achieved a hit-rate of $40\\%$ (see Table 5) which is approximately equal to those VCs in the bootstrap cues scenario $(39.5\\%)$ . However, the environmental actuarial model beat the mean hit-rate of those VCs in the additional cues scenario $(30.9\\%)$ and those in the environmental cues scenario $(17.1\\%$ [see Table 5]). Thus, Hypothesis 2 receives mixed support.  \n\nHypothesis 3, which suggests that an environmental model will outperform a bootstrap model, does not receive support. The Roure and Keeley (1990) environmental model achieved a  hit-rate  of $40\\%$ , whereas the equal weighted bootstrap model achieved a hit-rate of $60\\%$  \n\nHypothesis 4a, which asserts that VC prediction success does not improve with additional information, receives support. Decision accuracy decreased the more information that the VC had available to make the decision-from $39.5\\%$ in the bootstrap cues treatment to $30.9\\%$ in the additional cues treatment (see Table 5). Additionally, VCs who had more information were more likely to reject a proposal ( $44\\%$ rejections to $40.5\\%$ in bootstrap cues treatment) or be unsure (i.e., select “don't know\" $19.3\\%$ to $16.5\\%$ in bootstrap cues treatment). As such, VCs in the additional cues treatment selected $36.7\\%$ of the cases as likely successes, whereas VCs in the bootstrap cues treatment selected $43\\%$ as likely successes.  \n\nHypothesis 4b, which suggests that the bootstrap model will outperform even those VCs with additional information, receives support. The equal weighted bootstrap model achieved a hit-rate of $60\\%$ whereas VCs in the additional information scenario achieved a mean rate of $30.9\\%$ (see Table 5). Moreover, no VCs in the additional cues treatment $(n=17)$ matched or beat the bootstrap model. The best VCs in this treatment achieved $45\\%$ correct classification rate.  \n\nHypothesis 4c, which posits that an environmental actuarial model will outperform VCs with additional information, also receives support. The Roure and Keeley (1990)  \n\nenvironmental actuarial model achieved a hit-rate of $40\\%$ whereas the VCs within the additional cues treatment achieved a hit-rate of $30.9\\%$ (see Table 5). However, in this case, 4 out of $17\\mathrm{VCs}$ equaled the environmental model and 1 of 17 beat ( $45\\%$ correct) the environmental model.  \n\nThe results of the hypotheses support most of the relationships proposed in this study.  \n\n## DISCUSSION  \n\nIn general, the results indicate that more information appears to hinder the VC's decision process, even though most people prefer more information when making complex decisions. This study also demonstrates that VC decision making can be improved through the aid of actuarial models, especially in information laden environments. Even though this experiment used a generic bootstrap and environmental actuarial models, these aids had significantly higher hit rates than the participating VCs across all treatments. Although the expert VC's intuition is valuable, it often is biased resulting in suboptimal decisions, especially when more information surrounds the decision. Furthermore, the results imply that as more information is available to the decision, the VCs' predictive accuracy substantially decreases. Even though the experiment dramatically reduces the information surrounding an actual situation, an increase in the available information (from five to eight information factors) results in a decrease in prediction accuracyof almost $9\\%$ (from $39.5\\%$ correctto $30.9\\%$ correct). The decreased decision efficiency has several potential explanations, including cognitive overload and “story\" incoherence (Pennington and Hastie 1986). As more information becomes available, it is more difficult for the decision maker to interpret each piece of information, let alone how that information impacts other factors. Thus, it is cognitively harder to create a story Or scenario where the venture will succeed. Story incoherence usually results in a negative interpretation of a situation (Pennington and Hastie 1986). Therefore,identifying the most important criteria, and removing the noise caused by all the other information surrounding the decision may improve the decision process. Actuarial models remove VC biases by ignoring salient information surrounding a particular venture decision. Thus, VCs become more consistent in their decision making (improved intra-judge reliability). Additionally, if VCs within the same organization use the same actuarial model, consistency across VCs within the firm also increases (improved inter-judge reliability).  \n\nMore information also appears to affect whether VCs judge a venture as potentially successful or not. It seems that VCs with more information are less likely to view a venture as potentially successful ( $37\\%$ Vs. $43\\%$ within the base treatment). Such a failure bias may suggest that VCs are employing a “satisficing” heuristic in their decision making (Simon 1955) where the plan must meet a minimum level on each criteria or be rejected. With additional information, there is an increased likelihood that a venture will fail on one information factor and be eliminated from further consideration. Poor standing on one criteria may become salient and bias the VC. The critical question is whether weakness on one criteria negates an otherwise sound investment? The answer is likely dependent upon the relative importance of that criteria. Actuarial models can eliminate the noise by isolating those factors that are most central to the decision. Thus, actuarial models may potentially improve the VC's successful “hit-rate\".  \n\nIf actuarial models can improve decision consistency, the implications for practicing VCs are obvious. Such models may improve the hit-rate of successful ventures, thereby improving the VC's return. These decision aids appear under used in this industry, however VCs are particularly well suited to develop such aids. In follow-up interviews, it was found that only $24\\%$ of the participating VCs use some sort of factor checklist (a document or tool where the VC identifies how each venture proposal measures up to key criteria). Checklists provide a basis for VCs within the firm to evaluate the lead VCs analysis and by extension, examine whether the VC is biased by certain salient factors. Over time as certain funded ventures succeed and others fail, checklists allow VCs to assess the validity of their decision criteria and make corrections. In fact, several of those VCs that use a checklist did so after they made an investment decision. In other words, the VC made the decision on an intuitive basis and then after the firm was funded, the VC went back and completed the checklist. Such a history of investment decisions allowsVCs tolearnwhat works and what doesn't.However,if theVC neverformalizes the decision process, it is much more difficult to discern the critical factors, especially considering post hoc recall and rationalization biases.  \n\nSecond, VCs face a plethora of information when making an investment decision (i.e., business plan, outside consultants, due diligence, etc.). It may be difficult for VCs to truly understand their intuitive decision because of all the noise caused by this information overload. This lack of systematic understanding impedes learning. VCs cannot make accurate adjustments to their evaluation process if they do not truly understand it. Therefore, VCs may suffer from a systematic bias that impedes the performance of their investment portfolio. The method used in this experiment can be modified and used as a training tool to assist active VCs in understanding their intuitive process.  \n\nThe basic conclusion of this paper is that actuarial models can improve VC decision making and by extension, VC returns. Improving the return enhances the VC's ability to solicit investors into his/her next investment portfolio. Developing a successful actuarial model may provide VC's with a competitive advantage. However, actuarial models aren't panaceas.  \n\nThe use of actuarial models, as with any information processing device (i.e., computer), can be hazardous. The old saying “garbage in, garbage out\" applies to actuarial models as well. Therefore, VCs must assess the quality of the information going into the model. For example, if the VC believes that start-up experience is a crucial component of the model, (s)he would be well advised to assess the quality of those start-up experiences. Were the prior start-ups successful? If not, what were the problems? If not, was it still a valuable learning experience? Why did the entrepreneur leave the successful start-up?, etc. On the basis of such questions, the VC can assess the quantitative value of start-up experience and determine the best way to input it into the actuarial model.  \n\nAlthough VCs should be wary of the information input into the model, there is a very real danger that VCs will over analyze such information and possibly invalidate the results. In a classic study, Goldberg (1968) finds that experts (clinical psychologists judging psychosis) who use actuarial models as one more input into the decision process often override the model's conclusion. They identify “broken legs” or exceptions (Meehl 1954) that invalidate the model's conclusion, or so they believe. However, Goldberg finds that the model achieves higher accuracy in isolation than those experts who use the model as one more source of analysis. Therefore, VCs should exercise caution interpreting the model's prediction, as well as modifying data going into the model.  \n\nAlthough actuarial models have been shown to improve expert decision making, the models have not been widely adopted by experts. There is an underlying distrust of “machine” that inhibits adoption of such techniques across a wider array of fields (Holt 1986). A common explanation of this reluctance is that actuarial models remove responsibility for the decision (Hastie 1994). Although a model might be able to predict psychosis, does the psychologist want to take responsibility if the model is wrong? Or would the psychologist feel better if (s)he made that final decision even if there is potential for more mistakes? In today's litigious society, one has to wonder if malpractice insurance would cover the misdiagnosis of an actuarial model. Such questions pose an interesting quandary that may explain the low usage of such models and the tendency to identify “broken legs” or exceptions that invalidate the model.  \n\nRecognizing the reluctance to use such models, it seems that the most appropriate place within the VC decision process would be at the initial plan screening process. The actuarial model quickly focuses attention on the critical issues thereby saving the VCs time and reducing the possibility that “high potential' plans are prematurely discarded and that “low potential\" plans are needlessly passed on to the next level of analysis. Such use of the actuarial model also does not remove the VC's control or responsibility over the decision. The VC can still look for exceptions if (s)he disagrees with the model, but the VC should be cognizant of Goldberg's (1968) findings.  \n\n### INTERPRETING RESULTS OF POLICY CAPTURING EXPERIMENTS  \n\nAlthough policy capturing allows real time, unbiased capture of VC decisions, it does have some short-falls. As with any experiment, the issue of reductionism must be considered. The subjects are exposed to a decision situation which does not perfectly mirror the \"real-life” decision. Such “paper tests\"” affect the external validity of many lens model experiments (Brehmer and Brehmer 1988; Strong 1992). Nevertheless, policy capturing experiments are a valid method for deriving what information decision makers actually use (Stewart 1993). Although such “paper\"” experiments have been criticized, Brown (1972) finds that under even the most contrived cases, the decisions reflect actual decisions. Moreover, since the VC decision has a large “paper” component in the real world (i.e., much of the VC's information comes from business plans), correlation between the experimental task and the “real world\" decision should be even higher.  \n\nThe $40\\%$ hit-rate for the environmental actuarial model causes concern. Ideally, an environmental cue set is the optimal set of factors for distinguishing between successes and failures. Unfortunately, the Roure and Keeley (1990) model is not optimal for the cases within this experiment. Therefore, it appears that there may not be a universal set of predictor variables, or that the case set used to derive Roure and Keeley's $(n=36)$ o, is not large enough to derive a universal environmental model. In all likelihood, there is not a universal model, but it is likely that each individual firm can benefit by developing a model that is suited to its investment criteria.  \n\nIt was surprising that the VCs in the environmental cue treatment performed so poorly. An obvious explanation may be that the predictor cues are not the optimal predictors. A second explanation may be the nature of the cues. To an even greater extent than cues in the other treatments, the environmental cues are very condensed and quantitative. For example, instead of describing entrepreneur and team qualifications, the environmental cue of team completeness provides the percentage of filled key positions at the time of funding. Although such a cue is undoubtedly correlated with team quality and ability, VCs view the cues as intuitively unappealing; the cues are condensing too many key elements. Likewise, buyer concentration seems to be a poor intuitive proxy for market potential. As such, VCs may be unsure of how to interpret these cues which, in turn, makes them more likely to predict venture failure than VCs in the other treatments (56 vs. $44\\%$ for VCs in additional cues treatment and $41\\%$ for VCs in bootstrap cuestreatment).  \n\nAnother limitation is a history effect on the cases used in the study. It typically takes 5 to 7 years for a VC to realize a return on a new venture investment (Timmons 1994). During that time, many things can change which ultimately infuence the venture's success. Some examples include new team members, a revised product/service, changing technology, and shift in market demand. Steier and Greenwood's (1995) indepth case study of one new venture funded by a network of VCs suggests that the firm's ultimate demise was a function of poor coordination and a lack of timely follow-up funding by the VCs, not any inherent weakness in the business concept. Although one may question Steier and Greenwood's conclusion, the point is that anyone of these changes can either positively or negatively affect the venture's success. Therefore, VCs in the experiment (as well as in reality), are making decisions about a venture that may be substantially different in a short matter of time. Moreover, it is unclear what leads to the ultimate success/failure of the included cases. When asked, VCs providing the cases were vague. Typically, they asserted the success/failure to a good/bad decision, strong/ weak management, good/poor understanding of the marketplace, etc. Thus, it would not appear that any large history effects are occurring. However, it is probable that a certain degree of history did help or hinder the firms used as cases. Such an effect not only hinders the VC's decision, but also the prediction ability of an actuarial model. Nevertheless, Roure and Keeley (1990) assert that initial actions and strategies have the largest impact on ultimate outcome. As such, the plans used as cases in this study are valid. These strategies are likely contained in the business plan, therefore, the business plan is a valid tool to make the decision.  \n\nThe experiment also forces VCs to make decisions based upon the presented cues. In reality, VCs would (1) have access to a multitude of possible information cues and (2) use interactive due diligence and other methods to clarify and assess reliability of chosen cues. A common theme in the follow up interviews is that VCs prefer to reserve final judgment until they have a chance to meet with the lead entrepreneur. VCs want a chance to “see if they can work with the guy.\" In essence, meeting with the entrepreneur adds more data points. If, however, meeting with the entrepreneur and other interactive processes add more information, it is not necessarily going to improve the decision (Oskamp 1982). Such meetings might add to the information overload that affects information use and leads to sub-optimal decisions as illustrated in the experiment. Moreover, meeting the entrepreneur adds a number of new biases that might impede the overall decision, such as “first impression\" biases (Borman 1991) or “personal appearance\" biases (Borman 1991). However, if interaction improves the reliability of the cues, then it should improve the decision.  \n\n## FUTURE RESEARCH  \n\nThere are a number of possible extensions to the current study. In follow-up interviews, the participating VCs suggested that their decision style was much less formal than their  \n\nEast Coast peers. An interesting question is whether there is a difference and does it lead to different decisions? Another question is how do VCs compare to Angels and other new venture investors? New samples might address these questions.  \n\nAlthough the current study finds that actuarial models outperform experts, the accuracy of the model is substandard ( $60\\%$ correct). It appears that actuarial models need to be geared towards a firm's specific criteria (i.e., stage, industry, etc.). Thus, a longitudinal relationship with a few VCs could lead to firm specific bootstrap actuarial models based upon the needs and beliefs of the VCs within that firm. After several iterations, it would be interesting to see if the model agrees with the assessment of the VC evaluating the various plans that the firm receives. Over a number of years, a quality bootstrap model would ideally be developed and incorporated into the firm's decision process. At that point in time, it would be interesting to see how the VCs use the tool: Do they frequently override its prediction? How much is the information input into the model modified? and a number of other questions surrounding its use. In sum, actuarial models have the potential of increasing the efficiency of the VC investment market, and it is hoped that this study will spur efforts to create such decision aids.  \n\n## REFERENCES  \n\nAbdel-Khalik, A.R., and El-Sheshai, K.M. 1980.

The structural model also allows us to study the impacts of GVCs on the post-investment performance of the funded companies. Using China's VC market data between 2000 and 2020, we find that GVC-funded companies are those neglected by PVCs, and the potential economic performance of GVC-funded companies is inferior to that of PvC-funded ones. It means that the data do not support the crowding out conjecture. Moreover, the evidence suggests that the potential innovativeness of GvC-funded companies is higher than that of PVC-funded companies, indicating that GVCs bridge the equity gap left by PVCs in innovative companies. Regarding the impacts on companies’ postinvestment performance, GVCs are not significantly different from PVCs in improving companies’ economic performance, and they are better than PvCs in improving companies’ innovative performance. We also explore the impacts of different types of GVCs, the impacts of the coinvestment between GVCs and PVCs, and the impacts of GVCs on companies in different stages of development.  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nGovernments around the world are strongly interested in financing entrepreneurial ventures to encourage innovation. For instance, $20\\%-30\\%$ of companies? incremental capital in the past decade was raised by government agencies in EU countries (Invest Europe, 2017, 2019). According to Bai et al. (2022)'s statistics, between 2010 and 2019 national governments entrepreneurial finance programs around the world had an annual budget of $\\$156$ billion on average, and the trend was manifested most dramatically in the months after the onset of the CovID crisis.  \n\nMeanwhile, the debates on the appropriateness of government investment have never decreased. Many scholars and practitioners are concerned that government-funded companies underperform against their privately funded peers on most outcome measures (Grilli and Murtinu, 2014; Suchard et al., 2021). However, a growing number of scholars have noted that government investment might be still worthwhile even if government-funded companies are less successful than private-funded companies (Brander et al., 2010). They point out that the original purpose of government investment is to fund those companies neglected by private investment due to low expected economic returns; thus government investment is supposed to complement rather than displace private investment, otherwise private investment would be crowded out of the market (Gans and Stern, 2003; Brander et al., 2010; Grilli and Murtinu, 2015). To comprehensively evaluate the appropriateness of government investment, it is crucial to simultaneously examine the postinvestment performance of funded companies and the potential impact of government investment on crowding out private investment (Brander et al., 2015; Alperovych et al., 2020).  \n\nThis study aims to contribute to this stream of work by focusing on one key type of government investment vehicle, i.e., government venture capital firms (GVCs). GVCs are owned by governments, and they invest directly in innovative companies.1 The public good nature of innovation and severe information asymmetry between the potential investors and the entrepreneurs of innovative companies may lead to market failure, which causes an undersupply of funding from economic-return-driven private venture capital firms (PVCs) (Brander et al., 2015). GVCs are intended to invest in those companies neglected by PVCs, and ultimately enhance their economic and innovative performance. However, scholars and practitioners in many countries, such as the U.s., Canada, EU, Australia, and China, have expressed concern about GVCs not fulfilling their social missions (Cumming and Johan, 2019).  \n\nSome suspect that the criteria by which GVCs are evaluated and supervised may cause GVCs to pursue investments with promising financial returns, the exact targets of PVCs, thus likely crowding out PVCs (Bai et al., 2022). For instance, GVCs are often assessed based on the economic performance of funded companies or exit proceeds from investments.2 Such assessments are designed to ensure that fund managers work diligently (Lerner, 2010), investors receive reasonable profits (Brander et al., 2010) and state-owned assets are safe (Zhang and Mayes, 2018). But the assessments may also motivate GVCs to target companies with promising financial prospects (Lerner, 1999; Zhang and Mayes, 2018; Bai et al., 2022). Moreover, since most GVC fund managers are government employees, they are inclined to prioritize short-term economic value due to the pressures associated with political promotion (Zhang and Mayes, 2018; Bai et al., 2022). This motivation will be more prominent in an economy with strong government intervention (Zheng et al., 2012). GVCs may also “cherry-pick? companies based on their likelihood of financial success to avoid any possible critique of wasting public money (Lerner, 1999). All of these may lead GVCs to compete against and consequently crowd out PVCs in selecting target companies. While the concern is valid, there is currently limited direct empirical evidence in the literature (Cumming and Johan, 2019).  \n\nA more significant number of scholars and practitioners are concerned about GVCs’ relatively constrained ability to enhance the economic and innovative performance of their funded companies in comparison to PVCs due to significant challenges. GVCs lack human capital and decision-making autonomy (Cumming et al., 2017). Moreover, they employ fewer contract mechanisms and voting rights to monitor funded companies than PVCs (Grilli and Murtinu, 2014). These factors hinder GVCs' capacity to deliver high-quality value-added services such as monitoring, advising, and business networking. The empirical evidence on GVCs' role in nurturing funded companies, however, is still inconclusive, as some recent studies have discovered certain privileges that GVCs could offer to the companies, such as providing political ties and public information (e.g., Ke and Wang, 2021; Colonnelli et al., 2022).  \n\nIn this study, we attempt to directly examine the crowding-out question and compare the post-investment performance of GVCfunded and PVC-funded companies simultaneously. As discussed before, the essential task in directly studying whether crowdingout occurs is to examine whether GVC-funded companies are those neglected by PVCs due to low expected economic returns (Gans and Stern, 2003; Brander et al., 2010). Ideally, studies should identify all potential investments for each VC and then compare the economic valuation of observed (i.e., realized) and counterfactual (i.e., unrealized) investments (Brander et al., 2010). However, conducting such an analysis is challenging, since the economic valuation is a pre-money valuation and thus cannot be observed directly, especially for counterfactual investments. The most used indicators in the literature (e.g., exit type and equity sales price upon VCs exit) can only measure the post-investment performance, instead of pre-money valuation. Moreover, as with the crowding-out study, the post-investment performance investigation should also consider counterfactuals of what would have happened in the absence of GVC funding.  \n\nTo deal with the challenges, we use the structure of Sorensen (2007)'s two-sided matching market to identify counterfactual investments, and develop a structural model based on two-sided matching. The structural model contains two parts, i.e., a valuation equation and an outcome equation. The valuation equation examines the crowding-out question by comparing the economic valuation of observed investments and counterfactual investments. The basic idea is that venture capital investment (i.e., match) is a mutual selection process in which VCs and companies select each other based on characteristics important for economic valuation (Sorensen, 2007). Thus, we can use various characteristics, including VC ownership, to estimate the economic valuation of the observed and counterfactual matches, and then reveal VCs and companies preferences over characteristics of each other from the equilibrium matching (Mindruta, 2013; Akkus et al., 2016). This revealed preference method allows us to discover if GVCs match to companies with inferior potential economic performance compared to PVCs in equilibrium, which helps answer the question of whether GVCs have funded the companies unpreferred (i.e., neglected) by PVCs. As the valuation equation eliminates selection bias in the investment process, the outcome equation can also identify the causal effects of GVC investment on the post-investment performance of the funded companies (Sorensen, 2007).  \n\nSpecifically, the valuation equation depicts how VCs and companies select each other based on important characteristics for economic valuation. Economic valuation is a latent variable, since we can only observe the binary results, i.e., if a VC and a company actually matched. The coefficients in the valuation equation represent the preferences over observed characteristics. The error term contains characteristics that are unobserved in our data but are observed by the investor and the company (e.g., a strong management team in the company). The outcome equation depicts how a company's post-investment economic/innovative performance is influenced by the observed characteristics of the VC, the company and the deal, market condition, institutional enviornments and an error term. The error term contains the characteristics that are unobserved in our data but are important for the company's post-investment performance. Since some of these characteristics may be observed by the investor and the company when an investment decision is made (e.g., a strong management team in the company), the covariance between the two error terms in the structural model captures unobserved characteristics that affect both pre-money valuation and post-investment performance. The sign of the covariance can reveal the preference over the characteristics that are unobserved in our data. We simultaneously estimate the valuation equation and the outcome equation using Bayesian estimation based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation method, which exploits information implied by equilibrium matching. We will elaborate on the logic in Section 3.2.  \n\nWe use data from China's VC market from 2000 to 2020 to estimate the structural model. The context offers an ideal research opportunity for three reasons. First, the VC market in China has become the world's second-largest after the U.s. over the last decade, and GVCs are one of the most critical players in the market (Gu and Lu, 2014; Huang and Tian, 2020; Chen, 2023). For instance, in 2008, $23\\%$ of the companies backed by VCs were funded by GVCs, which was $6\\%$ higher than that of the U.s. (Brander et al., 2015). Many GVCs, such as the Shenzhen Capital Group and the Jiangsu Govtor Capital Group, are ranked among China's largest and most prestigious VCs.3 Second, with a stronger government intervention in the Chinese economy than that in most western countries, GVCs in China have a stronger incentive to pursue companies with high economic returns in their investment selection. GVCs are governed as state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in China, and they bear the responsibility of ensuring the stable and reasonable profitability of stateowned assets (Zhang and Mayes, 2018). Moreover, the board director or CEO of a SOE can be directly promoted to a leader of a government department (Zheng et al., 2012).4 So, it is unsurprising that Chinese GVCs are very motivated to improve the company economic performance (Yu et al., 2014). Furthermore, new stock markets (i.e., the SME Board in 2004, the ChiNext Board in 2009, the STAR Market in 2019, and the BSE in 2021) provide rich exit opportunities to pursue high economic returns for GVCs. Third, nurturing entrepreneurship and innovation are Chinese GVCs’ most critical political mandates. The Chinese government considers innovation to be one of the key drivers of future growth. It spent more than $2.2\\%$ of GDP on R&D, which exceeded the average of the countries in the European Union (Medvedev et al., 2020). GVCs are expected to support innovative start-ups, such as those in emerging industries, despite their immaturity and high risk (Chandra et al., 2007). In sum, these features make Chinese GVCs face great tension in pursuing economic and social missions.  \n\nOur empirical results show that, other things being equal, VCs prefer companies with better potential economic performance, and companies prefer PVCs over GVCs. The mutual selection between VCs and companies leads to a stable assortative matching in which GVCs match to companies with inferior potential economic performance compared to PVC-funded companies; moreover, neither matched pairs nor unmatched pairs have any incentives to deviate from the observed matching. The existence of stable assortative matching suggests that if a GVC-funded company had not received funding from GVCs (the counterfactual situation), it would not be invested in by PVCs too. It means that the GVC-funded companies are those neglected by PVCs. In other words, the data do not support the conjecture that GVCs crowd out PVCs. In addition, we find the potential innovativeness of GVC-funded companies is higher than that of PVC-funded companies. Overall, these findings suggest that GVCs bridge the equity gap left by PVCs in innovative companies. We also find that, after investments GVCs are not significantly different from PVCs in improving companies? economic performance, but better than PVCs in promoting companies innovative performance. In additional analysis, we divide GVCs into governmentowned $100\\%$ ownership; GovC) and government-supported (less than $100\\%$ ownership; GSVC) VCs and find that the findings vary between the two types of GVCs. We also investigate the impacts of co-investment between GVCs and PVCs. Finally, we study the impacts of GVCs on companies in different stages of development.  \n\nThis study contributes to the literature in three respects. First, to the best of our knowledge, it is one of the first studies that directly answers the question concerning whether GVCs crowd out PVCs. Most studies on crowding-out question focus on the market level data and examine whether there is a positive relationship between government funding and private capital (e.g., Leleux and Surlemont, 2003; Lerner, 2010; Colombo et al., 2016; Cumming and Johan, 2019). Some recent studies have begun to use company level data, and they examine crowding-out by investigating whether companies that have received GVC funding would receive less additional funding from PVCs in later rounds (Brander et al., 2015; Alperovych et al., 2020). While these studies are very informative, they are implicit in answering the crowding-out question because they do not conduct counterfactual analysis (Brander et al., 2010). To address this question directly, we construct a two-sided matching structural model that allows us to compare the economic valuation of observed and counterfactual investments. This approach discovers if GVCs match to companies with inferior potential economic performance compared to PVCs in equilibrium.  \n\nThis paper also provides a new empirical method to examine the crowding-out of PVCs by GVCs. As Cumming and Johan (2019)  \n\npoint out in their literature review, the lack of consensus on whether GVCs crowd out PVCs can be attributed to the lack of a reliable empirical method. Our structural model has significant advantages compared to the traditional econometric models. First, the twosided matching framework allows us to identify all potential investments for each VC and compare the economic valuation of observed investments and counterfactual investments (Akkus et al., 2016). Second, the estimation procedure of the structural model exploits information implied by equilibrium matching: neither the matched pairs nor the unmatched pairs have any incentive to deviate from the observed matching. As a result, we can delve into the interactive investment selections of GVCs and PVCs, and determine whether GVC-funded companies are those neglected by PVCs due to low expected economic returns. Third, our structural method circumvents the endogeneity issues that exist in the estimation of the valuation and outcome equation, thereby providing consistent estimates for both equations (Sorensen, 2007).  \n\nFinally, this paper contributes to the debates on the appropriateness of GVCs. Most relevant studies have compared the postinvestment economic performance of GVC-funded companies and PVC-funded ones (e.g., Lerner, 1999; Hellmann and Puri, 2002; Grilli and Murtinu, 2014; Brander et al., 2015; Cumming et al., 2017; Zhang and Mayes, 2018; Suchard et al., 2021; Colonnelli et al., 2022), and very few have compared the post-investment innovative performance (e.g., Ke and Wang, 2021). In this study, we compare both the post-investment economic and innovative performance of the GVC-funded companies with the PVC-funded ones. Moreover, we examine in the stage of investment selection whether GVCs crowd out PVCs, and whether GVC-funded companies are potentially innovative. In addition, we explore the heterogeneous impacts of different types of GVCs, since mixed ownership might be different from pure government ownership (Brander et al., 2015). Given the prevalence of co-investment between GVCs and PVCs (Grilli and Murtinu, 2014, 2015), we also probe whether the sequence in which GVCs and PVCs are involved can significantly impact the outcomes. Finally, we examine the heterogeneous impacts of GVCs on companies in different stages of development. Our findings based on the Chinese data shed new light on the literature. The results warrant further investigation utilizing data from additional countries infuturestudies.  \n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces a two-sided matching model of venture capital investment. Section 3 develops the structural model based on the two-sided matching model. Section 4 describes the data. Section 5 analyzes the empirical results of the structural model, and Section 6 concludes the paper.  \n\n## 2. Two-sided matching model  \n\n### 2.1. Model assumptions  \n\nIn the venture capital market, an investment (i.e., a match) is a mutual selection, and it requires the consent of both the investor and the company. Following Sorensen (2007), we use a one-to-many two-sided matching model to capture the mutual selection process. The model is based on the following four assumptions.  \n\nFirst, each VC firm could match with multiple companies, while each company could only match with one VC firm. Sorensen (2007) argues that, although a company could be funded by several VCs (i.e., co-investment) in practice, only one, namely the lead VC, plays a major role. The lead VC invests in the initial round, and it provides value-added service and also brings other investors into the deal (Guerini and Quas, 2016). Following Sorensen (2007), we focus on the lead VC and the company's first funding round.5 The lead VC could be a PVC or a GVC. In addition, we assume that a VC firm could invest only in a limited number of companies due to time and resource constraints (Kaplan and Stromberg, 2004; Que and Zhang, 2021).  \n\nSecond, each potential match has an economic valuation and a social valuation.“Economic valuation” represents the expected net present value (NPV) of the match at the time of the investment selection. NPV is the pre-money valuation of the match, which is influenced by both the characteristics of the company and the characteristics of the VC. Investments in companies with better potential economic performance have higher valuations, and a match with a VC that has potential to add more value also has a higher valuation. As Sorensen (2007) did, we assume the VC expects to receive a fraction, , of the NPV, and the company expects to receive the residual (1-2),where $\\uplambda$ is given.6 \\*Social valuation\"” refers to the expected external value generated from the positive externality of the company's innovation (Bai et al., 2022). Because of the spillover effects of innovation, the beneficiaries include both the VC and the company, but third parties also are capable of utilizing the innovation (Czarnitzki and Hottenrott, 2011). For instance, during COVID19, numerous people used Zoom software to conduct free online meetings, which benefits the economic and social life of people beyond Zoom and its investors.  \n\nThird, GVCs and PVCs have different investment goals. PVCs only care about economic valuation, while GVCs consider both the economic and social valuations. Aside from ensuring reasonable profitability of state-owned assets, GVCs aim to increase the social value resulting from the innovation. Based on the different investment goals, we impose the following restrictions on preferences: PVCs prefer companies with better potential economic performance, and GvCs prefer companies with better potential economic performance or companies with higher potential innovativeness when potential economic performance is the same as that of alternatives.7  \n\nFinally, companies prefer VCs that may be able to add more economic value after the investment. VCs' ownership influences their capability of providing value-added services. GVCs’ investment decisions must comply with laws and regulations more tightly than PVCs, and thus they have less abilities to make independent decisions (Cumming et al., 2017; Colonnelli et al., 2022). The lack of decision-making discretion significantly reduces work efficiency during and after the investment. A survey of European investors and a survey of Chinese VCs find that GVCs spend more time in planning and securing the necessary approvals (Wilson and Silva, 2013; Colonnelli et al., 2022), which indicates higher time consumption and risk for companies before they eventually receive the funds. Moreover, some of the literature suggests that GVC fund managers may lack expertise required for monitoring and advising the funded companies (Bai et al., 2022). However, research findings also indicate that GVCs have certain advantages over PVCs. For instance, GVCs are more familiar with the initial public offering (IPO) regulatory process, and they can better assist companies in accessing an array of public resources, such as government procurement contracts and public information (Ke and Wang, 2021; Colonnelli et al., 2022).8 Nonetheless, the substantiation of these benefits through empirical evidence remains limited. The preference of companies for PVCs versus GVCs is a matter that necessitates further empirical examination.  \n\n### 2.2. Matching and equilibrium  \n\nOur model includes two sets of agents, i.e., VC investors $(I)$ and companies $(J)$ . Theoretically, investors can invest in any company, and companies can receive funds from any investors. The set of potential investments (i.e., matches) is $M=I\\times J.$ A matching is a collection of potential investments, $\\mu{\\subset}M.$ Investor i's portfolio is denoted as $\\mu(i)$ , and the investor of company $j$ is denoted as $\\mu(j)$ thus, a match between investor i and company $j$ can be expressed as $i j\\in\\mu\\Leftrightarrow j\\in\\mu(i)\\Leftrightarrow i=\\mu(j)$  \n\nEach potential match, $i j$ has an economic valuation, $V_{i j}.$ stemming from financial return, and a social valuation, $\\begin{array}{r}{S_{i j},}\\end{array}$ stemming from the positive externality of company innovation. As mentioned earlier, both $V_{i j}$ and $\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{S}}_{i j}$ are expected values, and they are determined by the characteristics of VCs and companies. During the matching process, investors and companies make their selections based on the valuation they care about. These valuations are assumed to be distinct, and the valuations determine the preferences of both the investors and the companies. As we assume that the economic valuation, $V_{i j},$ is divided between the VC and the company with the proportions of $\\lambda$ and (1-2), the payoffs perceived by the investor and the company are as follows:  \n\n$\\mathrm{PVC}\\:i^{\\prime}\\mathrm{s}\\mathrm{payoff}:\\pi_{i}(j)=\\lambda V_{i j}$ $\\mathrm{GVC}~i^{\\prime}\\mathrm{s~payoff:}{\\pi}_{i}(j)={\\lambda}V_{i j}+S_{i j}$ $\\mathrm{Company}j\\mathrm{spayoff}:\\pi_{j}(i)=(1-\\lambda)V_{i j}$  \n\nAccording to these payoff functions, company $j$ would prefer investor $i$ over investor $i$ if the economic valuation of matching with i is greater than that of matching with i $(V_{i j}>V_{i j})$ . PVC i would prefer company j to company j when the economic valuation of matching with $j^{'}$ is greater than that of matching with j $(V_{i j}>V_{i j})$ . For GVCs, given their dual purpose, their decision process may include two steps. First, GVC i would prefer company $j$ to company $j$ when the economic valuation of matching with $j$ is greater than that of matching with j $\\mathrm{~\\small~\\mathscr~{~i~}~}(V_{i j}>V_{i j})$ . Second, if $V_{i j}=V_{i j}$ , GVC i would compare and prefer company $j$ 近 $S_{i j}>S_{i j}$ 9.  \n\nIf all agents in the market are unwilling to deviate from the current match and establish a new one, then the matching is pair-wise stable, meaning that the market reaches equilibrium. The empirical work of the present study is feasible if and only if the two-sided matching model has a unique equilibrium. As Sorensen (2007) did, we also depict the conditions for reaching the unique equilibrium in the following proposition:  \n\nProposition: The two-sided matching model with preferences determined by Eqs.(1)-(3) and with distinct valuations has a unique equilibrium,and theequilibriummatchingispair-wisestable.  \n\n# J. Zhang et al.  \n\nIn this unique equilibrium, the matching is assortative, and two scenarios may appear. First, if companies prefer PVCs to GVCs as their investors, then PVCs will match to companies with superior potential economic performance, and GVCs will match to companies with inferior potential economic performance.10 This implies that companies with inferior potential economic performance are likely to be underfunded by PVCs, even if they might engage in intensive innovation. However, the innovative companies neglected by PVCs may be funded by GVCs, since GVCs aim to increase social value stemming from innovation. In this case, the GVCs do not crowd out the PVCs. In the second scenario, if companies prefer GVCs to PVCs as their investors, then GVCs will match to companies with superior potential economic performance, and PVCs will match to companies with inferior potential economic performance. In this case, GVC investments crowd out PVC investments. Hence, in order to address the inquiry regarding crowding-out, it is imperative to ascertain the scenario that emerges from our empirical testing.  \n\n## 3. Structural model and variables  \n\n### 3.1.Basic model and variables  \n\nTo test whether GVCs crowd out PVCs in the stage of investment selection, and compare the post-investment performance of GVCfunded and PvC-funded companies simultaneously, we develop a structural model based on the two-sided matching model. The structural model includes two parts, i.e., a valuation equation and an outcome equation.  \n\nThe valuation equation depicts how VCs and companies select each other based on characteristics that are important for economic valuation.11 It can be presented as follows:  \n\n+asVclimitedpartner+a6Early stage $+\\alpha_{7}$ Hightech  \n\n+ αgPrior patent+Nij  \n\nIn this equation, $V_{i j}$ represents the economic valuation of the match between VC firm i and company j. $V_{i j}$ is defined for all potential matches, not just the observed matches, in the same market, which is composed of first-round investments in companies located in the same region during the same year (Sorensen, 2007).12 $V_{i j}$ is a latent variable, and Eq. (4) is a discrete choice equation. Since the valuations represent agents? preferences, they are unaffected by a change in the scale of the valuations. Hence, the constant variable is excluded from the equation. Region dummies and year dummies are also excluded from the equation, since they are constants in each market.  \n\nGVC is a dummy variable, which equals “1\" if the focal VC firm's largest shareholder is a government agency or a governmentcontrolled business enterprise. If neither is the case, it will equal ‘ $\\cdot0^{\\cdot\\cdot}$ , since the largest shareholder often controls a company's operations in many countries (Claessens et al., 2002). The coefficient for GVC will be significantly positive/negative if GVCs are more/ less preferred by companies than PVCs, suggesting that, other things being equal, matches with GVCs have higher/lower valuations on average. If the coefficient for GVC is insignificant, then either the matching is random or does not depend on whether the investor is a GVC.  \n\nFollowing the previous literature on VCs, we control for the following key VC characteristics: (1) VC reputation is measured by the natural logarithm of the number of previous exits through IPO of the focal VC firm (Gu and Lu, 2014). A VC firm builds its reputation by guiding the company from a start-up to an IPO (Nahata, 2008). VCs with higher reputations are perceived to be more competent in offering value-added service. (2) VC experience is calculated as the natural logarithm of the number of deals the focal VC firm participated in before (Sorensen, 2007). On one hand, more experienced VC firms have better post-investment management and monitoring ability (Gompers and Lerner, 2004). On the other hand, some studies point out that time is a scarce resource for VCs (Quindlen, 2000; Kaplan and Stromberg, 2004), and more investment deals within a period means that the time allocation is more dispersed, so more experienced VC firms do not necessarily provide better value-added service (Wang and Wang, 2011). (3) VC network is the ratio of the number of VCs with whom the focal VC firm cooperated over the past five years to the total number of active VCs over the past five years (Hochberg et al., 2007; Ke and Wang, 2021). This variable measures the network density of the focal VC firm. VCs with a denser network have better access to information and resources, so that they may provide better value-added service Hochberg et al., 2007). (4) VC limited partner takes the value of “1\"' if the focal VC firm is structured as a limited partnership; otherwise, its value is $\\cdot0^{,}$ (Ke and Wang, 2021). Although limited partnership is the prevailing form of organization within U.S. VCs, it was only permitted in  \n\nChina after 2007. In this study the majority of VC firms are structured as limited liability companies. We include VC limited partner to control for the possible influence of VC organization form on mutual selection between VCs and companies.  \n\nWe also control the features of companies. Limited by data availability of private companies, we include the following features most studied in the literature: (1) Early stage takes the value of “1” if the company is in the seed or start-up stage at the time of funding, and it takes thevalue of° $\\cdot0^{,}$ in the expansion or mature stage. Companies in the early stage of development have high risks, so they face more challenges in obtaining funds (Sorensen, 2007). (2) High tech takes the value of “1 if the company belongs to any high-tech industry; otherwise,itsvalue is $^{\\circ}$ . We defined the high-tech industry with reference to the National Standard for High-Tech Industry Classification (2002) (https: /www.stats.gov.cn/),13 which is used extensively by scholars in Chinese VC studies (Liu et al., 2014). (3) Prior patent is measured by the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of invention patent applications filed by the company over the past three years (Cumming et al., 2017). This variable measures the company's past innovative performance.  \n\nThe error term, $\\eta_{i j},$ captures characteristics unobserved in our data. For example, a company may have a strong management team or a promising market prospect. Companies with such characteristics possess a better potential economic performance (Kaplan and Stromberg, 2004). Although these characteristics cannot be observed in our data, they could be observed partly by the VC firms before investment and thus influence the VC firms' decision making.  \n\nThe outcome equation examines the factors that influence a company's post-investment economic performance. Following prior literature, we use whether the company experiences a successful exit to measure post-investment economic performance. Exit is a dummy variable that takes the value of “1” if the company exits successfully through IPO or M&A by the end of the sample period; otherwise,itsvalueis $\\mathbf{\\tilde{\\rho}}^{\\infty}$ (Suchard et al., 2021; Jia and Wang, 2017). The outcome equation is presented as follows:  \n\n$\\begin{array}{r l}&{E x i t_{i j}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}G V C+\\beta_{2}V C r e p u t a t i o n+\\beta_{3}V C e x p e r i e n c e+\\beta_{4}V C n e t w o r k}\\ &{+\\beta_{5}V C l i m i t e d~p a r t n e r+\\beta_{6}E a r l y s t a g e+\\beta_{7}H i g h~t e c h+\\beta_{8}P r i\\dot{o}r~p a t e n t}\\ &{+\\beta_{9}F u n d i n g~s i z e+\\beta_{10}S t a g e d~i n v e s t m e n t+\\beta_{11}I n v e s t o r~s i z e}\\ &{+\\beta_{12}M i x e d~s y n d i c a t i o n+\\beta_{13}M i x e d~c o-f i n a n c i n g+\\beta_{14}E x i t~c o n d i t i o n+\\beta_{15}M a r k e t i z a t i o n+Y e a r~d u m m i e s+}\\end{array}$ Region dummies + Ej  \n\nUnlike the valuation equation, the outcome equation is only defined for all observed matches. Aside from all VC and company variables in the valuation equation (Eq. (4)), we include the characteristics of a deal, exit condition and institutional environments as additional control variables in the outcome equation.  \n\nThe characteristics of a deal include: (1) Funding size is calculated as the natural logarithm of the sum of the investment amount in the first funding round. Companies that receive more funding in the first round have a higher probability of successfully exit, since a larger fund indicates a higher valuation of the project (Ke and Wang, 2021). (2) Staged investment is a dummy variable that takes the value of “1\" if the focal VC firm stages investments in the company; otherwise its value is “0”\" (Dai, 2011). A prevailing viewpoint suggests that staged investments grant the VC firm the option to discontinue funding if the company fails to meet predetermined milestones. Staged investments may be associated with a favorable post-investment performance (Tian, 2011). (3) Investor size is measured by the natural logarithm of the number of VC firms co-investing in the focal company (Tian, 2011). A larger number of investors may help facilitate a successful exit by sharing information, contacts, and resources among VCs. (4) Mixed syndication is a dummy variable that takes the value of “1\" if the first round of funding involves both GVCs and PVCs; otherwise, its value is “O\". Syndication between GVCs and PVCs might benefit the funded company with complementary resources, information, and skills. However, the inherent distinctions between PVCs and GVCs may also exacerbate the agency problem and lead to increased transaction costs during co-investment (Grilli and Murtinu, 2014). (5) Mixed co-financing is a dummy variable that equals “1” if a PVC (GVC) invests in the focal company in later rounds after the first funding round led by a GVC (PVC); otherwise, it equals $\\mathbf{\\tilde{\\rho}}^{\\infty}$ .Grilli and Murtinu (2014) argue that co-financing between GVCs and PVCs may share similar types of benefits and costs with the syndication of GVCs and PVCs, but the net influence on the funded company might differ.  \n\nThe control variables about exit condition and institutional environments include: (1) Exit condition is calculated as the natural logarithm of the number of IPOs in the exit year (Zheng and Xia, 2018). Companies are more likely to achieve successful exits during times of favorable market conditions. (2) Marketization is proxied by Wang et al. (2021)'s marketization index measured at provincial level in the exit year. This variable is incorporated to control for the influence of the institutional environments in the province where the company is situated on its exit outcome (Ke and Wang, 2021; Suchard et al., 2023). On one hand, companies usually exhibit superior performance if operating within a province characterized by a higher level of marketization (Wu and Ye, 2009), thus are more likely to achieve successful exits. On the other hand, as such a province usually hosts a larger number of companies, and Chinese Securities Regulation Commission allocates annual IPO quota to each province (Zhang and Mayes, 2018), companies in this location face severer competition in pursuing exit opportunity. In sum, the net effect of Marketization is to be tested. Finally, we add Year dummies and Region dummies. All variable measurements and the associated details are summarized in Appendix A. The term $\\varepsilon_{i j}$ captures factors that were unobserved in our data.  \n\nFollowing Sorensen (2007), we asume that the error terms $\\eta_{i j}$ in Eq. (4) and $\\varepsilon_{i j}$ in Eq. (5) are dependent and follow the joint distribution below:  \n\n$$\n\\binom{\\varepsilon_{i j}}{\\eta_{i j}}\\sim N\\Biggl(0,\\left[\\begin{array}{c c}{1+\\delta^{2}}&{\\delta}\\ {\\delta}&{1}\\end{array}\\right]\\Biggr)\n$$  \n\nThecovariance, $\\delta,$ captures the unobserved factors that affect both the economic valuation and the post-investment economic performance (Sorensen, 2007). For instance, a company with a strong management team possesses a better potential economic performance. This characteristic was unobserved in our data, but it can be observed partly by the VC firm at the time of the investment decision. Since the characteristic also increases the company's rate of successful exit, it enters the error terms in both valuation and outcome equations. In Section 5.1.1, we will elaborate on how the sign of the covariance reveals the preference over the characteristics unobserved in our data.  \n\n### 3.2. Interaction of VC investment decisions, estimation, and identification  \n\nIn the one-to-many matching model, once the focal VC invests in a company as a lead VC, the other VCs are precluded from making further investments in the same company as a lead VC. Such an interaction means that each VC's investment decision cannot be analyzed in isolation. The commonly used Probit estimation cannot account for the interactions among different VCs, so it is not applicable in this case (Sorensen, 2007). Instead, Bayesian estimation using MCMC simulation provides an elegant solution. The simulation relies on the pair-wise stability of the equilibrium matching: VCs and companies receive higher economic values from the observed matches than they would otherwise have obtained from counterfactual matches, and neither matched pairs nor unmatched pairs prefer to deviate from the observed matching and form a new match. Therefore, the pair-wise stability imposes a lower bound for the economic value of any observed match and an upper bound for the economic value of any counterfactual match.  \n\n$$\n\\bar{V}_{i j}\\equiv m a x\\left[V_{\\mu(j)j},\\mathop{m i n}_{j\\in\\mu(i)}V_{i j}\\right]\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\mathbb{\\underline{{V}}}_{i j}\\equiv m a x\\left[{m a x}V_{i j},{m a x}V_{i j}\\right]\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{S(i)\\equiv\\left\\{j\\in J:V_{i j}>V_{\\mu(j)j}\\right\\}}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{S(j)\\equiv\\left\\{i\\in I:V_{i j}>\\underset{j\\in\\mu(i)}{m i n}V_{i j}\\right\\}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nMore specifically, we simultaneously estimate the valuation equation and outcome equation using Bayesian estimation based on MCMC simulation. For brevity, let $\\alpha$ contain the parameters of valuation equation and $\\beta$ contain the parameters of the outcome equation. The MCMC process treats latent variables as parameters along with $(\\alpha,\\beta,\\delta)$ , which significantly simplifies simulation of the resulting augmented posterior distribution. The simulation process is iterative, with each iteration generating a draw from a Markov Chain. The Markov chain is generated by drawing each individual dimension of the joint posterior distribution, conditioned on the draws of the other dimensions. As shown in Sorensen (2007)'s Appendix, with a normal prior distribution of $(\\alpha,\\beta,\\delta)$ , the univariate conditional posterior distributions of $\\alpha,\\beta,\\delta$ and latent variables $V_{i j}$ for all $\\ddot{\\imath\\jmath}$ are also normal or truncated normal. When $i j$ is a matched pair, $V_{i j}$ is truncated from below at $\\underline{{V}}_{i j}$ .When $i j$ is an unmatched pair, $V_{i j}$ is truncated from above at $\\bar{V}_{i j}$ . Thus, the draws of $V_{i j}$ (for all $i j$ satisfy pair-wise stability, and account for the equilibrium matching between VCs and companies.  \n\nBayesian estimation recovers the parameters consistently. The valuation equation is defined on the set of all potential matches, not just the set of observed matches. Thus, the error erm $\\eta_{i j}$ is unrelated to explanation variables in the valuation equation, which, together with the draws of $V_{i j}$ (the dependent variable in the valuation equation), enables us to estimate $\\alpha$ consistently. Unlike the valuation equation, the outcome equation is just defined on the set of observed matches. Its error term $\\varepsilon_{i j}$ can be decomposed orthogonally into the sum of $\\delta\\eta_{i j}$ and $\\zeta_{i j},$ in which $\\delta$ is the covariance between $\\varepsilon_{i j}$ and $\\eta_{i j}$ (see Eq. (6)). In each iteration of the MCMC process, the disturbance $\\eta_{i j}$ will be estimated first, so the remaining term $\\zeta_{i j}$ is the real error term of the outcome equation. Since $\\zeta_{i j}$ is unrelated to the test variable $G V C$ and $\\eta_{i j}$ , the Bayesian estimators for the coefficient $\\beta_{1}$ on GVC and the covariance $\\delta$ are also consistent. We use the \"matchingMarkets\" package in $R$ to carry out our estimation routine.  \n\n### 3.3.Additional model and variables  \n\nSection 2.2 implies that companies with inferior potential economic performance are likely to be underfunded by PVCs, even though they might engage in intensive innovation. However, some of the innovative companies neglected by PVCs could be funded by GVCs, since GVCs bear the social mission of increasing social value stemming from innovation. It is difficult to directly test whether GVC-funded companies are potentially innovative. Thus, we investigate this conjecture indirectly by examining whether the potential innovativeness of GVC-funded companies is higher than that of PVC-funded companies. To do so, we reconstruct the outcome equation as follows:  \n\nPatent; = Yo +GVC + 2VC reputation $+\\gamma_{3}V C$ experience $+\\gamma_{4}V C$ network $:+\\gamma_{5}V C$ limited partner $+\\gamma_{6}$ Early stage + -High tech + Y8Prior patent + r9Funding size + Y1oStaged investment $+\\gamma_{11}$ Investor size $+\\gamma_{12}$ Mixed syndication  \n\nIn this equation, Patent is the logarithm of one plus the number of patent applications within two years after the first funding round (Ke and Wang, 2021). Patenting is used extensively to measure post-investment innovative performance, since it is highly correlated with successful innovation. Chinese patents are classified into three categories, i.e., invention, utility model, and design. In the main test, we only include patent applications for inventions and utility models because design patents generally are low in innovation quality (Ke and Wang, 2021).  \n\nWe include the characteristics of VCs, companies, deals, and institutional environments as control variables in the outcome equation (Eq. (7)). The definitions of the variables GVC, VC reputation, VC experience, VC network, VC limited partner, Early stage, High tech, Prior patent, Funding size, Staged investment, Investor size, Mixed syndication, Mixed co-financing, Year dummies, Region dummies are the same as those in Eq. (5). In addition, we include two control variables Local R&D and Legal protection. Local R&D is calculated as the natural logarithm of the R&D expenditure in the province in which the company is located, measured in the year of the first funding round. Legal protection is proxied by Wang et al. (2021)'s law environment index measured in the year of the first funding round (Ke and Wang, 2021). This index captures the development of market intermediaries, the strength of the legal environment safeguarding the market, and the level of intellectual property protection in the province where the company is located. The term $\\epsilon_{i j}$ captures factors unobserved in our data.  \n\nSimilar to the analysis in section 3.1 and 3.2, the error term $\\epsilon_{i j}$ of Eq. (7) can be decomposed orthogonally into $\\psi\\eta_{i j}$ and $\\xi_{i j}$ where $\\eta_{i j}$ is the error term of the valuation equation (Eq. (4)) and $\\psi$ is the covariance between $\\epsilon_{i j}$ and $\\eta_{i j}$ The covariance, $\\psi$ , captures unobserved factors that affect both economic valuation and post-investment innovative performance of a match. The sign of $\\psi$ is to be determined, and it depends on whether innovative companies are, on average, associated with high economic values. A more detailed discussion of this is presented in Section 5.2. We estimate the valuation equation (Eq. (4) and outcome equation (Eq. (7)) simultaneously using Bayesian estimation based on the MCMC simulation method (Sorensen, 2007). The Bayesian estimators for the covariance $\\psi$ and the coefficient $\\gamma_{1}$ on GVC in Eq. (7) are consistent.  \n\n## 4. Data  \n\n### 4.1. Data collection and sample  \n\nThe work draws on data from the Chinese VC market. We collected information on VC investment deals, such as investment dates, investment amounts, names of VC firms, names of funded companies, stage of companies’ development and industry classification, primarily from the Zero2IPO database, which has been used extensively in research on the Chinese VC market and covers most VC investment deals in China after 1990 (e.g., Li et al., 2016). To measure companies' post-investment economic performance, we collected information on their exit via IPO or M&A in the same database.  \n\nTo identify GVCs and PVCs, we manually collected the information of VC firm shareholders. By searching for each VC firm's abbreviated name and full name on the website of China's State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) (http:/www.gsxt. gov.cn/), we collected information about the shareholders? ownership backgrounds and investment amounts.  \n\nTo collect the data on companies? post-investment innovative performance, we searched for their abbreviated and full names on the website of China's State Intellectual Property Rights Office (http:/www.cnipa.gov.cn/) and collected the annual patent application data.  \n\nThe original sample is restricted to the first-round investment for each company, and in the cases where several VC firms participate in this funding round, the sample includes only the investment by the lead VC firm. The lead VC firm is identified as the VC firm that makes the largest investment in the first round (Ke and Wang, 2021). The sample is restricted to first-round funding made from 2000 to 2014. We excluded the companies whose first-round funding deal concluded before 2ooo, because the Chinese VC market was still in its infancy in the 1990s, and this would have led to the inclusion of incomplete data (Zheng and Xia, 2018). We also excluded the companies whose first-round funding deal concluded after 2014, since most VC firms′ investment cycle is five to six years, and we needed to maintain a six-year observation window when collecting performance data. We stopped collecting data on the performance of companies in 2020. Following the literature, we removed the companies in the real estate development and film/television industries because a successful exit from these industries cannot be judged by IPO or M&A (Zhang and Mayes, 2018). We removed the first-round funding led by foreign venture capital firms due to different exit patterns between companies funded by foreign venture capital firms and those funded by domestic VC firms (Suchard et al., 2021). We also removed companies that had missing data. The final sample contains 3328 first-round funding deals, which involve 1298 lead VCs.  \n\nTable 1 Descriptive statistics of the main variables.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"10\">Panel A: Descriptive statistics for the full sample</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\">VARIABLE OBS MEAN STD.

Panel A reports the descriptive statistics of the full sample. The sample is restricted to first-round funding made from 2000 to 2014. covering 3328 first-round funding led by 1298lead VCs. PanelB reports the descriptive statistics of the subsamples of GVC deals and PVC deals. The subsample of GVC deals covers 564 first-round funding led by 168 lead GVCs. The subsample of PVC deals covers 2764 first-round funding led by 1130 lead PVCs. The symbols \\*, $^{**}$ and $^{***}$ indicate significance at the $10\\%$ $5\\%$ and $1\\%$ levels, respectively. Definitions of the variables are presented in Appendix A.  \n\n# J. Zhang et al.  \n\n### 4.2. Descriptive statistics and correlation matrix  \n\nTable 1 Panel A shows the descriptive statistics for the main variables of the full sample, and Panel B compares the statistics for the GVC andPVC deals.  \n\nPanel A and B show that the rates of successful exit are $34\\%$ for the full sample, $28\\%$ for the GVC-funded companies, and $35\\%$ for the PVC-funded companies. The mean number of patent applications stands at 9.45 (i.e., the mean of the variable Patent is 1.15) for the full sample and 9.01 (i.e., the mean of the variable Patent is 1.14) and 9.53 (i.e., the mean of the variable Patent is 1.15) for the GVCfunded and PVC-funded companies, respectively. It seems that the GVC-funded companies perform slightly worse in terms of exiting through IPO or M&A and generating patent applications. However, it is not clear whether these results are driven by the influence of GVCs or by the lower quality of GVC-backed companies.  \n\nPanel B suggests that GVCs have a lower reputation $(\\mathrm{mean}=0.33\\$ ) than PVCs (0.43) and GVCs networks $\\left(\\mathrm{mean}=0.05\\right)$ are less dense than those of PVCs (0.07). GVCs are less likely to adopt limited partnership organization form $\\mathtt{\\{m e a n=0.00\\}}$ ) than PVCs (0.09). GVC-funded companies are distributed more toward the early stage $\\mathrm{(mean=0.31)}$ , and receive lower amounts of funding (mean $=$ 1.52) in the first round than PVC-funded companies (0.23, and 1.62 respectively). The number of co-investors in GVC-funded companies $\\left(\\mathrm{mean}=0.51\\right)_{\\cdot}$ is larger than that in PVC-funded companies (0.63). GVCs show a significantly higher inclination to co-invest with PVCs, whether through syndication $\\mathrm{(mean=0.20)}$ ) or co-financing (mean $=0.16$ ), in contrast to PVCs, which exhibit a lower tendency to co-invest with GVCs (0.06 and 0.04, respectively). Finally, GVCs exhibit a greater propensity to invest in companies situated within less developed provinces. This inclination is gauged through factors such as marketization level $(\\mathrm{mean}=9.32\\$ 0, local R&D expenditure (mean $=8.49$ ), and local legal protection (mean $=7.32\\$ 0. In comparison, PVCs demonstrate slightly lower investment levels in these areas, with means of 9.67, 8.92, and 8.34 for marketization level, local R&D expenditure, and local legal protection, respectively.  \n\nTable 2 shows the correlation matrix of the main variables. While VC reputation, VC experience, and VC network exhibit notably strong correlations with each other, VIF tests suggest that collinearity is not a serious concern in this study. Other correlations are lower than 0.5.  \n\n## 5. Findings  \n\n### 5.1. Do GVCs crowd out PVCs?  \n\nTo explore whether GVCs crowd out PVCs in the stage of investment selection, we estimate the structural model composed of Eqs. (4) and (5). The structural model also enables us to test the VCs' and companies’ preferences over certain characteristics of each other. Table 3 reports the Bayesian estimation results of the structural model.  \n\n#### 5.1.1. Verification of preference assumption  \n\nThe coefficients in the valuation equation in Table 3 indicate the agents preferences over the observed characteristics. The larger the coefficients, the stronger the preferences over the characteristics. As can be seen, the coefficient for GVC in the valuation equation is $-0.3181$ , and it is statistically significant at the $5\\%$ level. The negative sign reflects that, other things being equal, GVCs are less preferred than PVCs by companies. 4 This finding suggests that although GVC investment could benefit companies in some aspects, such as assisting the companies in getting extra public support (Colombo et al., 2016; Suchard et al., 2021), its negative impacts on the companies operation, such as companies becoming less independent and lacking the power of negotiation concerning covenants, dominate companies' evaluation on GVCs (Cumming et al., 2017). The marginal effect of GVC in the valuation equation is $8.97\\%$ It indicates that, given the identical experience, reputation, network position and organization form of VCs, the likelihood of GVCs being preferred by companies is $41.03\\%$ $(50\\%{-}8.97\\%)$ . The probability would be $50\\%$ if companies had no preference concerning VCs' ownership.  \n\nThe control variables in the valuation equation show interesting results. The coefficient for VC reputation is positive and significant at the $1\\%$ level, suggesting that VC investors with more successful exit experiences are more likely to be selected by companies. However, the coefficient for VC experience is negative and significant at the $1\\%$ level, indicating that VC investors with more rounds of financing experience are less likely to be chosen by companies as the lead VC. This finding remained after we tried multiple alternative measurements. The result may be attributed to the limited time the VCs are able to allocate to each project when they have many projects (Wang and Wang, 2011). The coefficient for Early stage is negative and significant at the $1\\%$ level, indicating that earlier-stage companies are less likely to be selected by VCs.  \n\nThe covariance between the error terms captures factors unobserved in our data that affect both economic valuation and postinvestment economic performance measured by successful exit. If a VC prefers matching with a company that possesses better potential economic performance, as we assumed in Section 2.1, then the associated characteristics (e.g., a strong management team of the company) will be recognized in valuation, and the error term in the valuation equation is positive. Since companies′ potential economic performance is in line with their post-investment economic performance, the error term in the outcome equation should also be positive. Thus, the covariance between the two error terms is expected to be positive. If our assumption in Section 2.1 does not stand, i.  \n\nTable2   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td

The results in Table 3 show that the covariance is 0.1409 with statistical significanceatthe $10\\%$ level. The positive sign of the covariance indicates that VCs prefer companies with better potential economic performance, which verifies our assumption of preference.  \n\n#### 5.1.2. The existence of assortative matching  \n\nIn Section 5.1.1, we found that in the first funding round, other things being equal, VCs prefer companies with better potential economic performance, and companies prefer PVCs over GVCs. Taken together, the revealed preferences indicate that GVCs match to companies with inferior potential economic performance compared to PVCs. In other words, an assortative matching exists in the market. It merits noting, as elaborated in Section 2.2 and Section 3.2, that the assortative matching is pair-wise stable, suggesting that VCs and companies receive higher economic values from the observed matches than they would otherwise have obtained from counterfactual matches. Overall, the existence of a stable assortative matching indicates that GVC-funded companies are those neglected by PVCs due to low expected economic returns. In other words, GVCs do not crowd out PVCs in the stage of investment selection.  \n\nWe provide further evidence for the existence of assortative matching by using a Logit model solely to estimate the outcome equation (Table 4) and then comparing the coefficient of GVC in the Logit model with that in the outcome equation of the structural model (Table 3). In the Logit model, the coefficient for GVC is $-0.2397$ , which is statistically significant at the $10\\%$ level.This suggests that GVC-funded companies, on average, exhibit a lower probability of successful exit than PVC-funded companies. This result may be driven by inferior influences of GVCs on companies exit probability and/or by inferior potential economic performance of companies,  \n\nTable3 Bayesian estimates of the structural model: economic valuation and economic outcome.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>MEAN</td><td>dP/dW</td><td>XP/IP</td><td>Std.Err.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\">VALUATIONEQUATION</td></tr><tr><td>GVC</td><td>-0.3181</td><td>-0.0897</td><td></td><td>0.1406**</td></tr><tr><td>VCreputation</td><td>0.6982</td><td>0.1970</td><td></td><td>0.1574***</td></tr><tr><td>VC experience</td><td>0.2474</td><td>-0.0698</td><td></td><td>0.0847***</td></tr><tr><td>VCnetwork</td><td>-0.5389</td><td>-0.1520</td><td></td><td>0.6515</td></tr><tr><td>VClimited partner</td><td>0.2974</td><td>0.0839</td><td></td><td>0.2698</td></tr><tr><td>Early stage</td><td>0.2592</td><td>-0.0731</td><td></td><td>0.0362***</td></tr><tr><td>High tech</td><td>-0.0539</td><td>0.0152</td><td></td><td>0.0329</td></tr><tr><td>Priorpatent</td><td>-0.0058</td><td>-0.0016</td><td></td><td>0.0233</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\">OUTCOMEEQUATION</td></tr><tr><td>GVC</td><td>-0.0986</td><td></td><td>-0.0350</td><td>0.0761</td></tr><tr><td>VCreputation</td><td>0.0781</td><td></td><td>0.0277</td><td>0.0586</td></tr><tr><td>VCexperience</td><td>-0.0990</td><td></td><td>0.0351</td><td>0.0340***</td></tr><tr><td>VCnetwork</td><td>0.2055</td><td></td><td>-0.0728</td><td>0.3624</td></tr><tr><td>VClimitedpartner</td><td>0.0860</td><td></td><td>0.0305</td><td>0.0923</td></tr><tr><td>Early stage</td><td>0.4693</td><td></td><td>0.1663</td><td>0.0651***</td></tr><tr><td>High tech</td><td>0.1318</td><td></td><td>0.0467</td><td>0.0553**</td></tr><tr><td>Priorpatent</td><td>0.0680</td><td></td><td>0.0241</td><td>0.0389*</td></tr><tr><td>Funding size</td><td>0.1597</td><td></td><td>0.0566</td><td>0.0272***</td></tr><tr><td>Stagedinvestment</td><td>0.0265</td><td></td><td>0.0094</td><td>0.0801</td></tr><tr><td>Investor size</td><td>0.2423</td><td></td><td>0.0859</td><td>0.0454***</td></tr><tr><td>Mixed syndication</td><td>0.1213</td><td></td><td>-0.0430</td><td>0.0944</td></tr><tr><td>Mixed co-financing</td><td>0.0888</td><td></td><td>0.0315</td><td>0.1047</td></tr><tr><td>Exit condition</td><td>0.0940</td><td></td><td>0.0333</td><td>0.0262***</td></tr><tr><td>Marketization</td><td>0.1492</td><td></td><td>-0.0529</td><td>0.0355***</td></tr><tr><td>(Intercept)</td><td>0.2743</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.4224</td></tr><tr><td>Region dummies</td><td></td><td>Yes</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Year dummies</td><td></td><td>Yes</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VARIANCE</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Covariance</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.0499</td><td>0.0830*</td></tr><tr><td>OBSERVATION</td><td>0.1409</td><td>3328</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table reports the Bayesian estimates of the basic structural model.

Err represents the clustered standard errors estimated at the VC firm level.

Variable definitions are presented in Appendix A.  \n\nbecause the Logit model does not control for the impact of unobserved factors on companies' exit probability. Unlike the Logit model, the structural model controls for the impact of unobserved factors; thus, the coefficient of GVC in the outcome equation of the structural model represents the impact of GVC on companies’ exit probability. The coefficient for GVC in the outcome equation of the structural model is insignificant in Table 3, which indicates that GVCs are not inferior to PVCs in promoting companies' exit probability. Integrating the results above, we conclude that GVCs invest in companies with inferior potential economic performance. In addition, the coefficient for GVC in the outcome equation of the structural model is higher than that in the Logit model, further confirming the existence of assortative matching.  \n\n### 5.2. Are GVC-funded companies potentially innovative?  \n\nAfter verifying that GVCs do not crowd out PVCs in the stage of investment selection, we are concerned about whether GVCs have allocated funds for potentially innovative companies. We rerun the structural model composed of Eqs. (4) and (7); in the outcome Eq. (7), the dependent variable is Patent. Table 5 reports the estimated result.  \n\nThe coefficient for GVC in the valuation equation is $-0.3513$ , and it is statistically significant at the $1\\%$ level. The negative sign indicates that companies prefer PVCs over GVCs. This is consistent with the finding in Table 3. The marginal effect of GVC in the valuation equation is $-9.91\\%$ . Given the identical experience, reputation, network position and organization form of VCs, the likelihood of GVCs being preferred by companies is $40.09\\%$ $(50\\%-9.91\\%)$ , while it is $59.91\\%$ for PVCs. The effects of other control variables also are consistent with the variables in Table 3.  \n\nThe covariance between the error terms in the valuation and outcome equations captures unobserved factors affecting both economic valuation and post-investment innovative performance. The sign of the covariance depends on whether VCs prefer companies with higher potential innovativeness, which remains controversial in the literature. On one hand, researchers have long advocated that innovation is a massive creator of economic value and a driver of a company's competitive advantage (Porter, 1990). Hence, innovative companies may be associated with high economic value, so that they will attract VCs. In this case, the potential innovativeness  \n\nTable5 Bayesian estimates of the structural model: economic valuation and innovative outcome.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>MEAN</td><td>dP/dW</td><td>Std.Err.</td></tr><tr><td>VALUATIONEQUATION</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>GVC</td><td>-0.3513</td><td>-0.0991</td><td>0.1297***</td></tr><tr><td>VCreputation</td><td>0.7252</td><td>0.2046</td><td>0.2226***</td></tr><tr><td>VC experience</td><td>0.2922</td><td>-0.0824</td><td>0.1188**</td></tr><tr><td>VCnetwork</td><td>0.5800</td><td>0.1636</td><td>0.8906</td></tr><tr><td>VClimitedpartner</td><td>0.4308</td><td>0.1215</td><td>0.3099</td></tr><tr><td>Early stage</td><td>-0.2466</td><td>-0.0696</td><td>0.0439***</td></tr><tr><td>High tech</td><td>-0.0535</td><td>0.0151</td><td>0.0343</td></tr><tr><td>Priorpatent</td><td>-0.0053</td><td>-0.0015</td><td>0.0238</td></tr><tr><td>OUTCOMEEQUATION</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>GVC</td><td>0.1086</td><td></td><td>0.0645*</td></tr><tr><td>VCreputation</td><td>0.1137</td><td></td><td>0.0492**</td></tr><tr><td>VC experience</td><td>0.0922</td><td></td><td>0.0298***</td></tr><tr><td>VCnetwork</td><td>0.1607</td><td></td><td>0.2982</td></tr><tr><td>VC limited partner</td><td>0.1508</td><td></td><td>0.0834*</td></tr><tr><td>Early stage</td><td>-0.3096</td><td></td><td>0.0537***</td></tr><tr><td>High tech</td><td>0.1124</td><td></td><td>0.0482**</td></tr><tr><td>Priorpatent</td><td>1.0761</td><td></td><td>0.0351***</td></tr><tr><td>Funding size</td><td>0.0129</td><td></td><td>0.0400</td></tr><tr><td>Stagedinvestment</td><td>0.0378</td><td></td><td>0.0713</td></tr><tr><td>Investorsize</td><td>0.1662</td><td></td><td>0.0951***</td></tr><tr><td>Mixedsyndication</td><td>0.0297</td><td></td><td>0.0441</td></tr><tr><td>Mixed co-financing</td><td>-0.1020</td><td></td><td>0.0185</td></tr><tr><td>LocalR&D</td><td>0.1595</td><td></td><td>0.0843***</td></tr><tr><td>Legal protection</td><td>-0.0243</td><td></td><td>0.0243</td></tr><tr><td>(Intercept)</td><td>0.6770</td><td></td><td>0.3717</td></tr><tr><td>Region dummies</td><td></td><td>Yes</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Year dummies</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VARIANCE</td><td></td><td>Yes</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Covariance</td><td>0.1231</td><td>3328</td><td>0.0575**</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table reports the Bayesian estimates of the additional structural model. The dependent variable in the valuation equation is the economic valuation of a match between a VC and a company, which is a latent variable. The dependent variable in the outcome equation is Patent, which measures the innovative outcome of the match. The Covariance represents the correlation between the error terms in the valuation equation and outcome equation. MEAN and Std. Err. are the mean and standard deviation of the simulated posterior distributions of the parameters, respectively. dP/dW is the marginal change in the probability of preferring one of two otherwise identical matches with a change in the variable. \\*, \\*\\*, and \\*\\*\\* denote statistical significance at the $10\\%$ $5\\%$ and $1\\%$ levels, respectively. Definitions of the variables are presented in Appendix A.  \n\nof companies would be recognized in the economic valuation, so the error term in the valuation equation would be positive. Given that potential innovativeness contributes to post-investment innovative performance, the error term in the outcome equation would also be positive. Therefore, the covariance between the error terms would be positive in this case.  \n\nOn the other hand, some studies have found that VCs are less likely to fund innovative projects because such projects usually require a longer investment return time and bear higher risks of failure (Manso, 2011; Chemmanur et al., 2014). Hence, the incentive of VC fund managers to build their reputations and the time pressure in performance assessment may distort their business policies in favor of relatively safe projects (Hirshleifer and Thakor, 1992). In this case, the potential innovativeness of companies may be considered detrimental; thus, the error term in the valuation equation would be negative. Given that potential innovativeness contributes to post-investment innovative performance, the error term in the outcome equation would be positive. Therefore, the covariance between the error terms would be negative in this case.  \n\nThe regression results in Table 5 show that the covariance of error terms is -0.1231 and is statistically significant at the $5\\%$ level. The negative sign of covariance supports the latter case in the preceding arguments, indicating that on average VCs prefer companies with lower potential innovativeness. This finding may be attributed to the institutional context of the Chinese IPO market, where the IPO applicants must pass strict checks of financial criteria in terms of revenue and profitability. Under the approval-based marketaccess system, traditional manufacturing companies occupy more than half of the market, while a large number of innovative companies find it hard to go IPO due to their low profitability (Liu et al., 2022). Meanwhile, the regression results of the valuation equation in Table 5 show that companies prefer PVCs to GVCs. Taken together, the revealed preferences indicate that PVCs match to companies with lower potential innovativeness compared to GVCs. In other words, GVCs match to potentially innovative companies.15  \n\n### 5.3.The impacts of GVCs on companies’post-investment performance  \n\nIn the preceding sections, our results show that GVCs do not crowd out PVCs in the stage of investment selection and that they allocate funds to potentially innovative companies, meaning that GVCs bridge the equity gap left by PVCs in innovative companies. In this section, we focus on the post-investment stage and investigate the impacts of GVCs on companies’ post-investment economic and innovativeperformance.  \n\n#### 5.3.1. Post-investment economic performance  \n\nThe outcome equation in Table 3 helps identify the causal effect of GVCs on companies' post-investment economic performance. This is because the valuation equation in Table 3 controls for the mutual selection between VC and company, and the MCMC-based Bayesian estimation provides a consistent estimate for both outcome and valuation equations. The coefficient for GvC in the outcome equation is insignificant, even at the $10\\%$ level, indicating that GVCs are not significantly different from PVCs in promoting companies rates of successful exit. Our result is inconsistent with some existing China-based evidence, which shows that the postinvestment economic performance of GVC-funded companies is inferior to PVC-funded ones. Among these studies, Ke and Wang (2021) define GVC in a very similar way to ours. When we adopt a Logit model as they did, we obtain an identical result (Table 4) to theirs.  \n\nOur result is also inconsistent with some existing evidence from the European market, which shows that the post-investment economic performance of GVC-funded companies is inferior to PVC-funded ones (Grilli and Murtinu, 2014, 2015). Below are some plausible reasons. (1) While Chinese GVC managers are also subject to relatively “fixed\" pay structure, they have a stronger incentive to improve company economic performance than their European peers. This is because Chinese GVC managers have the opportunity to obtain “political promotion\". In China, the board director or CEO of a SOEs, including a GVC, can be elevated to leadership roles within government departments (Zheng et al., 2012).16 (2) In China, GVCs ability to monitor and nurture funded companies differs remarkably from their European peers. To preserve and increase the value of state-owned assets and to prevent the loss of state-owned assets, the daily operation of the GVCs and their funded companies is under close monitoring of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC) (Zhang and Mayes, 2018). Such a high level of government intervention in economic activities is beyond the reach of most governments of European countries. (3) GVCs emerged and developed earlier than PVCs in China, so GVCs are competent players in the market. Shenzhen Capital Group Co. Ltd. is an excellent example of an early and competent GVC. (4) The examination and verification system/regulation on the IPO application screening process in China grants GVCs the opportunity to use their political resources to help funded companies obtain IPO qualifications (Wang and Wu, 2020). However, Chinese GVCs also have multiple disadvantages that may limit their abilities to provide value-added services, due to strict regulations and limited discretion in investment decision-making (Zhang and Mayes, 2018). Integrating the advantages and disadvantages of GVCs, it is plausible to find that in our study both GVCs and PVCs exhibit a resemblance in their capacity to enhance companies? economic performance, as gauged by IPO/M&A outcomes. In sum, the difference between European and Chinese GVCs' performance could be attributed to their distinct institutional arrangement in the VC industry.  \n\nThe control variables in the outcome equation of Table 3 show some interesting results. The coefficient for VC experience is negative and significant at the $1\\%$ level, indicating that more experienced VCs decrease companies’ exit rates. This is counterintuitive but reasonable, considering the scarcest resource for VC is time (Wang and Wang, 2011). The result seems to suggest that the more projects the VCs participate in, the less time is distributed on each project on average and thus less value-added services are provided. The coefficient for Early stage is negative and significant at the $1\\%$ level, indicating that the earlier-stage companies are less likely to exit. The coefficient for High tech is positive and significant at the $5\\%$ level, indicating that the companies in high-tech industries are more likely to exit than companies in low-tech industries. The coefficient for Prior patent is positive and significant at the $10\\%$ level, indicating that more innovative companies are more likely to exit successfully. The coefficient for Funding size is positive and significant at the $1\\%$ level, showing that companies receiving more funding in the first round are more likely to exit later. The coefficient for Investor size is positive and significant at the $1\\%$ level, showing that a larger number of investors positively affects companies? exit rates, possibly due to the addition of information, resources, and expertise offered by multiple VCs. The coefficient for Exit condition is positive and significant at the $1\\%$ level, suggesting companies are more likely to achieve successful exits during times of favorable market conditions. Finally, the coefficient for Marketization is significantly negative, suggesting that companies in a province with a higher level of marketization have a lower chance of exiting. The finding is consistent with Suchard et al. (2023)'s study. It seems to imply that the intense IPO or M&A competition at the provincial level adversely affects a company's likelihood of successfully exiting the market in China.  \n\n#### 5.3.2. Post-investment innovative performance  \n\nThe outcome equation in Table 5 captures the causal effect of GVCs on companies’ post-investment innovative performance. The coefficient for GVC in the outcome equation is 0.1086 and significant at the $10\\%$ level, indicating that the GVCs perform better than PVCs in promoting companies post-investment innovative performance. This is consistent with Huang et al.

The coefficient for VC experience is negative and significant at the $1\\%$ level, consistent with the fact that VCs have limited time allocated to each project when they have many projects. The coefficient for VC limited partner is positive and significant at the $10\\%$ level. It suggests that VC firms structured as limited partnerships tend to outperform VC firms structured as limited liability companies in promoting post-investment innovative performance. The coefficient for Early stage is negative and significant at the $1\\%$ level, suggesting that the early-stage companies perform less favorably compared to their late-stage counterparts, perhaps because the probability of generating additional patent applications is higher than the probability of generating the first patent application after the company has gained experience in doing so (Cefis, 2003). The coefficient for High tech is positive and significant at the $5\\%$ level, indicating that the companies in the high-tech industries benefit more from VC investment in generating patent applications than their counterparts in the low-tech industries. The coefficient for Prior patent is positive and significant at the $1\\%$ level, confirming the positive effect of innovation experience on further patent creation. The coefficient for Investor size is positive and significant at the $1\\%$ level, showing that a larger number of investors positively affects companies innovative performance due to more knowledge and resources that the VC team may convey to the companies. Finally, the coefficient for Local R&D is positive and significant at the $1\\%$ level, confirming the knowledge spillover effect in a region (Acs et al., 2009).  \n\n### 5.4.

The coefficient for GVC2 in the valuation equation is significantly negative while the covariance of error terms is significantly positive, which means GVCs match to companies with inferior potential economic performance compared to PVCs. The evidence is consistent with Table 3, which suggests that GVCs do not crowd out PVCs in the stage of investment selection. The coefficient for GVC2 in the outcome equation is insignificant even at the $10\\%$ level. This finding also is consistent with Table 3, which indicates that GVCs are not significantly different from PVCs in promoting companies? post-investment economic performance. Finally, the effects of control variables, including VC experience, Early stage, High tech, Prior patent, Funding size, Investor size, Exit condition and Marketization are significant, which is consistent with the main results shown in Table 3.  \n\nTable 7 reports the regression results of the structural model, in which the outcome variable is post-investment innovative performance (i.e., Patent). The coefficient for GVC2 in the valuation equation is significantly negative, and the covariance of error terms is also significantly negative, indicating that GVCs match to companies with higher potential innovativeness than PVCs. In other words, GVCs allocate funding for innovative companies. The coefficient for GVC2 in the outcome equation is significantly positive, suggesting that the GVCs perform better than PVCs in promoting companies′ post-investment innovative performance. The results are consistent with Table 5. The effects of control variables, including VC reputation, VC experience, VC limited partner, Early stage, High tech, Prior patent, Investor size, and Local R&D are significant and consistent with the main results shown in Table 5.  \n\n#### 5.4.2. Redefined post-investment economic performance  \n\nTo test whether our results are robust to the definition of economic outcome, we redefine post-investment economic performance. Instead of using whether or not a company exits successfully through IPO or M&A by the end of the sample period as we did in the basic model (Table 3), we use two widely used variables, i.e., Exit2 and Exit3, to measure post-investment economic performance. Exit2 is a dummy variable that equals “1\" if the company exits successfully through IPO by the end of the sample period; otherwise, it equals “0\" (Gompers et al., 2010; Suchard et al., 2021). Exit3 is a dummy variable that takes the value of “1\" if the company exits successfully through IPO, M&A or secondary sales by the end of the sample period; otherwise, its value is $\\mathrm{{}^{\\circ}}$ .Secondarysales are sometimes  \n\nTable8 Robustness test based on alternative measurements of economic outcome.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"4\">Exit2</td><td colspan=\"4\">Exit3</td></tr><tr><td>MEAN</td><td>dP/dW</td><td>XP/IP</td><td>Std.

We rerun the structural models in Table 3. The results are reported inTable8.  \n\nThe left panel of Table 8 shows the regression results of the structural model, in which the outcome variable is Exit2. The right panel of Table 8 shows the regression results of the structural model, in which the outcome variable is Exit3. In both panels the coefficient for GVC in the valuation equation is significantly negative, and the covariance is significantly positive. The evidence is consistent with Table 3, indicating that GVCs do not crowd out PVCs in the stage of investment selection, and the potential economic performance of GVC-funded companies is inferior to that of PVC-funded companies. In both panels the coefficient for GVC in the outcome equation is insignificant even at the $10\\%$ level, which suggests that GVCs at the post-investment stage are not significantly different from PVCs in promoting companies’ economic performance. The above results indicate that our conclusion is robust to the definition of postinvestment economic performance.  \n\n#### 5.4.3. Redefined post-investment innovative performance  \n\nTo test whether our results are robust to the definition of innovative outcome, we redefine post-investment innovative performance. We use an alternative variable Patent2 to measure innovative performance. Patent2 is the logarithm of one plus the number of invention patent applications within two years after the first-round funding. The approval of invention patents follows a very rigorous procedure, and invention patents are deemed the most novel among the three types of patents in China ( Jia et al., 2019; Ke and Wang, 2021). We rerun the structural models in Table 5 and report the results in Table 9.  \n\nTable 9 shows the regression results of the structural model, in which the outcome variable is Patent2. The coefficient for GVC in the valuation equation is significantly negative and the covariance is also significantly negative, indicating that GVCs fund companies with higher potential innovativeness than PVCs. The coefficient for GVC in the outcome equation is significantly positive, suggesting that the GVCs perform better in promoting companies' post-investment innovative performance than PVCs.

Definitions of the variables are presented in Appendix A.  \n\n### 5.5.Heterogeneity analysis based on different types of GVCs  \n\nGiven that mixed ownership might differ from pure government ownership (Brander et al., 2015), we divide GVCs into two categories. If a GVC is wholly owned by government agencies or government-controlled business enterprises, we define it as a government-owned venture capital firm, denoted as GovC; otherwise, it is a government-supported venture capital firm, denoted as GSVC. We replace GVC in the basic regressions with GOVC and GSVC while keeping PVC as the control group. Then, we rerun the structural model in Table 3 and Table 5. The results are shown in Table 10 and Table 11.  \n\nTable 10 shows the regression results of the structural model, in which the outcome variable is Exit. In the valuation equation, the coefficient for GOvC is negative and significant at the $5\\%$ level. The negative sign indicates that GOvCs are not preferred by companies. The coefficient for GSVC is insignificant even at the $10\\%$ level, indicating that companies prefer GsVCs at the same level as PVCs. One plausible explanation for the finding is that the mixed ownership offsets the deficiencies of strict government control to some extent (Suchard et al., 2021), thereby making GSVCs competitive in attracting companies. The covariance between the error terms is positive, and significant at the $10\\%$ level. The positive sign of covariance means VCs prefer companies with better potential economic performance. Taken together, the revealed preferences indicate that GovCs match to the companies with inferior potential economic performance, while PVCs and GsvCs match to the companies with better potential economic performance. In other words, GOVCs do not crowd out PVCs while GSVCs do.  \n\nThe coefficients of GOVC and GSVC in the outcome equation also reveal some interesting results about post-investment economic performance. The coefficient for GOvC is insignificant even at the $10\\%$ level, suggesting that GOvCs are not significantly different from PVCs in promoting companies' post-investment economic performance. This result is consistent with that of Suchard et al. (2021). In addition, the coefficient for GSVC in the outcome equation is insignificant even at the $10\\%$ level, suggesting that GSVCs are not significantly different from PVCs in promoting companies’ post-investment economic performance. This finding differs from prior research that either indicates GsVCs superiority over PVCs (e.g., Suchard et al., 2021) or portrays them as inferior (e.g., Ke and Wang,  \n\nTable10 Heterogeneity analysis based on different types of GvCs: economic valuation and economic outcome.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>MEAN</td><td>dP/dW</td><td>XP/IP</td><td>Std.Err.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VALUATIONEQUATION GOVC</td><td>-0.3260</td><td>-0.0920</td><td></td><td>0.1662**</td></tr><tr><td>GSVC</td><td>0.2927</td><td>-0.0826</td><td></td><td>0.2429</td></tr><tr><td>VCreputation</td><td>0.6472</td><td>0.1826</td><td></td><td>0.1720***</td></tr><tr><td>VCexperience</td><td>-0.1890</td><td>-0.0533</td><td></td><td>0.0725***</td></tr><tr><td>VC network</td><td>0.1397</td><td>-0.0394</td><td></td><td>0.6823</td></tr><tr><td>VC limited partner</td><td>0.2928</td><td>0.0826</td><td></td><td>0.3355</td></tr><tr><td>Early stage</td><td>0.2544</td><td>-0.0718</td><td></td><td>0.0409***</td></tr><tr><td>High tech</td><td>-0.0592</td><td>-0.0167</td><td></td><td>0.0368</td></tr><tr><td>Prior patent</td><td>-0.0059</td><td>-0.0017</td><td></td><td>0.0249</td></tr><tr><td>OUTCOMEEQUATION</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>GOVC</td><td>-0.0383</td><td></td><td>-0.0136</td><td>0.0908</td></tr><tr><td>DASS</td><td>-0.1852</td><td></td><td>-0.0655</td><td>0.1203</td></tr><tr><td>VC reputation</td><td>0.0803</td><td></td><td>0.0284</td><td>0.0574</td></tr><tr><td>VCexperience</td><td>-0.1017</td><td></td><td>-0.0360</td><td>0.0338***</td></tr><tr><td>VCnetwork</td><td>0.2379</td><td></td><td>-0.0842</td><td>0.3689</td></tr><tr><td>VClimitedpartner</td><td>0.0932</td><td></td><td>0.0330</td><td>0.0941</td></tr><tr><td>Early stage</td><td>-0.4618</td><td></td><td>0.1634</td><td>0.0658***</td></tr><tr><td>High tech</td><td>0.1337</td><td></td><td>0.0473</td><td>0.0558**</td></tr><tr><td>Prior patent</td><td>0.0666</td><td></td><td>0.0236</td><td>0.0390*</td></tr><tr><td>Funding size</td><td>0.1593</td><td></td><td>0.0564</td><td>0.0272***</td></tr><tr><td>Stagedinvestment</td><td>0.0270</td><td></td><td>0.0096</td><td>0.0806</td></tr><tr><td>Investorsize</td><td>0.2434</td><td></td><td>0.0861</td><td>0.0458***</td></tr><tr><td>Mixedsyndication</td><td>0.1243</td><td></td><td>-0.0440</td><td>0.0942</td></tr><tr><td>Mixedco-financing</td><td>0.0956</td><td></td><td>0.0338</td><td>0.1059</td></tr><tr><td>Exit condition</td><td>0.0930</td><td></td><td>0.0329</td><td>0.0263***</td></tr><tr><td>Marketization</td><td>0.1516</td><td></td><td>-0.0537</td><td>0.0358***</td></tr><tr><td>(Intercept)</td><td>0.2310</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.4226</td></tr><tr><td>Region dummies</td><td></td><td>Yes</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Year dummies</td><td></td><td>Yes</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VARIANCE</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Covariance OBSERVATION</td><td>0.1778</td><td></td><td>0.0629 3328</td><td>0.0936*</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table reports the heterogeneity analysis of the basic structural model based on different types of GVCs, i.e., GOvC and GSVC.

The dependent variable in the valuation equation is the economic valuation of a match between a VC and a company, which is a latent variable.

Definitions of variables are presented in Appendix A.  \n\n2021) in this particular function. Our results based on the structural model add new evidence to the debate.  \n\nTable 11 shows the regression results of the structural model, in which the outcome variable is Patent. In the valuation equation, the coefficient for GovC is negative and significant at the $5\\%$ level, while the coefficient for GSVC is insignificantly even at the $10\\%$ level, indicating that GOVCs are less preferred by companies, and the GSVCs are similar to PVCs in terms of companies? preferences. This finding is consistent with the regression results in the valuation equation in Table 10. The covariance between the error terms in Table 11 is negative and significant at the $5\\%$ level, indicating that companies with lower potential innovativeness are preferred by VCs. Taken together, the revealed preferences indicate that GOvCs match to companies with higher potential innovativeness compared to GSVCs and PVCs. One plausible explanation is that pure government ownership encourages the GOVCs to focus more on the social mission of bridging the equity gap left by PVCs in innovative companies than GSVCs or PVCs (Suchard et al., 2021).  \n\nIn the outcome equation, the coefficient for GOVC is insignificant, indicating that GOVCs are not different from PVCs in spurring companies? post-investment innovative performance. The coefficient for GSVC is positive and significant at the $5\\%$ level, sugesting that GSVCs outperform PVCs in improving companies? post-investment innovative performance. These findings are new in the literature. The diverse network, complementary knowledge, and industrial expertise from the mixed ownership may explain GsVCs' outstanding performance in promoting companies’ innovations.  \n\n### 5.6. The impacts of co-investment between GVCs and PVCs  \n\nBai et al. (2022) find about $50\\%$ of public programs involved private investors. Given the prevalence of co-investment between GVCs and PVCs, Grilli and Murtinu (2014) present the first attempt to explicitly analyze whether the performance of GVC-backed (PVC-backed) companies could be improved by syndication activities or co-financing activities between GVCs and PVCs. Inspired by Grilli and Murtinu (2014)'s research, we control two variables, Mixed syndication and Mixed co-financing, in the basic models. As shown in Section 5.3, the impacts of both variables, Mixed syndication and Mixed co-financing, are insignificant. This evidence regarding Mixed syndication aligns with the findings of Pierrakis and Saridakis (2017), who focused on the association between mixed syndication and companies post-investment innovative performance. In this section, we further examine whether the leadership of co-investment would change the results. To this end, we decompose Mixed syndication and Mixed co-financing into four variables according to whether the lead VC firm is a GVC or a PVC.  \n\nThe new variables include the following: (1) GVC-led syndication is a dummy variable, which equals “1\" if a PVC invests in the first funding round ld by a GVC; otherwise, it equals \\*0. (2) PVC-ledsyndication is a dummy variable, which equals  if a GVC invests in the first funding round led by a PVC; otherwise, it equals “O\". (3) GVC-led co-financing is a dummy variable, which equals “1\" if a PVC invests in later rounds after the first funding round led by a GVC; otherwise,it equals $^{\\circ}$ ; (4) PVC-led co-financing equals “1\" if a GVC invests in later rounds after the first funding round led by a PvC; otherwise equals $\\mathrm{{}^{\\cdot6}0^{,}}$ . We replace Mixed syndication and Mixed cofinancing with these four new variables and rerun the regressions in Tables 3 and 5. The results are reported in Tables 12 and 13 respectively.  \n\nTable 12 shows the regression results of the structural model, in which the outcome variable is Exit. As shown in Table 12, the coefficients of GVC-led Syndication and PVC-led Syndication in the outcome equation are insignificant, suggesting that the intrinsic differences between GVCs and PVCs may offet the benefits of mixed syndication. Our evidence appears to be partly inconsistent with the pioneer study by Grilli and Murtinu (2014), which discovered that PVC-led syndication could boost the sales growth of funded companies using a European dataset. However, our evidence on PVC-led syndication aligns with Zhang (2018)'s findings, which also employed data from the Chinese VC market. As for the impact of co-financed investment, the coefficient for the variable GVC-led cofinancing in the outcome equation is positive and significant at the level of $10\\%$ ,implying that the exit probability of a GVC-backed company increases if a PVC investment occurs after the first round of funding led by a GVC. A possible explanation is that the conflict of interest between GVCs and PVCs becomes less serious if they invest in different rounds.  \n\nTable 13 shows the regression results of the structural model, in which the outcome variable is Patent.

Divergent investment objectives may offset the benefits of co-investment by GVCs and PVCs in their collaboration, because PVCs focus more on economic return, expect a shorter investment return time and are more risk averse than GVCs (Grilli and Murtinu, 2014). To our best knowledge, our work makes the first attempt to examine whether the impact of co-investment between GVCs and PVCs on companies' post-investment innovation activities depends on the types of lead investors.  \n\n### 5.7. The impacts of GVCs on companies in different stages of development  \n\nCompared to companies in the late stage of development, companies in the early stage of development bear higher risks, and are more likely to be neglected by private funds. This means that GVCs may be particularly beneficial in supporting early-stage companies (Grilli and Murtinu, 2015). In Section 5.1, our results already show that earlier-stage companies are less likely to be funded by PVCs, and more likely to be funded by GVCs. In this section, we further examine whether GVCs have a greater impact on the post-investment performance of early-stage companies compared to PVCs. Accordingly, we also investigate the impacts of GVCs on the post-investment performance of late-stage companies. To this end, we add two interaction terms $G V C\\times$ Earlystageand $G V C\\times L a t e$ stageintothe outcome equation of Table 3 and Table 5. Late stage is a new dummy variable, which equals 1” if the company is in the expansion or mature stage at the time of funding, and it takes the value of $\\mathbf{\\omega}^{\\scriptscriptstyle6}0^{\\scriptscriptstyle9}\\mathbf{\\gamma}$ in the seed or start-up stage. We report the regression results in Tables 14 and 15 respectively.  \n\nTable 14 shows the regression results of the structural model, in which the outcome variable is Exit. The coefficient for $G V C\\times E a r l y$ stage is insignificant even at the $10\\%$ level, suggesting that GVCs are not significantly different from PVCs in promoting the post  \n\nTable14 Impacts of GVCs on companies in different stages of development: economic outcome.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>MEAN</td><td>dP/dW</td><td>XP/IP</td><td>Std.

Overall, the findings in Tables 14 and 15 reveal a nuanced aspect of our baseline findings in Tables 3 and 5 about GVCs' effects on the post-investment economic and innovative performance of the funded companies - GVCs are more likely to improve the postinvestment performance of early-stage companies than late-stage companies.  \n\n## 6. Conclusion  \n\nThis paper investigates the effects of GVCs on supporting company innovation by answering two indivisible questions simultaneously: (1) Do GVCs crowd out PVCs in the stage of investment selection? and (2) What are the impacts of GVCs on the postinvestment performance of the funded companies compared to PVCs? We develop a two-sided matching structural model to investigate both questions simultaneously. Using Chinese VC market data from 2000 to 2020, the empirical results show that GVC-fund companies are those neglected by PVCs due to low expected economic returns, suggesting the crowding-out conjecture is not supported. Moreover, the evidence suggests that the potential innovativeness of GVC-funded companies is higher than that of PVC-funded companies, further confirming that GVCs bridge the equity gap left by PVCs in innovative companies. The results also show that in the post-investment stage, GVCs and PVCs exhibit similarities in enhancing companies' economic performance, measured by successful exit via IPO or M&A. Additionally, GVCs play a crucial role in fostering innovation among companies, leading to a higher number of patent applications generated than PVCs.  \n\nIn addition, our heterogeneity analysis on government-owned (GOVCs) and government-supported VCs (GSVCs) shows that, in the  \n\nTable15 Impacts of GvCs on companies in different stages of development: innovative outcome.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>MEAN</td><td>dP/dW</td><td>Std.Err.</td></tr><tr><td>VALUATIONEQUATION</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>GVC</td><td>-0.3090 -0.0872</td><td>0.1275**</td></tr><tr><td>VC reputation</td><td>0.7108 0.2005</td><td>0.1649***</td></tr><tr><td>VCexperience</td><td>0.2210 -0.0623</td><td>0.0669***</td></tr><tr><td>VCnetwork</td><td>0.1654 0.0466</td><td>0.5495</td></tr><tr><td>VClimited partner</td><td>0.1676 0.0473</td><td>0.2058</td></tr><tr><td>Early stage</td><td></td><td>0.0368***</td></tr><tr><td>High tech</td><td>0.2579 -0.0728 -0.0545</td><td>0.0360</td></tr><tr><td>Priorpatent</td><td>0.0154</td><td>0.0240</td></tr><tr><td>OUTCOMEEQUATION</td><td>-0.0007 -0.0002</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>GVCxEarly stage 0.2002</td><td></td><td>0.1102*</td></tr><tr><td>GVCxLate stage</td><td>0.0719</td><td>0.0737</td></tr><tr><td>VCreputation</td><td>0.1152</td><td>0.0481**</td></tr><tr><td>VCexperience</td><td>-0.0889</td><td>0.0286***</td></tr><tr><td>VCnetwork</td><td>0.1976</td><td>0.2924</td></tr><tr><td>VC limited partner</td><td>0.1438</td><td>0.0820*</td></tr><tr><td>Early stage</td><td>-0.3365</td><td>0.0587***</td></tr><tr><td>High tech</td><td>0.1100</td><td>0.0483**</td></tr><tr><td>Priorpatent</td><td>1.0756</td><td>0.0352***</td></tr><tr><td>Funding size</td><td>0.0125</td><td>0.0240</td></tr><tr><td>Stagedinvestment</td><td>0.0391</td><td>0.0720</td></tr><tr><td>Investor size</td><td>0.1638</td><td>0.0403***</td></tr><tr><td>Mixed syndication</td><td>0.0357</td><td>0.0840</td></tr><tr><td>Mixed co-financing</td><td>0.1019</td><td>0.0946</td></tr><tr><td>Local R&D</td><td>0.1589</td><td>0.0439***</td></tr><tr><td>Legal protection</td><td>-0.0238</td><td>0.0184</td></tr><tr><td>(Intercept)</td><td>-0.6691</td><td>0.3676</td></tr><tr><td>Region dummies</td><td>Yes</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Year dummies</td><td>Yes</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VARIANCE</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Covariance</td><td>0.1221</td><td>0.0560**</td></tr><tr><td>OBSERVATION</td><td>3328</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table reports the heterogenous analysis of the additional structural model by examining the impacts of GVCs on companies in different stages of development. The dependent variable in the valuation equation is the economic valuation of a match between a VC and a company, which is a latent variable. The dependent variable in the outcome equation is Patent, which measures the innovative outcome of the match. The Covariance represents the correlation between the error terms in the valuation equation and the outcome equation. MEAN and Std.

Definitions of variables are presented in Appendix A.  \n\nstage of investment selection GOVCs do not crowd out PVCs and they bridge the equity gap left by PVCs, but GSVCs compete against PVCs. In the post-investment stage, both GOVCs and GSVCs are not significantly different from PVCs in promoting companies′ economic performance. However, GSVCs outperform PVCs and GOVCs in nurturing companies? innovation after investment. Overall, these novel findings indicate that higher government ownership leads to a higher level of social mission fulfillment in the stage of investment selection, but mixed ownership with private funding helps reduce the potential negative effects of government ownership in fostering firm innovation after investment. Both findings provide fresh insights into the existing literature concerning the influence of GVCs' ownership structure on company innovation.  \n\nMoreover, this study examines the effects of co-investment between GVCs and PVCs, encompassing mixed syndication and mixed co-financing. We find that the company's post-investment economic performance may be enhanced by co-investment between GVCs and PVCs, but only when a GVC leads the first-round funding while PVCs co-finance in later rounds. The novel findings also suggest that if GVCs and PVCs co-invest in the first funding round, their intrinsic differences may offset the benefits of syndication. In addition, we find that co-investment, either in the format of syndication or co-financing, cannot improve the company's post-investment innovativeperformance.  \n\nFurthermore, this study examines the heterogeneous impacts of GVCs on companies in different stages of development. Our findings indicate that early-stage companies are more likely to be funded by GVCs than late-stage companies. In addition, GVCs' positive impact on the post-investment innovative performance is particularly strong for early-stage companies. The findings imply that GVCs play a constructive role in bolstering the post-investment innovative performance of early-stage companies. Our study also recognizes the limitation of GVCs' effects in enhancing the post-investment economic performance of late-stage companies.  \n\nThis research and its findings bear important empirical implications. First, our findings justify the significant amount of investment by governments in the context of Chinese GVCs. Despite the Chinese government's significant intervention in the economy and the strong incentive and capabilities of GVCs to seek high economic returns in their investments, this paper does not present evidence of GVCs crowding out PVCs. The evidence shows that matches with PVCs have higher valuations and are ranked higher in companies’ preferences.  \n\nSecond, the sophisticated empirical results confirm that the assessment of GVCs appropriateness should start from their original purpose, i.e., funding those companies neglected by private investment. Besides comparing the post-investment economic and innovative performance of GVC-funded companies and PVC-funded companies, scholars and practitioners should also investigate whether GVCs have supported those innovative companies neglected by PVCs due to low expected economic returns. GVCs should not be criticized simply because the post-investment performance of GVC-funded companies is lower than that of PVC-funded ones.  \n\nThird, our findings on the heterogeneous effects of GOvCs and GSVCs suggest that government agencies could adjust GVCs' ownership to serve different purposes. To address the equity gap left by PVCs in innovative companies, government agents should establish a GOvC with a pure government ownership in the investment. However, if the primary purpose is to improve companies? post-investment innovative performance, government agents should invite private equity to form a GsVC, as such mixed ownership may better nurture company innovation.  \n\nFourth, our findings pertinent to the effects of co-investment between GVCs and PVCs suggest that both GVCs and PVCs should consider the sequence and leadership of co-investment with each other. For instance, GVCs that led the first-round funding could consider inviting PVCs to co-invest in later rounds to help improve companies′ economic performance. In addition, the findings regarding the heterogeneous impacts of GVCs on companies in different stages of development encourage GVCs to continue their financial support to early-stage ventures, as those ventures benefit more from GVC investment.  \n\nDespite many merits, the two-sided matching structural model suffers from some limitations that have been recognized in prior studies, and this leaves unanswered questions for future research. First, as a classical model of college admission, our two-sided matching model assumes that VCs and companies have complete information about the VC market. The simplified assumption opens a window for future studies to consider incomplete information (Bikhchandani, 2014). Second, the computational complexity of the structural model, by its nature, necessitates some compromises in the specification of the estimated model. For instance, constrained by computational tractability, we could not include interaction terms in the model (Sorensen, 2007). Future research may study the joint effects of the variables (Fox et al., 2018). Finally, the structural model applied in this study is a classical, one-to-many, two-sided matching model, and thus our conclusion is based on the gains of the lead VCs. Future studies may use the most recent manyto-many two-sided matching model and consider the investment decisions of multiple VCs (Fox et al., 2018).  \n\n## Data availability  \n\nData will be made available on request.  \n\n## Acknowledgements  \n\nWe thank the constructive comments and suggestions from the Editor and the anonymous referee.

In this study, we set out an estimation framework designed to explore whether the spatial-temporal compression effect of HSR has paved the way for the Fourth Industrial Revolution characterized by urban technological innovation and whether HSR has strengthened the technology spillovers from venture capital (VC). The principal findings are as follows: First, the opening of HSR can strengthen urban technological performance, and compared with non-HSR cities, the number of patent applications is higher in HSR cities. Second, considering the heterogeneity of technological innovation, and the results show that the opening of HSR can significantly promote the breakthrough innovation and incremental innovation of cities, and has a more significant impact on the breakthrough innovation. Finally, VC has a highly significant and positive effect on urban technological performance. More notably, our findings suggest that the opening of HSR has a considerable shock effect on the technology spillovers from VC. This study has great practical significance for analyzing the impact of HSR on the transformation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution characterized by urban technological performance.  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nThe Fourth Industrial Revolution, driven by new technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, and robotics, has brought profound changes to all aspects of human society (Alam et al., 2020; Su et al., 2020). High-speed rail (HSR) can help speed up the transformation from third to the Fourth Industrial Revolution. As a rapidly expanding new transport mode, HSR has been a focal element of transport policies in many countries and inevitably exerts significant influences on cities and regions (Zhang et al., 2019; Bracaglia et al., 2020). In China, the achievements of HSR have attracted worldwide attention. Since the first HSR line opened in 2008, China's HSR construction has been at the forefront of the world. For example, the total operating mileage of HSR in China increases from 5.13 thousand kilometers in 2010 to 35.00 thousand kilometers in 2019, which is far surpassing any other countries (see Fig. 1). The number of bullet trains in China also increases from 4.41 thousand units in 2010 to 29.32 thousand units in 2019, with a nearly sevenfold increase (see Fig. 2). By the end of 2019, the passenger volume of HSR has accounted for $63.8\\%$ of railwaypassenger volume in 2019 (see Fig. 2). The opening of HSR has dramatically shortened the geographical distance between cities, reshaped the pattern of regional economic growth, and improved the urban innovation capacity inChina.  \n\nHSR can further shorten the temporal-spatial distance and improve the accessibility of cities, which may break the constraint of distance on the urban development and further affect the urban technological innovation (Li et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019a). Besides, venture capital (VC), as a particular financing method, is characterized by geographical clustering and geographical proximity (Chen et al., 2010; Guenther et al., 2018; Tian et al., 2020a; Tian et al., 2020b). In particular, China's VC institutions mainly concentrate in some developed cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou (Long and Li, 2016). However, as the geographic distance between VC institutions and enterprises increases, the resource allocation efficiency of VC will be reduced, and the cost of information exchange between VC institutions and enterprises will be increased. Therefore, VC institutions prefer to invest the enterprises that are close to them (Belderbos et al., 2018). However, with the opening of HSR, the temporal-spatial distance between cities are further compressed, and VC institutions can easily faceto-face communication with and conduct field visits to enterprises in  \n\n![](images/90a22503b579a59d77c8fcadb87fbb09389b5f4d8496a4c05b92b66e4a508f3d.jpg)  \nFig. 1.

Thus, it is of great practical significance to explore whether HSR affects the transformation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution characterized by urban technological performance.  \n\nIn recent years, some prior studies focus on discussing the influence of HSR to the economy and society, such as the regional economy (Dong, 2018; Bracaglia et al.,2020; Guira0 et al., 2020), the aviation industry (Chen and Wang, 2019; Li et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019b), the road and maritime transport (Calatayud et al., 2017; Aydin et al., 2018; Amin et al., 2019), the traveling time (Albalate & Fageda, 2016), and so on.Moreover, a growing number of studies explore the effect of transportation on innovation (de la Tour et al., 201l; Dong, 2018). However, to the best of our knowledge, remain limited studies have analyzed the effects of HSR in the transformation towards the Fourth Industrial Revolution characterized by urban technological performance (Ga0 and Zheng, 2020; Ji and Yang, 2020). Furthermore, up to now, far too little attention has been paid to investigate the HSR shock on the technology spillovers from VC, despite many studies investigating the determinants of innovation,such as R&D activities (Gao and Zheng, 2020), VC investment (Bertoni and Tykvova, 2015; Alvarez-Garrido and Dushnitsky, 2016). Hence, this study contributes to the literature by analyzing the impact of HSR on urban technological performance and investigating the HSR shock on the technology spil lovers of VC to cities.  \n\nThis study takes the opening of HSR as a quasi-natural experiment, and the main reasons are as follows: On the one hand, the construction of HSR is a national strategy, which is planned by the central government in China, but VC institutions and local governments cannot influence on the opening time and lines of HSR (Long et al., 2017). On the other hand, the Chinese HSR network mainly takes central cities such as municipalities, provincial capital cities, and sub-provincial cities as regional centers. In contrast, the opening of HSR in the non-central cities is primarily affected by the central cities, and the innovation capacity of these cities is not the main reason for HSR.  \n\nThis study, therefore, set out to assess the effect of HSR on urban technological performance and the technology spillovers from VC to cities using the panel data of 277 municipal-level cities in China from 2005 to 2017. The contributions of this study are given as follows: (1) We take the opening of HSR as a shock variable to investigate the impact of HSR on urban technological performance using the propensity matching score (PSM) and difference-in-difference (DID) methods. (2) We consider the heterogeneity of technological performance and divide it into breakthrough innovation and incremental innovation. We also provide empirical evidence of the impact of HSR and VC on them. (3)  \n\nWe further examine whether HSR affects the technology spillovers from VC to cities; that is, whether the impact of VC on urban technological performance is affected by the opening of HSR.  \n\nThe rest of this study is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the theoretical analysis and research hypothesis. Section 3 describes the research design, including data sources, methods, and variables. Section 4 presents the empirical analysis. Section 5 gives a further analysis of the impact of HSR on the technology spillovers from VC, and finally, the conclusions and discussions are presented in Section 6.  \n\n## 2. Theoretical analysis and research hypothesis  \n\n### 2.1. HSR and urban technological performance  \n\nThe technological innovation is a complicated systematic project, and it is also considered as a vital driving force for achieving highquality economic growth and the core of realizing the Fourth Industrial Transformation (Wadhwa et al., 2016). Urban technological innovation refers to the city's ability to transform new knowledge into new products, new processes, and new services. Its core is to promote the interaction and connection between innovative institutions, which is manifested as the contribution to the urban social and economic system (Wadhwa et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2018). The technological performance is usually measured by the number of patent applications, which can be divided into two sides: breakthrough innovation and incremental innovation (Clausen and Pohjola, 2013; Lahr and Mina, 2016). From the results of innovation, incremental innovation can be achieved easily through low-technology innovation, but only breakthrough innovation can represent high-quality innovation (Yueh,2009; Long and Wang, 2019). Besides, the urban innovation ability determines China's overall innovation ability to a great extent. Whereas, it is influenced by many factors, among which the distance between cities affects the flow of the urban innovation resources (Dong, 2018; Guenther et al., 2018). The spatial-temporal compression effect brought by HSR can significantly improve the accessibility level of cities. It may reshape the spatial structure and economic distribution of the urban elements, thereby may change the innovation pattern of the existing cities (Albalate and Bel, 2012).  \n\nHSR may improve the accessibility and location advantage of cities (Xu et al., 2018). The construction of HSR can promote the scale of infrastructure construction along the routes and the development of related high-tech industries, such as electronics and information. Thus a large amount of capital investment can directly promote urban economic growth (Donaldson and Hornbeck, 2016). Also, HSR can compress the spatial-temporal distance between cities, and significantly reduce the commuter cost (e.g., the transport expense, the travel and waiting time, or the utility cost of the trip), and logistics transportation cost between different cities (Kong et al., 2020). In this way, HSR not only enables producers or consumers to purchase high-quality services at lower cost from further enterprises or cities, but also make it easier for enterprises to hold higher profits from broader markets that are previously unavailable (Zhang et al., 2020). Moreover, HSR can lessen the degree of information asymmetry, which is conducive to VC and other capital to layout in long-distance cities with HSR and stimulate economic growth. In summary, the opening of HSR may improve the location advantage and attracts related industries and vC, which indirectly promotes economic growth and provides the necessary economic conditions for the urban technological innovation (Ye et al., 2020).  \n\nHSR can speed up the flow of human capital. The HSR network has become an essential channel for the rapid flow of elements between cities, which dramatically improves the mobility of human capital (Li et al., 2019). While the rapid flow of human capital is accompanied by the fast-moving and diffusion of production factors such as technology and capital, thus affecting urban technological innovation. Besides, the opening of HSR significantly shortens the travel time between cities, reduces the time cost of talent flow, and improves the exchange efficiency of innovative talents (Li et al., 2019). More importantly, the cross-regional flow of creative talents can promote technological exchange and knowledge spillover, which provides the necessary talent conditions for urban innovation (Ye et al., 2020).  \n\nTherefore, we propose the following hypotheses:  \n\nHypothesis 1: HSR has a positive impact on urban technological performance.   \nHypothesis 2: HSR has different influences on breakthrough innovation and incremental innovation.  \n\n### 2.2. VC and urban technological performance  \n\nVC plays a crucial role in promoting technological innovation in cities. VC can not only help enterprises to soften their financial difficulties, but also bring value-added services to entrepreneurial enterprises with its investment experience (Sonne, 2012; Wen et al., 2018; Zhang and Mayes, 2018b; Zhang et al., 2018a). Besides, VC, as a particular equity financing channel, provides financial support for emerging enterprises with development potential and promotes the rapid development and growth of enterprises (Cao et al.,2014; Belderbos et al., 2018; Takahashi et al., 2018). VC can also fund to support technological innovation and project development activities, such as R&D, patent application., and promote the improvement of technological innovation, such as the number of patents, paper trademarks, and new products (Wu and Xu, 2020).  \n\nFurthermore, VC can influence urban technological innovation through avalue-addedservice mechanism (Popov and Roosenboom, 2012; Lahr and Mina, 2016). On the one hand, VC has extensive investment experience, in-depth research, and prediction of the industry development prospects. It can develop a suitable development model through strategic planning to provide advanced technology, products, and services for entrepreneurial enterprises (Devigne et al., 2013). On the other hand, as the main body of technological innovation, enterprises can utilize the VC's resources and experiences, such as extensive social relations, industrial club contacts, and bank relations, to optimize the allocation of resources and maximize the utility of VC. Also, VC can help enterprises to optimize the business structure and capital flow of enterprises, especially the optimal allocation of R&D funds, and support the research of core technology innovation and patent application. In short, VC can improve technological performance in cities by promoting the enterprises’ technological innovation (Wen et al., 2018).  \n\nMore recent attention has focused on the impact of VC on technological performance, and different results have been concluded. Most studies have revealed that VC has a significantly positive on technological innovation (Sun et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2020a). However, some studies have concluded that VC has a negative effect or no effect on technological innovation (Zucker et al.,1998; Ni et al., 2014; Lahr and Mina, 2016), but these conclusions are relatively rare.  \n\nTherefore, we propose the following hypothesis:  \n\nHypothesis 3: VC has a positive impact on urban technological performance.  \n\n### 2.3. HSR and VC's technology spillovers  \n\nThe opening of HSR is a vital exogenous variable affecting the urban technological innovation by VC. Most VC institutions have a preference for geographical proximity and tend to invest in cities that are close to each other (Gompers and Lerner, 1999; Fritsch and Schilder, 2008). However, with the opening of HSR, the temporal and spatial distances between cities are further compressed, and vC institutions can conveniently communicate and investigate with enterprises in HSR cities (Bernstein et al., 2016). HSR also can strengthen the flexibility of faceto-face communication between VC institutions and enterprises, and effectively improve the operating efficiency of VC institutions. In particular, the opening of HSR has changed the investment preference of VC in neighboring regions (Bernstein et al., 2016). Thus, HSR can influence the distribution of VC institutions and then influence urban technological innovation and regional economic development (Guenther et al., 2018).  \n\nHSR can effectively improve the resource allocation efficiency of VC and enterprises and achieve Pareto efficiency (Bernstein et al., 2016). Allocative efficiency refers to the optimal combination of input factors to produce the “optimal\" combination of product quantity. Under the condition of constant input, the optimal combination and effective allocation of resources will improve the efficiency and increase the output. After the opening of HSR, the spatial-temporal distance between VC institutions and enterprises has been dramatically changed, which makes it more convenient for VC to fully understand the information of enterprises, rationally optimize resources and allocation, and provide the allocation efficiency of VC (Bernstein et al., 2016; Tian et al., 2020a).  \n\nFurther, HSR can reduce the cost of information exchange and communication between VC institutions and enterprises to a certain extent, and improve the flexibility of communication (Bernstein et al., 2016). Thereby, it can decrease the moral hazard and adverse selection caused by information asymmetry, accelerate the generation and development of enterprise technological innovation, and thus improve urban technological innovation and the VC's technology spillovers.  \n\nTherefore, we propose the following hypothesis:  \n\nHypothesis 4: HSR has a positive effect on VC's technology spillovers.  \n\n## 3. Research design  \n\n### 3.1. Data  \n\nTo examine the impact of HSR on urban technological performance and the VC's technology spillovers, this study selects the panel data of 277 Chinese cities from 2005 to 2017 as samples. For the selection of samples, some cities without VC projects are excluded, and finally, the sample consists of a total of 3601 city-year observations with VC projects.  \n\nWe apply the number of patents (e.g., invention, utility model, and design) to measure urban technological performance, and the data are collected from the Chinese Research Data Services Platform (CNRDS) (https://www.cnrds.com). We calculate the number and investment amount of VC projects in each city according to the cities where the invested enterprises are registered, and the data are collected from the Wind database (https://www.wind.com.cn). The data of HSR is collected from the CNRDS, including the HSR station and the first opening time of HSR. The other variables, such as the economic development level, industrial structure, marketization, and financial deepening, are from the Wind database and CSMAR (http://www.gtarsc.com). Besides, in the process of data, we eliminate some city samples due to too much missing data, and some data missing in individual years are supplemented by linear interpolation.  \n\nTable 1 presents the distribution of VC projects by regions. The results show that the number of VC projects in the eastern cities with HSR reaches 17,903, accounting for more than $80\\%$ of the total investment events. This points out that the VC projects mainly concentrate in eastern cities with HSR, while there are few VC projects in central and western cities.  \n\nTable1 The regional distribution of VC (2005-2017).   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Regions</td><td>HSR city</td><td>Non-HSR city</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>East</td><td>17,903</td><td>432</td><td>18,335</td></tr><tr><td>Central</td><td>1107</td><td>248</td><td>1355</td></tr><tr><td>West</td><td>1212</td><td>176</td><td>19,690</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>20,222</td><td>856</td><td>21,078</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNote: According to the scope defined in the Regional Development Plan approved by the state in China, the eastern region contains 11 provinces: Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Liaoning, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, Guangdong, and Hainan. The central region includes eight provinces: Heilongjiang, Jilin, Shanxi, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei, and Hunan. The western region consists of 12 provinces: Inner Mongolia, Guangxi, Chongqing, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Xinjiang, and Tibet.  \n\n### 3.2.Methods  \n\n#### 3.2.1. Sample matching and endogeneity processing  \n\nThis study uses the DID method to explore the impact of HSR on urban technological performance and VC's technology spillovers. Two fundamental problems cannot be ignored, including the absence of “counterfactual sample data” and endogenous problem. Furthermore, the DID method requires the selected samples to satisfy the “common trend\"hypothesis and to prevent the choice of samples in the treatment group and the control group from producing the problem of “selective bias”(Khandker et al.,201o).To avoid the influence of the above problems, this study uses the full-sample regression and PSM method to match the treatment group and the control group (Baum and Silverman, 2004). The full-sample regression takes all non-HSR cities as the matching objects of HSR cities, which can solve the missing data of counterfactual samples but cannot solve the problem of endogeneity. While the PSM method can effectively solve the endogenous problem. In other words, it is assumed that the treatment group and the control group are similar or similar in other aspects except whether HSR is opened or not. By comparing the difference in technological performance between the treatment group and the control group, we can investigate the impact of HSR on urban technological performance. Therefore, the cities that have opened HSR are taken as the treatment group, and the cities that have not opened HSR as the control group to test the impact of the exogenous variable of HSR on urban technological performance.  \n\nFor the PSM method, this study selects the control variables as the feature variable to construct the control group by the 1:1 nearest matching method, and uses the logit regression to calculate the opening probability of the HSR, that is, the propensity score (PS) value. The model is defined as follows:  \n\n$$\np(X_{i})=\\operatorname*{Pr}[h s r_{i}=1|\\mathbf{X}_{i}]=\\frac{\\exp(\\beta\\mathbf{X}_{i})}{1+\\exp(\\beta\\mathbf{X}_{i})}\n$$  \n\nwhere $p(X_{i})$ is the propensity score; $\\mathbf{X}_{i}$ is the feature variable vector affecting the opening of HSR for each city, including per capita GDP, industrial structure, market index, and the number of IPO (Initial Public Offering); $\\beta$ is the coefficient of the feature variable vector; $h s r_{i}$ is the indicator variable, and $h s r_{i}$ is set to one if the city opens the HSR, otherwise it is set to zero.  \n\nThe PS values for each city can be calculated using Eq. (1), and then the HSR cities in the treatment group can be matched with the most similar cities without HSR from the control group using the PS values. Thus, ATT (average treatment effect on the treated) can be used to evaluate the difference of technological performance between the treatment group and the control group, and to explore whether the opening of HSR affects urban technological performance.  \n\n#### 3.2.2.DID method  \n\nAfter matching by the PSM method, the DID method is constructed to test the impact of HSR on urban technological performance. The model is set as follow:  \n\n$$\nY_{i t}=\\alpha_{i}+\\beta_{1}h s r_{i t}\\times a f t e r_{i t}+\\beta_{2}\\nu\\tilde{c}_{i t}+\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\lambda_{i}X_{i t}+\\delta_{t}+\\theta_{i}+\\varepsilon_{i t}\n$$  \n\nwhere, $Y$ represents urban technological performance (inno), breakthrough innovation (br_inno), and incremental innovation (incr_inno); hsr and after are the dummy variable, indicating whether the city opens HSR, and before or after the opening time of HSR, respectively; hsr $\\times$ after is the interaction term between the opening of HSR and the time after the opening of HSR, representing the difference of the impact of HSR on the treatment group and the control group; vc represents the variable of VC; $X$ represents the control variables, including economic development level, industrial structure, marketization level, and financial deepening degree; $\\beta_{1}$ and $\\beta_{2}\\cdot$ represents the coefficients of the explanatory variables; $\\lambda_{i}$ represents the coefficients corresponding to the control variables; i and t represent the city and year, respectively; $\\delta$ represents the time effect variable; $\\theta$ represents the city effect variable; $\\varepsilon_{i t}$ is a random error term.  \n\n### 3.3.Variables  \n\n#### 3.3.1. Technological performance  \n\nFollowingthestudiesofLahr andMina,(2016), Belderbos et al. (2018), and Tian et al. (2020a), this study adopts the number of patent applications to measure urban technological performance. The reason for selecting the patent application is that the government publicly grants patents on account of their novelty and utility, and the number of patent applications can be compared horizontally and vertically. Furthermore, according to the Patent Law of the People's Republic of China, patents mainly include three different types: invention, utility model, and design. Among them, the invention-type patent represents the core technical achievements and has a higher technical level (Tian et al., 2020a). Therefore, this study not only uses the total number of patent applications to evaluate urban technological performance, but also divide it into breakthrough innovation (br_inno) and incremental innovation (incr_inno) (Clausen and Pohjola, 2013). The breakthrough innovation is measured by the total number of invention-type patent applications, and the incremental innovation is measured by the total number of utility model and design patent applications (Clausen and Pohjola, 2013). All these variables are logarithmized for reducing the bias. Since the patent applications of some cities are zero, the logarithm is taken after adding one to all the above data.  \n\n#### 3.3.2. Explanatory variable  \n\nHSR is set as a dummy variable, and it includes whether the city opens HSR (hsr) and before or after the opening time of HSR (after). If the city opens the HSR, $h s r=1$ ,otherwise $h s r=0$ If the time after the opening of HSR for the city, after $=1$ ,otherwise after $=0$ . The opening of HSR is measured by whether the city has HSR stations, and the opening time of HSR is mainly based on the earliest year when the city opened the HSR.  \n\nVC is also an explanatory variable, which is measured by the number of VC (vc_num) and the total amount of VC (vc_mon), respectively. They are logarithmized after adding one to their values to reduce thebias.  \n\n#### 3.3.3.Control variables  \n\nThis study controls some variables that may affect urban technological performance, and they are defined as follows:  \n\n(1) Economic development (rgdp): It is defined by the logarithm of per  \n\nTable2 Descriptive statistics of all variables.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variable</td><td>Symbol</td><td>Obs</td><td>Mean</td><td>Std.Dev.</td></tr><tr><td>Technologicalperformance</td><td>inno</td><td>3601</td><td>6.585</td><td>1.840</td></tr><tr><td>Breakthroughinnovation</td><td>br_inno</td><td>3601</td><td>5.775</td><td>1.812</td></tr><tr><td>Incrementalinnovation</td><td>incr_inno</td><td>3601</td><td>4.940</td><td>1.964</td></tr><tr><td>HSR</td><td>hsr</td><td>3601</td><td>0.599</td><td>0.490</td></tr><tr><td>Opening time ofHSR</td><td>after</td><td>3601</td><td>0.312</td><td>0.464</td></tr><tr><td>Number ofVC</td><td>vc_num</td><td>3601</td><td>0.459</td><td>0.981</td></tr><tr><td>TotalamountofVC</td><td>vc_mon</td><td>3601</td><td>0.587</td><td>0.981</td></tr><tr><td>Economicdevelopment</td><td>rgdp</td><td>3601</td><td>10.274</td><td>0.744</td></tr><tr><td>Industrialstructure</td><td>struindu</td><td>3601</td><td>0.479</td><td>0.122</td></tr><tr><td>Marketizationdegree</td><td>market</td><td>3601</td><td>6.275</td><td>1.686</td></tr><tr><td>Financialdeepeningdegree</td><td>ipo</td><td>3601</td><td>0.209</td><td>0.521</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\ncapita GDP.  \n\n(2) Industrial structure (stru indu): It is defined by the output value of the secondary industry to GDP.   \n(3) Marketization degree (market): This study applies the marketization index of China's provinces proposed by Wang et al. (2017) to define the degree of marketization. The bigger the index value is, the higher the level of marketization will be.   \n(4) Financial deepening degree (ipo):It is defined by the logarithm of the number of IPOs in the city.  \n\nTable 2 presents the descriptive statistics of all variables.  \n\n## 4. Empirical analysis  \n\nIn this section, we conduct a series of empirical analyses on whether and how HSR affects urban technological performance and VC's technology spillovers to cities.Wefirstmatch theHSR cities and non-HSR cities using the PSM method in Section 4.1. And then, we carry on the empirical analysis using the DID method in Section 4.2.  \n\n### 4.1. Results of PSM  \n\nThis study uses the PSM method to match the HSR cities and nonHSR cities to ensure the reliability of the matching results. It is required that there is no systematic difference in the distribution of the covariables between the treatment group and the control group. Therefore, this study conducts the parallel trend test before the matching, that is, whether the covariables are significantly different between the treatment group and the control group. Fig. 3 presents the kernel density distribution before and after matching, and Table 3 reports the equilibrium test results of covariables.  \n\nAs can be seen from Fig. 3(a), before the matching, there is a significant difference in the kernel density function between the treatment group and the control group. In this case, if we directly select the HSR cities in the treatment group to compare with the non-HSR cities in the control group, the results may be biased. Besides, to the exogenous variable of HSR, there are significant differences in other factors between the two groups, which may have an impact on the technological innovation of cities. However, after PSM matching, as shown in Fig. 3(b), the kernel density distribution of the treatment group and the control group tends to coincide, indicating that the characteristics of the treatment group and the control group are similar after using the PSM.  \n\nThis study also carries out an equilibrium test for all covariables, and the results are shown in Table 3. We can find that, before matching, all the covariables, such as economic development (rgdp), industrial structure (stru_ indu), marketization degree (market), and financial deepening degree (ipo), are significant at the $5\\%$ level. This suggests that there is a significant difference between the treatment group and the control group before the PSM. In contrast, after PSM, all covariables are insignificant at the $5\\%$ level $\\mathrm{\\Delta}p$ values $>5\\%$ ), indicating that there is no significant difference between the treatment group and the control group. For the deviation values, all the absolute deviation values between the two groups are more significant than $5\\%$ before PSM, while they are all less than $5\\%$ after using the PSM method. Referring to the studies of Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983), the absolute deviation values are less than $5\\%$ ,and this also indicates that there is no significant difference between the two groups. In short, after PSM, the covariables are very similar between the treatment group and the control group, and the imbalance of all covariables is significantly reduced, which meets the requirements of the equilibrium test and can be compared between the two groups.  \n\n![](images/b3d373c291f1e18fd16f671e03fa28e64ec3ffdf77b5ca8a2987f18e17aa2c89.jpg)  \nFig. 3. Kernel density maps before and after matching.  \n\n### 4.2. Result analysis of DID  \n\nIn this subsection, we conduct an empirical analysis to examine the impact of HSR on urban technological performance, including the full sample DID analysis and PSM-DID analysis. The results are presents in Table 4. Among them, Columns (1), (3), and (5) are the results for the full sample DID analysis, and Columns (2), (4), and (6) are the results for PSM-DID analysis, respectively.  \n\n#### 4.2.1. The results for the full sample analysis  \n\nThe estimation results of the full sample analysis are shown in Columns (1), (3), and (5), respectively, and their explained variables are urban technological performance, breakthrough innovation, and incremental innovation, respectively. We can find from the results, as shown in Column (1), that the coefficient of $h s r\\times$ after is highly significant and positive (its value is 0.1090, $p$ value $<1\\%$ ,suggesting that compared with the non-HSR cities, the number of patent applications in the cities with HSR increases by $10.9\\%$ . This indicates that the opening of HSR can increase urban technological performance. For the breakthrough innovation and incremental innovation, as shown in Columns (3) and (4),the coefficients of hsr $\\times$ after are all significant and positive (the values are 0.1500 and 0.5320, respectively; $p$ -value $<$ $1\\%$ and $p$ value $<5\\%$ , respectively). These results show that compared with non-HSR cities, breakthrough innovation and incremental innovation also increase significantly after the opening of HSR, with an increase of $15\\%$ and $5.32\\%$ , respectively, and the impact on breakthrough innovation is more prominent than that on incremental innovation. The possible reason for the above results is that the opening of HSR can strengthen exchanges and cooperation among the cities, attract high-quality resources agglomeration such as venture capital, and promote the technological innovation ability of cities. In contrast, for the non-HSR cities, their poor transport infrastructure may further strengthen the loss of quality resources, and deteriorate the technological innovation.  \n\n#### 4.2.2. The results for PSM-DID analysis  \n\nTo accurately analyze the impact of HSR on urban technological performance, we have used the PSM method to match HSR cities and non-HSR cities in Section 4.1. In this subsection, we carry out the PSMDID regression analysis, and the results are presented in Columns (2), (4), and (6) of Table 4,respectively. We find that the coefficients of hsr $\\times$ after in three columns are all significant and positive (the values are 0.1100, 0.1660, and 0.0457, respectively; $p$ value $<1\\%$ $p$ -value $<$ $1\\%$ ,and $p$ value $<10\\%$ ,respectively), and the results are consistent with the full sample analysis in Section 4.2.1. This further illustrates that the opening of HSR plays a vital role in improving urban technological performance. Notably, compared with the non-HSR cities, the HSR cities have a higher output of technological innovation, including the breakthrough innovation and incremental innovation. However, for the breakthrough innovation (see Column (4)), the estimated value of hsr $\\times$ after significantly increases compared with the whole sample. This indicates that the impact of HSR on breakthrough innovation can be more genuinely reflected through the PSM-DID method. Besides, the coefficientofhsr $\\times$ after (see Column (6)) is significantly smaller than that of the full sample, which indicates that the DID analysis with the full sample will overestimate the direct processing effect of HSR on incremental innovation.  \n\nTable3 Results of equilibrium test using the PSM method.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variable</td><td>Matching</td><td>Mean Treated</td><td>Control</td><td>Deviation Deviation</td><td>Reduce rate</td><td>t-test t-value</td><td>p-value</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>rgdp</td><td>U M</td><td>10.691 10.675</td><td>10.085 10.687</td><td>91.40 -1.90</td><td></td><td>24.46 -0.48</td><td>0.000 0.628</td></tr><tr><td>indu_stru</td><td>U</td><td></td><td>0.482</td><td>-8.00</td><td>97.90</td><td>-2.15</td><td>0.032</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>0.473</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.24</td><td>0.812</td></tr><tr><td>market</td><td>M</td><td>0.477 7.034</td><td>0.476 5.931</td><td>1.00</td><td>87.80</td><td>19.10</td><td>0.000</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>U M</td><td>6.992</td><td>6.979</td><td>68.00 0.80</td><td>98.80</td><td>0.18</td><td>0.856</td></tr><tr><td>od</td><td>U</td><td>0.468</td><td>0.091</td><td>66.30</td><td></td><td>21.36</td><td>0.000</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>M</td><td>0.427</td><td>0.414</td><td>2.30</td><td>96.50</td><td>0.44</td><td>0.659</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: U is before PSM, and M is after PSM.  \n\nTable 4 Regression results of DID analysis.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variable</td><td colspan=\"2\">inno</td><td colspan=\"2\">br_inno</td><td colspan=\"2\">incr_inno</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>All samples</td><td>PSM</td><td>All samples</td><td>PSM</td><td>All samples</td><td>PSM</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td></tr><tr><td>hsrxafter</td><td>0.1090***</td><td>0.1100***</td><td>0.1500***</td><td>0.1660***</td><td>0.0532**</td><td>0.0457*</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(4.49)</td><td>(4.62)</td><td>(5.09)</td><td>(5.70)</td><td>(2.07)</td><td>(1.82)</td></tr><tr><td>vc_mon</td><td>0.0198**</td><td>0.0207**</td><td>0.0261**</td><td>0.0232***</td><td>0.0187**</td><td>0.0195**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(2.30)</td><td>(2.40)</td><td>(2.41)</td><td>(3.28)</td><td>(2.17)</td><td>(2.25)</td></tr><tr><td>vc_num</td><td>0.0145***</td><td>0.0226**</td><td>0.0249**</td><td>0.0270**</td><td>0.0101**</td><td>0.0229*</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(2.73)</td><td>(2.17)</td><td>(2.03)</td><td>(2.14)</td><td>(2.48)</td><td>(1.92)</td></tr><tr><td>rgdp</td><td>0.4180***</td><td>0.3820***</td><td>0.1940**</td><td>0.1020</td><td>0.4380***</td><td>0.4490***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(6.64)</td><td>(5.47)</td><td>(2.55)</td><td>(1.19)</td><td>(6.61)</td><td>(6.10)</td></tr><tr><td>stru_indu</td><td>-0.7630***</td><td>-0.9350***</td><td>-0.7250***</td><td>-1.0930***</td><td>-0.5660***</td><td>-0.5980***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(-4.44)</td><td>(-4.46)</td><td>(-3.48)</td><td>(-4.25)</td><td>(-3.13)</td><td>(-2.70)</td></tr><tr><td>market</td><td>0.0927***</td><td>0.0803***</td><td>0.1190***</td><td>0.1100***</td><td>0.0953***</td><td>0.0805***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(7.27)</td><td>(6.39)</td><td>(7.71)</td><td>(7.12)</td><td>(7.10)</td><td>(6.06)</td></tr><tr><td>ipo</td><td>-0.0768***</td><td>-0.0686***</td><td>-0.0556**</td><td>-0.0327</td><td>-0.0815***</td><td>-0.0739***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(-3.67)</td><td>(-3.29)</td><td>(-2.19)</td><td>(-1.28)</td><td>(-3.70)</td><td>(-3.36)</td></tr><tr><td>constant</td><td>0.4590</td><td>0.8260</td><td>0.8910</td><td>1.6760**</td><td>0.0860</td><td>0.0708</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.82)</td><td>(1.37)</td><td>(1.32)</td><td>(2.27)</td><td>(0.15)</td><td>(0.11)</td></tr><tr><td>Yearfixedeffect</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>City fixed effect</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>R-Squared</td><td>0.4168</td><td>0.3699</td><td>0.4641</td><td>0.3448</td><td>0.4009</td><td>0.3647</td></tr><tr><td>Observation</td><td>3601</td><td>3506</td><td>3601</td><td>3506</td><td>3601</td><td>3506</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: $^{***}p\\leq0.01$ ， $^{**}p\\leq0.05$ and $^{*}p\\leq0.10$ ; t-statistics are in parentheses.  \n\nFurthermore, the coefficients of VC (e.g., vc_num and vc_mon) in the whole sample and the matching sample of PSM are all significantly positiveatthe $10\\%$ level. It points out that both the number and total amount of VC projects can significantly promote urban technological performance, breakthrough innovation, and incremental innovation.  \n\n## 5. Further analysis: HSR shock and VC's technology spillovers  \n\nThe opening of HSR can effectively expand the accessible geographical space of VC institutions, which may attract more VC institutions, and improve the information asymmetry between VC and invested enterprises (Lerner, 1995), thus affecting urban technological performance. To reveal whether the VC's technology spillovers to cities are impacted by the opening of HSR, this study introduces the interaction term between VC and HSR to conduct empirical analysis. The model is given as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{Y_{i t}=\\beta_{\\mathrm{0}}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{1}}h s r_{i t}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{2}}a f t e r_{i t}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{3}}\\nu c^{\\ast}a f t e r_{i t}}\\ {+\\beta_{\\mathrm{4}}\\nu c+\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\lambda_{i}X_{i t}+\\delta_{t}+\\theta_{i}+\\varepsilon_{i t}\\:}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $Y$ represents urban technological performance (inno), breakthrough innovation (br_inno), and incremental innovation (incr_inno); $\\nu c\\times$ after is the interaction term between the opening of HSR and VC.  \n\nTable 5 reports the regression results, and the explanatory variables of columns (1), (2) and (3) are urban technological performance, breakthrough innovation, and incremental innovation, respectively.  \n\nThe coefficients of VC (e.g., vc_mon and vc_num), as shown in Column (1), are all significant and positive (the values are 0.0590 and 0.0506, respectively; $p$ value $<10\\%$ and $p$ value $<1\\%$ .It suggests that VC can promote the improvement of urban technological performance, such as the number of patent applications, which is consistent with the previous conclusions in Section 4.2. The coefficient of the interaction term vc_mon $\\times$ after is highly significant and positive at the $5\\%$ level, and the processing effect of VC on urban technological performance is 0.0402. The results suggest that after the opening of HSR, each one percent increase in the total amount of VC will promote an increase of 0.0402 percent in the urban technological performance. Furthermore, the coefficient of the number of VC is significantly positive, but the interaction term $\\nu c_{_-}n u m\\times$ after is insignificant, indicating that the number of VC on urban technological performance is not affected by the impact of HSR.  \n\nTable5 The results of HSR shock and VC's technology spillovers.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variable</td><td>inno (1)</td><td>br_inno (2)</td><td>incr_inno (3)</td></tr><tr><td>vc_mon Xafter</td><td>0.0590*</td><td>0.0914**</td><td>0.0573**</td></tr><tr><td>vc_num × after</td><td>(1.72) 0.0050</td><td>(2.23) 0.0386*</td><td>(2.46) 0.0257</td></tr><tr><td>vc_mon</td><td>(1.13) 0.0218*</td><td>(1.90) 0.0138**</td><td>(1.06) 0.0221*</td></tr><tr><td>vc_num</td><td>(1.91) 0.123***</td><td>(2.21) 0.0960***</td><td>(1.85) 0.153***</td></tr><tr><td>hsr</td><td>(4.28) 0.598***</td><td>(2.95) 0.559***</td><td>(4.92) 0.595***</td></tr><tr><td>after</td><td>(5.96) 0.198***</td><td>(5.16) 0.297***</td><td>(5.85) 0.153***</td></tr><tr><td>rgdp</td><td>(6.84) 1.323***</td><td>(8.03) 1.511***</td><td>(4.33) 1.205***</td></tr><tr><td>struindu</td><td>(53.59) -0.376**</td><td>(54.44) -1.294***</td><td>(45.41) -0.0484</td></tr><tr><td>market</td><td>(-2.42) 0.164***</td><td>(-7.42) 0.218***</td><td>(-0.29) 0.147***</td></tr><tr><td>ipo</td><td>(12.75) -0.118***</td><td>(15.09) -0.0993*</td><td>(10.68) -0.123***</td></tr><tr><td>constant</td><td>(-4.86) -8.313***</td><td>(-3.62) -11.50***</td><td>(-4.69) -7.506***</td></tr><tr><td>Yearfixed effect</td><td>(-36.70) Yes</td><td>(-45.36) Yes</td><td>(-31.00) Yes</td></tr><tr><td>City fixed effect</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>R-Squared Observations</td><td>0.5980 3601</td><td>0.6185 3601</td><td>0.5642 3601</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: $^{***}p\\leq0.01$ ， $^{**}p\\leq0.05$ , and $\\stackrel{*}{\\boldsymbol{p}}\\leq0.10$ ; t-statistics are in parentheses.  \n\nFor the estimation results of breakthrough innovation in Column (2). The coefficients of the interaction terms between VC and HSR (e.g., vc_mon $\\times$ afterand $\\nu c\\_n u m\\times a f t e r)$ are all significantly positive, and their treatment effects on the breakthrough innovation are 0.0423 and 0.1080, respectively. These results signal that with the opening of HSR in cities, every one percent increase in the total amount and number of VC will lead to the breakthrough innovation with an increase of 0.0423 percent and 0.1080 percent, respectively. Besides, according to the results of incremental innovation in Column (3), only the interaction termvc_mon $\\times$ after is significantly positive at the $5\\%$ level, indicating that with the opening of HSR, the total amount of VC plays a significant role in promoting urban incremental innovation. In contrast, the number of VC has no significant effect on incremental innovation. Finally, the coefficients of HSR are all highly significant and positive at the $1\\%$ level, and the results are in line with the above conclusions.  \n\n## 6. Discussions and conclusions  \n\nThe achievements in HSR technology in China have catalyzed the transformation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and attracted the attention of the world. The rapidly expanding of HSR will dramatically change and even revolutionize the transport mode choice to travel, and thus inevitably have a significant impact on the economic development and technological innovation of cities and regions (Xu et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019; Bracaglia et al., 2020). Particularly, HSR further compresses the spatial-temporal distance between cities and reduces the information asymmetry between VC institutions and enterprises. Thus far, previous studies have attempted to evaluate the effect of HSR on the regional economy, the aviation industry, and the road and maritime transport. However, as far as we know, limited literature has analyzed the effects of HSR on urban technological performance, and these limited studies have tended to ignore the heterogeneity of technological performance, such as breakthrough innovation and incremental innovation. More importantly, no literature has been found on whether HSR impacts the VC's technology spillovers to cities. To address the question, we set out to explore the impact of HSR on urban technological performance using the panel data of 277 cities in China from 2005 to 2017. We first investigate whether and how HSR influences urban technological performance and other types of innovation, e.g., breakthrough innovation and incremental innovation, using the PSM-DID method, and then further examine whether the impact of VC on the city technological performance is shocked by the opening of HSR.  \n\nThe findings from this study make several contributions to the existing literature. This study firstly contributes to the literature by highlighting the impact of HSR on urban technological performance. Our empirical results corroborate the idea that the opening of HSR can strengthen urban technological performance. Specifically, the number of patent applications in the HSR cities is significantly higher than that in the non-HSR cities. A possible explanation for this might be that the opening of HSR can shorten the spatial-temporal distance between cities, promote the flow of talents and production factors, attract the concentration of high-quality resources such as venture capital, and thus improve urban technological innovation. The cities, therefore, should vigorously develop HSR and other transportation infrastructures to advance urban technological innovation levels and thus promote economic development. This is of considerable significance to solve the problem of the unbalanced economic development of cities.  \n\nWe furthermore shed new light on whether HSR has different effects on the various types of technological performance. The findings confirm that HSR can significantly enhance the breakthrough innovation and incremental innovation of cities, and has a more noticeable impact on the breakthrough innovation. More specifically, our findings suggest the number of invention-type patent applications increases significantly after the opening of HSR, and is much higher than that for utility model and design patents. This result may be explained by the fact that invention-type patents are generally considered to be more technical and core value, requiring a more significant inflow of highly skilled labor and capital investment. While HSR can shorten the spatial-temporal distance for skilled labor to travel between cities, and they will flow to  \n\nHSR cities with a higher probability. Also, the opening of HSR will attract more VC and other resources, thus promoting the development of innovation activities in HSR cities.  \n\nFinally, our study has also provided more in-depth insight into how HSR affects the VC's technology spillovers to cities. Our findings provide reliable empirical confirmation that both the number and total amount of VC have a highly significant and positive effect on urban technological innovation, including breakthrough innovation and incremental innovation. Notably, our study has been one of the first attempts to examine the impact of HSR on the VC's technology spillovers to cities, and our findings suggest that HSR has a significantly positive impact on technology spillovers from the total amount of VC. Specifically, after the opening of HSR, the total amount of VC can enhance the improvement of urban technological performance, including breakthrough innovation and incremental innovation. However, only the impact of the number of VC on the urban breakthrough innovation is affected by the HSR, and these results confirm again that technological innovation requires significant and long-term investments. That is to say, the opening of HSR can change the VC's proximity preference, and VC institutions are more willing to invest in enterprises in HSR cities. Compared with the non-HSR cities, the HSR cities are more likely to get long-term investment from VC, which significantly improve urban technological innovation level. Therefore, all cities should make full use of the policy dividend brought by the opening of HSR to accelerate the spillover and diffusion speed of technological knowledge and production factors, so as to improve the ability of urban technologicalinnovation.  \n\nHowever, there are several potential limitations in this study,which may be the future research directions. First, we mainly focus on how HSR affects urban technological performance and the VC's technology spillovers to cities. Our findings show that HSR can strengthen the VC's technology spillovers to cites, but we do not discuss whether the impact of different backgrounds and strategies of VC on urban technological performance is influenced by the opening of HSR, such as government VC, private VC, foreign VC, and joint VC. Future work can further explore the impact of HSR on VC's technology spillovers from different backgrounds and strategies. Moreover, this study only takes the city level data as a research sample, which may not be enough to reveal the impact of HSR on urban technological performance and VC's technology spillovers. Future research should take into account the microdata of enterprises. Our study also does not discuss the existence of various effects in different geographical circles, such as the distance from the central city (Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen). All these are interesting and fascinating research directions in the future.  \n\n# CRediT authorship contribution statement  \n\nWeike Zhang: Conceptualization, Writing - original draft, Software.

Using data from VC-backed Chinese companies listed on the U.S. or Chinese stock markets from 2002 to 2012, we find that U.s. VCs’ experience in either market increases the chance of listing in the United States. However, Chinese VCs? experience in the U.S. plays the same role, but not in China. For entrepreneurs who desire to pursue opportunities in international capital markets, the novel findings offer important implications in their VC selection decisions.  \n\n# Key words:  \n\nForeign IPO; venture capital; signaling theory; social network  \n\n## INTRODUCTION  \n\nForeign initial public offerings (IPOs) are an important form of international entrepreneurship activity; they not only open foreign capital markets, but also create opportunities for entrepreneurs to explore foreign product and service market (Bell, Moore, and Filatotchev, 2012; Ding, Nowak, and Zhang, 2010; Makela and Maula, 2005). One of the most important foreign IPO events in 2014 was the IPO of Alibaba, a Chinese entrepreneurial firm, on the New York Stock Exchange. The Wall Street Journal commented: “The record [IPO] by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. underscores financial markets appetite for new listings, giving fresh fuel to the rally in stocks\" (Driebusch and Scaggs, 2014). This case demonstrates a significant trend in the financial market. Since the 1990s, the number of companies listed on stock exchanges outside their home countries has grown rapidly (Zhang and King, 2010). Approximately $12\\%$ of new capital raised from public equity offerings from 1990 to 2001 occurred cross-border (Henderson, Jegadeesh, and Suchard, 2006), and between 1995 and 2007, foreign IPOs accounted for $20\\%$ of all IPO proceeds (Caglio, Weiss-Hanley, and MariettaWestberg, 2010). In particular, companies from less developed countries desire to list on more developed overseas stock exchanges to attain more sources of equity and better institutional protection (Pagano, Roell, and Zechner, 2002). Foreign IPOs also improve companies′ prestige and thus increase their competitive advantages in both domestic and foreign markets (Aggarwal, Erel, Ferreira, and Matos, 2011; Bell, Filatotchev, and Rasheed, 2012; Moore, Bell, Filatotchev, and Rasheed, 2012). However, foreign IPOs are still rarer than domestic IPOs, because issuer companies confront enormous challenges such as investor home biases (Grinblatt and Keloharju, 2000; Kang and Stulz, 1997; Stulz, 1981) and serious information asymmetry between companies and investors in foreign stock markets (Grinblatt and Keloharju, 2000). Given the huge challenges and benefits of foreign IPOs, an important question is: How can entrepreneurs of issuer companies improve their chances of getting listed on foreign stock exchanges?  \n\nExisting research on foreign IPOs has primarily been limited to the finance literature, and researchers have mainly focused on features of financial institutions on different stock exchanges to explain foreign IPO capital market choice and post-IPO performance (e.g., trading volume, stock price) (e.g., Blass and Yafeh, 2001; Bruner, Chaplinsky, and Ramchand, 2004; Ejara and Ghosh, 2004; Kadiyala and Subrahmanyam, 2002). Recently, a group of entrepreneurship and international business researchers endeavored to apply organizational theories to answer the same questions. They found that home country legal institutions and economic freedom, host country investor protection, and issuer company corporate governance were all important factors that influence foreign IPO location choice and underpricing (Bell, Filatotchev, and Aguilera, 2014; Bell et al., 2012; Bell, Moore, and Al-Shammari, 2008; Moore, Bell, and Filatotchev, 2010; Moore, et al., 2012). However, few studies have taken a strategic perspective to determine the firm-related factors that lead to the success of foreign IPOs.  \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, the work of Hursti and Maula (2007) is the only exception. Examining European companies listed on foreign stock exchanges (mostly in other European countries), they found that industry, company size, ownership by foreign venture capitalists (VCs), and foreign experience of the top management team increased the likelihood of foreign IPOs. In particular, they argued that foreign VCs play the role of information agents, through which they certify their portfolio companies? quality in the home market (Fried and Hisrich, 1994; Megginson and Weiss, 1991). Therefore, the presence of foreign VCs helps lower the barrier of going public abroad by reducing companies’ “liability of foreignness” (Zaheer and Mosakowski, 1997). Although that study notes the influence of foreign VCs’ involvement on the likelihood of foreign IPOs, it does not focus on VCs; moreover, it does not scrutinize the mechanisms through which VCs function in the foreign IPO process. As a result, several important questions remain unanswered. For example, can any foreign VC facilitate foreign IPOs? Similarly, can any domestic VC facilitate foreign IPOs?  \n\nTo answer these questions, we investigate the influences of both foreign and domestic VCs on the success of their portfolio companies’ foreign IPOs, but with a focus on VCs’ past IPO experience on foreign and domestic stock exchanges. Applying signaling and social network theories, we test two mechanisms through which VCs may improve the legitimacy of the issuer companies and thus facilitate foreign IPOs: (1) VCs’ IPO experience on the domestic stock exchange may provide a positive signal, which could be transferred across borders (Moore et al. 2012), and (2) besides signaling effects, VCs’ IPO experience on the targeted foreign exchange also indicates their embeddedness in the social networks pertinent to IPOs, which may offer information and resource benefits to the issuer companies and thus improve their legitimacy. We hypothesize that both foreign and domestic VCs? experience on either domestic or foreign stock exchanges facilitates the success of their portfolio companies? foreign IPOs.  \n\nWe test the hypotheses using the population of VC-backed Chinese companies that went public on either the U.S. or the Chinese stock exchanges during 2002-2012. The results of the analysis show that for the U.S. VCs, their IPO experience on either the U.S. or the Chinese stock exchanges increases the likelihood of their portfolio companies getting listed on the U.S. stock exchange; however, for the Chinese VCs, IPO experience on the U.S. stock exchange, but not the Chinese stock exchange, helps the U.S. IPOs. We also conduct robustness tests that include IPOs of Chinese companies on other foreign stock exchanges, and the findings are consistent.  \n\nThis study advances the limited entrepreneurship literature on international financing. Although researchers have noted that foreign VCs’ involvement may increase the chance of foreign IPOs, studies did not articulate why and how the foreign VCs play the critical role. Our study suggests that it is the foreign VCs’ IPO experience, whether in the host or home country, that makes them valuable assets in supporting foreign IPOs. In other words, all U.S. VCs do not have the same influences on U.S. IPOs — those with more IPO experience in the United States or China are better able to support U.S. IPOs. Moreover, our study reveals that domestic VCs with IPO experience on the target foreign country's stock exchange also contribute to foreign IPOs. This novel finding suggests that it is not VCs’ nationality per se but rather their IPO experience on the target foreign country's stock exchange that really matters.  \n\nThis study makes important theoretical contributions to the international entrepreneurship literature. Because most prior studies take a financial perspective, limited managerial and organizational theories have been applied to explain entrepreneurs’ success in foreign IPOs. In this article, we extend the application of signaling theory and social network theory into the entrepreneurship studies on international financing. Our empirical tests reveal important and novel findings. First, our findings suggest that the effects of social networks in the target foreign country seem more powerful than the effects of signaling transfer across borders; in this sense, our findings shed new light on the liability-of-foreignness concept by developing the concept “liability of outsidership\" (Johanson and Vahlne, 2009). Second, our findings suggest that a VC must overcome the “stickiness of legitimacy” when entering a foreign country (e.g., when Chinese VCs enter the United States), that is, only local players (e.g., U.S. VCs in the U.S. market) are effective information agents that can transfer legitimacy across borders when the institutional gap between the domestic and foreign country is immense.  \n\n## RESEARCH CONTEXT  \n\nWe chose Chinese issuer companies as the research subjects and the U.S. stock exchanges as the foreign capital market in our main data analysis primarily for two reasons: (1) a significant number of foreign VCs explore business opportunities in China, the largest emerging economy, and among them the U.s. VCs are the earliest and most active group (Ahlstrom and Bruton, 2006), and (2) the number of Chinese companies′ foreign IPOs increased dramatically during the past decade, and many of them chose the United States as their IPO location (Ding, et al., 2010; Xu, 2014). In 1993, Qingdao Beer cross-listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and became the first Chinese firm to list abroad. In 1999, China.com was listed on NASDAQ and began the trend for Chinese issuers to list on the U.S. market. With the economic growth and particularly the development of the IT industry in the last decade, increasingly more Chinese companies have listed on major stock exchanges around the world. For example, almost all leading Chinese IT/Internet companies, including Alibaba, Baidu, NetEase, Sohu, Sina, and Tencent, are listed overseas. Figure 1 shows the number of Chinese companies listed on foreign and domestic stock exchanges during the 2002-2012 period. As the figure shows, the U.S. stock market is the major target of foreign IPO location.  \n\n# Insert Figure 1 about here  \n\nDespite the much higher listing and renewal costs and serious home bias in foreign markets (Xu, 2014), many Chinese companies prefer the stock market in the United States and other developed countries to the domestic stock market for various reasons. Besides two common disadvantages shared by most developing countries: (1) immature stock markets offer less capital and a narrower shareholder base, both of which limit companies? long-term growth (Ding et al., 2010; Foerster and Karolyi, 1999; Pagano et al., 2002), and (2) the legal and financial systems are underdeveloped, which leads to higher risks for issuers and investors (Allen, Qian, and Qian, 2005; Cumming, Fleming, and Schwienbacher, 2006, 2009; La Porta, Lopezde-Silanes, Shleifer, & Vishny, 1998) and much more serious underpricing (Zhang and King, 2010), the following two institutional features of the Chinese markets make many Chinese entrepreneurs desire to list on well-developed markets.  \n\nFirst, domestic stock exchanges, including the newly launched ChiNext board (i.e., the so-called Chinese NASDAQ launched in 2009), require issuer companies to have reached a certain profit level upon IPO, which closes the door for most new venture entrepreneurs, especially those in the IT/Internet industry (Xu, 2014). This is because companies in these industries typically demand a large scale of investment before they begin attaining profits.  \n\nSecond, the China Securities Regulatory Commission has applied a series of strict IPO regulations to control the size of the stock market and the pace of issuing, and it has even allocated issuing quotas as a tool of the central government to promote economic development in some regions (Gao, 2002). In addition, China's listing process is lengthy and opaque, a torturous examination compared with speedy registration in most developed countries (Ding et al., 2010). These restrictions and costs significantly increase the difficulties for companies to get listed on the domestic market.  \n\nIn addition to the desire of some Chinese entrepreneurs to list overseas, many foreign VCs investing in Chinese companies prefer foreign IPOs due to institutional concerns. Besides the general reasons such as the home and host country legal regimes and cultural influences (e.g.  \n\nBell et al., 2012; Cumming et al., 2006, 2009), some specific reasons in the Chinese market include: (1) the main stock markets in China are domestic using Chinese currency. Foreign VCs prefer an offshore exit, which gives them access to a freely convertible currency and freely tradable shares (Fuldner, 2011). (2) In some cases the legal structure of a Chinese company does not allow a domestic offering. One of the most significant examples is that if a Chinese company takes foreign investment using a VIE (Variable Interest Entity) structure, listing abroad is often its only choice (Pearson, 2012). Certain industries in China, including internet and education, are heavily regulated and a substantial foreign ownership of asset is either severely limited or prohibited. To attract foreign VCs, the Chinese entrepreneurs in these industries often use the VIE structure, and such companies have to list on overseas exchanges.  \n\nAfter companies decide to go abroad, they must select the listing market (Moore et al., 2012; Sarkissian and Schill, 2004). A number of Chinese VCs choose the United States as the capital market location for several reasons. First, the unique listing requirements are particularly friendly to pre-profit high-tech new ventures (Xu, 2014). Both the NYSE and NASDAQ offer an option to qualify for listing based on assets, shareholders equity and market capitalization only. Second, the U.S. stock market is the largest and arguably most efficient in the world (Hursti and Maula, 2007). Thus, entrepreneurs can obtain more capital and experience with relatively low levels of underpricing and risks during the IPO process. Third, U.S. IPOs improve companies' prestige, thus increasing their competitive advantages in both domestic and foreign markets in the long run (Aggarwal et al., 2011; Bell et al., 2012; Ding et al., 2010; Moore et al., 2012).  \n\nApart from the United States, the other major foreign markets for Chinese companies include Hong Kong, Singapore, U.K., Germany and South Korea. Besides common advantages of a mature stock exchange, each of these stock markets has its unique features that attract  \n\nChinese entrepreneurs. For instance, Chinese companies can worry less about language and geographic barriers when listed in Hong Kong (Sarkissian and Schill, 2004). The attractiveness of Singapore stock market lies in its focus on manufacturing industry, its simple, quick and low cost listing procedure and its supporting environment to SMEs (Xinhuanet, 2006; Zhang, 2007). Since thelate $2000\\mathrm{{s}}'$ , the London and Frankfurt stock markets have paid more attention to Chinese issuers. They offer lower listing cost (e.g., the annual fee in the Frankfurt exchange is E10K, much less than $\\$38$ in NYSE) and more flexible listing requirements than NYSE and NASDAQ, which make them attractive. Meanwhile, some Chinese companies expect to get access to European market via listing on a European stock market (Zhang, 2011).  \n\n## THEORY DEVELOPMENT AND HYPOTHESES  \n\n### Institutional Challenges in Foreign IPOs  \n\nFor several decades organization studies have contended that institutions are more than just background conditions, they significantly shape firms strategy and behavior in all aspects (Ahuja and Yayavaram, 2011; Carney, Gedajlovic, and Yang, 2009; Nee, 1992; Oliver, 1991). Consequently, institutional theory has become an increasingly prominent theory to explain business behavior and strategic decisions that fail to make rational and economic sense (DiMaggio, 1988). These behavior and decisions can be justified from a more socialized perspective by examining the decisions vis- $\\grave{\\cdot}\\grave{\\mathrm{a}}\\cdot$ -vis key stakeholders. In most cases, institutional theory considers “legitimacy” the fundamental explanation to such behavior and decisions (Aldrich and Fiol, 1994). Organizations are embedded in a social framework of norms, values, and considerations of well-accepted economic behavior (Dowling and Pfeffer, 1975). Legitimacy is grounded on shared beliefs of a referent social group and collectively constructed through the interaction between the organization and its environment (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983); therefore, it is the general acceptance of an organization by the environment around it, and conferred by outside actors and observers (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978). Organizations try to gain legitimacy to convince external actors that they are efficient, competent, and worthy of consideration (Mezias and Boyle, 2002). Because legitimacy helps organizations gain access to resources and exploit opportunities, a more legitimate company will be more successful in a competitive market (Aldrich and Fiol, 1994).  \n\nIn the context of foreign IPOs, the success of entrepreneurs depends on how their issuer company's legitimacy is judged by foreign investors (Deeds, Mang, and Frandsen, 2004); for the company without strong legitimacy, foreign investors will withhold their investment in the company (Grinblatt and Keloharju, 2000). This explains the well-documented existence of \"home bias\" within financial market, which refers to the tendency among investors to neglect the portfolio benefits associated with international diversification and allocate a relatively large fraction of their wealth in domestic equities (Grinblatt and Keloharju, 2000; Kang and Stulz, 1997; Stulz, 1981).  \n\nBecause of liability of foreignness (Zaheer and Mosakowski, 1997） and liability of newness (Certo, 2003) of the issuer company, gaining legitimacy in foreign IPOs is very challenging for entrepreneurs. The reasons are double folds. First, serious information asymmetry between the issuer company and prospective foreign investors impedes the valuation of the investors. Although a company may be well established and successful in its home country, usually foreign investors and analysts have not heard of it. As the investors lack the codified body of knowledge and country-specific experience that is necessary for systematic evaluation of the foreign company's efficiency, competency, and trustworthiness (Mezias and Boyle, 2002), the company may not be considered legitimate (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983).  \n\nSecond, entrepreneurs lack not only institutional knowledge about but also social connections in the foreign IPO market. Apart from language barriers, there are many aspects in the foreign IPO market that may be remarkably different from those in the entrepreneurs? home country, such as the listing requirements and procedures, the auditing system and the legal documents. A good example is the “chartered scheme” of market entry applied by Chinese IPO market versus a “registration scheme'” adopted by the U.S. stock market (Tan, Huang and Lu, 2013). Without understanding of the regulations, norms and culture of the foreign IPO market (North, 1990), entrepreneurs do not know how to play the “rules of the game to be considered legitimate. The lack of institutional knowledge also implies that the entrepreneurs have great difficulties in forming a strong IPO team composed of prestigious underwriters, attorneys and auditors, who are critical for IPO success (Carter and Manaster, 1990; Pollock, Porac and Wade, 2004), because the entrepreneurs do not know where and how to identify such team members and obtain their support at an affordable cost.  \n\nWe argue that experienced VCs help solve the two problems and facilitate foreign IPO process mainly through improving the “legitimacy” of the issuer company in a foreign country. In essence, experienced VCs will not only be able to signal the quality of the issuer company using their own reputation, and thus alleviate information symmetry, but also their existing social networks in the foreign IPO market offer important institutional knowledge to the entrepreneurs and also help build strong IPO teams in the foreign market. All such influences will enhance the issuer company's conformity with the institutions of foreign IPO market, and improve its legitimacy. In the following section, we will apply signaling and social network theories to articulate how VCs? experience in both host and home countries facilitates foreign IPOs.  \n\n### VCs' IPO Experience in the Home Country  \n\nAs aforementioned, since the issuer company is unknown to the prospective foreign investors, it is likely to be considered illegitimate in the foreign IPO market. Relevant and positive signals, as such signals could reduce information asymmetry between entrepreneurs and foreign investors (Connelly, Certo, Ireland and Reutzel, 2011). “Signaling theory's central tenet is that firms demonstrate unobservable capabilities and future value through observable, external signals that are costly or difficult to imitate\" (Bell et al., 2012, p. 199; Spence, 1973). Accordingly, the issuer company can gain legitimacy by sending positive signals that are measurable and familiar to the investors (Daily, Certo, Dalton, and Roengpitya, 2003). For domestic IPO markets, previous studies have identified a wide range of factors that may signal the quality of the issuer company, including the involvement of influential investment bankers (Carter and Manaster, 1990), well-established top management teams (Cohen and Dean, 2005), prestigious board members, VCs, and underwriters (Pollock, Chen, Jackson, and Hambrick, 2010), board interlocks (Filatotchev and Bishop, 2002), and VCs with past IPO experience (Nahata, 2008). The involvement of institutional actors, such as the company's corporate counsels, corporate investors, consultants, and auditors, is also a positive signal that brings legitimacy in the domestic IPO process (Gulati, 1995).  \n\nThough useful and conclusive, these studies did not address the particular scenario of foreign IPO markets. Extending the work of Hursti and Maula (2007), which identified the presence of foreign VCs as a positive signal in the foreign market, we argue that VCs’ past IPO experience in the issuer company's home country represents a powerful signal to certify the quality of the company in the foreign IPO market.  \n\nIn the context of Chinese companies going public in the United States, any Chinese or U.S. VCs that have successfully exited from the Chinese stock exchanges establish legitimacy in the Chinese market. Such legitimacy is gained from the VCs’ demonstration of their abilities to help companies overcome numerous barriers (Bruton and Ahlstrom, 2003). First, the company must have met strict listing requirements in China. For example, the capitalization of the issuer company must be at least RMB $30\\mathrm{m}$ (Securities Law, Article 50[2]); the company must be able to “[make] profits continuously”’ and have “a sound financial status\" (Securities Law, Article 13[2]); and it must have a “complete and well-operated organization” (Securities Law, Article 13[1]), no “major irregularity”\" in the past three years, and no “false record\" in its financial statements (Securities Law, Article 50[4]). Second, both the Chinese Securities and Regulatory Commission and the stock exchange administration have residual discretion to impose additional listing requirements, and they have a wide scope to exercise this arbitrarily. To help their portfolio companies grow to meet these listing requirements, VCs must be competent in providing value-added service, including not only monitoring and supporting business operation but also building well-connected networks in the industry and with the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the stock exchange administration (Bruton and Ahlstrom, 2003). In addition, because VCs not only nurture companies but also select potential winners in the screening stage (Baum and Silverman, 2004), successful IPO experience also indicates VCs strong capability of identifying promising portfolio companies.  \n\nWe argue that the legitimacy VCs have established in the Chinese stock market can be transferred to the U.S. market and thus facilitate the U.s. IPOs of their portfolio companies.  \n\nAccording to Dobrev, Ozdemir, and Teo (2006, p. 592), the identity “overlap between the two populations facilitate legitimacy transfer.” All investors, whether located in China or the United States, share fundamental investment motivations (i.e., lower risks and higher returns from the investment) and selection criteria when selecting promising companies (i.e., higher growth or return potentials) (Brealey and Myers, 1996). Despite the large institutional distance between the Chinese and U.S. stock markets, competent, prudent, and legitimate VCs will always signal the quality of their portfolio companies (Cumming and Dai, 2013; Dai, Jo, and Kassicieh, 2012). Although U.S. investors may not have heard of a Chinese VC and its issuer company, they may still judge the company as a certified issuer if the VC signals that it has past IPO experience in the Chinese stock market. As a result, the legitimacy the VCs obtained from their experience in China will be recognized by U.S. investors. Therefore, we expect that U.S./Chinese VCs with past Chinese IPO experience will be more likely to help their portfolio companies go public in the U.S. stock market.  \n\nHypothesis 1: The more IPO experience in the Chinese stock market (a) U.S. VCs or (b) Chinese VCs of a Chinese issuer company have had, the more likely the company will succeed in going public in the U.S. stock market.  \n\n### VCs' IPO Experience in the Host Country  \n\nSimilar to the IPO experience in the Chinese market, VCs’ past IPO experience in the U.S. market will also facilitate their portfolio companies′ IPOs in the United States by sending positive signals to the stock market. Regardless of whether the VCs are based in the United States or China, their IPO experience in the United States indicates their competency in selecting and nurturing companies (Baum and Silverman, 2004). Moreover, the experience also highlights the expertise of VCs in the IPO process, such as skills in improving the accounting system and corporate governance of the company to meet U.s. listing requirements, knowledge about the U.S. stock market, and skills in price negotiations with underwriters. Because their knowledge and expertise are pertinent to the U.S. market, when the VCs deal with the same communityinvestors in the U.S. stock market--the signaling effect will be strong and effective.  \n\nIn addition to the signaling effect, VCs’ U.S. experience also increases the issuer company's legitimacy through their established social networks in the U.S. IPO market. We apply social network theory to understand the effects. Social network theory “builds on the general notion that economic actions are influenced by the social context in which they are embedded and that actions can be influenced by the position of actors in social networks’ (Gulati, 1998, p. 295). Organizations do not exist in an atomistic system in which information and resources are freely available and equally accessible to all; instead, opportunities for obtaining information and resources are structured and constrained by the rich social context (Gulati, 1995). Therefore, social networks, broadly defined as a web of personal or organizational connections and relationships for the purpose of securing favors in personal and/or organizational action (Burt, 1992), are the sources of information and resources for the actors involved (Adler and Kwon, 2002). In particular, because information and resources build the foundation for each actor to judge the other's efficiency, competency, and trustworthiness (Mezias and Boyle, 2002), a well-established social network may substantively enhance the legitimacy of the focal actor (Gulati, 1995).  \n\nIn the process of supporting their previous portfolio companies in going public in the U.S. market, VCs build broad networks with various communities. Among them, the most important parties include the components of the IPO team (e.g., underwriters, attorneys and auditors) and prospective institutional investors (Pollock et al., 2004). These local network ties may help the issuer company in alleviating the problems of liability of foreignness and newness and thus improving legitimacy in the following ways. First, as an information conduit, networks may provide invaluable information about the IPO market to the company (McDougall, Shane, and Oviatt, 1994). For example, the attorneys may update the most recent regulations that guide the company's preparation for meeting the listing requirements, so that the company can comfort to the regulatory institution. Second, successful IPO experience in the United States helps the VCs establish strong ties with prestigious underwriters, attorneys, and auditors. Because of trust grounded on repeated relationships (Gulati, 1995), VCs can persuade these well-known players to join the IPO team, whose involvement will remarkably increase the legitimacy of the issuer company and facilitate the U.s. IPOs (Bell et al., 2012; Caglio et al., 2010). In addition, because of the trust, VCs’ network ties may offer insightful advice and guidance (White and Poynter, 1990). For example, a trustworthy underwriter may price the stocks fairly, considering the company's interests (Pollock et al., 2004). Third, existing ties with prospective institutional investors will reduce information asymmetry and improve legitimacy (Pollock et al., 2004). In sum, we expect that U.S./Chinese VCs with more U.S. IPO experience will be more capable of helping their portfolio companies go public in the U.S. stock market.  \n\nHypothesis 2: The more IPO experience in the U.S. stock market (a) the U.S. VCs or (b) the Chinese VCs of a Chinese issuer company have had, the more likely the company will succeed in going public in the U.S. stock market.  \n\n## METHOD  \n\n### Sample and Data Collection  \n\nWe obtained data from the databases of Thomson One Banker, Bloomberg, and Zero2IPO. In the first step, using Thomson One Banker, we identified all VC-backed Chinese companies listed on the U.S. stock exchanges (i.e., NASDAQ and NYSE) or Chinese stock exchanges (i.e., Shanghai main board, Shenzhen main board, Shenzhen SME board, and Shenzhen ChiNext) during 2002-2012 period. The main reason for us to start with year 2002 is that before 2002 there was zero or only a couple of Chinese companies that were listed in the U.S. market each year. After we deleted cross-listing cases (i.e., a company with multiple listings in different countries), the data set contained 486 first-listing IPOs. Among them, $21\\%$ $\\scriptstyle\\mathrm{n=102}$ went public in the U.S. Figure 2 shows the dynamics of the VC-backed Chinese IPOs in the domestic, U.S. and other foreign countries.  \n\n# Insert Figure 2 about here  \n\nUsing Thomson One Banker, we also identified all VCs that invested in each issuer company and collected information about their investment activities during the 1992-2012 period. We traced the VC data back to 1992 to calculate the independent variable VCs' IPO experience. The VC and related investment information includes the features of the VC, such as nationality, location, and founding date, and details about each VC investment deal, such as the investment date and the investee company's nationality and location. Size, age and industry information is also available for the issuer companies. We used Zero2IPO, the most reputable Chinese VC/PE database, to verify and supplement any missing data. Because the two databases have the most matching VC data since year 1992, we chose 1992 as the start year.  \n\nIn the second step, we collected financial, operational and IPO data of each issuer company from company prospectuses using Bloomberg. The information includes accounting measures, ownership, top management team (TMT), board of directors (BOD), underwriters, accounting firms and law firms. The prospectuses are available for 369 companies, among which $20\\%$ $\\mathtt{\\tilde{n}}{=}74\\$ ) are U.S IPOs. This ratio is the same as that $(21\\%)$ in the complete sample. We compared the 369 companies with their peers whose prospectuses were missing on company size, age and industry, and did not find significant differences. Therefore, our final dataset is composed of the well-representative 369 companies.  \n\n### Measures  \n\nDependent Variable: U.S./China IPO. We coded the variable as 1 if the company went public on any U.S. stock exchanges and as O for any Chinese stock exchanges. It merits mentioning other VC exit modes apart from IPOs. Our data using Thomson One Banker indicates that among all VC-backed Chinese companies, 29 exited via M&A during 2002 and 2012. Among them nine were backed by purely Chinese VCs, 14 were backed by at least one U.s. VC, and six were backed by Chinese VCs syndicated with VCs from the other countries than the United States. No information is available for secondary sales, management buybacks or write-offs.  \n\n#### ndependent Variables: Chinese/U.S. VCs' IPO experience in the Chinese/U.S. stock market.  \n\nWe measured this variable in two ways. First, we measured the variable by the total number of portfolio companies that went public on any Chinese/U.s. stock exchanges between 1992 and year t - 1 for all Chinese/U.S. VCs that invested in each issuer company in the dataset. Again, the data on the IPO experience of each VC started with 1992.  \n\nFor example, consider NASDAQ-listed company A, which received investment from six VCs upon listing in 2011, two of which were Chinese VCs, three of which were U.S. VCs, and one of which was a U.K. VC. Now suppose that among the portfolio companies of the two Chinese VCs, 10 went public on the Chinese stock exchanges and none in the U.S. market during 1992-2010; similarly, among the portfolio companies of the three U.s. VCs, five went public on the Chinese stock exchanges and 18 in the U.S. market during the same period. Then, for company A, Chinese VCs’ Chinese IPO experience is 10, Chinese VCs’ U.S. experience is 0, U.S. VCs' Chinese experience is 5, and U.S. VCs' U.S. experience is 18. We do not take into account the U.K. VCs? IPO experience in our analysis.  \n\nThe second way to measure VCs’ IPO experience is to calculate the total number of Chinese/U.S. VCs that had successfully exited from any Chinese/U.S. stock exchange between 1992 and year t - 1 for all Chinese/U.s. VCs that invested in each issuer company. In this example, suppose that of the two Chinese VCs, one had exited from the Chinese exchanges and none from the U.S. market during 1992-2010; similarly, of the three U.S. VCs, two had exited from the Chinese exchanges and three from the U.S. market during the same period. Then, for company A, Chinese VCs? Chinese experience is 1, Chinese VCs' U.S. experience is O, U.S. VCs' Chinese experience is 2, and U.S. VCs' U.S. experience is 3.  \n\nControl Variables. In the first group, we included important characteristics of the issuer company to control for the effects of its quality. (1) We included company's age upon IPO, as an older company may have a better track record and lower liability of newness, both of which ease the foreign IPO process. (2) We also controlled for company size, measured as Ln (total asset) upon IPO. Because a large company indicates an established business, it is more likely to be recognized by foreign investors. (3) We controlled for financial performance, including Ln (EBIT) upon IPO and Average growth rate of EBIT in the past three years before IPO. A highly profitable and fast growing company may need large capital from the U.S. market, and they could also be easily recognized by foreign investors (Ding et al., 2010).  \n\nThe second group of control variables includes important features of TMT and BOD. (1) We included CEO duality dummy and number of independent directors to control for the effects of corporate governance. Prior studies have found that CEO duality (e.g., Moore et al., 2012) or board independence (e.g., Bell et al., 2012; Ding et al., 2010) has significant impact on IPO stock market choice. (2) We included TMT size, measured by number of TMT members, to control for the quality of the TMT. In addition, we tried to include BOD size, however, since it is highly correlated with TMT size $\\scriptstyle\\mathrm{\\mathrm{(b=0.88}}\\mathrm{\\mathrm{,}}$ ), we dropped it.  \n\nIn the third group, we controlled for the features of VCs. We included VC ownership $(\\%)$ measured by total percentage of VCs’ ownership in the issuer company. Filatotchev (2006) demonstrated that VC ownership can influence board independence and non-executive directors? interests in IPOs.  \n\nFinally, we controlled for timing and industrial effects. IPO years are a series of dummy variables that indicate the year the issuer company went IPO, and 2002 is the reference year. We included industries dummies to control for potential industry effects on IPO potential. Using twodigit Standard Industrial Classification codes to classify the industries, we identified eight industries: agriculture, mining/construction, manufacture, electronics, wholesale, retail, finance, and service (agriculture serves as the reference group).  \n\nIt merits noting that a few control variables are not included in data analysis for various reasons. (1) Given the prevailing influence of the government on business operations in China (Peng and Luo, 2000; Wu and Cheng, 2011), we included the dummy variable government involvement, measured by government ownership. However, because this variable nearly perfectly predicted IPOs in China, it was dropped in data analysis. (2) We considered TMT experience, including the variable number of TMT members having U.S. work/educational experience, or whether any TMT member having U.S. work/educational experience. The correlations between either variable and U.S./China IPO are 0.89 and 0.80 respectively. Since the correlations are too high, STATA dropped them in data analysis. The finding confirms prior studies that have suggested important influence of TMT overseas experience on foreign IPOs (e.g., Hursti and Maula, 2007). (3) We considered foreign ownership percentage. However, since its correlation with U.S./China IPO is too high $(\\mathrm{b}{=}0.83)$ , STATA dropped it.  \n\n## RESULTS  \n\n### Descriptive Analysis  \n\nTable 1 reports the descriptive statistics and correlation matrix of the variables. Although the correlations between the independent variables and controls are low, those between the four independent variables are high. To address collinearity concern, we included each independent variable individually in data analysis before including them in a full model. The results are consistent, suggesting that collinearity is not a serious concern.  \n\nInsert Table 1 about here  \n\nWe explore the syndication structure to demonstrate the popularity of U.s. VCs and to offer a rough picture of the listing location. Among the 369 sample companies, 61 $(17\\%)$ had at least one U.S. VCs. Among them, 21 $(6\\%)$ were invested purely by U.s. VCs without any Chinese or other country partners. Among the 21 companies, nine were listed in China, and 12 were listed in the U.S. Among the 369 sample companies, 145 $(39\\%)$ were invested purelyby Chinese VCs, among which 129 were listed in China and 16 were listed in the U.S. For the 33 companies that were invested by both U.S. and Chinese VCs (with or without other country partners), five were listed in China, while 28 were listed in the United States. In sum, it seems that the presence of U.S. VCs is associated with listing in the United States.  \n\n### Hypotheses Test  \n\nBefore presenting the logistic regressions of hypotheses tests, we present summary statistics to compare the characteristics of entrepreneurial companies in the two markets in Table 2. The table suggests that more profitable and faster growing companies are more likely to succeed in listing in the U.S. market. Moreover, U.S. IPO companies have higher CEO duality, fewer independent directors and higher VC ownership than China IPO companies. Companies in the finance and service industries are more likely to list in the U.S., while companies in the manufacturing industry are more likely to list in China. Regarding VCs’ experience, overall companies listed in the U.S. market have significantly more experienced U.S. and Chinese VCs than their counterparts in the Chinese market, except that the Chinese VCs’ Chinese experience is statistically the same in the two markets.  \n\nInsert Table 2 about here  \n\nTable 3 shows the results of logistic regressions on the likelihood of a Chinese company going public in the U.S. versus China. Again, the independent variable is measured using two approaches. Hypothesis 1 predicts that the U.S./Chinese VCs’ IPO experience in the Chinese market will increase the likelihood of the portfolio company's U.S. IPO. As models 2, 6, 7 and  \n\n11 show, the coefficients of U.S. VCs′ Chinese experience are positive and significant, in support of hypothesis 1a. However, the coefficients of Chinese VCs′ Chinese experience in models 3, 6, 8 and 11 are insignificant, so hypothesis 1b must be rejected.  \n\nInsert Table 3 about here  \n\nHypothesis 2 predicts that the U.S./Chinese VCs? IPO experience in the U.S. market will increase the likelihood of the portfolio company's U.S. IPO. As models 4, 5, 6, 9, 10 and 11 show, the coefficients of U.S. VCs' U.S. experience and Chinese VCs’ U.S. experience are positive and significant, in support of hypotheses 2a and 2b, respectively.  \n\nIt is important to put the size of these estimates in economic terms. Following Moore et al. (2012), we calculate the odds ratio $(=\\mathfrak{e}$ coeftcenl using coefficients in thefll models Ods ratio presents the change in odds of being in one of the categories of outcome when the value of a predictor increases by one unit (Tabachnick and Fidell, 2007, p. 461). As regards to U.S. VCs experience in China, for every one unit increase in the number of portfolio companies that went public, the odds of listing in the U.S. increase by $1.04~(=\\mathrm{~e~}^{0.0404})$ times; for every one unit increase in the number of U.S. VCs that have successful IPO experience in China, the odds of listing in the U.S increase by $13~(=\\mathrm{e}^{2.597})$ times. By the same token, for U.S. VCs experience in the U.S., the odds increase by 1.42 and 28 times respectively, and for Chinese VCs′ experience in the U.S., the odds increase by 1.41 and 19 times respectively.  \n\nIn sum, U.S. VCs? IPO experience in either the U.S. or the Chinese market has a positive influence on U.S. IPOs. However, although Chinese VCs’ IPO experience in the U.S. market is also beneficial, their IPO experience in China does not function as we predicted.  \n\n### Additional Analysis on U.S. VCs’ Experience  \n\nBecause the U.S. VCs’ experience in the two markets is highly correlated, one may question whether the observed effect of the U.S. VCs’ experience in China is in fact owing to their experience in the U.s. To test this proposition, we orthogonalized the four experience variables following the order of U.s. VCs’ experience in the U.s., U.s. VCs’ experience in China, Chinese VCs? experience in the U.S. and Chinese VCs’ experience in China. The results remained for both sets of measurement of the experience variables. Methodologically, if the correlation of the U.s. VCs' experience in the two markets is too high, one of the two variables might show insignificant results in the full model. Because we did find significant results for both variables in the full model, our analysis is robust, even in a conservative model.  \n\nWe conducted further analysis to check the interaction effect of U.S. VCs? experience in the two markets, and presented the results in Table 4. The models 1 and 6 used full sample, and VCs’ experience was measured by two different methods as aforementioned. In both models, since a positive and significant interaction effect exists, the U.s. VCs’ experience in both markets complements each other. In other words, the more Chinese experience the U.s. VCs have, the stronger the effect of their U.S. experience will be, and vice versa. Theoretically, the complimentary relationship suggests that U.S. VCs’ Chinese experience mitigates their own “liability of foreignness\" in the Chinese market and signals their legitimacy there. The strong signal, in turn, further strengthens the signaling and social network effects stemming from their experience in the United States.  \n\nTo further test the interaction effect, we split the sample into two groups where their experience in the U.S. market is either absent or present, and we tested the influence of their experience in China on U.S./China IPO in each group. For the subsample where the U.S. VCs? experience in the U.S. market is present $(\\mathbf{n}{=}78)$ ), the result confirmed the full sample result, as shown in the models 2, 3, 7 and 8. Interestingly, for the subsample $\\scriptstyle\\mathrm{{n=}}291$ ) in which the U.S. VCs did not have any experience in the U.S., their experience in China is also zero. Among them, 252 companies went IPO in China, and 39 in the U.s. We further investigated the factors that influenced their IPO location, and found that Chinese VCs’ experience in the U.S. is strongly and positively related with IPOs in the U.S., but their experience in China is not associated with IPO location. This further confirms our findings regarding H1b and H2b. In addition, we examined the cases where U.s. VCs’ experience in China is present $\\mathtt{\\Gamma}(\\mathtt{n}{=}41\\$ ), and presented the results in model 4, 5, 9 and 10. The results largely remained, except for model 10 where the interaction term has insignificant effect. In sum, the evidence above suggests that U.s. VCs’ experience in both markets have their own direct effects on the likelihood of a U.S. IPO, and they also complement each other. Moreover, there are no companies whose U.s. VCs have experience in China but no experience in the U.S. In the companies where U.S. VCs have experience in neither market, the Chinese VCs’ U.S. experience plays a significant role in helping the companies go IPO in the United States.  \n\n### Additional Analysis on the Interaction of U.S. and Chinese VCs' Experience  \n\nPrior studies found that companies that are co-invested by foreign and local VCs are most likely to successfully exit (e.g. Chemmanur et al., 2010; Cumming, Knill and Syvrud, 2014; Dai et al., 2012; Nahata et al., 2012). In line with these studies, we conducted additional analysis to test the hypothesis - the U.S. VCs’ experience in the U.S. stock market and the Chinese VCs' experience in the Chinese market are complementary to each other in supporting Chinese companies? U.S. IPOs. The results did not support the hypothesis. To explain why our results are different from the prior studies, we must highlight that foreign versus domestic IPO is our dependent variable, while the prior studies examined the success versus failure to exit via IPOs or M&As. As we will emphasize later, the insignificant role of Chinese VCs? Chinese experience manifests the “stickiness of legitimacy” in foreign IPO process.  \n\n### Additional Analysis on VCs' U.S. Experience and IPO Team Quality  \n\nIn this study we argued that one of the major mechanisms through which VCs' experience in the U.S. market facilitates the U.S. IPO process is better social networks offered by experienced VCs. In this section we test this mechanism - is VCs? experience in the U.S. market positively associated with the likelihood of making use of any top-tier underwriters, auditors and attorneys in the U.s. IPO market? We formed a list of top underwriters using the China Venture Capital & Private Equity Annual Ranking by Zero2IPO Group (2001-2014). The underwriters on the list are the most successful ones that contributed in the Chinese companies’ foreign IPO events'. We identified top attorneys from the “2003 IPO Lawyer Yearbook\"? . The Big 4 accountants (KPMG, PWC, Ernst & Young and Deloitte) are the top-tier accounting firms. We presented the results in Table 5. Again, VCs’ experience is measured by two methods. The table shows that not only U.S. but also Chinese VCs? experience in the U.S. market helps bring in toptier IPO team. This finding strongly supports our arguments on social network effects.  \n\nInsert Table 5 about here  \n\n### Additional Analysis on Experience of Other VCs or in Other Countries  \n\nThis study focuses on the Chinese and U.S. VCs' IPO experience in the Chinese and U.S. markets, because the two groups of VCs? experience in the two markets are most relevant to our research question. However, the issuer companies could also have VCs from the other countries (e.g., the U.K.) and the VCs’ experience may come from other countries. To test the effects of such experience, we collected additional IPO experience data in the following two aspects: (1) the Chinese/U.S. VCs’ IPO experience in other Asian countries, including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam (Bruton, Ahlstrom and Yeh, 2004), because the VCs’ signaling effects may be transferred between the Asian countries and China, which share similar institutional environments and institutional trust (Hain, Johan and Wang, 2014); and (2) the IPO experience of other VCs in the U.S. or Chinese markets, because it is likely that the other VCs may play similar roles in the foreign IPO process. As we did in measuring the independent variables, we measured the new variables in two ways: (1) by the total number of portfolio companies that went public on any relevant stock exchanges between 1992 and year t - 1 for all relevant VCs that invested in the issuer company, and (2) by the total number of VCs that had successfully exited from any relevant stock exchanges between 1992 and year t - 1 for all relevant VCs.  \n\nWe first tested the main effects of the four new variables on U.S./Chinese IPOs, and then we included them as control variables to test the hypotheses. In each model, the measurements of the new variables and the independent variables were consistent. The regression results show that the effects of the new variables on the likelihood of listing in the U.S. were weak, as no consistently significant effects were found across models. The results suggest the limits of signaling and social network effects pertinent to the VCs or experience from other countries. In addition, all results of the hypotheses test remained after the new controls were included. It suggests that our results are robust. Given the space limit, we do not report the results.  \n\n### Endogeneity Issues: Subsample Regressions  \n\nOne of the major sources of endogeneity is reverse causality (Semadeni, Withers and Certo, 2014). In this study, one may argue that the possibility of a U.S. IPO may cause some experienced VCs to invest (rather than experienced VCs cause the company to undertake a U.S. IPO). One way to address this issue is to examine subsamples in which such reverse causality is less likely to hold.  \n\nWe conducted two subsample analyses. (1) We examined size-based subsamples. The reverse causality is less likely to hold for the set of small portfolio companies, which lack managerial expertise to undertake an international listing without the help from VCs. We divided the sample into halves based on the median value of Ln (sales) and examine the group composed of small companies. (2) We examined the investment-time-based subsamples. One may argue that U.s VCs invest in a company merely expect to get listed in the U.S. stock exchange. However, such reverse causality is less likely to hold for the companies that received U.S. VCs? funds in the first round of VC investment when the chance of a U.S. IPO was very uncertain. The results remained for both subsample tests. We do not report the results for brevity.  \n\n#### Endogeneity Issues: Portfolio Company Quality  \n\nGood quality of an issuer company could be the real reason for the success of a U.s. IPO, and it also attracts experienced VCs; therefore, the observed positive relationship between VC experience and U.S. IPO success might not have existed if they were not bridged by high company quality. To address this concern, in this study we included Ln (total asset), company age and financial variables Ln (EBIT) and Average growth rate of EBIT in the past three years before IPO in the models to control for the quality of porfolio companies. Although we admit that company size, age and financial data could only partially measure the quality of the issuer company, they are at least most important indictors. Table 3 shows that the effects of VCs' experience are significant, after controlling for the company quality effects. It suggests that our models in Table 3 are robust to a satisfactory level. We conducted further analysis by adding other financial data, such as EBIT/asset and ROA. Because they did not change our results, we did not include them in the final models.  \n\n#### Endogeneity Issues: Two-stage Regressions  \n\nWe also used two-stage regressions to address endogeneity concerns caused by any other reasons. For U.S. VCs’ experience in the Chinese market (for both measurements), we generate two instruments: (a) USinCN_hotness1, measured by total number of U.S. VCs that had Chinese IPO experience in the issuer company's year of first investment and industry; (b) USinCN_hotness2, measured by total number of U.S. VCs that had Chinese IPO experience in the issuer company's year of first investment and province. By the same token, we generated instrumental variables for the other three VC experience variables.  \n\nThese instruments meet the required two criterions (Semadeni, Withers and Certo, 2014). First, they are relevant to our measurements of VCs’ experience, because when more experienced VCs are available in the market, the companies will be more likely to receive funds from experienced VCs. Second, they are excluded from our logit model predicting company's IPO location, because there are no per se reasons to believe that a large pool of experienced VCs in a particular industry or region will necessarily make any particular company more likely to list in the U.S. than in China.  \n\nWe used “ivprobit’ command in the STATA software package to conduct the two stage probit model analysis. The results are consistent with the OLS models with one exception that when VCs? experience was measured by number of VCs that have IPO experience, the Chinese VCs’ experience in China has also shown significant result on IPO location $(p{=}0.07)$ ,while it has no effects in the OLS model. But by and large, the robustness tests support our OLS test results. We do not include the tables in the article given the space limit.  \n\n### Additional Robustness Tests  \n\nWe ran three robustness tests. First, instead of calculating the IPO experience using the IPO data during 1992 to t-1, we used the data during t-5 and t-1, with the concern that the most recent year experience may count more. The results of hypotheses test remained.  \n\nSecond, we checked whether VC involvement overall facilitates foreign IPOs. We collected data of all non-VC-backed IPOs in the Chinese and U.S. stock markets and obtained 792 IPOs. The data analysis on both VC-backed and non-VC-backed IPOs shows that the VCbacked companies are more likely to go public in the United States than non-VC-backed ones.  \n\nThird, the study has a narrower scope (i.e., the U.S. market is the only foreign market) than a general article on the choice between domestic and any foreign markets. The most important reason for the choice is that the narrower focus may allow us to develop the relevant theory in-depth. As we are interested in the VC firm level factors, it would be ideal if the higher level factors such as country macro economical, societal, and institutional environments are controlled. Therefore, the foreign VCs’ motivations of investing in entrepreneurs and going to IPO are comparable and will not influence the dependent variable substantially. The second major reason for only focusing on the U.s. VCs is due to the popularity and important roles that U.S. VCs have played in the Chinese VC industry (Bruton and Ahlstrom, 2003). Nevertheless, to test whether the VC experience factor is influential in other foreign markets, we replaced the U.S. stock market with the Hong Kong stock market, another most popular IPO target location for Chinese companies. During the 2002-2012 period, 95 VC-backed Chinese companies went public in Hong Kong. The results of the hypotheses test remained. To further test the robustness of our findings, we extended the scope of the foreign market by including the U.S., Hong Kong, and all other foreign stock markets (17 cases in other foreign markets, including Singapore, the United Kingdom, Germany and South Korea); the test results remained, suggesting that our findings are robust to a satisfactory level.  \n\n## DISCUSSION  \n\nThe purpose of this article is to explore the influence of VCs’ IPO experience on the likelihood of their portfolio companies listing in foreign stock markets. We examined the population of VC-backed Chinese entrepreneurial companies that went public in the U.S. or China market between 2002 and 2012. The results show that U.S. VCs? IPO experience in either the Chinese or the U.S. market is positively related to the likelihood of the companies? U.S. IPOs, while Chinese VCs’ IPO experience in the U.S. but not in China plays the same role. The findings remained after we addressed endogeneity and other concerns. Our additional analyses suggest that U.S. VCs? experience in the two markets not only influences U.S. IPOs individually, but also completes each other. However, U.S. and Chinese VCs’ experience do not interact with each other. Moreover, we report evidences that companies whose VCs have more U.S. experience are more likely to make use of top-tier underwriters, auditors and attorneys in foreign IPO process, which supports our social network argument.  \n\n### Theoretical Contributions  \n\nThis study contributes to the previous entrepreneurship research by revealing the factors that really matter in the foreign IPO process — specifically, what matters is not VCs foreign nationality per se, but rather their past IPO experience. An important and novel discovery is that not only can foreign VCs help their companies go public abroad, but domestic VCs with successful IPO experience in the foreign stock market can also contribute to foreign IPOs. Furthermore, not all foreign VCs have the same influence on foreign IPOs; their impacts depend on how much IPO experience they have, regardless of whether it is obtained in the domestic or foreign market.  \n\nTheoretically, our findings shed new light on the development of the liability-ofoutsidership concept. Our finding that both the U.S. and Chinese VCs with successful IPO experience in the U.S. stock market contribute to U.S. IPO suggests the value of existing social networks in the U.S. stock market, regardless of the VCs’ nationality. This finding is in line with the liability-of-outsidership argument: first, given the rapid growth of business networks across borders in recent years, “insidership in related network(s) is necessary for successful internationalization ... and second, relationships offer opportunities for potential learning and for building trust and commitment, both of which are preconditions for internationalization\" (Johanson and Vahlne, 2009, pp. 1411-1412). This study suggests that insidership/outsidership is not constrained to product markets but is also applicable in the financial market, in which there is a clear identity of players in the network (e.g., underwriters, institutional investors, atorneys, auditors). Chinese VCs might enjoy the opportunity of international expansion if they can become insiders of the U.S. network.  \n\nAnother principal theoretical contribution of this study is that it extends application of signaling theory into the international entrepreneurship context by revealing the limitation of signaling effects when companies go public in a foreign market. Although previous research has found that VCs with more IPO experience (measured by cumulative market capitalization of VCbacked IPOs) gain a high reputation, which enhances issuer companies’ legitimacy and improves their IPO opportunities (Nahata, 2008), no studies have examined whether domestic reputation (e.g., in China) may create legitimacy in a foreign country (e.g., the U.s. stock market). Our empirical tests show that signals of Chinese IPO reputation can be transferred to the U.S., but only for U.S. VCs, not for Chinese VCs.  \n\nWe argue that the difficulty that Chinese VCs encounter in conveying positive signals from the Chinese market to the U.S. market reflects the “stickiness of legitimacy\", raising the questions whether and how legitimacy can be transferred across borders. One gap in signaling research in the management literature is that it has ignored differences in institutional settings within which signals are sent and received/interpreted (Bell et al., 2012). Because organizations and individuals are embedded in social, political, economic, and organizational contexts, they will obtain different levels of knowledge of surrounding environments (Westphal and Zajac, 1998; Zajac and Westphal, 1994). If large institutional gaps exist between the countries of information senders and recipients, the enormous barriers will prevent any information and knowledge from being well received and trusted by the information recipients (Kostova and Zaheer, 1999). For a multinational company, the less similar the institutional profiles of the multiple countries in which the company operates, the more difficult it is for the company to make sense of all its environments and to respond appropriately to their legitimacy requirements (Kostova, 1997). By the same token, in our research context, because the United States and China have extremely different institutional environments in the IPO markets (Bruton and Ahlstrom, 2003), legitimacy obtained in China may not be easily recognized by U.S. investors (Kang and Stulz, 1997; Makela and Maula, 2005). However, our finding that U.S. VCs’ IPO experience in the Chinese market helps U.S. IPOs suggests that if the players who transfer the signal are from the recipients’ country, such information is more likely to be verified and accepted. Thus, information agents who transfer information are crucial because their closeness to recipients determines the transferability of legitimacy across borders; when the gap between the two countries is large, local information agents become particularly important in overcoming the stickiness of legitimacy.  \n\n### Managerial Implications  \n\nFor entrepreneurs who plan to undertake IPOs abroad, it is helpful if they can obtain investment from foreign VCs that have successful IPO experience, regardless of whether the experience is based on the domestic or the target foreign market. Alternatively, because it is usually cheaper and easier to obtain investment from domestic VCs, entrepreneurs can also choose domestic VCs that have successful IPO experience in the target foreign market; domestic VCs? IPO experience in the domestic market may not count much though.  \n\nFor foreign VCs that want to exit from the IPO market in their home country, this study shows the value of their IPO experience in either the home or host country stock market. For domestic VCs that plan to pursue opportunities in foreign IPO markets, the results of this study confirm the value of their past experience in the target foreign market but question the significance of their IPO experience in the domestic market. This leads to a follow-up question: how can domestic VCs achieve the goal of foreign IPOs if they lack foreign experience? Perhaps syndicating with experienced foreign VCs is a solution, as this study shows that when foreign partners have more IPO experience, their portfolio companies are more likely to succeed in going public in the foreign market.  \n\nFinally, major stock exchanges around the world, such as NASDAQ, NYSE, and the London Stock Exchange, enjoy the benefits brought by foreign issuer companies. For example, according to the U.S. Treasury, the cross-border capital flow between the United States and other countries contributed to more than $30\\%$ of the U.S. gross domestic product increase from 1980 to 2006 (Zhang and King, 2010). Therefore, most major stock exchanges endeavor to attract foreign issuer companies. Our study suggests that to do so, stock exchanges could work extensively with the related business communities (e.g., VCs, underwriters, attorneys, consultants) to enhance networking opportunities for prospective companies.  \n\n### Limitations and Future Studies  \n\nA limitation of this study is that we only examined Chinese companies. Although we focused on the U.S. stock market in the main data analysis and included all foreign stock markets in the robustness test, in which we found consistent results, we still need to be cautious when generalizing our findings. First, because the Chinese stock market is less developed than the foreign stock markets on which VC-backed Chinese companies were listed, we might attribute the ineffective role of the Chinese VCs’ China IPO experience to the “liability of lessdevelopedness\"”' rather than the liability of foreignness. Because the foreign stock market is better developed than the Chinese market, foreign investors may substantively discount the experience of Chinese VCs in the Chinese market (Moore et al., 2010). As we were limited by data availability, we could not test this proposition. Future studies might test it using questionnaire surveys. Alternatively, studies could test our hypotheses using data from two countries that share similar institutional and financial conditions, such as European countries. We expect that legitimacy is transferable between two similar countries.  \n\nSecond, related to the preceding point, future work would greatly deepen the understanding of signaling effects in entrepreneurial international financing process. In the additional analysis, we have tested and shown the evidence of social network effects; but given data limitation, we did not test the signaling effects directly. One way to test this is by collecting data through a questionnaire survey to investors. Alternatively, further research could test the proposition in a reversed scenario. When entering a less developed country, a company from a more developed country may enjoy advantages simply owing to its nationality; that is, its experience in the home country may be easily acknowledged and highly valued by players in the host country. Although testing this proposition in a foreign IPO context would be difficult, because rarely do companies in a developed country list in less developed countries, research could test it in other contexts, such as international mergers and acquisitions.  \n\n## CONCLUSION  \n\nIn the era of globalization and market integration, increasingly more entrepreneurs are motived to list abroad. VCs, which provide information, capital, and other value-added services to their portfolio companies, are important actors in the foreign IPO process. Previous studies suggest that foreign VCs encourage entrepreneurial companies? internationalization (Hursti and Maula, 2007). Our study extends this argument by revealing how VCs’ nationality and IPO experience facilitate foreign IPOs. We call for additional studies on the role of VCs in the process of entrepreneurial companies? internationalization.  \n\nREFERENCES   \nAdler, P. S., & Kwon, S. W. (2002).

What's more, they have a powerful grip on the nation's L collective imagination. The popular press is filled with against-all-odds success stories of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. In these sagas, the entrepreneur is the modern-day cowboy, roaming new industrial frontiers much the same way that earlier Americans explored the West. At his side stands the venture capitalist, a trail-wise sidekick ready to help the hero through all the tight spots -in exchange, of course, for a piece of the action.  \n\nAs with most myths, there's some truth to this story. Arthur Rock, Tommy Davis, Tom Perkins, Eugene Kleiner, and other early venture capitalists are legendary for the parts they played in creating the modern computer industry. Their investing knowledge and operating experience were as valuable as their capital. But as the venture capital business has evolved over the past 3o years, the image of a cowboy with his sidekick has become increasingly outdated. Today's venture capitalists look more like bankers, and the entrepreneurs they fund look more like M.B.A.'s. The U.S. venture-capital industry is envied throughout the world as an engine of economic growth. Although the collective imagination romanticizes the industry, separating the popular myths from the current realities is crucial to understanding how this important piece of the U.S. economy operates. For entrepreneurs (and would-be entrepreneurs), such an analysis may prove especially beneficial.  \n\n## Venture Capital Fills a Void  \n\nContrary to popular perception, venture capital plays only a minor role in funding basic innovation. Venture capitalists invested more than $\\$10$ billion in 1997, but only $6\\%$ , or $\\$600$ million, went to startups. Moreover, we estimate that less than $\\$1$ billion of the total venture-capital pool went to R&D. The majority of that capital went to follow-on funding for projects originally developed through the far greater expenditures of governments $(\\$63$ billion) and corporations $\\left|\\$133$ billion).  \n\nWhere venture money plays an important role is in the next stage of the innovation life cycle-the period in a company's life when it begins to commercialize its innovation. We estimate that more than $80\\%$ of the money invested by venture capitalists goes into building the infrastructure required to grow the business -in expense investments (manufacturing, marketing, and sales) and the balance sheet (providing fixed assets and working capital).  \n\nVenture money is not long-term money. The idea is to invest in a company's balance sheet and infrastructure until it reaches a sufficient size and credibility so that it can be sold to a corporation or so that the institutional public-equity markets can step in and provide liquidity. In essence, the venture capitalist buys a stake in an entrepreneur's idea, nurtures it for a short period of time, and then exits with the help of an investment banker.  \n\nVenture capital's niche exists because of the structure and rules of capital markets. Someone with an idea or a new technology often has no other institution to turn to. Usury laws limit the interest banks can charge on loans -and the risks inherent in start-ups usually justify higher rates than allowed by law. Thus bankers will only finance a new  \n\n### PROFILE OF THE IDEAL ENTREPRENEUR  \n\nFrom a venture capitalist's perspective, the ideal entrepreneur:  \n\n· is qualified in a \"hot\" area of interest,   \n· delivers sales or technical advances such as FDA approval with reasonable probability,   \n■ tells a compelling story and is presentable to outside investors,   \n■ recognizes the need for speed to an IPO for liquidity,   \n- has a good reputation and can provide references that show competence and skill,   \n· understands the need for a team with a variety of skills and therefore sees why equity has to be allocated to other people,   \n■ works diligently toward a goal but maintains flexibility,   \n■ gets along with the investor group,   \nunderstands the cost of capital and typical deal structures and is not offended by them,   \n· is sought after by many VCs,   \n- has realistic expectations about process and outcome.  \n\nbusiness to the extent that there are hard assets against which to secure the debt. And in today's information-based economy, many start-ups have few hard assets.  \n\nFurthermore, investment banks and public equity are both constrained by regulations and operating practices meant to protect the public investor. Historically, a company could not access the public market without sales of about $\\$15$ million, assets of $\\$10$ million, and a reasonable profit history. To put this in perspective, less than $2\\%$ of the more than 5 million corporations in the United States have more than $\\$10$ million in revenues. Although the IPO threshold has been lowered recently through the issuance of development-stage company stocks, in general the financing window for companies with less than $\\$10$ million in revenue remains closed to the entrepreneur.  \n\nVenture capital fills the void between sources of funds for innovation (chiefly corporations, government bodies, and the entrepreneur's friends and family) and traditional, lower-cost sources of capital available to ongoing concerns. Filling that void successfully requires the venture capital industry to provide a sufficient return on capital to attract private equity funds, attractive returns for its own participants, and sufficient upside potential to entrepreneurs to attract high-quality ideas that will generate high returns. Put simply, the challenge is to earn a consistently superior return on investments in inherently risky business ventures.  \n\n## Sufficient Returns at Acceptable Risk  \n\nInvestors in venture capital funds are typically very large institutions such as pension funds, financial firms, insurance companies, and university endowments - all of which put a small percentage of their total funds into high-risk investments. They expect a return of between $25\\%$ and $35\\%$ per year over the lifetime of the investment. Because these investments represent such a tiny part of the institutional investors' portfolios, venture capitalists have a lot of latitude. What leads these institutions to invest in a fund is not the specific investments but the firm's overall track record, the fund's \"story,\" and their confidence in the partners themselves.  \n\nHow do venture capitalists meet their investors' expectations at acceptable risk levels? The answer lies in their investment profle and in how they structure each deal.  \n\nThe Investment Profile. One myth is that venture capitalists invest in good people and good ideas. The reality is that they invest in good industries - that is, industries that are more competitively forgiving than the market as a whole. In 198o, for example, nearly $20\\%$ of venture capital investments went to the energy industry. More recently, the flow of capital has shifted rapidly from genetic engineering, specialty retailing, and computer hardware to CD-ROMs, multimedia, telecommunications, and software companies. Now, more than $25\\%$ of disbursements are devoted to the Internet \"space.\" The apparent randomness of these shifts among tain and market needs are unknown, and the later stages, when competitive shakeouts and consolidations are inevitable and growth rates slow dramatically. Consider the disk drive industry. In 1983, more than 4o venture-funded companies and more than 8o others existed. By late $\\mathbf{I}984.$ ,the industry market value had plunged from $\\$5.4$ billion to $\\$123$ billion. Today only five major players remain.  \n\nGrowing within high-growth segments is a lot easier than doing so in low-, no-, or negative-growth ones, as every businessperson knows. In other words, regardless of the talent or charisma of individual entrepreneurs, they rarely receive backing from a VC if their businesses are in low-growth market segments. What these investment flows reflect, then, is a consistent pattern of capital allocation into industries where most companies are likely to look good in the near term.  \n\nDuring this adolescent period of high and accelerating growth, it can be extremely hard to distinguish the eventual winners from the losers because their financial performance and growth rates look strikingly similar. (See the chart \"Timing Is Everything.\") At this stage, all companies are struggling to deliver products to a product-starved market. Thus the critical challenge for the venture capitalist is to identify competent management that can execute - that is, supply the growing demand.  \n\nPicking the wrong industry or betting on a technology risk in an unproven market segment is something VCs avoid. Exceptions to this rule tend to involve \"concept\" stocks, those that hold great promise but that take an extremely long time to succeed. Genetic engineering companies illustrate  \n\n# The myth is that venture capitalists invest in good people and good ideas. The reality is that they invest in good industries.  \n\ntechnologies and industry segments is misleading; the targeted segment in each case was growing fast, and its capacity promised to be constrained in the next five years. To put this in context, we estimate that less than $\\mathbf{I}\\mathbf{O}\\%$ of all U.S. economic activity occurs in segments projected to grow more than $15\\%$ a year over the next five years.  \n\nIn effect, venture capitalists focus on the middle part of the classic industry S-curve. They avoid both the early stages, when technologies are uncerthis point. In that industry, the venture capitalist's challenge is to identify entrepreneurs who can advance a key technology to a certain stage -FDA approval, for example - at which point the company can be taken public or sold to a major corporation.  \n\nBy investing in areas with high growth rates, VCs primarily consign their risks to the ability of the company's management to execute. VC investments in high-growth segments are likely to have exit opportunities because investment bankers are  \n\n## TIMING IS EVERYTHING  \n\nMore than $80\\%$ of the money invested by venture capitalists goes into the adolescent phase of a company's life cycle. In this period of accelerated growth, the financials of both the eventual winners and losers look strikingly similar.  \n\n![](images/863c1c7b4fd3d1f38e334ac51fe4c8c6fab4a02de544d715bf56778b716a8116.jpg)  \n\ncontinually looking for new high-growth issues to bring to market. The issues will be easier to sell and likely to support high relative valuations - and therefore high commissions for the investment bankers. Given the risk of these types of deals, investment bankers' commissions are typically $6\\%$ to $8\\%$ of the money raised through an IPO. Thus an effort of only several months on the part of a few professionals and brokers can result in millions of dollars in commissions.  \n\nAs long as venture capitalists are able to exit the company and industry before it tops out, they can reap extraordinary returns at relatively low risk. Astute venture capitalists operate in a secure niche where traditional, low-cost financing is unavailable. High rewards can be paid to successful management teams, and institutional investment will be available to provide liquidity in a relatively short period of time.  \n\nThe Logic of the Deal. There are many variants of the basic deal structure, but whatever the specifics, the logic of the deal is always the same: to give investors in the venture capital fund both ample downside protection and a favorable position for additional investment if the company proves to be a winner.  \n\nIn a typical start-up deal, for example, the venture capital fund will invest $\\$3$ million in exchange for a $40\\%$ preferred-equity ownership position, although recent valuations have been much higher. The preferred provisions offer downside protection. For instance, the venture capitalists receive a liquidation preference. A liquidation feature simulates debt by giving $\\mathtt{I O O}\\%$ preference over common shares held by management until the VC's $\\$3$ million is returned. In other words, should the venture fail, they are given first claim to all the company's assets and technology. In addition, the deal often includes blocking rights or disproportional voting rights over key decisions, including the sale of the company or the timing of an IPO.  \n\nThe contract is also likely to contain downside protection in the form of antidilution clauses, or ratchets. Such clauses protect against equity dilution if subsequent rounds of financing at lower values take place. Should the company stumble and have to raise more money at a lower valuation, the venture firm will be given enough shares to maintain its original equity position -that is, the total percentage of equity owned. That preferential treatment typically comes at the expense of the common shareholders, or management, as well as investors who are not affiliated with the VC firm and who do not continue to invest on a pro rata basis.  \n\nAlternatively, if a company is doing well, investors enjoy upside provisions, sometimes giving them the right to put additional money into the venture at a predetermined price. That means venture investors can increase their stakes in successful ventures at below market prices.  \n\n## HOW THE VENTURE CAPITAL INDUSTRY WORKS  \n\nThe venture capital industry has four main players: entrepreneurs who need funding; investors who want high returns; investment bankers who need companies to sell; and the venture capitalists who make money for themselves by making a market for the other three.  \n\n![](images/e3ae06b3ea5b289706ba0991283e1e13d9affc011a7ee1df504ddb5cc6701046.jpg)  \n\nVC firms also protect themselves from risk by coinvesting with other firms. Typically, there will be a \"lead\" investor and several \"followers.\" It is the exception, not the rule, for one VC to finance an individual company entirely. Rather, venture firms prefer to have two or three groups involved in most stages of financing. Such relationships provide further portfolio diversification -that is, the ability to invest in more deals per dollar of invested capital. They also decrease the workload of the VC partners by getting others involved in assessing the risks during the due diligence period and in managing the deal. And the presence of several VC firms adds credibility. In fact, some observers have suggested that the truly smart fund will always be a follower of the top-tier firms.  \n\n### Attractive Returns for the VC  \n\nIn return for financing one to two years of a company's start-up, venture capitalists expect a ten times return of capital over five years. Combined with the preferred position, this is very high-cost capital: a loan with a $58\\%$ annual compound interest rate that cannot be prepaid. But that rate is necessary to deliver average fund returns above $20\\%$  \n\nFunds are structured to guarantee partners a comfortable income while they work to generate those returns. The venture capital partners agree to return all of the investors' capital before sharing in the upside. However, the fund typically pays for the investors' annual operating budget $-2\\%$ to $3\\%$ of the pool's total capital-which they take as a management fee regardless of the fund's results. If there is a $\\$100$ million pool and four or five partners, for example, the partners are essentially assured salaries of $\\$200,000$ to $\\$400,$ 0oo plus operating expenses for seven to ten years. (If the fund fails, of course, the group will be unable to raise funds in the future.) Compare those figures with Tommy Davis and Arthur Rock's first fund, which was $\\$5$ million but had a total management fee of only $\\$75$ ,000 a year.  \n\nThe real upside lies in the appreciation of the portfolio. The investors get $70\\%$ to $80\\%$ of the gains; the venture capitalists get the remaining $20\\%$ to $30\\%$ . The amount of money any partner receives beyond salary is a function of the total growth of the portfolio's value and the amount of money managed per partner. (See the exhibit \"Pay for Performance.\")  \n\nThus for a typical portfolio - say, $\\$20$ million managed per partner and $30\\%$ total appreciation on the fund-the average annual compensation per  \n\n![](images/81444fe50f334ed6bc6fa703ada768b9d37edbbb03d9be2978a0935c1d5c049f.jpg)  \n\nANNUALIRR OF FUND OVERFIVE YEARS:  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>0%</td><td>10%</td><td>20%</td><td>30%</td><td>40%</td><td>50%</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\">AVERAGEANNUALCOMPENSATION(INMILLIONS $2o million managed per partner:</td></tr><tr><td>0.2</td><td>0.6</td><td>1.4</td><td>2.4</td><td>3.8</td><td>5.4</td></tr><tr><td>AVERAGEANNUALCOMPENSATION(INMILLIONS $30 million managed per partner:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0.3</td><td>0.9</td><td>2.1</td><td>3.6</td><td>5.5</td><td>8.1</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\npartner will be about $\\$2.4$ million per year, nearly all of which comes from fund appreciation. And that compensation is multiplied for partners who manage several funds. From an investor's perspective, this compensation is acceptable because the venture capitalists have provided a very attractive return on investment and their incentives are entirely aligned with making the investment a success.  \n\nWhat part does the venture capitalist play in maximizing the growth of the portfolio's value? In an ideal world, all of the firm's investments would be winners. But the world isn't ideal; even with the best management, the odds of failure for any individual company are high.  \n\nOn average, good plans, people, and businesses succeed only one in ten times. To see why, consider that there are many components critical to a company's success. The best companies might have an $80\\%$ probability of succeeding at each of them. But even with these odds, the probability of eventual success will be less than $20\\%$ because failing to execute on any one component can torpedo the entire company.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"2\">INDIVIDUALEVENT PROBABILITY</td></tr><tr><td>Company has sufficient capital</td><td>80%</td></tr><tr><td>Management is capable and focused</td><td>80%</td></tr><tr><td>Product development goes as planned Production and component sourcing</td><td>80%</td></tr><tr><td>goes as planned</td><td>80%</td></tr><tr><td>Competitors behave as expected</td><td>80%</td></tr><tr><td>Customers want product</td><td>80%</td></tr><tr><td>Pricing is forecast correctly</td><td>80%</td></tr><tr><td>Patents areissuedand are enforceable</td><td>80%</td></tr><tr><td>COMBINEDPROBABILITYOFSUCCESS</td><td>17%</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nIf just one of the variables drops to a $50\\%$ probability, the combined chance of success falls to $\\mathbf{I}\\mathbf{O}\\%$  \n\nThese odds play out in venture capital portfolios: more than half the companies will at best return only the original investment and at worst be total losses. Given the portfolio approach and the deal structure VCs use, however, only $\\mathrm{\\Delta}\\mathbf{I}\\mathbf{O}\\%$ to $20\\%$ of the companies funded need to be real winners to achieve the targeted return rate of $25\\%$ to $30\\%$ . In fact, VC reputations are often built on one or two good investments.  \n\nA typical breakout of portfolio performance per $\\$1$ ,ooo invested is shown below:  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>BAD</td><td>ALIVE</td><td>OKAY</td><td>GOOD</td><td>GREAT</td><td>TOTAL</td></tr><tr><td>SINVESTED</td><td>200</td><td>400</td><td>200</td><td>I00</td><td>100</td><td>1,000</td></tr><tr><td>PAYOUT YEAR5</td><td>O</td><td>IX</td><td>5X</td><td>IOX</td><td>20X</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>GROSS RETURN</td><td></td><td>400</td><td>1,000</td><td>1,000</td><td>2,000</td><td>4,400</td></tr><tr><td>NET RETURN</td><td>(200)</td><td>O</td><td>800</td><td>900</td><td>1,900</td><td>3,400</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThose probabilities also have a great impact on how the venture capitalists spend their time. Little time is required (and sometimes best not spent) on the real winners -or the worst performers, called numnuts ${\\bf\\chi}^{\\prime\\prime}{\\bf n}{\\bf0}$ money, no time\"). Instead, the VC allocates a significant amount of time to those middle portfolio companies, determining whether and how the investment can be turned around and whether continued participation is advisable. The equity ownership and the deal structure described earlier give the VCs the flexibility to make management changes, particularly for those companies whose performance has been mediocre.  \n\nMost VCs distribute their time among many activities (see the exhibit \"How Venture Capitalists Spend Their Time'). They must identify and attract new deals, monitor existing deals, allocate additional capital to the most successful deals, and assist with exit options. Astute VCs are able to allocate their time wisely among the various functions and deals.  \n\nAssuming that each partner has a typical portfolio of ten companies and a 2,ooo-hour work year, the amount of time spent on each company with each activity is relatively small. If the total time spent with portfolio companies serving as directors and acting as consultants is $40\\%$ , then partners spend 8oo hours per year with portfolio companies. That allows only 8o hours per year per companyless than 2 hours per week.  \n\nThe popular image of venture capitalists as sage advisors is at odds with the reality of their schedules. The financial incentive for partners in the VC firm is to manage as much money as possible. The more money they manage, the less time they have to nurture and advise entrepreneurs. In fact, \"virtual $\\mathrm{CEOs^{\\prime\\prime}}$ are now being added to the equity pool to counsel company management, which is the role that VCs used to play.  \n\nToday's venture capital fund is structurally similar to its late 1970s and early 198os predecessors: the partnership includes both limited and general partners, and the life of the  \n\n## HOW VENTURE CAPITALISTS SPEND THEIR TIME  \n\n![](images/2ee7c62fc7a3281d55a3a782e51a7c953feeae62773dc050a6c55e376c75d014.jpg)  \n\nfund is seven to ten years. (The fund makes investments over the course of the first two or three years, and any investment is active for up to five years. The fund harvests the returns over the last two to three years.) However, both the size of the typical fund and the amount of money managed per partner have changed dramatically. In $\\mathbf{I}98\\mathbf{0},$ the average fund was about $\\$20$ million, and its two or three general partners each managed three to five investments. That left a lot of time for the venture capital partners to work directly with the companies, bringing their experience and industry expertise to bear. Today the average fund is ten times larger, and each partner manages two to five times as many investments. Not surprisingly, then, the partners are usually far less knowledgeable about the industry and the technology than the entrepreneurs.  \n\n### The Upside for Entrepreneurs  \n\nEven though the structure of venture capital deals seems to put entrepreneurs at a steep disadvantage, they continue to submit far more plans than actually get funded, typically by a ratio of more than ten to one. Why do seemingly bright and capable people seek such high-cost capital?  \n\nVenture-funded companies attract talented people by appealing to a \"lottery\" mentality. Despite the high risk of failure in new ventures, engineers and businesspeople leave their jobs because they are unable or unwilling to perceive how risky a start-up can be. Their situation may be compared to that of hopeful high school basketball players, devoting hours to their sport despite the overwhelming odds against turning professional and earning million-dollar incomes. But perhaps the entrepreneur's behavior is not so irrational.  \n\nConsider the options. Entrepreneurs -and their friends and families -usually lack the funds to finance the opportunity. Many entrepreneurs also recognize the risks in starting their own businesses, so they shy away from using their own money. Some also recognize that they do not possess all the talent and skills required to grow and run a successful business.  \n\nMost of the entrepreneurs and management teams that start new companies come from corporations or, more recently, universities. This is logical because nearly all basic research money, and therefore invention, comes from corporate or government funding. But those institutions are better at helping people find new ideas than at turning them into new businesses (see the exhibit \"Who Else Funds Innovation?\"). Entrepreneurs recognize that their upside in companies or universities is limited by the institution's pay structure. The VC has no such caps.  \n\nDownsizing and reengineering have shattered the historical security of corporate employment. The corporation has shown employees its version of loyalty. Good employees today recognize the inherent insecurity of their positions and, in return, have little loyalty themselves.  \n\nAdditionally, the United States is unique in its willingness to embrace risk-taking and entrepreneurship. Unlike many Far Eastern and European cultures, the culture of the United States attaches little, if any, stigma to trying and failing in a new enterprise. Leaving and returning to a corporation is often rewarded.  \n\nFor all these reasons, venture capital is an attractive deal for entrepreneurs. Those who lack new ideas, funds, skills, or tolerance for risk to start something alone may be quite willing to be hired  \n\nThe venture model provides an engine for commercializing technologies that formerly lay dor mant in corporations and in the halls of acade. mia. Despite the $\\$133$ billion U.S. corporations spend on R&D, their basic structure makes entrepreneurship nearly impossible. Because R&D relies on a cooperative and collaborative environment, it is difficult, if not impossible, for companies to differentially reward employees working side by side, even if one has a brilliant idea and the other doesn't. Compensation typically comes in the form of status and promotion, not money. It would be an organizational and compensation nightmare for companies to try to duplicate the venture capital strategy.  \n\nFurthermore, companies typically invest in and protect their existing market positions; they tend to fund only those ideas that are central to their strategies. The result is a reservoir of talent and new ideas, which creates the pool for new ventures.  \n\nFor its part, the government provides two incentives to develop and commercialize new technology. The first is the patent and trademark system, which provides monopolies for inventive products in return for full disclosure of the technology. That, in turn, provides a base for future technology development. The second is the direct funding of speculative projects that corporations and individuals can't or won't fund. Such seed funding is expected to create jobs and boost the economy.  \n\nAlthough many universities bemoan the fact that some professors are getting rich from their research, remember that most of the research is funded by the government. From the government's perspective, that is exactly what their $\\$63$ billion in R&D funding is intended to do.  \n\nThe newest funding source for entrepreneurs are so-called angels, wealthy individuals who typically contribute seed capital, advice, and support for businesses in which they themselves are experienced. We estimate that they provide $\\$20$ billion to start-ups, a far greater amount than venture capitalists do. Turning to angels may be an excellent strategy, particularly for businesses in industries that are not currently in favor among the venture community. But for angels, these investments are a sideline, not a primary business.  \n\ninto a well-funded and supported venture. Corporate and academic training provides many of the technological and business skills necessary for the task while venture capital contributes both the financing and an economic reward structure well beyond what corporations or universities afford. Even if a founder is ultimately demoted as the company grows, he or she can still get rich because the value of the stock will far outweigh the value of any forgone salary.  \n\nBy understanding how venture capital actually works, astute entrepreneurs can mitigate their risks and increase their potential rewards. Many entrepreneurs make the mistake of thinking that venture capitalists are looking for good ideas when, in fact, they are looking for good managers in particular industry segments. The value of any individual to a VC is thus a function of the following conditions:  \n\n· the number of people within the high-growth industry that are qualified for the position; · the position itself (CEO, CFO, VP of R&D, technician);   \n· the match of the person's skills, reputation, and incentives to the VC firm;   \n· the willingness to take risks; and   \n· the ability to sell oneself.  \n\nEntrepreneurs who satisfy these conditions come to the table with a strong negotiating position. The ideal candidate will also have a business track record, preferably in a prior successful IPO, that makes the VC comfortable. His reputation will be such that the investment in him will be seen as a prudent risk. VCs want to invest in proven, successful people.  \n\nJust like VCs, entrepreneurs need to make their own assessments of the industry fundamentals, the skills and funding needed, and the probability of success over a reasonably short time frame. Many excellent entrepreneurs are frustrated by what they see as an unfair deal process and equity position. They don't understand the basic economics of the venture business and the lack of financial alternatives available to them. The VCs are usually in the position of power by being the only source of capital and by having the ability to influence the network. But the lack of good managers who can deal with uncertainty, high growth, and high risk can provide leverage to the truly competent entrepreneur. Entrepreneurs who are sought after by competing VCs would be wise to ask the following questions:  \n\n· Who will serve on our board and what is that person's position in the VC firm? - How many other boards does the VC serve on?  \n\n· Has the VC ever written and funded his or her own business plan successfully? - What, if any, is the VC's direct operating or technical experience in this industry segment? · What is the firm's reputation with entrepreneurs who have been fired or involved in unsuccessful ventures?  \n\nThe VC partner with solid experience and proven skill is a true \"trail-wise sidekick.\" Most VCs, however, have never worked in the funded industry or have never been in a down cycle. And, unfortunately, many entrepreneurs are self-absorbed and believe that their own ideas or skills are the key to success. In fact, the VC's financial and business skills play an important role in the company's eventual success. Moreover, every company goes through a life cycle; each stage requires a different set of management skills. The person who starts the business is seldom the person who can grow it, and that person is seldom the one who can lead a much larger company. Thus it is unlikely that the founder will be the same person who takes the company public.  \n\nUltimately, the entrepreneur needs to show the venture capitalist that his team and idea fit into the VC's current focus and that his equity participation and management skills will make the VC's job easier and the returns higher. When the entrepreneur understands the needs of the funding source and sets expectations properly, both the VC and entrepreneur can profit handsomely.  \n\nAlthough venture capital has grown dramatically over the past ten years, it still constitutes only a tiny part of the U.S. economy. Thus in principle, it could grow exponentially. More likely, however, the cyclical nature of the public markets, with their historic booms and busts, will check the industry's growth. Companies are now going public with valuations in the hundreds of millions of dollars without ever making a penny. And if history is any guide, most of these companies never will.  \n\nThe system described here works well for the players it serves: entrepreneurs, institutional investors, investment bankers, and the venture capitalists themselves. It also serves the supporting cast of lawyers, advisers, and accountants. Whether it meets the needs of the investing public is still an open question.  \n\n# Harvard Business Review  \n\n# CASE STUDIES AND HARVARDBUSINESSREVIEW ARTICLE REPRINTS  \n\nMany readers have asked for an easy way to order case studies and article reprints or to obtain permission to copy.
