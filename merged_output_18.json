XIAOLAN\\*  \n\n# ABSTRACT  \n\nAlthough the aggregate capital share of U.S. firms has increased, capital share at the firm-level has decreased. This divergence is due to mega-firms that produce a larger output share without a proportionate increase in labor compensation. We develop a model in which firms insure workers against firm-specific shocks, with more productive firms allocating more rents to shareholders while less productive firms endogenously exit. Increasing firm-level risk delays exit and increases the measure of mega-firms, raising (lowering) the aggregate (average) capital share. An increase in the level of rents magnifies this effect. We present evidence that supports this mechanism.  \n\nKeywords: idiosyncratic risk, selection, capital share, labor share, national income accounting JEL Codes: E25, G35, G31.  \n\nOver the last several decades, publicly traded U.S. firms have experienced large increases in the firm-specific volatility of both firm-level cash flows and returns (see, for example, Campbell, Lettau, Malkiel, and Xu (2001), Comin and Philippon (2005), Xiaolan (2014), Bloom (2014), and Herskovic, Kelly, Lustig, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2016)). At the same time, the share of total value added that accrues to the owners of these firms (i.e., the aggregate capital share) has also increased (see, for example, Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) and Piketty and Zucman (2014)). We find that the aggregate factor shares are largely determined by the firm-level factor shares of the largest U.S. firms in the right tail of the size distribution. These mega-firms have experienced substantial increases in their capital share even though the capital share of the average U.S. firm has decreased.  \n\nThe U.S. economy's aggregate factor share dynamics are well understood, but its firm-level factor share dynamics are not. Between 1960 and 2010, the U.S. labor share of total output in the nonfarm business sector of the U.S. economy shrank by $15\\%$ (this phenomenon does not appear to be limited to the U.S.; see, for example, Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014)). Figure 1 plots the capital share over time for the universe of U.S. publicly traded firms. As can be seen, the aggregate capital share for these firms has increased from $40\\%$ to $60\\%$ since 1980. In this plot, capital share is measured as the ratio of capital income to valued added, where capital income is operating income before depreciation (OIBDP) and value added is operating income plus labor expenses.1 Our key empirical contribution is to show that the increase in the capital share is concentrated among the largest publicly traded firms in the U.s. Figure 2 plots the relationship between firm size and the ratio of capital income to sales, which captures the capital share of profits. In 1970 there was essentially no relation between firm size and the capital-income-to-sales ratio, but by 2010 this ratio had strongly increased in size. This shift caused the average and aggregate capital shares to diverge, with the equal-weighted average capital share of publicly traded companies declining since the 1980s. The U.K. and continental Europe have experienced similar divergences between the aggregate and average factor shares over this period, as well as similar increases in idiosyncratic risk. Japan, in contrast, has experienced neither.  \n\nRecently, scholars have documented similar findings in a different sample of U.S. firms. In particular, Kehrig and Vincent (2017) find similar evidence using establishment-level data in the manufacturing industry. In work preceded by ours, Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson, and Reenen (2017) employ census data attribute the decrease in labor share to the low labor share of the largest firms. This result is consistent with our earlier findings, but Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson, and Reenen (2017) abstract from the equally important changes in factor shares in the left tail of the size distribution.  \n\nWe develop an equilibrium model that links our observations on volatility and factor shares and provides novel implications for national income accounting. When shareholders insure workers against idiosyncratic risk, capital shares vary substantially across frms, with the largest and most productive firms having the highest capital share. In our model, changes in the size distribution of firms triggered by changes in firm-level risk have first-order implications for the aggregate and average capital shares in two ways. First, in our model, an increase in idiosyncratic volatility  \n\n![](images/17c5396cb6aab89ab110eb0cff2da6a549c33780124c4ff0af4e2530a8c8af5e.jpg)  \nFigure 1.

Second, consistent with our model, U.S. industries that saw larger increases in idiosyncratic volatility experienced larger drops in the average firm-level capital share. We document similar findings for the U.K., Europe, and, to a lesser extent, Japan.  \n\nShareholders of publicly traded firms can decrease idiosyncratic firm-specific risk through diver sification, while risk-averse workers cannot. It is therefore efficient to provide workers with insurance against firm-specific risk. We analyze a simple optimal contracting model that embeds this intuition in an equilibrium model of industry dynamics (see, for example, Hopenhayn (1992)). The optimal contract pays workers a fixed wage while allocating the remainder of the profits to shareholders. The level of compensation is set in equilibrium to capture the value of ex-ante identical firms. Ex post, these firms are subject to permanent idiosyncratic shocks that lead some firms to increase in size and productivity while others decrease and potentially exit. We use this model as a laboratory to analyze the impact of changes in firm-level risk on the distribution of rents.  \n\nStandard national income accounting, which is applied in this model, yields a new perspective on capital share dynamics. The worker's compensation is set such that the net present value (NPV) of starting a new firm, computed by integrating over all paths using the density for a new firm and discounting, is zero. In contrast, national income accounts integrate only over firms that are currently active using the stationary size distribution, without discounting. As a result, the aggregate capital share calculation puts more probability mass on the right tail than the NPV calculation. As firmlevel risk increases and the right tail of the firm size distribution grows, workers capture a smaller fraction of aggregate rents ex post even though they capture all of the ex-ante rents. This effect is offset in part by a larger mass of unprofitable firms in the left tail of the stationary size distribution.  \n\nIn our model, an increase in firm-level risk invariably increases the aggregate capital share because we use time discounting when computing firm values but not when aggregating output. In the optimal contract, the level of compensation is proportional to the average value of newly established firms, and the average value of new firms is in turn equal to the present value of all future paths of productivity. When volatility increases, a greater fraction of future paths lead to high levels of productivity; however, these paths are discounted when calculating firm value. In contrast, aggregate productivity is simply the average of current firm level productivity with respect to the stationary distribution. When idiosyncratic volatility increases, the right tail of the stationary distribution increases in mass. This increase in mass is fully reflected in aggregate output without discounting. Thus, an increase in idiosyncratic volatility increases aggregate output by more than aggregate compensation, and hence the aggregate capital share increases.  \n\nAt the heart of this mechanism is the selection effect that arises from measuring the distribution of rents while excluding firms that have endogenously exited?: the capital share computed in national income accounts produces a biased estimate of the ex-ante profitability of new firms. Moreover, an increase in selection increases the size of this bias. This effect explains the measured divergence between aggregate compensation and profits: compensation is tied to ex-ante profitability, but not to ex-post realized profits. This result also has a natural insurance interpretation. When idiosyncratic risk increases, workers effectively pay a larger idiosyncratic insurance premium ex post to shareholders. The increase in this ex-post premium leads to an increase in the aggregate capital share even though the shareholders are risk-neutral and receive zero rents ex ante.  \n\nThis selection effect is quantitatively important for capital share dynamics. In a calibrated version of our model, we find that doubling the size of economic rents (see, for example, Furman and Orszag (2015), Barkai (2016), and De Loecker and Eeckhout (2017)) and increasing volatility from $20\\%$ to $40\\%$ replicates the increase in the aggregate capital share and the decrease in the average capital share. The joint increase in volatility and rents is essential to the quantitative performance of our model. An increase in volatility affects how rents are shared between a firm's owners and its workers, while an increase in the level of rents amplifies the effect of changes in rent sharing on the capital share. We note that our calibration exercises compare outcomes in stationary equilibria. Thus, although the increase in idiosyncratic volatility in the data occurs mostly in the earlier half our sample, we should not expect an increase in the capital share in the data to immediately reflect the calibrated increase in the stationary equilibrium.  \n\nTo provide further evidence for our model, we conduct a variety of empirical tests. When we plot the capital-income-to-sales ratio within firm size quantiles, we find that the increase in the aggregate capital share is driven by the largest firms. This result supports Gabaix's (2011) claim that we need to study the behavior of large firms to understand macroeconomic aggregates. In the smallest quantile, the average capital-income-to-sales ratio decreased from around $10\\%$ to lessthan $-100\\%$ from 1960 to 2010. In contrast, this same ratio in the largest quantile remained almost unchanged at around $10\\%$ . Thus, the capital share has become more dispersed across the size distribution. We also find that this effect is most pronounced in the health products and technology industries, which both experienced a large increase in volatility. To directly assess the link between industry-level idiosyncratic volatility and dispersion in the capital share, we regress the industrylevel capital-income-to-sales ratio on idiosyncratic volatility. We find that a within-industry increase in idiosyncratic volatility is associated with a decrease in the average capital-income-to-sales ratio.  \n\nOur paper contributes to the growing literature on the decline in the labor share of output. Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) argue that this decline is due to a decrease in equipment prices that leads firms to substitute capital for labor, but this mechanism does not predict a divergence between the average labor share and the aggregate labor share that we document in the data.3  \n\nMore recent evidence from manufacturing establishments and U.s. Economic Census data on superstar firms (Kehrig and Vincent (2017), Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson, and Reenen (2017)) confirms the validity of our results based on the publicly traded firms in the Compustat. Their findings are consistent with our mechanism in that we also predict that relatively large and productive firms have high capital shares. However, our paper differs from Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson, and Reenen (2017) in several key respects. First, although both papers identify the effect that large firms have on the capital share, we provide a model-based explanation for the relationship between firm size and the capital share that relies on firm-level risk and selection. In contrast, Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson, and Reenen (2017) assume that the labor share of larger firms is smaller due to each firm's need for a fixed amount of overhead labor. They attribute the shift in the size distribution of firms to an exogenous increase in concentration, while we attribute it to an endogenous shift in the size distribution triggered by an increase in firm-level risk. Second, our mechanism also accounts for the increase in the mass of low-capital-share firms in the left tail, a key feature of the data, while their paper is silent on this. Third, we provide evidence from the cross-section of industries that the effect of idiosyncratic volatility on industry-level factor shares is robust to the inclusion of industry concentration measures. and thus similar effects hold in Europe and the U.K. Finally, our equilibrium framework allows us to conduct a quantitative analysis of our model's ability to match the data. We show that increases in both firm-level risk and rents are required to quantitatively match the data.  \n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section I describes the new stylized facts, and Section II describes our model's setup. Section IHI discusses the equilibrium of our model and its implications for the aggregate capital share. Section IV uses a calibrated version of our economy to explore the quantitative effects of changes in volatility on factor shares. Section V presents new empirical evidence on U.S. capital share dynamics. Section VI concludes.  \n\n## 1. New Stylized Facts: U.S. Factor Share Dynamics, Volatility, and Firm Size Distribution  \n\n### A. Factor Share Dynamics  \n\nTo measure capital share at the firm level, we use widely available accounting data from the Compustat/CRSP Merged Fundamentals Annual data set. The sample ranges from 1960 to 2014. We exclude financial firms that have SIC codes in the interval 6000 to 6799, as well as firms whose sales, number of employees and total assets are negative. We measure the aggregate capital share of output as the ratio of aggregate capital income todddd aggregate value added. Capital income is given as operating income before depreciation (OIBDP), which equals sales minus operating expenses including the cost of goods sold, labor costs, and other administrative expenses. Value added is given as the sum of OIBDP and XLR, which records staff expenses. We provide further details in Appendix AppendixA.  \n\nWe start by examining the time-series dynamics of the capital share of U.S. publicly traded firms as measured in the Compustat/CRSP Merged Fundamentals data set. As we document in Figure 1, the aggregate capital share for these firms increased from $41\\%$ in 1970 to $62\\%$ in 2010.  \n\nHowever, this trend does not hold for a typical U.S. frm. To demonstrate this, we analyze firmlevel data. Our measure of frm-level value added can be negative. Because capital income can also be negative, the ratio of capital income to value added at the firm level is not an informative  \n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Our key empirical contribution is to show that the increase in the capital share is concentrated among the largest publicly traded firms in the U.S. Figure 2 plots the relationship between firm size and the ratio of capital income to sales (which is a measure of the capital share of profits). In 1970 there was essentially no relation between firm size and the capitalincome-to-sales ratio, but by 2010 this ratio was strongly increasing. This shift caused the average and aggregate capital shares to diverge: the equal-weighted average capital share of publicly traded companies has declined since the 1980s.5  \n\nThe divergence between the aggregate and average capital share is illustrated in Figure 3. The average ratio of capital income to sales is the cross-sectional mean of the capital-income-to-sales ratio for a given year. The aggregate ratio equals the sum of capital income (OIBDP) across all firms divided by aggregate sales. The large declines in the average capital-income-to-sales ratio are driven mostly by small firms that have negative operating margins. The average ratio dropped from $13\\%$ in1960to $-40\\%$ in 2014, while the aggregate ratio increased, albeit less dramatically, from $14\\%$ in1960to $17\\%$ in 2014.6 Importantly, the decline in the average capital-income-to-sales ratio is mostly a within-industry phenomenon, but the increase in the aggregate ratio is driven largely by cross-industry effects: some industries with high aggregate capital-income-to-sales ratios have grown much more than others and therefore account for most of the increase in the aggregate capital-income-to-sales ratio, as documented in Section I of the Internet Appendix.  \n\n![](images/6876d05fccc1a20a422c60e876d012ae897f1b9b1301288d33b67f320f505768.jpg)  \nFigure 4.

The dashed lines are the HP-filtered trends. Source: Compustat/CRSP Merged Fundamentals Annual (1960 to 2014).  \n\nWe also compute measures of the labor income share. One drawback of the Compustat data is the lack of comprehensive labor expense data: XLR in Compustat is only reported for about $13\\%$ offirmyear observations. To address this weakness, we adopt Donangelo (2016)'s imputation procedure to construct the extended labor cost (extended XLR) for firms that failed to report staff expenses. To implement this measure, we group firms into 17 industries and then sort them into 20 size groups within each industry based on their total assets, thus obtaining a total of 340 industry-size cells. We estimate the average labor cost per employee (XLR/EMP) within each industry-size cell for each year using the available XLR observations and then use this estimate to impute labor costs for firms that have missing XLR data as the number of employees times the average labor cost per employee of the same industry-size cell during that year.7  \n\nThe aggregate labor-income-to-sales ratio in the nonfarm business sector declined by $15\\%$ . However, the average labor share of output did not decline in our sample of publicly traded firms. Figure 4 plots the time series of both the average and the aggregate labor-income-to-sales ratios in our sample using the estimated labor cost. The average labor share rose from $32\\%$ in 1960 to $40\\%$ in 2014, while the aggregate labor share (labor-income-to-sales-ratio) dropped from $22\\%$ to $11\\%$ during the same period. Our alternative measure of aggregate labor share, the ratio of labor income to value added, declined over the same period, from $59\\%$ to $40\\%$ (one minus the capital share from Figure 1). Our measure of the ratio of labor income to value added is lower than that of the BEA because our sample includes only publicly traded firms. As we show in section Appendix Appendix B , the aggregate labor share in the sample of firms that excludes those that are publicly traded actually increased over the last several decades. As a consequence, the drop in the aggregate labor share that we record in the publicly traded sector exceeds that for the U.S. economy as a whole.  \n\n### B.Firm-Level Volatility and the Firm Size Distribution  \n\nOver the same period, U.S. firms experienced a large increase in volatility. Figure 5 plots the log of firm-level volatility, which is computed as the equal-weighted average of the log volatility of the idiosyncratic component of stock returns or cash flows for all publicly traded U.S. firms. These volatility measures more than doubled over the period 1950-2000 (see, for example, Campbell, Lettau, Malkiel, and Xu (2001), Comin and Philippon (2005), Xiaolan (2014), Bloom (2014), Herskovic, Kelly, Lustig, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2016). As volatility increases, the right tail of the firm size distribution increases in mass. However, it is important to note that while Figure 5 plots annual changes in volatility, these changes are gradually impounded into the size distribution. As such, we also plot the log of the 10-year moving average of idiosyncratic volatility for both returns and sales growth, both of which have substantially increased over our sample period. These increases are borne out in a considerable shift in the size distribution of firms. Figure 6 indicates that from 1960 to 2014, the power law exponent $\\gamma$ , which is given by the solution to the equation $P({\\mathrm{Size}}>X)=k X^{-\\gamma}$ for some constant $k$ , decreased substantially. The average of our estimate for the power law exponent over 1960 to 1970 is 1.48 when using either total assets or sales to measure firm size. For the years 1990 to 2014, this average decreases to 1.13 when measuring size by total assets and to 1.11 when measuring firm size by sales.  \n\nWe note that our estimates for the power law exponent of the firm size distribution differ in an important way from estimates in extant literature, such as in Axtell (2001), Luttmer (2007), Gabaix and Landier (2008), and Ai, Kiku, and Li (2013). Prior research focuses on the distribution of firm size in the later part of our sample, for example, Axtell (2001) begins his analysis in 1988, while Gabaix and Landier (2008) begin their analysis in 1980. We show that the firm size distribution in the early part of our sample had a substantially higher power law exponent.  \n\nTo summarize, we document a divergence in the moments of the frm-level capital and labor  \n\n![](images/be6a5f3b9df0de1e633b74df817edd4295cbe4bec174f83b53b0720f676efd88.jpg)  \nPanel A: Idiosyncratic Return Volatility   \nPanel B: Idiosyncratic Sales Growth Volatility   \nFigure 5.

Specifically, the trends that we observe in the data are consistent with changes in firm-level volatility, and they cause a shift in the firm size distribution that favors the owners of capital.  \n\nIn Section II of the Internet Appendix, we show that the U.K. and, to a lesser extent, Europe, have experienced similar divergences between the aggregate and average factor shares over this sample as well as increases in firm-level risk. Japan, in contrast, has experienced neither.  \n\n## II. A Dynamic Model of Industry Equilibrium with Entry and Exit  \n\nIn this section, we present a model to rationalize the facts presented in Figures 1 and 2 and Section I. In our model, firms produce cash flows according to a simple production function. Importantly, the shareholders of a given firm hold an option to cease operations when productivity falls: this is the classic abandonment option. As is standard in the real options literature, increasing the volatility of firms' cash flows increases the value of the option to wait to abandon, which lowers the threshold of productivity at which the firm ceases operations.  \n\nWe embed an optimal risk-sharing contract between the skilled workers and the firm in our model. Beginning with the seminal work of Harris and Holmstrom (1982), a large body of literature has developed the settings under which it is optimal for firms to shield workers from risk. In Harris and Holmstrom (1982), the optimal labor contract protects a risk-averse worker from negative shocks  \n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.  \n\nto her perceived ability. However, positive shocks to worker ability increase her outside option and must be reflected in higher wages. Thus, the optimal contract features downward rigidity as a form of partial insurance. Berk, Stanton, and Zechner (2010) build on Harris and Holmstrom (1982) and show that in the presence of leverage, the optimal wage contract features temporary wage cuts when the firm is in financial distress and bankruptcy. As a result, the optimal capital structure takes into account employees' risk aversion. Our setting differs from Harris and Holmstrom (1982) and Berk, Stanton, and Zechner (2010) in that risk in our model is embodied entirely in the firm. This means that the optimal wage contract in our model features full insurance for the skilled worker.8  \n\nThere is strong evidence that firms insure workers. Guiso, Pistaferri, and Schivardi (2005), the first to study insurance within the firm using U.S. microdata, find that firms fully insure workers against transitory shocks but not against permanent shocks (see Rute Cardoso and Portela (2009), Fuss and Wintr (2009), Lagakos and Ordonez (2011), Friedrich, Laun, Meghir, and Pistaferri (2014), and Fagereng, Guiso, and Pistaferri (2017), for foreign evidence). Xiaolan (2014) finds direct evidence of increased cash flow volatility for firms that provide better insurance to workers. Lagakos and Ordonez (2011) find that the wages of low-skill workers are more responsive to shocks than those of high-skill workers. In our model, unskilled labor does not benefit from insurance. In a model with systematic shocks, Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou (2013) show that the outside options of skilled workers increase with positive systematic shocks, which increases skilled workers' share of firm profits and the riskiness of shareholder equity.  \n\nWhen we introduce moral hazard and other frictions that hamper risk sharing, our mechanism is mitigated. However, in Appendix Appendix D we show that when we allow workers some exposure to firm performance, our primary results remain unchanged. The selection mechanism still applies as long as a frm's owners provide some insurance to its workers and as long as the firm can exit when productivity declines.9  \n\nFinally, we characterize the stationary distribution of firms given the solution to the optimal abandonment problem. Increasing (idiosyncratic) cash flow volatility leads more firms to delay abandonment and to survive long enough to become highly productive. Thus, the average of the capital share of profits across firms decreases in volatility. Here, we use insights from recent work on firm sizedistribution.10  \n\n### A. Technology and Preferences  \n\nThe economy is populated by a measure of ex-ante identical firms, and each frm operates a standard production technology. A given firm $i$ with productivity $X_{i t}$ has a single skilled worker, rents physical capital $K_{i t}$ , and employs unskilled labor $L_{i t}$ . The total output produced by this firm is given by  \n\n$$\nY_{i t}=X_{i t}^{\\nu}F(K_{i t},L_{i t})^{1-\\nu},\n$$  \n\nwhere $F$ is homogeneous of degree one and $0<\\nu<1$ . The parameter $\\nu$ governs the decreasing returns to scale at the firm level. Lucas refers to $\\nu$ as the span of the control parameter of the firm's manager Atkeson and Kehoe (2005) show that a decrease in competition in a model with imperfect competition is equivalent to an increase in $\\nu$ in our model, and thus we interpret $\\nu$ as a measure of the level of economic rents in the economy. The aggregate supplies of physical capital and unskilled labor are denoted by $k$ and $\\boldsymbol{l}$ , respectively.  \n\nFirm productivity evolves according to  \n\n$$\nd X_{i t}=\\mu X_{i t}d t+\\sigma X_{i t}d Z_{t}^{i}-X_{i t}d N_{i t},~\\mathrm{for}~X_{i t}>X_{\\operatorname*{min}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $Z_{i t}$ is a standard Brownian motion that is independent across firms, $N_{i t}$ is a Poisson process with intensity $\\lambda$ , and $X_{\\mathrm{min}}>0$ is some minimum level of productivity. If $d N_{i t}=1$ or if $X_{i t}$ reaches $X_{\\mathrm{min}}$ ， $X_{i}$ jumps to zero and the firm exits. The process $N_{i t}$ gives rise to what is often referred to as an exogenous death rate of firms, and it is necessary to guarantee the existence of a stationary distribution of firms for all parametrizations of the model. Because all firms are identical up to their current level of productivity, we omit the subscript $i$ for the remainder of the discussion.  \n\nEach firm is owned by an investor and requires one skilled worker to operate. We assume that investors are risk-neutral and discount cash flows at the risk-free rate of $r>\\mu$ ,while skilled workers value a stream of payments $\\{c_{t}\\}_{t\\ge0}$ according to the following utility function:  \n\n$$\nU(\\{c_{t}\\}_{t\\ge0})=E\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\infty}e^{-r t}u(c_{t})d t\\right],\n$$  \n\nwhere $u^{\\prime}(c)\\geq0$ and $u^{\\prime\\prime}(c)<0$ . We normalize the measure of skilled workers in the economy to one.  \n\nFirms can enter and exit the economy at the discretion of their owners. When a firm exits, its owner receives the liquidation value of the firm, which we normalize to zero, and its skilled worker immediately re-enters the skilled labor market. There is a competitive fringe of shareholders waiting to create new firms. When a shareholder creates a new firm, she matches with a skilled worker and paysacost $P$ for the technology blueprint to begin production. After creating a new firm, the firm's initial productivity is drawn from a Pareto distribution with density  \n\n$$\nf(X)={\\frac{\\rho}{X^{1+\\rho}}};X\\in[1,\\infty).\n$$  \n\nThis distribution implies that the log-productivity of an entering firm is exponentially distributed  \n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.  \n\nwith parameter $\\rho>1$ , which simplifies the characterization of the equilibrium that follows. We denote the rate at which new firms are created by $\\psi_{t}$ . Note that this implies that the entry rate at a given point $X$ is $\\psi_{t}f(X)$  \n\nUpon matching with a skilled worker, an investor in a new firm offers a long-term contract to the skilled worker before the realization of the firm's productivity and the firm's payment of the cost $P$ . The skilled worker can reject the contract, at which point she is instantaneously matched with a new firm. Formally, this contract can be denoted by a process $\\{c_{t}\\}_{t\\ge0}$ , which determines a payment to the skilled worker of $c_{t}$ attime $t$ . We assume that the investor cannot commit to continue operations or to pay the skilled worker after the firm has ceased operations. We also assume that the skilled worker can choose to exit the contract and match with a new firm at any time, and we assume that she does not have access to a savings technology. This contracting environment features a two-sided limited commitment problem similar to Ai, Kiku, and Li (2013) and Ai and Li (2015). Importantly, the outside option of the skilled worker depends on the value of starting a new firm, which is endogenously determined in equilibrium. Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou (2013) consider a similar mechanism to explore the implications of the division of the surplus between shareholders and skilled workers for the cross-section of returns.  \n\n### B. The Investor's Problem  \n\nWe denote the utility that the skilled worker receives upon entering this market by $U_{0}$ ,which is also the skilled worker's reservation utility. At the inception of the contract, the investor and the skilled worker take $U_{0}$ as exogenously given, although it will be determined in equilibrium by the market for skilled workers. The investor will continue operations as long as doing so yields a positive present value. This means that the investor's value for operating the firm is the solution to a standard abandonment option. Specifically, the investor operates the firm until a stopping time denotedby $\\tau$ . The investor's problem is thus  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{max}_{K,L,\\tau,c}E\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\tau}e^{-r t}(Y_{t}-c_{t}-\\kappa K_{t}-w L_{t})d t\\right],\n$$  \n\nsuch that  \n\n$$\nU_{0}\\leq E\\left[\\int_{t}^{\\tau}e^{-r(s-t)}u(c_{s})d s+e^{-r(\\tau-t)}U_{0}\\right]{\\mathrm{~for~all~}}t>0.\n$$  \n\nThe problem contained in equations (2) and (3) is an optimal risk-sharing problem. Given that the investor is risk-neutral and the skilled worker is risk-averse, the investor chooses a compensation rule to minimize the skilled worker's exposure to risk. Intuitively, the skilled worker's limited commitment constraint given in equation (3) must be binding, as promising her a greater continuation value at any point in time can only reduce the investor's value for the firm. As a result, the skilled worker's value for the contract is constant over time, and it is without loss of generality that we restrict attention to contracts that offer the skilled worker a fixed wage of $c$ until the firm exits, at  \n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.  \n\nwhich point the skilled worker re-enters the market and receives her outside option. A consequence of this simple optimal contract is that a firm's size determines the payments that accrue to it's owners. This mechanism is similar to that of Atkeson and Kehoe (2005), who present a model in which a firm's age determines these payments.  \n\n### C. Equilibrium  \n\nWe focus our analysis on equilibria in which the measure of firms at any given level of productivity is stationary. We denote the stationary distribution of log-productivity by $\\phi(x)$ where $x=\\log(X)$ throughout.  \n\nDEFINITION 1: A stationary equilibrium consists of a rental rate $\\kappa$ for physical capital, a demand for physical capital as a function of productivity $K(X)$ , a wage rate $w$ for unskilled labor, a demand for unskilled labor $L(X)$ as a function of $X$ , a compensation $c^{*}$ for skilled workers, an entry rate of new firms $\\psi^{*}$ , an exit policy for the shareholder $\\bar{X}$ , and a stationary distribution $\\phi(x)$ such that:  \n\n1. the exit policy $\\bar{X}$ solves the investor's problem given by (2) and (3),   \n2. the stationary distribution $\\phi(x)$ is consistent with the entry rate of new frms of $\\psi$ and with the exit policy $\\bar{X}$ ，  \n\n3. the markets for physical capital, unskilled labor, and skilled workers clear  \n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty}K(x)\\phi(x)d x=k,\\int_{0}^{\\infty}L(x)\\phi(x)d x=l,{\\mathrm{~and}}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\phi(x)d x=1,\n$$  \n\n4. treating a new firm leaves the investor with zero expected NPV,  \n\n$$\n\\int_{1}^{\\infty}V(X;c)f(X)d X=P.\n$$  \n\nConditions 1 to 3 are standard equilibrium conditions. Condition 4 derives from the existence of the competitive fringe of investors waiting to create new firms. If an investor in a new firm offers a contract that leaves her with positive ex-ante expected NPV, then the skilled worker will reject it because she can simply re-enter the market and instantaneously match with a new firm. Thus, Condition 4 is equivalent to allocating all of the ex-ante bargaining power to the skilled worker. This in turn determines the level of skilled worker compensation. An alternative definition for Condition 4 would be to allocate some bargaining power to the investor, doing so would change the division of ex-ante rents but not how that division qualitatively depends on the key parameters of the model.  \n\n## III. Equilibrium Analysis  \n\nA. Equilibrium Allocation of Physical Capital and Unskilled Labor  \n\nTo characterize equilibrium, we begin by considering the allocation of physical capital and unskilled labor across active firms. Given spot rates for physical capital and unskilled labor and some  \n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.  \n\ncurrent level of productivity, a given firm chooses capital and labor to maximize profits, which are net of the rental payments to physical capital and wages to unskilled labor:  \n\n$$\n(K_{t},L_{t})=\\arg\\operatorname*{max}_{K,L}\\left\\{X_{t}^{\\nu}F(K,L)^{1-\\nu}-w L-\\kappa K\\right\\}.\n$$  \n\nThe homogeneity of the production function $F$ implies that the solution $(K_{t},L_{t})$ of the maximization above is linear in $X_{t}$ . Market-clearing then implies that physical capital and unskilled labor are allocated across firms according to the linear allocation  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle K_{t}=\\frac{k}{\\widehat X}X_{t},}}\\ {{\\displaystyle L_{t}=\\frac{l}{\\widehat X}X_{t},}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n{\\widehat{X}}=\\int_{x_{\\operatorname*{min}}}^{\\infty}e^{x}\\phi(x)d x\n$$  \n\nis the average productivity in the economy given the stationary distribution of log productivity $\\phi(x)$ This allocation rule implies that the output of any given firm is a linear function of aggregate output,  \n\n$$\nY_{t}=\\frac{y}{\\widehat{X}}X_{t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $y=\\widehat{X}^{\\nu}F(k,l)^{1-\\nu}$ is aggregate output. As a result, a frm's gross earnings (operating profits) are proportional to $X_{t}$  \n\n$$\nY_{t}-w L_{t}-\\kappa K_{t}=\\frac{\\nu y}{\\widehat{X}}X_{t}.\n$$  \n\nFor convenience, we let $\\begin{array}{r}{\\widehat{F}=\\frac{\\nu y}{\\widehat{X}}}\\end{array}$ .We refer to $\\widehat F$ as the equilibrium rents normalized by (average) productivity $\\hat{X}$  \n\n### $B$ ：Soluing the Investor's Problem  \n\nHaving determined the allocation of physical capital and unskilled labor, we can now analyze the investor's problem given in equation (2). Taking equilibrium rents $\\hat{F}$ as given and using the allocation rules given in equations (4) and (5) allows us to simplify the investor's problem to  \n\n$$\nV(X;c,{\\hat{F}}){=}\\operatorname*{max}_{\\tau}E\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\tau}e^{-r t}\\left({\\widehat{F}}X_{t}-c\\right)d t{|X_{0}=X}\\right],\n$$  \n\nwhere $V(X;c,{\\hat{F}})$ is the value of operating a frm with current productivity $X$ given a skilled worker contract $c$ and rents $\\widehat F$ .The payment $c$ to the skilled worker thus acts as a fixed cost or as operating leverage. As such, the optimal risk-sharing problem given in equations (2) and (3) reduces to an optimal abandonment problem as in real options models such as Brennan and Schwartz (1985) or to an optimal default problem as in Leland (1994). Thus, the investor in a given firm will choose to  \n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.  \n\nexit if productivity $X$ is low enough. Without loss of generality, we can restrict attention to firm exit times that are given by threshold rules of the form  \n\n$$\n\\tau=\\operatorname*{inf}\\{t|X_{t}\\leq{\\bar{X}}\\}\n$$  \n\nfor some $\\bar{X}\\geq0$  \n\nAn application of Ito's formula and the dynamic programming principle implies that $V(X;c)$ must satisfy the ordinary differential equation  \n\n$$\n(r+\\lambda)V(X;c,{\\widehat F})={\\widehat F}X-c+\\mu X\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X}V(X;c,{\\widehat F})+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}X^{2}\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial X^{2}}V(X;c,{\\widehat F}),\n$$  \n\nwith boundary conditions  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}&{}&{V(\\bar{X}(c,\\widehat{F});c,\\widehat{F})=0,}\\ &{}&{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X}V(\\bar{X}(c,\\widehat{F});c,\\widehat{F}))=0,}\\ &{}&{\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{lim}_{X\\to\\infty}\\left|V(X;c,\\widehat{F})-\\left(\\frac{\\widehat{F}X}{r+\\lambda-\\mu}-\\frac{c}{r+\\lambda}\\right)\\right|=0,}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\bar{X}(c,\\widehat{F})$ is the abandonment threshold given $c$ and $\\widehat F$ . Conditions (8) and (9) are the standard value-matching and smooth-pasting conditions that pin down the optimal exit threshold $\\bar{X}$ . Condition (10) arises because as $X_{t}$ tends toward infinity, abandonment occurs with zero probability and firm value is just the present value of all future profits.  \n\nThe solution to equations (7) to (10) is given by  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\nV(X;c,{\\widehat{F}})={\\frac{{\\widehat{F}}X}{r+\\lambda-\\mu}}\\left(1-\\left({\\frac{X}{{\\bar{X}}}}\\right)^{-(\\eta+1)}\\right)-{\\frac{c}{r+\\lambda}}\\left(1-\\left({\\frac{X}{{\\bar{X}}}}\\right)^{-\\eta}\\right),\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\bar{X}=\\left(\\frac{\\xi-1}{\\xi}\\right)\\bigg(\\frac{c}{\\widehat{F}}\\bigg),\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n\\eta=\\frac{\\mu-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}+\\sqrt{(\\mu-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2})^{2}+2(r+\\lambda)\\sigma^{2}}}{\\sigma^{2}},\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\xi=\\frac{-\\left(\\mu-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}\\right)+\\sqrt{(\\mu-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2})^{2}+2(r+\\lambda)\\sigma^{2}}}{\\sigma^{2}}\n$$  \n\nare the roots of the fundamental quadratic for equation (7). Note that an increase in firm-level Volatility $\\sigma$ invariably lowers the abandonment threshold (holding equilibrium rents $\\hat{F}$ constant) because an increase in volatility raises the option value of keeping the firm alive. This feature of the abandonment option plays a key role in our analysis. Its importance becomes apparent when we discuss the stationary distribution of firm size. Specifically, an increase in firm-level volatility leads to an increase in the mass of firms that delay exit, thus increasing the mass of firms that have low  \n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.  \n\nproductivity and the mass of firms that survive long enough to achieve high productivity.  \n\nGiven the solution for firm value conditional on a skilled worker's wage $c$ , and the Pareto entry distribution of new frms, it is straightforward to solve the investor's ex-ante zero-profit condition for the equilibrium c. We have  \n\n$$\nc^{*}=\\left(\\frac{P(r+\\lambda)(\\rho-1)(\\rho-\\eta)}{\\eta}\\left(\\frac{\\xi-1}{\\hat{F}\\xi}\\right)^{\\rho}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{\\rho-1}}.\n$$  \n\nThe derivation of $c^{*}$ is given in Appendix Appendix C. Note that $c^{*}$ depends on $\\sigma$ through $\\eta$ and $\\xi$  \n\n### C. Stationary Size Distribution  \n\nWe now consider the equilibrium distribution of productivity $\\phi(x)$ given an exit threshold of $\\bar{X}$ and rents $\\widehat F$ .For $\\phi(x)$ to be stationary, the expected change via inflow and outflow in the measure of firms at a given level of $x$ must equal the measure of frms that exogenously die at rate $\\lambda$ , less the measure of firms that endogenously enter at rate $\\psi g(x)$ . This leads to the following Kolmogorov forward equation for the stationary distribution of log productivity $\\phi(x)$  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{1}{2}}\\sigma^{2}\\phi^{\\prime\\prime}(x)-\\left(\\mu-{\\frac{1}{2}}\\sigma^{2}\\right)\\phi^{\\prime}(x)-\\lambda\\phi(x)+\\psi g(x)=0,\n$$  \n\nwhere $g(x)=\\rho e^{-\\rho x}$ is the density of initial log productivity $x$ for entering firms. A similar argument gives a boundary condition for $\\phi(x)$ at the exit barrier ${\\bar{x}}=\\log{\\bar{X}}$ ，  \n\n$$\n\\phi({\\bar{x}})=0.\n$$  \n\nThe final equation that determines the stationary distribution of firm size is given by the marketclearing condition for skilled workers:  \n\n$$\n\\int_{\\bar{x}}^{\\infty}\\phi(x)d x=1.\n$$  \n\nThe solution to equations (14) to (16) is given by  \n\n$$\n\\phi(x)=\\frac{\\rho\\gamma}{\\rho-\\gamma}\\left(e^{-\\gamma(x-\\bar{x})}-e^{-\\rho(x-\\bar{x})}\\right)\n$$  \n\nfor $x\\in[\\bar{x},\\infty)$ ,where $\\begin{array}{r}{\\gamma=\\frac{-(\\mu-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2})+\\sqrt{(\\mu-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2})^{2}+2\\sigma^{2}\\lambda}}{\\sigma^{2}}}\\end{array}$ . This solution also allows us to characterize the aggregate entry rate of new firms:  \n\n$$\n\\psi={\\frac{\\gamma(\\rho(\\mu-{\\frac{1}{2}}\\sigma^{2})+{\\frac{1}{2}}\\rho^{2}\\sigma^{2}-\\lambda)}{\\rho-\\gamma}}e^{\\rho\\bar{x}}.\n$$  \n\nWe note that our assumption about the density of the productivity of entering firms allows for the simple closed-form solutions shown above. The general solution to the ODE given in equation (14) is exponential. By assuming that $g(x)$ is also exponential, we are left with a solution to equation (14)  \n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

It can be shown that such a solution exists and is unique.  \n\nFigure 7 plots the complementary cumulative distribution function for the stationary distribution of firm productivity $X$ on the log axes for different levels of $\\sigma$ . The other parameters are calibrated at $r=5\\%,\\mu=2.5\\%,\\lambda=0.04,\\rho=3.5$ $\\alpha=0.3$ ， $k/l=1$ $\\nu=0.2$ ,and $P=1$ and are taken from our calibration of the model given in Section IV. As $X$ becomes large, the log of the mass of firms with productivity to the right of $X$ depends linearly on $\\log(X)$ , indicating that the stationary distribution of $X$ tends to a power law. The power law exponent of $X$ is given by the term $\\gamma$ :as $\\sigma$ increases, the power law exponent $\\gamma$ decreases and the stationary distribution becomes more diffuse, with a fatter right tail. It also shifts to the left because as firm-level volatility increases, the value of the option to wait to exit also increases, and the optimal point at which the investor chooses to exit necessarily decreases.  \n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.  \n\n### D. National Income Accounting  \n\nArmed with the stationary equilibrium, we can conduct national income accounting within our model. Specifically, we can calculate the aggregate capital share of output as  \n\n$$\n{\\mathrm{Capital~Share~of~Output}}=\\Pi={\\frac{y-w l-c}{y}}\n$$  \n\n$$\n=1-\\underbrace{(1-\\nu)(1-\\alpha(k,l))}_{\\substack{\\mathop{-}\\mathstrut\\textsc{j}}}-\\widehat{\\frac{c}{y}},\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n1-\\alpha(k,l)=\\frac{1}{F(k,l)^{-1}}\\frac{\\partial F(k,l)}{\\partial l}\n$$  \n\nis the elasticity of the production function $F$ with respect to unskilled labor. In other words, the capital share of output is one minus the total labor share, where the labor share aggregates the share of output that accrues to unskilled and skilled labor.  \n\n#### D.1. Idiosyncratic Volatility and the Capital Share  \n\nWe now consider how the aggregate capital share of output depends on idiosyncratic volatility. Note that the share of output that accrues to unskilled labor is independent of $\\sigma$ , so it suffices to consider how the share that accrues to skilled workers $\\frac{c}{y}$ depends on $\\sigma$ and then to abstract from the unskilled labor share by setting $\\nu=1$ . In this special case, $y=\\hat{X}$ , so aggregate output is just equal to the average productivity in the economy.  \n\nTo provide intuition for the effect of a comparative static change in idiosyncratic volatility on the capital share, it is useful to decompose the (skilled) labor share into its constituent parts. The denominator is the total output of all firms in the economy, and is given by  \n\n$$\n\\int_{\\bar{x}}^{\\infty}e^{x}\\phi(x)d x=\\left({\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}}\\right)\\left({\\frac{\\rho}{\\rho-1}}\\right){\\bar{X}}.\n$$  \n\nThe numerator is the total compensation paid to skilled workers $c$ . We demonstrate that the optimality of the exit threshold $\\bar{x}$ implies that $c$ is proportional using a quantity that we call “discounted average productivity.\" Although we derived the optimal exit threshold using the smooth-pasting condition in equation (9), the first-order condition for exit,  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\bar{x}}\\left(\\int_{0}^{\\infty}E\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\tau}e^{-r t}(e^{x_{t}}-c)d t|x_{0}=x\\right]g(x)d x\\right)=0,\n$$  \n\nis equivalent. This condition states that the optimal exit threshold $\\bar{x}$ must maximize the ex-ante firm  \n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.  \n\nvalue prior to the realization of the initial log productivity $x_{0}$  \n\nUsing an argument similar to that used to derive the stationary distribution $\\phi(x)$ , it canbe shown that  \n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty}E\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\tau}e^{-r t}(e^{x_{t}}-c)d t|x_{0}=x\\right]g(x)d x=A\\left(\\int_{\\bar{x}}^{\\infty}e^{x}\\theta(x)d x-c\\right),\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\nA=\\frac{e^{-\\rho\\bar{x}}\\eta}{(r+\\lambda)(\\eta+\\lambda)},\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n\\theta(x)=\\frac{\\xi\\rho}{\\xi-\\rho}(e^{-\\xi(x-\\bar{x})}-e^{-\\rho(x-\\bar{x})}),\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\xi=\\frac{-(\\mu-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2})+\\sqrt{(\\mu-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2})^{2}+2(r+\\lambda)\\sigma^{2}}}{\\sigma^{2}}.\n$$  \n\nNotethat $A$ is the survival annuity factor of the firm because it is equal to the ex-ante present value of a claim to a cash flow of one dollar for as long as the firm survives.  \n\nComparing $\\theta(x)$ to $\\phi(x)$ , or more specifically $\\xi$ to $\\gamma$ reveals that $\\theta(x)$ is the stationary distribution of log productivity in an economy equivalent to the one we describe above, but with a rate of exogenous exit equal to $r+\\lambda$ to account for the effect of discounting. Thus, it represents a transformed version of the stationary distribution that puts less weight on paths that are far from the center of mass of the entry distribution. We refer to  \n\n$$\n\\tilde{X}=\\int_{\\bar{x}}^{\\infty}e^{x}\\theta(x)d x=\\frac{\\xi\\rho\\bar{X}}{(\\xi-1)(\\rho-1)}\n$$  \n\nas the discounted average productivity of the economy.  \n\nWe can rewrite the first-order condition in equation (21) to obtain  \n\n$$\nc{\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial{\\bar{x}}}}={\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial{\\bar{x}}}}{\\tilde{X}}+A{\\frac{\\partial{\\tilde{X}}}{\\partial{\\bar{x}}}}.\n$$  \n\nThe right-hand side of equation (27) represents the marginal cost (in ex-ante terms) of delaying exit, that is, the present value of the additional wages that the firm will have to pay to the skilled worker. The left-hand side represents the marginal benefit (again in ex-ante terms) of delaying exit, that is., the present value of the additional gross cash flows that will accrue to the firm. This marginal benefit is determined by the effect that such a delay has on both the discounted average productivity of thefirm $\\tilde{X}$ and the survival annuity factor $A$  \n\nNote that $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial\\bar{x}}=-\\rho A}\\end{array}$ and $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{\\partial\\tilde{X}}{\\partial\\bar{x}}=\\tilde{X}}\\end{array}$ sion for compensation:  \n\n$$\nc=\\left(\\frac{\\rho-1}{\\rho}\\right)\\tilde{X}.\n$$  \n\nThe wage paid to the skilled worker is proportional to the ex-ante discounted average productivity of the firm, where the constant of proportionality adjusts for survivorship bias. Thus, if $\\nu=1$ ,the  \n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.  \n\ncapital share is given by  \n\n$$\n\\Pi=1-\\left({\\frac{\\rho-1}{\\rho}}\\right){\\frac{\\tilde{X}}{\\hat{X}}}=1-\\left({\\frac{\\rho-1}{\\rho}}\\right)\\left({\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma}}\\right)\\left({\\frac{\\xi}{\\xi-1}}\\right).\n$$  \n\nNote that $\\bar{X}$ appears in both the numerator and the denominator, and thus it cancels out. Intuitively, as $\\sigma$ increases, the right tail of the stationary distribution $\\phi(x)$ becomes fatter, i.e., the tail exponent $\\gamma$ decreases, and aggregate productivity $\\bar{X}$ increases. The right tail of $\\theta$ also becomes fatter, that is, $\\xi$ decreases, because the chance of any one firm becoming large increases. As a result, the discounted average productivity $\\tilde{X}$ also increases, but not by as much as $\\hat{X}$ because the paths that lead to large $x$ are now discounted in $\\theta(x)$ . As a result, the capital share increases. In the absence of discounting $(r=0)$ $\\xi$ and $\\gamma$ are identical, and the equilibrium capital share is governed only by the exogenous entry distribution parameter $\\rho$ $\\textstyle\\Pi=1-\\left({\\frac{\\rho-1}{\\rho}}\\right)$ and that is unaffected by volatility The above argument assumes that $\\nu=1$ , but this is not essential. We state this result formally in the following proposition.  \n\nPROPOSITION 1: The total capital share of output increases in frm-level risk, that is,  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\Pi}{\\partial\\sigma}>0.\n$$  \n\nThe argument behind Proposition 1 does not depend on how the level of compensation $c$ to the skilled worker is determined in equilibrium; rather, the essential relation between $c$ and discounted average productivity $\\tilde{x}$ stems from the optimality condition that governs the exit decision given in equation (21).  \n\n#### D.2. Rents and the Capital Share  \n\nWhile our focus is on the effect of changes in idiosyncratic volatility on the capital share, other parameters also have effects. In particular, the level of rents $\\nu$ affects the share of total output that accrues to both investors and the skilled worker. We can apply a similar argument to that of the previous section to show that the capital share of output is given by  \n\n$$\n+\\nu\\left(1-\\left({\\frac{\\rho-1}{\\rho}}\\right)\\left({\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma}}\\right)\\left({\\frac{\\xi}{\\xi-1}}\\right)\\right).\n$$  \n\nAn increase in $\\nu$ decreases the physical capital share but does not affect the capital share of rents. Thus, an increase in $\\nu$ increases the total capital share of output if and only if the decrease in the physical capital share of output is less than the increase in the share of output that investors get from rents.  \n\nWhile an increase in rents $\\nu$ has an ambiguous effect on the capital share, a joint increase in both $\\nu$ and $\\sigma$ unambiguously increases the capital share. We summarize this result in the following proposition.  \n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.  \n\nPROPOSITION 2: The capital share of output increases in the level of rents if and only if the capital share of rents exceeds the elasticity of production with respect to physical capital, that is,  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\Pi}{\\partial\\nu}>0\n$$  \n\nif and only if  \n\n$$\n\\alpha(k,l)<1-\\left({\\frac{\\rho-1}{\\rho}}\\right)\\left({\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma}}\\right)\\left({\\frac{\\xi}{\\xi-1}}\\right).\n$$  \n\nMoreover, a joint increase in the level of rents and firm-level risk increases the total capital share of output i; that is,  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\Pi}{\\partial\\nu\\partial\\sigma}>0.\n$$  \n\n#### D.3. The Capital Share on Average  \n\nAlthough our main focus in this paper is to understand the changes in the aggregate capital share, we also document that the average capital share has decreased over our sample period. As volatility or rents increase, the optimal abandonment point shifts to the left and the mass of less productive firms with low capital shares in the left tail of the stationary distribution increases. These firms can cause the average firm-level capital share to decrease. Recall that the output of a firm with produtivity $X_{t}$ isgiven by $\\begin{array}{r}{Y_{t}=y\\frac{X_{t}}{\\hat{X}}}\\end{array}$ . Thus, we can use silar arguments as those aboveto show that the average capital share is given by  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}{{\\mathsf{a}}\\operatorname{Capital}\\operatorname{Share}=1-(1-\\nu)(1-\\alpha(k,l))+{\\frac{c}{y}}\\int_{\\bar{x}}^{\\infty}\\left({\\frac{\\hat{X}}{e^{x}}}\\right)\\phi(x)d x}\\ {=\\qquad\\underbrace{(1-\\nu)\\alpha(k,l)}_{\\qquad\\alpha}}&{\\qquad+\\nu\\quad\\left(1-\\left({\\frac{\\rho}{\\rho+1}}\\right)\\left({\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma+1}}\\right)\\left({\\frac{\\xi}{\\xi-1}}\\right)\\right)}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nAverage Capital Share of Rents  \n\nAs a result, an increase in $\\nu$ will decrease the average capital share if the average capital share of rents is greater than the elasticity of the production function with respect to physical capital. The comparative static of the average capital share with respect to $\\sigma$ does not have a simple closed form. Intuitively, the increased mass of firms with low productivity—and hence low firm-level capital share—resulting from a delay in the optimal abandonment time have a relatively large effect on the simple average of the capital share across firms. As a result, the average capital share will decrease in response to a comparative static increase in $\\sigma$ , as we show in a calibrated version of our model.  \n\nThe behavior of the average capital share distinguishes our mechanism from that of Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson, and Reenen (2017). Their mechanism accounts for an increase in the mass of highproductivity, low-labor-share firms by appealing to an increase in concentration, and it does not provide an explanation for the accompanying increase in low-productivity, low-capital-share firms that we document in the data. In our model, an optimal risk-sharing contract implies that lowcapital-share firms will remain active longer in response to increased firm-level risk and that the  \n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Model Calibration and Quantitative Experiments  \n\nIn this section, we explore the quantitative implications of our model. We calibrate the economy to match the empirical moments of the distribution of the capital share of output across firms in the U.S. Compustat sample. We then consider the effects of changes in the underlying parameters to quantify the effect of our mechanism on the aggregate and average capital shares and the labor share.  \n\n### A. Calibration  \n\nWe first calibrate the model to match the aggregate moments from the sample of U.S. publicly traded firms from 1960 to 1970. Panel A in Table I reports the moments that we set out to match. One caveat is that we are not able to use value added to compute the firm-level capital share because a large number of firms have negative value added. When estimating the average capital share for calibration, we use the adjusted value added instead of sales at the firm level as the denominator, which allows us to obtain empirical moments of the firm-level capital share that are more consistent with our theoretical counterpart without having to drop the negative value added observations. Further details on the data are provided in Appendix Appendix A.  \n\nPanel B of Table I reports the preset parameters. We choose a discount rate of $r=5\\%$ and note that this discount rate also accounts for aggregate growth and risk that we omit from the model. We follow Atkeson and Kehoe (2005) and set $\\nu=0.2$ and $\\alpha=0.27$ .Weset $\\sigma=0.2$ to match our data on the volatility of returns that we use to generate Figure 5. The capital labor ratio $k/l$ and the cost of starting a new firm do not affect our target moments, so we normalize these parameters to one.  \n\nPanel C reports the parameters that we chose to match the moments in Panel A. Although our model is simple, it is able to roughly match the moments of the data given reasonable parameters. We do not directly model the aggregate growth rate of the economy, thus the drift parameter $\\mu$ represents idiosyncratic growth beyond aggregate growth prior to firm exit. We calibrate $\\mu$ , the death rate $\\lambda$ ， and the parameter $\\rho$ , which governs the entry distribution, to match the cross-sectional standard deviation of the firm-level capital share, the capital share at the exit threshold $\\bar{X}$ ,and thepowerlaw exponent of firm size as closely as possible. The aggregate physical capital share of output is then chosen to match the aggregate and average capital share as closely as possible. Our model produces an aggregate capital share that is too low, an average capital share that is too high, and too little dispersion of capital shares, mostly because the entry distribution of new firms is misspecified, which results in a stationary distribution with insufficient dispersion in the left tail and the middle of the distribution. Our calibration of $\\lambda$ and $\\rho$ produces an entry rate of firms of $13.4\\%$ , while the average IPO rate is only $3.4\\%$ in the 1980 to 2015 sample.11 Obviously, we cannot match this secular trend in a stationary equilibrium. A more realistic entry distribution would enable the model to match the data moments more closely while producing a lower entry rate, albeit at the cost of reduced tractability. Moreover, introducing some flexibility in the relationship between firm size, expected growth, and volatility would allow for a lower rate of exit—and hence entry—albeit at the cost of reduced tractability.  \n\n# Table I. Benchmark Calibration.  \n\nThe table reports our benchmark calibration. Panel A reports the target moments in the data and the implied moments from our production model. The data moments are computed from the sample Compustat/CRSP Merged Fundamentals Annual from 1960 to 1970. The sample excludes firms that have SIC codes from 6000 to 6799. Panel B reports the calibrated parameters, and Panel C reports the preset parameters. Firm-level value added $\\mathrm{VA}_{i}$ is OIBDP plus Extended XLR. To deal with negative values, we identify the minimum operating income (OIBDP) for each year and we increase the value added of all firms by the absolute value of the minimum ${\\mathrm{OIBDP}}\\times(1{+}1\\%)$ .The average capital share is computed using OIBDP divided by the adjusted value added. The standard deviation and skewness of the capital share are also estimated using the adjusted value-added measure. The aggregate capital share is calculated using the unadjusted value added, and the capital share at the exit threshold $\\bar{X}$ is measured as the average capital share three years prior to delisting.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Panel A: Capital Share Moments 1960-1970</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Data</td><td>Model</td></tr><tr><td>Average Capital Share</td><td>0.210</td><td>0.264</td></tr><tr><td>Aggregate Capital Share</td><td>0.419</td><td>0.374</td></tr><tr><td>Standard Deviation of Capital Share</td><td>0.152</td><td>0.096</td></tr><tr><td>Capital Share at Exit</td><td>0.076</td><td>0.040</td></tr><tr><td>Power Law Exponent of Firm Size</td><td>1.480</td><td>1.295</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Panel B: Preset Parameters</td></tr><tr><td>r</td><td>0.05 Discount Rate</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.2</td><td>Share of Rents in GDP</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.2</td><td>Idiosyncratic Vol</td></tr><tr><td>k/l</td><td>1</td><td>Capital/Labor Ratio</td></tr><tr><td>p</td><td>1</td><td>Sunk Cost</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Panel C: Calibrated Parameters</td></tr><tr><td>μ</td><td>0.025</td><td>Firm Growth</td></tr><tr><td>入</td><td>0.04</td><td>Exogenous Exit Rate</td></tr><tr><td>d</td><td>3.5</td><td>Entrants’ Firm Size Distribution</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.3</td><td>Aggregate Physical Capital Share of Output</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n### B. Quantitative Experiments  \n\nNext, we use the benchmark calibration of the model to conduct a series of experiments reported in Table II. We report the changes in firm-level capital share distribution and firm size distribution when increasing volatility $\\sigma$ andrentshare $\\nu$  \n\nAs we document in Figure 5, firm-level volatility has increased dramatically over the past five decades. In particular, the volatility of the idiosyncratic component of sales growth has roughly doubled. When we double the volatility from the baseline of $\\sigma=20\\%$ to $\\sigma=40\\%$ , the model predicts a decline in the average capital share of output of 8.7 percentage points and an increase in the aggregate capital share of output of 1.3 percentage points. These numbers mask large changes in the distribution of rents. In the benchmark calibration of our model, owners collect only $12.2\\%$ of total rents at the average firm, but $67.5\\%$ of aggregate rents. To translate the change in the capital share of output to a change in the capital share of rents, we must consider that these rents are a fraction of the output given by $\\nu$ . Thus, doubling volatility increases the aggregate share of rents collected by owners by 6.4 percentage points (roughly 1.3 percentage points divided by $\\nu=0.2,$ and decreases the average share of rents by 43 percentage points (roughly 8.7 percentage points divided by $\\nu=0.2,$ . Doubling idiosyncratic volatility also leads to a decrease in the power law exponent of firm size from $\\gamma=1.295$ to $\\gamma=1.130$ . While this decrease is sizable, the decrease that we document in the data is larger. This could indicate that either $\\sigma$ has more than doubled or that the growth rate $\\mu$ has increased. In any case, our model would deliver a larger increase in the aggregate capital share if we were to match a larger decline in the power law exponent.  \n\nThere is increasing evidence that rents, represented in our model by the parameter $\\nu$ , have increased. In particular, many authors have documented evidence of an increase in intangible capital formed by U.S. corporations (e.g., Hall (2001), Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel (2009), Corrado and Hulten (2010), and Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou (2014)). These empirical measures of intangible capital correspond to the capitalized value of rents that accrue to the owners of the capital stock.12 To arrive at a reasonable increase in $\\nu$ to examine in our quantitative experiments, we note that an increase in $\\nu$ in our model leads to an increase in the firm's valuation. Economic rents are back-loaded in the model, and hence market value rises relative to its replacement cost as $\\nu$ rises (see Appendix Appendix E). In Figure 8, Panel A, we document a secular increase in the aggregate market-to-book ratio of the Compustat firms. In Figure 8, Panel B, we show that doubling rents from the baseline of $\\nu=0.2$ to $\\nu=0.4$ corresponds to a similar increase.  \n\nThe quantitative effects of doubling $\\nu$ are reported in the third column of Table I1. If investors did not have to share rents with skilled workers, doubling $\\nu$ would correspond to a $\\nu(1-\\alpha)=24$ percentage point increase in the capital share. However, because investors receive only a fraction of rents, doubling $\\nu$ increases the capital share by 7.5 percentage points. While the increase in $\\nu$ leads to a sizable effect on the aggregate capital share, it has a small effect on the distribution of the capital share across the firm size distribution and thus it has a relatively small effect on the average capital share, decreasing it by 3.5 percentage points. The parameter $\\nu$ does not affect the power law exponent of the firm size distribution in the model.  \n\n![](images/04cbee907a945bbf10f83e18ec35cf7bab24035e963e743cae6f3b42bd27b0ce.jpg)  \nFigure 8.

The market value of an individual firm $i$ is measured as Total Assets $+$ StockPrice $\\times$ Common Shares Outstanding - Common/Ordinary Equities. Source: Compustat/CRSP Merged Fundamentals Annual (1960 to 2014). Parameter values for the value-to-book ratio given in Panel B are taken from our benchmark calibration in Table I. captionValuation Ratio  \n\nThe changes in $\\sigma$ and $\\nu$ alone have limited success in explaining the actual target moments of the data. In particular, doubling $\\sigma$ can explain roughly half of the decrease in the average capital share, but it leads to a small increase in the aggregate capital share. Similarly, doubling $\\nu$ can explain a third of the increase in the aggregate capital share, but a relatively small part of the increase in the average capital share, and it is not consistent with the change in the size distribution that we see in the data. Either parameter predicts smaller changes in the aggregate and average capital shares than occur in the data. However, the effect of a change in volatility operates through the division of rents: when rents are larger, the effects of a change in volatility on the aggregate and average capital shares of profits will be larger. Therefore, we next consider a joint increase in both volatility and the size of rents.  \n\nWe report the effect of a joint increase in $\\sigma$ and $\\nu$ in the fourth column of Table II. In this case, the model predicts an increase of 10.1 percentage points in the aggregate capital share and a decrease of 20.9 percentage points in the average capital share. When we increase the discount rate to $10\\%$ ,the increase in the aggregate capital share is 11.5 percentage points, while the decrease in the average capital share is 11.1 percentage points. Increases in $\\nu$ have minor effects on the aggregate capital share, except when they are augmented by increases in $\\sigma$ . Finally, only increases in $\\sigma$ lower the average capital share.  \n\nLastly, we examine the quantitative effects of changes in discounting alone by changing $r$ from  \n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.  \n\n$5\\%$ to $10\\%$ . Such an increase could be the result of an increase in real interest rates or macroeconomic risk. Increasing the discount rate increases the difference between the discounted average productivity and aggregate productivity, and hence it increases the capital share. This increase is similar in magnitude to the increase in capital share that results from an increase in $\\sigma$ .However, increasing the discount rate leads to an increase in the average capital share because an increase in the discount rate decreases the value of the option to wait and therefore increases the exit threshold. This, in turn, reduces the mass of small low-capital-share firms and hence raises the average capital share.  \n\n# TableII. Changes in the Capital Share and the Firm Size Distributions from 1960-1970 to 1990-2014.  \n\nThis table presents changes in the average and aggregate capital shares and the size distribution of firms in the data and compares them to the changes predicted by the model given a change in the key model parameters. To calculate the change in moments in the data, we subtract the moments measured over the time period of 1960 to 1970 from the same moments measured over the time period 1990 to 2014.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Data</td><td colspan=\"4\">Model</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td colspan=\"4\">→20 →2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td colspan=\"4\">r =0.05</td></tr><tr><td> Average Capital Share</td><td>-0.118</td><td>-0.087</td><td>-0.035</td><td>-0.209</td><td>0.030</td></tr><tr><td>△ Aggregate Capital Share</td><td>0.138</td><td>0.013</td><td>0.075</td><td>0.101</td><td>0.011</td></tr><tr><td>△ Capital Share at X</td><td>-0.574</td><td>-0.235</td><td>-0.260</td><td>-0.732</td><td>0.068</td></tr><tr><td>△ Power Law Exponent of Firm Size</td><td>-0.346</td><td>-0.165</td><td>0</td><td>-0.164</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>→2g</td><td>→2v</td><td>→2g</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>→2v</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td colspan=\"4\">r = 0.10</td></tr><tr><td>△ Average Capital Share</td><td>-0.118</td><td>-0.053</td><td>-0.005</td><td>-0.111</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>△ Aggregate Capital Share</td><td>0.138</td><td>0.014</td><td>0.086</td><td>0.115</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>△ Capital Share at X</td><td>-0.574</td><td>-0.150</td><td>-0.191</td><td>-0.491</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>△ Power Law Exponent of Firm Size</td><td>-0.346</td><td>-0.165</td><td>0</td><td>-0.164</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n## V. Empirical Evidence Linking U.S. Capital Share Dynamics and Idiosyncratic Volatility  \n\nIn this section, we present empirical evidence on the joint dynamics of compensation, firm size, and the implied capital share dynamics. We show that the findings are largely consistent with the implications of our model.  \n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.  \n\n### A. Cross-Sectional Variation in Capital Share Dynamics  \n\nA key prediction of our model is that the distribution of capital shares across firm size becomes more dispersed as idiosyncratic volatility increases. In particular, the capital shares of the smallest firms decrease because small firms with low profitability delay exit when volatility increases. The cross-sectional variation in the capital shares bears this out. Over the period 1960 to 2014, firm-level volatility doubled, and the capital share of the smallest firms significantly decreased. Figure 9 presents the time series of the average capital-income-to-sales ratio for different size quintiles.13 Firms are sorted into five quintiles based on their total assets, and we compute the average capital-income-to-sales ratio in each quintile. We emphasize two aspects of this figure. First, the capital-income-to-sales ratio is increasing in firm size at each date, which is consistent with the core mechanism of our model: larger and more productive firms have higher capital shares ex post because their shareholders bear more risk than their skilled workers. Second, the average capitalincome-to-sales ratio tends to decline more in the smaller size quintiles, while it increases for large firms (the last quintile). Taken together, these facts indicate that while the aggregate capital share has increased, this increase is driven exclusively by the largest firms. These facts are also consistent with our model. As volatility increases, the dispersion of the size distribution of frms increases, which in turn increases the dispersion in the distribution of capital shares because larger (and more productive) firms have larger capital shares.  \n\nThe increase in the dispersion of capital shares across the firm size distribution is also present within industries. To demonstrate this, we repeat the exercise carried out in Figure 9 within four industry groups: consumer goods, manufacturing, health products and information, and computers and technology (i.e., high tech industries). Industries are defined using the Fama-French five-industry classification. We omit the industry classification “other\" because it contains few firms. We fix the industry definition over time and sort firms into five size quintiles within each industry. Figure 10 plots the results. We find similar cross-sectional patterns within each industry: the dispersion of the capital-income-to-sales ratio across size groups increases over the last five decades, while the more significant decline occurs in the smaller size quintiles. Interestingly, we observe a greater increase in the dispersion in the capital-income-to-sales ratio in the high tech and health products industries, which have a relatively larger change in firm-level volatility. In Section I of the Internet Appendix, we show that these patterns continue to hold when we exclude NASDAQ firms.  \n\n### B. Volatility and Capital Share Dispersion  \n\nTo provide more evidence on the link between volatility and the dispersion of the capital share within industries, we regress the industry-level average capital-income-to-sales ratio on the average firm-level volatility within industries at the two- and three-digit SIC code level. The decline in the average capital-income-to-sales ratio is mostly a within-industry phenomenon. We include industry and time fixed effects. The regression results are reported in Table II. As shown in column (1), a one-standard-deviation (0.21) increase in firm-level stock return volatility corresponds to a 12- percentage-point decline in the average capital-income-to-sales ratio. In column (2), a one-standarddeviation (0.186) increase in the moving average of past idiosyncratic volatility is associated with a 17-percentage-point drop in the industry average capital income-to-sales ratio. The moving average captures the long-run change in idiosyncratic volatility, and the effect is quantitatively larger since the capital share and the firm size distribution reflect both the contemporaneous volatility and the cumulative effect of past volatility. In column (3), the effect of firm-level sales growth volatility on capital share is less significant, likely because sales growth volatility is estimated using five-year sales growth data instead of contemporaneous sales growth.14 However, the effect in column (3) is economically sizable: a one-standard-deviation (0.204) increase in sales growth volatility above that industry's mean volatility leads to a drop of approximately eight percentage points in the average capital-income-to-sales ratio below that industry's mean ratio.  \n\n![](images/8d224a482eed6487dd751d9c49420cfeb802dee044b592f17c6ea7cafcf4a4d6.jpg)  \nFigure 9. Capital-income-to-sales ratio by firm size. This figure presents the average capitalincome-to-sales ratio by size over time. Size is measured by total assets, and the capital-income. to-sales ratio is measured as operating income (OIBDP) divided by sales. For each year, firms are categorized into five groups based on their total assets. We then estimate the average capital-incometo-sales ratio within each group for a given year. Source: Compustat-CRSP merged Fundamentals Annualfor 1960 to2014.  \n\nThis relation between the average capital share and firm-level volatility is robust to controlling for various concentration measures. Barkai (2016) and Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson, and Reenen (2017) emphasize that increased concentration drives the secular factor shares. We construct concentration measures based on Compustat-reported sales; we also use census concentration measures  \n\n![](images/a91072af900571d546c875a7ad8863021e8796b472a540938a77ab395683d7aa.jpg)  \nFigure 10.

The negative effect of firm-level return risk on average capital shares holds at the two- and three-digit SIC code levels. These results are reported in Section II of the Internet Appendix.  \n\nFinally, using Compustat Global, we run the same regression for the U.K., Europe, and Japan. We find statistically significant negative coefficient estimates for firm-level volatility in all three cases: a one-standard-deviation increase in volatility above the industry (three-digit SIC-code) average lowers the average capital share by 2.7 percentage points, 3.5 percentage points, and 0.5 percentage points in the U.K., Europe, and Japan, respectively. This effect is economically significant in the U.K. and Europe (although smaller than that in the U.S.), but not in Japan. Section II of the Internet Appendix provides details.  \n\n### C. Further Evidence  \n\nWe also examine vintage effects of the capital share dynamics. For each year, we identify firms in thetop $20\\%$ of the size distribution (measured by total assets or sales). Among the top $20\\%$ (bottom $20\\%$ ) percent of largest (smallest) firms, we identify the entry year of each firm and group them into five entry cohorts (1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s). We then compute the average capitalincome-to-sales ratio of each entry cohort. First, the average capital-income-to-sales ratio among the largest firms trends up for all cohorts, not just the most recent ones. Second, there is a strong vintage effect amongst the smallest firms, which is consistent with our model: the capital-incometo-sales ratios are lower for younger vintages that have experienced higher idiosyncratic volatility early on in their lifespans, in line with the higher option value of waiting. The Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson, and Reenen (2017) mechanism cannot speak to this vintage effect in the left tail. This evidence is reported in Section IV of the Internet Appendix.  \n\nTo provide further evidence that the patterns that we see in the dynamics of capital shares across the firm size distribution are consistent with firms delaying exit, we directly examine the capital shares of firms close to the exit boundary. Specifically, we investigate firms that exit the public domain due to poor company performance (e.g., liquidation, insolvency, bankruptcy) by obtaining the security delisting information from the CRSP U.S. Stock Event database. Figure 11 plots the capitalto-sales ratio three years before delisting for these firms. Consistent with our model, the average capital share of firms three years before delisting declined by almost 90 pps from 1970 to 2014. This result remains largely unchanged if we consider the capital share five years before delisting.  \n\n## VI. Conclusion  \n\nWe propose a mechanism through which an increase in firm-level volatility drives a wedge between national income accounting and the ex-ante assessment of firm profitability. A firm's owner insures skilled workers against firm-level productivity shocks and may choose to exit if productivity becomes too low. In our optimal contracting model, the level of skilled workers? compensation is proportional to the expected value of new firms, which necessarily integrates over paths that end  \n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

In contrast, in the national income accounts, one integrates only over ex-post surviving firms that necessarily feature higher capital shares. This leads to a difference between the aggregate capital share of income, which is calculated ex post, and the capital share of value at the origination of the frm, which is calculated ex ante. When firm-level volatility increases, more firms end up in the right tail of the size distribution. These outcomes are immediately reflected in the stationary distribution of productivity, but they are discounted when the values of new firms are calculated. Thus, they have a larger impact on aggregate productivity, and hence output, than on the payments to skilled workers. As a result, the aggregate capital share increases. We present a calibrated version of our model that replicates the key moments of the data with reasonable parameters via increases in firm-level volatility, but only if accompanied by an increase in rents. Finally, we present time series and cross-sectional evidence for Compustat firms that are consistent with our proposed mechanism.  \n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

The Sample  \n\nThe Compustat/CRSP Merged Fundamental Annual database contains accounting data and stock return data for all publicly traded firms. The sample runs from 1960 to 2014 and it includes all Compustat/CRSP firms (both active and inactive).15 We exclude financial firms (SIC codes 6000 to 6799) from our main analysis, ase well as firms that have negative sales, negative number of employees, negative total assets, negative staff expenses (XLR), negative R&D expenses (XRD), or negative selling, general, and administrative expenses (XSGA). Finally, we exclude firms with the currency code (CURCD) for Canadian dollars to focus on U.S. firms only. All of the variables are winsorized at the $1\\%$ level unless indicated otherwise.  \n\n### A.2. Variable Construction  \n\nWe measure a frm's capital income using operating income before depreciation (OIBDP). The capital share of output is defined as OIBDP/Sales.  \n\nLabor income is measured using the labor cost reported by public frms. Because public frms are not required to file Staff Expenses (XLR), we obtain only sparse observations of labor costs from the Compustat database. Thus, following Donangelo (2016), we construct the extended labor cost (extended XLR). First, we estimate the average labor cost per employee (XLR/EMP) within the industry-size group for each year. Industries are classified using the Fama-French 17-industry definition, and firms are sorted into 20 size groups based on their total assets, which yields a total of 340 industry-size groups.16 Then, the labor cost of a firm with missing XLR equals the number of employees multiplied by the average labor cost per employee of the same industry-size group during that year. We winsorize the extended XLR at the $5\\%$ level. We measure the labor share of output as extended labor cost (XLR)/Sales. We further winsorize the labor-costs-to-sales-ratio and capital-income-to-sales-ratio at the $1\\%$ level to exclude outliers from the approximation.  \n\nValue added (VA) is defined as OIBDP $^+$ extended XLR. We winsorize VA at the $5\\%$ level to exclude outliers from the approximation of extended XLR. We calculate the capital share as OIBDP/VA and calculate the labor share as extended XLR/VA. We also winsorize the capital share (OIBDP/VA) and labor share (extended XLR/VA) at the $5\\%$ level to avoid the influence of outliers.  \n\nIn the calibration exercise, we estimate the adjusted value added to address negative values. We identify the minimum operating income (OIBDP) for each year. We then increase the value added of all firms by the absolute value of the minimum OIBDP $\\times(1+1\\%)$ . The adjusted VA is then VA $+\\mathrm{abs}(\\operatorname*{min}(\\mathrm{OIBDP})\\times(1+1\\%))$  \n\nWe measure firm-level volatility using both idiosyncratic cash flow volatility and idiosyncratic stock return volatility. Idiosyncratic stock returns are constructed within each year by obtaining the residual of a Fama-French three-factor model using all of the daily stock returns within that year,  \n\n$$\nr_{i t}=\\gamma_{0,i}+\\gamma_{1,i}M K T_{t}+\\gamma_{2,i}H M L_{3,i}+\\epsilon_{i,t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $t$ is a daily observation of stock returns within year $T$ . Idiosyncratic stock return volatility for firm $i$ in year $_T$ is calculated as the annualized standard deviation of $\\epsilon_{i,t}$ within that year.  \n\nTo obtain the idiosyncratic cash flow volatility, we use the same factor specification as that in the idiosyncratic return volatility. Sales growth is winsorized at the $1\\%$ level in the full sample to exclude outliers. For each quarter $t$ , we estimate the factor model using quarterly sales growth data in prior 20 quarters up to calender year $T$ . Since there is no predominant factors for cash flow growth, we follow Herskovic, Kelly, Lustig, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2016) and use the first five major principal components of the prior 20 quarters sales growth. The data requires firms with no missing observations in the 20-quarter window ending in year $T$ . Idiosyncratic cash flow volatility is the annualized standard deviation of the residuals of a sales growth factor specification.  \n\nWe obtain the measure of capital income for nonpublicly traded firms by subtracting the aggregate capital income of Compustat firms from the aggregate capital income of the U.S. economy. The aggregate capital income is measured using the NIPA table Net Operating Surplus, which measures the aggregate business income from production after subtracting labor costs, taxes on production and imports (less subsidies), and consumption of fixed capital (economic depreciation) from value added, but before subtracting financing costs (such as net interest) and business transfer payments. Net operating surplus is a profit-like measure that is conceptually closest to earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) in the NIPA tables (see Mead, Moulton, and Petrick (2004)).  \n\nWe obtain the security delisting information from the CRSP U.S. Stock Events database. The delisting Code is a three-digit integer code that (a) indicates whether a security is still trading or (b) provides a specific reason for delisting. We consider delisting due to liquidation (delisting codes 400 to 490) and delisting by the current exchange due to poor company fundamentals (e.g., insolvency, bankruptcy, insufficient capital (delisting codes 550 to 591)). We then calculate the average capital shares three years before delisting.  \n\n## Appendix B. Public vs. Private  \n\nOur empirical analysis focuses on publicly traded frms. However, Davis, Haltiwanger, Jarmin, Miranda, Foote, and Nagypal (2006) find that nonfarm firm-level volatility in the private sector has declined in recent decades. According to the logic of our model, the aggregate capital share for private firms in the U.S. should not have increased over the same period. Using the NIPA net operating surplus (NOS), which is a profit-like measure that aggregates the overall operating income of the U.S. economy, we infer the operating income of private frms by subtracting the aggregate operating income of publicly traded firms (Compustat/CRSP firms) from the NIPA net operating surplus.

Aggregate capital share of U.S.: Public versus private decomposition. This figure decomposes the aggregate capital share (black solid line) for all U.S. industries into the share due to private frms (gray solid line) and the share due to public firms (dashed black line). The universe of private firms covers all firms except publicly traded frms in Compustat. The aggregate capital share of U.S. value added is the ratio of NIPA's net operating surplus retrieved from FRED and the total value added from the BEA's GDP-by-industry accounts. Private capital income is obtained by subtracting the aggregate capital income (earnings before interest and tax) reported by Compustat public firms from the NIPA net operating surplus. The private (public) share is the ratio of private (public) aggregate capital income and total value added. The dotted lines are the HP-filtered trends of the three time series of capital shares.

Compustat/CRSP Merged Fundamentals Annual (1960 to 2014).  \n\nure B1 decomposes the aggregate capital share of total value added into a private component and a public component. The component due to private firms, the ratio of the aggregate operating income of private firms to total value added, declined from 1969 to 2014 even though the private sector has grown recently (the number of publicly listed firms has decreased $14\\%$ since 1996 (Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2017)).  \n\n## Appendix C. Proofs and Derivations  \n\n### C.1. Derivation of Equilibrium Compensation  \n\nThe equilibrium wage is given as the solution to the following equation:  \n\n$$\n\\int_{\\bar{X}(c)}^{\\infty}V(X;c)f(X)d X=P,\n$$  \n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.  \n\nwhere $\\bar{X}(c)$ is given by equation (12) and $V(X;c)$ is given by equation (11). Note that this equation is equivalent to Condition 3 of Definition 1. We have  \n\n$$\n\\int_{\\bar{X}(c)}^{\\infty}V(X;c)f(X)d X=\\left(\\frac{\\xi-1}{\\hat{F}\\xi}\\right)^{-\\rho}\\left(\\frac{\\eta}{(r+\\lambda)(\\rho-1)(\\eta+\\rho)}\\right)c^{-(\\rho-1)}.\n$$  \n\nNote that our assumption on the Pareto form $f(X)$ facilitates the computation of the integral shown above because both $V(X;c)$ and $f(X)$ are power functions. This integral represents the expected value of the firm to the shareholder after paying the fixed cost but before realizing the initial productivity of the firm. Because $\\rho>1$ , it is monotonically increasing in $c$ , and we can solve to obtain the expression for equilibrium compensation given in (13).  \n\n### C.2. Derivation of Stationary Distribution  \n\nThe ODE for $\\phi(x)$ has the following general solution:  \n\n$$\n\\phi(x)=A_{1}e^{\\gamma_{1}x}+A_{2}e^{-\\gamma_{2}x}+A_{3}e^{-\\rho x},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\gamma_{1}$ and $\\gamma_{2}$ are given by  \n\n$$\n\\gamma_{1}=\\frac{\\mu-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}+\\sqrt{(\\mu-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2})^{2}+2\\sigma^{2}\\lambda}}{\\sigma^{2}}\n$$  \n\nFirst note that $\\gamma_{1}>0$ implies that $A_{1}=0$ . To ease notation, we drop the subscript on $\\gamma_{2}$ . Next, note that an application of the ODE gives  \n\n$$\nA_{3}=-\\frac{\\rho\\psi}{\\frac{1}{2}\\rho^{2}\\sigma^{2}+\\rho(\\mu-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2})-\\lambda}.\n$$  \n\nFinally, the boundary condition implies that  \n\n$$\nA_{2}e^{-\\gamma\\bar{x}}+A_{3}e^{-\\rho\\bar{x}}=0,\n$$  \n\n$$\nA_{2}=-A_{3}e^{(\\gamma-\\rho)\\bar{x}}.\n$$  \n\nThe result in equation (17) directly follows from the solution above and from an application of the market-clearing condition for skilled workers.  \n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.  \n\n### C.3.Proofs  \n\nProof of Proposition 1. We have  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial\\Pi}{\\partial\\sigma}=-\\nu\\left(\\displaystyle\\frac{\\rho-1}{\\rho}\\right)\\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\sigma}\\left[\\left(\\displaystyle\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma}\\right)\\left(\\displaystyle\\frac{\\xi}{\\xi-1}\\right)\\right]}\\ &{\\quad\\quad\\quad=-\\nu\\left(\\displaystyle\\frac{\\rho-1}{\\rho}\\right)\\left[\\left(\\displaystyle\\frac{\\xi}{\\xi-1}\\right)\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\gamma^{2}}\\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial\\gamma}{\\partial\\sigma}-\\left(\\displaystyle\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma}\\right)\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{(\\xi-1)^{2}}\\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial\\xi}{\\partial\\sigma}\\right].}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nNow observe that  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\xi(\\xi-1)\\frac{\\partial\\gamma}{\\partial\\sigma}}{\\gamma(\\gamma-1)\\frac{\\partial\\eta}{\\partial\\sigma}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{(\\mu-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2})^{2}+2(r+\\lambda)\\sigma^{2}}}{\\sqrt{(\\mu-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2})^{2}+2\\lambda\\sigma^{2}}}>1,\n$$  \n\nwhich leads to the desired result.  \n\nProof or Proposition 2. The first result follows immediately from equation (30). The second result follows from the proof of Proposition 1.  \n\n## Appendix D. Pay for Performance  \n\nIn this appendix, we allow for some exposure in the skilled worker's compensation to firm performance. This exposure could arise for a variety of reasons. For example, there could be a firm-level agency conflict between the skilled worker and investors, or the investor could be risk-averse. In either case, the optimal contract will call for the skilled worker to bear some exposure to firm performance, either for incentive purposes or to improve risk sharing. The precise form of the optimal contract will depend on the nature of the agency problem or the exact preferences of the skilled workers and investors.17 One possible concern thus far with our results may be that this exposure could mitigate the insurance nature of the relationship between firms' owners and their skilled workers, thus decreasing or reversing the effect of firm-level volatility on the capital share of profits. To ease notation, we assume that $\\nu=1$ . Rather than solve directly for an optimal contract for a particular problem, we assume that the skilled worker's contract takes the following simple affine form:  \n\n$$\nc_{t}=\\beta X_{t}+w.\n$$  \n\nThesensitivity $\\beta$ of the skilled worker's payment $c_{t}$ to the level of productivity is determined by either the severity of the agency problem or the nature of the risk-sharing problem, and it is exogenous from the standpoint of our model. The fixed wage $w$ is set in equilibrium in the same manner as total  \n\nwages are set above. This contract has the advantage of being particularly tractable to analysis in the context of our model of equilibrium.  \n\nFor a given fixed wage $w$ , the investor's problem is  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{max}_{\\tau}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\tau}e^{-r t}((1-\\beta)X_{t}-w)d t\\right].\n$$  \n\nAgain, standard arguments imply that the investor's value function $V(X)$ must satisfy the ordinary differential equation  \n\n$$\n(r+\\lambda)V=(1-\\beta)X-w+\\mu X V^{\\prime}+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}X^{2}V^{\\prime\\prime},\n$$  \n\nwith boundary conditions  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}&{}&{V(\\bar{X})=0,}\\ &{}&{V^{\\prime}(\\bar{X})=0,}\\ &{}&{\\underset{X\\to\\infty}{\\mathrm{lim}}\\left|V(X)-\\left(\\frac{(1-\\beta)X}{r+\\lambda-\\mu}-\\frac{w}{r+\\lambda}\\right)\\right|=0.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThis problem is essentially the same as the problem given in equations (7) to (10), up to a scaling of the leading term by a factor of $(1-\\beta)$ . Thus, the solution to equations (D.3) to (D.6) is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{\\displaystyle\\bar{X}=\\left(\\frac{1}{1-\\beta}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\eta}{\\eta+1}\\right)\\frac{w(r+\\lambda-\\mu)}{r+\\lambda}}\\ {\\displaystyle V(X)=\\frac{(1-\\beta)X}{r+\\lambda-\\mu}-\\frac{w}{r+\\lambda}-\\left(\\frac{(1-\\beta)\\bar{X}}{r+\\lambda-\\mu}-\\frac{w}{r+\\lambda}\\right)\\left(\\frac{X}{\\bar{X}}\\right)^{-\\eta},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\eta$ is defined as above.  \n\nGiven the solution for the investor's value, we can apply the investor's zero ex-ante profit condition to determine the fixed component of the skilled worker's equilibrium contract. This calculation yields  \n\n$$\nw^{\\ast}=\\left(\\frac{P(r+\\lambda)(\\rho-1)(\\rho-\\eta)}{\\eta}\\left(\\frac{\\eta(r+\\lambda-\\mu)}{(1-\\beta)(\\eta+1)(r+\\lambda)}\\right)^{\\rho}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{\\rho-1}}.\n$$  \n\nComparing equations (13) and (D.7) reveals that the fixed component of the equilibrium affine contract is just the equilibrium wage under full insurance scaled by a function of $\\beta$ .Thus, the investor's problem under the affine contract is identical to the problem under full insurance when the firm's productivity is scaled by a factor of $1-\\beta$ . The stationary distribution of firm productivity is unaffected by our assumption of affine contracts up to a shifting of the optimal abandonment threshold (i.e., the left support of the stationary distribution). Thus, we can again calculate the total capital share of profits in the stationary distribution to obtain  \n\n$$\n\\Pi=(1-\\beta)\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{r+\\lambda}{r+\\lambda-\\mu}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\rho-1}{\\rho}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\eta+1}{\\eta}\\right)\\right).\n$$  \n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.  \n\nComparing equations (30) and (D.8) shows that the total capital share of profits under the affine contractdependon $\\gamma$ and $\\eta$ ,and hence also on $\\sigma$ in the same manner as the total capital share of profits under full insurance. In other words, allowing skilled workers to share in the success of successful firms does not change our main qualitative results.  \n\nWhile allowing skilled workers to share in some of the gains of successful firms does not change the aggregate dynamics of the capital share, it does have important implications for the distribution of the labor share across income levels. Income inequality has been rising, as observed by Piketty and Saez (2003) and Guvenen and Kuruscu (2010). Therefore, the share of output that accrues to the top decile of the income distribution could have increased. That is, the income shares could have become more unequal. Our model is consistent with rising income share inequality when we allow skilled workers to share in the gains of successful firms via the affine contracts that we consider in this section. In this case, the distribution of skilled worker pay essentially inherits the properties of the distribution of firm productivity (or size). As volatility increases, the most successful firms account for a larger share of total output, and because the managers of these firms receive pay in proportion to productivity, their pay is also a larger fraction of total output.  \n\n## Appendix E. Valuation Ratio  \n\nIn this appendix, we solve for the aggregate valuation ratio of our production economy. Given the homogeneity of $F$ , the price of capital is given by solving the first-order condition for the firm's problem and is given by  \n\n$$\n\\kappa=(1-\\nu)\\left(\\frac{{\\cal F}_{1}(k,l)}{{\\cal F}(k,l)}\\right)y,\n$$  \n\nwhere $F_{1}$ denotes the partial derivative of $F$ with respect to its first argument. Because $F,k$ and $\\boldsymbol{l}$ do not depend on any of the parameters with which we want to take a comparative static, we can let  \n\n$$\n\\alpha=\\left({\\frac{F_{1}(k,l)}{F(k,l)}}\\right)k,\n$$  \n\nwhich implies that the aggregate rental payment to physical capital is  \n\n$$\n\\kappa k=(1-\\nu)\\alpha y.\n$$  \n\nIntuitively, this is basically the capital expenditure share of output obtained from a model with a homogeneous production function. To obtain the book value of physical capital, we can capitalize this number to get  \n\n$$\n{\\mathrm{Book~value~of~physical~capital}}={\\frac{\\kappa k}{r}}={\\frac{(1-\\nu)\\alpha y}{r}}.\n$$  \n\nGiven the equilibrium $\\hat{F},c^{*}$ , and $\\bar{X}$ and the firm value $V(X,;c,{\\hat{F}})$ from equation (7), the ratio of  \n\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.  \n\nthe aggregate of market value of rents is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle\\hat{V}=\\int_{\\bar{x}}^{\\infty}V(X;c^{*},\\hat{F})\\phi(x)d x}\\ {=\\displaystyle\\frac{\\hat{F}\\hat{X}}{r+\\lambda-\\mu}-\\frac{c^{*}}{r+\\lambda}-\\left(\\frac{\\hat{F}\\bar{X}^{1+\\eta}}{r+\\lambda-\\mu}-\\frac{c^{*}\\bar{X}^{\\eta}}{r+\\lambda}\\right)\\int_{\\bar{x}}e^{-\\eta x}\\phi(x)d x}\\ {=\\displaystyle\\frac{\\nu y}{r+\\lambda-\\mu}-\\frac{c^{*}}{r+\\lambda}-\\left(\\frac{\\hat{F}\\bar{X}^{1+\\eta}}{r+\\lambda-\\mu}-\\frac{c^{*}\\bar{X}^{\\eta}}{r+\\lambda}\\right)\\int_{\\bar{x}}e^{-\\eta x}\\phi(x)d x.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe ratio of the aggregate value of firms (cumulative of the aggregate value of physical capital) to the book value of physical capital is then  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{\\mathrm{Market}}{\\mathrm{Book}}}=1+{\\frac{r{\\hat{V}}}{(1-\\nu)\\alpha y}}.\n$$  \n\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Changes in population growth provide a unified quantitative explanation. A decrease in population growth lowers firm entry rates, shifting the firm-age distribution toward older firms. Firm aging accounts for (i) the concentration of employment in large firms, (i) and trends in average firm size and exit rates, key determinants of firm entry rates. Feedback effects from firm demographics generate two-thirds of the effect. Prior to the decrease, entry rates rose steadily refecting the earlier baby boom. The glut of firms due to the baby boom lead to rich transitional dynamics within the feedback effects, accounting for more than half the total change. Baby boom induced changes in the firm-age distribution provide a driving force for the post-WwII rise and fall in the aggregate labor share. Ignoring changes in population growth attributes all the long run decline in entry rates to a decrease in firm exit rates, which in reality have been only one-third as large.  \n\nKEYWORDs: Firm aging, baby boom, transitional dynamics, entrepreneurship, concentration, labor share.  \n\n## 1. INTRODUCTION  \n\nTHREE LONG-TERM CHANGES in the U.S. economy have attracted a great deal of attention. First, economic activity is increasingly being concentrated in larger firms. Second, the rate of firm creation has steadily declined. Third, the share of GDP going to labor, once thought to be stable, has declined. What are the economic forces driving these longterm changes? This paper looks at the role of population growth and firm demographics.  \n\nOur analysis begins by highlighting the importance of changing firm demographics in driving these aggregate trends. The mass of U.S. firms has been aging. Had it not been for firm aging, employment concentration would have, if anything, declined. Concentration has increased because an aging firm distribution shifts weights toward older firms, which have higher levels of concentration. We document that changing firm demographics can also account for two related changes: the increase in average firm size and the decline in the aggregate firm exit rate. The patterns exhibited by these variables are similar to concentration. In the absence of firm aging, the change in these variables, if anything, would have gone in the opposite direction.  \n\n![](images/e5d729b37dea268a48b61c804c8d6eb0c60d9c7aa3f02bffa09b9ebe24bb4230.jpg)  \nFIGURE 1.-Civilian labor force growth rate.  \n\nBecause firm exit rates by age have changed little, the probability that a new firm survives to a particular age has also changed little. Therefore, the aging of firms is a result of the dramatic fall in the rate at which new firms are created. This decline in the rate of firm entry can be analyzed through the lens of a simple accounting identity,1  \n\nentry rate $=$ labor force growth - growth in average size $+$ exit rate.  \n\nStandard models of firm dynamics have the property that for a constant growth rate of the labor force, the change in the other two components of this identity converge to zero. Therefore, changes in labor force growth are a natural candidate to explain changes in the firm entry rate. Holding the exit rate and average firm size constant, can a change in labor force growth explain the observed drop in firm entry rates? The answer is no. Figure 1 shows U.S. civilian labor force growth rates by decade. The rise and fall of labor force growth mostly refects the earlier baby boom. Since the 1970s, labor force growth has declined by 2 percentage points (pp), which is only one-third of the 6pp decline in the entry rate. The remaining two-thirds is attributed to changes in the exit rate and changes in the growth rate of average firm size.  \n\nWe show that changes in labor force growth feed back to changes in both the aggregate exit rate and average firm size. Consider an increase in labor force growth. The increase in labor supply must be met by a corresponding increase in labor demand. Incumbent firms are limited by scale, so they cannot absorb the entire increase in labor supply. The residual labor demand must therefore be absorbed by entry of new firms. The increase in firm entry shifts the firm-age distribution toward younger firms, which have higher exit rates and lower size.  \n\nTo be consistent with the data, the changes in labor force growth should change aggregate variables while maintaining relative stability of exit rates by firm age. While this property holds along a steady state, it is not clear that it carries over to transitions. This distinction is of interest because the growth in average firm size in the data is nonzero, indicating that the U.S. economy is going through a transition. The theoretical challenge is to determine whether the transition path is consistent with these empirical patterns. We derive necessary and suffcient conditions for the existence of such a path in a general equilibrium framework that incorporates standard models of perfect competition and models of imperfect competition featuring both constant and variable markups.  \n\nThe transitional dynamics of firm entry depend on the entire history of past entry. Firm entry fills the gap between labor supply and incumbent labor demand. Therefore, entry depends on total labor demand by incumbents in each age group, which in turn is determined by past entry, and age profiles of exit and average size. We characterize this history dependence with a dynamic entry equation, which relates current entry to the distributed lag of past entries. The dynamic nature of entry implies that changes in current entry affect future entry, through the firm-age distribution.  \n\nCan changes in labor force growth, combined with feedback from firm demographics, quantitatively generate the secular changes experienced by the U.s. economy? What is the role of the feedback effect? What is the role of transitional dynamics and, therefore, the importance of the baby boom? How do we expect entry rates and firm demographics to evolve from here on? We can answer these questions using the dynamic entry equation. To obtain labor demand by incumbents in each age group, we estimate a stochastic process for firm employment that is consistent with key facts about firm size, firm growth, and exit. We then feed the labor force series into the dynamic entry equation and iterate forward. We make use of historical labor force data which goes back to 1940. Doing so allows us to obtain the 1978 age distribution that is consistent with the baby boom.  \n\nGoing back to the entry rate equation above, changes in labor force growth have a direct effect on entry, but also an indirect effect as they can impact average firm size and exit rates. This occurs mainly through a change in the age distribution of firms, as older firms are larger and have lower exit rates. We find that, taking into account the changes in the age distribution of firms, the decline in labor force growth explains the majority of the observed decline in firm entry rates from 1978 to 2014.  \n\nThe entry rate decline can be further decomposed into long-run and transitional effects. The long-run effect corresponds to the difference in entry rates across steady states with different population growth rates. It follows from identity (1) that, in addition to the direct effect of population growth, the long-run effect depends on how changes in population growth affect the exit rate. We find that the long-run elasticity of entry rates to population growth is in the order of 1.5 for the U.S. economy. This implies that the 2pp drop in labor force growth generates roughly a 3pp drop in entry rates. The long-run effect corresponds to $45\\%$ of the 6pp decline in the entry rate.  \n\nThe long-run effect implicitly assumes a history of constant labor force growth prior to its decrease, so the resulting firm-age distributions do not capture the glut of firms born due to the baby boom. The baby boom shows up in the transitional effects in two ways, captured by the exit rate and growth in average size terms in identity (1). The transitional firm-age distribution is younger than the long-run distribution in 1978 immediately after the rise in labor force growth, and older than the long-run distribution in 2014 once the glut of firms have aged. These changes together lead to a 1pp effect from exit along the transition. Additionally, entry rates are not only high but rising in 1978, fueled by the incorporation of baby-boomers into the labor force. As a consequence, average firm size is falling during that period, which feeds back to even higher entry rates. The opposite trend occurs in 2014 as the glut of the firms created during the entry boom are aging, implying positive average size growth. These transitional changes in average firm size contribute about 2pp to the change in entry rates, which together with the transitional effect on exit rates explain $55\\%$ of the total decline in entry rates.  \n\nWe next turn to the labor share. A recent set of papers document two facts about labor shares: (i) firm-level labor shares are negatively related to firm size and (i) almost all of the decline in the aggregate labor share is due to reallocation from high to low labor share units, rather than a decline within labor share units.2 Firm aging induced by the slowdown in population growth provides a driving force that is consistent with these empirical findings. By shifting the the firm-age distribution toward older firms, declining labor force growth reallocates the share of value added toward larger firms, which have lower labor shares. Furthermore, the time-series pattern of the aggregate labor share implied by labor force growth is consistent with the evidence in Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) and Koh, Santaeulalia-Llopis, and Zheng (2020).  \n\nDeclining population growth also has implications for job reallocation. As noted by Decker, Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda (2014), older firms create, destroy, and reallocate jobs at lower rates.3 Therefore, firm aging also acts as a force that contributes to declining aggregate job reallocation rates. We find that, for the 1978 to 2014 period, firm aging induced by population growth accounts for $48\\%$ of the observed decline in job creation, $38\\%$ of the decline in job destruction, and $32\\%$ of the decline in job reallocation.  \n\nOur paper finds that changes in the age distribution of firms resulting from labor force dynamics have played a major role in accounting for the observed trends in exit rates, average firm size, and concentration. The literature has considered other alternative hypotheses to explain the observed trends, such as an increase in economies of scale, higher entry costs, and lower rates of diffusion. We evaluate, in the context of our model, some of the implications of these alternative forces. Our findings suggest that while these alternative explanations can contribute to explain some of the documented facts, they are not consistent with others. As an example, an increase in entry cost contributes to explain a decline in entry rates but, contrary to our documented evidence, leads to an increase in average firm size and decline in exit rates, conditional on age. As a general implication, and going back to our accounting identity, any alternative explanation that abstracts from the role of changes in population growth must end up attributing all the long run decline in entry rates to a decrease in firm exit rates of the same magnitude. In reality, however, the decrease in exit rates has only been one-third as large as the decline in entry rates.  \n\nRelated Literature.  Our paper builds on a wealth of recent empirical evidence from seemingly disconnected strands of the literature. One strand of the literature has documented changes in entry rates and the age distribution of firms. The decline in U.S.  \n\nfirm entry rates was first documented by Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda (2011), while Decker et al. (2014), Hathaway and Litan (2014b), Davis and Haltiwanger (2014), Gourio, Messer, and Siemer (2014), and Pugsley and Sahin (2018) document the pervasiveness of this decline across geographic areas and industries. Decker et al. (2014), Hathaway and Litan (2014a), and Pugsley and Sahin (2018) document the aging of the firm distribution and link it to declining firm entry.  \n\nA different strand of the literature has documented trends in the aggregate labor share and the rise in concentration. Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) find that the decline in the labor share is primarily a within-industry rather than a cross-industry phenomenon. Grullon, Larkin, and Michaely (2019) document increased concentration across most U.S. industries, whereas Barkai (2020) and Autor et al. (2020) both document a positive correlation between industry concentration and the decline in the labor share. Our paper shows that population growth and firm demographics play an important role in linking these empirical findings. We show that the changes observed in the age distribution of firms played a major role in explaining the rise in concentration.4 Given the widely documented negative relationship between firm size and labor share (Hartman-Glaser, Lustig, and Xiaolan (2019), Autor et al. (2020), Kehrig and Vincent (2021)), firm aging induced by population growth also lowers the aggregate labor share by reallocating the share of value added toward larger firms which have lower labor shares. A related observation that has gained considerable attention is that of the rise in markups (De Loecker, Eeckhout, and Unger (2020)). Our framework is consistent with rising markups provided older firms have higher markups.5  \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, ours is the first paper that jointly explains the transitional dynamics of entrepreneurship, concentration, and the labor share. We are not the first paper to propose the decline in labor force growth as an explanation for the decline in firm entry rates. Karahan, Pugsley, and Sahin (2018) provide empirical evidence of a causal relationship between changes in population growth and the entry rate across U.S. states.6 The authors then explore the role of labor force growth as a driver for the fall in the entry rate in the steady state of a Hopenhayn (1992a)-style model. Our paper builds on this idea. We identify the key equations that underlie the process by which population growth affects the entry rate through the age structure of firms. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which these equations apply to a large class models, including models of perfect and imperfect competition, and also hold along transitions. Quantitatively, transitional dynamics played a major role in explaining the magnitude of the decrease in entry rates.7  \n\nIn addition, our parsimonious framework allows us to track the impact of the changes in labor force growth on the age distribution of firms, which as we extensively document in the paper, played a critical role in explaining the fall in exit rates, rise in average firm size and concentration, and the fall in the aggregate labor share. Therefore, we provide a unified quantitative explanation for a set of trends that have been treated as separate in the literature. In particular, the trends in concentration and the aggregate labor share (also the related trend in markups) were treated as separate from business dynamism trends (entry, exit, average size, and job reallocation). Our paper shows not only that these trends are related, but that the driving force of population growth ties them together in a way that is consistent with microevidence.8  \n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the data. Section 3 presents the theoretical framework. Section 4 presents the quantitative findings. Section 5 discusses further implications of our framework, including the labor share, job reallocation, and alternative explanations. Section 6 concludes.  \n\n## 2. MOTIVATING FACTS  \n\nThis section documents the importance of changes in firm demographics in explaining the trends in the U.S. economy. The share of firms over 10 years of age has experienced a steady increase from around $32\\%$ in 1986 to $48\\%$ in 2014. We first discuss the importance of this channel in regard to aggregate trends and next extend the analysis to trends within sectors. Our main data source is the Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) produced by the U.S. Census Bureau.? The BDS has near universal coverage of private sector firms with paid employees. The BDS data covers years 1977 to 2014. We follow the common practice of dropping the first year of BDS data due to suspected measurement error (e.g., Moscarini and Postel-Vinay (2012)). Thus our sample covers the 1978 to 2014 period.  \n\nThe Role of Firm Aging in Aggregate Trends. Figure 2 shows the time series evolution of the aggregate exit rate, average firm size, and concentration in U.S. data. The aggregate exit rate in the U.s. has declined from about $9.5\\%$ to $7.5\\%$ . Average firm size has increased from about 20 employees to 24 employees. Aggregate concentration, measured as the share of employment in firms with 250 or more employees, has increased from $51.6\\%$ to $57.3\\%$ .10 The first specification in Table I reports the linear time trend for each aggregate variable. The aggregate trend is statistically significant for all three variables.  \n\n![](images/9a533588807964e3704869799f0b46a16ce2d56c8e3460d3cd38ef19448e9d7d.jpg)  \nFIGURE 2.—-Aggregate time series. Note: Average firm size is number of workers per firm. Concentration is the share of employment in firms with $^{250+}$ employees.  \n\nThe annual trends can be multiplied by 36 years to calculate the total change in each variable since 1978. In percentage terms, the exit rate has declined by $15\\%$ , average size has increasedby $17\\%$ , and concentration has increased by $11\\%$  \n\nThe U.s. economy has undergone massive reallocation of economic activity at the sectoral level, primarily refecting the reallocation from manufacturing to service sectors due to structural change. It could be the case that changing sectoral composition might be responsible for the observed aggregate trends. The second specification in Table I shows  \n\nTABLEI TIME TRENDS IN AVERAGE FIRM SIZE, EXIT RATES, AND CONCENTRATION.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td rowspan=\"2\">(5) Controlling for Age,Sector</td></tr><tr><td>Aggregate</td><td>Controlling for Sector</td><td>Controlling for Age</td><td>Controlling for Age and Sector and Interaction</td></tr><tr><td>EXITRATE:</td><td>-0.043</td><td>-0.036</td><td>0.011</td><td>0.006</td><td>0.006</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td>(0.008)</td><td>(0.004)</td><td>(0.007)</td><td>(0.004)</td><td>(0.003)</td></tr><tr><td>0.423</td><td>0.771</td><td>0.972</td><td>0.939</td><td>0.957</td></tr><tr><td>R2 Observations</td><td>37</td><td>333</td><td>270</td><td>2430</td><td>2430</td></tr><tr><td>AVERAGEFIRMSIZE:</td><td>0.096</td><td>0.128</td><td>-0.143</td><td>0.149</td><td>0.149</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">R2</td><td>(0.007)</td><td>(0.015)</td><td>(0.021)</td><td>(0.040)</td><td>(0.011)</td></tr><tr><td>0.838</td><td>0.95</td><td>0.99</td><td>0.783</td><td>0.985</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>37</td><td>333</td><td>307</td><td>2763</td><td>2763</td></tr><tr><td>CONCENTRATION:</td><td>0.159</td><td>0.172</td><td>-0.069</td><td>-0.127</td><td>-0.128</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.013)</td><td>(0.017)</td><td>(0.023)</td><td>(0.018)</td><td>(0.011)</td></tr><tr><td>R2</td><td>0.817</td><td>0.948</td><td>0.985</td><td>0.928</td><td>0.975</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>37</td><td>315</td><td>307</td><td>2561</td><td>2561</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNote:The table reports $\\beta_{1}$ from theregression equation $y_{t}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}y e a r+\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}+\\epsilon_{t}$ where the dependent variable is exit rate, average size, or concentration. Numbers in parentheses report standard errors. The unit of observation is a year-sector cell in specification (2), a year-age cell in specification (3), and a year-age-sector cell in specifications (4) and (5). Specification (2) is weighted by 1978 sectoral activity, which corresponds to firm weights for average size and exit rate regressions and to employment weights for the concentration regression. Specification (3) is weighted by 2014 age activity, which correspond to firm weights for all regressions. Specifications (4) and (5) are weighted by the product of sectoral and age activity weights. We use age weights from 2014 because the sample in that year contains data for all age groups. The age weights are also multiplied by the inverse of the number of observations in the age group to correct for the bias that results from some age groups having more observations than others.  \n\n![](images/d636ce3e4afa4636f49d202cf641600dc4f447436cefd84933e20be24e5b2d41.jpg)  \nFIGURE 3.—-Time series by firm age.  \n\nthat the aggregate trends are not being driven by changes in sectoral composition over the sample period. The inclusion of sector controls in fact deepens the puzzle: it increases the magnitude of the trend for average size and concentration.11 This result reflects the fact that the U.s. service sectors are less concentrated and have smaller firms than the manufacturing sectors. A strong negative trend persists for the exit rate after the inclusion of sectorcontrols.  \n\nThe picture looks very different once we look at the data conditional on firm age. The third column of Table I shows that the inclusion of firm-age controls flips the sign of the trend for all three variables. Exit rate now has a slight positive trend, while average size and concentration have a negative trend. This finding is robust to the inclusion of further controls for sector (specification 4) and interaction between age and sector (specification 5).12  \n\nFigure 3 shows data on exit rates, average size, and concentration conditional on firm age. The data exhibit two key features. First, firm-age bins do not reflect the aggregate trend for all three variables. This is the reason why the trends in Table I flip sign with the inclusion of age controls. The negative trend conditional on age for average size and concentration is mostly coming from a trend among older age groups. Young age groups exhibit either a mild trend or no trend.13 The second feature is that there are clear age profiles for each variable. Firm exit rates decrease with age. Average size and concentration increase with age. Taken together with results in Table I, these features of the data imply that a shift in the firm-age distribution toward older firms——firm aging—is a force that plays a major role in driving aggregate trends.  \n\nGiven that exit rates by firm age have changed little, firm aging must be the result of a decline in firm entry. Figure 4 shows that the firm entry rate in the U.S. has declined since 1978. We extend the entry rate series further back in time. The entry rate from 1940 to 1962 comes from the now discontinued Survey of Current Business. The entry rate from  \n\n![](images/52bae3f57daef3a9130a240757e58dd634a2a80ceaa8439325ed4d3d51f9bcd9.jpg)  \nFIGURE 4.—Firm entry rate. Note: The entry rate from 1963 to 1977 is linearly interpolated.  \n\n1963 to 1977 is linearly interpolated.14 After a transitory spike in entry rates during World War II, entry rates steadily increased up to the 1970s and then exhibited a steady decline.  \n\nFirm Aging Within Sectors. While the aggregate trends are not necessarily refected within every sector, this section documents that the force of firm aging plays a role in each of the seven major sectors reported in BDS data.15 Panel A of Table I reports that the aggregate patterns of declining entry and the subsequent increase in firm aging are present at the sectoral level. As in aggregate data, the entry rate in each sector has a statistically significant negative trend. The aggregate entry rate declined on average by 0.16pp per year, while the sectoral declines range from 0.11pp to 0.38pp. The share of firms over 10 years of age in each sector has a statistically significant positive trend. The share of firms over 10 years of age increased on average by 0.57pp per year in the aggregate, while the sectoral increases range from 0.41pp to 1.46pp.  \n\nPanel B of Table II summarizes how aging at the sector level affects exit rates, average size, and concentration. We measure the contribution of aging as the percentage change in a variable, relative to 1978, if aging was the only force. It is calculated as  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Change~if~Aging~Only}=\\frac{(\\mathrm{Uncond.~Trend-Trend~Cond.~on~Age})\\times36}{L e v e l_{1978}}.\n$$  \n\nThis statistic indicates the total change in a variable net of the changes within age groups. As an example, consider the contribution of aging to the change in average firm size in the aggregate economy. As reported in Table I earlier, the unconditional trend in average size is positive (column 1), while the trend conditional on age is negative (column 3). In the absence of firm aging, average size in the economy would have declined. However, because average size actually increased, firm aging more than undoes the decline within age bins. As a result, the Change if Aging Only statistic, $43\\%$ , is greater than the total change in average size in the data, $17\\%$  \n\nTABLEII ENTRY AND FIRM AGING BY SECTOR.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"8\">A.TimeTrends</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Agg.</td><td>Cons.</td><td>FIRE</td><td>Man.</td><td>Ret.</td><td>Serv.</td><td>Trans.</td><td>Who.</td></tr><tr><td>Entry Rate</td><td>-0.155 (0.011)</td><td>-0.378 (0.030)</td><td>-0.110 (0.018)</td><td>-0.200 (0.008)</td><td>-0.139 (0.015)</td><td>-0.134 (0.013)</td><td>-0.157 (0.017)</td><td>-0.170 (0.008)</td></tr><tr><td>Share of 11+ Firms</td><td>0.571 (0.020)</td><td>1.463 (0.096)</td><td>0.377 (0.044)</td><td>0.919 (0.018)</td><td>0.414 (0.022)</td><td>0.473 (0.035)</td><td>0.579 (0.033)</td><td>0.807 (0.014)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"8\">B.

Panel B shows the percentage change in the corresponding variable, relative to its 1978 level, if aging is the Oonlyforce.  \n\nThe aggregate patterns of changes in exit rate, average size, and concentration driven by firm aging can be seen in all the major sectors. While there is heterogeneity in magnitudes across sectors, firm aging is a force that is consistently present and quantitatively important at the sectoral level. If aging was the only force the exit rate in the aggregate would have declined by $18\\%$ , while the sectoral declines range from $7\\%$ to $36\\%$ . Aging alone would have generated an increase in average size of $43\\%$ and in concentration of $16\\%$ in the aggregate. The corresponding sectoral increases range from $18\\%$ to $100\\%$ for average size, and $9\\%$ to $56\\%$ for concentration.  \n\nHaving established that firm aging has been a major force in recent decades, we next present a framework that helps organize and interpret the empirical evidence.  \n\n## 3. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK  \n\nThis section presents a tractable theoretical framework that isolates the effects of population growth on firm aging. The framework captures in a transparent way the feedback effects of population growth and permits comparisons of the effects along steady states and transitions. We first provide the basic structure that is common to a class of models, and then give some specific examples. For clarity of exposition, we keep the basic structure as simple as possible. The class of models presented here share the property that equilibrium allocations, when conditioned on firm age, are invariant to nonstationary changes in population.  \n\nThere is a fixed endowment of a labor $N_{t}$ , which is inelastically supplied and also the numeraire. Firms are confronted with an aggregate state $z$ (e.g., price index) and an idiosyncratic state $s$ The aggregate state $z$ is determined as part of the equilibrium. The idiosyncratic state $s$ follows a Markov process with conditional distribution $F(s_{t+1}|s_{t})$ , which we assume is continuous and nondecreasing. Let $\\pi(s,z)$ denote the profits of a firm with idiosyncratic state $s$ when the aggregate state is $z$ with $n(s,z)$ denoting employment. We assume both functions are increasing in $s$ and $z$ . Firms have a common discount factor $\\beta$  \n\nNote that, for fixed $z$ , the Markov process for a firm's state $s_{i t}$ and the function $n(s,z)$ determine the evolution of firm employment. In turn, this Markov process and the profit function $\\pi(s,z)$ play a key role in determining the properties of firm survival, as explained below.16  \n\nThe technology for entry of a new firm is as follows. Upon paying a cost of entry of $c_{e}$ units of labor, entrants draw their initial productivity from a fixed distribution $G$ .The productivity draws are independent across entrants and time. This assumption implies that potential entrants are ex ante identical and get differentiated ex post as a result of their initial draws and the stochastic evolution. While admittedly extreme, it captures in a stylized way the large amount of uncertainty faced by potential entrants. As discussed below, this assumption implies a perfectly elastic supply of potential entrants and will play a key role in our analysis. Later on, in Section 5, we consider the potential role of ex ante heterogeneity.  \n\n### 3.1. Examples  \n\nOur formulation is general and can encompass models of perfect and imperfect competition. We provide three examples below. For each example, we map the aggregate state $z$ ,profit function $\\pi(s,z)$ , and employment function $n(s,z)$ to model fundamentals.  \n\nPerfect Competition.  Firms produce a homogeneous good with labor input $n$ and production technology $q(s,n)$ , where $s$ can be interpreted as a productivity shock. Assume $q$ is increasing in $s$ , supermodular and strictly concave. In addition, there is a fixed cost of production $c_{f}$ , which captures labor overhead. The model is the standard entry and exit model considered in the literature based on Hopenhayn (1992a). Let $z$ be the price of the output good in units of labor, the numeraire. Profits are given by  \n\n$$\n\\pi(s,z)=\\operatorname*{max}_{n}z q(s,n)-n-c_{f}\n$$  \n\nand employment $n(s,z)$ is the unique maximizer. Given the above assumptions it follows immediately that both $\\pi(s,z)$ and $n(s,z)$ are increasing in $s$ and $z$  \n\nMonopolistic Competition With Constant Markups. Each firm $i$ produces a differentiated good with a linear production function, $q(i)=s(i)n(i)$ a fixed cost $c_{f}$ in units of labor, and faces a CES demand, as in Melitz (2003). In particular, the representative consumer has preferences over intermediate goods given by the aggregator  \n\n$$\nU=\\left(\\int c(i)^{\\eta}d i\\right)^{1/\\eta}\n$$  \n\nwhere $0<\\eta<1$ ,and $c(i)$ denotes per capita consumption of firm i's output. First-order conditions for the choice of $c(i)$ are given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{U^{1-\\eta}c(i)^{\\eta-1}=\\theta p(i),}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\theta$ is the multiplier of the budget constraint of the consumer and $p(i)$ is the price of good $i$ 17 Revenues per consumer are given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{p(i)c(i)=U^{1-\\eta}\\theta^{-1}c(i)^{\\eta}}\\ {~=U^{1-\\eta}\\theta^{-1}\\big(s(i)n(i)/N\\big)^{\\eta}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nGiven a population of consumers $N$ , and letting $z\\equiv N U\\theta^{-\\frac{1}{1-\\eta}}$ , total firm revenues are $z^{1-\\eta}(s n)^{\\eta}$ . Profits are given by  \n\n$$\n\\pi(s,z)=\\operatorname*{max}_{n}z^{1-\\eta}(s n)^{\\eta}-n-c_{f}\n$$  \n\nand employment $n(s,z)$ is the unique maximizer. It follows immediately that both $\\pi(s,z)$ and $n(s,z)$ are increasing in $s$ and $z$  \n\nMonopolistic Competition With Variable Markups. There is a continuum of firms each producing a different variety of a final good with quality $s(i)$ . Preferences of the representative consumer are given by the CES aggregator:  \n\n$$\nU=\\left(\\int s(i)c(i)^{\\eta}d i\\right)^{1/\\eta},\n$$  \n\nwhere $0<\\eta<1$ parameterizes the elasticity of substitution between varieties and $c(i)$ denotes consumption per capita of good $i.$ Firms produce with linear technology $q(i)=$ $n(i)$ . Suppose the marginal cost of producing an existing product by a firm of quality $s$ is one. An outside imitator can make this product at marginal cost $1<p(s)<1/\\eta$ , as in the literature based on Grossman and Helpman (1991). All costs are expressed in units of labor. As a consequence of limit pricing, the price of a good of quality $s$ will be equal to $p(s)$ . If $p(s)$ is an increasing function, markups will increase in $s$ . Order the preferences of the representative consumer by product quality and let $\\psi(s)$ denote the measure of firm qualities. We have  \n\n$$\nU=\\left(\\int s c(s)^{\\eta}d\\psi(s)\\right)^{1/\\eta}.\n$$  \n\nThis gives individual demand functions of the form  \n\n$$\nc(s)=U\\theta^{-\\frac{1}{1-\\eta}}\\left(s/p(s)\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1-\\eta}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\theta$ is the multiplier of the budget constraint of the consumer.  \n\nProfits of a firm of quality $s$ are  \n\n$$\n\\pi(s,z)=z\\big(s/p(s)\\big)^{\\frac{1}{1-\\eta}}\\big(p(s)-1\\big)-c_{f},\n$$  \n\nwhere $z=N U\\theta^{-{\\frac{1}{1-\\eta}}}$ and $c_{f}$ is overhead labor. Likewise, total output and employment $n(s,z)$ of firm of quality $s$ equals $N c(s)$ sO  \n\n$$\nn(s,z)=z\\big(s/p(s)\\big)^{\\frac{1}{1-\\eta}}.\n$$  \n\nAssuming $s/p(s)$ is increasing in $s$ , it follows immediately that both $\\pi(s,z)$ and $n(s,z)$ are increasing in $s$ and $z$ . Note also that with these assumptions, higher quality firms are larger, that is, employ more workers, and have higher markups.  \n\n### 3.2. Equilibrium  \n\nGiven a deterministic path for the aggregate state ${\\bf z}_{t}=\\{{z_{\\tau}}\\}_{\\tau\\geq t}$ , the present discounted value of a firm is given by the Bellman equation:  \n\n$$\nv(s,\\mathbf{z}_{t})=\\operatorname*{max}\\bigl\\{0,\\pi(s,z_{t})+\\beta E v(s^{\\prime},\\mathbf{z}_{t+1}|s)\\bigr\\}.\n$$  \n\nThe value of exit is normalized to zero, while the right-hand side under the maximization is the continuation value for the firm. It is easy to show that, when nonzero, the continuation value is increasing in $s$ and $\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}$ .Let  \n\n$$\ns_{t}^{\\ast}=\\operatorname*{inf}\\{s|\\pi(s,z_{t})+\\beta E v(s^{\\prime},\\mathbf{z}_{t+1}|s)>0\\}.\n$$  \n\nA firm is shut down iff $s\\leq s_{t}^{*}$ .18  \n\nPrior to entry, the expected value of an entrant net of the entry cost is  \n\n$$\nv^{e}(\\mathbf{z}_{t})=\\int v(s,\\mathbf{z}_{t})d G(s)-c_{e}.\n$$  \n\nLet $\\psi_{t}$ denote the measure of firms operating at time $t$ , where for a set $A$ of idiosyncratic states, $\\psi_{t}(A)$ measures the magnitude of firms that have $s_{i t}\\in A$ . Given an initial measure $\\psi_{0}$ , the exit thresholds $\\boldsymbol{S}_{t}^{*}$ together with mass of entrants $m_{t}$ uniquely determine the sequence of measures $\\{\\psi_{t}\\}$ recursively as follows. Define  \n\n$$\n\\psi_{t+1}(A)=m_{t+1}\\biggl(\\int_{s\\in A,s\\geq s_{t+1}^{*}}d G(s)\\biggr)+\\int\\int_{s\\in A,s\\geq s_{t+1}^{*}}d F(s|x)d\\psi_{t}(x).\n$$  \n\nThe first term on the right-hand side corresponds to entrants, excluding those that exit immediately, while the second term corresponds to incumbents after the realization of new productivities, excluding those that exit.  \n\nLet $\\begin{array}{r}{M_{t}\\equiv\\int d\\psi_{t}(s)}\\end{array}$ denote the total mass of firms. The resource constraint requires that  \n\n$$\n\\int n(s,z_{t})d\\psi_{t}(s)+\\int c_{f}d\\psi_{t}(s)+m_{t}c_{e}=N_{t}.\n$$  \n\nThe first term is productive labor demand, the second is overhead labor, and the third is labor utilized for creation of entrants. The right-hand side represents total labor, which is inelastically supplied.  \n\nAn equilibrium, given a sequence $\\{N_{t}\\}$ and an initial measure $\\psi_{0}$ , consists of shutdown threshoids $\\{\\boldsymbol{S}_{t}^{*}\\}$ , mass of entrants $\\{m_{t}\\}$ , measures of firms $\\{\\psi_{t}\\}$ and aggregate states ${\\bf z}_{t}=$ $\\left\\{{z}_{t}\\right\\}$ such that:  \n\n(i) Entry: No rents for entrants, $v^{e}(\\mathbf{z}_{t})\\leq0$ and $v^{e}(\\mathbf{z}_{t})m_{t}=0$  \n\n(ii) Exit: Shutdown thresholds are given by equation (3);   \n(ii) Law of motion: The sequence $\\psi_{t}$ is generated recursively by equation (4), given the initial measure $\\psi_{0}$   \n(iv) Resource constraint (5) holds.  \n\nWe focus on equilibria with strictly positive entry, which is the relevant case in reality. Whenlabor $N_{t}$ grows at a constant rate, there is a unique level of the aggregate state for all periods, denoted $z^{*}$ , that satisfies the zero net value condition for entrants. The unique allocation that supports this value $z^{*}$ as an equilibrium can be constructed along the lines of the stationary equilibrium in Hopenhayn (1992a). Here, we generalize this result and construct the allocation for the case when labor is growing at nonconstant rates, as would be the case along a transition path.19 The intuition behind the equilibrium construction is as follows. Given the value $z^{*}$ , there is a perfectly elastic supply of potential entrants. Adjustments along the extensive margin of entry guarantee that the market clearing condition (5) holds in every period, provided that the implied number of entrants is never negative.20 The next section provides necessary and sufficient conditions for strictly positive entry in every period that are needed to develop the existence argument. Readers who want to skip the details can jump to Section 3.2.2, which discusses the key equilibrium properties used in our quantitative analysis.  \n\n#### 3.2.1. Existence of Equilibrium  \n\nFor existence, we need to show that the four equilibrium conditions hold in every period. Let $z^{*}$ be such that the entry condition holds every period, $v^{e}(z^{*})=0$ . Let $s^{*}$ be the corresponding shutdown threshold, so that the exit condition holds every period. Given $\\psi_{0}$ , construct the sequence $\\psi_{t}$ recursively such that the law of motion holds.  \n\nIt remains to verify that the resource constraint holds. We begin by constructing survival probabilities by age. Let $S_{a}$ denote the probability that an entrant survives at least $a$ periods, that is, that the state $s_{i\\tau}\\geq s^{*}$ for ages $\\tau$ from 0 to $a$ . Let $\\tilde{\\psi}_{a}$ denote the crosssectional probability distribution of productivities for firms in the cohort of age $a$ .These can be obtained recursively as follows:  \n\n1. Let $S_{0}=(1-G(s^{\\ast}))$ . Let $\\tilde{\\psi}_{0}(d s)=G(d s)/S_{0}$ denote the distribution of entrant productivity draws conditional on $s\\geq s^{*}$  \n\n2. Let $\\begin{array}{r}{S_{a}=S_{a-1}\\int P(s_{a}\\geq s^{*}|s_{a-1})d\\tilde{\\psi}_{a-1}(s_{a-1})}\\end{array}$ , where the term under the integral is the probability that a firm in cohort $a-1$ is not shut down in the next period, and let  \n\n$$\n\\tilde{\\psi}_{a}(d s)=\\frac{\\displaystyle\\int P(d s_{a}|s_{a-1})d\\tilde{\\psi}_{a-1}(s_{a-1})}{S_{a}/S_{a-1}}.\n$$  \n\nNext, let $\\begin{array}{r}{\\tilde{e}_{a}\\equiv\\int(n(s,z^{\\ast})+c_{f})d\\tilde{\\psi}_{a}}\\end{array}$ denote the average firm size of the age $a$ cohort. Let $E_{t a}$ denote total employment by that cohort at time $t$ In addition to average firm size $\\tilde{e}_{a}$ ， total employment $E_{t a}$ depends on the original mass of entrants in that cohort and their survival rate,  \n\n$$\nE_{t a}=m_{t-a}S_{a}\\tilde{e}_{a}.\n$$  \n\nTotal employment by incumbents (i.e., excluding new entrants) at time $t$ is the sum of employment by cohorts with age greater than one, $\\begin{array}{r}{E_{t}^{I}=\\sum_{1}^{t}E_{t a}^{\\phantom{'}}}\\end{array}$ . On adding $E_{t}^{I}$ and total employment by entrants $m_{t}(S_{0}\\tilde{e}_{0}+c_{e})$ , we recover the resource constraint  \n\n$$\nN_{t}=m_{t}(S_{0}\\tilde{e}_{0}+c_{e})+E_{t}^{I}.\n$$  \n\nGiven that the aggregate state equals $z^{*}$ in every period, $S_{a}$ and $\\tilde{e}_{a}$ are known at time $t$ Because $m_{t-a}$ , and, therefore, $E_{t}^{I}$ , are also known at time $t$ , the only unknown in the above equation is $m_{t}$ . It follows that equation (6) implicitly determines $m_{t}$ such that the resource constraint holds. If $m_{t}$ is strictly positive, all equilibrium conditions hold and the existence argument is complete. The necessary condition for strictly positive $m_{t}$ is that labor demand for incumbent firms does not exceed total labor force, $\\bar{E_{t}^{I}}<N_{t}$ , in every period $t$ .21  \n\nThe following proposition provides sufcient conditions for strictly positive entry.  \n\nPROPOsITION 1—Suffcient Conditions for Strictly Positive Entry: $A$ uniqueequilibrium with strictly positive entry exists if $N_{t}$ is a nondecreasing sequence and $S_{a}\\tilde{e}_{a}$ is nonincreasing.  \n\nThe intuition is as follows. Because $N_{t}$ is a nondecreasing sequence, a sufficient condition for $E_{t+1}^{I}<N_{t+1}$ , which guarantees strictly positive entry in period $t+1$ , is that $E_{t+1}^{I}<N_{t}$ .Notethat  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{N_{t}=m_{t}S_{0}\\tilde{e}_{0}+m_{t-1}S_{1}\\tilde{e}_{1}+\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot+m_{0}S_{t}\\tilde{e}_{t}+m_{t}c_{e},}\\ {E_{t+1}^{I}=m_{t}S_{1}\\tilde{e}_{1}+m_{t-1}S_{2}\\tilde{e}_{2}+\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot+m_{0}S_{t+1}\\tilde{e}_{t+1}.~}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nTherefore, $E_{t+1}^{I}$ is the inner product of the same vector of the mass of entrants as $N_{t}$ ， with a forward shift in the corresponding terms $S_{a}\\tilde{e}_{a}$ and without the entry cost term $m_{t}c_{e}$ A sufficient condition for. $N_{t}-E_{t+1}^{I}>0$ every period is that $S_{a}\\tilde{e}_{a}$ decreases with $a$ . For a given cohort, this condition is equivalent to saying that the total employment of the cohort is decreasing in age. In the data, survival rates are decreasing in $a$ but average size of a cohort, when properly calibrated, is increasing. Therefore, the sufficient condition holds when shutdown rates are sufficiently high to offset the growth in average size.22  \n\nWhile the conditions in Proposition 1 are sufficient for existence of equilibrium, they are not necessary. If these conditions are violated, it simply needs to be verified that entry is positive every period.  \n\n#### 3.2.2. Properties of the Equilibrium  \n\nNow that we have established the existence of the equilibrium, we discuss its properties.  \n\nCOROLLARY 1—-Invariance of Age Profiles: Exit rates by age, average firm size by age, and size distributions by age are invariant to changes in population growth.  \n\nThis corollary follows because firm exit decisions and optimal scale of operation do not change as population grows at nonconstant rates. By equation (6), the invariance of age profiles implies that the mass of entrants $m_{t}$ is linear in $N_{t}$  \n\nCOROLLARY 2—-Dynamic Entry Equation: The mass of entrants in equilibrium is given by  \n\n$$\nm_{t}=\\frac{N_{t}-\\displaystyle\\sum_{a=1}^{t}m_{t-a}S_{a}\\tilde{e}_{a}}{S_{0}\\tilde{e}_{0}+c_{e}}.\n$$  \n\nIn equilibrium, changes in $N_{t}$ are accommodated along the extensive margin by changes in entry. The dynamic entry equation also shows that entry is history dependent: current entry $m_{t}$ depends on the distributed lags of past entry $m_{t-a}$ . History dependence implies that a one-time shock to firm entry today will have persistent effects on future entry through the mass of incumbents $m_{t-a}$ in future periods.  \n\n### 3.3. Rates of Entry and Exit  \n\nIn this section, we examine the link between the age distribution of firms and aggregate rates of entry and exit. We then explore how changes in population growth affect aggregate variables via the age distribution along steady states and transitional paths.  \n\nThe mass of aggregate exit at time $t$ denoted $X_{t}$ , is the sum of exit masses of different age cohorts. Exit of firms of age $a$ equals the difference in survival rates $S_{a-1}-S_{a}$ multiplied by the size of the cohort at entry, $m_{t-a}$ . We follow here the convention that the age at which a firm is shut down corresponds to the age at which the firm last drew its idiosyncratic state. The model allows for entrants to exit immediately without producing. The mass of immediate exits $m_{t}(1-S_{0})$ are excluded from aggregate exit. It follows that the mass of aggregate exit is given by  \n\n$$\nX_{t}=\\sum_{a=1}^{t}m_{t-a}(S_{a-1}-S_{a}).\n$$  \n\nThe number of firms at $t-1$ is given by  \n\n$$\nM_{t-1}=\\sum_{a=1}^{t}m_{t-a}S_{a-1}.\n$$  \n\nLet $\\tilde{\\xi}_{a}\\equiv(S_{a-1}-S_{a})/S_{a-1}$ denote the probability of exit at age $a$ . The aggregate exit rate $\\xi_{t}\\equiv X_{t}/M_{t-1}$ can be expressed as the weighted average of exit rates of different cohorts,  \n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{t}=\\sum_{a=1}^{t}\\left(\\frac{m_{t-a}S_{a-1}}{\\displaystyle\\sum_{a=1}^{t}m_{t-a}S_{a-1}}\\right)\\boldsymbol{\\tilde{\\xi}}_{a},\n$$  \n\nwhere the term in brackets is the share of firms of age $a-1$ in the total mass of firms at time $t-1$ . Exit rates by age do not change with population growth by the invariance of age profiles corollary. Therefore, the aggregate exit rate is only a function of the age distribution of firms, which in turn is determined by past entry. This formula highlights the role of firm demographics in determining the aggregate exit rate. Because the exit rates are different across firm ages, a change in the age distribution of firms affects the aggregate exit rate. The exception, of course, is when exit rates are the same for all cohorts. In that case, the aggregate exit rate is independent of the age distribution.  \n\nNow consider entry rates. We define $m_{t}S_{0}$ as the mass of entrants.23 Let $e_{t}\\equiv N_{t}/M_{t}$ denote average employment. The rate of growth in the number of firms is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{M_{t}}{M_{t-1}}=\\frac{N_{t}}{N_{t-1}}\\frac{e_{t-1}}{e_{t}}.\n$$  \n\nThe mass of firms $M_{t}$ can be decomposed into the mass of surviving incumbents plus the mass of entrants,  \n\n$$\nM_{t}=(1-\\xi_{t})M_{t-1}+m_{t}S_{0}.\n$$  \n\nSolving for $M_{t}$ in equation (9) and substituting in the above equation gives the following expression for the entry rate, $\\lambda_{t}\\equiv m_{t}S_{0}/M_{t-1}$  \n\n$$\n\\lambda_{t}=\\left(\\frac{N_{t}}{N_{t-1}}\\frac{e_{t-1}}{e_{t}}-1\\right)+\\xi_{t}.\n$$  \n\nThis expression is the discrete-time version of identity (1). It says that the entry rate is increasing in population growth, decreasing in average employment growth, and increasing in the exit rate. This expression also shows how a change in the entry rate feeds back into itself. Consider an increase in labor force growth $N_{t}/N_{t-1}$ . This leads to an initial increase in entry, which shifts the age distribution toward younger firms. The aggregate exit rate $\\xi_{t}$ is a weighted average of cohort exit rates $\\tilde{\\xi}_{a}$ and age weights. Because exit rates are decreasing in age, a larger share of young firms leads to a higher aggregate exit rate, and consequently to higher entry. In addition, changes in average employment further impact the entry rate. The initial rise in entry rates increases the share of younger firms, which tend to be smaller. This lowers average employment and, from equation (10), further increases the rate of entry. Thus, entry rates increase by more than the initial increase in the rate of population growth.  \n\nLong-Run versus Adjustment Path. Suppose we are in a steady state with population growing at a constant rate $g$ .Because average employment $e_{t}$ is constant along the steady state, the cohort entry weights $m_{t-a}$ decay as a function of age at the rate $1+g$ ${m_{t-a}}=$ $(1+g)^{-a}m_{t}$ . The aggregate exit rate along the steady state, denoted $\\xi^{\\mathrm{{SS}}}$ , follows from equation (8):  \n\n$$\n\\xi^{\\mathrm{SS}}=\\sum_{a=1}^{\\infty}\\biggl(\\frac{(1+g)^{-a}S_{a-1}}{\\displaystyle\\sum_{a=1}^{\\infty}(1+g)^{-a}S_{a-1}}\\biggr)\\tilde{\\xi}_{a},\n$$  \n\nwhich is independent of $t$ . This equation shows that the long run exit rate $\\xi^{\\mathrm{{SS}}}$ is intimately related to rate of population growth $g$ . The aggregate exit rate is an average of the exit rates of different cohorts $\\tilde{\\xi}_{a}$ , weighted by the corresponding share of surviving firms in each cohort. It is easy to see that, for higher values of $g$ , the weights decrease faster with age a. Empirically, younger firms exit at higher rates. Therefore, higher population growth, which shifts weight toward younger firms, is associated with higher long-run aggregate exit rates.  \n\nPROPOsITION 2—-Long-Run Multiplier Effect: Assume exit rates by age $\\tilde{\\xi}_{a}$ aredecreasing in cohort age a. Then the long-run aggregate exit rate $\\xi^{\\mathrm{SS}}$ is increasing in population growth $g$  \n\nBecause average employment $e_{t}$ is constant in a steady state, the steady-state entry rate in equation (10), denoted $\\lambda^{\\mathrm{SS}}$ , is also independent of $t$ .24Wehave  \n\n$$\n\\lambda^{\\mathrm{SS}}=g+\\xi^{\\mathrm{SS}}.\n$$  \n\nThe entry rate equals the sum of the population growth rate and the exit rate. The intuition is simple. Entrants must replace the exiting firms. In addition, because average employment is constant, the total mass of firms needs to grow at the rate of population growth, $g$ , to clear the labor market. Therefore, there must be enough entry to also create this extra employment. When exit rates are decreasing in age, as occurs in practice, a change $\\Delta g$ in the rate of population growth leads to a change in the long-run aggregate exit rate $\\dot{\\Delta}\\xi^{\\mathrm{ss}}$ of the same sign, as implied by Proposition 2. Therefore, the effect of population growth on the long-run rate of entry is amplified, $\\Delta\\lambda^{\\mathrm{SS}}>\\Delta g$ . We refer to this as the long-run multiplier effect. In our quantitative analysis, we find that it is in the order of 1.5 for the U.S. economy.  \n\nThe effect of transitional dynamics can be illustrated by considering the impact of a period of rising labor force growth, as exhibited by the U.S. economy after the baby boom. Compared to the steady state with constant population growth, rising population growth over time shifts the firm-age distribution toward younger cohorts. This results in aggregate exit rates greater than, and average size lower than, the steady state. Even in the hypothetical case that the rate of population growth is constant at its peak after the initial rise in the 1970s, the U.s. economy should have seen a decrease in entry rates, as the aggregate exit rate and average firm size converge to their corresponding long-run values. Section 4.1.1 explores the role of the baby boom by decomposing changes in U.S. entry rates into long-run versus transitional effects.  \n\n## 4. QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS  \n\nThe theory section described a class of models under which firm demographics variables by age are invariant to changes in the growth rate of the labor force. This class of models share a common difference equation for entry that can be used to answer a number of quantitative questions. Can changes in labor force growth, combined with feedback from firm demographics, quantitatively generate the secular changes experienced by the U.S. economy? What is the role of the feedback effect? What is the role of transitional dynamics and, therefore, the importance of the baby boom?  \n\nThe dynamic entry equation (7) determines the evolution of the firm-age distribution given an exogenous labor force series, the cost of entry, an initial age distribution, and an age profile for exit rate and average size. In principle, one could iterate the dynamic entry equation forward without further need of a model. However, while there is reliable data on labor force growth, there is limited data on the initial age distribution and firm demographics variables. Specifically, not all firms born before 1978 have an age assigned to them in BDS data. This implies that (i) the 1978 firm-age distribution is unknown, and that (ii) average size by age ${\\tilde{e}}_{a}$ and survival probabilities by age $S_{a}$ for firms born before 1978 are also unknown.  \n\nWe use a structural model to fil the gaps in the data. In particular, the model generates a stochastic process for employment. The employment process consists of the distribution of entrant employment, the evolution of employment over time, and an exit rule. Therefore, the employment process implies values for the age profile of exit and average size. In order to obtain the 1978 firm-age distribution, we make use of historical labor force data which goes back to 1940. We assume the U.S. economy was in a steady state in 1940, implying that the 1940 firm-age distribution corresponds to the stationary distribution of the employment process. We then feed data on labor force growth and iterate the dynamic entry equation forward to obtain the firm-age distribution in 1978. Doing so allows us to obtain the 1978 age distribution that is consistent with historical labor force growth, and in particular, the baby boom.25  \n\nThe parameterization we present is consistent with any economy that generates the same employment process and falls within the theoretical framework laid out in Section 3. We present the parameters for two such economies, the perfect competition economy and the monopolistic competition with constant markup economy.26 These two economies are isomorphic with respect to the implied firm dynamics, once the parameters are appropriately reinterpreted.  \n\nThe model period is set to one year. The time discount factor $\\beta$ is set to 0.96. The steady-state labor force growth rate $g$ prior to 1940 is set to a standard value of $1\\%$ . The aggregate state $z^{*}$ and the idiosyncratic state $s$ enter the profit function multiplicatively, which leads to an identification problem. We normalize the aggregate state $z^{*}$ to unity to get around this identification problem, as in Hopenhayn and Rogerson (1993). The curvature of the revenue function is parameterized by $\\alpha$ , which is set to the standard value of 0.64. In the perfect competition economy, the parameter $\\alpha$ represents the degree of decreasing returns to scale in the production function of a firm, with $q(n,s)$ equal to $s n^{\\alpha}$ ， which can be interpreted as the managerial span of control. In the economy featuring monopolistic competition with constant markup, $\\alpha$ maps to the elasticity parameter $\\eta$ The value of $\\eta$ equal to 0.64 implies that the elasticity of substitution, $1/(1-\\eta)$ , is close to its standard value of 3.  \n\nThe idiosyncratic state $s$ determines firm size in the model. In addition to the differences in the idiosyncratic state, we introduce permanent differences across firms by allowing firms in the economy to be of two types, high and low.27 High-type firms have (i) a higher long-run mean of their Markov processes and (i) a higher labor overhead. The high-type firms roughly correspond to “superstar” firms. In the estimated model, these firms account for about $5\\%$ of firms, $30\\%$ of employment, and grow to be 7 times larger than low-type firms on average.  \n\nThe Markov process followed by the idiosyncratic state $s$ is AR(1),  \n\n$$\n\\log(s_{t+1})=(1-\\rho)\\mu_{i}+\\rho\\log(s_{t})+\\varepsilon_{t+1};\\quad\\varepsilon_{t+1}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma_{\\varepsilon}^{2}),\n$$  \n\nwith $\\mu_{i}$ as the long-run mean that varies with type $i\\in\\{\\ell,h\\}$ $\\rho$ as the persistence, and $\\sigma_{\\varepsilon}^{2}$ as the variance of shocks. Firms draw their type after paying the entry cost $c_{e}$ . Once drawn, the type is fixed throughout the lifetime of the firm. The probability of drawing the high type is parameterized by $\\omega_{h}$ . In addition to drawing their type, entrants draw their idiosyncratic state from a lognormal distribution $G$ with mean $\\mu_{G}$ and variance $\\sigma_{G}^{2}$ The state $s$ then evolves according to the corresponding AR(1) process. The evolution of employment at the firm level depends on the idiosyncratic state $s$ , labor overhead of each type, $c_{f\\ell}$ and $c_{f h}$ , and an endogenous exit threshold for each type, $s_{\\ell}^{*}$ and $\\boldsymbol{s}_{h}^{*}$  \n\nThere are ten additional parameters that need to be determined: $c_{e},\\mu_{G},\\sigma_{G},\\rho,\\sigma_{\\varepsilon},\\mu_{\\ell},$ $\\mu_{h},c_{f\\ell},c_{f h}$ , and $\\omega_{h}$ . We jointly estimate these parameters using a generalized method of moments estimator. The estimator minimizes the distance between moments from the beginning of the BDS sample and their model counterparts. In particular, we target the 1978 to i983 time-series average of the firm entry rate, entrant size, concentration of entrants, 5-year firm growth and exit rates, firm share of sizes 1 to 4, and employment share of firms with $^{250+}$ ， $1000+$ , and $^{10,000+}$ employees.  \n\nWhen choosing the set of targeted moments, we tried to strike a balance between firm-weighted moments, which our theory shows are economically important, and employment-weighted moments, which might be more accurately measured in BDs data. The cost of entry primarily targets the entry rate. From the dynamic entry equation, matching the average entrant size is necessary to match the entry rate, so we target this moment. Average entrant size is determined primarily by $\\mu_{G}$ , the mean of the entrant productivity distribution $G$ . The dispersion $\\sigma_{G}$ determines the thickness of the right tail Oof $G$ and, therefore, targets the concentration of entrants. The dispersion of the productivity process $\\sigma_{\\varepsilon}$ affects the weight on productivity gridpoints at which firms exit, so it  \n\nTABLE III ESTIMATION.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"6\">Assigned</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\">Value</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">β</td><td colspan=\"2\">Discount factor</td><td>Standard</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">Curvature of revenue function</td><td>Standard</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">0.01</td><td colspan=\"2\">Labor force growth rate (SS)</td><td>Standard</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\"></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\">JointlyEstimated</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\">Parameters Definition</td></tr><tr><td>Value</td><td></td><td>SE</td><td></td><td>Data</td><td>Model</td></tr><tr><td>Ce</td><td>0.013</td><td>(0.008) Entry cost</td><td></td><td>Entry rate 13.14%</td><td>13.20%</td></tr><tr><td>μG</td><td>-4.344</td><td>(0.723)</td><td>Mean of entrant dist.</td><td>Avg.entrant size 5.96</td><td>5.55</td></tr><tr><td>OG</td><td>1.331</td><td>(0.462)</td><td>Std. dev. of entrant dist.</td><td>Conc. of entrants</td><td>4.89% 5.19%</td></tr><tr><td>p</td><td>0.984</td><td>(0.001)</td><td>Persistence of AR(1)</td><td>5-year growth rate</td><td>73.86% 76.69%</td></tr><tr><td>Oe</td><td>0.246</td><td>(0.041)</td><td>Std. dev. of AR(1) shocks</td><td>5-year exit rate</td><td>55.01% 54.32%</td></tr><tr><td>μ</td><td>-2.431</td><td>(0.849)</td><td>Low-type AR(1) long-run mean z*=1</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>μh</td><td>-1.436 (1.756)</td><td>High-type AR(1) long-run mean</td><td>Emp. share 10,000+</td><td>26%</td><td>18.19%</td></tr><tr><td>Cfe</td><td>2.299 (0.871)</td><td>Labor overhead low type</td><td>Firm share size 1 to 4</td><td>55.98</td><td>58.36</td></tr><tr><td>Cfh</td><td>24.308 (5.860)</td><td>Labor overhead high type</td><td>Emp. share 1000+</td><td>41.64%</td><td>40.30%</td></tr><tr><td>Wh</td><td>0.359 (0.179)</td><td>Share of high-type entrants</td><td>Agg. concentration</td><td>52.35%</td><td>51.66%</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNote: All data and model moments are time averages from 1978 to 1983.

The persistence parameter $\\rho$ mainly determines the rate of convergence of the AR(1) processes to their respective long-run means, so we use it to target the 5-year growth rate of firms. High-type firms are larger than low-type firms. They matter most in terms of their employment shares, so we set their long-run mean $\\mu_{h}$ ， their labor overhead $c_{f h}$ , and their share at birth $\\omega_{h}$ to target three right-tail moments of the employment-weighted size distribution: the employment share of firm size $^{250+}$ $1000+$ , and $^{10,000+}$ . Finally, the labor overhead of low-type firms is most important in determining the share of firms in the smallest size bin, the 1 to 4 employees category.  \n\nTable IlI reports the estimated parameters and standard errors, along with the fit to the targets. Figure 5 shows the match of the firm size distribution in the model and the data. The inclusion of firm types allows the model to better match the tails of the firm size distribution.  \n\nTable IV reports firm demographics variables both in the model and the data. The age profiles of exit, size, and concentration in the model follow an expected pattern given that entrants start small and converge to a higher long-run mean: the probability of exit is decreasing in age, average firm size is increasing in age, and concentration increases with age. As mentioned earlier, all of these patterns are present in the data.28  \n\n![](images/1f6f8ce7ebf306f7821f18431b48fca99ad570253131bc470c73a6c0b20ebec0.jpg)  \nFIGURE 5.—1978 Firm size distribution.  \n\n### 4.1. Firm Entry  \n\nFigure 6 presents the findings for the entry rate. We highlight three distinct nontargeted episodes that the model matches well. The first episode is related to World War I1.29 The years around the war exhibited large fuctuations in the entry rate. The labor force growth series also exhibits large fuctuations around the same time, corresponding to large numbers of civilians leaving the labor force to join the war effort and then returning after the war. Through the lens of our model, these large labor force growth  \n\nTABLE IV AGE PROFILES.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">ExitRate</td><td colspan=\"2\">AverageFirm Size</td><td colspan=\"2\">Concentration</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>Data (%)</td><td>Model (%)</td><td>Data</td><td>Model</td><td>Data (%)</td><td>Model (%)</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>一</td><td>一</td><td>6.05</td><td>5.55</td><td>5.90</td><td>5.19</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>21.85</td><td>21.51</td><td>7.73</td><td>6.29</td><td>12.29</td><td>7.13</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>15.86</td><td>15.76</td><td>8.46</td><td>7.05</td><td>13.29</td><td>9.18</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>13.43</td><td>13.06</td><td>9.14</td><td>7.89</td><td>14.83</td><td>11.44</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>11.68</td><td>11.42</td><td>9.77</td><td>8.80</td><td>16.45</td><td>13.93</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>10.48</td><td>10.30</td><td>10.36</td><td>9.80</td><td>17.84</td><td>16.66</td></tr><tr><td>6-10</td><td>8.32</td><td>8.51</td><td>11.98</td><td>13.49</td><td>23.00</td><td>25.96</td></tr><tr><td>11-15</td><td>6.40</td><td>6.85</td><td>15.08</td><td>21.52</td><td>31.85</td><td>41.34</td></tr><tr><td>16-20</td><td>5.56</td><td>6.04</td><td>18.81</td><td>31.87</td><td>40.68</td><td>53.90</td></tr><tr><td>21-25</td><td>4.99</td><td>5.55</td><td>24.03</td><td>43.82</td><td>50.47</td><td>62.92</td></tr><tr><td>Above25</td><td>4.29</td><td>4.93</td><td>81.59</td><td>78.51</td><td>78.91</td><td>76.23</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: Concentration is the share of employment in firms with $^{250+}$ employees within the age category divided by total employment in the age category.

Note: We only target the entry rate from 1978 to 1983. The entry rate in the model for the other years is not targeted.  \n\nfluctuations translate into similarly large fuctuations in the entry rate. Second, the model generates the apparent increase in the entry rate before 1978. This increase is driven by the steady increase in labor force growth during the same time period, largely reflecting the baby boom generations entering the labor force.30  \n\nFinally, the feedback effects from firm demographics amplify the approximately 2pp decline in the labor force growth between 1978 and 2014 into the approximately 6pp decline in the entry rate. As discussed earlier, in the model this amplification arises through an aging of the firm distribution: the share of firms over 10 years of age increases by $13\\mathrm{pp}$ Given the age distribution is history dependent, the glut of frms born due to the baby boom will impact firm entry in the decades that follow. The next section discusses the importance of the baby boom for the post-1978 period.  \n\n#### 4.1.1. The Role of the Baby Boom  \n\nThe first column of Table V begins by breaking down the post-1978 changes in the entry rate into the direct effect of labor force growth and the feedback effects of firm demographics using identity (1). The entry rate in the model declines by $6.08\\mathrm{pp}$ between 1978 and 2014. Of this decline, $30\\%$ $(1.88\\mathrm{pp})$ is accounted for by the decline in labor force growth. The $30\\%$ decline would occur even in the absence of firm demographics, that is, without differences in average size and exit rates by firm age. The remaining $70\\%$ is due to the feedback effect of firm demographics. An aging firm distribution pushes the aggregate exit rate down by 1.81pp and increases the growth rate of average firm size by  \n\nTABLEV DECOMPOSITION:STEADYSTATE VERSUS TRANSITIONAL EFFECTS.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Total Change (Tr2014 —Tr1978)</td><td>Long-Run Effect (SS2014—SS1978)</td><td>1978Transition Effect (SS1978 —Tr1978)</td><td>2014Transition Effect (Tr2014 —SS2014)</td></tr><tr><td>△LFGrowth</td><td>-1.88</td><td>-1.88</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>+△ExitRate</td><td>-1.81</td><td>-0.88</td><td>-0.30</td><td>-0.63</td></tr><tr><td>-△AFSGrowth</td><td>2.11</td><td>0</td><td>1.16</td><td>0.95</td></tr><tr><td>+△Residual</td><td>-0.28</td><td>0</td><td>-0.02</td><td>-0.26</td></tr><tr><td>EntryRate</td><td>-6.08</td><td>-2.76</td><td>1.47</td><td>-1.84</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNote: All values are in percentage points. The total decline in the entry rate $(6.08\\mathrm{pp})$ is the sum of the long-run effect $(2.76\\mathrm{pp})$ ， the 1978 transition effect $(1.47\\mathrm{pp})$ , and the 2014 transition effect $(1.84\\mathrm{pp})$ . With entry costs denominated in units of labor, identity (1) holds approximately, $\\lambda\\approx\\hat{N}+\\dot{\\xi}-\\hat{e}$ . The residual corresponds to changes in the growth rate of labor allocated toward the creation of entrants.  \n\n2.11pp. The direct effect of labor force growth and the feedback effect together add up to 5.80pp. The remaining $0.28\\mathrm{pp}$ is due to a residual arising from changes in labor allocated to the creation of entrants.31  \n\nIn order to discuss the role of the glut of firms born due to the baby boom, we further decompose the change in each variable into long-run and transitional effects. The longrun effect is the change that can be attributed to differences across two steady states: a 2014 steady state, which effectively assumes that labor force in the pre-2014 years grew at a constant rate equal to its 2014 value, and a 1978 steady state, which assumes that labor force in the pre-1978 years grew at a constant rate equal to its 1978 value.32 The long-run effect lowers entry by 2.76pp, which is $45\\%$ of the total decline. This reflects the direct effect of a decline in labor force growth, which accounts for 1.88pp, and the long-run multiplier effect of labor force growth on exit rates of 0.88pp presented in Proposition 2.  \n\nBecause the steady states assume a history of constant labor force growth, the resulting firm-age distributions do not capture the effect of the baby boom. The effect of the glut of firms due to the baby boom is instead captured by the transitional dynamics, which accountfor $55\\%$ of the total decline in the entry rate. The effect of transitional dynamics can be further broken down into differences between the 1978 steady state and the transition path in 1978, which we refer to as the 1978 transition effect, and the difference between the 2014 steady state and transition path in 2014, which we refer to as the 2014 transition effect. These effects are reported in the last two columns of Table V.  \n\nThe 1978 transition effect accounts for a $1.47\\mathrm{pp}$ drop in the entry rate. This occurs for two main reasons. First, the exit rate in the 1978 transition is 0.30pp higher than the exit rate in the 1978 steady state. This is because the 1978 firm age distribution is younger in the transition, as shown in Figure 7(a), reflecting the pre-1978 rise in firm entry rates. Second, the growth in average firm size in the 1978 steady state is zero, while average size in the 1978 transition exhibits a growth rate of negative 1.16pp. This negative growth rate is due to the fact that the firm distribution is still getting younger in 1978, mostly reflecting the pre-1978 increase in labor force growth. The age distribution starts getting older only after after a few years of declining labor force growth. The resulting time series of average firm size is U-shaped, with the minimum point reached in 1980.  \n\n![](images/c21a41ca57968ef8fd41d1872ca472314a09043c5e700ddeba1c51a4183cc695.jpg)  \nFIGURE 7.—-Firm age distributions.  \n\nThe 2014 transition effect accounts for the remaining $1.84\\mathrm{pp}$ drop in the entry rate. This can again be traced to the baby boom and firm aging. First, the glut of firms born due to the baby boom nearly four decades earlier have not yet died off. As shown in Figure 7(b), these surviving firms imply that the firm-age distribution in the 2014 transition is older than the 2014 steady state. Consequently, the exit rate in the 2014 transition is $0.63\\mathrm{pp}$ lower than the exit rate in the 2014 steady state. Second, unlike the 2014 steady state, the firm distribution continues to age in the 2014 transition. As a result, average firm size continues to grow, which lowers the entry rate by an additional 0.95pp.33  \n\nGiven the central role of age distributions in transition versus steady-state comparisons, it is useful to contrast the corresponding age distributions to those in the data. While the empirical 1978 age distribution is unknown, we can compare statistics in 2014. Figure 7(b) shows the 2014 age distributions in the data, the transition and the steady state. The 2014 transitional distribution better approximates the data. This observation, taken together with the strength of the transitional effects, indicates that the glut of baby boom firms is an important feature of the data.  \n\n### 4.2. Exit Rate, Average Firm Size, and Concentration  \n\nThe evolution of the firm-age distribution along the transitional path, combined with the age profiles of exit, size, and concentration presented earlier, generates an aggregate time-series for each these variables. Figure 8 presents the time series for each of these variables in the model and in the data. The data series are presented in two ways: the actual series and the changes in the variable that would occur if aging was the only force. As discussed earlier in equation (2), the “aging only” statistic shows the total change net of changes within age groups. Therefore, the difference between the data line and the \"aging only\" line is the magnitude of the changes within age groups.  \n\n![](images/cbfb5bfc1bf27a1b3ba7aceb079891a5aac84d657ed9f7d7fc922d0d044f793b.jpg)  \nFIGURE 8.—Model versus data: Exit rate, average firm size, and concentration.  \n\nThe impact of the aging force are well captured by the model. Aging in the data, by itself, leads to an $18\\%$ decline in exit, a $43\\%$ increase in average firm size, and a $16\\%$ increase in concentration.34 These changes are close to the model-generated $16\\%$ decline in exit, $41\\%$ increase in average firm size, and $15\\%$ increase in concentration. The actual changes in the data are smaller than the changes due to aging only, indicating that withinage group effects also play a role in generating the aggregate time series, particularly for average firm size and concentration. Section 5 discusses what additional forces can help generate these changes within age groups.  \n\n## 5. DISCUSSION  \n\nLabor Share.  In recent work, Hartman-Glaser, Lustig, and Xiaolan (2019), Autor et al. (2020), and Kehrig and Vincent (2021) find that almost all of the recent decline of the U.S. aggregate labor share is due to reallocation of value-added from high to low labor share units, rather than a decline in labor share within units. These studies further document a negative relationship between firm size and labor share. It follows that the decline in the aggregate labor share is primarily due to reallocation of economic activity toward larger firms, that is, increasing concentration. Firm aging induced by the slowdown in population growth provides a driving force that is consistent with these empirical findings. It leads to a reallocation of market shares toward older firms, which are larger and have lower labor shares.35  \n\nBefore we can illustrate the implications of firm aging as a driving force, we need to generate a negative relationship between firm size and labor share. We do so using overhead labor, as in Atkeson and Kehoe (2005).36 Total employment at the firm level includes both overhead and productive labor. With fixed overhead labor, labor shares decline with firm size.  \n\n![](images/24bab23f891465421cb5e94e1bc72cbf482b4a86883bec2f53a7ec2e07feb86e.jpg)  \nFIGURE 9.—Corporate labor share (relative to 1980). Note: For each series, the vertical axis shows the corporate labor share in year t minus its 1980 value.  \n\nFigure 9 plots the cumulative change in the aggregate labor share implied by firm aging. That figure also presents two measure of the corporate labor share, one from Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) and another from Koh, Santaeulalia-Llopis, and Zheng (2020).37 Firm aging generates the hump-shaped pattern seen in the Koh, Santaeulalia-Llopis, and Zheng (2020) series. From 1940 to 1980, the aggregate labor share increases with the entry rate because entrants are small in size and, therefore, have higher labor shares. From 1980 onwards, as firms age and grow in size the share of firms with low labor shares increases, leading to a decline in the aggregate labor share, as in the Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) series.  \n\nJob Creation, Destruction, and Reallocation. In addition to firm entry rates, the U.s. has also experienced a decline in the job creation, destruction, and reallocation rates.38 These rates exhibit age effects: older firms create, destroy, and reallocate jobs at lower rates. Therefore, firm aging induced by labor force growth qualitatively generates a decline in aggregate job creation and destruction rates. To explore the quantitative role of firm aging, we take average job creation and destruction rates by age from BDs data and use the evolution of the firm-age distribution from the structural model to calculate aggregate job creation, destruction, and reallocation rates.39 Figure 10 shows the resulting time series, along with the data. A statistic that summarizes the role of firm aging is the ratio of the slope of the trendline from 1978 to 2014 in the composition time series to the slope of the trendline in the actual time series for the same years. By this measure, aging explains $48\\%$ of the decline in the job creation rate, $38\\%$ of the decline in the job destruction rate, and $32\\%$ of the decline in the job reallocation rate.40 These numbers are larger than those found by previous empirical studies, such as Decker et al. (2014). The main reason for this difference is that the structural model allows us to unpack the left censored group in the data, so we can perform an analysis with a finer age distribution and over a longer period of time.  \n\n![](images/04c65eeaf4bd43d2ff78ad049bd4addbd3e7f4908d7e0bad980a36562c2971f8.jpg)  \nFIGURE 10.—The role of firm aging in job reallocation, job creation, and job destruction.  \n\nHigh Tech Sectors. Decker, Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda (2020) document that business dynamism in the high tech sectors, inclusive of information, and communication technology, behaved differently than the rest of the U.S. economy. The rate of firm entry, exit and job reallocation in these sectors peaked about two decades later, in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Even though the high tech sectors only represent about $4\\%$ of firms and about $6\\%$ of employment (Goldschlag and Miranda (2020), they played an important role in the U.S. productivity surge and the subsequent slowdown (Byrne, Fernald, and Reinsdorf (2016)). In our framework, average annual productivity growth inherits the hump shape of labor force growth and declines concurrently with firm entry rates. Therefore, while the model does generate a slowdown in productivity, it does not capture the outsized role of the high tech sectors in aggregate productivity dynamics. However, because the high tech sectors represent a small share of firms and aggregate employment, these sectors have little effect on patterns of aggregate business dynamism along the dimensions we study: firm entry, exit, average size, and concentration.  \n\nEx ante Heterogeneity of Firms and Free Entry. Our analysis relies on the assumption of a perfectly elastic supply of firms. This leads to the very tractable and transparent difference equation for entry rates (7). This section briefly explores the possible implications of departures from this assumption.  \n\n![](images/a1d137ada20c95d7e5fd75cd0cea55bc23cf2689e61bbf3d5a5048aa906a56d2.jpg)  \nFIGURE 11.—Ratio of new firms to employment  \n\nThere are basically two forms of ex ante heterogeneity to be considered: differences in the cost of entry or in the distribution of opportunities faced by entrepreneurs. In other words, better entrepreneurs can either be more efficient in the startup stage or more successful thereafter. Either of these two assumptions introduces curvature in the extensive margin of entry, dampening the fall in entry rates, and giving a role to the intensive margin in the adjustment process. As a result, when labor force growth falls, the marginal entrepreneur (or idea) is positively selected, leading to a decrease in the equilibrium aggregate price z. In turn, this leads to a decrease in the average size and survival of incumbent firms. This force could help give a role to population growth in explaining the fall in average size observed for older firms in the data.41  \n\nTo further examine the potential role of ex ante heterogeneity at the extensive margin, we take a closer look at the evolution of entry rates. As a working hypothesis, we assume that the quality of the marginal entrant is a function of the ratio of new firms to total employment. This is consistent with the existence of an entrepreneurial talent pool or arrival of new ideas that scale with the labor force.42  \n\nFigure 11 presents the evolution of the ratio of new firms to total employment in the data, as well as the one implied by our model. The first thing to note is the huge range of variation between the starting and end points of our series, data, and model, where the ratio of new firms to employment is reduced by more than one-half. A large degree of curvature in the extensive margin within this range would have implied fairly dramatic changes at the intensive margin, which are not seen in our age conditional moments, at least for exit and concentration. The second thing to note, is that the data series and the one implied by the model, which by construction assumes no ex ante heterogeneity, are quite close. Combining these two observations, suggests that our assumption of no ex ante heterogeneity does not seem to be a bad approximation, at least within the ranges of entry observed.  \n\nAlternative Explanations. Several alternative explanations have been given in the literature to explain the observed rise in concentration and decrease in entry rates. These can be roughly grouped into three categories: (i) Some form of nonneutral technological change that allows a set of firms, usually the most productive, to reach a larger scale. This contributes directly to the rise of concentration. (i) An increase in the cost of entry that leads to the reduction of entry rates. As a result, incumbents must grow to absorb the residual labor force, so average firm size increases. (i) A decrease in the rate of diffusion. This increases incumbency advantage, making it harder for new firms to grow, thus decreasing the payoffs to entry.43 All these alternative explanations assume either labor force is fixed or growing at a constant rate. We discuss below that, by ignoring the effect of labor force growth, alternative theories must overstate the role of firm exit in generating the observed fall in entry rates.  \n\nTo put these theories in perspective,it is useful to go back to our identity on entry rates:  \n\nentry rate $=$ labor force growth - growth in average size $+$ exit rate.  \n\nIn a long run steady state, the growth in average size is zero so, holding fixed labor force growth, longstanding decreases in the entry rate must be associated with equally sized decreases in the long run exit rate. By equation (11), the same change in the aggregate exit rate can be obtained either by a change in labor force growth or by a proportional change in survival rates. In the absence of changes in labor force growth, the aggregate exit rate declines only due to an increase in survival rates. No matter what is the primitive source generating this increase in survival rates, it must be of the same order of magnitude as the fall in labor force growth needed to induce the same steady state decrease in the entry rate. So in order to generate the same long run impact as a $2\\%$ decline in labor force growth, to a first approximation, any alternative explanation must induce an average $2\\%$ decline in exit rates, conditional on age. The feedback effect from the change in the age distribution of firms results in an additional decrease of $1\\%$ in aggregate exit rates, as explained earlier, resulting in a total decline in exit rates of about $3\\%$ . In the data, the total decline in exit rate is in the order of $1.5\\%$ , half of that amount. This is almost entirely due to the change in the age distribution, so once controlling for age, there is almost no decline.  \n\nTo facilitate comparisons with alternative theories, we consider their implications within the context of our model.44 In each exercise, we consider steady-state comparisons and ignore transition paths. This is partly the assumption in many of the alternative models and also simplifies considerably the calculations. We take as benchmark the changes in steady-state values in our model resulting from the $2\\%$ decrease in population growth rate observed in the data. These are reported in the third row of Table VI. For reference, the first two rows give the total changes from 1978 to 2014 observed in the data and our results for the benchmark model, when including transitional dynamics.  \n\nTABLEVI ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>△Entry</td><td colspan=\"3\">Unconditional</td><td colspan=\"3\">Conditional onAge</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Rate</td><td>△ Exit Rate</td><td>Avg Size</td><td>△Conc.</td><td>△Exit Rate</td><td>Avg Size</td><td>△Conc.</td></tr><tr><td>Data (1978-2014)</td><td>-5.6</td><td>-1.6</td><td>3.5</td><td>5.7</td><td>0.4</td><td>-5.2</td><td>-2.5</td></tr><tr><td>Ourmodelwith transition</td><td>-6.1</td><td>-1.8</td><td>8.4</td><td>7.7</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>CHANGERELATIVETO1978SS</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Ourmodelnotransition</td><td>-2.8</td><td>-0.9</td><td>6.7</td><td>8.3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Increaseinreturns toscale</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.4</td><td>9.3</td><td>8.3</td><td>0.3</td><td>10.2</td><td>9.2</td></tr><tr><td>Higher entry cost</td><td>-2.7</td><td>-2.7</td><td>11.8</td><td>16.5</td><td>-2.0</td><td>4.1</td><td>9.3</td></tr><tr><td>Decreaseinmeanreversion</td><td>-2.8</td><td>-2.8</td><td>4.4</td><td>26.3</td><td>-1.8</td><td>-7.4</td><td>10.2</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNote: All values are in percentage points, except average size which is reported in levels. The bold values indicate targeted moments. The values for Data (1978-2014) are calculated by multiplying the corresponding annual time trends by 36, the number of years in the sample.  \n\nIncrease in Returns to Scale for the High Type.  This exercise is meant to capture a key element in the first group of theories, which is the increase in returns to scale for a selected set of firms. We restrict the increase in returns to scale to those firms in our model that have the potential to become superstar firms, which are the ones in the high-type group. Starting from our initial steady state, we set the increase in returns to scale so that concentration increases by 8.3pp in the new steady state. This is approximately the increase in concentration that we find in our own model, abstracting from the adjustment path. Table VI reports our results for different key aggregates. The gray cell is the targeted increase in concentration. There is an increase in entry and exit rates, contrary to what we see in the data. This has an intuitive explanation, as the ability of more productive firms to expand more has a competitive adverse effect on those that do not enjoy the increased benefits of scaling and this increases their exit rates. Average firm size increases by more than the benchmark. This increase is explained by a $10.2\\mathrm{pp}$ increase in average size conditional on age, while in the benchmark it is zero and slightly negative in the data.  \n\nThe results observed for this exercise are the net effect of the impact on different groups of firms. Those that benefit from the increase in returns to scale have higher survival rates and grow. At the same time, the increased competitive pressure from these firms, leads to higher exit rates and downsizing of those firms that do not enjoy the benefits of larger scale, as occurs for those in the low-type group in our exercise.45 In our case, the positively affected group expanded considerably, leading to the high increase in average size conditional on age observed in Table VI. The exit rate conditional on age increases, refecting the higher exit rates of the group of firms that do not enjoy the benefits of larger scale.  \n\nIncrease in Entry Cost. Starting at the original steady state, we increase the cost of entry so that in the new steady state the rate of entry decreases by a similar magnitude as in the benchmark. As anticipated, exit rates fall by the same magnitude as entry rates, exceeding the values observed in the data. In addition, we find increases of average firm size and concentration that are roughly three times as large as those in the data. While part of this increase is explained by the aging of firms, there is also significant increase in average firm size and concentration conditional on age, which is of the opposite sign as the one found in the data. This is explained by the general equilibrium effects of a rise in entry costs that imply an increase in the size and profitability of incumbent firms.  \n\nDecrease in the Rate of Diffusion. This exercise is meant to capture, in a reduced form way, the impact of a reduction in knowledge diffusion. There has been a growing literature on knowledge diffusion in macroeconomics; see, for example, Lucas and Moll (2014) and Stokey (2021). In most models, knowledge diffusion contributes to mean reversion. In our model, the average gap in size between any two firms is reduced at a rate $(1-\\rho)$ ,Wwhich is a measure of mean reversion. We decrease the degree of mean reversion to match the fall in entry rates as in our benchmark model. Results are reported in Table VI. Exit rates decrease by the same amount as the drop in entry rates, which again, exceeds the fall in the data. We find an increase in average firm size, close to the one observed in the data and a very large increase in concentration, substantially larger than the observed one. In spite of the increase in average size, there is a large drop when conditioned on age, which exceeds substantially the one observed in the data.46  \n\nIn models of creative destruction, as in Aghion and Howitt (1992) and Klette, Jakob, and Kortum (2004), there is another force. When knowledge diffuses from one firm to the other, the former loses market share while the latter grows. The frequency of arival of this event can be taken as a measure of the degree of knowledge diffusion. As this frequency decreases, so does the variance of innovations in firm size. In turn, this leads to a decrease in concentration, not an increase. Regarding exit rates (and thus entry rate) there appears to be an ambiguous effect. On the one hand, a decrease in the variance lowers the option value for staying in the market, which raises the exit rate. On the other hand, a lower variance decreases the likelihood of entering the exit zone for surviving firms. In a series of simulations, with decreases in the standard deviation of the innovation ranging from $5\\%$ to $50\\%$ , we found almost no effect on entry rates and a very strong reduction in concentration.47  \n\nWhile each of these alternative forces cannot explain the above empirical regularities by themselves, it is possible that they can complement the role of population growth. (In particular, they might help explain the fall in average firm size and concentration, conditional on age.) As an example, a lower (not higher) cost of entry, could mitigate the fall in entry rates and rise of average size that we find, and contribute to a fall in average size conditional on age. A decrease in mean reversion, as seen above, can help mitigate the rise in average firm size and contribute to a drop in age-conditional average size.  \n\nA rise in returns to scale, as modeled here, lead to counterfactual increases in average firm size and concentration, both conditional on age and to a mild increase in entry and exit rates.  \n\nIt is worth noting that these explanations might play out differently in models of creative destruction. Those models feature another channel: a fall in entry rates reduces the threat faced by incumbent firms. This effect in turn can contribute to a fall in exit rates. The effects on average firm size are likely to be ambiguous.48  \n\nPolicy Implications.  As pointed out in the theory section, our analysis is consistent with various kinds of models of perfect and imperfect competition. Without further details, it is not possible to discuss policy recommendations. In the case of perfect competition, standard welfare theorems apply so the equilibrium is Pareto Optimal. In contrast, the rise in markups in our third example could have negative welfare implications as the share (not size) of high markup firms increases.49 Similar considerations can be made about the fall in entry. While the reduction in the number of firms could have resulted in a fall in measured productivity, as pointed out in the paper, the policy implications again are not obvious. In our competitive benchmark, this fall in entry is an optimal response to the decrease in population growth and policies aimed at mitigating this effect would have distorted extensive versus intensive margins in the allocation of resources. In contrast, in a model where entrants have positive external effects (e.g., Luttmer (2007)) such kind of policies could be justified. More generally, if firms are considered knowledge, such policies might have a role in models of endogenous technical change based on Romer (1990).50  \n\n## 6. FINAL REMARKS  \n\nRecent decades have witnessed a decline in firm entry and exit rates, and an increase in employment concentration and average firm size. In contrast, none of these trends appear within firm-age bins. Therefore, the bulk of the aggregate change is explained by the aging of firms as a result of the decline in firm entry. We find that changes in population growth are a big driving force for changes in entry rates. While the direct effect of population demographics on the creation of new firms accounts for one-third of the total effect, the feedback from firm demographics accounts for the remaining two-thirds. The glut of firms born due to the baby boom generate rich transitional dynamics within these feedback effects, accounting for half of the total decline. The glut of firms impact outcomes far into the future. These firms are still around and continue to play a role in determining firm entry and related variables.  \n\nSeveral authors have emphasized the role of other potential factors, such as changes in economies of scale or the incentives for innovation. While other forces are likely to have contributed to explaining the observed trends in the evolution of aggregate productivity and firm dynamics, our analysis underscores that the effect of changes in population growth are too big a source of variation to omit.  \n\n# REFERENCES  \n\nmetrica, 60 (2), 323-351, http:/www.jstor.org/stable/2951599.

With recent growth restrained by depressed economic conditions, the company's net cash position has grown substantially.\" Hewlett-Packard1982AnnualReport.  \n\n## I. Introduction.  \n\nThere is a large finance and macroeconomic literature that studies the relation between corporate investment and cash flow to test for the presence and importance of financial constraints. Beginning with \"Financing Constraints and Corporate Investment,\" by Fazzari, Hubbard and Petersen (1988), henceforth FHP, these studies divide a sample of firms according to an a priori measure of financial constraints and compare the investment-cash flow sensitivities of the different subsamples.' The finding of a greater investment-cash flow sensitivity for the firms more likely to be constrained is typically interpreted as evidence of a large wedge between the internal and extermal cost of funds. According to the theory, this wedge, which is generally attributed to information problems in extermal capital markets, leads to underinvestment by firms that lack intermal funds. Some authors also have argued (e.g., Bermanke et al., 1994) that this wedge widens during recessions, worsening the underinvestment problem and exacerbating business cycle movements. These findings and the related interpretation has shaped the view of economists and policy makers on the functioning of extermal capital markets as well as on the effects of monetary andfiscalpolicy.  \n\nDespite the size and policy-relevance of this literature, the fundamental assumptions underlying it have been largely unexplored. While work subsequent to FHP has found that firms identified to be financially constrained according to an a priori criterion exhibit a greater sensitivity of investment to cash flow, no paper (of which we are aware) has verified directly whether a higher investment-cash flow sensitivity is related to financing problems and, if it is, in what way.  \n\nThis paper investigates the sources of the investment-cash flow sensitivity by undertaking an in-depth analysis of a sample of firms exhibiting an unusually high sensitivity of investment to cash flow. These firms are the 49 low dividend firms that FHP (1988) identify as financially constrained according to the investment-cash flow criterion.  \n\nBy using detailed and previously unexplored data sources, we try to determine the availability of and the demand for funds for each of the sample firms. We examine each firm's annual report or 10-K for each sample year, and we read management's discussion of liquidity that describes the firm's future needs for funds and the sources it plans to use to meet those needs. We integrate this information with quantitative data and with public news to derive as complete a picture as possible of the availability of internal and external funds for each firm as well as each firm's demand for funds. On this basis, we rank the extent to which the sample firms are financially constrained each year. We use the firm-year classifications to group the sample firms over seven or eight-year sub-periods, and over the entire sample period. Finally, we compare investment-cash flow sensitivities across the different groups of firms.  \n\nSurprisingly, we find that in only $15\\%$ of firm-years is there some question as to the ability of the firms to access intermal or external funds to increase investment. In $85\\%$ of firmyears, the firms could have increased their investment -- in many cases, substantially -- if they had so chosen. In fact, almost $40\\%$ of the sample firms -- including Hewlett-Packard -- could have increased their investment in every year of the sample period. Our partially qualitative measures of financial constraints are strongly corroborated by quantitative data on debt to total capital, interest coverage, the presence of restrictions on dividends, and financial slack (the level of cash and unused line of credit relative to investment).  \n\nMore strikingly, those firms classified as less financially constrained exhibit a significantly greater investment-cash flow sensitivity than those firms classified as more financially constrained. We find this patterm for the entire sample period, for sub-periods, and for individual years. This pattern is also robust to different criteria to divide constrained and unconstrained firms. For example, firms with healthy interest coverage in every sample year or in every sub-period year have investment-cash flow sensitivities twice as large as the remaining firms in the sample.  \n\nOur results raise the obvious question of what is the source of the investment-cash flow sensitivity? Why do companies that face difficulties in accessing external capital markets show a lower sensitivity? At the same time, why do companies facing no obvious constraint on their ability to invest exhibit a particularly high sensitivity of investment to cash flow? The remainder of the paper considers alternative explanations for these sensitivities.  \n\nWe find evidence that the high overali sensitivity of our sample (FHP's low dividend payout firms) relative to FHP's higher dividend payout firms can be explained by cash flow acting as a proxy for investment opportunities. However, this does not explain our cross-sectional results that the least constrained firms have the highest sensitivities.  \n\nWe, then, consider several plausible explanations for why the investment-cash flow sensitivity does not increase monotonically with financial constraints. We find evidence consistent with these explanations as to why the most constrained firms in our sample have the lowest sensitivities.  \n\nThe results, however, do not provide a complete understanding of why the investmentcash flow sensitivity is so high for our unconstrained firms. The high investment-cash flow sensitivities appear to be driven by managers choosing to rely primarily on internal cash flow to invest despite the availability of additional low cost funds. The most financially successful and least constrained firms in our sample appear to follow this rule and, therefore, exhibit a high investment-cash flow sensitivity. The key question -- that we cannot answer with certainty -- is whether those least constrained firms are unconstrained in an absolute sense. The answer to this question leads to very different interpretations.  \n\nIndependent of which of the altermative interpretations holds, our results have two primary implications. First, the results indicate that a greater investment-cash flow sensitivity does not provide evidence of a larger differential cost between internal and external finance. This calls into question previous work that relies on this sensitivity as evidence for the importance of financial constraints.  \n\nSecond, our results suggest that policies designed to make credit more available in recessions will not lead to increased investment by firms with the highest investment-cash flow sensitivity. These firms reduce their investment in response to poor cash flow despite the current availability of internal and external funds.  \n\nThe paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical framework. Section 3 describes the sample. Section 4 explains the criteria used to identify the extent to which firms are financially constrained. Section 5 reports the investment-cash flow regression results. Section 6 discusses the results and considers alternative explanations for them. Section 7 discusses the implications of our findings and concludes.  \n\n## Theoretical Framework  \n\n### 2.1 Competing Hypotheses  \n\nThe neoclassical theory of investment in the presence of adjustment costs (Summers, 1981 and Hayashi, 1982) derives a formal relationship between a firm's investment and the ratio of asset market value to replacement cost (better known as Tobin's Q). More importantly, the Q theory establishes that a firm's marginal Q should be the only determinant of investment. In other words, investment should not be sensitive to a firm's cash flow after controlling for marginal Q.  \n\nAs noted earlier, there is a well-established literature that indicates that investment is sensitive to cash flow even after controlling for Q. The possible explanations for this phenomenon can be divided in two groups. First, researchers have focused on the shortcomings of measured Q (which is effectively average Q) as a sufficient statistic for a firm's investment opportunities. According to this view, internal cash flow is a proxy for investment opportunities not captured by measured Q. Although investment is not truly affected by cash flow, investment will be correlated with it.  \n\nAlternatively, many researchers have questioned the strongest assumption underlying all neoclassical models: the existence of perfect capital markets. According to this second approach, a firm may find external funds either unavailable or prohibitively expensive and, in the absence of intemalfunds,reduceinvestment.  \n\nThe supply of funds to firms may be imperfect for two primary reasons: hidden information problems and agency problems. Hidden information models -- e.g., Myers and Majluf (1984) and Greenwald, Stiglitz, and Weiss (1984) -- assume that managers act in the interest of shareholders, but firms face a high cost of external funds because investors are unsure about firm quality. Firms that lack internal funds, therefore, will be unable or will find it too expensive to raise extermally the capital necessary to undertake all positive present value investments (that they would undertake if financial markets were perfect). Such financially constrained firms, therefore, underinvest.  \n\nAgency models -- e.g., Jensen and Meckling (1976), Grossman and Hart (1982), Jensen (1986), Stulz (1990), and Hart and Moore (1990) -- emphasize the conflict of interest between managers and shareholders. These models assume that managers derive private benefits from investments and, therefore, will invest more when intermal cash flow permits. As a result, unconstrained firms overinvest while constrained firms invest optimally.  \n\nBoth the hidden information and agency theories predict a “pecking order\" in financing choices: firms prefer intermal finance and if external finance is required, they issue the safest security first (Myers, 1984). Both theories, therefore, predict a higher sensitivity of investment to cash flow for financially constrained firms. These models tend to share the characteristic that more constrained firms are those that face a higher shadow cost of external funds today (although not necessarily in thefuture).  \n\nFHP was the first paper to attempt to distinguish between the mismeasured-Q theory and the imperfect capital market theories. Their innovation was to use an a priori proxy for the probability a firm is financially constrained as an instrument to sort out the effects of mismeasuredQ from the effects of imperfect capital markets. They interpret their finding of a larger sensitivity of investment to cash flow in firms a priori more likely to be financially constrained as evidence in favor of the imperfect capital market explanation.  \n\nWith the exception of Blanchard et al. (1994), the subsequent literature has followed FHP by splitting firms according to an a priori proxy for financial constraints in order to isolate th effect of imperfect capital markets. Blanchard et al. (1994) attempt to distinguish between the two imperfect capital market theories by studying a small sample of firms that received a large cash windfall-- generally a legal award -- without experiencing any change in marginal Q. Their analysis of the use of the cash windfall suggests that agency problems are more important than hidden information problems for those firms.  \n\nOur research design is structured to shed light on the extent to which the investmentcash flow sensitivity is linked to imperfections in the supply of extemal funds.  \n\n### 2.2 What Is the Definition of Financial Constraints?  \n\nIn order to determine whether a firm is financially constrained we need to define what being financially constrained means. Unfortunately, the existing literature is somewhat unclear about this point. To guide our empirical analysis we adopt the following approach.  \n\nWe define a firm as being financially constrained if the cost or availability of extemal funds precludes the company from making an investment it would have chosen to make had intemal funds been available. In other words, there is a wedge between the intemal and extemal costs of funds. Our classification scheme is designed to distinguish relative differences in the degree to which firms are financially constrained. For example, we will classify a company that is restricted by its lenders from paying dividends and increasing debt as more constrained than a company sitting on large cash reserves with no debt. In general, our unconstrained or less constrained firms are those firms with relatively large amounts of liquid assets and net worth.  \n\nAlthough our classification scheme cannot explicitly determine whether firms face a spread between the cost of intermal and extemal finance, our scheme certainly captures cross sectional differences in the magnitude of this spread. The theories of imperfect capital markets definition imply that the more financially constrained firms will exhibit greater investment-cash flowsensitivities.  \n\n## 3. Sample  \n\nIn this paper, we analyze the sample of 49 low-dividend paying firms in FHP (1988). FHP divide all manufacturing firms in the Value Line data base with uninterrupted data from 1969 to 1984 into three classes based on dividend payout policy. Their 49 Class 1 firms (which we analyze) have a dividend payout ratio of less than $10\\%$ in at least ten of the fifteen years. In contrast, FHP classify 39 firms that have a dividend payout ratio between 10% and 20% as Class 2 firms, and all 334 other firms in their sample as Class 3 firms. FHP argue that the Class 1 firms are more likely, a priori, to have been financially constrained. In their analysis, they find that the Class I firms have an investment-cash flow sensitivity that is significantly greater than that for fims that pay higher dividends.  \n\nWe choose this sample for three reasons. First, these firms exhibit a strong relation between investment and cash flow. Second, FHP argue strongly that these firms are financially constrained, most likely because of information problems. Because FHP (1988) can legitimately be considered the parent of all papers in this literature, there can be no disagreement that we have adversely selected our sample. Finally, given the high cost of our research design, the number of firms ismanageable.  \n\nWe follow this sample for the same fifteen years, 1970 to 1984, studied by FHP. For each firm, we collected data from several sources. First, we collected letters to shareholders, management discussions of operations and liquidity (when available), financial statements, and the notes to those statements from the annual report or 10-K for each firm-year. We also obtained Wall Streer Journal Index entries over the 15 year sample period.2 We obtained standard accounting variables from COMPUSTAT except those for Coleco which we obtained from Coleco's annual reports. Because FHP obtained their data from Value Line not COMPUSTAT, our data are not precisely the same as theirs.  \n\nWe measure investment or capital expenditures using COMPUSTAT item 128. We measure cash flow as the sum of earnings before extraordinary items (item 18) and depreciation (item 14). We deflate investment and cash flow by capital which we measure as net property, plant, and equipment (item 8) at the beginning of the fiscal year. This measure of capital differs slightly from the replacement cost measure employed by FHP.  \n\nWe measure average Tobin's Q as the market value of assets divided by the book value of assets (item 6) where the market value of assets equals the book value of assets plus the market value of common equity less the sum of the book value of common equity (item 60) and balance sheet deferred taxes (item 74). We calculate Q at the beginning of a firm's fiscal year.?  \n\nIn table 1, we compare the basic regression results for our sample with those reported in tabie 4 of FHP. These regressions regress investment on cash flow and Q, and control for fixed firm and year effects. Our results are qualitatively similar to those reported by FHP, although they differ slightly in some details. For each of the three time periods, our coefficients on cash flow are lower than those reported by FHP. Those differences, however, appear to be only marginally significant, if at all. At the same time, our coefficients for Q are significantly greater than those reportedbyFHP.  \n\nWe attribute the differences between our results and those of FHP to the different definitions of Q. When we exclude Q from our regressions, we obtain coefficients on cash flow that exceed those in FHP except for the 1970-75 period where our coefficient is insignificantly smaller. Because the FHP measure is constructed with an average stock price rather than an endof-year stock price, we suspect our measure of Q provides better information about investment opportunities. The FHP measure will not distinguish between a firm whose stock price declines from 20 to 10 and a firm whose stock price increases from 10 to 20 in the last quarter.  \n\n## 4 Classification Scheme  \n\n### 4.1 Description  \n\nThe SEC requires companies that are listed on a stock exchange, have more than 500 shareholders, and more than \\$5 million in assets to file an annual report or I0-K that contains the basic financial statements and their notes, as well as all material information regarding a company's business and financial condition. The annual reports are generally introduced by a letter to shareholders from the chief executive officer (CEO). This letter usually describes the major events of the previous fiscal year and the major challenges or projects planned for the year(s) ahead.  \n\nIn 1977, the SEC strengthened these reporting requirements by adopting Regulation SK, which requires firms to discuss explicitly their liquidity, capital resources, and results of operations. This section is usually titled management's discussion of operations. Item 303 of  \n\nRegulation S-K states:  \n\n(1) Liquidity. Identify any known trends or any known demands, commitments, events, or uncertainties that will result in... the registrant's liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way. If a material deficiency is identified, indicate the course of action that the registrant has taken or proposes to take to remedy the deficiency. Also identify and separately describe internal and external sources of liquidity, and briefly discuss any material unused sources of liquid assets ...  \n\n(2) Capital Resources. (l) Describe the registrant's material commitments for capital expenditures as of the end of the Iatest fiscal period, and indicate the general purpose of such commitments and the anticipated source of funds needed tofulfill such commitments ...(ii) Describe any known material trends, favorable or unfavorable in the registrant's capital resources. Indicate any expected material changes in the mix and the relativecostofsuchresources.  \n\nInstructions: 5. The term \"liquidity\" ..refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet the enterprise's needs for cash.... Liquidity shall generally be discussed on both a long-term and short-term basis.  \n\nIn short, Regulation S-K explicitly requires firms to disclose whether or not they are having difficulty in financing their investments. Consistent with the timing of the new SEC regulations, the post-1977 annual report information for our sample firms tends to be somewhat more detailed than the information for earlier years. To the extent that our classification scheme has errors, those errorsshould be smallerfor years after 1977.  \n\nWe use the qualitative information in the annual reports, together with quantitative information in the companies' financial statements and notes, to classify each firm-year into one of fivegroups.  \n\nThe first group contains firms that we deem to be definitely not financially constrained in that year. We refer to these firm-years as not financially constrained (NFC). We place a firmyear in the NFC group if the firm initiated or increased cash dividends, repurchased stock, or explicitly indicated in its annual report that the firm had more liquidity than it would need for investment in the foreseeable future.6 We also were more likely to label a firm-year NFC if the firm had a large cash position (relative to investment) or if the firm's lenders did not restrict the firm from making large dividend payments (relative to investment). NFC firm-years, therefore, tend to include financially healthy companies with low debt and high cash. In NFC firm-years, therefore, we find no evidence that these firms could not have invested appreciably more if their managers had so chosen. In NFC firm-years, NFC firms also appear to have large amounts of internal funds and collateralizable resources relative to the amount of funds required.  \n\nThe second group includes firm-years that we label likely not to be financially constrained (LNFC). In LNFC firm-years, the firms are heaithy financially and do not give any indication of being liquidity constrained. These firms also tend to have sizeable cash reserves, unused lines of credit, and healthy interest coverage. LNFC firm-years are distinguished from NFC firm-years by an absence of an explicit statement of excess liquidity and by the magnitude of the measures of liquidity. Again, in LNFC firm-years, we find no evidence that these firms could nor have invested more if their managers had so chosen. It is worth pointing out that despite the  \n\nstatement in the introduction, we classify Hewlett-Packard as LNFC for five firm-years in the 1970s.  \n\nThe third group includes firm-years we found difficult to classify either as financially constrained or as unconstrained. We call these firm-years possibly financially constrained (PFC). In PFC firm-years, firms do not report any clear signs of financial constraints, but they do not look particularly liquid either. Frequently these firms face an adverse product market environment, but are not explicitly strapped for cash. This category also includes firm-years which provide contradictory indications of their financial situation. For example, this might include a company that increases its dividend, but laments its lack of financial resources in the letter to shareholders.  \n\nThe fourth group contains all firm-years in which firms are likely to be financially constrained (LFC). This group includes firms that mention having difficulties in obtaining financing. For example, we include firm-years in which firms postpone an equity or convertible debt offering for \"adverse market conditions,\"' or claim that they need equity capital but are waiting for \"improved market conditions.\" Generally these companies are prevented from paying dividends and have little or no cash available. Companies that cut dividends also are more likely to fall in this category, unless other adverse factors assign them to the fifth group.  \n\nThe last group includes all firm-years in which firms are undoubtedly financially constrained (FC). In these firm years, these companies are in violation of debt covenants, have been cut out of their usual source of credit, are renegotiating debt payments, or declare that they are forced to reduce investments because of liquidity problems.  \n\nOverall, we are confident that our classification scheme captures relative differences in the extent to which the sample firms have access to funds in a given year. Our reading of the financial statements and management discussions strongly indicates that the NFC (and LNFC) firms could have invested more (often substantially more) in that year had they so chosen. In other words, there is no sense in which the NFC (and LNFC) firms were contemporaneously constrained. However, we recognize the possibility that even NFC (or LNFC) firms behaved as if they were constrained for fear of being constrained in the future.  \n\nOur classification scheme is subject to two potential criticisms: (l) managers may not report truthfully; and (i) we may not classify firm-years accurately. We do not view management misreporting as a serious problem for several reasons. First, managers are held liable not only for disclosing false information, but also for not disclosing material information. This is particularly true after 1977 when Regulation S-K is in effect.' Second, we read annual reports over a fifteen year period. While a firm may be able to misreport in any given firm-year, it seems unlikely that a firm can misreport every year. Third, we do not rely exclusively on the management discussions, but also read the financial statements carefully. Finally, any management reluctance to report negative information should bias our results against finding financially constrained companies and differences across groups. To the extent we find some companies to be financially constrained, we can be certain that they are indeed constrained. Similarly, to the extent we find differences across groups, we can be confident that these differences represent a lower, and not an upper, bound.  \n\n### 4.2 Classification Results  \n\nTable 2 summarizes our classification of firm-years. We classify $54.5\\%$ of firm-years as not (NFC) and $30.9\\%$ of firm-years as likely not financially constrained (LNFC) for α total of $85.3\\%$ of firm years in which we find no evidence of financial constraints that restrict investment. We classify $7.3\\%$ of firm-years as possibly constrained, $4.8\\%$ as likely constrained, and $2.6\\%$ as definitelyconstrainedfor atotal of only $14.7\\%$ years inwhich thereis some possibility of financial constraint. The fraction of firms that are at least possibly constrained, however, varies a fair amount over time, with more firms being potentially constrained in the early part of the sample (when these firms were smaller), and particularly around the 1974-75 recession. This time patterm is consistent with the results in FHP (1988) and in table I that investment-cash flow sensitivities decline over the sample period. (ln the Appendix, we report the year-by-year classifications for all 49 firms.)  \n\nWe consider the accuracy of our classification scheme by reporting quantitative measures of operational and financial health across our five classifications in Table 3. In panel A, median cash flow, net cash flow (cash flow less investment), and Tobin's Q decline monotonically across the five categories. For example, the median level of net cash flow for NFC firms is $11\\%$ of capital (net property plant and equipment) while the median level of net cash flow for FC firms is almost $-20\\%$ . This suggests that NFC firms could have increased their investment without tapping external sources of capital. The mean level of acquisitions (as a fraction of capital) is substantially higher for firms in the first two groups (NFC and LNFC) than firms in the other three groups.8 Acquisitions are completely absent in FC firm-years. Finaly, NFC and LNFC firm-years experience more sales growth than firm-years in which firms are at least potentially constrained. In FC firm-years, firms do not experience any nominal growth.  \n\nPanel B reports summary statistics on firm financial status. Interest coverage -- earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation or EBITD (COMPUSTAT item 13) to interest expense (item 15) -- declines monotonically across our classifications.\" Debt to total capital also decreases monotonically -- debt is the sum of the book value of short-term and long-term debt (items 9 and 34), while total capital is the sum of debt, the book value of preferred stock, and the book value of common equity. It is worth pointing out that the NFC firm-years have a large median interest coverage of almost 8 times while the LNFC firm-years have a median coverage of almost 6. In contrast, LFC firm-years have a median coverage of less than 3 times and FC firm-years have a median coverage that barely exceeds 1.  \n\nThe notes to the financial statements typically state whether a firm's debt covenants -- if the firm has any debt -- place any restrictions on a firm's ability to pay dividends. We interpret a firm as being more financially constrained the greater the restrictions placed on dividend payments by covenants. Table 3 reports that the fraction of firm-years in which debt covenants forbid the payment of dividends increases monotonically across our classifications. NFC firm-years are restricted $6.1\\%$ of the time while LFC and FC firms are restricted more than $68\\%$ of the time. In the majority of firm-years, the notes to financial statements also report exactly how much of retained earnings are free for dividend payments under the strictest debt covenants.' Panel B of table 3 indicates that this amount falls monotonically across our five groups. In NFC firm-years, the median amount of earnings free for dividends equals $20.8\\%$ of beginning of year capital and almost $58\\%$ of the year's investment. In other words, the median NFC firm could have paid out a dividend equal to $58\\%$ of its capital expenditures without the permission of existing lenders.  \n\nFinally, cash (COMPUSTAT item 1), unused line of credit, and slack (the sum of cash and the unused line of credit) all decline monotonically across our classifications. Slack is important because it provides a measure of the amount of funds or liquidity immediately available to a firm at year-end. Slack may overstate true liquidity somewhat because firms were commonly required to maintain compensating balances. That qualification not withstanding, the median slack in NFC firm-years is $72.5\\%$ of beginning of year capital and $191\\%$ of the year's investment. For LNFC firm-years, the analogous amounts are $42\\%$ and $119\\%$  \n\nAs an additional check, we estimate ordered logit models of the probability a firm falls in one of the five categories -- with NFC being the lowest state and FC the highest. The results are presented in table 4. The likelihood of being classified as financially constrained is significantly greater in firms with higher debt to total capital, higher Q, and for whom dividend payments are forbidden; the likelihood is significantly lower in firms with high cash flow, high cash, high dividends paid, high retained earmings free for dividends, and with any unused line of credit at all. All the coefficients are statistically significant at the $1\\%$ level, and all the coefficients except perhaps the one on Q have the expected sign. Q has a positive impact on the probability of being financially constrained. This is true despite the univariate result in table 3 that Q decreases with firm financial health. The likely explanation for this result is Q's partial correlation with cash flow. In the absence of cash flow, the coeficient on Q becomes negative. One way to interpret this result is that conditional on having a low cash flow, we classify a firm as more likely to be constrained if it has more investment opportunities (high Q).  \n\nOverall, we feel that the monotonic patterms of most of the operating and financial variables in table 3 and the results in table 4 provide a strong quantitative validation of the accuracy of our classification scheme.  \n\n### 4.3 Overall Financial Status  \n\nIn order to analyze investment-cash flow sensitivities over fifteen years, we aggregate each firm's annual financial status into an overall measure of financial status. We refer to this as sample financial status (rather than firm-year financial status). We distinguish firms that were never financially constrained from those that were. We do this to account for the likelihood that firms which become constrained will behave as if they are constrained.  \n\nOur classification provides a great deal of variation. Nineteen firms are never constrained -- they were classified as NFC or LNFC in all 15 sample years. These firms never showed any sign of being financially constrained over the entire period. Eight firms are possibly constrained. These firms were possibly constrained in at least one year and not constrained (NFC or LN FC) in all the rest. Finally, 22 firms are likely constrained. These firms were classified as LFC or FC in at least one sample year.  \n\nWe also aggregate annual financial status into overall status over two sub-periods: 1970 to 1977 and 1978 to 1984. We classify firms according to whether they were likely constrained, possibly constrained, or not constrained within each sub-period. We do this for four reasons. First, the classification over the entire sample period will classify a firm as financially constrained even if that firm was constrained in only one of the fifteen sample years. By measuring financial status over sub-periods, we increase the precision of our classifications. Second, the research  \n\ndesign in FHP biases the sample toward companies that were small in 1970, but were established enough by 1984 to be included in the Value Line data set. Therefore, a firm in the earlier part of the sample is conceivably different from the same firm later on. Third, as noted earlier, the information contained in the management discussions and footnotes of annual reports improves after 1977. Therefore, we believe that the possibility that we have misclassified firms in the second sub-period declines substantially. Finally, as noted earlier, FHP (1988) report that the sensitivity of investment to cash flow is particularly strong in the first half of the sample, when these firms were smaller and more likely to have been financially constrained.  \n\n## 5. Regression Results  \n\nArmed with a direct measure of a firm's financially constrained status, we can now test if financing constraints explain cross sectional differences in investment-cash flow sensitivities.  \n\n### 5.1. Basic Specification  \n\nWe estimate regressions for all firms and by firm sample financial status. We use the regression specifications presented in table 1 over the entire sample period. Table 5 presents our basic results. Firms classified as never constrained (NFC or LNFC in every sample year) exhibit the highest investment-cash flow sensitivity (0.702), exceeding that for the entire sample (0.395), for firms that were likely constrained (0.340), and for firms that were possibly constrained (0.180). The coefficient for the never constrained firms is economically and statistically greater than the coefficients for the other firms.  \n\nAs we noted earlier, we are not entirely comfortable with the classification of possibly constrained firms. If managers tend to under-report negative information about their firm's financial condition, then it would be appropriate to group the eight possibly constrained firms with the likely constrained firms. Not surprisingly, this grouping lowers the coefficient on constrained firms to 0.250, and widens the gap between constrained firms and unconstrained firms. It is worth pointing out that the 0.25 sensitivity is insignificantly different from that of the high-dividend FHP class 3 firms and actually smaller than that of the FHP class 2 firms.  \n\nAlternatively, it is possible that we have been excessively conservative and have classified firms as possibly constrained when they were, in fact, unconstrained. Accordingly, we also estimate a regression in which we group the possibly constrained firms with the never constrained firms. While this lowers the investment-cash flow sensitivity substantially (to 0.439), it does not alter the basic result that unconstrained firms exhibit a greater investment-cash flow sensitivity.  \n\nIn tables 6 and 7, we repeat our basic analysis, but break the sample into two subperiods: 1970 to 1977 and 1978 to 1984. Table 6 treats a firm in the 1970 -1977 sub-period as different from the same firm in the 1978-1984 sub-period. The regressions presented in table 6, therefore, include 98 firm-sub-periods (with firm-sub-period fixed effects). Again, the coefficients sharply reject the hypothesis that financially constrained firms have greater investment-cash flow sensitivities. In table 6, firms that are not constrained in a sub-period have an investment-cash sensitivity of 0.680. This is significantly greater than the sensitivity of 0.436 for all firm subperiods and greater than the sensitivity of firms that are possibly constrained (at 0.259) or likely constrained (at 0.274).  \n\nTable 6 also presents regression results for the fifteen firm-sub-periods for which we classify the firm as NFC in every year in the sub-period.il Ten of the fifteen sub-periods fall in the 1978-1984 period during which even FHP argue the sample firms were less likely to be constrained. Strikingly, the investment-cash flow sensitivity for these fifteen sub-periods of 0.779 exceeds any of the coefficienis for any group of firms we present in tables 5 and 6.  \n\nBased on our classification scheme and the quantitative support for that scheme in tables 3 and 4, we find it impossible to argue that these firms were unable to invest more during any of these 15 sub-periods. We also find it difficult to argue that these firms faced a particularly high cost of external finance. Hewlett-Packard, for example, is included among these 15 sub  \n\nperiods in 1978-1984 (although not in 1970-1977). And Hewlett-Packard has an investment-cash flow sensitivity of 0.97 over the 1978-1984 sub-period, 0.92 over the 1970-1977 sub-period, and 1.15 over the entire sample period. It is worth stressing that the 15 firms that are NFC in every sub-period year have financial characteristics that are similar to those of FHP's Class 3 firms that pay high dividends and have a low investment-cash flow sensitivity (0.23) For example, the NFC firms and FHP's Class 3 firms have interest coverage ratios that are economically and statistically indistinguishable. It seems difficult to understand how one set of firms can be constrained while the other is not.  \n\nTable 7 presents results for each of the two sub-periods separately. Again, we find no evidence that financial constraints explain the sensitivity of investment to cash flow. In both subperiods, the firms that we classify as NFC every year and as never constrained have a significantly higher investment-cash flow sensitivity than the other groups of firms. Furthermore, in the 1978- 1984 period where we are more certain of our classifications, the sensitivity declines monotonicaily with the extent to which we classify firms as constrained.  \n\n### 5.2. Alternative Definitions of Financially Constrained Status  \n\nGiven the results in the previous section, some readers may be concerned that we have misclassified firms by using qualitative data or by basing firm financial status on an overly long -- seven to fifteen year -- period. To address these concerms, we report the results of grouping firms basedonquantitative $\\prime$ objective data and based on annual financial status.  \n\nIn regressions (1) - (3) of table 8, we present estimates of the investment-cash flow sensitivities for (I) the $25\\%$ of sample firms whose interest coverage never drops below 2.5 and (ii) firms whose dividends are never restricted over the entire sample period. Given the two severe recessions over the sample period, these criteria should identify firms that were relatively financially healthy. The investment-cash flow sensitivity for the 13 firms whose coverage never drops below 2.5 is significantly greater at 0.673 than the sensitivity of 0.395 for the entire sample. The investment-cash flow sensitivity for the 17 firms whose dividends are never restricted at 0.435 also exceeds the sensitivity for the entire sample, although not significantly.  \n\nIn regressions (4) - (6), we split the sample into sub-periods as we did in table 6. We present estimates of the investment-cash flow sensitivities for (l) the $25\\%$ offirm-sub-periods whose interest coverage never drops below 4.5 in the sub-period; and (i) firms whose dividends are never restricted over the sub-period. The patterns are qualitatively similar and quantitatively stronger than those for the entire sample period. The investment-cash flow sensitivity for the 21 firms whose coverage never drops below 4.5 in a sub-period is a remarkably high 0.801. We should point out that the median interest coverage for firms rated BBB by Standard & Poor's in 1979-1981 was 3.82; the median for firms rated A was 6.56. In other words, these firms are not likely to have faced particularly high costs of external finance in absolute terms in the sub-periods. More importantly, in relative terms, it is virtually certain that they faced lower costs of extermal finance than the other firms in our sample, and, yet, show a higher investment-cash flow sensitivity.  \n\nIn table 9, we present differential estimates of the investment-cash flow sensitivities by interacting cash flow with annual measures of financial constraint status.'? First, we interact cash flow with dummy variables for our annual classifications of financial constraint status. The base or uninteracted coefficient corresponds to the NFC firm-years -- firm-years we classify as not financially constrained. The regression in column (1) interacts the end-of-the-year classification while the regression in column (2) interacts the beginning-of-year classification with that year's cash flow. We report both because we classify firms using the end-of-year financial statements. The results are, again, qualitatively identical to the results in the previous sections. The investment-cash flow sensitivity declines with our qualitative measure of financial constraint. In regression (3), we interact cash flow with a dummy variable that equals one if debt covenants restrict the firm from paying dividends in a firm-year. It seems reasonable to assume that such firms are more financially constrained than firms not restricted from paying dividends.  \n\nAgain, we find that the investment-cash flow sensitivity is significantly lower, not higher, for firms restricted from paying dividends. We obtain virtually identical results (which, therefore, we do not report) when we use the lagged value of the dummy variable.  \n\nFinally, in regression (4) we interact cash flow with a dummy variable that equals one for firm-years in which our slack variable -- the sum of cash and unused lines of credit as a fraction of capital -- is in the lowest quartile of firm-years. The low slack cutoff is $28\\%$ ofbeginning-ofyear capital (net property, plant, and equipment). Our results are not sensitive to this cutoff. It seems reasonable to assume that firms with less slack are more financially constrained than firms with more slack. Again, we find that the investment-cash flow sensitivity is lower, not higher, for firms with low slack. Again, we obtain virtually identical results when we use the lagged value of thedummyvariable.  \n\nOverall, then, we observe the same pattern as in the previous section using quantitative measures of financial constraints and using our qualitative measure of financial constraints over shorterperiods.  \n\n### 5.3. Alternative Specifications.  \n\nWe considered, but do not report, a number of alternative specifications of our basic regressions. (l) We removed Q as an independent variable leaving cash flow as the only independent variable. (2) We added the ratio of sales to capital as an independent variable with Q and cash flow to capital. (3) We included two lags of cash flow and Q as independent variables. (4) To reduce the influence of outliers, we: (I) winsorized investment, cash flow, and Q; (i) deflated investment and cash flow by total assets rather than capital; and (i) eliminated observations with negative cash flow. (5) We ran regressions for each firm individually. (6) We checked whether the results hold if we exclude any particular firm from the sample. Our results are qualitatively and statistically identical under all of these alternatives.  \n\n## 6. Discussion of the results.  \n\nOur results indicate that a high sensitivity of investment to cash flow is not associated with financially constrained firms. This contrasts with the results in FHP (1988) and many subsequent papers. Firms that appear less constrained exhibit a higher sensitivity than those that manifest clear signs of being constrained. Given the controversial nature of our findings, it is important to explore whether our results capture general features of the relationship between corporate investment and cash flow or, instead, are specific to the sample or the techniques we use  \n\n### 6.1. Mismeasurement of financial constraint status?  \n\nThe simplest (and easiest to dismiss) explanation of our results is that we rely on highly subjective or arbitrary indicators of financial constraints, while the rest of the literature uses more objective criteria. We regard this criticism as totally unfounded for at least three reasons.  \n\nFirst, we obtain qualitatively similar results using a series of objective criteria, like minimum coverage and amount of earnings unrestricted for dividends.  \n\nSecond, our relative ranking is not at all arbitrary. There is no doubt that a firm like Hewlett Packard (see quote at the beginning of the paper) is less constrained than a firm like Cordis in 1975:  \n\n\"ln order to conserve capital, construction in the proposed plant in Miami Lakes was suspended in December. It is anticipated that work will resume as soon as suitable financing is available.\"1975 Annual Report.  \n\nMoreover, all the quantitative indicators reported in Table 3 support our classification scheme.  \n\nFinally, the theoretical foundations for some of the criteria used in previous work are arguably more arbitrary than our classification scheme. The most popular criterion (FHP, Bond and Meghir [1994], Calomiris and Hubbard [1995], and Kashyap, Hubbard and Withed [1995]) is based on dividend payout. Unfortunately, corporate finance theory suggests that firms should not pay any dividends at all in the presence of taxes. Furthermore, most of the existing theories of why dividends are paid (Bhattacharya [1979], Miller and Rock [1985]), explain their temporal pattern, but are silent on their average level. Although it is reasonable to assume that firms that pay more dividends are less likely to be constrained, at the current stage of the theoretical literature this assumption isdebatable.  \n\n### 6.2. Mismeasurement of investment?  \n\nAlthough we use the definition of investment that is standard in the literature (COMPUSTAT variable 128), it is possible that this definition is incorrect. For example, a number of the firms in our sample have large research and development programs, and a few of the sample firms make acquisitions (although FHP note that they eliminated firms from their sample that made largeacquisitions).  \n\nWe account for these possibilities by estimating our basic regressions in four different ways. First, we use a different definition of capital expenditures -- COMPUSTAT variable 30 -- that includes increases in property, plant, and equipment from acquisitions that use purchase accounting. Second, we calculate investment as the change in net property, plant, and equipment Third, we calculate investment as the change in net property, plant, and equipment adding back depreciation. Fourth, we define investment as the sum of capital expenditures and research and development. All four adjustments yield results that are qualitatively and statistically identical to ourbasicresults.  \n\nIn conclusion, there is little doubt that the less constrained firms in our sample have a higher investment-cash flow sensitivity. We have established, therefore, that it is inappropriate in our sample to use a differential investment-cash flow sensitivity as evidence that a firm or group of firms is financially constrained. The question, then, becomes how general this result is.  \n\n### 6.3. Cash flow as a proxy for investment opportunities?  \n\nA different explanation for our results is that our sorting criterion is correlated with the mismeasurement of Q. This criticism is not specific to our paper, but was in fact first raised in the discussion of FHP by Poterba (1988) and explored further in Gilchrist and Himmelberg (1994). Splitting a sample to disentangle the effects of mismeasurement of Q from the effects of liquidity constraints is valid only if the sorting criterion is correlated with the true unobservable variable (financial constraint status), but uncorrelated with the error (the extent to which cash flow is a proxy for the mismeasurement of Q). This, of course, is the standard requirement for a valid instrumental variable. We believe our research design is less subject to this criticism because our classification scheme, based on direct observation, will more accurately measure the unobservable variable. Nevertheless, it is important to explore this issue empirically.  \n\nOne strategy to reduce the potential spurious correlation induced by mismeasurement of Q consists of eliminating the observations that have the most extreme growth in sales or investment. There are two reasons why the mismeasurement problem might be correlated with a firm's growth rate. First, evidence from the accounting literature is consistent with the informational content of earnings differing across companies. In particular, earnings (and correspondingly cash flow) convey more information for young, growing companies, than for large and established ones. (See Collins and Kothari [1989].)  \n\nSecond, the papers in this literature typically deflate all the variables by the value of capital (net property, plant, and equipment) at the beginning of the fiscal year. This method provides consistent estimates if all variables are recorded at short intervals or if there is no growth. In practice, however, neither of the two assumptions is satisfied. Variables are recorded at annual intervals and companies grow substantially over the sample period -- a median of $18\\%$ peryearfor our sample. If both investment and cash flow grow at a rate similar to the growth rate of sales, then part of the co-movement of investment and cash flow may be due to a scale factor. This effect would bias the estimates of the investment-cash flow sensitivity toward one, particularly in firms with higher annual growth rates.  \n\nTo account for this possibility, we estimate regressions that eliminate or downweight observations with high growth rates. The first four columns of table 10 report the results of regressions that exclude firm-years with more than $30\\%$ sales growth (the upper quartile).When we eliminate these observations, the median rate of sales growth for the constrained, possibly constrained, and not constrained firms is essentially equal (between $11\\%$ and $12\\%$ ).The  \n\ninvestment cash-flow sensitivities decline substantially. Nevertheless, the patterm across the three groups of firms remains qualitatively the same, and the difference in sensitivities is still statistically significant. The second four columns of table 10 report qualitatively similar results when we eliminate firm-years in which net property, plant, and equipment more than doubled.'3β Finally, we obtain qualitatively and statistically similar results (in unreported regressions) when we apply a robust estimation technique that downweights outliers.'4  \n\nThese results indicate that FHP's overall finding (across dividend payout classes) are at least partially driven by extreme observations. Eliminating or downweighting the high growth firm-years reduces the estimated investment cash flow sensitivity of the entire low dividend payout sample to between 0.20 and 0.25. This is effectively identical to the estimate of 0.23 obtained by FHP for their unconstrained, high payout firms. These are the observations for which cash flow is more likely to be correlated with the mismeasurement of Q. This, in turn, implies that other studies that sort firms into subsamples with differential outliers in growth rates -- for example, splits on size and dividend payout ratios -- may be biased toward finding a difference in coefficients on cash flow.  \n\nIn contrast, the high growth firm-years do not explain the cross-sectional results we obtain.  \n\n### 6.4. Euler equation techniques?  \n\nOne additional way to address the mismeasurement of Q is to use the Euler equation approach. See Whited (1992), Bond and Meghir (1994), and Hubbard, Kashyap and Whited (1995). This approach directly tests the first order conditions of an intertemporal maximization problem and, thus, does not require the measurement of Q. It is typically implemented by imposing an exogenous constraint on external finance and testing whether that constraint is binding for a particular group of firms.  \n\nThe Euler equation tests tend to detect the presence of financial constraints in the same type of low dividend firms we study. This is puzzling given our finding that most of the low dividend firms have access to internal or external finance and, therefore, do not face an explicit limit or constraint.Nevertheless, we explore the robustness of our results to the Euler equation tests by following the approach used by Bond and Meghir (1994) who explicitly model the wedge between internal and external finance. Their empirical implementation involves regressing investment on lagged investment and its square, sales, cash flow, and debt squared, and testing whether the coefficient on cash flow is different across firms with different dividend policies. When we implement this approach, we obtain qualitatively identical results to those from our basic specification. Contrary to the results in Bond and Meghir, the firms we identify as least constrained exhibit the highest coefficients.  \n\n### 6.5. The sensitivity does not increase monotonically with financial constraints?  \n\nOur results raise serious doubts about the ability of the most widely used splitting criteria to properly distinguish between the informational content of cash flow and its effect in alleviating financial constraints. The question remains whether other more sophisticated splitting criteria can do so. The ability of any such criterion to do so, however, relies upon the assumption - - implict in most of the existing empirical literature -- that the investment-cash flow sensitivity increases monotonically with financial constraints.  \n\nAlthough typically ignored, there are at least three reasons why firms that are more constrained might exhibit particularly low sensitivities making the relationship non-monotonic. First, the sensitivities will not be monotonic if (l) our financially constrained firms are, in fact, financially distressed; and (i) our financially unconstrained firms are, in fact, constrained. Second, an intertemporal model that incorporates a form of precautionary savings can generate such a  \n\npattern. Finally, a non-monotonic pattern of sensitivities will arise if the costs of modifying planned capital expenditures in response to a cash flow shock are high. In what follows, we explore whether any of these can explain our cross-sectional results.  \n\nBefore proceeding, however, we should stress that the first of these alternatives has different implications from the other two. If the non-monotonicity is limited to financially distressed firms, it is potentially legitimate to use the investment-cash flow sensitivity as a measure of financial constraints provided that financially distressed firms are eliminated from the sample. In the other two cases, the problem is much more pervasive and, therefore, much more difficult, if not impossible to overcome.  \n\n#### 6.5.1.Financially constrained equals financially distressed?  \n\nIt is plausible that financially distressed firms will exhibit low investment-cash flow sensitivities. For example, an insolvent firm might be forced by its creditors to use additional cash flow to repay debt rather than for capital expenditures. This necessarily will reduce the sensitivity of investment to cash flow. This would explain our results if the firms we classify as constrained and possibly constrained are, in fact, financially distressed, and the firms we classify as unconstrained are, in fact, constrained.  \n\nTables 3 and 11 refute this argument. Table 3 presents firm characteristics by firm-year financial status; table 11 presents firm characteristics by overall sample financial status. First, the bottom of table 3 indicates that firms increase their debt, rather than repay it in the years we classify them as possibly, likely, or definitely constrained. Second, although one might argue that the definitely constrained firm-years are distressed (median interest coverage of I.09), table 3 shows that it is probably not the case for the likely constrained firm-years (median interest coverage of 2.84) and definitely not the case for the possibly constrained firm-years (median interest coverage of 4.20). Third, table 11 shows that over the entire sample period, firms we classify as possibly constrained are approximately as healthy as firms we classify as never constrained. Finally, it is unreasonable to describe the likely constrained firms as distressed over the entire sample period (median interest coverage of 4.84), despite the fact that they are less healthy overall than the other two groups. In fact, FHP intended to eliminate distressed firms because they explicitly excluded firms with overall negative real sales growth from their sample.  \n\n#### 6.5.2. Intertemporal constraints versus contemporaneous constraints?  \n\nAlthough it is understood in theory that an intertemporal model can generate nonmonotonic investment-cash flow sensitivities, most empirical implementations have ignored this possibility. According to such a model, when firms that are very constrained generate additional cash flow, they may decide to hoard it for precautionary reasons rather than invest it. When firms are constrained, but have less urgent precautionary needs, they channel most of the additional cash flow to investment. Finally, when firms are totally unconstrained, investment will be unresponsive to additional cashflow.  \n\nGross (1995) presents a model which generates this behavior. His simulations indicate that the investment-cash flow sensitivity will decrease as firms become less constrained except for firms that are the most financially distressed. Because the simulations and sensitivities reflect firm. years, the same firm can be in different circumstances over time with very different sensitivities fromyear toyear.  \n\nAlthough we think that the intertemporal model has some strong positives and should be given more attention in future empirical work, there are several ways in which the intertemporal model is not consistent with our results. First, the intertemporal model implies that completely unconstrained firm-years will show a sensitivity that is close to zero. In contrast, the sensitivity for our least constrained (NFC) firm-years in regression (1) of table 9 is approximately 0.40. This is difficult to reconcile with the fact that the NFC firm-years appear as healthy financially as the unconstrained firms in FHP which show a low sensitivity.  \n\nSecond, regression (2) in tabie 9 indicates that the investment cash flow sensitivities of firms that were likely constrained or constrained in the previous year are essentially zero. This is surprising given that cash flow recovers substantially -- from 0.24 to 0.34 (of beginning of year capital) for likely constrained firms and from -0.20 to 0.26 for constrained firms. In other words, firms that were constrained in the previous year are much less constrained in the following year, yet have low investment-cash flow sensitivities.  \n\nFinally, our basic results for overall financial constraint status seem at odds with Gross' intertemporal model. The intertemporal model implies that the overall sensitivities will be weighted averages of the firm-year sensitivities. The overall sensitivity of the possibly constrained firms, therefore, should roughly equal that of the unconstrained firms because the results in table 5 classify firms as possibly constrained even if those firms were unconstrained over most of the sampleperiod.  \n\n#### 6.5.3. Anadjustment-costexplanation.  \n\nA final reason why the investment-cash flow sensitivity might be a misleading indicator of financial constraints is that it ignores a firm's cost of modifying planned capital expenditures in response to a cash flow shock. For example, when a firm experiences a cash flow drop and becomes constrained, it may be unable to reduce capital expenditures immediately to the new desired level if adjustment costs are high. For instance, this would be the case for a firm that was in the middle of building a new factory. If the cash flow of that constrained firm then rebounds, the firm will increase investment, but by less than it would have if it had not been forced to continue investing when it was constrained -- i.e., completing the factory. This pattern will reduce the measured investment-cash flow sensitivity for constrained firms. Firms that are never constrained will neverfindthemselvesinthissituation.  \n\nConsistent with this explanation, firms invest a median of 236% of their cash flow in capital expenditures in constrained and likely constrained firm-years; in the following firm-years, the same firms invest a median of $106\\%$ .In contrast, in not constrained and likely not constrained firm-years, firms invest a median of $82\\%$ of their cash flow in capital expenditures; in the following year, the same firms invest a median of $84\\%$  \n\nThe possibly constrained firm-years, however, are problematic. Possibly constrained firm-years fall in between, with firms investing a median of $124\\%$ of their cashflow incapital expenditures; in the following year, the same firms invest a median of $98\\%$ It isdifficult to reconcile this patterm with the fact that we find the lowest investment-cash flow sensitivity for firms classified as possibly constrained over the entire period.  \n\nAlthough the last two arguments -- that the investment-cash flow sensitivity does not increase monotonically with financial constraints -- do not completely explain our cross-sectional results, they make some progress in doing so. There is no reason to believe that these arguments are specific to our sample. They cast additional doubt, therefore, on the use of the investment-cash flow sensitivity as evidence of financial constraints in any sample.  \n\n## 7. Implications and conclusions.  \n\nOur findings have several implications:  \n\nFirst, the results indicate that a greater sensitivity of investment to cash flow does not provide reliable evidence of a larger differential cost between internal and extermal finance. Sorting by dividend payout ratios has the effect of grouping together firms in very different financial positions.' In our low dividend payout sample, we find that it is the least constrained firms that exhibit the highest investment-cash flow sensitivity and drive the differences in sensitivity across groups. The differential sensitivities appear to be partially driven by differences in growth rates across groups. We suspect this problem is particularly acute in those papers that use size or the dividend payout ratio as a sorting criterion. Even controlling for differences in the extent to which cash flow proxies for investment opportunities, our findings cast doubts on the monotonicity of the investment-cash flow sensitivity with financial constraints. Both of these findings, call into question previous work that uses differential sensitivities across groups to  \n\n### identify the presence of financial constraints.  \n\nSecond, while we think that some combination of the adjustment cost and intertemporal models can explain why our constrained firms have a low investment-cash flow sensitivity, we do not have a complete understanding of why the investment-cash flow sensitivity is so high for our unconstrained firms. Even when we eliminate observations where cash flow is most likely to proxy for investment opportunities, we still find that unconstrained firms have a high sensitivity.  \n\nThe high investment-cash flow sensitivities appear to be driven by managers choosing to rely primarily on intemal cash flow to invest despite the availability of additional low cost funds. The most financially successful and least constrained firms in our sample appear to follow this rule and, therefore, exhibit a high investment-cash flow sensitivity. The key question -- that we cannot answer with certainty -- is whether those least constrained firms are unconstrained in an absolute sense. The answer to this question leads to very different interpretations of this result.  \n\nIf our least constrained firms are, indeed, unconstrained in an absolute sense, their investment / financing policies can be interpreted as the irrational or overly risk averse choices of self-interested managers. They also can be interpreted as the outcome of a behavioral rule in which some firms invest only when they are generating cash. A firm might follow such a rule if its managers are overly thrifty,“depression babies,” who will invest only under such favorable circumstances.  \n\nAltermatively, if the least constrained firms are constrained in some intertemporal sense, then their investment / financing policies can be interpreted as the value maximizing choice of managers based on the potential costs of becoming financially constrained in the future. Note, however, this interpretation implies that some firms that choose conservative financial policies - low debt with high cash balances -- and appear contemporaneously unconstrained are, in fact, at least as constrained as firms that do not. Accepting such a qualification further calls into question those studies that use a priori criteria based on financial policies to identify financially constrained firms.  \n\nIt seems important that future work attempt to distinguish among these explanations because of their disparate policy implications for institutional and incentive design. For example, if the source of self-restraint is the optimal response to the possibility of future constraints, then the constant presence of financial intermediaries that can alleviate future information problems would reduce this sensitivity.Altematively, if the source of self-restraint is excessive risk aversion or a behavioral rule, then the sensitivity can potentially be reduced by changes in management compensationschemes.  \n\nThird, independent of which of these explanations hold, our results suggest that policies designed to make credit more available in recessions will not lead to increased investment by firms with the highest investment-cash flow sensitivity. These firms reduce their investment in response to poor cash flow despite the current availability of internal and external funds.  \n\nThe fourth and final implication of our paper is a methodological one. Our research design and results point out what we think is a weakness in existing research as well as an opportunity for future research. A great deal can be learned through more direct observation.  \n\n## References  \n\nAfterman, Allan and Bruce Willis, 1991, Handbook of SEC Accounting and Disclosure, (New York: Warren, Gorham, & Lamont.)   \nBemanke, Benjamin, Mark Gertler, and Simon Gilchrist, forthcoming, \"The Financial Accelerato and The Flight to Quality,\" Review of Economics and Statistics.   \nBhattacharya, Sudipto, 1979,“Imperect information, dividend policy, and \\*The bird in the hand’ fallacy,\" Bell Joumal of Economics, Spring, 259-270.   \nBlanchard, Olivier, Florencio Lopez-de-Silanes, and Andrei Shleifer, 1994, “What Do Firms Do With Cash Windfalls?\" Joumal of Financial Economics.   \nBond, Stephen and Costas Meghir, 1994, \"Dynamic Investment Models and the Firm's Financial Policy.\" Review of Economic Studies 61, 197-222.   \nCalomiris, Charles, and Glenn Hubbard, forthcoming, “Intemal Finance and Investment: Evidenc from the Undistributed Profits Tax of 1936-1937,\"' Joumal of Business.   \nCollins, Daniel and S.P.

The labor share of the typical U.S. manufacturing establishment, in contrast, rose by over 3 ppts during the same period. Using micro-level data, we document five salient facts: (1) since the 1980s, there has been a dramatic reallocation of value added toward the lower end of the labor share distribution; (2) this aggregate reallocation is not due to entry/exit, to “superstars\" growing faster or to large establishments lowering their labor shares, but is instead due to units whose labor share fell as they grew in size; (3) low labor share (LL) establishments benefit from high revenue labor productivity, not low wages; (4) they also enjoy a product price premium relative to their peers, pointing to a significant role for demand-side forces; and (5) they have only temporarily lower labor shares that rebound after five to eight years. This transient pattern has become more pronounced over time, and the dynamics of value added and employment are increasingly disconnected.  \n\nMatthias Kehrig   \nDepartment of Economics   \nDuke University   \n237 Social Sciences, Box 90097   \nDurham, NC 27708   \nand NBER   \nmatthias.kehrig @ duke.edu   \nNicolas Vincent   \nHEC Montreal   \nInstitute of Applied Economics   \n3000, chemin de la Cote-Sainte-Catherine   \nMontréal (Québec), H3T 2A7   \nCanada   \nnicolas.vincent@hec.ca  \n\n## 1 Introduction  \n\nSeveral recent studies have documented a decline of the aggregate labor share, the portion of gross domestic product paid out in compensation for labor. This finding is important for several reasons. For one, it contradicts one of the stylized facts of Kaldor (1961) that have become foundational for economic growth theories. It is further at odds with a key building block of standard macroeconomic models, the Cobb-Douglas production function. Last, the finding suggests that an economy's value added gets distributed less to those who produce that value added and more to those that own the means of production.  \n\nNumerous explanations have been suggested to explain this aggregate decline, most of which are rooted in firm-level behavior, yet little is known about the dynamics at the micro level and which structural drivers and shocks are consistent with the empirical picture. This paper fills this gap. It studies the micro-level anatomy of labor shares and factor reallocation, which may serve as a basis for future modeling work. We first present a conceptual framework that encompasses three of the leading theories that have been proposed in the literature: demand/pricing factors, total factor productivity (TFP)/effciency channels and market power in labor markets. We then use confidential data from the U.S. Census of Manufactures (CMF) to study the establishmentand firm-level anatomy of labor shares, with the aim of identifying those theories consistent with the empirical evidence. Based on our empirical work, we argue that only demand factors are capable of explaining both the micro anatomy of labor shares and factor allocations as well as the manufacturing labor share decline.  \n\nWe document a number of salient facts. First, we confirm that the labor share in the manufacturing sector declines by almost 5 percentage points (ppts) per decade between 1967 and 2012. This decline, however, hides contrasting dynamics at the micro level: alongside the sectoral decline, the median establishment saw an increase in its labor share, by about 0.7 ppts per decade. In fact, this upward trend is present for the vast majority of manufacturing establishments. We find that the decline of the manufacturing labor share is entirely driven by a strong reallocation of value added toward the low end of the labor share distribution (see Figure 1). In other words, the covariance between establishment labor shares and establishment value-added weights turned sharply negative over time. In contrast, the reallocation of labor was much less pronounced over the same period.  \n\nSecond, we show that this reallocation was not driven by entry and exit, by large establishments lowering their labor shares over time, nor by superstars with initially low labor shares increasing their market share. Instead, we establish that the strong reallocation was driven by units whose labor shares fell at the same time as they grew in size.  \n\nThird, focusing on the components of labor shares, we show that cross-sectional differences are almost entirely driven by value added per worker, not wages. We then focus on establishments in the bottom quintile of the labor share distribution in a specific year and industry, which we define as low laborshare $(L L)$ establishments. We find that the labor share dynamics of $L L$ establishments are shaped by value added, with very little accounted for by employment or wages.  \n\nFourth, we find that low labor share establishments tend to have, on average, significantly higher prices than their peers. Moreover, price dynamics are first order in understanding the dynamics of sales per worker for $L L$ establishments. We reach this conclusion by using a subsample of the census database that provides information about the value of sales and physical quantity for individual products. Doing this allows us to derive the contribution of the “product price premium\" (an establishment's deviation from the average price of its competitors) to differences in sales per worker across establishments and over time.  \n\n![](images/79885e7691623f5d069863ae6a291fc5d37d6a2ebf45cec3a34096c683aacdaf.jpg)  \nFigure 1: The Changing Distributions of Labor Shares and Value Added   \nNote: The solid black line (right axis) refects the raw cross-establishment distribution of labor shares, while the distribution of value added is represented by the gray bars (left axis). The labor share on the x-axis is expressed as adecimal.  \n\nFifth, we find that labor share fuctuations at the establishment level are surprisingly transient: the probability that a typical $L L$ establishment today loses its $L L$ status five years from now is close to $60\\%$ . This number would be close to $0\\%$ if $L L$ establishments had permanently low labor shares. Even more surprisingly, we document that the labor share dynamics of $L L$ establishments follow a V-shaped pattern over time: the drop in labor share they experience in the five years preceding $L L$ status is almost equal to the rebound in the following five years. In that sense, $L L$ establishments are more like “shooting stars\" than “superstars.\"  \n\nWe complete our empirical analysis by highlighting the evolution of two central features of the micro-level anatomy of the labor share. We first show that the V-shaped labor share pattern described earlier has become more pronounced over time. Moreover, we document that employment has become increasingly disconnected from variations in value added.  \n\nThese findings, which hold if we instead use frm-level data, have important implications for our understanding of the drivers of labor share dynamics. In the context of our conceptual framework, they make a strong case for a significant role played by demand factors: technology shocks would counterfactually predict that prices drop with labor shares, while monopsony power in labor markets would imply a counterfactual relationship between wages and labor shares. These demand factors could take many forms. For example, they may be driven by strong, but ephemeral, brand appeal or by fads for superstar products. Alternatively, frms could spur higher demand for their products through advertising campaigns, which may have become farther-reaching and more effective with the advent of online marketing and the overall growth of market scope. Such developments would be compatible with our evidence pointing to an increase in the volatility of the demand factors that underlie the micro-level dynamics of the labor share.  \n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses how our paper fits in the recent labor share literature. Section 3 presents a simple conceptual framework to guide the interpretation of the empirical findings from Sections 4 and 5. Section 6 concludes.  \n\n## 2 Relation to the Literature  \n\nA burgeoning literature has documented and come up with different explanations for the labor share decline. One set of explanations involves technical change. Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014a) puts forward the notion that technical change embodied in new equipment capital has displaced labor and has lowered the labor share. Eden and Gaggl (2018) and Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018) refine this theory by focusing on information and communication technology capital or robots, respectively. Koh, Santaeulalia-Llopis, and Zheng (2019) emphasize the rise of intangible capital, such as intellectual property products, research and development and knowledge capital, in the production function of developed economies. A common ingredient in the argument of these papers is that the elasticity of substitution between equipment or intangible capital and (routine) labor has to be greater than unity. Some empirical work by Lawrence (2015) and Oberfield and Raval (2014) casts doubt on that, even at high levels of aggregation. But even if capital and labor are complements, Grossman, Helpman, Oberfield, and Sampson (2017) show that slowing growth in labor- or capital-augmenting technological change can lead to a labor share decline. AlvarezCuadrado, Long, and Poschke (2018) show that industry-level specificities in technological change and the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor matter for the dynamics of industry-level factor shares.  \n\nAlternatively, Bockerman and Maliranta (2012) present evidence that exposure to international trade is related to the labor share decline in Finland. Elsby, Hobijn, and Sahin (2013) advocate the role of offshoring as an important driver of the labor share decline in the United States. In related work, Boehm, Flaaen, and Pandalai-Nayar (2015) present establishment-level evidence that outsourcing did cut U.S. manufacturing employment while raising the profits per worker of surviving production units. Glover and Short (2018) find the workforce's age composition has shifted toward workers who are less capable of extracting their marginal product of labor as a wage. Kaymak and Schott (2018) document a relationship between cuts in corporate tax rates and labor share declines in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries.  \n\nFurman and Orszag (2015) notes that the distribution of capital returns—-inversely related to the labor share—had shifted up and became more skewed toward high-return firms. HartmanGlaser, Lustig, and Zhang (2019) study Compustat data and find a similar dichotomy between the aggregate and average capital share that we find in the labor share data. They explain the rise in the aggregate capital share through increasingly risky firm productivity. In their model, more volatile productivity implies that the firm's owner can ask for a larger insurance premium, in turn raising the capital share. This is consistent with the finding in Kehrig (2011) that the productivity dispersion across establishments has increased significantly. From the perspective of individual workers, this widening would also pose an increased risk that requires more ex ante insurance.  \n\nLast, an emerging strand of the labor share literature emphasizes the role of rising concentration and markups. Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson, and Van Reenen (2017, forthcoming), for example, present some industry- and firm-level evidence on concentration shares, which is consistent with our finding that a small fraction of superstar establishments are mainly responsible for the manufacturing labor share decline. Grullon, Larkin, and Michaely (2016) use frm-level data from Compustat to document that most U.S. industries became more concentrated over time, with the “winning firm\" making large profits and realizing outstanding stock returns as well as engaging in more profitable mergers and acquisitions. Barkai (2017) and De Loecker, Eeckhout, and Unger (2018) show that markups have grown over time, lowering both the labor and capital shares. As Edmond, Midrigan, and Xu (2018) show, the rise in markups largely disappears if firm-level markups are aggregated with the proper weights. They nevertheless find large welfare implications of high markups and high-markup dispersion and that reducing markups by taxing large high-markup firms may reduce concentration but also welfare. Like us, they carefully examine the demand-side sources of profitability and labor share dynamics. Baqaee and Farhi (2020) study misallocation in networks and find that high-markup firms have gotten larger over time, which is consistent with our finding that few, but large, $L L$ establishments generate very high-revenue labor productivity. This is also corroborated by findings in Neiman and Vavra (2019), who use household scanner data to show that firms are increasingly able to introduce customized products that make up a large share of individual consumer spending.  \n\nOur finding of lots of turnover among highly productive $L L$ units is consistent with the findings in Brynjolfsson, McAfee, Sorell, and Zhu (2008). They establish that IT investment enables better scalability, thus making it possible for individual firms to quickly generate the large sales we observe in the data. They also find that those IT-intensive industries are typically more concentrated and exhibit higher turnover.  \n\nIssues related to the measurement of the labor share abound: Elsby, Hobijn, and Sahin (2013) refine the imputation of the labor portion of noncorporate income, an adjustment that only moderately mitigates the labor share decline. Bridgman (2014) claims that the rise of less durable capital such as computers and software means that a larger share of value added is spent on replacing depreciated capital. Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014b) explore that issue using worldwide data and show that the potential of higher depreciation to explain the labor share decline is limited: broad trends in the gross and net labor shares are in fact quite similar.  \n\n## 3 Conceptual Framework  \n\nThe main objective of this paper is to study the micro-level anatomy of the aggregate labor share decline. Many different causes—-patterns of reallocation across micro units, different types of shocksmay lead to that outcome. Knowing which causes hold empirical ground will help us understand those structural features of the U.S. economy that matter for the labor share decline. In this section, we lay out a succinct conceptual framework to guide our analysis, built around a simple production function. Its purpose is not to undertake a formal quantitative assessment of different causes but to identify the qualitative relevance of a variety of shocks and reallocation dynamics that could be behind the aggregate labor share decline. Throughout the empirical analysis, we often refer back to this conceptual framework to interpret our findings.  \n\n### 3.1  The Aggregate Labor Share  \n\nTo frame our analysis, consider a specific production unit $i$ (frm, plant, etc.) at time $t$ that employs $L_{i t}$ workers at wage rate $W_{i t}$ to produce $Y_{i t}$ units of a good sold at price $P_{i t}$ . The labor share of that unit is then the ratio of its labor cost to the nominal value added: $\\lambda_{i t}\\equiv(W_{i t}L_{i t})/(P_{i t}Y_{i t})$ Summing up across units, one can express the aggregate labor share, $\\lambda_{t}$ , as the weighted sum of the individual labor shares:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\lambda_{t}=\\displaystyle\\frac{W_{t}L_{t}}{P_{t}Y_{t}}=\\displaystyle\\frac{\\sum_{i}W_{i t}L_{i t}}{\\sum_{i}P_{i t}Y_{i t}}=\\sum_{i}\\omega_{i t}\\lambda_{i t}}}\\ {{=\\overline{{\\lambda}}_{i t}+C o v(\\lambda_{i t},\\omega_{i t}),}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere入s oresondstothelborshareofprodtion it at tetand= denotes the value-added weight of unit $i$ . The second line in the above expression derives from Olley and Pakes (1996) and is useful to illustrate how the aggregate labor share depends on the common unweighted average, $\\lambda_{i t}$ , as well as the joint distribution of labor shares and value added, $C o v(\\lambda_{i t},\\omega_{i t})$ .We now turn our attention to two broad types of distributional changes that are compatible with an aggregate labor share decline. Then, in the next section, we present a set of candidate economic shocks at the micro level that can rationalize these changes.  \n\nCommon effect/trend First, a fall in the aggregate labor share can be the result of a decline in the unweighted average of the distribution of labor shares. That is, any change that affects all or most units symmetrically will alter $\\bar{\\lambda}_{i t}$  \n\nComposition effects Second, Equation (2) indicates that the aggregate labor share can decline if the joint distribution of labor shares and value-added shares evolves in a way that reduces the covariance between these two objects. This can happen for three reasons:  \n\n1. Changes in unit-level market share, $\\Delta\\omega_{i t}$ , may be negatively correlated with the initial level of labor shares $\\lambda_{i t-1}$ . For example, superstar units with constant, but lower than average, labor shares may be growing faster over time. As a result, the covariance term in Equation (2), $C o v(\\lambda_{i t},\\omega_{i t})$ , would decline because $C o v(\\lambda_{i t-1},\\Delta\\omega_{i t})<0$  \n\n2. Conversely, labor share changes, $\\Delta\\lambda_{i t}$ , may be correlated with initial size $\\omega_{i t-1}$ . For example, large units could be more successful in lowering their wage bill while keeping output constant, in turn depressing their individual labor shares. The covariance term, $C o v(\\lambda_{i t},\\omega_{i t})$ , would fall since $C o v(\\Delta\\lambda_{i t},\\omega_{i t-1})<0$ 3. Last, labor share changes, $\\Delta\\lambda_{i t}$ , and relative growth, $\\Delta\\omega_{i t}$ , may be negatively correlated. For example, some units may experience shocks or take actions that lead them to simultaneously gain market share and lower their labor share, reducing the $C o v(\\lambda_{i t},\\omega_{i t})$ term.  \n\nThe discussion in this section makes it clear that the micro-level dynamics of labor shares and market shares can impact the aggregate labor share through many channels. Next, we identify a number of micro-level shocks that may shape these dynamics through their impact on the components of labor and market shares: wages, employment, prices and real output.  \n\n### 3.2 Micro-Level Effects of Demand, Supply and Monopsony Shocks  \n\nFrom de-unionization to automation to rising market power, different forces may impact labor shares at the micro level through distinct components such as wages or markups. In the empirical section, we study those components, with the aim of identifying explanations that are less likely to be relevant and theories that merit attention in further research. To frame our analysis, consider that the production unit $i$ takes factor prices as given, hires labor $L_{i t}$ and rents capital $K_{i t}$ to produce output $Y_{i t}$ using a Cob-Douglasprodution funtion: $Y_{i t}=A_{i t}K_{i t}^{\\alpha_{i}}L_{i t}^{1-\\alpha_{i}}$ where $\\alpha_{i}\\in(0,1)$ 1 Unit $i$ 's labor share can be written as  \n\n$$\n\\lambda_{i t}=\\frac{W_{i t}L_{i t}}{P_{i t}Y_{i t}}=\\frac{W_{i t}}{A R P L_{i t}}=\\frac{W_{i t}}{P_{i t}A P L_{i t}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $W_{i t}$ denotes the market wage, while $\\begin{array}{r}{A R P L_{i t}=\\frac{P_{i t}Y_{i t}}{L_{i t}}}\\end{array}$ and APLit = L are the average revenue and physical products of labor, respectively. Next, we analyze, through the lens of this simple framework, three broad classes of theories that have been proposed in the literature to explain the decline in the labor share.  \n\nDemand shocks and markups Let us decompose further both $\\lambda_{i t}$ and $\\omega_{i t}$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\lambda_{i t}=\\frac{W_{i t}}{P_{i t}A P L_{i t}}=\\frac{W_{i t}}{\\mu_{i t}M C_{i t}A P L_{i t}}=\\frac{1-\\alpha_{i}}{\\mu_{i t}}}\\ &{\\omega_{i t}=\\frac{P_{i t}Y_{i t}}{\\sum_{i}P_{i t}Y_{i t}}=\\frac{\\mu_{i t}M C_{i t}Y_{i t}}{\\sum_{i}P_{i t}Y_{i t}},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mu_{i t}$ corresponds to the price markup, $P_{i t}$ , over the marginal cost, $M C_{i t}$ . The last expression for the labor share follows from the Cobb-Douglas production function, where $1-\\alpha_{i}$ corresponds to the labor elasticity of output.  \n\nConsider that, for some reason, customers value unit $i$ 's products or brand image more than that of the competition. With an isoelastic demand schedule, the only impact of this preference shock would be to raise the unit's market share, $\\omega_{i t}$ . The aggregate labor share could in turn be impacted through a composition effect: for example, the concentration of preference shocks on low labor share units would imply that $C o v(\\lambda_{i t-1},\\Delta\\omega_{i t})$ is negative.  \n\nAlternatively, unit-level labor shares may be affected if markups are instead endogenous. For example, a demand shock may bring unit $i$ into a less elastic part of its demand curve as in Kimball (1995) or Melitz and Ottaviano (2008), leading it to increase its markup. From the two equations, we can clearly see how an idiosyncratic demand shock that raises unit $i$ 's markup $\\mu_{i t}$ leads to a fall in its labor share $\\lambda_{i t}$ and a rise in its market share $\\omega_{i t}$ . The sources and consequences of rising markups have been extensively studied recently; see, e.g., Grullon, Larkin, and Michaely (2016); Barkai (2017); Baqaee and Farhi (2020); Gutiérrez and Philippon (2017); Edmond, Midrigan, and Xu (2018); De Loecker, Eeckhout, and Unger (2018); Neiman and Vavra (2019).  \n\nSupply-side shocks  Technology is another channel that has been suggested by the literature as a potential driver of the downward labor share trend. With a Cobb-Douglas production function, a positive technology shock lowers the unit's marginal cost, $M C_{i t}$ , and increases its average labor productivity, $A P L_{i t}$ , in a way that these changes exactly cancel each other; under our assumptions, the only factors specific to unit $i$ 's labor share are its production elasticity $\\alpha_{i}$ and its markup $\\mu_{i t}$ . Therefore, higher TFP on its own does not have a direct impact on the unit's labor share $\\lambda_{i t}$ , but it will increase its market share $\\omega_{i t}$ 2 Standard TFP shocks could lower the aggregate labor share if they are correlated with labor share levels, i.e., $C o v(\\Delta\\omega_{i t},\\lambda_{i t-1})<0$ , as described in the “composition\" paragraph above). Examples of these type of shocks include Kaymak and Schott (2018), Alvarez-Cuadrado, Long, and Poschke (2018) and Grossman, Helpman, Oberfield, and Sampson (2017).  \n\nTFP shocks may have a different impact if producers do not pass through all the cost savings of a technology shock through lower prices. Instead, producers may choose to raise markups $\\mu_{i t}$ because, for example, producing on a larger scale brings them to a less elastic portion of their demand schedule, as in Kimball (1995); Melitz and Ottaviano (2008). This would be in line with the explanation of Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson, and Van Reenen (2017, forthcoming). Under this scenario, Equations (4) and (5) imply that an idiosyncratic TFP shock will move unit $i$ 'slabor share and market share in opposite directions. Examples of these shocks are featured in Grossman, Helpman, Oberfield, and Sampson (2017); Leblebicioglu and Weinberger (forthcoming); Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014a). Notice that these dynamics are similar to those under the scenario of a demand shock with non-isoelastic demand schedules, except for one important difference: prices will decline after supply-side TFP shocks, while they will increase under demand shocks.  \n\nMonopsony power Last, let us turn to the role of market power in labor markets. If labor market concentration allows businesses to extract rents from workers, we need to relax our assumption that units take factor prices as given. Instead, we follow Berger, Herkenhoff, and Mongey (2019) and rewrite the wage of production unit $i$ $W_{i t}$ , as its marginal revenue product of labor, $M R P L_{i t}$ ， times a generic wage markdown, denoted $\\nu_{i t}\\leq1$ . The more market power a frm has, the more it can depress the wage beneath the marginal revenue product, which is captured by a lower value of $\\nu_{i t}$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\lambda_{i t}=\\frac{W_{i t}L_{i t}}{P_{i t}Y_{i t}}=\\frac{W_{i t}}{A R P L_{i t}}=\\frac{\\nu_{i t}M R P L_{i t}}{A R P L_{i t}}=\\nu_{i t}(1-\\alpha_{i})}\\ &{\\omega_{i t}=\\frac{P_{i t}Y_{i t}}{\\sum_{i}P_{i t}Y_{i t}}.}\\end{array}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nNote that by itself, a lower $\\nu_{i t}$ decreases the unit's labor share but does not increase its valueadded weight unless it is profitable to expand scale and/or adjust its price relative to its peers. A stronger wage markdown may result from increasing labor market concentration (Azar, Marinescu, and Steinbaum (2017); Hershbein, Macaluso, and Yeh (2018); Berger, Herkenhoff, and Mongey (2019); Jarosch, Nimczik, and Sorkin (2019)), labor market deregulation, such as de-unionization (Fichtenbaum (2011)), “right-to-work\" laws (Blanchard and Giavazzi (2003)), demographic factors (Glover and Short (2018)） or search-and-matching frictions (Gouin-Bonenfant (2018)). While the empirical evidence on the link between business concentration trends and labor shares is ambiguous (see Berger, Herkenhoff, and Mongey (2019); Hershbein, Macaluso, and Yeh (2018)), the use of micro-level data allows us to assess its role for the labor share decline.  \n\nThis conceptual framework, while simple, provides us with a lens through which we can interpret the micro-level evidence on labor shares, value added, employment, wages and prices. We now turn to documenting a series of empirical findings that inform us of the forces behind the decline in the aggregatelabor share.  \n\n## 4 Five Findings About the Labor Share  \n\nIn this section, we discuss our data sources and describe how we compute the labor share at the manufacturing establishment level. We then produce a number of findings that highlight the microlevel dynamics at play behind the fuctuations of the manufacturing labor share.  \n\n### 4.1  Data Sources and Measurement  \n\nOur focus is on the labor share dynamics in the U.S. manufacturing sector. This choice was driven by a number of reasons. First, as highlighted by Elsby, Hobijn, and Sahin (2013), manufacturing is one of the sectors where the labor share decline has been most pronounced, making it a natural starting point to study the macro and micro dynamics of the labor share decline. Second, many of the explanations commonly put forward to explain the fall in the labor share, such as automation, competitive pressures by globalization, offshoring, the eroding power of labor unions, etc., are particularly relevant in the context of goods-producing activities. Third, data at the level of individual manufacturing establishments from the U.S. Census Bureau have been heavily studied and are considered to be of higher quality than for other sectors. For example, the information on intermediate inputs and energy use contained in the CMF database allows us to construct reliable measures of value added instead of having to rely on alternative variables such as sales or revenue to generate establishment-level labor shares.  \n\nFourth, the longer time coverage for the manufacturing sector allows us to contrast the dynamics of the labor share both before and after the start of its secular decline, around the early 1980s. While our analysis starts in 1967, the U.S. Census Bureau only began to sample establishments in other sectors in the 1980s or 1990s. Fifth, the higher degree of homogeneity for some manufacturing goods will allow us to disentangle the respective roles of prices and quantities in driving the phenomena we document in the following sections. Sixth, since we consider data from the producer side and focus on the manufacturing sector, our analysis is unlikely to be impacted by the measurement problems present in household-level income data. For example, Elsby, Hobijn, and Sahin (2013) argue that self-employment income matters significantly for these trends. In addition, our results are unlikely to be biased by the evolution of housing prices that impact the measurement of real estate income: Rognlie (2015) documents that income from housing alone was responsible for the labor share dynamics computed from household-side surveys, and Eden and Gaggl (2018) document a similar pattern for residential capital income in more aggregate income and product accounts. Finally, computations by Koh, Santaeulalia-Llopis, and Zheng (2019) show that manufacturing is one of the few sectors in which the measured labor share decline is not overturned by the rise in intellectual property products.  \n\nThe results derived throughout the paper come from the establishment-level CMF database. The U.S. Census Bureau collects data on all manufacturing establishments within the Economic Census, which is taken every five years from 1967 until 2012.3 We drop all observations that are administrative records or are not part of the “\"tabbed sample,” which makes up the official tabulations published by the Census Bureau. We verify that the labor share dynamics in our census data coincide with those documented in the Multifactor Productivity Tables published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The labor share $\\lambda_{t}$ in a given industry and year $t$ is defined as  \n\n$$\n\\lambda_{t}=\\frac{W_{t}L_{t}}{P_{t}Y_{t}},\n$$  \n\nvzhere $W_{t}L_{t}$ denotes manufacturing labor costs and $P_{t}Y_{t}$ is nominal value added produced in the nanufacturing sector at time $t$ , gross of depreciation and taxes. Focusing on the raw nominal data provides us the advantage of avoiding measurement issues related to inflation.  \n\nWe define the following items as labor costs: salaries and wages for permanent and leased workers, involuntary labor costs such as unemployment insurance or social security contributions netted out from wages and voluntary labor costs such as health, retirement and other benefits paid to employees.4 Value added is measured as sales less inventory investment for final and work-inprogress goods, resales, material inputs, contract work and energy expenditures. We also drop all observations in the bottom and top percentiles to avoid outliers driving our results. In doing so, implies that we discard observations with a negative value added (and thus labor share). For more details on the construction of the sample and the variables of interest, see Appendix A.  \n\nNext, we study the anatomy of the decline in the manufacturing labor share by exploiting the establishment-level data described above. We present and analyze five main findings on the micro-level dynamics of the labor share. Our view is that any theory of manufacturing labor share dynamics should be compatible with these salient facts. Though our analysis is at the establishment level, all subsequent results also hold if we aggregate to the firm level. We present those firm-level results in Appendix C.  \n\n### 4.2 Finding 1: The Labor Share: Aggregate Decline, Micro-Level Increase  \n\nWe start by exploiting the decomposition of the manufacturing labor share $\\lambda_{t}$ introduced in Equations (1) and (2) and that we reproduce in the first line below:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\lambda_{t}=\\frac{\\sum_{i}W_{i t}L_{i t}}{\\sum_{i}P_{i t}Y_{i t}}=\\sum_{i}\\omega_{i t}\\lambda_{i t}}\\ {=\\overline{{\\lambda}}_{i t}+C o v(\\lambda_{i t},\\omega_{i t}),}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\lambda_{i t}$ and $\\omega_{i t}$ correspond to the labor share and value-added weight of establishment $i$ at time $t$ , respectively. The second line isolates the role of the covariance: $\\bar{\\lambda}_{i t}$ is the unweighted average, and $C o v(\\lambda_{i t},\\omega_{i t})$ is the covariance between establishment-level labor and market shares.  \n\nFrom this decomposition, we can readily identify two broad ways a decline in the manufacturing labor share may come about. First, it could follow from a general decline of the unit-level labor shares $\\lambda_{i t}$ , which would be reflected in a lower (unweighted average) $\\overline{{\\lambda}}_{i t}$ . This may, for example, come from a rise in markups or monopsony power common to all units. Second, the fall in the manufacturing labor share $\\lambda_{t}$ could be the result of a decline in the covariance between $\\lambda_{i t}$ and $\\omega_{i t}$ For instance, this would happen if low labor share establishments experience an increase in their economic weight over time.  \n\n#### 4.2.1  The Labor Share of the Median Establishment Increases  \n\nWe now aim to disentangle these various scenarios with the help of micro-level data. As a first exercise, Figure 2 plots several quantiles of the raw distribution of establishment-level labor shares $\\lambda_{i t}$ in each census year since 1967, alongside the manufacturing labor share.  \n\n![](images/e2990949968ef98088d27c78d0b4deb4643c8479980fa85e7b4d47125f673f7a.jpg)  \nFigure 2: Sectoral and Establishment-Level Labor Shares in U.S. Manufacturing  \n\nNote: The figure plots the sectoral manufacturing labor share (black line, left axis) against the year-by-year quantiles of the cross-establishment labor share distribution (gray lines, right axis): the solid gray line with circles refects the \"median,”\" per U.S. Census disclosure rules, defined as the average of the sample of observations between the 49th and 51st percentile; the dashed gray lines refect the first and third “\"quartile,” defined analogously to the “median.\" While the manufacturing labor share declines strongly, the “median\" and top “quartile\" labor share increase over time.  \n\nFigure 2 highlights diverging trends in the labor shares at the sectoral and establishment level, particularly since the mid-1980s: while the manufacturing labor share declines by 4.5 ppts per decade, on average, the median labor share increases by 0.7 ppts per decade. The top and bottom quartiles strongly co-move with the median. This finding already makes it clear that the manufacturing labor share decline is not mainly driven by a shift of the distribution of labor shares in individual establishments (corresponding to the $\\lambda_{i t}$ terms in Equation (1). Instead, our evidence points to the importance of reallocation (corresponding to the $\\omega_{i t}$ terms in Equation (1)) as the main driver of the manufacturing labor share dynamics.5 This is what we turn our attention to next.  \n\n#### 4.2.2  Reallocation: Dramatic for Value Added, Anemic for Labor  \n\nThe diverging trends between macro- and micro-level labor shares imply that the $\\omega_{i t}$ terms in Equation (1) must play a central role in driving down the manufacturing labor share, through a reallocation of value added toward the left tail of the labor share distribution. To quantify this reallocation, we divide the distribution of labor shares $\\lambda$ into 10 ppt-wide bins, from 0 to 140 ppts in each year. For each labor share bin, we then compute its share of total manufacturing value added, employment and number of establishments. To control for industry-specific differences, we compute these shares for each three-digit NAICS industry and then aggregate them up in each bin using the industry's value-added weight at the annual level. The subsequent analysis therefore refers to reallocation of value added within a typical industry.6  \n\n![](images/085ff400e2b25439c91f9bbe76a5125769d57c18c3296d9694d92220167abc0f.jpg)  \nFigure 3: Distribution of Establishments, Labor Input and Value-Added Conditional on Labor Share  \n\nNote: The bars in the two panels in the first column reflect the raw cross-establishment distribution of labor shares in 1967 (light gray on top) and 2012 (dark gray on bottom). The panels in the middle column display the allocation of labor, and those in the right column display that of value added. To account for industry-specific differences in the distributions, we first calculated the distributions within each three-digit NAICS industry. Then these industryspecific distributions are averaged across these 21 manufacturing industries using value-added weights in a given year to obtain an estimate of the typical within-industry distribution of establishments, hours worked and value added in thatyear.  \n\nThe light gray bars in the top row of panels in Figure 3 display the distributions of the number of establishments (left), labor input (middle) and value added (right) against the labor share in 1967; the dark gray bars in the bottom row show the analog distributions in 2012. The unweighted distribution of establishments against the labor share (panels in left column) did not change location, which confirms the evidence of the largely stagnant quantiles of the unweighted distribution in Figure 2. There appears to be a slight fattening of the tails, also visible in Figure 2. The distribution of labor input in the middle column panels is measured as employment here, but the distributions of production hours worked look nearly identical. They suggest only a minute reallocation of labor input to low labor share establishments. But the panels in the right column paint a stark picture of drastic reallocation of output: most of value added in 1967 is produced by establishments in the middle of the labor share distribution (between 50 and 80 ppts). The value-added weighted median labor share is 62 ppts. Over the following decades, however, the economic activity shifts gradually and persistently toward the low labor share spectrum: by 2012, half of manufacturing value added is accounted for by establishments with a labor share less than 32 ppts. The disconnect between value added and labor reallocation is a key feature of the labor share decline. Similar evidence at the firm level has been found for other sectors in the U.S. by Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson, and Van Reenen (forthcoming), for Canada by Gouin-Bonenfant (2018) and for China by Berkowitz, May, and Nishioka (2017).  \n\nReferring back to our discussion surrounding Equation (2), Finding 1 makes it clear that common trends (e.g., due to a generalized increase in markups or monopsony power) are unlikely to be behind the decline in the manufacturing labor share. Such a general development would have manifested itself through a leftward shift of the unweighted distribution by 20 ppts, on average, yet it has remained centered around $\\lambda=0.65$ (see left column in Figure 3). Hence, the manufacturing labor share decline must be driven by a strong decline in the covariance between establishment-level labor shares and market shares: since the 1980s, low labor share establishments-though small in number—have also happened to be much larger producers than their high labor share peers, as is visible in the right column of Figure 3. In contrast, the middle column indicates that the distribution of the labor input did not follow the same dramatic pattern: this concentration of value added did not come with a similar shift in the distribution of employment. In the next section, we investigate what could be behind this development and argue that the joint dynamics of value added and the labor share is central to this phenomenon.  \n\n### 4.3  Finding 2: The Importance of the Joint Labor Share and Size Dynamics  \n\nWhile the evidence in Figure 3 is stark, it does not reveal how the reallocation of value added came about. Consider three very different theories that would generate a fall in the manufacturing labor share through a decline in $C o v(\\lambda_{i},\\omega_{i})$ . First, entry/exit could be behind the sectoral downward trend if the labor share of the typical exiting establishment is increasingly higher than the average while that of the typical entrant is increasingly lower. Second, differential growth rates of value added, $\\Delta\\omega_{i t}$ , can have an aggregate impact if they are correlated with the initial labor share at the establishment level. For example, this would happen if superstar units with very low labor shares were to grow at the expense of their peers. Third, large establishments may see their labor shares drop (e.g., because of an increase in their markups or monopsony power), while smaller ones experience the opposite trend. All three scenarios would be compatible with the negative covariance between labor shares and market shares that we document in Finding 1. In this section, we put them to the test with the help of our detailed data.  \n\n#### 4.3.1  The Negligible Role of Entry and Exit  \n\nFirst, we test whether the decline in the manufacturing labor share is driven by the reallocation of value added through entry and exit: the extensive margin can be quantitatively relevant if, in a given year, exiting establishments tend, on average, to have labor shares that are significantly above those of incumbents and/or entrants have relatively low labor shares.  \n\nTo assess the importance of entry and exit, we compute the manufacturing labor share for a strongly balanced sample of establishments that are permanently active from 1967 to 2012.7 If entry and exit were the primary drivers of the labor share decline, the labor share in this strongly balanced sample should be stagnant.  \n\n![](images/33436e03c93ef9ea08df3fa14c614f2c81a95e56f028cc687808ccb2d8fce81c.jpg)  \nFigure 4: Manufacturing Labor Share in Full and Balanced Sample  \n\nNote: The figure plots the manufacturing labor shares computed on the full panel (solid black line) against that computed on a strongly balanced panel (solid gray line). It shows that entry and exit matter for the level but not for the decline of the labor share.  \n\nFigure 4 reveals that the manufacturing labor share in the strongly balanced sample is, on average, about 6 ppts lower than that of the full sample. Yet, the labor share trends in the full and balanced samples are virtually indistinguishable. If anything, the decline is even more pronounced if we ignore entry and exit: the manufacturing labor share in both samples stagnates until 1982 and then falls by 6.2 ppts per decade from 1982 to 2012 in the full sample versus 7.5 ppts in the strongly balanced panel.8 Hence, most of the reallocation we document earlier occurs among incumbent establishments.  \n\n#### 4.3.2 Do Big Players or Superstars Drive Reallocation?  \n\nNext, we turn our attention to the two other scenarios we highlighted earlier. First, we investigate whether establishments that were larger than average early in the sample experienced a relative fall in their labor share afterwards, while smaller establishments instead saw a rise. We take 1982 as the starting point, which coincides with the start of the manufacturing labor share decline.9 In the context of the decomposition in Equation (2), this scenario would be akin to a negative correlation between size in 1982 and labor share changes over the subsequent 1982-2012 period. As a result, the covariance between labor shares and market shares, $C o v(\\lambda_{i t},\\omega_{i t})$ , would decline over time. We refer to this scenario as the big-player economy; it could be driven, for example, by the ability of larger establishments to lower wages through increasing monopsony power.  \n\nAlternatively, establishments with a low initial labor share may have grown faster than their peers in the following decades, a scenario we label the superstar economy. In this case, the decreasing covariance between labor shares and market shares would be driven by the fact that market share growth over the 1982-2012 period is negatively correlated with labor shares in 1982 (i.e., $C o v(\\lambda_{i1982},\\Delta\\omega_{i t})<0\\$  \n\nBoth are examples of the composition effects we discuss in Section 3.1 and are compatible with the two facts highlighted under Finding 1: (1) a relatively stable median labor share and (2) a larger portion of manufacturing output produced at the bottom of the labor share distribution.10  \n\nTo assess which of these two scenarios, if any, is quantitatively relevant, we construct two counterfactual manufacturing labor shares. First, we compute the manufacturing labor share by keeping an establishment's value-added weight $\\omega_{i t}$ equal to its 1982 value while allowing its labor share $\\lambda_{i t}$ to evolve over time as its does in the data:  \n\n$$\n\\lambda_{t}^{B I G}=\\sum_{i}\\lambda_{i t}\\omega_{i1982}.\n$$  \n\nIn the second exercise, we do the reverse: the labor shares $\\lambda_{i t}$ are kept constant to their values in 1982, while we use the historical time series of the weights $\\omega_{i t}$ . Specifically, this second counterfactual labor share is defined as  \n\n$$\n\\lambda_{t}^{S T A R}=\\sum_{i}\\lambda_{i1982}\\omega_{i t}.\n$$  \n\nIfeither $\\lambda_{t}^{B I G}$ Oor $\\lambda_{t}^{S^{\\prime}I^{\\prime}A R}$ were to coincide with the actual manufacturing labor share, we would conclude that either scenario deserves further attention. To conduct this analysis, we focus on a strongly balanced sample of establishments that are permanently active from 1982 to 2012. We display the actual and counterfactual labor shares in Figure 5.  \n\nThe main takeaway from Figure 5 is clear: none of the two counterfactuals can reproduce the historical drop in the labor share of the U.S. manufacturing sector, $\\lambda_{t}^{a c t}$ . In the big-player economy $(\\lambda_{t}^{B I G})$ , the counterfactual labor share remains more or less stagnant, while it dropped by about 18 ppts in the data over the same time period. In other words, the fall in the manufacturing labor share does not appear to be driven by an initial divergence in the relative labor shares of large versus small low labor share establishments.  \n\n![](images/cd00c13c32773ad632ea75090bcb371474bdfc1b94bf1716050c161d33468de4.jpg)  \nFigure 5: The Limited Role of Establishments with an Initially Small Size or Low Labor Share  \n\nNote: The figure plots the actual manufacturing labor share against the counterfactual labor shares in the big-player economy (left panel) and the superstar economy (right panel). It shows that neither did establishments that were initially relatively large experienced a particularly strong labor share decline. Nor did establishments with an initially relatively low level of the labor share grew their value-added shares.  \n\nIf we instead freeze the labor shares at their 1982 level and focus on the contribution of the valueadded weights (the superstar economy $\\lambda_{t}^{S T A R}$ ), we obtain a noticeable rise in the counterfactual labor share: from 55 ppts in 1982, it increases to 60 ppts by 2012, in contrast to a drop of 33 ppts in the actual data. The takeaway from this is that manufacturing establishments with an initially low labor share (the superstars) did not experience, on average, higher growth in value added between 1982 and 2012. As we saw in Section 3.2, this could have happened, for example, if they had been more prone to experience positive TFP shocks over this period.  \n\nThe importance of joint dynamics in the full panel Finding 1 made clear that the downward trend in the manufacturing labor share was due to a strong decline in the establishment-level covariance between labor and market shares, $C o v(\\lambda_{i t},\\omega_{i t})$ . The conclusion from the two exercises in the previous section is that neither market share dynamics nor labor share dynamics at the establishment level can, on their own and separately, explain this development. Instead, the joint dynamics of labor shares and size, $C o v(\\Delta\\lambda_{i t},\\Delta\\omega_{i t})$ , at the micro level are key to our understanding of the aggregate trends in $C o v(\\lambda_{i t},\\omega_{i t})$ and the manufacturing labor share $\\lambda_{t}$ . This analysis, however, requires focusing on a balanced panel. To confrm the crucial role played by the joint dynamics, we next perform a shift-share decomposition at higher frequency and for the full panel, in the spirit of Baily, Hulten, and Campbell (1992):  \n\n$$\n\\Delta\\lambda_{t}=\\underbrace{\\sum_{i}\\omega_{i t-5}\\Delta\\lambda_{i t}}_{\\mathrm{Shift:~+6.9~ppt~}}+\\underbrace{\\sum_{i}\\Delta\\omega_{i t}\\lambda_{i t-5}}_{\\mathrm{Share:~+5.5~ppt~}}+\\underbrace{\\sum_{i}\\Delta\\omega_{i t}\\Delta\\lambda_{i t}}_{\\mathrm{Interaction:~-15.1~ppt~}}.\n$$  \n\nThe first term in Equation (9) is akin to the big-player scenario we described earlier, in which value-added weights are kept fixed to their values in the previous census. The second term instead freezes the micro-level labor shares at their past value while allowing value-added weights to fuctuate, similar to the superstar economy counterfactual. The last term captures the joint dynamics, corresponding to the interaction between the changes in the labor share and changes in the value-added share.  \n\nThe numbers that accompany Equation (9) confirm our earlier findings based on the balanced sample. Specifically, the first two terms do not contribute to the decline in the manufacturing labor share. In fact, they contribute positively to the evolution of the manufacturing labor share, across all sample periods considered: for example, the contribution of the change in the labor shares holding value-added weights constant is $+6.9$ ppts from census to census 0ver the 1982-2012 period, while that of the change in the weights alone is $+5.5$ ppts. The dramatic decline in the manufacturing labor share therefore has to come from the interaction term. Indeed, it has contributed about $-15.1$ ppts from census to census since 1982, thus overcompensating the positive contributions of the “shift” and “share” terms.  \n\nThe main takeaway from the findings in this section is that the decline in the manufacturing labor share is not simply due to a composition effect, whereas superstar establishments take over the market. Instead, it appears to be driven by units whose labor shares fell as they grew in size. These joint dynamics lead to a strong reallocation of economic activity toward the left tail of the labor share distribution and cause $C o v(\\lambda_{i t},\\omega_{i t})$ to turn negative. They also implicitly suggest a polarization of labor shares across establishments, rationalizing the fattening of the tails of the (unweighted) labor share distribution that we describe under Finding 1.  \n\nWhat could be behind these joint dynamics? The conceptual framework of Section 3 provides a few candidates. For example, establishments facing non-isoelastic demand schedules may have experienced strong positive demand or TFP shocks. As we discussed, we would expect this to then generate higher markups, leading to a fall in those establishments’ labor shares $\\lambda_{i t}$ and a rise in their economic weights $\\omega_{i t}$ . The same negative empirical relationship between $\\lambda_{i t}$ and $\\omega_{i t}$ would follow from some establishments gaining monopsonistic power in labor markets.  \n\nYet, distinguishing between the various scenarios that we analyze in Section 3 ultimately requires a deeper analysis of the micro-level dynamics of labor shares and value-added shares, which we turn our attention to for the rest of this paper. In the next section, we identify the respective roles of value added, employment and wages in driving fuctuations in establishments’ labor shares.  \n\n### 4.4 Finding 3: Labor Shares Are Driven by Value Added, Not Wages or Employment  \n\nThe first two findings imply that the factors behind the decline in the manufacturing labor share must (1) catalyze a reallocation of economic activity toward low labor share establishments and (2) generate a negative correlation between labor share and value-added dynamics at the establishment level. As we saw in the context of the conceptual framework of Section 3, all three types of shocks we discussed—demand, technology or monopsony—are, under some assumptions, consistent with this evidence. To discriminate between them, we now turn our attention to the cross-sectional and time-series properties of the components of the labor share: wages, value added, employment, product prices and quantities.  \n\n#### 4.4.1 Wages and Labor Productivity across Establishments  \n\nAs a first step, let us rewrite the log of the labor share of establishment $i$ at time $t$ as  \n\n$$\n\\log\\lambda_{i t}=\\log W_{i t}-\\log A R P L_{i t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $W_{i t}$ is the average employee's wage and $A R P L_{i t}=P_{i t}Y_{i t}/L_{i t}$ denotes the average revenue product of labor.ll As we saw in the conceptual framework, monopsony power in labor markets would predominantly affect wages $W_{i t}$ , while theories of efficiency or demand factors would impact ARPLit?  \n\nTo ensure that our results are not driven by systematic differences across industries, regions or time, as well as to make them more readily interpretable (wages and value added per worker are nominal variables), we study an establishment's wage, value added per worker relative to that of its peer group. We define peers to be establishments that are active in the same state and threedigit NAICS industry.12 The relative wage, $\\widetilde{w}_{i t}$ , and revenue labor productivity, ${p_{i t}}{y_{i t}}/{l_{i t}}$ ,are then defined in logs as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\equiv\\log X_{i t}-\\overline{{\\log X_{-i,t}}}\\quad\\mathrm{~where~}\\overline{{\\log X_{-i,t}}}\\equiv\\sum_{j\\neq i}\\frac{P_{j t}Y_{j t}}{\\sum_{j\\neq i}P_{j t}Y_{j t}}\\log X_{j t}\\mathrm{~and~}X_{i t}=W_{i t},\\frac{P_{i t}Y_{i t}}{\\log X_{i t}}\\equiv\\sum_{j\\neq i}\\frac{P_{j t}Y_{j t}}{\\sum_{j\\neq i}P_{j t}Y_{j t}}\\log X_{i t}.\n$$  \n\nwhere we omit the industry and region subscripts for expositional purposes. The measure $\\widetilde{x}_{i t}$ is, by definition, centered around zero and denotes an establishment's percentage deviation from the value-added weighted average of its peers. The advantage is that both relative measures are dimension-free metrics and can be compared across markets, years and industries.  \n\nOur first exercise is to study the relationship between the labor share $\\lambda$ and its two components $\\widetilde{w}$ and $\\overset{\\cdot}{p y/l}$ ) in the cross-section. To do so, we run the following nonparametric regressions:  \n\n$$\n\\widetilde{x}_{i t}=f(\\lambda_{i t})+\\varepsilon_{i t},\\qquad\\widetilde{x}_{i t}=\\widetilde{w}_{i t},\\widetilde{p_{i t}y_{i t}/l}_{i t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\widetilde{x}_{i t}$ is either establishment $i$ 's relative wage, $\\widetilde{w}_{i t}$ , or labor productivity, ${p_{i t}y_{i t}}/{l_{i t}}$ .The function $f(\\cdot)$ is the object of interest: it indicates whether low labor share establishments pay lower wages than their peers and/or experience higher labor productivity. To ensure that we measure economically relevant relationships, each observation is weighted by the establishment's value-added share (the findings below are even stronger for unweighted regressions). Notice that we cannot include multiple right-hand-side variables in this local polynomial regression. Yet, since $\\widetilde{w}$ and $\\widetilde{p y/l}$ are defined within each industry, year and region, we ensure that our findings are not driven by systematic differences along those dimensions.  \n\n![](images/18e45f928b3d0189b8d0c74b13320cf59e3638074d5455496d70bf9601e57df2.jpg)  \nFigure 6: Labor Productivity Dominates Cross-Sectional Differences of Labor shares.   \nNote: The figure displays the cross-sectional differences in relative value added per worker $\\overset{\\cdot}{p y/l}$ andtherelative wage $\\widetilde{w}$ against the labor share. All relative measures denote log-point differences vis-a-vis their peers as defined in Equation (11). Dashed lines denote 95% error bands.  \n\nThe results of the two nonparametric regressions are displayed in Figure 6. They paint a clear picture. First, relative wages are nearly orthogonal to the labor share: establishments with a low labor share do not, on average, pay their workers more or less than their peers.13 By definition, differences in the labor share therefore have to be explained by differences in relative labor productivity. Indeed, the relationship between these two variables is strongly negative: $\\overset{\\rightharpoonup}{p y/l}$ starts at about 1.6 for establishments with a near-zero labor share and then gradually declines through the labor share spectrum, hitting the average labor productivity ( $\\widetilde{p y/l}=0\\$ )at a labor share of $\\lambda=0.46$ . These differences are large. For example, establishments with a labor share of $\\lambda=0.1$ experience a relative labor productivity of $\\widetilde{p y/l}=1.04$ , meaning that they produce $\\exp(1.04)\\approx2.83$ times more value added per worker than the average establishment in the same industry, region and year.  \n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, establishments with a labor share of unity exhibit $\\widetilde{p y/l}=$ $-0.61$ , which means that they produce only a bit above half the value added per worker $(\\exp(-0.61)\\approx$ 0.54) of their peers. The takeaway from this analysis is that low labor share establishments do not pay lower wages than their peers, as would be expected under theories of the labor share decline that rely on labor market power. Instead, they generate high value added per worker, which is consistent with theories of superior efficiency or consumer preferences.  \n\n#### 4.4.2 Dynamics  \n\nIn Section 4.3, we show that the joint dynamics of the labor share and value added at the establishment level are central to the aggregate behavior of the labor share. Next, we delve deeper into these dynamics by focusing on establishments at the bottom of the labor share distribution. This group, as we show in Section 4.2.2, experience a dramatic rise of its economic importance between 1967 and 2012. We start by defining and characterizing this subsample before studying its dynamics.  \n\nDefining low labor share establishments We define low-labor share ( $L L$ )establishments as those in the lowest quintile of the labor share distribution, in a given year and three-digit NAICS industry. The quintiles are industry specific due to the wide range of average labor shares across industries.  \n\nTo highlight the role of $L L$ establishments in shaping aggregate dynamics, we start by recomputing the manufacturing labor share without them. If reallocation toward lower labor shares was pervasive throughout the distribution in general, we would expect to also observe a labor share decline in the subsample without $L L$ establishments, albeit from a higher starting point. The labor shares including and excluding $L L$ establishments are shown in Figure 7. Two aspects stand out: first and unsurprisingly, the level of the manufacturing labor share without the bottom quintile of the distribution is much higher, at about 0.75. Second, and more importantly, the level does not exhibit any decline: while the actual manufacturing labor share starts to fall in the 1980s, the counterfactual manufacturing labor share without $L L$ establishments fuctuates around its time-series mean, with no discernible downward trend in the second half of the sample. In other words, while reallocation among non- $L L$ establishments may be taking place, it does not contribute meaningfully to the empirically observed manufacturing labor share decline. This indicates that analyzing the nature of $L L$ establishments is key to understanding the forces behind the labor share decline.  \n\nGoing back to the cross-sectional analysis of Section 4.4.1, we find that $L L$ establishments have an average relative labor productivity, $\\overset{\\cdot}{p y/l}$ , of 0.596 compared to $-0.428$ for non- $L L$ establishments; the average $L L$ establishment thus produces about 2.8 times more value added per worker than the typical non- $L L$ establishment. Yet, in terms of relative wages, they are not significantly different than their peers.  \n\nThe dynamics of the labor share components Next, we investigate how the dynamics of the typical $L L$ establishment's labor share, and that of its components, differ from those of non- $L L$ establishments. Using the data, our objective is to decompose the growth rate of micro-level labor shares $(\\Delta\\log\\lambda_{i t})$ into the contributions from wages $(\\Delta\\log W_{i t})$ , employment $(\\Delta\\log L_{i t})$ and value  \n\nFigure 7: The Importance of $L L$ Establishments for the Manufacturing Labor Share Decline  \n\n![](images/9624687f787724675fe2bab862351eba48b30080fdf725f5ce74afdf7f96fa30.jpg)  \n\nNote: The figure plots the manufacturing labor shares computed on the full panel (solid black line) against that computed for the panel after dropping the set of $L L$ establishments (solid gray line). It shows that non- $L L$ establishments do not contribute to the decline of the manufacturing labor share.  \n\nadded $(\\Delta\\log(P_{i t}Y_{i t}))$  \n\n$$\n\\Delta\\log\\lambda_{i t}=\\Delta\\log W_{i t}+\\Delta\\log L_{i t}-\\Delta\\log(P_{i t}Y_{i t}).\n$$  \n\nOur strategy is to use a regression approach to quantify the change of a specific variable for $L L$ establishments relative to their peers. In particular, we first construct the growth rates in the labor share, employment, wage bill and value added between two census years (from years $t-5$ to $t$ )for each establishment in the panel. We then regress these changes on a dummy variable that equals one if an establishment is among the $L L$ establishments in the current census year. For example for the growth rate of the labor share, the specification is  \n\n$$\n\\Delta\\log x_{i t}=c+\\beta\\mathbb{I}\\{L L_{i t}\\}+\\gamma X_{i t}+\\varepsilon_{i t}\\qquad{\\mathrm{where~}}x_{t}=\\lambda_{i t},W_{i t},L_{i t}{\\mathrm{~or~}}P_{i t}Y_{i t}.\n$$  \n\nWhile the level of the labor share of $L L$ establishments is below that of their peers by definition— they consist of $L L$ establishments in the lowest quintile in a given year and industry-our aim here is to uncover their relative dynamics from the estimates of the coefficient $\\beta$ in Equation (13). That is, we study how the dynamics of the labor share and its components for the typical $L L$ establishments differ from those of non- $L L$ establishments over the previous five-year window. Note that we do not require that $L L$ establishments in period $t$ also be $L L$ establishments in $t-5$ . The vector $X_{i t}$ contains industry, region and year dummies as controls. We estimate Equation (13) with and without value-added weights to account for the fact that larger establishments are likely to have less volatile labor shares. The procedure is similar for the wage bill, employment and value added regressions.14 Results from the weighted regressions are displayed in Table 1.  \n\nTable 1: Dynamics of $L L$ Establishments   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(I) △ log 入it</td><td>(I1) △log Wit</td><td>(II1) △log Lit</td><td>(IV) △ log(PitYit)</td></tr><tr><td>β</td><td>-0.4632 *** (0.0154)</td><td>-0.0099 (0.0100)</td><td>0.0001 (0.0284)</td><td>0.4532 *** (0.0442)</td></tr><tr><td>Change in ppt</td><td>-18.04</td><td>-0.4</td><td>0.0</td><td>-17.7</td></tr><tr><td>R2</td><td>0.186</td><td>0.135</td><td>0.021</td><td>0.114</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNote: This table shows the pooled OLS regression of Equation (13) on the full census panel. Observations are weighted using the share of establishment $i$ 's value added in overall manufacturing value added. Standard errors are clustered at the four-digit NAICS industry level. Significance levels are denoted by \\*( $10\\%$ level), $^{**}$ $5\\%$ level) and $^{***}$ $1\\%$ level).  \n\nThe first column of Table 1 implies that relative to the previous census year, an establishment that has $L L$ status at time $t$ saw its labor share fall by $46\\%$ . This strongly significant estimate translates into a labor share drop of 18 ppts. Columns (II)-(IV) of Table 1 present the results from a similar value-weighted regression but with the relative wage, employment or value added on the left-hand side of the equation. They indicate that out of the 18 ppt drop in the labor share for the typical $L L$ establishment, a full 17.7 ppts come from increasing value added relative to non- $L L$ establishments. In contrast, the relative dynamics of wages and employment do not contribute to the differential labor share dynamics of $L L$ establishments in a meaningful way. Note that when we estimate the relative dynamics in an unweighted fashion, the results are even stronger, suggesting a relative labor share decline of 29 ppts, on average, for $L L$ establishments. Again, an overwhelming proportion of this change is driven by value added.  \n\nGoing back to the framework of Section 3.2, recall that we could write the labor share as MRPLa. Since we find no evidence that wages are important for explaining labor share differences across establishments or over time, we can conclude that the “exploitation parameter,' $\\nu_{i t}$ , is not a quantitatively important factor driving labor shares in our sample. In sum, it appears unlikely that increased monopsony power in the labor market is behind the fall in the manufacturing labor share.  \n\n### 4.5  Finding 4: Low Labor Shares Stem Mostly from a Product Price Premium  \n\nThe previous section highlights the key role played by value added: cross-sectional and dynamic differences between $L L$ and non- $L L$ establishments appear to be driven by nominal value added per worker. This leaves two candidate forces driving the manufacturing labor share decline: nominal price dynamics and real labor productivity. Next, we provide evidence that demand-side factors, rather than technology, appear to be a key driver of micro-level labor share patterns.  \n\n#### 4.5.1 Measuring Prices  \n\nTo identify the relative contributions of these two distinct forces, we turn to another data source provided by the U.S. Census Bureau: the product trailer to the CMF. For each establishment, the product trailer records the value of sales generated by individual products (variable Pv). In addition, it collects information on the physical quantity of products shipped (variable PQs) for a sample of establishments whenever a meaningful metric can be used. In those cases, we can compute the average product-level price charged by an individual establishment. We use this subset of the database to disentangle the contribution of prices from that of physical productivity.  \n\nOur analysis is inspired by the approach pioneered in Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson (2008), though we deviate from their methodology in that we consider products at the ten-digit NAICS level, a finer definition of product than most of the literature.15 This is a product-coding system devised by the Census Bureau and is based on the NAICS industry code. Second, because our aim is to study an establishment's prices and real productivities relative to that of its peers, we only use observations that are not imputed to ensure that values are directly comparable (for details, seeAppendix A.5).16  \n\nThe price data have some drawbacks, however. For one, the imputation fags for prices and quantities are only available starting with the 1992 census, and coverage is very limited in the 1992 and 2012 census. Most importantly, only a few industries have well-defined quantity measures for (a subset of) their products. In addition to the products studied by Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson (2008), examples of manufacturing goods we consider are certain homogeneous chemicals (measured in metric tons) or metals such as aluminum sheets (measured in thousand pounds), for example, but not vehicles or clothing, which are measured in the generic unit “number.\" All these limitations imply that we are left with a panel of 130,000 year-establishment-product observations whose quality is high enough to study separately prices and quantities. We call the resulting panel the “matched price sample\" to distinguish it from the “full census sample,” our default panel.  \n\nThe matched price sample allows us to link an establishment's product-level prices and its revenue labor productivity, which we earlier find to be the key driver of labor shares in the crosssection and time series. Since all price data are sales based, we switch to studying sales per worker, rather than value added per worker, when analyzing the price versus physical productivity difference. We define relative sales per worker analogous to that of relative value added per worker  \n\nin Equation (11):  \n\n$$\n\\widetilde{p_{i t}q_{i t}/l_{i t}}\\equiv\\log\\left(P_{i t}Q_{i t}/L_{i t}\\right)-\\overline{{\\log(P_{-i,t}Q_{-i,t}/L_{-i,t})}}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{where}\\overline{{\\log(P_{-i,t}Q_{-i,t}/L_{-i,t})}}\\equiv\\sum_{j\\neq i}\\frac{P_{j t}Q_{j t}}{\\sum_{j\\neq i}P_{j t}Q_{j t}}\\log\\left(P_{j t}Q_{j t}/L_{j t}\\right).\n$$  \n\nNaturally, the products in the matched price sample are more homogeneous than those in the full census sample. The distribution of $p_{i t}q_{i t}/l_{i t}$ can thus be expected to be more compressed in the matched price sample than in the full census sample. Yet, our analysis in Appendix A.5 reveals that differences in sales per worker remain the main driver of both cross-sectional and dynamic moments of the labor shares in the matched price sample.  \n\n#### 4.5.2  Product Prices across Establishments  \n\nTo make prices comparable across establishments, we adopt the treatment of nominal wages and labor productivity in Section 4.4 by comparing establishment-level prices to a peer group. This time, however, we have to start at the product level. First, we normalize prices at the level of the ten-digit NAICS product $\\ell$  \n\n$$\n\\widetilde{p}_{i\\ell t}\\equiv\\log P_{i\\ell t}-\\overline{{\\log P_{-i,\\ell t}}}\\qquad\\mathrm{where~}\\overline{{\\log P_{-i,\\ell t}}}\\equiv\\sum_{j\\neq i}\\frac{P_{j\\ell t}Q_{j\\ell t}}{\\sum_{j\\neq i}P_{j\\ell t}Q_{j\\ell t}}\\log P_{j\\ell t}.\n$$  \n\nThat is, we compare the price of product $\\ell$ sold by establishment $i$ at time $t$ to the weighted average of the prices charged for the same product by all other establishments $j\\neq i$ in the same year. $\\widetilde{p}_{i\\ell t}$ denotes the log-point difference that establishment $i$ charges for product $\\ell$ compared to the average price charged by its peers for the same product.  \n\nNext, we aggregate these relative prices across all products offered by establishment $i$ and year $t$ to obtain the establishment-level sales-weighted average relative product price $\\widetilde{p}_{i t}$  \n\n$$\n\\widetilde{p}_{i t}\\equiv\\sum_{\\ell\\in i}\\widetilde{p}_{i\\ell t}\\frac{P_{i\\ell t}Q_{i\\ell t}}{\\sum_{\\ell\\in i}P_{i\\ell t}Q_{i\\ell t}}.\n$$  \n\nWerefer to $\\widetilde{p}_{i t}$ as the average product price premium that establishment $i$ charges relative to its peers across its product lines. This measure represents the mean log-point difference between an establishment's output prices and those of its peers.17  \n\nSimilar to our earlier approach, we nonparametrically estimate the cross-sectional relationship between the product price premium and the labor share. Because sales are multiplicative in prices and quantities, we can interpret the magnitude of the product price premium as the share of relative sales per worker explained by prices; the remainder is the portion explained by physical labor productivity $\\widetilde{q/l}$ . If establishments with a low labor share operated superior technologies and produced the same goods $\\ell$ more efficiently, we would expect them to post lower prices in those categories and to sweep up the market at the expense of their peers. Such technology-driven growth would show up as a generally negative $\\hat{p}$ for establishments with a low labor share and vice versa for high labor share establishments. If, on the other hand, low labor share establishments faced favorable demand conditions that allowed them to post a higher price and to generate higher revenues as a result, we would anticipate an opposite pattern: positive $\\widetilde{p}$ for low labor share and negative $\\widetilde{p}$ for high labor share establishments.  \n\n![](images/a1e73cf7a2dd093f6cd513b36fd3eb7e39647e5a4ae7014edae780deb0e3856b.jpg)  \nFigure 8: The Contributions of Physical Productivity and Prices to Relative Sales per Worker   \nNote: The figure displays the cross-sectional differences in relative prices $\\widetilde{p}$ (dark gray bars) and relative physical labor productivity $\\widetilde{q/l}$ (light gray bars) against the labor share; $\\widetilde{p}$ defined in Equation (15) and $\\widetilde{q/l}$ is defined as the ratio of $\\widetilde{p q/l}$ (defined in Equation (14)) and $\\widetilde{p}$  \n\nThe contributions of the two components (relative prices and relative physical productivity) to differences in relative sales are depicted in Figure 8. We can see that while relative sales per worker are driven by both price and physical labor productivity differences, prices are crucial in characterizing those establishments with the lowest labor share. For example, for establishments with a labor share below $20\\%$ , relative prices explain more than two-thirds of the sales per worker differences $\\widetilde{(p q/l)}$ . However, relative prices play only a little role in explaining differences in establishments’ sales/workers with a labor share of 50 ppts and more. Focusing on $L L$ establishments, their average relative price is 0.15 compared to $-0.041$ for non- $L L$ establishments. This difference implies a product price premium for $L L$ establishments of roughly $\\exp(0.15+0.041)\\approx21\\%$ . This contributes a fair amount to the relative sales per worker that $L L$ establishments generate to their peers of $\\exp(0.430+0.096)\\approx69\\%$  \n\n#### 4.5.3 Dynamic Evidence  \n\nAnalogous to the dynamic analysis of wages, employment and value added in the previous section, we repeat the estimation of Equation (13) for relative prices, $\\Delta\\widetilde{p}_{i t}$ , and relative physical output per worker, $\\Delta(q_{i t}/l_{i t})$ . The results are displayed in Table 2.  \n\nTable 2: Price and Physical Productivity Dynamics of $L L$ Establishments   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>(I) (II) △pit</td></tr><tr><td>β 0.1675***</td><td>(qit / lit) -0.0493</td></tr><tr><td>(0.0545)</td><td>(0.0844)</td></tr><tr><td>R2 0.093</td><td>0.135</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNote: This table shows the pooled OLS regression of Equation (13) on the matched price panel where each observatio1 is weighted with its share in manufacturing sales. For more details, see notes to Table 1.  \n\nThe results of the dynamic analysis are even starker than those from the cross-section: compared to their non- $L L$ peers, the relative prices of $L L$ establishments increase by $16.8\\%$ fromthe previous census year (from $t-5$ to $t$ ). While the coefficient estimates for the $L L$ versus non- $L L$ price dynamics are statistically significant, this is not the case for physical productivity: the point estimate, at $-4.9\\%$ , is more than three times smaller than for prices and is not significantly different than zero.  \n\nThe findings in this section provide important insights that help us discriminate between the potential theories behind the dramatic decline in the manufacturing labor share. From the framework of Section 3.2, we know both demand- and technology-based theories could be compatible with Findings 1 to 4: preference or TFP shocks, combined with non-isoelastic demand schedules, can explain the joint dynamics of labor and market shares at the establishment level because both of them would increase markups, leading to a reallocation of economic activity toward $L L$ establishments. Yet, the fact that relative prices and labor shares co-move negatively represents strong evidence in favor of demand shocks suggesting that demand shocks are first order to explain labor share dynamics of $L L$ : under technology shocks, we would expect relative prices to fall alongside labor shares. Furthermore, we provide additional evidence on the unimportance of supply factors in Appendix D.  \n\n### 4.6 Finding 5: Shooting Stars, or the Transience of Low Labor Shares  \n\nSeen through the lens of the conceptual framework of Section 3.2, our evidence indicates that demand factors must be playing a central role: they can rationalize both the joint dynamics of labor share and value added as well as the importance of prices in driving the high nominal labor productivity of low labor share establishments. The analysis of $L L$ establishments also show that this status is the product of an economically large rise in value added, driven mainly by higher prices. But what is the dynamic nature of these underlying demand drivers? Is their impact on the labor shares of establishments highly persistent or transient? The answer is relevant at many levels. For one, it can instruct policymakers on the nature of concentration: transient labor and market shares would have different implications for competition policy than if the economy was characterized by $L L$ establishments that are progressively taking over their market and are lowering their labor shares. Moreover, it can help us have a better sense of the nature of demand factors and their impact on firms' actions. With these objectives in mind, in this section, we turn to an analysis of the labor share persistence at the micro level.  \n\nMarkov transitional dynamics We start by analyzing the transition dynamics of $L L$ and non$L L$ establishments. Our objective is to assess whether the demand drivers identified in Findings 3 and 4 are important enough to perturb the rankings of establishments along the labor share dimension. We do so with the help of a Markov transition matrix, displayed in Table 3. More specifically, we ask a simple question: conditional on an establishment's labor share at time $t$ , what is the probability that it has $L L$ status at time $t+5$ ?If $L L$ status was highly persistent, this probability should be equal to $100\\%$ . At the polar opposite, if labor shares are so volatile that they perturb the ranking every period, we should expect the identity of $L L$ establishments to be random and the transition probability to be close to $20\\%$  \n\nTable 3: Transition Probabilities of $L L$ Status   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Panel A: Unweighted transitional dynamics</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Non-LLt LLt 0.583</td><td>Non-LLt+5 LLt+5</td></tr><tr><td>0.854 0.146 0.417</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Panel B: Weighted transitional dynamics</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">0.922</td><td>Non-LLt+5 LLt+5</td></tr><tr><td>0.078</td></tr><tr><td>Non-LLt LLt</td><td>0.536 0.464</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNote: The table shows the Markov matrix of labor shares from census to census. Panel A considers the share of establishments that remain/leave/enter $L L$ status when quintiles are unweighted, and Panel B displays the share of manufacturing value added accounted for by the $L L$ establishments when defined by $V A$ weightedquintiles.  \n\nTable 3 shows that over our sample period, the probability that an establishment retains $L L$ status from census year to census year (a five-year window) is only 41.7%. While this is higher than if $L L$ status were perfectly random (20%), the transition probability indicates that labor share at the establishment level is surprisingly transient, even for the most productive establishments.  \n\nOne may be concerned that the results in Table 3 are mostly driven by small, economically insignificant establishments. For this reason, we also consider Markov transition matrices of quintiles weighted by economic activity and confirm the transient dynamics of $L L$ establishments. These results are displayed in Panel B; while they indicate slightly more persistence, the overall impression remains unchanged.  \n\nV-shaped dynamics In light of their surprisingly temporary nature, we aim next to quantify the labor share dynamics that occurs in the years following $L L$ status. To do so, we adopt the same type of regression framework as in Sections 4.4.2 and 4.5.3, which captures the dynamics of $L L$ establishments relative to their peers. Specifically, we regress both backward-looking (from years $t-5$ to $t$ ) and forward-looking (from $t$ to $t+5$ ) percentage point changes in establishment-level labor shares on a dummy variable that equals one if an establishment is among the $L L$ establishments in the current census year:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\Delta\\log\\lambda_{i t}=c_{1}+\\beta_{-5}\\mathbb{I}\\{L L_{i t}\\}+\\gamma X_{i t}+\\varepsilon_{1i t}}\\ {\\Delta\\log\\lambda_{i t+5}=c_{2}+\\beta_{+5}\\mathbb{I}\\{L L_{i t}\\}+\\gamma X_{i t}+\\varepsilon_{2i t}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nOur objective is to rely on the estimates of the coefficients $\\beta_{-5}$ and $\\beta_{+5}$ in Equations (16) and (17) to characterize how the labor share dynamics of $L L$ establishments differ from those of non- $L L$ establishments over a ten-year window around the reference period. Note that we do not require that $L L$ establishments in period $t$ also be $L L$ establishments in $t-5$ and in $t+5$ ; an establishment could well have $L L$ status for a single year. The vector $X_{i t}$ contains controls that have been described earlier, and estimation is done both with and without value-added weights. Results are displayed in Table 4. Since Equations (13) for $\\lambda_{i t}$ and (16) here are equivalent, the weighted results in the first row here are exactly the dynamics shown in Column (I) of Table 1.  \n\nTable 4: Before-After Dynamics of $L L$ Establishments   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variable</td><td>(I) △ log 入t</td><td>(I1) △log 入t+5</td><td>(III) △入t</td><td>(IV) △入t+5</td><td>(V) △入t</td><td>(VI) △入t+5</td></tr><tr><td>β-5</td><td>-0.4632 *** (0.0154)</td><td></td><td>-0.1804 *** (0.0100)</td><td></td><td>-0.2896 *** (0.0076)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>s+g</td><td></td><td>+0.3844*** (0.0177)</td><td></td><td>+0.1542*** (0.0102)</td><td></td><td>+0.2710*** (0.0071)</td></tr><tr><td>R2</td><td>0.186</td><td>0.108</td><td>0.102</td><td>0.070</td><td>0.111</td><td>0.096</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VA weights</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>no</td><td>no</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: The table shows the pooled OLS regression of Equations (16) and (17) on the full census panel. For morr details, see notes to Table 1.  \n\nIf the labor shares of $L L$ establishments were to permanently reach a lower level relative to their non- $L L$ peers, the coefficient $\\beta_{+5}$ would be close to zero. The estimation indicates, however, that this is clearly not the case: $\\beta_{+5}$ is statistically different than zero. In fact, it shows again that $L L$ status is highly transient: while a typical establishment with $L L$ status at time $t$ saw its labor share since $t-5$ shrink by 46.3% (Column (I)), it rises by $38.4\\%$ in the subsequent five years (Column (II)).  \n\nTo ease interpretation, we repeat the regressions (16) and (17) with the percentage point change of labor shares, $\\Delta\\lambda_{i t}=\\lambda_{i t}-\\lambda_{i t-5}$ , on the left-hand side instead of the growth rate. As Column (III) shows, $L L$ establishments experience a relative labor share decline of 18 ppts. Yet, in the five-year period thereafter (from $t$ to $t+5$ ), the coefficient estimates of $\\beta_{+5}$ in Columns (II)/(IV) indicate that the change in the labor share of establishments that are $L L$ in year $t$ will expand by $38.4\\%$ (corresponding to 15.4 ppts) more than that of non- $L L$ establishments.  \n\nFinally, we report the results for $\\beta_{-5}$ and $\\beta_{+5}$ as cumulative growth rates in the left panel of Figure 9. The figure confirms that compared to $t-5$ , time- $t$ $L L$ establishments appear to be barely different than their non- $L L$ peers by $t+5$ . The unweighted estimates in Columns (V) and (VI) are stronger, indicating that small $L L$ establishments see even more extreme labor share dynamics in absolute value. All in all, our analysis appears to show that the average $L L$ establishment experiences a rather temporary drop and rebound in its labor share. This finding is in line with the earlier evidence from the Markov transition matrices and confirms the low persistence of $L L$ status.  \n\n![](images/3a8f170312211385b4c804b26205673df699b1771133ff580e33a2c31b3749bb.jpg)  \nFigure 9: The Temporary Fall and Rise of Labor Shares of $L L$ Establishments   \nNote: The left panel shows the cumulative evolution of the labor share of the average $L L$ establishment relative to their peers in the census panel before ( $\\mathit{\\Delta t}-5$ to $t$ ）and after ( $t$ to $t+5$ ) the year it is in $L L$ status. Unweighted dynamics are in dark gray, value added-weighted dynamics are in light gray, and whiskers denote $95\\%$ error bands. The y-axis represents labor share changes, where the labor share is expressed as a decimal. The right panel shows analogous labor share dynamics of $L L$ establishments in the Annual Survey of Manufactures data.  \n\nLabor share dynamics and measurement error One potential concern is that the low persistence of the labor share is driven by widespread measurement error. Under this scenario, $L L_{t}$ establishments would simply be establishments that experienced large (negative) mismeasurement attime $t$ yet whose fundamentals were not any different than the typical establishment in the population. This would mechanically give rise to the temporary change shown in the left panel of Figure 9. Using only data every five years would make our analysis vulnerable to measurement errors in just that single year. While this may be a concern, especially for small $L L$ establishments, measurement error for large establishments whose labor share is low is much less likely, as the Census Bureau pays a lot of attention to large producers that matter greatly for their aggregate  \n\ntabulations.  \n\nTo alleviate this concern, we turn our attention to the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM) sample. While this yearly data set does not capture the population of manufacturing establishments, its macro-level labor share dynamics are very similar to those of the census. Crucially, its yearly frequency allows us to more easily disentangle signal from noise: if $L L$ status were merely driven by idiosyncratic measurement error, we would expect establishments that have $L L$ status to look, on average, like their non- $L L$ peers not only five years before and after (census frequency) but also in the years directly following and preceding year $t$ (ASM frequency).  \n\nFor this robustness check, we adapt the estimation in Equations (16) and (17) to an annual frequency and run ten regressions, one for each of the preceding five and subsequent five years. The results are reported in the right panel of Figure 9. They confirm the transient nature of the labor share that we found using census years. However, while the trough at $t$ is unmistakable, notice that the relative change in the labor share is not taking place entirely between $t-1$ and $t$ but instead occurs regularly over the preceding years. Also, notice that it does not recover fully even after five years, when the labor share is estimated to still be 5-8 ppts below the level of non- $L L$ establishments. All in all, our evidence appears to indicate that the transient nature of $L L$ status is not merely an artifact of transient measurement error.18  \n\n#### 4.6.1 Why Does the Labor Share Rebound?  \n\nIn Section 4.3, we find that the drop in the labor share of the typical $L L$ establishment was due to a strong increase in value added. In the context of the V-shape dynamics discussed earlier, this naturally leads to another question: is the rebound of the $L L$ labor share in the following five years driven by employment or wages catching up with revenue labor productivity? The former would suggest that demand shocks, while large and dominant in driving labor shares, are rather transient; the latter, on the other hand, could result from labor adjustment costs or rigid wages. To quantify the relative contributions of wages, employment and value added to the $t$ to $t+5$ labor share dynamics of $L L$ establishments, we estimate Equations (16) and (17) for these three variables separately. The results are displayed in Figure 10.  \n\nThe leftmost bar in Figure 10 depicts graphically the results from Table 1: between $t-5$ and $t$ ， the average $L L$ establishment saw its labor share shrink by 18 ppts compared to the typical non- $L L$ establishment, and this drop was almost entirely due to the differential in value added growth. The rightmost bar instead shows the cumulative contribution of each component. Incorporating the five following years, we see that the V-shaped pattern of the labor share between $t-5$ and $t+5$ is mainly a result of the reversal of the initial jump in value added of $L L$ establishments. This  \n\n![](images/e1ad2448f1bf5fc8a78ebc483d01c561cfc1ddfc7a2614d67cca9df4fe3eaad5.jpg)  \nFigure 10: Value-Added Dynamics Dominate Labor Share Dynamics of $L L$ Establishments  \n\nNote: This figure displays the dynamic contributions of the changes in wages, employment and value added for labor share dynamics of the average $L L$ establishment relative to its peers. The first bars display their contributions before $t-5$ to $t$ )and the second bars their cumulative contributions until after ( $t-5$ to $t+5$ ) the year an establishment is in $L L$ status. Whiskers denote 95% error bands.  \n\nretreat of value-added growth accounts for $11~^{1}/_{2}$ ppts of the $15~^{1}/_{2}$ ppt rebound in the average $L L$ labor share, whereas wages and employment do pick up but contribute only 2 ppts each to the labor share rebound. In other words, there is little contribution coming from a delayed response of employment and wage growth.  \n\n#### 4.6.2  Why Does Value Added Recede?  \n\nUsing the matched price sample, we showed in Section 4.5 that the increase in nominal sales per worker of $L L$ establishments was a product of higher relative prices, not higher physical productivity. Using a similar regression approach, we also find that in the subsequent five years most, but not all, of that jump in the product price premium is reverted. As can be seen in Figure 11, the cumulative change in average product price premium from $t-5$ to $t+5$ is only $7.8\\%$ higher for those establishments that are $L L$ at time $t$ relative to their peers, while it is $16.8\\%$ between $t-5$ and $t$ ; only the initial 16.8 ppt jump is statistically significant. The dynamics of physical productivity over the two horizons are, by contrast, similar in magnitude and are not statistically significant.  \n\n## 5  Did Demand Shocks Become More Important Over Time?  \n\nThe previous section distilled a number of empirical findings that identified the key drivers of the manufacturing labor share decline. First, the increasingly negative co-movement of labor shares and value-added shares at the establishment level was crucial for the decline from the 1980s onward (Findings 1 and 2). Second, using our conceptual framework from Section 3, we provided additional empirical facts pointing to demand factors as the engine of these aforementioned micro-level  \n\n![](images/ad1ce9aeb134e6679a1e813b3614bf3457e7dada7c77c686f72701e26f242db1.jpg)  \nFigure 11: Relative Price Dynamics Dominate Relative Sales Dynamics  \n\nNote: The figure displays the dynamic contributions of the growth in relative prices $\\Delta\\widetilde{p}$ and labor productivity growth $\\Delta(q/l)$ for sales per worker growth $\\widetilde{p q/l}$ of the average $L L$ establishment relative to their peers. The first bars display their cumulative contributions before ( $t-5$ to $t$ ) and after ( $t-5$ to $t+5$ ) the year an establishment is in $L L$ status. Whiskers denote 95% error bands.  \n\ndynamics (Findings 3-5). Can these demand factors be behind not only the micro-level dynamics but also the decline of the labor share in the manufacturing sector? In this section, we provide evidence of significant changes in the micro-level anatomy of labor shares and their components over our sample period. In the context of the conceptual framework of Section 3.2, we contend that these findings are consistent with a rise in the volatility of demand-side factors.  \n\n### 5.1 The V-Shaped Labor Share Pattern Gets Deeper Over Time  \n\nWe start by investigating the evolution over time of the V-shaped labor share pattern of $L L$ establishments that we documented earlier. We repeat the dynamic analysis described by Equations (16) and (17) separately for the 1972 and 1977 censuses, denoted as “1970s,” and the 2007 and 2012 censuses, denoted as “2000s.\" Both unweighted and value-added weighted estimates for these equations are shown in Figure 12.  \n\nFocusing first on the $t-5$ to $t$ dynamics, we find that the labor share dynamics of $L L$ and non- $L L$ establishments get increasingly different over time. In the weighted case, comparing the left and right panels indicates that the diferential increased by 50%, from a relative 14 ppts, on average, in the 1970s to a relative 21 ppts by the 2000s. Our earlier finding that labor share dynamics are very transient, on the other hand, appears to hold over time: between $t-5$ and $t+5$ the (weighted) cumulative differential is about $-2$ ppts in the 1970s versus $^{-3}$ ppts in the 2000s, with neither estimate being statistically different from zero. In the unweighted case, the $t-5$ to $t$ differential is 24 ppts, 0n average, in the 1970s and increases to 33 ppts by the 2000s. Again, most of this difference disappears once we consider a ten-year window centered around year $t$  \n\n![](images/0c69dc598b90d77343cff55e6661b68181382ca3218877911ef6e72dbe72654b.jpg)  \nFigure 12: Labor Share Change of $L L$ versus Non- $L L$ Establishments Over Time  \n\nNote: This figure displays the difference in labor share dynamics between $L L$ andnon- $L L$ establishments (corresponding to the $t-5$ to $t$ bars in the left panel of Figure 9) by year. It shows that $L L$ establishments look strongly different from their peers in the 2000s.  \n\n### 5.2  Employment Has Become More Disconnected from Value Added  \n\nIn Finding 4, we showed that nominal labor productivity was central to understanding the labor share response of $L L$ establishments. By definition, large fuctuations in labor productivity must imply that labor and value added do not move in lockstep. In fact, we show next that the co-movement of employment to output has been markedly different during the recent period of declining manufacturing labor share (2000s) relative to the early part of the sample, when the labor share was more stable (1970s). We repeat the exercise of Section 4.6.1 by estimating Equations (16) and (17) for wages, employment and value added but this time for the early and late samples separately. Figure 13 displays the contributions of these three components to the labor share growthrateof $L L$ establishments relative to non- $L L$ establishments.  \n\n![](images/e508cbb49cbf4f7c0e76e9861e6247532d77e403eb145d7b984a4e7d9140bc5d.jpg)  \nFigure 13: 1970s versus 2000s  \n\nIn the 1970s, the majority of the adjustment in the five-year period preceding census year $t$ was driven by a rise in value added (negative contribution to the labor share): the average $L L$ establishment's labor productivity growth was 40 ppts higher than that of non- $L L$ establishments. The relative change in labor share would have been more pronounced were it not for the fact that employment growth was 10 ppts higher for $L L$ establishments. In the five following years, almost all the labor share growth differential disappears. This occurs mainly due to two factors: a retreat of value added following the time $t$ peak but also a more robust relative response of employment for $L L$ establishments whose hiring seems to respond to the strong value added growth but does so with a delay. This picture is consistent with the notion that hiring frictions delay the employment response of $L L$ establishments, which tie it instead to the longer run dynamics of value added. Ultimately, while the value added of $L L$ establishments has clearly grown more over the ten-year span than that of their peers, relative labor productivity is more or less back to where it was initially because employment and, to a lesser extent, wages catch up with value added.  \n\nThe dynamics in the 2000s are very different at many levels. First, the value-added growth advantage of $L L$ establishments between $t-5$ and $t$ is larger, at 60 ppts instead of 40 ppts in the 1970s. Second, the V-shaped pattern is now more pronounced: not only is the value-added growth differential sharper initially, but after ten years, only 20 ppts remain in the 2000s, compared to 25 ppts in the 1970s. Third, the response of employment is noticeably different from the early part of the sample: between $t-5$ and $t$ , employment growth is 7 ppts lower for $L L$ establishments relative to their non- $L L$ peers despite the sharp increase in value added. By $t+5$ , the cumulative employment growth differential is close to zero.  \n\nTaken together, the findings in this section highlight two significant developments in the dynamics of labor shares at the manufacturing establishment level. First, there has been a deepening over time of the V-shaped labor share pattern of $L L$ establishments that we document in Section 4.6. This is due in large part to a sharper response of value added relative to their peers. In the context of the conceptual framework, this can be interpreted as an increase in the volatility of the demand factors that underlie the micro-level dynamics of the labor share. With such extremely positive demand shocks, $L L$ establishments will find themselves in a very inelastic part of their demand curve, where most of the demand shock is passed through into higher prices rather than into higher employment. This means that our second documented change, the disconnect between value added and labor input, has become stronger over time. This is in line with recent work documenting the decline in the economy's responsiveness to shocks; see, for example Table 5 in Ilut, Kehrig, and Schneider (2014) or the work by Pugsley, Sedlacek, and Sterk (2017); Decker, Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda (2017a,b); Cooper, Haltiwanger, and Willis (2017).  \n\n### 5.3 Discussion  \n\nIn Section 4, we argued that our evidence points toward demand as the main driver of establishmentlevel labor share dynamics. Hence, our finding above, that these dynamics have become more pronounced over time, would hint at demand factors being more volatile recently than they were a few decades ago. But what could be behind these changes? In this section, we offer several potential explanations for this trend.  \n\nA number of developments in the economy have made the customer increasingly important for businesses. First, increasing market integration has raised variety. This has allowed customers to choose from a larger set of products and firms, at a wider geographical scale. As a result of increased market reach, the gains from being the leading frm have become larger and increasingly profitable. In terms of our conceptual framework, this “winner-take-all\" environment is akin to more volatile demand shocks.  \n\nThese potential gains may arguably lead firms to expand additional resources to sell the product that will be highly sought after in the future or to make their customer base more immune to competition. This could include more intensive advertising activity or selling new valuable services along with a product. Ultimately, by making their demand curve less elastic, demand shocks would translate into stronger price increases relative to the physical output and employment responses. In Appendix D.1, we provide evidence that $L L$ establishments spend more on advertising than their peers and its effectiveness seems to have increased over time.  \n\nThis higher volatility of demand shocks would have a number of implications in line with the findings we document earlier. First, we would expect an increasingly negative co-movement between value-added shares and labor shares (Finding 2), accompanied by more pronounced V-shaped labor share dynamics of $L L$ establishments (Finding 5, Figure 12). Second, an increasingly prominent role of demand shocks would mean that firms respond to these shocks less and less by expanding employment while nominal value added is predominantly carried by price increases (Finding 4). This increasing non-responsiveness of employment to demand shocks results in a weakening of the co-movement between employment and value added (Finding 5, Figure 13). This increasing disconnect between profitability shocks that move nominal demand on the one hand, but with a merely lackluster response of employment on the other, is noted in the literature.  \n\nThe increasing volatility of demand shocks raises some interesting questions about where these demand shocks occur. Are they specific to establishments (i.e., the units’ manufacturing specific goods are in high demand)? In other words, do $L L$ establishments within the same firm undergo a V-shaped labor share pattern at the same time? In Appendix C, we show that the V-shaped patterns, their anatomy and their increasing salience are also present at the firm level. While a more thorough analysis of this dimension is beyond the scope of this paper, this evidence has significant implications. For one, it confrms that our findings are not just the byproduct of measurement error at the establishment level. More importantly, it indicates that the demand factors driving labor share dynamics more likely occur at the firm level. They could stem, for example, from brand power or from the propagation of demand shocks through the vertically integrated structure of the firm.  \n\n## 6 Conclusion  \n\nA large literature has recently documented and studied the decline in the labor share, both at the national and sectoral levels. In this paper, we dissect the underlying dynamics behind this phenomenon by using establishment-level data for the U.S. manufacturing sector between 1967 and 2012. We frst document a startling fact: while the manufacturing labor share declined by almost 5 ppts per decade starting in the early 1980s, the labor share of the median establishment rose over the same time period. We find that this apparent disconnect is due to a drastic reallocation of economic activity toward the lower end of the labor share distribution. We show that this was not driven by entry/exit or compositional forces but instead by establishments whose labor share fell as they grew in size.  \n\nWe then highlight a number of additional micro-level empirical facts. In particular, we show that low labor-share $(L L)$ establishments are characterized by high revenue labor productivity, not low wages, and charge higher prices than their peers for similar products. Moreover, we find that $L L$ status is very transient, a pattern that has become more pronounced over time. In the context of a simple conceptual framework, we conclude that among the leading theories proposed in the literature to explain the decline in the manufacturing labor share, only demand factors are consistent with all of our empirical findings.  \n\nThese findings, taken as a whole, provide a guide for researchers intent on understanding and modeling the forces that underlie the decline in the manufacturing labor share in particular and establishment- or firm-level dynamics in general.  \n\n## References  \n\nDaron Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo.

They are both mail-back surveys and cover the U.S. manufacturing sector (NAICS 31-33) at the establishment level, where an establishment is defined as a distinct unit of a manufacturing frm where the predominant activity is production. Data are collected in 1963 and subsequently in years ending in 2 and 7 since 1967. Some key variables on labor compensation are missing in the 1963 Census, so we drop that year.  \n\nIn principle, the Census covers all existing 300-350k establishments in the manufacturing sector. We only consider those establishments that are not administrative records and are in the “tabbed sample,” a distinction Census started in 2002. Non-tabbed establishments are considered by Census to be not really active and thus excluded from publicly available tabulations (hence the name \"tabbed\"). We follow Census in their assessment of these establishments as not really contributing to economic activity and drop them.  \n\nThe data carry a wide array of variables only some of which are of interest for this project. These are data on sales, inventories, intermediate and energy inputs, employment and hours, salaries, wages and ancillary labor costs, capital stocks and investment. The following sections describe how observed variables are used to construct measures needed for our analysis. In principle, the labor share is the ratio of total labor costs (described in Section A.3) and value added (described in Section A.4).  \n\n#### A.2 Identifying Establishments, Firms and Industries  \n\nALL establishments carry an identifier, LBDNUM $^{19}$ , which stays with the establishment from its birth to its death. That variable is available as a consistent identifier throughout all years.20 In addition to that, every establishment carries a frm identifier, FIRMID, which owns the establishment.21 Unlike the LBDNUM, the FIRMID may change over time, especially when a frm transitions from a single-unit to a multi-unit firm and vice versa (see Dent, Pugsley, and Wheeler (2018)). We account for that possibility when we study firm-level dynamics.  \n\nWe identify an establishment's industry from its SIC code (until 1996) and then its NAICS code. We map SIC codes into NAICS codes as in Kehrig (2011) and consider only establishments active in manufacturing industries (NAICS code 311111 through 339999). This entails first correcting for erroneous industry classifications 1972 to 1986 according to the list on p. 222 in Davis, Haltiwanger, and Schuh (1996). Then, SIC-72 codes were mapped into SIC-87 codes. In case of non-unique mappings, we settle on the SIC-87 industry which captures most of the employment of the SIC-72 industry. SIC-87 industries are mapped into NAICS industries using concordance files provided by the Census Bureau. Whenever this mapping didn't produce a unique industry code, we used an establishment's NAICS code as sampled rather than the one implied by the SIC-NAICS concordance. Discrepancies may occur between the two when establishments predominantly tasked with corporate activities were initially labeled as a manufacturing and later as a services establishment. Picking the sampled NAICS code (and dropping non-manufacturing establishments) makes our procedure similar in spirit to that in Fort and Klimek (2018), although these authors deal with that matter (and other problems) more comprehensively than we do. Note that some of these industry changes from manufacturing to services may actually be legitimate because establishments that used to perform predominantly production activities may transition into a support-activity establishment. As a robustness check, we also use their industry codes to verify our main findings. Both our industry way to consistently identify industry codes as well as the Fort-Klimek codes yield similar results for labor share dynamics even though Fort and Klimek (2018) document strong differences for employment dynamics.  \n\n#### A.3  Measuring Labor Compensation  \n\nLabor costs in the Census data consist of three parts: salaries and wages (item Sw), which comprise both wages of production workers as well as the salaries of non-production workers. Production workers comprise employees up to and including the line-supervisor level engaged in the core manufacturing activities, such as fabricating, processing, assembling, inspecting, receiving, packing, warehousing, maintenance, repair, janitorial and guard services and record keeping. Nonproduction workers, in contrast, are employees above line-supervisor level which comprises executive, purchasing, professional and technical sales, logistics, advertising, credit, clerical and routine office functions. The third portion are ancillary labor costs, which can broadly be interpreted as benefits. Benefits contain involuntary labor costs (item ILc) such as mandatory state pension fund contributions, unemployment insurance or social security contributions netted out from wages. Voluntary labor costs (item VLc) comprise health, additional voluntary retirement contributions and other benefits paid to employees. We denote their sum by the variable Lc.  \n\nTo properly measure an establishment's labor share, we have to sum up the compensation of all employees that help generate the establishment's value added. In principle, this is what Census attempts to do. Yet, it is not certain that all temporary help services or leased employment, were captured in the earlier Census years before 2002. In the past decades, leasing workers rather than employing them full-time has become increasingly popular in U.S. manufacturing (see Dey, Houseman, and Polivka (2012); Houseman (2018)). To accommodate this trend, Census decided in 2002 to sample permanent and leased employment separately. Before then, no specific instructions were given to establishment whether or not to include leased employment in their compensation variables. Given this discrepancy, Census has studied the before/after patterns of employment and labor costs; they concluded that the majority of establishments interpreted the question to include all types of workers and their compensation. If this assessment is correct, our labor share measures would capture all labor costs throughout the sample period. Otherwise, we would be missing a portion of the labor compensation before 2002 and therefore underestimate establishment-level labor shares in that early time period. Given Census's before/after analysis, this possible missing labor compensation is likely small. Yet, even if one were to assume that it is significant, the underestimation of pre-2002 labor costs would imply that the actual fall in the manufacturing labor share would be even more pronounced than what we currently report and analyze. Hence, we can view our empirical results as a lower bound on the manufacturing labor share decline.  \n\nTo summarize, we measure labor compensation as follows:  \n\n·Before 2002: $\\mathrm{SW}~+~\\mathrm{LC}$ , which supposedly comprises salaries, wages and benefits for botl permanent and leased employees;  \n\n·2002:SW_NL $^+$ BENEFIT_NL $^+$ SW_L $^+$ BENEFIT_L. The first two terms consist of salaries, wages and benefits for permanent (non-leased) employees; the latter two consist of their analogues for temporary (leased) employment.  \n\n· 2007 and later: S $\\mathrm{\\Delta\\Psi}+\\mathrm{\\DeltaBENEFIT{\\Delta}+\\Delta C T E M F}$ . The first two terms consist of salaries, wages and benefits for permanent employees only (note how SW now captures a subset of what it used to capture before 2002); the last term combines all compensation for temporary (leased) employment. (In 2007 and later, Census does not parse out the cost of leased employment into salaries, wages and benefits as it did in 2002).  \n\nWhat is missing from labor compensation is compensation in assets such as stock options. While that type of compensation is taxed as labor income when the option is exercised, it is not recorded as labor compensation when the stock option is given. Though this is likely to bias our labor cost and thus our labor share measure downward, we think that bias is small given that only executives are given stock options.22 Another portion of labor income that is missing is proprietary income. If a lot of the labor share decline was due to more and more labor compensation for entrepreneurs funneled as income, we would likely see a strong difference in the labor share by legal form of organization. In particular, we would expect a stronger decline of the labor share for private firms or \"S corporations.\" This is, however, not the case in manufacturing. We conclude that neither stock options nor proprietary income are a likely cause of the manufacturing labor share decline.  \n\nComponents of labor compensation The labor cost variable used in the numerator of the labor share contains various components. In the Census data, it is possible to distinguish between production worker wages, salaries for non-production workers as well as ancillary labor costs. A natural theory of the labor share decline could be skill-biased technical change which likely would disproportionately hurt a particular type of labor. If robots and production labor were substitutes, then one would expect capital-embodied technical change reduce the portion of labor compensation going to production labor. Skilled workers are likely more complementary to capital, so their salaries should not be as affected.  \n\nProduction worker wages include the wage bill of all employees engaged in the core manufacturing activities, such as fabricating, processing, assembling, inspecting, receiving, packing, warehousing, maintenance, repair, janitorial and guard services and record keeping. Salaries of nonproduction workers refer instead to the compensation of all employees above line-supervisor level; it comprises executive, purchasing, professional and technical sales, logistics, advertising, credit, clerical and routine office functions. Finally, the ancillary labor costs comprise legally-required labor costs (such as social security tax, unemployment tax, workmen's compensation insurance and state disability insurance pension plans) as well as voluntary labor costs (such as health benefits, life insurance premiums, supplemental unemployment compensation and deferred profit sharing plans).  \n\nWe investigate whether these three components declined symmetrically. This question is important as some theories of the labor share decline such as deunionization or the automation of routine jobs would be expected to have a disproportionately large impact on the wages of production workers, while affecting to a lesser degree the two other components. Other theories such as a change in the competitive landscape would likely have a more symmetric effect on all three labor share components that are shown in Figure A.1 and Table A.1:  \n\n$$\n\\lambda_{t}=\\underbrace{\\underbrace{w_{t}^{p w}L_{t}^{p w}}_{Y_{t}}}_{\\mathrm{Wage~bill}}+\\underbrace{\\frac{w_{t}^{n p w}L_{t}^{n p w}}{Y_{t}}}_{\\mathrm{Salaries}}+\\underbrace{\\frac{w_{t}^{b e n}L_{t}^{b e n}}{Y_{t}}}_{\\mathrm{Ancill.~labor~costs}}.\n$$  \n\nWe find that the compensation of production workers declines secularly, by about 4.6 ppt per decade, mirroring the average rate of decline of the overall labor share. However, while the manufacturing labor share stays roughly constant until the early 1980s, the compensation of production workers declines steadily since the beginning of our dataset in the late 1960s. In fact, once the downward trend in the overall labor share starts in the early 1980s, the compensation decline for production workers slows down slightly. All in all, had the wage bill of production workers as a share of value added not declined at all, the manufacturing labor share would have stayed more or less constant (-0.3 ppt per decade).  \n\n![](images/82b99dc38c2863ce368c84e9810c28b063341b16636afb5e5f36a94698ef7f88.jpg)  \nFigure A.1: Dynamics of Labor Share Components   \nNote: This figure displays three portions of manufacturing labor compensation: wages of production workers, salaries of non-production workers and total ancillary labor costs such as unemployment insurance and health benefits. The secular decline of the production worker wage bill was first compensated by a rise in the ancillary labor compensation until the early 1980s when all three portions start to decline.  \n\nThe compensation for non-production labor, in contrast, is steady at first and then starts to decline after 1982 but not as strongly as that of production labor. If the compensation for nonproduction labor had stayed constant rather than declining at 1.2 ppt per decade, the manufacturing labor share would have only declined by 3.7 ppt per decade instead of 4.9 ppt. Ancillary labor costs display the opposite pattern: they push the manufacturing labor share up by almost one percentage point per decade. In the early decades of our data, the increase in the ancillary labor costs and salaries offset the decline in production worker wages, thus leaving the manufacturing labor share constant until 1982. Beyond that point, the ancillary labor costs decline only slightly. Had they not dampened the overall decline of labor compensation, the manufacturing labor share decline would have been stronger at 5.8 ppt per decade instead of the observed 4.9 ppt decline.  \n\nTable A.1: Dynamics of Labor Share Components per Decade   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Component</td><td>1967-2007</td><td>1967-1982</td><td>1982-2007</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturing labor share</td><td>(percentage point changes) -4.9</td><td>-0.9</td><td>-7.3</td></tr><tr><td>Production worker wages</td><td>-4.6</td><td>-4.9</td><td>-4.4</td></tr><tr><td>Non-production worker salaries</td><td>-1.2</td><td>+0.4</td><td>-2.2</td></tr><tr><td>Ancillary labor costs</td><td>+0.9</td><td>+3.6</td><td>-0.7</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNote: Results from the shift-share decompositions as defined in (19) applied to the three types of labor compensation listed in Equation (18). The acceleration of the labor share decline almost exclusively stems from a more negative within-group adjustment term in salaries and ancillary labor costs suggesting that all types of labor suffer.  \n\n#### A.4 Measuring Value Added  \n\nWe measure value added in the Census data as sales (item Tvs) less inventory investment for final (difference between FIE and FIB) and work-in-progress goods (diference between WIE and WIB), resales (item CR), material inputs (sum of items CP, CW and MIB less MIE) and energy expenditures (sum of items CF and EE). This procedure refines the definition of value added vis-a-vis the previous literature using the standard Census definition in two ways:  \n\n1. Materials use is corrected for adjustment of materials inventory.   \n2. Industry-year-specific measures of purchased services are added to intermediate input use.  \n\nBoth steps bring our measure closer to the value actually added by the establishment as a manufa.cturer.  \n\nad 1. Constructing value added requires subtraction of all materials inputs regardless if they were purchased in the same period or came out of the materials inventory. Failure to do so would make value added too volatile over time and too dispersed across establishments because it would include a portion of unmeasured fuctuations in intermediate inputs.23 Since value added plays an important role in the dynamics and aggregation of labor shares, this matters.   \nad 2. The Census of Manufactures samples intermediate energy and material inputs as well as contract work, but information about an establishment's purchased services is absent. This makes value added too large and the labor share too low. As a consequence, the raw aggregate manufacturing labor share in Census data is about 14 ppt lower than its BLS counterpart in 1967. Importantly, this discrepancy gets worse over time because outsourcing of nonmanufacturing activity and purchased services grew substantially over the past decades. As a result, the raw aggregate manufacturing labor share in Census data is 20 ppts lower than its BLS counterpart in 2012, thus overstating the decline in the manufacturing labor share.  \n\nWe therefore subtract the industry-year-specific ratio of purchased services to sales from establishment sales. $24$ This avoids outsourcing contaminating our measure of the labor share and its time series behavior, but it does not impact within-industry reallocation dynamics because that correction is identical for $\\mathrm{a}L L$ establishments in a given industry and year. Correcting for the increasing prevalence of purchased services in this way reduces the overall difference between Census and BLS manufacturing labor shares to 8 ppt, a gap that remains stable over time (see Figure A.2).  \n\n![](images/44ba8f267353adf597a5d9aee066f2c7337b0a0e75ea79b5c1f3e766832ab686.jpg)  \nFigure A.2: The Labor Share in U.S. Manufacturing   \nNote: The solid black line (left scale) represents the manufacturing labor share $\\lambda_{t}$ in the Census panel as calculated in Equation (1); the thin grey line with balls represents the labor share in the manufacturing sector as calculated from BLS data.  \n\n#### A.5  Constructing the Matched Price Sample  \n\nWe are grateful to Kirk White from the U.S. Census Bureau for aiding with the Product Trailer, especially with the edit-in flags.  \n\nWe combine the product trailers to the Census of Manufactures into a panel of close to nine million product-establishment-year observations. Of these, we keep only observations, in which the variables product value shipped (item Pv) and product quantity shipped (item PQs) are populated and where the latter variable has a meaningful interpretation, say short tons of aluminum sheets or cubic feet of liquefied gas rather than number of vehicles. Census defines a product based on a 10-digit code whose first six digit refer to the 6-digit NAICS industry code. With each of these industries, Census provides a detailed definition of products about which firms have to report product-level sales and - when applicable - the physical quantity produced and shipped.  \n\nOnly about 130 thousand year-establishment-product observations have that information; similar to the procedure in Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson (2008), even though these authors limit attention to 6-digit NAICS industries with homogeneous products, we consider a broader set of multi-product establishments, as long as these products have a well-defined notion of quantity (metric tons of chemicals, ..)  \n\nIn addition to that, we limit attention to observations that are not imputed in a way that would change the empirical variance of the PV or the PQs distributions. Census uses an array of criteria to delete originally reported data when they fail certain reasonability tests. These values are then replaced by imputed data where an algorithm chooses from about a dozen different imputation methods the one which mostly likely replicates the correct aggregates. White, Reiter, and Petrin (2018) have developed an improved method that changes imputations to not only correctly replicate aggregates but also preserves the cross-sectional distribution. We have not obtained their toolbox yet but plan to do so in the future. This means that for now, we have to rely on observations that are not imputed in a way that would change the cross-sectional distribution. These are labeled by the following edit-in flags that consist of three letters:  \n\n· R_-: Any observation starting with R denotes reported values. Of these, we keep those that were not replaced with an imputed value, in particular:  \n\n- RC: analyst correction of reported value,   \nRG: goldplated observation (due to analyst information “known\" to be of such high quality that any imputation would worsen data quality),   \n- RN: reported value just corrected for obvious rounding errors;   \n- RO: override imputation with establishment-specific information (say, information obtained in a phone call);   \n- RU: preserve reported value due to inability to perform imputation;   \n- RZ: reported zero which is acceptable.  \n\n· _C-: any observation with C in the middle - whether originally reported (observations that start with R) or not reported and then filled in by information through other means such as follow-up phone calls (observations that start with a blank value) - refers to values that have been corrected by an analyst using establishment-specific information. · Observations that start with a C should not occur according to the Census system of editin fags. We assume that the roughly twenty thousand observations in 1992 and 1997 are erroneously coded and mean to start with a blank and should be _c.  \n\nOne limitation of that approach is that we are constrained to data since 1992 as observations in the product trailer do not carry edit-in fags prior to that year. White (2014) has recovered these fags from the raw datafle that are not accessible to RDC researchers at this point, but we hope to obtain them in the future, so we can extend our analysis back to 1977. At this point, we are left with about 130 thousand usable and non-imputed product-year-establishment prices which aggregate up to about 41 thousand establishments, so the typical establishments produces and sells on average a bit more than three products. Prices at the 10-digit NAICS product level are finally constructed by dividing PV by PQS.  \n\nComparison Full Census Sample vs. Matched Price Samples  We study the differences in sales per worker between the Full Census Sample and the Matched Price Sample in which we observe product prices and quantities separately. The objective is to show that in the Matched Price Sample, the same cross-sectional patterns of sales per worker vis-a-vis the labor share and the dynamic differences of sales per worker growth between $L L$ andNon- $L L$ establishments exist.  \n\nIn order to produce Figure A.3, we run a non-parametric regression analogous to Equation (12) of relative sales per worker on the labor share in both the Full Census Sample and the more homogeneous Matched Price Sample. Even though the relative differences of sales per worker might not be as pronounced in the latter, the relationship between relative sales per worker and the labor share look very similar across the two samples. Only at very low labor shares are sales per worker in the Matched Price Sample significantly lower than those in the full panel, but the differences with other establishments remain stark. For example, establishments with a labor share of 10 ppt still generate generate 1.7 times $(\\exp(0.53)\\approx1.7\\$ ) more sales with the same workforce than the average establishment. In the Full Census Sample this number is 2.3.  \n\n![](images/868632ee383574a8a4f3c5e6fc2482dc6872193983f70300cd0862e48b0648de.jpg)  \nFigure A.3: Relative Sales per Worker in the Full Census Sample vs. the Matched Price Sample   \nNote: The left panel in the figure depicts the cross-sectional differences in relative sales per worker $\\overset{\\cdot}{p q/l}$ against the labor share in the Full Census Sample (dark grey line) and the Matched Price Sample (light grey line). Dashed lines denote $95\\%$ error bands. The right panel displays the cumulative growth of relative sales/worker $\\Delta(\\widetilde{p q/l})$ of $L L$ establishments in both samples. Whiskers denote $95\\%$ error bands.  \n\nIn the right panel of Figure A.3 we display the relative sales-per-worker dynamics of $L L$ establishments versus Non- $L L$ establishments. The approach is analogous to (16) and (17): we regress the growth rate of sales per worker, $\\Delta(\\widetilde{p q/l})$ , on a dummy variable that equals one if establishment $i$ is an $L L$ establishment. This regression is done in both the Full Census and the Matched Price Sample, with the intention of studying how much the sales-per-worker dynamics differ the in the two samples. In the Full Census Sample, sales per worker of $L L$ establishments jump relative to the Non- $L L$ establishments by $21\\%$ during the five years preceding the year in which they become $L L$ . In the subsequent five years, more than two thirds of that relative sales growth is erased and the 10-year differential growth rate is only 6.7% more for $L L$ vs Non- $L L$ establishments. Over the entire time span, the estimates for the Full Census Panel show a significantly different sales per worker trajectory for $L L$ establishments than for Non- $L L$ establishments.  \n\nThe evidence in the Matched Price Sample exhibits a similar qualitative pattern. Unsurprisingly, the magnitudes are smaller because the establishments in the Matched Price Sample are much more homogeneous than in the Full Census Sample. In the five years preceding an establishment's $L L$ status, sales per worker grow by $12.5\\%$ more for $L L$ establishments and revert to about 5% in the subsequent five years. Due to the smaller sample, these estimates are noisier for the Matched Price sample.  \n\n## B Defining $L L$ Establishments  \n\n### B.1 Choosing the Cutoff  \n\nThis section considers the selection criteria for the $L L$ establishments that underlie the dynamic analysis in Sections 4 and 5. While any choice of a cutoff is to a certain degree arbitrary, our aim is to isolate the portion of the labor share distribution that plays a central role in the manufacturing labor share decline. In Figure B.1, we plot the manufacturing labor share once we leave out establishments as the bottom 20%, $10\\%$ ,5%and $1\\%$ in a given industry and year.  \n\n![](images/6768c425f607e2ece0b8444ac225cc71b21ba1bbb8e34155753c73e94fce83ac.jpg)  \nFigure B.1: The Manufacturing Labor Share without Differently Defined $L L$ Establishments  \n\nAs the figure makes it clear, picking a labor share cutoff of $20\\%$ in a given 3-digit NAICS industry implies that the remaining $80\\%$ of establishments has a stagnant labor share. Any trend estimate is insignificantly different from zero. Choosing a more restrictive cutoff of $10\\%$ labor shares, however, shows that the manufacturing labor share of the $90\\%$ Non- $L L$ establishments declines by 6 ppt. This means that establishments between the 10th and 20th percentile contribute materially to the manufacturing labor share decline. Not counting them as $L L$ establishments would lead us to miss some quantitatively relevant dynamics. This is even more evident if only the bottom $5\\%$ of establishments are define as $L L$ ; the manufacturing labor share decline among their complementary set of Non- $L L$ establishments would be 10 ppts.  \n\n### B.2  Permanent versus Transitory $L L$ Establishments  \n\nIn Section 4.6, we showed that $L L$ establishments are largely a temporary phenomenon and that their labor shares display a V-shaped pattern in the years surrounding the time they are in the lowest quintile of labor shares in a given industry. Obviously, some of the $L L$ establishments do have a permanently low labor share and are among the $L L$ establishments for several Census years in a row, while others display an even more volatile labor share. We want to understand the role of “permanent” versus “\"transitory” $L L$ establishments. Since the former tend to be larger and thus more relevant for aggregates, we want to ensure that the “temporary $L L$ establishments,”’ those characterized by the V-shaped pattern of Figure 9, play a significant role for the manufacturing labor share decline.  \n\nTo that end, we partition the set of $L L$ establishments in period $t$ into those that are an $L L$ establishment from $t-5$ to $t+5$ , denoted “permanent $L L$ ;” and the rest, denoted “temporary $L L$ ”. When we drop both temporary and permanent $L L$ establishments from the sample, the manufacturing labor share has a much higher level and stagnates. This shows that $L L$ establishments are essential to understanding the manufacturing labor share decline; see the light grey line in Figure B.2. When we instead only drop the permanent $L L$ establishments, however, the counterfactual labor share dynamics do not look markedly different: while the level is somewhat higher by definition (these are, after all, low-labor share establishments), the overall decline is similar in magnitude to that of the actual labor share. This confirms that temporary $L L$ establishments play an important role for the manufacturing labor share level and its decline.  \n\n![](images/691ff6bd6245d4e0dcac044dbdfb9bd82a8c27c8f678ba319f72cc12204c169a.jpg)  \nFigure B.2: The Role of Temporary and Permanent $L L$ Establishments  \n\n### B.3  The Magnitude of Sales Spikes  \n\nThe V-Shaped pattern documented in Section 4.6 implied that $L L$ establishments on average experience a 18 ppt drop in their labor share. In this subsection, we show that the magnitude of the sales increases that is consistent with that impact is sensible.  \n\nConsider the growth rate of establishment $i$ 's labor share:  \n\n$$\n\\Delta\\log\\lambda_{i t}=\\Delta\\log W_{i t}+\\Delta\\log L_{i t}-\\Delta\\log(P_{i t}Y_{i t}).\n$$  \n\nAs we show in Figures 6 and 10 of the paper, $L L$ establishments achieve a lower labor share through a stark increase in value added, $P Y$ , while leaving wages, $W$ , and employment, $L$ , almost unchanged. A drop in the labor share by 18 ppt (weighted estimates in Figure 9) corresponds to a growth rate of $-46.3\\%$ which is almost entirely explained by the increase in value added (growth of $45.3\\%$ )  \n\nWhile a value added growth rate of 45.3% may sound suspiciously large at frst, we show next that it is in fact reasonable. As a first step, consider that value added is defined as:  \n\nNote that the level of value added is additive in sales and materials, so their growth rates are not additive. Thus, one has to multiply sales growth and materials growth by their share in value added. In our data, sales of $L L$ establishments is 2.57 times as large as value added on average, while materials use is 1.57 times as large. When we repeat the estimation of Equations (16) and (17) in the paper (V-shaped regressions) for the sales and materials growth rates of $L L$ establishments relative to their peers, we estimate that their sales to increase by $19.1\\%$ , while their intermediate input use increases by only $2.4\\%$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\underbrace{\\Delta\\log{\\lambda_{i t}^{L L}}}_{\\mathrm{-46.3\\%}}=\\underbrace{\\Delta\\log{W_{i t}^{L L}}}_{\\mathrm{-1\\%}}+\\underbrace{\\Delta\\log{L_{i t}^{L L}}}_{\\approx0\\mathrm{\\%}}-\\underbrace{\\Delta\\log{P_{i t}^{L L}}Y_{i t}^{L L}}_{\\mathrm{45.3\\%}}}\\ &{=\\underbrace{\\Delta\\log{W_{i t}^{L L}}}_{\\mathrm{-1\\%}}+\\underbrace{\\Delta\\log{L_{i t}^{L L}}}_{\\approx0\\mathrm{\\%}}-\\underbrace{\\Delta\\log(S a l e s_{i t}^{L L}-I n t_{i t}^{L L})}_{\\mathrm{45.3\\%}}}\\ &{=\\underbrace{\\Delta\\log{W_{i t}^{L L}}}_{\\mathrm{-1\\%}}+\\underbrace{\\Delta\\log{L_{i t}^{L L}}}_{\\approx0\\mathrm{\\%}}-\\underbrace{\\Delta\\log{S a l e s_{i t}^{L L}}}_{\\mathrm{19.1\\%}\\mathrm{\\sum_{\\hat{\\nu}_{i t}^{2}\\in\\mathbb{Z}}}}\\underbrace{S a l e s_{i t}^{L L}}_{\\mathrm{24\\%}\\mathrm{\\sum_{\\hat{\\nu}_{i t}^{2}}}}+\\underbrace{\\Delta\\log{I n t_{i t}^{L L}}\\frac{I n t_{i t}}{P_{i t}^{L L}Y_{i t}^{L L}}}_{\\mathrm{24\\%\\log{x}\\mathrm{1.5\\%}}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThis means that, in order to explain the admittedly strong growth in value added of $46.3\\%$ , sales only have to increase by $19.1\\%$ . Moreover, it is important to remember that these values correspond to growth rates over five-year periods; the annualized growth rate is only about $3.5\\%$ . We see it as plausible that $L L$ establishments grow their sales $3.5\\%$ faster per year than their Non- $L L$ peers to achieve their low labor share over a five-year span.  \n\n## Establishments vs. Firms  \n\nIn this section, we study the labor share at the level of the firm. Two considerations motivate this analysis. First, we showed that price dynamics are responsible for a large share of sales-per-worker and labor-share dynamics at the establishment level. If these prices are transfer prices across establishments within the same firm rather than market sales prices, the labor share of firms will likely be much more smooth regardless of their labor share level. Second, if the price and productivity drivers of the labor share derive from firm factors such as brand power or superior management practices, then establishments likely sort into the firms along labor share. $L L$ establishments, in particular, would sort into the same firms, which would then become $L L$ firms. Labor shares of firms that operate mostly $L L$ establishments should then exhibit the same V-shaped pattern that we observe for the $L L$ establishments in Figure 9. If $L L$ establishments are evenly distributed across firms, however, we would expect frm-level labor shares to be much more smooth and as establishment-level labor share dynamics get diversified away by the firm.  \n\nTo that end, we aggregate labor cost and value added across $\\mathrm{a}L L$ establishments within the same firm (defined by FIRMID) to compute frm-level labor shares. In principle, FIRMIDs stay with the same firms, but we follow Dent, Pugsley, and Wheeler (2018) to correct false identifier changes (say, after a frm changes legal form or transitions from single-unit to multi-unit firm) and indicate changes where there should be one (say, after mergers and acquisitions). This correction will only matter for the dynamic analysis, where we have to follow firms over time. Following other research, we break firms along their 3-digit NAICS industry codes to avoid subsectoral differences drive labor shares of extremely diversified firms.25  \n\n### C.1  The Reallocation of Value Added across Firms  \n\nIn what follows, we repeat the main empirical exercises from Section 4 but at the frm instead of establishment level. Comparisons between these two levels of aggregation can teach us about the nature of labor share dynamics. For example, if we fail to detect significant reallocation of economic activity towards low-labor share firms, then we would conclude that reallocation is mostly a withinfirm phenomenon.  \n\n![](images/cbd5730293e2b67b39c9d4cae663e309603e68ee2c78cd61047fbec757598ec2.jpg)  \nFigure C.1: The Reallocation of Value Added between Firms   \nNote: This figure depicts the firm-level evidence analogously to Figures 1 and 3 (right column).  \n\nThe firm-level reallocation displayed in Figure C.1 shows an overall pattern that is similar to the establishment-level reallocation that was depicted in 3: in 1967, more than half of value added is being produced by firms with a labor share between 50 and 80 ppts, while there is little output accounted for by firms with a very low labor share. By 2012, in contrast, most of value added has been reallocated to low-labor share firms. Specifically, half of manufacturing value added is being produced by firms with a labor share of less than 37 ppts; the analog number for establishments was 32 ppts. So even if the reallocation is not as dramatic as it is for establishments, it remains very strong. We conclude that most of the reallocation of value added takes place between rather than within firms.  \n\n### C.2  The Joint Dynamics of Labor Share and Value Added  \n\nNext, we analyze the role of compositional changes in driving the firm-level reallocation, as we did in 4.3.2 for establishments. While we found that neither differential labor share dynamics by size (the big-player scenario) nor differential growth by labor share (the superstar scenario) played a role at the establishment level, this may yet be true at the firm level. For example, superstar firms may very well drive the manufacturing labor share decline even if only a subset of their establishments are $L L$ establishments, as long as this set rotates within the firm.  \n\nSimilar to our exercises in Section 4.3.2, we construct counterfactual manufacturing labor share measures $\\lambda_{t}^{B I G}$ and $\\lambda_{t}^{S T A R}$ based on frm-level labor and market shares. If the dynamics of these counterfactual labor shares, which are plotted in Figure C.2, were identical to the actual labor share, then the hypothesis that large firms or superstar firms drive the manufacturing labor share decline might have empirical support. In that case, compositional changes at the frm level would play a role even though they do not across establishments.  \n\nThe counterfactual labor shares in Figure C.2 look quite similar to their establishment-level counterparts in Figure 5: there is no contribution from firms with an initially low labor share (the initial superstars) and only a very limited contribution of initially large frms. Firms that were already large in $1982^{26}$ lowered their labor share enough to make the manufacturing labor share decline by 7 ppts, which is about 3 ppts more than the contributions of initially large establishments, but still far from the 21 ppt-decline in the actual manufacturing labor share. For the superstar counterfactual, we again observe an increase in the counterfactual labor share, suggesting that firms with initially low labor shares did not experience strong enough growth to contribute to the manufacturing labor share decline on their own.  \n\n![](images/480979901600cde2afdc85901c1256b7592181feb20d813220a47a610fe44a59.jpg)  \nFigure C.2: The Limited Role of Big Firms or Superstar Firms   \nNote: This figure depicts the firm-level evidence analogously to Figure 5.  \n\n### C.3  The V-Shape Labor Share Dynamics of $L L$ Firms  \n\nPerhaps one of the most important - and most surprising - findings of Section 4 was the V-shaped labor share pattern of $L L$ establishments. Labor shares are typically low for a period of five to eight years, and about almost 60% of $L L$ establishments are no longer $L L$ establishments five years later. In theory, it is not obvious that the same pattern should hold at the level of the firm. For example, imagine a firm whose establishments alternate in $L L$ status: half of them experience in period $t$ temporary demand shocks specific to the products they produce, while for the other half this occurs at $t+5$ . Alternatively, this rotating pattern may occur if a vertically or horizontally integrated firm shifts profits from one establishment to another using transfer prices, possibly for tax purposes. In both cases, the V-shaped labor share pattern of establishments would wash out at the firm level. On the other hand, demand shocks may instead stem from a shift in the firm's marketing strategy or brand appeal. In that case, labor shares across establishments within the same firm would be positively correlated, and $L L$ firms, like their establishments, would exhibit a V-shaped labor share pattern.  \n\nIn order to assess these within-firm dynamics, we define “ $L L$ firms\" analogously to $L L$ establishments: their labor share is in the lowest quintile of the firm's industry in a given year. We then repeat the analysis of (16) and (17) for these $L L$ firms and show them in Figure C.3.  \n\nClearly, the V-shaped pattern is still present for $L L$ firms even though its magnitude (14.5 ppts) is slightly smaller than for $L L$ establishments (18 ppts). The rebound is also similar: between $t-5$ and $t+5$ , the labor share of a time- $t$ $L L$ firm falls by a mere 3.1 ppts relative to that of its peers (2.6 ppts for $L L$ establishments). For the unweighted estimates (not disclosed), the V-shapes of $L L$ establishments and $L L$ frms look equally large. This leads us to two conclusions: First, withinfirm reallocation dynamics are not the main cause of the V-shape documented above.27 Second,  \n\n![](images/52267c7460c67568ec2dddde5a82febf7e5d2c498ef3b1b8e29f52ec7ca62d50.jpg)  \nFigure C.3: Labor Share Dynamics of $L L$ Firms  \n\n$L L$ status across tends to co-move positively across establishments within the same firm.  \n\n### C.4  The Dominant Role of Value Added  \n\nNext, we study the relative dynamics of the components of the labor share of $L L$ firms, analogously to the exercise of Section 4.6.1. Figure C.4 shows that value added dominates the dynamics of firm-level labor shares, in line with the establishment-level evidence of Figure 10.  \n\n![](images/4970ba58c0e6fd3cb5030e20e0b5dbeb160906548c5ad337d466e51aebeece52.jpg)  \nNote: This figure depicts the firm-level evidence analogously to Figure 9.   \nFigure C.4: Wage, Employment and Value Added Dynamics of $L L$ Firms  \n\nNote: This figure depicts the firm-level evidence analogously to Figure 10.  \n\n### C.5 Did Firm-Level Shocks Become More Volatile over Time?  \n\nLastly, we repeat the analysis of Section 5 on frm data.  \n\nThe deepening V-Shape of $L L$ firms Figure C.5 shows that similar to the evidence for establishments, firm-level V-shapes have also become deeper over time. While the typical $L L$ firm dropped its labor share by 11 ppts in the 1970s relative to its peers (14 ppts for $L L$ establishments), this became a 16.6 ppts drop in the 2000s (21 ppts for $L L$ establishments). Again, while the firm dynamics are slightly more muted, they are qualitatively and quantitatively very comparable to those of establishments.  \n\n![](images/8ff3be1b8118935f43961de4e564d0e3191c8d69d59978344e4f3a7642421f3a.jpg)  \nFigure C.5: The Deepening of the V-Shape of $L L$ Firms   \nNote: This figure depicts the firm-level evidence analogously to Figure 12.  \n\nThe increasing disconnect between value added and employment  Looking at the evolution of the labor share component dynamics, we can see in Figure C.6 that, in the 1970s, hiring helped buffer the negative contribution of value added to the labor share of $L L$ firms and used to significantly contribute to the subsequent rebound. In the 2000s, in contrast, relative employment would on average fall for $L L$ firms, though the point estimate is not statistically significant.  \n\nIn sum, the evidence in this appendix shows that the findings documented in the main body of the paper are not specific to establishments but instead carry through when the analysis is performed with firm data. This indicates that the forces, factors and shocks underlying micro-level labor share dynamics are most likely taking place at the level of the firm.  \n\n## D Robustness on the Importance of Demand  \n\nIn this appendix, we carry out some robustness check about our empirical fndings.  \n\n### D.1  Corroborating Evidence: The Importance of Advertising for Demand  \n\nIn Sections 4.2-4.5, we have used our conceptual framework to identify demand factors as the only class of shocks that is consistent with all the empirical micro-level facts we documented. While that is helpful in guiding the profession in developing models that incorporate these insights, \"demand shocks\" remain a fairly abstract notion. Clearly, superstar products such as the Apple iPhone or AbbVie's Humira, the no. 1 blockbuster drug every year since 2015, generate sales because customers value that product rather than effciency advances over generic competition. But what do businesses actually do that makes their demand curve inelastic so they can charge higher prices? The many factors that may engineer a “customer preference shock\" to lift demand for an establishment's products and makes customers more willing to pay a higher price are known to a business. It will likely invest in its brand value, develop and expand its customer base or spend a lot on market research when developing new products. To our knowledge, information about on the relationship between these activities and labor shares is missing in the literature. As it turns out, Census started to collect some data on advertising expenditures since 1997. While this likely represented only one of many types of spending that may shape and drive demand factors, it may still hint at how $L L$ establishments manage to convince customers to pay higher prices for their products relative to the competition. In fact, advertising has steadily increased over time and found to matter for firm profits, sales and markups (Gourio and Rudanko (2014)) in general. Next, we show that advertising intensity is significantly related to labor shares, hinting at a potential role in driving the micro-level dynamics we documented earlier.  \n\n![](images/88b4bc8843eaf957ef73cd71087f560edf81801f25d02eb89e4c68855aeecd22.jpg)  \nFigure C.6: Wage, Employment and Value Added Dynamics of $L L$ Firms   \nNote: This figure depicts the firm-level evidence analogously to Figure 13.  \n\nFirst, it should be mentioned that the dataset only contains advertising expenditures at the establishment level, while such expenditures at the headquarter or firm level are missing along with other aspects of customer-related marketing investments.  \n\nWe compute establishment $i$ 's advertising expenses per employee in year $t$ ， $c a_{i t}/l_{i t}$ , and scale that number analogously to the other nominal variables, as illustrated in Equation (11). The resulting variable, $c a_{i t}/l_{i t}$ , denotes the log point difference of an establishment's advertising expenditures per employee relative to that of their peers in the same industry, state and year. As in the previous sections, we non-parametrically regress that variable on the labor share and plot the estimates in Figure D.1.  \n\nThe figure reveals a clear pattern: low-labor share establishments spend significantly more on advertising compared to their peers than high-labor share establishments do. Our estimates indicate that a typical unit with a labor share of 0.1 spends about $\\exp(0.51)=1.67$ timesmore on advertising per employee than the average plant in its sector and region, while high-labor share establishments ( $\\lambda=1$ ) spend about 25% less.  \n\nWhile it should not be interpreted as causal at this point, we view the relationship between advertising expenditures and labor shares as corroborating evidence about the importance of demand shocks.  \n\n![](images/785963366af291391f7142bf0740fb1ebc155653fbcde79f66c674c037a3b433.jpg)  \nFigure D.1: Cost of Advertising per Employee and Labor Shares   \nNote: The figure displays the cross-sectional differences in relative cost of advertising expenditures per employee $c a/l$ against the labor share. All relative measures denote log-point differences vis-a-vis their peers as defined in Equation (11). Dashed lines denote $95\\%$ errorbands.  \n\n### D.2 The Unimportance of Industry, Regional, Legal Factors  \n\nTo test for industry and/or geographical composition effects, we decompose the manufacturing labor share decline into within- and between-groups components using Equation (19):  \n\n$$\n\\Delta\\lambda_{t}=\\underbrace{\\sum_{j}\\Delta\\lambda_{j t}\\omega_{j t-5}}_{\\mathrm{Within~adjustment}}\\quad+\\underbrace{\\sum_{j}\\lambda_{j t-5}d\\omega_{j t}}_{\\mathrm{Between~reallocation}}\\quad\\underbrace{+\\sum_{j}\\Delta\\lambda_{j t}d\\omega_{j t}}_{\\mathrm{Residual}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\lambda_{j}$ denotes the industry- or region-level labor share and $\\omega_{j}$ the share of value added accounted for by group $j$  \n\nPanel A. in Table D.1 displays the results from an industry-level decomposition. It shows that most of the labor share decline between 1967 and 2007 stems from within-industry adjustment. Defining an industry at the 3-digit NAICS level, 3.3 ppts of the 4.9 ppt decline per decade is due to within-industry adjustment, while between-industry reallocation only account for 0.7 ppts. The residual interaction term can be interpreted as either adjustment of relatively expanding industries or output reallocation directed to industries that lower their labor share. Importantly, the acceleration of the labor share decline starting in the 1980s is predominantly captured by the within-industry adjustment term, with a much more limited role for between-industry reallocation. Considering instead 4-digit NAICS industries (not displayed) does not change this takeaway.  \n\nTurning our attention to the regional dimension, Panel B. in Table D.1 shows that as with the industry-level exercise, most action occurs within regions rather than refecting between-region reallocation: of the 7.3 ppt decline per decade between 1982 and 2007, 6.6 ppt occur within Census divisions, whereas between-division reallocation accounts for less than a percentage point, even  \n\nTable D.1: Labor Share Declines within and between Industries, Regions, Legal Forms of Organization   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Portions of labor share change</td><td>1967-2007</td><td>1967-1982 (percentage point changes)</td><td>1982-2007</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturing labor share change</td><td colspan=\"3\">-4.9 -0.9 -7.3</td></tr><tr><td>A.NAICS-3 industries</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Within-industry adjustment</td><td>-3.3</td><td>-0.0</td><td>-5.3</td></tr><tr><td>Between-industry reallocation</td><td>-0.7</td><td>-0.4</td><td>-1.0</td></tr><tr><td>Residual</td><td>-0.9</td><td>-0.6</td><td>-1.0</td></tr><tr><td>B.

The acceleration of the labor share decline almost exclusively stems from a more negative within-group adjustment term suggesting that reallocation between these groups only plays a minor role.  \n\nvhen adding the residual term. An analogous analysis at the state level shows similar results.28  \n\nNext, we study the effect of the legal form of organization. The 1980s saw the emergence of new legal forms of organization such as S-corporations. This has been studied in many papers, (see, among others, Dyrda and Pugsley (2019)), and it is plausible to think that the 1980s tax reform may have had an effect on the labor share if pass-through entities have diverted some labor incomes of proprietors into profits passed through to frm owners. We combine our baseline dataset with the Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL), which contains the legal form of organization for single- and multi-unit firms, including the break-down of corporations into C- and S-corporations. $^{29}$ While S-corporations do become much more important, Panel C. suggests they did not play a role in the decline of the manufacturing labor share. Most of the decline of the labor share occurred within the same category of legal forms of organization rather than resulting from a shift from sole proprietorships and C-corporations to S-corporations.  \n\nLastly, we study if a shift of economic activity to publicly traded firms matter for the labor share decline. Those firms likely face less financial frictions and can more easily build capital. With higher capital intensity, they may have naturally a lower labor share. Again, we find that the labor share decline occurs among both publicly traded and privately held firms (see Panel D.).  "

INTRODUCTION  \n\nAFTER CAREFULLY ANALYZING the most recent national income and fixed assets data, we show that the secular decline of the labor share (Ls), an observation that motivates a growing body of research on factor income shares (Elsby, Hobijn, and Sahin (2013), Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014)), is entirely driven by the recent capitalization of intellectual property products (IPP) in the national income and product accounts (NIPA). The capitalization of IPP—previously treated as intermediate nondurable consumption in the business sector and final consumption in nonprofit institutions serving households (NPISH) and general government—-is a major accounting change in the NIPA.  \n\nThe capitalization of IPP has been gradually introduced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) through two comprehensive revisions of the NIPA. In 1999, the 11th BEA revision capitalized software expenditures by business, NPISH, and government. Prior to this revision, software expenditure was considered intermediate nondurable consumption in the business sector and final consumption in NPISH and general government. Analogously, after the 14th revision in 2013, the BEA treats the expenditures by businesses, NPISH, and the government for R&D and those by private enterprises for the creation of entertainment, literary, and artistic originals (henceforth, artistic originals) as investment in the form of durable capital, that is, no longer as business expenditures in intermediate nondurable goods or as NPISH and government final consumption. These newly recognized forms of investment (i.e., software, R&D, and artistic originals) constitute the set of intangible assets currently measured by the BEA, the so-called IPP. These revisions aim to capture the increasingly important role of IPP in the U.S. economy (Corrado, Haltiwanger, and Sichel (2005), McGrattan and Prescott (2010, 2014), Akcigit, Celik, and Greenwood (2016)). Notably, the share of IPP in aggregate investment secularly increases from $3.1\\%$ in 1901 to $27.0\\%$ in 2018; see panel (a) of Figure 1. Similarly, the share of IPP in GDP increases from $0.7\\%$ in 1929 to $5.5\\%$ in 2018; see panel (b) of Figure 1. This structural shift toward a more IPP-intensive economy measured by the BEA is large and does not show signs of deceleration.1  \n\n![](images/70d9b089fe580286906bb50d7b8d65a4cab273b43b0c50f527034f040e51fb67.jpg)  \nFIGURE 1.—Investment shares, BEA 1929-2018.  \n\nWhat are the effects of the capitalization of IPP on the LS? These effects strictly depend on how the newly recognized income (or rents) generated from IPP is distributed between capital and labor. We find that the capitalization of IPP unambiguously lowers the level of the LS in a purely accounting sense. The reason is simple. The BEA attributes the entire rents generated from IPP to capital income. First, in terms of the business sector, the capitalization of IPP revises up the value added (VA) of businesses by an amount equal to the gross investment in business IPP—which is equal to the sum of own-account IPP and purchased IPP in the business sector.2 To restore the accounting identity between the product side and the income side of the national accounts, the BEA must attribute the increase in the product to the factors’ income. The current accounting assumption is to attribute the entire gross investment in business IPP to gross operating surplus (GOS), that is, to capital income. This attribution automatically lowers the LS, which is one minus the ratio of the GOS to the VA. That is, an increase in IPP investment on the product side of the accounts translates into an equal increase of capital income on the income side of the accounts and, hence, on a lower LS constructed from national accounts. Second, since the NPISH and government expenditure in the IPP was previously treated as part of the final consumption and hence already in the value added, the capitalization increases the NPISH and government product by an amount equal to the depreciation of their respective IPP capital. From the income side of the accounts, the NPISH and government IPP depreciation is allocated to GOs, which further lowers the level of the LS.  \n\nIn this context, the fact that IPP investment is increasing over time at a faster rate than output implies that the capitalization of IPP can affect not only the level of the LS but also the trend of the LS. Our question is: Could the rise in IPP investment over time explain the secular decline of the Ls? We find that it entirely does. To measure the effects of the capitalization of IPP on the secular behavior of the LS, we compare our benchmark LS, which is constructed using current post-2013 BEA revision data, with a counterfactual accounting LS in which we decapitalize IPP from national accounts. The counterfactual accounting LS is constructed by undoing the capitalization of IPP, that is, removing gross business investment in IPP and NPISH and government IPP depreciation from both GOS and VA. This counterfactual accounting LS is consistent with the accounting rule in which all IPP is considered as an expense, as was the procedure before the revisions that capitalized IPP. The comparison between the benchmark LS and this counterfactual accounting LS yields the main result of our paper: In sharp contrast to the benchmark LS which exhibits a prolonged secular decline, the counterfactual LS in which IPP is expensed instead of capitalized is absolutely trendless. That is, the capitalization of IPP explains the entire secular decline of the Ls.3  \n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. We describe the BEA revisions that capitalize IPP in Section 2. We show the effects of the IPP capitalization on the decline of the LS in Section 3. In that section, we also examine the decline of the LS by institutional sector including the corporate sector and by using broader measures of intangible capital beyond those captured by the BEA. We provide international evidence in Section 4. We examine the BEA's assumptions on the factor distribution of IPP rents and provide further discussion in Section 5. Section 6 concludes.  \n\n## 2. THE CAPITALIZATION OF IPP IN THE NATIONAL ACCOUNTS  \n\nUnder the current system of national accounts used by the BEA, the expenditure on IPP (i.e., software, R&D, and artistic originals) is treated as part of aggregate investment in NIPA. This treatment is the result of two recent comprehensive BEA revisions that gradually and retrospectively capitalized IPP items—software in the 1999 revision and R&D and artistic originals in the 2013 revision. Prior to these revisions, IPP was treated as expenditure in intermediate nondurable goods for businesses and as final consumption for NPISH and the government. Because the accounting changes associated with the capitalization of software, R&D, and artistic originals are analogous, we place the two recent revisions into one illustrative IPP revision. We describe the impact of the capitalization of IPP on the business accounts in Section 2.1, on the entire economy including NPISH and government accounts in Section 2.2, and on the LS in Section 2.3.  \n\n### 2.1. Effects of IPP Capitalization on the Business Accounts  \n\nDenote the pre-revision gross output in the business sector with $Q$ (line 1, Table I). Businesses engage in both in-house production of IPP and purchases of IPP. The capitalization of IPP implies that the business expenditure in own-account IPP, $I_{o}$ ,becomespart of gross output. That is, the revised gross output increases by an amount equal to the expenditure on own-account IPP and becomes $Q+I_{o}$ (line 3, Table I).  \n\nTABLEI EFFECTS OF IPP CAPITALIZATION ON THE BUSINESS SECTOR: VALUE ADDED AND INCOME ACCOUNTSa   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">USD Bill.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Notation</td><td>1947</td><td>2018</td></tr><tr><td>1.

Gross output, intermediate input expenditure, and value added refer to all private industries obtained from the BEA Industry Accounts for 1947-2018. The compensation of employees for all private industries is available from the BEA NIPA Table 6.2 for 1929-2018. The depreciation for the business sector is obtained from Table 3.4 in the BEA Fixed Asset Tables (FAT). Own-account Investment is obtained from the BEA R&D Satellite Account for 1987-2007. We apply the average ratio of own-account R&D investment to private investment on R&D for the sample period 1987-2007 (i.e., 0.74) to the aggregate investment on IPP in the BEA to obtain own-account and purchased IPP for 1947-2018.  \n\nIn terms of intermediate expenditure, the pre-revision accounting has two components: the expenditure on intermediate inputs in the production of non-IPP and own-account IPP (e.g., cost of energy for in-house R&D labs), $M$ , plus the business expenditure on purchased IPP, $I_{p}$ (line 4, Table I). The capitalization of IPP implies that business expenditure on purchased IPP is no longer considered an intermediate expenditure in the post-revision accounting (line 6, Table I).  \n\nSubtracting the intermediate expenditure from the gross output, we obtain the value added. The value added is consequently revised up by an amount equal to the gross investment in IPP in the business sector, that is, the sum of business expenditure in own-account  \n\nIPP and purchased IPP, or $I_{b}=I_{o}+I_{p}$ (lines 7 to 9, Table I). This revision increases the value added in the business sector by $\\$2.0$ billion (or $0.93\\%$ ) in 1947 and by $\\$931.1$ billion (or $5.44\\%$ in 2018.  \n\nOn the income side of the business accounts, the BEA increases income by the same amount as the gross IPP investment in the business sector. This preserves the balance of the product and income accounts in the business sector. The BEA must also decide to which income accounts to attribute the rents from IPP investment. Let us denote with $\\chi\\in[0,1]$ the proportion of IPP rents attributed to capital income accounts, and $1-\\chi$ the proportion attributed to labor income. The choice of $\\chi$ will turn out to be a critical decision for the secular behavior of the LS. We denote the compensation of employees by $W$ and obtain the GOS as the value added minus $W$ . The current accounting assumption implemented by the BEA regarding the split of IPP between capital and labor is to allocate the entire IPP investment rents to GOs. That is, the BEA assumes that the income rents from IPP investment are entirely attributed to capital income accounts, that is, $\\chi=$ 1. This implies that GOS is revised up by exactly the gross investment in IPP in the business sector, $I_{o}+I_{p}$ (lines 11 to 13, Table I). Precisely, GOS is revised up by $1.93\\%$ in 1947 and by $11.4\\%$ in 2018.  \n\nLast, we divide the GOs into its two components: the depreciation and the net operating surplus (NOs). The capitalization of IPP naturally generates depreciation for the IPP capital, $D_{I_{b}}$ , which must be added to the pre-revision depreciation (lines 14 to 16, Table I). Consequently, the NOS is increased by the net investment in business IPP, that is, $I_{b}-D_{I_{b}}$ (lines 17 to 20, Table I). Further breakdown along the finer categories of the business income account shows that the boost in NOs increases corporate profits and proprietors? income (McCulla, Holdren, and Smith (2013)). Due to the increase in depreciation, the revision increases NOS less than it increases GOS. More specifically, NOS is revised up by $0.69\\%$ in 1947 and by $2.19\\%$ in 2018.  \n\n### 2.2. Effects of IPP Capitalization on Private and Government Accounts  \n\nWe now discuss the NPISH and government sector which includes all federal, state, and local governments. Businesses and NPISH together form the private sector, and with the government sector, they complete the discussion of the effects of IPP capitalization on the national accounts.  \n\nThe capitalization of IPP affects the NPISH accounts and the government accounts in a similar manner. The IPP expenditure by the NPISH, $I_{n p}$ (or the government, $I_{g}$ ),was treated as personal consumption expenditure (or government final consumption) before the revision as opposed to investment expenditure after the revision. For this reason, the pre-revision accounting did not include the depreciation of NPISH IPP capital, $D_{I_{n p}}$ (or the depreciation of government IPP capital, $D_{I g}$ ), in the product accounts and this changes with the capitalization of IPP. The revision moves NPISH (or government) net investment in IPP out of personal (or government) consumption (lines 1 to 3 and 7 to 9 in Table II). Upon revision, private (or government) gross investment increases by the gross investment in business and NPISH (or government) IPP (lines 4 to 6 and 10 to 12 in Table II).  \n\nThe total effects on the private sector, which is the sum of the businesses and NPISH, are that personal consumption is revised down by the net investment in IPP by the NPISH, $I_{n p}-D_{I_{n p}}$ , and the gross private investment is revised up by the sum of the business and NPISH gross investment in IPP, $I_{b}+I_{n p}$ . These results imply that private product is revised up by gross business investment in IPP, $I_{b}$ , plus the depreciation of NPISH IPP capital,  \n\nTABLEⅡI EFFECTS OF IPP CAPITALIZATION ON THE PRIVATE AND GOVERNMENT PRODUCT ACCOUNTSa   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Notation</td><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">USD Bill.</td></tr><tr><td>1929</td><td>2018</td></tr><tr><td>Private sector:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1.

Personal consumption expenditure, $C$ gross private domestic investment, $X$ , government expenditure (including consumption and gross investment), $G$ , and GDP come from NIPA Table 1.1.5 and 3.9.5. We ignore net exports of goods and services from GDP in this ilustrative table because these are unaffected by IPP capitalization. Our quantitative analysis in Section 3 incorporates net exports. Business, NPISH, and government's gross investment in IPP come from the Fixed Asset Tables 2.7 and 7.5, and their depreciation from the Fixed Asset Tables 2.4 and 7.3.  \n\n$D_{I_{n p}}$ . The total effect on the government expenditure, which is the sum of the government consumption and gross government investment, is that it is revised up by the depreciation of the government IPP capital, $D_{I_{g}}$ (lines 13 to 15, Table II).5  \n\nPiecing together the private and the government sectors, the revised gross domestic product, GDP, inherits all these effects from private consumption, private gross investment, and government expenditure. Therefore, the revised GDP is increased by an amount equal to the increase in the business investment in IPP, $I_{b}$ , plus the depreciation of NPISH IPP capital, $D_{I_{n p}}$ , and the depreciation of government IPP capital, $D_{I_{g}}$ (lines 16 to 20, Table Il). In summary, this revision results in an increase of $\\$1,127$ billion in the GDP in 2018, that is, an increase of $5.79\\%$ with respect to its pre-revision counterpart. The effect is much lower in 1929, with an increase of $\\$0.6$ billion, that is, an increase of $0.58\\%$ of its pre-revision counterpart.  \n\nOn the income side of the accounts, the capitalization of IPP increases gross domestic income (GDI) by the same amount as GDP, that is, by the sum of the gross investment in business IPP and the depreciation of NPISH and government IPP capital, $I_{b}+D_{I_{g}}+D_{I_{n p}}$ As was the case for the business sector, for the entire economy, the BEA also assumes that all the increase in GDI that results from the capitalization of IPP is attributed to GOS and, hence, to capital income. In other words, GOS and GDI are increased by exactly the same amount. Notably, we can decompose the increase in GOS as the net investment in business IPP (i.e., $I_{b}-D_{I_{b}})$ plus the total depreciation of IPP summing over all sectors (i.e., $D_{I_{b}}+D_{I_{g}}+D_{I_{n p}})$ . Consequently, the net operating surplus (NOs) is increased by the net investment in business IPP, which increases corporate profits and proprietors' income.  \n\n### 2.3. Qualitative Implications for the LS  \n\nIt should be clear by now that the addition of the amount of IPP investment to the product account is balanced by an equal addition to GOs in the income account. This particular accounting procedure chosen by the BEA allows us to undo the capitalization of IPP in a straightforward way and assess its implications for the LS. Clearly, if IPP investment is strictly positive, then the capitalization of IPP unambiguously decreases the LS. To observe this decrease, define the LS as  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{LS}=1-{\\frac{\\mathrm{GOS}}{Y}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $Y$ is GDP and the ratio of GOS to $Y$ is the capital share of income.6 Then, the difference between the post-revision LS, $L S_{\\mathrm{Post}}$ , and the pre-revision LS, $\\mathbf{L}S_{\\mathrm{Pre}}$ ,is  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{LS}_{\\mathrm{Post}}-\\mathrm{LS}_{\\mathrm{Pre}}=\\left(1-\\frac{\\mathrm{GOS}_{\\mathrm{Post}}}{Y_{\\mathrm{Post}}}\\right)-\\left(1-\\frac{\\mathrm{GOS}_{\\mathrm{Pre}}}{Y_{\\mathrm{Pre}}}\\right)=\\frac{(\\mathrm{GOS}_{\\mathrm{Post}}-Y_{\\mathrm{Post}})\\Delta}{(Y_{\\mathrm{Post}}-\\Delta)Y_{\\mathrm{Post}}}<0,\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\Delta=I_{b}+D_{I_{g}}+D_{I_{\\mathrm{np}}}=\\mathrm{GOS}_{\\mathrm{Post}}-\\mathrm{GOS}_{\\mathrm{Pre}}=Y_{\\mathrm{Post}}-Y_{\\mathrm{Pre}}>0.$ The negative sign in the last inequality is explained by $Y$ being larger than its components: $Y>\\mathbf{G}\\mathbf{O}\\mathbf{S}$ and $Y>\\Delta$ Thus, under the accounting assumption on the factor income distribution of IPP rentsthat attributes all these rents to GOS, the effects of the capitalization of IPP on the secular behavior of the LS depend solely on the rise of IPP investment, in particular,  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\left(\\mathrm{LS}_{\\mathrm{Post}}-\\mathrm{LS}_{\\mathrm{Pre}}\\right)}{\\partial\\Delta}=-\\frac{Y_{\\mathrm{Post}}-\\mathrm{GOS}_{\\mathrm{Post}}}{\\left(Y_{\\mathrm{Post}}\\right)^{2}}<0.\n$$  \n\nThis opens the question of whether the capitalization of IPP can explain the decline of the LS. This is the quantitative question that we explore next.  \n\n## 3. THE EFFECTS OF IPP CAPITALIZATION ON THE LS  \n\nWe construct our benchmark LS using an economy-wide definition standard in the macroeconomics literature (Cooley and Prescott (1995)). We split the components of national income that cannot be unambiguously attributed to capital or labor by using the factor shares of the unambiguous income of the economy. This is equivalent to the following definition of the LS:  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{LS}=1-{\\frac{\\mathrm{GOS}^{\\mathrm{adj}}}{Y}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $Y$ is GDP and we adjust gross operating surplus, GOS, for the ambiguous income in the economy, that is, proprietor's income, PI, and taxes (less subsidies) on production and imports, TS. Our adjusted gross operating surplus is $\\mathrm{GOS^{adj}}=(\\mathrm{GOS}-\\theta(\\mathrm{PI}+\\mathrm{TS}))$ whereweset $\\theta$ to be the labor share of the unambiguous income of the economy.7.8  \n\nFigure 2 shows the time series of the benchmark LS (i.e., the economy-wide BEA LS labeled as “BEA LS\"). Clearly, the LS exhibits a relentless secular decline. Linearly, the LS declines at an annual rate of $-0.072\\%$ between 1929 and 2018. A historic high is achieved in 1946 at $69.4\\%$ , and a historic low is achieved in 2010 at $61.5\\%$ . On average, the benchmark LS is $65.2\\%$  \n\nTo assess the effects of IPP capitalization on the LS, we compare our benchmark LS with a counterfactual accounting LS consistent with the accounting treatment of IPP before the 1999 BEA revision. Specifically, we subtract the gross investment in business IPP $\\left(I_{b}\\right)$ , the NPISH IPP capital depreciation $(D_{I_{\\mathrm{np}}})$ , and the government IPP capital depreciation $(D_{I_{g}})$ from GOs and $Y$ as described in Section 2. The counterfactual accounting LS that follows the pre-1999 accounting rule is as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{LS}_{\\mathrm{Pre-1999}}=1-{\\frac{\\mathrm{GOS}^{\\mathrm{adj}}-(I_{b}+D_{I_{\\mathrm{np}}}+D_{I_{g}})}{Y-(I_{b}+D_{I_{\\mathrm{np}}}+D_{I_{g}})}}.\n$$  \n\nThe comparison between our benchmark LS (black line, Figure 2) and the pre-1999 revision counterfactual LS (gray line, Figure 2) delivers the main result of our paper: In sharp contrast to the decline of the benchmark LS, the pre-1999 revision counterfactual LS is absolutely trendless, with an average value of $67.5\\%$ . That is, the decline of the LS is entirely explained by the capitalization of IPP in national accounts. Had the BEA kept the pre-1999 treatment of IPP as an expense, the LS would have displayed no secular trend.9  \n\n![](images/77e3487e848f284c9bb86fce937e5dac45f318732c8b066810db856d2bad11df.jpg)  \nFIGURE 2.—Economy-wide U.S. labor share, BEA 1929-2018: Pre- versus post-revision accounting.  \n\nThe Rising Role of Software After the 197Os. Our analysis has focused on the counterfactual accounting LS consistent with pre-1999 treatment of IPP, that is, before the capitalization of both software and R&D.10 To understand the role played by software and R&D respectively, we provide a second counterfactual accounting LS consistent with the accounting rule right before the 2013 BEA revision. That is, we decapitalize only R&D from the national accounts. Specifically, we subtract the gross investment in business R&D $(I_{b,R\\&D})$ , the NPISH R&D capital depreciation $(D_{I_{\\mathrm{np},R\\&D}})$ , and the government R&D capital depreciation $(D_{I_{g,R\\&D}})$ from both GOS and $Y$ . This counterfactual LS consistent with the pre-2013 accounting rule is as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{LS}_{\\mathrm{Pre-2013}}=1-\\frac{\\mathrm{GOS}^{\\mathrm{adj}}-(I_{b,R\\&D}+D_{I_{\\mathrm{np},R\\&D}}+D_{I_{g,R\\&D}})}{Y-(I_{b,R\\&D}+D_{I_{\\mathrm{np},R\\&D}}+D_{I_{g,R\\&D}})}.\n$$  \n\nCompared with the benchmark LS, the pre-2013 revision counterfactual LS displays a milder decline that starts in the mid-1970s and is approximately half of that of the benchmark LS over the sample period (panel (a), Figure 3). This suggests a quantitatively similar role for software and R&D in explaining the decline of the LS.  \n\nA simple decomposition quantifies the effects of R&D and software capitalization separately. First, we measure the effects of R&D capitalization on the LS decline as the difference between the BEA LS [equation (1)] and the pre-2013 revision counterfactual LS [equation (3)]. Second, the effects of software capitalization on the LS decline can be computed as the difference between the pre-2013 revision counterfactual LS [equation (3)] and the pre-1999 revision counterfactual LS [equation (2)]. The total decline of the LS is the sum of these two effects. Our results are in panel (b) of Figure 3. Clearly, it is the capitalization of software that solely drives the declining trend of the LS after 1980s, while the capitalization of R&D generates the decline of the LS before the 1980s. This simply reflects the growing relative importance of software in IPP investment. Another way to explore this issue is by decomposing the increase of the capital share into that of its compnentsn panl (a)f Figure 4, we plot the capital share (o , dark gray line) and that of its components, the IPP capital share ( $\\frac{I}{Y}$ , black line) and the tangible capital share( $\\frac{\\mathrm{\\partial}_{\\mathrm{{GOS}^{a d j}}-I}}{Y}$ lightgaarlyt sle drivfthrsofthaita shaes income rents from IPP. In contrast, the tangible capital share declines over time. In panel (b) of Figure 4, we find that the rise of the IPP capital share is driven largely by R&D before the 1980s and by software after the 1980s. Artistic originals play a minor role in the level and trend of the IPP capital share.  \n\n![](images/372302aa866ee857d5933e9c055b08f25fec5d736646cfc8be3865857f87e9f9.jpg)  \nFIGURE 3.—The effects of software and R&D capitalization revisions on the labor share.  \n\nThis result speaks to earlier work on the decline of the LS that relies solely on the pre2013 revision data (Elsby, Hobijn, and Sahin (2013), Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014)). We show that the decline of the LS observed in that earlier work—that uses data for which software is capitalized but not R&D—-is fully explained by the capitalization of software. To see this, we can simply compare the declining pre-2013 revision LS in which software is capitalized (light gray line, panel (a) of Figure 3) with the trendless pre-1999 revision LS in which software is not capitalized (dark gray line, panel (a) of Figure 3).  \n\nInstitutional Sectors. We now conduct our analysis by institutional sectors. We first examine three broad institutional sectors that exhaustively capture the economy: (1) the domestic business sector, (2) the household sector (including NPISH), and (3) the general government.l1 We show IPP investment for these institutional sectors as a share of aggregate gross value added (GVA) in panel (a1) of Figure 5. From 1948, the first year in our sample, to the early 1970s, the domestic business and government sectors make roughly equal contribution to IPP investment. However, since the mid-1960s, the government's contribution to IPP is steadily decreasing as a share of GVA, whereas the IPP share of domestic businesses keeps rising throughout the entire period. Over the sample period, the growth of IPP share is mainly driven by the domestic business sector. In 2018, the share of IPP in GVA contributed by domestic businesses is $4.3\\%$ while that by the general government sector is only $0.9\\%$ . The contribution of households (including NPISH) to IPP growth is a positive, albeit minor, $0.3\\%$ of GVA.12 Second, as is the case with the economy-wide LS, the capitalization of IPP explains the entire decline of the LS in domestic businesses; see panel (a2) of Figure 5. The pre-1999 revision LS in domestic businesses is trendless with a long-run average of $68.7\\%$ . In contrast, the LS in the household sector and the LS in the government sector are increasing in both post-2013 and pre-1999 revision data; see panels (a3) and (a4) of Figure 5. The level of the LS for these sectors also differs from that of domestic businesses, with the household sector averaging a lower LS of $39.4\\%$ and the government sector averaging a higher LS of $85.6\\%$ This broad institutional analysis shows that the business sector drives the effects of IPP capitalization on the economy-wide LS.  \n\n![](images/e8145f074a1f2e6a797650773c5951deb71b9bb4242eb8b70ea96d47707f73c2.jpg)  \nFIGURE 4.—Tangible and IPP capital share of income, BEA 1929-2018.  \n\nWe further decompose the domestic business sector into (1) the corporate sector (including nonfinancial and financial corporations) and (2) the noncorporate sector that includes sole proprietorships, partnerships, and government enterprises. The first observation is that most of the IPP investment in domestic businesses is captured by the corporate sector. For example, in 2018, IPP investment by the corporate sector accounts for $3.9\\%$ Of aggregate GVA, while IPP investment in the noncorporate business sector accounts for a much smaller $0.4\\%$ of GVA. The behaviors of the corporate and noncorporate LS are depicted respectively in panel (b1) and (b2) of Figure 5.13 Although the long-run trend of the corporate LS with current data displays an annual decline of $-0.093\\%$ , the pre-1999 revision counterfactual corporate LS consistent with expensing IPP is trendless. That is, the main result we obtain from the economy-wide analysis extends to the corporate sector. A further decomposition between nonfinancial and financial corporations (respectively panels (b3) and (b4)) shows that the results of the corporate sector are largely driven by nonfinancial corporations. The effects of IPP capitalization on the noncorporate LS are minor (panel (b2)). To sum up, domestic businesses, in particular, the nonfinancial corporations, are responsible for the effects of IPP capitalization on the secular behavior of the economy-wide Ls.  \n\nBroader Measures of Intangible Capital. IPP, as measured by the BEA, captures some types of intangible capital in the economy, but not all (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel (2009), McGrattan and Prescott (2010)). We now assess the effects of capitalizing a broader set of intangible investments on the long-run behavior of the LS. In particular, we use the series constructed by Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel (2009) and their updates for intangible items not included in national accounts, $I_{\\mathrm{nonNA}}$ .14 These series of intangible investment consist of (1) Finance and insurance new product development, (2) Design, (3) Brand, (4) Training, and (5) Organizational capital.  \n\n![](images/9bd0f79fd0874b49c09fa8e4938ab61828e42023470122741502b849daf5ecdf.jpg)  \nFIGURE 5.—-Effects of IPP capitalization by institutional sector.  \n\n![](images/e2fef6941a78ed8f067c4b41ae803878518f61f1da1a96df91e21b49f90a9b5a.jpg)  \nFIGURE 6.—The effects of capitalizing broader measures of intangible capital.  \n\nIn panel (a) of Figure 6, we compare the properties of intangible investment incorporated in national accounts (i.e., IPP) with intangible investment not incorporated in national accounts (i.e., $I_{\\mathrm{nonNA}})$ 15,16 We find that $I_{\\mathrm{nonNA}}$ is larger than IPP. The ratio of private IPP to private $I_{\\mathrm{nonNA}}$ increases from $38.6\\%$ in 1977 to $61.4\\%$ in 2014. That is, IPP in the BEA grows faster than the intangible investment not incorporated in national accounts. However, once we incorporate government IPP investment, the differences between IPP and $I_{\\mathrm{nonNA}}$ decrease. We find that the ratio of the two is large, on average approximately $74.7\\%$ for the entire sample period, and it increases from $68.6\\%$ in 1977 to $77.2\\%$ in 2014. This implies that if national accounts were to incorporate the total intangible investment (i.e., IPP plus $I_{\\mathrm{nonNA,}}$ ), then the current measure of intangible investment of the BEA would increase by a factor of 2.34.17  \n\nThe implications of these broader measures of intangible investment for the long-run behavior of the LS are reported in panel (b) Figure 6. The broader measure of intangible investment enlarges the long-run decline of the Ls. Specifically, if the national accounts were to capitalize the broader set of intangibles, then the LS would significantly decline at an annual rate of $-0.15\\%$ , which is a rate twice as large as the decline of the LS with the current IPP in NIPA. Finally, note that this analysis does not alter the pre-1999 revision counterfactual LS that remains trendless.  \n\n## 4. INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE  \n\nThe 2013 BEA comprehensive revision that capitalizes R&D and artistic originals in the United States is based on the capitalization guidelines provided by the System of National Accounts 2008 (SNA08).18 The SNAs are quinquennially updated and provide the international accounting standards and principles that are implemented by national statistics offices.19 Indeed, most OECD countries already follow the SNA08's guide on IPP capitalization. We now extend our main analysis to several countries that currently capitalize IPP. Because we are interested in the long-run behavior of the LS, we focus on a selection of countries for which long time series dating back at least to the 1960s are available: Canada, France, Denmark, Sweden, and Japan.20  \n\nThe results for these countries are similar to those for the United States; see Figure 7. First, the LS declines significantly in all five countries. For the country with the longest period of available data, Canada, the LS shows a long-run (linear) trend that annually decreases by $-0.023\\%$ from 1926 to 2018 (see panel (a) in Figure 7). The LS linearly declines by an annual $-0.130\\%$ in Denmark between 1966 and 2018 (panel (b)), by an annual $-0.116\\%$ in France between 1950 and 2018 (panel (c)), by an annual $-0.13731\\%$ in Japan between 1955 and 2017 (panel (d)), and by an annual $-0.217\\%$ in Sweden between 1950 and 2018 (panel (e)). The decline is significant at $1\\%$ level in all countries except Canada, in which the significance is at $10\\%$ level. Second, the share of IPP investment in GDP rises in each of the five countries (see panel (f) of Figure 7). The IPP investment share in GDP increases from a level below $1\\%$ at the beginning of the sample period to a level that is approximately $5.5\\%$ of GDP in the late 2010s in all countries except Canada, where it grows to approximately $3\\%$ of GDP in the 2010s. Third, we assess the effects of IPP capitalization by constructing a counterfactual accounting LS consistent with the pre-SNA93 accounting rule in which IPP is expensed. The effects of the IPP capitalization on the long-run behavior of the LS are similar across countries. In all countries, the counterfactual accounting LS is trendless. Specifically, the long-run trend of the pre-SNA93 counterfactual LS is an annual slope of $0.019\\%$ in Canada, $-0.012\\%$ in Denmark, $-0.023\\%$ in France, $-0.036\\%$ in Japan, and $-0.095\\%$ in Sweden, none of which is significantly different from zero. The only exception is Sweden, in which IPP accounts for more than $56\\%$ of the LS decline but leaves a significant $44\\%$ of the decline unexplained.  \n\n## 5. DISCUSSION  \n\nThe finding that the capitalization of IPP explains the decline of the LS raises some questions over the accounting procedure that capitalizes the IPP. In particular, we question a critical accounting assumption on the factor distribution of rents generated from IPP. Let $1-\\chi\\in[0,1]$ denote the fraction of IPP rents attributed to labor and $\\chi$ the fraction attributed to capital. The BEA assumes that all rents from IPP go to capital, which effectivelysets $\\chi$ to 1 (see Section 2).  \n\nHowcanwe interpret $1-\\chi?$ Our preferred interpretation of $1-\\chi$ is the portion of IPP rents paid to workers in the form of equity. For example, corporate R&D workers and lab managers obtain a large part of their labor compensation in incentive stock options (ISOs), restricted stock units, and other forms of stock-based compensation (Lerner and  \n\n![](images/2627273541924fd82e43daaac00d62bfb552307696619f14a2c50660372abc6a.jpg)  \nFIGURE 7.—The effects of IPP capitalization on the labor share, international evidence.  \n\nWulf (2007)), which are currently absent in the compensation of employees in BEA's income account.21 More generally, this interpretation is akin to the notion of sweat equity in McGrattan and Prescott (2010, 2014). It describes a scenario in which workers are paid wages lower than their marginal value product in return for some equity.22 Along this line of argument, a growing literature in corporate finance documents that an essential property of intangible capital is that it is partly embodied in key talents such as managers, engineers, and research employees of the firm, and is hence portable (Lustig, Syverson, and Nieuverburgh (2011), Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou (2014), Sun and Xiaolan (2019)). The property right over such capital is different from physical capital: the key talents own, at least partially, the cash flow from intangible capital in the form of equity.23  \n\nWhat are the values of $\\chi$ for which the secular $L S$ is trendless? To answer this question, we write the LS explicitly as a function of $\\chi$  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{LS}=1-{\\frac{\\mathrm{GOS}^{\\mathrm{adj}}-(1-\\chi)I}{Y}}.\n$$  \n\nUnder the current BEA accounting assumption that sets $\\chi$ equal to 1, the LS declines; see panel (a) of Figure 8. In the opposite extreme, where all IPP rents are attributed to labor income (i.e., $\\chi=0$ ), the LS displays a significant upward trend. An intermediate value of $\\chi=0.5$ delivers a trendless LS. Clearly, the value of $\\chi$ has direct implications on the secular behavior of the LS. Moreover, $\\chi$ is not necessarily constant.24 we now examine the effects on the LS of various hypothetical linear time series of $\\chi$ using the following specification: $\\ln(1-\\chi)=\\ln(1-\\chi_{0})+\\gamma t$ . Panel (b) of Figure 8 shows the combinations of initial values (horizontal axis) and growth rates (vertical axis) that imply either a secularly increasing LS (upper right region) or a secularly decreasing LS (lower left region). Sandwiched between the two regions is the region of $\\chi$ that implies a secularly trendless LS (solid black line) with the associated $95\\%$ confidence interval. First, if $1-\\chi$ is constant (i.e., $\\gamma$ equals zero), then the range of values for which the LS is trendless is $(1-\\chi)\\in[0.52,0.91]$ . That is, the LS significantly declines for values of $1-\\chi$ below 0.52 and significantly increases for values of $1-\\chi$ above 0.91. Second, the area in which the LS secularly declines is smaller the larger is the growth of $1-\\chi$ . For example, if we assume that $1-\\chi$ grows by $20\\%$ over the course of a century (i.e., an annual growth of $0.18\\%$ then the range of values for which the LS is trendless is $(1-\\chi)\\in[0.34,0.73]$  \n\nWhat are plausiblevalues for $\\chi\\mathrm{2}$ If some rents generated from IPP, which should be attributed to labor, are not captured by the BEA's compensation of employees (e.g., equity compensation for software developers), then empirically plausible values for $\\chi$ must be less than 1. Though inconclusive, the current estimates for $\\chi$ suggest that this is the case. McGrattan and Prescott (2010) used a latent variable approach to recover intangible assets (including but not limited to IPP) in a U.S. model economy and calibrated a benchmark value of $\\chi$ equal to 0.5. Using a nonrepresentative sample of the corporate sector, Lerner and Wulf (2007) showed that the ratio of the value of long-term incentives to cash compensation for corporate R&D heads more than doubled over the course of the 1990s, which implies that $1-\\chi$ increases from 0.25 in 1988 to 0.57 in 1998.25 In panel (c) of Figure 8, we plot the aforementioned estimates of $1-\\chi$ against their associated sample periods. We also entertain two alternative ready-to-use series of $\\chi$ . First, because the BEA equates the income generated from IPP investment to the expenditure on IPP, it seems natural to base the assumption about the factor distribution of IPP rents on the cost structure of IPP. Specifically, we construct $1-\\chi$ using the cost structure of R&D from the nationally representative Business Research and Development and Innovation Survey (BRDIS) of for-profit nonfarm businesses with five or more employees operating in the United States with known R&D activity.2° For our calculation of $\\chi$ , we use information about domestic R&D paid for by type of costs for all years available.27 Precisely, we use information about R&D costs in terms of wages, salaries, fringe benefits, and intermediate expenditures. This implies a measure of $1-\\chi$ equal to (Wages + Salaries $+$ Fringe Benefits)/(Total R&D Cost - Intermediate Expenses). We subtract R&D costs paid for materials and supplies as intermediate expenses from the total costs, because the classification of the cost as either capital or labor is ambiguous.28 Second, we treat IPP rents as ambiguous income in the same manner as we treat proprietor's income and taxes (less subsidies) in the construction of the LS. This implies $\\begin{array}{r}{\\dot{\\boldsymbol\\chi}=1-\\frac{\\mathrm{GOS}-I}{Y-I}}\\end{array}$ in equation (4). This measurement of $\\chi$ has the advantage that i i available for our entire sample period and is also invariant to the introduction of more types of intangible capital in national accounts.29 Panels (a) and (b) of Figure 8 show that all these alternative estimates of $\\chi$ deliver a secular LS that is trendless.  \n\n![](images/5471df39796a1b1862fa65276f395f777b896dfab2b3a8d5529ed40f8737a3d3.jpg)  \nFIGURE 8.-U.S.labor share under alternative assumptions on the factor distribution of IPP, $\\chi$  \n\nRelated issues on the measurement of investment. Our findings are directly related to the measurement of investment. The incorporation of IPP investment into GDP raises questions about how national accounts distinguish between intermediate expenditure and investment. The SNA proposes that expenditure that provides economic return for more than a year be considered as investment (see United Nations (2009) pp. 121-123); an accounting principle which, although followed by national statistical offices, is nevertheless arbitrary. Further, there is the added difficulty of measuring and determining the duration of economic returns that exceed the one-year threshold, in particular, for items with relatively high depreciation rates (e.g., software).  \n\nAn alternative to the challenging measurement of $\\chi$ and that of investment is to focus on a LS defined as the ratio of compensation of labor to total payouts to labor and owners of firms, where the measure of total payouts to labor and owners of firms is the sum of compensation of employees (CE) and gross operating surplus (GOs) less investment in equipment, structures, and intellectual property products.30 In effect, this is the Ls in  \n\n![](images/17fcbf19ce11d2f17b37c026a77c141822ca261314de1047b5ed880a10be6686.jpg)  \nFIGURE 9.—Expensing aggregate investment, BEA 1929-2018.  \n\nBarro (2019) where aggregate investment is expensed,  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{LS}=1-{\\frac{\\mathrm{GOS}-X-I}{Y-X-I}}={\\frac{\\mathrm{CE}}{\\mathrm{CE}+\\mathrm{DIV}}},\n$$  \n\nwhere ${\\mathrm{DIV}}={\\mathrm{GOS}}-X-I$ and $X$ is tangible investment. Notice that it makes no difference to the payout to owners of firms if expenditures on intangible investment are recorded as final investment expenditures or as expenditures on intermediate goods. If aggregate investment is fully expensed, then the economy-wide counterfactual accounting LS is trendless; see panel (a) of Figure 9. Nevertheless, expensing tangible investment alone cannot generate this result. To see this, we isolate the effects of expensing tangible investment (gray line) and expensing both tangible and IPP investment (black line), respectively. If we expense only tangible investment, then the counterfactual accounting LS still declines. The LS fattens out only when we additionally expense IPP investment. For the corporate sector, the LS is even increasing after expensing aggregate investment; see panel (b) of Figure 9.  \n\n## 6. CONCLUSION  \n\nWe show that the change in the accounting treatment of IPP gradually implemented by the BEA since 1999 is the sole driver of the decline of the LS. Moreover, our analysis indicates that less extreme accounting assumptions on the factor distribution of IPP rents yield a secularly trendless Ls. At the same time, the medium-run behavior of the LS (e.g., its rise in the 1960s, 1990s, and 2010s) and other higher-frequency fuctuations as described in Rios-Rull and Santaeulalia-Llopis (2010) do not seem to be accounted for by the capitalization of IPP and still beg for an explanation.  \n\n# REFERENCES  \n\nAKCIGIT, U., M.

KRAVIS\\*  \n\nDespite the prominence of functional income distribution in the history of economic thought and the recent evidences of a revival of interest in the subject,1 the theory of distribution remains in a parlous state. This is particularly true with respect to the aid it can give in explaining historical changes in relative shares. Part of the reason for the lack of more progress has been the tendency to deal with the problem in purely deductive terms; and when empirical factors have been taken into account, there has been a tendency to explain away evidences of a rising labor share and to regard division of income between labor and capital as having remained constant.?  \n\nOur examination of U. S. data for the past half century has led to the conclusion that the notion of long-run constancy in relative shares is false-at least for this country and period. There has actually been a shift in the distribution of national income from property to labor, and it is this which has to be explained. The size of the shift depends upon the particular assumptions used in allocating entrepreneurial income between its property and labor components, but there appears to be little doubt about the existence of the movement. Indeed, when the various biases in the statistical and accounting framework are taken into account, the net effect is to strengthen the impression of a notable change in relative shares. Labor's gain in terms of personal income is, as would be expected, much greater than in terms of national income.  \n\nThe main purpose of this paper is to set forth the evidence supporting these conclusions. The more interesting and challenging task of explain  \n\n\\* The author is professor of economics at the University of Pennsylvania.

Weintraut [37], which attempts to break new ground and which contains references to the recent theoretical literature. For citations of the recent empirical work see R. M. Solow [24].  \n\n2 The oversimplification involved in this view has been stressed in an international comparison of income shares by Simon Kuznets [20] which came to hand after this paper wascompleted.  \n\ning them requires a fuller understanding of the processes of economic change than economists possess at present. Some of the elements in the story can be identified but we can only speculate on their precise role. One important factor has been the change in the relative supplies of labor and capital. The number of man-hours worked has not expanded as fast as population despite the great rise in real hourly earnings, while reproducible capital (in constant prices) has nearly doubled in relation to man-hours. The greater responsiveness of the supply of capital to the demands of a growing economy has led to price-induced substitution with existing techniques and probably also to capital-using innovations. The opportunity for factor substitution in this historical rather than in a static sense has been of great practical importance as a built-in stabilizer of relative shares. Aside from relative factor supplies, shifts in the structure of industry, particularly those involving a diminution in the relative importance of agriculture, have probably operated to favor the labor share. Rising prices, by adversely affecting the incomes of rentiers, may also have contributed to the increase in the relative share of labor.  \n\n### I. The Empirical Evidence on Income Shares  \n\nThe study of the trends in the functional distribution of income is handicapped by the fact—-often commented upon [19, pp. 81-90] [20, p. 25]——-that the nature of the components of income for which we have data has not been determined by the requirements of the economists but by the legal and institutional arrangements of our society. The greatest differences between the classical concepts of factor shares and the concepts used in national accounting relate to rent and profit. The “rent\" of national accounting is the “rental income of persons\"’ and does not represent a scarcity return either on the indestructible resources of nature or on specific factors temporarily fixed in quantity. It does not even include the net income on all leased property, but only the portion thereof received by persons; the net income on real estate owned by businesses is not counted as rent but as part of corporate profits or unincorporated income. Corporate profits also include explicit or imputed interest received by firms, and the income of unincorporated enterprises contains not only rent and interest but also the return for the labor of proprietors.  \n\n#### A.A Threefold Division of Income  \n\nGiven this accounting framework, a threefold division of income into employee compensation, entrepreneurial (unincorporated) income, and property income (rent, interest and corporate profit) is perhaps most relevant to the study of functional shares. In these terms, we can see from the average shares for overlapping decades presented in Table 1 that employee compensation rose from 55 per cent of national income at the beginning of the century to 67 per cent in the $1930^{\\prime}\\mathrm{s}$ and remained at approximately that level in the ensuing decades. The bulk of the increase in the share of employee compensation in its period of expansion (between 1900-09 and 1930-39)? came at the expense of entrepreneurial income which declined from 24 to 15 per cent, but it should not be inferred that managerial employees were the main beneficiaries of the rise in employee compensation. On the contrary, the evidence we have indicates that there was only a small gain in the percentage share of corporate officers during the period when employee compensation rose most, and there has actually been a diminution in the executive share in recent decades (see Table 2).  \n\n(s ni  sas ed po sa) 一—一   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">Various Concepts Property Share, </td><td rowspan=\"3\">Share Total Property S</td><td rowspan=\"3\">Economy- wide Basis (11) Proportional Basis (10) Labor Basis Asset Basis</td><td>28.0 28.3 29.8 27.6 28.6 25.1</td><td>21.3 21.1 22.0 22.1 21.6</td></tr><tr><td>30.6 30.7 31.9 29.8 28.4</td><td>26.8 23.4 23.2 24.2 24.3 23.8 23.8</td></tr><tr><td>23.0 24.4 30.6 23.9 21.9 17.2</td><td>12.7 11.2 17.0 21.5 21.5 20.2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Interest, Rent and Corporate Profits E</td><td>21.4 21.8 22.6 21.8 22.0 21.1 18.1</td><td>17.8 18.4 18.3 18.1 18.9</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"6\">Distributive Shares</td><td>Total @</td><td>00 100 100</td><td>100 100 100 0 100 130 100</td></tr><tr><td>Rent</td><td>7.6 6.6 5.0 9</td><td>4.6 3.3 3.3 3.4 3.4</td></tr><tr><td>Interest ④</td><td>5. 5.8 3 6.2 8.1 5</td><td>8.2 8.9 6.0 3 2.7</td></tr><tr><td>Corporate Profits</td><td>6.8 7. 8.9 8.2 6.4</td><td>4.9 9.1 11.9 12.6 12.8</td></tr><tr><td>Entrepre- neurial Income 2</td><td>23.6 22.9 2. 0. 17.6 15.8</td><td>15.0 15.5 16.5 17.2 16.4 13.9</td></tr><tr><td>Employee Compen- sation E</td><td>55.0 55.2 2. 2 5. 3 5</td><td>0 1 6 67.1 3. 6 6 5 9 15</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Period</td><td>60-0061 1905-14 1910-19 1915-24 1920-29 1925-34</td><td>1930-39 1929-38 1934-43 1939-48 1944-53 1949-57</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTABLE 2—-SHARE IN NATIONAL INCOME OF COMPENSATION OF EMPLOYEES (percent)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>AllEmployees</td><td>Corporate Officers</td><td>OtherEmployees</td></tr><tr><td>1919-24</td><td>60.3</td><td>3.6</td><td>56.7</td></tr><tr><td>1928-37</td><td>65.4</td><td>4.3</td><td>61.1</td></tr><tr><td>1929-38</td><td></td><td></td><td>62.3</td></tr><tr><td>1934-43</td><td>66.6 65.1</td><td>4.3 3.6</td><td>61.5</td></tr><tr><td>1939-48</td><td>64.6</td><td>2.9</td><td>61.7</td></tr><tr><td>1944-53</td><td>65.6</td><td>2.8</td><td>62.8</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nSources: As in Table 1 except for shares of corporate officers in 1919-24 and 1928-37 which are based on S. Kuznets [19, pp. 216, 853].  \n\nPerhaps in view of the perquisites of corporate officers that escape taxation and would be difficult to evaluate for income accounting purposes even if all the facts were known, these figures must be seasoned with several grains of salt. However, the understatement in recent years compared with earlier ones would have to be substantial to offset the impression of a declining relative share. Even, for example, if we add 50 per cent to the average income of corporate officers for the 1944-53 decade, the share of corporate officers in national income does not quite come up to their 1929-38 share. It is still possible, however, that the in  \n\n\\*For this and certain other series, the 'thirties represent a dividing decade with one type of behavior characteristic of the period before and another of the period after.Since the underlying sources are also different before and after the 'thirties, this raises the question whether the variation inbehavior results merely from differences in statisticaltreatment.Fortunately we are able to present figures from both the earlier (largely Kuznets) and later(Department of Commerce）sources for the'thirties,and the close similarity in the two sets of figures offers some reassurance about the comparability of the two sets of data. Some of the conceptual differences, which have become quantitatively significant inthe'fortiesand'fifties,arediscussedinthetextsubsequently.  \n\ncome share of corporate managerial employees below the officer category has been rising.  \n\nIt seems likely that the upward trend in wages or total employee compensation and the decline in entrepreneurial income have their beginnings back in the 19th century. E. C. Budd has estimated that the share of wages in private income rose from about 43 per cent in 1869-70 to around 48 per cent in 1909-10 [1].  \n\nThe long-run rise in the employee share and decline in the share of business income are closely related to two other important and interrelated trends in the nation's economic structure-the change from an agricultural to an industrial country and the shift out of selfemployment into wage and salary employment. The proportion of persons engaged in agriculture declined from more than half of the work force in 1870 to less than 40 per cent at the turn of the century, to 10 per cent and less in the $\\pm950^{\\circ}\\mathsf{s}$ , while the proportion of employees rose from 58 per cent in 1870 to 64 per cent at the turn of the century and to around 85 per cent in the $1950^{\\prime}{\\mathsf{s}}$  \n\nThe share of property income (interest, rent and corporate profit) hovered around a level of 21 or 22 per cent from 1900-09 to 1925-34, and around 18 or 19 per cent since 1930-39. This relative stability of the property share has, however, been the product of offsetting shifts in its components particularly interest and corporate profits. In eight out of the ten decade-to-decade changes in Table 1, the interest and corporate profits shares move in opposite directions, describing about one and one-half long cycles during the half century or more. There was a peak in the profits share and a trough in the interest share in the prosperous first world war decade, a profits trough and interest peak in the depressed 'thirties, and high profits and low interest shares in the prosperous 'forties and 'fifties. This seesaw relationship between a return based upon a fixed claim and one representing a residual share contrasts with the decline in the rent share from 9.1 per cent in 1900-09 to around $3\\%$ per cent in 1934-43 and the ensuing periods. In a sense, this reduction in the rent share plays an important role in producing the relative stability of the property share. Compared to most former decades, the recent levels of the profit share tend to be higher by a larger number of percentage points than the interest share is lower, and, were it not for the fact that the rent share has only been one-half or one-third of its former levels, the property share would have risen.  \n\nnet rental income from residential property, and it might be thought that the decline in the rent share could be traced to a reduction in the relative importance of housing services in total consumption as the level of aggregate consumption per capita has increased. Indeed, it is possible that the relative importance of buildings in general might have diminished in an economy expanding in per capita income and wealth.  \n\nIf we approach this question from the consumption side, we find conflicting evidence concerning the trend in the proportion of housing \"rent\" to total consumption. While Kuznets' data indicate that housing remained around 14 per cent of total consumption from 1899-1908 to 1929-38, Dewhurst's estimates suggest a decline of 36 per cent in the housing share in consumption during a period in which the rent share in income dropped by 64 per cent.6 Evidence from survey sources, although far from satisfactory, tends to support the Kuznets rather than the Dewhurst findings on this point.  \n\nNor did the relative importance of residential real estate in incomeproducing assets diminish during the period when the rent share declined so precipitously. If anything, the share of nonfarm residences in total private tangible assets (other than consumer durables) was slightly higher after 1929 than before, but this was offset or more than offset by a fairly pronounced decline in the share of other structures [8, p. 306].  \n\nThere is some evidence, however, that rent-yielding assets (land and buildings) did diminish in relative importance in the investment holdings of individuals. Goldsmith's balance sheets of national wealth indicate that the share of such assets in the total earning assets held by households diminished from 45 per cent in 1900 to 40 per cent in 1949.7 The implication is that there was a trend toward the replacement of amateur real estate lessors (including owners occupying their own dwellings) by lessors making a regular business of owning and leasing real estate. This would, of course, cause a shift in the reporting of the income yielded by real property from the category of rent to the category of business income. However, the decline in the relative importance of rent-yielding assets held by households is not great enough to account for more than a small part of the contraction in the rent share. On the other hand, it is not beyond the realm of possibility that the trend toward business ownership and leasing of property may be refected more fully in the income estimates than in the wealth data.\\* The difference would have to be substantial to help us very much, and, on the whole, it seems unlikely that changed institutional arrangements relating to real property ownership and management are primarily responsible for the diminished importance of rents in national income. The role of more purely economic factors--viz., supply and demand relationships-will be discussed subsequently in connection with the more general question of the change in the property share as a whole.?  \n\n### B. The Division of Income between Property and Labor  \n\nAlthough the threefold division into labor, entrepreneurial and property shares is as far as the usual accounting records of the economy can carry us, it is necessary to attempt to divide entrepreneurial income into its labor and property components if we are to probe some questions that arise: Has the increase in the share of labor been attributable mainly to the shift from self-employment in the proprietorship form to employment under the corporate form of business organization? What has happened to the share of income representing returns to the current efforts of persons engaged in economic activity (i.e., what we shall call the “labor” share) as compared to the share representing the return on past accumulations of wealth (i.e., what we shall call the “property\" share) ?  \n\nOf course, if all or virtually all of entrepreneurial income could be considered as a reward for the labor of the entrepreneur, the answer to these questions would be very simple. In that case, our findings would be that the relative shares of labor and property in the national income have remained almost constant for more than half a century with only a slight shift in favor of labor in the years around 1930.  \n\nThe difficulty with this view is that it implicitly assumes that the returns upon the assets of unincorporated enterprises have been zero or negligible. These assets form a substantial, albeit declining, share of total private wealth. In 1956, unincorporated businesses and farms accounted for 23 per cent of the total tangible assets of the private sector (excluding consumer durable goods); in 1900, they accounted  \n\n8 Goldsmith's wealth balance sheets, for example, do not show any ownership of residential property by unincorporated businesses.  \n\n\\* The rent figures probably are the least reliable of the various share estimates [32, p. 86]. However, there is no obvious reason for believing that a downward bias of increasing severity has crept into the estimates; and in view of the size of the reduction it seems improbable that the change could be explained on this basis.  \n\nfor 41 per cent.r° Therefore, the assumption about the rate of return earned by these assets is critical to an evaluation of the property share in entrepreneurial income.  \n\nOne possible assumption is that the rate of yield upon entrepreneurial property has been the same as that upon other property. The entrepreneurial property share in national income can then be calculated by applying to the share of other property (i.e., the combined share of interest, rent and corporate profits) the ratio of the value of entrepreneurial to other property. When the entrepreneurial property shares calculated in this fashion are added to the other property shares (interest, rent, and corporate profits) to obtain what may be called the total property share the results are as shown in column 8 of Table 1. This will be referred to as the “asset basis’\" for estimating the property share in entrepreneurial income.  \n\nThe asset basis regards the return to entrepreneurial labor as the residual component of entrepreneurial income. It seems just as logical —-and has the sanction of at least occasional practice-—to calculate the labor component directly and to regard the property portion as the residual return. This can be done by assuming that the annual value of the labor of a proprietor was equal to the annual earnings of a hired worker. The figures produced by this approach, the “labor basis\" for splitting up entrepreneurial income, are presented in column 9 of Table 1.11  \n\nThe difficulty with both the asset and labor bases is that they tend to concentrate the effects of fuctuations in the entrepreneurial share upon one or the other component. It may be more realistic to argue that when the entrepreneur commits his labor and capital to an enterprise, he is taking the risk that he will get much less than the market rates of return on both the labor and capital in the hope, of course, that he will get much more. Since the two types of input are jointly committed,  \n\n10 The percentages were calculated from R. Goldsmnith's national balance sheets [7, pp. 42-56]. The percentages for the years for which Goldsmith presented balance sheets are as follows:  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>1900</td><td>41</td><td>1929</td><td>28</td><td>1945</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>1912</td><td>43</td><td>1933</td><td>24</td><td>1949</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>1922</td><td>35</td><td>1939</td><td>24</td><td>1956</td><td>23</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThe 1956 figure is based on data kindly supplied by Goldsmith.  \n\n11 Since the labor earnings of proprietors were assumed to be the same as employees, the share of national income accounted for by proprietors’ labor earnings could be obtained by multiplying the wage and salary share by the ratio of proprietors to employees. The numbers of proprietors and employees for 1929-57 were obtained from Commerce data [33], for 1919-29 from Kuznets [19, pp. 334, 340], for 1909-19 from Creamer [3, pp. 129-30], and for 1900 and 1910 from Budd [1, App. A]. For 1909-19 the number of'proprietors was extrapolated from Kuznets 1919 figures [19,p. 340] by an index based on estimates by King [14, p.62].  \n\nthere is a case for allowing both to share in the ups and downs of entrepreneurial income. This suggests that entrepreneurial income be divided into the labor and property components in constant proportions. Using a rough generalization of estimates of the labor and property shares in entrepreneurial income prepared by D. G. Johnson [11, p. 726], we have taken 65 per cent as labor and 35 per cent as property income.1² The total property shares on the basis of these proportions are given in column 10 of Table 1.  \n\nAny such constant division of entrepreneurial income between property and labor is subject to the objection that it ignores the forces at work in the economy shifting the balance between labor and property incomes-the very tendencies we are studying. An allocation basis which meets this criticism and still avoids concentrating the effects of the vicissitudes of entrepreneurial fortune on one share or the other is to divide the income of noncorporate business for each period in accordance with the current relationship between labor and property income in the entire economy excluding the entrepreneurial sector. We have labeled this the “economy-wide' basis (see column 11 of Table 1).  \n\nThe addition of entrepreneurial property returns to the other property shares produces total property shares that are substantially smaller in recent decades than at the beginning of the century except when the labor basis is used, in which case the decline is modest. On all four approaches there was a sharp drop in the total property share between 1910-19 and 1930-39 when the share of entrepreneurial income fell from 24 to 15 per cent. The decline was the most precipitous in terms of the labor basis, since this method has the effect of assigning to labor almost the whole of entrepreneurial income during the decades affected by the great depression when business earnings were low. With economic recovery, however, the labor basis results in a sharp rise in  \n\n12 Johnson calculated the capital component of farm operators' income by applying current rents to farm land, and current interest rates to the value of farm inventories [10, p.726].He divided the income of nonfarm proprietorships on the basis of (1) the relative importance of property and labor in income originating in corporate manufacturing and (2） the relationship between wages paid by noncorporate enterprises and the net income of such businesses [11, pp. 176-77]. Johnson's reasoning with respect to nonfarm enterprises began with the idea that the property share which was 25 per cent of corporate income,was less, perhaps only 20 or 15 per cent,of noncorporate income. Since virtually all property income in unincorporated enterprises is part of proprietors’ income and since in proprietorships wages and entrepreneurial income have been about equal, a 20 per cent property share for the enterprise means a 40 per cent property share in entrepreneurial income. Johnson felt warranted in taking 20 per cent as the property share for the enterprise, but he settled on a 35 rather than 40 per cent property share in entrepreneurial income in order to allow for the fact that some property used by entrepreneurs is not owned by them. Cf. also G. J. Schuller [23] whose estimates with respect to the broad division between labor, entrepreneurial and property shares suggest conclusions similar to those reached above.  \n\nthe total property share, whereas the other approaches show only very slight or no increases.  \n\nOur methods in connection with all four techniques are, of course, susceptible of substantial refinement, and even with the same basic method many alternative assumptions with respect to the returns to labor or capital are possible. In particular, it would be preferable to value the services of labor and capital in accordance with the returns prevailing in each sector of the economy rather than in the economy as a whole. For example, the labor performed by entrepreneurs in agriculture and trade, who even in recent years have accounted for about two-thirds of all proprietors, should be valued at annual earnings of employees in those industries rather than (as we have done) at annual earnings of employees in the economy as a whole. Similarly, in place of the economy-wide approach, it would have been desirable to allocate entrepreneurial income in each sector between property and labor on the basis of the division in the corporate portion of the sector.  \n\nWhile our methods of estimation have infuenced the results, the share figures are in an even more fundamental sense the product of the particular accounting framework under which they were produced. While there is on the whole widespread agreement upon the methods of social accounting, some issues which may affect the income share estimates remain controversial.13 In addition, even some of the conventional procedures that are followed may have won agreement more on the ground of statistical convenience than conceptual adequacy. We are faced with the question, therefore, whether the trend in shares that we have observed-—-particularly the decline in the property sharewould persist if the issues concerning accounting methods had been resolved in another way. We will consider the effect upon shares of (1) the shift of certain activities from households to the market, (2) the omission from the national accounts of the returns on certain types of property (viz., property owned by government and durable goods other than residences owned by consumers), (3) the exclusion from the estimates of interest on government debt and the inclusion of the compensation of government employees, (4) the Department of Commerce practice of using historical rather than replacement-cost depreciation, and (5) the effect of changes in tax laws and regulations governing depreciation allowances.  \n\n1. The effect of the monetization of household activities is difficult to quantify. However, its possible impact is somewhat offset by the fact that not all of household production can be taken as representing service income; at least a small share must be regarded as income derived from property.  \n\n2. Rough calculations make it appear unlikely that the inclusion of income from government property and consumer durables would obliterate the decline in the property share. If we use R. Goldsmith's national wealth estimates14 and assume that the return on these types of property was equal to that on the types whose earnings are included in the national accounts, the share of property in the national income declines from 31.1 per cent in 1900-09 to 26.2 per cent in 1949-57 instead of from 28 to 22 per cent as the economy-wide basis estimates of Table 1 show. Since approximately 15 to 20 per cent of the tangible assets owned by government consisted of stocks of monetary metals and roughly another 25 to 50 per cent consisted of public land, and since our assumption implies that the return on government property was equal to that of private property, we may well have overstated the extent to which the inclusion of income from government property would modify the observed change in income shares. A similar calculation, in which only consumer durables are added, produces a property share of 29.4 per cent in 1900-09 and 23.8 per cent in 1949-57. Thus it is clear that the share of property in the national income declined notably even if generous allowance is made for income from types of property omitted from conventional national income accounting.  \n\nTABLE 3--GOVERNMENT INTEREST ASPERCENTAGE OF NATIONALINCOME   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Kuznets'estimates:</td></tr><tr><td>1919-28</td><td>1.7</td></tr><tr><td>1929-38</td><td>2.4</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">DepartmentofCommerceestimates:</td></tr><tr><td>1929-38</td><td>1.9</td></tr><tr><td>1934-43</td><td>1.6</td></tr><tr><td>1939-48</td><td>1.7</td></tr><tr><td>1944-53</td><td>1.9</td></tr><tr><td>1949-57</td><td>1.7</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\na National income is inclusive of net interest payments by government. Sources: S. Kuznets [19, pp. 137, 811]; Department of Commerce [34, pp. 4, 6].  \n\n3. Whether net interest paid by government should be treated as a factor return or as a transfer is a moot question. The interest shares in Table 1 exclude such payments, thus following the Department of Commerce in regarding them as transfers.15 Judging from the estimates  \n\n1 [7, Pp. 14-15, 42-56]. Data for 1950 and 1955, also prepared by Goldsmith [29, p.123], were averaged and taken as representative of 1949-57.  \n\nJohnson adjusted the original Kuznets interest series so as to exclude net interest payments by government, so the figures in Table 1 are consistent in this respect throughouttheentireperiod.  \n\nof government interest from 1919-28 onwards in Table 3, their inclusion would tend to raise the level of the interest and property shares by 1 or 2 percentage points but would have no effect upon the trend.  \n\nHowever, an alternative adjustment, and possibly a preferable one, is to exclude income originating in the government altogether. For the period since 1929, this is easily done by subtracting the compensation of government employees from employee compensation and national income. For the years prior to 1929, when Johnson's version of Kuznets' estimates are used, the same adjustments are made though the justification for so simple a procedure is more dubious. The results, shown in Table 4, do little to alter the conclusion that the share of employee compensation has risen over the period as a whole, but they do throw into question the secular trend in the labor share (economy-wide basis) particularly since 1929. If this were the final adjustment that had to be made, our conclusion would be that much of the increase in the labor share observed in the data for the half century was attributable to the growth in relative importance of government employment and to the circumstance that the current method of accounting for government product leaves no room for returns to any factor but labor.  \n\nTABLE 4—LABOR SHARES,EXCLUDING COMPENSATION OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES FROM EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND NATIONALINCOME   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Employee Compensation</td><td>Labor Sharea</td><td></td><td>Employee Compensation</td><td>Labor Sharea</td></tr><tr><td>1900-09</td><td>53.3</td><td>70.7</td><td>1929-38</td><td>62.9</td><td>75.5</td></tr><tr><td>1905-14</td><td>53.5</td><td>70.3</td><td>1934-43</td><td>60.5</td><td>73.4</td></tr><tr><td>1910-19</td><td>51.5</td><td>68.6</td><td>1939-48</td><td>59.5</td><td>72.4</td></tr><tr><td>1915-24</td><td>54.6</td><td>70.1</td><td>1944-53</td><td>61.0</td><td>72.6</td></tr><tr><td>1920-29</td><td>58.4</td><td>71.7</td><td>1949-57</td><td>63.2</td><td>72.2</td></tr><tr><td>1925-34</td><td>61.6</td><td>73.9</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1930-39</td><td>63.6</td><td>76.2</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n&Economy-widebasis.

The Department of Commerce, upon whose data we rely for the years since 1929, estimates business and national income by deducting from gross product capital consumption allowances which, except for agriculture, are based upon original rather than replacement cost. From the standpoint of measuring relative shares in income, there may be some preference for calculating property and national income on the basis of replacement cost. In a period of rising prices, it can be argued, original cost depreciation tends to overstate the property share because it leads to the inclusion in income of what is really a diminution in the real value of capital assets. Contrariwise, in a period of falling prices original cost depreciation tends to understate the property share because it results in the overvaluation of the actual consumption of capital assets in current production.  \n\nWhen replacement cost depreciation is used instead of original cost,  \n\nTABLE 5-TOTAL PROPERTY SHARE (ECONOMY-WIDE BASIS)AS AFFECTED BY METHODOFDEPRECIATION   \n(Average of percentage shares for individual years)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">DepreciationatOriginalCost</td><td colspan=\"2\">DepreciationatReproduction Cost</td></tr><tr><td>Including Government</td><td>Excluding Government</td><td>Including Government</td><td>Excluding Government</td></tr><tr><td>1929-38</td><td>21.1</td><td>24.5</td><td>20.7</td><td>23.5</td></tr><tr><td>1934-43</td><td>22.0</td><td>26.6</td><td>21.3</td><td>24.8</td></tr><tr><td>1939-48</td><td>22.1</td><td>27.6</td><td>20.8</td><td>24.6</td></tr><tr><td>1944-53</td><td>21.6</td><td>27.4</td><td>19.5</td><td>22.8</td></tr><tr><td>1949-57</td><td>22.0</td><td>27.8</td><td>19.3</td><td>22.1</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nSources: Original cost depreciation shares from Table 1. Replacement cost depreciation shares calculated by adding to Commerce depreciation allowances [34, p. 6] an estimate of the difference between replacement and original cost depreciation. Kuznets' estimates of replacement cost depreciation, adjusted by him to exclude depreciation on government capital, were used [17,Table A-4,Col.6].Kuznets'data were available only through 1953;the estimate for 1949-57 in above table is therefore based upon the present author's rough extrapolations. The excess of replacement over original cost depreciation was allocated between corporate and noncorporate enterprise on the basis of the relative amounts of original cost depreciation. Original cost depreciation is given separately for the corporate and noncorporate sectors beginning with 1946 in Department of Commerce estimates [35, pp. 216-17]. Corporate depreciation was extrapolated back to 1929 on the basis of estimates for manufacturing depreciation by D. C. Wooden and R. C. Wasson [39], and noncorporate depreciation was taken astheresidual.  \n\nthe property share in 1949-57 is slightly lower than in 1929-38 whether the compensation of government employees is included or not (see Table 5). The economy-wide property share in privately produced income declines from 29.3 per cent in 1900-09 to 22.1 per cent in 1949-57.16  \n\n18 It is diffcult to evaluate the effect of the method of depreciation upon the pre-1929 estimates in Table 1. The figures for these earlier years are fundamentally backward extrapolations of Commerce Department data on the basis of shares in aggregate payments. To the extent that the resultant estimates are closer to those that would have been obtained by the application of replacement cost depreciation, our conclusion would be that there has been a fairly consistent downward trend in the property share in national income dating from the second decade of the current century. If, on the other hand, the pre-1929 estimates are closer to those that would have been obtained by the use of original cost depreciation, adustment to a replacement cost basis would, in view of the rising price trends in the first quarter of a century, make for an even sharper decline in the property share than our figures show and also might well indicate that the beginning of the drop goes all the way back to the start of the century.  \n\nTABLE 6—-LABOR SHARES IN NATIONAL INCOME SINCE 1929, CYCLICAL PEAKS   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"3\"></td><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\">Compensationof Employees</td><td colspan=\"4\">Economy-WideLaborShare NonfarmDepreciation at</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Original Cost Reproduction Cost</td></tr><tr><td>Including</td><td>Excluding Government/Government/Government</td><td>Including</td><td>Excluding Government/GovernmentGovernment</td><td>Including</td><td>Excluding</td></tr><tr><td>1929</td><td>58.2</td><td>55.7</td><td>69.9</td><td>66.8</td><td>70.5</td><td>68.3</td></tr><tr><td>1937</td><td>65.1</td><td>61.2</td><td>78.7</td><td>74.6</td><td>79.5</td><td>76.7</td></tr><tr><td>1944</td><td>66.4</td><td>58.6</td><td>79.2</td><td>72.0</td><td>80.0</td><td>74.4</td></tr><tr><td>1948</td><td>63.1</td><td>59.4</td><td>76.9</td><td>71.6</td><td>79.4</td><td>77.0</td></tr><tr><td>1953</td><td>68.3</td><td>64.4</td><td>78.8</td><td>73.6</td><td>81.1</td><td>78.2</td></tr><tr><td>1957</td><td>69.7</td><td>66.3</td><td>79.3</td><td>73.4</td><td>83.7</td><td>81.2</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nSources: As in Tables 4 and 5.  \n\n5. On the other hand, changes in tax laws and regulations permitting accelerated depreciation in the second world war, after the Korean episode and again in the Revenue Code of 1954, led to an overstatement of depreciation and a corresponding understatement of profits in Department of Commerce statistics for recent years relative to earlier ones. The only available estimate of the magnitudes involved indicates that the profit share in 1957 would be one or two percentage points higher if depreciation were computed on the prewar basis [35, p. 15]. It is doubtful that this correction would completely eliminate the downward movement in the property share (see Table 6).  \n\nTaking all factors into account, we conclude that the decline in the property share in national income over the first half of the 2Oth century has been substantial, and that it cannot be explained away either by our methods of estimation or by the vagaries of the social accounting system. This is true, however, only of the general direction of the change between the beginning and end of the half century or more with which we are concerned; the magnitude of the change and its continuity during the period do depend upon the techniques employed to separate the labor and property components of entrepreneurial income.  \n\nFor the period since 1929 in particular, the measurement of long-term trends in relative shares is greatly complicated, first by the effects of the great depression in producing extraordinarily low property and high labor shares, and secondly by the great wartime increase in government payrolls which accentuated the impact upon relative shares of the accounting conventions employed in estimating income originating in government. An attempt is made in Table 6 to evade at least the first of these difficulties by studying the income shares in successive cyclical peak years for indications of trend.

Sources: 1919-38: S. Kuznets' shares of corporate dividends and corporate saving [19, p. 217] in national income adjusted so as to include the federal corporate income and excess profits taxes as shown by G. J. Schuller [23,p.312]. The shares of corporate profits in the above estimates,it should be noted, differ somewhat from those in Table 1, mainly because different sources and methods were used in deriving the figures.  \n\n1929-57: Commerce Department data [34].  \n\nin the labor share is strengthened if allowances are made for the special circumstances of 1937 and 1944, the former being depressed relative to the other years notwithstanding its position as a cyclical peak in the National Bureau chronology' and the latter being a war year in which government payrolls were double what they had been two years earlier and one and a half times what they were to be two years later. It must be added, however, that averages for overlapping cycles, alternating peak-to-peak and trough-to-trough cycles, show no trend even though the final peak-to-peak cycle (1953-57) has a higher labor share (on a reproduction cost basis) than any other since 1929. Weighing this negative finding against the evidence in Tables 5 and 6, the safest conclusion appears to be that the property share since 1929, even on a reproduction cost basis, has been characterized by near secular stability with some evidence of a slight tendency to drift downwards.  \n\nBefore turning to the possible reasons for the decline in the property share over the period as a whole, we will take some account of the manner in which these and related shifts have affected the recipients of labor and property incomes. In this connection, particular significance must be attached to the growing role of corporate profits in the composition of property incomes. Unlike the other property shares, allocations to taxes and undistributed profits may create a substantial gap between profits earned by corporations and income actually paid out by them to income receivers in the form of dividends. The record for the period since the first world war is shown in Table 7.  \n\nWell over half of the relative rise in corporate profits from the 'twenties and the 'thirties has been accounted for by the increase in tax liability. The share of dividends in the national income has actually decreased. The implication is that property income has declined relative to labor income in terms of income actually paid to income recipients (personal income) even more than it has in terms of income earned (national income).  \n\nThe data in Table 8, showing the distributive shares in personal income for overlapping decades, confirm this. Between the 'thirties and the 'fifties, the share of rent, interest and dividends combined declined by 8 percentage points, of which 6 were gained by labor incomes and 2 by transfer receipts. The total property share also shows up with a much less favorable trend on the personal income basis than on the national income basis, at least for the period since the 'thirties. Whereas the figures in Table 1 relating to national income show the total property share holding its own or even gaining since 1929, those of Table 8 relating to personal income indicate that this is true only when the labor basis is used. On the other bases the total property share declines from the 24 to 26 per cent range in 1929-38 to the 14 to 17 per cent range in 1949-57. For the period preceding 1929, transfers and corporate taxes, which constitute the most important differences between national and personal income, were of smaller quantitative significance, and the shares in personal income are not far different in magnitude and direction of change from the shares in national income. Thus, if we avoid the assumption that the vicissitudes of entrepreneurial fortunes are absorbed entirely by one factor or the other, the total property share in personal income declines from 28 or 30 per cent in 1909-18 to 14 or 17 per cent in 1949-57. Service income (i.e., income from employment and the labor share of entrepreneurial income), the other major share, thus gained 6 percentage points in the national income and more than twice as many points in personal income. The impact of the shifts were the greater since the groups relying primarily upon labor incomes probably benefited more from the rise in transfer receipts than did those to whom property incomes were important.  \n\nIn appraising these results we must, once again, take account of the conceptual underpinnings. The accounting problems we considered in connection with shares in national income either are of limited quantitative significance for personal as for national income, or, as in the case of the valuation basis used for depreciation, irrelevant for the personal income concept. However, since our interest in shares in personal income is more directly related to the fortunes of particular groups of income recipients, we must consider the possibility that differential price movements have offset the welfare effects of the changes.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"5\">Commerce DepartmentDataa</td><td>1949-57</td><td>67.7 14.7 (4.9) (9.8) 3.6 3.5 4.8 5.6 100.0 11.9</td><td>78.0</td><td>16.4 80.1 14.3</td><td>77.4</td><td>17.0 80.2 14.2</td></tr><tr><td>1944-53</td><td>66.4 17.4 (6.8) (10.6) 3.6 3.3 4.3 5.1 100.0 11.2</td><td>79.4 15.5</td><td>80.0 14.9</td><td>77.6 17.3</td><td>81.2 13.7</td></tr><tr><td>1939-48</td><td>65.6 18.2 (7.3) (10.9) 5 3.7 5.0 3.9 100.0 12.2 3</td><td>78.9 17.1</td><td>80.3</td><td>15.8 77.5</td><td>18.5 81.0 15.1</td></tr><tr><td>1934-43</td><td>63.8 16.8 (6.7) (10.1) 3.3 4.9 7.6 3.6 100.0 15.8</td><td>75.5 20.9</td><td>82.1 14.3</td><td>74.7 21.7</td><td>77.2 19.2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1929-38 61.5</td><td>14.7 (5.9) (8.8) 4.3 5.7 10.1 3.7 100.0 20.1</td><td>69.8 26.5</td><td>83.7 12.6</td><td>71.1 25.2 72.6 23.7</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"4\">NationalBureauDataa</td><td>1929-38</td><td>64.4 14.6 (5.9) (8.7) 5.0 6.0 7.2 2.9 100.0 18.2</td><td>73.1 24.0</td><td>84.3 12.8</td><td>73.9 23.3</td><td>75.7 21.4</td></tr><tr><td>1924-33</td><td>64.1 15.9 (6.4) (9.5) 6.3 6.3 7.3 100.0 19.9</td><td>72.3 27.7</td><td>84.1 15.9</td><td>74.4 25.5</td><td>76.3 23.7</td></tr><tr><td>1919-28</td><td>61.4 19.6 (8.3) (11.3) 7.3 5.6 6.1 100.0 19.0</td><td>71.5 28.5</td><td>80.9 19.1</td><td>74.1 25.9</td><td>76.4 23.6</td></tr><tr><td>1914-23</td><td>56.3 24.3 (10.6) (13.7) 8.9 5.7 4.8 100.0 19.4 ol</td><td>69.0 31.0</td><td>Proportional basis 78.1 21.9 Laborbasis</td><td>Economy-wide basis 72.1 27.9</td><td>74.4 25.6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1909-18</td><td>51.9 24 (11.8) (15.6) 10.7 6.0 4.0 100.0 20.7</td><td>Asset basis 64.6 35.4</td><td>70.2 29.8 B</td><td>69.7 30.3 C D.</td><td>71.5 28.5</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td>b.Business and professions Entrepreneurial income Labor incomeb a.Farm Dividends Interest Rent 2 3 4 5</td><td>Total labor (service) and total property sharesd with entrepreneurial income allcated on: Rent, dividends and interest Transfers Total 0 67</td><td>10.

The shift of labor from farm to nonfarm jobs represented by the decline in the agricultural portion of the labor force from 33 per cent in 1900-09 to 10 per cent in 1949-57 meant that the money incomes of workers as reflected in the national accounts increased more than their real incomes. The gap between farm and nonfarm labor money incomes was sufficiently great in 1900-09 (the farm average was $\\$144$ per annum and the nonfarm average was $\\$536$ ) so that this shift away from agriculture could have been responsible for a rise in the service share in national income (calculated on the economy-wide basis) from 72 to 75.8 per cent even if no other factors were operative.1 (This compares with the actual increase from 72 per cent in 1900-09 to 78 per cent in 1949-57 shown in column 11 of Table 1.) The fact that almost twothirds of the observed increase in the service share could be attributable to the shift out of agriculture underlines the extent to which this increase might be a money rather than a real phenomenon. In order to deflate the increment in labor income resulting from the movement out of agriculture, we take the purchasing power of a dollar of nonfarm income as the equivalent of 70 per cent of that of a dollar of farm income. This represents a rough estimate intended to err on the side of exaggerating rather than minimizing the purchasing power difference; it is based on data in the 1941 BLS-BHNHE survey [27].2° If the property total is kept constant in dollar amount and the incomes of  \n\n18 [11, p. 180]. We follow Johnson here in discussing shares in national rather than personal income as a matter of convenience, though it is the latter that is relevant in this context.  \n\n1 The figures on farm and nonfarm incomes and labor force are from Johnson [11, pp. 180-81]. The present calculations follow those of Johnson in assuming that (a) the absolute dollar return to property remains unchanged while the dollar total for labor rises due to the shift from farm to nonfarm work, and (b) the rate of return on agricultural property is the same as on nonagricultural property.  \n\n2° Food, housing, fuel, light and refrigeration received in kind by rural families and single consumers during 1941 averaged $\\$497$ while the total value of consumption (including both money expenditures and receipts in kind) averaged $\\$1,344$ (p. 75). Receipts in kind were valued at retail prices in the rural community (p. 16) rather than as in the national accounts at prices received by farmers. If it is nevertheless assumed that the prices of consumption in kind were twice as great in the nonfarm areas while the prices of goods bought for money were the same, the nonfarm cost of the bundle of goods valued at $\\$1,344$ onthe farm would be \\$1,841. Thus the purchasing power of a nonfarm dollar would be 73 per cent of that of a farm dollar. For other calculations regarding the same point see Kuznets [18, pp. 60-62] and N. Koffsky [15, p. 170].  \n\nthe new workers on nonfarm jobs are defated to 70 per cent, the service share rises from 72 per cent in 1900-09 to 74.4 per cent in 1949-57. Thus, starting with a service share of 72 per cent, the shift out of agriculture was sufficient to raise the share to 75.8 in money terms and to 74.4 per cent in real terms. On this basis, a little more than one-third of the increase in the service share flowing from the shift out of agriculture represents a rise in money income only; the balance represents an increase in both money and real income.  \n\nThis kind of calculation, however, understates the extent of the increase in the real service share. The reason is that owners of property as well as providers of labor services have moved off the farms and into nonfarm areas. Indeed during the period when the share of agriculture in the labor force declined from 33 to 10 per cent, its share in the national wealth also declined substantially-from 28 to 11 per cent. Furthermore, in view of the commercialization of agriculture, it is reasonable to suppose that agricultural property owners are to a larger extent than formerly residents of nonfarm areas. Thus, if we are to calculate changes in real shares, we must know what changes have occurred in the purchasing power of a dollar's income to recipients of property incomes as well as to recipients of service incomes. A rather crude calculation based on the shift of two-thirds of the 1900-09 agricultural property income from farm to nonfarm recipients raises the deflated service share in the 1949-57 national income from 74.4 to 75.5 per cent.21  \n\nIt seems unlikely, therefore, that the shift in the composition of personal income from property owners to service recipients has been solely or even mainly a monetary or accounting phenomenon.  \n\n#### I1. Reasons for the Decline in the Property Share  \n\nThe more important factors accounting for the differences in the behavior of the shares in national income and the shares in personal income are fairly apparent. Government policies, reflected in the rise of corporate income taxes and transfer payments, have played a major role in bringing about a sharper contraction in the share of property returns in personal income than in national income. High corporate profits in recent decades have resulted in corporate saving in the form of undistributed profits amounting to 2 or 3 per cent of the national income and have thus further widened the gap between the property share  \n\n21 A two-thirds shift was taken to represent both the decline in the relative importance of agriculture as a source of property income (the decline in the farm share in the national wealth was 60 per cent—from 28 to 11 per cent),and the fact that more recipients of farm property income are urban dwellers than in the past. Here as in the previous calculations involving labor, we are interested in the effect of the shift out of agriculture into nonagriculture and thus we assume that the total quantities of capital and labor are fixed.  \n\nin earned income and the property share in income actually paid to income recipients. A shift from the generally sustained prosperity of the 'forties and 'fifties to less favorable conditions might, of course, change this picture drastically.  \n\nThe forces producing secular changes in the type-structure of national income are more difficult to explain. It is necessary to examine the other secular changes in the American economy, particularly the differential rates of growth in various dimensions of the economy. In Table 9 the changes in population, labor, capital, income, and prices are set forth in terms of averages for overlapping decades. Among the important changes between the opening and the closing decades are the following:  \n\nTABLE 9—-MACRO-VARIABLES RELATED TO INCOME SHARES, 1900-09 TO 1949-57   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Popu- lation (mil) (1)</td><td>Labor Force (mil) (2)</td><td>Man- Hours (bil) (3)</td><td>National Income ($ Bil) 1929 Prices (4)</td><td>Tangible Reproduci- ble Assets ($ Bil) 1929 Prices (5)</td><td>Total Wealth ($ Bil) 1929 Prices (6)</td><td>National.

The population doubled, but owing chiefy to a one-third reduction in the hours of work, total annual man-hours increased only by something more than 50 per cent. 2. Net accretions to wealth were substantial. Reproducible tangible assets (excluding durable consumers goods) in real terms were nearly three times larger in 1949-57 than in 1900-09. 3. Real income was $4\\%$ times larger in the aggregate, more than twice as large on a per capita or per worker basis, and three times greater per man-hour. 4. The price level (in terms of implicit national product defators) was three times higher at the end of the period than at the beginning. Because of differences in the rates of growth, capital expanded relative to labor but declined relative to income. As Table 10 indicates, real reproducible tangible assets per man-hour in 1949-57 were almost double the 1900-09 level, but, owing to the tripling of product per manhour, the capital-output ratio (with capital represented by reproducible tangible assets) at the close of the half century was only two-thirds the beginning level.  \n\nThe increases in the quantity of labor and the amount of capital played a modest role in accounting for the great growth in real product. The effect of the increased quantities per se may be approximated by assuming that the average return to labor and capital, each measured by dividing its quantity into its aggregate income, remained unchanged after 1900-09. In this event the rise in the quantities of labor and capital by 1949-57 would have produced an increment in real output equivalent only to one-fourth of the increase that actually occurred.22 Although other methods of estimation produce somewhat different results,23 there is little doubt that national output rose by much more than input. The greater growth in output must have been attributable to technical progress and/or economies of scale. Even if, as G. J. Stigler suspects [26] the economies of scale were of overwhelming importance in accounting for the growth in productivity, it seems probable that the historical development of economies of scale was itself dependent upon the discovery and utilization of new techniques. In attempting to explain the changes in factor shares, account must therefore be taken of the background of rapid economic growth made possible in large part by technical progress.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td>309 .284 .267 2. .194</td><td>.120 (.122)a (.134) (.136) .105 (.119) .092 (.109) 129 ( 13 1. 126</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">Price of Capital (Return per $100) Related to: Price of</td><td>Total Wealth</td><td>5.75 5.67 6.46 5.96 6.03</td><td>.86 (3.97)a (5.59) (7.40) (7.75) 6.61 (7.96) 5.32( 4.60 3.93 6.77 6.69(</td></tr><tr><td>Reproducible Assets</td><td>8.80 8.54 9.54 8.82 8.71 6.72 5.64</td><td>5.73)a 7.80) (10.07) 8.99 (10.40) 8.86 (10.67) 6. 4 9 5</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">(Wage per Labor Man- (moH E</td><td>.284 301 .357 .416 465 578 .733 .859 .964</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\" colspan=\"2\">Income (dollars) Per:</td><td>Man-Hour (9)</td><td>.395 .420 .508 .574 .627 .597 .591 .587 .735 .926</td></tr><tr><td>Capita (5)</td><td>490 558 594 5 3 942 1011 1049</td></tr><tr><td>Member of Labor Force ④</td><td>1186 1205 1384 1503 1578 1455 1392 1381 1705 2125 2322 2490</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">Ratio, Reproducible Capital to:</td><td rowspan=\"3\">Labor Per Mem-</td><td>Man-hour Per ?</td><td>.26 .39 1.59 1.79 2.06 2.23 2.23 2.19 2.11 2.10 2.32</td></tr><tr><td>ber of Labor Force</td><td>3773 3994 4323 4703 5184 5438 5251 5143 4894 4805 5046 5417</td></tr><tr><td>Product E</td><td>3.18 3.31 3.12 3.13 3.29 3.74 3.77 3.72 2.87 2.26 2.17 2.18</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td>1900-09 1905-14 1910-19</td><td>1915-24 1920-29 1925-34 1930-39 1929-38 1934-43 1939-48 1944-53 1949-57</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Sources:(Roman numerals refer tocolumns of Table 9): III→A Col.

Kaldor [12]. His basic equation may be written as follows:  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{R}{Y}}=\\left({\\frac{1}{s_{r}-s_{w}}}\\right)\\left({\\frac{I}{Y}}-s_{w}\\right)\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{I}=$ investment, $s\\ast=$ marginal propensity to save out of property income, $s\\boldsymbol{w}=$ marginal propensity to save out of wage income, and $R,W$ ,and $\\gamma$ have the same meanings as in the text.  \n\nKaldor advances the “Keynesian\" hypothesis that the investment propensity, $I/Y$ ,is an independent variable, invariant with respect to the two saving propensities, which determines $\\scriptstyle{R\\mathord{\\left/{\\vphantom{R\\partial{R}}}\\right.\\kern-\\nulldelimiterspace}Y}$ , the property share. However, our interest here is not so much in this theory as in the tautology itself which gathers together a different group of variables affecting relative shares than those we have used in the text.  \n\nKaldor's formulation calls attention to the relative changes in the propensities to save out of wage and property incomes, respectively. However, occupation and other socioeconomic characteristics of consumer units may be more important than the source of income in determining the disposition of income between spending and saving. Indeed, it is not clear that propensities to save out of particular types of income are meaningful concepts for empirical analysis since the groups which receive property incomes tend to earn significant amounts of labor income as well. For example, estimates prepared for a forthcoming study indicate that in 1950 urban consumer units headed by salaried managers received 25 per cent of total interest, dividends and rents accruing to all urban consumer units and 13.5 per cent of total wages and salaries, the former accounting for 21 per cent and the latter for 78 per cent of their income. Kaldor's formulation implies that these and others receiving incomes from different sources have different propensities to spend eachtypeof income.  \n\nLeaving these questions aside, we examine the inferences concerning the change in the property share that can be drawn from the variables in Kaldor's equation. We know from the investigation reported above that $R/Y$ declined from 28 per cent in 1900-09 to 19.3 per cent in 1949-57,and we have Kuznets’ estimates showing that I/Y—-actually, the ratio of net capital formation to net national product-was .135 in 1899-1900 and .074 in 1949-55 [17, Table III-8]. The saving propensities are, of course, unknown, but if, as Kaldor seems to believe, the propensities tend to remain unchanged over long periods of time, they may have been the same in both the beginning and terminal decades of our period. This gives us two equations, one for each decade, with the two saving propensities as unknowns. The values come out to .643 for sr and --.062 for Su.On the assumption of constant propensities, the implication is that the decline in the property share was associated with the decline in the investment propensity. However, we have no knowledge of the actual behavior of the propensities, or, indeed, whether they can actually be calculated meaningfully. An increase in sr or in (sr -- Ssu) or a decrease in Sw, with I/Y constant,would alsohavelowered $R/Y$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c c}{{{\\cal L}=\\mathrm{labor}}}&{{W=\\mathrm{aggregate}}}\\ {{{\\cal K}=\\mathrm{capital}}}&{{{\\cal R}=\\mathrm{totalprope}}}\\ {{{\\cal R}}}&{{{\\cal Y}=\\mathrm{totalincol}}}\\ {{\\displaystyle\\frac{{\\cal R}}{W}=\\frac{Q\\kappa}{Q_{L}}\\times\\frac{P_{\\kappa}}{P_{L}}.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThus the relation of property to wage income?5 can be regarded as the product of the capital-labor quantity and price ratios, and changes in the division of income result from changes in these ratios. Since the ratio of the percentage change in the quantity ratio to the percentage change in the price ratio is equal to the elasticity of substitution [9, Ch. 4], we are dealing with the familiar proposition that changes in relative shares depend upon the elasticity of substitution.  \n\nNow if we could assume that the price and quantity ratios would move in opposite directions, the opportunity for factor substitution would clearly serve as a built-in stabilizing mechanism limiting changes in relative shares. Where the opposite percentage changes in the quantity and price ratios are equal—-i.e., where the elasticity of substitution is unityrelative shares will of course remain unchanged. Even with fairly large departures from unity, however, factor substitution may confine share shifts to fairly narrow limits. For example, with a 75-25 division of national income between labor and capital, a 20 per cent increase in the ratio of the price of labor to the price of capital would not cause the labor share to stray more than 3 or 4 percentage points from 75 were the elasticity of substitution as low as .25 or as high as 2.  \n\nIn the historical event, the quantity and price ratios did move in opposite directions thus tending to limit the extent of the change in relative shares. Our data for the terminal periods, using reproducible capital for both decades and replacement-cost figures for 1949-57, are as follows:  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>QK/QL</td><td>Pk/PL</td><td>R/W</td></tr><tr><td>1900-09</td><td>1.26</td><td>.309</td><td>.39</td></tr><tr><td>1949-57</td><td>2.60</td><td>.092</td><td>.24</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThe doubling of the quantity ratio and the drastic decline of the price ratio imply an “historical’ elasticity of substitution of .64, but the  \n\n2Once $\\scriptstyle R/W$ is known, the property share in income, $R/Y$ can be calculated since the sum of the wage and property shares must equal 1:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{w+r=1,\\mathrm{~where~}w=W/Y\\mathrm{~and~}r=R/Y}\\ &{(r\\div R/W)+r=1}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe property share can be found by substituting the numerical value of $R/W$ and solving for $\\boldsymbol{r}$  \n\nmechanism underlying these changes is far from clear.  \n\nA hypothesis consistent with the facts is that the behavior of the price and quantity ratios is attributable to the differences in the supply conditions under which capital and labor are provided, and that the demand conditions were permissive rather than determining. This can be brought out by making a series of alternative assumptions about the relative impact of economic growth upon the demands for capital and labor specifically, and determining what supply conditions for the two factors could have produced the historical changes in their price and quantity ratios that have been observed.  \n\nLet us first assume that the expansion in demand was neutral in the sense that the relative marginal productivities were unchanged for any given ratio of capital to labor. (Geometrically, the isoquant drawn with capital on the vertical and labor on the horizontal axis merely shifts upward and to the right; its slope is unchanged at the point of intersection with any given gradient drawn from the origin indicating the capital-labor ratio.) If both capital and labor were perfectly elastic in supply, there would be proportionate increases in both and no change in relative prices or shares in income would occur. If one were more elastic in supply than the other, the relative quantity of the more elastic factor would increase, and given imperfect substitutability between the factors, its relative price would fall. In the actual event, capital nearly tripled in quantity with no secular increase in rate of return,2 while the number of man-hours rose by less than 50 per cent despite a better than threefold rise in hourly compensation. Thus if technical progress was neutral, the facts would fit the hypothesis.  \n\nNext consider the case in which economic growth is not neutral but increases the demand for capital relative to labor: For any given capitallabor ratio, the marginal productivity of capital has improved relative to that of labor. In Hicks’ terminology, technical progress is laborsaving [9, pp. 121-22]. (The higher isoquant has a smaller slope than the lower one at the points of intersection with any given gradient from the origin.) But we are immediately confronted with the problem of explaining why the return on capital did not rise relatively to that of labor. As in the previous case, the answer appears to turn upon the supply conditions; additional supplies of capital were readily forthcoming, while the supply of labor was so inelastic that even the smaller increase in the demand for it resulted in large price increases.  \n\nFinally, there is the case in which innovations raise the marginal productivity of labor in relation to that of capital, Hicks’ capital-saving category. If the supplies of both factors were perfectly elastic, there would be an increase in the relative quantity of labor. If, at the other extreme, the supplies of both factors were perfectly inelastic, the relative quantities would remain the same and the relative price of labor would rise. The only circumstances that would produce a decrease in the relative quantity of labor as well as an increase in its relative price, such as occurred in the history of the period, are those in which the supply of capital was more readily responsive to increased demand than was the supply of labor.  \n\nWhatever the nature of the demand influences, therefore, the increase in the capital-labor ratio and the relative increase in the price of labor are attributable to differences in supply conditions. However, we have explained only the direction of the movements of the quantity and price ratios; to account for the rise in the labor share, we have to explain why labor increased in relative price more than it decreased in relative quantity. The answer to this question depends not only upon the difference in the supply elasticities but also upon the marginal rate of substitution between capital and labor (MRS). If the MRS were constant from one equilibrium position to another, there could be no change in relative prices; only relative quantities would change. The fact that relative prices changed so much indicates not only that there was a great difference in the elasticities of supply, but also that the substitutability of capital for labor diminished. Nevertheless, the impetus to the change came from the supply conditions for the factors, for otherwise with neutral innovations there would have been no change in the MRS and with labor-saving innovations the change in the MRS would have been in the opposite from the observed direction. Only in the less likely case of capital-saving inventions would the MRS move in the right direction without aid from the supply side, and even in this case we have to invoke the supply conditions to explain the quantity changes.  \n\nWe have thus far glided over the dificulties encountered in deriving supply and demand curves from historical data. Not the least of these is the familiar problem of distinguishing the supply from the demand effects in historical statistics. If we could assume that the supply schedule for labor had remained constant over the entire half century and that the observed prices and quantities reflect the upward shift of the demand for labor, the arc elasticity of supply of man-hours could be easily calculated as .31. If the supply also shifted upward though not as much as did the demand, the elasticity may well have been less than .31; if the number of man-hours offered at each real hourly wage actually tended to diminish, the elasticity would have been greater than .31.  \n\nIn any case, the tripling of real earnings per man-hour with an increase in man-hours worked of only 40 per cent is consistent with the hypothesis of inelastic supply or with the related hypothesis that the growth in demand was greater than the growth in supply.  \n\nMatters are much less clear-cut with respect to capital. Even if we assume that the actual rate of return represents a good stand-in for the expected rate of return, the rate which presumably governs the supply of capital, it is difficult to draw any generalizations (see Table 11).  \n\nTABLE 11--REPRODUCIBLE TANGIBLE ASSETS  \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td rowspan=\"2\">Total Stock ($ bil)</td><td colspan=\"2\">Increase over PrecedingPeriod</td><td rowspan=\"2\">Price of Capital (percent)</td></tr><tr><td>$Bil</td><td>Per Cent</td></tr><tr><td>1900-09</td><td>125.2</td><td></td><td></td><td>8.80</td></tr><tr><td>1905-14</td><td>149.3</td><td>24.1</td><td>19.3</td><td>8.54</td></tr><tr><td>1910-19</td><td>174.2</td><td>24.9</td><td>17.4</td><td>9.54</td></tr><tr><td>1915-24</td><td>199.5</td><td>25.3</td><td>14.4</td><td>8.82</td></tr><tr><td>1920-29</td><td>234.8</td><td>35.3</td><td>20.6</td><td>8.71</td></tr><tr><td>1925-34</td><td>263.6</td><td>28.8</td><td>12.3</td><td>6.72</td></tr><tr><td>1930-39</td><td>268.3</td><td>4.7</td><td>1.8</td><td>5.64</td></tr><tr><td>1929-38</td><td>268.4</td><td></td><td></td><td>5.56( 5.73)</td></tr><tr><td>1934-43</td><td>275.5</td><td>7.1</td><td>2.6</td><td>7.44 (7.80)</td></tr><tr><td>1939-48</td><td>293.7</td><td>18.2</td><td>6.6</td><td>9.21 (10.07)</td></tr><tr><td>1944-53</td><td>325.6</td><td>31.9</td><td>10.9</td><td>8.99 (10.40)</td></tr><tr><td>1949-57</td><td>364.9</td><td>39.3</td><td>12.1</td><td>8.86 (10.67)</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nSources: Tablcs 9 and 10. Bracketed figures refer to cost depreciation.  \n\nThe periods spanning the years of the great depression have lower rates of return and smaller increments in the stock of capital than the more prosperous periods before and after. In the more prosperous periods, however, there is little association between changes in the rate of capital formation and changes in the actual rate of return from one overlapping decade to another. Perhaps the actual rate of return is a poor proxy for the expected rate, particularly since capital gains, which are excluded from the actual rate of return, may at certain times have been a more important motive to capital formation than was income in the sense used in the national accounts. Also, the rate of return which is relevant to new investment is the marginal rather than the average rate which is shown. Finally, and this is an important limitation for labor as well as capital, price might be a relatively minor influence in determining changes in available quantities.  \n\nWhatever the reason, then, under conditions of rapid expansion in production labor was relatively inelastic in supply and rising rapidly in price and capital was apparently either much more elastic or at any rate rapidly growing in supply. Thus entrepreneurs substituted capital for labor, or to put it more precisely, they increased their use of capital at a more rapid rate than their use of labor. It is not clear in what degree the relatively expanded use of capital was possible by virtue of existing techniques--owing either to the adaptability of equipment in use or to the availability of stand-by techniques requiring more capital and less labor-—-or in what degree it was the result of newly created capital-using techniques the development of which was stimulated by the growing relative scarcity and high price of labor. If the common conception of the rate of application of new knowledge to industrial processes has any validity innovations must have played a major role in the change in the ratio.  \n\nA slightly different view of the same phenomena can be obtained by decomposing the elements in equation (1) so as to express the propertylabor income shares as the product of (a) output per man-hour, (b) the capital-output ratio, and (c) the ratio of the price of capital to the price oflabor:  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{R}{W}}={\\frac{Y}{Q_{L}}}\\times{\\frac{Q_{K}}{Y}}\\times{\\frac{P_{K}}{P_{L}}}.\n$$  \n\nOne of our new terms $(Y/Q_{L})$ is a measure of the average productivity of labor and the other $(Q_{K}/Y)$ , the capital-output ratio, is the reciprocal of the average productivity of capital. The capital-output ratio rose in the depressed 'thirties when capacity was not fully utilized, declined in the booming 'forties when capacity was used to the hilt, and during the 'fifties remained at a level corresponding to about 70 per cent of the 1900-09 level; in terms of capital productivity this amounts to an increase of less than 45 per cent between the opening and closing decades of our period. Labor productivity, on the other hand, doubled within the same time span. This relative economizing in the use of labor may seem to imply that innovations during the period must have been labor-saving, but the economizing may flow merely from a shift in factor proportions; the average productivity of labor necessarily rises relative to that of capital whenever the quantity of labor falls relative to that of capital,27 whether the change in relative quantities is or is not due to changes in techniques. The presumption in favor of the hypothesis that adoption of labor-saving techniques accompanied the growth in capital relative to labor is supported by the further presumption that a rapidly rising relative wage rate created an inducement for innovations biased in this direction.28  \n\n$$\n\\frac{Y}{Q_{L}}\\div\\frac{Y}{Q_{k}}=\\frac{Q_{k}}{Q_{L}}.\n$$  \n\n2 Probably the most common view is that inventions have been labor-saving. See Hicks  \n\nOur discussion thus leads to the view that the impetus to the rise in the labor share came from sharp increases in real wages owing to the lack of responsiveness in the supply of man-hours to the rising demand for labor attendant upon rapid economic growth. The use of relatively more capital was made possible by price-induced substitution and by price-induced capital-using (labor-saving) innovations. We may infer that the substitutions encouraged by the relative cheapening of capital were not confined to the combinations of factors used to produce given products, but extended to the alteration of the structure of consumption in favor of capital-intensive products to the disadvantage of laborintensive goods.  \n\n#### IHI. Additional Parts of the Puzzle  \n\nThree other elements that will have to be taken into account when a complete theory of factor shares is developed are (1) price level changes, (2) changes in the degree of monopoly, and (3) other shifts in microeconomic relationships.  \n\n1. For rising prices to bring about a reduction in the property share, their adverse effect upon contractual property incomes (rent and interest) must outweigh their positive effect upon residual property incomes (profits). This differential effect of rising prices upon rent and profit may explain much of the fall in rent and rise in profits that concerned us in an earlier section of this paper.  \n\n2. The assumption of a significant and growing degree of monopoly was used by Kalecki as the basis for a theory of relative shares which has been criticized elsewhere.?? In a firm enjoying a sheltered market position, both wage and nonwage incomes may be higher than under competitive conditions, but the nonwage incomes are apt to be more above the competitive level than the wage incomes since the firm is presumably hiring labor under market conditions that are more competitive than those under which it is selling its product. Therefore, the share of labor will vary inversely with the degree of monopoly exercised by firms, and if monopoly has had anything to do with the rise in the labor share monopoly must have become less pervasive. Or, if the degree of monopoly in product markets has remained unchanged or even increased somewhat, perhaps the rising role of unions has provided an offsetting source of monopoly power that has pushed the wage share up. However, there is no agreement among labor economists that unions have in fact succeeded in raising labor's share [22, pp. 184-85].  \n\n3. Explanations of changes in relative shares have been sought also in microeconomic labor-capital relationships that are not necessarily related to the degree of monopoly. Several writers have, for example, analyzed the effects upon relative shares of changes in the importance of different sectors of the economy. Kuznets [19, pp. 241-50], Denison [4] and Johnson [11], working with different periods during the past half century, have produced results that indicate that changes in the industrial composition of employment and income have tended somewhat to increase the share of labor. Johnson, dealing with the entire 50-year period, stressed the favorable effect on the labor share of the relative expansion of the labor-intensive industries such as trade and services at the expense of capital-intensive agriculture. Denison, studying the period between 1929 and 1950, found that the small increase in the employee share in income produced by the business sector was due to changes in industrial composition which were sufficiently great to offset intra-industry decreases in labor shares.  \n\nThese investigations did not stress the possibility of systematic relationhips between changes in wages in particular sectors of the economy on the one hand, and changes in the relative importance of the sectors in national output on the other hand—-relationships which might, if they existed, have significant effects upon the wage share in the economy as a whole. This possibility was recently considered by R. M. Solow in a suggestive but preliminary survey of the connections between sector and over-all wage shares [24]. Solow called attention to the possible operation of what might be termed a microeconomic share-stabilizing mechanism. This would exist if there were a tendency for industries with rising labor shares to diminish in relative importance in originating national income and for those with falling labor shares to increase in relative importance. However, Solow's findings concerning the existence of such a mechanism were generally negative, as were the results of our own limited experiment along similar lines. On the other hand, the data are not without some traces of a tendency for shifts in the relative importance of sectors to be in the opposite direction from changes in the wage shares of the corresponding sectors.?1 A more thorough study based on cyclically adjusted data is necessary before the negative evidence found thus far is confirmed.  \n\nSome of the changes which we have been discussing as though they  \n\ns0 We compared changes in shares in national income between 1929 and 1956 for 55 private industries included in Commerce Department national accounts data with changes in the wage share in income originating in each industry.  \n\n81 For example, if we examine data for the 7 sectors used by Solow in his Table 1 for the extreme years in his tabulation,1929 and 1953,we find that in 5 out of the 7 cases the sector's share in national income moved in the opposite direction from the wage share in the income originating in the sector.  \n\ncharacterized the half century as a whole actually occurred within a briefer span of years within the period. For example, the rise in capitallabor ratios is mainly a pre-1929 phenomenon, rather than one continuously operative throughout the whole period, and it must be remembered that all the ratios involving capital are affected by the underutilization of capacity during the depressed 'thirties and by the high rates of utilization in the prosperous 'forties and 'fifties. If we tried to revise our speculations to take account of these differences in time, our task would be greatly complicated by the necessity for choosing among alternative hypotheses regarding leads and lags, and it is doubtful that we have sufficiently reliable data for a long enough period to make this exerciseworthwhile.  \n\nThere is, however, one further point to which reference might be made as long as our speculative license has carried us this far. It is to the possibly important pieces of the share puzzle that lie within realms of the social mechanism other than the purely economic. Some of these are obvious and tangible like the dependence of changes in the size of the labor force upon the rate of population growth and labor force participation rates. Others, perhaps equally important, are much more diffcult to establish. One source of the factors favoring the labor share may conceivably be found in the relative efects upon the supply prices of labor and capital of our society's quest for social justice and emphasis upon egalitarianism; perhaps the social setting has tended to prepare rentiers for euthanasia and to lead workers into a revolution of rising expectations.  \n\n## REFERENCES  \n\n1.

    "reference_markdown": "# Measuring Labor's Share  \n\nBy ALAN B. KRUEGER \\*  \n\nLabor's share of national income has been a topic of enduring interest to economists since the work of David Ricardo (1821） and other classical economists.Both neoclassical and Marxian theories of income distribution focus on labor's share. And the empirical determination of factor shares was the proximate cause for the founding of the National Bureau of Economic Research (Nahum Stone, 1945). This paper considers issues that arise in measuring the fraction of national income accruing to labor and provides alternative concepts and data to the standard Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) series.  \n\n## 1. Conceptual Issues  \n\nAn understanding of the analytical and practical uses of labor's share is necessary to assess the reliability of the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA). Data on factor shares are mainly used to: (i) describe the functional distribution of income and test models of income distribution (e.g., Anthony Atkinson, 1983); (ii) indirectly estimate parameters of an aggregate production function (e.g., Douglas Gollin, 1998); (ii） infer the division of rents between workers and firms (e.g., Olivier Blanchard, 1997); and (iv) forecast tax revenues.  \n\nSuperficially, labor's share is straightforward to measure: divide total compensation of workers by national income. But this recipe glosses over several tricky issues. In particular, who is a worker? Should CEO's and business owners be included? What is included in compensation? Should the corporate officers' stock options count as labor earnings? Is the return to investment in human capital counted as labor or capital income? How should retired workers who receive continuing healthinsurance coverage be treated? The answers to these questions differ depending on the intended use of factor shares. For example, to predict tax revenue CBO may want corporate officers’ compensation included in labor income, while to assess the division of rents between workers and firms economists would probably prefer to exclude the compensation of corporate officers from labor income.  \n\nIn practice, the BEA is often guided more by administrative convenience and necessity than by economic rationale in measuring factor incomes. The main source of income data in the national accounts is employer-reported payroll data from the state Unemployment Insurance payroll systems, called ES-202 data. The ES-202 data typically define wage and salary broadly, including cash compensation, the realized value of stock options, and the value of taxable fringe benefits (such as the personal use of a company car). Employees are also defined broadly: anyone who draws a salary from a business is counted as an employee, from the owner of a corporation down to the janitor.  \n\nMany authors have noted that it is unclear how the income of proprietors (i.e., owners of unincorporated businesses) should be categorized in the labor-capital dichotomy, because some of the income earned by self-employed workers clearly represents labor income, while some represents a return on investment or economic profit. D. Gale Johnson (1954), Irving Kravis (1959), Joseph Phillips (1960), and others investigate the influence of the momentous shift of proprietors (especially family farmers） to wage employment in the United States and find that much of the increase in labor's share in the first half of the 20th century can be attributed to this structural shift. A common convention since Johnson (1954) has been to allocate two-thirds of the income of proprietors to labor earnings, and one-third to capital income.  \n\nMore generally, one could argue that the national accounts rely on arbitrary legal definitions to classify income of business owners. If two doctors are partners in an unincorporated medical practice, for example, their income is counted as proprietors’ income, but if the same doctors incorporate their business and draw a salary from their corporation (which is likely, given the tax advantages), their income would be counted as employee compensation. Using Current Population Survey (CPS） data, one finds that the ratio of incorporated to unincorporated self-employed workers and business owners increased from 0.28 in 1979 to 0.41 in 1997. The effect on labor's share of the relative increase in incorporations has not been investigated.  \n\nThe practices used to construct the national accounts have implications for labor's share. Because corporate officers control the firm's capital and in many cases include the owners of the firm, one could argue that much of their compensation should be classified as capital income. Attributing the income of many business owners to labor income contributes to the stability of labor's share. To take an example, if the owner of the Chicago Bulls, Jerry Reinsdorf, were to pay Michael Jordan an additional $\\$20$ million, and reduce his own salary by an equivalent amount, labor's share would be unchanged because both are counted as employees of the Bulls. Certainly, one could argue that the ‘function'’ of the corporate officers is different than the function of the other employees. A problem inherently arises because income is forced into two artificial categories, labor and nonlabor income. But there are many types of labor. Below, a method is proposed for estimating raw labor's share of national income.  \n\nAnother issue concerns payments to retired workers, such as retiree health benefits. The accounting concept used by BEA to calculate national income is accruals for wage and salary income and disbursements for other labor income. Although there may be some advantages of counting employers’ nonwage contributions when they occur, as opposed to when they are promised or earned, there are also disadvantages. For retiree benefits the difference between the time when money is earned and disbursed can be substantial. In 1994, 34 percent of retired workers received employerprovided health insurance (U.s. Department of Labor, 1995). The cost of providing retiree health benefits equalled 1 percent of total payroll in 1990, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute (1992 table 2.8). Employer contributions to pensions are also counted in the national accounts when they are made, which could present problems for under- or overfunded defined benefit plans. Other wage series do not count retiree compensation as current income. Retiree benefits are likely to have a more important effect on the national accounts in the future, as the number of retirees relative to active workers is predicted to increase from 0.22 to 0.37 between 1995 and 2030 according to unpublished calculations of the Office of the Actuary, Social Security Administration (see Virginia Reno and Kathryn Olson, 1998).  \n\n![](images/534943708cc107dc62117b7e9bc258d53d3e3c2f28a5c7e6eb836e1b2be7cfb2.jpg)  \nFIGURE 1. LABOR'S SHARE OF NATIONAL INCOME, NIPA DATA,1948-1998  \n\n## II. Basic NIPA Data  \n\nFigure 1 displays various measures of labor's share of national income in the post  \n\nWorld War II period using NIPA data. The top two lines (i.e., the solid and dashed lines) adopt the convention of adding two-thirds of proprietor's income to labor income; they measure labor compensation by wages and salary, employer contributions for social insurance, and other labor income. The difference between these two measures of labor's share is that the dashed line pertains to domestic income, and the solid line pertains to all sources of national income. Because labor's share of domestic and national income shows similar patterns in the two measures, I concentrate on the more common national-income concept. The line denoted by squares ascribes none of proprietor's income to labor income. Finally, the line denoted by triangles depicts total wage and salary income as a fraction of national income.  \n\nSeveral well-known stylized facts are evident in Figure 1. First, labor's share of national income increased gradually from the end of World War II until the early 1970's. Second, the postwar increase in labor's share is sharper when none of proprietor's income is credited to labor income. Third, employer contributions for social insurance and fringe benefits increased more rapidly than wage and salary income in the three decades after World War II; since the early 1980's wage and nonwage benefits increased at about equal rates. The run-up in nonwage compensation was due in roughly equal measure to required social-insurance contributions and voluntary fringe benefits. Because labor probably bears the incidence of these payments, I have a preference for using the broader-gauged total compensation to measure labor's share. Henceforth, I shall refer to total labor compensation plus two-thirds of proprietors’ income relative to national income as labor's share. Fourth, labor's share tends to move countercyclically. The correlation between labor's share and the adult male unemployment rate is 0.34. Over the entire postwar period, labor's share has fuctuated between 75 percent and 80 percent of national income. Fifth, labor's share declined by almost 3 percentage points since reaching a plateau in the mid1970's. The 2-point drop in labor's share since 1992 is in line with past relations between the unemployment rate and labor's share (see James Poterba, 1997).  \n\n### III. Alternative Wage and Fringe Benefit Series  \n\nThe divergent trends in the various wage series documented by Katharine Abraham et al. (1999) is a cause of concern for measuring labor's share because the hourly wage series derived from the NIPA data shows significantly faster growth than all other available series. Moreover, Abraham et al. find that half of the divergence between earnings from the CPS and NIPA data between 1973 and 1997 is due to differential hours growth, and half is due to differential growth in total payroll. If NIPA data overstate the growth in payroll, then labor's share is overstated as well.  \n\nTable 1 provides additional evidence by comparing trends in NIPA compensation data and data derived from the Bureau of Labor Statistic's Employment Cost Index (ECI) survey. The ECI is estimated from a quarterly survey of 23,000 jobs within 4,400 private-sector firms. Although the ECI is a fixed-payrollweighted compensation index, average Employer Costs for Employee Compensation (ECEC) data are calculated each year from the underlying ECI data using current employment weights. Anthony Barkume and Michael Lettau （1998） calculated an experimental ECEC wage series using current hours as weights. In principle, these data represent wage and salary per hour. Michael Lettau provided me with the underlying data series for total compensation per hour worked derived from the ECI data. In terms of breadth of compensation covered, this is probably the best alternative series to compare to the NIPA compensation-per-hour series. Both measures are calculated as compensation per hour (as opposed to the average wage for an employee or job). One possibly important difference between the two series, however, is that the ECI data exclude jobs in which employees have a significant role in setting their own wages. Additionally, the ECI data exclude compensation paid to retired workers.  \n\nThe first column of Table 1 reports annual averages of unpublished quarterly data on compensation per hour derived from the ECI survey. The second column reports the annual average of BLS's estimate of compensation per hour based on the NIPA data. Both series have been converted to real dollars using the  \n\nTABLE 1—ALTERNATIVE MEASURES OF COMPENSATIONANDLABOR'SSHARE  \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Year</td><td>(i) Real compensation per hour (ECI data)</td><td>(i) Real compensation per hour (NIPA data)</td><td>(ii) ECI payroll relative to ES-202 payroll</td></tr><tr><td>1988</td><td>100.0</td><td>100.0</td><td>0.965</td></tr><tr><td>1989</td><td>99.3</td><td>98.0</td><td>0.966</td></tr><tr><td>1990</td><td>98.1</td><td>98.1</td><td>0.954</td></tr><tr><td>1991</td><td>97.5</td><td>98.7</td><td>0.942</td></tr><tr><td>1992</td><td>97.8</td><td>100.7</td><td>0.931</td></tr><tr><td>1993</td><td>98.8</td><td>100.0</td><td>0.931</td></tr><tr><td>1994</td><td>97.8</td><td>99.4</td><td>0.911</td></tr><tr><td>1995</td><td>96.3</td><td>99.0</td><td>0.879</td></tr><tr><td>1996</td><td>96.7</td><td>99.5</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>1997</td><td>96.7</td><td>100.8</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>1998</td><td>97.5</td><td>102.9</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>(iv) NIPA labor's share</td><td>Adjusted labor's share (numerator and denominator)</td><td>Adjusted labor's share (numerator only)</td></tr><tr><td>1988</td><td>0.771</td><td>0.767</td><td>0.751</td></tr><tr><td>1989</td><td>0.771</td><td>0.766</td><td>0.751</td></tr><tr><td>1990</td><td>0.774</td><td>0.768</td><td>0.747</td></tr><tr><td>1991</td><td>0.779</td><td>0.771</td><td>0.744</td></tr><tr><td>1992</td><td>0.787</td><td>0.778</td><td>0.746</td></tr><tr><td>1993</td><td>0.781</td><td>0.772</td><td>0.741</td></tr><tr><td>1994</td><td>0.774</td><td>0.761</td><td>0.722</td></tr><tr><td>1995</td><td>0.765</td><td>0.748</td><td>0.695</td></tr><tr><td>1996</td><td>0.761</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>1997</td><td>0.761</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>1998</td><td>0.766</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNotes: Data in column (i) are compensation per hour worked for nonfarm private-sector employees derived from theECI dataasdescribed byBarkume and Lettau (1998).Data in column (ii) are BLS's estimates of compensation per hour for the nonfarm business sector, based on NIPA compensation data. Columns (i) and (ii) are deflated by the CPI-U,and indexed so that 1988 equals 100. Data for 1998 are averages for the first half of the year. Data in column (i) are total wage and salary as calculated from the underlying ECI data relative to total wage and salary from the ES-202 data for comparable two-digit industries. These data are theinverse of theentriesincolumn3of table 2 of Barkume and Lettau (1997). Data in column (iv) are NIPA wage and salary plus supplements plus twothirds proprietor's income, all divided by national income. Data in column (v) were derived by multiplying the NIPA total wage and salary data by the factor in column (iii) and recomputing the numerator and denominator (national income) of labor's share.Data in column (vi) were derived by adjusting wage and salary income by the factor in column (ii) only for the numerator of labor's share.  \n\nCPI-U and normalized so that 1988 equals 100. Compensation per hour grew about 5- percent faster in the NIPA than in ECI data over the last decade.2  \n\nIn related work, Barkume and Lettau (1997） compare total ES-202 wage and salary data (which are used in the national accounts) to total wage and salary data derived from the ECI survey for a subset of two-digit industries with over 98-percent overlap in employment coverage. These industries represent about 80 percent of private nonfarm employment. Their estimated ratio of total ECI payroll to ES-202 payroll is reported in column (ii） of Table 1. The ECI data picked up 97 percent of the ES-202 payroll in 1988, but only 88 percent in 1995. These results suggest that either the NIPA wage and salary data have grown too quickly in the 1990's or aggregate wage and salary data derived from the ECI have grown too slowly. It is unclear which series more accurately reflects the true trend in payroll, but it is worth noting that NIPA wage and salary data grew 4-percent faster than the Internal Revenue Service's payroll figures between 1984 and 1996 (see Thae Park, 1998).  \n\nReasons for the discrepancy between the NIPA compensation series and other sources need to be explored further. Here I illustrate possible implications of using ECI data to calculate labor's share. At one extreme, suppose that the NIPA wage and salary data have grown too rapidly because ES-202 data increasingly double-count some fringe benefits as wage and salary income. In this case, labor income and national income have grown too rapidly. In column (v） I use Barkume and Lettau's （1997） ratios to reduce both labor compensation and national income accordingly. Labor's share is seen to fall by 1.9 percentage points between 1988 and 1995, only slightly faster than the 0.6-percentage-point fall in the unadjusted data [see column (iv)]. Now suppose that the ECI and NIPA data diverged because the NIPA data include some business owners’ income in labor compensation. In this case, only the numerator of labor's share should be adjusted. Labor's share is recalculated under this assumption in column (vi), and the results indicate a substantial 5.6- point fall in labor's share since 1988. It is apparent that the trend in labor's share depends critically on whether any possible error in total labor compensation carries over to national income as well.  \n\n### IV. Raw Labor's Share  \n\nThe share of national income earned by workers is affected by the amount of human capital workers possess. If labor's share is used to infer something about parameters of an aggregate production function, it is probably desirable to adjust labor compensation for human-capital accumulation. To derive a rough approximation of ‘‘raw'’ labor's share, assume that each worker's earnings consist of two additive components: raw labor and human capital (see David Card and Thomas Lemieux [1996] for evidence on the ‘‘single index'’ model). To estimate the wage of raw labor, the following Mincerian earnings regression was estimated:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{\\ln W_{i}=b_{0}+b_{1}S_{i}+b_{2}X_{i}}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{+b_{3}X_{i}^{2}+e_{i}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere In $W_{i}$ is the natural log of worker i's annual earnings, $S_{i}$ equals years of schooling, $X_{i}$ is potential experience (age minus education minus 6), $\\Bar{X}_{i}^{2}$ is potential experience squared, and $e_{i}$ is an equation error. The average value of each worker's earnings attributable to‘‘raw'’ labor, denoted $W_{0}$ ,is approximated by $W_{0}=\\exp(b_{0}+0.5\\sigma^{2})$ ， where $\\sigma^{2}$ is the mean square error of the regression. (Raw labor might more appropriately be called ‘‘intercept labor.''） The share of wages accruing to raw labor is approximated by $R=\\Sigma W_{0}/\\Sigma W_{i}$ . Equation（1） was estimated by ordinary least squares using the  \n\nTABLE 2—DIVIDING NATIONAL INCOME INTO RAW LABOR AND HUMAN CAPITAL   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Year</td><td>(i) Proportion of payroll due to rawlabor</td><td>(ii) Raw labor (billions of 1996 dollars)</td><td>(iii) Human capital (billions of 1996 dollars)</td><td>(iv) Rawlabor's share of national income</td></tr><tr><td>1939</td><td>0.125</td><td>79.0</td><td>553.1</td><td>0.096</td></tr><tr><td>1959</td><td>0.171</td><td>291.1</td><td>1411.1</td><td>0.130</td></tr><tr><td>1969</td><td>0.155</td><td>418.2</td><td>2279.9</td><td>0.121</td></tr><tr><td>1979</td><td>0.156</td><td>548.4</td><td>2966.9</td><td>0.122</td></tr><tr><td>1989</td><td>0.088</td><td>377.5</td><td>3911.9</td><td>0.068</td></tr><tr><td>1996</td><td>0.064</td><td>304.7</td><td>4456.1</td><td>0.049</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNotes:Datafor1996areestimatedfrom theMarch1997CPS.All other years are from the decennial Censuses. See text for an explanation of the derivation of the proportion of payroll due to raw labor. I assume that nonwage compensation is divided between raw labor and human capital in the same ratio as earnings. Two-thirds of proprietors’ income is assigned to labor income. The CPI-U was used to adjust nominal dollars. Standard errors for the estimates in column (i) are 0.001 or less.  \n\n1940, 1960, 1980, and 1990 Censuses, and the March 1997 CPS.  \n\nSeveral caveats should be noted. First, the wage of raw labor is affected by institutional arrangements in the economy. For example, the minimum wage probably raises the intercept of the earnings equation. Second, pay above the raw-labor level is also influenced by institutional factors. If unionized workers capture some product-market rents, it is misleading to  call $1-R$ human capital's share of payroll, as is done below. Third, the linear skill formulation may be a poor approximation; for example, raw labor may be of less value to those with a high level of education. Fourth, earnings are top-coded in Census and CPS data, and the top code varies over time. If one uses total wage and salary based on NIPA data to calculate the denominator of $R$ ,however, the estimates are qualitatively similar. Fifth, the 1990 Census and 1997 CPS record education within intervals; I assign mean years of schooling based on David Jaeger （1997） to each education interval in these years. In light of these caveats,the estimates in Table 2 should be viewed as illustrative.  \n\nThe results in the first column of Table 2 suggest that raw labor's share of wage and salary income increased between 1939 and 1959, remained fairly stable between 1959 and 1979, and then fell in the 1980's and 1990's. Column (ii) reports the implied total value of raw labor in the U.S. economy.? In 1996, raw labor earned an estimated $\\$300$ billion in total compensation, with the residual human-capital compensation equal to nearly $\\$4.5$ trillion.4 Finally, column (iv) reports raw labor's share of national income. Raw labor's share of national income declined since 1979, which is not surprising in view of the well-documented rise in the return to education and experience in this period. A qualitatively similar picture emerges if, instead of equation (1), one estimates a specification that assumes years of education have no effect on earnings below the second percentile of the education distribution, and then have a log-linear effect (as in Card and Krueger [1992]).  \n\n## V. Conclusion  \n\nThe presumed constancy of labor's share has been considered ‘‘a bit of a miracle'’ by John M. Keynes (1939 p. 48) and a “mirage by Robert Solow (1958 p. 619).Unfortunately, confidence in the recent trend in labor's share is hampered by measurement problems. Moreover, with the rise of employee stock ownership and pension funds, and the increase in compensation for top executives, labor and capital no longer divide so neatly into mutually exclusive categories. These considerations suggest that there would be value from improving the measurement of labor's share, and from devising alternative categories for functional shares. The increase in the number and variety of available wage sources in recent decades should facilitate this endeavor.  \n\n# REFERENCES  \n\nAbraham, Katharine; Spletzer, James and Stewart, Jay. ‘\"Why Do Wage Series Tell  \n\nDifferent Stories?'

    "reference_markdown": "# The End of Cheap Chinese Labor  \n\nHongbin Li, Lei Li, Binzhen Wu, and Yanyan Xiong  \n\nn recent decades, cheap labor has played a central role in the Chinese model, which has relied on expanded participation in world trade as a main driver of growth (Lin, Cai, and Li 2003; Bernstein 2004). At the beginning of China's economic reforms in 1978, the annual wage of a Chinese urban worker was only $\\$1,004$ in U.S. dollars: that is, 615 renminbi yuan divided by China's official exchange rate of 1.68 yuan/dollar in that year, and then deflated to the 2010 level by the U.S. GDP deflator. (The official exchange rate was overvalued at the time, but it is useful in measuring the price that U.S. consumers pay for Chinese labor embodied in Chinese goods.) Back in 1978, China's wage was only 3 percent of the average U.S. wage at that time, and it was also significantly lower than the wages in neighboring Asian countries such as the Philippines and Thailand. The Chinese wage was also low relative to productivity. According to Ceglowski and Golub (2007), China's “unit labor cost\"--wage as a percentage of labor productivity—-relative to the same ratio in the United States declined from over 70 percent in the 1980s to about 30 percent in the mid-1990s.  \n\nHowever, wages are now rising in China. In 2010, the annual wage of a Chinese urban worker reached $\\$5,487$ in U.S. dollars-that is, 37,147 yuan divided by the exchange rate of 6.77 yuan/dollar—which is similar to wages earned by workers in the Philippines and Thailand and significantly higher than those earned by workers in India and Indonesia. China's wages also increased faster than productivity since the late 1990s, suggesting that Chinese labor is becoming more expensive in this senseaswell.  \n\nThe opening section of this paper discusses China's rising wages in more detail. For example, the increase in China's wages is not confined to any sector, as wages have increased for both skilled and unskilled workers, for both coastal and inland areas, and for both exporting and nonexporting firms. We then benchmark wage growth to productivity growth using both national- and industry-level data, showing that Chinese labor was kept cheap until the late 1990s but the relative cost of labor has increased since then. Finally, we discuss the main forces that are pushing wages up. For example, the reforms in the late 1990s re-established a flexible labor market in China, enabling firms to pay workers according to productivity. China's labor force may have already reached its peak in 2011; and China's rural-to-urban migration will also slow down because the rural young are highly mobile; almost all rural youth in the 16-20 age bracket are already working off the farm (Rozelle, Huang, Zhang, and Li 2008). Therefore, future increases in migrant labor must come from those who are older or those who have established families, who will require the prospect of larger wage gains than migrants of the past if they are to find migration worthwhile.  \n\n## Rising Wages in China  \n\nChina's urban areas have a dual labor market: one for urban workers and the other for low-skilled migrant workers. Urban workers (both skilled and unskilled) have urban hukou (household registration), which means that they are registered with the government as living permanently in cities. Migrant workers have rural hukou, and they are very mobile in two aspects. First, they live temporarily in the places where they work during the year and return to their rural homes during the Chinese New Year holidays and the peak agricultural seasons (Wang and Zuo 1999). Although more migrant workers have chosen to stay in cities permanently in recent years, an average migrant worker spent 2.2 months in their rural homes and 9.8 months in off-farm work away from home in 2011 (2011 Survey of Off-farm Laborers by China's National Bureau of Statistics). Second, these workers often change their migration destinations and jobs. After the Chinese New Year holidays, which is a period of one to two months, they return to the cities to work, but they are highly likely to change jobs or migrate to a new city. They also change jobs and locations within a year, which makes tracking them in regular household surveys very difficult. With the difficulty of surveying this particular group, no large-scale survey data that cover all Chinese workers are available. However, China's National Bureau of Statistics does have good data for urban workers.  \n\n![](images/109a6d85cd449717421a19aed5d5d4cac44206cccd91e85249a87ecce5598158.jpg)  \nFigure1 Real Annual Wages of Chinese Urban Workers (deflated to 2010 prices)   \nSource:China StatisticalYearbooks. Note: PPI is producer price index.  \n\nIn the first two decades of the reform period from 1978 up to the later part of the 1990s, the growth of workers’ wages in Chinese urban areas was relatively low, as shown in Figure 1. According to the Statistical Yearbooks published by China's National Bureau of Statistics, the annual real wage of a Chinese urban worker increased only slightly from $\\$1,004$ in 1978 to $\\$1,026$ in 1997, at an average annual growth rate of only 0.1 percent (before tax, including pensions, and again converted from yuan to U.s. dollars using the current exchange rate, and to the 2010 level using the U.S. GDP deflator). This growth rate of China's urban wages is significantly lower than China's annual real growth rate of 4.0 percent (in real U.S. dollars) in these two decades.1  \n\nHowever, China's wage growth started to pick up steam in the late 1990s. In 1998, the real wage as measured in U.S. dollars grew by over 14.1 percent, marking the start of a new era of fast wage growth. In the period from 1998 to 2010, the average annual growth rate of real wages was 13.8 percent, exceeding the real GDP growth rate of 12.7 percent. The fast rise of China's urban wages since the late 1990s is due in part to institutional factors such as the privatization of state-owned enterprises in the mid-1990s, the re-establishment of the labor market, and the slowdown of labor force growth and migration, which we will discuss in detail below. As Figure 1 shows, the real wage in yuan grew faster than the real wage converted to dollars at the then-current yuan/dollar exchange rate because China's official exchange rate was overvalued before 1994.  \n\n![](images/52fb50daf27f5d71ff13828d90f2782605ac1a243ce0822853a3b4e30e256c6d.jpg)  \nFigure2 Annual Manufacturing Wages of Asian Emerging Economies (real U.S. dollars in 2010, deflated by the U.S. GDP deflator)   \nSource: International Labor Organization LABORSTA Database.  \n\nChina's wages have also increased compared with the wages of other developing economies. In Figure 2, we compare the manufacturing wages of a group of Asian developing countries. Note that China's manufacturing wage is lower than the overall wage in Figure 1. Among these countries, China had one of the lowest manufacturing wage rates in 1994 at $\\$694$ in U.S. dollars, or about 17 percent of the manufacturing wage in the Philippines. By 2008, the last year in which we have data for most of these countries, China's wages are second only to those of the Philippines, marking a wage gap of only 18 percent. The wages of two other populous Asian countries, India and Indonesia, are much lower at only about 41 and 34 percent of China's wages, respectively, in 2006, the last year in which data for India are available.  \n\nTo explore whether the rise of China's wages is confined to certain sectors, we use micro-level data from the Urban Household Survey, which covers all urban areas in China and uses probabilistic sampling and a stratified, multistage method to select households. To be included in the sample, a household must reside in a specific city for at least six months. Therefore, this sample does not include migrant workers who live in a city for less than six months or those who work off the farm in rural areas. The sampled households are asked to keep a detailed record of their incomes and expenditures every day. In the subsequent discussion, we will examine China's wages by exploring this dataset.2 The wages reported in this study are lower than the aggregate statistics reported in Figures 1 and 2 because firms report aggregate wages, including pensions and taxes.  \n\n![](images/0e3c3e638b5f2c9516539b02a88c5b83de295534d8083d3aa119fe1e9e53a331.jpg)  \nFigure3 Annual Wages of Urban Workers by Education Level (real U.S. dollars in 2010, deflated by the U.S.GDP deflator)   \nSource: The Urban Household Survey data in 9 provinces, 1988-2009. Notes: Education levels: “low” refers to junior high school and below,“medium” refers to academic/technical high school, and “high\" refers to college and above. \"Low-education beginners\" are low-education workers with working experience less than 5 years.  \n\nWages are increasing for China's workers at all skill levels. Figure 3 shows that growth rates of real wages for those with low education level (junior high school and below), medium education level (academic and technical high school), and high education level (college and above) are all increasing at high speeds--at 6.5, 7.6, and 9.0 percent per year, respectively. Fast wage growth rates even for unskilled workers suggest an overall rise in wages. To explore this phenomenon further, we examine the wages for low-education beginners, or low-education workers with less than five years of experience in the job market. Their wage growth was 7.8 percent per year in the 1988-2009 sample period and was actually higher at 9.8 percent annually from 1997 to 2o09, which is a faster increase than for urban workers as a whole.  \n\n![](images/d60e3b4b66e8785abf22803e5bd61ecb5a8233cf5f9cb4e97533e55f76afbad9.jpg)  \nFigure4 Annual Wages of Urban Workers by Region (real U.S. dollars in 2010, deflated by the U.S. GDP deflator)   \nSource: Wages by regions are from the Urban Household Survey data in nine provinces, 1988-2009.  \n\nWages are also rising in both the more-developed coastal regions and the less-developed inland regions despite the wage gap that exists between the two, as illustrated in Figure 4. The growth rate of wages in the inland regions was 7.7 percent per year from 1988 to 2009, which was one percentage point lower than the growth rate in the coastal regions. As a result, this regional wage gap increased to 54.6 percent in 2009. However, the inland regions have been catching up since 1997, with their annual wage growth rate being one percentage point higher than in coastal regions (10.9 versus 9.9 percent annually). Wages are also rising for both exporting and nonexporting firms. Interestingly, nonexporting firms have higher wages than exporting firms, similar to the findings of Lu (2010). However, the wage gap between these two types of firms is also declining over time.  \n\nThe Urban Household Survey does not include the most mobile migrant workers, who may be the lowest-paid workers in China. To examine this issue, we use some aggregate statistics of migrant wages released by the National Bureau of Statistics. The annual real wages of migrant workers, who tend to have a junior high school degree or lower education level, averaged $\\$2,541$ (in U.S. dollars) in 2009, is almost the same as the real wages of low-education workers in the Urban Household Survey sample in the same year $(\\$2,567)$ . The wages of the two samples corroborate each other, and their similarity suggests that the wages of low-skilled urban workers may track those of migrant workers. In terms of wage growth, the wages of migrant workers in the sample from the Rural Household Survey also increased at a high annual rate of 9.6 percent from 2003 to 2009. Furthermore, the wages of migrant workers increased even faster in the last two years, reaching $\\$3,535$ (in U.S. dollars) in 2011.  \n\n## Wages versus Productivity  \n\nAlthough China's wages have been rising fast, if their growth rate is lower than that of labor productivity, then labor is effectively becoming cheaper per unit of product. So, to answer whether China's fast wage growth since 1997 implies that Chinese labor is becoming more expensive, we need to compare wage growth to labor productivity growth. In doing so, we find that Chinese labor becomes cheaper before the late 1990s, but not since then.  \n\nWe calculate the growth of gross labor productivity by deducting the growth rate of the labor force from the growth rate of real GDP, drawing on data published in China's Statistical Yearbooks. In the period of 1982 (the first year in which we have data on labor force) to 1997, China's GDP (converted at the official exchange rate and deflated to real 2010 U.S. dollars) increased by 5.5 percent, and the labor force grew by 1.9 percent, implying labor productivity growth of 3.6 percent per year. This figure almost triples the real wage growth of 1.3 percent per year during that period, suggesting that Chinese labor was becoming cheaper relative to productivity during this period. Of course, this is a simple calculation that it does not adjust for changes in the quality and quantity of other inputs such as capital and the human capital of the labor force, but it is nonetheless revealing.  \n\nChinese labor also became cheaper relative to other countries over this time period. Ceglowski and Golub (2007) find that manufacturing “unit labor costs\" the ratio of wages to labor productivity--fell for China relative to that of the United States from over 70 percent in the early 1980s to about 30 percent in the mid-1990s. Moreover, the relative cost of Chinese labor at this time was not only lower than that of developed countries but was also lower than that of developing countries such as India, Malaysia, and Mexico. It appears that wage growth fell far behind productivity growth in China during this period.  \n\nHowever, China's wages have increased at a much faster rate than productivity since 1997. Using our aggregate data, we find that China's GDP in real U.S. dollars increased by 12.7 percent annually in the period from 1997 to 2010, whereas labor force growth decreased to only 1.4 percent, implying an annual growth rate of 11.3 percent for gross labor productivity. Although this rate is much faster than that of the productivity growth before 1997, it is lower than the astonishing annual real wage growth of 13.8 percent in the same period. Therefore, Chinese labor is indeed becoming more expensive.? According to Ceglowski and Golub (2007), China's relative unit labor cost was 63 percent that of Malaysia and 70 percent that of Korea by 2002. If the gap between wages and productivity in China continues to close by 2.5 percent per year, China's advantage of lower labor cost relative to Korea will be completely eliminated by the year 2018, and that relative to Malaysia will be goneby2022.  \n\nTable1 Characteristics of Selected Manufacturing Sectors in China   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Employment (million)</td><td>Export/ Salesratio</td><td>Capital/Labor ratio (1,000 US$)</td><td>Valueadded perworker (1,000 US$)</td><td colspan=\"2\">Wage/(value-added outputperworker)</td></tr><tr><td>Industry</td><td>2010 (1)</td><td>2010 (2)</td><td>2010 (3)</td><td>2010 (4)</td><td>2007 (5)</td><td>2010 (6)</td></tr><tr><td>Leather,fur, and other textiles</td><td>2.76</td><td>0.30</td><td>20.88</td><td>11.60</td><td>0.28</td><td>0.39</td></tr><tr><td>Wearing apparel</td><td>4.47</td><td>0.28</td><td>23.22</td><td>11.04</td><td>0.31</td><td>0.41</td></tr><tr><td>Instruments</td><td>1.25</td><td>0.33</td><td>61.14</td><td>18.63</td><td>0.35</td><td>0.25</td></tr><tr><td>Electronics</td><td>7.73</td><td>0.63</td><td>72.10</td><td>19.32</td><td>0.12</td><td>0.24</td></tr><tr><td>Electricalmachinery</td><td>6.04</td><td>0.19</td><td>77.53</td><td>23.01</td><td>0.22</td><td>0.20</td></tr><tr><td>Transport equipment</td><td>5.74</td><td>0.11</td><td>123.53</td><td>30.51</td><td>0.24</td><td>0.15</td></tr><tr><td>Basiciron and steel</td><td>3.46</td><td>0.03</td><td>196.51</td><td>55.13</td><td>0.20</td><td>0.08</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nSource: China Statistical Yearbook (various years). Notes: All values are in 2010 real U.S. dollars. Industry classification follows the GB/T4754 standard released by China's National Statistics Bureau. The 1997 data include all enterprises in the specific industry, while the 2010 data only include enterprises above a designated size in an industry.\"“Instruments\" refers to precision and optical instruments; “Electronics\" refers to radio, television, and communication equipment and apparatus; “Electrical machinery\" refers to electrical machinery and apparatus.  \n\nWe draw on recent industry-level data to examine the unit labor cost: in this case, our measurement is the average wage as a proportion of value added per worker. In particular, we select several two-digit industries as cases from China's Statistical Yearbooks. As shown in column 1 of Table 1, these industries are large in employment size: they employ more than 1 million workers each and 31 million workers in total in 2010. Most of them are also major exporters, with 29 percent of their sales as exports on average (column 2). To facilitate analysis, we sort these firms by the capital/labor ratio (column 3), which can be viewed as a measure of labor (or capital) intensity or as revealing the level of technology.  \n\nThese variables suggest several interesting associations. First, labor-intensive industries are major exporters with very high export/sales ratios, consistent with the fact that China uses its abundant labor for export industries. Among the seven industries, basic iron and steel has the lowest labor intensity, and its sales are mainly domestic. Second, there is a clear negative association between the capital/ labor ratio (column 3) and unit wage cost (column 6), which is defined as the ratio of wage to value added per worker, suggesting that labor-intensive industries have higher unit labor costs.  \n\nFinally, the last two columns suggest that labor-intensive industries experienced a sharp rise in unit labor costs. As an example, for the apparel industry, the unit labor cost increased from 0.31 in 1997 (column 5) to 0.41 in 2010 (column 6). The unit labor cost also increased in two other relatively low-tech industries: leather, fur, and other textiles; and electronics (which is mostly assembly). However, industries with higher capital/labor ratios like transport equipment and basic iron and steel experienced a decline in unit labor costs in the same period, suggesting that the labor cost advantage remains for the relatively high-tech industries.  \n\n## Potential Reasons for Rising Wages  \n\nThe discussion to this point has argued that China's real wage was more or less stagnant or stable in the 1980s and early 1990s, and grew substantially beginning in the late 1990s. In this section, we discuss three potential reasons for this change: institutional reforms, the disappearing “demographic dividend,” and the slowing of rural-urban migration.  \n\n### Institutional Reforms  \n\nChina has transformed its economy from a planned labor allocation system to a more market-oriented labor market. In the planned system, workers were allocated by the central planner to the state-owned enterprises, and jobs were permanent with little mobility (Fleisher and Wang 2004). The central planner set the wages of all workers in the country using a simple system of grades, with the grade mainly depending on seniority. Wages were set low, and so was the wage gap between grades. In this system, wages did not reflect productivity, and because of this and the misallocation of workers, productivity was low.  \n\nThe first major step in China's urban labor market reforms was to establish an internal pay incentive system within state-owned enterprises. Starting in the late 1980s, the financial insolvency of many state-owned enterprises prompted the Chinese government to undertake a series of reforms. The reforms started by allowing profitable firms to pay higher wages and even bonuses to the more productive workers, which increased the pay difference among workers (Park, Song, Zhang, and Zhao 2008). However, because private firms were still not allowed in these areas and job mobility was low, there was essentially no external labor market.  \n\n![](images/aae047ed39e501f2d09d601e3fc6855e53e9faadf30a2dc594966af78b49e491.jpg)  \nFigure5 Private Employment as a Proportion of Total Urban Employment   \nSource:China StatisticalYearbooks.  \n\nThe second step in urban labor market reforms was to establish an external labor market. The most aggressive enterprise reforms took place in the mid-to-late 1990s, when China started to privatize state-owned enterprises and when the status of private firms was legalized (Cao, Qian, and Weingast 1999; Li 2003). These reforms were dramatic, with millions of state-owned workers being laid off and moving to jobs in the private sector. At the same time, the government started to allow largescale migration of rural workers to cities (Cai and Wang 2010). Taken as a whole, these reforms established an external labor market that not only helped reallocate workers but also linked wages more closely to productivity (Zhang, Zhao, Park, and Song 2005). With these reforms, the private sector has become a prominent player in the labor market, with private sector employment as a proportion of total urban employment rising from literally nothing in the early 1980s to about 80 percent at present, as shown in Figure 5.  \n\nOne consequence of the labor market reforms is the increase in the return to education, suggesting that the link between wage and productivity is becoming stronger. We replicate Zhang et al. (2005) in calculating a Mincer-style rate of return to education--that is, using wages as a dependent variable, and level of education and work experience as the key explanatory variables--but use the Urban Household Survey sample, which covers more provinces and a longer time series. The results of this calculation, reported in Figure 6, show that the return to an additional year of schooling is only 2.3 percent in 1988, but it increased to about 9 percent in 2000 and has been stable in the past decade. The return to an additional year of education in the latest year of 2009 was 9.5 percent, similar to the world average rate of 9.7 percent, as reported by Psacharopoulos and Patrinos (2004). The return to college education in China increased the fastest, from only about 7.4 percent in the largely planned labor allocation system in 1988 to 49.2 percent in the much more flexible labor market system of 2009, exceeding the average 40 percent return in developed economies.  \n\n![](images/160b56b4e858c73617666e7734939bc148e7b55cea97591c25e8601654184494.jpg)  \nFigure6 Returns to Education in Urban China   \nSource: Authors’ estimations using data from the Urban Household Survey data in 9 provinces, 1988-2009.  \n\n### Demographic Transition and Labor Shortage  \n\nChina has experienced a demographic transition from high to low birthrates since the 1970s. China had a baby boom from 1950 to 1978, with the total fertility rate averaging 5.2 births per woman, although a break occurred during the so-called \"Great Leap Forward\" from 1958 to 1961, during which around 30 million people died (Ashton, Hill, Piazza, and Zeitz 1984). China's total population increased from 552 million in 1950 to 963 million by 1978. In 1979, China started the “onechild policy,” the largest and strictest population control policy in human history (Banister 1987). According to this policy, still largely in effect today, each woman is allowed to have only one child, and above-quota births are heavily fined. The one-child policy, together with other social and economic changes, has a significant impact on the fertility rate (Li and Zhang 2007; Li, Zhang, and Zhu 2011). China's total fertility rate fell sharply from 6 births per woman in 1970 to only 1.4 in 2010 (TheEconomist 2011).  \n\nMany countries have experienced lower birthrates as their economies develop, but the speed and magnitude of China's demographic transition are unprecedented in world history. The natural growth rate of China's population has decreased to an annual rate of 0.56 percent since 2001, similar to the population growth rate in Japan from 1980 to 1985. The United Kingdom took about 200 years (1750 to 1955) to complete its demographic transition to having low birthrates, and the United States took 140 years (1800 to 1940) to do the same (Livi-Bacci 1997; Greenwood and Seshadri 2002), while China's transition took only about 30 to 40 years.  \n\nThis rapid shift to lower birthrates creates the “demographic dividend,” that is, a situation in which a disproportionate share of the population is in its prime working years, with relatively few children or elderly. As Chinese baby boomers entered the labor market in the past three decades, China's labor force increased from 583 million in 1980 to about one billion in 2011. The sharply declining fertility of the baby boomers then leads to a low “young dependency ratio\" or a large proportion of working-age people. Indeed, the working-age population aged 15-64 increased from 59.3 percent of China's population in 1980 to 74.4 percent in 2011. A large proportion in the work force and a low dependency ratio all tend to be accompanied by a high savings rate, abundant labor, and abundant working time for labor, which are beneficial for economic growth (Li and Zhang 2007).  \n\nHowever, the same demographic transition also means that China has entered a period when its labor force will increase much more slowly. Because of the low fertility of the baby boomers, China's labor force growth has been slowing down. As shown in the last section, coinciding with the faster wage growth after 1997, the growth rate of China's labor force dropped from 1.9 percent before 1997 to 1.4 percent since 1997, suggesting that the declining labor force growth could be one of the reasons behind the fast wage growth in the last decade.  \n\nBased on the “low variant\" estimates by the United Nations (201l), China's population is expected to begin declining by 2015, and the labor force may have already peaked in 2011. According to these projections, which assume no upward shift of the birth rate, China's population will decrease from its current level of 1.34 billion to 1.13 billion by 2050, and the working population will decrease from one billion to 696 million. By then, China's labor force as a proportion of the population will drop to 62 percent, whereas the proportion of the elderly (aged 65 and over) will reach 29 percent. The dropping labor force proportion will cause labor shortages and help push wages up further.4  \n\nChina is already experiencing labor shortages. China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security carries out quarterly surveys that cover official job centers in 117 cities. These surveys show that the “position/seeker ratio,” which is the ratio of newly created positions over the number of job seekers, has been trending upward from 0.65 at the start of 2001 to above 1.0 in the first quarter of 2010 and 1.08 in the first quarter of 2012. When the position/seeker ratio exceeded one for the first time in China, the number of newly created jobs exceeded the number of job seekers.  \n\nThe labor shortage phenomenon is especially evident in China's coastal areas, such as the Pearl River Delta and the Yangtze River Delta areas. In the first quarter of 2008, the position/seeker ratio in the Pearl River Delta area reached a historical high of 1.89. Although the ratio dropped during the global financial crisis, it has rebounded with the recovering economy. In the first quarter of 2010, the ratios for the areas of the Pearl River Delta, Southeast Fujian, Yangtze River Delta, and Bohai increased to levels above 1, indicating a labor shortage in most of the coastal regions.  \n\nCan population growth increase again if China relaxes the one-child policy? This outcome seems unlikely. China is already relaxing the policy by allowing couples who are both an only child to have a second child. The first cohorts of the “one-child policy” children (born in the 1980s) are already in their childbearing age, but the birth rate has shown no sign of recovery so far. The one-child policy, together with many other social and economic reforms, may have caused a lasting change in preferences about fertility in China. There have also been calls for a total removal of all birth control policies, but the government seems hesitant to do so because of political resistance from both the multitude of birth control agencies and the people who were penalized by the one-child policy.  \n\n### Slowing Down of Structural Changes  \n\nThe migration of rural workers to urban areas in recent decades has helped keep the wages low in urban areas, but this pattern seems ripe for change as well. According to various Statistical Yearbooks of China, the number of migrant workers increased from 25 million in 1985 to 159 million in 2011. However, the growth rate of migrant workers is slowing down. Using 1997 as the breaking point, the growth rate declined from 10.8 percent per year before 1997 to only about 4.6 percent annually since then.  \n\nThe major barriers to increasing migration from rural areas are a combination of the remaining institutions, such as the hukou system, and the fact that many of those who can migrate at the lowest cost are already doing so. Chinese households are managed by the hukou (household registration) system, which was established in the early 1950s to consolidate socialist governance, control domestic migration, and administer the planned economy. Every person is required to be registered at his/ her place of birth and then acquire a hukou certificate that specifies rural/urban status and location from there. All administrative activities, such as land distribution, issuance of identity cards, registration of a child in school, and medical insurance, are based on hukou status. Until the early 1990s, the hukou was also used to distribute food, cooking oil, and clothing coupons, thus restricting internal mobility in both urban and rural areas. Although the hukou system has been gradually relaxed since the mid-1990s, it still restricts migration in many ways. Farmers have been allowed to migrate to cities to work since the mid-1990s, but they cannot change their hukou status and thus cannot enjoy public services in the cities such as education, medical insurance, housing, and pensions. Unfortunately, most of these public services are of much lower quality or do not even exist in rural areas because most of the government spending is in urban areas. The huge gap in public welfare provision prevents the government from removing the hukou policy, as entrenched urban residents do not want to share their welfare benefits with the migrants, even though they need migrant workers to provide services. A recent proposal to allow migrant children to take the college entrance exams in cities has received heavy resistance from the local residents in Beijing and Shanghai.5  \n\nTable2 Proportion of Chinese Rural Residents Working Off-Farm   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Age cohorts</td><td>1995</td><td>2004</td><td>2007</td></tr><tr><td>16-20</td><td>23.7</td><td>74.3</td><td>97.7</td></tr><tr><td>21-25</td><td>33.6</td><td>80.7</td><td>86.5</td></tr><tr><td>26-30</td><td>28.8</td><td>70.5</td><td>77.1</td></tr><tr><td>31-35</td><td>26.9</td><td>62.0</td><td>65.6</td></tr><tr><td>36-40</td><td>20.5</td><td>53.7</td><td>73.5</td></tr><tr><td>41-50</td><td>20.8</td><td>41.5</td><td>54.3</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nSources: De Brauw, Huang, Rozelle, Zhang, and Zhang (2002), Rozelle, Huang, Zhang, and Li (2008).  \n\nVarious pieces of evidence suggest that the marginal cost of migration is rising. and the distance and need for migration are being shaped by the hukou system. According to de Brauw, Huang, Rozelle, Zhang, and Zhang (2002) and Rozelle, Huang, Zhang, and Li (2008), who conducted three rounds of surveys in China in 1995, 2004, and 2007, most young rural residents no longer worked in agriculture by 20o7. The probability of doing off-farm work for all rural laborers increased from 31 percent in 1995 to 60 percent in 2007. The sharpest increase was observed among the youngest age group of 16-20, for which the probability of working off farm increased from 24 percent in 1995 to 98 percent in 2007, as shown in Table 2. Now, the youngest cohorts of laborers have almost no farmers. Even for older cohorts, the probability of working off farm was very high by 2007: the probability was 87 percent for cohorts aged 21-25 and 77 percent for cohorts aged 26 to 30. As fewer young rural laborers are available, the marginal migrant worker will become older and have a higher marginal cost of migration. Indeed, the average age of migrants is increasing. According to a survey by China's National Bureau of Statistics, the average age of off-farm laborers increased from 34 years in 2008 to 36 years in 2011. The proportion of older off-farm laborers (aged 41 or above) increased from 30 to 38 percent in the same period. Thus, the potential supply is largely tapped out.  \n\nMigrants are staying closer to home, which helps reduce their migration costs. Again, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, the proportion of migrants working out of the province decreased from 53 percent in 2008 to 47 percent in 2011. The proportion of migrant workers working away from their home provinces decreased most significantly in China's poorest western areas, from 63 to 57 percent in the three-year period.  \n\nOne reason why migrants can remain closer to home is that some factories and laborers are also moving from the coastal to the inland areas because of rising production costs such as labor and land costs, a phenomenon termed “flying geese\" by Akamatsu (1962). For instance, Foxconn Technology Group is the largest contract supplier (assembling electronic products by Sony, Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Nokia, and other brand names) in China, employing over a million workers. This company moved its major plants away from Shenzhen to inland provinces such as Hebei and Henan (Luk 2010), mainly because of the hefty wage increases in Shenzhen.  \n\nHowever, the migration of firms and workers back to the inland areas is likely to be limited. In fact, Chinese manufacturing industries have been highly concentrated in the coastal areas since the central government established five special economic zones in the coastal areas in the 1980s (Wen 2004), and they have become even more geographically agglomerated in the last decade (Long and Zhang 2012). The agglomeration of industries in the coastal or border areas has occurred in other East Asian countries as well as in the rest of the world (Hanson 1996). One explanation for this phenomenon is the Krugman (1991) lock-in hypothesis, which argues that once industries are concentrated in the coastal regions for whatever reason, and then increasing returns to scale in production occur, more firms are encouraged to locate in these regions to benefit from the backward and forward linkages and from the external economies created. The reduction in China's trade barriers can also facilitate agglomeration in the coastal and border areas (Hanson 2o01).  \n\n# Conclusion  \n\nIn the 1980s and through the late 1990s, Chinese workers were cheap in the sense that their labor cost relative to productivity was much lower than that of most other countries. Therefore, firms earned rents by sourcing in China, which triggered fast employment growth and rural-urban migration. But because of changes since the late 1990s, including institutional reforms in China's labor markets and demographic transition that have reduced what used to be a huge amount of slack in labor supply, the “underpricing\" of Chinese labor appears to be coming to an end. Wages are rising faster than labor productivity, particularly in labor-intensive exporting industries such as apparel and electronics, which will likely move out of China and probably go to countries like India and Vietnam.  \n\nChina is becoming a middle-wage country. If the annual rate of wage growth of 13.8 percent over the past decade is maintained, the average real wage in urban China would reach $\\$20,000$ in U.S. dollars by 2020. As benchmarks for comparison, U.S. compensation for manufacturing workers reached $\\$20,000$ in 1980, Japanese compensation for manufacturing workers reached this level in 1986, and the annual wage in Korea reached $\\$20,000$ in 1995, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Even if China's wage only grows at par with productivity at 11.3 percent per year, the Chinese average real wage will reach $\\$20,000$ by 2022. Similarly to other middle-wage countries, China needs to make a transition toward higher valueadded industries, whether export or domestic.  \n\nIs China ready to move up the technological ladder? We believe the answer is “yes,” for several reasons. First, China's aggregate labor productivity has been increasing at 11.3 percent per year for over a decade, partly because of manufacturing firms' heavy investment in research and development (with expenditures on research and development per worker increasing at an annual rate of 16.9 percent in the past 20 years) and capital deepening (total assets per worker in China increased to $\\$94,240$ in 2010). Second, human capital, at least measured in quantity, has risen dramatically. In 1999, the Chinese government started an aggressive \"College Expansion\" movement that increased the college entry class enrollment from 1.1 million in 1998 to 6.6 million in 2011. By 2050, Ma (2010) predicts that 40 percent of China's labor force can be expected to hold a college degree, similar to the level of Japan's labor force today.  \n\nIn short, the end of cheap labor in China does not mean the end of Chinese economic growth. Rising productivity and education mean that China's comparative advantage is shifting. If China can improve the quality of education and develop institutions that help to foster innovation and entrepreneurship, then going forward, China may join a place alongside Korea and Japan (with a lag of two decades) as a formidable force in high value-added manufacturing and innovation.  \n\n# References  \n\nAkamatsu, Kaname. 1962. “A Historical Pattern   \nof Economic Growth in Developing Countries.\"   \nThe Developing Economies 1(1): 3-25.

    "reference_markdown": "# The End of Cheap Chinese Labor  \n\nHongbin Li, Lei Li, Binzhen Wu, and Yanyan Xiong  \n\nn recent decades, cheap labor has played a central role in the Chinese model, which has relied on expanded participation in world trade as a main driver of growth (Lin, Cai, and Li 2003; Bernstein 2004). At the beginning of China's economic reforms in 1978, the annual wage of a Chinese urban worker was only $\\$1,004$ in U.S. dollars: that is, 615 renminbi yuan divided by China's official exchange rate of 1.68 yuan/dollar in that year, and then deflated to the 2010 level by the U.S. GDP deflator. (The official exchange rate was overvalued at the time, but it is useful in measuring the price that U.S. consumers pay for Chinese labor embodied in Chinese goods.) Back in 1978, China's wage was only 3 percent of the average U.S. wage at that time, and it was also significantly lower than the wages in neighboring Asian countries such as the Philippines and Thailand. The Chinese wage was also low relative to productivity. According to Ceglowski and Golub (2007), China's “unit labor cost\"--wage as a percentage of labor productivity—-relative to the same ratio in the United States declined from over 70 percent in the 1980s to about 30 percent in the mid-1990s.  \n\nHowever, wages are now rising in China. In 2010, the annual wage of a Chinese urban worker reached $\\$5,487$ in U.S. dollars-that is, 37,147 yuan divided by the exchange rate of 6.77 yuan/dollar—which is similar to wages earned by workers in the Philippines and Thailand and significantly higher than those earned by workers in India and Indonesia. China's wages also increased faster than productivity since the late 1990s, suggesting that Chinese labor is becoming more expensive in this senseaswell.  \n\nThe opening section of this paper discusses China's rising wages in more detail. For example, the increase in China's wages is not confined to any sector, as wages have increased for both skilled and unskilled workers, for both coastal and inland areas, and for both exporting and nonexporting firms. We then benchmark wage growth to productivity growth using both national- and industry-level data, showing that Chinese labor was kept cheap until the late 1990s but the relative cost of labor has increased since then. Finally, we discuss the main forces that are pushing wages up. For example, the reforms in the late 1990s re-established a flexible labor market in China, enabling firms to pay workers according to productivity. China's labor force may have already reached its peak in 2011; and China's rural-to-urban migration will also slow down because the rural young are highly mobile; almost all rural youth in the 16-20 age bracket are already working off the farm (Rozelle, Huang, Zhang, and Li 2008). Therefore, future increases in migrant labor must come from those who are older or those who have established families, who will require the prospect of larger wage gains than migrants of the past if they are to find migration worthwhile.  \n\n## Rising Wages in China  \n\nChina's urban areas have a dual labor market: one for urban workers and the other for low-skilled migrant workers. Urban workers (both skilled and unskilled) have urban hukou (household registration), which means that they are registered with the government as living permanently in cities. Migrant workers have rural hukou, and they are very mobile in two aspects. First, they live temporarily in the places where they work during the year and return to their rural homes during the Chinese New Year holidays and the peak agricultural seasons (Wang and Zuo 1999). Although more migrant workers have chosen to stay in cities permanently in recent years, an average migrant worker spent 2.2 months in their rural homes and 9.8 months in off-farm work away from home in 2011 (2011 Survey of Off-farm Laborers by China's National Bureau of Statistics). Second, these workers often change their migration destinations and jobs. After the Chinese New Year holidays, which is a period of one to two months, they return to the cities to work, but they are highly likely to change jobs or migrate to a new city. They also change jobs and locations within a year, which makes tracking them in regular household surveys very difficult. With the difficulty of surveying this particular group, no large-scale survey data that cover all Chinese workers are available. However, China's National Bureau of Statistics does have good data for urban workers.  \n\n![](images/487f5fb43d08b3734adec21dc97d55c0f7a96151ffdef5c8686fcb9a7bf8d935.jpg)  \nFigure1 Real Annual Wages of Chinese Urban Workers (deflated to 2010 prices)   \nSource:China StatisticalYearbooks. Note: PPI is producer price index.  \n\nIn the first two decades of the reform period from 1978 up to the later part of the 1990s, the growth of workers’ wages in Chinese urban areas was relatively low, as shown in Figure 1. According to the Statistical Yearbooks published by China's National Bureau of Statistics, the annual real wage of a Chinese urban worker increased only slightly from $\\$1,004$ in 1978 to $\\$1,026$ in 1997, at an average annual growth rate of only 0.1 percent (before tax, including pensions, and again converted from yuan to U.s. dollars using the current exchange rate, and to the 2010 level using the U.S. GDP deflator). This growth rate of China's urban wages is significantly lower than China's annual real growth rate of 4.0 percent (in real U.S. dollars) in these two decades.1  \n\nHowever, China's wage growth started to pick up steam in the late 1990s. In 1998, the real wage as measured in U.S. dollars grew by over 14.1 percent, marking the start of a new era of fast wage growth. In the period from 1998 to 2010, the average annual growth rate of real wages was 13.8 percent, exceeding the real GDP growth rate of 12.7 percent. The fast rise of China's urban wages since the late 1990s is due in part to institutional factors such as the privatization of state-owned enterprises in the mid-1990s, the re-establishment of the labor market, and the slowdown of labor force growth and migration, which we will discuss in detail below. As Figure 1 shows, the real wage in yuan grew faster than the real wage converted to dollars at the then-current yuan/dollar exchange rate because China's official exchange rate was overvalued before 1994.  \n\n![](images/0effdb8857124f7253c7de5320bc894a5045103816ce30710963a93614dd257e.jpg)  \nFigure2 Annual Manufacturing Wages of Asian Emerging Economies (real U.S. dollars in 2010, deflated by the U.S. GDP deflator)   \nSource: International Labor Organization LABORSTA Database.  \n\nChina's wages have also increased compared with the wages of other developing economies. In Figure 2, we compare the manufacturing wages of a group of Asian developing countries. Note that China's manufacturing wage is lower than the overall wage in Figure 1. Among these countries, China had one of the lowest manufacturing wage rates in 1994 at $\\$694$ in U.S. dollars, or about 17 percent of the manufacturing wage in the Philippines. By 2008, the last year in which we have data for most of these countries, China's wages are second only to those of the Philippines, marking a wage gap of only 18 percent. The wages of two other populous Asian countries, India and Indonesia, are much lower at only about 41 and 34 percent of China's wages, respectively, in 2006, the last year in which data for India are available.  \n\nTo explore whether the rise of China's wages is confined to certain sectors, we use micro-level data from the Urban Household Survey, which covers all urban areas in China and uses probabilistic sampling and a stratified, multistage method to select households. To be included in the sample, a household must reside in a specific city for at least six months. Therefore, this sample does not include migrant workers who live in a city for less than six months or those who work off the farm in rural areas. The sampled households are asked to keep a detailed record of their incomes and expenditures every day. In the subsequent discussion, we will examine China's wages by exploring this dataset.2 The wages reported in this study are lower than the aggregate statistics reported in Figures 1 and 2 because firms report aggregate wages, including pensions and taxes.  \n\n![](images/2ab08a2671b0474fdee42581d38079c91dd412e1e4940514cb369bedf1b9efca.jpg)  \nFigure3 Annual Wages of Urban Workers by Education Level (real U.S. dollars in 2010, deflated by the U.S.GDP deflator)   \nSource: The Urban Household Survey data in 9 provinces, 1988-2009. Notes: Education levels: “low” refers to junior high school and below,“medium” refers to academic/technical high school, and “high\" refers to college and above. \"Low-education beginners\" are low-education workers with working experience less than 5 years.  \n\nWages are increasing for China's workers at all skill levels. Figure 3 shows that growth rates of real wages for those with low education level (junior high school and below), medium education level (academic and technical high school), and high education level (college and above) are all increasing at high speeds--at 6.5, 7.6, and 9.0 percent per year, respectively. Fast wage growth rates even for unskilled workers suggest an overall rise in wages. To explore this phenomenon further, we examine the wages for low-education beginners, or low-education workers with less than five years of experience in the job market. Their wage growth was 7.8 percent per year in the 1988-2009 sample period and was actually higher at 9.8 percent annually from 1997 to 2o09, which is a faster increase than for urban workers as a whole.  \n\n![](images/d7958f777c538431b6f9e0e680696c8e085e6e285a09420bb37052176b6c686d.jpg)  \nFigure4 Annual Wages of Urban Workers by Region (real U.S. dollars in 2010, deflated by the U.S. GDP deflator)   \nSource: Wages by regions are from the Urban Household Survey data in nine provinces, 1988-2009.  \n\nWages are also rising in both the more-developed coastal regions and the less-developed inland regions despite the wage gap that exists between the two, as illustrated in Figure 4. The growth rate of wages in the inland regions was 7.7 percent per year from 1988 to 2009, which was one percentage point lower than the growth rate in the coastal regions. As a result, this regional wage gap increased to 54.6 percent in 2009. However, the inland regions have been catching up since 1997, with their annual wage growth rate being one percentage point higher than in coastal regions (10.9 versus 9.9 percent annually). Wages are also rising for both exporting and nonexporting firms. Interestingly, nonexporting firms have higher wages than exporting firms, similar to the findings of Lu (2010). However, the wage gap between these two types of firms is also declining over time.  \n\nThe Urban Household Survey does not include the most mobile migrant workers, who may be the lowest-paid workers in China. To examine this issue, we use some aggregate statistics of migrant wages released by the National Bureau of Statistics. The annual real wages of migrant workers, who tend to have a junior high school degree or lower education level, averaged $\\$2,541$ (in U.S. dollars) in 2009, is almost the same as the real wages of low-education workers in the Urban Household Survey sample in the same year $(\\$2,567)$ . The wages of the two samples corroborate each other, and their similarity suggests that the wages of low-skilled urban workers may track those of migrant workers. In terms of wage growth, the wages of migrant workers in the sample from the Rural Household Survey also increased at a high annual rate of 9.6 percent from 2003 to 2009. Furthermore, the wages of migrant workers increased even faster in the last two years, reaching $\\$3,535$ (in U.S. dollars) in 2011.  \n\n## Wages versus Productivity  \n\nAlthough China's wages have been rising fast, if their growth rate is lower than that of labor productivity, then labor is effectively becoming cheaper per unit of product. So, to answer whether China's fast wage growth since 1997 implies that Chinese labor is becoming more expensive, we need to compare wage growth to labor productivity growth. In doing so, we find that Chinese labor becomes cheaper before the late 1990s, but not since then.  \n\nWe calculate the growth of gross labor productivity by deducting the growth rate of the labor force from the growth rate of real GDP, drawing on data published in China's Statistical Yearbooks. In the period of 1982 (the first year in which we have data on labor force) to 1997, China's GDP (converted at the official exchange rate and deflated to real 2010 U.S. dollars) increased by 5.5 percent, and the labor force grew by 1.9 percent, implying labor productivity growth of 3.6 percent per year. This figure almost triples the real wage growth of 1.3 percent per year during that period, suggesting that Chinese labor was becoming cheaper relative to productivity during this period. Of course, this is a simple calculation that it does not adjust for changes in the quality and quantity of other inputs such as capital and the human capital of the labor force, but it is nonetheless revealing.  \n\nChinese labor also became cheaper relative to other countries over this time period. Ceglowski and Golub (2007) find that manufacturing “unit labor costs\" the ratio of wages to labor productivity--fell for China relative to that of the United States from over 70 percent in the early 1980s to about 30 percent in the mid-1990s. Moreover, the relative cost of Chinese labor at this time was not only lower than that of developed countries but was also lower than that of developing countries such as India, Malaysia, and Mexico. It appears that wage growth fell far behind productivity growth in China during this period.  \n\nHowever, China's wages have increased at a much faster rate than productivity since 1997. Using our aggregate data, we find that China's GDP in real U.S. dollars increased by 12.7 percent annually in the period from 1997 to 2010, whereas labor force growth decreased to only 1.4 percent, implying an annual growth rate of 11.3 percent for gross labor productivity. Although this rate is much faster than that of the productivity growth before 1997, it is lower than the astonishing annual real wage growth of 13.8 percent in the same period. Therefore, Chinese labor is indeed becoming more expensive.? According to Ceglowski and Golub (2007), China's relative unit labor cost was 63 percent that of Malaysia and 70 percent that of Korea by 2002. If the gap between wages and productivity in China continues to close by 2.5 percent per year, China's advantage of lower labor cost relative to Korea will be completely eliminated by the year 2018, and that relative to Malaysia will be goneby2022.  \n\nTable1 Characteristics of Selected Manufacturing Sectors in China   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Employment (million)</td><td>Export/ Salesratio</td><td>Capital/Labor ratio (1,000 US$)</td><td>Valueadded perworker (1,000 US$)</td><td colspan=\"2\">Wage/(value-added outputperworker)</td></tr><tr><td>Industry</td><td>2010 (1)</td><td>2010 (2)</td><td>2010 (3)</td><td>2010 (4)</td><td>2007 (5)</td><td>2010 (6)</td></tr><tr><td>Leather,fur, and other textiles</td><td>2.76</td><td>0.30</td><td>20.88</td><td>11.60</td><td>0.28</td><td>0.39</td></tr><tr><td>Wearing apparel</td><td>4.47</td><td>0.28</td><td>23.22</td><td>11.04</td><td>0.31</td><td>0.41</td></tr><tr><td>Instruments</td><td>1.25</td><td>0.33</td><td>61.14</td><td>18.63</td><td>0.35</td><td>0.25</td></tr><tr><td>Electronics</td><td>7.73</td><td>0.63</td><td>72.10</td><td>19.32</td><td>0.12</td><td>0.24</td></tr><tr><td>Electricalmachinery</td><td>6.04</td><td>0.19</td><td>77.53</td><td>23.01</td><td>0.22</td><td>0.20</td></tr><tr><td>Transport equipment</td><td>5.74</td><td>0.11</td><td>123.53</td><td>30.51</td><td>0.24</td><td>0.15</td></tr><tr><td>Basiciron and steel</td><td>3.46</td><td>0.03</td><td>196.51</td><td>55.13</td><td>0.20</td><td>0.08</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nSource: China Statistical Yearbook (various years). Notes: All values are in 2010 real U.S. dollars. Industry classification follows the GB/T4754 standard released by China's National Statistics Bureau. The 1997 data include all enterprises in the specific industry, while the 2010 data only include enterprises above a designated size in an industry.\"“Instruments\" refers to precision and optical instruments; “Electronics\" refers to radio, television, and communication equipment and apparatus; “Electrical machinery\" refers to electrical machinery and apparatus.  \n\nWe draw on recent industry-level data to examine the unit labor cost: in this case, our measurement is the average wage as a proportion of value added per worker. In particular, we select several two-digit industries as cases from China's Statistical Yearbooks. As shown in column 1 of Table 1, these industries are large in employment size: they employ more than 1 million workers each and 31 million workers in total in 2010. Most of them are also major exporters, with 29 percent of their sales as exports on average (column 2). To facilitate analysis, we sort these firms by the capital/labor ratio (column 3), which can be viewed as a measure of labor (or capital) intensity or as revealing the level of technology.  \n\nThese variables suggest several interesting associations. First, labor-intensive industries are major exporters with very high export/sales ratios, consistent with the fact that China uses its abundant labor for export industries. Among the seven industries, basic iron and steel has the lowest labor intensity, and its sales are mainly domestic. Second, there is a clear negative association between the capital/ labor ratio (column 3) and unit wage cost (column 6), which is defined as the ratio of wage to value added per worker, suggesting that labor-intensive industries have higher unit labor costs.  \n\nFinally, the last two columns suggest that labor-intensive industries experienced a sharp rise in unit labor costs. As an example, for the apparel industry, the unit labor cost increased from 0.31 in 1997 (column 5) to 0.41 in 2010 (column 6). The unit labor cost also increased in two other relatively low-tech industries: leather, fur, and other textiles; and electronics (which is mostly assembly). However, industries with higher capital/labor ratios like transport equipment and basic iron and steel experienced a decline in unit labor costs in the same period, suggesting that the labor cost advantage remains for the relatively high-tech industries.  \n\n## Potential Reasons for Rising Wages  \n\nThe discussion to this point has argued that China's real wage was more or less stagnant or stable in the 1980s and early 1990s, and grew substantially beginning in the late 1990s. In this section, we discuss three potential reasons for this change: institutional reforms, the disappearing “demographic dividend,” and the slowing of rural-urban migration.  \n\n### Institutional Reforms  \n\nChina has transformed its economy from a planned labor allocation system to a more market-oriented labor market. In the planned system, workers were allocated by the central planner to the state-owned enterprises, and jobs were permanent with little mobility (Fleisher and Wang 2004). The central planner set the wages of all workers in the country using a simple system of grades, with the grade mainly depending on seniority. Wages were set low, and so was the wage gap between grades. In this system, wages did not reflect productivity, and because of this and the misallocation of workers, productivity was low.  \n\nThe first major step in China's urban labor market reforms was to establish an internal pay incentive system within state-owned enterprises. Starting in the late 1980s, the financial insolvency of many state-owned enterprises prompted the Chinese government to undertake a series of reforms. The reforms started by allowing profitable firms to pay higher wages and even bonuses to the more productive workers, which increased the pay difference among workers (Park, Song, Zhang, and Zhao 2008). However, because private firms were still not allowed in these areas and job mobility was low, there was essentially no external labor market.  \n\n![](images/50adfa70d3d8e5e03d2bdb8b99a99e6b5fd2f98130ba8e277286122d192a1c42.jpg)  \nFigure5 Private Employment as a Proportion of Total Urban Employment   \nSource:China StatisticalYearbooks.  \n\nThe second step in urban labor market reforms was to establish an external labor market. The most aggressive enterprise reforms took place in the mid-to-late 1990s, when China started to privatize state-owned enterprises and when the status of private firms was legalized (Cao, Qian, and Weingast 1999; Li 2003). These reforms were dramatic, with millions of state-owned workers being laid off and moving to jobs in the private sector. At the same time, the government started to allow largescale migration of rural workers to cities (Cai and Wang 2010). Taken as a whole, these reforms established an external labor market that not only helped reallocate workers but also linked wages more closely to productivity (Zhang, Zhao, Park, and Song 2005). With these reforms, the private sector has become a prominent player in the labor market, with private sector employment as a proportion of total urban employment rising from literally nothing in the early 1980s to about 80 percent at present, as shown in Figure 5.  \n\nOne consequence of the labor market reforms is the increase in the return to education, suggesting that the link between wage and productivity is becoming stronger. We replicate Zhang et al. (2005) in calculating a Mincer-style rate of return to education--that is, using wages as a dependent variable, and level of education and work experience as the key explanatory variables--but use the Urban Household Survey sample, which covers more provinces and a longer time series. The results of this calculation, reported in Figure 6, show that the return to an additional year of schooling is only 2.3 percent in 1988, but it increased to about 9 percent in 2000 and has been stable in the past decade. The return to an additional year of education in the latest year of 2009 was 9.5 percent, similar to the world average rate of 9.7 percent, as reported by Psacharopoulos and Patrinos (2004). The return to college education in China increased the fastest, from only about 7.4 percent in the largely planned labor allocation system in 1988 to 49.2 percent in the much more flexible labor market system of 2009, exceeding the average 40 percent return in developed economies.  \n\n![](images/42773742e0bb9384ffdd8c70229faf76378a4ca87caa5d429649c64c93ff2ea2.jpg)  \nFigure6 Returns to Education in Urban China   \nSource: Authors’ estimations using data from the Urban Household Survey data in 9 provinces, 1988-2009.  \n\n### Demographic Transition and Labor Shortage  \n\nChina has experienced a demographic transition from high to low birthrates since the 1970s. China had a baby boom from 1950 to 1978, with the total fertility rate averaging 5.2 births per woman, although a break occurred during the so-called \"Great Leap Forward\" from 1958 to 1961, during which around 30 million people died (Ashton, Hill, Piazza, and Zeitz 1984). China's total population increased from 552 million in 1950 to 963 million by 1978. In 1979, China started the “onechild policy,” the largest and strictest population control policy in human history (Banister 1987). According to this policy, still largely in effect today, each woman is allowed to have only one child, and above-quota births are heavily fined. The one-child policy, together with other social and economic changes, has a significant impact on the fertility rate (Li and Zhang 2007; Li, Zhang, and Zhu 2011). China's total fertility rate fell sharply from 6 births per woman in 1970 to only 1.4 in 2010 (TheEconomist 2011).  \n\nMany countries have experienced lower birthrates as their economies develop, but the speed and magnitude of China's demographic transition are unprecedented in world history. The natural growth rate of China's population has decreased to an annual rate of 0.56 percent since 2001, similar to the population growth rate in Japan from 1980 to 1985. The United Kingdom took about 200 years (1750 to 1955) to complete its demographic transition to having low birthrates, and the United States took 140 years (1800 to 1940) to do the same (Livi-Bacci 1997; Greenwood and Seshadri 2002), while China's transition took only about 30 to 40 years.  \n\nThis rapid shift to lower birthrates creates the “demographic dividend,” that is, a situation in which a disproportionate share of the population is in its prime working years, with relatively few children or elderly. As Chinese baby boomers entered the labor market in the past three decades, China's labor force increased from 583 million in 1980 to about one billion in 2011. The sharply declining fertility of the baby boomers then leads to a low “young dependency ratio\" or a large proportion of working-age people. Indeed, the working-age population aged 15-64 increased from 59.3 percent of China's population in 1980 to 74.4 percent in 2011. A large proportion in the work force and a low dependency ratio all tend to be accompanied by a high savings rate, abundant labor, and abundant working time for labor, which are beneficial for economic growth (Li and Zhang 2007).  \n\nHowever, the same demographic transition also means that China has entered a period when its labor force will increase much more slowly. Because of the low fertility of the baby boomers, China's labor force growth has been slowing down. As shown in the last section, coinciding with the faster wage growth after 1997, the growth rate of China's labor force dropped from 1.9 percent before 1997 to 1.4 percent since 1997, suggesting that the declining labor force growth could be one of the reasons behind the fast wage growth in the last decade.  \n\nBased on the “low variant\" estimates by the United Nations (201l), China's population is expected to begin declining by 2015, and the labor force may have already peaked in 2011. According to these projections, which assume no upward shift of the birth rate, China's population will decrease from its current level of 1.34 billion to 1.13 billion by 2050, and the working population will decrease from one billion to 696 million. By then, China's labor force as a proportion of the population will drop to 62 percent, whereas the proportion of the elderly (aged 65 and over) will reach 29 percent. The dropping labor force proportion will cause labor shortages and help push wages up further.4  \n\nChina is already experiencing labor shortages. China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security carries out quarterly surveys that cover official job centers in 117 cities. These surveys show that the “position/seeker ratio,” which is the ratio of newly created positions over the number of job seekers, has been trending upward from 0.65 at the start of 2001 to above 1.0 in the first quarter of 2010 and 1.08 in the first quarter of 2012. When the position/seeker ratio exceeded one for the first time in China, the number of newly created jobs exceeded the number of job seekers.  \n\nThe labor shortage phenomenon is especially evident in China's coastal areas, such as the Pearl River Delta and the Yangtze River Delta areas. In the first quarter of 2008, the position/seeker ratio in the Pearl River Delta area reached a historical high of 1.89. Although the ratio dropped during the global financial crisis, it has rebounded with the recovering economy. In the first quarter of 2010, the ratios for the areas of the Pearl River Delta, Southeast Fujian, Yangtze River Delta, and Bohai increased to levels above 1, indicating a labor shortage in most of the coastal regions.  \n\nCan population growth increase again if China relaxes the one-child policy? This outcome seems unlikely. China is already relaxing the policy by allowing couples who are both an only child to have a second child. The first cohorts of the “one-child policy” children (born in the 1980s) are already in their childbearing age, but the birth rate has shown no sign of recovery so far. The one-child policy, together with many other social and economic reforms, may have caused a lasting change in preferences about fertility in China. There have also been calls for a total removal of all birth control policies, but the government seems hesitant to do so because of political resistance from both the multitude of birth control agencies and the people who were penalized by the one-child policy.  \n\n### Slowing Down of Structural Changes  \n\nThe migration of rural workers to urban areas in recent decades has helped keep the wages low in urban areas, but this pattern seems ripe for change as well. According to various Statistical Yearbooks of China, the number of migrant workers increased from 25 million in 1985 to 159 million in 2011. However, the growth rate of migrant workers is slowing down. Using 1997 as the breaking point, the growth rate declined from 10.8 percent per year before 1997 to only about 4.6 percent annually since then.  \n\nThe major barriers to increasing migration from rural areas are a combination of the remaining institutions, such as the hukou system, and the fact that many of those who can migrate at the lowest cost are already doing so. Chinese households are managed by the hukou (household registration) system, which was established in the early 1950s to consolidate socialist governance, control domestic migration, and administer the planned economy. Every person is required to be registered at his/ her place of birth and then acquire a hukou certificate that specifies rural/urban status and location from there. All administrative activities, such as land distribution, issuance of identity cards, registration of a child in school, and medical insurance, are based on hukou status. Until the early 1990s, the hukou was also used to distribute food, cooking oil, and clothing coupons, thus restricting internal mobility in both urban and rural areas. Although the hukou system has been gradually relaxed since the mid-1990s, it still restricts migration in many ways. Farmers have been allowed to migrate to cities to work since the mid-1990s, but they cannot change their hukou status and thus cannot enjoy public services in the cities such as education, medical insurance, housing, and pensions. Unfortunately, most of these public services are of much lower quality or do not even exist in rural areas because most of the government spending is in urban areas. The huge gap in public welfare provision prevents the government from removing the hukou policy, as entrenched urban residents do not want to share their welfare benefits with the migrants, even though they need migrant workers to provide services. A recent proposal to allow migrant children to take the college entrance exams in cities has received heavy resistance from the local residents in Beijing and Shanghai.5  \n\nTable2 Proportion of Chinese Rural Residents Working Off-Farm   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Age cohorts</td><td>1995</td><td>2004</td><td>2007</td></tr><tr><td>16-20</td><td>23.7</td><td>74.3</td><td>97.7</td></tr><tr><td>21-25</td><td>33.6</td><td>80.7</td><td>86.5</td></tr><tr><td>26-30</td><td>28.8</td><td>70.5</td><td>77.1</td></tr><tr><td>31-35</td><td>26.9</td><td>62.0</td><td>65.6</td></tr><tr><td>36-40</td><td>20.5</td><td>53.7</td><td>73.5</td></tr><tr><td>41-50</td><td>20.8</td><td>41.5</td><td>54.3</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nSources: De Brauw, Huang, Rozelle, Zhang, and Zhang (2002), Rozelle, Huang, Zhang, and Li (2008).  \n\nVarious pieces of evidence suggest that the marginal cost of migration is rising. and the distance and need for migration are being shaped by the hukou system. According to de Brauw, Huang, Rozelle, Zhang, and Zhang (2002) and Rozelle, Huang, Zhang, and Li (2008), who conducted three rounds of surveys in China in 1995, 2004, and 2007, most young rural residents no longer worked in agriculture by 20o7. The probability of doing off-farm work for all rural laborers increased from 31 percent in 1995 to 60 percent in 2007. The sharpest increase was observed among the youngest age group of 16-20, for which the probability of working off farm increased from 24 percent in 1995 to 98 percent in 2007, as shown in Table 2. Now, the youngest cohorts of laborers have almost no farmers. Even for older cohorts, the probability of working off farm was very high by 2007: the probability was 87 percent for cohorts aged 21-25 and 77 percent for cohorts aged 26 to 30. As fewer young rural laborers are available, the marginal migrant worker will become older and have a higher marginal cost of migration. Indeed, the average age of migrants is increasing. According to a survey by China's National Bureau of Statistics, the average age of off-farm laborers increased from 34 years in 2008 to 36 years in 2011. The proportion of older off-farm laborers (aged 41 or above) increased from 30 to 38 percent in the same period. Thus, the potential supply is largely tapped out.  \n\nMigrants are staying closer to home, which helps reduce their migration costs. Again, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, the proportion of migrants working out of the province decreased from 53 percent in 2008 to 47 percent in 2011. The proportion of migrant workers working away from their home provinces decreased most significantly in China's poorest western areas, from 63 to 57 percent in the three-year period.  \n\nOne reason why migrants can remain closer to home is that some factories and laborers are also moving from the coastal to the inland areas because of rising production costs such as labor and land costs, a phenomenon termed “flying geese\" by Akamatsu (1962). For instance, Foxconn Technology Group is the largest contract supplier (assembling electronic products by Sony, Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Nokia, and other brand names) in China, employing over a million workers. This company moved its major plants away from Shenzhen to inland provinces such as Hebei and Henan (Luk 2010), mainly because of the hefty wage increases in Shenzhen.  \n\nHowever, the migration of firms and workers back to the inland areas is likely to be limited. In fact, Chinese manufacturing industries have been highly concentrated in the coastal areas since the central government established five special economic zones in the coastal areas in the 1980s (Wen 2004), and they have become even more geographically agglomerated in the last decade (Long and Zhang 2012). The agglomeration of industries in the coastal or border areas has occurred in other East Asian countries as well as in the rest of the world (Hanson 1996). One explanation for this phenomenon is the Krugman (1991) lock-in hypothesis, which argues that once industries are concentrated in the coastal regions for whatever reason, and then increasing returns to scale in production occur, more firms are encouraged to locate in these regions to benefit from the backward and forward linkages and from the external economies created. The reduction in China's trade barriers can also facilitate agglomeration in the coastal and border areas (Hanson 2o01).  \n\n# Conclusion  \n\nIn the 1980s and through the late 1990s, Chinese workers were cheap in the sense that their labor cost relative to productivity was much lower than that of most other countries. Therefore, firms earned rents by sourcing in China, which triggered fast employment growth and rural-urban migration. But because of changes since the late 1990s, including institutional reforms in China's labor markets and demographic transition that have reduced what used to be a huge amount of slack in labor supply, the “underpricing\" of Chinese labor appears to be coming to an end. Wages are rising faster than labor productivity, particularly in labor-intensive exporting industries such as apparel and electronics, which will likely move out of China and probably go to countries like India and Vietnam.  \n\nChina is becoming a middle-wage country. If the annual rate of wage growth of 13.8 percent over the past decade is maintained, the average real wage in urban China would reach $\\$20,000$ in U.S. dollars by 2020. As benchmarks for comparison, U.S. compensation for manufacturing workers reached $\\$20,000$ in 1980, Japanese compensation for manufacturing workers reached this level in 1986, and the annual wage in Korea reached $\\$20,000$ in 1995, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Even if China's wage only grows at par with productivity at 11.3 percent per year, the Chinese average real wage will reach $\\$20,000$ by 2022. Similarly to other middle-wage countries, China needs to make a transition toward higher valueadded industries, whether export or domestic.  \n\nIs China ready to move up the technological ladder? We believe the answer is “yes,” for several reasons. First, China's aggregate labor productivity has been increasing at 11.3 percent per year for over a decade, partly because of manufacturing firms' heavy investment in research and development (with expenditures on research and development per worker increasing at an annual rate of 16.9 percent in the past 20 years) and capital deepening (total assets per worker in China increased to $\\$94,240$ in 2010). Second, human capital, at least measured in quantity, has risen dramatically. In 1999, the Chinese government started an aggressive \"College Expansion\" movement that increased the college entry class enrollment from 1.1 million in 1998 to 6.6 million in 2011. By 2050, Ma (2010) predicts that 40 percent of China's labor force can be expected to hold a college degree, similar to the level of Japan's labor force today.  \n\nIn short, the end of cheap labor in China does not mean the end of Chinese economic growth. Rising productivity and education mean that China's comparative advantage is shifting. If China can improve the quality of education and develop institutions that help to foster innovation and entrepreneurship, then going forward, China may join a place alongside Korea and Japan (with a lag of two decades) as a formidable force in high value-added manufacturing and innovation.  \n\n# References  \n\nAkamatsu, Kaname. 1962. “A Historical Pattern   \nof Economic Growth in Developing Countries.\"   \nThe Developing Economies 1(1): 3-25.

Introduction  \n\nThe integration of the new generation of information technology (IT) and various sectors has a deep influence on the development of traditional sectors like the agriculture, industry, and services sectors, which prominently manifests the process of structural change. Structural change entails not only changes in output and productivity, but it also shifts the mix of inputs used in the production process (Bartel et al., 2007; Jorgenson and Timmer, 2011). One of the most obvious characteristics is the redistribution of labor across sectors. That is, the share of labor in agriculture has been declining systematically over time, while the share in services has been increasing steadily, and the share of labor in industry increases in the early stages of the redistribution process and then decreases in the later stages. Along the modern paths of development, China has been undergoing a process of structural transformation by which labor is reallocated between agriculture, industry, and services. Fig. 1 illustrates the process of China's structural labor changes. Currently, the rapid development of the new generation of IT is accelerating China's process of structural labor change. So, we cannot ignore their close relationship.  \n\nThis issue is central to understanding the structural transformation in the economic development literature, which has been extensively documented (Kuznets, 1971; Duarte and Restuccia, 2010). Most countries are going through a common process of structural transformation, although there are substantial lag differences in this process (Duarte and Restuccia, 2010). We may take China as an example. The transformation of the labor structure during China's rapid economic development has been associated with the substantial but often unnoticed development of the new generation of IT. Our paper analyzes the labor structural adjustment by taking a close look at the impact of emerging IT. We ask the following questions: Does the new generation of IT opti mize the structure of China's labor markets? Through which channel can it play this role? How much it will affect the transformation and upgradingof thelabor structure?  \n\nIn this paper, we examine the role of the new generation of IT on the reallocation of labor across sectors. We start our analysis by presenting a general equilibrium model of structural labor market change driven by a new generation of IT, following the early calibration strategy of Duarte and Restuccia (2010). Then, we calibrate the parameters according to China's economic characteristics to explore the role of the IT revolution in the process of structural labor change in China.  \n\n![](images/665d46b8c3a108af39b546521e748f7dca79481c14112dec123acf0b2bdf31e4.jpg)  \nFig. 1. China labor shares by sector, 1978-2018.  \n\nOur emphasis on the link between the new generation of IT and structural labor change is supported by observations that the process of the structural transformation has accelerated in recent years, and it is rooted in theoretical analyses. We construct a theoretical model of structural labor change driven by both new and old technology. We improve the model by distinguishing between these two technologies, introducing the new technology penetration rate, and considering differences in the production structures. Our model indicates that the development of the new generation of IT is significantly conducive to changes in the labor structure. The model replicates the basic time trend in sectoral shares of labor observed in the data.  \n\nThis paper uses Chinese labor market data from 1978 to 2018 to test our theoretical analysis. The database contains reliable information on China's dynamic characteristics of labor reallocation among three sectors. To fully understand the driving factors of structural labor change, we first distinguish and compare various drivers in the model that resulted in the structural labor adjustment and then test and analyze the role of the different mechanisms of the new generation of IT progress in particular.  \n\nOur empirical results are consistent with our theoretical analysis and are robust across different numerical simulations. By analyzing counterfactual experiments, we come to several conclusions. The significant improvement in the progress rate of new IT will accelerate the process of labor structural adjustment in a short period of time, while the improvement of the progress space of the new IT and the increase of its penetration rate among sectors will promote China's labor structural optimization in the long run, which is characterized by a significant decline in the share of labor in agriculture and a continuous increase in services.  \n\nThe causes of structural transformation are actively debated in current development research.The allocation of labor has been discussed since Baumol (1967).Inspired by the early contribution of Baumol (1967), related literature has identified several mechanisms that can drive structural change. The focus of previous literature on structural transformation has been on two channels. One strand of the literature has emphasized the demand-side mechanisms that introduce heterogeneity in the income elasticity of demand between goods (Kongsamut et al., 2001; Foellmi and Zweimiller, 2008; Boppart, 2014); whereas another strand has mostly highlighted the supply-side mechanisms whereby total factor productivity (TFP) differences between sectors play a leading role (Ngai and Pissarides, 2007; Acemoglu and Guerrieri, 2008; Ma0 and Ya0, 2012).  \n\nOur paper is related to studies on the relationship between technological progress, productivity improvement, and structural change. Fagerberg (2000) showed that new technologies play an important role in driving structural change. Ngai and Pissarides (2007) constructed a multisector structural change model and explained the productivity mechanism of structural adjustment by which labor resources will be transferred to sectors with a lower TFP growth rate when the substitution elasticity between final goods is low, while when the elasticity is high, it will be transferred to sectors with a higher TFP growth rate. Duarte and Restuccia (2010) studied structural change by investigating the role of sectoral labor productivity and concluded that a difference in productivity is the only cause of labor reallocation between three sectors under certain assumptions. Mao and Yao (2012) developed a dynamic general equilibrium model to examine structural change in a small open economy and used the productivity effect and the BalassaSamuelson effect to explicate the structural transformation. Swiecki (2017) formalized an argument that sector-based technological change is a vital driver of structural change that can be used to explain the shift of labor from manufacturing to services in the later stages of structural change. Monteforte (2020) developed a small-scale general equilibrium model to investigate the role of sectoral TFP in driving structural change and explains the importance of labor reallocation. Song (2021) studied the factors that drive labor share changes and showed the significant role of technological progress.  \n\nTechnological progress can contribute to structural change (Acemoglu, 2002; Desmet et al., 2020), and the advent of emerging technologies may directly substitute inputs (Acemoglu and Autor, 2011). In recent decades, one of the most remarkable technological changes has been the rapid development and wide application of IT, which may have a positive effect on labor productivity (Andersen, 2001). It has also been taken as the driving force of underlying the “productivity resurgence” (Jorgenson et al., 2008). The development of IT may also have an important impact on the labor market and changes in labor demand (Bresnahan et al., 2002). Jorgenson and Vu (2007) allocated the growth of world output between input growth and productivity and found that input growth greatly predominates and that IT investment was an important factor for capital deepening and productivity improvement after 1990s. Further, the contributions of IT investment to productivity are greater than that of physical capital. Basu and Fernald (2007) determined that IT capital is a special factor of production that differs from physical capital and human capital, and US data suggests that industry TFP acceleration is positively correlated with industrial IT capital growth, albeit with a long lag. Dimelis and Papaioannou (2010) indicated that the growth contribution of IT is quite high for both developed and developing countries, while this effect is greater among developing countries. Thus, they argued that IT investment provides a powerful incentive for developing countries to seek a more refined structure for their industrial economies.  \n\nOur study is also connected to the research on information and communication technology (ICT). ICT not only promotes the improvement of labor productivity (Ceccobelli et al., 2012; Martinez et al., 2010), but also spurs economic growth (Schreyer, 2000; Cardona et al., 2013). Many studies have analyzed the impact of ICT on productivity, labor markets, and structural change (Zuhdi et al., 2014; Akerman et al., 2015). Many relevant studies have discussed the effect of computer technology (Oliner et al., 1994; Jorgenson and Stiroh, 1995). With the vigorous development of the mobile internet, cloud computing, big data, and the internet of things (IoT), many studies have placed emphasis on the importance of emerging ICT (Caputo et al., 2016; Del Giudice, 2016; Khan et al., 2020). Hjort and Poulsen (2019) examined how African employment is affected by high-speed internet and found that high-speed internet can shift labor shares toward higher-productivity occupations.  \n\nThe existing research provides an important reference for this paper. Despite a revival of interest in estimating the drivers of structural labor change, there has been limited discussion of the new generation of IT. Previous research on IT and structural change has not identified any mechanisms to account for the link between the penetration of $\\mathrm{IT}$ progress to TFP and labor reallocation. This paper attempts to fill this gap in the literature by analyzing the quantitative importance of the new generation of IT in the changes in the labor structure.  \n\nOur contribution to the literature is twofold. First, we analyze the impacts of the new generation of IT on labor force reallocation across sectors directly and quantitatively. Our framework departs from existing models (Kongsamut et al., 2001; Ngai and Pissarides, 2007; Duarte and Restuccia, 2010) in assessing the penetration rate of the new generation of IT and in considering different production structures across sectors. Second, we sort out the different mechanisms that resulted in the structural labor change. We broaden the analysis to examine how the structural change is affected by technological progress.  \n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 puts forward the theoretical model and describes the key theoretical mechanisms. Section 3 calibrates a benchmark economy with Chinese data for the period between 1978 and 2018. Section 4 discusses the robustness of our model. Section 5 performs counterfactual exercises. Finally, Section6concludes.  \n\n## 2. The model  \n\nThis section starts with an analysis of the structural labor change under the background of the rapid development of the new generation of IT in the context of a general equilibrium model of the employment structural transformation driven by this new IT and previous old technology.  \n\nBased on the theoretical model of Duarte and Restuccia (2010), this paper introduces the variables of the new generation of $\\mathrm{IT}$ progress and the penetration rate of this new technology. Then, the model of structural labor change driven by the new generation of $\\mathrm{IT}$ is constructed. The theoretical model of this paper assumes that the economy consists of agriculture, industry, and services and that each sector produces only agricultural, industrial, and service products in each period. This basic framework captures the significant features of the structural changes that have occurred in China.  \n\n### 2.1.Production with the new generation of IT  \n\nSuppose that there are three goods produced in each period: agriculture (a), manufacturing $(m)$ , and services (s). The production function for each of the three goods is given by the following Cobb-Douglas pro  \n\nduction function with constant returns:  \n\n$$\nY_{i}=A^{\\gamma_{i}}A_{i}L_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}}K_{i}^{1-\\alpha_{i}},i\\in\\{a,m,s\\}\n$$  \n\nwhere $Y_{i}$ is output in sector $i,L_{i},K_{i}$ and $A_{i}$ are the labor and capital inputs, and the original “old technology” except for the new generation of IT in sector i. $\\alpha_{i}$ and $(1\\mathrm{~-~}\\alpha_{i})$ , respectively, represent the contribution of labor and capital to output. $A^{\\gamma_{i}}A_{i}$ is sectoral TFP, where $A$ is the new generation of $\\mathrm{IT}$ parameter, and $\\gamma_{i}$ is sector-specific new generation of IT penetration to sectoral TFP.  \n\nWe assume that the total supply of capital is fixed and exogenous. It is helpful for us to focus on the research and analysis of the labor structure change driven by technology, especially for the new generation of IT. The capital-intensive characteristics of different sectors are reflected by $\\alpha_{i}$ . Agriculture is land-intensive, manufacturing is capital-intensive, and services are human-capital-intensive.  \n\nWe assume that labor and capital are freely mobile across sectors and that factor prices $w$ and $r$ are given. The profit maximization problem of a representative firm can be illustrated by the following static problem:  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{max}_{L\\ge0,K\\ge0}{\\{p_{i}A^{\\gamma_{i}}A_{i}L_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}}K_{i}^{1-\\alpha_{i}}-w L_{i}-r K_{i}\\}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $p_{i}$ is the price of good i.  \n\nAs the key to our research is to analyze the impact of new and old technological changes on the adjustments in the labor structure of the three sectors, the following settings are made for technical factors:  \n\n#### 2.1.1. The new generation of $I T$  \n\nWe assume that the new generation of $\\mathrm{IT}$ progress follows the technology diffusion $^{\\circ}\\mathsf{S}^{\\prime}$ curve (Mansfield, 1961; Comin and Mestieri, 2014), whose general expression is as follows:  \n\n$$\nA(t)=A_{0}+\\frac{A^{*}-A_{0}}{1+e^{-\\mu(t-h)}}.\n$$  \n\n$A_{0}$ is the initial value of the new technological progress rate, $A^{*}$ is the upper limit of the new technological progress rate, $\\mu$ represents the curvature of the change trend of the technological growth rate, $h$ represents the time node of the change trend of the new technological progress rate from convex to concave. The reason for using an ${}^{6}{\\mathsf{S}}^{,}$ technology diffusion curve is that the development of new technology usually goes through a relatively gentle initial stage, a high-speed development stage, and a slow mature stage. Conversely, in the early stage of the development of new technology, it has a relatively limited role in promoting the TFP of the three sectors. This is because technological innovation and the transformation and upgrading of production systems are not perfectly matched with the new technology, and its contribution to output is relatively small. With the development of the relevant supporting infrastructure, the popularity of new technology in various sectors will increase rapidly. After reaching a certain degree, with the development of new technology gradually entering the bottleneck period, its contribution to output growth will also tend to be flat. Combining these two features, this paper uses equation (3) to describe the development of the new generation of IT.  \n\n#### 2.1.2. The old technology in each sector  \n\nAccording to the practice of most studies, we suppose the rate of technological progress is exogenous and constant. It is recorded as $\\mu_{i}$  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\dot{A_{i}}}{A_{i}}=\\mu_{i}.\n$$  \n\nWe also assume that $\\mu_{i}>0$ , that is, technological progress, will not stagnate.  \n\n### 2.2. Households  \n\nWe assume that the economy consists of an infinitely lived representative household of constant size. The household is endowed with $L$ units of time each period. Then, the representative household obtains utility from the consumption of agricultural products, $c_{a,t},$ and nonagricultural products, $c_{t}$ . The household obtains preferences over consumption goods as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{t=1}^{\\infty}\\beta^{t}u(c_{a,t},c_{t}),\\beta\\in(0,1)\n$$  \n\nThe per-period utility is given by the following:  \n\n$$\nu(c_{a,t},c_{t})=a\\log(c_{a,t}-\\overline{{a}})+(1-a)\\log(c_{t}),\n$$  \n\nwhere $a\\in(0,1)$ and $\\overline{{a}}>0$ is the subsistence level of agricultural goods below which the household cannot survive. This feature of household preferences can lead to the movement of labor away from agriculture in the process of structural transformation. Numerous studies have attached great importance to this feature of preferences, and it has been considered as a quantitatively significant feature that may lead to the shift of labor from the agricultural sector during the process of structural change (Kongsamut et al., 2001; Gollin et al., 2002). The consumptionweight, $a_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathrm{(}}$ .of agricultural products is generally small. It can be seen from equation (6) that the elasticity of substitution between agricultural and non-agricultural products is relatively low, that is, agricultural products cannot be replaced by other products.  \n\nThe consumption quantity of non-agricultural products, $c_{t}.$ canbe expressed as a constant elasticity of substitution utility function as follows:  \n\n$$\nc_{t}=[b c_{m,t}^{\\rho}+(1-b)(c_{s,t}+\\overline{{s}})^{\\rho}]^{\\frac{1}{\\rho}}\n$$  \n\n$c_{m,t}$ and $c_{s,t}$ represent the consumption of a representative household of industrial products and service products, respectively, $\\overline{{s}}>0$ is the fixed level of service products that households can provide, and $b\\in(0,1)$ $\\rho\\:<\\:1$ . In equation (7), $\\overline{{s}}>0$ means that the income elasticity of product demand for services is greater than one. When the household's income level is low, the number of production factors allocated to services is lower. On the contrary, when the household income level increases, more production factors will be allocated to services. The symbol $\\rho$ determines the substitutability between industrial and service products. When $0~<~\\rho~<~1$ , the substitutability between industrial and service products is greater, when $\\rho~<~0$ , the substitutability between the two is lower. When the prices of the three industrial products are given, households can maximize their utility by choosing a consumption portfolio consisting of different products.  \n\nIn each period, the household chooses the consumption of each product to maximize its per-period utility, subject to a standard budget constraint.Formally,  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{max}_{c_{i}\\ge0}\\left\\{a\\log(c_{a,t}-\\overline{{a}})+(1-a)\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\log[b c_{m}^{\\rho}+(1-b)(c_{s}+\\overline{{s}})^{\\rho}]\\right\\},\n$$  \n\nsubject to  \n\n$$\np_{a}c_{a}+p_{m}c_{m}+p_{s}c_{s}=w L+r(K_{a}+K_{m}+K_{s}),\n$$  \n\n### 2.3. Market clearing  \n\nMarket clearing for labor requires that  \n\n$$\nL_{a}+L_{m}+L_{s}=L\n$$  \n\nThe market for each good produced must clear the following:  \n\n$$\nc_{a}=Y_{a};c_{m}=Y_{m};c_{s}=Y_{s}.\n$$  \n\n### 2.4.Economic equilibrium  \n\nA competitive equilibrium is defined in the usual manner; the sectoral factor demand, $\\{L_{a},L_{m},L_{s}\\}$ that maximize profits (2) given the price of goods $\\{p_{a},p_{m},p_{s}\\}$ ; households solve a utility maximization problem (8) by choosing the optimal consumption portfolio $\\{c_{a},c_{m},c_{s}\\}$ Since the markets must clear, (10)-(11) holds.  \n\nFor the profit maximization problem of firms, the marginal revenue of a firm is equal to their marginal cost, which implies that the demand of labor and capital satisfies the following:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha_{i}K_{i}}{w}=\\frac{(1-\\alpha_{i})L_{i}}{r}.\n$$  \n\nThen, the firm's problem can be reduced to the following:  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{max}_{L_{i}\\ge0}\\left\\{p_{i}A^{\\gamma_{i}}\\overline{{A}}_{i}L_{i}-\\frac{w}{\\alpha_{i}}L_{i}\\right\\},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\begin{array}{r}{\\overline{{A}}_{i}=(\\frac{1-\\alpha_{i}}{\\alpha_{i}}\\frac{w}{r})^{1-\\alpha_{i}}A_{i};}\\end{array}$ . which can be seen as the revised old technology productivity. Thus, the price of good $i$ is inversely related to the new generation of $\\mathrm{IT}A$  \n\n$$\np_{i}=\\frac{w}{\\alpha_{i}A^{\\gamma_{i}}\\overline{{A}}_{i}}\n$$  \n\nFor a household, the optimal consumption for each product satisfies the following:  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{a}{(c_{a}-\\overline{{a}})p_{a}}}={\\frac{(1-a)b c_{m}^{\\rho-1}}{[b c_{m}^{\\rho}+(1-b)(c_{s}+\\overline{{s}})^{\\rho}]p_{m}}}={\\frac{(1-a)(1-b)(c_{s}+\\overline{{s}})^{\\rho-1}}{[b c_{m}^{\\rho}+(1-b)(c_{s}+\\overline{{s}})^{\\rho}]p_{s}}}\n$$  \n\nBecause $\\begin{array}{r}{p_{i}c_{i}=\\frac{w}{\\alpha_{i}}L_{i}}\\end{array}$ , and it combined with equations (14) and (15) and the market-clearing conditions, the labor structure of the three sectors must meet the following requirements:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle\\frac{(1-a)\\alpha_{s}}{a\\alpha_{a}}L_{a}-\\frac{\\alpha_{s}}{\\alpha_{m}}L_{m}-L_{s}=\\frac{(1-a)\\alpha_{s}\\overline{{{a}}}}{a\\alpha_{a}\\overline{{{A}}}_{a}A\\gamma_{a}}+\\frac{\\overline{{{s}}}}{\\overline{{{A}}}_{s}A\\gamma_{s}}}}\\ {{\\displaystyle\\left(\\frac{b}{1-b}\\frac{\\alpha_{m}}{\\alpha_{s}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\rho-1}}\\left(\\frac{\\overline{{{A}}}_{s}A\\gamma_{s}}{\\overline{{{A}}}_{m}A\\gamma_{m}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\rho}{(1-\\rho)}}L_{m}-L_{s}=\\frac{\\overline{{{s}}}}{\\overline{{{A}}}_{s}A\\gamma_{s}},}}\\ {{L_{a}+L_{m}+L_{s}=L}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nNotice that equations (16)-(18) are linear. After dividing both sides of the three equations by $L$ at the same time, the expression for the labor share of each sector can be obtained. In this paper, $L_{a},L_{m},$ and $L_{s}$ are still used to denote the labor share of each of the three sectors. Thus,  \n\n$$\nL_{a}+L_{m}+L_{s}=1\n$$  \n\nTo obtain a simplified expression of the labor share in the three sectors, this paper further assumes that $\\alpha_{m}~=~\\alpha_{s}$ (this assumption will be relaxed in the part of the model robustness discussion). Set $\\begin{array}{r}{a^{\\ast}=\\frac{a\\alpha_{a}}{(1-a)\\alpha_{s}+a\\alpha_{a}}}\\end{array}$ which is the labor share limit o agriculture when the technological level develops to a certain extent. Let = (b α: $\\begin{array}{r}{\\kappa=(\\frac{b}{1-b}\\frac{\\alpha_{m}}{\\alpha_{s}})^{\\frac{1}{\\rho-1}}}\\end{array}$ which is a constant determined by the labor input elasticity and product substitution elasticity of industry and services. Then, $\\begin{array}{r}{D(t)=\\frac{\\overline{{A}}_{s}A^{\\gamma_{s}}}{\\overline{{A}}_{m}A^{\\gamma_{m}}}=}\\end{array}$ $\\begin{array}{r}{e^{(\\mu_{s}-\\mu_{m})t}(\\frac{1+A^{*}e^{\\mu(t-h)}}{1+e^{\\mu(t-h)}})^{\\gamma_{s}-\\gamma_{m}}}\\end{array}$ industry. Under these conditions, the labor share of the three sectors can be obtained by solving equations (16), (17) and (19):  \n\n$$\n{\\cal L}_{a}=a^{*}+\\frac{(1-a^{*}\\overline{{{a}}})}{\\overline{{{A}}}_{a}A^{\\gamma_{a}}}+\\frac{a^{*}\\overline{{{s}}}}{\\overline{{{A}}}_{s}A^{\\gamma_{s}}}\n$$  \n\n$$\nL_{m}=\\frac{\\left(1-a^{*}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\overline{{s}}}{\\overline{{A}}_{s}A^{\\gamma_{s}}}-\\frac{\\overline{{a}}}{\\overline{{A}}_{a}A^{\\gamma_{s}}}+1\\right)}{1+\\kappa D^{\\frac{\\rho}{\\left(1-\\rho\\right)}}}\n$$  \n\n$$\nL_{s}=1-L_{a}-L_{m}\n$$  \n\nWe can see from equations (20)-(22) that there are various drivers in the model that result in the structural labor change, including: (a) the non-homothetic preference (income effect) reflected in $\\overline{{a}}$ and s; (b) the differential TFP growth rates across sectors reflected in $\\mu_{i};$ and (c) the sector-specific reliance on $\\mathrm{IT}$ reflected in $\\gamma_{i}$ . We distinguish and compare the role of these different drivers in our counterfactual analysis.  \n\n### 2.5. The impact of new and old technology on the equilibrium solution of thelaborstructure  \n\nOver time, with the development of new and old technology, the share of labor in agriculture will reduce substantially, that is, with the technological improvement, the labor resources of agriculture will be transferred into services and industry. When time t tends to infinity, the technological level $\\overline{{{A}}}_{a}A^{\\gamma_{a}}$ and $\\overline{{A}}_{s}\\dot{A}^{\\gamma_{s}}$ also tend to infinity, and the share of labor in agriculture converges to $a^{*}$ over the long run by (20). Similar to Kongsamut et al. (2001), the non-homotheticity of preference over agriculture and service goods $(\\overline{{a}},\\overline{{s}}>0)$ leads to labor moving away from agriculture in the process of structural change.  \n\nThe changes in the labor reallocation in industry are relatively complex. The technological progress rate of agriculture is generally the fastest (Young, 2003; Cao and Birchenall, 2013), so the molecular part of equation (21) tends to show a decreasing trend. The change in the denominator of equation (21) depends on the ratio $D$ of the TFP of industry and services and the substitution elasticity $\\rho$ between industrial and service products. In the early stage of technological progress, the ratio changes relatively slowly, so the labor share in industry will increase during the early stage. As time goes on, $D(t)^{\\frac{\\rho}{1-\\rho}}$ tends to infinity if $({\\mu}_{s}-{\\mu}_{m}){\\rho}>0;$ 1 and there exists time $t^{*}$ , when $t~>~t^{*}$ ， $L_{m}$ decreases. The movement of the labor share when $t~>~t^{*}$ is very similar to Proposition 2 in Ngai and Pissarides (2007), which indicates that a high elasticity of substitution across manufacturing and service goods $(0~<~\\rho~<~1)$ leads to shifts in the employment shares of sectors with high TFP growth $(\\mu_{s}>\\mu_{m})$  \n\nAlong the sectoral technology development process, the share of labor in services will increase constantly. The “crowding-out effect\" of new and old technological progress on the labor resources of agriculture and the lower labor share of services during the early stage may make its ability to absorb labor resources stronger than that of industry. However, aftertime $t^{*}$ , the development of new technology will produce a \"crowding-out effect\" on the labor of agriculture and industry simultaneously, and the labor share of services will continue to grow.  \n\n## 3. Data  \n\nConsidering that 1978-2018 is the key period in China's economic transformation and development since the reform and opening-up process, this paper will calibrate the parameters of the theoretical model according to this period to verify the theoretical analysis.  \n\n### 3.1. Data source  \n\nFor our analysis, we calibrate the benchmark economy to Chinese labor market data from 1978 to 2018. The share of labor is calculated by using the number of employees of three sectors in China (at the end of the year). The data are drawn from the China Statistical Yearbook.  \n\nWe need to make clear and definite the development trend and level of the new generation of IT. We also need to select parameter values for $a^{*},\\overline{{a}},\\overline{{s}},\\kappa$ and the parameter values that related to the technical level, $\\mu_{a},\\mu_{s},\\gamma_{a},\\gamma_{s},\\mu_{d i f}$ and $\\gamma_{d i f}$  \n\n### 3.2. “S” technology diffusion curve  \n\nWe refer to the features of the new generation of IT industry in China and then deduce the value of relevant parameters through the realworld situation of China's industrial development. We can deduce the evolutionary track of the new generation of IT. We verify these parameter assumptions by fitting the benchmark model to the real-world situation in China.  \n\nFirst, we normalize the new generation of IT levels across sectors to one in 1978. Based on the $^{\\circ}\\mathsf{S}\\prime\\prime$ technology diffusion curve proposed by Mansfield (1961), the relevant research results and the existing literature on the new generation of $\\mathrm{IT}$ ,this paper uses equation (3) to describe the new generation of IT A(t). The initial value $A_{0}$ is standardized to 1, the curvature of the change trend of the technology progress growth rate is set to 0.25, that is, $\\mu~=~0.25$ ,the time node of the change trend of the new technology progress growth rate from convex to concave is set as 2020, i.e., $h=2020$ , the time to popularize 5G in China, which can be regarded as an inflection point due to Shannon's law.2 The limit value of the new generation of IT $A^{*}$ is set to 4. Under the above assumptions, the development trend of the new generation of IT is shown in Fig. 2.  \n\nWe can see from Fig. 2 that the new generation of IT was approximately to one before 20oo. It can be considered that the development level of the new generation of IT before 2000 was low and had not been applied to all walks of life, so it had little impact on social and economic activities. The development of the new technology emerged in 2000 and was in the primary stage from 2000 to 2010. It entered a period of high-speed development around 2010, the time to popularize 4G in China. The technological level in 2020 is approximately 2.5, which is more than twice as high as that $1.2\\mathrm{in}2010$ 3 This is also in line with the development trend of the new generation of IT represented by big data, artificial intelligence, mobile internet, etc. Especially in recent years, the development of the new generation of IT has been widely concerned and valued by the international community and the corresponding policy support; the supporting scientific and technological innovation achievements have been increasing. At the same time, the development of this new IT and the benefits brought by its application also have great attraction to the manufacturers, so that it can be promoted and applied in a wider range, then it can develop rapidly in recentyears.  \n\nWe assume that the development of the new generation of IT in China may enter a bottleneck period around 2040, thus changing from “new technology” to “old technology.\" According to the hypothesis of the model, the “old technology” will develop at a constant rate without stagnation, which means that in 20 years, the progress rate of the new generation of IT may be very small but greater than zero, and the new generation of IT will show a slow development trend, but not a complete stop, it may show a steady state of development.  \n\n### 3.3.Parameter calibration  \n\nIn this model, the parameter values need to be calibrated are: $a^{*}$ ， ${\\overline{{a}}},$ $\\overline{{s}},\\kappa$ and the parameters that related to the technical level, $\\mu_{a},\\mu_{s}$ ， $\\gamma_{a},\\gamma_{s}$ ， and $\\mu_{d i f}~=~[(\\mu_{s}~-~\\mu_{m})\\rho]/(1~-~\\rho)$ and $\\gamma_{d i f}=[(\\gamma_{s}-\\gamma_{m})\\rho]/(1-\\rho);$ which can represent the technical level differences. The principle of model parameter calibration is to select the parameter value to make our model match the salient features of the structural labor change for China during the period from 1978 to 2018 well.  \n\n![](images/dc33ae6fe8cbb3c577ff22940d3f86575b023b82abbd882e3938d71d543af9b6.jpg)  \nFig. 2. Development trend of the new technology level.  \n\nFirst, the parameters $a^{*},\\overline{{a}},\\overline{{s}},$ and $\\kappa$ are set as follows. Relevant research shows that one of the signs of social development entering the post industrialization stage in China is that the proportion of employment in agriculture is less than $10\\%$ .Because the share of labor in agriculture has been falling systematically and considering that the population base in China is large and the proportion of rural population is high, we assume a long run labor share of $a^{*}=5\\%$ . Like the practice of Duarte and Restuccia (2010),  is chosen to match the labor share of services in the early stage (1958), so we can obtain $ \\overline{{s}}=0.1218$ .Since the technical level of all sectors in the early stage is standardized to 1, a and $\\kappa$ are jointly selected to match as close as possible the share of labor in three sectors over time, and then make the labor structure of the three sectors determined by equations (20) and (21) consistent with the employment structure in the early stage. Thus, $\\overline{{a}}=0.6590$ $\\kappa=1.4079$ can be obtained.  \n\nFor the technological progress rate of old technology, $\\mu_{a},\\mu_{s}$ and the difference between the technological progress rate of industry and services corrected by the elasticity of substitution between products, $\\mu_{d i f}$ , using the actual labor share data of the three sectors from 1978 to 2000 for fitting and calibration, we can determine that $\\mu_{a}=0.018$ $\\mu_{s}~=~0.015$ , and $\\mu_{d i f}~=~0.004$ . Then, the technological penetration rate of the new generation of $\\Pi\\gamma_{a}$ $\\gamma_{s}$ and the difference in the technological permeability between industry and services is corrected by product substitution elasticity, $\\gamma_{d i f}$ , using data from the actual labor structure of the three sectors from 2000 to 2018. The results show that $\\gamma_{a}~=~0.55$ ， $\\gamma_{s}~=~0.84$ , and $\\gamma_{d i f}~=~0.126$  \n\nBecause agriculture is land-intensive, industry is capital-intensive, and service is human-capital-intensive, the contribution of the new generation of IT among the three sectors differs (Bartel et al., 2007; Helm,2020; Gillman, 2021). The development of IT has liberated some parts of the agricultural labor force, but the agricultural sector is landintensive and highly dependent on land resources. Factors such as the state, endowment, mode, and relevant policies and systems of land use will also restrict and guide the direction of regional industrial development and structural adjustment. The traditional advantages of laborintensive industries are gradually weakened, and the degree of labor agglomeration has decreased. Thus, the industry has gradually completed the transformation of old and new technologies, invested a lot of capital to upgrade equipment, and replaced manpower with machines. Thefact that $\\gamma_{s}$ is the highest means that the new generation of IT has the fastest development and widest range of application in the services sector. The application of the new generation of IT in services mainly takes place through a combination of knowledge, learning, and innovation of human capital to better enable the new technology to play its role, promote the transformation of innovative achievements, and provide intelligent services for daily production and life. Because the new industry is assumed to have a relatively higher human capital factor share, as human capital deepening occurs, labor shifts toward the new industry and away from traditional industries (Gillman, 2021). However, because industry and agriculture are capital-intensive and landintensive, respectively, the combination of the new generation of IT and the two sectors is relatively weak (Bartel et al., 2007; Helm, 2020). This shows that the contribution of the new generation of IT to these two sectors is also relatively low. From the results of parameter calibration, the technological progress rate for agriculture is the highest from 1978 to 2000, which is consistent with the conclusions of existing research. Fan and Zhang (2002) estimated that the TFP of agriculture from 1979 to 1997 was about 0.033; the numerical difference is due to different estimation methods and different sample periods.  \n\nWe now list the parameters of the model in Table 1.  \n\nThe shares of labor implied by the model are reported in Fig. 3, together with data on the shares of labor in China. The equilibrium allocation of labor across sectors in the model closely matches the process of structural labor change in China during the calibrated period. This means that the benchmark model established in this paper can better describe the typical characteristics of China's structural labor change.  \n\n### 3.4. Results analysis  \n\nBefore 2010, the new generation of IT is in the primary stage of development. From 2010, IT has developed vigorously and has been widely promoted and applied. Accordingly, it can be seen from Fig. 3 that in recent years the share of labor has also changed significantly, specifically, the share of labor in agriculture has been declining rapidly, and the share of labor in services has been increasing significantly. This is in accordance with the development trend of China's new generation of IT and the process of the transformation of labor structure across sectors.  \n\nFor agriculture, as Engel's law tests, with the rapid development of China's economy and the improvement of residents’ income level, the proportion of food consumption is declining, which has been confirmed in relevant statistical studies. The demand of households for agricultural products is relatively stable, while the original technological progress rate of agriculture is higher than that of industry and services. Under the condition that output (demand) is relatively constant, technological progress will promote the reallocation of labor in agriculture to industry and services, resulting in a stable downward trend of the labor share in agriculture in a ladder form from 1978 to 2000. After 2000, especially after 2010, the increased penetration of the new generation of IT, such as big data, artificial intelligence, and mobile internet, into traditional agriculture has greatly promoted automation, scale, and intelligent production and greatly improved the TFP of agriculture. Therefore the \"substitution effect\" generated by technological progress has become increasingly obvious. After 2010, the decline in the labor share in agriculture compared to the previous period is obviously faster, and many labor resources are transferred into industry and services.  \n\nTable 1 Parameter values and China's data targets.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Parameter</td><td>Value</td><td>Target</td></tr><tr><td>Ao</td><td>1</td><td>Normalization</td></tr><tr><td>μ</td><td>0.25</td><td>Thecurvatureofthenewtechnologyprogresschange</td></tr><tr><td>h</td><td>2020</td><td>The timenodeof thechange from convexto concaveformat</td></tr><tr><td>A*</td><td>4</td><td>Thelimitvalueof thenewtechnology</td></tr><tr><td>a*</td><td>5%</td><td>Thelimitvalue ofthelaborin agriculture</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.6590</td><td>Approximate share of laborin agriculture,1958</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.1218</td><td>Shareoflaborinservices,1958</td></tr><tr><td>K</td><td>1.4079</td><td>Constant</td></tr><tr><td>μa</td><td>0.018</td><td>The old technological progress ratein agriculture</td></tr><tr><td>μs</td><td>0.015</td><td>The old technologicalprogressrateinservices</td></tr><tr><td>μdif</td><td>0.004</td><td>Therevisedoldtechnologicalprogressrate</td></tr><tr><td>Ya</td><td>0.55</td><td>Thepenetrationrateofnewtechnologyinagriculture</td></tr><tr><td>Ys</td><td>0.84</td><td>Thepenetrationrateofnewtechnologyinservices</td></tr><tr><td>Ydif</td><td>0.126</td><td>The revised penetration rate of new technology</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n![](images/508bf18791b713f51cc08126bd894085567a3a8456d23805666f353f3f880afa.jpg)  \nFig. 3. Time path of the labor share change in the Benchmark Model vs. China's Data.  \n\nFor industry and services, the fast development and wide application of the new generation of IT will reduce the price of products (see equation (14)). After the consumption of agricultural products to meet the basic needs of the household and the decline in the prices of industrial and service products, the demand of households for these products will increase. Then, the demand for labor by industry and services will also increase, resulting in an upward trend in the labor share of industry and services. The reallocation of the labor resources absorbed by industry and services depends mainly on the ratio of the penetration rate of the new generation of IT in services and industry. When the penetration rate of the new generation of IT to services is higher, the demand for labor in services is also relatively higher. In addition, with the rapid development of the new generation of IT, the proportion of household consumption for industrial and service products will also change, and service products will continue to replace industrial products. This is evidenced by the emergence of the third-party service platforms for shared bicycles and shared automobiles; the demand for industrial products such as automobiles gradually shifts to platforms based on big data and the internet, and the increase in the demand for service products becomes greater, which shows that, in recent years, the share of labor in services has increased rapidly, while the share of labor in industry has increased slowly.  \n\n## 4. Discussion on robustness  \n\nWe now turn to an analysis intended to assess the robustness of the model along two key dimensions. It is useful to provide the punchline first: the model results are robust, and the test results of the evidence vary little. We focus on two sets of considerations: labor market distortions and structural production differences. In the benchmark model, some assumptions are not consistent with the reality of China's economy. For example, our model abstracts from the labor flow barrier between different sectors, so we assume that wages in the three sectors are the same. In fact, the average wage of labor in industry and services is much higher than that in agriculture. In the benchmark model, to obtain the expression of the labor share of the three sectors in a simple form, this paper assumes that the elasticity of labor input to the output of industry and services is equal, that is, that $\\alpha_{m}~=~\\alpha_{s}$ .This section attempts to relax these assumptions and compares the numerical simulation results with the benchmark model results.  \n\n### 4.1.Labor market distortions  \n\nWe first explore the robustness of the model by altering the wages among different sectors. Considering that China, as the largest developing country, has practical factors such as an imperfect labor market system and market distortions, which will lower the labor wage level in agriculture, the reallocation cost of labor from agriculture to nonagricultural sectors may increase due to the existence of labor flow barriers or market distortions. Therefore, this paper uses the labor wage ratio, $\\theta$ ，of agricultural and non-agricultural sectors to describe the increased flow cost. If the wage in industry and services is equal, which is recorded as $w_{\\cdot}$ the wage in agriculture is $(1-\\theta)w$ . In this case, it is only necessary to replace $\\alpha_{a}$ with $\\alpha_{a}^{\\prime}=\\alpha/(1-\\theta)$ in the above model. In the new numerical simulation experiment, setting $\\theta~=~0.25$ ,when $\\alpha_{a}=0.6$ and $\\alpha_{s}=0.4$ , we can obtain $\\alpha_{a}^{\\prime}=0.8$ , and $a^{*}$ is from 0.05 to 0.095. The increasing of $\\alpha_{a}^{\\prime}$ and $a^{*}$ is also due to labor flow barriers or market distortions. Since the labor mobility cost in agriculture explains the existence of labor mobility barriers, the labor resources among the three sectors do not flow easily. It can be found that the wage distortion of agriculture only changes its ultimate labor share, while other parameters remain unchanged. Table 2 summarizes the changes in the share of labor when wage differences are considered. Similar treatment can be done for the capital distortion of agriculture by changing the value of $a^{*}$ accordingly.  \n\nTable 2 presents the evidence, reporting the results in terms of the effect of different sectoral wages. Considering labor market distortions in the three sectors, there is much less reallocation of labor away from agriculture into services than in the benchmark model. However, if we increase the penetration rate of new technology in agriculture, $\\gamma_{a}$ from 0.55 to 0.80, the model performs well. Thus, the benchmark model will underestimate the sector-specific penetration of new technology if we consider market distortions. The overall trend of structural labor change after considering wage differences is not that significant, that is, the results still match the general trend in China's labor share change, which indicates that the simulation results of the benchmark model are stable and reliable.  \n\n### 4.2. Structural production differences  \n\nWe then assess the robustness of the model to considering different production structures. In the classical literature on the impact of technology progress on economic growth and structural change, most of them assume that the labor and capital input structure in the production functions of the three sectors are the same, except for the different technological progress rates (Kongsamut et al., 2001; Ngai and Pissarides, 2007; Duarte and Restuccia, 2010). Based on the benchmark model, this assumption has been relaxed. To obtain a relatively simple explicit expression of the labor share, we assume $\\alpha_{m}~=~\\alpha_{s}$ in the benchmark model, that is, that the input structure of factors in industry and services is the same, and that the factor input structure in agriculture differs from that of industry and services. To further discuss the robustness of the benchmark model, we change this assumption in the new numerical experiment and assume that the contribution rate of labor factors to the output in services is greater than that in industry.  \n\nTable3 Counterfactual experiment design.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Experimentalgroup</td><td>Specificscenariosetting</td></tr><tr><td>Thefirst group</td><td>Thenon-homotheticpreferenceis ignored(a==0)</td></tr><tr><td>The second group</td><td>1.Absence of thepenetration of newgeneration of IT (y; = 0) 2.The progress rate of old technology in three sec- torsincreaseby50%</td></tr><tr><td>Thethirdgroup</td><td>1.Absenceof newgeneration of ITdevelopment 2.The rate of change of new generation IT is dou- bled (μ = 0.5) 3.Double thelimitvalue ofprogress ratefor the new IT (A* = 8) 4.Thepenetrationrateof newtechnologyinthree sectorsincreasesby200%</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThen, we set $\\frac{\\alpha_{m}}{\\alpha_{s}}=0.8$ all else being equal. The summary statistics are documented in Table 2.  \n\nAs the last three columns of Table 2 show, the time path of the structural labor change after considering the adjustment in the production structure is highly consistent with the results of the benchmark model. That is, there is no significant change in labor reallocation, which shows that the difference in the factor input structure in the production function does not have a great impact on the change in the labor structure and further verifies that the benchmark model is very robust.  \n\nThe benchmark model established in this paper matches the actual time path of China's change of labor shares in three sectors, while the robustness testing of the benchmark model shows that labor market distortions and structural production differences have little impact on structural labor change. It also shows that the model constructed in this paper has high applicability.  \n\n## 5. Analysis of counterfactual experiments  \n\nFollowing Rogerson (2008) and Duarte and Restuccia (2010), labor reallocation across sectors is driven by two mechanisms: income effects due to non-homothetic preferences and substitution effects due to differential productivity growth across sectors. In this section, we perform a series of counterfactuals (see Table 3) to distinguish and compare various drivers in the model that result in the structural labor change and assess the quantitative effect of the fast development and wide application of the new generation of IT such as big data and artificial intelligence on structural labor transformation. The most important question of this paper is to answer whether the new generation of IT can optimize the structure of China's labor markets and through what channels can it play this role, as well as how much it will affect the transformation and upgrading of the labor structure. Therefore, we design and perform the following two sets of counterfactuals to discuss and answer the preceding questions.  \n\nTo fully understand the driving factors underlying the labor structure adjustment, we first distinguish and compare various drivers in the model that result in the structural labor change and then test and analyze the role of the different mechanisms of the new generation of IT progress.  \n\nTable 2 Comparison of labor share changes.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"3\">Benchmarkmodel</td><td colspan=\"3\">Distortionofwage(0=0.25)</td><td colspan=\"3\">Productionfunction difference(am/as=O.8)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Ag.</td><td>Ind.</td><td>Svc.</td><td>Ag.</td><td>Ind.</td><td>Svc.</td><td>Ag.</td><td>Ind.</td><td>Svc.</td></tr><tr><td>1980</td><td>0.682</td><td>0.180</td><td>0.138</td><td>0.683</td><td>0.180</td><td>0.137</td><td>0.683</td><td>0.180</td><td>0.137</td></tr><tr><td>1990</td><td>0.578</td><td>0.212</td><td>0.210</td><td>0.586</td><td>0.209</td><td>0.205</td><td>0.579</td><td>0.211</td><td>0.210</td></tr><tr><td>2000</td><td>0.487</td><td>0.237</td><td>0.276</td><td>0.501</td><td>0.231</td><td>0.268</td><td>0.488</td><td>0.236</td><td>0.276</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>0.379</td><td>0.260</td><td>0.361</td><td>0.401</td><td>0.251</td><td>0.348</td><td>0.381</td><td>0.259</td><td>0.360</td></tr><tr><td>2020</td><td>0.236</td><td>0.277</td><td>0.487</td><td>0.267</td><td>0.266</td><td>0.467</td><td>0.237</td><td>0.277</td><td>0.486</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n![](images/8e3c56b129fd1a9bb399a94d046d6631796eba6c5afe9433c295dbac1b51c7cf.jpg)  \nFig. 4. Time path of labor share change when the non-homothetic preference is ignored.  \n\n### 5.1. The role of non-homothetic preferences  \n\nIt can be seen from our theoretical model that the feature of preference can lead to the movement of labor away from agriculture in the process of structural transformation. This is also verified by many related studies (Kongsamut et al., 2001; Gollin et al., 2002). The results of the counterfactual experiment in which the non-homothetic preference is ignored, all else being equal, are depicted in Fig. 4.  \n\nAs can be seen in Fig. 4, in the absence of a non-homothetic preference, the labor share in agriculture will remain flat. From Fig. 4 we can see that the non-homothetic preference is an important driver in structural labor change and that it also tests the role of the income effect, which is in accordance with our theoretical model.  \n\n### 5.2. The role of old technological progress  \n\nTFP differences across sectors have been seen as an important driver promoting structural change (Ngai and Pissarides, 2007; Acemoglu and Guerrieri, 2008; Mao and Yao, 2012). Although we focus more on the important role of the new generation of IT, old technology progress should not be ignored. In this subsection, we aim to illustrate the role of old technology progress using comparative analysis. We show the results of two different scenarios in Figs. 5 and 6.  \n\nIt can be seen in Fig. 5 that when there is no penetration of the new generation of IT, the labor reallocation will still progress, but the variation in the labor share will be relatively small.  \n\nThe trend displayed in Fig. 6 shows that when the progress rate of old technology in the three sectors increase by $50\\%$ ,and allelse equal, the variation in the labor share is significant. Compared to Fig. 6, we can conclude that structural change will still go on with the old technology progress.  \n\n### 5.3. The role of the new generation of IT in structural labor change  \n\nIn this subsection, we proceed as follows. First, we assume that the technical level of the new generation of IT after 2oo0 is always one, that is, that there is no development of the new generation of IT and that technology remains constant at its 2oo0 level. In this scenario, the time path of the change of labor share can still be obtained and compared to the shares in the benchmark model. Through this experiment, we can see how the rapid development and application of the new generation of IT affects the adjustment of the labor structure. Second, under the condition that new technology develops faster or is adopted more widely by adjusting the limit value of the new generation of IT development, the change rate of technological progress and the penetration rate of the new generation of IT in the three sectors, the paper compares the change in the labor shares with that of the benchmark model under the three scenarios to illustrate the extent and impact the new generation of IT progress will have on the transformation of the labor structure.  \n\n#### 5.3.1. Absence of a new generation of IT development  \n\nWith the estimated parameters, we first quantify the effect of the new generation of IT on structural labor adjustment. We consider a counterfactual scenario in which emerging IT is kept constant at its 2000 level, and all else remains equal. This experiment attempts to determine the impact of this technology on the adjustment of labor shares across the three sectors preliminarily. Since the new generation of IT is not considered before 2ooo in the benchmark model,for the convenience of comparative analysis, the sample period of this experiment is set as 2000-2018. The comparison between the time path of structural labor change and the shares in the benchmark model are shown in Fig. 7.  \n\nFig. 7 reports the equilibrium implications of this counterfactual scenario. Significantly, with no rapid development and wide application of the new generation of IT, the result implies less changes in the labor shares across sectors. The share of labor in agriculture is still declining, and the share in services is still increasing, but the change degree is relatively small. The characteristics of structural labor transformation and upgrading are not significant enough in this counterfactual. In the hypothesis of the absence of emerging technological progress, there is no significant change in industrial production activity, so it has little impact on the labor structure. The benchmark model may capture the rapid decline in the labor share in agriculture and the rapid increase in the labor share in services under the IT revolution, which is close tothe actualcharacteristics of structurallabor transformation and may match the real-world situation of China's labor reallocation across sectors. Therefore, we may infer that the rapid development and wide application of the new generation of IT will speed up the process of China's structural labor adjustment.  \n\nIt can also be seen from Fig. 7 that the labor outflow from agriculture caused by the substitution effect of the new generation of IT on jobs is mostly absorbed by the rapid development of services, and a possible reason for this is that the new generation of $\\mathrm{IT}$ develops quickly and the wide application of new technology may also indirectly create new jobs. Then, labor becomes mainly concentrated in services.  \n\n![](images/7500d173c748298071228f2f1c52f17b1ba31e7ec38e982b22bed265630fbf3d.jpg)  \nFig. 5. Time path of labor share change when there is no penetration of the new generation of IT.  \n\n![](images/b24d995c2762867d41552f93a244b3d92f04fe3e64a4618b22d3b137077e7df3.jpg)  \nFig. 6. Time path of labor share change when the progress rate of old technology in the three sectors is increase  \n\nThis counterfactual exercise is only suggestive of the possible implications of emerging IT development. Since the development of new generationof $\\mathrm{IT}$ is endogenous to changes in sectoral labor productivity and to changes in sectoral inputs, a model of these endogenous developments is needed to assess the counterfactual situation in terms of labor reallocation. In the next subsection, we do just that.  \n\n#### 5.3.2.Scenario analysis based on the faster development of the new generationof $I T$  \n\nTo significantly compare the time path of labor share change in the numerical simulation experiments with that in the benchmark model, the time span is extended, and the sample period is 2000-2050.  \n\nFirst, this paper examines the situation of the acceleration of the rate of change of the new generation of $\\mathrm{IT}$ progress. Assuming that the rate of technology change is doubled, $\\mu=0.5$ , and all else being equal, the time path of labor share change between 2000 and 2050 and that in the benchmark model is shown in Fig. 8.  \n\nAs can be seen from Fig. 8,assuming that the new generation of IT develops faster, the shares of labor change relatively slowly before 2015, but after 2015, change rapidly, which is consistent with the changes in the benchmark model after 2025. This may be because during the early stage of new technology development, many advantages have not been shown, and the scope of the promotion and application is not wide enough. In addition, in the early stage of technological development, the technological progress of enterprises depends mostly on the model of “imitation innovation,” that is, learning advanced technology from others and constantly adjusting and adapting to conditions. In the early stage of technological progress, industrial development is relatively backward, so it is difficult for the new generation of IT to be better integrated with industry and play its role. Then, emerging technology cannot bring significant changes to industrial production activities and labor markets. In recent years, the infrastructure conditions of technological development have been continuously improved and optimized. At the same time, with the support of relevant policy, innovation, industrial structure optimization, and economic transformation, it has had a relatively significant impact on industrial production activities. Therefore, the acceleration of the new generation of IT progress has a lagged effect in the short term, and after a period, it has an obvious effect on the adjustment of labor structure. However, in the long run, its impact on the adjustment of the labor share is not significantly different from that of the benchmark model.  \n\n![](images/a2190909ea00b7b50ac79ffd531a37bc899842333ebd30bf320ebe73633dc909.jpg)  \nFig. 7. Time path of labor share change when there is no development of new generation of IT.  \n\n![](images/7a2e4f4521ac77dc8a629bef5d3d01392c3fd400070b0cd497ebe8386c7bb3c8.jpg)  \nFig. 8. Time path of labor share change when the development of the new generation of IT is accelerated.  \n\nSecond, considering that the international community is paying increasing attention to new technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, and the mobile internet and under the background of globalization, emerging technologies are introduced and learned from each other and the degree of international cooperation is deepening. At the same time, the innovation potential inspired by competition is increasing, so the space of the development and progress of emerging IT can also expand. Suppose that the progress space of the new generation of IT is improved and the limit value of technology development is doubled; that is, we set $A^{*}=8$ , and all else remains equal. Fig. 9 compares the time path of the change in the labor shares in the three sectors in 2000-2050 with that of the benchmark model.  \n\nFig. 9 plots the comparison between the benchmark model and the counterfactual. When the new generation of IT has greater potential for growth, the speed and extent of the decline in the labor share in agriculture and the increase in the labor share in services will be faster and greater. Moreover, in the scenario simulation with larger space of technology progress, the intersection time of the share of labor in agriculture and services will be earlier, and the inflection point of the labor share in industry will be earlier. This also indicates that under the background of more space for the progress of emerging IT, the speed of labor redistribution among industries will be accelerated. Even in the long run, the role of the new generation of IT in promoting the adjustment of labor structure is still significant.  \n\nThe previous counterfactual experiments set the new level of IT in terms of technology progress speed and technology progress space. We end this set of counterfactuals by assuming that the penetration rate of the new generation of IT in various sectors increases by $20\\%$ ， $50\\%$ ， $80\\%$ $200\\%$ , respectively. By performing this counterfactual experiment many times, we finally show more significant results (the penetration rate increases by $200\\%$ ), that is, we set $\\gamma_{a}=1.65,\\gamma_{s}=2.52,\\gamma_{d i f}=0.378$ and all else remains equal. In this exercise, the time path of the labor share change in the three sectors is compared to the share change in the benchmark model, as shown in Fig. 10.  \n\n![](images/b71c157e4f77c3c3c9e056faa09fb516135ef16a623db881bbd2c7fcb41d2e83.jpg)  \nFig. 9.

Time path of labor share change when the penetration rate of the new technology is increased.  \n\nFig. 10 summarizes our findings for the effect of this counterfactual on structural labor change by reporting the difference in the benchmark model and in the counterfactual. When the penetration rate of the new generation of IT in various sectors increases, the range and trend of labor share changes in agriculture and services will be more obvious. In the scenario with the penetration rate increasing by $200\\%$ ,theintersection time of the share of labor in agriculture and services will be earlier, and the inflection point of the labor share in industry will be earlier. The speed and extent of the decline of the labor share in agriculture and the increase of the labor share in services will be faster and greater. In the long run, the labor share in agriculture is still significantly lower than that of the benchmark model, while the labor share in services is significantly higher than that of the benchmark model.  \n\nTherefore, an improvement in the penetration rate of the new generation of IT still plays a significant role in optimizing the labor structure in the long term.  \n\nWe can conclude from these counterfactuals that labor reallocation across sectors is driven by two channels: income effects due to nonhomothetic preferences and substitution effects due to differential productivity growth across sectors. Sections 2 and 3 confirm the starting point of this paper, that is, that the technological progress rate is a main driver for adjustments in the labor structure. The new generation of IT plays a positive and significant role on each sector for structural labor changes from different perspectives.  \n\n## 6. Concluding remarks  \n\nWe explore the role of the new generation of $\\mathrm{IT}$ in theprocess of structural labor transformation in China. Using Chinese labor market data from 1978 to 2018, we find that the rapid development and widespread use of the new generation of IT since 20o0 can accelerate the process of China's structural labor adjustment. The benchmark model explains the rapid decline of the labor share in agriculture and the sharp increase of the labor share in services in recent years. The non-homothetic preference of the sector family for agricultural products leads to a relatively stable demand for agricultural products, while the sharp increase of the TFP in agriculture brought by the new generation of IT will lead to an outflow of labor from agriculture. The higher penetration rate of new technology into services leads to a higher contribution of new technology to TFP growth than that of industry, so ser. vices has a better ability to absorb labor and the share of labor increases significantly.  \n\nThe robustness tests show that the slight distortions in the market structure and the slight differences in the production structure have no significant effect on the change in China's labor structure. Our analysis on the robustness tests, with a particular emphasis on differences in production structure, extends the previous literature, which has mainly focused on different sectoral technological levels while ignoring factor input structural differences.  \n\nFurther counterfactual experiments show that labor reallocation across sectors is driven by two channels: income effects due to nonhomothetic preferences and substitution effects due to differential productivity growth across sectors. The technological progress rate is the main driver for adjustments in the labor structure. The new generation of IT has played an important role in the process of structural labor adjustments in recent years. Compared to the experiment of maintaining the original technological level, the emergence of the new generation of IT has promoted changes in the labor structure. In the short term, an improvement in the progress rate of the new generation of IT may speed up the adjustment in China's labor structure. However, in the long run, the improvement of the space of the progress of the new generation of IT and an increase in the penetration rate of the three sectorsmaygreatlypromotetheoptimizationofChina'slabor structure, which is characterized by a significant decline in the labor share in agriculture, accompanied by a significant increase in the labor share in services. In the long run, the labor share in agriculture will be significantly lower than that in the benchmark model,and the share of labor in services will be significantly higher than that of the benchmark model.  \n\nOur findings provide a richer picture of the relation between the rapid development of the new generation of IT and the adjustment of the labor structure. It also provides several suggestions for policy. Making full use of the new generation of IT to transform traditional sectors, deepening the integrated application of IT in various sectors, and increasing its penetration rate in various sectors for enterprises seem necessary and constructive. In the process of formulating and implementing industrial policies, government departments should strongly encourage and support the innovation, research, and development of a new generation of IT and give full play to its role in promoting structural labor adjustments.  \n\nPossible areas for further research, parallel to the solution offers discussed above, include the following. The theoretical model of this paper can be extended from a single-period equilibrium model to an intertemporal consumption model, so that the economic growth problem can be investigated. In the future, we can endogenize the capital accumulation process and investigate the role of capital to better explain quantitatively the change in the labor structure during this development process. In addition, based on the study of the impact of the new generation of IT on the labor share, we can consider the impact of new technology on unbalanced economic growth. We can also investigate the role of sectoral labor productivity in explaining the process of wage structure and economic growth.  \n\n# Declaration of competing interest  \n\nWe declare that we have no financial and personal relationships with other people or organizations that can inappropriately influence our work, there is no professional or other personal interest of any nature or kind in any product, service and/or company that could be construed as influencing the position presented in, or the review of, the manuscript entitled “The information technology revolution and structural labor change: Evidence from China\".  \n\n# Appendix A.

To establish causality, we adopt a difference-in-differences approach, based on the variations generated by the passage of the new Labor Contract Law in China, as well as an instrumental variable approach. We find the inducement effect of labor cost is more pronounced for Chinese non-state-owned enterprises, firms without political connections, and firms with low labor productivity. Our results support the induced innovation hypothesis in that increases in wages will induce invention and technology adoption, but also suggest that government intervention through state ownership and political connections largely decreases this inducement effect. Our findings have implications for emerging markets regarding the transition from a low-cost labor development model to an innovation-driven growth model.  \n\nKeywords: labor cost, corporate innovation, induced innovation hypothesis JEL Classification: G39, M41, D22  \n\n# \"A change in the relative prices of the factors of production is itself a spur to invention, and to invention of a particular kind—directed to economizing the use of a factor which has become relatively expensive. Hicks (1932, pp. 124-125), The Theory of Wages  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nTechnological differences are widely viewed as the primary determinant of productivity differences across corporations, regions, and countries. On one hand, the economic literature suggests that technology advances can be induced not only by exogenous state-led regulation but also by changes in the relative prices of production inputs (Hicks, 1932; Habakkuk, 1962; Allen, 2009). Further, the induced innovation hypothesis states that labor cost positively affects technology advancements.1 On the other hand, economic theories suggest that high wages and labor scarcity can discourage innovation. Macroeconomic models, such as the neoclassical growth and endogenous growth models, predict that an increase in labor prices or labor scarcity can lead to lower equilibrium capital goods and reduce the innovation output level or growth rate.2  \n\nAcemoglu (2010) presents a theoretical framework for the relationship between labor scarcity and innovation, and finds that high wages and labor scarcity induce innovation if the technology is labor saving, but deter innovation if it is labor complementary. Accordingly, he suggests that the direction of the relationship between labor cost and innovation varies across industries, time periods, and country-level institutions. Therefore, whether an increase in labor cost encourages innovation is an open empirical question. The economic literature typically analyzes the impact of labor cost on innovation advances at the aggregate level using countryor industry-wide data. However, innovation is an inherently microeconomic phenomenon, but there is limited understanding regarding how increases in labor cost affect technology innovation at the corporation level, especially in emerging markets that face structural changes in labor supply and cost along with strong government intervention through state ownership and political connections.  \n\nIn this study, we examine the inducement effect of labor cost on corporate innovation, using a sample of publicly listed companies in China for two main reasons, as follows. First, China is one of the largest economies and exporters worldwide, and the significant increases in labor cost and scarcity in China since the early 2000s provide a unique setting to study whether an increase in labor cost affects corporate innovation at the microeconomic level and how individual firms respond to wage increases and adjust innovation activities.3  \n\nSecond, the impact of labor cost on innovation can vary across institutional environments (Acemoglu, 2010). One important institutional feature of China is the role the government plays in corporate innovation through two distinct channels, namely state ownership and political connections in Chinese listed firms. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) and politically connected non-SOEs are more likely to take advantage of governmentcontrolled resources and policies to lower the costs of their innovation activities compared to their counterparts. However, the literature shows that government connections from state ownership and political connections reduce investment and innovation efficiency (Chen et al., 2011; Hou et al., 2017; Qin and Zhang, 2019; Zhou et al., 2017; Bortolotti et al., 2019; Pan and Tian, 2020) because connected firms face more severe government intervention for meeting social and political objectives (Jiang and Kim, 2020; Xu et al., 2005). Additionally, the managers of SOEs and connected firms, who are often appointed and evaluated by the government, would have different incentives for innovation activities and act in the interest of the government to fulfil these social and political objectives, instead of maximizing shareholder value (Fan et al., 2007; Li and Zhou, 2005). Therefore, we expect that innovation activities in the firms with government connections are less sensitive to the changes in labor cost, meaning government intervention impedes the inducement effect of labor cost. Therefore, our results provide important insights into the validity of the induced innovation hypothesis for emerging markets that face structural changes in their labor supply and cost, as well as strong government intervention.  \n\nUsing manually collected patent data from China's State Intellectual Property Office (CSIPO), we find evidence supporting the induced innovation hypothesis, in that an increase in labor cost increases the quantity and quality of innovation outputs at the firm level. The association between labor cost and innovation is economically significant. Specifically, when labor cost increases from the $25^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile to the $75^{\\mathrm{th}}$ , firm-level innovation output increases by $16\\%{-}19\\%$ . We also find that an increase in labor cost fosters innovation activities toward technology advances with high levels of innovative content and quality, as the relationship between labor cost and innovation is predominantly driven by invention patents.  \n\nWhile the positive relationship between labor cost and innovation is grounded in economic theory, our empirical findings do not establish the causal effect of labor cost on corporate innovation. To alleviate endogeneity concerns, we use two identification approaches to examine the causal effect of labor cost on innovation, namely, the instrumental variable and difference-in-differences methods. First, we follow Hochberg and Lindsey (2010) and Chang et al. (2015) in employing two-stage least squares (2SLS) regressions using two instrumental variables associated with labor costs but not directly related to a firm's innovation output. The first instrumental variable is the change in minimum wage at the city level and the second one, following Chang et al. (2015), is the labor cost across all non-innovation (zero-citation) firms that share similar two-digit zip codes with the sample firm but do not belong to the sample firm's two-digit SIC industry. The results suggest the causal influence of labor cost on corporate innovation output.  \n\nSecond, we explore a quasi-natural experiment—the implementation of the new Labor Contract Law in China—and use this regulatory change to identify the exogenous increases in labor cost among Chinese firms. Using the difference-in-differences method, we show that labor-intensive firms—whose labor costs associated with production or service provision outweigh the capital costs in terms of importance and volume—have had higher innovation outputs than non-labor-intensive firms since the adoption of the new law. By contrast, laborintensive firms do not show any significant difference in innovation before implementation. Overall, although endogeneity is a continuous issue that cannot be completely ruled out, the balance of evidence points to the causal effect of an increase in labor cost on corporate innovation output.  \n\nNext, we examine whether and how government intervention affects the inducement effect of labor cost across firms through state ownership and political connections. We find the positive effect of labor cost to be less pronounced for listed state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which are subject to government intervention and have responsibilities in fulfilling the political and social objectives set by the government. Additionally, the inducement effect of labor cost is more pronounced for firms without political connections. This finding indicates that the innovation activities of politically connected firms are less sensitive to labor cost increases because these firms are inclined to enhance performance through rent-seeking activities (Chen et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2017), such as government support and market protection, rather than through innovation. Overall, our results suggest that government intervention through state ownership and political connections, especially from local governments rather than the central government, largely decreases the inducement effect of labor cost on innovation and can distort innovation activities and harm innovation efficiency in emerging markets such as China.  \n\nWe also present evidence on the possible economic mechanisms through which increases in labor cost foster innovation. We find that, in response to the increased labor cost, firms reduce their employment but also adjust their production and operations by increasing the capital over labor ratio, use of machinery and equipment, and research and development (R&D) expenditure. Consistent with the previous results, such changes are predominantly evident among non-SOEs and firms without political connections and less pronounced or even insignificant among SOEs and politically connected firms. This provides further support for the view that government intervention impedes the inducement effect of labor cost on innovation through state ownership and political connections.  \n\nOur study makes several important contributions. First, it adds to the recent literature on the drivers of corporate innovation. Existing studies document the various factors that influence managerial incentives for innovation activities and innovation productivity.4 Our paper differs from these studies by presenting novel firm-level evidence on labor cost, a key factor of production, and its interaction with government intervention for influencing individual firms? innovation productivity. By testing the direct effect of labor cost on corporate innovation, as well as the moderating role of government intervention, our study relates to but differs from the recent studies on labor dismissal costs induced by the adoption of the good-faith exception (i.e., wrongful discharge laws) (Acharya et al., 2014; Bena et al., 2018), impact of labor unionization (Bradley et al., 2017), and effect of rural-urban migration (Chen et al., 2018).  \n\nSecond, our study contributes to the broad theoretical and empirical economic literature on how the relationships between factor endowments, such as the scarcity or abundance of labor, affect technology advances and innovation. Hitherto, the theoretical predictions on whether labor scarcity and high wages foster or discourage innovation are ambiguous and inconclusive (Acemoglu, 2007, 2010). Similarly, empirical studies typically use aggregated country- or sector-level data from developed countries and present mixed evidence.? The substantial cross-sectional variations in the institutional setting in China, namely the weak legal protection, state ownership, and political connections, enable us to provide further evidence regarding the inducement effect of labor cost on innovation, as well as how the government intervention impedes this inducement effect.  \n\nFinally, our research add to the innovation literature on emerging markets, such as China. We focus on a key factor of production, namely labor cost, rather than the legal, political, and market factors commonly examined in the literature.° Additionally, we test the extent and the quality of innovation of Chinese firms, while previous studies examine either the extent of innovation activities or R&D expenses. Our results thus support that wage increases will induce invention and technology adoption but that government intervention through state ownership and political connections largely decreases the inducement effect. As a result, our findings have implications for emerging markets regarding the transition from a low-cost labor development  \n\nmodel to an innovation-driven growth model.  \n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature and formulates our research hypotheses. Section 3 describes the sample, variable measurement, and summary statistics. Section 4 presents the main empirical results. Additional analyses are discussed in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper.  \n\n## 2. Institutional background and hypotheses development  \n\n### 2.1 Labor cost and regulation in China  \n\nSince the 1970s reforms onwards, China has achieved rapid economic growth, with an average growth rate above $8\\%$ per annum. China's growth model is characterized as being contingent on government-led infrastructure investments and low-cost labor from rural areas. However, in 2003, a labor shortage of migrant workers emerged in coastal areas and subsequently became a national phenomenon. Accordingly, the labor cost of urban workers has risen substantially, reaching an average growth rate above $12\\%$ from 2003-2015 (see Figure 1).7 The rapid rise in wages has led to the debate whether the Chinese labor market has reached its “Lewis turning point,” where the industrialized sector's growth might slow down because of the lack of cheap labor and the entire country's economic growth would start to subsequently decline (Cai and Du, 2011).  \n\nThe labor market dynamics in China also constitute an important agenda for the ongoing development of labor policies and legislation. The Labor Law of 1994 was considered a landmark in replacing lifelong employment with contract-based employment in China and government job assignment with labor market assignment. The Labor Law provides a foundation for employees’ legal and contractual rights, a mechanism for resolving labor disputes, and a system of collective consultation and contracting.  \n\nMeanwhile, the new Labor Contract Law, which came into effect in 2008, is considered the most significant reform over the past 20 years. Compared with the 1994 Labor Law, it systematically specifies the rights and obligations of the parties in labor contracts and provides employees with more legal rights as to protect job security. For example, it requires a written contract for all workers, systematically covers the secondment of labor and non-full-time employment, and revises the provisions in open-ended contracts. It also reaffirms social insurance, minimum wage, and maximum working hour obligation for employers.  \n\nAccordingly, labor cost among Chinese enterprises has increased systematically since the implementation of the new law in 2008 (Gallagher et al., 2015; Cui et al., 2013). Gao et al. (2012) show that the increasing prevalence of employment contracts after the law's implementation has significantly increased employees? social insurance in the form of pensions, work injury insurance, unemployment insurance, and medical insurance. The implementation of the new Labor Contract Law in China has also substantially increased the prevalence of employment contracts and the number of open-ended contracts in Chinese firms (Becker and Elfstrom, 2010; Li and Freeman, 2015).  \n\nWhile the draft of the new law was made public in March 2006 for collecting opinions and comments, its implementation in 2008 represented an exogenous and unexpected change in labor cost among Chinese firms. It is unlikely that Chinese firms would have voluntarily taken action in accordance with the new law in absence of its implementation for at least two reasons. First, after the release of the draft in March 2006, the Standing Law Committee of the National People's Congress received more than 190,0o0 observations that identified several conflicts. Then, the Committee conducted extensive surveys all over China and the draft of the new Labor Contract Law was substantially revised four times before its passage in June 2007. As the above process was predominantly internal to the Committee, Chinese firms would have found it almost impossible to have access to the final version of the law and had thus limited reasons to take action in advance when faced with such policy uncertainty. Second, the potential increase in labor cost introduced by the new law also significantly reduced the likelihood of early adoption by Chinese firms.  \n\n### 2.2 Hypotheses development  \n\nThe induced innovation hypothesis suggests that a change in the relative prices of production factors spur invention, which leads to the reduced use of the factor becoming relatively expensive. The intuition behind this hypothesis is that, when a factor of production (e.g., labor cost) becomes more expensive, its demand would reduce in a downward-sloping demand curve. Accordingly, we would expect some adjustment in other factors, such as technology, to occur by taking over the tasks previously conducted by the expensive factor.  \n\nHowever, in contradiction to the induced innovation hypothesis, the “impeded innovation hypothesis’ posits that high wages and labor scarcity can also discourage innovation because (1) high wages reduce the profitability of corporations and (2) labor scarcity reduces the size of the workforce using the new technologies. The adverse effect of labor cost on innovation is evident in commonly used macroeconomic models. The more recent endogenous growth models predict that high wages and labor scarcity reduce the growth rate and levels of technology and output because lower employment discourages entry and the introduction of technology advances (e.g., Romer, 1990; Jones, 1995; Howitt, 1999).  \n\nAcemoglu (2010) develops a static framework for labor scarcity and innovation, and specifies the conditions under which high wages and labor scarcity can induce or discourage technological innovation. Acemoglu (2010) finds that, when new technologies are strongly labor-saving, meaning technological improvements reduce the marginal product of labor, labor scarcity encourages innovation (i.e., induced innovation hypothesis). However, it discourages innovation if new technologies increase the marginal product of labor and are complementary to labor,&α which is consistent with the impeded innovation hypothesis.  \n\nAcemoglu's (2010) framework suggests that the relationship between labor cost and innovation can vary across periods, countries, and industries. For example, technology advances in the $18^{\\mathrm{th}}$ century, such as the spinning jenny, weaving machines, and printing cylinders, support the induced innovation hypothesis, since technology advances respond to increasing labor cost and take the form of using machines to replace the tasks previously performed by labor.? However, the rapid increase in the supply of skilled labor in the $20^{\\mathrm{th}}$ century, especially in the 1960s and 1970s, has largely contributed to the development of skillcomplementary technologies, consistent with the impeded innovation hypothesis (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018a; Autor, 2015). As previously mentioned, the effect of labor cost on innovation can differ across countries or industries, since technological progress tends to replace routine tasks and complement cognitive skills (Autor, 2015). Compared to developed countries, the increase in labor cost in developing countries, such as China, is more likely to foster innovation in line with the induced innovation hypothesis because these countries have a larger share of employment in routine occupations, which is easier to be substituted by the labor-saving automation due to technological advances. Similarly, the inducement effect of labor cost is likely prominent among labor-intensive industries, while the impediment effect may be observed among industries requiring more cognitive skills, which can rather be complemented by technological progress.  \n\nSimilar to the mixed predictions on the relationship between labor scarcity and innovation in the theoretical literature, the empirical evidence on the induced innovation hypothesis is also highly ambiguous (Liu and Shumway, 2009). Starting with Hayami and Ruttan (1970), early studies typically use annual U.S. and Japanese agricultural data and report findings consistent with the induced innovation hypothesis (Binswanger, 1974; Kawagoe et al., 1986; Chavas et al., 1997; Thirtle et al., 2002). However, subsequent studies challenge the evidence based on these data (e.g., Olmstead and Rhode, 1993; Machado, 1995; Liu and Shumway, 2009). Besides relying on agricultural data from the U.S. and Japan, recent studies present evidence in support of the hypothesis using data from the healthcare sectors. For example, Acemoglu and Finkelstein (2008) show that the increase in labor cost at the hospital level due to the Prospective Payment System reform in the U.S. Medicare system fosters technology adoption.  \n\nIn summary, the existing empirical studies typically present mixed evidence using aggregated sector-level data from developed countries such as the U.S. and Japan. By contrast, we use the recent increase in wages in China as a unique setting to examine the effect of labor cost on corporate innovation. Our tests, based on firm-level data from a developing country (i.e., China), differ from prior studies and provide additional insights to the mixed theoretical and empirical evidence on the induced innovation hypothesis. Given the previous mixed theoretical and empirical evidence, we posit two competing hypotheses—the induced innovation hypothesis (H1a) and impeded innovation hypothesis (H1b)—as follows:  \n\nHla: An increase in labor cost induces innovation among Chinese listed firms Hlb: An increase in labor cost impedes innovation among Chinese listed firms.  \n\nSimilar to the recent innovation literature (e.g., Fang et al., 2017), our study uses a firm's patenting activity to capture its innovation outcome. Under the Chinese patent law, three different types of patents—invention, utility, and design—are granted by the CSIPO. Invention patents cover new technologies, while utility patents are new applications of existing technologies. The third category are design patents, which cover novel packaging and designs with limited technological advancements. We only focus on invention and utility patents because of their significant innovation. By definition, invention patents tend to have higher innovation content than utility patents, given that invention patents cover new technologies rather than new applications of existing technologies. Further, the examination process is more rigorous for invention patents, which require two rounds of official examination, typically lasting 1.5-3 years. By contrast, utility patents involve only one round of examination, which takes 12-15 months. Finally, the success rate of invention patent applications is significantly lower than that of utility patents ( $33\\%$ comparedto $77\\%$ , respectively, as reported by the CSIPO in 2012). Since the innovation content is significantly higher for invention patents, we predict that the inducement effect of labor cost on innovation is more evident for invention than for utility patents.  \n\nAcemoglu (2010) suggests that the effect of labor scarcity on innovation depends on application and can vary across different institutional environments, time periods, and industries in question. One important institutional feature of China is the role the government plays in corporate innovation through two distinct channels, namely state ownership and listed companies’ political connections. As we discuss below, even if technology advances are laborsaving for certain Chinese firms (e.g., automation of logistics, manufacturing and processing, and digitization) (Li et al., 2020; Zhou and Tyers, 2019),1° government intervention in terms of employment and other social objectives can limit the substitution effect of labor-saving technologies and reduce the inducement effect of labor cost among certain Chinese firms. Additionally, government intervention can reduce investment and innovation efficiency (Bortolotti et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2017) and affect managerial innovation incentives (Jiang and Kim, 2020; Wong, 2016), resulting in a weaker relationship between labor cost and innovation output among SOEs and politically connected firms.  \n\nThe strong presence of state ownership results in the coexistence of SOEs and non-SOEs among Chinese listed firms. 1l Compared to non-SOEs, SOEs are more inclined to take advantage of government-controlled resources and policies to lower their innovation activity costs.12 However, these potential lower costs and the stronger governmental support for SOEs do not imply a more significant relationship between labor cost and innovation.  \n\nWe argue that the inducement effect of labor cost is expected to be weaker among Chinese SOEs for at least two reasons. First, since SOEs are owned by the government, their investment policies and innovation activities are largely subject to government intervention in terms of accomplishing social and state goals, such as regional development, employment, and social stability. 13 Therefore, technology advances cannot substitute or reduce the labor force among SOEs to an optimal level due to regional employment goals. Xu et al. (2005) show that excess employment and a lack of flexibility in labor deployment largely contribute to low productivity and investment, as well as R&D inefficiency among SOEs. Additionally, state ownership enables firms to obtain crucial R&D resources, but makes a firm less efficient in using these resources to generate innovation (Bortolotti et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2017). For example, Bortolotti et al. (2019) find that SOEs produce patents with more citations but with lower commercial value, which is consistent with the view that SOEs emphasize innovation with public good characteristics over commercial returns. Without government approval, SOEs are also less likely to terminate failed innovation projects or reduce subsequent investment should any potential conflicts arise with government agendas or policies (Zhou et al., 2017). Therefore, SOEs are likely to focus more on increasing short-term production levels and using local surplus labor, regardless of the changes in labor cost. This would result in innovation activities being insensitive to labor cost changes.  \n\nSecond, SOE managers have incentives for innovation investment that differ from those of non-SOE managers. Since the government maintains the right to choose company executives for SOEs, including CEOs and the chairperson, senior management and boards include mostly current or former government bureaucrats, who are not professional managers. In this personnel system under control by the government, SOE managers are evaluated based on regional GDP growth and stability relating to less unemployment (Li and Zhou, 2005). Additionally, the political promotion of SOE managers is often reliant on their contributions to social and political objectives (Jiang and Kim, 2020). Therefore, SOE managers can be considered quasi-government officials that tend to act in the interest of the government by implementing government policy mandates and fulfilling social and political objectives instead of maximizing shareholder value (Fan et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2011).14 They are also less likely to adjust their investment in innovation activities in response to increases in labor cost. The above analysis leads to the following hypothesis:  \n\nH2a: An increase in labor cost is more likely to induce innovation among Chinese nonSOEs compared toSOEs.  \n\nPolitical connections could also affect corporate decision making, especially for nonSOEs. According to the resource-based view, firms, especially non-SOEs, maintain close connections with the government as to be treated favorably by acquiring governmentcontrolled resources or benefits, such as tax cuts, subsidies (Lin et al., 2015), or policy-related loans (Piotroski and Zhang, 2014). The government policy and finance support decrease a firm's innovation costs and reduce the risk and possible adverse effects of innovation failure. They thus facilitate the technological advancement of the firm, leading to higher-level innovation activities among politically connected firms.  \n\nHowever, the potential advantages of political connections do not necessarily imply a higher sensitivity of innovation activities to the changes in labor cost. When firms face substantial increases in labor cost, the presence of political connections can lead to a weaker inducement effect of labor cost on corporate innovation for two reasons. First, politically connected firms are more likely to enhance their performance through rent-seeking activities rather than innovation and development activities (Chen et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2017). For example, connected firms are prone to obtain government grants, financial support, and even direct government orders, which enable them to survive and maintain operating performance. Additionally, they are better able to access the trade protection imposed by local governments, which reduces local market competition and increases connected firms? monopoly power. As such, when facing rising labor cost, connected firms would have fewer incentives and a lower need for innovation and development to offset the effect of labor cost increases.  \n\nSecond, similar to SOEs, non-SOE firms with political connections are more prone to be subject to government intervention and bribery to obtain or maintain political connections. For instance, a good state-business relationship helps local officials intervene in a firm's innovation activity decisions. To meet local officials’ political objectives, such as regional development and employment, connected firms tend to pay more attention to the improvement of short-term production and to hiring more employees, irrespective of the changes in labor cost. Accordingly, this would lower the sensitivity of innovation activities to labor cost changes. Moreover, politically connected non-SOEs may also be subject to government invention in terms of employment, which leads to a higher but suboptimal labor force level in accordance with technology advances and reduces the inducement effect of the labor cost. Previous research also finds that political connections hinder corporate innovation activities and reduce innovation efficiency (Hou et al., 2017; Qin and Zhang, 2019).  \n\nIn summary, while political connections can facilitate or hinder innovation, the innovation activities of connected firms are expected to be less sensitive to the changes in labor cost compared to those of the firms without political connections, resulting in a weaker inducement effect of labor cost. Consistent with this view, we formulate the following hypothesis:  \n\nH2b: An increase in labor cost is more likely to induce innovation among non-SOEs without political connections.  \n\n## 3. Sample and descriptive statistics  \n\n### 3.1 Sample and variables  \n\nWe gather our sample from several sources as follows. We manually collect patent data from the CSIPO website for 2005-2016 and construct a comprehensive Chinese patent database for all Chinese firms. The database includes detailed information regarding the name and classification of the patent, date of application, identification number, names of the applicant(s) and inventor(s), as well as other relevant information. Since the application of invention patents can take up to three years, a patent application submitted in 2014, 2015, or 2016 may not have been approved by the end of 2016. Therefore, we take the duration of patent approval into account and match our patent data with financial and stock price data for 2005- 2013.15 The data for patent citations are collected from the Patent Search and Analysis system of CSIPO, which covers patent citations, category analysis, and legal status in more than 100 countries. We use the citation search function in the Patent Search and Analysis system to manually collect citations for each patent.  \n\nFinancial and stock price data of manufacturing firms are sourced from the China Securities Market & Accounting Research database (CSMAR). 16 Following Sunder et al. (2017), we exclude firm-years with missing values on the explanatory variables and firms with special treatment (ST) determined by stock exchanges. These restrictions result in a final sample of 7,949 firm-years from 2005 to 2013.  \n\n#### 3.1.1 Measurement of corporate innovation  \n\nWe use two measures based on patent data to proxy for innovation productivity.17 The first measure captures a firm's innovation activity and output, as the number of patents awarded by CSIPO to each firm in a particular year. The second measure is the number of forward citations of a patent, which captures the quality and significance of a firm's innovation activity. The use of citation numbers to proxy for innovation success can largely mitigate the measurement issues arising from the patent application system, as identified in the literature, including trivial patents being awarded and anticompetitive behavior (Jaffe and Lerner, 2004). Since invention and utility patents differ substantially in their innovation contents, we further decompose the number of awarded patents and patent citations for invention and utility patents,  \n\nrespectively.  \n\nThe number of patent citations suffers truncation bias, because the patents in the latter years of the sample have less time to accumulate citations. We thus adjust the raw number of citations by multiplying the weighting index of Hall et al. (2001, 2005) to correct truncation bias. The weighting index is based on a quasi-structural approach with an estimated distribution of the citation-lag. Another method for correcting the truncation bias is the fixed-effect approach. We include the year fixed effects in the analysis below to mitigate any possible aggregate time effect.  \n\n### 3.1.2 Measurement of labor cost  \n\nOur key explanatory variable of interest is labor cost. As wage expenses are not disclosed directly in the profit and loss statements of Chinese firms, we use the amount of “paid for and on behalf of employees\"” reported in cash flow statements plus changes in “wages payable” in the balance sheet as a proxy for labor expenses. Particularly, our primary proxy for labor cost is the average wage expense in a given year after excluding top executives’ compensation. The rationale for removing executive compensation is that executive compensation includes a significant portion of the incentive pay in the form of cash, shares, or both.  \n\n### 3.2 Summary statistics  \n\nTable 1 presents the summary statistics of the variables used in our analysis. The definition of each variable is summarized in the Appendix. We classify firm-years into two categories, based on the median value of labor cost each year, and report mean values for firms with high and low labor cost (columns (4) and (5), respectively). We then show the differences in the mean of each variable in column (6) for the two subsamples.  \n\n[Insert Table 1 about here]  \n\nOn average, the sample firms are awarded 14.3 patents per year, of which 7.2 are invention patents.18 On average, patents have been cited 5.4 times over the sample period and the citations for invention patents account for around $80\\%$ (4.265/5.406) of all citations. The average of the log of labor cost for Chinese listed companies is 10.957, while the median value of 10.948 is relatively lower. Around $68\\%$ of our sample firm-years have income from overseas for their export sales. The average firm has a return on assets ratio of $3.7\\%$ and a leverage ratio Oof $46\\%$  \n\n## 4. Main results  \n\n### 4.1 Baseline results  \n\nWe test the effect of labor cost on innovation for Chinese listed firms using the following model:  \n\n$L n\\left(1+I n n o v a t i o n_{i,t}\\right)=\\alpha+\\beta_{I}L a b o r c o s t_{i,t-1}+\\gamma X_{i,t-1}+I n d u s t r y F E+Y e a r F E+\\varepsilon_{i,t},$ (1) where Innovation refers to innovation measures, namely the number of awarded patents (Patent), invention patents (Invention), and utility patents (Utility) and the adjusted number of citations for all patents (Citation), invention patents (Citlnvention), and utility patents (CitUtility). To reduce the skewness of these variables, we use the log of one plus these variables. Labor cost (Labor cost) is a firm's average wage expenses in a given year after excluding top executives’ compensation  in  year $t{-}1,X$ represents  the  control  variables identified in the literature (e.g., Chang et al., 2015; Fan et al., 2017; He and Tian, 2013; Tian and Wang, 2014). The control variables include firm size $(S i z e)$ , capital expenditure (Capexp), financial leverage (Leverage), R&D expenditure $(R\\&D)$ , return on assets $(R O A)$ , sale growth rate (Gsale), an indicator of exports (Export), firm age (Firm age), and industry concentration measured by the Herfindahl index (HHI). We also include the labor share $(L a b\\_M a c)$ and labor intensity $(L a b\\_I n t)$ to control for the possible effect of the declining labor share on innovation.19 Similar to Bradley et al. (2017), Chang et al. (2015), Hirshleifer et al. (2012), and Tian and Wang (2014), we include two-digit industry and year fixed effects in the regression. The standard errors are calculated by clustering at the firm level.  \n\nTable 2 reports the OLS estimates of Equation (1). Labor cost is found to be positively and significantly correlated with the number of awarded patents (column (1)) and that of patent citations (column (4), suggesting that an increase in labor cost leads to a higher level and quality of corporation innovation and is reflected in a firm's patents and patent citations. The results thus lend support to H1a in that the increase in labor cost induces corporate innovation among Chinese firms.  \n\n# [Insert Table 2 about here]  \n\nWhen dividing patents into invention and utility patents, we find that the positive relationship between labor cost and innovation is predominantly concentrated in invention patents. For example, the coefficient on labor cost is 0.145 ( $\\'t=4.751$ ) for invention patents (column (2)) and is significantly positive at the $1\\%$ significance level, while the magnitude is comparable to that for all patents (0.144 in column (1)). However, the coefficient on labor cost is 0.089 $\\'t=3.053$ ) for utility patents and 0.057 ( $(t=2.972$ ) for their citations. These results support that the inducement effect of labor cost on corporate innovation is more evident for invention patents than for utility patents, given that the innovation content of the former is significantly higher than that of the latter.  \n\nThe positive association between labor cost and innovation is also economically significant. When labor cost increases from the $25^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile (40,025) to the $75^{\\mathrm{th}}$ (80,931), we find that the number of awarded patents (invention patents) increases by $16\\%$ $(17\\%)$ and the number of patent citations (invention patent citations) by $19\\%$ $16\\%$ .20 The coefficients on the control variables are generally consistent with the literature (Chang et al., 2015; Fang et al., 2017; He and Tian, 2013). For example, younger firms and firms with large size and exports tend to have higher innovation productivities. Capital expenditure and R&D expenses appear to encourage innovation, evidenced by the significant and positive coefficients in most columns.  \n\n### 4.2 Identification: Difference-in-differences approach  \n\nThe finding that a firm's labor cost is positively associated with innovation success, does not establish the causal effect of labor cost on innovation. The direction of the causal relationship can also run from innovation to labor cost because innovative firms may pay higher wages to their employees (Pianta and Tancioni, 2008; Aghion et al., 2017). For example, Aghion et al. (2017) show that firms with higher R&D intensity tend to pay higher wages. To alleviate this concern, we use two identification methods to examine the causal effects of labor cost on innovation, namely, the instrumental variable approach with the difference-indifferences method (Section 4.2) and 2SLS regressions (Section 4.3).  \n\nThe difference-in-differences approach aims  to  tackle the endogeneity problem. Particularly, we explore a quasi-natural experiment—the passage of the new Labor Contract Law in China in 2008—and use this event to identify an exogenous change in the labor costs of Chinese listed firms. Previous research has found that the implementation of the new law has substantially increased labor costs among Chinese firms (Gallagher et al., 2015; Cui et al., 2013), as well as the likelihood of signing employment contracts (Becker and Elfstrom, 2010; Li and Freeman, 2015) and paying employees′ social insurance in the form of pensions, work injury insurance, and unemployment insurance (Gao et al., 2012).  \n\nAs discussed in Section 2.1, the implementation of the new Labor Contract Law in 2008 represents an exogenous and unexpected change in labor costs among Chinese firms. However, its impact on individual firms largely depends on the firm's business model, manufacturing process, and structure of tangible and human capital. We conduct the difference-in-differences analysis  by  distinguishing between  labor-intensive and  non-labor-intensive firms  and identifying the effect on corporate innovation that results from an increase in the intensity of labor cost. Labor-intensive firms are those that have a significant amount of costs associated with the necessary personnel for producing products or providing services, and such costs outweigh the capital costs in terms of importance and volume. Previous studies document that the increase in labor cost tends to have a substantially larger impact on labor-intensive firms (Xie and Zhang, 2015; Chen et al., 2018). We estimate the following regression under the framework of the difference-in-differences method:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}&{L n\\left(1+I n n o\\nu a t i o n_{i,t}\\right)=\\alpha+\\beta_{I}L a b\\_I n t_{i,t-I}+\\beta_{2}P o s t+\\beta_{3}L a b\\_I n t_{i,t-I}*P o s t+\\gamma X_{i,t-1}}&\\ &{+I n d u s t r y F E+Y e a r F E+\\varepsilon_{i,t},}&{(2)}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere Lab_Int is equal to a firm's total number of employees divided by sales.21 Post is an indicator variable taking the value of one for firm-years in 2008 or afterward, and zero Ootherwise. $X$ represents a set of control variables previously included in the OLS regression. Industry and year fixed effects are also included in the regression. The standard errors are calculated by clustering at the firm level.  \n\nThe results in Panel A of Table 3 show that the key variables of interest—the interaction terms between the indicator of labor-intensive firms and the indicator of Post—are positive and significant. This suggests that, after the implementation of the new Labor Contract Law in 2008, the increase in innovation is larger for labor-intensive firms.  \n\nThe validity of the difference-in-differences approach critically depends on the parallel trends assumption that innovation activities among the treated firms would have behaved similarly to those of the control firms in the absence of the treatment (i.e., the implementation of the new Labor Contract Law). Therefore, we employ the approach of Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003) to address the parallel trend assumption (e.g., Tan et al., 2015; Fang et al., 2017). Panel B of Table 3 examines the pre-treatment trends between the treatment and control firms. We use several indicator variables, namely Year2, Year-', Year?, Year', Year?, and $Y e a r^{3+}$ to represent the year relative to the implementation of the law.22 We find that the coefficients on the interaction terms between the indicator of labor-intensive firms and the two indicator variables Year2 and Year- are close to zero and insignificant in most columns, indicating that the treated and control firms share a similar trend in innovation before implementation. The interaction terms between Lab_Int and the years after the implementation of the law are all significantly positive, except for $L a b\\_I n t^{*}Y e a r^{0}$ , suggesting that the inducement effect of labor cost on innovation output has taken place since the second year after the law. This is consistent with the rationale that corporate innovation decisions require time for adjustment, while innovation output requires time for development. Overall, the results support the parallel trend assumption and are consistent with the results for Equation (2), in that labor-intensive firms do not demonstrate any significant differences in innovation output before the implementation, but their innovation activities and quality increase significantly afterwards.  \n\n[Insert Table 3 about here]  \n\n### Placebo tests  \n\nOne concern is that our difference-in-differences results could have captured a general time effect or been driven by chance rather than reflecting the inducement effect of labor cost. To mitigate this concern, we perform placebo (falsification) tests, in which we falsely assume that a treatment and/or an exogenous change occurs. Specifically, we run simulations that artificially assign labor-intensive and non-labor-intensive firms to our sample firms and randomly select a false year for the implementation of the new Labor Contract Law over the sample period. We conduct difference-in-difference analyses using the simulated sample and repeat the simulation process 1,000 times. The results, reported in Panel C of Table 3, show that all coefficients, including those on the interaction terms between the indicator of laborintensive firms and the indicator of Post, are close to O and insignificant. This suggests that changes in corporate innovation are similar for treated and control firms in the placebo periods, and that the true treatment coefficient estimate reported in Panel A is an unlikely event. Overall, the findings support that the changes in innovation are prone to stem from the change in labor cost due to the implementation of the new Labor Contract Law in 2008.  \n\n### 4.3 Identification—The instrumental variable approach and two-stage regression  \n\nSecond, based on Hochberg and Lindsey (2010) and Chang et al. (2015), we employ an instrumental variable approach. We use two instrumental variables that are associated with labor costs but not directly related to a firm's innovation output. The first instrumental variable is the change in minimum wage at the city level (△Min Wage).23  We manually collect minimum wage data from Human Resources and Social Security Bureau of Chinese prefecture-level cities.  \n\nWe use the change rather than the level of the minimum wage because the level of the minimum wage differs substantially across cities and is often determined and adjusted by each city government every 2-3 years; as such, it can be strongly related to the city's economic condition, thereby having a possible impact on corporate innovation. However, given that the change in minimum wage in a city is determined and adjusted by regulators, it is less likely that it has a significant association with local economic conditions or firm-level innovation output.24 We acknowledge that the key decisions on either the level or the increase in the minimum wage should be approved by city leaders. If a city leader cares about the city's economic fundamentals (e.g., attractiveness of mobile capital), he/she may control the pace of the increases in minimum wage.2 To address such concern, we include a set of controls related to the personal characteristics of city leaders (for both city party chiefs and mayors). These control variables include the gender (Sgender for city party chiefs and Mgender for mayors), ethnicity (Sethnicity and Methnicity), age (Sage and Mage), educational background (Sdegree and Mdegree), and tenure (Stenure and Mtenure) of either the city party chief or city mayor. We also include the city-level GDP per capita as an additional control. The results in Table 4 show that both instrumental variables continue to be significantly associated with labor cost after controlling for local economic conditions measured by the city-level GDP per capita and personal characteristics of city leaders.  \n\nThe second instrumental variable is the average wage after excluding executive compensation across all non-innovation (zero-citation) companies that are not in the same industry (based on the two-digit Chinese Standard Industrial Classification codes) as the sample firm but have similar two-digit zip codes. Following Chang et al. (2015) and Kedia and Rajgopal (2009), we construct the instrumental variable using non-innovative firms to satisfy the exclusion criterion and using geographical proximity (with similar zip codes) to satisfy the relevance criteria, because firms are expected to have local similarities in wage structure and policies. We find consistent results when zip codes are based on the first two-, four-, or sixdigit zip codes, or when industry codes are used for the first three or four digits. Additionally, we only include non-innovative firms (i.e., firms with zero citation) in different industries from the firm's own industry. This approach is used to avoid technology spillovers among firms within industries (Jaffe et al., 1993; Chang et al., 2015).  \n\nTable 4 presents the results using the instrumental variable approach in the framework of the two-stage regression. In the first stage, we use the two instrumental variables and other control variables to predict labor cost. The results of the first-stage regression (column (1)) show that both instrumental variables, △MinWage and Labor_other, are positively and significantly associated with labor cost. The $F\\cdot$ -statistic from the joint test of excluded instruments is 40.82 and significant at the $1\\%$ level, indicating that the instrumental variables pass the relevance test.  \n\nThe results of the second-stage regression (columns (2) to (7) are consistent with those reported in Table 2. Labor cost positively predicts corporation innovation measured by the number of patents and patent citations. More importantly, the inducement effect of labor cost is only evident for invention patents, given the higher innovation content of these patents compared to utility patents. Therefore, while we cannot completely rule out the possibility of endogeneity in our tests, the results based on the instrumental variable approach indicate the causal effect of labor cost on the inducement of corporate innovation.  \n\n[Insert Table 4 about here]  \n\n### 4.4 Labor productivity and the inducement effect of labor cost  \n\nThe inducement effect of labor cost on innovation may also depend on a firm's labor productivity. In the theoretical model of Acemoglu (2010), an increase in labor cost spurs innovation if technological advances are labor-saving and reduce the marginal product of labor. Conversely, an increase in labor cost can discourage innovation if technology complements labor and increases the marginal product of labor. Therefore, when facing a substantial increase in labor cost, firms with low labor productivity are more likely to engage in innovative activities and have higher innovation outputs because innovative technologies can reduce labor hours and increase productivity, thereby reducing the marginal product of labor.  \n\nTo test the effect of labor productivity, we divide the sample into two subsamples based on the median firm's labor productivity each year. Labor productivity is calculated as sales divided by the number of employees. The results in Table 5 show that labor cost is positively and significantly related to innovation in the firms with a low level of labor productivity, while the association is much smaller and even insignificant for firms with high labor productivity. Additionally, the inducement effect of labor cost is mainly evident for invention patents, regardless of labor productivity. This finding thus supports the view that an increase in labor cost can induce innovation only when innovative technology increases productivity and reduces the marginal product of labor.  \n\n[Insert Table 5 about here]  \n\n### 4.5 Labor cost and innovation:Possible economic mechanisms  \n\nHere, we explore possible underlying economic mechanisms through which increases in labor cost foster firm innovation. As predicted by economic theories, when facing higher labor costs, firms can adjust their production and operation methods by adjusting their employment, capital expenditure, R&D inputs, and fixed assets in the form of machinery and equipment available to workers. According to the induced innovation hypothesis, input for innovation and other production factors is expected to increase as a result of investment on labor-saving innovation to maintain a firm's growth and the substitution of labor input. We consider capital expenditure per employee (Cap/Emp) to measure capital over labor ratio, R&D expenditure $(R\\&D)$ to measure input in innovation, and machinery and equipment available to workers (Equipment) to measure capital input (Bradley et al., 2017; Sunder et al., 2017). Further, due to a downward-sloping demand curve, the demand for labor would reduce when labor cost becomes more expensive. Therefore, we examine whether increases in labor costs lead to reductions in the employment level (Emp).  \n\nTable 6 reports the results of regressing capital intensity, R&D expenditure, and the level of employment on labor costs. We find that labor cost is positively related to capital input and R&D expenditure, and negatively associated with the employment level. This suggests that, as a result of the higher labor cost, the average firm not only reduces its employment but also increases its inputs in innovation and capital in an attempt to adjust the production and operation methods that rely more on capital and less on labor. The results from the differencein-differences approach further confirm the changes after the implementation of the new Labor Contract Law in 2008.26  \n\n[Insert Table 6 about here]  \n\n## 5. State ownership, political connections, and the inducement effect of labor cost  \n\nHaving documented the inducement effect of labor cost on corporate innovation, we now examine how the positive effect of labor cost varies between SOEs and non-SOEs, as well as for firms with and without political connections.  \n\nFirst, we classify our sample into SOEs and non-SOEs based on the type of the ultimate controlling shareholders from the CSMAR. According to this classification, 3,553 firm-year observations are classified as SOEs and account for $45\\%$ of the sample. The results from both the OLS regression and difference-in-differences approach in Table 7 show that the positive association between labor cost and innovation is more significant for non-SOEs. This finding is consistent with H2a, in that an increase in labor cost can spur the extent and quality of innovation activities in non-SOEs. Interestingly, we find that an increase in labor cost fosters invention innovation rather than other types of innovation only among non-SOEs.  \n\n[Insert Table 7 about here]  \n\nTo examine how political connections interact with the inducement effect of labor cost, we divide the sample of non-SOE firms into politically connected firms and those without political connections.27 We define a firm as having political connections if either the CEO or chair of the board is (1) a current or former officer of either the central government, a local government, or the military or (2) a current or former member of the People's Congress or the People's Political Consultative Conference. Our definition of politically connected managers aligns with those of Fan et al. (2007) and Chen et al. (2011).  \n\nThe results in Table 8 indicate that the coefficient on labor cost is significantly positive for firms without political connections, but we fail to find any significant effect of labor cost on the extent or quality of innovation activities among non-SOEs with political connections. This finding is consistent with the notion that politically connected firms are more inclined to enhance corporate performance through rent-seeking activities, such as government support and local market protection. They are also more likely to be subject to government intervention and bribery as the cost of rent seeking, which leads to a lower degree of innovation sensitivity to the changes in labor cost. Our results suggest that government intervention through state ownership and political connections largely decrease the inducement effect of labor cost on innovation in China. When considering different types of innovation, our evidence further shows that increases in labor cost encourages invention patent innovation mainly for non-SOEs without political connections.  \n\n[Insert Table 8 about here]  \n\n### The inducement effect of labor cost: Central SOEs vs. local SOEs  \n\nPrior studies document that government intervention significantly affects a firm's investment activities and efficiency, and that the impact of government intervention is primarily found for SOEs under the control of local governments rather than those controlled by the central government (Chen et al., 2011; Hao and Lu, 2018). Along this line, we argue that the inducement effect of labor cost on innovation could be lower for local SOEs than for central SOEs, for at least two reasons. First, local SOEs are more likely to be subject to intervention from their ultimate owners, the local governments, who tend to promote corporate investment in fixed assets (Campos and Coricelli, 2002) and equity in other local SOEs (Xu, 2011), or reduce R&D investment (Hao and Lu, 2018) to achieve social, economic, or political objectives.28 Second, the political promotion of managers in local SOEs, which are appointed by the local governments, is more likely to rely on the extent to which the local SOEs act in the interest of the local government (i.e., implementing government policies and fulfilling social goals). Accordingly, innovation activities among local SOEs are expected to be less sensitive to the changes in labor price, compared to those of central SOEs.29 To test the difference between central and local SOEs, we run the regressions for both samples separately. The results in Table 9 are consistent with our expectations, indicating that the positive relationship between labor cost and innovation is mainly evident among central SOEs. The findings further support that government intervention, especially from local governments, serves as an important impediment to the inducement of labor cost.  \n\n[Insert Table 9 about here]  \n\n## 6. Additional analyses  \n\nIn the regression analysis, although we control for a set of variables affecting innovation based on previous studies, the coefficient estimates can be biased and inconsistent due to omitted variables that affect both labor cost and innovation. Below, we first explicitly describe possible omitted variables and then present the results of the tests used to address this issue. For brevity, we only report the coefficients of key variables in Table 10.  \n\n[Insert Table 10 about here]  \n\nFirst, we control for past innovation success in the regression. While our results suggest that increases in labor cost induce firm innovation, innovative firms may pay higher wages to their employees (Pianta and Tancioni, 2008; Aghion et al., 2017). Firms having high innovation outputs are likely to achieve innovation success in the future, thus indicating the positive autocorrelation of innovation outputs. Following Chang et al. (2015), we measure past innovation success as the average number of patents or patent citations over the past five years. The results in Panel A demonstrate that the coefficient on past innovation success is significantly positive, confirming that firms being innovative in the past tend to continue their success in the future. More importantly, the coefficient on labor cost continues to be positive and significant, suggesting our results are not attributable to past innovation success.  \n\nGeographical variations in economic development may affect both labor cost and innovation. Firms operating in areas with high degrees of economic development are likely to pay higher wages to their employees compared with firms in areas with low economic development. Additionally, firms in high economic development areas tend to be better able to raise capital and invest more resources in innovation activities, leading to higher innovation outputs. We use city-level GDP per capita as the proxy for city-level economic development and include this measure in the OLS regression. The results in Panel B of Table 10 show that the coefficient on the city-level GDP per capita is statistically insignificant but that our main results remain unchanged.  \n\nThe positive association between labor cost and innovation can be due to geographic industry clustering. Engelberg et al. (2018) find that firms from the same industry demonstrate substantial similarity in their fundamentals and operating activities. Further, Jaffe et al. (1993) and Ellison et al. (2010) suggest that, within geographic clusters, technology spillover can go from innovative to non-innovative firms, because non-innovative firms respond and even “replicate” technological advances owing to product market competition. This means that industry geographic clustering is positively related to innovation. The adoption of technology within geographic clusters may also generate abnormal economic incomes for both innovative and non-innovative firms, which increases the wage level. Therefore, industry geographic clustering may be positively associated with labor cost. To address the potential bias arising from industry geographic clustering, we remove firms whose headquarters are located in the four largest cities in China (i.e., Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen) because many high technology and innovative firms are clustered in these cities. The results in Panels C of Table 10 reveal that the removal of firms clustered in big cities does not alter our main results.  \n\nWe also perform additional tests to confirm that the inducement effect of labor cost on innovation is robust to alternative model specifications and variable measurement. First, since the increase in labor cost would not be simultaneously observed by all firms and firms require time to respond and adjust their operating and investing activities, it may take more than one year for labor cost to impact corporate innovation activities. To account for the time lag effect of labor cost, we replace the key explanatory variable by the labor costs in year $t{-}2$ (Panel D of Table 10) and in year $t{-}3$ (Panel E).  \n\nSecond, we run negative binomial regressions (Panel F), rather than OLS regressions, to mitigate the concern that our dependent variables in the OLS regression (i.e., number of patents and patent citations) are non-negatively discrete (Sunder et al., 2017; Chang et al., 2015). For the negative binomial regressions, we use the number of patents and patent citations as the dependent variables, instead of their natural logarithm values.  \n\nThird, we follow Shust and Weiss (2014) in using “cash paid to and on behalf of employees' from the statement of cash flow to measure labor cost. It includes the cash compensation to employees in the form of salaries, bonuses, pension, insurance, and housing provident funds (Gu et al., 2015). The results reported in Panel G remain unchanged when using (1) average wages including executive compensation, (2) total wages, and (3) the ratio of total wages to sale to measure labor cost.  \n\nFourth, our previous analyses use the number of patents and patent citations at the firm level as dependent variables to capture the extent and quality of innovation activities. We also use the adjusted number of patent citations per patent to account for the average quality and significance of patents as the dependent variable. The results in Panel H show that none of the above analyses has a significant impact on the positive relationship between labor cost and innovation.  \n\nFinally, we examine the extent to which an increase in labor cost affects two alternative innovation measures, namely total factor productivity $(T F P)$ and innovation efficiency.3 We follow Giannetti et al. (2015), and compute total factor productivity as the residual of the linear regression of a firm's total sales on its number of employees, total assets and expenses for the cost of materials, and other inputs. The regression is estimated by industry and year. For innovation efficiency, we follow Cao et al. (2018), and compute innovation efficiency as the ratio of the number of patents or citations to the sum of current period R&D expenses, twothirds of prior period R&D expenses, and one-third of R&D expenses in the year before the last.  \n\n# [Insert Table 11 about here]  \n\nThe results based on TFP and the innovation efficiency measures are reported in Table 11. We find that, consistent with our findings on innovation output, the increase in labor cost is also associated with improved total factor productivity and innovation efficiency and that the effect of labor cost on innovation efficiency is primarily found for invention patents rather than utility patents.  \n\n## 7. Conclusions  \n\nThe significant increase in labor cost and labor scarcity in China since the early 2000s has had an economic impact on the well-being of the Chinese society. Innovation is now promoted by China's top leaders and is crucial for the Chinese economy. Despite the number of studies on the various factors that spur or impede innovation, few studies have hitherto examined the role of labor cost in the innovation process at the corporate level. Our paper fills this gap.  \n\nSpecifically, we provide evidence that an increase in labor cost induces an increase in the quantity and quality of innovation output at the firm level. Additionally, we find that the inducement effect on the increase in labor cost is predominantly evident for invention patents rather than utility patents, indicating that an increase in labor cost fosters technology advances with higher levels of innovative content and quality. To this end, we employ two identification methods, namely, the instrumental variable and the difference-in-differences approaches, to address the endogeneity concern about reverse causality. The results confirm the main findings and highlight the causal effect of the increase in labor cost on corporate innovation output. When the sample is partitioned into groups, based on different traits, we find that the positive effect of labor cost is more pronounced for Chinese non-SOEs, firms without political connections, and firms with low labor productivity. The results suggest that, although the induced innovation hypothesis that increases in wages will induce invention and technology adoption is supported, government intervention largely decreases the inducement effect through state ownership and political connections. Our results provide important implications for policy-making and are generalizable to other emerging markets with relatively low labor costs in the manufacturing sector and strong government intervention. While managerial incentives, corporate ownership structure, laws, and institutions are important determinants of the corporate innovation output, our results suggest that an increase in labor cost induces proactive adjustments in innovation activities in corporations and increases innovation productivity, and that this effect will be more pronounced if government intervention is largely reduced. Therefore, the findings stress the important role of labor price, which can be driven by either market force or regulation (e.g., change in minimum wages), in the transition from a development model that relies on low labor cost and high infrastructure investment to a technology-based and innovation-driven model, as is the case in China.  \n\n## References  \n\nAcemoglu, D., 2007.

TFP is the total factor productivity, measured as the residual ofa linear regression of a firm's total sales on its number of employees, total assets, and expenses for the cost of materials and other inputs. The regression is estimated by industry and year. IE_Pat, IE_Inv, and $\\operatorname{IE}_{-}U t i$ are the innovation efficiency of total approved patents, invention patents, and utility patents, respectively. IE_Cit, IE_Citlnv, and IE_CitUti are the innovation efficiency of total approved patents, invention patents, and utility patents and are measured by the adjusted number of citations received by each patent, respectively. All other variables are defined in the Appendix. All independent variables are measured at $t{-}1$ for estimating the regression. All continuous variables are winsorized at the $1\\%$ level at both tails of their distribution. The regressions include city, industry, and year fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the firm level and $t$ -statistics are reported in the parentheses. $^{***},^{**}$ , and \\* indicate significance at the $1\\%$ $5\\%$ and $10\\%$ levels, respectively.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"3\"></td><td rowspan=\"3\">Totalfactor productivity TFP</td><td colspan=\"6\">Innovation Efficiency</td></tr><tr><td>IE Pat</td><td>IE Inv (3)</td><td>IE Uti (4)</td><td>IE_Cit (5)</td><td>IE CitInv (6)</td><td>IE CitUti (7)</td></tr><tr><td>Laborcost</td><td>(1) 0.026 *** (7.386)</td><td>(2) 0.013*** (5.069)</td><td>0.012*** (5.415)</td><td>0.007*** (3.640)</td><td>0.012*** (5.623)</td><td>0.010*** (5.036)</td><td>0.003 (2.926)</td></tr><tr><td>Controls</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>CityFE</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>IndustryFE</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>YearFE</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>7949</td><td>6572</td><td>6572</td><td>6572</td><td>6572</td><td>6572</td><td>6572</td></tr><tr><td>AdjustedR2</td><td>0.246</td><td>0.235</td><td>0.213</td><td>0.253</td><td>0.194</td><td>0.186</td><td>0.122</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Labor cost</td><td></td><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">Invention vs. Utility (3) vs. (4) 13.14***</td><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">Invention vs.Utility (6) vs. (7)</td></tr></table></body></html>  "
