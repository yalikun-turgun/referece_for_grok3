MEGGINSON and KATHLEEN A. WEISS  \n\n# ABSTRACT  \n\nThis paper provides support for the certification role of venture capitalists in initial public offerings. Consistent with the certification hypothesis, a comparison of venture capital backed IPOs with a control sample of nonventure capital backed IPOs from 1983 through 1987 matched as closely as possible by industry and offering size indicates that venture capital backing results in significantly lower initial returns and gross spreads. In effect, the presence of venture capitalists in the issuing firms serves to lower the total costs of going public and to maximize the net proceeds to the offering firm. In addition, we document that venture capitalists retain a significantportion of theirholdings in thefirm after theIPO.  \n\nTHE ABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY specialists to certify the value of securities issued by relatively unknown firms in capital markets that are characterized by asymmetric information between corporate insiders and public investors has attracted much academic interest in recent years. Several authors, including James (1990), Blackwell, Marr, and Spivey (1990), and Barry, Muscarella, Peavy, and Vetsuypens (1991) have developed and tested models based at least in part on the formal certification hypothesis presented in Booth and Smith (1986). A related body of work, represented by DeAngelo (1981), Beatty and Ritter (1986), Titman and Trueman (1986), Johnson and Miller (1988), Carter (1990), Simon (1990), and Carter and Manaster (1990) has examined how investment bankers and auditors help resolve the asymmetric information inherent in the initial public offering (IPO) process.  \n\nIn this paper we examine whether the presence of venture capitalists, as investors in a firm going public, can certify that the offering price of the issue reflects all available and relevant inside information.

We employ a matched pairs methodology where a sample of venture capital (VC) backed IPOs is matched by industry and offering size with a qualitatively equivalent set of non-VC backed IPOs, to focus as clearly as possible on the question of whether venture capital certification occurs and is valuable. Our results strongly indicate that the presence of venture capitalists in offering firms maximizes the fraction of the proceeds of the IPO, net of underpricing and direct costs, which accrues to the issuing firm.  \n\nSpecifically, we document that VC backing reduces the mean and median degree of IPO underpricing and that such backing significantly reduces the underwriting spread charged by the investment banker handling the issue. Further support for the venture capitalist certification hypothesis is provided by our finding that VC backed issuers are able to attract more prestigious auditors and underwriters than non-VC backed issuers. In addition, VC backed issuers also elicit greater interest from institutional investors during the IPO and are able to go public at a younger age than other firms. Finally, the credibility of venture capitalists’ information is enhanced by the fact that they are major shareholders prior to the IPO and retain significant portions of their holdings after the offer.  \n\nThis study is organized as follows. In Section I, a general model of venture capital certification is provided. The sample selection criteria and descriptive statistics are presented in Section II. In Section III, the comparison of underwriter and auditor quality and the level of institutional shareholdings between VC and non-VC backed firms is examined. Empirical tests of the certification hypothesis are presented in Section IV. The pre- and post-IPO ownership structure of venture capitalists in the issuing firm is documented in Section V. Section VI concludes the study.  \n\n## 1. Certification by Venture Capitalists  \n\nThird party certification has value whenever securities are being issued in capital markets where insiders of the issuing firm and outside investors have different information sets concerning the value of the offering firm. Corporate insiders have an incentive to conceal (or at least delay the revelation of) adverse information because doing so will allow them to sell securities at a higher price. Rational outside investors understand these incentives and will only offer a low average price for the securities offered unless they can be credibly assured that the offering price already reflects all relevant private information. This informationally induced standoff can lead to market failure of the type described by Akerlof (1970) unless the information asymmetry canbereduced.  \n\nAlthough Allen and Faulhaber (1989), Grinblatt and Huang (1989), and Welch (1989), have presented signalling models which predict that corporate insiders can unilaterally convey their private information, there are several factors which make first-party statements and actions suspect. For one thing, Gale and Stiglitz (1989) show that IPO signalling models break down when insiders are allowed to sell equity more than once. More fundamentally, insiders have everything to gain and very little to lose from signalling falsely at the time of an IPO. They sell securities only infrequently and thus would only be “punished\" far in the future if at all. Their gain, however, would be immediate and possibly quite large. While disclosure regulation will surely discourage flagrant lying and material omissions [see Tinic (1988)], it is unlikely to be completely effective in forcing disclosure of all relevant information. Therefore, in the absence of effective signalling mechanisms in IPOs, outside investors are likely to be convinced that accurate information disclosure has occurred only if a third party, with reputational capital at stake,has asserted such and will be adversely and materially affected if that assertion provesfalse.  \n\nSpecifically, for third-party certification to be believable for outside investors, three tests must be met. First, the certifying agent must have reputational capital at stake which would be forfeited by certifying as fairly priced an issue which was actually over-valued. Second, the value of the agent's reputational capital must be greater than the largest possible one-time wealth transfer or side payment which could be obtained by certifying falsely. Third, it must be costly for the issuing firm to purchase the services of (lease the reputational capital of) the certifying agent, and this cost must be an increasing function of the scope and potential importance of the information asymmetry regarding intrinsic firm value.  \n\nThere are strong a priori reasons to believe that all three of these tests are met by venture capitalists and that the certification they can provide will have value in an IPO. First, as the Venture Capital Journal (VCJ) (1988) makes clear, many of the more established venture capitalists bring companies in their portfolio to market on an ongoing basis as well as participating, over time, in a stream of direct equity investments in entrepreneurial firms. In our sample, 53 venture capitalists bring more than five firms public from 1983 to 1987. Venture capitalists, therefore, have a very strong incentive to establish a trustworthy reputation in order to retain access to the IPO market on favorable terms. Furthermore, the greater a venture capital fund's perceived access to the IPO market the more attractive it will be to entrepreneurs, thus assuring a continuing deal flow. Finally, a reputation for competence and honesty will allow venture capitalists to establish enduring relationships with pension fund managers and other institutional investors who are vitally important as investors in venture capital funds and as purchasers of shares in IPOs.  \n\nSupport for the second criterion, that the value of venture capitalists' reputational capital must exceed the maximum possible benefit from certifying falsely, is provided by Sahlman (1990). He documents that (1) successful venture capitalists are able to achieve very high returns on relatively modest capital outlays; (2) these returns are directly related to the age and historical performance of the VC fund, as well as to the size of its investment portfolio;  \n\n(3) successful VC fund managers are able to establish profitable “follow-on\" funds and are also able to achieve an enhanced deal flow from entrepreneurs; and (4) the VC fund manager market is a relatively small, tight-knit, and efficient labor market where individual performance is constantly monitored and valued. Therefore, the investment in reputational capital by venture capitalists allows them to remain competitive in the venture capital industry as well as the capital markets.  \n\nIn addition to venture capitalists’ investment in reputational capital, they also are large shareholders in the issuing firm. One way in which they might profit from false certification and take advantage of the high price is to sell shares in the IPO. Retention by venture capitalists of their holdings after the offer, therefore, can act as a bonding mechanism for credible certification.  \n\nThe final criterion for third-parity certification to be successful or economically valuable is that the services of the certifying agent must be costly for the issuing firm to obtain and the cost structure must be such that a separating equilibrium is achieved between high and low information quality firms. Venture capitalists certainly appear to meet this test since the bundle of services they provide--including financial capital, managerial and technical expertise, enhanced access to other financial specialists as well as certification when the firm ultimately goes public--is both very costly and very difficult to obtain. For example, Morris (1987), Gartner (1988), and Sahlman (1990) all demonstrate that venture capitalists expect to earn a compound annual return of from 25 to over 50 percent (depending upon the stage of the investment) on their investments in private companies. Therefore, entrepreneurs typically hand over large holdings of equity in exchange for relatively small cash infusions.  \n\nNor is this the only cost of VC investment for entrepreneurs. In addition to very high required rates of return, venture capitalists invariably structure their investments in such a way that most of the business and financial risk is shifted to the entrepreneur. As described in Golder (1987), Testa (1987), and Sahlman (1988, 1990), venture capitalists employ rather draconian features in their capital investments, including (l) the use of staged investment under which the venture capitalist retains the right to cancel (cease funding) an entrepreneur's venture; (2) the use of convertible preferred stock as an investment vehicle, which gives the venture capitalist both a claim senior to that of the entrepreneur and an enforceable nexus of security covenants;1 and (3) the retention by the venture capitalist of the option to replace the entrepreneur as manager unless key investment objectives are met.  \n\nThe cost and stringency of VC investment, as well as the sheer difficulty in obtaining it (venture capitalists typically fund less than one percent of all the proposals they receive), implies that only those firms which would benefit most from the services venture capitalists provide will be willing and able to accept such participation. While the role of venture capitalists in the firm is obviously not limited to their activity at the IPO, one of the services that entrepreneurial firms purchase with VC funding is easier access to capital markets and the ability of venture capitalists to reduce asymmetrical information in the offering process. Logic suggests that growth options which are characterized by both greater information asymmetry and uncertainty are more likely to be associated with new entrepreneurial firms than with older, more established companies. Therefore, the certification function of venture capitalists should be most attractive to relatively young, rapidly growing, research and development-intensive companies. This being the case, we expect such firms to make greater use of VC than do other firms.2  \n\nThe model of VC certification in IPOs developed above yields three testable hypotheses. First, since the ongoing nature of venture capitalists involved with firms going public builds relationships with all participants in the offering process, VC backed IPOs should have higher quality underwriters and auditors as well as a larger institutional following than comparable non-VC backed firms. Second, the ability of venture capitalists to reduce the information asymmetry associated with a firm involved in the offering process should result in a reduction of both the underpricing associated with the issue as well as the costs of underwriter, legal, auditor, and other miscellaneous expenses. If venture capitalists are able to convey credible information about the firm, the compensation to investors, underwriters, and auditors will be reduced since their cost of acquiring information about the company (personally certifying the issue) will be lowered. Finally, an additional bonding mechanism that ensures that venture capitalists’ certification is credible is the level of their capital investment in the firm both before and after the offer. Venture capitalists who retain significant holdings in the firm give up the opportunity to profit from false certification. Therefore, we hypothesize that venture capitalists will not be selling a large portion of their shares in the IPO.  \n\n### I1. Sample Selection Criteria  \n\nIn order to test the certification role of venture capitalists in the IPO market, we match a sample of 320 VC backed firms with 320 non-VC backed firms in the same industry as closely as possible by offering size.  \n\nThe universe of 2,644 firm commitment IPOs issued from January 1983 through September 1987 from which the matched sample is constructed is obtained from Investment Dealer's Digest Corporate Database (IDD). After eliminating financial institutions, S&Ls, reverse LBOs, and firms whose first day trading price is unavailable from Standard and Poor's Daily Stock Price Record: Ouer-the-Counter, the remaining sample consists of 1,833 offers.3  \n\nInitially, 390 VC backed offers issued from January 1983 through September 1987 were identified in the Venture Capital Journal which reports IPOs of VC backed firms with offering amounts of $\\$3$ million or more and offer pricesof atleast $\\$5$ . In order to be included in our 'sample, the VC backed firm must be contained in the screened IDD sample and must also have an offering prospectus available from Bechtel Information Service. Furthermore, any VC backed firm that is either misclassified as having venture capital participation from the prospectus or has other confounding events at the time of the IPO, such as an acquisition, is also eliminated.4  \n\nGiven that venture capital activity and the level of returns on the first trading day (see Ritter (1984)) tends to be clustered by industry, we match the sample of VC backed firms as closely as possible by offering amount to non-VC backed firms in the same three-digit SIC classification.5 The final sample consists of 320 VC backed and 320 non-VC backed firms.6 Table I documents the concentration of VC backed IPOs in certain industries. The majority of the sample falls within 11 separate industries with a large concentration in the high technology area. In addition, as shown in Table II, there are no apparent differences in the number of offerings in each year between VC backed and non-VC backed firms.  \n\nTable IHI reports the differences in offering and firm characteristics for VC versus non-VC backed IPOs using a standard $t$ test as well as a van der Waerden nonparametric test. Even though firms within the same industry are matched as closely as possible on the offering amount, VC backed IPOs, on average, have higher offering amounts (\\$19.7 million versus $\\$13.2$ million) and offer prices (\\$11.18 versus $\\$10.16$ than non-VC backed IPOs. In fact, the majority of IPOs with the largest offering amounts in specific industries tend to be VC backed firms.  \n\nA comparison of the preceding year's revenue of the VC sample and the control sample indicates that the sample is well matched in terms of operating revenues. VC backed IPOs have $\\$37.1$ million in revenue reported for the previous year while non-VC backed offers have a slightly higher revenue of  \n\n4We define an inside shareholder (listed in the prospectus) as a venture capitalist if (1) the prospectus notes define him as such or (2) the shareholder is clearly a company and has the word \" venture,\"capital'\" or “investment company” in its title.  \n\n$^5\\mathrm{In}$ our matching criteria, we attempted to follow the same offering characteristics as the Venture Capital Journal (price $\\geq\\$5$ and amount offered $\\geq\\$3$ million). Due to the large concentration of VC backed firms in the Office, Computing $\\&$ Accounting Machines industry as well as the Electronic Components $\\&$ Accessories industry,we included 18 non-VC backed IPOs that had either prices less than \\$5 or offering amounts less than \\$3 million. If we exclude these smaller firms from the control sample our results do not change.  \n\nAs a sensitivity test to the choice of control sample selection, we compared the results using the matched sample to the results utilizing all of the 496 non-VC backed firms that are in the same industries as the VC backed sample and met the Venture Capital Journal criteria. Our results using the sample of allnon-VCbacked firms in the same industries donot materially differ. This screen, however, tends to overrepresent some industries which have a low percentage of VC backed firms but a large number of IPOs and underrepresents the industries mentioned in thepreviousfootnote.  \n\n# TableI SIC Classification For Venture Capital and Non-Venture Capital Backed IPOs  \n\nSIC classification and percentage of the total sample in each industry for the matched sample of 320 VC backed and 320 non-VC backed IPOs issued from January 1983 through September 1987 as identified from Investment Dealer's Digest Corporate Database and the Venture Capital Journal.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>SIC Code</td><td>Classification</td><td>Number ofIPOs</td><td>Percentage ofIPOs</td></tr><tr><td>283 357</td><td>Drugs</td><td>30 154</td><td>4.7% 24.1%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Office,Computing&Accounting Machines</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>366</td><td>CommunicationEquipment</td><td>30</td><td>4.7%</td></tr><tr><td>367</td><td>ElectronicComponents&Accessories</td><td>48</td><td>7.5%</td></tr><tr><td>382 384</td><td>Measuring& ControllingInstruments</td><td>12 26</td><td>1.9% 4.0%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Surgical,Medical&DentalInstruments &Supplies</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>581</td><td>EatingandDrinkingPlaces</td><td>14</td><td>2.2%</td></tr><tr><td>599</td><td>RetailStoresNotElsewhereClassified</td><td>10</td><td>1.6%</td></tr><tr><td>737</td><td>ComputerandDataProcessingServices</td><td>70</td><td>10.9%</td></tr><tr><td>739</td><td>Miscellaneous Business Services</td><td>52</td><td>8.1%</td></tr><tr><td>808</td><td>(Biotech andPharmaceuticalEngineering) OutpatientCareFacilities</td><td>10</td><td>1.6%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Other</td><td>184</td><td>28.7%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>640</td><td>100.0%</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTableII Number of VC Backed and Non-VC Backed IPOs By Year   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Year</td><td>Venture Capital Backed</td><td>Non-Venture Capital Backed</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1983</td><td>104 (32.5%)</td><td>137 (42.8%)</td><td rowspan=\"5\"></td></tr><tr><td>1984</td><td>47</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>1985</td><td>(14.7%) 36</td><td>(13.1%) 44</td></tr><tr><td>1986</td><td>(11.2%) 78</td><td>(13.8%) 58</td></tr><tr><td>1987</td><td>(24.4%) 55</td><td>(18.1%) 39</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>(17.2%) 320</td><td>(12.2%) 320</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n# TableIII Tests of Differences in Sample Descriptive Statistics for VC Backed and Non-VC Backed IPOsa  \n\nTests of differences in offering characteristics using a difference in means test and a van der Waerden normal scores test for the sample of 320 VC backed and 320 non-VC backed IPOs matched as closely as possible by industry and offering size.

This difference is insignificant using either a $t$ testorthevan der Waerden test. The average book value of assets is insignificantly different between VC backed firms $(\\$23.9$ million) and non-VC backed IPOs $\\$23,456$ million). The median, however, is larger for VC backed issues.  \n\nThe mean and median yearly growth in earnings per share does not significantly differ between the two samples, with VC backed firms having a somewhat higher average growth rate in earnings per share (EPS) of $76.8\\%$ than non-VC backed offers with an average of $65.5\\%$ . In addition, the average proportion of the book value of debt as a percentage of the book value of equity is not significantly different $(31.3\\%$ for VC backed firms versus $31.9\\%$ for non-VC backed firms). The median level of debt, however, is significantly higher for non-VC firms. Furthermore, VC backed firms have a significantly higher ratio of the book value of common equity to the book value of assets than non-VC firms $(41.7\\%$ versus $28.1\\%,$ under both tests.  \n\nMuscarella and Vetsuypens (1989) document a statistically significant negative relationship between the age of the firm and the corresponding initial return. They attribute their findings to the higher amount of publicly available information associated with older firms. In our sample, VC backed firms are younger in age than their non-VC backed counterparts. The average number of years from the incorporation date to the offer date is 8.6 years for VC backed IPOs and 12.2 years for non-VC IPOs, and these differences are significant under both tests. The difference in ages between the two samples supports the role of venture capitalists in reducing information asymmetry. Venture capital participation and the associated certification allow the firm to go to the public market sooner than non-VC backed companies.7  \n\n### I11. Underwriters, Auditors, and Institutional Holdings  \n\nAs the firm approaches the public offering for the first time, it has the task of hiring underwriters and auditors to manage the issue as well as to certify the information in the prospectus. After the preliminary prospectus is filed with the SEC, the management of the firm travels with the underwriter on a \"road show\" to provide information as well as to generate interest with institutional investors for the IPO. In general, searching for underwriters and auditors is both costly and time-consuming for firms wishing to go public. For the VC backed firms, however, it is likely that the venture capitalist has been involved with other IPOs in the past and will have built relationships with underwriters, auditors, and institutional shareholders. Furthermore, each of these participants can infer information concerning the IPO from their prior experience with the venture capitalist. Because venture capitalists have reputational capital at stake in both their ability to maintain access to the public capital markets and to attract entrepreneurial firms for investment in the future, they have an incentive to reveal information truthfully about the new issue. This being the case, VC backed firms should attracthigher $\\cdot$ quality underwriters and auditors since it both lowers these participants’ cost of due diligence and protects their own reputational capital. The venture capitalists’ association with high quality underwriters, in turn, will increase their ability to place the issue with institutional managers.  \n\n#### A. Frequency of Underwriter Use By Venture Capitalists  \n\nAn assumption of the certification role of venture capitalists is that they build valuable relationships with underwriters that would be forfeited if they certified falsely. Table IV shows that many of the venture capitalists in the sample are frequent participants in the IPO market. As mentioned previously, 53 of the venture capitalists in our sample bring five or more issues to  \n\nAdmittedly, the differences in the financial and operating characteristics at the time of the IPO between the two samples cannot be solely attributed to the presence of venture capitalists. From the information publicly available about the control firms, we are unable to determine if the non-VC backed companies attempted to obtain venture capital financing and were turned down or simply did not need that type of capital.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Most Frequent Underwritersb Percentage of issues the VC is the leada 27% the Board of Directors issues the VC is on 50% Number of Issues Brought to Market 2 Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers</td><td>Hambrecht & Quist (14) Robertson, Colman (9) Robertson, Colman (5) Hambrecht & Quist (8) Robertson, Colman (5) Robertson, Colman (9) Colman (6) Morgan Stanley (7) Morgan Stanley (6) Morgan Stanley (5) Morgan Stanley (6) .F.Rothschild (3) .

Furthermore, many venture capitalists, such as Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield, and Byers, are involved in more than 10 issues during these 5 years. In many cases, the venture capitalist uses the same underwriter for more than one issue.8 Out of the 15 IPOs issued with Mayfield Fund as one of the venture capitalists, nine are underwritten by Robertson, Coleman.  \n\nAlso documented in Table IV is the board participation of venture capitalists in the offering firm. The more active venture capitalists frequently have seats on the board of directors as well as acting as lead venture capitalists.9 Given their active participation in the operations of the issuing firm, venture capitalists are likely to influence the choice of underwriter as well as reduce the amount of information asymmetry regarding the firm by certifying the value of the issue to the underwriter.  \n\n#### B. Underwriter and Auditor Quality  \n\nWe measure the quality of each underwriter as the percentage of the total dollar amount brought to market of all 2,644 offers $\\mathbf{(\\$70.3$ billion)classified as IPOs in Investment Dealers’ Digest Corporate Database from January 1983 through September 1987. If the issuing firm has more than one lead underwriter indicated in the IDD database, the average of the lead underwriters’ market share is used as the measure of quality. In measuring the quality of the underwriter we are assuming that the greater the average market share of the lead underwriters, the higher is the quality.10  \n\nTable $\\mathbf{v}$ presents the results on underwriter and auditor quality. On average, VC backed firms go public with underwriters who have a significantly greater percentage of the IPO market than do underwriters of non-VC backedfirms $(4.4\\%$ versus $3.0\\%$ 0. Furthermore, underwriters in VC backed firms are also involved in more offers (62) than underwriters in non-VC backed firms (53). These results indicate that VC backed firms are under  \n\n8Note that many of the firms in the VC backed sample have both a syndicate of venture capitalists involved in the company as well as an underwriting syndicate involved in the offering. For this reason, there is some double counting in the number of issues brought to market by each venture capitalist as well as in the frequency of underwriting.  \n\n9We define the venture capitalist as the lead if he holds the largest stake of all venture capitalists in the issuing firm.  \n\n10Simon (1990) also uses this method in computing underwriter reputation. A comparison of our method using the market share of the underwriter as a measure of quality and the rankings calculated by Carter and Manaster (1990) is presented in Appendix A. We choose to use our method for two reasons. First, the Carter and Manaster sample ends in the year this sample begins. If we were to use the Carter and Manaster rankings, we would be assuming that the reputational capital of investment bankers does not change over time. However, this may not be thecaseasevidencedbytheresultsofBeattyandRitter(1986)and therecentdeclineof some firms in the investment banking community, most notably Drexel Burnham Lambert. Second, usingthemarket share of theunderwriterratherthanarankingresultsin cardinal ratherthan ordinal values. A comparison of our measure of quality with those of Carter and Manaster resultsin a high degree of positive correlationbetween the two.  \n\n# Table V Tests of Differences in Mean Institutional Holdings, Average Market Share of Lead Underwriters and Auditor Quality for VC Backed and Non-VC Backed IPOsa  \n\nTests of differences in institutional holdings from Spectrum 3: Institutional Holdings at the end of the first quarter following the offer date, the lead underwriters’ market share and auditor quality for the sample of 320 VC backed and 320 non-VC backed IPOs matched by industry and size using a difference in means test and a van der Waerden normal scores test. The market share of each lead underwriter is computed using the full 2,644 IPOs in the IDD sample from 1983 to 1987.

The market shares of all lead underwriters for a particular IPO are then averaged.

In this case, auditor quality is measured by whether or not the firm uses a “Big Eight” accounting firm.11 Eighty-three percent of VC backed firms and $64\\%$ of the non-VC backed firms use Big Eight auditors at the IPO indicating that VC backed IPOs are able to attract higher quality auditors than non-VC backed firms.  \n\n#### C. The Level of Institutional Holdings  \n\nIn addition to attracting higher quality auditors and underwriters in the IPO, we hypothesize that the presence of venture capitalists and the quality of the investment banker will be used to elicit institutional interest. If both venture capitalists and underwriters certify the offer price, then the cost of acquiring information by institutional shareholders will decline. This being the case, we expect VC backed firms to have higher fractions of their shares held by institutions than non-VC backed companies.  \n\nData on institutional holdings are available on a quarterly basis and are collected from Spectrum 3: 13(f Institutional Stock Holdings Survey which reports the number of shares held by institutional managers who control $\\$100$ million or more in equity. As shown in Table V, the average percentage of IPOs held by institutions at the end of the first quarter of the offer is significantly higher for VC backed IPOs than for non-VC backed IPOs using both a differences in means test and the van der Waerden normal scores test. Institutions hold, on average, $42.3\\%$ of the offer in VC backed firms as comparedto $22.2\\%$ of the amount offered in non-VC backed firms. In addition, the average number of institutional managers who hold shares in the VC backed firm is 10.2 compared to 5.4 for non-VC backed firms.12  \n\nIn summary, our results indicate that VC backed firms have higher quality underwriters and auditors as well as a larger institutional following than do non-VC backed offers. We attribute these findings to the ability of venture capitalists to certify the quality of the firmby their historical investment in reputational capital, as well as to their capacity to build and maintain relationships with underwriters, auditors, and institutional managers through their ongoing involvement in other IPOs.  \n\n## IV. Tests of Venture Capitalist Certification  \n\nTwo testable implications of the certification hypothesis as it pertains to venture capitalists are that the level of underpricing and the amount of compensation to underwriters (and others) will be less for VC backed firms than non-VC backed firms. If venture capitalists are able to reduce the information asymmetry between both potential investors and underwriters, the level of compensation to these participants for acquiring information will be lowered. This being the case, initial returns and gross spreads for VC backed firms should be lower than for non-VC backed IPOs.  \n\nA. Differences in Initial Returns, Underwriter Compensation, and the Costs of GoingPublic  \n\nTable VI provides evidence in support of the hypothesis that VC backed IPOs have lower initial returns, gross spreads, and miscellaneous offering expenses than non-VC backed offers. Initial returns are calculated as the first closing or bid price recorded in Standard and Poor's Daily Stock Price Record: Ouer-the-Counter minus the offer price divided by the offer price. Underwriter compensation is defined as the gross spread as a percentage of the offer price. Miscellaneous offering expenses include such expenditures as auditor, legal, printing, and registration fees and are also measured as a percentage of the offer price.  \n\nConsistent with the certification hypothesis, as indicated by the results in Panel A of Table VI, the average intitial return for VC backed IPOs is $7.1\\%$ comparedto $11.9\\%$ for the matched sample of non-VC backed IPOs, and the difference in initial returns is statistically significant under both tests. A comparison of the number of issues that have positive returns yields no apparent differences between the control sample and the VC backed IPOs. On average, $61.2\\%$ of VC backed firms and $60.3\\%$ of non-VC backed issues experience positive returns on the first trading day.  \n\nThe significant difference in first trading day returns using a matched sample contrasts with the results found in the study by Barry et al. (1991) which finds no significant differences in underpricing for VC backed IPOs versus a sample of non-VC backed firms offered from 1983 through 1987 that are announced in The Wall Street Journal. In order to compare our findings with theirs, we construct a control sample of all non-VC backed IPOs from IDD that have offering amounts of $\\$3$ million or more and offer prices of at least $\\$5$ . This control sample results in 991 firms.13 Using all IPOs that meet the VCJ criteria as a control sample replicates as closely as possible the non-VC sample of Barry et al. In Panel B of Table VI, we find comparable insignificant differences in initial returns to VC backed $(7.1\\%)$ and non-VC backed firms $(7.6\\%)$ . We attribute the differences in initial returns between our sample and theirs to their construction of the non-VC backed sample and corresponding lack of an adequate industry control. While we cannot determine the number of firms in the Barry et al. sample that are in industries without venture capital participation, approximately $50\\%$ of the non-VC firms that replicate their study which meet theVCJ criteria are in industries with no venture capital participation whatsoever.  \n\nAlso presented in Table VI is the average compensation, or gross spread, as a percentage of the offer price, paid to underwriters by the matched sample of  \n\n# TableVI Tests of Differences in Initial Returns and Offering Expenses for VC Backed and Non-VC Backed IPOs  \n\nTests of differences in initial return using a difference in means test and a van der Waerden normal scores test for (1) the sample of all (991) non-VC IPOs with offer prices $>=\\$5$ and amountoffered $>=\\$3$ million and the 320 VC backed firms and (2) for the matched sample of 320 VC backed and 320 non-VC backed issues matched by industry and offering size.Also presented are differences in offering expenses and total proceeds (excluding overallotment). Initial returns are defined as the first trading day close or bid price recorded in Standard and Poor's Daily Stock Price Record: Ouer the Counter minus the offer price divided by the offer price.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Venture Capital Backed</td><td>Non-Venture Captital Backed</td><td>Difference in Means t-stat</td><td>van der Waerden Z Score</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\">Panel A: Comparison of the Matched Sample of VC Backed and Non-VC Backed IPOs</td></tr><tr><td>Number of firms Mean initial return</td><td>320 7.1% [2.5%]</td><td>320 11.9% [3.6%]</td><td>-3.62*</td><td>-1.87**</td></tr><tr><td>PercentageofIPOswith positive initial returns Averagegrossspreadas asapercentage ofthe</td><td>61.2% 7.4% [7.1%]</td><td>60.3% 8.2% [7.3%]</td><td>-7.82*</td><td>-6.14*</td></tr><tr><td>offerprice Averageofmiscellaneous offering expenses as a</td><td>3.6% [3.0%]</td><td>4.3% [3.6%]</td><td>-3.50*</td><td>-3.11*</td></tr><tr><td>percentageoftheofferpricea Ratio of net proceeds to the offering amountb</td><td>0.89 [0.90]</td><td>0.87 [0.88]</td><td>7.28*</td><td>6.44*</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Ratio of net proceeds to 0.84 0.80 the first trading day amountb,c [0.86] [0.83]</td><td>4.97*</td><td>4.02*</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\">Panel B:Comparison of VCBacked IPOs and All Non-VCBacked Firms withPrice≥$5andAmountOffered≥$3million</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">991 7.6% [1.6%]</td><td rowspan=\"2\">-0.52 -0.86</td><td rowspan=\"2\"></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Number of firms 320 Mean initial return 7.1% [2.5%]</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\naMiscellaneous offering expenses include such expenditures as auditor, legal, printing, and registrationfees.  \n\n${\\mathbf{\\bar{o}_{N e t}}}$ proceds is defined as the offering amount minus underwriter fees and miscellaneous offering expenses.  \n\ncThe first trading day amount is calculated as the number of shares offered multiplied by the first trading day price.  \n\n\\*Significant at the 0.01 level.  \n\n\\*\\*Significant at the 0.05 level.  \n\nVC backed and non-VC backed firms. The gross spread consists of underwriting, selling, and managing fees. Inherent in the gross spread is the cost of due diligence as well as the potential probability of subsequent liability due to material omissions in the prospectus (Tinic (1988). The presence of venture capitalists lowers the underwriter compensation, for example, by lowering the underwriters’ cost of due diligence. The process of acquiring information about the firm as part of the due diligence process will be easier if the venture capitalist has a reputation for having fairly represented information to the underwriter about firms in prior IPOs. Furthermore, venture capitalists may be more efficient in disseminating information than owners in a non-VC backed firm because unlike other firms issuing equity for the first time, they have prior experience in going public. As hypothesized, the compensation paid to the underwriter as a percentage of the offer price is significantly lower for VC backed firms $(7.4\\%)$ than for non-VC backed IPOs $(8.2\\%)$  \n\nThe percentage of miscellaneous offering expenses paid as auditor, legal, printing, and registration fees is related to the level of underwriter compensation in VC and non-VC backed firms. Using a similar argument as that for underwriter compensation, we expect that continuing relationships of venture capitalists with other participants such as auditors and attorneys will also lower the expenses of obtaining legal counsel, auditing services, and printing. As expected, the average of miscellaneous expenses as a percentage of the offer price is significantly lower for VC backed firms $(3.6\\%)$ than non-VCbackedfirms $(4.3\\%)$  \n\nGiven that the level of initial returns and the expenses associated with the offering are less for VC than for non-VC backed offers, the implication is that the net proceeds (the amount offered excluding the overallotment option minus the underwriter compensation and miscellaneous offering expenses) to the firm should be higher for firms with venture capital participation. In other words, the total costs of going public should be lower for VC backed issues than for their non-VC backed counterparts. Ritter (1987) has defined the costs of going public as both the direct offering expenses and the underpricing associated with the IPO. In order to measure the percentage of the offering amount that the firm is able to keep, we calculate two ratios: (1) the ratio of the net proceeds to the offering amount which measures the percentage of the offer that the firm retains after offering expenses and (2) the ratio of the net proceeds to the first trading day amount which incorporates the total effect of both underpricing and offering expenses on the proceeds to the issuing firm. (The first trading day amount is calculated as the number of shares offered multiplied by the closing or bid price on the first trading day.) Using the ratio of the net proceeds to the amount offered, VC backed firms, on average are able to keep $89\\%$ of the amount offered after all offering expenses compared to non-VC backed firms which retain $87\\%$ . The ratio of the net proceeds to the first trading day amount, which measures the total costs of going public, is higher for VC backed firms $(84\\%)$ than for non-VC backed IPOs $(80\\%)$ . Both of these ratios are significantly different using the $t$ test and the van der Waerden test. In other words, after taking into effect both the direct (offering expenses) and indirect (underpricing) costs of going public, non-VC backed firms are able to retain a higher proportion of the total issue.  \n\n### B. OLS Regression Analysis  \n\nTests of the certification hypothesis as it applies to initial returns and gross spreads using a regression analysis are presented in Tables VII and VIII. We examine the relationship of both initial returns and gross spreads to the following variables:  \n\n(1) A dummy variable for whether or not the issue is VC backed (TYPE). The level of initial returns should be lower for VC backed issues $({\\mathrm{TYPE}}=1)$ than for non-VC backed offers $\\begin{array}{r}{\\left(\\mathrm{TYPE}=0\\right)}\\end{array}$ 0. In addition, we hypothesize that the presence of venture capitalists certifies the issue and lowers the cost of due diligence. Therefore, there should be a negative relationship between the dummy variable and both initial returns and gross spreads.   \n(2) The natural log of the amount offered (LOGAMT). Ritter (1984) has documented a significant relationship between the size of the offering and initial returns. Since VC backed firms tend to be larger in terms of offering amount, controlling for size allows us to measure the relative influence of VC backing. If the presence of venture capitalists lowers initial returns, then the coefficient on this variable should be insignificant and negative. Furthermore, Ritter (1987) has documented  \n\n# Table VII  \n\nOLS Regressions of Initial Returns $(\\mathbf{R_{1}})$ against Whether or Not the Issue is VC Backed (TYPE), the Log of the Amount Offered (LOGAMT), the Average Market Share of the Lead Underwriters (MKTSHR), and the Age of the Firm (AGE) for the MatchedSampleof 320VCBacked and320Non-VCBacked IPOs during the Period 1983-1987a $R_{1}=\\alpha_{0}+\\alpha_{1}T Y P E+\\alpha_{2}\\bar{L}O G A M T+\\alpha_{3}M K T S H R+\\alpha_{4}A G E+e_{i}^{b}$   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"8\"></td></tr><tr><td>Regression</td><td>αo</td><td>α1</td><td>α2</td><td>α3</td><td>α4</td><td>R2</td><td>F-Statistic</td><td>Significance ofF-Test</td></tr><tr><td>(1)</td><td>0.137</td><td>-0.045</td><td>-0.008</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.018</td><td>5.7</td><td>0.0036</td></tr><tr><td>(2)</td><td>(5.81*) 0.116</td><td>(-2.95)* -0.412</td><td>(-0.84) 0.012</td><td>-0.847</td><td></td><td>0.044</td><td>9.7</td><td>0.0001</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(4.86)*</td><td>(-2.76)*</td><td>(1.19)</td><td>(-4.18)*</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>(3)</td><td>0.141 (5.66)*</td><td>-0.052 (-3.37)*</td><td>0.011 (1.03)</td><td>-0.722 ）(-3.55)*</td><td>-0.002 (-3.00)*</td><td>0.059</td><td>9.4</td><td>0.0001</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n$t$ -Statistics are given in parentheses.  \n\nbR1 $=$ percentage return from the offer price to the first trading day price,   \nTYPE $=$ dummy variable for whether the IPO is VC backed (VC backed $\\mathbf{\\lambda}=\\mathbf{1}$ ,non-VC backed $\\mathbf{\\mu}=\\mathbf{0}$   \nLOGAMT $=10\\mathrm{g}$ of offering amount (excluding the overallotment option) in millions,   \nMKTSHR $=$ average market share of all lead underwriters for a particular IPO defined as the percentage of all IPOs brought to market by each underwriter from 1983-1987 for the full sample of 2,644 IPOs, and   \nAGE $=$ age of the firm in years from incorporation date to offer date.   \n\\*Significant at the 0.01 level.  \n\nTable VIII OLS Regressions of Gross Spreads (GRSPD) against Whether or Not the Issue is VC Backed (TYPE), the Log Of the Amount Offered (LOGAMT), the Average Market Share of the Lead Underwriters (MKTSHR), and the Age of the Firm (AGE) for the MatchedSampleof 320VCBackedand 320Non-VCBacked IPOs during the Period 1983-1987a $G R S P D=\\alpha_{0}+\\alpha_{1}T Y P E+\\stackrel{-}{\\alpha_{2}}L O G A M T+\\alpha_{3}M K T S H R+\\alpha_{4}A G E+e_{i}^{\\mathrm{\\scriptsize~b}}$   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"7\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">Significance</td></tr><tr><td>Regression</td><td>αo</td><td>α1</td><td>α2</td><td>α3</td><td>α4</td><td>R2</td><td>F-Statistic</td><td>ofF-Test</td></tr><tr><td>(1)</td><td>0.106</td><td>-0.003</td><td>-0.011</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.600</td><td>474.9</td><td>0.0001</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">(2)</td><td>(109.53)*</td><td>(-4.31)*</td><td>(-28.48)*</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0.105</td><td>-0.002</td><td>-0.010</td><td>-0.052</td><td></td><td>0.622</td><td>349.7</td><td>0.0001</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">(3)</td><td>(108.94)*</td><td>(-4.09)*</td><td>(-22.99)*</td><td>(-6.35)*</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0.106</td><td>-0.003</td><td>-0.010 (108.40)*(-5.39)*(-22.69)*(-5.60)*(-6.20)</td><td>-0.045</td><td>-0.0001</td><td>0.649</td><td>277.4</td><td>0.0001</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\na t-Statistics are given in parentheses.  \n\nbGRSPD $=$ gross spread paid to the underwrter as a percentage of the offer prie,   \nTYPE $=$ dummy variable for whether the IPO is VC backed (VC backed $\\mathbf{\\lambda}=1$ , non-VC backed $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}=\\mathbf{0}$   \nLOGAMT $=$ log of offering amount (excluding the overallotment option) in millions,   \nMKTSHR $=$ average market share of all lead underwriters for a particular IPO defined as the percentage of all IPOs brought to market by each underwriter from 1983-1987 for the full sample of 2,644 IPOs, and   \nAGE $=$ age of the firm in years from incorporation date to offer date.   \n\\*Significant at the 0.01 level.  \n\neconomies of scale in the costs of going public. If this is the case, underwriter compensation should be negatively related to the size of theoffer.  \n\n(3)The average market share of the lead underwriters (MKTSHR). We include the market share of the underwriter in order to separate the effect of venture capital backing from the quality of the underwriter. In addition to the certification provided by venture capitalists, we expect that underwriters will also certify the issue. As in previous studies by Johnson and Miller (1988), Carter and Manaster (1990), and Simon (1990), we expect the market share of the underwriter, as a proxy for quality, to be negatively related to initial returns. In terms of the gross spread, we include the market share of the underwriter to control for the size of the underwriting firm.  \n\n(4) The age of the firm (AGE). Age is included in the regression equations as a control for the degree of information asymmetry. Similar to Muscarella and Vetsuypens (1989) we expect a negative relationship between initial returns and gross spreads. This implies that older firms have a lower degree of information asymmetry than do younger firms. Furthermore, if the age of the firm is positively correlated with information asymmetry, the cost of due diligence will decline. Therefore, there should also be a negative relationship between the age of the firm and the gross spread.  \n\n#### B.1. OLS Regression Results for Initial Returns  \n\nThe results in Table VII using the matched sample strongly support the certification role of venture capitalists in lowering initial returns. In all equations, the coefficient of TYPE is negative and statistically significant indicating that the presence of venture capitalists lowers initial returns in IPOs. Furthermore, the variable LOGAMT is insignificant. The market share of the underwriter (MKTSHR) as a proxy for underwriter quality is negative and significant at conventional levels. This result is consistent with the literature on underwriter certification and is complementary to those found in Simon (1990). As in Muscarella and Vetsuypens, the age of the firm is significant and negatively related to initial returns even though VC backed firms tend to be younger than their non-VC backed counterparts.14  \n\nIn other words, the presence of venture capitalists significantly lowers initial returns after controlling for the size of the issue as well as for the certification provided by the quality of the underwriter.  \n\n#### B.2. OLS Regression Results for Gross Spreads  \n\nWe measure the influence of VC backing on the compensation paid to the underwriter using the same independent variables as the OLS regression equation on initial returns. Table VIlI presents the results of the regression of gross spread on TYPE, LOGAMT, MKTSHR, and AGE. The gross spread is defined as the underwriter compensation as a percentage of the offer price. The coefficients on all variables are significant at conventional levels and negatively related to the gross spread. In other words, VC backing lowers the cost of underwriting the issue. As in Ritter (1987), there are economies of scale in going public with larger offering sizes having a lower percentage gross spread. The market share of the underwriter is also negatively related to the gross spreads and implies that, in our sample, higher quality underwriters charge lower gross spreads. Finally, the older the firm, and hence the lower the information asymmetry, the lower is the underwriter compensation.  \n\n14In order to compare our results for initial returns, we estimate the OLS equations using our proxy of 991 non-VC backed firms for the Barry et al. (1990) sample as a control sample. $\\mathbf{\\rho}_{t}$ statistics in parentheses)  \n\nThe results indicate an insignificant relationship between whether or not the firm isVC backed and initial returns. Furthermore, LOGAMT is insignificant and negative. The quality of the underwriter lowers initial returns as the coefficient on MKTSHR is negative and significant. Using the sample of all non-VC backed firms, regardless of industry, results in initial returns being inversely related to the quality of the underwriter and to the amount offered but unassociated with the presence of venture capitalists. The regression equation with age as an independent variable is not presented since the number of years from incorporation to the offer date is not available for all IPOs in the sample.  \n\nThe results of the two previous sections indicate that the presence of venture capitalists in an issuing firm certifies the offer to both investors and underwriters, which lowers the two most important components of the costs of going public: (1) underpricing and (2) underwriter compensation.  \n\n## V. Pre- and Post-IPO Holdings of Venture Capitalists  \n\nThe credibility of venture capitalists in certifying an IPO is conveyed both through their investment in reputational capital and by their financial holdings in the firm. This section examines the extent of insider holdings and sales at the time of the IPO by documenting the change in ownership structure associated with venture capitalists. The certification hypothesis predicts that venture capitalists will retain substantial holdings in the firm as a bonding mechanism for credible certification. In order to examine the selling behavior of venture capitalists at the time of the initial public offering, Table IX presents the pre- and post-offering characteristics of venture capitalist shareholdings.  \n\n### A. Pre-Offering Venture Capital Characteristics  \n\nAs a hedge against risk, the majority of VC backed firms have a venture capitalist syndicate with more than one venture capitalist as a shareholder of the firm prior to going public. As shown in Table IX, Panel A, the average holding by venture capitalists in a VC backed firm is $36.6\\%$ .Twenty-eight percent of the offers, or 89 IPOs, have venture capitalists owning $50\\%$ or more of the equity of the firm prior to going public. These pre-offering holdings of venture capitalists indicate a substantial equity position in the issuing firm prior to the offer.  \n\n### B. Post-Offering Venture Capital Characteristics  \n\nPanel B of Table IX presents the post-offering holdings of venture capitalists. The results indicate that venture capitalists retain a majority of their holdings after the IPO. Less than half $(43.3\\%)$ of VC backed IPOs have venture capitalists selling any of their shares in the offering. Furthermore, only three VC backed IPOs have venture capitalists selling $100\\%$ oftheir total shares in the offering. The mean percentage of venture capitalist holdings sold at the IPO is $8.0\\%$ . On average, $6.9\\%$ of the offering amount is composed of venture capitalists' sales.  \n\nIn order to compare the selling by venture capitalists with the sales by other insiders of the firm, we examine the percentage of the amount offered that is composed of secondary shares. Secondary shares are shares sold by insiders of the firm. Of the 181 VC backed IPOs that have secondary shares as part of the offering, on average, $39.6\\%$ of secondary sales are composed of venture capitalists' shares. The remaining secondary shares are sold by other inside shareholders.  \n\nAlso shown in Panel B of Table IX, venture capitalists suffer a dilution of their holdings after the offer. The decline in the percentage of equity held by venture capitalists is due to both the sales of VC shares at the IPO and the issuance of additional primary shares to the public. The fraction of equity held by venture capitalists in the issuing firm drops from $36.6\\%$ prior to the offering to $26.3\\%$ after the firm goes public. Furthermore, prior to the IPO, $28\\%$ of VC backed IPOs have venture capitalists owning $50\\%$ or more of the shares, but the number and fraction of VC backed IPOs with venture capitalists owning $50\\%$ or more after the offer falls to 27 or $8.4\\%$ . These results indicate that while a large number of venture capitalists give up voting control of the firm, the majority retain a significant portion of their holdings in the issuing firm. The large post-offering holdings of venture capitalists can be used as an additional sign of credibility at the time of the offer since venture capitalists forego the opportunity to profit directly from false certification.  \n\nTableIX Pre- and Post-Offering Characteristics of VC Holdingsa   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Pre-andPost-OfferingCharacteristicsofVCHoldings</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>AllVC IPOs (N = 320)</td></tr><tr><td>Panel A:Pre-Offering Characteristics</td><td>36.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Averagepercentageofequityownedbyall venturecapitalistspriortotheoffer</td><td>[36.3%]</td></tr><tr><td>Number ofIPOswhereventure capitalists own 50%or more of the shares prior to the offer</td><td>89 (28%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Panel B:Post-Offering Characteristics</td></tr><tr><td>Numberoffirmswhichhaveventure</td><td>139 (43.3%)</td></tr><tr><td>capitalists selling at the IPO Number of venture capitalists who sell</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>100% of their holdings</td><td>3 (0.9%)</td></tr><tr><td>Averagepercentage ofventure capitalists'</td><td>8.0%</td></tr><tr><td>holdingssoldattheIPO</td><td>[0.0%]</td></tr><tr><td>Averagepercentageoftheamountofferedthat</td><td>6.9%</td></tr><tr><td>is composed of venture capitalists’shares</td><td>[0.0%]</td></tr><tr><td>Average percentage of secondary shares</td><td>39.6%</td></tr><tr><td>sold by venture capitalists (only for the</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>181VCbackedIPOswith secondary shares)</td><td>[33.8%]</td></tr><tr><td>Average percentage of the firm held by</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>26.3%</td></tr><tr><td>venturecapitalistsaftertheoffer</td><td>[25.9%]</td></tr><tr><td>Number of IPOs where venture capitalists own 50%ormore of the shares after the offer</td><td>27 (8.4%)</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\na Medians in brackets.

Conclusions  \n\nThis paper provides support for the certification role of venture capitalists in bringing new issues to market by examining the impact of venture capitalists on the pricing and subsequent ownership structure of IPOs. The presence of venture capitalists in the offering firm certifies the quality of the issue through their investment in financial and reputational capital. A comparison of VC backed IPOs and a control sample of non-VC backed offers from 1983-1987, matched by industry and offering size, indicates that VC backed firms are significantly younger, have greater median book values of assets, and a larger percentage of equity in the capital structure than their non-VC backed counterparts.  \n\nOne assumption inherent in the certification hypothesis is the degree of repeat business venture capitalists have with the offering participants. Our results indicate that larger venture capitalists tend to use the same underwriters with great frequency. In addition, VC backed firms are able to attract higher quality underwriters and auditors as well as a larger institutional following than non-VC backed IPOs.  \n\nBy reducing the asymmetry of information between the issuing firm and investors and financial specialists such as underwriters and auditors, venture capitalists are able to lower the costs of going public. We find evidence of significantly lower underpricing and underwriter compensation, holding offering size, underwriter quality, and firm age constant for VC backed IPOs than for non-VC backed firms. Evidence on subsequent ownership structure of VC backed IPOs indicates that venture capitalists are not using the IPO as an opportunity to cash out of their holdings and realize a return on investment. Indeed, a majority of venture capitalists do not sell any of their holdings at the offer date.  \n\nAppendixA Comparison of the Top Underwriters by Dollar Amount Market Share to the Carter and Manaster (1990) Ranking   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Underwriter</td><td>Market Sharea</td><td>Carter and Manaster Rankings</td></tr><tr><td>MerrillLynchCapitalMarkets</td><td>22.3%</td><td>9.0</td></tr><tr><td>Lehman Brothers</td><td>17.9</td><td>8.0</td></tr><tr><td>SalomanBrothers</td><td>15.4</td><td>9.0</td></tr><tr><td>Goldman, Sachs and Co.</td><td>14.7</td><td>9.0</td></tr><tr><td>First Boston Corp.</td><td>13.9</td><td>9.0</td></tr><tr><td>E.F.Hutton</td><td>11.2</td><td>8.0</td></tr><tr><td>Morgan Stanley</td><td>9.4</td><td>9.0</td></tr><tr><td>Drexel Burnham Lambert</td><td>8.9</td><td>7.0</td></tr><tr><td>Prudential Bache Securities</td><td>7.9</td><td>8.0</td></tr><tr><td>Alex.Brownand Sons</td><td>7.4</td><td>7.5</td></tr><tr><td>Dean Witter Reynolds</td><td>6.8</td><td>8.0</td></tr><tr><td>Bear, Stearns and Co.</td><td>6.1</td><td>8.0</td></tr><tr><td>KidderPeabody and Co.,Inc.</td><td>5.6</td><td>8.0</td></tr><tr><td>Paine Webber</td><td>4.6</td><td>7.5</td></tr><tr><td>Lazard Freres and Co.</td><td>4.4</td><td>8.0</td></tr><tr><td>Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.</td><td>3.7</td><td>8.0</td></tr><tr><td>A.G.Edwards</td><td>3.5</td><td>6.5</td></tr><tr><td>Donaldson,LufkinandJenrette</td><td>3.4</td><td>7.0</td></tr><tr><td>L.

    "reference_markdown": "# Capital flows and the process of financial hegemony  \n\nBETH MINTZ & MICHAEL SCHWARTZ University ofVermont;StateUniversity of NewYork  \n\nAmong the most vexed issues in the sociology of business has been the identification of the conditions under which conflict has been resolved or unity established. Managerialists since Berle and Means have asserted the autonomy of the modern large corporation and this is the foundation for their assumption that capitalist class unity is impossible to achieve.1 Critics of this view, both Marxist? and non-Marxist3 have challenged the idea of business disunity without questioning the premise of corporate autonomy. They argue that united action is possible either through consensus of interest among firms, or by the imposition of common policy through state action.  \n\nRecent work, however, has questioned the assumption of corporate autonomy itself.4 Based on the notion that intercorporate relations are characterized by potentially coercive structural leverage, this new perspective argues that one firm or group of firms can impose united action upon others, even when such action is not in the narrow self-interest of the complying institutions.  \n\nCrucial to this view is the empirical proposition that the centralization of the financial sector (banks, insurance companies, and investment companies) allows for coordinated decision making over the disposition of investment capital.5 Because of the importance of outside funding in fueling economic expansion and weathering ongoing economic crisis, such centralized decision-making over capital flows confers upon financial leadership the intermittent capacity to coordinate activity among a wide range of economic actors. They, thus, achieve the capability of planning and executing economic and social policies that depend upon the compliance of other corporations (and even governments), even when such actions do not directly benefit all institutional participants. We have argued elsewhere6 that this phenomenon is properly understood as financial hegemony, using hegemony in the structural sense developed by Gramsci.7  \n\nThe importance of financial hegemony is its implications for economic and political policy formation. In large part, economic theorists have ignored the issue of planning, defending their inattention with the managerial assumption that autonomy makes explicit intercorporate coordination problematic and shortlived. Markets, therefore, are viewed as the capitalist proxy for planning.  \n\nInsofar as economic policy formation is studied, it has become a subdiscipline of political sociology. Underlying this focus is the pluralist assumption that the government has the mandate to regulate corporate activity and the power to impose its will on business, if necessary. Economic planning, therefore, occurs only when the government initiates it; it is never a consequence of independent action by business.8  \n\nThe theory of financial hegemony undermines this argument by focusing on those occasions when banks and insurance companies are able to impose policy upon resistant nonfinancial firms or actors. These decisions demonstrate the inadequacy of the assumption of autonomy and the corresponding weakness of any analysis that relies exclusively on the notion of a competitive market system.  \n\nMoreover, the structural leverage resulting from the concentration of investment capital can sometimes be applied to a broad spectrum of companies simultaneously, thus providing the power to implement economic policies without the intervention of the state. The theory of financial hegemony, therefore, provides the basis for a broad reorganization of our understanding of economic and political policies. To understand this process, we offer examples of the imposition of financial decisionmaking on three types of business units: individual firms, industrial sectors, and national economies.  \n\n## Sources of financial cohesion  \n\nAlthough commercial banks and insurance companies independently strive to maximize their profits, structural interdependencies have developed among them that tend to mute competition and contribute to a united financial community. While this unity is at times quite fragile, the long-run tendencies are toward similarity of interest and these firms therefore often constitute a cohesive unit in determining the direction of capital flows.  \n\nThe cohesion within the financial world is the result of the high concentration levels of investment capital. In the early 1970s, for example, the fifty largest banks in the United States held over two-thirds of lendable funds held by commercial banks; seven New York and Chicago moneymarket banks controlled about 20 percent of all bank assets.9 The second major source of commercial loan capital, life-insurance companies, are even more concentrated.  \n\nThis concentration of capital is translated into unity by a developing set of interdependencies among financial institutions. Short-term interbank borrowing creates a consonance of interest among banks, because each firm has a stake in the others' economic health. Loan consortia - the typical method for organizing large loans - are another mechanism for unity; they allow banks to share the risk inherent in very large loans while forcing a united financial posture toward the borrowing industrial firm. Concentration, interbank borrowing, and consortia all contribute to another unifying mechanism - similarity of investment portfolios both in terms of loans and stock. Aithough the details of a particular institution's holdings may vary, the overall profiles of the major institutions' investments are quite similar, thus creating an ongoing community of interests among major financials. While at times competitive tendencies override forces for cohesion, the long-term result is a rough consonance of interest among the largest creditors.  \n\nThe participation of major financial institutions in all industrial sectors and the consonance of interest among them provides the foundation for the financial hegemony that characterizes intercorporate relations. We explore this process below.  \n\n## Capital flows and the imposition of corporate policy by lenders  \n\nAlthough ultimately the impact of financial hegemony can be analyzed in terms of world-wide economic relations, the building block of the hegemonic process is found on the level of the individual corporation. It is on that level that financial institutions periodically attempt - not always successfully - to regulate corporate behavior. While this regulation is sporadic, it is frequently the only force within the business arena capable of constructing imposed coordination.  \n\nFinancial leverage typically rests on two major mechanisms: the control of loan capital and the stockholding of financial trust departments. While these work in different ways, both potentially affect the behavior of nonfinancial corporations in profoundly important ways.  \n\nThe most visible examples of bank influence over individual firms involve the intervention of lenders into the internal affairs of borrowers. A survey of the business press during the five-year period of 1 January 1977 to 31 December 1981 revealed reports of interventions in about 5 percent of the one thousand largest American companies including such firms as Braniff Airlines, Gulf Oil, Lockheed, and Mattel.10 Although outcomes of the intervention process are often unpredictable, the mechanism can be quite effective under appropriate circumstances.  \n\nThis point is nicely illustrated by the Hunt brothers’ attempt to corner the silver market in the late 1970s.1 Commodity futures markets are fragile structures, easily upset by a small number of participants with large resources.12 Futures contracts involve a promise to deliver a commodity at a precise future date at a particular price. When the date arrives, the buyer and seller typically settle accounts by comparing the agreed-upon price with the market price of that day. If the actual price is lower, the buyer pays the seller the difference; if the actual price is higher, the seller pays the buyer. No merchandise changes hands.  \n\nThe Hunts began buying silver in 1973 and by early 1980 had accumulated over 100 million ounces. They had entered the futures market only as buyers and when due dates arrived instead of negotiating the differences, they insisted upon delivery. Since sellers were forced to seek out silver to cover their contracts, scarcity created by the hoarding forced up prices. Essentially, the sellers were forced to buy silver from the brothers at very high prices and sell it back to them at the much lower contract price. The Hunts made a great deal of money on each transaction and continued to accumulate silver, thus pushing up the price still further.  \n\nIn response, the other silver traders united and changed the rules of the futures market. Potential buyers were forced to post a substantial proportion of the purchase price when the contract was signed. This drove many buyers out of the market (at least temporarily) causing a drop in the price of silver. When the Hunts' contracts came due, the sellers could find silver at much below the contract price, so the Hunts were faced with a serious dilemma. If they kept their silver and tried to buy their way out of the contracts, they needed close to $\\$1$ billion in cash.  \n\nIf they tried to sell to pay for the contracts, they would be dumping huge amounts of silver onto a depressed market, depressing it still further and producing even worse losses when the next contracts came due.  \n\nTheir best option, they decided, was to borrow money, cover their losses, and hope to push the price up again when the market adjusted to the new rules. The Hunts had sufficient collateral for the billion-dollar loan they sought. Placid Oil, the family company, was worth $\\$8$ billion with very little debt. Nevertheless, the lenders at first refused a rescue loan, largely because “bankers just weren't in the mood to bail the Hunts out.\"13 The bankers did not approve of the Hunts effort to upset the silver market.  \n\nWhen the rescue loan was finally negotiated, it contained specific provisions that forbade futures trading by the Hunts. The agreement stipulated the “gradual and orderly liquidation\" of their silver holdings and prohibited further “speculation in silver and other commodities.\"14 A spokesperson for Morgan Guaranty, the lead lender, promised close policing of the agreement, assuring the press that the banks would \"throw the loan into default\" and foreclose on Placid Oil if the Hunts engaged in further commodity speculation.15 Paul A. Volcker, Federal Reserve Chairman, was particularly gratified by the loan condition. Speaking just before the agreement was finalized, he pointed to its import in protecting the integrity of the futures market:  \n\nMr. Volcker said that if the refinancing — with its restrictive clauses -- went through, the public will be far better protected from further Hunt speculation. The restrictive clauses would hold during the life of the loan which, sources said, would be for a number of years.16  \n\nThis example illustrates several important features that make lender intervention one of the most important disciplinary devices in the corporate world. First, loan leverage is capable of altering the economic strategy of corporations or individuals. This leverage derives from the urgent needs of borrowers and the structural unity of lenders. The Hunts needed money quickly. They couid not shop around for lenders because of time pressure. They could not rely on inter-lender competition because almost all major loans are handled by consortia involving all of the major money-market banks capable of organizing such large transactions (see above).  \n\nSecond, lenders often have a great deal of discretion in organizing rescue loans. In the Hunt case, they did not have to lend the money. Or, because  \n\nPlacid Oil was worth many times the loan value, the banks could impose stringent conditions - even those that hindered profitability - without fear of losing their investment. Of course, many rescue loans are negotiated in more constrained circumstances. When a company is already heavily in debt, loan refusal might jeopardize the banks' original investment; stringent loan conditions might force bankruptcy. Lender discretion, therefore, is constrained by the particular circumstances at hand.  \n\nFinally, lenders can impose policies extraneous to their narrow concerns for repayment. The major conditions on the Hunt loan had little to do with guaranteeing repayment; they were designed to protect the integrity of the silver market. At least some of the time, therefore, banks enforce system needs upon recalcitrant firms or capitalists. As Paul Volcker suggested during the Hunt episode, the government was unable to control their speculation; only the lenders could rescue the market from “collapse.\"17  \n\nInstitutional stockholding has developed into a second mechanism by which banks influence the policies of nonfinancial corporations. As of 1979, institutional investors - banks, insurance companies, and investment houses - accounted for about 70 percent of the stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange.18 And, although accurate figures are difficult to obtain, these same institutions are thought to hold about 40 percent of the outstanding stock in the largest American corporations.19  \n\nInstitutional stockholding is highly concentrated. In 1974, the top seven money-market banks (Chase Manhattan, Chemical, Citicorp, Bankers Trust, Manufacturers Hanover, First Chicago and Continental Hllinois) - the same banks which dominate corporate lending - accounted for 40 percent of pension money and 25 percent of all trust department holdings. The top sixty bank trust departments held over two-thirds of bank trust assets.20 Fifty insurance companies held 34 percent of insurance assets and thirty-five mutual funds accounted for 65 percent of that industry's capital.21  \n\nLike lenders, institutional investors often coordinate their buying and selling of stocks. The business press refers to the “herd effect\"22 in which institutions “tend to follow a few of the very biggest and bestnamed firms. \"23 This unified buying and selling is the foundation upon which the power of institutional stockholders is constructed.  \n\nIf corporate prospects and policies please major institutions, they buy huge amounts of the stock, boost prices, and create a favorable financial climate for the firm. If corporate policy displeases them, or financial performance lags, they may dump stock, causing large declines in price, and thus hamstringing corporate activities.  \n\nThe most celebrated stock dumping incident in history was precipitated in 1969 by an attempt on the part of Leasco, a relatively small Long Island based conglomerate, to acquire Chemical Bank of New York.24 Leasco proposed to exchange a share of its stock, worth $\\$140$ ,for 1.25 shares of Chemical stock, worth about $\\$100$ . This was an attractive offer for Chemical stockholders, but the acquisition was thwarted when institutions began dumping Leasco shares. As a result, the conglomerate's price dropped to $\\$106$ in two weeks and to a low of $\\$7$ by the next year. This frustrated Leasco's acquisition attempt and limited its other expansion. Saul Steinberg, the head of the company, commented to Business Week, “I always knew there was an Establishment .. . I just used to think I was part of it.\"25  \n\nPerhaps the most important consequence of this relatively infrequent exhibition of institutional power is its deterrent effect: Business Week concluded that “\"some corporate managements tend to pander to institutional preferences and thus adopt whatever policies are favored by the money managers in large investment institutions.\"26 This confers upon major financials considerable power in setting or altering the policies of nonfinancial firms to conform to their interpretation of corporate health or broader system needs. The breadth of this process can be seen in the treatment of the “Nifty-Fifty.\"27  \n\nBetween 1965 and 1974 the institutional proportion of all stocks traded on the New York exchange increased from 39.3 percent to 58.9 percent.28 Much of this increase went into a handful of growth stocks known as the Nifty-Fifty, which included Avon, Coca-Cola, Eastman Kodak, IBM, MacDonalds and Xerox.29 As the prices of these stocks soared, the price-earnings ratios of many reached thirty-to-one. This meant that dividends paid only about 4 percent on investment; a viable profit was made by stockholders only if prices continued to rise.  \n\nBy the middle of the 1970s, stock prices had leveled off, even among this group. Between 1972 and 1978, twenty of these favorites had declined an average of 39 percent.30 These losses, combined with low dividend payouts,were a key factor in the poor performance of institutional investors during the period. At the same time, many of these companies had accumulated large amounts of retained earnings, partly because of their enormous growth and partly because of their low dividend payouts. IBM, Ford, and General Motors, for example, each held over $\\$2$ billion in unspent earnings.  \n\nWhile bank trust departments were showing poor returns because of the flat market, bank loan departments were caught in a lending bind. The retained earnings among Nifty-Fifty firms represented a capital surplus that removed the banks' best customers from the lending market, both because they were not borrowing as much and because they borrowed from each other on the commercial paper market.31  \n\nTo escape this double bind, bank trust departments abandoned their policy of investing in growth stocks and called for dividend increases. The business press announced the news: “the litany of advice emerging from Wall Street emphasizes low price earnings multiples and high current dividends.\"32  \n\nThe immediate result of this change was a further drop in Nifty-Fifty prices, because institutional stock dumping concentrated upon these low dividend stocks. But soon this decline was halted by a surge of dividend increases: “\"Today growth is out among big investors, total return is in, and so not only MacDonalds but Kresge, Johnson and Johnson, and American Hospital Supply have all hiked their dividends.'33  \n\nThe responsiveness of companies to the stock purchasing policies of major institutional investors allowed financial firms to organize a shift in dividend pay-out policy across the economy. This shift did more than improve portfolio performance in bank trust departments; it also contributed to a growing dependence of major industrials on bank loans. IBM, which dissipated much of its retained earnings in higher dividends and purchases of its own stock (designed to maintain stock prices), was forced to borrow nearly a billion dollars in 1979. Both Ford and GM found themselves short of the capital needed to finance the construction of fuel-efficient small cars that could compete with imports. Texas Instruments - despite its record as one of the most profitable American firms in the late 1970s - was pressed to borrow money in order to maintain its leadership in the high-tech field.34  \n\nUltimately, higher dividend pay-outs generated by institutional investors may have made a considerable contribution to the stagnation of the American economy in the early 1980s:  \n\nA number of analysts worry that companies may be undermining their financial health by pursuing too generous dividend policies. “In many cases, dividends are being increased even though earnings do not support or justify those increases,” says Arnold M. Kaufman, editor of Standard and Poor's Corporation's The Outlook... Clinging to set policies (of high dividend pay-out) in times of lagging earnings could prevent a company from investing in needed capital projects and force it to seek costly external financing.35  \n\nThese sketches suggest that institutional stockholders can exercise significant leverage over corporate policy. The Leasco example illustrates the impact of stock dumping on the level of the individual company while the increased dividend payouts of the Nifty-Fifty demonstrates the effectiveness of this strategy on groups of firms. The Business Week article quoted above suggests important implications for the economy as a whole: the increased dividends demanded by the institutional investors may have been implicated in fueling the 1979--1982 recession.  \n\nAt the same time, these examples illustrate that even extremely healthy firms can be subject to the demands of financial decision-making. The entry of Texas Instruments and IBM into the capital market in the late 1970s illustrates this point, and it also illustrates the interconnection between stock dumping and loan intervention, both of which create corporate responsiveness to the financial community.  \n\nThese mechanisms, of course, are situationally contingent. Occidental Oil's stock was dumped in the early 1970s and its price remained depressed throughout the decade because institutional investors disapproved of executive turnover produced by Armand Hammer's apparently capricious leadership. Hammer's large personal block of Occidental prevented an unfriendly takeover, a major consequence of deflated stock prices; and the oil boom kept Occidental out of the loan market. The firm, therefore, escaped corrective reform by disapproving bankers.36  \n\nSuch successful resistance is not uncommon, and it encourages further resistance among non-financial companies. The discipline imposed by financial institutions is, therefore, problematic and episodic. When many firms compete for scarce loan capital, and when maintaining stock prices is crucial, the discipline increases. When demand for funds is low and loan capital is plentiful - or when mergers are infrequent - the discipline loosens. At any moment, different companies, industries and even governments have different degrees of dependency on capital flows; and therefore they differ in responsiveness to the cues and dictates of financial firms.  \n\nStock dumping and loan intervention are two interrelated mechanisms that create and enforce corporate responsiveness to financial decision making. Though the process of policy enforcement is contingent, it is an important phenomenon in the business world, because financial leverage is often the major constraint upon the autonomy of the largest corporate actors.  \n\n## Financial impact on industrial sectors  \n\nAs distributors of investment capital, financial institutions are forced to judge the viability of a wide range of projects proposed by prospective borrowers. Often these judgments reach beyond the level of the firm and influence the trajectory of entire industries.  \n\nSuch judgments are certainly subject to larger forces in the economy - notably the discipline of the capital markets - and thus even moneymarket institutions are not autonomous actors in their own right. They are further limited by their inability to predict an uncertain future, a limitation that is endemic in all investment decision-making. Nevertheless, the critical role of capital as a resource and the potential for unity among major financial firms distinguish their actions - even when they are compelled by market forces -- from those predicted by the traditional market model of the economist. These differences can be usefully analyzed in the context of industry-wide consequences of financial decisionmaking. We consider the development of the nuclear-power industry in thiscontext.  \n\nThe first nuclear-power plant opened in 1959, with the number of new plants increasing steadily in the 1960s, spurred by the drastic increases in demand for electricity and by the capital intensity of the method.38 Compared to other ways of producing electricity, nuclear power involves enormous initial capital investment and very low fuel and operation expenses. This mix was particularly attractive to the industry because regulatory laws allow a guaranteed profit on the cost of construction of electrical plants but not on fuel and other operating expenses. The promiseof aguaranteed return oninvestment alsomeant that utilitieshad little difficulty obtaining the massive loans necessary to finance nuclear power.  \n\nBy 1974, however, the economic and energy crises of the period reduced the expansion of energy use drastically: the 7 percent annual increase that prevailed for two decades declined to 0.4 percent and remained under 4 percent thereafter. This flattening of demand meant lower than expected revenues, making it difficult to meet loan payments for projects under construction. (Costs of construction can be charged to rate payers only after a plant begins operation.)  \n\nAt about the same time, the public became aware of the financial and environmental problems associated with nuclear power. Protests in New Hampshire and elsewhere contributed to this growing concern, and led to more diligent enforcement of safety requirements. This added to the already massive cost of the plants and lengthened the already considerable delays in construction.  \n\nInflation exacerbated these problems and by the mid-1970s escalating costs became the focal problem of nuclear construction. Few plants were completed at less than 200 percent of their original cost estimates. Lilco's Shoreham plant on Long Island, originally projected to open in 1975 at a cost of $\\$271$ million, surpassed $\\$1.1$ billion early in 1979.39 By 1985, the still unopened plant was projected at $\\$4.2$ billion.40 Other projects had similar fates. Estimates of the capital costs of one kilowatt hour of nuclear power increased from $\\$185$ in 1970 to $\\$1861$ for plants in the early phases of construction in 1979.41 By 1985, the estimates were as high as \\$5,192.42  \n\nThese problems destroyed the nuclear-power plant market; after 1975, cancellations outnumbered new orders for the industry as a whole, and after 1977 there were no new orders at all.  \n\nThe Three Mile Island accident alarmed the public by crystallizing fears that nuclear power was a safety hazard. It alarmed the financial community because of fears that the massive construction costs would produce rates so high that consumers would reduce usage and therefore deprive utilities of the revenues necessary to repay loans. Two months after the accident, Business Week, announced the new posture of the financial community toward electrical utilities and nuclear power in particular:  \n\n\"The industry is standing at a bare-bones level of financial integrity,” frets Charles A. Benore, utilities analyst with Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins, Inc ... “\"their continuing ability to attract money is now in jeopardy. Lenders and investors are growing increasingly troubled by the industry's inability to boostprofits.\"42  \n\nIn the two months after Three Mile Island, the stocks of nuclear power utilities dropped 8.6 percent, and new stock issues were underpriced by as much as 15 percent. General Public Utilities, the owner of Three Mile Island, headed towards bankruptcy.44  \n\nStock prices continued to decline in 1979, and loans became more and more difficult to obtain. In May, Bank of America announced a policy of refusing all future loans for nuclear plants.45 Other banks were less militant in their posture because they were constrained by existing investment in projects that might fail without further cash infusions. Nevertheless, nuclear plants experienced broad declines in credit ratings and increases in interest rates. Before the end of 1979, eleven plants -- more than 10 percent of those on order - had been cancelled. Seventytwo others had experienced costly new delays.46  \n\nIn 1980, the crisis deepened further. Many utilities were unable to obtain funding and therefore cancelled construction contracts, sometimes after spending hundreds of millions of dollars. Even almost completed plants were vulnerable. The Seabrook, New Hampshire facility, site of the most celebrated protests, was virtually finished by 1979. It then experienced new delays while the member utilities sought rate increases, sold new stock issues, and recruited new partners in an attempt to cover withdrawn bank financing. $^{47}\\mathrm{~In~}1985$ it remained unopened. A consortium of 88 Pacific Northwest Utilities investment, because investors' portfolios were “glutted\" and their bonds were down-graded. Lenders had made it clear that without stopping construction of those plants, money would not be available for three other sites that were closer to completion.48 Ultimately construction of the other three plants was also halted, and the agency in charge of construction was forced into bankruptcy.  \n\nThese events illustrate both the broad-ranging impact of financial decision-making on industrial sectors and the limitations of financial power. The withdrawal of capital from nuclear plant construction - through the mechanism of loan refusal - announced the end of domestic nuclear projects and the reorientation of the utility industry toward other sources of electricity. The details of the reorientation were loosely orchestrated by the withdrawal of capital and, therefore, financial decisions were crucial components of the process.  \n\nThe collapse of the industry, however, appears to have been beyond the control of the financial community. It was forced to act lest it “\"throw good money after bad’ and lose an even larger investment later on. Similarly, the initial participation of financials in nuclear-plant construction may have been based on an equally forceful imperative: the appearance of an apparently viable and highly profitable opportunity. Both of these conditions were, at first glance, consistent with a traditional market model of corporate behavior. In first financing nuclear power, they were attracted to an industry that had an excellent credit rating, a promising construction program, rising demand, and government-guaranteed profit. This was a very impressive profile compared to other potential borrowers. In discontinuing their commitment, they were repelled by high debt ratios, low demand, and poor prospects for repayment. Nuclear power no longer compared favorably with other possible investments.  \n\nThe market was therefore an important constraint in defining the choices of major financial institutions. But it was not the only force at work. Consider, for example, the timing of the withdrawal of funding. Had lenders chosen to withdraw their support earlier, several billion dollars would have been saved; had the decision come later several additional plants would have been completed. Moreover, each plant under construction has now been subjected to an individual judgment by lenders: whether to fund its completion or discontinue support. These choices are conditioned, but not determined, by the market. No one, including the most informed analysts, could tell the exact moment when nuclear power became economically nonviable. In many cases, no one can be sure whether a particular plant is economically feasible (leaving safety issues aside). In many cases, “incorrect\" judgments were clearly made - in the case of the Shoreham Long Island plant, even Lilco now concedes that it was an unwise original commitment though they argue that it is now logical to complete it. There was, therefore, a large element of discretion coexisting with market forces in the decisions to discontinue nuclear-power plants and there was an equally large component of discretion in the earlier decisions to commit a large portion of the nation's investment capital to the development of nuclear power.  \n\nThis discretion was, by-and-large, exercised by the leadership of major lending institutions. The decisions were not made by the heads of utilities, who might be seen as technical experts; by government officials, who are the designated representatives of the public interest; or by any of a number of other groups that have some official claim to authority over nuclear power. Ironically, utility executives and almost every government official and agency (including three Republican and one Democratic President) fought to rescue the industry. Their efforts not only failed to prevent the failure of nuclear power, but they did little to alter the timing and the particularities of its demise. In case after case, the specific decisions were made by financial institutions in the context of judging financial viability. The responses of financial companies to investment opportunities are therefore conditioned by much more than traditional market mechanisms. The need for investment capital in all industrial sectors, the centralization of that capital, and the necessity for discretionary decision-making by the lenders means that banks and insurance companies do not simply react to market conditions, even in constrained circumstances like those connected to nuclear power. Instead, they become important actors in the creation of conditions.  \n\nIn some circumstances, financial institutions are faced with fewer market constraints and they, therefore, have wider levels of discretion and more input into the creation of market forces. These occasions are nicely illustrated by events in the shipbuilding industry during the 1970s, when banks first selected it as a promising investment outlet, and later changed their mind, with very costly consequences.49  \n\nIn 1967, Citibank issued a ten-year prospectus that advocated a great many of the financial developments of the 197os. Based on this document, the bank formed a holding company (Citicorp) which owned Citibank as well as other, nonbanking, subsidiaries. This allowed expansion into previously prohibited enterprises, and facilitated the institutional flexibility that Citicorp exploited during the 1970s to become the preeminent banking institution of the world.  \n\nThe most important investment policy that flowed from this prospectus was Citibank's program of expansion into the Third World, which we discuss below. A less central, but highly influential, innovation was the introduction of leasing as a lucrative device for managing new capital construction projects. This idea was applied with great vigor in the shipbuilding industry; Citicorp announced its intention to become “the principal bank of the world's major shipowners.\"50 By 1978, shipping represented 4.6 percent of Citicorp's loan portfolio, and other moneymarket banks had made similar commitments. In that year, the top ten American banks held over $\\$7$ billion in outstanding shipping loans.  \n\nIn negotiating these loans, the banks insisted that the builders lease the completed ships, rather than sell them or run them themselves. They insisted on signed leasing contracts before construction began, thus guaranteeing at least five years of revenues after completion. And they often demanded equity for themselves in the ships, in exchange for extremely favorable loan packages.  \n\nThe infusion of bank capital stimulated the ship-building industry and, by the early 1970s tanker capacity was growing at a very rapid rate. By 1973, however, world oil usage began to decline as a result of the oil crisis and shipping volume leveled off. At that time approximately 100 million tons of shipping capacity were under construction, and even the cancellation of many of these projects could not prevent an industry-wide recession. In 1978, with 20 million tons still being built, 15 percent of existing capacity lay idle. Long-term leases signed in the early 1970s began to expire without being renewed, and many ship owners could not repay bank loans.  \n\nThe banks were forced to reassess their commitment to ship-building. Peter Douglas, the chief economist at Chase Manhattan Bank, told a meeting of ship owners that they would henceforth be treated “more like borrowers and less like co-owners than they [were] in the past.\"'51 The major banks scrutinized each loan and each corporation, deciding on rescue or abandonment. The rescue terms were sometimes very generous - a British banker told Business Week: “\"We had to help out a few of our friends by giving moratoriums or rewriting loans.\"52 But abandonment also occurred: a French firm was forced to sell a four-year-old, $\\$30$ million super-tanker for \\$10 million; two others sold three supertankers for scrap. Two American corporations were sold at distress prices; and another, Pacific Far Eastern Lines, declared bankruptcy, leaving the United States government with $\\$98$ million in loan guarantees.  \n\nThese events illustrate the relation between capital suppliers and industrial sectors. In the late 1960s Citibank, and other major lenders were searching for investment opportunity and they selected tanker construction as a promising outlet for investment capital. This choice - one of many they might have selected - transformed the circumstances of builders, owners and leaseholders in the shipping industry. When the economic tide turned and the industry fell into recession, the lenders made a second set of decisions aimed at protecting their own investment. They selected firms for rescue - based both on their economic standing and on their relation to the banks - and others for abandonment. The abandoned companies were forced to find repayment funds - even if it meant wasteful- liquidation - or to declare bankruptcy.  \n\nWhile market conditions played a role in this process, the decision to select shipping out of many possible investment outlets had a discretionary component. Moreover, the decision-makers were the same set of actors who chose nuclear power for development, who lavishly funded aircraft manufacturers in the mid 1950s, who chose to lend to the Hunt brothers, and who redefined dividend rates of the nifty-fifty. And the discretion implicit in withdrawal from a sector - choosing which corporations are rescued under what conditions - are in the hands of these same institutions. The centralized nature of this decision making, then, presents itself as the loose ability to coordinate industrial activity. Though their effects are problematic and contingent, they are nevertheless a source for many general trends in economic development and changes in industrial profiles. And as the above examples demonstrate, selection of investments and the evaluation of loan renewals can have profound effects on industrial sectors.  \n\n## Financial decision-making and the shape of national economic policies  \n\nAs the world economy becomes increasingly integrated, the investment opportunities of American companies have broadened tremendously, reaching every corner of the globe. As foreign investment continues to expand, direct relations between banks and the governments have developed. The processes of bank hegemony that influence firms and industrial sectors, have now begun to apply to whole countries as well.  \n\nThis development can be traced in Citibank's ten year prospectus, mentioned above, which marked the beginning of a new era in international banking.53 During the 1970s, Citibank invested aggressively in overseas activities with a strong concentration in loans to the Third World - known in the business community as less developed countries (LDC's). Loan criteria were based on outlines in the original Citibank prospectus. First, lending limits for each country would be set in accordance with internal political and economic conditions, thus limiting over investment in a particular area.54 Second, to protect its investment against expropriation, Citibank, whenever possible, lent money to multinationals operating in these countries rather than directly to LDC governments or to indigenous industrial firms.55 By 1974, LDCs had accumulated $\\$14.7$ billion in loans, many of which were channeled through multinationals, just as Citibank had suggested.56  \n\nThe tremendous input of capital into Third World development was an act of hegemonic leadership by financial firms. It encouraged multinational companies to undertake previously inaccessible projects; and it induced Third World governments to act as hosts to multinational subsidiaries as the condition for economic development. Without any overt intervention or coercion, decisions about capital flows determined subsequent decisions by companies and nations.  \n\nThe energy crisis of 1973 -1974 significantly altered the climate of LDC investment. The energy needs accompanying industrial development placed local economies at the mercy of skyrocketing oil prices, and severely limited their ability to meet their loan obligations. These countries were forced to try to refinance existing debt and seek new loans to finance their survival. Their deep financial involvement compelled the major banks to remain involved, lest they lose their entire investment. They were thus left with a choice between immediate losses or even greater financial involvement.  \n\nIn choosing the latter course they committed themselves to an ongoing reevaluation of each company and each country. They were forced to make frequent decisions about new loans, about refinancing, and about the changing profile of LDC economies. Each decision influenced the investment environment of other companies and thus reverberated through the international economy.  \n\nThis situation has the same asymmetrical quality as the examples discussed earlier. The worldwide recession guaranteed markets for lenders and competition among borrowers. The economic crises that accompanied loan negotiations gave lenders tremendous leverage. The compulsions of the drive for maximum return on investment impelled the banks to use this leverage, even when this involved substantial intrusion into the sovereignty ofborrowing countries.  \n\nThe “first public showdown with the international banking community'57 occurred in Peru, and involved both a loan renegotiation with the government and a $\\$54$ million loan to Southern Peru Copper Corporation (53 percent owned by the American mining company, Asarco). Until the Peruvian central government agreed to revise the country's tax structure, the banks refused to lend the money necessary to complete a $\\$750$ million copper-mining development (designed to increase copper production for export). The government had been taxing the exports of the company to subsidize the purchase of food for poor people. The lenders, led by Chase Manhattan Bank, forced the elimination of the tax so that all proceeds from copper sales could be used for debt financing. Ultimately, food subsidies were eliminated, wage controls instituted, and three left-wing cabinet members were expelled from the government.  \n\nAlthough U.S. banks denied responsibility for changes in Peruvian internal policy, Business Week noted that the banks’ “passing judgement on Peru's economic performance raises troublesome questions about foreign business interference in the affairs of a sovereign state.\"58  \n\nSince then, banks have become more comfortable in their role as policymakers in the Third World. While forced to renegotiate LDC loans, they have become adept at extracting desired concessions. The government of Brazil, for example, agreed both to reduce growth and to honor bank-defined fiscal discipline. As a reaction to political instability in South Korea, all new loans were refused until the financial community developed a set of guidelines for the country. The refusal of the Manley government in Jamaica to accept loan conditions contributed to its downfall since the withdrawal of investment capital deepened the ongoing economic and political crisis that brought down the administration. And in Poland, tension between government subsidies for food production and western capital's pressure for debt repayment placed United States banks in the middle of the Polish workers' crisis.59  \n\nIn general, bank intervention in the late 1970s sought two basic policy changes: “fiscal discipline” and “increased exports.\"60 Fiscal discipline implied maximizing debt repayment, even at the expense of food imports Or subsidies to living standards. Increased exports implied development of extractive and plantation economies, thus increasing dependency on the world market and distorting economic development.61 In short, the banks policies for these countries became a force for increasing poverty and aggravating an already desperate economic dependency.  \n\nU.S. banks thus became a major determinant in Third World economic policy. The processes of financial hegemony that operate within the American economy have come to apply in this realm as well. Bank decision-making over capital flows stimulated economic development in the Third World in the 1970s and set the initial focus on multinational subsidiaries. As the decade proceeded, Third World countries responded to the ebb and flow of financing by responding to the cues of bank leadership. As the economic climate changed, banks intervened into the internal affairs of these nations with the intention of redirecting economic policy, thus completing the development of hegemonic domination. Banks have long been participants in the creation of corporate policies. The 1980s is a decade of bank partnership in the economic policies of developing countries as well.  \n\n## Discussion  \n\nWe are now in a position to offer a rough outline of the mechanisms and processes that condition financial hegemony. First and foremost, financial power rests on three unique qualities of capital as a resource. First, capital is the universal commodity of the business world. Unlike iron, coal, and machine tools, which are important for some firms but not for others, capital is needed by all corporations. It is necessary both in the narrow sense to pay employees and suppliers, and in the broad sense to fuel the replacement and expansion of industrial plants.  \n\nCapital may be internally generated by individual corporations. However, this form of self sufficiency is quite variable: in recent years companies did well if they produced 50 percent of their capital construction needs internally.62 This suggests, then, that suppliers of capital, unlike suppliers of other resources, deal with the entire economy and, unlike members of other industrial sectors, are central units in the system of power and influence created by the network of resource dependencies.  \n\nMoreover, this is complemented by the highly elastic nature of the demand for capital. Even at very low prices, most commodities have upper limits on sales, at least in the short run. If electricity rates began to fall, usage would at first increase. Eventually, however, the market would be saturated and usage would stabilize, even if rates continued to decline. With investment capital, however, a decline in interest rates means that projects with lower profit margins become viable. As rates decline, more customers enter the market and the types of projects funded become broader and broader. Although this asymmetry exists in other buyerseller relationships, normally a firm is highly dependent on one set of suppliers, while the role is reversed in other of its resource relationships. Only in capital markets is there a continuing asymmetry, unbalanced by countervailing leverage.  \n\nFinally, suppliers of capital, unlike other suppliers, become temporary or permanent partners in the enterprise they serve. A normal suppliercustomer relationship, even in highly convoluted circumstances like the silver futures market, essentially involves an exchange of money for a product. In the financial markets, money is exchanged for stocks - which creates an explicit and quasi-permanent partnership - or for bonds or notes that represent a temporary partnership until the money is repaid at a future date.  \n\nThese unique aspects of financial relationships force banks and other financial institutions into a unique stance toward their customers. They must make constant choices about the relative merits of competing investment opportunities. The choices made by financials to support one firm or industry - or even a country - over another, or to enter or depart from one area of investment, often represent the crucial, determining reality within which nonfinancial corporations operate.  \n\nEssentially there are four mechanisms through which financial decisions over capital flows are transformed into coherent economic profiles. First, lenders or institutional investors may decide to encourage development of a promising area. The availability of investment capital attracts operating companies with the expertise to develop the sector's potential. This occurred during the shipbuilding boom in the early 1970s.  \n\nSecond, lenders or institutional investors may de-escalate economic commitment in a declining or threatened sector. The withdrawal of capital may constrain further development and force contraction of the industry. This occurred in both the nuclear power and shipbuilding industries in the mid-1970s.  \n\nThird, financial institutions may decrease their commitment to a sector or a company or a country as a signal of declining confidence in its economic viability. In these circumstances, industrial leaders must solve their problems to regain investor confidence, but they are not necessarily constrained by the disinvestment. Stock dumping is often used in this manner, though loan refusal in non-urgent circumstances can also operate this way. It acts as a warning that a continuation of current policy will result in future difficulties in obtaining capital, a circumstance that most chief executives will seek to avoid. The abandonment of the Nifty Fifty illustrates this process.  \n\nFourth, capital withdrawal or refusal can be used to intervene in the internal workings of a company or an economy. In these instances, economic strategy usually must be altered as a prerequisite for capital investment, even when the objectionable strategies are unrelated to the terms of the investment. Conditions were set on the loan to Placid Oil that had nothing to do with the company's ability to repay; it was used as a device for driving the Hunt brothers from the futures market. Dumping of Leasco's stock had little to do with the status of the firm as an investment; it was a device to defeat the Chemical takeover attempt.  \n\nOnly the fourth possibility, which might be called disciplinary action, resembles control in the traditional sense in which the term has been used. The other three modes of influence involve a degree of structural distance and a set of processes unfamiliar to students of intercorporate power. The key element in this domination is structural constraint. Because the actions of individual companies, sectors, and even whole economies depend upon the availability of outside capital, their options are substantially altered by expansion or contraction of access to such resources. In some circumstances, this variable alone determines the viability of a project and, therefore, even the promise or threat of alterations in capital availability is sufficient to force changes in policy. Clearly, sufficient internally generated funds (which, for example, oil companies had accumulated in the late 1970s) lessens the degree of responsiveness to financial decision-making. On the other hand, corporate crisis heightens responsiveness. Different firms, sectors or economies are, therefore, differentially constrained. And the whole system's responsiveness to financial decision-making varies with the degree to which financial corporations are unified in judgment and action.  \n\nThe mechanisms that produce financial unity and the structural position of capital suppliers in an economy, fueled by the availability of investment funds, place financial institutions outside of the traditional market model studied by economists. Their impact on investment possibilities on the level of the firm, the industry and the even whole countries produces a broad coordination that undermines the image of autonomous corporations. And their impact on, and relation to, the entire spectrum of economic activity places them in the center of an interconnected system of investment opportunities.  \n\nIn some circumstances, financial leadership acts as a mere agent of a deterministic market system; in other circumstances, financial decisions constrain the larger market. Anywhere along this continuum, the financial elite exerts a dominance over the world of business that is unmatched by other leadership groups. Herbert Patterson, who left the presidency of Chase Manhattan in the early 1970s, expressed this importance when he was asked if he missed the world of the money market: \"if you are interested in prestige and power and you want to play God with people's lives, you obviously are going to miss it.\"63  \n\n# Acknowledgments  \n\nThe authors thank Donna Di Donato, Harry Makler, Lynne Zucker, and the Editors of Theory & Society for comments and the National Science Foundation for research support.  \n\n# Notes  \n\n1.

Introduction  \n\nReputation of financial services providers and the costbenefit analyses of association with reputed actors are important considerations for companiesinterestedin raising capital. Absent credible and adequate information about the companies, external investors tend to rely on the reputation of the companies' associates as certifiers of the companies' own quality. For example, a substantial body of research exists in the realms of auditing, investment banking, and venture capital (VC) that examines theperformance implications ofreputation of financial services providers on public firms, both in the short-term (for instance, IPO underpricing) and long-run.1 However, academic work documenting the impact of reputation of financial intermediaries on performance of private firms is limited.2 Given the information-opacity of private firms, the certification-based approach relying on financial intermediaries' reputation capital assumes extreme importance for the performance of such firms that lack a publicly known track record. Venture capital offers a fertile area to study the performance implications of reputation on private firms and that is the main subject of thisstudy.  \n\nAlthoughcontextualuse ofmeasures ofVCreputation exists inVC literature as mentioned earlier(footnote #2), there is little research on formulating a consistent measure of VC reputation or evaluating the impact of diverse measures suggested by the literature on VC investment outcomes, in a rigorous econometric framework. This is surprising considering both the importance of reputation in the VC industry and the preponderance of studies in other areas, notably the auditing and investment banking literatures that highlight the performance implications ofreputation of financial intermediaries on public firms. This study has two primary objectives. First, itprovidesacomparableevaluationofdifferent VC reputation measures that can be easily constructed from publicly available data, and relates them to multiple yardsticks of company performance, the likelihood of a successful exit being one of them. In so doing, I propose a new measure of VC reputation that consistently predicts future performance of private firms. Second, the study directlycontrols for connections andnetworks that reputable Vc firms are more likely to be tied into, and documents the performance consequences of vC connections as distinct from those arising out of VC reputation that is largely based on the VC's ability and past performance.  \n\nMeasures of VC experience such as age, cumulative aggregate investment, and number of investment rounds have been used in previous studies such as Lerner (1994a), Gompers (1996), Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu (2007), and Sorensen (2007). In addition, Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu (2007)'s measures of VC network centrality are also likely to be correlated with VC reputation.After accounting for these measures of vC experience, connectedness, and network centrality, and controlling for additional VC-specific factors that are likely to impact performance such as syndication, industry competition, investment environment, and exit conditions, I show that one of my measures of VC reputation emerges as the only consistently robust predictor of vC and portfolio company performance.?  \n\nWhile as a certification agent, VC reputation is important for the portfoliocompanies,theVCs themselves are also concerned about their reputation if they seek to be active long-term players in the financial markets. Given the highly networked nature of the venture capital industry and the repeated need for funds, maintaining and enhancing reputation is critical for the venture capitalists.A goodreputation attractspotentialinvestors and helps in developing useful working relationships with entrepreneurs, lawyers, investment bankers, auditors, and otherswhoprovideuseful servicestoportfoliocompanies (Sahlman, 1990). Reputable VCs can also benefit from less costly and larger fund raising for future partnerships. As well, reputation affects VC compensation, which in established funds is significantly more sensitive to performance,as shown by Gompers and Lerner (1999a). Consequently to preserve and enhance reputation, reputable VC firms, to a certain extent, are more likely to invest in companies that have a greater potential to succeed.  \n\nThe resulting selection bias is important to control for to rule out concerns that the performance of VC firms and their portfolio companies may be due to the quality of the companies themselves rather than VCs' reputation and their capabilities. In other words, do reputable VCs truly add incremental value to their portfolio companies, or do they simply have access to a more promising investment opportunity set? To address concerns regarding selection bias, I develop a proxy for capturing the portfolio company's quality, and explicitly control for the coinvestment networks and syndication relationships of the VCs. Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu (2007) argue that VCs that actively syndicate with other industry participants and are better connected have superior access to deal flow, investment opportunity sets, and information. In addition, I use a variation of Heckman's (1979) endogeneity correction procedure, and find the results to berobust.4  \n\nIn the Heckman correction procedure, I first model a reputable VC's likelihood of investing in a portfolio company in a probit framework. The empirical specification of the selection equation reflects characteristics of the portfolio company and the VC firm, location of the VC firm, and industry conditions at the time of initial VC funding. In the second-step regressions, I add the inverse Mills ratio received from the first-step probit regression as an additional regressor for estimating each measure of company performance. My ensuing analyses provide evidence consistent with Sorensen (2007） that more reputable VC firms select superior VC investments as well as add incremental value to their portfolio companies.  \n\nIusetwoVCreputationmeasurestorelatetothe outcome of VC investments.The first is based on the cumulative market capitalization of IPOs backed by theVC firm in the IPO market. As Gompers and Lerner (1999b) point out, IPOs are the most successful of all venture exits and fetch the highest returns to the venture investors. In guiding a portfolio company from a private start-up to an IPO, the VC firm adds to its reputation of being a successful venture investor. Furthermore, an IPO exit creates a “buzz' and enhances VC visibility in the industry. For each VC firm, I cumulate the dollar market value of all companies taken public by the VC firm until a given calendar year and normalize it by the aggregate market value of all vC-backed companies that went public until the same calendar year. Kaplan and Schoar (2005) report a fair degree of return persistence in the private equity industry, and Megginson and Weiss (1991) and Krishnan, Masulis, and Singh (2006) argue that VCs enjoying continuing success create a greater visibility for themselves.The cumulative nature of the measure of VC reputation captures this effect.  \n\nMy second measure of vC reputation is based on the VC's share of aggregate investment in the VC industry. This measure is motivated by two observations. First, a higher share of aggregate investment denotes a higher share of fund commitments by limited partners (LPs) who select and invest in VC funds largelybased on their reputation.5 Second, Hsu (2004) shows that start-ups are often willing to turn down higher valuation offers in favor of more reputable VCs even if valuation offers are lower. This implies reputable VCs have a larger investment opportunity set and are likelytohave a higher share of aggregate VC investment as well. To create the second measure,for each VC firm,I cumulate its dollar investment until a given calendar year and normalize it by the overall aggregate investment in the VC industry until the same calendaryear.  \n\nThe empirical analysis relates measures of vC reputation to the performance of portfolio companies whose VC funding occurred between 1991 and 2001.I first examine whether the portfolio company achieved a successful exit—IPO or acquisition—by the beginning of 2006 in a logit framework. Controlling for a variety of factors known to affect VC firm performance, I find reputable VC firms aremorelikely tolead theircompanies tosuccessful exits. This evidence holds when I analyze the performance of individualVC investments as well as the performance of the lead VC firm at the portfolio company level.  \n\nSecond, I investigate whether or not reputable VC firms are more likely to speed up a portfolio company's exit. To analyze this, I use the time to exit Cox hazard models, which also account for the right-censoring since companies in existence beyond December 2005 may yet exit successfully. I find that reputable VCs are more likely to exit successfully with a lower expected duration. This is valid for both individual VC investments as well as the lead VC firm at the portfolio company level.  \n\nThird, when I restrict the sample to successful exits, I find IPOs are associated with more reputable VCs, even relative to acquisitions. Thus, a monotonic pattern emerges in which top brand VCs are more likely to be associated with IPOs, followed by medium brand VCs with acquisitions, and the least reputable VCs with unsuccessful exits. Since IPOs, on average, fetch the highest returns to the venture investors followed by acquisitions, this pattern is anticipated as the best VCs are expected to both select and nurture their portfolio companies toward the most successful exit. My VC reputation measure adequately captures this pattern, which is a testament to its robustness.  \n\nFinally, I examine the asset productivity of companies, specifically analyzing the ratio of revenues to total book assets when the portfolio companies go public.6 Asset productivity is a means to determine the efficiency by which a company converts its investment in assets into sales. I find that companies backed by more reputable VCs have higher asset productivity at the time of their IPOs. Reputable VCs are more likely to provide better valueadded services that translate into higher operating efficiency for their portfolio companies.  \n\nI apply the VC reputation measures to my analysis in a manner so that reverse causality(better performance leads to a better reputation) is unlikely to explain the observed performance patterns. Specifically, I measure the reputation of a given VC firm at the end of the year prior to the year of its first investment in the portfolio company. Since a substantial time gap is likely to exist between the first investment by the VC firm and its exit, I relate a VC firm's past reputation to its future performance. Thus, by construction, the reputation measures are free of lookahead bias. I find my first VC reputation measure, based onthecumulativedollarcapitalizationofIPOsbackedby the VC,to be a consistently better predictor of VC investment and portfolio company performance. Additional tests suggest VC's dollar capitalization share of IPOs effectively captures both VC screening and monitoring expertise. The Appendix provides a ranking of the top 30 VC firms, by VC's dollar capitalization share in the IPO market. The second reputation measure,based on VC's aggregate investment in the venture capital industry, is not as consistent in predicting portfolio companies' performance.  \n\nThis study differs from the existing literature on VC reputation and experience primarily in three ways. First, I test and propose a new measure of VC reputation that is intuitive,is publicly available, and is the only measure that consistentlypredicts VC investment andportfolio company performance. This is after accounting for VC connectedness (Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu, 2007) and other measures of VC experience such as VC age (Lerner, $1994a$ ; Gompers, 1996; Gompers and Lerner, 1999a), cumulative number of investment rounds madeby the VC firm (Sorensen, 2007), and vC's aggregate investment in the venture capital industry (Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu, 2007). Second,in addition to analyzing the likelihood of a successful VC exit using the logit and hazard models, I dig deeper into successful exits and study two additional performance measures: first, whether the most reputable VCs are able to take their companies public more often rather than sell them to potential acquirers, and second, whether the asset productivity of portfolio companies backed by reputable VCs is higher. Third, I analyze the performance implications of VC reputation on private firms, unlike Krishnan, Masulis, and Singh (2006) who study the impact of VC reputation on the long-run performance of IPOs.  \n\nFinally, whether VCs display capability in sorting companies or in providing value-added services to their portfolio companies, their reputation is enhanced on account of profitable fulfillment of either activity. A consistently performing measure of VC reputation, which incorporates into itself both the VC's screening and value-addition abilities, can be of good use to limited partners and entrepreneurs in their VC-sorting activities.  \n\nThe paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the data, methodology, and construction of variables. Section 3 presents the effect of VC reputation on the performance of VC investments. Section 4 analyzes the impact of reputation on portfolio company performance. Section 5 investigates robustness of the results. Finally, Section 6 concludes.  \n\n# 2. Data, variables, and methodology  \n\nI source the data from the Securities Data Corporation's VentureXpert database provided by Thomson Financial. I focus on investments made by U.s. based VC firms in private companies headquartered in the U.s. The primary sample includes all VC investments made between 1991 and 2001, in companies that received their first round of VC funding beginning in 1991. The private equity investments in buy-outs of relatively mature companies do not form a part of the study. Since, I track the performance of portfolio companies until the beginning of 2006, the methodology provides for a minimum of 4 years for a successful exit, consistent with the analysis in Gompers and Lerner (2000a) and Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu (2007). Companies that do not exit successfully by the beginning of 2006 are classified as unsuccessful exits.The information on successful exitsIPOs and acquisitions——is availablein theVentureXpert database,andI cross-verify it with the New Issues database (for IPOs）and M&A database (for acquisitions), also provided by Thomson Financial. The data consist of 33,539 identifiable VC investments in 12,124 portfolio companies, for which relevant company and VC firm data are available. In the analyses of 33,539 VC investments, each VC-portfolio company pair is unique, even though the VC may have participated in multiple rounds of financing.  \n\nTable1 Year-wise distribution of VC investments   \nThe table presents year-wise distribution of VC investmentsbetween 1991 and 2001,in companies that received their first round of VC funding beginning in1991,andfor which relevant data are available. Companies that went public or were acquired between1991 and 2005, inclusive, are classified as ‘Successful’ exits, otherwise denoted “Unsuccessful'exits.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Fundingyear</td><td colspan=\"2\">VC investments at beginning of 2006</td><td rowspan=\"2\">%Successful</td></tr><tr><td>Successful</td><td>Unsuccessful</td></tr><tr><td>1991</td><td>178</td><td>196</td><td>47.59</td></tr><tr><td>1992</td><td>399</td><td>328</td><td>54.88</td></tr><tr><td>1993</td><td>399</td><td>331</td><td>54.66</td></tr><tr><td>1994</td><td>500</td><td>406</td><td>55.19</td></tr><tr><td>1995</td><td>751</td><td>799</td><td>48.45</td></tr><tr><td>1996</td><td>1066</td><td>1168</td><td>47.72</td></tr><tr><td>1997</td><td>1306</td><td>1673</td><td>43.84</td></tr><tr><td>1998</td><td>1374</td><td>2189</td><td>38.56</td></tr><tr><td>1999</td><td>2008</td><td>4207</td><td>32.31</td></tr><tr><td>2000</td><td>2290</td><td>7715</td><td>22.89</td></tr><tr><td>2001</td><td>972</td><td>3284</td><td>22.84</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>11243</td><td>22296</td><td>33.52</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTable 1 presents the year-wise distribution of VC investments made between 1991 and 2001, and their status at the beginning of 2006. As observed, the VC investment activity gathered momentum in the mid1990s, peaked in the late-1990s, and slowed considerably following the “bubble burst\" of the dot-com era. The proportion of successful VC investments has decreased since the mid-1990s, coinciding with the growth in the venture capital industry; however the investments undertaken particularly in the late-1990s have also had a shorter timeframe to exit (relative to those made in the early- or mid-1990s) since the sample period is rightcensored at the beginning of year 2006. Since these investments may eventually exit successfully, the Cox hazard model employed explicitly accounts for the rightcensoring involved.  \n\n## 2.1. Measure of success  \n\nThe portfolio companies are treated as successful if they go public or are acquired. Gompers and Lerner (2000a), Brander, Amit, and Antweiler (2002), Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu (2007), Sorensen (2007), and Zarutskie (2007） use similar measures to evaluate success of portfolio companies. Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu (2007) also show that this measure is a reasonable proxy for VC fund returns. It is well known that VC firms reap most of their profits from the sub-sample of their investments that exit either through IPOs or acquisitions (Cumming and MacIntosh, 2003; Cochrane, 2005). In my sample,roughly $25\\%$ of the portfolio companies exited successfully by the beginning of 2006, which is comparable to the $26\\%$ reported by Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu (2007). In terms of VC investments, about $34\\%$ succeeded, the success percentage being slightly lower than the $41.8\\%$ reported by Cochrane (2005） during the 1987-2000 timeframe using a different data set collected by VentureOne.  \n\n## 2.2. VC reputation  \n\nI construct two measures of vC reputation to analyze the likelihood of successful exits. The first is based on the cumulative marketcapitalization ofIPOs backed by the VC firm in the IPO market. For each VC firm,I cumulate the dollar market value of all companies taken public by the VC firm from the beginning of calendar year 1987 up until a given calendar year and normalize it by the aggregate market value of all VC-backed companies that went public from the beginning of 1987 up until the same calendar year (I hereafter refer to this measure as ‘IPO Capitalization share'). The market value of portfolio companies is based on the initial day closing price and shares outstanding on that date,both of which are sourced from Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP）records. Since the lead VC reputation is measured at the time of the portfolio company's initial funding round, the constructed measure based on the market value of companies taken public incorporates at least 4 years of vC performance in the case of companies initially funded in 1991, since the lead VC reputation is based on companies taken public between 1987and 1990.For companies initially funded in 1997, this VC reputation measure incorporates 10 years of vC performance from 1987 until 1996.  \n\nThe second measure of reputation is based on the VC's share of aggregate investment in the VC industry. A higher share of aggregate investment denotes a bigger share of fund commitments by limited partners who select and invest in VC funds largely based on their reputation. For each VC firm,I cumulate the dollar investment from the beginning of year 1980 up until a given calendar year and normalize it by the overall aggregate investment in the VC industry in those years (I hereafter refer to this measure as \"VC investment share').7 Thus for example, in the case of companies initially funded in 1991, lead VC reputation is based on aggregate investments made by the VC between 1980 and 1990. The data for constructing this measure come from VentureXpert. In both cases, a larger number or share denotes more reputable VCs.  \n\nI analyzeboth the outcome ofVCinvestments aswell as the fate of portfoliocompanies.At theinvestments level, the reputation is measured for each vC investor at the time of its first investment in the portfolio company. At the portfolio company level, I take the reputation of the lead VC as the primary explanatory variable. Usually, the lead VC originates the deal and is among the first venture investors in the start-up. It is often the most active investor and extensively helps in monitoring, professionalizing the company, and locating follow-on VCs for syndicated investments. I determine the lead VC as the firm that participated in the first round and made the largest total investment in the company across all rounds of funding.Absent the identity of investors in the first round, I apply the same logic to determine the lead VC firm based on identities of the second round investors. This classification, based on the identities of the first or second round investors, is preferred to the one that determines theleadVC firmbased onthe total VC investment across all rounds of financing irrespective of when theVC started its associationwith the portfolio company. For instance, later funding rounds involve larger amounts based on higher company valuations and a VC firm that participated only in the last round of funding but invested the largest amount would be classified as the lead vC, which would not be a meaningful classification.  \n\nTable 2, Panel A shows the average IPO Capitalization share of lead VC firms that led their companies to successful exits is $1.66\\%$ .This differs significantly from the average IPO Capitalization share of $1.00\\%$ for lead VCs who back unsuccessful companies. A similar pattern is observed on analyzing the share of aggregate investment in the VC industry. The average VC investment share is $0.29\\%$ $(0.18\\%)$ for the lead VCs whoback successful (unsuccessful) portfolio companies, the difference being statistically significant. In Table 2, Panel B, a similar pattern emerges for both the reputation measures pertaining to individual VC firms that invest in these portfolio companies.  \n\n## 2.3.Other VC characteristics:experience and connectedness  \n\nI use the age of the VC firm to measure its VC industry experience. The average age of the lead VCs whose portfolio companies exit successfully (unsuccessfully） is 13.46 (12.12） years, the difference being statistically significant. The pattern in Panel B of Table 2 is likewise with experienced VCs more likely to be associated with successful exits.  \n\nAs mentioned earlier, the measures of VC reputation developed are likely to be correlated both with VC experience in general, and with vC firm's age in particular. In my sample, for the lead VCs, the correlations of VC age withIPO Capitalization share andVCinvestmentshare are 0.40 and 0.32 respectively. I include VC age to maintain consistencywithprior literature and also as anadditional control variable.For robustness,I alsouse the cumulative number of investment rounds as an alternative proxy for VC experience (Sorensen, 2007); the results are qualitativelysimilar.  \n\nI measure the VC connectedness or how networked the VC is in the spirit of Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu (2007). I measure the number of relationships each VC has had in 5 years on a rolling basis. Specifically, I count the number of unique VCs each VC has syndicated with in 5 years on a rolling basis and normalize it by the number of relationships possible during those 5 years. VCs that actively syndicate with other industry participants and are better connected have arguably better access to deal flow, investment opportunity sets, and access to information  \n\nIPOs/Acquisitions are classified as ‘Successful' exits; companies that did not exit successfully are denoted ‘Unsuccessful' exits. Panel A presents statistics on VC-backed portfolio companies that were initially funded between 1991 and 2001, and for which relevant data are available. The reputation of the venture capitalist backing the portfolio company is proxied for by two variables. The first is based on the VC firm's dollar capitalization share in the IPO market, determined by the cumulative market capitalization of the companies taken public by the VC firm, relative to other VC firms. The second measures the VC's share of aggregate investment in the VC industry. In both cases, the higher the number, the higher the VC's reputation. Other characteristics of the VC are the VC's connectedness measured by the normalized number of unique VCs the VC has syndicated with in previous 5 years, and age of the VC firm. VC reputation, VC connectedness, and VC age are measured prior to VC's first investment in the portfolio company. VC syndication is characterized by the size of the VC syndicate in the portfolio company, percentage of companies involving a corporate investor as one of the VCs, and percentage of companies involving an arm of an investment bank as one of the VCs. The portfolio company characteristics include the total VC funding to the portfolio company across all financing rounds, and percent of companies that were funded at the early/seed stage of development. VC industry competition at the time of VC's initial funding of the portfolio company is captured by the aggregate funds inflow into the VC industry in the year prior. The investment opportunities available toVCs at the time of their initial investment in the portfolio company are captured by the median market to book ratio in the high-tech industry (defined in footnote 11),in that year. The exit market conditions are proxied by the lagged quarterly number of IPO and M&A transactions prior to exit (in the case of unsuccessful exits, average of the lagged number of transactions since the company's initial VC funding). Panel B presents statistics on all VC (including the lead) investments made between 1991 and 2001, in companies that received their first round of VC funding beginning in 1991, and for which relevant data are available. $p$ Values pertaining to a t-test for equality of means and Wilcoxon test for equality of medians arereported.  \n\nTable2 Descriptive statistics for VC-backed companies funded

Controlling for VC connectedness and the likelihood of a better deal flow is one of the ways I try to address the selection bias arising from VC access to more promising investment opportunities.  \n\nTable 2, Panel A shows that the average normalized connectedness (hereafter referred to as VC connectedness) of a lead VC is $6.86\\%$ $(4.19\\%)$ when it backs successful (unsuccessful) portfolio companies. These statistics are comparabletotheaverageVCconnectednessof $4.24\\%$ reported by Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu (2007). The difference in VC connectedness for successful and unsuccessful companies is significant at the $1\\%$ level. In Panel B of Table 2, I present the average VC connectedness for all individual VCs that invested in the portfolio companies. The average normalized connectedness of VCs that led their portfolio companies to successful (unsuccessful) exits is $6.14\\%$ $(4.35\\%)$ . the difference being significant at the $1\\%$ level. The average connectedness of lead VCs at $4.85\\%$ is slightly lower than that of all VCs since it is measured at the time of first round of investment in the portfolio company. VC investors in later rounds seem to have improved their connectedness because of a flurry of investments and syndications from the mid- to late-1990s.  \n\n## 2.4. VC syndication  \n\nBrander, Amit, and Antweiler (2002) provide evidence that syndicated VC deals have higher returns.I control for the performance implications of syndication by measuring the size of the VC syndicate in each portfolio company. The median VC syndicate comprises of four (three) VCs for successful (unsuccessful) portfolio companies. The median syndicate comprising three VCs across all U.s. based portfolio companies is similar to the findings in Lerner (1994b） but higher than the median VC syndicate size comprising of a single VC reported by Brander, Amit, and Antweiler (2002） on their data set of Canadian venture investments.  \n\nIn addition, I create an indicator variable denoting presence of corporate venture capitalists in the VC syndicate. Gompers and Lerner (2000a) provide evidence that corporate backing is beneficial to the performance of VC-backed companies. Of the portfolio companies that exited successfully (unsuccessfully), $35\\%$ $(24\\%)$ involved a corporate investor in the VC syndicate (Table 2，Panel A). On the whole, $27\\%$ ofthe companies had a corporate investor as one of the VC syndicate members. Also, in Table 2, Panel B, I show that $12.6\\%$ $(10.8\\%)$ of all VC investments that translated into success (failure） were made by corporations. On the whole, corporate investors represent $11.4\\%$ oftheVC investments, the percentage being much higher than the $6\\%$ reported by Gompers and Lerner (2000a) during the 1983-1994 period, suggesting a dramatic increase in venture capital activity by corporations in the latter part of the 1990s.  \n\nItis also well known that VCs provide more than financial capital to develop their portfolio companies.8 They help attract other investors including banks, extensively develop the human capital in the portfolio company, professionalize the company, bring in potential customers and suppliers using their extended network, help forge strategic alliances, and also draw in lawyers, investment bankers,auditors,and other service providers who are capable of providing useful services to portfolio companies. It takes time to develop proficiency and expertise in the VC industry to nurture and guide portfolio companies toward profitable exits. The last decade has witnessed a lot of activity in the VC industry, one being an appreciable entry of investment banks. To determine the performance of investment banks in the VC industry, I create an indicator variable denoting presence of investment banks in the VC syndicate.As observed in Table 2, Panel A, of the portfolio companies that exit successfully (unsuccessfully), $23.10\\%$ $(15.86\\%)$ involve an investment bank in the VC syndicate, the numbers being significantly different from each other. However, at the investments level, $7.76\\%\\left(7.52\\%\\right)$ of all VC investments that translate into success (failure) are made by investment banks, the percentages being not significantly different from each other.  \n\n## 2.5. Portfolio company characteristics  \n\nThe performance of portfolio companies is likely to depend on their quality. As well, better quality companies aremorelikely toaffiliate with morereputedVCinvestors. As discussed earlier, I control for VC connectedness, which is oneway of addressing the selectionbias on account of VC access to more promising deal flow. A second way to mitigate theresultingselectionbiasisto explicitly create a variable that is a proxy for company quality. I create a variable that measures the total VC investment in the portfolio company across all financing rounds. The greater the total VC investment, the better the likelihood of a successful exit. VCs engage in extensive monitoring of theircompaniesandcontinuallyevaluatetheirventures' promise, need for additional capital, use of capital, and whether to liquidate their equity investments. As Gompers (1995) illustrates, a follow-on funding occurs only if companies continue to do well. Furthermore, VC funds are organized largely as self-liquidating partnerships and the need to terminate the fund at the end of 10-12 years imposes a healthy discipline on fund managers. It forces the venture capitalists to refuse additionalrounds of capital for weak ventures. Thus, all else equal, greater VC funding reflects a better quality portfolio company. As observed in Table 2,Panel A, successful (unsuccessful) companies received on average, an aggregate VC investmentof $\\$31.4$ (\\$21.6) million. This difference is significant atthe $1\\%$ level.  \n\nAdmittedly, this measure of company quality is imperfect and involves look-ahead bias since the cumulative funding to the portfolio company (before the exit) is unknown at the time of initial or even later VC funding. However, data limitations prevent me from capturing a more adequate measure of portfolio company quality. The VentureXpert database provides very little information on portfolio companies other than funding rounds, amounts invested, venture investors, and eventual exits. As a robustness check, upon excluding the variable capturing company quality—cumulative VC funding to the portfolio company—all results remain qualitatively similar. Apart from VC connectedness and cumulative VC funding, I also try to account for portfolio company quality using the Heckman (1979) selection framework that models the likelihood of more reputable VCs associating with better quality companies (Section 5).  \n\nI also create an indicator variable denoting whether the first investment by a VC in the portfolio company occurred at the‘seed' or‘early' stage of development. Companies in early stages of development are likely to be riskier and this may impact their performance. I observe that $46\\%$ of the VC investments occurred when the companies were in their seed/early developmental stages, which is higher thanthe $39\\%$ reported in Gompers (1995).9 As observed in Panel B of Table 2, among successful (unsuccessful) exits, $41.02\\%$ $(48.25\\%)$ of all VC investments were made at the seed/early stage, the difference being statistically significant. Similar patterns emerge when I study the performance of traditionaland corporate VC investors separately. For both types of investors, a larger proportion of their investments were unsuccessful when the initial funding was at the seed/early stage.  \n\nIt is notable that the percentage of seed/early stage investmentsmadebytraditionalVCsfarexceedsthose made by corporate VCs (CVCs). This is likely for multiple reasons. Early-stage companies are arguably riskier which makes them unattractive investments for the relatively more risk-averse corporations. CVCs in general are less experiencedinventureinvesting than traditionalVCs; furthermore, CVC managers often have weaker performance incentives compared to the general partners in the traditional VC firms.10 These factors are likely to make the CVC managers unwilling to take additional risks associated with investing in early-stage start-ups. Moreover, business relationsbetween the start-ups and corporations suchas customer-supplier relations,marketing and advertising support, strategic alliances, or joint ventures aremorelikelyat arelativelylaterstage ofthestart-up's lifecycle. Such business relations are often accompanied by equity investments from CVCs' parent corporations. Allen and Phillips (20oo） provide evidence on block ownership by corporations and the resultant benefits in productmarketrelationships.  \n\n## 2.6. VC industry competition  \n\nHochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu (2007) present evidence that competition among VCs for deal flow adversely affects the subsequent performance of their portfolio companies, which is consistent with the 'money chasing deals' scenario first shown by Gompers and Lerner (200ob）in the VC context.I control for VC industry competition in my models by using the aggregate fund inflows in the VC industry in the year prior to the VC's first investment in a portfolio company. Table 2, Panel A shows that the median fund inflows in the VC industry at the time of the lead VC's initial investment in a successful (unsuccessful） portfolio company was $\\$17.75$ (\\$45.49)  \n\nbillion, the difference being statistically significant. The average VC fund inflow is higher than that reported in Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu (2007) because as noted earlier, a significant fraction of VC investments is concentrated in the late 1990s, a period of boisterous VC activity. The pattern in Table 2, Panel B is similar with significantly higher VC industry inflows at the time of the VC's initial investment being associated with unsuccessful exits.  \n\n## 2.7.VC investment environment  \n\nIn the spirit of Gompers and Lerner (2000b), Gompers, Kovner, Lerner, and Scharfstein (2008), and Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu (2007)， I control for investment environment available to VCs using the market to book ratios of all public firms that belong to the high-tech industries.11 It is plausible the investment opportunities available to investors affect their investment decisions and their performance. On one hand, high market to book ratios in an industry can be an indication of favorable growth prospects. On the other, high market to book ratios maypoint toward excessive optimism and over-valuation in an industry, which may lead to inefficient investment decisions and poor performance (Baker and Wurgler, 2002).  \n\nAs a proxy for the VC investment environment, I use the median market to book ratio for the high-tech industries in the year of the first VC investment in a portfolio company. Table 2, Panel A shows the median markettobookratioof 2.19at the timeof leadVC'sfirst investment in the portfolio company is significantly higher for successful exits, indicating VCs appear to select more promising companies in an upbeat investment climate. A similar pattern emerges when analyzing individual VC investments in Table 2, Panel B, which is consistent with the evidence in Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu (2007). However, given the insignificant impact of VC investment environment on success probability as reported in Gompers, Kovner, Lerner, and Scharfstein (2008), the incremental impact of VC investment environment on VC firm and company performance can only be measured in a multivariate setup.  \n\n## 2.8.IPO and M&A market conditions  \n\nStarting with Lerner (1994a), several studies have shown VCs timing their exits, particularly the IPOs, with \"better’ market conditions. Since VC exits from their portfolio companies, through IPOs or acquisitions, are at least in part likely to be a function of conditions in the IPO and M&A markets, I specifically control for the exit market environment using two variables, each measuring the state of the respective markets. First, I measure the quarterly number of IPOs-number of IPOs over a period of 3 months—prior to the portfolio company's exit. This measure is lagged by a quarter so as to allow a typical company and its investors up to 3 months to prepare for an impending exit by way of an IPO or an acquisition. Second, I likewise measure the quarterly number of M&A deals prior to the portfolio company's exit. The higher the number of IPO/M&A transactions, the more conducive the environment is for VCs trying to exit successfully during that period.  \n\nIn Table 2, Panel A, I report the lagged quarterly number of IPO and M&A transactions, prior to company exits. For unsuccessful exits, I measure the average of the lagged quarterly number of IPO/M&A transactions over the entire time period, starting from the portfolio companies'initial date of VC funding. Though imprecise, this is necessary to compare the exit market conditions across successful and unsuccessful exits, at least in the univariate setting, since it is not obvious when to measure exit market conditions for unsuccessful portfolio company exits. In the Cox hazard framework, I allow for timevarying exit market conditions, which alleviates this concern, as detailed in the next sub-section. I find that in the case of successful exits, the previous quarter witnessed on average, 102 IPO and 2,720 M&A transactions, the numbers being significantly higher than those during average exit market conditions. This is consistent with the evidence reported in Lerner （1994a） and Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu (2007).  \n\n## 2.9. Methodology  \n\nTo measure the likelihood of a successful exit I use both the logit and hazard models.The hazard model allows for analyzing the timing of events; furthermore, it also accounts for the right-censored feature of the data,since companies that have not exited successfully by the beginning of 2006 are treated as liquidations, though they may still exit successfully. I measure most of the explanatoryvariables including theVC reputationmeasures at the time of the first VC investment in the portfolio company. Specifically, I measure the reputation of a given VC firm just prior to the year of its first investment in the portfolio company. I do likewise for VC experience and its network connectedness. The variable proxying for competition in the VC industry, aggregate VC fund inflows into the industry, is also measured as of the year prior to the VC's first investment in the portfolio company. The variable proxying for VC investment environment, the market to book ratio in the high-tech industry, is measured as of the year of theVC's first investment in the portfolio company. Since a substantial time gap is likely to exist between the first investment by the VC firm and its exit, I relate a VC firm's past reputation to its future performance. This is important to rule out concerns regarding reverse causality thatbetter performance can lead to better reputation.  \n\nI allow for time-varying exit market conditions in the hazardframework to enabletheportfolio companies and their investors to follow trends in exit markets and reach their exit decisions. The hazard framework has the added advantage of capturing exit market conditions on a periodic (in this case, quarterly) basis, to determine their impact on the incidence of successful exits, which a simple logit model cannot. However, upon using the average quarterly number of IPO/M&A transactions measured over the entireVC-funded timeframe of unsuccessful companies, and the lagged quarterly number of $\\mathrm{IPO}/$ M&A transactions for successful companies，I obtain similar qualitative results in the logit framework.  \n\n# 3. Performance of VC investments  \n\nI first estimate the impact of VC reputation on performanceofindividualventureinvestments.The dependentvariableinTable3equalsoneiftheVC investment is successful and zero otherwise.Iestimate the determinants of success/failure of vC investment in a logit framework. I relate the likelihood of company success to the following variables: VC's reputation, VC's connectedness, VC's experience, portfolio company's quality, VC syndicate size, VC industry competition as measured by aggregate fund inflows in the year prior to the VC's first investment in the company, VC investment environment as measured by the market to book ratio in the high-tech industry in the year of VC's first investment in the company, exit market conditions, and indicator variables denoting (i) investment by a traditional VC firm, (ii) investment by a corporate investor, (ii) investment by an arm of an investment bank, (iv) investment at the seed or early stage of company's development,(v)investment by a traditional vC firm at the seed or early stage in the company's lifecycle, and (vi) investment by a corporate investor at the seed or early stage of company's development.  \n\nThough not reported, I include industry indicators for each portfolio company, using the VentureXpert industry definitions. Broadly, the data cover and specify the following 10 industries: biotechnology, communications/ media, computer hardware, computer software/services, consumer related, industrial/energy, internet specific, medical/health, _semiconductors/other electronics, and other products.12 By including industry indicators, I also partially account for differences in technological and industrial characteristics of the portfolio companies. I also include year fixed effects, based on the initial VC funding in the portfolio company, as additional control variables.  \n\nIn models 1 through 3, I separately include the two VC reputation measures and theVC connectedness variable. All three are found to have an appreciable positive impact on VC investment performance. In model 4, I introduce the IPO Capitalization share and VC connectedness variablestogether.Bothcontinuetopositivelyaffect the likelihood of VC success. However, the impact of IPO Capitalization share is reduced. In economic terms, one standard deviation increase in the IPO Capitalization share increases the odds of a successful exit by more than $12\\%$ In model 5, I include both VC investment share and VC connectedness variables. As before, VC connectedness is found to positively impact VC performance whereas VC investment share is rendered ineffective in predicting the success probability. The insignificant coefficient on VC investment share can be attributed to multicollinearity problemsbecause of thesimultaneousintroduction of the two variables; the correlation between VC investment share and VC connectedness is a significant 0.62.  \n\nSeveral other factors affect VC performance. As expected,the quality of the portfolio company denoted by the total vC funding to the portfolio company, positively affects performance of VC investments. Consistent with the evidence in Brander,Amit,and Antweiler (2002),VC syndication also results in improved performance. As well, investments by corporate venture investors are more likely to succeed which is consistent with the evidence reported in Gompers and Lerner (2000a). VCs that make investments at the seed or early stage in a company's lifecycle are more likely to fail, perhaps a reflection of the riskier nature of early stage investments.The age of theVC firm, a measure of vC experience, is insignificant after controlling for VC reputation and connectedness.  \n\nBoth aggregate VC fund inflow—-a proxy for competition in the VC industry, and the market to book ratio in the high-tech industry—a proxy for VC investment environment, have significant negative coefficients suggesting that their higher values reduce the probability of success of individual VC investments in the multivariate framework. On the other hand, consistent with the evidence in Lerner (1994a) and Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu (2007), theincidence of successfulVC exits rises whenexit market conditions are more conducive for IPO and M&A transactions.  \n\nI next turn to analyzing the likelihood of a successful exit using the Cox hazard model where thelogarithm of timetoexitisthedependentvariable.Thetimetoexitis measured from the date of each VC's first investment in the portfolio company. The Cox model is a semiparametric model in which the hazard function is not dependent on a specific distribution of the survival time. The time to exit is censored for unsuccessful VC investments that have not exited by the beginning of 2006.  \n\nThe results are reported in Table 4. In the Cox hazard framework, a positive (negative) coefficient on the variable implies a higher (lower) hazard for that variable and hence a lower (higher) expected duration. The unconditional time to exit of an average VC investment is five and one-half years. I find most results mirror the evidence reported earlier. IPO Capitalization share, one of the measures of VC reputation,is highly significant in explaining performance of VC investments. In terms of economic significance, based on the estimates in model 4, one standard deviation increase in VC's IPO Capitalization  \n\nThe sample in the regressions consists of VC investments between 1991 and 2001, in companies that received their first round of VC funding beginning in 1991, and for which relevant data are available. The dependent variable in all models takes the value of one if the portfolio company backed by VC investment, has gone public or been acquired and zero if it is still private by the beginning of year 2006. The reputation of the venture capitalist backing the portfolio company is proxied for by two variables. The first is based on the VC firm's dollar capitalization share in the IPO market, determined by the cumulative market capitalization of the companies taken public by the VC firm, relative to other VC firms. The second measures the VC's share of aggregate investment in the VC industry. In both cases, the higher the number, the higher the VC's reputation. Other control variables are as follows: VC's connectedness measured by the normalized number of unique VCs each VC has syndicated with in previous 5 years, size of the VC syndicate, total VC funding to the portfolio company across all financing rounds, market to book ratio in the high-tech industry (defined in footnote #11) proxying for VC investment environment, aggregate VC industry funds inflow proxying for industry competition, exit market conditions proxied by lagged quarterly number of IPO and M&A transactions prior to exit (in the case of unsuccessful exits, average of the lagged number of transactions since each VC's initial funding), age of the VC firm, and indicator variables denoting whether the VC is a traditional firm, a corporate investor, or an arm of an investment bank. Other indicator variables denote whether the VC investment occurred when the portfolio company was at an early/seed stage of development, whether the traditional VC invested at an early/seed stage, and whether the corporate investor invested at an early/seed stage. Industry and initial funding year fixed effects are included in all regressions but their coefficients are suppressed for brevity. Intercepts are not reported. Robust $p$ Valules, heteroskedasticity-adjusted, are in brackets next to the parameter estimates. \\*\\* And $^*$ denotesignificanceat $1\\%$ and $5\\%$ levelsrespectively.  \n\nTable3 Logit

increase in the hazard of a VC's successful exit.  \n\nAs for VC's network centrality, the higher the value of VC connectedness, the shorter the expected duration, which is consistent with the evidence in Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu (2007). In other words, more reputable and better-connected VCs are more likely to lead their portfolio companies to successful exits. However, when introduced simultaneously with IPO Capitalization share, VC connectedness is rendered statistically insignificant in explaining success of VC investments.The other VC reputation measure, VC investment share, is insignificant in explaining the likelihood of VC success when it is included along with VC connectedness. By itself, however, it is significant in predicting success of VC investments.  \n\nAs before, portfolio company quality, beneficial effects of VC syndication, and presence of a corporate VC positively affect VC performance and result in shorter expected times to profitable exits.Furthermore, portfolio companies that witnessedinvestmentsat the seedor early stage in their lifecycles are more likely to result in failures. One significant difference from the earlier results is VC investments that occur when the median market to book ratio in the high-tech industry is higher, have a higher probability to succeed. Finally, when exit market conditions are more favorable, VC investments are more likely to exit successfully.  \n\n# 4. Portfolio company performance  \n\nI next estimate the impact of lead VC's reputation on portfolio company performance where the unit of analysis is each portfolio company. I determine the lead VC as the firm that participated in the first round and made the largest total investment in the company across all rounds of funding. If information on first round investors is unavailable,I follow the samelogicto identify thelead VC from among the second round investors. As mentioned earlier, this classification of lead VCs is more meaningful compared to the one that classifies lead VCs as the investors who have made the largest cumulative  \n\nThe sample in the regressions consists of VC investments between 1991 and 2001, in companies that received their first round of VC funding beginning in 1991, and for which relevant data are available. The Cox Hazard Model is estimated with log of time to exit being the dependent variable. The time to exit of a successful VC (that backed a porfolio company that either went public or was acquired) is the calendar time taken to exit from the date of VC's first investment in that portfolio company. Time to exit of VCs yet to exit successfully by beginning of 2006 is right censored at the end of calendar year 2005. Positive (negative) coefficient indicates that the covariate increases the hazard and shortens (lengthens) the expected duration. The reputation of the venture capitalist backing the portfolio company is proxied for by two variables. The first is based on the VC firm's dollar capitalization share in the IPO market, determined by the cumulative market capitalization of the companies taken public by the VC firm, relative to other VC firms. The second measures the VC's share of aggregate investment in the VC industry. In both cases, the higher the number, the higher the VC's reputation. Other control variables are as follows: VC's connectedness measured by the normalized number of unique VCs each VC has syndicated with in previous 5 years, size of the VC syndicate, total VC funding to the portfolio company across all financing rounds, market to book ratio in the high-tech industry (defined in footnote #11) proxying for VC investment environment, aggregate VC industry funds inflow proxying for industry competition, time-varying exit market conditions proxied by lagged quarterly number of IPO and M&A transactions, age of the VC firm, and indicator variables denoting whether the VC is a traditional firm, a corporate investor, or an arm of an investment bank.

rounds. Moreover, the evidence from the previous section indicates reputable VCs, based on IPO Capitalization share, are significantly more likely to be associated with successful exits, irrespective of their classification into lead or nonleadvCs.  \n\n## 4.1.Likelihood of a successful exit  \n\nAs earlier,I fit thelogit and hazard models to study the likelihood of a successful exit. I relate the company success to the same variables used earlier to model VC investment performance: lead VC's reputation, lead VC's connectedness, lead vC's experience, portfolio company's quality, VC syndicate size, VC industry competition as measured by aggregate fund inflows in the year prior to the first round of funding, VC investment environment as measured by the market tobook ratio in the high-tech industry in the year of first round of funding, exit market conditions as measured by the lagged number of IPO and M&A transactions, industry and year fixed effects, and indicator variables denoting (i) presence of a corporate investor in the VC syndicate, (ii) presence of an investment bank in the VC syndicate, and (ii) initiation of VC funding at the seed or early stage in the company's lifecycle.  \n\nIn Table 5,I report the determinants of success (or failure) of portfolio companies using the logit framework. In models 1 through 3, when separately including the two VC reputation measures and the VC connectedness variable, all three are found to positively affect the portfolio company performance. In model 4, I introduce theIPOCapitalization share andVC connectedness variables together.Theimpact of VC connectedness is substantially reduced and rendered insignificant.However, IPO Capitalization share continues to strongly predict portfolio company performance. Finally, in model 5, I include both VC investment share and VC connectedness variables.Both the VC investment share and VC  \n\nThe sample in the regressions consists of VC-backed companies initially funded between 1991 and 2001, and for which relevant data are available. The dependent variable in all models takes the value of one if the portfolio company has gone public or been acquired and zero if it is still private by the beginning of year 2006. The reputation of the lead venture capitalist backing the portfolio company is proxied for by two variables. The first is based on the lead VC firm's dollar capitalization share in the IPO market, determined by the cumulative market capitalization of the companies taken public by the VC firm, relative to other VC firms. The second measures the lead VC's share of aggregate investment in the VC industry. In both cases, the higher the number, the higher the lead VC's reputation. Other control variables are as follows: lead VC's connectedness measured by the normalized number of unique VCs each VC has syndicated with in previous 5 years, size of the VC syndicate, total VC funding to the portfolio company across all financing rounds, market to book ratio in the high-tech industry (defined in footnote #11) proxying for VC investment climate, aggregate VC industry funds inflow proxying for industry competition, exit market conditions proxied by lagged quarterly number of IPO and M&A transactions prior to exit (in the case of unsuccessful exits, average of the laged number of transactions since company's initial VC funding), age of the lead VC firm, and indicator variables denoting involvement of a corporate investor in the VC syndicate, presence of an investment bank as one of the VC syndicate members, and whether the VC investment occurred when the portfolio company was at an early/seed stage of development.

On the other hand, portfolio companies funded in a buoyant investment environment, or funded in times of increased VC competition, are more likely to fail. These results are consistent with the earlier reported findings on individual VC investments. I next employ the Cox hazard model to analyze the portfolio company performance.  \n\nIn Table 6, the logarithm of time to exit (time between exit and initial VC funding) is the dependent variable and iscensoredfor portfoliocompanies that wereneither acquired nor went public by the beginning of 2006. In models 1 through 3,I separately include the two VC reputation measures and the VC connectedness variable. As before, more reputable and better-connected VCs have a higher likelihood of achieving successful exits with a lower expected duration.  \n\nIn model 4, I introduce the IPO Capitalization share and VC connectedness variables together. This specification renders VC connectedness insignificant at the conventional levels. IPO Capitalization share continues to be significantly effective in predicting the likelihood of successful outcomes. It has a large effect economically as well.One standard deviation increase inlead VC's IPO Capitalization share is associated with a $16\\%$ increasein the hazard of a portfolio company's successful exit. Finally, in model 5,I include both VC investment share and VC connectedness variables. However, only VC investment share is found to positively impact VC performance and the positive coefficient indicates that better reputation increases the likelihood of a successful exit.  \n\nTaking the right-censorednature of the datainto account, I continue to find that the presence of a corporate VC in the VC syndicate has a significant effect on the success probability. Also, better exit market conditions in theIPO and M&A markets are more likely tobe associated with successful exits. As before, portfolio company quality and VC syndication have a positive impact on the likelihood of a successful exit. On the other hand, higher aggregate VC fund inflow—a proxy for competition in the VC industry—significantly reduces the likelihood of success of portfolio companies.This is consistent with VCs making poorer investment decisions when capital is  \n\nThe sample in the regressions consists of VC-backed companies initially funded between 1991 and 2001, and for which relevant data are available.

The ‘money chasing deals' phenomenon, first shown by Gompers and Lerner (200ob) in the context of VC industry, drives VCs into making inferior investments. Finally, consistent with the evidence reported in Gompers, Kovner, Lerner, and Scharfstein (2008), the VC investment environment at the time of initial funding, proxied by the median market to book ratio in the high-tech industries, is insignificant in explaining the likelihood of company success.  \n\nAn interesting issue is the differential impact of my VC reputation measures on the success of portfolio companies that received funding in their early stages versus those that were funded relatively later in their lifecycle. VCs spend considerable time and effort in screening as well as monitoring their portfolio companies (see among others, Lerner, 1995; Kaplan and Stromberg, 2001, 2003) and their reputation should ideally reflect both of these important characteristics. Arguably, VCs are likely to expend more effort on monitoring, relative to screening, on the early-stage portfolio companies. At the later stages of development, when companies are relatively closer to exits, the VC screening expertise assumes relatively more importance.OnewaytotestwhetherVC reputation measured by IPO Capitalization share effectively incorporates both VCs' selection as well as monitoring abilities, and predicts success of portfolio companies irrespective of their lifecycle position, is by dividing the sample by the developmental stage of portfolio companies when they were initially funded. I divide my sample based on companies' being in seed/early or later/expansion stages at the time of their initial funding, and replicate the analyses of Table 6.In both the sub-samples,IPO Capitalization share significantly predicts the success of portfolio companies in terms of an increased likelihood of a successful exit, suggesting that it effectively captures VCs' screening as well as monitoring expertise. I do not report the results in order to conserve space; however, details are available upon request.  \n\n## 4.2. IPOs versus acquisitions  \n\nIn hazard analyses, I find that more reputable VCs are able to exit successfully with a lower expected duration. In this sub-section I focus on the sub-sample of successful companies (VC backed IPOs and acquisitions) and analyze whether VCs backing the IPO firms are more reputable relative to those backing the target firms. There are two primary reasons I analyze this issue. First, IPOs and acquisitions are the two primary methods through which privately held firms move to dispersed public ownership. Although the 'going public' decision has been extensively studied both theoretically and empirically, limited research exists on the acquisitions of private firms, particularly those that are VC-backed. Recent studies by Brau, Francis, and Kohers (2003), and Poulsen and Stegemoller (2008) show factors that determine the firm's choice of an IPO or an acquisition, for a broad sample of privately held firms. In a VC-specific narrower context, Bayar and Chemmanur (2006） theoretically model the choice of exit strategy by entrepreneurs and venture capitalists focusing again on the two most profitable exit routes. By empirically analyzing the choice between IPOs and acquisitions for VC-backed firms, I am able to shed light on the determinants of the exit choice for an important subset of firms desiring to move to public status after being privately held.  \n\nThe second reason is I am able to provide additional robustness about the proposed measure of vC reputation, by analyzing its impact on the likelihood of exits via IPOs or acquisitions. If a monotonic pattern emerges in which top brand VCs are more likely to be associated with IPOs, followed by medium brand VCs with acquisitions, and the least reputable VCs with unsuccessful exits, it would indicate the VC reputation measure performs well.  \n\nIn the logit framework, I first relate the company's choice of exit via an IPO or an acquisition to my measures of VC reputation. The dependent variable is one if the company goes public and zero if it is acquired. As earlier, I estimate models adding sequentially the two variables that proxy for VC reputation. Models 1 and 2 in Table 7 show that the most reputable VCs are associated with IPOs more often, even relative to acquisitions. As the VC's share of cumulative IPO capitalization and investment rises, the probability of an IPO exit over an acquisition exit rises aswell.  \n\nOther observations are as follows.Among the subsample of successful exits, companies with higher VC funding, indicating better quality companies, are more likely to exit via IPOs. This is consistent with Bayar and Chemmanur (2006) who hypothesize that better quality companieshave anincreasedprobability of success in the product markets as standalone firms and are more likely to go public. I find companies that are VC funded when the market to book ratios in the high-tech industries are higher, are less likely to go public. Also, companies that receive their first funding when the investment capital is plentiful are less likely to exit through IPOs. This indicates that the best quality companies receive funding when the available capital in the industry is not as plentiful, which is consistent with earlier results.Furthermore, I find that IPOs are more likely during better IPO market conditions, which echoes the findings in Brau, Francis, and Kohers (2003） in the IPO versus acquisition context. Finally, companiesthatreceived theirVCfundingwhen theywere in early stages of development are more likely to be acquired, which is consistent with the evidence in Poulsen and Stegemoller (2008). Later-stage companies can better withstand product market competition,and are more likely to survive as standalone firms, relative to earlystage companies, and this guides their exit choice as well.  \n\nAs a further robustness check, I next examine the likelihood of a portfolio company exit via the three major routes—IPOs, acquisitions, and liquidations—in a multinomial setting. The exit likelihood is regressed on my measures of VC reputation along with the other independent variables used in earlier analyses. The results are presented in Table 7, models 3 and 4 that are estimated in a multinomial logit framework. In model 3，the VC reputation is measured by the IPO Capitalization share, which continues to be robust in predicting the likelihood of successful exits. In summary, I find top brand vCs are more likely to be associated with IPOs, followed by medium brand VCs with acquisitions, and the least reputable VCs with unsuccessful exits. This monotonic pattern successfully captured byIPO Capitalization share is a further testament to its robustness. In contrast, as presented in model 4, the other measure of VC reputation, VCinvestment share,is not able to capture this monotonic pattern in a significant way.  \n\n## 4.3. Asset productivity of VC-backed IPOs  \n\nFinally, I analyze the asset productivity (asset turnover) of VC-backed portfolio companies when they go public. Asset productivity is a means to determine the efficiency by which a company converts its investment in assets into sales. Jain and Kini (1994), and Purnanandam and Swaminathan (2004）analyze asset turnover in the context of long-run IPO performance. In the VC context, recent research by Puri and Zarutskie (2007) suggests that the scale of investment and production is an important criterion for company financing by VCs. They also report that subsequent to receipt of venture funding, VC-backed companies exhibit larger levels of investment in assets relative to non-VC-backed firms but do not exhibit larger levels of sales. However, they do not differentiate among VCs and treat all VCs as a single class of investors, when comparing VC-backed and non-VC-backed companies.  \n\nSince some VCs are more reputable than others, it is worthwhile to examine the impact of VC reputation on asset productivity of their portfolio companies. VCs play anextensive role in professionalizing start-up firms through human resource policies, executive compensation design, and staffing of adequate personnel, particularly in sales and marketing (Hellmann and Puri, 2002). Since reputable VCs are more likely to provide better valueadded services in professionalizing their portfolio companies, I hypothesize that companies backed by more reputable VCs have higher asset productivity at IPOs.  \n\nAs earlier, the sample includes all companies that received initial VC funding between 1991 and 2001 and went public by the beginning of 2006. Recall that VC-backed IPOs are the most successful of all portfolio companies and as such are likely to be backed by the most reputable and active venture investors. To analyze asset productivity for each company, I measure the ratio of annual sales tototal book assets prior to theIPO year. I obtain similar, but stronger qualitative results,  \n\nThe sample in models 1 and 2 consists of VC-backed companies initially funded between 1991 and 2001 that exited via an IPO or an acquisition between 1991 and 2005, and for which relevant data are available. Models 1 and 2 are estimated in a logit framework with the choice of IPO being the dependent variable. The dependent variable is coded 1 for IPOs and 0 for acquisitions. The sample in models 3 and 4 consists of all venture-backed companies funded between 1991 and 2001, and for which relevant data are available. Models 3 and 4 are estimated in a multinomial logit framework determining the likelihood of IPOs and acquisitions. The dependent variable in models 3 and 4 takes three discrete values constituting IPOs, acquisitions, and unsuccessful exits. The reputation of the lead venture capitalist backing the portfolio company is proxied for by two variables. The first is based on the lead VC firm's dollar capitalization share in the IPO market, determined by the cumulative market capitalization of the companies taken public by the VC firm, relative to other VC firms. The second measures the lead VC's share of aggregate investment in the VC industry. In both cases, the higher the number, the higher the lead VC's reputation. Other control variables are as follws: lead VC's connectedness measured by the normalized number of unique VCs each VC has syndicated with in previous 5 years, size of the VC syndicate, total VC funding to the portfolio company across all financing rounds, market to book ratio in the high-tech industry (defined in footnote $\\#11$ proxying for VC investment climate, aggregate VC industry funds inflow proxying for industry competition, time-varying exit market conditions proxied by lagged quarterly number of IPO and M&A transactions, age of the lead VC firm, and indicator variables denoting involvement of a corporate investor in the VC syndicate, presence of an investment bank as one of the VC syndicate members, and whether the VC investment occurred when the portfolio company was at an early/seed stage of development.

In the multivariate analysis I relate a company's sales-to-book assets ratio to my measures of VC reputation. The dependent variable is logarithm of one plus the sales-to-book and the models are estimated using the Tobit framework. Most of the other independent variables are thesameusedinearlier analyses:VC connectedness, VC syndicate size, portfolio company's quality, lead VC's age, VC industry competition as measured by aggregate fund inflows in the year prior to the first round of VC funding, VC investment environment as measured by the market to book ratio in the high-tech industry in the year of first round of VC funding, IPO and M&A market conditions prior to the IPO,and indicator variables denoting (i) presence of a corporate investor in the VC syndicate, (ii) presence of an investment bank in the VC syndicate, and (ii) initiation of VC funding at the seed or early stage in the company's lifecycle. In addition, I include the: (i) median market to book ratio in IPO firm's industry in the year of exit, (i) a measure of the lead underwriter's reputation, (ii) company's equity market capitalization at the IPO,(iv)median sales-to-book assets ratio in IPO firm's industry in the year of exit, and (v) industry and exit year indicators. The industries are classified into30 categories based on the SIC codes,which are available for all companies, since the sample companies are publicly held. I source the industry definitions from Ken French's Web site (http://mba.tuck.dartmouth. edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html).  \n\nThe industry market to book ratio captures the industry conditions in the year of exit, while the underwriter reputation measures the quality of underwriting  \n\nThe sample in the regressions consists of VC-backed companies that were initially funded between 1991 and 2001 and went public between 1991 and 2005, inclusive. The dependent variable is the logarithm of one plus the sales-to-book assets ratio of the VC-backed portfolio company at the IPO. IPO company's sales and book assets are the last reported annual revenues and total book assets of the company prior to the IPo. The reputation of the lead venture capitalist backing the portfolio company is proxied for by two variables. The first is based on the lead VC firm's dollar capitalization share in the IPO market, determined by the cumulative market capitalization of the companies taken public by the VC firm, relative to other VC firms. The second measures the lead VC's share of aggregate investment in the VC industry. In both cases,the higher the number, the higher the lead VC's reputation. Other control variables are as follows: lead vC's connectedness measured by the normalized number of unique VCs each VC has syndicated with in previous 5 years, size of the VC syndicate, total vC funding to the portfolio company across all financing rounds, market to book ratio in the high-tech industry (defined in footnote #11) proxying for VC investment environment, aggregate VC industry funds inflow proxying for industry competition, exit market conditions proxied by lagged quarterly number of IPO and M&A transactions, age of the lead VC firm, and indicator variables denoting involvement of a corporate investor in the VC syndicate, presence of an investment bank as one of the VC syndicate members, and whether or not the VC investment occurred when the portfolio company was at an early/seed stage of development.

The underwriter reputation measures are downloaded from Jay Ritter's Web site (http://bear.cba.ufl.edu/ritter/ipodata. htm). In particular, I create an indicator variable denoting whether or not the lead underwriter is in the top quartile of the underwriter firms at the time of the IPO. Since the dependent variable is based on revenues, I control for company size and the median sales-to-book assets ratio in the IPO firm's industry. Finally, the industry and year indicators capture the heterogeneity across industries and time periods.  \n\nThe results are presented in Table 8. In models 1 through 3, I introduce the measures of VC reputation and connectedness sequentially, the dependent variable being the natural logarithm of one plus the asset turnover ratio at the IPO. I observe a significantly positive coefficient on  \n\nIPO Capitalization share indicating that companies backed by reputable VCs have greater asset productivity at their IPOs. As well, in a univariate regression, the IPO Capitalization share is statistically significant at the $2\\%$ level in explaining asset productivity of companies at their initial public offerings. The coefficients on VC investment share and vC connectedness are, however, insignificant. When I introduce IPO Capitalization share and VC connectedness simultaneously in model 4, the VC reputation measure continues to be statistically significant in explaining asset turnover. This is consistent with the evidence reported in Hellmann and Puri (2002) on valueadded services provided by the VCs in terms of professionalizing the firms.Based on the estimates of model 4,in terms of economic significance, one standard deviation increase in the IPO Capitalization share is associated with anearly $4\\%$ increase in asset productivity for VC-backed companies going public.  \n\nSeveral significant predictors of asset productivity emerge from the analyses. Companies that are backed by larger VC syndicates and receive larger VC funding have lower asset turnover ratios. A possible explanation is since these companies receive greater VC funding, their asset base is larger, depressing the asset turnover ratio. Successful companies whose initial funding occurred when the market to book ratios of the high-tech industries were higher, have higher asset turnover ratios at IPO suggesting that formation and able nurturing of some better quality companies does depend on investment environment. On the other hand,IPO companies that were funded when capital availability in the VC industry was plentiful have lower asset turnover ratios. Companies also have lower asset turnover ratios when they exit amidst better IPO market conditions, suggesting that companies with lower asset productivity are able to go public, taking advantage of better capital-raising conditions.  \n\nFurthermore, I find companies that are backed by corporateventureinvestors,orhaveaninvestmentbank as one of the VC syndicate members, or are associated withmore reputable underwriters at their initialpublic offerings, have lower asset productivity. This suggests that association with certain prominent actors benefits the portfolio companies in their endeavor to go public despite their lower asset turnover ratios. Also, companies that received their initial VC funding in their later stages of development have higher asset turnover ratios. Finally, I observe a significantly positive coefficient on the median asset productivity in the IPO firm's industry in the year ofexit.  \n\n# 5. Robustness tests  \n\nFrom previous analyses, the IPO Capitalization share has emerged as a consistent predictor of company and VC firm performance, and also distinguishes among reputable VCs backing IPOs and acquisitions. In this section, I discuss additional sensitivity tests to analyze the robustness of my earlier results and in particular my measure of VC reputation, the IPO Capitalization share.  \n\n## 5.1. Correction for selection bias using Heckman's procedure  \n\nThe parameter estimates in previous tables could be biased because of the selection bias arising out of likely matching of better portfolio companies with more reputable VCs. As a result, the performance of VC firms and their portfolio companies may be due to the quality of the companies themselves rather than VCs' reputation. In previous analyses, I try to capture the quality of portfolio companies using two proxies-total VC funding and VC connectedness.As an additional check,to address concerns on account of endogeneity, I use Heckman's (1979) correction procedure. I model a reputable VC's likelihood of investing in a portfolio company using the probit model. This first-step model estimates the likelihood of reputable VCs making venture investments in these privately held firms. In the second-step regressions, I add $\\lambda$ ，the inverse Mills ratio,received from the firststep probit model as an additional regressor to estimate each measure of company performance: likelihood of a successful exit, probability of an IPO versus acquisition, and asset productivity at IPOs. Formally, I have:  \n\nFirst step (selection equation):  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{{(\\mathrm{Probit}):}}&{{P r(\\mathrm{ReputableVC}=1)}}\\ {{}}&{{=a_{0}+a_{1}\\mathrm{Controlvariables}+\\varepsilon}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nSecond step:  \n\n$$\n+b_{3}\\lambda+\\eta\n$$  \n\n(Logit) : $P r$ (IPOorAcquisition) $=b_{0}+b_{1}$ Reputable ${\\mathsf{V C}}+b_{2}$ Controlvariables $+b_{3}\\lambda+\\eta$ (2.  \n\n$$\n+b_{3}\\lambda+\\eta\n$$  \n\nTheempiricalspecificationof theselectionequation reflects characteristics of the portfolio company and the VC firm, location of the VC firm, and industry conditions at the time of initial VC funding. The dependent variable in the selection equation is an indicator variable denoting whether the lead VC backing the portfolio company belongs to the top quartile of VCs based on IPO Capitalization share at the time of initial VC funding. I relate the likelihood that the portfolio company is backed by a reputable VC to the following variables: VC connectedness, VC age, number of companies the VC has invested in since inception, portfolio company quality as measured by total VC funding, an indicator variable denoting initiation of VC funding at company's seed/early stage, VC industry competition measured by aggregate fund inflows in the year prior to the first round of company's funding, VC investment environment measured bythe market to book ratio inthe high-tech industry in the year of first round of company's funding, and indicator variables denoting whether the VC firm is based in the states of California, Massachusetts, New York, Texas, or Virginia, states where most VC firms are located.  \n\nThe logic for inclusion of explanatory variables in the selection equation is as follows. Reputable VCs are likely to have better connections in the industry, which motivates inclusion of VC connectedness. Since reputation is at least partially based on experience, I allow the VC age to enter the selection equation as well. Also,the cumulative number of IPOs and the market capitalizations of portfolio companies at IPO,on which the measure of VC reputation is based, are likely a function of the number of portfolio companies funded by the VC. Therefore, I construct the number of companies funded by a VC since its inception as an additional regressor in the selection equation predicting a more reputable VC. Sorensen (2007） shows reputable VCs are more likely to match with better quality companies, which calls for inclusion of a proxy for company quality. Reputable VCs by virtue of their experience are less likely to invest in timesof increasedVCcompetitionbecauseof higher expected valuations since a number of VCs are vying for thesame deals.Intimes of an upbeatinvestment environment, as proxied by the industry market to book ratio, VC competition is likely to increase, again predicting a lower likelihood of investment by reputable VCs. Finally, more reputable VCs are likely to have access to a larger set of investment opportunities relative to less reputable VCs who may have to invest in relatively more risky early/seed stage deals in order to generate returns and establish reputation in the industry.  \n\nAll but one of these explanatory variables use VC-, company-, and market characteristics known at the time of a VC's initial investment. In the absence of a suitable proxy that measures the quality of portfolio companies at the initiation of VC funding, the measure I use is the total VC funding which of course is not known at the inception of VC funding. The results, however, remain qualitatively unaltered upon exclusion of this variable. As a further robustness check, I also include indicators denoting the portfolio company's industry in the selection equation. While all the primary results remain qualitatively similar, none of the indicators emerge statistically significant in predicting the likelihood of a reputable VC.  \n\nTable 9, model 1, reports the results of estimating Eq. (1) along with the selection equation. Eq. (1) pertains tothe fourth model estimated in Table 6.The model includes VC reputation based on the VC's IPO Capitalization share along with other control variables including VC connectedness.However, along with the earlier variables, I also add the inverse Mills ratio to control for the selection bias. The results from the selection equation estimation indicate that an investmentby a reputableVC is more likely if the VC is better connected (indication of better access to deal flow and a wider choice of deals), if the VC is more experienced (aged), if the VC possesses more investment experience by virtue of the number of companies it has invested in, and if the portfolio company is of a better quality. Also, reputable VCs are less likely to invest during periods of higher fund inflows in the VC industry and in an investing environment characterized by higher market to book ratios in high-tech industries.  \n\nFurthermore, whether or not the portfolio company is in its seed/early stage of developmental lifecycle also has a significant impact on the investment behavior of reputable VCs. Finally, VCs based in California are more likely to be reputable relative to those based in other states that include Massachusetts and Texas,states well-known for concentration of VC investments. The specification of the selection equation is notable since most of the explanatory variables in the predictive model of reputable VC backing are statistically significant.  \n\nIn the first model,I estimate the likelihood of a successful exit in the Cox hazard framework.Based on the results of earlier analyses, I focus on the IPO Capitalization share of the VC firm as the measure of VC reputation, while controlling for other variables including the inverse Mills ratio. I find that the IPO Capitalization share continues to be a significantly positive determinant of portfolio company performance. The inverse Mills ratio derived from the first-step estimation is significant suggesting it is important to control for the selection bias associated with VCs' choice of their portfolio companies (Sorensen, 2007).  \n\nI turn next to analyzing the likelihood of an IPO versus acquisition in the case of successful portfolio companies after adjusting for potential selection bias. Among successful exits,companies that exited via IPOs are likely to be backed by the most reputable VCs, relative to acquisitions.Iestimatemodel 2 inTable9toreplicate the results of the first model in Table 7. When contrasting IPOs and acquisitions, I continue to find the most reputable VCs based on the IPO Capitalization share are able to lead their portfolio companies to IPOs. The inverse Mills ratio derived from the first-step estimation is, however, insignificant. Finally, I estimate the asset productivity of VC-backed IPOs by estimating the model 3. The results observed qualitatively mirror those reported in the fourth model of Table 8.Companies backed by reputable VCs have higher asset productivity, as proxied by asset turnover ratios, at their IPOs. However, the inverse Mills ratio derived from the first-step estimation is not significant in this specification. As a robustness check, the analysis of assetproductivity ofVC-backed IPOsin the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) framework yields qualitatively similar results. In summary, all my results are robust to the correction of selection bias possibly induced by VCs' choice of portfolio companies.  \n\n## 5.2. VC reputation and IPOs  \n\nIPOs, and in particular their underpricing, have been a fascinating topic of research in academic finance. One of the questions that arises in the context of this study is whether VC reputation (and the measures proposed) has an impact on IPO underpricing, say by reducing the underpricing of shares at IPOs through their certification, and thereby fetching higher prices for the companies relative to their market prices (Megginson and Weiss, 1991). On the other hand, if reputable VCs bring better quality companies to the IPO market as evidenced earlier, theoretical work by Allen and Faulhaber (1989) and Welch  \n\n# Table 9  \n\nAnalyses of VC-backed porfolio companies' performance controlling for endogeneity arising from receipt of reputable VC funding  \n\nThe saminthrtmodelconsistsofventure-backedcompaninitiallfndedetween9and200ThCoxHazardModelisestmatedwithogoftimteitbeinthdependentariablehm toexit ofasuefulporfolicmpanythathasthr gonplicorbeenaquird isthecalendrtmetakentoeit fromthdatefitnitalfndingmetxitf porfolicmaniet txit successfully by beginning of 2006 is right censored at the end of calendar year 2005.

that these companies may be more underpriced than lower quality companies.13 I acknowledge these are not the only explanations for low or high IPO underpricing in the context of this study; Ritter and Welch (2002) present a comprehensive review of IPO activity, pricing, and allocations. They merely illustrate the tenuous relation between VC reputation, issuer quality, and IPO underpricing, which can only be measured in an empirical setup.  \n\nTo analyze the impact of VC reputation on IPO underpricing, I construct a measure of IPO underpricing, defined as the difference between the market price on the first day's close and the IPO offer price, normalized by the IPO offer price. In my analysis however, I do not observe a significant relation between IPO underpricing and VC reputation in the multivariate framework, suggesting that neither predictiondominates the other. Even though the coefficient on VC reputation is negative suggesting reduced underpricing for reputable VC-backed IPOs, the evidence about the insignificant impact of VC reputation on IPO underpricing is also somewhat consistent with the findings in Lee and Wahal (2004) who report that IPOs backed by VCs are more underpriced, relative to nonVC-backed ones. Lee and Wahal (2004) also report that the subsequent inflow of funds into the VC firms is more pronounced following the market ‘buzz' observed when the companies are more underpriced. The initial return (or underpricing), also referred to as the “first day pop.\" generates a lot of publicity in the press and among the capital market constituents including institutional and retail investors. As a result, the incentive to attract large inflows of funds that enhance reputation but also serve as an incentive to underprice more to generate the “pop\" may have a confounding effect onVC motivation to certify their portfolio companies, which is predicted to reduce underpricing. This may also lead to the insignificant relation observed between VC reputation and IPO underpricing. On the other hand, consistent with recent studies (Beatty and Welch, 1996; Hansen, 2001; Banerjee et al., 2006), I find the reputation of the lead underwriter has a significant positive impact on the extent of underpricing.14  \n\nWhen companies go public, issuer insiders including the venture capitalists are often under lock-up periods in which they may not be allowed to cash out of their shareholdings. It may therefore be helpful to analyze the impact of VC reputation on long-run performance of the issuers to gauge whether companies and vCs realize financial benefits, particularly after lock-up expirations. In a complementary study, Krishnan, Masulis, and Singh (2006) report that the VC's dollar market share of the IPO market is significantly positively associated with long-run IPO issuer performance measured by industry-adjusted return on assets (ROA), market to book ratio, and listing survival.15 Thus, reputable VCs are associated with a higher value creation for their portfolio companies when their proteges go public, and do not seem to be associated with lower quality exits.  \n\n## 5.3. Alternative definitions of VC reputation, VC experience, andvCconnectedness  \n\nI construct another measure of VC reputation,a shortrun measure,based on the cumulative dollar capitalization of IPOs backed by the VC firm. For each VC firm, I cumulate the dollar marketvalue of all companies taken public by the VC firm in the previous five years on a rolling basis, and normalize it by the aggregate market value of all VC-backed companies that went public during those five years.As before, the VC reputation is measured at the time of vC's first investment in the portfolio company resulting in a substantial time gap between the measurement of VC reputation and portfolio company exit. Although the earlier results relating reputation to VC firm and portfolio company performance are robust to the adoptionof thismeasurebasedonVC'smorerecent performance, the originally constructed long-run cumulative measure, based on IPO capitalization, has more explanatory power, both statistically and economically. This is further evidence of the efficacy of long-run cumulative IPO capitalization as a measure of VC reputation since reputation is expected to incorporate the longterm track record of the VC firm, a property the measure appearsto capture effectively.  \n\nSorensen (2007) argues that the cumulative number of investment rounds made by each VC is a better measure of VC experience relative to VC's age, since age cannot properly distinguish between active and inactive investors. I re-estimate all my results using VC's cumulative number of investment rounds as a proxy for VC experience. As earlier, VC experience is measured at the time of the VC's first investment in the portfolio company. However, all the earlier results relating VC reputation by  \n\nIPO Capitalization share, to VC firm and portfolio company performance remain qualitatively robust.  \n\nThe measure of VC connectedness utilized sofar captures thenumber of unique relationshipseachVC has had with other VCs in five years on a rolling basis. However, this measure does not differentiate VCs who leadVC syndicatesfromthose that are invitedtobe syndicate members by other lead VCs.In the spirit of Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu (2007), I construct two directed measures of VC connectedness. The first measures the number of relationships aVC firmhas with other lead VCs when it is invited to co-invest in other VCs' deals. The second counts the number of other VCs a VC firm has invited into its own syndicates. Clearly, the directed measures ofVC connectednesshave one additional thread of information—-number of relationships forged when VCs led (or did not lead) their syndicates-that motivates their usage.As before,I normalize both the directed measures by the number of relationships possible during those 5 years. Next, I re-estimate all the results by using these alternative definitions of VC connectedness.I continue to findthat VC reputationbasedonthe cumulativeIPO capitalization remains a consistent predictor of portfolio company and vC firm performance.  \n\n## 5.4. Including VC fund size as an explanatory variable  \n\nKaplan and Schoar(2005）show that VC fund size is positively related with fund performance.As afurther robustness check, I also include the VC fund size as an additional explanatory variable in all previous tests analyzing VC firm and portfolio company performance. However, this does not qualitatively affect the results and the IPO Capitalization share as a measure of VC reputation continues to be a significant predictor of performance. I do not report the results both for reasons of brevity and the reducedsample sizeduetounavailableinformation on fund size for a number of vC funds.  \n\n# 6. Conclusion  \n\nLike all financial intermediaries, it is important for venture capitalists to maintain a favorable reputation if they seek to be active long-term players in the financial markets. Moreover, better reputation confers financial benefits, which provide VCs the incentives to invest in acquiring reputation in the first place. For example, Hsu (2004) provides evidence that offers made by reputable VCs are more likely to be accepted, and more reputable VCs acquire start-up equity at a significant discount, compared to less reputable VCs. Thus, while reputation is primarily based on ability and past performance, the actors are also concerned about preserving and enhancing their reputation through better future performance. In this study, I analyze whether association with reputable venture capitalists confersperformance benefits to their portfolio companies and if so, in what form? In so doing, I propose a measure of VC reputation that consistently predicts VC and portfolio company performance.  \n\nControlling for the portfolio company's quality, exit market conditions, and a number of VC specific factors that impact performance including experience, connectedness, syndication, industry competition, and investment environment, I find that companies led by more reputable VCs based on the cumulative market capitalization of IPOs backed by the VC firm, are more likely to exit successfully, access public markets faster, and have higher asset productivity at IPOs—all results being economically meaningful. On the other hand, the other likely measures of VC reputation such as age, cumulative aggregate investment, cumulative number of investment rounds, or VC connectedness do not emerge as consistent predictors of private company performance.  \n\nIn exploring whether the positive relation between VC reputation and portfolio company performance is robust to adjusting for superior VC investment selectivity, I find evidence that even though more reputable VC firms are found to select superior VC investments, they also add incremental value to their portfolio companies resulting in better performance. Whether VCs display capability in sorting companies or in providing value-added services to their portfolio companies, their reputation is enhanced on account of profitable fulfillment of either activity.A consistentlyperforming measure of VC reputation—as suggested in this study—which incorporates into itself both the VC's screening and value-addition abilities, can be of good use to limited partners in their VC-sorting activity. In a similar vein,entrepreneurs can also choose to associate with brand name VCs for a higher likelihood of better future performance.  \n\n# Appendix.

Introduction  \n\nOne of the distinctive features of private equity as an asset class has been long-term persistence in the relative performance of private equity partnerships. Kaplan and Schoar (2005), for example, find correlations of nearly 0.5 between the returns of one fund and the next within a given private equity firm. Among venture capital (VC) funds, they report even higher levels of persistence, with correlations approaching 0.7 (see also, Phalippou and Gottschalg, 2009; Robinson and Sensoy, 2013; Harris et al., 2014; Ewens and Rhodes-Kropf, 2015; Korteweg and Sorensen, 2017). By contrast, persistence has been almost non-existent among asset managers operating in the public equity markets, such as mutual funds and hedge funds (for reviews, see Ferson, 2010; Wermers, 2011).  \n\nThe most common interpretation of this persistence has been that private equity fund managers differ in their quality. Some managers, for example, may have a stronger ability to distinguish better investments from worse ones. Or, they may differ in the degrees to which they add value post-investment-for instance, by providing strategic advice to their portfolio companies or by helping them to recruit able executives. Consistent with this interpretation, even within venture capital partnerships, Ewens and Rhodes-Kropf (2015) report large and persistent differences in investment performance across the individual partners ofthosefunds.  \n\nThis inference of quality differences across private equity investors, however, has relied on indirect evidence. Although Ewens and Rhodes-Kropf (2015）document persistence at the level of the individual partner, they did not attempt to decompose the sources of that individual-level persistence. Fund-level studies, moreover, have had limited ability to account for investment-level factors that influence performance. Persistence might, for example, occur simply because managers focus their investments in particular regions and industries (Sorenson and Stuart, 2o01). If those segments differ in terms of their positions in longrun cycles or in their levels of competition among private equity firms (e.g., Gompers and Lerner, 200o), then one could observe serial correlation due to inertia in the contexts in which firms invest rather than because some venture capitalists prove better than others at selecting, monitoring, or advising their portfolio companies.  \n\nTo gain greater insight into the sources of persistence, we shift the unit of analysis to the individual investment, similar to Ewens and Rhodes-Kropf (2015). But whereas they do so to estimate persistence at the partner level, we do so, in large part, to decompose the extent to which persistence stems from specific target companies versus from investing in particular industries and regions at particular points in time. Examining persistence in performance at the individual investment level also allows us to include all investors over an extended period of time, as opposed to considering only the subset of firms and time periods for which fund-level returns have been available.  \n\nWe focus our analysis on the venture capital segment of private equity for two reasons. First, it has had the highest levels of performance persistence (Kaplan and Schoar, 2005; Harris et al., 2014). Second, our shift in unit of analysis requires an investment-level performance measure. Although information on investment-level-as opposed to fund-level-returns has been available for select subsets of investors, one can determine for all startups whether they went public or were acquired. Since these forms of investment exits produce nearly all of the positive returns in venture capital (Cumming and Maclntosh, 2003; Cochrane, 2005), the rates of these events within a particular VC fund correlate highly with fund returns (Phalippou and Gottschalg, 2009).  \n\nConsistent with prior studies of returns at the fundlevel, we find high levels of performance persistence at the investment-level across VC firms. For example, a ten percentage-point higher IPO rate among a VC firm's first ten investments-that is, one additional IPO-predicts a more than 1.6 percentage-point higher IPO rate for all subsequent investments by that firm, relative to a VC firm with one fewer IPO among its first ten investments. Given that fewer than one in five investments in our sample resulted in an IPO, that amounts to an $8\\%$ higher likelihood of a public offering over the baseline.  \n\nYear-state-industry-stage intercepts at the investment level absorb roughly half of this gross persistence. In other words, differences in where, when, and how venture capital firms invest account for much of the overall persistence in performance across VC firms. But even among VC firms investing in the same stages in the same industries in the same states in the same years, a ten percentagepoint higher IPO rate among a VC firm's first ten investments predicts a roughly $4.3\\%$ higher IPO rate for the firm's subsequent investments.  \n\nThe strength of this persistence in success rates nevertheless attenuates over time.Some of this attenuation stems from attrition: VC firms with few IPOs or exits among their initial investments presumably find it difficult to raise a subsequent fund (Kaplan and Schoar, 2005). Long-term convergence in performance across VC firms nevertheless accounts for most of the attenuation. Using a number of different estimation techniques, our investment-level results reveal that venture capital performance exhibits mean-reversion (for parallel results at the fund level, see Harris et al., 2014), just as one finds in other assetclasses.  \n\nBut performance differences still persist for long periods of time, on the order of a decade or more. What might account for that persistence? Analyzing performance at the investment level allows us to document a number of additional facts that provide insight into the probable source of the persistence. Initial success, for example, appears to stem in large part from investing in the right places at the right times. Indeed, our analyses reveal that the average IPO and exit rates for all investments made by other VC firms in the same year-state-industry-stage segments as the focal VC firm's initial investments strongly predict the observed success rates for the focal VC firm's initial investments.Initial success therefore stems not so much from choosing theright companies or from nurturing them but from investing in the right places at the right times.  \n\nInterestingly, initial success, itself, rather than some underlying characteristic of the VC firms appears to account even for the apparent within-segment persistence. Regressions using the average rates of success among other VC firms as an instrument for a focal VC firm's initial successthereby purging the focal VC firm's unobserved ability in choosing and cultivating specific investments from the estimates-generated as large estimates of persistence as the naive linear regressions. Although venture capitalists add value to startups through the provision of capital and through mentoring and monitoring (e.g., Hellmann and Puri, 2002; Bernstein et al., 2016), differences across venture capitalists in their ability to select and nurture specific companies appears to play little if any role in accounting for performance persistence.  \n\nVC firms may nevertheless differ in their ability to select investments based not on identifying specific startups but on spotting emerging trends and technologies. In other words, VC firms may vary in their aptitude for choosing attractive segments. But we find no evidence that venture capitalists persist in their selection of attractive segments. VC firms that had invested initially in attractive industries and regions continue to invest in them and those segments often continue to experience above-average exit rates. But when choosing industries and regions in which they had not previously invested, VC firms that had enjoyed initial success displayed no better ability than those that had not in selecting promising segments.  \n\nInitial success does, however, lead to changes in how venture capitalists invest. VC firms enjoying early success began to invest more and in larger syndicates. They became more central in the community, allowing them access to a larger selection of deals (Sorenson and Stuart, 2001). VC firms with higher levels of initial success also shifted their investments away from the first round of financing, where assessing the potential of a startup proves most difficult. Firms without access to syndicated rounds may need to focus more on early stages to “get into\" promising startups, while those with access have the luxury of investing later, after some of the uncertainty surrounding the startup's prospects has been resolved. Adjusting for these differences eliminates most of the remaining performance persistence within a particular region, industry, investment stage, and year.  \n\nThis pattern of results appears most consistent with performance persistence in venture capital arising from differential access to deal flow. Venture capital operates as a two-sided market. Offering the best price or the first bid does not guarantee an investment. Entrepreneurs can often choose among competing investors.Venture capitalists similarly have a say in selecting their syndicate partners. To the extent that entrepreneurs and other venture capitalists believe that VC firms differ in their ability to add value to firms, they prefer partners perceived as more able. Hsu (2004), in fact, finds that entrepreneurs accept lower valuations and less attractive terms from more prestigious VC firms when choosing between offers. Prominent VC firms also gain access to a wider and better range of investment opportunities through syndicate partners who want to coinvest with them (Sorenson and Stuart, 2001; Hochberg et al.,2007).  \n\nDespite their beliefs about theimportance of these quality differences, entrepreneurs and other venture capitalists have little on which tobase their assessments of VC firm quality (Korteweg and Sorensen, 2017). Even ex post they cannot determine whether another VC firm might have generated more value for a particular venture. In such situations, initial differences in success-even due to chance events-could lead others to perceive a venture capitalist as higher quality, allowing that investor to access attractive deals. Even with no unusual ability to select investments or to nurture them to success, this access advantage allows successful VC firms to invest in more promising startups, thereby perpetuating their initial success.  \n\nOur results connect to several strands of the finance literature. Most directly, they advance the literature examining persistence in the performance of venture capital firms. Our investment-level analyses suggest that initial success matters for the long-run success of VC firms, but that these differences attenuate over time and converge to a longrun average across all VC firms.Although these early differences in performance appear to depend on being in the right place at the right time, they become self-reinforcing as entrepreneurs and others interpret early success as evidence of differences in quality, giving successful VC firms preferential access to and terms in investments. This fact may help to explain why persistence has been documented in private equity but not among mutual funds or hedge funds, as firms investing in public debt and equities need not compete for access to deals. It may also explain why persistence among buyout funds has declined as that niche has become more crowded (Harris et al., 2014; Braun et al., 2017).  \n\nInterestingly, even if persistence emerges from access advantages rather than from differences in ability, investors in the asset class-the limited partners-would still prefer to invest in the historically successful firms, especially in terms of performance net of the industries, regions, and stages in which they invested. Persistence due to where venture capitalists invest might simply reflect differences in the underlying risks associated with the VC firms' portfolios, the betas. But preferential access to deal flow could not only raise the expected returns of funds but also reduce their riskiness. Not surprisingly then, VC firms that have enjoyed success in their earlier funds raise larger funds and raise them more frequently (Gompers et al., 1998; Kaplan and Schoar, 2005).  \n\nMore broadly, our results contribute to a recent literature on how initial differences, even if largely due to exogenous events, can have long-lasting consequences. Oyer (2008), Kahn (2010), Oreopoulos et al.(2012), and others, for example, find that graduating during a recession can lead individuals to pursue different career paths, with those entering the labor market during these downturns never reaching the income trajectories of their peers who entered during better economic times. Schoar and Zuo (2017）similarly demonstrate that chief executive officers (CEOs) who began their careers in recessions lead smaller firms and manage them more conservatively, in terms of investing less in capital expenditures and research and development and in terms of more aggressively avoiding taxes and managing costs. Our results point to a similar sort of long-term effect associated with vC firms being in the right place at the right time. In part, initial differences in success lead VC firms to pursue different investing paths, moving away from the first round and into larger, syndicated investments. But in part, these initial differences create beliefs about the ability of the venture capitalists that become self-confirming as investors, entrepreneurs,and others act on them.  \n\n## 2. Data  \n\nWe analyzedata drawnfrom theVentureXpertdatabase maintained by Thomson Reuters, which includes roundlevel information on venture capital investments around the world. VentureXpert has unique investor- and portfolio company-identifiers that allow us to trace the outcomes of individual portfolio companies and to construct the entire investment histories of nearly all VC firms. Although no data source offers complete coverage of all venture investments, Kaplan and Lerner (2017) note that VentureXpert has better coverage than the primary alternatives at the level of individual investment rounds.1  \n\nWe limit our analysis to investments made between 1961 and 2008. Two factors dictated our choice of starting year: On the one hand, since our core analysis correlates the success of aVC firm's initial investments with success in the same VC firm's subsequent investments, a later start date, such as 1980, would exclude several prominent investors,such as Kleiner-Perkins and Sequoia.On the other hand, the earliest information on investments might have been collected retrospectively and therefore open to survival bias. Kaplan and Lerner (2017） report that the firm that initiated the VentureXpert survey and database, which Thomson Reuters eventually acquired, began operations in 1961. Information prior to that year would have been collected retrospectively, so we exclude VC firms that began investing prior to 1961 from the analysis. The results nevertheless remain unchanged if we restrict the sample to VC firms that began investing after 1980, and Table 3 further demonstrates that our results remain robust over shorter sub-periods.  \n\nOur choice of ending year similarly balances the long time required for a venture to achieve a successful exit with the smaller samples arising from earlier end dates. Although our download of the data includes information through 2016, we limit the analysis to investments made by 2008 so that we have sufficient time to observe whether those portfolio companies went public or were acquired. That is, we include outcomes observed through 2016, for all investments made in the 1961 to 2008 period. Within this date range, we restrict our focus to firms headquartered in and investing in the United States. We also limit the analysis to firms involved in venture capital investing. VentureXpert includes the entire spectrum of private equity firms, from early stage venture investors to those engaged in leveraged buyouts (LBOs). As noted above, our focus on performance at the investment level requires an investment-level performance measure. For those engaged in venture capital investing, exits-whether through IPOs or through trade sales-provide a good measure of investment-level performance.But for firms engaged in other forms of private equity, such as distressed debt and LBOs, these outcomes have less relevance. We therefore limit the sample (i) to VC firms classified as private partnerships, (ii) to funds classified as venture capital, and (i) to investments in the four investment stages related to venture capital (seed, early, expansion, and later).  \n\nBecause many follow-on investments-additional investments made by a VC firm in one of its existing portfolio companies-occur almost de facto if the target company has another investment round, we limit our analysis to the initial investments by particular VC firms in specific startup companies. In other words, a portfolio company can appear in our sample multiple times, once for each vC firm that invested in it. Any given VC firm will also appear many times in our sample, once for each portfolio company in which it has invested. But, if a VC firm invests in the same portfolio company across multiple rounds, only the first investment by that VC firm-which might not represent the first round of investment in the portfolio company-appears in our sample. This restriction also prevents us from counting the same successful outcome more than once for any particular investor.  \n\nTable 1 provides descriptive statistics for our sample. On average, $20\\%$ of the investments made by VC firms went to companies that eventually went public (i.e.,had an IPO)and $51\\%$ went to companies that experienced either an IPO or a trade sale, allowing the investors to “exit\" (sell) their equity positions.2 These represent the two most profitable outcomes for VC firms. Using hand-collected information on 246 investments in Canada and the United States, for example, Cumming and Maclntosh (2003） report that investments that resulted in IPOs had average gross returns of more than $400\\%$ in the United States while investments that ended in trade sales had average gross returns of $143\\%$ 3 By contrast, write-offs, the single most commonoutcome,usuallyresultedinanear-totalloss of the original investment.Given the bimodal nature of these outcomes,it has become commonfor researchers to treat IPOs and acquisitions(trade sales) as successful events and all other outcomes as unsuccessful (e.g., Cochrane, 2005; Hochberg et al., 2007). Phalippou and Gottschalg (2009), moreover, report that the proportion of target companies that had a successful exit in a fund has a very high correlation to the ratio of distributed funds to funds paid in by the limited partners,a common measure of returns.  \n\n## 3. Persistence  \n\n### 3.1. Investment-level persistence  \n\nWe begin by documenting persistence in the performance of venture capital investors at the investment level. Our approach involves assessing the strength of association between the success of a VC firm's prior investments and its success in subsequent investments. An alternative approach would treat performance persistence essentially as an invariant property of the firm, similar to a firm-specific alpha. Korteweg and Sorensen (2017), for example, decompose performance persistence into that associated with the firm and that associated with the period of the investment. Their approach has advantages for estimating the signalto-noise ratio in fund performance (and consequently also the extent to which investors may have the ability to identify better-performing firms). But their approach also has  \n\nThis table reports descriptive statistics on the sample used for the analysis. The sample is drawn from the VentureXpert database of ThomsonReuters and consists of venture capital (VC) firms based in the United States and their investments in U.S.-based startups. The sample covers the period from 1961 to 2008 and includes only VC firms that made their first investment in 1961 or later and that invested in at least 11 startups between 1961 and 2008. All outcomes are measured as of the end of 2016. When a VC firm invests in multiple rounds for a given startup, only the first investment by the VC firm in that startup enters the sample. Only VC firms classified as private partnerships and funds classified as venture capital are included and only first investments in stages classified as ‘seed', 'early, 'expansion', and “later' are included. Descriptive statistics are reported separately for the first ten investments (used to determine the VC's level of initial success-the key regressor in the analysis)and for all subsequent investments-which form the basis of the estimation sample.  \n\nTable 1 Descriptive statistics.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Full Sample</td><td>First 10 Investments</td><td>Subsequent Investments</td></tr><tr><td>NumberofVCfirmsmakinganinvestment</td><td>895</td><td>895</td><td>895</td></tr><tr><td>Numberofuniquestartupsreceivinganinvestment</td><td>19,802</td><td>6809</td><td>17,492</td></tr><tr><td>Number of VCstartup pairs,corresponding to the initial investments by a VCin a given startup</td><td>46,013</td><td>8950</td><td>37,063</td></tr><tr><td>ProbabilitythatinitialinvestmenthasanIPo</td><td>19.7%</td><td>22.4%</td><td>19.0%</td></tr><tr><td>ProbabilitythatinitialinvestmenthasanExit</td><td>51.0%</td><td>48.9%</td><td>51.5%</td></tr><tr><td>Proportion ofuniquestartups thathadanIPO</td><td>13.7%</td><td>18.5%</td><td>13.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Proportion ofuniquestartups thathadanExit</td><td>42.8%</td><td>47.0%</td><td>44.3%</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTable 2 Performance persistence in proximate investments.   \nThis table reports the results of OLS regressions studying performance persistence at the deal level.

First, it essentially assumes that firm-level advantages remain constant over time. Second, it offers less flexibility for exploring the sources of these firm-level differences.  \n\nOur core analysis estimates a series of linear probability models with fixed effects:  \n\n$$\nY_{\\nu i}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}\\bar{Y}_{\\nu}^{i-10}+\\eta_{y s j g}^{i}+\\epsilon_{\\nu i},\n$$  \n\nwhere $Y_{v i}$ refers to the dichotomous outcome-either an IPO or any exit-of the investment made by VC firm $\\nu$ in the ith startup company in which it invested. We report these results in Table 2. Our main predictor of interest is $\\bar{Y}_{\\nu}^{i-10}$ , the share of VC firm v's ten investments prior to its investment in startup i that resulted in the outcome Y. The choice of ten prior investments is somewhat arbitrary, but all of the results presented in Tables 2-10 remain robust to using 3, 5, 7, 10, or 15 prior investments to measure past succes. The $\\eta_{y s j g}^{i}$ represents the fixed effects included in the regression related to the context of investment i. Our most stringent fixed effects control for theyear $\\times$ state $\\times$ industry $\\times$ stage of investment i, in other words, comparing VC firm v's investment in startup i to other investments in the same year-state-industry-stage segments as the focal investment. We report standard errors clustered at both the level of the VC firm and at the level of the startup company.  \n\nColumn 1 of Table 2 shows a positive and statistically significant associationbetween the share of aVC firm's prior ten investments that succeeded and the probability that the focal investment will succeed. Panel A, for example, reports that every additional IPO among the previous ten investments-a ten percentage-point increase in the rate-corresponded to a 2.53 percentage-point higher IPO rate on the next investment (a $14\\%$ increaseover the baseline IPO rate). Consistent with prior research at the fund level, we find persistence in performance across VC firms at the deal level.  \n\nTable3 Performance persistence in proximate investments for different time periods.

First, aggregation to the fund level probably reduces the noisiness of the performance measures, resulting in larger correlations. Second, our focus on initial investments in target companies means that any differentials associated with some VC firms “doubling down\" more effectively than others, or systematically being better at abandoning worse performing investments, would not appear in our estimates.4 Third, despite including only VC firms that invested in at least 11 companies, our sample has more than twice as many VC firms as any of these earlier studies, in part because our study covers a longer period, in part because the database has fewer missing values for target company exits than for fund returns.5  \n\nThis simple serial correlation points to persistence in performance, but it might stem from a variety of factors, some of which would have little to do with the ability or quality of the venture capitalists. For example, returns and average IPO and exit rates might vary over time, across industries and regions, and by investment stage. Sorenson and Stuart (2001, 2008) find that VC firms have a strong tendency to invest in companies located close to their offices, to focus on a narrow range of industries, and to invest in particular stages of target company maturity, even after accounting for the supply of high-quality investments available in any particular quarter. If returns and success rates do differ across industries, regions, or investment stages, then persistence might emerge as an artifact of these consistent investing styles rather than because some VC firms enjoy better performance for a particular sort of investment. Examining success at the level of the individual investment allows us to adjust for these differences in investing focus.6  \n\nColumn 2 of Table 2 reveals that a large share of the persistence observed in Column 1 stems from differences in the kinds of investments made. Column 2 includes year $\\times$ state $\\times$ industry $\\times$ stage intercepts. These finegrained fixed effects absorb roughly half of the persistence observed in the models accounting only for vintage. Even after adjusting for these fine-grained differences in kinds of investments, however, the proportion of IPOs (and of exits) in the previous ten investments by a VC firm still correlates strongly with the success of its next investment.  \n\nTable4 Performance persistence of initial investments.

Instead of comparing performance across firms, these regressions therefore examine how the success of a specificVC firm's prior ten investments relate to the success of its next one. Interestingly, the coefficients switch signs. For any given VC firm, greater success in its prior ten investments predicts a lower likelihood of success in its next investment. In other words, while we find persistence in performance across VC firms, we find evidence of mean-reversion in performance within VC firms. Harris et al. (2014) similarly find regression to the mean at the fund level when estimating performance persistence with firm-level fixed effects.  \n\nVenture capital as an industry has evolved and matured over the past 60 years. Table 3 nevertheless reveals that these patterns have been fairly stable across thehistory of the industry. The columns estimate performance persistence across and within VC firms for investments made before 1990, from 1985 to 1995, 1990 to 2000, 1995 to 2005,and 2000 to 2008.Panels A and B report the results without VC fixed effects while Panels C and D present the results with them. Looking across the columns, one can see that the pattern of performance persistence across VC firms but mean-reversion within VC firms has been highly consistent over time.  \n\nThe results in Tables 2 and 3 document that meanreversion exists, but they do not necessarily imply that differences in the performance across VC firms erode to zero over time. To test this possibility more explicitly, Table 4 shifts to examining how the success of the initial ten investments by VC firms relates to performance differences in the subsequent investments of those firms. We again estimate Eq. (1), but replace our key explanatory variable-the share of successful outcomes in the previous ten investments-with the share of successful outcomes in the initial ten investments:  \n\n$$\nY_{\\nu i}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}\\bar{Y}_{\\nu}^{10}+\\eta_{y s j g}^{i}+\\epsilon_{\\nu i}.\n$$  \n\nNote that our key explanatory variable, $\\bar{Y}_{\\nu}^{10}$ nowremains constant across all investments by a particular VC firm. We therefore can no longer include VC-firm fixed effects. This approach nevertheless has the advantage of allowing us to study the duration of performance persistence in a more transparent manner.  \n\nColumn 1 of Table 4 reports the results from regressions that only include year fixed effects. The coefficients are statistically significant and economically meaningful. Panel A indicates that every additional IPO among the first ten investments-a ten percentage-point increase in the rate-corresponded to a 1.5 percentage-point higher IPO rate among all subsequent investments, an $8\\%$ difference relative to the average IPO rate. Similarly, Panel B implies that every additional exit among the same ten investments predicts a 1.8 percentage-point higher exit rate (a $3.6\\%$ difference relative to the average). Column 2 adds year $\\times$ state $\\times$ industry $\\times$ stage fixed effects. Even after adjusting for these fine-grained differences in kinds of investments, the proportion of IPOs (or exits) in the first ten investments by a VC firm still correlates strongly with the success of that firm's subsequent investments. Column 2 of Panel A, for example, implies that every additional IPO among the first ten investments predicts a 0.8 percentagepoint higher IPO rate among all subsequent investments, a $4.2\\%$ increase over the average IPO rate.  \n\nThis table reports the results of OLS regressions studying the relationship between investing experience and performance. The sample consists of the first investment made by a venture capital (VC) firm in a startup company. The dependent variable is a dummy variable indicating whether the startup company in question had an IPO in Panel A or any exit in Panel B. All estimations include either Year (Y) or Year $\\times$ State $\\times$ Industry $\\times$ Stage fixed effects, noted below as YSIG. Column (2) further includes VC firm fixed effects. Model 3 is a mixed model where the cumulative number of investments by the VC and the constant have random coefficients. The standard deviations of the random coefficients and the estimated correlations are reported below. Standard errors are clustered by VC firm and startup company in columns (1) and (2), and by VC firm in column (3).

Time path of persistence  \n\nColumns 3-5of Table 4investigate the duration of this persistence.Column 3 examines the 11th to the 30th target companies financed by a VC firm, Column 4 the 31st to the 60th companies, and Column 5 the 61st to the 100th companies.

The extent to which success in the first ten investments predicts success in subsequent investments declines with experience. The point estimates suggest little, if any, persistence beyond the 60th portfolio company, implying long-term convergence to a common mean.  \n\nSelection offers one potential explanation for this attenuation in performance persistence. In other words, perhaps those with less success in their initial investments found it difficult to raise subsequent funds and therefore left the sample (Kaplan and Schoar, 2005). Learning offers a second potential explanation, where those with the worst performance improve with experience. Kempf et al. (2014), for example, find that learning-by-doing occurs even among mutual fund managers investing in public equities, and in venture capital, Sorensen (2007) finds positive associations between investing experience and the rates at which portfolio companies had successful exits.  \n\nTo assess this possibility more directly, Table 5 reports estimates of the relationship between the cumulative (logged) number of investments made by a VC firm prior to a focal investment and the success of that investment, in terms of the probability of an IPO(Panel A)and the probability of exit (Panel B). In Column 1, both panels show positive relationships between cumulative investing experience and expected success. In Panel A, for example, a doubling in experience corresponds to a 0.6 percentagepoint increase in the rate of IPOs associated with future investments,a $3\\%$ rise over the base rate. To account for the effects of selection, the second column introduces VC-firm fixed effects,which again flips the sign of the coefficient: successrates appear to declinewith experience.  \n\nColumn 3 reports mixed models, where we allow each individual VC firm to have a different learning rate as well as a different base level of success. In other words, we allow these variables to have random coefficients. The base level of success refers to the intercept-that is, the expected performance for VC firms with no investing experience. It therefore effectively captures initial performance differences. In these mixed models, experience, on average, has an estimated coeffcient close to zero.But it varies substantially across firms (see the standard deviation of the estimated experience coefficient), meaning that many VC firms do better with investing experience and many others do worse. Interestingly, the correlation between these estimated firm-specific learning coefficients and those of the firm-specific intercepts ranges from $-0.9$ to $-0.94$ across the various models, meaning that the firms with the highest initial performance declined the most over time while those with the lowest initial performance improved the most.  \n\nConsistent with the results in Tables 2 and 3, this decline in performance for those who had high initial success and improvement in performance for those who had lower initial success points to a mean-reverting process. Fig. 1 reveals that this mean-reversion appears even in the unadjusteddata.Each dot on thisplotrepresents the entire history of one VC firm in our sample. The $x$ -axisdepicts the total number of startups that the VC firm backed during our sample period,while the $y$ -axisreportstheproportion of those startup companies that had either an IPO (upper panel) or any exit (lower panel). Apart from one or two outliers,the graph illustrates strong convergence to the mean: VC firms with larger numbers of investments converge to theindustry average success rate.  \n\n## 4. Sources of persistence  \n\nDespite the convergence in performance over time, VC firms that enjoyed higher initial success continued to see higher subsequent success until they invested in more than 60 companies. Since the average fund in our sample invests in about 18 portfolio companies(median $=12$ )，our results imply that the advantages of success in the first fund persist well into the third or fourth fund.  \n\nWe explored three potential mechanisms that might account for this persistence. (1) VC firms may differ in their ability to select promising startups or promising sectors. (2) Even if they do not differ in their ability to select the right investments, some venture capitalists may prove better than others at monitoring their portfolio companies and at mentoring founding teams to success. (3) Even if VC firms do not differ meaningfully in their ability to select startups or to mentor and monitor portfolio companies, some venture capitalists may have preferential access todeals, allowing them to invest in the most attractive startups and potentially to gain better terms in those deals.  \n\n![](images/e3f5c9c41338f7facfa4107e93f6f5c0c31eabbc3e1b5dd0bc5bc7e3bb711116.jpg)  \nFig. 1. VC experience and performance. In both panels,each dot represents the entire history of a single venture capital (VC) firm in the sample and the horizontal axis counts the total number of startup companies in which the VC firm invested. In the upper panel, the vertical axis is the proportion of IPOs in all of the startup companies in which the VC invested. In the lower panel, the vertical axis is the proportion of exits, IPOs or acquisitions, in all of the startup companies in which the VC invested.  \n\nSelection. Venture capitalists spend a great deal of time screening and doing due diligence on potential investments, trying to understand which ones have the greatest potential for growth and profit. These efforts appear effective: research, for example, has found that VC-backed firms patent at higher rates, operate more efficiently, grow faster, survive longer, and more commonly experience profitable exits than seemingly similar firms that did not receive venture capital financing (Hellmann and Puri, 2ooo; Engel and Keilbach, 2007; Chemmanur, 2010; Puri and Zarutskie, 2012). Some of these differences may reflect value added by the venture capitalist but some of it likely stems from the effective selection of promising startups (Gompers et al., 2020). VC firms, moreover, may vary in this selection ability.  \n\nMonitoring. A substantial body of research also suggests that VC firms add value post-investment to their portfolio companies in a variety of ways. Hellmann and Puri (2002), for example, find that companies that received investments from VC firms adopted more professional management practices earlier in their lives. Bottazzi et al. (2008) report that more active VC firms appeared to increase the odds of a successful exit more than less active ones.Bernstein et al.(2016), meanwhile, find that, when VC firms could monitor and advise their portfolio companies more closely, those companies went public at higher rates. Given the numerous ways in which VC firms can add value postinvestment, it would not seem surprising if some VC firms proved better at these activities than others.  \n\nAccess.A third factor involves preferential access to deal flow. Venture capitalists select portfolio companies but entrepreneurs often also have a choice of investors. The venture capitalists already invested in a startup, moreover, have substantial influence over who gets invited to invest in subsequent investment rounds for a promising prospect (Sorenson and Stuart, 2008). When startups have multiple suitors, venture capitalists with better reputations will more likely win a deal when they bid the same price. In fact, entrepreneurs often prefer them even when they offer a lower price (Hsu, 2004). Presumably, the entrepreneurs and existing investors believe it in their own interest to bring prominent venture capitalists into the deal, either because they believe that these investors have acumen or connections that couldincrease thevalue of the startup or because they believe that an investment from a prominent investor will signal to others the quality of the startup (Cong and Xiao, 2017).  \n\nWe investigate these mechanisms in three steps. We begin by considering whether performance persistence stems from the better performance of the specific targets selected by successful VC firms, which could arise either because these firms can better select promising investments or because they can advise them more ably. We then explore whether some VC firms appear better able to select the right industries, regions, or times to invest. Finally, we examine the relationship between initial success and a variety of variables measuring investment behavior that should relate to access to deal flow.  \n\n### 4.1. Target-specific persistence  \n\nBefore delving into the additional analyses, note that the patterns reported in Section 3 already suggest that differences in the ability to select specific startups or in the ability to mentor and monitor them to success may not matter much in producing performance persistence. The value of these activities should only accrue to the specific companies in which a venture capital firm actually invests. One might also expect these abilities either to remain relatively stable over time or perhaps to improve with experience. But neither of those patterns play out in data. Where and when VC firms invest accounts for more than half of the overall persistence. And, rather than improving with experience, VC firm performance exhibits mean-reversion.  \n\nOne of the difficulties inherent in trying to determine whether differences in ability might account for performance persistence stems from the fact that one cannot readily assess investor ability independently from the success of their investments. We therefore adopted an indirect approach, estimating the extent to which one could predict early success on the basis of the average success of other investors in the same sorts of investments, and whether that average success for a particular kind of investment, in turn, predicted persistence in investment success.  \n\nTo see why this approach gives us insight into this question, note that if some venture capital firms simply have a better ability to choose more promising companies or to nurture them to successful exits, then they should succeed at higher rates than their peers investing in similar sorts of companies. But if common segment-specific factors account for initial success, then the performance of any particular VC firm should correlate highly with that of other VC firms investing in the same industries, regions, and stages at the same times.  \n\nWe therefore shift to using the success of peers investing in the same year-state-industry-stage segments as the focal VC firm did in its initial ten investments as the key explanatory variable. This shift should eliminate from the persistence estimates the effects of any initial success that stems from the focal VC firm's ability to select or nurture specific startups. We estimated:  \n\n$$\nY_{\\nu i}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}\\bar{Y}_{-\\nu}^{10}+\\eta_{y s j g}^{i}+\\epsilon_{\\nu i},\n$$  \n\nwhere, as above, $Y_{v i}$ refers to the dichotomous outcomeeither an IPO or any exit-of the investment made by VC firm $\\nu$ in the ith startup company in which it invested. Our main variable of interest, $\\bar{Y}_{-\\nu}^{10}$ , now refers to the mean outcome of all other startup companies that received venture capital investments in the same year-state-industry-stage segments as the focal VC firm's first ten investments, but that did not include the focal vC as an investor. As before, $\\eta_{y s j g}^{i}$ represents the fixed effects related to the focal investment by ${\\mathsf{V C}}\\nu$ in startup i. In other words, Eq. (3) estimates the same model as Eq. (2), but where we replace the share of the focal VC firm's initial investments that resulted in an IPO or acquisition with the share of all other investments in the same segments (not backed by the focal VC firm).  \n\nTable 6a reports the results of these models. The results in both Panel A and Panel B reveal strong positive correlations between the success of the focal investment and the average success experienced by other VC firms in these segments. The magnitudes imply that a VC firm whose initial ten investments occurred in segments with a ten percentage-point higher IPO rate of other startups (not backed by that VC) had a $4\\%$ higher chance of an IPO for all its subsequent investments, after controlling for the finegrained fixed effects of the year-state-industry-stage segments for each of its subsequent investments. Given the similarity of this magnitude to that seen in Table 4,our results suggest that the early success of VC firms depends almost entirely on having been “in the right place at the right time\"-that is, investing in industries and in regions that did particularly well in a given year. Moreover, the results in Table 6a document the same decline in persistence over subsequent investments as seen in Table 4.  \n\nTable 6b reports a parallel set of models but where we use the success of other startups-those not funded by the  \n\nThis table reports the results of regressions where the sample consists of the first investment made by a venture capital (vc) frm in a target company. starting with the eleventh company in which the VC firm invested.

Table 6a, in other words, provides the reduced form version of the instrumental variable (IV) estimation in Table 6b. The first stage of this IV regression is:  \n\n$$\n\\bar{Y}_{\\nu}^{10}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}\\bar{Y}_{-\\nu}^{10}+\\xi_{\\nu},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\bar{Y}_{\\nu}^{10}$ denotes the share of VC firm v's first ten investments that resulted in the outcome in question,either an IPO or any exit, and $\\bar{Y}_{-\\nu}^{10}$ refers to the mean outcome of all other startup companies that received venture capital investments in the same year-state-industry-stage segments as the focal VC firm's first ten investments. The coefficient $\\beta_{1}$ therefore captures initial success driven not by the focal firm's choices and activities but by factors common to the contexts in which the VC firm has been investing.  \n\nThe first stages reveal a strong positive partial correlation between the success of the focal investor and that of other VC firms who invested in the same fine-grained yearstate-industry-stage segments, on the order of $0.5.^{7}$ The instrumented results reveal patterns consistent with, though larger in magnitude than, those in Table 6a.8 The fact that the IV regression can account for all of the within-segment persistence suggests that initial success itself-due to investing initially in the right places at the right timesexplains even the differences in subsequent success across VC firms within particular industries and regions.  \n\nIn our IV strategy, the exclusion restriction requires that, after controlling for the stringent fixed effects, $\\eta_{y s j g}^{i}.$ the average success of other portfolio companies in the same segments as the focal VC firm's initial investments does not influence the success of the focal VC firm's subsequent investments, except through the effect that the success predicted by it has on the focal VC firm, for example, by enhancing the focal VC firm's reputation (which might, in turn, have advantages in terms of preferential access to deals). The fine-grained fixed effects should address most concerns regarding the exclusion restriction but one might stillworry that someresidual correlations could arise:For example, perhaps high-quality VC firms have a tendency, in their initial investments, to cluster in certain segments.  \n\nFig.2 explores the extent to which the IV result depends sensitively on the exclusion restriction. To determine whether a small-to-modest violation of this exclusion restriction would threaten this result,we implemented the \"local-to-zero\" (LTZ) approach, proposed by Conley et al. (2012). In essence,the exclusion restriction assumes that the coefficient for the instrument in the second stage has a value of zero $(\\gamma=0).$ 0. The LTZ method relaxes this assumption by allowing one to treat $\\gamma$ as though it comes from a distribution $(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}\\sim U(\\boldsymbol{0},\\delta))$  \n\nTo establish a range of values for 8, it seems reasonable to assume that the coefficient $\\gamma$ for the instrument in the second-stage regression should not exceed that obtained in the reduced form regression. In other words, adding the endogenous variable should not increase the coefficient of the instrument, given that the instrument, the endogenous variable, and the dependent variable all have positive pairwise correlations. Given that the coefficients for the instrument in the reduced form estimations range from 0.10 to 0.11 (see Table 6a), we explore values for $\\delta$ up to 0.12. Even at quite high values of $\\delta$ -cases that would involve substantial violations of the exclusion restriction-the IV produces point estimates equal to or larger than the linear regressions (the dot-dash lines). This result therefore does not appear sensitive to modest violations of the exclusion restriction.  \n\n### 4.2.Segment selection  \n\nThe analysis above runs counter to the view that some VC firms have a better ability to select specific companies or have more aptitude in cultivating their success (even if venture capitalists on average play an important role in selecting and governing startups). VC firms may nevertheless differ in their ability to select investments at a more macro level. Perhaps some venture capitalists can foresee the industries and regions about to emerge as hotspots. If so, then being in the right place at the right time may depend not just on chance but also on the ability to anticipate these emerging trends.  \n\nWe explored this issue by examining whether VC firms exhibited persistence in choosing attractive segments. We measured the attractiveness of a year-state-industry-stage segment as above (in defining the instrumental variable); that is,for each investment, we calculated the attractiveness of the segment as the average IPO rate (or exit rate) experiencedby all startupcompanies in the same yearstate-industry-stage receiving an investment from another VC firm.We regressed this measure of segment attractiveness on the average segment attractiveness of the first ten investments in which the VC firm invested. We estimated:  \n\n$$\n\\bar{Y}_{-\\nu}^{i}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}\\bar{Y}_{-\\nu}^{10}+\\phi_{y}+\\xi_{v i},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\bar{Y}_{-\\nu}^{i}$ represents the attractiveness of the year-stateindustry-stage segment in which the VC firm $\\nu$ invested in startup company i and $\\bar{Y}_{-\\nu}^{10}$ denotes the average attractiveness of the segments of the first ten investments made by VC firm $\\nu$ The $\\phi_{y}$ specify fixed effects for the year in which VC firm $\\nu$ made the investment in startup company i.  \n\nTable 7 reports the results of these models. Panel A treats only IPOs as a successful outcome while Panel B includes all exits.The first column examines the extent to which VC firms continue to invest in attractive segments when they invest in the same segments as they had initially invested (i.e., when they invest in companies in the same industries, regions, and stages as their first ten portfolio companies). The coefficient suggests a fairly high degree of persistence. But note that this estimate essentially captures serial correlation in the performance of particular segments. Given that the segment fixed effects absorb such a large proportion of the raw persistence (in Tables 2 and 4), one would probably expect some persistence in the performance of particular segments.  \n\n![](images/ad00c69869641ad04a9976f14753523e6cee285093106abdff3a9fab8df8a9f7.jpg)  \nFig. 2. Plausible exogeneity. This figure replicates the estimation of Table 6b using the “local-to-zero\" (LTZ) method of Conley et al. (2012). The graphs correspond to Model 1 of Table 6b. The parameter $\\gamma$ , representing the effect of the instrument in the second stage, has the assumed distribution $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}\\sim U(0,\\delta)$ (normal approximation). The solid line represents the point estimate of the second-stage coefficient for the endogenous variable and the dotted lines the $90\\%$ confidenceintervals (CI). The dash-dot line denotes the OLS estimate from Model 1 of Table 4.  \n\nThat persistence, however, might stem from factors that all investors could easily spot (Gompers and Lerner, 2000). It took little special insight, for example, to understand that Internet-related businesses seemed a good place to invest in the late-1990s. To assess whether persistence in the performance of sectors might stem from factors that all VC firms could observe, Column 2 introduces a number of control variables to account for these factors.9 Their inclusion reduces the serial correlation in continuing to invest in attractive segments by more than half.  \n\nBut even that persistence in investing in attractive segments could stem from inertia in where venture capitalists invest combined with serial correlation in the performance of those segments. It does not point to an ability to spot trends in those segments. Columns 3-7 therefore examine only cases in which the VC firm invested in state-industrystages in which it had not invested in its first ten investments. In other words, did VC firms that invested in attractive segments in their initial investments appear able to select attractive segments in the future?In Column 3,even without accountingfor observablefactors thatmightsignal the attractiveness of a segment, VC firms demonstrated no consistent ability to choose attractive segments. After adjusting for these factors in Column 4, moreover, the point estimates for persistence in selecting sectors end up being closetozero.  \n\n### 4.3. Investing behavior  \n\nWe turn finally to examining preferential access to deal flow. The difficulty with examining this potential mechanism stems from the fact that our data do not allow us to see who had the opportunity to invest in a particular target company or who would have liked to have invested but who could not get into the deal. We therefore exploredhow the characteristics of later investments correlated with initial success, controlling for the characteristics of the initial investments. In other words, we examined how VC firms changed in their investing behavior in response toinitial success.  \n\nWe have one observation per later investment (i.e., the 11th and subsequent target companies). The dependent variables reflect the characteristics of those investments or of the VC firm at the time of that investment-round of the investment, the syndication of the investment, the amount of the investment, and the centrality of the focal VC firm in the syndication network-and the level of initial success enjoyed by the VC firm again serves as the primary explanatory variable of interest. We estimated:  \n\nTable 7 Persistence in segment selection.   \nThis table reports the results of OLS regressons studying the degree to which VC firms can consistently select 'good’ segments.

The dependent variable in Panel A is the IPO rate among companies that received VC investment in the same Year-State-Industry-Stage segment in which the focal VC firm invested, but excluding all companies in which the focal VC firm ever invested.

Initial success appeared to lead to more syndicated investments. Each additional initial exit corresponded to a 0.9 to 1 percentagepoint increase in the probability of syndication. Given the roughly $12\\%$ baseline probability of a solo investment, this effect amounts toa $7\\%$ to $8\\%$ decline in the probability of a solo investment for each initial exit. Columns 3 and 4 then explore whether initial success also corresponded to investing in larger syndicates. It did, with each additional initial exit predicting a roughly $4\\%$ increase in the number of co-investors in subsequent investment rounds. Columns 5 and 6 finally consider whether initial success led to firms becoming more central in the co-investment network.10 These models reveal the largest correlates of initial success, with a ten percentage-point higher success rate among the initial five or ten investments predicting an $8\\%$ to $14\\%$ increase in centrality. We should note that all of these changes hold in models where we instrument initial success using the same instrument as in Table 6b. These changes therefore appear to stem from initial success itself rather than from unobserved factors related to both early success and investing strategies.  \n\nTable 9 considers the investment round and investment size of the VC firm's initial investments in companies. As a startup matures, more information becomes available about its chances of success. Investors can therefore more easily discriminate the wheat from the chaff, the companies with the highest potential from the also-rans. Columns 1 and 2 consider only whether the first investment by the focalVC firm occurred in the first round of investing in the target company (by any venture investor). All of the models suggest that VC firms reduced the proportion of investments made in the first round in response to initial success. Each additional initial exit predicted a 0.7 to 0.8 percentage-point drop in the probability of a first round investment. Columns 3 and 4, then, consider whether initial success led to larger investments.11 Initial success predicted larger future investments, with each additional initial exit corresponding to a $5.6\\%$ increase in the amountinvestedpersyndicateparticipant.  \n\nBut do these changes in investing behavior account for performance persistence?

Access to deal flow therefore would appear to explain most of the residual persistence in performance.  \n\n## 5. Discussion  \n\nTo understand better what channels might account for persistence in the performance of venture capital firms, we examine how the performance of VC firms'investmentsin terms of having successful exits,either through IPOs or trade sales-depend on their initial success.Although the performance of VC firms converges with increasing numbers of investments, we find that initial success predicts future success for as many as 50 subsequent investments. We find that both initial and future success depend in large part on being in the right places at the right times but also that vC firms do not appear to persist in their ability to select those attractive segments. We further find that differences in the selection or nurturing of specific portfolio companies appear to contribute little to explaining this persistence. VC firms enjoying early success did, however, shift their investments to later stages and to syndicated investments. Initial success also allowed these firms to move into more central positions in the coinvestmentnetwork.  \n\nThe picture that emerges then is one where initial success gives the firms enjoying it preferential access to deals. Both entrepreneurs and other VC firms want to partner with them. Successful VC firms therefore get to see more deals, particularly in later stages, when it becomes easier topredict which companies might have successful outcomes. Even if venture capitalists do not differ in their abilities to identify more promising ventures (but they all have some ability to distinguish the entrepreneurs and startups with better odds of success), this access advantage could perpetuate differences in initial success over extended periods of time.  \n\nAlthough this conclusion may seem at odds with the usual interpretation of persistence in the finance literature, it seems consistent with the perspectives offered by many practitioners. Chris Dixon, a prominent partner at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), for example, notes that: “The popular view of venture investing is that it is about picking good companies,because that's what's important with public equities. But you cant apply the logic of public equity markets, where by definition anyone can invest in any stock.Success in VC is probably $10\\%$ about picking, and $90\\%$ about sourcing the right deals and having entrepreneurs choose your firm as a partner\" (Eisenmann and Kind, 2014, p. 8).  \n\nAn open question concerns whether these access advantages accrue at the level of the VC firm or the level of the individual venture capitalist. Although our data do not include information on which partners led these deals, Ewens and Rhodes-Kropf (2015） provide convincing evidence that most of the persistence in performance occurs attheleveloftheindividualratherthanatthelevelof the VC firm. Given the importance that entrepreneurs often place on having board representation from specific partners at these firms and the fact that the underlying social relationships in the venture capital community connect individuals rather than firms, partners within VC firms probably vary considerably in their personal access to deal flow. They probably also carry these access advantages with them if they move to another VC firm or decide to start their own funds. That movement of individuals across firms may therefore contribute to the dissipation of persistence over time at the firm level (Ewens and Rhodes-Kropf 2015).It also means that some VC firms,those founded by partners with strong reputations in the industry, may have access advantages from day one, thereby contributing to their initial success, in an almost self-confirming prophecy.  \n\nAlthough our results suggest that VC firms do not differ in their relative ability to select and govern startups, they do not imply that VC firms do not create value on average. Our findings seem entirely consistent with the long literature documenting the many ways in which VC firms can increase the value of the firms in which they invest. We would also note that our analysis cannot say anything about whether ability or access to deal flow might drive performance persistence on theintensivemarginof returns. Some investors, for example, might become good at experimentation-investing in a large number of firms and doubling down or abandoning investments in a way that leads to better overall returns.  \n\nOurresults alsoseemrelevant to the debate on the extent to which the horse (the business idea) or the jockey (the team) contributes to the success of a venture. Kaplan et al. (2009), studying the evolution of 50 firms from business plans to successful exits, find that the business ideas remained relatively stable even though the management teams did not. They therefore argued that investors should place more weight on the business idea than on the management team. Our results would appear to add some additional weight tothishorse side of thescale.Tothe extent that performance, in large part, depends on investing in the right industries and regions at the right times, it has less to do with the specific venture-and therefore with any particular team-and more to do with a particular investing space (the business).  \n\nBut jockeys may still matter. Note that the importance of the access channel to performance depends on the idea that many investors can see that these companies have strong chances of success. What signals or creates that potential remains an open question. Investorssurprisingly, given the apparent importance of the business idea to success-appear to weight teams more heavily than business ideas when choosing early-stage investments (Berstein et al.,2017; Gompers et al.,2020). Perhaps the characteristics of founding teams account for that potential success that many investors can see. If so, it could help to explain both why so many investors focus on founding teams in their choices and on why access would matter to gaining entry into those promising deals.  \n\nThe importance of access to deals for performance in venture capital could also help to explain why persistence appears in venture capital but not in most other asset classes, such as mutual funds and hedge funds. For investors primarily purchasing and selling public securities, access depends only on price. When multiple firms perceive an opportunity they therefore compete away the returns associated with it. But, in venture capital, access often depends on more than price. It operates as a twosided market. Because entrepreneurs and other investors believe that they might benefit from affiliating with prominent investors-who they believe have the ability to create more value for them-they willingly accept lower prices from these individuals and firms, allowing them to earn rents on their reputations.  \n\nBecause this mechanism depends to some extent on the supply of capital exceeding the demand for it, at least for the most promising deals, it also implies that the returns to past success—and the prestige associated with it—should become more pronounced during periods when venture capital becomes plentiful. Indeed, consistent with this expectation, Shi et al. (2017), exploring the temporal sensitivity of the results in Hochberg et al. (2007),find that VC firms central in the co-investment network only enjoyed greater success during booms. During busts, central firms performed no better than more peripheral ones.  \n\nEven though these differences do not emerge from heterogeneity in the abilities of VC firms, investors in venture capital, limited partners, can potentially still invest in them to earn excess returns. Whether they can do so, however, depends in large part on whether investors have enough information about the performance of previous funds at the time that they must decide whether to invest in future ones. Phalippou (2010), for example, notes that a large share of the correlation in returns across funds stems from investments made within only a few years of one another, when the outcomes of the earlier ones might not yet have been apparent. Our results, nevertheless, suggest that at least a small portion of the performance persistence associated with early success lasts long enough for investors to react to it-if only they can discern the signal from the noise (Korteweg and Sorensen, 2017).  \n\n# References  \n\nBernstein, S., Giroud, X., Townsend, R., 2016.

Analyzing a unique dataset from India, we investigate the impact of traditional quality signals (e.g., the founders' years of experience, prior industry experience); networking signals (e.g., degrees from elite educational institutes, the breadth of an entrepreneurial team); and digital signals (e.g., the social media presence of the startup on multiple social media sites) on the access to venture capital financing. We find that while networking and digital signals positively impact access to financing, traditional human capital signals do not have any significant impact on the process.  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nEntrepreneurial startups play a fundamental role in the promotion of innovation and economic growth (Acs and Audretsch, 1988; Acs et al., 2008; Audretsch, 2007a and Audretsch, 2007b; Audretsch et al., 2009; Baumol, 1996; Chavis et al., 2009; Cumming and Johan, 2014; Cumming et al., 2014; Fairlie and Chatterji, 2013; Klapper and Love, 2011; Marcotte, 2012; McMullen, 2011; Naude, 2010; Stam and Wennberg, 2009; Thurik et al., 2008). The creation of new entrepreneurial and innovative ventures requires capital financing and, as such, there is a large body of research looking into access to entrepreneurial finance for entrepreneurs and startups (Bhide, 1992; Bonini et al., 2012; Fossen, 2014; Nahata, 2008; Wang and Wang, 2012; Li et al., 2016). We know that sustained financing can ensure high levels of growth and survival of new ventures (Cosh et al., 2009; Smallbone et al., 2003; Storey, 2016; Van Auken and Carter, 1989) while lack of financing can result in low levels of growth and an increased likelihood of failure (Alsos et al., 2006; Basu and Parker, 2001). As financing is crucial for startups not only at the initial stages but also at the later stages for continued growth and survival, extant research has sought to determine the factors that play a significant role in access to finance, such as the human capital of the founders (Almus and Nerlinger, 1999; Colombo and Grilli, 2005; Cressy, 1996; Cumming and Johan, 2008a; Stuart and Abetti, 1990; Westhead and Cowling, 1995) and founders' social networks (Goh et al., 2013; Hochberg et al., 2007; Lu0 et al.,2013).  \n\nHuman capital plays a significant role in entrepreneurial endeavors. Researchers have divided human capital into two broad categories: formal and informal. Formal signifies individual educational qualifications, skills, and abilities, whereas informal signifies human capital developed through work and familial experiences. We know that educational investments and work experience can translate into economic advantages (Becker, 1993; Killeen et al., 1999; Langelett, 2002) and, if applied towards an entrepreneurial activity, can result in improved entrepreneurial judgment (Baron and Ensley, 2006; Corbett, 2005; McGrath and MacMillan, 2000; Parker, 2006; Ronstadt, 1988; Shane, 2000; Wiklund and Shepherd, 2003) and forecasting ability (Clement, 1999; Mikhail et al., 1997). It is clear that the impact of human capital on entrepreneurial activity and judgment has been previously widely studied in more developed economies. There is however limited empirical evidence on the role of human capital in startup financing for firms in developing or emerging markets where institutions are arguably weaker, and informal quality signals are much more important to mitigate information asymmetry. In this paper we analyze Indian tech startups to determine the extent formal and informal human capital signals serve as positive signals to mitigate information asymmetries and potentially impact access to venture capital (VC) for Indian entrepreneurs. Our formal and informal measures include total years of experience, the type of work experience (technical, founder, or consultant), the degree to which an elite educational institute provides access to a network of resources, and the breadth oftheentrepreneurialteam.  \n\nIn India, technology has been a major driver of innovation for the last 25 years. Major business opportunities have surfaced in the technological front; consequently, there has been exponential growth in the number of startups, which has attracted investments from a large number of venture capitalists (VCs). From 2012-2017, reports show a significant increase in investments by VCs in Indian startups. The transaction value has increased over 13.5 times (from $\\$94$ million in 2011 to $\\$1.275$ billion in 2016)1. In 2017, investments by VCs in the country reached record levels at $\\$26.5$ billion.  \n\nWith such rapid growth, policymakers face considerable challenges. One challenge is mitigating the inefficiency of the matching process between investors and new technological startups, especially in a financial market which still largely remains imperfect (e.g. Colombo and Grilli, 2005, 2009). In India, graduates from top engineering colleges are no longer restricted to only joining the corporate world; thus, those with engineering, mathematical, and analytical skills are increasingly incentivized to create their own entrepreneurial firms. A report published by NASSCOM? states that $50\\%$ of the founders of new firms have engineering backgrounds, $25\\%$ of them have management backgrounds, and $25\\%$ have other educational qualifications. In 2018, nearly half of the startups in India had one or more founders who studied in one or more of the country's top four engineering and management colleges: the $\\mathrm{IIT}s^{3}$ $\\operatorname{IIMs}^{4}$ , BITS5, or the Indian School of Business°. In the United States, we observe the same trend in relation to Harvard, Stanford, and $\\mathrm{MIT^{7}}$ according to Pitchbook? and Crunchbase statistics. These considerations raise our initial question of whether the traditional human capital signal of previous work experience continues to signal quality to investors, as suggested by extant research. Our follow-up question is whether a degree from an elite institute, which may signal quality and increased social capital due to a higher probability of access to a network of high quality and successful alumni and other social connections, results in greater ease of obtaining startup financing from VCs.  \n\nWe believe another key factor in gaining startup financing is digital network signaling, or using social networks to amass numbers of followers on multiple sites such as Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Prior research has already linked social capital to the propensity for investors to invest in the Australian crowdfunding context, and we seek to extend this research to our analysis of Indian technology startups (Ahlers et al., 2015). Startups and founders who successfully network and build relationships digitally with their consumers build a successful brand image, which serves as a positive signal to VCs. Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of social media in promoting word-of-mouth information diffusion (Aral et al., 2013; Chevalier and Mayzlin, 2006; Dellarocas et al., 2007; Forman et al., 2008; Zhu and Zhang, 2010) in marketing goods and services (Aral et al., 2013; Bharadwaj et al., 2013) and by serving as a platform for greater consumer engagement and participation (Chen et al., 2015; Ghose and Han, 2011; Goes et al., 2014; Li and Wu, 2018; Miller and Tucker, 2013). In this study, we hand collect information from various social media networks (LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook) to determine the strength of the startup's digital network and how it impacts a startup's access to financing.  \n\nBy extending Crane and Hartwell (2019), we link signaling theory with human capital theory and social capital theory to test our developed hypotheses. We collected data from 102 startups that obtained funding between the years 2014-2017. To address potential survivorship bias, we included both failed and active startups. Our results are not only illuminating but also counter-intuitive. We find that the networking and digital signals evidenced by a degree from an elite educational institute (India or abroad), the breadth of the entrepreneurial team (number of founders), and the higher the social media fan following positively impacts access to finance. Founders' years of experience, as well as their prior industry experience as a founder, more specifically their prior experience as technical engineers and consultants, do not show any impact on financing. These findings, related to traditional human capital signals, are rather unexpected as extant research (Baum and Silverman, 2004; Beckman et al., 2007; Burton et al., 2002; Gompers and Lerner, 2001; Hsu, 2007) using data from developed countries (mainly the US and Europe) show contrasting results. These finding can have several implications for digital entrepreneurs, policymakers, and for VCs, especially in developing countries other than India.  \n\nWe believe that this study makes important contributions to the existing literature on VC financing (Audretsch et al., 2012; Baum and Silverman, 2004; Cao and Hsu, 2011; Conti et al., 2013; Cumming and Johan, 2014; Greenberg, 2013; Haussler et al., 2012; Hoenen et al., 2014; Hsu and Ziedonis, 2013; Mann and Sager, 2007; Cumming and Zhang, 2016), as this study is the first empirical study, to the best of our knowledge, which links human capital theory, social capital theory, and signaling theory to show the impact of human capital and social capital on obtaining VC financing in the developing market context.  \n\nThe remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows. We begin by reviewing the relevant literature on signaling; the problems of asymmetry, human capital, and social networking; and then we use this research to develop our hypotheses and theoretical framework in Section 2. We describe the research method, data collection, and variables used to test the hypotheses in Section 3. We present our results of multivariate logistic regressions and our robustness tests in Section 4. We conclude and discuss the limitations of our research in Section 5.  \n\n## 2. Theoretical background and hypotheses  \n\nEvans and Bahrami (1995) suggest that technological startups? are prone to high levels of business risk, changing consumer preferences, fast-changing technology, and a shortened product life cycle. To establish themselves in such a complex and dynamic environment, startups need continued access to external financing as lack of adequate financing has been shown to increase the likelihood of failure (Aspelund et al., 2005; Carter and Van Auken, 2005; Cassar, 2004; Coleman, 2000; Gaskill et al., 1993; Sandberg and Hofer, 1987). Inadequate access to financing also affects the growth potential of new ventures. VC literature finds that undercapitalized firms experience lower levels of growth (Alsos et al., 2006; Chandler and Hanks, 1998). A recent research report1° showed thatmorethan $90\\%$ of startups fail. Similarly, in India, a study conducted by IBM found that more than $90\\%$ of startups in India fail in the first five years owing to lack of pioneering innovation and funding. New ventures in India may face heightened barriers to traditional sources of financing due to higher institutional burdens, resulting in opacity and information asymmetry that limits the availability of information (Cumming and Johan, 2008a; and Cumming et al., 2014; De Clercq et al., 2010; Petersen and Rajan, 1995). Entrepreneurs and founders will have significant knowledge about the startup's future prospects and growth, due to a higher level of involvement in the business, while the external investor is likely to possess more information regarding the marketing and trends in the industry in general. In such cases, when there is a presence of asymmetric information, entrepreneurs may pursue a different strategy than what would be preferred by the investors (Gompers, 2002). It is difficult for investors to monitor ex-post the behavior of entrepreneurs, as entrepreneurs may behave opportunistically after obtaining external financing (Cumming and Johan, 2007; Cumming and Johan, 2008a; Cumming and Johan, 2008b). Additionally, for the investors, it is difficult to ascertain ex-ante the risks and returns of the projects of firms that lack a track record and are developing innovative technologies. For startups, all of these factors create barriers to raising external financing, as they do not have a sufficient track record, credit history, or collateral with which they can use to alleviate such problems (MacMillan et al., 1985; Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984).  \n\nFactors that serve to breach the aforementioned barriers have been identified by researchers, the most significant being the founders human capital (Aspelund et al., 2005; Gimeno et al., 1997; MacMillan et al., 1985; Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984). Human capital theory was initially applied to study the impact of education (Becker, 1993; Schultz, 1961) on economic value. Since then, the theory has been increasingly adopted in the field of entrepreneurship, consistently linking human capital attributes to entrepreneurial success (Unger et al., 2011). The literature on human capital distinguishes three kinds of human capital: generic (general) human capital, firm-specific human capital, and task-specific human capital (Gibbons and Waldman, 2004; Hatch and Dyer, 2004).  \n\nWhile we do not directly distinguish between these particular subcategories of human capital in our paper, we do employ signaling theory to propose how traditional human capital signals (like having prior experience as a startup founder, a technical or software engineer, or a business consultant) and networking signals (such as possessing a degree from an elite educational institute, the breadth of an entrepreneurial team and the number of founders, and the entrepreneurial team's years of experience) serve as quality signals to VCs to both mitigate information asymmetry and enhance the likelihood of access to multiple rounds of financing (Spence, 1973; and Spence, 1974). Additionally, we analyze a variable called digital signals, which represents the fan following of the startup on multiple social media sites (Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn) (Vismara, 2016). We believe the higher the number of “fan\" followings, the more positive the signal of social capital to investors. Even though several empirical studies have analyzed the impact of founders' human capital on firms' growth and performance, there are very few studies that have explored the impact of human capital on access to VC financing in India. Our theoretical model of the signaling impact of these factors is shown in Fig. 1. We consequently developed our hypotheses on the relationship between the founders' human capital and the startups' access to financing followed by our hypothesis on how social media networking can also affect this process of financing.  \n\n![](images/00534c19288f500af0846628465842e8ca0cfe802952f4872ffcf0e0a8ea3b23.jpg)  \nFig 1. Theoretical model showing the relationship of traditional, networking, and social media signals to attract more rounds of financing  \n\n### 2.1. Traditional signals: entrepreneurial experience  \n\nEntrepreneurship literature (Baron and Ensley, 2006; Corbett, 2005; McGrath and MacMillan, 2000; Parker, 2006; Ronstadt, 1988; Shane, 2000; Wiklund and Shepherd, 2003) has shown that founders gain significant insight from their past work experiences thereby improving entrepreneurial judgment, greater task performance, and forecasting ability (Clement, 1999; Mikhail et al., 1997). This benefit of experience, generally, may be greater in setings of high uncertainty such as business opportunities in new technology or high-tech industries (Aldrich and Fiol, 1994). However, other scholars argue against the benefit of experience for several reasons, including the heterogeneity across tasks that limits the transfer of gained knowledge (Bonner and Lewis, 1990), cognitive biases that inhibit effective learning (Cassar and Craig, 2009; Hogarth, 1991; Kahneman et al., 1982; Sexton et al., 1997), and the lack of sufficient task repetition to achieve learning by doing (Camerer and Lovallo, 1999). Beyond these theoretical debates, there are crucial practical and policy implications that determine whether or not years of experience do actually impact the entrepreneurship process. However, there is limited empirical evidence from research that directly investigates the role of years of experience on the access to financing for the new startups in this digital age. We believe that experienced entrepreneurs are likely to have a greater understanding of the industry and, given the greater uncertainty for high-tech businesses, the benefit from experience can serve as a positive signal to VCs. Consequently, we posit:  \n\nHypothesis 1. Founders with more work experience are likely to acces more rounds of VC financing.  \n\n#### 2.1.1. Prior startup experience  \n\nStudies have shown that investors look for founders with experience (Hall and Hofer, 1993; Kaplan and Stro\"mberg, 2004; Maidique, 1986). Entrepreneurs who have prior experience creating startups develop strong cognitive skills that help them beter assess risk (Bar-Hillel, 1983; Hayward et al., 2006) and which, overall, results in a better evaluation and selection of entrepreneurial opportunities (Baron and Ensley, 2006; Gruber et al., 2008). Prior startup founding experience can serve as a powerful human capital signal (Hsu, 2007) and can increase the likelihood of obtaining VC funding. While founders may have been involved in several previous ventures, the frequency and repetition of startup founding experience will not necessarily always serve as a positive signal to investors. In contrast, Beckman et al. (2007) found prior startup experience had an opposite effect on receiving VC funding. Similarly, Baum and Silverman (2004) found that the yearly pre-IPO amount of VC funding obtained by Canadian biotech startups increases with the managerial competencies of a firm's president, while it is negatively related to his or her entrepreneurial experience. Consequently,weposit:  \n\nHypothesis 2a. The prior startup experience of founders facilitates access to more rounds of VC financing.  \n\n#### 2.1.2. Prior technical experience or industry experience  \n\nThe founders who have had prior industry experience or possess technical skills related to the industry are aware of the industry norms, rules, and dynamics of every changing environment. Such founders with more technical experience and skills are better able to understand the needs of consumers and know how to serve them better (Delmar and Shane, 2006). Founders' industry experience is often viewed positively (Brush et al., 2001) and is valued by potential VCs when making investment decisions (MacMillan et al., 1985). Eckhardt et al. (2006) also find similar results, where prior industry-specific experiences positively influence the likelihood of obtaining external financing. This can serve as a positive signal to investors who believe that industrial experience can serve them better. Consequently,we posit:  \n\nHypothesis 2b. The prior technical experience of founders facilitates access to more rounds of financing through VC.  \n\n#### 2.1.3. Prior business consultancy experience  \n\nThe role of an expert consultant has increasingly become significant for firms seeking to be successful. An event study by Bergh and Gibons (2011) that analyses firms that announced the hiring of consultants finds that the stock market, on average, responded positively and significantly to the announcement. There is, however, not much literature on the impact of prior business consultancy experience on the success of the venture or in obtaining successful VC financing. From our data, business consultancy appeared as the third most significant experience a founder should possess, which thus made us consider that a founder's prior experience as a business consultant serves as a relevant signal to VCs. We believe that business consultants better understand the dynamics of the new industry, as they often consult projects that are short and cyclical in nature. They also have the skills to quickly understand the market requirements and market demands for their products. Additionally, they possess project management skills, are used to working under strict deadlines, and must master communication skills early in their careers, as they must often address the top executives of the companies. All these skills can be effectively used during new venture creation. Business consultants also know how to perform strategic, operational, and financial analyses for their clients. The above justifications lead to the following hypothesis:  \n\nHypothesis 2c. Prior business consultancy experience of founders facilitates access to more rounds of VC financing.  \n\n### 2.2. Networking signals  \n\nExtant literature defines a social network as a “web of personal connections and relationships for the purpose of securing favors in personal and/or organizational action\" (Adler and Kwon, 2002; Burt, 1997; Granovetter, 1985; Groh and Wallmeroth, 2016). Members of social networks are better able to access and exchange new knowledge, thus facilitating knowledge creation. In firms or organizational settings, social networks may involve relationships among individuals in a formal structure of business connections. For the purposes of our paper, we focus on social networks as an informal structure of personal relations bound by institutional space (Sorenson, 2003). We look to the quality of the network as certified by a degree from an elite educational system which not only legitimizes quality but also enables access to equally successful alumni. The extent of the network is measured by the size of the entrepreneurialteam.  \n\n#### 2.2.1. A degree from an elite educational institute  \n\nA degree from an elite educational institute is perceived as a quality signal. Engel and Keilbach (2007), using a sample of mostly private Germans firms, found that the education of the founders significantly influences the likelihood of receiving VC. Maidique (1986) established that VCs considered founders with advanced degrees from high-quality institutions to affect their startup success. Conversely, Audretsch and Lehmann (2004), employing a sample of 341 German startups listed in the Neuer Markt, highlighted that the number of members of a firm's top management team with a Ph.D. degree had no impact on access to VC. Thus, the existing literature on this topic is quite inconclusive. Whilst most of the extant knowledge has been derived from and relevant to developed economies, the situation in developing economies still remains an open question. How does networking capital help the entrepreneur raise financing for a startup based in India? In particular, we are interested in knowing whether or not graduating from an elite educational institute increases the likelihood of financing compared to graduating from other non-elite educational institutes. We base our assertion on the fact that degrees from recognized elite institutes serves not only as a credibility signal to VCs in comparison to those who graduate from non-elite institutes but also signals that, throughout the time spent in higher education, a useful network of equally successful elites is established in an informal manner. Following this assertion, we build upon our first hypotheses:  \n\nHypothesis 3. Indian startup founders with degrees from elite educational institutes are likely to attract more rounds of VC financing.  \n\n#### 2.2.2. The entrepreneurial team (the number of founders)  \n\nGartner et al. (1994) made the argument that the entrepreneur in entrepreneurship is typically plural, not singular. Growing literature (Ensley et al., 1998; Gartner et al., 1994; Lechler, 2001; Reich, 1987) on this topic has established the fact that the activities involved in establishing and growing a new venture are more often taken by entrepreneurial teams rather than by a solitary entrepreneur. By pooling founder's talents, teams can resolve complex problems (Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven, 1990; Hambrick and D'Aveni, 1992). Entrepreneurial teams are more likely to attract financial resources such as VC and traditional capital through banks (Beckman et al., 2007; Cooper and Daily, 1997). The size of the entrepreneurial team has been reported to have a positive association with venture performance in a variety of settings, as larger teams are likely to have more resources (Colombo and Grilli, 2005; Cooper and Bruno, 1977; Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven, 1990; Feeser and Willard, 1990; Haleblian and Finkelstein, 1993). We believe that a higher number of founders on the entrepreneurial team is beneficial as well in the context of India, where the startup ecosystem is not so friendly for new ventures and involves a lot of bureaucracy and administrative burden. Having a team of co-founders with complementary skill sets not only helps in sharing the burden of work but also enables startup access to the numerous co-founders' networks. Accordingly, we expect that a higher number of founders should increase the startup's social network capital. Consequently,weposit:  \n\nHypothesis 4. Indian startups that have more founders in their entrepreneurial team are likely to attract more rounds of VC financing  \n\n### 2.3. The strength of social networking as a digital signal  \n\nPodolny (2005) has proposed that “the greater market participants’ uncertainty about the underlying quality of a producer and the producer's product, the more that market participants will rely on the producer's status to make inferences about quality.\" Startups can effectively use social media as a crucial medium not only for the exchange of information with clients but also to reduce information scarcity problems that exist between startups and investors. A startup's social media presence and fan following could demonstrate the startup's ability to lure consumers, strengthen its brand, and engage and retain consumers (Vismara, 2016). This, in turn, can serve as a positive signal to VCs and increase the likelihood of securing funding. Taken broadly, existing studies suggest (Goh et al., 2013; Luo et al., 2013) that the use of social media can influence overall firm performance, including the success of earlystage firms and their ability to obtain financing. While these studies mostly use data from established companies, we expect to see a similar logic at work for startup firms. With respect to signaling function, social networking may also serve as legitimization for the startup idea/product or process and, consequently, may facilitate the acquisition of financial capital. Thus, we posit:  \n\nHypothesis 5. Startups that have more followers (fans) on social media (Twitter/Facebook/LinkedIn) are more likely to receive more rounds of VC financing.  \n\n## 3. Empirical strategy  \n\n### 3.1. Data collection  \n\nWe collected data comprising 47 active startups and 55 failed startups from 2014-2017 through several online sources and random searches (Crunchbasel1 , Traxn2, Trak.in13, $\\mathrm{Inc}42^{14}$ and Internet specified word-based searches15). The Indian VC industry has passed through three distinct phases in the last decade: the growth stage, maturation and moderation, and renewed optimism. We analyzed data from 2014-2017, as these years were marked with heavy investments in Indian startups, and, more specifically, with higher quality investments in digital startups. We included failed startups to avoid survivorship bias in our sample. T-tests indicated no significant differences between the 102 active startups and failed ones in terms of age, sector, and city. We selected only the technological startups in the domains of Consumer Internet services, Fintech, business analytics, Edtech, Foodtech, Healthtech, Logistics, and Enterprise Applications. We collected information related to total funds raised and multiple rounds of financing through the Crunchbase database, and we cross-checked the results with Traxn and with online media reports (Trak.in and Inc42) to check the accuracy of the data. We were also able to obtain information on the names of founders, which we then used on LinkedIn to collect more information related to human capital variables, such as previous experience (number of years of experience and kind of prior experience), educational institution, and gender. We then collected information related to the strength of the social media network of funded startups through LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter and added a combined variable of the total number of fan followers. We also collected information on the region of the startup, the year of launch, and the sector. A detailed analysis of the variables and from where they were collected is provided in the Appendix (A1). Data collection ended in July 2018, therefore any data after that date go beyond the scope of our study.  \n\n#### 3.1.1. Dependent variables  \n\nTo test the independent effects of human capital and social networking on access to financing, we use rounds of financing (FIN_ROUNDs)16 as our dependent variable. Based on the data collected for both active startups and failed startups, we found that only one startup was funded through debt. All of the other startups were funded initially through VC and, later, funded through both VC and private equity. We collected the information on the number of financing rounds starting from seed funding through to the last funding round as of July 2018, for both kinds of firms. We found that while the average round of funding received by successful firms was 3, for failed firms it was only 1. We also collected information on the total amount of financing raised as of July 2018. The average funding amount for the still-active startups was around $\\operatorname{US}\\$300$ million, whereas for failed firms it was $\\$4$ million.We needed to consider that in the case of failed startups, the details of the amount raised were absent for 20 startups. Being unable to utilize the amount of funding as the dependent variable, we employed rounds of financing. Only VC and private equity funds are included in our data sample and we do not include funds provided by the government or the founders.  \n\n#### 3.1.2. Independent variables  \n\n3.1.2.1. Founders' human and networking capital. We argue that the founders' human capital, particularly their years of prior experience and prior relevant experience -industry-related prior experience, previous founding experience, previous business consultancy experience, an educational degree from elite institute7, and the presence of an entrepreneurial team, rather than being a solo entrepreneur—sends signals about the quality of the founding members' productivity and effectiveness to VCs. We treat these types of human capital separately.  \n\nWe include an independent variable related to the total years of average experience (YEARS_EXP) of the founder and also included dummy variables related to relevant prior experience. Our descriptive statistics show that out of 214 founders, $36\\%$ of the founders have had prior experience as a founder, $21\\%$ have had prior experience as a software engineer, and $15\\%$ have had prior experience as a business consultant. The other $28\\%$ have had other prior experiences related to accounting, investing, and advocating, or have worked as a scientist or product and marketing manager. Consequently, we believe these skills (prior founder, prior technical, and prior business consultant) are significant for startups and help them to access financing. As such, we created dummy variables related to relevant experience: at least one founder has prior technical experience (ATLEAST PRIORTECH EXP), at least one founder has prior founding experience (ATLEAST PRIORFOUNDER_EXP), and at least one founder has prior business consultant experience (ATLEAST_PRIORCONSULT_EXP) (Gimmon and Levie, 2010; Hsu, 2007). A degree from IIT, IM, BITS, and foreign universities that are recognized elite institutes (DEG_ELITE) is a dummy variable that takes a value of 1, and 0 otherwise. Out of the 214 founders in our data sample, nearly $83\\%$ of them attended IIT, IIM, BITS PILANI, or an elite foreign university, and the rest attended other educational institutes in India. As such, we believe attendance at one of these institutes should result in better access to financing rounds.  \n\nWe include an entrepreneurial team as depicted by the variable number of founders (NO_OF_FOUNDERS). The presence of an entrepreneurial team has been shown to positively impact venture performance (Colombo and Grilli, 2005; Cooper and Bruno, 1977; Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven, 1990; Feeser and Willard, 1990; Haleblian and Finkelstein, 1993). Our descriptive statistics present only 24 solo entrepreneurs; in this regard, we consider this an important variable that impacts access to financing.  \n\n3.1.2.2. Social networking. We include variable social networking (SOCIAL_ NETWORK) to determine the impact of social networking, or digital signals as represented by the number of fan followers, on multiple social media sites with access to financing. The social networking variable takes value from the social media sites of each startup, such as Twitter (the number of followers), LinkedIn (the number of connections), and Facebook (the number of fans). We add them all together to determine the strength of their digital networking. The average number of connections for active startups is around 218,870 and for failed startups is only 72,380. We believe that founders of failed startups were not able to gather strength on their social media profiles, which could have been interpreted as a negative digital signal by the investors. We believe that social media strength plays a very important role for not only creating brand awareness or marketing products but also to gain traction and help access subsequent rounds of financing.  \n\n#### 3.1.3. Control variables  \n\nWe controlled for certain variables that might impact the rounds of financing. First, we controlled for geographic location (Blau, 1977; Sorenson and Stuart, 2001) to account for spatial proximity to VCs (Gompers and Lerner, 1999; Sorenson and Stuart, 2001). Geographical distribution of these startups, according to the data, was as follows: 26 are located in Bangalore, 47 in the Northern Capital Region (NCR), 16 in Mumbai, and the remainder in other cities in India. Consequently, we coded this variable 1 for startups located in premium cities for investments (e.g., Bangalore, NCR, and Mumbai) (Florida and Kenney, 1988; Chatterji et al., 2014) and 0 for ventures located in other areas. We have three dummy variables: City_Bangalore, City_NCR, and City_Mumbai. These cities are of strategic importance, as Bangalore is known as the Silicon Valley of India and home to many technology startups; Mumbai is known as the financial capital and home to many fintechs; and the NCR region is also developing into a home to many new technology startups. Second, we controlled for the age of the startup, as investors may prefer to invest in more established startups that have established market positions (Hsu, 2007; Shane and Stuart, 2002). Finally, we control for industry, by creating dummy variables for industry based on our descriptive statistics. The following dummy variables represent the different sectors of technology startups: consumer internet (CONSUMER_INTERNET), healthtech (HEALTHTECH), edtech (EDTECH), and fintech (FINTECH). Additional control variables related to founder's gender was also included in the regression model, as our descriptive statistics suggest a huge gender bias, where women only represent 8 percent of 214 founders. The detailed descriptive statistics are provided in Table 2. To avoid biased results given different units of measurement applying to variables, all variables were normalized except the dummy controls.  \n\n### 3.2. Methodology  \n\nWe used SPsS statistical software to test the main empirical hypotheses discussed in the previous sections; this section includes two steps. First, we estimated a regression model to predict the number of financing rounds (FIN_ROUNDS) as a function of the various independent variables and control variables discussed earlier. Post hoc multicollinearity diagnostics indicated variance inflation factors (VIFs) well below the threshold of 5 for all the independent variables tested. However, for rigor and robustness, based on the observed correlation matrix, we also ran structural equation modelling (SEM) with explicit covariance paths for all a priori statistically significant correlations (observed and expected) between the independent variables. This ability of SEM to explicitly handle multicollinearity is one of its important advantages compared to traditional ordinary least square (OLS) multiple regression.  \n\nBased on the hypothetical factors that could explain the number of financing rounds of startups in India, our multiple regressiol model (Model 1) contains all the independent variables of the study to test for the predicted signal. It is as follows:  \n\n(1) $\\begin{array}{r}{F I N_{\\mathrm{c}}R O U N D S_{i}=\\beta_{o}+\\beta_{I}S\\mathrm{OCIAL}_{\\mathrm{-}}\\mathrm{NETWOR}_{i}+\\beta_{2}A G E_{i}+\\beta_{3}\\mathrm{NO}_{\\mathrm{c}}\\mathrm{OF}_{\\mathrm{-}}\\mathrm{FOUNDE}R S_{i}+\\beta_{d}Y E A R S\\mathrm{}_{\\mathrm{c}}E X P_{i}+\\beta_{S}\\mathrm{DO}_{\\mathrm{c}}\\mathrm{OF}_{\\mathrm{-}},}\\end{array}$ EG_ELITE; + P6ATLEAST_PRIORFOUNDER ${\\mathrm{EXP}}_{i}+\\beta_{7}$ ATLEAST_PRIORTECH $\\mathrm{EXP}_{i}+\\beta_{8}\\mathrm{A}$ TLEAST_PRIORCONSULT $\\mathrm{{\\_EXP}}_{i}+\\beta_{g}G E N D E R_{i}$ +β1oCON $\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathrm{SUMER.INTERNET}_{i}+\\beta_{I I}E D T E C H_{i}+\\beta_{I2}\\mathrm{HEALTHTECH}_{i}+\\beta_{I3}\\mathrm{FINTECH}_{i}+\\beta_{I4}C I T Y_{.}N C R_{i}+\\beta_{I S}C I T Y_{.}B A=0.}\\end{array}$ INGALORE; $+\\beta_{16}C I T Y\\_M U M B A I_{i}+\\varepsilon_{i}.$  \n\nTo further understand the relative contributions of the various predictors, we also ran 4 more regression models. Model 2 excluded the variable SOCIAL_NETWORK, Model 3 excluded NO_OF_FOUNDERS, Model 4 excluded DEG_ELITE, and Model 5 excluded all control variables to observe whether or not these variables could potentially mask the effects of other variables in the original model.  \n\n#### 3.2.1.Supplementary analyses for robustness and cross-validation  \n\nWe empirically tackled the theoretical model presented in Fig. 1 using structural equation modelling (SEM) as a robustness test. As mentioned earlier, the advantage of using SEM instead of the combination of aggregate scores from the factor analysis and traditional regression models with multiple inputs is that a) it allows for explicit handling of multicollinearity through covariance paths, unlike multiple regressions, and b) measurement error is not aggregated in a residual error term. Further the evaluation of the models is based on a diverse set of fit indices including absolute, relative, and comparative fit indices as well as information like the Akaike Information Criterion and the Bayesian Information Criterion. One common rule-of-thumb for implementing SEM is that it should have an a priori minimum threshold of 100 subjects (Williams et al., 2004) and a post hoc Hoelter's N of 75-200; our sample meets these thresholds: $({\\bf n}=102\\$ ;Hoelter's $\\Nu=139$ $95\\%$ confidence) and 152 ( $99\\%$ confidence). Unstandardized and standardized coefficients estimates are presented in the following Results section in order to allow multiple perspective comparisons with the conventional regression model, as well as to compare relative contributions (effect sizes) of the various independent and control variables.  \n\n## 4. Results  \n\nTables 1 and 2 reports the bivariate correlations and descriptive statistics, respectively, for the variables in the analysis. Significant correlations were found between the dependent variable and the explanatory variables “Educational Institute,” “Number of Founders,” and “Social Network.” Correlation analysis results indicate weak levels $(<.3)$ of correlations between all independent variables except “Educational Institute” and “Prior founder experience,” where we observe strong significant correlation (0.340). Further, we examined multicollinearity using variance inflation factors (VIF). The general rule of thumb is that VIFs exceeding 10 are a sign of serious multicollinearity. The VIF value for all studied variables is $<3.0$ (maximum value of 2,972), suggesting that multicollinearity is not a major concern (Hair et al., 2010). A strong negative and significant correlation was found between sector and city control variables. To eliminate possible collinearity problems and more than verify the VIF values, we performed a robustness test using structured equation modelling (SEM).  \n\nThe main results of our regressions analysis are summarized in Table 3. Table 3 displays the unstandardized coefficients (beta and standard error),the standardized beta and sig., the number of observations, the F and sig., and the $\\mathtt{R}^{2}$ and adjusted $\\mathtt{R}^{2}$ for each model. These analyses (ANOVA) resulted in 4 statistically significant models (Models 1, 3, 4, and 5). Model 1 is the model that includes all variables $[\\mathrm{F}(16,85)=2,728;$ $\\mathrm{~\\bf~p~}<0.002$ ， $\\mathrm{R}^{2}=0.339]$ . The independent variables SOCIAL NETWORK $(\\beta=0.469$ .， $\\mathbf{t}=4.907$ $\\textbf{p}<0.001)$ , NO_OF_FOUNDERS $(\\beta=0.280;\\mathrm{t}=2.821;\\mathrm{p}<0.006)$ and DEG_ELITE $(\\beta=0.216;\\mathrm{t}=2.086;\\mathrm{p}<0.040)$ predicted the FIN_ROUNDS. This model allowed us to test our hypotheses (H1-H5). We used the other models to ensure that significant independent variables were not masking the effect of other ones.  \n\nWe find that the educational institute, the number of founders, and the social network has a positive significant effect for all significant models. Given the fact that the coefficient for the social network was highly significant for all models, we ran additional models excluding this variable to test the robustness of Model 1. This analysis suggested a drop of the explanatory power of all models, as indicated by $\\scriptstyle\\mathrm{{R}}^{2}$ : however, three models still remained significant (Prob $>$ F: $<~0.05)$ and did not impact our final conclusion in any manner. However, Model 2, the model without the “SOCIAL_NETWORK\" variable is not significant, and the adjusted $\\mathtt{R}^{2}$ is almost irelevant (0.004). This suggests that this variable “SOCIAL NETWORK\" is an important predictor of access to VC financing for Indian startups. Our results support other studies that find the use of social media can influence overall firm performance, including the success of early-stage firms and their ability to obtain financing (Goh et al., 2013; Luo et al., 2013). Furthermore, it was found that the number of founders “NO_OF FOUNDERS\" tends to have significantly higher levels of influence in the number of finance rounds. This result also supports previous research that finds larger teams are likely to have access to more resources (Colombo and Grilli, 2005; Cooper and Bruno, 1977; Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven, 1990; Feeser and Willard, 1990; Haleblian and Finkelstein, 1993).  \n\n'(p- sqeea upuadapu il pue upudp D qnn seu - sunea seeon   \n  \n  \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>17</td><td>1.00 1.00 60-</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1.00 -.091 -.084</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>.372** .349** -.324** 00'</td></tr><tr><td>切 3 2</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.00 -.077 .056 -.026 .203*</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>.399** 1.00 214* -.080 -.123 -.095</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>.541** .252* .242* 001 .056 .080 .019</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1.00 .035 .015 -.012 083 -.037 -.056 -.078</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>1.00 -.101 .032 .047 045 031 064 090 090</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1.00 125 007 016 026 .090 -.081 .141 .119 .059</td></tr><tr><td>7 6</td><td>1.00 144 124 .030 054 031 .051 .010 .170 -.193 -.095</td></tr><tr><td>1.00 5</td><td>.074 .047 .082 204* -.118 222* 1.00 .087 .159 109 148 042</td></tr><tr><td>.117 .064 1.00 -.067 .064 012 4</td><td>.039 -.020 .144 .201* -.061 .054 -.056 .046 -.074 .031</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>187** .116 .084 .056 044 .024 108 005 940 -.013</td></tr><tr><td>270** .005 232* 1.00 .153 .063 .071 3</td><td>.012 .051 .040 .021 .026 107 -.176 .053</td></tr><tr><td>1.00 .187* -.053 .187 2 223* .240** .357** 1.00 .126 .163 .139 .074 121 .058</td><td>.340** .087 .093 .013 .089 .102 .065 .093 .091 .085 -.090 .038</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>.079 .004 .039 .031 .039 900 -.033</td></tr><tr><td>Prior Consultant experience Prior founder experience EducationalInstitute Number ofFounders Prior tech experience Years ofExperience Social Network City Bangalore City NCR Variables Gender Age 10 1 2 3 9 8 2 3 4 5 6 7</td><td>ConsumerInternet City Mumbai HealthTech Fintech Ed tech</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTable2 Descriptive statistics related to active vs. failed startups.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Total mean</td><td>Active startups mean</td><td>Failed startups mean</td></tr><tr><td>Rounds of Financing</td><td>1.82 (1.28)</td><td>2.34 (1.55)</td><td>1.38 (0.76)</td></tr><tr><td>AverageFunding</td><td></td><td>300, 062,191</td><td>4, 678,571</td></tr><tr><td>Elite Educational Institute</td><td>73%</td><td>74%</td><td>58%</td></tr><tr><td>OtherEducationalInstitutes</td><td>27%</td><td>26%</td><td>42%</td></tr><tr><td>Prior Technical Experience</td><td>21%</td><td>20%</td><td>21%</td></tr><tr><td>Prior Founders Experience</td><td>36%</td><td>38%</td><td>32%</td></tr><tr><td>Prior Consultants Experience</td><td>15%</td><td>15%</td><td>16%</td></tr><tr><td>OtherPrior Experiences</td><td>28%</td><td>27%</td><td>29%</td></tr><tr><td>Years ofExperience</td><td>12.01 (5.92)</td><td>12.93 (5.03)</td><td>11.22 (6.54)</td></tr><tr><td>Average no.of founders</td><td>2.10 (1.08)</td><td>2,32 (1.27)</td><td>1.91 (0.84)</td></tr><tr><td>Bangalore</td><td>25%</td><td>34%</td><td>18%</td></tr><tr><td>NCR</td><td>46%</td><td>38%</td><td>53%</td></tr><tr><td>Mumbai</td><td>16%</td><td>15%</td><td>16%</td></tr><tr><td>Other cities</td><td>13%</td><td>13%</td><td>13%</td></tr><tr><td>Male founders Female founders</td><td>92%</td><td>95%</td><td>88%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>8%</td><td>5%</td><td>12%</td></tr><tr><td>ConsumerInternet</td><td>59%</td><td>45%</td><td>71%</td></tr><tr><td>Fintech</td><td>9%</td><td>13%</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>Healthtech Edtech</td><td>8%</td><td>15%</td><td>2%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>7%</td><td>13%</td><td>2%</td></tr><tr><td>Others</td><td>17%</td><td>16%</td><td>20%</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: Standard deviation in parentheses. Total $\\mathbf{n}=102$ Active $\\mathrm{~n~}=~47$ ;Failed $\\mathrm{~n~}=~55$  \n\nSurprisingly, our analysis indicates that exploratory variables related to the traditional signals of founder experience (the number of years or the type of prior experience) do not have significant impact on the number of financing rounds. This is contrary to prior research that finds founders? industry experience to be valued (Brush et al., 2001), especially by VCs in making investment decisions (MacMillan et al., 1985). We believe for investors in developing economies where institutions are arguably weaker, informal quality signals may be much more important to mitigate information asymmetry. It is therefore possible that investors in new technology startups in India may place more value on networking and digital signals than traditional human capital signals.  \n\n### 4.1. Results on hypothesized effects  \n\nHere, we summarize the hypotheses test results, reported in Table 3. We used Model 1 to discuss our findings for the hypothesized main effects. All our hypotheses are directional. Our first 6 hypotheses are related to human capital and networks, and the last one to the strength of social or digital networking.  \n\nH1 - not supported. Experienced founders are likely to access more rounds of VC financing. The number of years of experience founder has is not significant in the access to financial capital through VCs.  \n\nH2a - not supported. Founders who have prior startup experience are likely to access more rounds of VC financing. Prior startup experience of a founder is not significant in the access to financial capital through VCs.  \n\nH2b - not supported. Technically experienced founders are likely to access more rounds of VC financing. Prior technical experience of a founder is not significant in the access to financial capital through VCs.  \n\nH2c - not supported. Founders with prior business consultancy experience are likely to access more rounds of VC financing. Prior business consultancy of a founder is not significant in the access to financial capital through VCs.  \n\nH3 - supported. Indian startups founders who obtain a degree from an elite educational institute are likely to attract more rounds offinancing $(\\mathrm{Beta}=0.574,\\mathrm{~p~<~0.01})$ . We find that the educational institute has a significant positive impact on the number of financing rounds.  \n\nH4 - supported. Indian startups that have more founders in their entrepreneurial team are likely to attract more rounds of financing $(\\mathrm{Beta}=0.332,\\mathrm{p}<0.01)$ . In line with previous research, we find that the number of founders has a significant positive impact on the number of financing rounds for Indian startups.  \n\nI sp sa s s   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Expected sign Sig.

In our structured equation model, we present all variables that directly relate to the number of financing rounds. In general, we are able to verifiy that the relationship between the variables educational institute “DEG_ELITE,” the number of founders “NO_OF FOUNDERS,” and social capital “SOCIAL_NETWORK\" with financing rounds “FIN_ROUNDS\" is significant (see Table 4). The high levels of association indicate that these three variables influence the number of financing rounds. The SEM results presenteda $\\mathrm{Chi^{2}}(95)=86.543_{\\cdot}$ apractical significance $=~0.720$ $\\mathrm{R}^{2}=0.360$  \n\n## 5. Conclusion and limitation of research  \n\nVCs confronted with information asymmetry are likely to look for certain signals to reduce informational gaps in the exercise of their judgement. This leads to the question, if information asymmetry is potentially heightened due to the continuously evolving nature of digital startups or the higher institutional burdens in certain countries, how would this affect the signals? We believe our research contributes to extant literature as we link signaling theory to traditional human capital, networking, and social media networking in the context of the acquisition of VC funding by technology startups in a developing country with higher institutional burdens (Podolny, 1993, and Podolny, 1994, and Podolny, 2005; Spence, 1974). We build five main hypotheses (H1-H5). Our findings contain a series of larger implications for entrepreneurs, investors, and policy makers. To begin, our results suggest that traditional human capital factors may not necessarily serve as quality signals for technology startups in India, and other measures of entrepreneurial quality, such as quality of networks (networking signals) and social media networking (digital signals) may serve as better quality signals to access financing. The empirical analysis highlights the following main results. The first two main results are related to the role of traditional human capital in the funding of startups, in particular the work experience of the founder. Our empirical results suggest that years of experience do not impact the access of financing of a startup and neither do prior relevant experiences (as a founder, as a software engineer, or as a business consultant). A degree from an elite educational institute and the breadth of the entrepreneurial team are positively associated with the likelihood of access to financing. The third main result is related to the strength of social media networking on the studied startups. This result makes an important contribution to the signaling literature (as most of the current literature focuses on the developed nations of the US and Europe), especially from the perspective of emerging economies, since our study provides support for the changing importance of signals over time in the context of acquisition of VC financing and in the virtual world, where the impact of social media cannot be excluded. Indeed, out of all the digital signals, social media networking has the strongest impact on access to funding.  \n\nWhen interpreting the results of our study, certain limitations need to be kept in mind. First, we have tested the impact of traditional human capital factors, networking, and social media networking on access to the financing of startups. However, in the actual decision-making process, certain other factors related to revenue growth rates or estimated market size or information about patents may play a role as well. Information for failed startups is absent. Second, our study is focused on India, and similar research on other emerging countries should be considered on topic. Third, we investigate the relationship between signal and financial resource acquisition and adopt a static approach (Elitzur and Gavious, 2003; Higgins and Gulati, 2006). While our study provides important insights, finance acquisition is not a static process but rather a continuous process where different signals can play a different role at different stages. Some signals will be relevant for some stages but become irrelevant in subsequent stages. Thus, it would be interesting to develop a model that tests how different signals help the startup to acquire resources during different stages. Fourth, the study is mainly quantitative and lacks a qualitative view from investors as to what makes a strong signal during the financing rounds. Thus, we encourage future research that can consider integrating both qualitative and quantitative variables so that more understanding can be propounded into the contingencies that enhance the financing of startups. Fifth, the validity and authenticity of the data are limited to what we have collected from multiple databases such as Traxn, Crunchbase, Techinasia, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook. Even though we have sought to verify the information collected, there may still be a chance of some discrepancies, which cannot be avoided. Lastly, even though we establish causality relationships through our study, our work was done to support a set of postulated hypotheses; it may not imply or establish a causal relationship.  \n\n# CRediT authorship contribution statement  \n\nNirjhar Nigam: Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft.

Analyzing a unique dataset from India, we investigate the impact of traditional quality signals (e.g., the founders? years of experience, prior industry experience); networking signals (e.g., degrees from elite educational institutes, the breadth of an entrepreneurial team); and digital signals (e.g., the social media presence of the startup on multiple social media sites) on the access to venture capital financing. We find that while networking and digital signals positively impact access to financing, traditional human capital signals do not have any significant impact on the process.  \n\nKeywords: Startups; Entrepreneurship; Financing; Digital Signals; Human capital, Social media networking; Venture capital; Signals  \n\n## 1.INTRODUCTION  \n\nEntrepreneurial startups play a fundamental role in the promotion of innovation and economic growth (Acs & Audretsch, 1988; Acs et al., 2008; Audretsch, 2007a and 2007b; Audretsch et al., 2009; Baumol, 196; Chavis et al., 2011; Cumming & Johan, 2014; Cumming et al., 2014; Fairlie & Chatterji, 2013; Klapper & Love, 2011; Marcotte, 2012; McMullen, 2011; Naude, 2010; Stam & Wennberg, 2009; Thurik et al., 2008). The creation of new entrepreneurial and innovative ventures requires capital financing and, as such, there is a large body of research looking into access to entrepreneurial finance for entrepreneurs and startups (Bhide, 1992; Bonini et al., 2012; Fossen, 2014; Nahata, 2008; Wang & Wang, 2012; Li et al., 2016). We know that sustained financing can ensure high levels of growth and survival of new ventures (Cosh et al., 2009; Smallbone et al., 2003; Storey, 2016; Van Auken & Carter, 1989) while lack of financing can result in low levels of growth and an increased likelihood of failure (Alsos et al., 2006; Basu & Parker, 2001). As financing is crucial for startups not only at the initial stages but also at the later stages for continued growth and survival, extant research has sought to determine the factors that play a significant role in access to finance, such as the human capital of the founders (Almus & Nerlinger, 1999; Colombo & Grilli, 2005; Cressy, 1996; Cumming & Johan, 2008a; Stuart & Abetti, 1990; Westhead & Cowling, 1995) and founders′ social networks (Goh et al., 2013; Hochberg et al., 2007; Luo et al., 2013) .  \n\nHuman capital plays a significant role in entrepreneurial endeavors. Researchers have divided human capital into two broad categories: formal and informal. Formal signifies individual educational qualifications, skills, and abilities, whereas informal signifies human capital developed through work and familial experiences. We know that educational investments and work experience can translate into economic advantages (Becker, 1964; Killeen et al., 1999; Langelett, 2002) and, if applied towards an entrepreneurial activity, can result in improved entrepreneurial judgment (Baron & Ensley, 2006; Corbett, 2005; McGrath & MacMillan, 2000; Parker, 2006; Ronstadt, 1988; Shane, 2000; Wiklund & Shepherd,  \n\n2003) and forecasting ability (Clement, 1999; Mikhail et al., 1997). It is clear that the impact of human capital on entrepreneurial activity and judgment has been previously widely studied in more developed economies. There is however limited empirical evidence on the role of human capital in startup financing for firms in developing or emerging markets where institutions are arguably weaker, and informal quality signals are much more important to mitigate information asymmetry. In this paper we analyze Indian tech startups to determine the extent formal and informal human capital signals serve as positive signals to mitigate information asymmetries and potentially impact acces to venture capital (VC) for Indian entrepreneurs. Our formal and informal measures include total years of experience, the type of work experience (technical, founder, or consultant), the degree to which an elite educational institute provides access to a network of resources, and the breadth of the entrepreneurial team.  \n\nIn India, technology has been a major driver of innovation for the last 25 years. Major business opportunities have surfaced in the technological front; consequently, there has been exponential growth in the number of startups, which has attracted investments from a large number of venture capitalists (VCs). From 2012-2017, reports show a significant increase in investments by VCs in Indian startups. The transaction value has increased over 13.5 times (from $\\$94$ million in 2011 to $\\$1.275$ billion in $2016)^{1}$ . In 2017, investments by VCs in the country reached record levels at $\\$26.5$ billion.  \n\nWith such rapid growth, policymakers face considerable challenges. One challenge is mitigating the inefficiency of the matching process between investors and new technological startups, especially in a financial market which still largely remains imperfect (e.g. Colombo & Grilli, 2005, 2009). In India, graduates from top engineering colleges are no longer restricted to only joining the corporate world; thus, those with engineering, mathematical, and analytical skills are increasingly incentivized to create their own entrepreneurial firms. A report published by NASSCOM?statesthat $50\\%$ of the founders of new firms have engineering backgrounds, $25\\%$ of them have management backgrounds, and $25\\%$ have other educational qualifications. In 2018, nearly half of the startups in India had one or more founders who studied in one or more of the country's top four engineering and management colleges: the $\\mathrm{IITs}^{3}$ , IMs\\*, BITS', or the Indian School of Business°. In the United States, we observe the same trend in relation to Harvard, Stanford, and $\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{I}\\mathbf{T}^{7}$ according to Pitchbook and Crunchbase statistics. These considerations raise our initial question of whether the traditional human capital signal of previous work experience continues to signal quality to investors, as suggested by extant research. Our follow-up question is whether a degree from an elite institute, which may signal quality and increased social capital due to a higher probability of access to a network of high quality and successful alumni and other social connections, results in greater ease of obtaining startup financing from VCs.  \n\nWe believe another key factor in gaining startup financing is digital network signaling, or using social networks to amass numbers of followers on multiple sites such as Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Prior research has already linked social capital to the propensity for investors to invest in the Australian crowdfunding context, and we seek to extend this research to our analysis of Indian technology startups (Ahlers et al., 2015). Startups and founders who successfully network and build relationships digitally with their consumers build a successful brand image, which serves as a positive signal to VCs. Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of social media in promoting word-of-mouth information diffusion (Aral et al., 2013; Chevalier & Mayzlin, 2006; Dellarocas et al., 2007; Forman et al., 2008; Zhu & Zhang, 2010) in marketing goods and services (Aral et al., 2013; Bharadwaj et al., 2013) and by serving as a platform for greater consumer engagement and participation (Chen et al., 2015; Ghose & Han, 2011; Goes et al., 2014; Li & Wu, 2018; Miller & Tucker, 2013). In this study, we hand collect information from various social media networks (LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook) to determine the strength of the startup's digital network and how it impacts a startup's access to financing.  \n\nBy extending Crane & Hartwell (2019), we link signaling theory with human capital theory and social capital theory to test our developed hypotheses. We collected data from 102 startups that obtained funding between the years 2014-2017. To address potential survivorship bias, we included both failed and active startups. Our results are not only illuminating but also counter-intuitive. We find that the networking and digital signals evidenced by a degree from an elite educational institute (India or abroad), the breadth of the entrepreneurial team (number of founders), and the higher the social media fan following positively impacts access to finance. Founders^ years of experience, as well as their prior industry experience as a founder, more specifically their prior experience as technical engineers and consultants, do not show any impact on financing. These findings, related to traditional human capital signals, are rather unexpected as extant research (Baum & Silverman, 2004; Beckman et al., 2007; Burton, 2002; Gompers & Lerner, 2001; Hsu, 2007) using data from developed countries (mainly the US and Europe) show contrasting results. These finding can have several implications for digital entrepreneurs, policymakers, and for VCs, especially in developing countries other than India.  \n\nWe believe that this study makes important contributions to the existing literature on VC financing (Audretsch et al., 2012; Baum & Silverman 2004; Cao & Hsu, 2011; Conti et al., 2013; Cumming & Johan, 2014; Greenberg, 2013; Haussler et al., 2012; Hoenen et al., 2014; Hsu & Ziedonis, 2013; Mann & Sager, 2007; Cumming & Zhang, 2016), as this study is the first empirical study, to the best of our knowledge, which links human capital theory, social capital theory, and signaling theory to show the impact of human capital and social capital on obtaining VC financing in the developing market context.  \n\nThe remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows. We begin by reviewing the relevant literature on signaling; the problems of asymmetry, human capital, and social networking; and then we use this research to develop our hypotheses and theoretical framework in Section 2. We describe the research method, data collection, and variables used to test the hypotheses in Section 3. We present our results of multivariate logistic regressions and our robustness tests in Section 4. We conclude and discuss the limitations of our research in Section 5.  \n\n## 2. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES  \n\nEvans & Bahrami (1995) sugest that technological startups? are prone to high levels of business risk, changing consumer preferences, fastchanging technology, and a shortened product life cycle. To establish themselves in such a complex and dynamic environment, startups need continued access to external financing as lack of adequate financing has been shown to increase the likelihood of failure (Aspelund et al., 2005; Carter & Van Auken, 2005; Cassar, 2004; Coleman, 2000; Gaskill et al., 1993; Sandberg & Hofer 1987). Inadequate access to financing also affects the growth potential of new ventures. VC literature finds that under-capitalized firms experience lower levels of growth (Alsos et al., 2006; Chandler & Hanks, 1998). A recent research report'o showed that more than $90\\%$ of startups fail. Similarly, in India, a study conducted by IBM found that more than $90\\%$ of startups in India fail in the first five years owing to lack of pioneering innovation and funding. New ventures in India may face heightened barriers to traditional sources of financing due to higher institutional burdens, resulting in opacity and information asymmetry that limits the availability of information (Cumming & Johan, 2008a; and 2013; De Clercq et el., 2010; Petersen & Rajan, 1995). Entrepreneurs and founders will have significant knowledge about the startup's future prospects and growth, due to a higher level of involvement in the business, while the external investor is likely to posses more information regarding the marketing and trends in the industry in general. In such cases, when there is a presence of asymmetric information, entrepreneurs may pursue a different strategy than what would be prefered by the investors (Gompers, 2002). It is difficult for investors to monitor ex-post the behavior of entrepreneurs, as entrepreneurs may behave opportunistically after obtaining external financing (Cumming & Johan, 2007; 2008a, 2008b). Additionally, for the investors, it is difficult to ascertain ex-ante the risks and returns of the projects of firms that lack a track record and are developing innovative technologies. For startups, all of these factors create barriers to raising external financing, as they do not have a sufficient track record, credit history, or collateral with which they can use to alleviate such problems (MacMillan et al., 1985; Tyebjee & Bruno, 1984).  \n\nFactors that serve to breach the aforementioned barriers have been identified by researchers, the most significant being the founders? human capital (Aspelund et al., 2005; Gimeno et al., 1997; MacMillan et al., 1985; Tyebjee & Bruno, 1984). Human capital theory was initialy applied to study the impact of education (Becker, 1964; Schultz, 1961) on economic value. Since then, the theory has been increasingly adopted in the field of entrepreneurship, consistently linking human capital attributes to entrepreneurial success (Unger et al., 2011). The literature on human capital distinguishes three kinds of human capital: generic (general) human capital, firm-specific human capital, and task-specific human capital (Gibbons & Waldman, 2004; Hatch & Dyer, 2004).  \n\nWhile we do not directly distinguish between these particular subcategories of human capital in our paper, we do employ signaling theory to propose how traditional human capital signals (like having prior experience as a startup founder, a technical or software engineer, or a business consultant) and networking signals (such as possessing a degree from an elite educational institute, the breadth of an entrepreneurial team and the number of founders, and the entrepreneurial team's years of experience) serve as quality signals to VCs to both mitigate information asymmetry and enhance the likelihood of access to multiple rounds of financing (Spence, 1973; and 1974). Additionally, we analyze a variable called digital signals, which represents the fan following of the startup on multiple social media sites (Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn) (Vismara, 2016). We believe the higher the number of “fan” followings, the more positive the signal of social capital to investors. Even though several empirical studies have analyzed the impact of founders' human capital on firms’ growth and performance, there are very few studies that have explored the impact of human capital on access to VC financing in India. Our theoretical model of the signaling impact of these factors is shown in Fig. 1. We consequently developed our hypotheses on the relationship between the founders? human capital and the startups? access to financing followed by our hypothesis on how social media networking can also affect this process of financing.  \n\n![](images/52592afd990d8c2df30dda207d4890adc8307a4f58638ceb1c241c7f7d3cb39a.jpg)  \nig1: Theoretical model showing the relationship of traditional, networking, and social media signals to attract more rounds of financing  \n\n### 2.1 Traditional Signals: Entrepreneurial Experience  \n\nEntrepreneurship literature (Baron & Ensley, 2006; Corbett, 2005; McGrath & MacMillan, 2000; Parker, 2006; Ronstadt, 1988; Shane, 2000; Wiklund & Shepherd, 2003) has shown that founders gain significant insight from their past work experiences thereby improving entrepreneurial judgment, greater task performance, and forecasting ability (Clement, 1999; Mikhail et al., 1997). This benefit of experience, generally, may be greater in settings of high uncertainty such as business opportunities in new technology or high-tech industries (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994). However, other scholars argue against the benefit of experience for several reasons, including the heterogeneity across tasks that limits the transfer of gained knowledge (Bonner & Lewis, 1990), cognitive biases that inhibit effective learning (Cassar & Craig, 2009; Hogarth, 1991; Kahneman et al., 1982; Sexton et al. 1997), and the lack of sufficient task repetition to achieve learning by doing (Camerer & Lovallo, 1999). Beyond these theoretical debates, there are crucial practical and policy implications that determine whether or not years of experience do actually impact the entrepreneurship process. However, there is limited empirical evidence from research that directly investigates the role of years of experience on the access to financing for the new startups in this digital age. We believe that experienced entrepreneurs are likely to have a greater understanding of the industry and, given the greater uncertainty for high-tech businesses, the benefit from experience can serve as a positive signal to VCs.Consequently, we posit:  \n\nHypothesis 1: Founders with more work experience are likely to access more rounds of VC financing.  \n\n#### 2.1.2 Prior Startup Experience  \n\nStudies have shown that investors look for founders with experience (Hall & Hofer, 1993; Kaplan & Stromberg, 2004; Maidique, 1986). Entrepreneurs who have prior experience creating startups develop strong cognitive skill that help them better assess risk (Bar-Hillel, 1983; Hayward et al., 2006) and which, overall, results in a better evaluation and selection of entrepreneurial opportunities (Baron & Ensley, 2006; Gruber et al., 2008). Prior startup founding experience can serve as a powerful human capital signal (Hsu, 2007) and can increase the likelihood of obtaining VC funding. While founders may have been involved in several previous ventures, the frequency and repetition of startup founding experience will not necessarily always serve as a positive signal to investors. In contrast, Beckman et al. (2007) found prior startup experience had an opposite effect on receiving VC funding. Similarly, Baum & Silverman (2004) found that the yearly pre-IPO amount of VC funding obtained by Canadian biotech startups increases with the managerial competencies of a firm's president, while it is negatively related to his or her entrepreneurial experience. Consequently, we posit:  \n\nHypothesis 2a: The prior startup experience of founders facilitates access to more rounds of VC financing.  \n\n#### 2.1.3. Prior Technical Experience or Industry Experience  \n\nThe founders who have had prior industry experience or possess technical skills related to the industry are aware of the industry norms, rules, and dynamics of every changing environment. Such founders with more technical experience and skills are better able to understand the needs of consumers and know how to serve them better (Delmar & Shane, 2006). Founders′ industry experience is often viewed positively (Brush et al., 2001) and is valued by potential VCs when making investment decisions (MacMillan et al., 1985). Eckhardt et al., (2006) also find similar results, where prior industry-specific experiences positively influence the likelihood of obtaining external financing. This can serve as a positive signal to investors who believe that industrial experience can serve them better. Consequently, we posit:  \n\nHypothesis 2b: The prior technical experience of founders facilitates access to more rounds of financing through VC.  \n\n#### 2.1.4 Prior Business Consultancy Experience  \n\nThe role of an expert consultant has increasingly become significant for firms seeking to be successful. An event study by Bergh & Gibbons (2011) that analyses firms that announced the hiring of consultants finds that the stock market, on average, responded positively and significantly to the announcement. There is, however, not much literature on the impact of prior business consultancy experience on the success of the venture or in obtaining successful VC financing. From our data, business consultancy appeared as the third most significant experience a founder should possess, which thus made us consider that a founder's prior experience as a business consultant serves as a relevant signal to VCs. We believe that business consultants better understand the dynamics of the new industry, as they often consult projects that are short and cyclical in nature. They also have the skills to quickly understand the market requirements and market demands for their products. Additionally, they possess project management skills, are used to working under strict deadlines, and must master communication skills early in their careers, as they must often address the top executives of the companies. All these skills can be effectively used during new venture creation. Business consultants also know how to perform strategic, operational, and financial analyses for their clients. The above justifications lead to the following hypothesis:  \n\nIypothesis 2c: Prior business consultancy experience of founders facilitates access to more rounds of VC financing.  \n\n### 2.2. Networking Signals  \n\nExtant literature defines a social network as a “web of personal connections and relationships for the purpose of securing favors in personal and/or organizational action\" (Adler & Kwon, 2002; Burt, 1997; Granovetter, 1985; Groh & Wallmeroth, 2016). Members of social networks are better able to access and exchange new knowledge, thus facilitating knowledge creation. In firms or organizational settings, social networks may involve relationships among individuals in a formal structure of business connections. For the purposes of our paper, we focus on social networks as an informal structure of personal relations bound by institutional space (Sorenson, 2003). We look to the quality of the network as certified by a degree from an elite educational system which not only legitimizes quality but also enables access to equally successful alumni. The extent of the network is measured by the size of the entrepreneurial team.  \n\n#### 2.2.1.  A Degree From an Elite Educational Institute  \n\nA degree from an elite educational institute is perceived as a quality signal. Engel & Keilbach (2007), using a sample of mostly private Germans firms, found that the education of the founders significantly influences the likelihood of receiving VC. Maidique (1986) established that VCs considered founders with advanced degrees from high-quality institutions to affect their startup success. Conversely, Audretsch & Lehmann (2004), employing a sample of 341 German startups listed in the Neuer Markt, highlighted that the number of members of a firm's top management team with a Ph.D. degree had no impact on access to VC. Thus, the existing literature on this topic is quite inconclusive. Whilst most of the extant knowledge has been derived from and relevant to developed economies, the situation in developing economies still remains an open question. How does networking capital help the entrepreneur raise financing for a startup based in India? In particular, we are interested in knowing whether or not graduating from an elite educational institute increases the likelihood of financing compared to graduating from other non-elite educational institutes. We base our assertion on the fact that degrees from recognized elite institutes serves not only as a credibility signal to VCs in comparison to those who graduate from non-elite institutes but also signals that, throughout the time spent in higher education, a useful network of equally successful elites is established in an informal manner. Following this assertion, we build upon our first hypotheses:  \n\nHypothesis 3: Indian startup founders with degrees from elite educational institutes are likely to atract more rounds of VC financing  \n\n#### 2.2.2. The Entrepreneurial Team (The Number of Founders)  \n\nGartner et al. (1994) made the argument that the entrepreneur in entrepreneurship is typically plural, not singular. Growing literature (Ensley et al., 1998; ; Gartner et al., 1994; Lechler, 2001; Reich, 1987) on this topic has established the fact that the activities involved in establishing and growing a new venture are more often taken by entrepreneurial teams rather than by a solitary entrepreneur. By pooling founder's talents, teams can resolve complex problems (Eisenhardt & Schoonhoven, 1990; Hambrick & D'Aveni, 1992). Entrepreneurial teams are more likely to attract financial resources such as VC and traditional capital through banks (Beckman et al., 2007; Cooper & Daily, 1997). The size of the entrepreneurial team has been reported to have a positive association with venture performance in a variety of settings, as larger teams are likely to have more resources (Colombo & Grilli, 2005; Cooper & Bruno, 1977; Eisenhardt & Schoonhoven, 1990; Feeser & Willard, 1990; Haleblian & Finkelstein, 1993). We believe that a higher number of founders on the entrepreneurial team is beneficial as well in the context of India, where the startup ecosystem is not so friendly for new ventures and involves a lot of bureaucracy and administrative burden. Having a team of co-founders with complementary skill sets not only helps in sharing the burden of work but also enables startup access to the numerous co-founders’ networks. Accordingly, we expect that a higher number of founders should increase the startup's social network capital. Consequently, we posit: Hypothesis 4: Indian startups that have more founders in their entrepreneurial team are likely to atract more rounds of VC financing  \n\n### 2.3 The Strength of Social Networking as a Digital Signal  \n\nPodolny (2005) has proposed that “the greater market participants uncertainty about the underlying quality of a producer and the producer's product, the more that market participants will rely on the producer's status to make inferences about quality.\" Startups can effectively use social media as a crucial medium not only for the exchange of information with clients but also to reduce information scarcity problems that exist between startups and investors. A startup's social media presence and fan following could demonstrate the startup's ability to lure consumers, strengthen its brand, and engage and retain consumers (Vismara, 2016). This, in turn, can serve as a positive signal to VCs and increase the likelihood of securing funding. Taken broadly, existing studies suggest (Goh et al., 2013; Luo et al., 2013) that the use of social media can influence overall firm performance, including the success of early-stage firms and their ability to obtain financing. While these studies mostly use data from established companies, we expect to see a similar logic at work for startup firms. With respect to signaling function, social networking may also serve as legitimization for the startup idea/product or process and, consequently, may facilitate the acquisition of financial capital. Thus, weposit:  \n\nHypothesis 5: Startups that have more followers (fans) on social media (Twitter/Facebook/LinkedIn) are more likely to receive more rounds of VC financing.  \n\n## 3.EMPIRICAL STRATEGY  \n\n### 3.1. Data Collection  \n\ninformation on the region of the startup, the year of launch, and the sector. A detailed analysis of the variables and from where they were collected is provided in the appendix (A1). Data collection ended in July 2018, therefore any data after that date go beyond the scope of our study.  \n\n#### 3.1.1. Dependent Variables  \n\nTo test the independent effects of human capital and social networking on access to financing, we use rounds of financing (FIN_ROUNDS)6 as our dependent variable. Based on the data collected for both active startups and failed startups, we found that only one startup was funded through debt. All of the other startups were funded initially through VC and, later, funded through both VC and private equity. We collected the information on the number of financing rounds starting from seed funding through to the last funding round as of July 2018, for both kinds of firms. We found that while the average round of funding received by successful firms was 3, for failed firms it was only 1. We also collected information on the total amount of financing raised as of July 2018. The average funding amount for the stil-active startups was around $\\mathrm{US}\\$300$ million, whereas for failed firms it was $\\$4$ million. We needed to consider that in the case of failed startups, the details of the amount raised were absent for 20 startups. Being unable to utilize the amount of funding as the dependent variable, we employed rounds of financing. Only VC and private equity funds are included in our data sample and we do not include funds provided by the government or the founders.  \n\n#### 3.1.2. Independent Variables  \n\n#### 3.1.2.1. Founders' Human and Networking Capital  \n\nWe argue that the founders' human capital, particularly their years of prior experience and prior relevant experience—industry-related prior experience, previous founding experience, previous business consultancy experience, an educational degree from elite institutel7, and the presence of an entrepreneurial team, rather than being a solo entrepreneur—sends signals about the quality of the founding members' productivity and effectiveness to VCs. We treat these types of human capital separately.  \n\nWe include an independent variable related to the total years of average experience (YEARS_EXP) of the founder and also included dummy variables related to relevant prior experience. Our descriptive statistics show that out of 214 founders, $36\\%$ of the founders have had prior experience as a founder, $21\\%$ have had prior experience as a software engineer, and $15\\%$ have had prior experience as a business consultant. The other $28\\%$ have had other prior experiences related to accounting, investing, and advocating, or have worked as a scientist or product and marketing manager. Consequently, we believe these skills (prior founder, prior technical, and prior business consultant) are significant for startups and help them to access financing. As such, we created dummy variables related to relevant experience: at least one founder has prior technical experience (ATLEAST_PRIORTECH_EXP), at least one founder has prior founding experience (ATLEAST_PRIORFOUNDER_EXP), and at least one founder has prior business consultant experience (ATLEAST_PRIORCONSULT_EXP) (Gimmon & Levie, 2010; Hsu, 2007). A degree from IT, IM, BITS, and foreign universities that are recognized elite institutes (DEG_ELITE) is a dummy variable that takes a value of 1, and 0 otherwise. Out of the 214 founders in our data sample, nearly $83\\%$ of them attended IIT, IM, BITS PILANI, or an elite foreign university, and the rest attended other educational institutes in India. As such, we believe attendance at one of these institutes should result in better access to financing rounds.  \n\nWe include an entrepreneurial team as depicted by the variable number of founders (NO_OF_FOUNDERS). The presence of an entrepreneurial team has been shown to positively impact venture performance (Colombo & Grilli, 2005; Cooper & Bruno, 1977; Eisenhardt & Schoonhoven, 1990; Feeser & Willard, 1990; Haleblian & Finkelstein, 1993). Our descriptive statistics present only 24 solo entrepreneurs; in this regard, we consider this an important variable that impacts access to financing.  \n\n#### 3.1.2.2. Social Networking  \n\nWe include variable social networking (SOCIAL_NETWORK) to determine the impact of social networking, or digital signals as represented by the number of fan followers, on multiple social media sites with access to financing. The social networking variable takes value from the social media sites of each startup, such as Twitter (the number of followers), LinkedIn (the number of connections), and Facebook (the number of fans). We add them all together to determine the strength of their digital networking. The average number of connections for active startups is around 218,870 and for failed startups is only 72,380. We believe that founders of failed startups were not able to gather strength on their social media profiles, which could have been interpreted as a negative digital signal by the investors. We believe that social media strength plays a very important role for not only creating brand awareness or marketing products but also to gain traction and help access subsequent rounds of financing.  \n\n#### 3.1.3. Control variables  \n\nWe controlled for certain variables that might impact the rounds of financing. First, we controlled for geographic location (Blau, 1977; Sorenson & Stuart, 2001) to account for spatial proximity to VCs (Gompers & Lerner, 1999; Sorenson & Stuart, 2001). Geographical distribution of these startups, according to the data, was as follows: 26 are located in Bangalore, 47 in the Northern Capital Region (NCR), 16 in Mumbai, and the remainder in other cities in India. Consequently, we coded this variable 1 for startups located in premium cities for investments (e.g., Bangalore, NCR, and Mumbai) (Florida & Kenney, 1988; Chatterji et al., 2014) and 0 for ventures located in other areas. We have three dummy variables: City_Bangalore, City_NCR, and City_Mumbai. These cities are of strategic importance, as Bangalore is known as the Silicon Valley of India and home to many technology startups; Mumbai is known as the financial capital and home to many fintechs; and the NCR region is also developing into a home to many new technology startups. Second, we controlled for the age of the startup, as investors may prefer to invest in more established startups that have established market positions (Hsu, 2007; Shane & Stuart, 2002). Finally, we control for industry, by creating dummy variables for industry based on our descriptive statistics. The following dummy variables represent the different sectors of technology startups: consumer internet (CONSUMER_INTERNET), healthtech (HEALTHTECH), edtech (EDTECH), and fintech (FINTECH). Additional control variables related to founder's gender was also included in the regression model, as our descriptive statistics suggest a huge gender bias, where women only represent 8 percent of 214 founders. The detailed descriptive statistics are provided in Table 2. To avoid biased results given different units of measurement applying to variables, all variables were normalized except the dummy controls.  \n\n### 3.2. Methodology  \n\nWe used SPSS statistical software to test the main empirical hypotheses discussed in the previous sections; this section includes two steps. First, we estimated a regression model to predict the number of financing rounds (FIN_ROUNDS) as a function of the various independent variables and control variables discussed earlier. Post hoc multicollinearity diagnostics indicated variance inflation factors (VIFs) well below the threshold of 5 for all the independent variables tested. However, for rigor and robustness, based on the observed correlation matrix, we also ran structural equation modelling (SEM) with explicit covariance paths for all a priori statistically significant correlations (observed and expected) between the independent variables. This ability of SEM to explicitly handle multicollinearity is one of its important advantages compared to traditional ordinary least square (OLS) multiple regression.  \n\nBased on the hypothetical factors that could explain the number of financing rounds of startups in India, our multiple regression model (Model 1) contains all the independent variables of the study to test for the predicted signal. It is as follows:  \n\n(l) FIN_ROUNDS;_ = Po_ +. $\\beta_{I}$ SOCIAL_NETWORK; $^+$ β2AGE; $^+$ β;NO_OF_FOUNDERS; $^+$ β4YEARS_EXP; $^+$ βsDEG_ELITE; + β6ATLEAST_PRIORFOUNDER_EXP; $^+$ β7ATLEAST_PRIORTECH_EXP; $^+$ βsATLEAST_PRIORCONSULT_EXP; + β9GENDER; + β1oCONSUMER_INTERNET; $^+$ βuEDTECH; $^+$ β12HEALTHTECH; $^+$ β13FINTECH; $^+$ β14CITY_NCR; + β1sCITY_BANGALORE;+ β16CITY_MUMBAI; + 8i,  \n\nTo further understand the relative contributions of the various predictors, we also ran 4 more regression models. Model 2 excluded the variable SOCIAL_NETWORK, Model 3 excluded NO_OF_FOUNDERS, Model 4 excluded DEG_ELITE, and Model 5 excluded all control variables to observe whether or not these variables could potentially mask the effects of other variables in the original model.  \n\n#### 3.2.1. Supplementary Analyses for Robustness and Cross- Validation  \n\nWe empirically tackled the theoretical model presented in Fig. 1 using structural equation modelling (SEM) as a robustness test. As mentioned earlier, the advantage of using SEM instead of the combination of aggregate scores from the factor analysis and traditional regression models with multiple inputs is that a) it allows for explicit handling of multicollinearity through covariance paths, unlike multiple regressions, and b)  \n\nmeasurement error is not aggregated in a residual error term. Further the evaluation of the models is based on a diverse set of fit indices including absolute, relative, and comparative fit indices as well as information like the Akaike Information Criterion and the Bayesian Information Criterion. One common rule-of-thumb for implementing SEM is that it should have an a priori minimum threshold of 100 subjects (Williams et al., 2004) and a post hoc Hoelter's N of 75-200; our sample meets these thresholds: 0 $\\mathrm{\\ddot{n}}{=}102$ ; Hoelter's $\\mathrm{N}=139$ $95\\%$ confidence) and 152 ( $99\\%$ confidence). Unstandardized and standardized coefficients estimates are presented in the following Results section in order to allow multiple perspective comparisons with the conventional regression model, as well as to compare relative contributions (effect sizes) of the various independent and control variables.  \n\n## 4. RESULTS  \n\nTable 1 and Table 2 reports the bivariate correlations and descriptive statistics, respectively, for the variables in the analysis. Significant correlations were found between the dependent variable and the explanatory variables “Educational Institute,”’ “Number of Founders,”′ and “Social Network.\" Correlation analysis results indicate weak levels (<.3) of correlations between all independent variables except “Educational Institute\" and “Prior founder experience,”’ where we observe strong significant correlation (0.340). Further, we examined multicollinearity using variance inflation factors (VIF). The general rule of thumb is that VIFs exceeding 10 are a sign of serious multicollinearity. The VIF value for all studied variables is $<3.0$ (maximum value of 2,972), suggesting that multicollinearity is not a major concern (Hair et al., 2010). A strong negative and significant corrlation was found between sector and city control variables. To eliminate possible collinearity problems and more than verify the VIF values, we performed a robustness test using structured equation modelling (SEM).  \n\nTable1: Nonparametric correlations - Kendall's tau_b (1 dependent and 16 independent variables, 2-tailed)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Variables</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>12</td><td>13</td><td>14</td><td>15</td><td>16</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>N Financing rounds</td><td>1.00</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Educational Institute</td><td>.223*</td><td>1.00</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Number of Founders</td><td>.240**</td><td>.187*</td><td>1.00</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Years of Experience</td><td>.126</td><td>-.053</td><td>-.005</td><td>1.00</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Prior tech experience</td><td>.163</td><td>.187</td><td>.270**</td><td>-.067</td><td>1.00</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Prior founder experience</td><td>.139</td><td>.340**</td><td>.232*</td><td>.064</td><td>.117</td><td>1.00</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Prior Consultant</td><td>.074</td><td>.087</td><td>.153</td><td>.012</td><td>.064</td><td>.087</td><td>1.00</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>experience Age</td><td>.121</td><td>.093</td><td>.063</td><td>.187**</td><td>.039</td><td>.159</td><td>.144</td><td>1.00</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Social Network</td><td>.357**</td><td>.013</td><td>.071</td><td>.116</td><td>-.020</td><td>-.074</td><td>.124</td><td>.125</td><td>1.00</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Gender</td><td>.058</td><td>.089</td><td>.012</td><td>-.084</td><td>.144</td><td>.109</td><td>-.030</td><td>.007</td><td>-.101</td><td>1.00</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>City Bangalore</td><td>.079</td><td>.102</td><td>.051</td><td>.056</td><td>.201*</td><td>.148</td><td>.054</td><td>.016</td><td>-.032</td><td>.035</td><td>1.00</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>City NCR</td><td>-.004</td><td>.065</td><td>.040</td><td>.044</td><td>-.061</td><td>-.047</td><td>.031</td><td>.026</td><td>-.047</td><td>.015</td><td>-.541**</td><td>1.00</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>City Mumbai</td><td>-.039</td><td>.093</td><td>.021</td><td>-.024</td><td>-.054</td><td>.042</td><td>-.051</td><td>-.090</td><td>.045</td><td>-.012</td><td>-.252*</td><td>-.399**</td><td>1.00</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Consumer Internet</td><td>.031</td><td>.091</td><td>.026</td><td>.108</td><td>-.056</td><td>-.082</td><td>-.010</td><td>-.081</td><td>.031</td><td>.083</td><td>-.242*</td><td>.214*</td><td>-.077</td><td>1.00</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Fintech</td><td>-.039</td><td>.085</td><td>.107</td><td>.005</td><td>.046</td><td>.204*</td><td>.170</td><td>.141</td><td>.064</td><td>-.037</td><td>.056</td><td>-.080</td><td>.056</td><td>-.372**</td><td>1.00</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>HealthTech</td><td>.006</td><td>-.090</td><td>-.176</td><td>.076</td><td>-.074</td><td>-.118</td><td>-.193</td><td>.119</td><td>.060</td><td>-.056</td><td>.080</td><td>-.123</td><td>-.026</td><td>-.349**</td><td>-.091</td><td>1.00</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Ed tech</td><td>-.033</td><td>.038</td><td>.053</td><td>-.013</td><td>.031</td><td>.222*</td><td>-.095</td><td>.059</td><td>.060</td><td>-.078</td><td>.019</td><td>-.095</td><td>.203*</td><td>-.324**</td><td>-.084</td><td>-.079</td><td>1.00</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nDue to the binary nature of some variables, these correlations should be interpreted with care.

Table 3 displays the unstandardized coefficients (beta and standard error), the standardized beta and sig., the number of observations,the $\\mathrm{F}$ and sig., and the $\\mathbf{R}^{2}$ and adjusted $\\mathbf{R}^{2}$ for each model.  \n\nThese analyses (ANOVA) resulted in 4 statistically significant models (Models 1, 3, 4, and 5). Model 1 is the model that includes all variables $[\\mathrm{F}(16,85)=2,728$ $\\mathrm{p}<0.002$ $\\mathrm{R}^{2}=0.339\\$ 1. The independent variables SOCIAL_NETWORK ( $\\upbeta=0.469$ $\\mathbf{t}=4.907$ $\\mathrm{p}<0.001\\$ 0, NO_OF_FOUNDERS $(\\beta=0.280;\\mathrm{~t}=2.821;\\mathrm{~p}<$ 0.006), and DEG_ELITE $(\\upbeta=0.216$ .， $\\mathrm{t}=2.086$ $\\mathrm{~p~}<0.040)$ predicted the FIN_ROUNDS. This model allowed us to test our hypotheses (H1-H5). We used the other models to ensure that significant independent variables were not masking the effect of other ones.  \n\nWe find that the educational institute, the number of founders, and the social network has a positive significant effect for all significant models. Given the fact that the coefficient for the social network was highly significant for all models, we ran additional models excluding this variable to test the robustness of Model 1. This analysis suggested a drop of the explanatory power of all models, as indicated by ${\\mathsf{R}}^{2}$ ; however, three models still remained significant $(\\mathrm{Prob}>\\mathrm{F};<0.05)$ and did not impact our final conclusion in any manner. However, Model 2, the model without the “SOCIAL_NETWORK\" variable is not significant, and the adjusted R2 is almost irrelevant (O.004). This suggests that this variable \"SOCIAL_NETWORK\" is an important predictor of access to VC financing for Indian startups. Our results support other studies that find the use of social media can influence overall firm performance, including the success of early-stage firms and their ability to obtain financing (Goh et al., 2013; Luo et al., 2013). Furthermore, it was found that the number of founders “NO_OF_FOUNDERS\" tends to have significantly higher levels of influence in the number of finance rounds. This result also supports previous research that finds larger teams are likely to have access to more resources (Colombo & Grilli, 2005; Cooper & Bruno, 1977; Eisenhardt & Schoonhoven, 1990; Feeser & Willard, 1990; Haleblian & Finkelstein, 1993).  \n\nTable 3: Regression analysis results (Models 1- 5)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Variables</td><td colspan=\"2\">Model 1</td><td

This is contrary to prior research that finds founders’ industry experience to be valued (Brush et al., 2001), especially by VCs in making investment decisions (MacMillan et al., 1985). We believe for investors in developing economies where institutions are arguably weaker, informal quality signals may be much more important to mitigate information asymmetry. It is therefore possible that investors in new technology startups in India may place more value on networking and digital signals than traditional human capital signals.  \n\n### 4.1 Results on Hypothesized Effects  \n\nHere, we summarize the hypotheses test results, reported in Table 3. We used Model 1 to discuss our findings for the hypothesized main effects. All our hypotheses are directional. Our first 6 hypotheses are related to human capital and networks, and the last one to the strength of social or digital networking. H1 - not supported. Experienced founders are likely to access more rounds of VC financing. The number of years of experience a founder has is not significant in the access to financial capital through VCs. H2a - not supported. Founders who have prior startup experience are likely to access more rounds of VC financing. Prior startup experience of a founder is not significant in the access to financial capital through VCs.   \nH2b - not supported. Technically experienced founders are likely to access more rounds of VC financing. Prior technical experience of a founder is not significant in the access to financial capital through VCs. H2c - not supported. Founders with prior business consultancy experience are likely to access more rounds of VC financing. Prior business consultancy of a founder is not significant in the access to financial capital through VCs.   \nH3 - supported. Indian startups founders who obtain a degree from an elite educational institute are likely to attract more rounds of financing $(\\mathrm{Beta}=0.574,\\mathrm{p}<0.01)$ . We find that the educational institute has a significant positive impact on the number of financing rounds.   \nH4 - supported. Indian startups that have more founders in their entrepreneurial team are likely to attract more rounds of financing $(\\mathrm{Beta}=0.332,\\mathrm{p}<0.01)$ . In line with previous research, we find that the number of founders has a significant positive impact on the number of financing rounds for Indian startups. This last hypothesis is related to social media networking.   \nH5 - supported. Startups that have more followers (fans) on social media (Twitter/Facebook/LinkedIn) are more likely to receive more rounds of financing from investors $\\mathbf{\\mathrm{Beta}}=0.000$ $\\mathrm{~p~}<0.001,$ 0. In accordance with previous studies, the social network has a significant positive impact on the number of financing rounds.  \n\n### 4.2 Robustness test  \n\nWe show in Figure 1 the general study model, including the major constructs of “human capital\" and “social capital’ together with the control variables. In our structured equation model, we present all variables that directly relate to the number of financing rounds. In general, we are able to verifiy that the relationship between the variables educational institute “DEG_ELITE,” the number of founders “NO_OF_FOUNDERS,” and social capital “SOCIAL_NETWORK\" with financing rounds \"FIN_ROUNDS\" is significant (see Table 4). The high levels of association indicate that these three variables influence the number of financing rounds. The SEM results presented a $\\mathrm{Chi^{2}}(95)=86.543$ .a practical significance $=0.720$ $\\mathrm{R}^{2}=0.360$  \n\nTable 4: Regression Weights: Unstandardized, Standardized, and Significance Levels for Models in Figure 1 (Standard Errors in Parentheses; $\\mathbf{n}=\\mathbf{10}\\mathbf{2}.$   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">Unst. β</td><td>St. β</td><td>Sig.</td></tr><tr><td>Fin_Rounds <--</td><td>Social_Network</td><td>0.000***</td><td>(0.000)</td><td>0.461</td><td>0.000***</td></tr><tr><td>Fin_Rounds --></td><td>No_of_Founders</td><td>0.332**</td><td>(0.106)</td><td>0.272</td><td>0.002</td></tr><tr><td>Fin_Rounds <--</td><td>City_Bangalore</td><td>-0.491</td><td>(0.383)</td><td>-0.166</td><td>0.200</td></tr><tr><td>Fin_Rounds <--</td><td>City_NCR</td><td>-0.386</td><td>(0.339)</td><td>-0.149</td><td>0.255</td></tr><tr><td>Fin_Rounds <--</td><td>City_Mumbai</td><td>-0.475</td><td>(0.412)</td><td>-0.133</td><td>0.248</td></tr><tr><td>Fin_Rounds <--</td><td>Age</td><td>-0.021</td><td>(0.047)</td><td>-0.037</td><td>0.654</td></tr><tr><td>Fin_Rounds <--</td><td>Gender</td><td>0.399</td><td>(0.270)</td><td>0.118</td><td>0.139</td></tr><tr><td>Fin_Rounds <--</td><td>EdTech</td><td>-0.141</td><td>(0.481)</td><td>-0.027</td><td>0.770</td></tr><tr><td>Fin_Rounds --></td><td>HealthTech</td><td>-0.075</td><td>(0.439)</td><td>-0.016</td><td>0.864</td></tr><tr><td>Fin_Rounds --></td><td>Consumer_Internet</td><td>-0.111</td><td>(0.289)</td><td>-0.042</td><td>0.701</td></tr><tr><td>Fin_Rounds <--</td><td>FinTech</td><td>-0.317</td><td>(0.434)</td><td>-0.069</td><td>0.465</td></tr><tr><td>Fin_Rounds --></td><td>Years_Exp</td><td>0.008</td><td>(0.018)</td><td>0.038</td><td>0.643</td></tr><tr><td>Fin_Rounds --></td><td>Deg_Elite</td><td>0.574*</td><td>(0.241)</td><td>0.209</td><td>0.017</td></tr><tr><td>Fin_Rounds <--</td><td>Atleast_PriorFounder_Exp</td><td>0.186</td><td>(0.230)</td><td>0.071</td><td>0.418</td></tr><tr><td>Fin_Rounds <--</td><td>Atleast_PriorTech_Exp</td><td>-0.029</td><td>(0.223)</td><td>-0.011</td><td>0.897</td></tr><tr><td>Fin_Rounds <--</td><td>Atleast_PriorConsult_Exp</td><td>-0.210</td><td>(0.228)</td><td>-0.075</td><td>0.357</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: $\\chi^{2}\\:(95)=86.543$ $\\mathrm{CFI}>0.95$ ; RMSEA $<0.05$ .， $\\iint\\mathbf{\\nabla}\\mathbf{\\cdot}\\mathbf{\\nabla}\\times\\mathbf{\\nabla}\\mathbf{\\cdot}\\mathbf{p}<.001$ ；\\*\\* $\\mathsf{p}\\mathsf{<}.01$ ;\\* $\\mathsf{p}\\mathsf{<}.05$ $+\\mathrm{p}<.10$ Unst. $\\upbeta-$ Unstandardized Beta; St. $\\upbeta-$ Standardized Beta; Sig. - p-value  \n\n## 5. CONCLUSION AND LIMITATION OF RESEARCH  \n\nVCs confronted with information asymmetry are likely to look for certain signals to reduce informational gaps in the exercise of their judgement. This leads to the question, if information asymmetry is potentially heightened due to the continuously evolving nature of digital startups or the higher institutional burdens in certain countries, how would this affect the signals? We believe our research contributes to extant literature as we link signaling theory to traditional human capital, networking, and social media networking in the context of the acquisition of VC funding by technology startups in a developing country with higher institutional burdens (Podolny, 1993, and 1994, and 2005; Spence, 1974). We build five main hypotheses (H1-H5). Our findings contain a series of larger implications for entrepreneurs, investors, and policy makers. To begin, our results suggest that traditional human capital factors may not necessarily serve as quality signals for technology startups in India, and other measures of entrepreneurial quality, such as quality of networks (networking signals) and social media networking (digital signals) may serve as better quality signals to access financing. The empirical analysis highlights the following main results. The first two main results are related to the role of traditional human capital in the funding of startups, in particular the work experience of the founder. Our empirical results suggest that years of experience do not impact the access of financing of a startup and neither do prior relevant experiences (as a founder, as a software engineer, or as a business consultant). A degree from an elite educational institute and the breadth of the entrepreneurial team are positively associated with the likelihood of access to financing. The third main result is related to the strength of social media networking on the studied startups. This result makes an important contribution to the signaling literature (as most of the current literature focuses on the developed nations of the US and Europe), especially from the perspective of emerging economies, since our study provides support for the changing importance of signals over time in the context of acquisition of VC financing and in the virtual world, where the impact of social media cannot be excluded. Indeed, out of all the digital signals, social media networking has the strongest impact on access to funding.  \n\nWhen interpreting the results of our study, certain limitations need to be kept in mind. First, we have tested the impact of traditional human capital factors, networking, and social media networking on access to the financing of startups. However, in the actual decision-making process, certain other factors related to revenue growth rates or estimated market size or information about patents may play a role as well. Information for failed startups is absent. Second, our study is focused on India, and similar research on other emerging countries should be considered on topic. Third, we investigate the relationship between signal and financial resource acquisition and adopt a static approach (Elitzur & Gavious, 2003; Higgins & Gulati, 2006). While our study provides important insights, finance acquisition is not a static process but rather a continuous process where different signals can play a different role at different stages. Some signals will be relevant for some stages but become irrelevant in subsequent stages. Thus, it would be interesting to develop a model that tests how different signals help the startup to acquire resources during different stages. Fourth, the study is mainly quantitative and lacks a qualitative view from investors as to what makes a strong signal during the financing rounds. Thus, we encourage future research that can consider integrating both qualitative and quantitative variables so that more understanding can be propounded into the contingencies that enhance the financing of startups. Fifth, the validity and authenticity of the data are limited to what we have collected from multiple databases such as Traxn, Crunchbase, Techinasia, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook. Even though we have sought to verify the information collected, there may still be a chance of some discrepancies, which cannot be avoided. Lastly, even though we establish causality relationships through our study, our work was done to support a set of postulated hypotheses; it may not imply or establish a causal relationship.  \n\n## REFERENCES  \n\nAcs, Z.

    "reference_markdown": "EDGAR NORTON and BERNARD H. TENENBAUM FairleighDickinsonUniversity  \n\nMuchimportantworkhasinformedusofratesofreturnearnedbyventure capitalists, the importance of venture capitalists to the ‘going public\" process,and the criteriaventure capitalists useto evaluate deals.This paper seeks to add to the literature by testing hypotheses,based upon both the finance and strategic management literature, regarding certain venturecapitalistinvestmentpractices.  \n\nVenture capitalists seek to control or manage risk (Driscoll 1974; MacMillan, Siegel, and SubbaNarasimha 1985).Financing structure and investment strategy provide several means for venture capitalists to do this.Tools available to the venture capitalist include portfolio diversification to spread risk across different industries,firms,or hotlcold IPO markets to minimize unsystematic or investment-specific risk. Information sharing,networking,and specialization can also be used to control unsystematicrisk.  \n\nSeveral hypotheses are developed from these conflicting perspectives. Data used to test the hypotheses are derived from responses to a survey of venture capitalists. Three hundred surveys were mailed toventurecapitalists;98,or $32.7\\%$ returnedusableresponses.  \n\nPorifolio diversification is a well-known means to conirol risk exposure by reducing unsystematic or specific risks. However, Bygrave (1987, 1988), as well as financial intermediation theorists, argues that maintaining a high degree of specialization is useful for controlling risk as well as for gaining access to networks, information,and deal flow from other venture investors.The analyses of this paper build upon Bygrave's work. We construct more rigorous tests to resolve the conflict between the diversification and information-sharing hypotheses. Our hypothesis tests were usually resolved in favor of the information-sharing view.For example, venture capitalists in the sample that were heavily involved in seed round financing were diversified across fewer numbers of firms and industries.  \n\nFurther evidence in favor of information sharing is seen in investment patterns across different financing stages.Diversification would imply maintaining a portfolio of investments across the diffrent investment stages.The information sharing/specialization view would argue that it is best to stay focused on a single stage or several ‘connected'’ stages.The empirical evidence from the sample once again favors thespecializationperspective.  \n\nThis research provides information of use to venture capitalists, as they seek information on how best to control risk; to entrepreneurs, as they learn of the factors venture capitalists consider in determining their investment strategy; and to academicians,as such studies provide insight to general industry practice and thus help to form the basis of classroom discussion and future research endeavors.  \n\n# INTRODUCTION  \n\nAs reported in Sahlman (1990), over one-third of investments by venture capitalists resulted in total absolute losses during the 1969-1985 time frame. About one of 15 investments results in returns that are ten or more times the venture capitalist's investment; the value of these few winners comprise about $49.4\\%$ of the ending value of the investor's portfolio and $61.4\\%$ of the investor's profits. The average holding period for a venture capital investment is 4.9 years, with about one-third of the investments held longer than six years. These statistics confirm that a successful outcome of a venture capital investment is highly uncertain and develops over a long time horizon. Ruhnka and Young (1991) have found that both the amount of risk and its composition varies across the stages of financing. In early stage financings, total risk is high and its major component compriscs factors that are internal to the firm (e.g., team competence, technology development). In later stage financings, total risk declines and the major risk components are risk factors that are external to the firm (e.g, market response, competition, economic downturns).  \n\nThis paper proposes and tests several hypotheses that deal with portfolio strategy as a means for venture capitalists to manage risk. The empirical results indicate that venture capitalists apparently use specialization and information-sharing strategies to control risk rather than financial diversification.  \n\nThe following section reviews some means of risk control available to venture capitalists. Section 2 develops hypotheses regarding portfolio risk control. Section 3 describes the survey instrument used in the study. Section 4 reports the results of statistical tests. Concluding comments follow at the end of the paper.  \n\n## 1. RISK CONTROL  \n\nPrevious studies have found that venture capitalists seek to manage and control risk (Driscoll 1974; MacMillan, Siegel, and SubbaNarasimha 1985). The screening process-in which only $1-3\\%$ of proposals receive funding-—is certainly one potential means of controlling risk. Other means to control risk exist on both the “micro' or individual investment level and on the “macro\" or portfolio level.  \n\n### Micro Risk  \n\nSahlman (1990) discusses that deal structure and active involvement by the venture capitalist in the portfolio firm are several “micro\"’ methods of controlling risk. For example, rather than giving the entrepreneur a large lump sum of cash up front, most venture capital investments involve staged commitments of capital over time. Staging commitments allows the venture capitalist to maintain the valuable options to abandon, re-value, or expand their investment in the firm. Injecting small increments of capital into the portfolio firm also helps to discipline the entrepreneurial team and keep them focused on developing a marketable product.  \n\nMany other deal structure provisions can seek to control “micro' elements of risk. The entrepreneurial team's compensation contract can be structured so that cash salary is low but awards of stock options are high. Venture capitalists may be able to fire team members and repurchase their stock at less than market value. Venture capitalists may sit on the boards of their portfolio firms and be actively involved in the firm's strategy setting and operations (Sahlman 1990; MacMillan, Kulow, and Khoylian 1989; Timmons 1987). Rachet provisions, use of investment vehicles that are senior to the entrepreneur's equity, put options, and redemption options are other means by which the venture capitalist can financially structure an investment in an attempt to control “micro\" risk.  \n\nUnfortunately, research into various deal-specific risk control factors presents many problems, not the least of which is access to data. Due to their proprietary nature, contracts and term sheets between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs are not available for review. Information concerming general deal structure influences can be accessed through survey instruments (Norton and Tenenbaum 1992a, 1992b) but no “hard’’ data bases exist to provide this information to researchers. Additionally, whereas bond covenant provisions have language that has become fairly well standardized (Malitz 1986), this is probably not the case in the more fragmented and private venture capital industry. Thus an empirical study of deal structures that have developed to control “micro\" risk is hindered by a lack of data availability and the potential complexity of the terms.  \n\n### Macro Risk  \n\n\"Macro\"' or portfolio level risk can also be controlled by the venture capitalist. Both financial theory and strategic management theory have developed perspectivcs for risk control in portfolios. Mainline finance theory argues that portfolios should contain a diversified collection of assets to minimize the effects of unsystematic or asset-specific risk (see, e.g., Sharpe 1964). However, strategic management theorists, as well as finance researchers who study financial intermediation, contend that portfolio specialization rather than diversification can be used to control portfolio risk (Bygrave 1987; Chan 1983; Campbell and Kracaw 1980). As with deal structure data availability, it is true that information on venture capitalist portfolio practices is not publicly available. However, a survey instrument can request basic information regarding the characteristics of venture capitalists’ portfolios. Statistical tests of survey responses can then determine if the sample data support the portfolio diversification or portfolio specialization theories of “macro\"risk control.  \n\n## 2. DEVELOPING HYPOTHESES  \n\n### Portfolio Diversification  \n\nTotal risk (the variability in asset returns) has two components: systematic or market risk and unsystematic risk. Systematic risk arises from the effects of market or economy-wide influences on the returns to each asset. Unsystematic risk arises from firm, industry, or other asset-specific effects. By constructing a well-diversified portfolio, all unsystematic risk can be diversified away, leaving an investor exposed only to systematic risk influences. With a diversified portfolio, unfortunate circumstances that hurt returns on some assets are balanced by situations that increase returns on other assets.  \n\nUnder the premises of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), the financial markets reward only systematic risk with higher expected levels of return; exposure to unsystematic risk is not rewarded (Sharpe 1964). The arbitrage pricing theory (Ross 1976) has attracted a great deal of attention and empirical testing in the finance literature as a potential successor to the CAPM. It is a more general theory than the CAPM, but it still assumes that investors are fully diversified and subject only to systematic risk influences. Thus, finance theory generally assumes diversified investors. The only risk of interest is systematic or market risk; all firm or industry specific risk should be diversified away.  \n\nVenture capitalists are subject, a priori, to a great amount of unsystematic risk in each of their portfolio firms. Venture capitalists may want to diversify across different industries and companies in order to reduce their risk exposure in any one industry or product. Early stage investments carry great amounts of risk (Plummer 1987; Ruhnka and Young 1991). The desire to diversify may be especially strong for investors with large relative commitments to seed and first stage investments.1 If venture capitalists seek to control unsystematic risk by way of portfolio diversification, the following hypothesis should be true:  \n\n$\\mathbf{H}_{1}$ :Venture capitalists that make early stage investments will be more diversified to compensate for their risky individual investments. Thus, investors with greater relative commitments to early stage investments (i.e., seed or first stage) should be invested in relatively more industries and companies than those venture capitalists with lesser commitments to early financing stages.  \n\nAnother source of asset-specific risk is liquidity risk. Ultimately venture capitalists wish to exit their investments and return either cash or liquid securities to their investment partners. Liquidity risk exists when the venture capitalist has difficulty exiting from an investment and receiving fair market value in return for the investment stake.  \n\nIn the context of venture capital, there are two aspects to liquidity risk. The first aspect is deal-specific, i.e., the difficulty in exiting from an investment that is either failing or among the “living dead.\" This aspect of liquidity risk depends upon a great many factors, both internal and external to the entrepreneurial team. It can best be controlled, according to portfolio diversification theory, by constructing a well-diversified portfolio to reduce the effect of unsystematic risk on overall portfolio return.  \n\nThe second aspect of liquidity risk deals with the timing of an exit from a successful investment. A venture capitalist would much rather seek to exit when the public equity and the acquisition/merger markets are placing fair values on portfolio firms. Returns to the venture capital investor may be lower if cashout occurs in markets that are “cold,\" or potentially less liquid. Thus, the portfolio diversification perspective implies that venture capitalists should not only seek to diversify across firms and industries but also across different financing stages. By staggering deals across different financing stages, some investments will be ready for cashout in “cold' initial public offering markets, some in \"hot.' The key is that the venture capitalist will be diversified in terms of cashout and be less likely to liquidate positions in substantial numbers of portfolio firms during cold exit markets. Thus, we have a second portfolio diversification hypothesis:  \n\n$\\mathbf{H}_{2}\\mathbf{:}$ Concerns about their inability to time “cold\" and “hot' IPO markets will lead venture capital firms to diversify across different financing stages.  \n\n### Specialization and Information Sharing  \n\nThe CAPM includes such assumptions as homogenous investor expectations, no transactions costs, and equal access to information. These premises will not be true in the risk capital market. Thus the analysis of venture capitalists may be similar to those, such as financial intermediaries, that have information or transactions cost advantages over other investors; e.g., Leland and Pyle (1977), Campbell and Kracaw (1980), Chan (1983), and Bygrave (1987, 1988). Sahlman (1990) argues that valuable learning curve effects arise from the venture capitalist's specialized activity. The venture capitalist benefits from gaining institutional knowledge, sharing it with other investors and gatekeepers, earning a reputation for their experience and expertise, and is then able to “cultivate a deal flow based on networks of contacts and relationships\" (Sahlman 1990, p. 500).  \n\nFinancial theory has also developed models for specialized or concentrated investment activity. Levy (1978, 1991) and Merton (1987) construct models, called Generalized Capital Asset Pricing Models (GCAPM), which assume that segmented capital markets arise due to fixed costs of gaining information. As the reason for the segments disappear (i.e., as the fixed costs approach zero), the GCAPM equilibrium becomes identical to the CAPM as a special case. Levy (1978) argues that one source of fixed costs is the cost of discovering and interpreting the effects of events and information on specific firms in the investor's portfolio (e.g., reading and analyzing quarterly financial statements, keeping current on news and trends). In Levy's (1978) model, the existence of fixed costs limit the number of securities that appear in an investor's portfolio. Thus, complete diversification may not occur. Merton (1987) assumes investors possess specialized information that they then use to purchase stocks in specific areas. For example, a computer programmer should focus his/her investment activity in computer hardware and software firms; a physician will mainly invest in pharmaceutical and health-care firms. Under Merton's model, it is costly for investors to acquire information about companies that do business in areas unrelated to the investor's specialized expertise. Thus, the investor will invest only in those stocks about which they are already well-informed.  \n\nThe assumption of complete diversification is not appropriate according to models that assume that some investors have cost advantages over others. From this perspective, venture capital firms will use their expertise to specialize in certain technical and product areas. Due to their information advantage in certain technologies or markets, and the high fixed costs of gaining expertise in other technical and product areas,it does not make economic sense for venture capitalists to seek portfolio diversification.  \n\nThe knowledge base of venture capitalists include technological, market, and product expertise, as well as networks comprising experts and investors with similar interests. Venture capitalists seek to manage operating and technical risks by gaining access, by means of their reputation in their specialization, to information flows and deal flows in networks. According to Bygrave (1987, 1988), venture capitalists will invite other venture capitalists to participate in deals where their specialized knowledge is such that it will likely add value to the investment. We posit that venture capitalists that invest in firms involving the greatest amounts of technical and product risk (presumably early stage financing deals) should be more specialized, should have a more narrow industry focus, and may be less diversified than those who finance later stage deals.  \n\nThus, if information sharing and specialization are a means to control risk, we have the following hypothesis to counter $\\mathbf{H}_{1}$  \n\n$\\mathbf{H}_{3}\\mathbf{:}$ Investors in early stage deals will have a narrow focus or industry specialization. Thus, the number of different industries and companies in which the venture capitalist is invested should be inversely related to the relative amount of seed and first stage investing done by theventurecapitalist.  \n\nDiversification among the various financing stages will also be less important if specialization and networking theory is a better reflection of venture capitalist risk control practice. Venture capitalists will mainly invest in deals of a specific financing stage. Over time, the investor's financing stage profile may change somewhat as follow-on investments occur; but he/she will still seek to specialize in certain financing stages. Thus, the portfolio specialization and networking perspective leads to the following hypothesis to counter $\\mathbf{H}_{2}$  \n\n$\\mathbf{H}_{4}.$ The venture capitalist's strategy to specialize in order to enhance their position in networks and information flows will lead them to concentrate in one financing stage or several financing stages which may be related by virtue of subsequent follow-on investments.  \n\n### Related Work  \n\nBygrave (1987, 1988) reports on theoretical and empirical work related to the topic of this paper. Bygrave applies Pfeffer and Salancik's (1978) resource exchange model to the venture capital industry. The model predicts that the amount of networking or co-investing among venture capitalists should rise as uncertainty rises. In an analysis of the top 61 venture capital firms, Bygrave (1987) finds that the amount of co-investing is significantly greater among venture capitalists investing in high-tech firms than those investing in low-tech firms. He also discovers that the average investment per firm is significantly less for high-tech investments than for low-tech investments. Bygrave's results show that the amount of co-investing is not related to the size of the venture capitalist; small and large high-tech investors do similar amounts of co-investing, as do small and large low-tech investors. These results lead Bygrave (1987)to conclude:  \n\nThus the principal reason for co-investing was not spreading of financial risk. Rather it was the sharing of expertise (p. 151).  \n\nBygrave's test of the conflicting financial diversification and information sharing hypotheses is somewhat weak. For example, the fact that investors in high-tech firms did more co-investing and invested fewer dollars per portfolio firm than investors in low-tech firms is consistent with both the portfolio diversification and the information sharing viewpoints. The fact that the amount of co-investing was not related to the size of the venture capitalist does not disprove financial risk spreading among venture capitalists. Both large and small venture capitalists may have similar co-investing patterns if they have similar exposures to financial ortechnical risk.  \n\nThe analysis to be done in this paper builds upon Bygrave's work. We seek to construct more rigorous tests to resolve the conflict between the diversification and information sharing hypotheses.  \n\n## 3. SURVEY STUDY  \n\nSurveys were mailed in February/March 1990 to 300 members of the National Venture Capital Association; a second mailing to non-respondents occurred in May/June 1990. A total of 98 responses were received for a response rate of $32.7\\%$ . By comparing mean responses from the first and second mailings, the results suggest that response bias does not exist in the sample. Previous versions of the survey were pretested among eight venture capitalists. Their comments and suggestions were incorporated into the final survey format. No one who was part of the pre-test was included in the mailings. The cover letter promised the responses would be held in confidence. Data from the respondents is contained in Table 1.  \n\nThe typical responding venture capital firm is a private limited partnership (item I).2 In our sample, $75.5\\%$ of the respondents are limited partnerships; from data presented in Sahlman (1990),about $78-80\\%$ of the U.s. venture capital firms are organized as limited partnerships. Most of the respondents are larger funds, with over $\\$50$ million of total funds managed (item IV). This is also in close agreement with Sahlman's (1990) industry statistics; he reports the average (median) capital size of an independent, private sector venture capitalist is $\\$65$ million $\\$30$ million) in 1988. The portfolios of firms in our sample are fairly diversified; over half of the respondents’ porfolios have investments in seven or more industries and nearly half have stakes in over 30 companies (items I and IH1).  \n\nThe individual numerical responses on the percentage of financing done at each financing stage (item V) are summarized in the four columns presented in Table 1. The financing stages listed in item $\\mathbf{V}$ are commonly used in the venture capital literature and are in standard use by practitioners (Sahlman 1990). The reported means are based upon the actual numerical responses given by the firms responding to the survey. Our sample appears to be more actively involved in seed stage investing than the industry averages reported in Sahlman (1990, table 1C). According to Sahlman's data, about $12.5\\%$ of venture capital funds are invested in seed stage investments, $67.5\\%$ in expansion stages, and $20.0\\%$ in leveraged buyouts. Our sample has about $24\\%$ of capital invested in seed stage deals, about $59\\%$ in expansion stage deals, and $17\\%$ in LBOs.  \n\nComparing the size and composition of the venture capital firms in our sample to industry data reported in Sahlman (1990), the firms in our sample appear to be representative of firms in the industry. An exception is that the sample firms have relatively more capital invested in seed stage deals than the industry average. This should not make our sample invalid, as the focus of our analysis is on portfolio risk control. The greater relative amount of high-risk early stage investors in our sample may result in stronger tests of our hypotheses.3  \n\n## 4. HYPOTHESIS TESTING  \n\nTable 2, Panel A, reports correlation coefficients between the percentage of funds invested in early financing stages and diversification measures. Firms more actively involved in seed financing are diversified across a smaller number of industries and firms. This provides evidence against $\\mathbf{H}_{1}$ (financial risk diversification) and provides evidence in favor of $\\mathbf{H}_{3}$ (information sharing).  \n\nContradictory findings occur when first round investments is examined. The number of industries in the portfolio is negatively related to the percentage of first round financing but the correlation coefficient is not significantly different from zero. The number of portfolio firms is positively and significantly related, at the $10\\%$ level, to the amount of first round financing. This provides weak evidence for $\\mathsf{H}_{1}$ , the financial risk diversification hypothesis.  \n\nTABLE 1  Aggregate Information Collected from Survey Items I through V   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Frequency</td></tr><tr><td>1.Type ofventure capital firm:</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>i. public</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>private</td><td>89</td></tr><tr><td>missing</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>ii.a.limited partnership</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>b.SBIC/MESBIC</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>c. corporate subsidiary d. other</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>(some respondents checked more than one category)</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>I1.

Correlations are based upon actual numerical responses givenin the survey.Probability values from a one-uiled test are in purentheses.  \n\nEvidence of related investment patterns would indicate support for $\\mathbf{H}_{4}$ (information sharing). If venture capitalists specialize, the percentage of financing in a given stage may be positively related to those of nearby stages as a result of follow-on investments. In addition, a negative relationship should exist between financing stages that are not consecutive. For example, whereas seed and first round investing may be positively correlated as a result of follow-on investments, seed and third stage financing should be negatively related.  \n\nThe latter is what appears in Table 3. For the most part, positive correlations exist between successive financing stages (as seen on the diagonal).5 This implies some degree of follow-on investment activity occurs in the firms’ portfolios. Off-diagonal correlations, which represent non-connected financing stages, are mostly negative and statistically significant. The evidence from Table 3 supports the specialization hypothesis, $\\mathbf{H}_{4}$ .No support of the portfoliodiversification hypothesis, $\\mathbf{H}_{2},$ isindicated.  \n\n## 5. CONCLUSIONS  \n\nThis paper reviews responses to a survey completed by 98 venture capitalists. The paper seeks to determine if venture capitalists attempt to control risk through competing porfolio strategies. We examine various sources of risk and how strategies to manage risk can affect portfolio construction.  \n\nPortfolio diversification is a method to reduce risk exposure by financial means. Venture capitalist portfolios can reduce unsystematic risk by investing in a diversified set of firms or industries. The porfolios can also be diversified against the risk of liquidation during cold IPO markets by containing investments in different stage deals.  \n\nBygrave's (1987, 1988) work on the role of networks, specialization, and information sharing argues otherwise. To control risk, venture capitalists should seek to specialize in order to exploit their technical and product expertise. The specialization hypothesis implies venture capitalists will have portfolios that are less diversified across companies, industries, and financingstages.  \n\nThe survey data allow for several statistical tests of conflicting hypotheses from the diversification and networking perspectives. Most of the conflicts were resolved in favor of the specialization and information sharing theory. Evidence favoring the specialization hypothesis includes the finding that investors in seed deals are less diversified across different industries and firms. Another finding is that venture capitalists appear to specialize in certain financing stages rather than stagger their investments over different financing stages.  \n\nThis paper reports fairly robust empirical evidence in favor of the perspective that venture capitalists control portfolio risk through their efforts to specialize, to build reputation capital, and to become important members of information and deal flow networks.  \n\nAdditional work is needed to better understand the theory and process of venture capitalist risk control. This paper has examined risk management from the “macro,' or overall portfolio perspective. Research is also needed on risk management at the “micro,\"' or individual investment, level, although such studies are hindered by lack of access to data. It is also of interest to examine the interrelationship, if any, between risk management at the macro and micro levels. Also, why aren't venture capitalist “'supermarkets\"’ more prevalent? Venture capitalist supermarkets can allow the best of both worlds—an overall portfolio diversified in terms of time and industry, with experts overseeing sub-portfolios that are specialized in terms of industries and financing stage.  \n\n# REFERENCES  \n\nBygrave, W.

Using a sample of 646 U.S. new ventures that executed IPOs between 1995 and 2010, we find that ventures with foreign or corporate venture capital have higher levels of international intensity. We also investigate the moderating role of VC reputation on the relationship between foreign venture capital and international intensity and corporate venture capital and international intensity. Our results suggest that VC reputation weakens the positive relationship between corporate VC and international intensity.  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nThe resource stock of venture capital (VC) providers plays an important role in the development of new ventures and, as more young companies seek to expand outside their home markets, the internationalization of these companies (Fernhaber & McDougall-Covin, 2009; Fernhaber, McDougall-Covin, & Shepherd, 2009; Reuber & Fischer, 1997). In addition to providing equity-based financial capital, venture capitalists (VCs) share their knowledge relating to international expansion strategies, thereby facilitating the new ventures’ internationalization (Makela & Maula, 2005). While previous work has shown that knowledge plays a critical role in the internationalization of new ventures (Autio, Sapienza, & Almeida, 2000), studies also point out that the investors have different knowledge bases (Maula, Autio,& Murray, 2005). However, most studies that have investigated the role of VCs in new venture internationalization do not differentiate among the resources provided by different types of VCs, thereby ignoring the capital source that influences recipient strategies (Gupta & Sapienza, 1992). According to Sahlman (1997,p.107),“From whom you raise capital is often more important than the terms.\" Investments provided by different types of VCs may have a differential effect on venture conduct and performance (Bertoni, Colombo, & Grilli, 2013).  \n\nIn this study, drawing on the knowledge-based view, we investigate how the different types of VC relate to new venture internationalization. First, we consider different VC types (Bertoni et al., 2013) and examine the different impact of foreign VC and corporate VC on new venture internationalization. Foreign VCs invest from outside the portfolio company's home country (Guler & Guillén, 2010). While many VCs exhibit local bias (Cumming & Dai, 2010), the amount of crossborder investments has been growing (Aizenman & Kendall, 2012; Chemmanur, Hull, & Krishnan, 2016; Guler & Guillén, 2010; Wright, Pruthi, & Lockett, 2005), and the prevalence of foreign VC has been increasing. Foreign VCs possess institutional knowledge about foreign markets that can help the internationalization of portfolio companies (Humphery-Jenner & Suchard, 2013). Foreign VCs also possess foreign business knowledge about suppliers and customers that support portfolio companies’ international activities (Chemmanur et al., 2016). Corporate venture capital (Corporate VC) refers to the investment provided to entrepreneurial ventures by established corporations in exchange for equity (Dushnitsky & Lenox, 2006). In addition to seeking financial returns, corporate VCs often invest in entrepreneurial ventures for strategic reasons related to their technology and markets (Dushnitsky & Lenox, 2006). Corporate VCs are part of established multinationals and possess technical knowledge and market knowledge that support new venture internationalization. Corporate VCs possess extensive network knowledge about customers, suppliers and partners as most corporate VC units are in multinational enterprises with an extensive global network of partners (MacMillan, Roberts, Livada, & Wang, 2008). Despite indications that different types of venture capital provide different value to portfolio companies, prior research that explores the link between the types of VC and venture internationalization is limited (Maula et al., 2005).  \n\nSecond, we investigate the moderating role of VC reputation on the relationship between VC types (foreign VCs and corporate VCs) and new venture internationalization. Due to a limited history and performance track record, young ventures often cannot rely on their own reputation as they seek to grow (Hsu, 2004). Being associated with a reputable VC can help new ventures overcome the constraints involved in international expansion (Fernhaber & McDougall-Covin, 2009). We argue that reputation, another important intangible resource provided by reputable VCs, may substitute the knowledge that foreign VCs and corporate VCs provide to the new ventures that internationalize.  \n\nThis study makes a number of contributions. First, we enrich the existing literature on portfolio company internationalization. Previous work on the role of knowledge and venture internalization mostly examined the knowledge of entrepreneurs (Andersson, 2000; Fillis, 2001; Lindsay, Chadee, Mattsson, Johnston, & Millett, 2003; Terjesen & Elam, 2009). More recent research on the role of external partners in venture internationalization (e.g. Fernhaber & McDougall-Covin, 2009; Fernhaber et al., 2009) has highlighted the important role VCs play in venture internationalization.Yet, most of these studies do not differentiate among different types of VCs. By investigating the link between different types of VCs and venture internationalization, we clarify how the knowledge possessed by foreign VCs and corporate VCs facilitates foreign expansion of their portfolio companies.  \n\nWe also contribute directly to the literature on venture capital. Prior work demonstrated that different types of VCs provide different value added (Bertoni et al., 2013; Hsu, 2004; Maula & Murray, 2002). Foreign VCs can help increase new ventures' legitimacy in foreign markets and provide support using their network when their portfolio companies expand abroad (Makela & Maula, 2007). Corporate VCs not only help enhance the venture's reputation, but also provide complementary resources to their portfolio companies (Dushnitsky & Lenox, 2005; Katila, Rosenberger,& Eisenhardt, 2008). We extend this literature by demonstrating the critical role of knowledge that foreign VC and corporate VC provide on new venture internationalization.  \n\nFinally, we enrich the literature on VC reputation (Fernhaber & McDougall-Covin, 2009; Hsu, 2004; Krishnan & Masulis, 2012; Lee, Pollock,& Jin, 2011; Nahata, 2008). Prior work shows that VC reputation can add value to the venture by providing better access to management talent, customers, suppliers, other investors and established firms to develop strategic alliances (Krishnan & Masulis, 2012). Research shows that reputation can serve as an important resource when new ventures internationalize (Fernhaber & McDougall-Covin, 2009). By investigating the interplay between VC reputation and VC types on new venture internationalization, we clarify the roles of VC reputation and vC types in new venture internationalization.  \n\nThe paper is organized as follows. The next section presents our theory and hypotheses on the different types of venture capital and venture internationalization. Then, we explain our data and methods, followed by the presentation of results. Finally, we discuss our results and conclude in the last section.  \n\n## 2. Theory and hypotheses  \n\nInternationalization can help entrepreneurial ventures to grow and improve performance (Sapienza, Autio, George, & Zahra, 2006). Previous research has demonstrated that new ventures that internationalize have higher earnings, market share, ROE, sales growth and technological learning (Bloodgood, Sapienza, & Almeida, 1996; Lu & Beamish, 2001; McDougall & Oviatt, 1996; Sapienza et al., 2006; Zahra, Ireland, & Hitt, 20o0). Research has also demonstrated under which circumstances and how internationalization benefits new ventures. For instance, new ventures might internationalize early to develop international business competencies from the beginning, rather than later when path-dependency makes this more difficult (McDougall, Shane, & Oviatt, 1994). New ventures might even be required to internationalize early in response to competitive pressures, in particular when rivals already have an established international presence (Oviatt & McDougall, 1994). Early internationalization of new ventures has been shown to be a viable strategy to bypass the limitations of a small domestic market and capitalize on international market opportunities (McNaughton, 2003). A recent meta-analysis of the relationship between internationalization and firm performance in international entrepreneurship found robust evidence for a positive association between degree and scope of new venture internationalization and firm performance in terms of both profitability and growth (Schwens et al., 2018). More recently, research on the internationalization of new ventures has expanded its focus, examining what happens to these internationalized ventures as they mature, and developing more fine-grained theory regarding for instance post-entry survival and long-term performance (e.g., Autio, 2017; Cavusgil & Knight, 2015; Fariborzi & Keyhani, 2018; Ibeh, Jones, & Kuivalainen, 2018). There is also an increased focus on examining the context, dynamics, and varieties of new venture internationalization (Knight & Liesch, 2016; Ojala, Evers, & Rialp, 2018; Reuber, Dimitratos, & Kuivalainen, 2017).  \n\n### 2.1. Knowledge-based view and new venture internationalization  \n\nAccording to the knowledge-based view of the firm, firms are primarily institutions which integrate knowledge, and knowledge is regarded as the most critical resource (Grant, 1996). In the context of international business, knowledge can be leveraged to help with decisions regarding foreign market entry and operations, such as choice of markets, internationalization modes and pace, and to deal with uncertainties which are inherent in internationalization (Kogut & Zander, 1993; Liesch & Knight, 1999; Young, Hammill, Wheeler, & Davies, 1989). Knowledge is the most important resource for survival and development of firms that internationalize (Mejri & Umemoto, 2010).  \n\nFor new ventures that internationalize, the role of knowledge is even more critical. When new ventures internationalize, they face \"liability of foreignness\" (Zaheer, 1995). In fact, many new ventures experience a decline in performance when they first internationalize (Lu & Beamish, 2001). When new ventures first internationalize, they might not have a sound knowledge of local cultures and institutions, or lack legitimacy in the eyes of potential local customers and partners (Zaheer, 1995). For new ventures, liability of foreignness is exacerbated by liability of newness (Mudambi & Zahra, 2007). As new ventures generally have fewer tangible resources compared to established and large multinationals, they need to exploit tacit resources such as knowledge in order to establish and sustain any international competitive advantage (Kundu & Katz, 2003; Zahra, Matherne, & Carleton, 2003). Research has shown that knowledge intensity, the extent to which companies rely on knowledge as source of competitive advantage, is associated with better learning capabilities necessary for international adaptation and subsequent faster international growth for new ventures (Autio et al., 20oo). Knowledge can also foster the development of unique products, which allow new ventures to serve particular international markets and increase their market share and sales (Knight & Cavusgil, 2004). Knowledge which plays a key role in new venture internationalization can originate from within the new venture, or externally from investors or other network ties (Bloodgood et al., 1996; Coviello & Munro, 1995; Fernhaber et al., 2009; Reuber & Fischer, 1997; Sharma & Blomstermo, 2003).  \n\n### 2.2. The role of VC on new venture internationalization  \n\nVenture capitalists are financial intermediaries who invest in privately held companies that are typically small and young (Gompers & Lerner, 2001). In addition to providing financial capital that support new venture internationalization (McDougall, Oviatt, & Shrader, 2003), VCs also provide knowledge that facilitates new venture internationalization (Fernhaber & McDougall-Covin, 2009). While knowledge is a critical resource for any firm (Grant, 1996), knowledge is especially important for these new ventures that lack tangible assets (Gompers & Lerner, 2001) and need to cope with the uncertainties of  \n\n# internationalization (Liesch & Knight, 1999).  \n\nThe knowledge that venture capitalists provide may be based on their own experience or that of other portfolio companies in which they have invested. Such knowledge, offered to PCs directly and as advice, can help young ventures as they internationalize, as market knowledge, knowledge of internationalization processes, and knowledge of international operations are crucial to market entry (Clark, Pugh, & Mallory, 1997). While many venture capitalists exhibit local bias and prefer to invest in ventures that are nearby (Cumming & Dai, 2010; Cumming & Johan, 2009), the knowledge, experience, and network resources of vC investors may influence the geographic goals of new ventures (Gupta & Sapienza, 1992). Venture capitalists with prior experience in foreign countries may perceive less risk related to internationalization (Carpenter, Pollock, & Leary, 2003) or the need for less knowledge to initiate foreign market entry (Liesch & Knight, 1999). They may therefore be more willing to invest in foreign ventures for which they have less knowledge than more local investment opportunities. VCs with international knowledge are more likely to support or even push for new venture internationalization, and can provide the new venture with international knowledge required to recognize international opportunities and expand internationalization activities (Fernhaber & McDougall-Covin, 2009). Prior work also showed that VCs may relocate a venture to another country after they make an initial investment (Cumming, Fleming, & Schwienbacher, 2009).  \n\nWhile VCs play a key role in new venture internationalization by providing knowledge necessary to support new venture internationalization (Park, LiPuma, & Prange, 2015), prior work also has demonstrated that VCs differ in their knowledge base (Maula et al., 2005). In the next sections, we investigate the knowledge that foreign VCs and corporate VCs provide and their impact on new venture internationalization.  \n\n### 2.3. Foreign venture capital  \n\nGenerally, VCs prefer to invest in domestic ventures (Cumming & Dai, 2010). However, since home markets are increasingly saturated with investors, VCs need to broaden their geographical scope and focus more on international investment opportunities. This has led to an increase in cross-border investments and the prevalence of foreign VCs (Aizenman & Kendall, 2012; Chemmanur et al., 2016; Guler & Guillén, 2010; Wright et al.,2005).  \n\nThe term “foreign VCs” refers to VCs located in a country different from the portfolio company's home country (Guler & Guillén, 2010). Compared to domestic VCs,foreign VCs have better institutional knowledge about foreign markets and are in a better position to help internationalization of the new ventures (Humphery-Jenner & Suchard, 2013). Foreign institutional knowledge is defined as the “experiential knowledge of government, institutional framework, rules, norms and values\" (Eriksson, Johanson, Majkgard, & Sharma, 1997, p.343). Companies lacking institutional knowledge find it difficult to develop a suitable understanding of the laws and norms which are prevalent in a foreign market and this extends in particular to tacit rules and conventions such as the way the law is applied by particular government agencies (Eriksson et al., 1997). Foreign VCs share their foreign institutional knowledge, providing support for the internationalization of new ventures (Humphery-Jenner & Suchard, 2013). Institutional knowledge can help reduce the cost of internationalization (Eriksson et al., 1997). As foreign VCs are embedded in local institutions and networks, they can help elicit trust for their non-domestic portfolio companies that may reduce their liability of foreignness and enhance their internationalization.  \n\nForeign business knowledge refers to “knowledge pertaining to customers, competitors and market conditions in particular foreign markets” (Zhou, 2007, p.282). Foreign VCs offer operational support and access to their networks of suppliers and customers (Chemmanur et al., 2016). Foreign venture capital investors can mitigate the portfolio company's liabilities of foreignness by providing contextual intelligence that founders may lack and increase legitimacy within both the local market and with home market investors, as their involvement in the syndicate can bring endorsement for the venture (Makela & Maula, 2005). Foreign venture capitalists also expand the venture's social capital by “bringing customer contacts and knowledge of the legal environment, opening doors to other parties such as business partners, and support in recruiting managers from the foreign location\" (Makela & Maula, 2005, p.245). Foreign venture capital firms introduce new ventures to more customers and suppliers than do domestic venture capital firms (Pruthi, Wright, & Lockett, 2003). As argued above, knowledge that foreign venture capitalists possess can facilitate internationalization of their portfolio companies. Therefore, we hypothesize:  \n\nHypothesis 1. Foreign VC is positively related to portfolio company internationalintensity.  \n\n### 2.4. Corporate venture capital  \n\nCorporate venture capital refers to “equity investments by established corporations in entrepreneurial ventures.” (Dushnitsky & Lenox, 2006). Corporate VC's parent corporations are generally multinational and allocate considerable financial resources on global market research (Maula et al., 2005). Embedded in established multinational corporations, corporate VC units have access to non-material technical, market, and business knowledge (Maula & Murray, 2001), which can facilitate portfolio company internationalization. When new ventures seek to internationalize, foreign market knowledge, which is critical for foreign expansion, is difficult to obtain (Knight & Liesch, 2002). Corporate VCs possess technical knowledge and market knowledge derived from their embeddedness in established multinational corporations and their relationship with business units and such knowledge from corporate VCs facilitates internationalization of portfolio companies. Because new ventures often possess limited tangible resource stocks, intangible resources, specifically knowledge, play a key role for new ventures that internationalize early on (Knight & Cavusgil, 2005). In fact, it is such intangible resources that form the basis for new venture internationalization (Oviatt & McDougall, 1994). Corporate VCs possess \"deep specialist knowledge across a range of related sectors as a consequence of their competitive positioning and the accumulation of technical and technological competencies\" and together with the knowledge they gain from their customer relationships, Corporate VCs have a profound and enhanced knowledge of the markets (Maula et al., 2005, p.11). Corporate VC investors also provide assistance to portfolio companies based on the linkage to the investing corporation's operational capabilities, permitting portfolio companies to make use of their manufacturing plants, distribution channels, technology or brand. Such capabilities, valuable in their own right, also lead to the development of larger networks for the venture. By providing young companies possessing a “learning advantage of newness\"(Autio et al., 20oo) with market and technical knowledge, corporate VC providers can help these ventures, facilitating the growth of their business in foreign markets.  \n\nCorporate VC investors possess extensive network knowledge. Network knowledge relates to “social and business networks that facilitate the internationalization of the firm.” (Mejri & Umemoto, 2010, p.163). As most corporate VC units are in multinational enterprises that typically maintain foreign subsidiaries and have an extensive network of partners worldwide, corporate VC provides strategic access to customers, suppliers, and partners (MacMillan et al., 2008) and helps portfolio companies obtain new foreign customers (Maula et al., 2005). In addition, corporate venture capitalists, via their international network of customers, suppliers, and partners, may more readily monitor the foreign activities of the invested venture. Such monitoring may permit the investor to intervene and provide more timely and relevant advice or contacts in support of the venture's foreign market activities. Generally, independent venture capital providers display lower preferences for geographic diversification because of the difficulty in providing assistance long distance; transnationality compounds this difficulty (Gupta & Sapienza, 1992). As the knowledge that corporate venture capitalists can facilitate international activities, we hypothesize:  \n\nHypothesis 2. Corporate VC is positively related to portfolio company internationalintensity.  \n\n### 2.5. The moderating role of VC reputation  \n\nExpansion into international markets can help ventures to increase sales and facilitate growth (Gilbert, McDougall, & Audretsch, 2006). Internationalization, in fact, can provide a chance for the firm to grow significantly and increase performance (Sapienza et al., 2006). However, there are difficulties involved with young ventures expanding abroad. Young ventures expanding abroad face liabilities of foreignness arising from entering a new country as customers, distributors and suppliers prefer to deal with domestic companies (Zaheer, 1995). Moreover, these young portfolio companies have yet to establish their reputation in the local industry (Hsu, 2004). Customers, distributors and suppliers, lacking confidence in the venture and its survival, are unlikely to build a relationship with the new venture (Starr & MacMillan, 1990). Because of their short history, it is difficult for the external parties to evaluate the ventures’ quality (Stuart, Hoang,& Hybels, 1999), potentially thwarting even an initial order or the commencement of a relationship.  \n\nWhen young ventures expand abroad, having an association with a reputable organization can help these ventures overcome potential problems that arise from being young and foreign. Prospective external partners such as customers and suppliers may consider the reputation of the venture's associates when they evaluate the quality of the venture. Being associated with reputable and prominent organizations can serve as a signal of venture quality and help increase the new venture's reputation since prominent organizations choose their associates carefully in order to avoid damaging their own reputation (Stuart et al., 1999). Having an association with a reputable VC who has staked its financial and reputational capital in the venture can facilitate international market expansion by helping the venture to overcome the liabilities of newness and foreignness and “help offset costs or risks related to market unfamiliarity and a lack of legitimacy” (Fernhaber & McDougall-Covin, 2009, p. 281).  \n\nWhile previous work demonstrates that knowledge is critical for new venture internationalization (Mejri & Umemoto, 2010), we argue that reputation, another important intangible resource that the VCs can provide, may substitute the knowledge that foreign VCs and corporate VCs provide to the new ventures that internationalize. Prior work indicates that reputation can impact the behaviors of customers, suppliers and competitors (Lichtenthaler & Ernst, 2007). The substitutability of reputation is more salient in uncertain situations (Shenkar & YuchtmanYaar, 1997; Sine, Shane, & Gregorio,2003). Significant uncertainties exist when new ventures internationalize (LiPuma & Park, 2014). Thus, wehypothesize:  \n\nHypothesis 3a.VC reputationmoderates thepositiverelationshipbetween foreignVCandportfoliocompanyinternationalintensitysuchthatVC reputationweakens thepositiverelationshipbetweenforeign VC and internationalintensity.  \n\nHypothesis 3b.VC reputation moderates thepositiverelationshipbetween corporateVCandportfoliocompanyinternationalintensitysuchthatVC reputation weakens the positive relationshipbetween corporate VC and internationalintensity.  \n\n## 3.Methods  \n\n### 3.1. Data  \n\nWe test the hypotheses using a cross-industry sample of 646 U.S.- based,VC-backed new ventures that executed an IPO between 1995 and 2010. Following Fernhaber and Li (2013) and Carpenter et al. (2003), a venture was considered to be a new venture if the age of the venture was 10 years or younger at the time of IPO. We compiled the company data from VentureXpert and Global New Issues within Thomson Financial's SDC (henceforth SDC) Platinum database. We included companies from all SDC Venture Economics Industry Codes (VEIC). Technology-based companies dominated IPO markets in the sample period. Since technology-based companies are more likely to receive VC (Gompers, 1995) and to enter foreign markets early in their lives (Johnson, 2004), our choice of context allows for both effective study of the phenomenon as well as generalizability of the results. We obtained data for the ventures’ foreign VC and corporate VC receipt from SDC Platinum VentureXpert. This database contains data on all disbursements of venture capital received by U.S. companies and identifies different types of venture capital. We obtained data on foreign activity from SEC filings (S-1 and 10 K).  \n\n### 3.2. Dependent variable  \n\nThe dependent variable is International intensity. International intensity measures the percentage of foreign sales over total sales (FSTS) during the IPO year. FSTS is a frequently used measure of internationalization (e.g. Preece, Miles, & Baetz, 1999; Zahra et al., 2000). We obtained FSTS from SEC filings (S-1 s and 10-Ks) required prior to IPO.  \n\n### 3.3.Independent variables  \n\nThe independent variable Foreign VC is the percentage of foreign VCs, measured using the number of foreign VCs that invested in the focal venture divided by the number of total investors in the focal venture.  \n\nThe independent variable, Corporate VC is the percentage of corporate VCs, measured using the number of corporate VCs that invested in the focal venture divided by the number of total investors in the focal venture.  \n\nThe independent variable VC reputation is based on the Lee-PollockJin VC Reputation Index (Lee et al., 2011). This index is a multi-item VC reputation index based on “the total number of portfolio companies a VC invested in; the total funds invested in portfolio firms; the total dollar amount of funds raised; the number of individual funds raised; the number of firms taken public; and VC age\" (Lee et al., 201l, p. 41). We calculated the percentage of reputable investors, measured using the number of top quartile VCs from the Lee-Pollock-Jin VC Reputation Index (Lee et al., 2011) that invested in the focal venture divided by the number of total investors in the focal venture. Our use of the top quartile is consistent with previous work on VC reputation which has also examined the ventures with vCs in the top reputation quartile (Krishnan, Ivanov, Masulis, & Singh, 2011).  \n\n### 3.4. Control variables  \n\nWe address other factors potentially related to internationalization by adding various control variables. We include venture Age, measured in years between the date of venture formation and the IPO date. Previous work on internationalization has shown that internationalization is a function of firm age (Johanson & Vahlne,1977). Size is the natural log of the number of employees of a focal venture (George, Wiklund, & Zahra, 2005; Maula & Murray, 2001). Internationalization is costly and it maybe easier for ventureswithmore resources to expand abroad. We also include International Experience of top management team. Following Fernhaber et al. (2009), we examined the IPO prospectus for each venture and coded each top management team member as 1 “if their biography indicated they had held a position overseeing the international component for a previous employer or had worked in a foreign company or for the foreign subsidiary of a U.S. company\" (Fernhaber et al., 2009, p. 305) and 0 otherwise, which was summed for each venture to denote international experience. We control for Funds, measured as the natural log of the total equity investment received by a focal venture. The amount of investment has been linked to performance (Chang, 2004) and may potentially impact foreign expansion of the venture. We also control for Total investor, a count of the number of all the investors invested in the focal venture. Additionally, we control for Investor Size, by taking the natural log of the size of the largest VC that invested in the company and Investor Experience, measured using the maximum number of investments in thousands made by the investors that invested in a focal venture (Humphery-Jenner & Suchard, 2013), as investor size and investments can impact firm performance. Syndication is a dichotomous variable that indicates whether the investments that the focal venture received were syndicated. We control for the IPO year since the ventures in the sample vary in terms of their IPO timing. A dichotomous variable Bubble controls for the dotcom crash, with a value of 1 for the new ventures that went public before the dot-com crash and a value of O otherwise. Finally, we include dummies for all SDC Industries in the sample. Studies indicate that there is industry variation in terms of VC participation (Gompers, 1995; Keil, Zahra, & Maula, 2016) and performance (McGahan & Porter, 1997).  \n\n## 4. Results  \n\nTable 1 presents the descriptive statistics and correlations for the variables in the sample. The correlations are generally low. The variance inflation factor was also below the 10 standard benchmark (Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, & Tatham, 1998), so there was no concern with multicollinearity. $34.7\\%$ oftheportfoliocompanies wereinternationalized in our sample. Of those that internationalized their average international intensity was $35.2\\%$ . Foreign VCs made up on average $4\\%$ of the total investors in a focal venture and corporate VC made up on average $11\\%$ of the total investors that invested in a focal venture.  \n\nModels 1 and 2 in Table 2 show the results of Tobit regression. We used Tobit regression due to the left censoring of the variable International intensity (Fernhaber & McDougall-Covin, 2009), as not all companies in the sample have foreign sales. Tobit regression has been used in previous studies that examined international intensity (e.g. Fernandez & Nieto, 2006; Rodriguez & Rodriguez, 2005). Model 1 includes only the control variables and Model 2 adds the variable Foreign VC testing Hypothesis 1. The coefficient estimate for the variable Foreign VC is positive and significant, supporting Hypothesis 1 which proposed that foreign VC participation in the venture is positively related to the venture's international intensity. If foreign VC participation in a new venture were to increase by one percentage point, the international intensity of the new venture would increase by 0.779 percentage points. This means that if foreign VC participation in a new venture were to increase by one standard deviation (o.o9), the international intensity of the new venture would increase by 7.011 percentagepoints.  \n\nModel 3 in Table 2 adds the variable Corporate VC testing Hypothesis 2 which proposed that corporate VC participation in the venture is positively related to the venture's international intensity. The coefficient estimate for the variable Corporate VC is positive and significant, supporting Hypothesis 2 which proposed that corporate VC participation in the venture is positively related to the venture's international intensity. If corporate VC participation in a new venture were to increase by one percentage point, the international intensity of the new venture would increase by 0.39 percentage points. This means that if corporate VC participation in a new venture were to increase by one standard deviation (0.14), the international intensity of the new venture would increase by 5.46 percentage points.  \n\nHypothesis 3a proposed that VC reputation moderates the relationship between foreign VC and internationalization and Hypothesis 3b proposed that VC reputation moderates the relationship between corporate VC and internationalization. Model 4 in Table 2 adds the interaction term Foreign VC x VC reputation and Corporate VC x VC reputation.  \n\nThe coefficient estimate for the interaction term Foreign VC $\\mathbf{X}$ VC reputation is not significant. While the interaction coefficient is not significant, we examine the confidence intervals to avoid understating interaction results as the marginal effect may statistically differ from zero for certain values of the moderating variable (Kingsley, Noordewier, & Vanden Bergh, 2017). Fig. 1 displays the interaction with respect to how VC reputation moderates the positive relationship between foreign VC and international intensity. Contrary to what we predicted, the plot does not show that the main effect is attenuated when reputation increases. The corresponding confidence intervals show that foreign VC has a significant positive effect on the lower values of reputation, but the effects are not statistically different from zero on the higher values of reputation. Hypothesis 3a is not supported.  \n\nThe interaction term Corporate VC x VC reputation is negative and significant. Fig. 2 displays the interaction with respect to how VC reputation weakens the positive relationship between corporate VC and international intensity. The plot is consistent with our hypothesis. Once again, we examine the confidence intervals to avoid overstating interaction results (Kingsley et al., 2017).

Additional analyses  \n\nWe conducted additional analyses to check the results of our Tobit analyses. We reran the analyses using interval regression. Interval regression accounts for the left censoring of the dependent variable international intensity and has been used in previous study on international intensity (Fernhaber et al., 2009). The results of the interval regression analyses showed qualitatively similar results.  \n\nWe also conducted additional analyses to check our results. Instead of using the percentage of the foreign VCs and corporate VCs as independent variables, we re-conducted our Tobit analyses using the percentage of foreign venture capital funding and the percentage of corporate venture capital funding that the focal venture received. The analyses showed qualitatively similar results.  \n\nFurthermore, we conducted additional analyses to investigate whether other forms of capital received by the venture are complements or substitutes with the foreign VC or corporate VC. Previous work shows that different forms of finance such as capital from angels, incubators, universities and government can interact with VC funding which may impact scale-up finance and initial public offerings (Cumming, Johan, & Zhang, 2018). We examined the interaction between the foreign VC and angel investors, and corporate VC and angel investors on new venture internationalization. We did not find any significant effects for these interaction terms. We also investigated the interaction between foreign VC and government grants, corporate VC and government grants, foreign VC and universities, corporate VC and universities, foreign VC and incubators, and corporate VC and incubators. None of the interaction terms was significant. However, it is important to note that the number of ventures in the sample that received funding from governments $\\mathtt{(n=25}$ ,universities ${\\bf(n=11}$ ),and incubators $\\left(\\mathtt{n}=7\\right)$ was very limited and the results should be interpreted with caution.  \n\n![](images/2a627b17b3ca9a82f67a507d45054a626604d89578edb2aa51960cb0476ad338.jpg)  \nFig. 1.

Interaction Plot: Corporate VC and VC Reputation.  \n\nFinally, we checked for endogeneity, which is an important issue in research related to internationalization (Reeb, Sakakibara, & Mahmood, 2012). In our study, the possible concern is that the international activities of new ventures may cause the foreign VC, corporate VC and reputable VC to invest, instead of the foreign VC, corporate VC and reputable VC facilitating internationalization. We address this endogeneity issue following Humphery-Jenner and Suchard's (2013) method of investigating subsamples in which endogeneity is less likely to be present. We examine the subsample of companies that received investment within their first year of founding. Very young ventures are less likely to have international activities and therefore endogeneity might be less likely to hold for the set of very young portfolio companies. The analyses showed qualitatively similar results.  \n\n## 5. Discussion and conclusion  \n\nThis paper investigated how different types of VCs relate to venture internationalization. Our results show that foreign VC is positively related to the international intensity of the new venture. Foreign VCs offer foreign institutional knowledge (Humphery-Jenner & Suchard, 2013) and knowledge about customers and business partners in a foreign country (Makela & Maula, 2005), which may support the internationalization of new ventures. Our findings also indicate that corporate VC is positively related to the international intensity of the new venture.Corporate VCs that are linked to established multinational corporations provide network knowledge about customers, suppliers, and partners (MacMillan et al., 2008) and profound and enhanced knowledge of the global markets (Maula et al., 2005). While we did not find support for the hypothesized moderating role of VC reputation on the relationship between foreign VC and new venture internationalization, our results show that the investment from reputable VC weakens the positive relationship between corporate VC and international intensity. This effect is only significant at lower values of VC reputation. Reputable VCs can facilitate new venture's foreign expansion by enabling the venture to draw on VC's reputation and providing legitimacy which help liabilities of newness and foreignness (Fernhaber & McDougall-Covin, 2009). Prior work showed that reputation can act as a substitute for knowledge (Shenkar & YuchtmanYaar, 1997; Sine et al., 2003), and our results show that reputation substitutes the knowledge that corporate VCs provide in the context of new venture internationalization.  \n\nWe contribute to the literature on new venture internationalization. We extend previous work that examined the role of VCs in new venture internationalization (e.g. Fernhaber & McDougall-Covin,  2009; Fernhaber et al., 2009; Makela & Maula, 2005; Park et al., 2015). Drawing on the knowledge-based view, our investigation of how different types of venture capital (foreign VC and corporate VC) and reputation relate to new venture internationalization provides a more fine-grained view of the support different VCs provide in new venture internationalization. Knowledge sourced externally from foreign VCs and corporate VCs can play an important role when new ventures internationalize.  \n\nWe also enrich the literature on venture capital. Previous studies have investigated different value-added provided by different VCs (Bertoni et al., 2013; Hsu, 2004; Humphery-Jenner & Suchard, 2013; Maula & Murray, 2002). We demonstrate that VCs have heterogeneous knowledge bases, thus foreign VCs and corporate VCs provide different value-added when new ventures internationalize. Our study may help explain the mixed results in the previous studies that examined the relationshipbetweenthe VC and new venture internationalization (Fernhaber & McDougall-Covin, 2009). Our results show that the magnitude of the positive impact on new venture internationalization is higher for foreign VCs compared corporate VCs. We demonstrate that not all vCs can provide the same level of support for new ventures that internationalize.  \n\nFinally, we contribute to the literature on VC reputation (Fernhaber & McDougall-Covin, 2009; Hsu, 2004; Krishnan & Masulis, 2012; Nahata, 2008). Our paper demonstrates that reputation, another important intangible resource that VCs provide, may substitute the knowledge that corporate VCs provide to aid portfolio company internationalization. The positive relationship between corporate VC involvement and new venture internationalization diminishes when reputable VCs invest in the new venture. This finding points to the important role that VC reputation plays in new venture internationalization.Reputable VCs can facilitate new venture's foreign expansion by enabling the venture to draw on VC's reputation and providing legitimacy that helps overcome liabilities of newness and foreignness (Fernhaber & McDougall-Covin, 2009). Reputable VCs may also exert more control rights on portfolio companies, aiding in their professionalization and enhancing their abilities to successfully deal with the complexities of foreign operation. While we demonstrate that reputation may serve as a substitute for VC's knowledge as in the case of corporate VCs, our results also suggest that reputation does not substitute the knowledge that foreign venture capitalists provide. The contextual knowledge that FVCs provide may not be substitutable by a reputable VC investor.We provide a more fine-grained view of the interplay between VC reputation and knowledge that different VCs provide in new venture internationalization.  \n\nWhile the focus of our paper was on VC and how different types of VC impacts new venture internalization, future research may investigate whether different forms of finance such as funds received from crowdfunding, angels, incubators, universities and government that ventures receive are complements or substitutes. For instance,previous literature found that angel investment is more sensitive to international differences (Cumming & Zhang, 2019) and incubators and VCs are substitutes in terms of advice and support provided (Cumming, Werth, & Zhang, 2019). Prior work also suggests that crowdfunding may facilitate internationalization of start-ups (Cumming & Johan, 2017). Given the limited nature of our sample, future investigation into interactions between different forms of finance on new venture internationalization would enable scholars to better understand the link between venture financing and internationalization. Additionally, our study only looks at U.s.-based new ventures. Extensions of this study mayinvestigate how different types of investors mayimpact the internalization of new ventures that are based in emerging countries. Prior work shows that VCs from developed economy who invest in new ventures based in emerging economy can lower psychological, managerial, and financial barriers when these ventures consider internationalization (Yamakawa, Peng, & Deeds, 2008). We should also note the implications of restricting our sample to ventures that have executed an IPO. The characteristics, motivations, and behaviors of these companies may be significantly different from those that have chosen to stay private. This selection bias is particularly relevant to our study in that CVC-backed ventures are less likely to execute IPOs (Cumming, Knill, & Syvrud, 2016; Kim & Park, 2017). As IPOs of their portfolio companies provide fewer strategic advantages, CVCs are less motivated to take them public (Kim & Park, 2017). In addition, CVC-backed ventures are more likely to go bankrupt (Cumming et al., 2016), suggesting a survivorship bias in our sample. Such sample biases and their relationship to CVC may affect our findings regarding internationalization of CVC-backed ventures. A limitation of this study may thus be its generalizability to private ventures. Extensions of this paper with samples including non-IPO companies may discover if and how VC-backed IPO and non-IPO ventures differ in their international intensity.  \n\nOverall, this study extends the current understanding of VC's role in new venture internationalization. Decomposing the venture capital investors into different types permits a more nuanced analysis of their respective resources, adding a more fine-grained understanding of how venture capital support new venture internationalization.  \n\n### 5.1. Managerial relevance  \n\nThis study has implications for practitioners. For venture capitalists, who develop syndicates that require time to construct and incur increased communication and coordination costs for foreign partners, a greater understanding of the value-added for various VC types may inform their syndicate construction. Understanding the respective benefits of different VCs such as foreign VCs and corporate VCs, and VC reputation, can help entrepreneurs to make more informed decisions about investors and international strategies.  \n\n## Acknowledgement  \n\nWe are grateful to Senior Editor Christian Schwens and our anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.  \n\n## References  \n\nAizenman, J., &Kendall J 2012).

VC appears initially \"patient\" in that VC-financed firms are less likely to fail in the first five years but conditional on surviving past this point become more likely to fail relative to non-VC-financed firms. We perform a number of robustness checks and find that VC does not appear to have more stringent survival thresholds nor do VC-financed firm failures appear to be disguised as acquisitions nor do particular kinds of VC firms seem to be driving our results. Overall, our analysis supports the view that VC is \"patient\" capital relative to other non-VC sources of entrepreneurial capital in the early part of firms' lifecycles and that an important criterion for receiving VC investment is potential for large scale, rather than level of profitability, prior to exit.  \n\nManju Puri   \nFuqua School of Business   \nDuke University   \n1 Towerview Drive, Box 90120   \nDurham, NC 27708-0120   \nand NBER   \nmpuri $@$ duke.edu  \n\nRebecca Zarutskie Duke University rebeccaz $@$ duke.edu  \n\n## I. Introduction  \n\nThe venture capital (VC) industry has been growing at a very fast pace for the last twenty years. In 1980 the total amount of money newly invested by venture capitalists in the U.S. was estimated at $\\$610$ million. By 1990 this figure had already increased to $\\$2.3$ billion and in 1998 it reached $\\$21.4$ billion. While the numbers increased still further during the late 1990s and 2000, in 2005 the amount invested by venture capitalists was around $\\$22.6$ billion, slightly higher than the 1998 level of $\\$21.4$ billion. Clearly, VC is growing as a significant source of financing for new firms, yet many questions about VC as an institution, which type of firms it finances and the life cycle dynamics of VC financed firms remain. In particular much of our understanding of VC-financed firms comes from analysis of firms that are successful and survive. We have little understanding of VC-financed firms that fail, as well as the counterfactual - the life cycle dynamics of firms that could potentially use VC but do not.  \n\nPart of the reason that research into these questions is difficult is the scarcity of data on private firms - particularly non-VC-financed firms. In this paper we use a new panel data set collected by the U.s. Census Bureau that tracks firms from their birth over more than two decades to address a number of questions related to the role of VC in new firm creation. Since our data allows us large sample identification of both firms that do and do not receive VC financing we are able to characterize and quantify differences between VC-financed and nonVC-financed firms in the early part of their life cycles - from birth to exit - and to shed light on some of the outstanding questions about the role of VC in new firm creation.  \n\nIn particular, we first ask to what market-wide and firm-level characteristics venture capitalists respond in choosing to make their investments. Is VC more responsive to public market signals of investment opportunity within industries, such as IPO activity or Tobin’s Q, relative to non-VC sources of financing?  In terms of firm characteristics, does VC disproportionately back firms with proven success? Or is VC looking for firms with ideas that need large initial investment and eventually achieve large scale? We then ask what are the eventual differences in outcomes for firms that receive VC financing and those that do not? How do VC-financed firms that fail compare to non-VC-financed firms that fail? Or that are acquired? Are the criteria or thresholds for exit used by investors in these two sets of firms significantly different? Is VC “patient money” or is it quick to identify and terminate failures?  \n\nDo the answers hinge on activity by particular kinds of VC? Understanding these and related questions can help us better understand the life cycle dynamics of firms that receive VC financing and shed light on the underlying incentives of venture capitalists.  \n\nWe first examine new firm creation as a function of the IPO activity in an industrial sector, as well as Tobin's Q, a more traditional public market measure of investment opportunity. Many have argued that VC and investment banks fuelled a disproportionate number of new firms in sectors with “hot’ IPO and public market opportunities, in the hope of early cashing out. Interestingly, we find that while more firms are created in sectors that experience greater IPO activity and higher Tobin's Q, the proportion of VC-financed firms created in these sectors does not change significantly during these periods of positive public market signals. Thus, it is not just VC that responds to public market cues, but entrepreneurial capital in general responds to public market signals of investment opportunities in its investment in new firms. One could view this as economy-wide signals being interpreted in much the same way by different sources of capital for start-ups, as opposed to VC driving waves of new firm creation in industries with positive public market signals of investment opportunity.  \n\nWe then examine which kinds of firms receive VC over our sample period. Our results support the notion that VC invests in firms with ideas and no immediate revenues, but which require large initial investment in assets and employment. We find that firms born with no commercial revenues are disproportionately financed by VC. In fact, over $50\\%$ of new firms in the latter part of our sample which received VC financing were started without any commercial revenues. Moreover, most of these firms received VC before they realized commercial revenues. This is true in “high-tech\" industries, such as biotech and computers, and in “low-tech\" industries such as retail and wholesale trade. We find that at every stage of the firm's life cycle - at birth, at the time of VC financing, and beyond, on average VC-financed firms persistently tend to be an order of magnitude larger than non-VC-financed firms, as measured by employment and sales. Interestingly, we see little difference in profitability before VC-financed firms are exited via acquisition or IPO. These results suggest that the key firm characteristic on which VC focuses is scale or potential for scale, rather than profitability. Even after matching each VCfinanced firm to a non-VC-financed firm on characteristics such as age of the firm, 4-digit SIC code, geographical region, and same employment size at the time the VC-financed firms first receives VC, we find that scale, rather than profitability, is the distinguishing characteristic of VC-financed firms relative to non-VC-financed firms.  \n\nThese results are for surviving firms. However, it is important to examine firms that survive in conjunction with firms that do not. One possible explanation for these results is that the surviving firms might simply reflect the dynamics of VC-financed firm failure. If smaller VC-financed firms are shut down earlier relative to non-VC-financed firms, this might explain why VC-financed firms are larger in our sample.  \n\nWe examine a number of hypotheses about firm failure to better understand VC behavior towards companies that do not do well. Arguably, this is one of the least understood aspects of VC behavior. Our sample allows an in depth examination of new firm failure dynamics since we observe what is the eventual outcome of all firms in our sample - either failure, acquisition or IPO - and can examine firm characteristics at the time these outcomes occur. Using our matched sample of VC-financed and non-VC-financed firms, we first ask whether the larger scale of VCfinanced firms reflects a higher failure rate for firms receiving VC. Second, we ask not only whether there is a differential probability of firm failure but whether the time to failure is different between VC- and non-VC-financed firms. Third, we ask if VC-financed firms have different thresholds for failure than non-VC-financed firms. Fourth, we ask if for VC-financed firms failure is disguised as acquisition. Last, but not least, we ask if the patterns for VCfinanced firms reflect the behavior of certain kinds of VC, such as high (low) reputed VC, or whether we see these broad patterns across the board.  \n\nIn answering our first question, whether the larger scale of VC-financed firms reflects a higher failure rate for firms receiving VC, both in the larger panel and in our matched sample we find that the cumulative probability of failure is lower for VC-financed firms. The failure rate for VC-financed firms is significantly lower in the larger panel and slightly lower in the matched sample. We do not observe that on average VC-financed firms are more likely to fail than their non-VC-financed counterparts. Thus, it is not the case that the average differences in size between VC- and non-VC-financed firms over time is being driven by higher VC-financed firms failure rates.  \n\nIn general we find that failure dynamics are somewhat nuanced, particularly when we ask whether the time to failure is different between VC- and non-VC-financed firms. Some argue that venture capitalists are impatient and push their companies hard to grow quickly, deciding relatively rapidly which firms have the best chance of achieving a successful exit and terminating those that do not in the interest of allocating more capital to the likely winners in their portfolios. Others argue that VCs have a more difficult time judging which firms will be successful in the early stages of investment and equally nurture and invest in all of their firms over a certain period of time. We find that failure dynamics of VC- and non-VC-financed firms are nuanced. The answer to whether VC-financed firms fail more often is a function of the time period under consideration. We find that VC is “patient’ at least in the first five years after first receiving VC. In our matched sample, the probability of a VC-financed firm failing is much lower than a nonVC-financed firm, but the probability of a VC-financed firm failing is actually higher than for non-VC-financed firms conditional on their having survived for more than five years. Thus, venture capitalists allow firms time to grow and appear to be “patient' but only to a certain point. There is a window in which they allow firms to continue and grow, but once this is crossed, then venture capitalists are relatively quick to shut their firms down.  \n\nThe third question we ask with regards to failure is if VC-financed firms have different thresholds for failure than non-VC-financed firms. When VC-financed firms are ultimately shut down do they look significantly different in terms of size or profitability relative to non-VCfinanced firms that are shut down? Some argue that venture capitalists may terminate firms that other investors would keep alive because of higher VC hurdle rates, while other argue that venture capitalists give even their failed firms more opportunities to grow and prove themselves relative to investors in non-VC-financed firms in an attempt to learn which of their investments will be the huge successes.  We find that in our matched sample VC-financed firms are significantly larger when they fail in terms of employees and sales, but are not very different in terms of profitability at the time of failure. In fact VC-financed firms appear slightly less profitable at failure. These results suggest that venture capitalists care about scale for all firms that they invest in, investing heavily in all their firms for an initial period until they have a better sense of which ones will be the successes in their portfolios.  \n\nFourth, we ask if for VC-financed firms failure is disguised as acquisition. While we have observed that VC-financed firms have lower average probabilities of failure, it is possible that venture capitalists are able to sell their poor performers to other companies due to VC connections or natural synergies with potential acquirers, whereas non-VC-financed firms simply must shut down. We examine if VC-financed firms differ significantly from non-VC-financed firms at the time that they are acquired. We find there is no significant difference in terms of size, as measured by employment or sales, or profitability at the time of acquisition. Hence there is no evidence to suggest that VC failures are being camouflaged as acquisitions. In fact, if anything, our evidence suggests that in fact VC-financed and non-VC-financed firms must meet the same size and profitability criteria to be acquired. We also examine VC- and non-VCfinanced firms at the time they go public and find similar results. There are no significant differences between them when they go public. This analysis suggests that the large initial investments in employment and other assets by VC in the firms it finances is an attempt to get each firm to the critical scale and position in which it needs to be in order to be successfully exited via IPO or acquisition. More VC-financed firms achieve these successful exits with VC providing the cash and patience to grow them initially, but those VC-financed that do not achieve IPO or acquisition exits are much more likely to be shut down relative to non-VC-financed firms that manage to survive past the initial VC trial period.  \n\nLast, but not least, we ask if the patterns for VC-financed firms reflect the behavior of certain kinds of VC, such as high (low) reputed VC, or whether we see these broad patterns across the board. We find the pattern of failure that we observe in the overall sample is also observed in the subsamples of both high and low reputation venture capitalists. While there are some small differences in the exact nature of timing, the overall patterns are quite similar for both types of VC. Both high and low reputed VC-financed firms are less likely to shut down initially than non-VC financed firms, but after a point (4-5 years) the VC financed firms are more likely to shut down. Moreover, the general differences observed between VC- and nonVC-financed firms in terms of size and profitability over the life cycle and at exit are present in our both our subsamples of high and low reputed VC-financed firms.  \n\nOur work adds to the existing literature on the role that VC plays in the firms it finances. To date, this literature has mainly focused on differences between VC- and non-VC-financed firms that have had successful outcomes, such as an IPO, or on VC-financed firms in isolation (e.g., Gompers and Lerner (2001), Lerner (1995), Kaplan and Stromberg (2003, 2004). Studies examining differences in behavior and outcomes between VC- and non-VC-financed firms have largely had to rely on firms that have gone public (e.g., Baker and Gompers (1999), Brav and Gompers (1997), Hochberg (2005), Megginson and Weiss (1991)) or firms that have had some other successful conditional outcome like joining a strategic alliance (e.g., Lindsey (2008)). A few studies have examined smaller hand-collected samples of private non-VC-financed and VCfinanced firms but have been limited to certain geographies, time periods and industries (e.g., Baron, Hannan and Burton (1999) and Hellmann and Puri (2000, 2002)). Another approach taken by some studies is to examine the impact of different kinds of VCs on investment outcome (e.g., Botazzi, Hellmann and Da Rin (2007), Gompers (1996), Sorensen (2007), Zarutskie (2008)). By examining the universe of private firms as captured in the Census, and comparing the life-cycle dynamics of both VC- as compared to non-VC firms, we are able to understand exit, in particular failure dynamics of VC versus non-VC financed firms. This is arguably the least understood part of the VC investing process, that throws light on VC incentives at different parts of the process.  \n\nOur analysis also informs the debate over whether venture capitalists behave in a shorttermist manner relative to non-VC sources of entrepreneurial capital in their growth and shut down decisions. Overall, our analysis indicates that VC is a relatively patient source of capital. However, there is a limit to its patience. Getting VC significantly increases firms’ chances of survival in their early years and speeds their investment and growth, as venture capitalists invest in learning about which of their firms will achieve the scale and other criteria necessary for a successful exit.  VC-financed firms experience high investment in employment and low profitability relative to non-VC-financed firms in the early part of their life cycles as they grow their sales and develop their business models. However, this initial nurturing period of VC financing comes with a cost. Once the period has finished VC-financed firms face a higher probability of being shut down, as well as being acquired or going public, relative to non-VCfinanced firms that also survive past the same initial trial period. While taking VC financing ex ante lowers the probability of firm failure, conditional on surviving for a number of years, the probability of failure as a VC-financed firms is actually higher.  \n\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II describes our data. Section III examines the market-level and firm-level characteristics to which venture capitalists respond when making investments. Section IV examines the differences in exit dynamics of VC- and non-VC-financed firms and explores a number of hypotheses related to the failure dynamics of VC-financed firms. Section V concludes.  \n\n### I1. Data  \n\nWe begin by describing the Longitudinal Business Database, the main panel data set we use to track firms from birth to first exit via IPO, acquisition or shut down. We also describe the U.S. Census Bureau data sets we merge to the Longitudinal Business Database to obtain additional information on firm-level sales and costs. We then discuss how we identify VCfinanced firms in the data by linking the Longitudinal Business Database to VentureXpert, a commonly used commercial data set that contains information on U.S. VC deals. Finally, we discuss how we form a matched sample of VC- and non-VC-financed firms based on firm characteristics at the time the VC-financed firms first receive VC financing. We use both the entire Longitudinal Business Database and our matched sample in our empirical analysis.  \n\n#### A. The Longitudinal Business Database  \n\nThe Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) is a panel data set that tracks all U.S. employer business establishments from 1975 to the present.l The version of the LBD we use ends in 2001. The LBD contains information on employment, payroll, industry, location, and organizational form for each business establishment. We can also observe the years an establishment enters and exits the LBD.  Since we are interested in understanding the relation between firm-level characteristics  and  VC financing,  we  aggregate  business-establishment-level payroll  and employment data for multi-establishment firms using firm-level identifiers.  We classify the industry and geography of multi-establishment firms as the modal industry and geography of the firms’ business establishments. For a more detailed description of the variables contained in the LBD and how it is formed see Jarmin and Miranda (2002).  \n\nWe begin tracking firms from their birth, or year of first entry into the LBD. A business establishment enters the LBD when it has at least one employee who is paid a wage on which U.S. payroll taxes are levied. Hence, we observe firms from the point in time at which their first business establishement hires its first tax-paying employee.2 We classify a firm's year of birth in the LBD as the year in which its first establishment enters the LBD. Most firms, including VCfinanced firms, enter the LBD as single establishment firms. We track firms from their year of birth to the year of their first exit event - IPO, acquisition or shut down - or until 2001 when our data ends.  \n\nWe classify a firm as shutting down, or failing, when all of its establishments exit the LBD. A firm which has two or more business establishments will only be classified as failing if both of its establishments exit the LBD. The year of failure for the firm will be year in which the last establishment is shut down. We classify a firm as having been acquired if all of its business establishments have been acquired by another firm. We are able to distinguish between a firm acquiring another firm's establishments and having its own establishments acquired by another firm since the LBD allows us to observe which firm takes control of the business establishments. We categorize an acquisition exit event as the latter scenario in which a firm's establishments are taken over by another firm. Finally, we identify firms that have had an initial public offering of the firms’ equity by merging a list of firms having IPOs between 1975 and 2001 in the U.S. to the LBD based on firm name.  \n\nIf a firm has more than one exit event, e.g. if it goes public then gets acquired, we classify the firm's exit event as the one which occurs first.  We track firms from their birth to their first exit event because we are interested in comparing outcomes of firms during years in which venture capitalists are actively involved in the companies they finance. Most venture capitalists sell their holdings in their portfolio companies at the first exit opportunity.  \n\n#### B. Obtaining Information on Sales and Costs  \n\nWe supplement the payroll and employment data in the LBD with sales data from three additional Census data sources - the Economic Censuses of Services, Retail and Wholesale Trade, the Longitudinal Research Database for Manufacturing and the Standard Statistical Establishment List.We also obtain additional cost information from the Longintudinal ResearchDatabase.  \n\nThe Economic Censuses of Services, Retail Trade and Wholesale Trade collect information on the value of goods produced in each of business establishment in the services, retail and wholesale trade industries every five years, for years ending in 2 and 7.3 Although the variable is labeled as sales in the Economic Census Waves it is not necessarily identical to cash revenues reported on a firm's financial statement or tax return.  The sales number in the Economic Census waves is an estimate of the value of goods produced by the establishment. As a result, very few business establishments report zero sales in the Economic Census waves since they all typically produce something whether or not it is actually ever sold for cash. Thus, when cash revenues are zero, the Economic Census sales value may be positive but very low. The correlation between Economic Census sales and tax return revenues which we obtain from the Standard Statistical Establishment LIst in 1997 and the 1997 Census waves is very high at around 0.9, and the average absolute difference between these two variables is very low at around a few hundred dollars.  \n\nFor firms in the manufacturing industries (SIC codes 2000-3999), we are able to obtain information on both the value of goods produced as well as information on operating costs and capital expenditures. In addition to collecting this data in the five-year Economic Census of Manufactures waves, the Census Bureau also collects this information for a stratified random sample of manufacturing firms every year as part of its Annual Survey of Manufactures. The Economic Census of Manufactures waves combined with the Annual Survey of Manufactures in the non-Census years comprise the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD).  \n\nThe SSEL is list of business establishments maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau that is updated on an annual basis. The SSEL contains data from U.S. government administrative records, such as tax returns, and is augmented with data from Census surveys and data sets. Much of the information contained in the LBD is derived from information in the SSEL. Beginning in 1995, the SSEL contains firm-level revenues as reported on firms? tax returns. Tax return revenue data is available for about two thirds of firms in the SSEL. The advantage of the SSEL tax return data is that it gives a measure of actual cash obtained by each firm in a given year, as opposed to an estimate of the value of goods produced as in the other Census data sets described below. The disadvantage, however is that the data is only available in the last seven years of our twenty year sample period. Thus, we primarily use the sales data in the Economic Census waves and the LRD in our empirical analysis.  \n\n#### C. Identifying VC-financed Firms in the LBD  \n\nWe identify firms in the LBD as VC-financed if they can be matched to a June 2005 extract of VentureXpert based on name and address. VentureXpert is a database maintained by Thomson Financial which contains information on both venture capital investment firms and the companies in which they invest. Among other variables, VentureXpert contains information on which firms receive VC financing, from which VC firms and funds, and when the investments take place. Comprehensive coverage of the U.s. VC industry by VentureXpert begins in the early 1980s. We include in our extract any VC-financed firm located in the U.S. and whose first round of financing is classified as either “Startup/Seed,”“Early Stage,”’“Expansion,” and “Later Stage.\"' We exclude companies whose first round of financing is recorded as “Buyout/Acquisition,\" “Other,” and “Unknown.\" We also exclude companies that are missing name or address information. We match 16,109 of these VentureXpert companies to the LBD. Appendix A contains a detailed description the algorithm we use to match VentureXpert to the LBD.  \n\n#### D. Matching VC-Financed and Non-VC-Financed Firms in the LBD  \n\nWe also form a one-to-one matched sample of VC- and non-VC-financed firms in the LBD based on firm characteristics at the time VC-financed firms first receive VC. One may always ask whether differences between VC- and non-VC-financed firms are due to venture capitalists selecting better firms or entrepreneurs or whether the nature of VC financing itself and the role venture capitalists may play in the governance and operation of VC-financed firms cause these observed differences between VC- and non-VC-financed firms. Hence our next step is to match each VC-financed firm to a non-VC-financed firm at the time of getting VC funding based on four characteristics. These characteristics are age of the firm, 4-digit SIC code, geographical region, same employment size.4 We re-examine the relation between VC financing and firm size and exit for a set of firms that are observationally similar at the time at which one of them gets VC funding and the other does not. While this does not completely enable us to distinguish selection from causation, it does allow us to make a statement about differences between VCand non-VC-financed firms that are identical on certain observable characteristics at the time of VC financing. Appendix B contains a detailed description of the matching process as well as summary statistics for the matched sample. The final matched sample contains 7,632 VCfinanced and 7,632 non-VC-financed firms which enter the LBD between 1981 and 2001.  \n\n### II1. Which Firms Receive VC Financing?  \n\nHow quantitatively important is VC in new firm creation in our data?  We see that a statement on the quantitative importance of VC in new firm creation depends critically on the measure used. From the point of view of new firm foundings, VC is close to irrelevant. VCfinanced firms are an extremely small percentage of all new firms created in the LBD - averaging $0.1\\%$ over the 20 year sample period 1981 to 2001 and increasing to $0.2\\%$ in the late 1990s. If instead of focusing on the number of firms that get VC backing, we focus on other measures we get a different picture of the importance of VC in new firm creation and in the economy as a whole. Consider the amount of employment generated by VC backed firms. When we measure the amount of employment generated by VC backed firms we find that it accounts for nearly $10\\%$ of employment in the US in the late 1990s and early 2000s, steadily rising from about $5\\%$ in the 1980s.  \n\nThus, casual empiricism suggests that VC finances firms that will rapidly grow and that will eventually become large players in certain industries. What is different about firms that receive VC financing compared to those that do not? How do venture capitalists identify their investments and what do these firms look like when they first get VC? While we have some sense that VC-financed firms are concentrated in certain “high-tech'\" industries from surveys such as Moneytree and aggregate statistics reported by the National Venture Capital Association, it is unclear how the industry composition of newly created firms that receive VC financing compares to the industry composition of newly created firms that do not receive VC financing. Moreover, little is known on how the size and profitability of VC-financed firms compares to that of non-VC-financed at birth, and the time of VC financing, and prior to exit. Thus, we begin our analysis by asking to what market-wide and firm-level characteristics venture capitalists respond in choosing to make their investments and how this differs for firms financed solely by non-VC sources of entrepreneurial capital.  \n\n#### A. VC Financing by Industry  \n\nWe start by asking what industries VC backs relative to other sources of entrepreneurial capital over our 20 year sample period. Table I presents industry counts for all VC- and nonVC-financed firms that enter the LBD created between 1981 and 2001. Industry counts are reported for all firms born between 1981 and 2001 (first panel), for firms that are born between 1995 and 2001 (second panel), and for firms that are born between 1995 and 2001 and have zero cash tax revenues as reported in the SSEL in their first year in the LBD (third panel).  \n\nWe classify firms into nine industry categories that correspond to the industry categories used by VentureXpert to describe VC-financed firms in its database. We map 4-digit SIC codes to these categories by noting the SIC codes assigned by the LBD to VC-financed firms in VentureXpert. If a firm's SIC code does not fall into one of the first eight industry categories it is classified as “Other\"'; thus, all firms in the LBD are categorized and counted in Table I.  \n\nFocusing on the first panel in Table I, we observe that the vast majority of newly created firms are not VC-financed. The overall proportion of newly created firms that are VC-financed across industries is very small - 12,865 VC-financed firms versus 12,196,412 non-VC-financed firms, or less than $0.2\\%$ over our entire sample period. However, if we observe the breakdown by industry category we note that in some industries the proportion of VC-financed firms being created is much higher. In particular, the percentage of VC-financed firms created in the \"Computer\"’, “Electronics” and “Telecom\" industries is well above $1\\%$ , between 10 and 15 times greater than the population average. This breakdown is consistent with the notion that VC disproportionately backs firms in “high-tech” industries.  \n\nHowever, Table I also demonstrates that VC finances a large number of new firms in \"low tech' industries as well, although as a much smaller percentage of the total number of new firms in these industries. Over the 1981-2001 period VC financed 8,055 new firms in the “high tech\" industries of “Computer\", “Biotech/Medical\", “Electronics” and “Telecom” and 5,810 firms in the “low tech\" industries of “Consumer\", “Finance\", “Business\", “Industrial’ and \"Other'. This raises the question of whether VC is looking for similar characteristics in firms it finances in “high tech\" versus “low tech\" industries. The second and third panels of Table I are able to shed light on one dimension of this question. The second panel of Table I reports industry counts for VC- and non-VC-financed firms created between 1995 and 2001. The third panel reports industry counts for firms created during this time that have zero cash revenues as reported on their tax returns. This data is taken from the SSEL as described in Section II.B. $47\\%$ of VC-financed firms created between 1995 and 2001 had zero cash revenues in their first yearversus $6.7\\%$ of non-VC-financed firms. We obtain these percentages by dividing the number of firms with zero tax return revenues in their first year by the number of firms with nonmissing tax return revenues, i.e. (2,615/5,559) in the first case and (195,677/2,928,035) in the secondcase.  \n\nVC disproportionately finances firms that are created without having any commercial revenues. When we compute the percentage of new VC-financed firms that have zero commercial revenues in their first year by industry, we notice that even in the “low tech\" industries, the percentage of new VC-financed firms that have zero commercial revenues in their first year remains high, at between 30 and $40\\%$ of firms. The percentage of “\"high tech”’ new VCfinanced with zero commercial revenues in their first year is slightly higher at between $40\\%$ and $56\\%$  \n\nTable I suggests that a large percentage of the firms venture capitalists back develop new products without any initial sales prospects, even in “low tech' industries.' Thus, the kinds of firms  VC finances share an important similar characteristic across industries along this dimension.  We will later explore whether these sorts of firms that VC disproportionately finances have as a result higher growth and failure rates.  \n\n#### B. VC Financing and Public Market Signals  \n\nMany have argued that VC and investment banks fuelled a disproportionate number of new firms in sectors with “hot? IPO and public equity market opportunities, in the hope of early cashing out. To examine this question, we regress the natural logarithm of new firms created in each of the 189 industry-years in our 21-year sample period of 1981 to 2001 of the LBD on the natural log of each of three public equity market signals in each industry lagged by one year. In each OLS regression we include year and industry fixed effects and cluster standard errors by industry-year. Our three public market signal measures are the natural log of IPOs in each industry-year, the weighted average of Tobin's Q in each of the industry-years, and total equity market capitalization in each of the industry-years.  \n\nThe first three columns in Panel A of Table I report the estimated coefficients and tstatistics for OLS regressions of log new firms created in an industry-year on the three lagged public market signal variables.  The first three columns of Table II Panel B report OLS coefficients and t-statistics for regressions of the log of new firm employment in an industry-year on the three public market signal variables. In each OLS regression we include year and industry fixed effects and cluster standard errors by industry-year. In each specification the public market signal variable positively and significantly predicts new firm creation, both equal and employment-weighted, in an industry-year. To give a sense of the economic magnitudes of the regressions, measuring from sample means a one standard deviation in each of the public market signal variables leads to an increase in the number of new firms created in an industry-year by between one thousand, in the case of IPOs, and three thousand, in the case of Tobin's $\\mathsf Q$ and market capitalization signals.  \n\nThese regressions tell us that new firm creation and employment responds to public equity market signals of investment opportunity. But is VC disproportionately fueling this response? To examine this question, we estimate regressions of the log odds ratio of VC-financed to nonVC-financed new firms (both equal- and employment-weighted) created in each of the 189 industry-years as a function of the three lagged public market signal variables. The last three columns of Panels A and B in Table II report the estimated OLS coefficients and t-statistics. We see that the log odds ratio of VC- to non-VC-financed new firms does not significantly change in response to Tobin's Q or total market capitalization within industry-years. There is a positive marginally significant response to IPO activity when considering equal-weighted new firm creation in an industry, but the economic magnitude is small. For a one standard deviation in the  \n\nIPO signal variable, the percentage of new firms created in response that are VC-financed rises by O.02 percentage points at the sample mean. Thus, even when using IPOs as the signal of investment opportunity, the most profitable exit option for VC, the percentage of newly created firms that are VC-financed remains fairly stable in response to public equity market signals of investment opportunity.  \n\nVCs do not appear to be disproportionately financing new firm creation and employment in response to public equity market signals of investment opportunity.\\* The results presented here do not support the popular view that VCs are the primary drivers of new firm creation in sectors where large IPO activity occurs. Rather our results suggest both entrepreneurs and venture capitalists respond to public market signals of investment opportunity in a similar fashion. However, as we will see in Section IV, VC appears to be better able to invest in new firms that grow to a state critical for an exit in the public markets relative to non-VC sources of new firm capital.  \n\n#### C. VC Financing and Firm Size  \n\nWe have seen that VC tends to focus on high-tech industries, and firms born without any commercial sales in all industries. Does VC appear to have scale, actual or potential, criteria for the firms in which it invests? Is it the case that VC-financed firms grow larger relative to nonVC-financed firms on average? If so, for what measures of size is this true, e.g., employment, sales, or profitability?  And at what age is this true?  \n\n#### C.1. Comparing All VC- and non-VC-financed Firms  \n\nFigures la and 1b depict the average employment and sales by firm age for all VC- and non-VC-financed firms in the LBD born between 1981 and 2001. The sales variable depicted in Figure 1b is the sales variable from the Economic Censuses of Services, Wholesale and Retail Trade and the LRD. In the remaining analysis we choose to use this measure of firm sales, rather than SSEL tax return revenues, because we can observe this measure of sales over our entire sample period.  \n\nThe first fact that emerges from Figures 1a and 1b is that VC-financed firms are larger than non-VC-financed firms, measured by both employment and sales, at each age of the lifecycle prior to first exit. Second, the size difference between VC- and non-VC-financed firms becomes larger with firm age, i.e. the average growth rate of VC-financed firms is larger. Figures la and 1b suggest that actual or potential scale of investment in employment and sales is an important criterion in how venture capitalists choose which firms to finance. VCs invest in companies that grow faster both in terms of employment and sales relative relative to non-VC-financed firms. Once VC-financed firms reach a certain size, they exit, leaving smaller VC-financed firms behind. Non-VC-financed firms, on the other hand, remain relatively small on average, only growing gradually over the lifecycle.  \n\n#### C.2. Comparing Matched VC- and non-VC-financed Firms  \n\nFigures 2a and 2b plot average firm employment and sales in “match time\", or years relative to matching for the sample of matched VC-financed and non-VC-financed firms. Recall that each non-VC-financed firm is matched to a VC-financed firm in the year the VC-financed firm first receives VC. We see that prior to VC financing, VC-financed and non-VC-financed firms have similar employment and sales levels. By construction of the matching process their employment levels are very similar at time zero, the point of matching. For firms that are matched at ages greater than one, and whose averages make up the negative match time portion of Figures 2a and 2b, we see that in fact the non-VC-financed firms have slightly larger employment and sales levels prior to matching. VC-financed firms grow slightly faster than non-VC-financed firms in terms of employment prior to receiving VC financing. This suggests that VCs are looking for evidence of prior growth in the firms they back, at least in terms of employment, though the growth is small with an increase in about 4 employees in the years prior to receiving VC financing.  \n\nAfter VC financing, we see very rapid growth in the employment of VC-financed firms relative to non-VC-financed firms. While VC-financed and non-VC-financed firms are matched at an average of 20 employees each, five years later VC-financed firms have on average just under 70 employees, while non-VC-financed firms have grown to only grown to just under 30 employees. Beyond five years after matching, or receiving VC financing in the case of VCfinanced firms, we see greater employment growth by VC-financed firms relative to non-VCfinanced firms, but the growth slows dramatically relative to the growth seen in the first five years after VC financing first occurs. In the first several years after matching, VC-financed firms and non-VC-financed firms both experience increases in sales, but sales growth is greater for VC-financed firms. As we also saw in Figure 1b, the growth rate in VC-financed firm sales slows and at some points declines later on in the lifecycle as VC-financed firms exit via acquisition, IPO and failure. Non-VC-financed firms do not “catch up” to VC-financed firms in these later years. Non-VC-financed firms also continue to grow on average, but a much slower rate than the VC-financed firms even in this later point in their lifecycles.  \n\nFigure 2c plots a measure of profitability, (Sales-Payroll)/Sales, for VC- and non-VCfinanced firms in match time. Since we only have operating costs for manufacturing firms, we use payroll as our measure of cost and track our proxy for profitability over time. We see that prior to matching VC-financed exhibit slightly lower profitability then non-VC-financed firms, 0.60 versus 0.63 on average. After matching, and after the VC-financed firms first receive VC, the difference in profitability increases dramatically. It dips to 0.51 for VC-financed firms in the first several years after receiving VC, while for non-VC-financed firms the profitability margin still hovers between 0.62 and 0.65. This suggests that in addition to hiring more employees in the initial years after receiving VC, these employees are paid higher wages relative to the increase in sales for VC-financed firms that we observe in Figure 2b.  \n\nFigure 2c buttresses the claim that VCs invest heavily in employment, not only via larger numbers of employees but also via higher wages, in the first several years after investing in a firm. As firms age and exit, VC-financed firms’ profitability comes into line with that of nonVC-financed firms, but VC-financed firms are never on average more profitable than non-VCfinanced firms. Figure 2c indicates that on average VC-backed firms are larger but no more profitable than non-VC-financed firms prior to their being exited by the venture capitalists. Moreover, it suggests that VC looks to invest in firms that invest heavily in both number of employees and wages relative to sales growth in the initial years of the investment.  \n\nWe now more rigorously analyze the size differences between the matched VC- and onVC-financed firms in a regression framework. We regress our firm size and profitability measures on a dummy variable, VC, which equals one for VC-financed firms as well as two time variables, TimefromMatch, which measures how far a firm is in years from being matched to its ex-ante observationally equivalent counterpart, and TimefromVC, which measures how far a VC-financed firm is in years from first receiving VC financing. TimefromVC is formed by multiplying the VC dummy variable by TimefromMatch. We run OLS panel regressions on the VC dummy and time variables, as well as the squares of the time variables to capture nonlinearities in the relation between firm size and time. In each regression we also include year fixed effects, industry fixed effects, and control for the age at which firms were matched to each Other.  \n\nTable IMlI reports coefficients and t-statistics, corrected for clustering by firm, for OLS size and profitability regressions in our panel of matched VC- and non-VC-financed firms. The top panel reports estimates for the entire LBD. The bottom panel reports estimates for the LRD for manufacturing firms for which we have more detailed cost data. We focus first on the LBD estimates in the top panel. The first three specifications regress the natural log of employment and sales as well as our payroll profitability measure on just the VC dummy variable and TimefromMatch and TimefromMatch $\\wedge_{2}$ .We see that VC-financed firms are on average larger, both in terms of employment and sales, and less profitable than non-VC-financed firms while VCs are involved with these firms as evidenced by the strongly significant coefficients on the VC dummy variable. The coefficients on the TimefromMatch variable indicate that firms in our matched sample grow over time and become slightly less profitable before an exit event, though these growth rates slow given the coefficients of opposite sign on TimefromMatch^2.?  \n\nThe last three specifications in the top panel of Table Il allow us to see whether the growth pattern in employment, sales and profitability differs for VC-financed firms. We find that VC-financed firms grow more quickly in terms of both employment and sales after VCs invest in them relative to their matched non-VC-financed counterparts, as evidenced by the positive and significant coefficients on TimefromVC in the first two regressions. However, the growth rates in size for VC-financed firms also level off more rapidly in later years, perhaps as VCs exit their successful investments more rapidly, as evidenced by the negative and significant coefficients on Timefrom $\\mathrm{VC}^{\\wedge}2$ . Finally, the profitability regression indicates that VC-financed firms are less profitable than non-VC-financed firms initially but begin to catch up, as evidenced by the positive and significant coefficient on Timefrom $\\mathrm{{NC}}^{\\wedge}2$ , although the magnitudes of the coefficients indicate that it would take VC-financed firms over ten years to eventually become more profitable than their non-VC-financed counterparts.  \n\nThe bottom panel of Table II repeats the regression analysis on the LRD, the subsample of manufacturing firms for which we have more detailed cost information. Instead of regressing (Sales-Payroll)/Sales on our control variables, we use Return on Sales (ROS) as our dependent variable. We calculate ROS by subtracting operating costs and capital expenditures from sales and divide this number by sales. In general the regression estimates for the LRD are similar to those for the entire LBD in Table II.  \n\nThe estimates in Table Il show that the patterns in employment, sales and profitability between VC- and non-VC-financed we observed in Figures 2a, 2b and 2c hold in a regression framework. Prior to VC financing VC-financed firms have similar employment and sales sizes to non-VC-financed firms, but grow much more rapidly after VCs invest, especially in the first several years, before seeing a leveling off of growth. VC-financed firms are also on average less profitable than non-VC-financed firms and do not become more profitable prior to exit years after a VC first invests in them prior to exit. Thus, a key difference between VC-financed and non-VC-financed firms that emerges from our analysis is firm scale. Larger firm scale rather than higher profitability seems to be an important criterion for VC-financed firms to achieve prior to exit.  \n\n### IV. VC Financing and Firm Exit  \n\nWe have seen that VC-financed firms change enormously relative to non-VC-financed firms in terms of size after venture capitalists come on board. However, it is unclear to what extent these differences emerge because all VC-financed firms grow more quickly or because venture capitalists exit smaller firms more quickly relative to non-VC investors. One characterization of venture capitalists often found in anecdotal evidence is that they encourage the development of the one or two very high growth firms in their portfolio, i.e., the potential  \n\nEBays and Googles, and care little about the rest of their portfolio. Some argue that venture capitalists are quick to shut down companies; others suggest that venture capital is patient money and venture capitalists recognize the option value in their investments and exert effort to ensure companies do not close down. Exit outcomes, particularly when the outcome is firm failure, is arguably one of the least understood aspects of VC behavior towards companies, worthy of further investigation.  \n\nOne way to assess whether the size differences between VC- and non-VC-financed firms is being driven by differences in their exit rates is to examine the standard deviations of the size variables over time. If venture capitalists are shutting down their smaller firms sooner to push the growth of their larger firms, we should expect to see a decline in the variability of VCfinanced firm size as firms age.  Table IV presents averages and standard deviations for employment, sales and our payroll profitability measure for VC- and non-VC-financed firms in the matched sample. The averages are those depicted in Figures 2a to 2c. We see that, in fact, the standard deviations of employment and sales increase for VC-financed firms, especially in the first five years after receiving VC financing, and the standard deviations of non-VC-financed firms actually decrease. However, after five years, both the growth and standard deviations of VC-financed firms level off, while non-VC-financed firms continue on a relatively more stable path. This suggests that, at least initially, venture capitalists do not exit their smaller firms in the interest of growing their more successful firms.  \n\n#### A. Cumulative Exit Rates  \n\nWe analyze more directly whether VC-financed firms have different exit rates than nonVC-financed firms, both in terms of successful exits, IPOs and acquisitions, and failures. We examine the cumulative exit rates in both the entire LBD and in our matched sample of VC- and non-VC financed firms.  \n\nTable $\\mathrm{V}$ presents cumulative exit rates for all VC- and non-VC-financed firms that enter the LBD between 1981 and 2001. We calculate the total percentage of firms in a particular cohort that have exited the LBD, via failure, acquisition or IPO, after a particular number of years. For example, $17.6\\%$ of non-VC-financed firms fail after one year and $31.7\\%$ fail after one or two years. Thus, the percentage of non-VC-financed firms that failed after two years, but not after one year was 31.7 minus 17.6 or $14.1\\%$ . A main fact that emerges from Table $\\mathrm{V}$ is that there are enormous differences in the failure rates between VC- and non-VC-financed firms. The cumulative failure rate of non-VC-financed firms by the end of year five is $51\\%$ ,and for VC-financed firms it is only $19\\%$ .After year five, the difference in the marginal failure rate between VC-financed and non-VC-financed firms declines dramatically; for each successive year the probability of exiting, conditional on surviving to age five is about the same for both VC- and non-VC-financed firms and continues to decline as firms age. This suggests that VCs make the biggest difference in the early years of firms? lifecycles or at least select firms that are much less likely to fail early on.  \n\nTurning to the cumulative acquisition and IPO exit rates for all firms in the LBD in Table V, we see that VC-financed are much more likely to be acquired and go public relative to nonVC-financed firms. The biggest differences emerge in the first six or seven years of a firm's life and then lessen over time. The cumulative acquisition and IPO exit rates for non-VC-financed firms grows more steadily over time. This suggests that VCs actively promote or select their companies to exit via these two most profitable exit routes earlier, by perhaps growing them more rapidly earlier on in the lifecycle.  \n\nIn Table VI we report the cumulative exit rates of firms in our matched sample. We see that VC-financed firms are once again less likely to fail and more likely to be acquired and to go public than non-VC-financed firms. Five years after matching, about $22\\%$ of non-VC-financed firms have failed, whereas about $30\\%$ of non-VC-financed firms have failed. $3.6\\%$ of VCfinanced firms have been acquired and $8\\%$ have gone public. Only $1.3\\%$ of non-VC-financed firms have been acquired, and the percentage going public is too small to disclose. Thus, slightly more VC-financed firms have exited the matched sample at five years, though fewer have done so by failing. Ten years after matching, an additional $5\\%$ of both VC- and non-VC-financed firms have failed. However, since more VC-financed firms have exited via IPO and acquisition, the marginal probability of failure, conditional on not exiting in years 6 to 10 is actually higher for VC-financed firms. Due to much greater failure rates of non-VC-financed firms in the first five years after matching, the cumulative failure rate between VC- is still significantly less than non-VC-financed firms ten years after matching.10  \n\nTables V and VI demonstrate that VC financing is strongly associated with a lower cumulative probability of firm failure. Thus, the larger VC-financed firm sizes relative to nonVC-financed firms we observed in Section Il.C are not being driven by higher failure rates of VC-financed firms relative to non-VC-financed firms. Rather, VC-financed firms on average dominate non-VC-financed firms both in terms of having higher growth rates and lower failure rates even in our matched sample.  \n\nWe next examine a number of more nuanced hypotheses relating to VC-financed firm failure.  \n\n#### B. Timing of Exit Outcomes  \n\nWe have seen that even in our matched sample of firms, VC-financed firms are less likely to fail, cumulatively, than non-VC-financed firms. However, it appears the story is a bit more nuanced. In our matched sample, after five years the failure rate of VC-financed firms increases relative to that of surviving non-VC-financed firms. We first ask whether the time to failure is significantly different for VC- and non-VC backed firms. Is VC patient money or are they quick to shut down so that they can focus on the “stars\"’ of their portfolio? In this section we examine the timing of firm failures in our matched sample of VC- and non-VC-financed firms.  \n\nSince each firm in our sample can experience only one exit event, we model firm exit in a multinomial logit model in which the excluded outcome is no exit.  We report estimated coefficients, z statistics corrected for clustering by firm in parentheses, followed by marginal probabilities calculated at sample means in brackets, for two multinomial logit specifications in Table VI1. In the first specification we model firm exit as a function of a VC dummy, time from matching, as well as age at which firms were matched and industry and year fixed effects. In the second specification, we also control for time from first receiving VC financing for the set of VC-financed firms to be able to distinguish differences in the dynamics of firm exit between VCand non-VC-financed firms.  \n\nThe exit patterns we observed in Table VI are born out in the multinomial logit models. Focusing on the first model, we see that VC-financed firms are much more likely to be acquired and to go public and are less likely to fail than non-VC-financed firms. On average, VCfinanced firms are 0.7 percentage points more like to be acquired, 1.4 percentage points more likely to go public and 1.2 percentages less likely to fail in a given year.  \n\nIn the second model, we see that when we control for differences in the exit dynamics between VC- and non-VC-financed firms the marginal probability of being acquired increases by 0.1 percentage points for each year that a firm has VC-financing, from a base starting point advantage of 0.3 percentage points, relative to non-VC-financed firms. Likewise, the marginal probability of going public increases by 0.2 percentage points for each year a firm has VC financing, from a base starting advantage of 0.5 percentage points, relative to non-VC-financed firms. However, when it comes to failure, the story is more nuanced. After initially receiving VC financing, VC-financed are less likely to fail by 6.8 percentage points in the first year. However, for each year that the VC-financed firm ages, its marginal probability of failure increases by 1.7 percentage minus 0.1 percentage point times the square of the number of years after VC financing. Up until five years after receiving VC financing, the probability of failing is lower for Thus, at five years after first receiving VC financing, the marginal probability becomes greater relative to non-VC-financed firms. In each additional year, the marginal probability of failure increases for VC-financed firms relative to non-VC-financed firms.  \n\nThe estimates in Table VII provide robust evidence that VC is “patient” money in the early part of firms’ lifecycles. In the first five years after receiving VC, VC-financed firms are given a chance to grow while venture capitalists rapidly grow the firms in terms of employment and sales relative to non-VC-financed firms. However, after this initial growth period, VCfinanced firms have a higher mortality rate, as well as exit rate via acquisition and IPO, relative to non-VC-financed firms. While VC is initially patient (i.e., for about five years), its patience fades in the later years of the investment, perhaps after the venture capitalists have had a chance to observe whether their initial investments will bear fruit. This nuanced finding on the relative failure dynamics of VC- and non-VC-financed firms is consistent with the results we saw on firm size and profitability in Section II.C. Venture capitalists invest heavily in firm employment and payroll in the first five years after investing. This is the period over which we see the most rapid growth in VC-financed firms relative to non-VC-financed firms. After five years, when VC-financed firms failure rates as well as acquisition and IPO rates are higher relative to nonVC-financed firms, the growth of VC-financed firms slows relative to surviving non-VCfinanced firms, which continue to grow steadily and slowly.  \n\nBefore moving to our next hypothesis on VC-financed firm failure, we perform a robustness check to the multinomial logit analysis in Table Vl. VentureXpert classifies about  \n\n30 percent of the VC-financed firms in the LBD that fail in the LBD according to our definitions as having been acquired. These firms exit the LBD which means they cease to operate in any of their old locations; however VentureXpert lists these firms as having been acquired. It is likely that just the assets of these VC-financed firms are acquired rather than the employees of these firms becoming part of an existing firm, which explains why the firms’ business establishments disappear from the LBD. In the analysis in Table Vll, we choose to classify these firms as failures, because even if the assets are being sold to another firm, the VC-financed firms ceases to operate in its old form. However, as a robustness check we re-classify these VC-financed firms as acquisitions instead of failures and re-estimate our multinomial logits. We find that VCfinanced firms are still less likely to fail than non-VC-financed firms five years after receiving VC financing and are more likely to fail six years and later after VC financing.  \n\n#### C. Do VCs Have Different Thresholds for Failure?  \n\nVC-financed firms are initially more likely to survive, but then have higher shut down rates relative to non-VC-financed firms over time. A related question is whether the threshold for firm survival is more stringent for VC-financed firms. Do venture capitalists simply wait to see if there is option value to be realized but then when they do shut down firms, have a more stringent criterion for what it means to be a successful surviving firm relative to investors in non-VCfinanced firms?  \n\nWe next examine whether VC-financed firms look different than non-VC-financed firms at failure. We report average employment, sales and profitability of firms in the year they fail in the top panel of Table VIll. The first row in the top panel reports these numbers for the entire LBD. The second row reports averages for only the manufacturing firms in the LRD.  \n\nWe see that VC-financed firms are on average larger than non-VC-financed firms when they fail, both in terms of employment and sales. However, they are not any more profitable. In fact, using the payroll profitability measure in the larger sample of LBD firms, we see that VCfinanced firms are marginally less profitable than non-VC-financed firms at failure. Thus, VCs do not appear to have higher survival thresholds in terms of profitability relative to investors in non-VC-financed firms. Rather, consistent with the size and profitability results we reported earlier, VCs seem to grow all of their portfolio companies to a certain minimum level before deciding to shut down them down. This shut down decision does not seem to be based on observable profitability but rather on scale, or perhaps some other unobservable variable. The results in Table VIlI suggest that rather than having more stringent requirements for shutdown in terms of size or profitability, it seems that VC-financed firms have been allowed to grow more and receive more investment before ultimately shutting down relative to non- VC-financed firms.  \n\n#### D. Are VC- financed Firm Failures Disguised as Acquisitions?  \n\nAn alternate explanation for our results is that the lower failure rates for VC-financed firms reflects the fact that some failures are disguised as acquisitions or IPOs. However, it may also be the case that both VC- and non-VC-financed firms have to meet minimum eligibility criteria before other corporations or public investors will buy their equity. To shed light on these alternative hypotheses, we compare average size and profitability of VC- and non-VC-financed firms at acquisition and IPO in the last two panels of Table VIfI.  \n\nThere is no significant difference in the size and profitability of VC- and non-VCfinanced firms at acquisition or IPO. This finding is also robust to the alternative definition of VC-financed firm acquisition explored in Section IV.A. Thus, it does not appear that venture capitalists are disguising failures as acquisitions and that the lower overall failure rates for VCfinanced firms truly reflects a difference in failure rates between VC-financed and non-VCfinanced firms. Moreover, it seems that VC-financed firms are not on average able to take firms public or sell them to other firms without meeting size and profitability standards that non-VCfinanced firms must also meet.  \n\n#### E. Are Exit Patterns of VC-financed Firms Driven by Certain Kinds of VCs?  \n\nAnother possible explanation for our results is that the relation between VC financing, failures, firm size and profitability and overall firm exit dynamics is driven by certain kinds of VC, say high (low) reputed VC. A literature has developed that explores the impact of different types of VCs on investment outcomes (e.g., Botazzi, Hellmann and da Rin (2007), Gompers (1996), Sorensen (2007） and Zarutskie (2008)) independent of the prior literature which documents that venture capitalists behave in ways consistent with principal-agent theories when dealing with their portfolio companies (e.g., Lerner (1995) and Kaplan and Stromberg (2004, 2003). Hence understanding whether the relation between VC financing, firm scale and exits (both successes and failures) differ significantly for high and low reputed VCs is an interesting question in its own right.  \n\nWe create a measure for \\*\"high reputation” VC firms as those that are in the top quartile of the age distribution of VC firms in VentureXpert. There is evidence that older VCs and those that have more experience doing deals generally have higher returns. We thus use age as our measure of the reputation of a VC firm's quality to its investors.11  \n\nFor each VC-financed firm in the LBD, we calculate the maximum age of the VC firms investing in the companies in their first round of VC financing. If the oldest VC firm which invests in the company's first round is in the upper quartile of the VC firm age distribution, at the time it invests in the company, then the VC-financed firm is labeled as having a high reputation VC firm as an investor. A dummy variable, HighRepVC, is set equal one for these VC-financed firms and set equal to zero for all other VC-financed firms.  \n\nWe re-estimate our firm size, profitability and exit multinomial logit models with the addition of the HighRepVC variable. Table IX reports the firm size and profitability regressions, which are analogous to those in the top panel of Table Ill. In the first three specifications, we add the HighRepVC dummy in addition to the VC dummy. In the last three specifications of Table IX, we also interact the HighRepVC dummy with our TimefromVC variables to examine whether having a high reputation VC firm as an investor affect the growth pattern of VCfinanced firms. We see that having a high reputation VC as an investor is correlated with larger VC-financed firm size, both in terms of employment and sales, and lower profitability. VCfinanced firms with high reputation investors having larger employment almost immediately relative to other VC-financed firms. However, VC-financed firms with high reputation investors do not initially exhibit higher levels of sales, but they do so eventually as the years progress from their first receiving VC financing. Further, the lower average profitability of VC-financed firms with high reputation investors increases over time, as is evidenced by the positive coefficient on the TimefromVC\\*HighRepVC variable in the final profitability regression. Table IX suggests that high reputation VCs make somewhat different kinds of investments relative to the average VC firm. Relative to other VC firms, VC-financed firms financed by high reputation VCs are even larger and even less profitable than the average VC-financed firm.  However, the basic patterns of VC- versus non-VC financed firms, that VC firms care about scale and make investments that are generally larger and less profitable than non-VC-financed firms is true in general for the average VC firm, and is not driven simply by high (low) reputed VC-financed firms.  \n\nIn Table X we examine whether the exit dynamics of VC-financed firms with high reputation investors differ from the average VC-financed firm. The first multinomial logit model adds the HighRepVC dummy alongside the VC dummy. We see that VC-financed firms with high reputation investors do not have statistically different average failure or acquisition rates, but that they do have higher IPO rates. This is consistent with the notion that high reputation VCs earn higher returns by investing in companies that are more likely to go public, the most profitable exit route over our sample period.  \n\nWhen  we  allow  for differences  in  the  exit  dynamics  by including  the TimefromVC\\*HighRepVC and TimefromVC^2\\*HighRepVC variables in the second model of Table X, a more nuanced picture emerges. We see that VC-financed firms backed by high reputation VC firms have slightly different failure dynamics, although their average probability of failure relative to the average VC-financed firms is no different. Both high and low reputed VC-financed firms display similar patterns relative to non-VC financed firms.  \n\nIn particular, the statistically negative coefficient on HighRepVC indicates that high reputation VC financed firms are initially, during the VC “patient’ period, 2.4 percentage points less likely to fail relative to other VC-financed firms. However, the significant positive coefficient on TimefromVC\\*HighRepVC and the resulting marginal probability allow us to calculate that the “patient’ period for high reputation VC firms is shorter that for the average VC-financed firms. After four years, rather than the VC-financed firm average of five, the marginal probability of failure for VC-financed firms with high reputation investors turns from negative to positive relative to non-VC-financed firms. VC-financed firms with high reputation investors have on average similar probabilities of failure, but there are slight differences in the dynamics of the failures.  \n\nThe estimates in Table X suggest another way in which high reputation VC firms may earn higher returns for their investors besides investing in firms that are more likely to go public.2 In particular, high reputation VC firms seem to wait a shorter period of time before recognizing their failed investments. The saved opportunity cost of this invested capital could also contribute to high reputation VC firms’ higher returns.  \n\nIn Table XI, we examine whether VC-financed firms with high reputation investors look on average different from other VC-financed firms at failure. We find that they do not look significantly different in terms of sales and profitability, though they do have slightly more employees. This suggests that high reputation VCs are making similar shut down decisions as other VC firms, however, they able to do so faster by perhaps investing more quickly in the companies they back.  Importantly, both low reputed and high reputed VCs differ in the same way from non-VC financed firms. This suggests that the basic patterns of VC- versus non-VC financed firms we have uncovered in the previous sections are not being driven by certain kinds of venture capitalists, in particular, by high (low) reputed VC firms.  \n\n## V. Conclusion  \n\nThis paper is the first to our knowledge that uses a panel data set of the universe of employer firms in the U.S. over two decades in conjunction with other government and proprietary data sources to empirically examine the lifecycle dynamics of VC-financed and nonVC-financed firms. Using the universe of firms across different industries and geographic areas as well as a matched sample of VC- and non-VC-financed firms, we explore differences in VC and non-VC-financed firms in order address some important questions. Specifically, we ask to what firm-level and market-wide characteristics venture capitalists respond in making their investments. On the firm level, we find that venture capitalists disproportionately invest in firms that have no commercial sales, but which exhibit high levels of initial investment. Further, VCfinanced firms are larger than non-VC-financed firms, as measured by employment and sales at every point along the lifecycle, suggesting that scale of investment and production is an important criterion in VC financing. In our matched sample of firms, we observe that after receiving VC, VC-financed firms exhibit larger levels of investment in employment relative to the matched non-VC-financed firms. VC-financed firms also exhibit larger levels of sales but their expenditures increase correspondingly so that VC-financed firms are no more profitable than the non-VC-financed firms before they are exited. These results speak to the importance of scale in VC financing and also suggest VC is ‘patient money.  \n\nTo examine this conjecture more closely, we analyze the exit dynamics of VC- and nonVC-financed firms. We find that the cumulative failure rates, as well as the cumulative IPO and acquisition rates, of VC-financed firms are greater than that of non-VC-financed firms in both the full sample and the matched sample. However, the failure dynamics of VC-financed firms in the matched sample are nuanced - VC is patient in the first five years with lower rates of failure rates, but the longer term probability of failure is higher. We do not find evidence that these results are being driven by VC failures being disguised as acquisitions or different thresholds for failure of VC and non-VC financed firms. Nor do we find that different types of VC firms are driving the results.  \n\nOur analysis of a large panel data set that contains both VC- and non-VC-financed firms allows us to distill some fundamental facts on VC financing, how it responds to firm-level and market-level characteristics, and on the exit dynamics of VC-financed firms. These facts can inform both future theoretical and empirical work that attempts to understand further why firms use VC, which firms venture capitalists choose to back, or how venture capitalists influence firms’ outcomes. Overall our findings suggest that a primary role played by VC is to keep firms alive in the early part of their lifecycles and give them a chance to grow and reach the critical thresholds for successful exit. However, this initial period of patience and growth comes with a cost. Conditional on surviving past a certain point in time, VC-financed firms have a higher marginal probability of failure relative to non-VC-financed firms that have survived over the same time.  \n\nOur findings also raise a number of future research questions. For example, while VC appears to have had a positive effect on firms over the past two decades, have the ways that VC helps the performance of firms changed over time? If so, is this due to improved financial contracting or due to other interactive effects of VC?  \n\n### Appendix A: Matching VentureXpert to the Longitudinal Business Database  \n\nThis appendix describes how we match VentureXpert to the LBD in order to identify VCfinanced firms in the LBD. Our matching algorithm begins with the set of firms in the LBD in 2001 and works backwards in time through the LBD for each successive matching attempt. We begin by trying to match our VentureXpert firms to the LBD by using the full company name and address, i.e., name, city, state and zip code. If a firm in VentureXpert matches to multiple firms in the LBD, we use the match which has the smallest difference between the first LBD year and the VentureXpert founding date, or the first VC financing date if VentureXpert does not report the firm's founding date.13 After matching on full name and address from 2001 to 1975, we then match on full name and partial address, i.e., state and zip code only, then state and city only, then state only, again eliminating multiple matches by using the match with the smallest difference between the first LBD year the VentureXpert founding year of first year of VC financing. We then match on partial name, i.e., a substring of the full name of the first N characters, and full address and then partial name and partial address, again eliminating multiple matches by using the match with the smallest difference between the first LBD year and the VentureXpert founding year or first VC financing year.  \n\nOur matching algorithm yields 16,109 matches, for a raw match rate of $16,109/21,702=$ $74\\%$ . Because we do not restrict our sample of VentureXpert companies based on founding year or the date of first VC financing, there are some companies in our VentureXpert extract that likely should not be matched to the LBD if these companies either get acquired or shut down prior to 1975 or do not enter the LBD until after 2001. Because we cannot identify these companies precisely, i.e. because VentureXpert does not always report the company's founding date and does not tell us when these companies begin or stop reporting positive employment or payroll, we can only estimate the number of such companies in our VentureXpert extract. Out of our 5,593 unmatched companies in VentureXpert we estimate that about $25\\%$ were started after 2001. Taking this into account, we have a revised match rate of about $80\\%$ 14  This match rate does not account for firms started prior to 1975 that may have been acquired or shut down before ever entering the LBD. Therefore, our $80\\%$ match rate is a conservative match rate estimate. According to Census Bureau researchers who regularly engage in name and address matching with Census micro-datasets, our $80\\%$ match rate is as high as what other researchers using these datasets have been able to attain, given the propensity for non-standardized spellings of words and occasional misspellings that appear in administrative records data.  \n\n### Appendix B: Creating a Matched Sample of VC- and non-VC-Financed Firms  \n\nThis appendix describes how we create a matched sample of VC- and non-VC-financed firms within the LBD. We match each VC-financed firm in the LBD to a non-VC-financed firm that is in the same 4-digit SIC industry code, is the same age in the year the VC-financed firm first receives VC financing, is in the same geographical location and has the same number of employees at the time of VC financing. We obtain a one-to-one matched sample of 7,632 VCfinanced firms and 7,632 non-VC-financed firms. The number of VC-financed firms in our matched sample is smaller than the total number of VC-financed firms in the LBD reported in Table I for two main reasons. First, some firms obtain VC financing in the year or two before they enter the LBD and some firms obtain VC financing after 2001, when the current version of the LBD ends. For these firms, we are unable to observe their employment in the year of VC financing and cannot match them to non-VC-financed firms based on this criterion. Second, for some VC-financed firms we cannot find an observationally equivalent non-VC-financed firm on all four dimensions - geography, age, industry and employment size. We exclude these nonmatched VC-financed firms from our matched sample.  \n\nWe also form an alternative matched sample of VC- and non-VC-financed which does not restrict use to one-for-one matching. If at least one non-VC-financed firms matches to a VCfinanced firm, and vice versa, we keep all VC- and non-VC-financed firms with the same matching criteria, so that the number of VC-financed firms for a given set of match criteria may be greater or less than the number of non-VC-financed firms with the same match criteria. This leads to an unbalanced number of VC- and non-VC-financed firms in the alternative matched sample. We find that our results are robust to analysis of this alternative matched sample. As reported in Abadie and Imbens (2006), there are tradeoffs to estimating effects with these two different matched samples. We choose to be more conservative and report results using the oneto-one matched sample.  \n\nTable XlI reports the characteristics of the one-to-one matched sample on each of the four matching variables. About half of the sample is matched at age one, and one quarter is matched at age two. The rest are spread out along the age spectrum. Forty percent of the firms are located in California. About twelve percent each are in the New England, Mid Atlantic and South Atlantic census regions, for a total of thirty-six percent located on the east coast.15 The remaining firms are spread out in the interior of the U.s. Looking at employment size, we see that there is a lot more heterogeneity in the sizes of firms at matching than there is in their ages and geographies. The largest percentage, twenty-four, of firms have between eleven and twenty employees at matching. Between fifteen and seventeen percent of firms each fall into employment categories of 2-3, 4-6 and 7-10 at matching. Another eleven percent have between 21 and 30 employees at matching. There is then a tail of firms that have more than 30 employees at matching that trails off as employment numbers rise.  \n\nThus, we have created a sample of VC- and non-VC-financed firms that look the same at the time the VC-financed firms first receive VC in terms of employment, age, industry and geography.  \n\n## References  \n\nAbadie, A. and G.

A firm is classified in the \"Computer\" industry if its primary SIC code is 3570-5379, 5044, 5045, 5734, or 7370-7379. A firm is clasifed in the \"Biotech/Medical\" industry if its primary SIC code is 2830-2839, 3826, 3841-3851, 5047, 5048, 5122, 6324, 7352, 800-8099, or 8730-8739 excluding 8732. A firm is classified in the \"Electronics\" industry if its primary SIC code is 3600-3629, 3643, 3644, 3670-3699, 3825, 5065, or 5063. A firm is classified in the \"Telecom\" industry if its primary SIC code is 3660-3669 or 4810-4899. A firm is classified in the \"Consumer\" industry if its primary SIC code is 2310-2325, 2329, 2331-2342, 2360-2389, 2392, 2510-2519, 2844, 3140-3149, 3630-3639, 3931, 3942, 3944, 3946, 5023, 5064, 5091, 5092, 5094, 5136, 5137, 5139, 5140-5149, 5180, 5181, 5182, 5192, 5194, 5199, 5411, 5421, 5431, 5441, 5451, 5499, 5531, 5610-5699, 5710-5731, 5735, 5736, 5812, 5183, 5910-5963, 5992, 5993, 5994, or 5999. A firm is classified in the \"Finance\" industry if its primary SIC code is 6020-6062, 6090-6099, 6111-6289, 6311, 6321, 6331, 6351, 6361, 6411, 6510-6553, 6712, 6722, 6726, or 6790-6799. A firm is classified in the \"Business\" industry if its primary SIC code is 7310-7349 or 8710-8748. A firm is classified in the \"Industrial\" industry if its primary SIC code is 1311, 1381, 1382, 1389 or in a manufacturing SIC code, 2010-3999, not already used to define the previous seven industries. A firm is claified in the \"Other\" industry if its primary SIC code is not used to define any of the previous eight industries. Industries are selected to correspond to the industrial clasifications given to VC-financed firms by VentureXpert. SIC codes are assigned to these nine industries based on the bserved mapping of VC-financed firms VentureXpert industry classifications to their primary SIC codes in the LBD. VC-financed firms are frms that recive VC financin a some point in time as identified by VentureXpert; thus some VC-financed frms frst eceive VC financing in a year subsequent to their entry in the LBD. Firm-level revenue data from tax returns are available from the Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL) between 1995 and 2001. SSEL tax return data are missing for one third of the non-VC-financed firms and for one quarter of VC-financed firms. The last panel reports the industry composition of firms that enter the LBD between 1995 and 2001 and that reported zero revenues on their tax returns in their first year in the LBD.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>All Firms</td><td>Computer</td><td>Biotech/Medical</td><td>Electronics</td><td>Telecom</td><td>Consumer</td><td>Finance</td><td>Business</td><td>Industrial</td><td>Other</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"9\"></td></tr><tr><td>Firms createdbetween1981-2001</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VC-financed firms non-VC-financedfirms</td><td>12,865 12,196,412</td><td>4,676 287,813</td><td>1,927 701,894</td><td>739 63,064</td><td>713 47,116</td><td>713 2,361,021</td><td>392 883,282</td><td>1,863 805,116</td><td>896 544,133</td><td>1,946 6,523,158</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"9\"></td></tr><tr><td>Firms createdbetween1995-2001</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VC-financedfirms</td><td>7,331 4,329,004</td><td>3,091</td><td>957</td><td>316</td><td>417 21,640</td><td>444</td><td>224 336,984</td><td>1,121</td><td>321</td><td>1,010 2,205,443</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"9\">non-VC-financed firms 164,374</td></tr><tr><td>Firms created between 1995 - 2001 no revenues in first year</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VC-financed firms</td><td>2,615</td><td>1,071</td><td>500</td><td>135</td><td>186</td><td>139</td><td>62</td><td>475</td><td>91</td><td>279</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"9\">(5,559 have non-missingrevenue data)</td></tr><tr><td>non-VC-financedfirms</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>(2,928,035havenon-missingrevenue data)</td><td>195,677</td><td>7,825</td><td>10,422</td><td>968</td><td>1,221</td><td>18,535</td><td>49,969</td><td>13,193</td><td>6,018</td><td>88,868</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"9\"></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThe first three specifications in the top panel regress the natural logarithm of new firms created in an industry-year (in each of the nine industries defined in Table I in each of the 21 years in the sample period (1981-2001)) as a function of a one year lag of a public equity market investment opportunity signal in that industry as well as industry and year fixed effects.

Matched sample firm size and profitability regressions  \n\nThe sample is the matched sample of 7,632 VC-financed and 7,632 non-VC-financed firms described in the Appendix. The sample tracks firms from year of matching to the year of their first exit event, if applicable, via failure, acquisition or IPO. Employment and payroll data are taken from the LBD. Sales data are taken from the 1982, 1987, 1992, and 1997 waves of the Censuses of Services, Retail Trade and Wholesale Trade for firms in the services, retail trade and wholesale trade industries and from the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) for firms in the manufacturing industries. Firm sales (reported in thousands of year 2000 dollars) is rarely equal to zero, but rather equal to a very small positive number, in the Census waves and LRD. Note that the large number of missing firm-years in the Log(Sales) regressions is due to the fact that we only observe sales data in five year intervals, if at all, for all industries except manufacturing industries (SIC 2000-3999). Return on sales (ROS) is income divided by sales; income is defined as sales minus cost of materials minus capital expenditures minus rental payments. Note that the additional variables used to calculate income are only available in the LRD for manufacturing industries (SIC 2000-3999). VC is a dummy variable equal to one for VC-financed firms $(=1$ in all firm-years for VC-financed firms). TimefromVC measures time in years from the point at which a VC-financed firm first receives VC financing. TimefromMatch measures time in years from the point at which VC-financed and non-VC-financed firms are matched to each other. Note that VC-financed firms are matched to non-VC-financed firms in the year they first receive VC financing. The top panel presents OLS regression estimates using the LBD as the base estimation sample. The bottom panel presents OLS regression estimates using the LRD as the base estimation sample. Included in each regression, in addition to the reported variables, are year fixed effects, industry fixed effects (based on the nine industries defined in Table I), and the age at which firms were matched.

Cumulative exit event rates for all VC- and non-VC-financed firms in the LBD  \n\nCumulative exit event rates (reported as percentages) are reported for all VC- and non-VC-financed firms that enter the LBD between 1981 and 2001. VC-financed firms are firms that receive VC financing at some point in time as identified by VentureXpert; thus some VC-financed firms first receive VC financing in a year subsequent to their entry in the LBD. Firm age measures the number of years a firm is in the LBD. A firm is classified as having failed if it disappears from the LBD in its entirety, i.e. all of its establishments are shut down. A firm is classified as having been acquired if it is classified in the LBD as having an ownership change in which it becomes part of another existing firm.

The exit event which occurs first, if applicable, is the exit event assigned to a firm. VC is a dummy variable equal to one for VC-financed firms $(=1$ in all firm-years for the VC-financed firm). Timefrom VC measures time in years from the point at which a VC-financed firm first receives VC financing. TimefromMatch measures time in years from the point at which VC-financed and non-VC-financed firms are matched to each other. Note that VC-financed firms are matched to non-VC-financed firms in the year they first receive VC financing. Included in each multinomial logit are year fixed effects, industry fixed effects (based on the nine industries defined in Table I) and the age at which firms were matched.

Comparing VC- and non-VC-financed firms at exit  \n\nThe sample is the matched sample of 7,632 VC-financed and 7,632 non-VC-financed firms described in the Appendix. Average values one year before an exit event (failure, acquistion and IPO) are reported for VC- and non-VC-financed firms. A firm is classified as having failed if it disappears from the LBD in its entirety, i.e. all of its establishments are shut down. A firm is classified as having been acquired if it is classified in the LBD as having an ownership change in which it becomes part of another existing firm. A firm is classified as having had an IPO if it can be matched to a firm listed as having had an IPO in the SDC Platinum Global New Issues database. The exit event which occurs first, if applicable, is the exit event assigned to a firm. Reported at the bottom of each panel are t-statistics for double-sided differences in the reported means. Employment and payroll data are taken from the LBD. Sales data are taken from the 1982, 1987, 1992, and 1997 waves of the Censuses of Services, Retail Trade and Wholesale Trade for firms in the services, retail trade and wholesale trade industries and from the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) for firms in the manufacturing industries SIC 200-399). Sales data (reported in thousands of year 2000 dollars) is rarely equal to zero, but rather equal to avery small positive number, in the Census waves and LRD. Note that the large number of missing observations in the Sales columns is due to the fact that we only observe sales data in five year intervals, if at all, for all industries except manufacturing (SIC 2000-3999). Return on sales (ROS) is income divided by sales; income is defined as sales minus cost of materials minus capitalexpendiures minus rental payments. Note that the aditional variables used to calculate income are nly availab in the RD formanufacturing industries (SIC 2000-399). \\*\\*\\*, \\*\\*, and \\* indicate statistical significance at the $1\\%$ $5\\%$ and $10\\%$ levels,respectively.  \n\n#### Failures  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>AllIndustries</td><td>Number</td><td>Age at Exit</td><td>Employment</td><td>Number with</td><td>Sales</td><td>(Sales-Payroll)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>at Exit</td><td>Sales Data</td><td>at Exit</td><td>Sales</td></tr><tr><td>VC-financed firms non-VC-financed firms</td><td>2,205 2,909</td><td>5.44 4.78</td><td>32.57 17.16</td><td>264 402</td><td>4,461.37 1,433.60</td><td>0.64 0.70</td></tr><tr><td>t-statistic for VC vs non-VC</td><td></td><td>6.61*</td><td>5.60***</td><td></td><td>6.91***</td><td>-2.83***</td></tr><tr><td>LRD-ManufacturingIndustries</td><td>Number</td><td>Age at Exit</td><td>Employment</td><td>Number with</td><td>Sales</td><td>ROS</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>at Exit</td><td>Sales Data</td><td>at Exit</td><td>at Exit</td></tr><tr><td>VC-financed firms</td><td>83</td><td>5.82</td><td>32.04</td><td>63</td><td>4,758.97</td><td>0.29</td></tr><tr><td>non-VC-financed firms</td><td>103</td><td>5.49</td><td>15.43</td><td>78</td><td>2,213.20</td><td>0.33</td></tr><tr><td>t-statistic</td><td></td><td>0.61</td><td>2.47**</td><td></td><td>2.59**</td><td>-0.67</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"7\">Acquisitions</td></tr><tr><td>AllIndustries</td><td>Number</td><td>Age at Exit</td><td>Employment at Exit</td><td>Number with Sales Data</td><td>Sales at Exit</td><td>(Sales-Payroll) Sales</td></tr><tr><td>VC-financed firms</td><td>377</td><td>5.92</td><td>134.33</td><td>65</td><td>25,309.38</td><td>0.61</td></tr><tr><td>non-VC-financed firms</td><td>100</td><td>5.17</td><td>132.74</td><td>10</td><td>15,098.44</td><td>0.67</td></tr><tr><td>t-statistic</td><td></td><td>1.66*</td><td>0.03</td><td></td><td>0.42</td><td>-0.58</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"7\">IPOs</td></tr><tr><td>AllIndustries</td><td>Number</td><td>Age at Exit</td><td>Employment at Exit</td><td>Number with Sales Data</td><td>Sales at Exit</td><td>(Sales-Payroll) Sales</td></tr><tr><td>VC-financed firms</td><td>744</td><td>5.34</td><td>81.44</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>non-VC-financed firms</td><td>22</td><td>5.45</td><td>120.77</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>t-statistic</td><td></td><td>-0.18</td><td>-1.07</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n#### Table IX.

The sample tracks firms from year of matching to the year of their first exit event, if applicable, via failure, acquisition or IPO. Employment and payroll data are taken from the LBD. Sales data are taken from the 1982, 1987, 1992, and 1997 waves of the Censuses of Services, Retail Trade and Wholesale Trade for firms in the services, retail trade and wholesale trade industries and from the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) for firms in the manufacturing industries (SIC 2000-3999). Sales data (reported inthousands of year 2000 dollars) is rarely equal to zero, but rather equal to a very small positive number, in the Census waves and the LRD. Note that the large number of missing firm-years in the Log(Sales) regressions is due to the fact that we only observe sales data in five year intervals, if at all, for all industries except manufacturing (SIC 2000-3999). VC is a dummy variable equal to one for VC-financed firms $(=1$ in all firm-years for VC-financed firms). HighRepVC is a dummy equal to one for VC-financed firms whose oldest VCs in their first rounds of financing are in the top quartile of the VC age distribution. TimefromVC measures time in years from the point at which a VC-financed firm first receives VC financing. TimefromMatch measures time in years from the point at which VC-financed and non-VC-financed firms are matched to each other. Note that VC-financed firms are matched to non-VC-financed firms in the year they first receive VC financing. Included in each regression, in addition to the reported variables, are year fixed effects, industry fixed effects (based on the nine industries defined in Table I), and the age at which firms were matched.

Comparing high and low reputation VC-financed firms at exit  \n\nThe sample is the matched sample of 7,632 VC-financed and 7,632 non-VC-financed firms described in the Appendix. Average values one year before an exit event (failure, acquistion and IPO) are reported for VC- and non-VC-financed firms. A firm is classified as having failed if it disappears from the LBD in its entirety, i.e. all of its establishments are shut down. A firm is classified as having been acquired if it is classified in the LBD as having an ownership change in which it becomes part of another existing firm. A firm is classified as having had an IPO if it can be matched to a firm listed as having had an IPO in the SDC Platinum Global New Issues database. The exit event which occurs first, if applicable, is the exit event assigned to a firm. Reported at the bottom of each panel are t-statistics for double-sided differences in the reported means. Employment and payroll data are taken from the LBD. Sales data are taken from the 1982, 1987, 1992, and 1997 waves of the Censuses of Services, Retail Trade and Wholesale Trade for firms in the services, retail trade and wholesale trade industries and from the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) for firms in the manufacturing ndustries SI 2000-999). Sales data (reported in thousands of yea 2000 dollars) is rarely qual to zero,but rathr equal toavery mall positiv number, in the Census waves and LRD. Note that the large number of missing observations in the Sales columns is due to the fact that we only observe sales data in five year intervals, if at ll, for all industries except manufacturing (SIC 2000-3999). Return on sales (ROS) is income divided by sales; income is defined as sales minus cost of materials minus capital expenditures minus rental payments. HighRepVC is a dummy equal to one for VC-financed firms whose oldest VCs in their first rounds of financing are in the top quartile of the VC age distribution. LowRepVC is equal to 1-HighRepVC. $^{***}$ , \\*, and \\* indicate statistical significance at the $1\\%$ $5\\%$ and $10\\%$ levels,respectivel!  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"7\">Failures</td></tr><tr><td>AllIndustries</td><td>Number</td><td>Age at Exit</td><td>Employment at Exit</td><td>Number with Sales Data</td><td>Sales at Exit</td><td>(Sales-Payroll) Sales</td></tr><tr><td>LowRepVC</td><td>1,379</td><td>5.65</td><td>28.73</td><td>184</td><td>4,332.41</td><td>0.63</td></tr><tr><td>HighRepVC</td><td>349</td><td>5.30</td><td>56.21</td><td>42</td><td>5,832.02</td><td>0.67</td></tr><tr><td>non-VC-financed firms</td><td>2,909</td><td>4.78</td><td>17.16</td><td>402</td><td>1,433.60</td><td>0.70</td></tr><tr><td>t-statistic for LowRepVC vs HighRepVC</td><td></td><td>1.63</td><td>2.87***</td><td></td><td>-1.05</td><td>-0.79</td></tr><tr><td>t-statistic for LowRepVC vs non-VC-financed</td><td></td><td>-7.39 ***</td><td>-6.08 ***</td><td></td><td>6.45***</td><td>-2.97***</td></tr><tr><td>t-statistic for HighRepVC vs non-VC-financed</td><td></td><td>-2.58**</td><td>-6.55***</td><td></td><td>6.41 ***</td><td>-0.74</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"7\">Acquisitions</td></tr><tr><td>AllIndustries</td><td>Number</td><td>Age at Exit</td><td>Employment</td><td>Number with</td><td>Sales</td><td>(Sales-Payroll)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>at Exit</td><td>Sales Data</td><td>at Exit</td><td>Sales</td></tr><tr><td>LowRepVC HighRepVC</td><td>245</td><td>6.37</td><td>124.65 163.93</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>non-VC-financed firms</td><td>67 100</td><td>4.39 5.17</td><td>132.74</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>t-statistic for LowRepVC vs HighRepVC t-statistic for LowRepVC vs non-VC-financed</td><td></td><td>3.88*** 3.46 ***</td><td>-0.61 -0.18</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>t-statistic for HighRepVC vs non-VC-financed</td><td></td><td>-1.28</td><td>0.36</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"7\">IPOs</td></tr><tr><td>AllIndustries</td><td>Number</td><td>Age at Exit</td><td>Employment at Exit</td><td>Number with Sales Data</td><td>Sales at Exit</td><td>(Sales-Payroll) Sales</td></tr><tr><td>LowRepVC</td><td>428</td><td>5.56</td><td>76.21</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>HighRepVC</td><td>143</td><td>5.19</td><td>116.61</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>non-VC-financed firms</td><td>22</td><td>5.45</td><td>120.77</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>t-statistic for LowRepVC vs HighRepVC</td><td></td><td>1.27</td><td>-2.19 **</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>t-statistic for LowRepVC vs non-VC-financed</td><td></td><td>0.16</td><td>-1.66 *</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>t-statistic for HighRepVC vs non-VC-financed</td><td></td><td>-0.37</td><td>0.06</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n#### Table XIl.

    "reference_markdown": "# On the Life Cycle Dynamics of Venture-Capitaland Non-Venture-Capital-Financed Firms  \n\nMANJU PURI and REBECCA ZARUTSKIE\\*  \n\n## ABSTRACT  \n\nWe use data over 25 years to understand the life cycle dynamics of VC- and non-VCfinanced firms. We find successful and failed VC-financed firms achieve larger scale but are not more profitable at exit than matched non-VC-financed firms. Cumulative failure rates of VC-financed firms are lower, with the difference driven largely by lower failure rates in the initial years after receiving VC. Our results are not driven by VCs disguising failures as acquisitions or by certain types of VCs. The performance difference between VC- and non-VC-financed firms narrows in the post-internet bubble years, but does not disappear.  \n\nTHE VENTURE CAPITAL (VC) industry has grown dramatically over the past 30 years. In 1980 the total amount of money newly invested by venture capitalists in the U.S. was estimated at $\\$610$ million, according to figures published by PricewaterhouseCoopers Moneytree. By 1990 this figure had already increased to $\\$2.3$ billion and in 1998 it reached nearly $\\$20$ billion. While the numbers fell after the boom period of 1999 and 2000, when VC investment peaked at almost $\\$100$ billion, in 2008 the amount invested by venture capitalists was around $\\$28$ billion. Clearly, VC has grown as a significant source of financing for new firms over the past 30 years. Yet many questions about VC as an institution, which type of firms it finances and the life cycle dynamics of VC-financed firms remain. In particular, much of our understanding about VC-financed firms comes from analysis of firms that are successful and survive. We have little understanding of VC-financed firms that fail, as well as the counterfactual—the life cycle dynamics of firms that could potentially use VC but do not.  \n\nPart of the reason that studying these questions is difficult is the scarcity of data on private firms—particularly new non-VC-financed firms. In this paper we use the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), a panel data set collected by the U.S. Census Bureau that tracks firms from their birth over more than two decades, to address a number of questions related to the role of VC in new firms. Since our data allow large sample identification of firms that do and do not receive VC financing, we are able to characterize and quantify differences between VC-financed and non-VC-financed firms in the early part of their life cycles—from birth to exit—and to shed light on some of the outstanding questions on the role of VC in new firm creation.  \n\nWe first ask how prevalent VC is in new firm creation. From the Census data we see that a statement on the prevalence of VC depends on the measure used. From the point of view of new firm foundings, we find that VC is close to irrelevant. VC-financed firms are an extremely small percentage of all new firms created—accounting for $0.11\\%$ over our 25-year sample period from 1981 to 2005 and increasing to $0.22\\%$ over the period 1996-2000. If instead of focusing on the number of firms that get VC backing we focus on employment, we get a different picture of the prevalence of VC in new firm creation and in the economy as a whole. When we measure the amount of employment generated by VC-financed firms, including those that have been exited by their original VC investors, we find that these firms account for between $5.3\\%$ to $7.3\\%$ of employment in the U.S. during the 2001-2005 period, steadily rising from between $2.7\\%$ to $2.8\\%$ in the 1981-1985 period. Hence, when measured by employment, VC and the companies it finances are quantitatively sizable.  \n\nWe examine which kinds of firms receive VC over our sample period. Our results support the notion that VC invests in firms with no immediate revenues. We find that firms started with no commercial revenues are disproportionately financed by VC. This is true in “high-tech\" industries, such as biotech and computers, and in “low-tech\" industries, such as general retail and wholesale trade. In fact, $47\\%$ of new firms in our sample that received VC financing were started without any commercial revenues. In the general population of frms, VC-financed firms are an order of magnitude larger than non-VC-financed frms, as measured by employment and sales. When we examine a sample of VC- and non-VC-financed firms matched on observables at the time the VC-financed frms first receive VC, we also see larger scale after VCs invest. However, we see little difference in measures of profitability between matched VC and non-VC-financed firms before VC-financed firms are exited via acquisition or IPO. These results suggest that the key firm characteristic on which VC focuses is scale or potential for scale, rather than short-term profitability.  \n\nSince the Census data allow us to identify which firms fail, or are shut down, we generate statistics on exit percentages for VC-financed firms that cannot be obtained from the standard data sources on VC-financed firms, such as SDC  \n\nThomson VentureXpert. After the length of a typical VC investment, we find that $39.7\\%$ of VC-financed firms fail, $33.5\\%$ are acquired, and $16.1\\%$ go public. In contrast, $78.9\\%$ of non-VC-financed firms fail, $1.04\\%$ get acquired, and $0.02\\%$ go public.  \n\nWe next examine a number of hypotheses about firm failure to better understand VC behavior towards companies that do not do well. The characteristics and dynamics of failed firms are arguably the least understood aspect of the VC investing process. Most prior studies focus on VC-financed firms that have exited by IPO or acquisition. For example, in a recent paper Kaplan, Sensoy, and Stromberg (2009) examine the dynamics of VC-financed firms that have gone public from birth to IPO. However, their analysis does not include VCfinanced firms that are acquired or that are shut down, nor does it compare VCto non-VC-financed firms. Our sample allows for in-depth examination of new firm failure dynamics since we observe the eventual outcome of all firms in our sample—failure, acquisition, or IPO—and can examine firm characteristics at the time these outcomes occur.  \n\nUsing our matched sample of VC-financed and non-VC-financed firms, we first ask whether the larger scale of VC-financed firms reflects a higher failure rate for firms receiving VC. Second, we ask not only whether there is a difference in the overall probability of firm failure but also whether the timing of failure is different between VC- and non-VC-financed firms. Third, we ask if VC-financed firms have different thresholds for failure from non-VC-financed firms. Fourth, we ask ifVC-financed frm failures are disguised as acquisitions. Fifth, we ask whether the dynamics of VC- and non-VC-financed firms differ in boom and bust periods. Finally, we ask if the patterns for VC-financed firms reflect the behavior of certain kinds of VC, such as high (low) reputed VC, or whether we see these broad patterns across the board.  \n\nIn examining our first question, whether the larger scale of VC-financed firms reflects a higher failure rate for firms receiving VC, we find that the cumulative probability of failure is lower for VC-financed firms both in the larger panel and in our matched sample. Thus, it is not the case that the average differences in size between VC- and non-VC-financed firms over time are driven by higher failure rates for VC-financed firms.  \n\nWe next examine whether the timing of failures differs between VC- and non-VC-financed firms. Historically, many venture capitalists have made very high returns from a few very successful exits, typically through IPOs. Venture capitalists might push their companies hard to grow quickly, deciding relatively rapidly which firms have the best chance of achieving a successful exit and terminating those that do not in the interest of allocating more capital to the likely winners in their portfolios. Or it could be that VCs have a more difficult time judging which firms will be successful in the early stages of investment and equally nurture and invest in all of their firms over a certain period of time. We find that the lower cumulative failure rate of VC-financed firms is driven by a much lower likelihood of failing in the first few years after initially receiving VC. Subsequently, the difference tapers off. These results are consistent with the interpretation that there is a window over which VCs allow firms to continue and grow, but once this period is over VCs are just as likely to shut their firms down.  \n\nIn examining the failure dynamics of VC- and non-VC-financed firms we must also identify which firms get acquired and go public. We use two external data sources to identify acquisitions in our data, the SDC Mergers and Acquisitions (SDC M&A) database and hand searches of news articles obtained from Lexis/Nexis. We find that using Lexis/Nexis news searches to identify acquisitions in the LBD in addition to the SDC M&A database does not have a major impact on the difference in acquisition rates between VC- and non-VC-financed firms, though it does change the overall acquisition rates. Adding the searches increases the set of identified acquisitions for VC-financed firms by $24\\%$ ,from 2,074 to 2,574 acquisitions. This corresponds to an increase in the total acquisition rate from $20.0\\%$ to $24.9\\%$ , out of 10,349 VC-financed firms. The Lexis/Nexis searches increase the set of identified acquisitions for non-VC-financed firms by $32\\%$ , from 446 to 587 acquisitions. This corresponds to an increase in the total acquisition rate from $4.3\\%$ to $5.7\\%$ , out of 10,349 non-VC-financed firms.  \n\nThe third question we ask with regard to failure is ifVC-financed firms have different thresholds for failure from non-VC-financed firms. When VC-financed firms are ultimately shut down do they look significantly different in terms of size or profitability relative to non-VC-financed firms that are shut down? Do venture capitalists terminate firms that other investors would keep alive because of better monitoring or higher VC hurdle rates (e.g., Lerner (1995), Barry et al. (1990), and Landier (2003))? Or do venture capitalists give even their failed firms more opportunities to grow and prove themselves relative to investors in non-VC-financed firms in an attempt to learn which of their investments will be huge successes? We find that, in our matched sample, VCfinanced firms are significantly larger when they fail in terms of employees and sales and are less profitable at the time of failure. These results suggest that venture capitalists invest heavily in all their firms for an initial period until they have a better sense of which ones will be the successes in their portfolios.  \n\nFourth, we ask if VC-financed frm failures are disguised as acquisitions. While we have observed that VC-financed firms have lower cumulative probabilities of failure, it is possible that venture capitalists are able to sell their poor performers to other companies due to VC connections or natural synergies with potential acquirers, whereas non-VC-financed firms simply must shut down. We examine whether VC-financed firms differ significantly from non-VC-financed firms at the time that they are acquired. We find that there is no significant difference in terms of size, as measured by employment or sales, at the time of acquisition. This is also true when we only examine “going concern” acquisitions, acquisitions for which the acquired firm is not subsequently shut down in the following 2 years. Hence, we do not find evidence that VC failures are being camouflaged as acquisitions. We also examine VC- and non-VC-financed firms at the time they go public and find similar results. VCand non-VC-financed firms that go public look similar in terms of size when they do go public. This analysis suggests that the large initial investments in employment by VC in the firms it finances is an attempt to get each firm to the critical scale and position in which it needs to be in order to successfully exit via IPO or acquisition.  \n\nFifth, we ask if VC-financed firms' outcomes differ in the years following the s0-called “internet bubble” of 1998-2000, during which time many firms exited via IPO, when the public equity markets decreased dramatically in value. Is it the case that VC-financed firms overinvested during this period and therefore should perform worse when compared to non-VC-financed firms in the postbubble period? We find that even when we restrict our analysis to VC-financed firms that first received VC during the bubble years of 1998-2000, VC-financed firms still outperform their matched non-VC-financed counterparts in terms of growth in size, higher IPO and acquisition rates, and lower failure rates.  \n\nPrior work by Hsu (2004) suggests that firms are willing to accept worse financing terms in order to be associated with more highly reputed VC firms, and work by Kaplan and Schoar (2005) suggests that some VC firms persistently do better than others in the form of investment returns. Thus, last, but not least, we ask if the patterns for VC-financed firms reflect the behavior of certain kinds of VC, such as high (low) reputed VC, or whether we see these broad patterns across all VCs. We find that the general pattern of failure, acquisition, and IPO that we observe in the overall sample is also observed in the subsamples of both high and low reputed venture capitalists.  \n\nOur work adds to the existing literature on the role that VC plays in the firms it finances. To date, empirical studies in this literature mainly focus on VC-financed firms in isolation (e.g., Barry et al. (1990), Gompers and Lerner (2001), Lerner (1995), Kaplan, Sensoy, and Stromberg (2009), Kaplan and Stromberg (2003, 2004)) or on differences between VC- and non-VCfinanced firms that have had successful outcomes, such as an IPO or acqusition (e.g., Baker and Gompers (1999), Brav and Gompers (1997), Lindsey (2008), Megginson and Weiss (1991)). A few studies examine smaller hand-collected samples of private non-VC-financed and VC-financed firms but are limited to certain geographies, time periods, industries, and firm outcomes (e.g., Baron, Hannan, and Burton (1999) and Hellmann and Puri (2000, 2002)). In a more recent study Chemmanur, Kartik, and Nandy (2009) use Census Bureau data to find that VC-financed firms are more productive than non-VC-financed firms on average and argue that this arises from the screening and monitoring functions of VCs. Their study uses the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD), which allows them to examine firms’ capital and labor inputs in more detail but restricts them to a subsample of older and larger manufacturing firms. Our paper uses the broader-based LBD, which contains the universe of new U.S. employer firms, to understand the dynamics of new VC- and non-VC-financed firms.  \n\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section I describes our data. Section II examines which firms receive VC financing. Section IHI examines differences in the size and exit dynamics of VC- and non-VC-financed firms and explores a number of questions related to firm failure. Section IV concludes.  \n\n## 1. Data  \n\nWe first describe the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), the main panel data set we use to track firms from birth to their first exit event via IPO, acquisition, or shut down. We then describe the other U.S. Census data sets we merge to the LBD to obtain additional information on firm-level sales. We also discuss how we identify VC-financed firms in the data by linking the LBD to VentureSource and VentureXpert, two commonly used commercial data sets on U.S. VC deals. Finally, we describe how we identify IPO and acquisition exits in the data.  \n\n### A. The Longitudinal Business Database  \n\nThe LBD is a panel data set that tracks all U.S. employer business establishments from 1975 to the present.1 The version of the LBD we use ends in 2005. The LBD contains information on employment, payroll, industry, location, and organizational form for each business establishment. We can also observe the years in which an establishment enters and exits the LBD. Since we are interested in understanding the relation between firm-level characteristics and VC financing, we aggregate business establishment-level payroll and employment data for multi-establishment firms using firm-level identifiers. We classify the industry and geography of multi-establishment firms as the modal industry and geography of the firm's business establishments.  \n\nFor most of our analysis, we begin tracking firms from their birth, or year of first entry into the LBD. A business establishment enters the LBD when it has at least one employee who is paid a wage on which U.S. payroll taxes are levied. Hence, for firms that were started after 1975, we observe them from the point in time at which their first business establishment hires its first tax-paying employee.2 We classify a firm's year of birth in the LBD as the year in which its first establishment enters the LBD. Most firms, including VC-financed firms, enter the LBD as single-establishment firms.  \n\n### B. Obtaining Information on Sales  \n\nWe supplement the payroll and employment data in the LBD with sales data from three additional Census data sources—the Economic Censuses, the Longitudinal Research Database, and the Standard Statistical Establishment List.  \n\nThe Economic Censuses of Services, Retail Trade, and Wholesale Trade collect information on the value of goods produced in each business establishment in the services, retail trade, and wholesale trade industries every 5 years, for years ending in 2 and 7. For firms in the manufacturing industries, we obtain information on the value of goods produced in the Economic Census of Manufactures, also collected in years ending 2 and 7, as well as the Annual Survey of Manufactures. The Economic Census of Manufactures combined with the Annual Survey of Manufactures in the non-Census years comprise the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD). Because the Annual Survey of Manufactures oversamples larger firms, using this database for sales data slightly tilts our firms with sales data towards larger and more successful firms. However, this is true for both VC- and non-VC-financed firms, and only relevant for manufacturing firms.  \n\nWe use the Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL) to obtain revenue data reported on the tax returns for a subset of firms in the LBD. The SSEL is a list of business establishments maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau that it uses as the basis for the Economic Census and related surveys. The SSEL contains data from U.S. government administrative records, such as tax returns. Beginning in 1995, the SSEL contains firm-level revenues as reported on firms' tax returns. Tax return revenue data are available for about twothirds of firms in the SSEL. The advantage of the SSEL tax return data is that it gives a measure of actual cash obtained by each firm in a given year, as opposed to an estimate of the value of goods produced as in the Economic Census. The disadvantage, however, is that the data are only available in the last 11 years of our 25-year sample period. Thus, we primarily use the sales data in the Economic Census and the LRD in our empirical analysis.  \n\n### C.Identifying VC-Financed Firms in the LBD  \n\nWe identify firms in the LBD as VC-financed if they can be matched to extracts of VentureSource and VentureXpert, which identify firms that receive their first rounds of VC financing between 1981 and 2005. VentureSource and VentureXpert are proprietary databases maintained and sold by Dow Jones and Thomson Financial and contain information on venture capital investment firms and the companies in which they invest. Both VentureSource and VentureXpert contain information on when rounds of VC financing occur, which VC funds participate in the rounds, and how much financing was received in the rounds. VentureXpert includes both VC and buyout deals, so we only include in our extract any VC-financed firm located in the United States whose first round of financing is classified as “Startup/Seed,” “Early Stage,” “Expansion,\" or “Later Stage.\" We also exclude companies that are missing name or address information in both VentureSource and VentureXpert. We match firms in the union of VentureXpert and VentureSource using name and address matching. Section A of Appendix A contains a detailed description of how we match VentureSource and VentureXpert to the LBD.  \n\n### D.MatchingVC-Financed and Non-VC-Financed Firms in theLBD  \n\nWe also form a one-to-one matched sample of VC- and non-VC-financed firms in the LBD based on firm characteristics at the time VC-financed firms first receive VC. One may ask whether differences between VC- and non-VC-financed firms are due to venture capitalists selecting better firms or whether the nature of VC financing itself and the role venture capitalists play in new firms directly cause the observed differences between VC- and non-VC-financed firms. Hence, our next step is to match each VC-financed firm to a non-VC-financed firm at the time of getting VC funding based on four characteristics, namely, age of the firm, four-digit SIC code, geographical region, and employment size.3 We re-examine the relation between VC financing and firm size and exit for a set of firms that are observationally similar at the time one of them gets VC funding and the other does not. While this does not allow us to completely distinguish selection from causation, it does allow us to make a statement about differences between VC- and non-VC-financed firms that are identical on certain observable characteristics at the time one of the firms receives VC financing.  \n\nSection B of Appendix A contains a description of the matching process as well as summary statistics for the matched sample. The final matched sample contains 10,349 VC-financed and 10,349 non-VC-financed firms that enter the LBD between 1981 and 2005. In Section C of Appendix A, we compare the characteristics of the 10,349 VC-financed firms in the one-to-one matched sample to all other VC-financed firms in VentureSource and VentureXpert. We find that the VC-financed firms in the matched sample are slightly smaller and less likely to have an IPO and are more likely to fail when compared to other VC-financed firms. Thus, it does not appear to be the case that our findings with regard to differences in the size and exit dynamics of VC- and non-VCfinanced firms in the matched sample are biased by examining only successful VC-financed firms.  \n\n### E.Identifying Firm Exits  \n\nFor most of our analysis, we track firms from their year of entry to the year of their first exit event—IPO, acquisition, or shut down—or until 2005 when our data end. We classify a frm as shutting down, or failing, when all of its establishments exit the LBD. The year of failure for the firm will be the year in which the last establishment is shut down. We identify acquisitions in the LBD in several ways. First, we classify a firm as having been acquired if all of its business establishments have been acquired by another firm as identified in the LBD. However, ownership changes in the LBD are tracked primarily in the years in which the Economic Census is taken. Since the Economic Census only occurs every 5 years, some ownership changes may not be recorded if acquired establishments are shut down before the next Economic Census is taken. We therefore also use two external data sources to identify acquisitions in the LBD.  \n\nWe first merge the SDC Platinum Mergers and Acquisitions (SDC M&A) database to the LBD to identify acquisition targets. If a frm in the LBD is matched to an acquisition target in SDC, we also classify the firm as having been acquired. Because the SDC M&A database has greater coverage of larger acquisitions and acquisitions by public acquirers, we also perform hand searches of news articles published between 1981 and 2005 as obtained from Lexis/Nexis to identify additional acquisition events. Appendix B describes our identification of acquisitions in the LBD in greater detail. Using Lexis/Nexis news searches to identify acquisitions in the LBD in addition to the SDC M&A database does not have a major impact on the difference in acquisition rates between VC- and non-VC-financed firms, though it does change the overall acquisition rates. Adding the searches increases the set of identified acquisitions for VC-financed firms by $24\\%$ , from 2,074 to 2,574 acquisitions. This corresponds to an increase in the total acquisition rate from $20.0\\%$ to $24.9\\%$ ， out of 10,349 VC-financed firms. The Lexis/Nexis searches increase the set of identified acquisitions for non-VC-financed firms by $32\\%$ , from 446 to 587 acquisitions. This corresponds to an increase in the total acquisition rate from $4.3\\%$ to $5.7\\%$ , out of 10,349 non-VC-financed firms.  \n\nWe identify firms that have had an IPO by merging the LBD to a list of firms having IPOs between 1981 and 2005 in the United States taken from the SDC Platinum Global New Issues database.  \n\n## I1. Which Firms Receive VC Financing?  \n\nHow prevalent is VC in our data? Table I shows that a statement on the prevalence of VC depends on the measure used. In Table I, Panel A, we see that, from the point of view of the number of firms having ever received VC, VC is close to irrelevant. Over the entire 25-year sample period from 1981 to 2005, on average only $0.10\\%$ of firms per year have ever received VC financing. This percentage includes firms that received VC between 1981 and 2005 and subsequently went public or were acquired by a larger firm, provided at least one establishment of the acquired VC-financed firm remains an active part of the combined firm. The percentage of firms having ever received VC increases over the sample period from $0.05\\%$ in the 1981-1985 period to $0.16\\%$ in the 2001-2005 period, reflecting the growth in the VC markets. However, even in more recent years VC-financed firms account for only a very small fraction of all firms in existence.  \n\nIf instead of focusing on the number of firms that get VC financing we focus on employment by VC-financed firms, we obtain a different picture of the prevalence of VC in the economy. Panel B of Table I considers the amount of employment generated by the VC-backed firms in Panel A. We find that employment generated by firms that have ever received VC, including otherwise non-VC-financed firms that have active acquired VC-financed establishments, accountsfor $5.5\\%$ of employment per year in the United States over our entire sample. This percentage rises steadily from $2.8\\%$ in the 1981-1985 period to $7.3\\%$ in the 2001-2005 period. We also report firm counts and employment statistics for the sample of VC-financed firms when we exclude otherwise nonVC-financed firms that have acquired active VC-financed establishments from the sample. This number provides a lower bound on the prevalence of VC financing in the economy. Even considering this more conservative definition of VC-financed firms, we see that VC-financed firms account for $4.0\\%$ ofemployment over the entire 1981-2005 period, rising from $2.7\\%$ in the 1981-1985 period to $5.3\\%$ in the 2001-2005 period.  \n\n2898 96%'60°8 989606\\*   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>7.3%</td><td>5.3%</td></tr><tr><td>6.8%</td><td>4.2%</td></tr><tr><td>5.7%</td><td>3.8%</td></tr><tr><td>4.6%</td><td>3.7%</td></tr><tr><td>2.8%</td><td>2.7%</td></tr><tr><td>5.5%</td><td>4.0%</td></tr><tr><td>% of total employment by firms in existence that have ever received VC (including firms with acquired VC-financed</td><td>%oftotal employment by firms in existence thathave ever received VC (excluding firms with acquired VC-financed establishments)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>establishments)</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n0007-9661 9661-1661 0661-9861 9861-1861   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>0.16%</td><td>6,678,664 0.14% 0.13%</td></tr><tr><td>0.14%</td><td>6,453,045 6,084,340</td></tr><tr><td>%60'0</td><td>0.08%</td></tr><tr><td>0.08%</td><td>5,579,077 0.08%</td></tr><tr><td>0.05%</td><td>4,980,533 0.05%</td></tr><tr><td>0.10%</td><td>5,955,132 0.09%</td></tr><tr><td>% of firms in existence that have ever received VC (including firmswith acquiredVC-financedestablishments)</td><td>firms with acquiredVC-financed establishments) Averagenumberoffirmsinexistence</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nWe also find that VC-financed firms are an extremely small percentage of all new firms created in the LBD. In Panel C of Table I we see that $0.11\\%$ of all new firms created during the 1981-2005 period ever receive VC financing. This percentage peaks at $0.22\\%$ of all new firms created in the 1996-2000 period. The results in Table I suggest that VC finances firms that grow rapidly and eventually become large players in the economy. We next examine what is different about the new firms that receive VC financing compared to those that do not and what criteria venture capitalists might consider when making their investments in firms.  \n\n### A. VC Financing by Industry  \n\nWhile we have some sense that VC-financed firms are concentrated in certain high-tech industries from surveys such as Moneytree and aggregate statistics reported by the National Venture Capital Association, it is unclear how the industry composition of firms that receive VC compares to the industry composition of firms that do not. We start by asking what industries VC backs relative to other sources of entrepreneurial capital over our 25-year sample period using Census data. Table II presents the average yearly number of firms in existence, their total employment by industry, and the percentages that are represented by frms that have ever received VC. The underlying sample is the same as that in Panels A and B of Table I. We classify firms into nine industry categories that correspond to the industry categories used by VentureSource and VentureXpert. In certain industries, such as Computers, Electronics, and Telecom, the percentage of firms that have ever received VC and the total employment represented by these firms is much higher than the economy-wide average. In these industries, if we include firms that have acquired VC-financed establishments that remain active parts of the acquiring firm, the percentage of firms having ever received VC exceeds $1\\%$ over the entire sample period, at $1.04\\%$ for Computers, $1.20\\%$ for Electronics, and $1.64\\%$ for Telecom. The percentage of firms having received VC is $0.95\\%$ for Computers, $1.04\\%$ for Electronics, and $1.43\\%$ for Telecom if we exclude firms that have aquired VC-financed establishments. The percentage of total employment by VC-financed firms in Computers, Electronics, and Telecom is around $20\\%$ if we include firms that have acquired VC-financed establishments in our set of VC-financed firms, at $19.0\\%$ for Computers, $20.4\\%$ for Electronics, and $21.1\\%$ for Telecom. If we exclude firms that have acquired VC-financed establishments from our set of VC-financed firms, we find that VC-financed firms account for $14.5\\%$ of employment in the Computers industry, $14.7\\%$ of employment in the Electronics industry, and $14.4\\%$ of employment in the Telecom industry.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"6\"></td><td>3,073,609</td><td>3.5%</td><td>2.5%</td><td>51,365,410 10,292,455</td></tr><tr><td>310,537</td><td>3.2%</td><td>2.2%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>313,135 1,063,667</td><td>4.9%</td><td>3.4%</td><td>3,630,903</td></tr><tr><td>483,036</td><td>6.1%</td><td>4.5%</td><td>19,836,900</td></tr><tr><td>17,577</td><td>6.8%</td><td>5.1%</td><td>7,807,423</td></tr><tr><td>37,231</td><td>21.1%</td><td>14.4%</td><td>1,635,223 1,898,511</td></tr><tr><td>475,227</td><td>20.4%</td><td>14.7%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>203,914</td><td>Panel B.

Panel A of Table III reports industry counts for all firms that first enter the LBD between 1981 and 2005. Consistent with Table II, we observe that in some industries the proportion of VC-financed firms being created is much higher. In particular, the percentage of VC-financed firms created in the Computer, Electronics, and Telecom industries together is $0.8\\%$ ,almosteight times greater than the population average. The percentage of VC-financed firms created in the Biotech/Medical industry is $0.3\\%$ .4Thisbreakdown is consistent with the notion that VC disproportionately backs firms in high-tech industries.  \n\nHowever, Table III also demonstrates that VC finances a large number of new firms in low-tech industries as well, although as a much smaller percentage of the total number of new firms in these industries. Over the 1981-2005 period, VC financed 17,763 new firms, of which 11,286 (or $64\\%$ ) are in the high-tech industries of Computer, Biotech/Medical, Electronics, and Telecom, and 6,477 (or $36\\%$ are in the low-tech industries of Finance, Consumer Goods, Business Services, Industrial Goods, and Other.  \n\nPanel B of Table IHI reports industry counts for VC- and non-VC-financed firms created between 1995 and 2005, the period over which we have tax return revenue data from the SSEL. Panel C reports the percentage of new VC- and non-VC-financed firms created in each industry between 1995 and 2005 that have zero revenues in their first year. We find that $47\\%$ of VCfinanced firms created between 1995 and 2005 had zero revenues in their frst year versus $9\\%$ of non-VC-financed firms. Thus, VC disproportionately finances firms that are created without having any initial commercial revenues. Even in the low-tech industries, the percentage of new VC-financed frms that have zero commercial revenues in their first year remains high, at between $36\\%$ and $42\\%$ of firms. The percentage of new VC-financed firms in the high-tech industries of Biotech/Medical, Electronics, and Telecom that are started with no revenues is even higher at between $58\\%$ and $68\\%$  \n\nTable III suggests that a large percentage of the firms that venture capitalists back develop new products without any initial sales. Insofar as these are more likely to be idea based or innovator firms, this finding is consistent with prior work by Kortum and Lerner (20oo),who assess the contribution of VC to innovation in the U.S. and find that it is positively related, and Hellmann and Puri (2000), who ask if firms with an innovator strategy are more likely to getVC.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>8,548,439 2,225 (13%) (53%) 628,148 1,178 (7%) (4%) 1,058,628 1,408 (8%) (7%) 2,889,916 1,049 (%9) (18%) 1,175,770 Panel A.New Firms Created between 1981 and 2005 617 (3%) (7%) 53,629 (0.3%) 948 (5%) 72,641 (0.4%) (5%) 971 876,401 2,372 (13%) (5%) 982,952 6,995 (39%) (%9) 16,286,524 17,763 non-VC-financed firms Totalnumberofnew VC-financed firms Totalnumberofnew</td><td>3,474,902 1,191 (10%) (47%) 240,904 519 (5%) (3%) 592,753 966 (%6) (8%) 1,313,973 717 (%9) (18%) 615,418 PanelB.NewFirms Created between 1995 and 2005 414 (4%) (8%) 2005withz (5%) 28,060 (0.4%) 619 1995and 29,095 (5%) (0.4%) 513 427,841 1,262 (11%) (%9) 719,953 5,251 (46%) (10%) 7,442,899 11,482 non-VC-financed firms Totalnumberofnew VC-financed firms Totalnumberofnew</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n### B.VC Financing and Firm Size  \n\nWe next examine whether VC appears to have scale (actual or potential) criteria for the firms in which it invests.  \n\n#### B.1. Comparing All VC- and Non-VC-Financed Firms  \n\nFigures 1a and 1b depict the average employment and sales by firm age for all VC- and non-VC-financed firms in the LBD created between 1981 and 2005. Figure 1c plots our measure of profitability, (sales-payroll)/sales, or payroll margin. We do not observe other firm cost variables, so we only use employment costs in this measure. The sales variable depicted in Figures 1b and 1c is the sales variable from the Economic Censuses of Services, Wholesale Trade, and Retail Trade and the LRD. In the remaining analysis we use this measure of firm sales, rather than SSEL tax return revenues, because we can observe this measure of sales over our entire sample period. In Figures 1a, 1b, and 1c, we track firms until their first exit event, that is, failure, acquisition, or IPO, if applicable, since we are only interested in examining firms for which VCs are currentlyinvested and involved.  \n\nFigures 1a and 1b show that VC-financed firms are larger than non-VCfinanced firms, measured by both employment and sales, at each age of the life cycle prior to first exit. In addition, the size difference between VC- and nonVC-financed firms becomes larger with firm age, that is, the average growth rate of VC-financed firms is larger. This suggests that actual or potential scale of employment and sales is an important criterion in how venture capitalists choose which firms to finance. Figure 1c shows that another difference between VC- and non-VC-financed firms is that VC-financed firms spend a much larger share of their sales on payroll expenses for employees.  \n\n#### B.2. Comparing Matched VC- and Non-VC-Financed Firms  \n\nFigures 2a and 2b plot average firm employment and sales in “match time,”\" or years from matching, for the sample of one-to-one matched VC-financed and non-VC-financed firms. We see that, at the point of matching, VC-financed and non-VC-financed firms have similar employment, by construction of the matching algorithm, and sales levels.  \n\nAfter VC financing, we see very rapid growth in the employment of VCfinanced firms relative to non-VC-financed firms. While VC-financed and nonVC-financed firms are matched at an average of 26 employees each, 3 years later VC-financed firms have on average 55 employees while non-VC-financed firms have 38 employees. We continue to see greater employment growth by VC-financed firms relative to non-VC-financed firms as time goes by. In the first several years after matching in Figure 2b, VC-financed firms and non-VCfinanced firms both experience increases in sales, but sales growth is greater for VC-financed firms. Non-VC-financed firms do not “catch up\" to VC-financed firms in these later years in terms of employment or sales. Non-VC-financed firms also continue to grow on average, but at a much slower rate than the VC-financed firms even in this later point in their life cycles.5  \n\n![](images/f6eb3b838305424e4de6a00fcd1855a0aa58ac9ecec23fd78c5431d6000b1347.jpg)  \nFigure 1. Average size and profitability of all VC- and non-VC-financed firms created between 1981 and 2005. The sample consists of all frms that first enter the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) between 1981 and 2005. The firms are tracked from the time they enter the LBD to the year of their first exit event, if applicable, via failure, acquisition, or IPO. Employment and payroll data are taken from the LBD. Sales data are taken from the 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997, and 2002 waves of the Censuses of Services, Retail Trade, and Wholesale Trade and from the Longitudinal Research Database.  \n\n![](images/0fad81b1c8166348eb46491f0422d65ab57928ec47f109c475f9f75d28fa3565.jpg)  \nFigure 2. Average firm size and profitability in one-to-one matched sample. The sample is the one-to-one matched sample of 10,349 VC-financed and 10,349 non-VC-financed firms described in Appendix A. The firms are tracked from the time they enter the LBD to the year oftheir first exit event, if applicable, via failure, acquisition, or IPO. Employment and payroll data are taken from the LBD. Sales data are taken from the 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997, and 2002 waves of the Censuses of Services, Retail Trade, and Wholesale Trade and from the Longitudinal Research Database.  \n\nFigure 2c plots payroll margin for VC- and non-VC-financed firms in match time. When VC-financed firms first receive VC, their payroll margins are dramatically lower than the matched non-VC-financed firms. The average payroll margin is 0.19 for VC-financed firms in the first year of VC finance while for matched non-VC-financed firms the average payroll margin is 0.49. Afterward, VC-financed firms' payroll margins hover around 0.40 and then gradually increase around 5 years after first VC financing. In contrast, non-VC-financed firms' payroll margins stay close to 0.60 in all years after matching. Figure 2c buttresses the claim that VCs invest heavily in employment, not only via larger numbers of employees but also via higher wages, in the first several years after investing in a firm. As firms age and exit, VC-financed firms' payroll margins come into line with those of non-VC-financed firms.  \n\nWe also analyze the size differences between the matched VC- and non-VCfinanced firms in a regression framework. We regress our firm size and profitability measures on a dummy variable, VC, that equals one for VC-financed firms as well as a time variable, TimefromMatch, that measures how far a firm is in years from being matched to its ex-ante observationally equivalent counterpart. We also interact TimefromMatch and the VC dummy to separately identify the time dimensions of each dependent variable for VC-financed firms. We run OLS panel regressions on VC and TimefromMatch, as well as the square of TimefromMatch to capture nonlinearities in the relation between firm size and time. In each regression we also include year fixed effects and industry fixed effects.  \n\nTable IV reports the coefficients and $t$ -statistics, corrected for clustering by firm, for the OLS size and profitability regressions in our panel of matched VCand non-VC-financed firms. The first three specifications regress the natural log of employment and sales as well as our payroll profitability measure on just the VC dummy variable. We see that VC-financed frms are on average larger, in terms of both employment and sales, and less profitable than nonVC-financed firms while VCs are involved with these firms as evidenced by the strongly significant coefficients on the VC dummy variable.  \n\nThe last three specifications in Table IV allow us to see whether the growth pattern in employment, sales, and profitability differs for VC-financed firms over time. We find that VC-financed firms grow more quickly in terms of both employment and sales after VCs invest in them relative to their matched nonVC-financed counterparts, as evidenced by the positive and significant coeffcientson $V C^{*}$ TimefromMatch in the first two regressions. However, the growth rates in size for VC-financed firms also level off more rapidly in later years, perhaps as VCs exit their successful investments more rapidly, as evidenced by the negative and significant coefficients on $V C^{*}$ TimefromMatch².Finally, the payroll margin regression suggests that VC-financed frms are initially less profitable, in terms of payroll margins, than non-VC-financed firms and continue to be so till exit.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">(Sales-Payroll)/Sales -0.177*** Log(Sales) 0.502*** Log(Employment) 0.023</td><td>0.025*** -0.001*** (-6.67) -0.002 (-0.16) 0.000 (0.45) (5.57) (-4.26) Yes Yes (11.03) 0.250*** -0.012*** -0.001** (1.12) (22.79) (-12.07) (7.73) (-2.03) Yes</td></tr><tr><td>0.211*** -0.012*** 0.121*** -0.003*** 17,885 (11.23) (-8.73) (10.11) (-4.12) Yes Yes 18.0% 0.047*** Yes</td></tr><tr><td>101,936 12.3% 17,885 4.7%</td></tr><tr><td>(Sales-Payroll)/Sales -0.179*** (-15.24) Log(Sales)</td><td>Yes Yes</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">0.895*** (28.09) Log(Employment) 0.572*** (30.34) VC*TimefromMatch</td><td>17,885 Yes Yes</td></tr><tr><td>101,936 Yes Yes</td></tr><tr><td>6.3% Industry fixed effects?

Thus, a key difference between VC-financed and non-VC-financed firms that emerges from our analysis is firm scale. Larger firm scale rather than higher profitability seems to be an important criterion for VC-financed firms to achieve prior to exit.  \n\n## II1. VC Financing and Firm Exit  \n\nWe have seen that VC-financed firms change enormously relative to nonVC-financed firms in terms of size after venture capitalists become involved. However, it is unclear whether these differences tend to emerge because all VCfinanced frms grow more quickly or because venture capitalists exit smaller firms more quickly relative to non-VC investors. One characterization of venture capitalists often found in anecdotal evidence is that they encourage the development of the one or two very high growth firms in their portfolio, that is, the potential eBays and Googles, and care little about the rest of their portfolio. Some argue that venture capitalists are quick to shut down companies; others suggest that venture capital is patient money and venture capitalists recognize the option value in their investments and exert effort to ensure companies do not close down. The nature of failure is arguably one of the least understood aspects of VC-financed firms. Because the LBD allows us to observe firm failures, we are able to present alternative statistics on VC-financed firm exits compared to the standard industrial data sources on VC-financed firms, such as VentureXpert and Venture Source. We are also able to compare these exit statistics to those of non-VC-financed firms.  \n\n### A.Cumulative Exit Rates  \n\nTable V presents cumulative exit rates for all VC and non-VC-financed firms in the LBD. The exit rates are reported as of 2005, when our version of the LBD ends. The first set of columns in Table V presents exit percentages for firms that are created during the full sample period, 1981-2005. For this sample, we see that $34.1\\%$ of VC-financed firms fail, $26.4\\%$ get acquired, and $7.4\\%$ go public. For non-VC-financed firms, $66.3\\%$ fail, $0.85\\%$ get acquired, and $0.02\\%$ go public. Note that these percentages do not sum to $100\\%$ for each set of firms since some firms experience no exit event, that is, they continue as of 2005.  \n\nThe second set of columns in Table V presents exit percentages for firms that are created between 1981 and 1997, 8 years before our sample period ends in 20o5. Calculating exit rates for this set of firms results in a smaller percentage of firms that experience no exit event since we observe firms in the data for a period at least as long as the typical VC investment. These exit rates are informative since they measure longer-term exit rates of VC- and non-VC-financed firms. We see that $39.7\\%$ of VC-financed firms fail, $33.5\\%$ get acquired, and $16.1\\%$ go public. In contrast, $78.9\\%$ of non-VC-financed firms fail, $1.04\\%$ get acquired, and $0.02\\%$ go public.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"8\">Firms Created 1981-1997 Firms Created</td><td>VC vs. non-VC Non-VC-financed</td><td>z-statistic -88.2*** 290***</td><td>750***</td></tr><tr><td>(n =10,811,883) firms</td><td></td><td rowspan=\"2\">1.04 0.02 78.9</td></tr><tr><td>VC-financed firms</td><td>(n =7,037) 39.7 5. 16.1</td></tr><tr><td>firms</td><td>VC vs. non-VC z-statistic -86.1***</td><td>350*** 650***</td></tr><tr><td>Non-VC-financed 1981-2005</td><td>(n=16,304,287) 66.3</td><td>0.85 0.02</td></tr><tr><td>VC-financed</td><td>(n =17,763) firms 34.1</td><td>26.4 8.5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>%failasof2005</td><td>%acquiredasof2005 %IPOasof2005</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nWe focus the rest of our analysis on the full 1981-2005 sample period and later account for the fact that firms may experience no exit event in multinomial logit models when comparing the exit patterns of VC- and nonVC-financed firms. We do this because it is important to include the latter part of our sample beginning in 1998, which experienced the biggest boom and bust cycle in the VC industry, when considering differences between VC- and non-VC-financed firms. Moreover, we later separately examine the boom period, 1998-2000, when examining VC- and non-VC-financed firm exit patterns.  \n\nWe next examine in further detail the dynamics of firm exit. Table VI, Panel A, presents cumulative exit rates as of 2005 by firm age for all VC- and nonVC-financed firms created between 1981 and 2005 in the LBD. The cumulative failure rate of non-VC-financed firms 5 years after entry is $50.9\\%$ , while for VCfinanced firms it is only $24.1\\%$ . Ten years after entry, the cumulative failure rate is $61.6\\%$ for non-VC-financed firms and $31.6\\%$ for VC-financed firms. These percentages at each age are based on the total number of firms in each sample. In the case of VC-financed firms, the cumulative exit percentages for each age are based on the full sample of 17,763 firms, and in the case of non-VC-financed firms the cumulative exit percentages at each age are based on the full sample of 16,304,287 frms.6  \n\nIn Table VI, Panel A, we see that the large difference in cumulative failure rates between VC- and non-VC-financed firms is largely driven by much lower probabilities of VC-financed firms failing in the first years of life. At age two, the marginal probability of failing for VC-financed firms is $5.3\\%$ and for nonVC-financed firms is $13.9\\%$ , a difference of 8.6 percentage points. At age three, the marginal probability of failing is $6.1\\%$ for VC-financed firms and $8.7\\%$ for non-VC-financed firms, a difference of 2.6 percentage points. At age five, there is a one percentage point difference in marginal failure probabilities between VC- and non-VC-financed firms ( $3.4\\%$ versus $4.4\\%$ ). After age five, the difference in marginal failure rates between VC- and non-VC-financed firms declines dramatically as firms continue to age.7 This suggests that VCs make the biggest difference in the early years of firms' life cycles, or that they select firms that are much less likely to fail early on.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"13\">Firm Age in Years</td><td rowspan=\"13\">00 9 8</td><td>31.6 23.8 7.6</td><td>0.01 61.6 0.8</td><td rowspan=\"13\">-77.7*** 330*** 640***</td></tr><tr><td>30.9 23.2</td><td>7.4 60.3</td><td>0.01 0.7</td></tr><tr><td>29.9</td><td>7.0 58.8 22.4</td><td>0.01 0.7</td></tr><tr><td>28.5 7</td><td>21.1 6.6</td><td>56.8 0.7 0.01</td></tr><tr><td>26.7 6</td><td>19.6 6.1</td><td>0.01 0.6</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>54.2 0.01 280***</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>24.1 17.8 5</td><td>-67.5*** 50.9 0.6</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>20.7 15.2 4.4</td><td>0.5 0.01 46.5 0.01</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>15.8 11.8 3</td><td>40.4 0.5</td></tr><tr><td>9.7 2</td><td>8.2 5</td><td>0.01 31.7 0.4</td></tr><tr><td>4.4</td><td>4.6 0.8</td><td rowspan=\"2\">-55.8*** 0.01 150*** 17.8 0.2</td></tr><tr><td>VC-financed firms (n = 17,763)</td><td>non-VC-financed firms (n = 16,304,287)</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"10\">00 9 8 Years from First VC Financing or Matching 7 6 5 4 3</td><td rowspan=\"10\"></td><td>33.7 24.2 7.2</td><td>-18.5*** 38.3*** 0.14 46.3 5.3</td></tr><tr><td>33.4 24.0 32.9 23.7</td><td>45.6 5.1</td></tr><tr><td>6.9 45.0</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>32.2 23.0 6.7</td><td>43.9 4.9</td></tr><tr><td>31.0 22.0 6.4</td><td>42.4 4.6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>29.1 20.6 5.9</td><td>-16.7*** 35.8*** 40.1 2</td></tr><tr><td>26.3 18.0 5.1</td><td>36.8 3.8</td></tr><tr><td>20.9 15.0 4.1</td><td>30.8 3.2</td></tr><tr><td>12.8 2</td><td>10.4 2.5 21.8</td><td>2.4</td></tr><tr><td>4.9</td><td>5.6 1 9.5</td><td>-8.5*** 29.8*** 1.4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VC-financed firms (n = 10,349)</td><td>non-VC-financed firms (n = 10,349)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>z-statistic for % acquired z-statistic for % fail z-statistic for %IPO</td></tr><tr><td>acquired % fail % IPO %</td><td>% fail</td><td>acquired % IPO</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTurning to the cumulative acquisition and IPO rates in Table VI, Panel A, we see that VC-financed firms are much more likely to be acquired and go public relative to non-VC-financed firms. By age five, $17.8\\%$ of the VC-financed firms have been acquired and $5.3\\%$ have gone public, versus $0.6\\%$ and $0.01\\%$ for nonVC-financed firms. By age 10, these figures are $23.8\\%$ and $7.6\\%$ for VC-financed firms and $0.8\\%$ and $0.01\\%$ for non-VC-financed firms. This suggests that VCs actively promote or select their companies to exit via these exit routes earlier, perhaps by growing them more rapidly earlier in the life cycle.  \n\nIn Table VI, Panel B, we report the cumulative exit rates of firms in our one-to-one matched sample as of 2005, rather than for the general population of VC- and non-VC-financed firms. We see that, even when we compare them to observationally equivalent non-VC-financed firms, VC-financed firms are once again less likely to fail and more likely to be acquired and to go public than nonVC-financed firms. Five years after receiving VC, $29.1\\%$ of VC-financed firms have failed, whereas $40.1\\%$ of matched non-VC-financed firms have failed. Further, $20.6\\%$ of VC-financed firms have been acquired and $5.9\\%$ have gone public after 5 years, whereas only $4.2\\%$ of matched non-VC-financed firms have been acquired and the percentage of non-VC-financed firms going public is too small to disclose. Ten years after first receiving VC, $33.7\\%$ of VC-financed firms and $46.3\\%$ of matched non-VC-financed firms have failed. Likewise, $24.2\\%$ of VC-financed firms have been acquired and $7.2\\%$ have gone public, whereas only $5.3\\%$ of matched non-VC-financed firms have been acquired after 10 years and only $0.14\\%$ have gone public.  \n\n### B. Timing of Exits  \n\nTables V and VI demonstrate that VC financing is strongly associated with a lower cumulative probability of failure. Thus, the larger VC-financed frm sizes relative to non-VC-financed firms that we observe in Section II.B are not driven by higher failure rates of VC-financed firms relative to non-VC-financed firms, so that only larger firms survive. Rather, VC-financed firms on average dominate non-VC-financed firms in terms of having both higher growth rates and lower failure rates even in our matched sample.  \n\nWe next examine the timing of exits in more detail and ask whether the timing of firm failures, in particular, is different for VC- and non-VC-financed firms. Venture capitalists might push their companies hard to grow quickly, deciding relatively rapidly which firms have the best chance of achieving a successful exit and terminating those that do not in the interest of allocating more capital to the likely winners in their portfolios. Alternatively, VCs may have a more difficult time judging which firms will be successful in the early stages of investment and equally nurture and invest in all of their firms over a certain period of time.  \n\nWe first focus on the failure rates reported for the matched sample in Table VI, Panel B. Examining the marginal failure rates of VC- and nonVC-financed firms by subtracting cumulative failure rates in successive years, we see that the largest differences in failure rates occur in the first few years after firms first receive VC. Two years after receiving VC, the marginal probability of failure is $7.9\\%$ for VC-financed firms and $12.3\\%$ for matched non-VCfinanced firms, a 4.4 percentage point difference statistically significant at the $1\\%$ confidence level. Four years after receiving VC, the marginal probability of failure is $5.4\\%$ for VC-financed firms and $6.0\\%$ for matched non-VC-financed firms, a 0.6 percentage point difference, statistically significant only at the $10\\%$ confidence level. By 6 years after receiving VC, the marginal failure rate of VC-financed firms is 0.4 percentage points lower than that for matched nonVC-financed frms, $1.9\\%$ versus $2.3\\%$ , with statistical significance only at the $10\\%$ confidence level. The difference in marginal failure probabilities for VCand non-VC-financed firms in the matched sample further decreases in later years and loses statistical significance.  \n\nWe next examine whether these patterns in the timing of failures persist when we control for differences in industry and year. Since each firm in our one-to-one matched sample can experience only one exit event, we model firm exit in a multinomial panel logit model in which the excluded outcome is no exit, that is, the firm continues as of 2005. We report marginal probabilities calculated at sample means and $z$ -statistics corrected for clustering by firm in parentheses for two multinomial logit specifications in Table Vll. In the first specification we model firm exit as a function of a VC dummy and industry and year fixed effects. In the second specification, we also control for the number of years from being matched, TimefromMatch, as well as TimefromMatch? and interact these variables with the VC dummy to distinguish differences in exit probabilities between VC- and non-VC-financed firms over time.  \n\nThe exit patterns we observe in Table VI are borne out in the multinomial logit models in Table VII. Focusing on the first model, we see that VC-financed firms are much more likely to be acquired and go public and are less likely to fail than non-VC-financed firms. On average, as per the marginal probabilities, VC-financed firms are 4.1 percentage points more likely to be acquired, 0.8 percentage points more likely to go public, and 1.3 percentage points less likely to fail in a given year.  \n\nIn the second model, in which we allow for differences in the exit dynamics between VC- and non-VC-financed firms, we see that the probability that a VC-financed firm is acquired increases each year after the firm first receives VC-financing relative to non-VC-financed firms, as evidenced by a positive and statistically significant coefficient on the interaction between the VC dummy and TimefromMatch. The probability of going public for VC-financed firms does not increase over time relative to that for non-VC-financed firms, as evidenced by a statistically insignificant coefficient on the interaction between the VC dummy and TimefromMatch. The probability of going public and getting acquired increases each year for both VC- and non-VC-financed firms as evidenced by a positive and statistically significant coefficient on TimefromMatch, but the increase slows over time as evidenced by the negative and statistically significant coefficient on TimefromMatch\".  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"7\">Multinomial Logit #2 (Base = No Exit) Fail IPO Multinomial Logit #1 (Base = No Exit) Acquired Fail</td><td rowspan=\"7\">0.008*** (6.17) IPO Acquired 0.028*** (13.49)</td><td>-0.00003** -0.0001 0.0005*** (-0.50) 0.0000 (-2.56) (0.10) (2.96) -0.053*** (-15.35)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.0004*** -0.0002*** 0.004*** (-5.43) 0.002*** (-3.41) (6.06) (4.07) Yes</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>0.018*** -0.001*** -0.001*** (10.04) (-6.09) 0.009*** (10.07) (-10.26) Yes Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Yes Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>105,031 Yes Yes</td></tr><tr><td>-0.013*** (-6.10) VC*TimefromMatch2 VC*TimefromMatch TimefromMatch2 TimefromMatch</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nIn the second model of Table VII, we also see that VC-financed firms have lower probabilities of failure overall, as evidenced by the negative and statistically significant coefficient on the VC dummy. All firms have an increasing marginal probability of failure over time, as evidenced by the positive and statistically significant coefficient on TimefromMatch. However, over time the failure probability for VC-financed firms increases more than that for non-VC financed firms as evidenced by the positive and significant coefficient on the interaction between the VC dummy and TimefromMatch.8  \n\nThe estimates in Table VII suggest that VC helps keep firms alive in the early part of their life cycle. In the first several years after receiving VC, VCfinanced firms typically grow rapidly in terms of employment and sales relative to non-VC-financed firms and have lower failure rates relative to matched nonVC-financed firms. However, after this initial growth period, the differences in marginal failure rates taper off. It is also possible that companies that survive for several years without VC financing are particularly strong companies, whereas it may take less for companies with VC financing to survive for this long. This evidence is consistent with VC allowing firms to grow and reach certain milestones before they are shut down.9  \n\n### C. Do VCs Have Different Thresholds for Failure?  \n\nVC-financed firms are initially more likely to survive but then have similar failure rates relative to non-VC-financed firms. A question that arises is whether the threshold for firm survival is different for VC-financed firms. Do venture capitalists simply wait to see if there is option value to be realized, but then when they do shut firms down, have a more stringent criterion for what it means to be a successful surviving firm relative to investors in non-VC-financed firms?  \n\nTo shed light on this question, we examine whether VC-financed firms look different from non-VC-financed firms at failure. We report average employment, sales, and payroll margins of firms in the year before they fail in Panel A of Table VIII. We see that VC-financed firms are on average larger than non-VC-financed firms when they fail, both in terms of employment and sales. However, they have lower payroll margins at failure. These results suggest that VCs grow all of their portfolio companies to a certain minimum level before deciding to shut them down, perhaps in an attempt to learn which of their portfolio companies will have successful acquisitions or IPOs.  \n\n### D. Are VC-Financed Firm Failures Disguised as Acquisitions?  \n\nAn alternative explanation for our results is that the lower failure rates for VC-financed firms reflect the fact that some failures are disguised as acquisitions. However, it may also be the case that both VC- and non-VC-financed firms have to meet minimum eligibility criteria before other corporations or public investors will buy their equity. To shed light on these alternative hypotheses, we compare the average size of VC- and non-VC-financed firms at acquisition and IPO in Panels B and C of Table VIII. There is no significant difference in the size of VC- and non-VC-financed firms at acquisition or IPO. Thus, it does not appear that venture capitalists are disguising failures as acquisitions, which implies that the lower overall failure rates for VC-financed firms truly reflect a difference in failure rates between VC-financed and non-VC-financed firms. Moreover, it appears that on average VC-financed frms are not able to take firms public or sell them to other firms without meeting size standards that non-VC-financed firms must also meet.  \n\nWe also take an alternative approach to defining acquisition events in the LBD to test whether failures are being disguised as acquisitions. We define a \"going concern\" acquisition as an acquisition in which the acquired firm is not shut down within 2 years of the acquisition. Doing so re-classifies some acquisitions as failures. When we only count going concern acquisitions, 4,429 (or $43\\%$ of VC-financed firms fail and 1,732 (or $17\\%$ ) get acquired as going concerns, compared to 3,587 (or $35\\%$ )and 2,574 (or $25\\%$ ) when we count all acquisitions, both going concern and non-going concern acquisitions. When we use the going concern definition of acquisitions, 5,175 (or $50\\%$ ) of non-VC-financed firms fail and 421 (or $4\\%$ ) get acquired, compared to 5,009 (or $48\\%$ ) and 587 (or $6\\%$ when we count both going concern and non-going concern acquisitions. Thus, using the going concern definition of acquisitions re-classifies many more VCfinanced firms from acquisition to failure than it does non-VC-financed firms. However, the cumulative failure rates of VC-financed frms remain lower and their cumulative acquisition rates higher than for non-VC-financed firms.  \n\nWe also examine the characteristics of VC- and non-VC-financed firms that fail and are acquired in the year before these two types of events using the going concern definition. Panel D of Table VIlI presents average age and employment size for going concern acquisitions and failed firms. When compared to the statistics in Panels A and B of Table VIlI, we see that the average size of firms at acquisition for “going concern\" acquisitions is 61 and 64 employees for nonVC- and VC-financed firms, respectively, compared to 56 employees when we count all acquisitions. Thus, the firms acquired in going concern acquisitions are slightly larger than firms that are not. However, the difference in size between VC- and non-VC-financed firms is statistically insignificant even using the alternative going concern definition of acquisitions. Moreover, using the going concern definition of acquisitions, we find that VC-financed firms are larger at failure compared to non-VC-financed firms. Thus, the differences in size observed between VC- and non-VC-financed firms at exit are robust to considering going concern acquisitions.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>(Sales-Payroll) Sales Panel A.Failures</td><td>0.5 0.7</td><td>4.62***</td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"7\">Sales Number with Employment atExit</td><td>atExit 3,103.0 1,250.6 7.53***</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>SalesData 818</td><td>935</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>26.9 15.1</td><td>7.32*** Panel B.

Do Exit Patterns of VC-Financed Firms Differ by Time Period?  \n\nIt is possible that the patterns we observe for the 1981-2005 sample period are driven primarily by the years prior to 2001. VC investing peaked in 1998-2000, which witnessed many IPOs in high-tech industries, but after which public equity market values declined dramatically. We ask whether the performance differential of VC-financed firms relative to non-VC-financed frms in terms of larger size, lower failure rates, and higher acquisition and IPO rates disappeared for firms that received VC in the so-called bubble period of1998-2000.  \n\nTo examine this question we select a sample of VC-financed firms that first received VC financing during 1998-2000 and their matched non-VC-financed firms. Many firms that received VC financing during this period may have been financed with the expectation of having a quick IPO, but the window for exit may have disappeared before these firms were ready to exit. In addition, it is possible that VCs backed lower quality firms during this period. We first examine the cumulative exit rates for VC- and non-VC-financed firms in this subsample. Table IX , Panel A, presents cumulative exit rates for the full sample period, 1981-2005, and for the subsample of firms receiving VC in the bubble period 1998-2000. For the subsample of firms receiving VC in 1998-2000, we see that the cumulative failure rate for VC-financed firms $(42.7\\%)$ is less than that for non-VC-financed firms $(51.5\\%)$ ; however, the difference is smaller than that for the full sample period $34.7\\%$ versus $48.4\\%$ 0. In addition, the acquisition rate for VC-financed firms is higher than that for non-VC-financed firms, as is the IPO rate. The IPO rate for VC-financed firms in the bubble period is much smaller than that for the entire sample period, reflecting in part the fact that IPO opportunities dried up shortly after firms in the bubble period first received VC financing.  \n\nTable IX, Panel B, shows the average sizes and ages of VC- and non-VCfinanced firms that fail and are acquired in the year before they exit in the subsample of firms first receiving VC during 1998-2000. We see that the patterns we observe in the full sample in Table VII, Panels A and B, hold when we focus only on VC firms financed during the bubble period. In particular, failed VC-financed firms are larger and less profitable than failed non-VC-financed firms. Acquired VC-financed firms look similar to acquired non-VC-financed firms in terms of employment. One difference between the subsamples and the full sample, however, is that both VC- and non-VC-financed firms that fail are on average younger than firms that fail in the full sample.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"8\">Firms First Receiving VC 1998-2000 Firms First Receiving VC 1981-2005</td><td>VC vs. Non-VC (BubblePeriod\")</td><td>z-Statistic -7.8*** 26.1***</td></tr><tr><td>Non-VC-Financed Firms</td><td>(n=3,944) 51.5 4.9</td></tr><tr><td>VC-Financed (n =3,944) Firms</td><td>42.7 2. 2 3.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"5\">VC-Financed</td><td>VC vs. Non-VC z-Statistic</td><td>-20.1*** 38.4*** 27.4***</td></tr><tr><td>Non-VC-Financed (n =10,349) Firms</td><td>48.4 7 0.14 5</td></tr><tr><td>(n =10,349) Firms 34.7</td><td>24.9 7.4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>% acquired as of 2005</td></tr><tr><td>%fail as of 2005</td><td>% IPO as of 2005</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n  \na SuInn A \\* y e o pauisse  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"9\">(Sales-Payroll) Sales Number with Employment Age at Exit Number</td><td rowspan=\"9\">Sales at Exit Sales Data atExit</td><td>-3.14*** 0.4 0.6</td><td rowspan=\"2\">(Sales-Payroll)</td><td colspan=\"3\">Sales</td></tr><tr><td>3,144.1 1,136.0 5.27***</td><td>Sales</td><td>at Exit</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>362 324</td><td></td><td>Number with SalesData</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>5.74*** 27.7 16.7</td><td></td><td>Employment atExit</td><td>48.1</td><td>1.57 38.2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>3.9</td><td>1.48 3.6</td></tr><tr><td>6.71*** 3.8 3.4</td><td></td><td>Age at Exit</td><td>1,034 194</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1,683 2,029</td><td></td><td>Number</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>t-statistic for VC vs. non-VC</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>t-statistic for VC vs. non-VC non-VC-financed firms</td></tr><tr><td>non-VC-financed firms VC-financed firms</td><td></td><td>Acquisitions</td><td></td><td>VC-financed firms</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nOverall, the analysis indicates that the life cycle dynamics of VC- and nonVC-financed firms that we observe in the full sample of matched firms in the 1981-2005 period are qualitatively the same in the subsample of firms that first receive VC in the bubble period, 1998-2000. However, the outperformance by VC-financed firms in terms of lower failure rates and higher IPO and acquisition rates diminishes in this subsample of firms.  \n\n### F. Are Exit Patterns of VC-Financed Firms Driven by Certain Kinds of VCs?  \n\nAnother possible explanation for our results is that the relation between exit rates and VC financing, firm size, and profitability is driven by certain kinds of VC, for example, high or low reputed VC. A literature has developed that explores the impact of different types of VCs on investment outcomes (e.g., Botazzi, Hellmann, and da Rin (2008), Gompers (1996), Sorensen (2007), and Zarutskie (2010)). Understanding whether the relation between VC financing, firm scale and exits, both successes and failures, differs significantly for high and low reputed VCs is thus an interesting question in its own right.  \n\nWe measure “high reputation\" VC investors as those that are in the top quartile ofthe age distribution of VC firms in VentureSource and VentureXpert. There is evidence that older VCs and those that have more experience doing deals generally have higher returns (e.g., Sorensen (2007)). We use age as our measure of the reputation of a VC firm's quality. We find that our results are robust to alternative measures of VC reputation such as the number of past deals and number of past IPOs of the VC firm. We choose to report the results using VC age for the sake of brevity.  \n\nFor each VC-financed firm in the LBD, we calculate the maximum age of the VC firms investing in the companies in their first round of VC financing. If the oldest VC firm that invests in the company's first round is in the upper quartile of the VC firm age distribution at the time it invests in the company, then the VC-financed firm is classified as having a high reputation VC firm as an investor. All other VC-financed firms are classified as receiving financing from low reputation VC investors.  \n\nTable X reports cumulative exit rates for VC-financed firms by VC investor reputation in the full sample and in the subsample of firms that first receive VC in the bubble period of 1998-2000. The cumulative exit rates for non-VCfinanced firms are also presented. We see that, in both samples, VC-financed firms backed by high reputation VC investors have lower failure rates and higher acquisition and IPO rates than do VC-financed firms backed by low reputation VC investors. However, both high reputation and low reputation VC-financed firms have higher acquisition and IPO rates than do non-VCfinanced firms. In addition, in the full sample and the subsample of firms first receiving VC between 1998 and 2000, both high reputation and low reputation VC-financed firms have lower failure rates than non-VC-financed firms. In fact, the difference in cumulative exit rates between low reputation VC-financed firms and non-VC-financed firms is statistically significant at the $1\\%$ level in both sample periods.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Non-VC-Financed Firms First Receiving VC 1998-2000 (\"Bubble Period\") Low Reputation High Reputation</td><td>(n=3,944) Firms VC-Financed Firms VC-Financed Firms</td><td>51.5^^^</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(n=2,190) 44.7*** (n=523)</td><td>24.5*** 2.3*** 36.9 35.2 8</td></tr><tr><td>Non-VC-Financed Firms First Receiving VC 1981-2005 Low Reputation</td><td>(n =10,349) Firms VC-Financed Firms (n =6,049)</td><td>48.4^^ 0.14^^ 5.7^AA</td></tr><tr><td>High Reputation</td><td>VC-FinancedFirms (n=1,614)</td><td>36.7*** 24.8*** 7.3**</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"4\"></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>%fail as of 2005</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>% acquired as of 2005 %IPO as of 2005</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n1-T--T-  \n\n# IV. Conclusion  \n\nThis paper is the first to our knowledge that uses a panel data set of the universe of employer firms in the United States over 25 years in conjunction with other government and proprietary data sources to empirically examine the life cycle dynamics of VC-financed and non-VC-financed firms. Using all firms across different industries and geographic areas as well as a matched sample of VC- and non-VC-financed firms, we explore differences in VC- and non-VC-financed firms to address several outstanding questions about the role of VC in new firm creation.  \n\nFirst, we examine the prevalence of VC in new firm creation in the economy. We see that, from the point of view of new firm foundings, VC-financed firms are an extremely small percentage of all new firms created—accounting for $0.11\\%$ over our 25-year sample period and increasing to $0.22\\%$ between 1996 and 2ooo. However, the picture is different if we focus on employment. The amount of employment generated by VC-backed firms accounts for $4.2\\%$ to $6.8\\%$ of employment in the United States between 1996 and 2000, steadily rising from $2.7\\%$ to $2.8\\%$ in the 1981-1985 period. Hence, in terms of employment generated, VC is more prevalent, and widely perceived to be an engine of growth for the economy.  \n\nWe next ask what kinds of firms receive VC financing. We find that venture capitalists disproportionately invest in firms that have no commercial sales but that exhibit high levels of initial investment. Further, VC-financed firms grow larger than non-VC-financed firms, as measured by employment and sales, suggesting that VC backs firms that can achieve large scale. VC-financed firms also exhibit larger levels of sales but their payroll expenditures increase correspondingly, so VC-financed firms appear no more profitable than non-VCfinanced firms before they are exited.  \n\nSince our data allow us to identify which firms fail, or are shut down, we generate statistics on exit percentages for VC-financed firms that cannot be obtained from the standard data sources on VC-financed firms. After the length of a typical VC investment, we find that $39.7\\%$ of VC-financed firms fail, $33.5\\%$ are acquired, and $16.1\\%$ go public. In contrast, $78.9\\%$ of non-VC-financed firms fail, $1.04\\%$ get acquired, and $0.02\\%$ go public.  \n\nWe also analyze the exit dynamics of VC- and non-VC-financed firms, focusing in particular on failed firms. We find that the cumulative failure rate of VC-financed firms is lower than that of non-VC-financed firms. This difference is driven largely by lower failure rates in the initial years after receiving VC. We do not find evidence that the lower failure rate of VC-financed firms is driven by VC failures being disguised as acquisitions. We do find, however, that the performance difference between VC- and non-VC-financed firms diminishes in the post-internet bubble years, 1998-2000, although it does not disappear. We further examine particular kinds of VCs, for example, high reputation VCs, and do not find evidence that different types of VCs drive the results.  \n\nOur analysis of a large panel data set that contains both VC- and non-VCfinanced firms allows us to better understand some ofthe fundamental features of VC-financed firms. Our findings also raise a number of future research questions. For example, while VC appears to have had a positive effect on firms over the past two decades, have the ways in which VC helps firm performance changed over time? If so, is this due to improved financial contracting or due to other interactive effects of VC?  \n\nInitial submission: May 19, 2008; Final version received: April 17, 2012 Editor: StevenKaplan  \n\n## Appendix A. Identifying VC-Financed Firms in the Longitudinal Business Database and Creating a Matched Sample of VC- and Non-VC-Financed Firms  \n\nIn this appendix we describe how we identify VC-financed firms in the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) by matching it with information from VentureSource and VentureXpert, two proprietary databases on VC deals. We then describe how we create a one-to-one matched sample of VC- and non-VCfinanced firms in the LBD using observable firm characteristics at the time the VC-financed firms receive their first round of VC financing. Finally, we investigate possible sample selection bias between matched and unmatched VC-financed firms in VentureSource and VentureXpert.  \n\n### A.IdentifyingVC-Financed Firms in theLBD  \n\nWe use the union of VentureSource and VentureXpert to identify the set of U.S. companies that receive VC financing between 1981 and 2005. Kaplan, Sensoy, and Stromberg (2002) discuss the relative merits ofthese two databases in recording VC deals. We use both databases to ensure the widest coverage of VC deals in the United States. Since comprehensive coverage ofthe VC industry by these databases does not begin until the 1980s, we focus our analysis on the period 1981-2005, the last year of the LBD, and focus our discussion on VCfinanced firms that first receive VC between 1981 and 2005.  \n\nWe identify 25,747 companies in the union of VentureXpert and VentureSource that first receive VC financing between 1981 and 2005. A little over half of the 25,747 companies are in both databases. Another $10\\%$ are in VentureSource only, and $40\\%$ are in VentureXpert only. We match 20,257 companies to the LBD for a raw match rate of $80\\%$ . According to Census Bureau researchers who regularly engage in name and address matching with Census micro-data sets, our $80\\%$ match rate is as high as what other researchers using these data sets have been able to attain, given the propensity for non-standardized spellings of words and occasional misspellings that appear in U.S. government administrative records data. We first attempt to match on a company's full name and full headquarters address, that is, city, state and zip code. This step results in $68\\%$ of the 20,257 matches we make. If a company matches to multiple firms in the LBD, we use the match that has the smallest difference between the first LBD year and the company founding year, or the year in which the company first receives VC financing if company founding year is missing. We next match companies using their full names and partial addresses, that is, city or zip code (but not both) and state, or state only. We identify $23\\%$ of our  \n\n#### TableAI Matching Criteria and Match Quality between VentureSource/VentureXpert and LBD  \n\nPanel A presents the distribution of frms in the union of VentureSource and VentureXpert that can be matched to the LBD by the matching criteria that matched them to the LBD. The first column presents the distribution for all matched VC-financed firms. The second column presents the distribution for VC-financed firms in the one-to-one matched sample of VC- and non-VCfinanced frms. Panel B presents the average difference between VC-financed firms first year in the LBD and their founding year in VentureSource and VentureXpert by matching criteria. The first column presents averages for all matched VC-financed firms. The second column presents averages for VC-financed firms in the one-to-one matched sample of VC- and non-VC-financed firms.  \n\nPanel B. Average Difference between First LBD Year and VentureSource/VentureXpert Founding Year   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>AllVC-FinancedFirms in LBD (n =17,763)</td><td>VC-FinancedFirmsin Matched Sample (n = 10,349)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Panel A.

Combining these matches withthe $68\\%$ made using full name and full address, we obtain $91\\%$ ofour 20,257 matches using the full name of a company given in both VentureSource and VentureXpert and the LBD and some information from the company's headquarters address.  \n\nWe make the final $9\\%$ of our matches using partial names of companies. Specifically, we match companies using substrings of their full names of length $N$ where $N$ ranges from 20 to 10, and their full or partial address. This step allows us to match companies whose names might have different spellings in VentureSource and VentureXpert and LBD. We identify half of these matches using the company's full address and the other half using partial address information. As before, if a company matches to multiple firms in the LBD we use the match that has the smallest difference between the first LBD year and the company founding year, or the year in which the company first receives VC financing if the company founding year is missing.  \n\nOfthe 20,257 matched firms, 17,763 firms first enter the LBD in 1981 or later and have non-missing industry information in the LBD. We use these 17,763 firms to form the basis of our analysis since we want to track firms from their first year of life in the LBD. The first column in Panel A of Table AI reports the percentage of the 17,763 VC-financed firms with non-missing industry data in the LBD that are matched according to the criteria described above. The majority $(91.7\\%)$ of our VC-financed firms are matched using companies? full names and some information about their headquarters addresses. A sizable portion $(68.7\\%)$ are matched using full company name and full company address.  \n\nTo check the relative quality ofthe matches using partial company names and addresses as compared to matches based on full company names and addresses, we calculate the average difference between a company's first year in the LBD and its founding year as reported in VentureSource and VentureXpert and report this average difference by each matching criterion. The first column in Panel B of Table AI reports these averages. The average difference is similar across matching criteria, approximately 1 year (with a fairly narrow range of 0.8-1.6 years). This suggests that the quality of the matches using the less stringent criteria is not greatly diminished.  \n\n### B. Creating a Matched Sample of VC- and Non-VC-Financed Firms  \n\nFor each of the 17,763 VC-financed firms in the LBD, we identify non-VCfinanced firms that share the same four-digit SIC code, age, geographical region, and number of employees as the VC-financed firms in the year that the VC-financed firms receive their first round of VC.10 Some VC-financed firms have no non-VC-financed matches. Others have multiple non-VC-financed firm matches. We keep only VC-financed firms that have at least one non-VCfinanced matched firm. If there are multiple non-VC-financed firms that match to the same VC-financed firm, we randomly select one of these firms as the VCfinanced firm's matched counterpart. Likewise, if multiple VC-financed firms match to only one non-VC-financed firm, we randomly select a VC-financed firm to form the matched pair of VC- and non-VC-financed firms. This leaves us with a one-to-one matched sample of 10,349 unique VC-financed and 10,349 unique non-VC-financed firms.  \n\nWe also form an alternative matched sample of VC- and non-VC-financed that does not require one-to-one matching. If at least one non-VC-financed firm matches to a VC-financed frm, or vice versa, we keep all VC- and nonVC-financed firms with the same matching criteria, so that the number of VC-financed firms for a given set of match criteria may be greater or less than the number of non-VC-financed firms with the same match criteria. This leads to an unbalanced number of VC- and non-VC-financed firms in the alternative matched sample. We find that our results are robust to analysis of this matched sample. As described in Abadie and Imbens (2006), there are tradeoffs to estimating effects with these two different types of matched samples. We choose to be more conservative and report results using the smaller one-to-one matched sample.  \n\nThe second column in Panel A of Table AI reports the percentage of the 10,349 VC-financed firms in the one-to-one matched sample that were matched to the LBD according to the name-and-address matching criteria described in Section A of this appendix. The percentage of firms that match according to each of the criteria is similar to that for the full sample of 17,763 VC-financed firms in the LBD. In particular, the majority of VC-financed firms in the oneto-one matched sample $(70.9\\%)$ are matched using full name and full address. Another $21.6\\%$ match on full name and partial address, $4.8\\%$ are matched using partial name and full address, and $2.7\\%$ are matched on partial name and partial address.  \n\nThe second column in Panel B of Table AI reports the average difference between the first year in the LBD and the VentureSource and VentureXpert founding year for VC-financed firms in the one-to-one matched sample. The average difference is between 0.2 and 0.7 years across the matching criteria, suggesting that there are no major differences in the quality of matches across criteria for the one-to-one matched sample of VC-financed firms. In addition, the match quality of the one-to-one matched sample appears slightly better than the overall match quality for the larger sample of 17,763 VC-financed firms.  \n\nTable AII presents characteristics ofthe 10,349 VC-financed firms in the oneto-one matched sample. The first panel shows that most firms $(84\\%)$ receiveVc within 3 years of entering the LBD. The second panel reports the number of employees that firms have in the year they receive VC. Most firms $(80\\%)$ have 20 or fewer employees in the year they receive VC. The third panel reports the geographical regions in which firms are located. The largest percentage of firms $(41\\%)$ is located in California.Another $36\\%$ are located on the east cost, in New England, the Mid Atlantic, or the South Atlantic. The remaining $23\\%$ are located in the interior of the United States or in the Pacific Northwest.  \n\n### C. Investigating Possible Sample Selection Bias  \n\nFinally, we investigate the characteristics of the VC-financed firms we study relative to the VC-financed firms in VentureSource and VentureXpert that we are not able to match to the LBD. Note that there are two relevant samples here. The first comprises the 17,763 VC-financed firms in VentureSource and VentureXpert that we were able to match to LBD relative to 7,984 VC-financed firms in VentureSource and VentureXpert that we were not able to match to the LBD. The second sample comprises the 10,349 VC-financed firms in the one-to-one matched sample relative to the characteristics of the remaining 15,398 VC-financed firms in VentureSource and VentureXpert. Most of our results are based on the one-to-one matched sample, so for our purpose this is the most relevant comparison. However, for completeness, we report statistics forboth samples.  \n\nComparing the sample of 17,763 VC-financed firms matched to LBD relative to the remaining 7,984 VC-financed firms in VentureSource and VentureXpert, we find that in general the former firms tend to be more likely to go public $(8.5\\%$ , as reported in Table V, versus $6\\%$ ) and more likely to be acquired $(26.4\\%$ , as reported in Table V, versus $18\\%$ 0. Hence, they are seemingly more successful firms; however, the IPO and acquisition rates of $6\\%$ and $18\\%$ for the unmatched firms are still much higher than those rates for non-VC-financed firms in the LBD, which are $0.02\\%$ in the full sample and $0.14\\%$ in the matched sample for IPOs and $0.85\\%$ in the full sample and $5.7\\%$ in the matched sample for acquisitions. Further, there is little difference in the failure rates as reported by VentureXpert and VentureSource for these two sets of firms. In fact, the reported failure rates are higher for the matched firms $(20\\%)$ than for the unmatched firms $(17\\%)$ according to VentureSource and VentureXpert. Note that these failure rates are those reported in VentureXpert and VentureSource and are therefore lower than those reported in Table V for VC-financed firms matched to the LBD. In addition, both sets of firms receive similar amounts of VC financing in the first round ( $\\$6$ million) and similar cumulative total VC raised, $\\$22$ million for matched firms versus $\\$18$ million for unmatched firms and firms with missing industry data.  \n\nWhen we consider the one-to-one matched sample of 10,349 VC-financed firms relative to the characteristics of the remaining 15,398 VC-financed firms in VentureSource and VentureXpert, we find that the difference between these samples is even smaller. The one-to-one matched sample firms have slightly lower IPO rates, $7.4\\%$ , as reported in Table IX, Panel A, versus $8\\%$ for all other VC-financed firms, and slightly smaller first rounds of financing, $\\$5$ million versus $\\$7$ million, with the cumulative VC amount raised being similar at $\\$21$ million. VC-financed firms in the one-to-one matched sample also have higher acquisition rates, $24.9\\%$ , as reported in Table IX, Panel A, versus $22\\%$ for all other VC-financed firms. The reported failure rates in VentureXpert and VentureSource for the VC-financed firms in the one-to-one matched sample is also higher at $22\\%$ versus $16\\%$ for all other VC-financed firms. Overall, the VC-financed firms in the one-to-one matched sample do not appear any larger or more successful when compared to the VC-financed firms in VentureSource and VentureXpert that are not in the one-to-one matched sample. In fact, by some measures the one-to-one matched VC-financed firms appear to be smaller and less successful than these other VC-financed firms. This suggests that our performance results and the lower failure rates that we observe when we compare VC- and non-VC-financed firms in the matched sample are not biased by examining only the more successful firms in VentureSource and VentureXpert.  \n\n#### TableAII Characteristics of the One-to-One Matched Sample of VC- and Non-VC-Financed Firms  \n\nThe sample includes VC-financed firms that enter the LBD between 1981 and 2005 that first receive VC financing in the year they enter the LBD or in any subsequent year and that can be matched to a non-VC-financed firm that is of the same age, in the same four-digit SIC code, in the same geographical region, and in the same employment size category in the year that the VCfinanced firm has its first round of VC financing. The number and percentage of VC-financed firms in the sample that are matched at a particular age, employment size category, and geographical region are reported. Firm age measures the number of years a firm is in the LBD. A headquarters geographical region is defined as follows. New England is defined by the states ME, VT, NH, MA, CT, and RI. Mid Atlantic is defined by the states NY, PA, and NJ. South Atlantic is defined by the states DE, MD, WV, DC, VA, NC, SC, GA, and FL. East North Central is defined by the states WI, MI, IL, IN, and OH. East South Central is defined by the states KY, TN, MS, and AL. West North Central is defined by the states MN, IA, MO, ND, SD, NE, and KS. West South Central is defined by the states AR, OK, TX, and LA. Mountain is defined by the states MT, ID, WY, NV, UT, CO, AZ, and NM.

Identifying Acquisitions in the LBD  \n\nIn this appendix we describe how we identify acquisitions in the LBD. We first document establishment ownership changes using information contained in the LBD. We classify a firm as acquired if all of its establishments become part of another existing firm as recorded by the LBD. Ownership changes in the LBD are primarily tracked in the years in which the Economic Census is taken, when detailed questions about establishment ownership are asked. Since the Economic Census only occurs every 5 years, many ownership changes may not be recorded if acquired establishments are shut down before the next Economic Census is taken.We therefore use two additional external data sources to identify company acquisitions.  \n\nWe merge the SDC Platinum Mergers and Acquisitions (SDC M&A) database to the LBD to identify acquisition targets in the LBD. We do this using name and address matching similar to that described in Appendix A. Because the SDC M&A database has greater coverage of larger acquisitions and acquisitions by public acquirers, we further augment our search for acquisitions using news articles published between 1981 and 2005 as obtained from Lexis/Nexis. We search all English language newspaper, magazine, newsletter, and news wire articles published between 1981 and 2005 related to M&A events in the United States for the names of all VC-financed companies and non-VC-financed companies in our one-to-one matched sample. Because we cannot remove the names of the VC- and non-VC-financed firms in our sample from the secure Census computer lab to conduct searches using the standard Lexis/Nexis interface, we import all such news articles published between 1981 and 2005 as text files and then search for articles related to companies in our Census sample using Perl code.  \n\nAfter identifying the articles related to the VC- and non-VC-financed firms in our Census sample, we then read each article and tag the articles that inform the reader whether the company in question had in fact been acquired. For companies that are reported to have been acquired, we record the date of the acquisition as reported by the news article. This search and data collection effort took a total of 6 months with the help of 25 research assistants.  \n\nWe combine the information on acquisition events from our Lexis/Nexis searches with the acquisitions identified using the SDC M&A database and LBD-identified ownership changes to arrive at our final set of acquisitions. Without the Lexis/Nexis searches, the majority of acquisitions (around $70\\%$ are identified using the SDC M&A database, highlighting how few acquisitions are recorded in the LBD itself. The acquisition rates are $20\\%$ for VC-backed firms and $4.3\\%$ for non-VC backed firms (as of 2005) when we just use the SDC M&A database and LBD-identified ownership changes. Adding the Lexis/Nexis searches increases the acquisition rates to $25\\%$ for VC-financed firms and $5.7\\%$ for non-VC-financed firms. It is important to note that these acquisition rates reflect right censoring in the data since many of the firms in our sample are started in the late 1990s and early 2000s and not recorded as acquired as of 2005 when our sample ends, even if they are acquired after 2005. If we restrict our sample to firms that first received VC financing before 1998 (or were matched to such a VC-financed firm), we find that $33\\%$ of VC-financed firms and $8.8\\%$ of non-VC-financed firms are acquired. These rates become even higher, between $35\\%$ and $40\\%$ for VC-financed firms, if we restrict our attention to firms that receive VC in 1995 or earlier. These figures are in line with observed acquisition rates of VC-financed firms of $30\\%$ to $50\\%$ 10 years after first receiving VC (for example, Sand Hill Econometrics database).  \n\nUsing Lexis/Nexis news searches to identify acquisitions in the LBD in addition to the SDC M&A database does not have a meaningful impact on the difference in acquisition rates between VC- and non-VC-financed firms, though it does change the overall acquisition rates. Adding the searches increases the set of identified acquisitions for VC-financed firms by $24\\%$ , from 2,074 to 2,574 acquisitions. This corresponds to an increase in the total acquisition rate from $20.0\\%$ to $24.9\\%$ , out of 10,349 VC-financed firms. The Lexis/Nexis searches increase the set of identified acquisitions for non-VC-financed firms by $32\\%$ , from 446 to 587 acquisitions. This corresponds to an increase in the total acquisition rate from $4.3\\%$ to $5.7\\%$ ,out of 10,349 non-VC-financed frms.  \n\n## REFERENCES  \n\nAbadie, Alberto, and Guido W.
