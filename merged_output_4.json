We first establish that managing the inherent tension between cooperation and competition in alliances is essentially a social dilemma, where an individually rational but socially defecting choice may lead to α higher payoff for an individual partner but where, once all partners adopt such α strategy, the alliance will fail. We then develop propositions on how partners can improve their chances for cooperation, and we discuss the limitations of the social dilemma approach and its implications for futureresearch.  \n\nAlliance is a broad term that captures many forms of interorganizational cooperative arrangements, including equity joint ventures, strategic supplier arrangements, research and development partnerships, and so forth (Doz & Hamel, 1998; Koza & Lewin, 1998; Parkhe, 1993). One of the fundamental problems alliances face, especially those alliances involving multiple partners, is the inherent tension between cooperation and competition among partners (Hamel, 1991; Larsson, Bengtsson, Henriksson, & Sparks, 1998; Roehl & Truitt, 1987;Yoshino & Rangan, 1995). On the one hand, an alliance is formed to achieve certain objectives, when doing so is more effective than if any one partner operated independently or through acquisitions. Therefore, without cooperation, partners are unlikely to realize the potential of an alliance. On the other hand, the benefits of alliances are shared among partners, and each partner has α strong incentive to compete for α larger portion of the benefits (Buckley & Casson, 1988; Hamel, 1991; Yoshino & Rangan, 1995). As α result, alliance partners face a constant tension between cooperation and competition.  \n\nRecognizing such inherent tension, alliance researchers have debated a great deal about whether partners should pursue \"stormy open marriages\" (Roehl & Truitt, 1987), learning races (Hamel, 1991), or \"cooperative specialization\" (Zeng & Hennart, 2002). In the majority of the alliance research, scholars have nevertheless tended to emphasize either the cooperative or the competitive side, failing to pay sufficient attention to the complex interactions between cooperation and competition within alliances (e.g., Das & Teng, 2000; Larsson et al., 1998). For example, some authors argue that the essence of alliance management is to work toward harmonious relationships by various means— sharing power, enhancing communication, building trust, and so forth (Harrigan, 1985; Kanter, 1994; Killing, 1983; Lei & Slocum, 1992; Perlmutter & Heenan, 1986)—whereas other authors (Hamel, 1991; Pucik, 1988; Reich & Mankin, 1986) emphasize the learning race view, postulating that alliances are, by nature, competitive collaborations and that partners are involved in α learning race attempting to absorb the capabilities of their alliance partners as fast as possible.  \n\nAlthough these different perspectives have significantly advanced our understanding of the various aspects of partner interactions in alliances, an overarching theoretical framework is needed to guide researchers in studying the complex interdependence between cooperation and competition embedded in multiparty alliances. For example, while trust is essential in promoting cooperation in alliances, an overtrusting partner can become an easy target for exploitation by its greedy partners. Conversely. while α partner might adopt α competitive strategy and get more out of α particular alliance, this could lead to potentially detrimental outcomes for the alliance in the long term should αll partners adopt similar strategies. How should alliance partners choose between cooperation and competition?  \n\nIn this article we propose α social dilemma approach to partnership management in alliances. As illustrated later, we apply the social dilemma theory to study the tension between cooperation and competition among interdependent parties. With this theory we examine the benefits and costs associated with both cooperation and competition, simultaneously, explain the rationales behind both types of behaviors, and investigate the mechanisms that could promote cooperation among the social actors pursuing self-interest. Therefore, the theory provides a comprehensive perspective and better understanding of the challenges alliance partners face in managing the balance between cooperation and competition.  \n\nThe focus of this paper is cooperation' induction among multiparty alliance partners. We focus on partner cooperation, because it has been identified as α necessary condition for alliance success (e.g., Kanter, 1994). Many scholars cite the lack of cooperation as an important cause of the relatively high failure rate of alliances (Park & Russo, 1996; Teece, 1992; Yan & Zeng, 1999), yet there is little systematic investigation of how cooperation can be achieved and sustained in alliances (Arino & de lα Torre, 1998; Doz, 1996). We focus explicitly on multiparty alliances because of their increasing popularity and importance over the last decade (Doz & Hamel, 1998; Makino & Beamish, 1999). For example, Makino and Beamish (1999) found that, of their sample of 737 joint ventures, 55 percent had more than two partners. However, theoretical or empirical research on these alliances remains rather limited (for an exception, see Gomes-Casseres, 1996). By providing the social dilemmα conceptual framework to study the cooperation dilemma partners face in multiparty alliances, we advance our understanding of these important yet underexplored topics.  \n\nIn the following sections we first analyze the mixed motives of competition and cooperation inherent in alliances, and we explain why the social dilemma approach provides an appropriate framework for understanding partner dynamics. Drawing from the social dilemma literature, we then propose various structural and motivational mechanisms that are effective in inducing cooperation among alliance partners. Finally, we discuss the limitations of this approach and its implications for alliance management and research.  \n\n## COOPERATIONDILEMMAINMULTIPARTNER ALLIANCES  \n\nAlliances are formed when there is the potential for joint value creation in combining resources or capabilities from different partners and when it is difficult to exchange these resources or capabilities in the open market (Hennart, 1988; Kogut, 1988). To realize the potential for joint value creation, partners must exchange information, share knowledge, and make investments that are specific to the relationship. Nevertheless, fulfilling these basic requirements of alliances also exposes the valuable investments and proprietary knowledge of partners to opportunistic hazards because of the temptation of each partner to pursue self-interests. (Shuen, 1994).  \n\nThe pursuit of self-interest undermines the value creation process in alliances in two important ways. First, partners bargain over the stream of economic benefits that comes directly from successful value creation in alliances (the \"hold-up problem\"). To avoid being held up by their counterparts, partners often underinvest in alliance-specific assets/skills—α major reason for alliance failures (Doz & Hamel, 1998; Shuen, 1994). Such α risk has been well documented in the literature, where researchers have built mostly on transaction cost economics (Hennart, 1988; Williamson, 1985). Second, partners may intermalize each other's skills and apply them to areas outside the alliance (the \"leakage problem\"; Hamel, 199l; Khannα, Gulati, & Nohriα, 1998). Such leakage can have dire consequences if partners are current or potential competitors. For fear of such risks, partners may overprotect their contributions to the alliance and block the information and knowledge exchange necessary for collective gains by members of the alliance. Therefore, while it is individually rational for each partner to invest less in and gain more from the alliance, such efforts often undermine the foundation of partner cooperation and destroy value creation.  \n\nThe conflict between individual rationality and collective rationality described above is, in fact, the key characteristic of α social dilemma. In theory. α social dilemma is defined by two simple properties: (l) each individual receives α higher payoff for α socially defecting choice than for α socially cooperative choice, no matter what the others do, but (2) all individuals are better off if all cooperate than if all defect (Dawes, 1980). In the alliance context, the dilemma manifests itself in the sense that partners of an alliance face α conflict between maximizing their own self-interest (defection; e.g.. bargain for α larger share of the pie, withhold key information and knowledge or send secondtier employees) and maximizing the interests of the alliance as α whole (cooperation). It is generally more profitable for α partner to defect, but if all do so, all are worse off than if all choose to cooperate. It is clear that, in this case, α shortterm individual partner's self-interested choice, αlbeit rational, will lead to α long-term alliance failure, which therefore poses α social dilemma (Dawes, 1980; Messick & Brewer, 1983; Yamα- gishi, 1986a) for each of the partners.  \n\nIn sum, alliance partners face α social dilemmα in managing the inherent tension between cooperation and competition among themselves. How can partners manage such α dilemma and achieve sustainable cooperation in alliances? In the following sections we first model the cooperation dilemma using the public goods paradigm? and then apply the insights from the social dilemma literature to develop our propositions accordingly.  \n\n### MODELING THE COOPERATION DILEMMAWITH THE PUBLIC GOODS PARADIGM  \n\nThe dilemma nature of cooperation development in alliances can be illustrated further through the following hypothetical example. Consider an alliance consisting of six partners, A, B, C, D, E, and F. The partners estimate that, by combining all their resources, the alliance (public good) will be able to achieve at least twice the total profit volume (benefits associated with the public good) than if each were to work alone. Within the alliance, each partner is motivated to contribute, because the profit will be doubled if all do so. At the same time, however, each partner has an incentive to contribute as little as necessary, because it is possible either that contributions from other partners will be sufficient to double the profits or that, if other partners do not contribute much, goals will not be achieved and the partner's own contribution will be wasted.  \n\nTo simplify the problem, assume that each partner has an equal amount of resource S that will result in an equal amount of profit $P$ if each were to operate independently. Assume also that, if all parties contribute all of their resources, the alliance will make α profit whereby each party will receive 2P. In the typical continuous public goods dilemma,? each partner is free to choose to contribute any amount of its resources (from 0 to S) to the public good. All contributions made to the public good will increase their value (due to synergy), but the total value of the public good will be distributed equally among all partners. Resources kept for oneself, however, will not increase value but will belong only to oneself. Moreover, the higher the total amount of the contribution made to the public good, the higher the amount of profit all will be able to share.  \n\nConsider the AOL alliance with drkoop.com, GTE, US West, Sun, and Nintendo. Six partners are involved in this alliance. Each company has its own expertise (or core competence), technology, customer base, and market share. Except for those contributions that are clearly stipulated in the contracts and, thus, easy to monitor, each partner has some discretion over how much intangible asset to invest in the alliance. The more resources accrued in the alliance, the higher the profit all will be able to share. For our hypothetical example, assume that the amount of resource each partner has is $10(\\mathsf{S}=10)$ ，that the profit each earns when choosing to operate independently is $10(P=10)$ , and that the value for resources contributed to the alliance is doubled. The payoff matrix for this problem is presented in Table l.  \n\nWe can see from Table l that when the alliance is not formed (0, O), each partner has its own payoff of 10, and when all partners contribute all of their resources (10, 10), all receive α payoff of 20, suggesting that the payoff of universal cooperation is higher than that of universal defection. However, no matter what the other partners' average contribution is, the more α partner contributes, the lower the payoff will be for that partner (the payoff of the upper rows is always higher than that of the lower rows), suggesting that the temptation for defection or competition is always embedded in such a situation. This payoff matrix simulates the tension embedded in the multipartner strategic alliance.  \n\nAs we suggested above, the public goods dilemma paradigm can be used to model the cooperation problem in α multipartner alliance. Such modeling, even with rather limiting assumptions, captures the essence of the dilemma nature of partner interactions in alliances and, hence, provides α good starting point toward better understanding intra-alliance dynamics. Naturally, after initial validation of the propositions derived from the model, subsequent research can relax the assumptions and test for generalizability.  \n\nIn previous alliance research, scholars have not explicitly adopted α social dilemma approach, except for the few studies (i.e., Heide & Miner, 1992; Parkhe, 1993) using the prisoners' dilemma game to model the dyadic relationship. However, the iterated two-person prisoners' dilemma is much narrower in scope than the social dilemma and generally cannot represent multipartner alliances (Dawes, 1980; Orbell & Dawes, l98l), for several reasons. First, in the two-person dilemma, all harm of noncooperation (or defection) completely falls on the other  \n\nTABLE1 A Payoff Matrix for a Six-Partner Continuous Public Goods Dilemma   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"6\">MeanContributionofOtherPartners</td></tr><tr><td>YourFirm'sContribution</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>.··</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>10</td><td>11.67</td><td>13.33</td><td>15.0</td><td></td><td>26.67</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>9.33</td><td>11.0</td><td>12.67</td><td>14.33</td><td></td><td>26.0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>8.67</td><td>10.33</td><td>12.0</td><td>13.67</td><td></td><td>25.33</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>8.0</td><td>9.67</td><td>11.33</td><td>13.0</td><td></td><td>24.67</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>**.</td><td>**.</td><td>+++</td><td>**.</td><td>+++</td><td>**.</td></tr><tr><td>+*+ 10</td><td>3.33</td><td>5.0</td><td>6.67</td><td>8.33</td><td></td><td>20.0</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNote: Each member of the six-partner alliance voluntarily contributes 0 to 10 units of its company's resources to the alliance. The total contribution in the alliance earns an interest of 100 percent (value doubled), and the resources not contributed earn no interest. Each partner's total payoff is an equal share from the alliance plus whatever each keeps for its own firm, as shown in the following formular:  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Your}\\mathrm{Firm}^{\\prime}\\mathrm{s}\\mathrm{Pa}\\mathrm{yof}\\mathrm{f}=(\\mathrm{10}-C)+2[(n-1)M C+C]/n\n$$  \n\nwhere C denotes your firm's contribution, n denotes the total number of partners in the alliance (six in this case), and MC denotes the mean contribution of other partners.  \n\nplayer; hence, harm is focused rather than spread out, whereas in multipartner alliances, gain for noncooperation accrues directly to the self, while harm is diffused over α considerable number of partners. Thus, α partner in the multipartner situation will feel less guilt toward any particular partner when choosing not to cooperate and, in turn, will be more likely to defect than α partner in the two-party situation.  \n\nSecond, in α multipartner strategic alliance, one partner's noncooperative behavior is more likely to be kept anonymous than it is in the two-person dilemma. In other words, partners may not easily detect who did what in the multipartner situation, whereas in the two-person dilemma, there is much less uncertainty about the other partner's behavior. As α result, α partner in the multiparty situation will have α stronger incentive to defect than α partner in the two-party situation, because it is easier to get away with defection.  \n\nFinally, in the iterated two-person dilemma, each player can \"punish\" (or \"reward\") the other for noncooperation (or cooperation) by choosing noncooperation (or cooperation) in the subsequent interaction. Thus, each player can attempt to shape the other's behavior and, hence, indirectly determine the alliance outcome through the choice of his or her own action. This degree of \"influence potential\" in the two-person iterated dilemma is clearly diluted in the multiplayer case, where it is much harder for cny single player to shape the group dynamics effectively, unless there is α clear, dominant player. This sense of lack of controllability of others' behavior and, thus, of the alliance outcome is more likely to increase the defective behavior of α partner in the multiplayer situation than in the two-party situation.  \n\nOwing to the specificity of harm, better knowledge of partner behavior, and higher potential use of one's own behavior to shape the other's behavior, α two-person iterated prisoners' dilemma cannot be considered representative of the multipartner problem. On the contrary, it is only α special case of the social dilemma (when $\\displaystyle n=2,$ . Therefore, while the mechanisms effective in solving the multipartner problem can be applied in the two-partner case, the reverse does not hold. We further elaborate the implications of such differences between two-person prisoners' dilemma and social dilemma for alliance management in the Propositions section.  \n\n### SOLUTIONS DERIVED FROM THE SOCIAL DILEMMARESEARCH  \n\nAfter several decades of research on social dilemmas (Komorita & Parks, 1995; Messick & Brewer, 1983; Olson, 1965; Pruitt & Kimmel, 1977), researchers have suggested and tested numerous solutions in different experimental and empirical settings. A distinction is often made between structural and motivational solutions (for an extensive review, see Komorita & Parks, 1994; Messick & Brewer, 1983; and Yamagishi, 1986a). Generally speaking, structural solutions focus on the effects of the structural (or technical) parameters of the dilemma (e.g., payoff matrix, group size) on individual behavior. They include (1) changing the structure of the payoff matrix (Dawes, Orbell, Simmons, & van de Kragt, 1986; Komorita, Chan, & Parks, 1993; Marwell & Ames, 1979, 1980; Rapoport, 1967). (2) introducing sanction systems (Caldwell, 1976; Chen & Yao, 2003; McCusker & Carnevale, 1995; Yamagishi, $1986\\mathrm{{a};}$ Yamagishi & Sato, 1986), (3) reducing group size (Fox & Guyer, 1977; Komorita & Lapworth, 1982), or (4) changing allocation rules (Chen, 1999; Rapoport & Amaldoss, 1999).  \n\nMotivational solutions, however, focus on changing partners' perceptions of the social environment (e.g., expectations of other partners' behavior; feelings of group identity, trust, selfefficacy), and therefore their motivation for cooperation. These solutions include (l) introducing face-to-face discussion of the dilemma before making contribution decisions (Bouas & Komorita, 1996; Dawes, McTavish, & Shaklee, 1977: Edney & Harper, 1978a,b; Jerdee & Rosen, 1974; Kerr & Kaufman-Gilliland, 1994; van de Kragt, Orbell, & Dawes, 1983), (2) establishing long-term goals, or \"extending the shadow of the future\" (Axelrod, 1984; Axelrod & Dion, 1988), and (3) informing partners about the negative consequences of defective actions (Alock & Mansell, 1977; Caldwell, 1976; Edney & Harper, 1978b).  \n\nThe fundamental difference between these two types of solutions lies in the degree to which α solution is associated with actual, tangible changes in α partner's payoff. With structural solutions, on the one hand, any changes in the parameters of the dilemma structure will lead to α change in α partner's payoff for cooperation; therefore, cooperation induced by structural changes will have \"instrumental\" value. For example, partners will be willing to contribute more to the alliance when the payoff for cooperation is enlarged. On the other hand, motivational solutions are not directly related to any tangible changes in one's payoff. For example, α partner that feels its contribution to be crucial to the alliance will be more willing to contribute, even though doing so will not necessarily enlarge its own material payoff.  \n\nIn applying the solutions derived from the social dilemma research, much of which is conducted at the individual level, to interorganizational relationships, we see α levels issue arise (Klein, Dansereau, & Hall, 1994). In this article we treat each alliance partner as an \"individuαl\" player in α social dilemma. That is, even though each partner is composed of numerous members, we assume that all members are sufficiently similar with respect to the constructs we consider that they can be characterized as α whole (Klein et al., 1994). According to Schneider's (1987) Attraction-Selection-Attrition (ASA) framework, people who \"fit in\" the organizationαl environment are more likely to remain α member, whereas people who do not \"fit in\" are more likely to depart from the organization. The developing literature on shared mental models (e.g., Mathieu, Heffner, Goodwin, Salas, & Cannon-Bowers, 2000) and on transactive memory in groups (e.g., Liang, Moreland, & Argote, 1995) also suggests that members of groups or organizations indeed develop shared images. For example, the degree of organizational identification may vary among employees within the same organization, but such variance will be smaller than that among employees in different organizations. Research has demonstrated that constructs such as trust, learning, justice, and identity are all meaningful at the organizational level (Gulati, 1995; Naumann & Bennett, 2000; Ring & Van de Ven, 1994; Senge, 1990).  \n\nMoreover, because the key issue addressed in social dilemma research (i.e., the tension between cooperation and competition) is rather general, and because the analytic tools used are often abstract, there has been α long history of applying the social dilemma framework to multiple levels. For example, this framework has been used in studying the arms race between countries (Osgood, 1962; Pilisuk, 1984; Pilisuk, Potter, Rapoport, & Winter, 1965; Pilisuk & Skolnick, 1968; Rapoport, 1960, 1964), internα- tional conflicts (e.g., Brams & Kilgour, 1988), negotiation between groups (McCallum et al.,  \n\n1985), governmental decisions regarding federal intervention into the marketplace (Inman, 1987), and provision of financial welfare systems (Buchanan, 1975; Kotlikoff, 1987). More recently. Cable and Shane (1997) used this framework to analyze the relationship between entrepreneurs and venture capital firms. In this article we are consistent with previous work in applying the conceptual framework derived from the social dilemma literature to alliance contexts.  \n\n### PROPOSITIONS  \n\nAccumulated research in social dilemma theory indicates that the most robust solution under the structural approach is changing the payoff matrix, whereas the most robust solutions under the motivational approach are enhancing communication and establishing long-term goals among partners (for α review, see Kollock, 1998; Komorita & Parks, 1995; Ledyard, 1995; and Messick & Brewer, 1983). In this article we focus on these solutions in making our propositions. Figure l summarizes the social dilemma theoretical framework and the various propositions derived from this framework.  \n\n#### Structural Solution: Changing the Payoff Matrix  \n\nThe payoff matrix of a social dilemma can be changed in many ways, while still maintaining its structure under the constraints of α dilemma (Dawes, 1980). One of the most robust indices of α payoff matrix is the $\\mathtt{K}^{\\prime}$ -index (Komorita, 1976). This $\\mathtt{K}^{\\prime}$ -index for an $_{n}$ -person social dilemma can be calculated by the following formula:  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}=(C_{n}-D_{0})/(D_{n-1}-C_{1})\n$$  \n\nwhere $C_{n}$ denotes the payoff when all partners cooperate, $D_{0}$ denotes the payoff when no one cooperates, $D_{n\\mathrm{~-~}1}$ denotes the payoff for α competitive choice when $n-1$ other partners cooperate, and $C_{1}$ denotes the payoff for α cooperative choice when all other partners defect.  \n\nTherefore, in the continuous public goods payoff matrix presented in Table 1, ${\\bf K}^{\\prime}=(20-10)/$ $(26-4)=0.45$ . According to Komorita (1976), for any given $\\boldsymbol{n}$ -person social dilemma, the value of $\\mathtt{K}^{\\prime}$ ranges from 0 to 1.0, and the incentive to cooperate increases directly with the magnitude of $\\mathtt{K}^{\\prime}$ . Therefore, people will be more willing to cooperate in high $\\mathtt{K}^{\\prime}$ games than in low $\\mathtt{K}^{\\prime}$ games. In extreme cases there is no incentive to cooperate when ${\\tt K}^{\\prime}=0$ and no incentive to defect when $\\tt K^{\\prime}=1.0$ . This index has received strong empirical support (Komorita et al., 1993; Komorita, Sweeney, & Kravitz, 1980).  \n\n![](images/a252afcb4e5188afc6de58788e9d0b04b268520c758655c184b8190e1c784111.jpg)  \n\nThe $\\mathtt{K}^{\\prime}$ -index suggests that changing the payoff matrix to increase the value of $\\mathtt{K}^{\\prime}$ will make alliance partners more willing to cooperate. From the formula above, there are at least four relevant payoffs: for (l) universal cooperation $(C_{n})$ , (2) universal defection $(D_{0})$ , (3) single defection $(D_{n\\mathrm{~-~}1})$ . αnd (4) single cooperation $(C_{1})$ . Keeping everything else constant, the value of $\\mathtt{K}^{\\prime}$ will be increased if $C_{n}$ or $C_{1}$ is increased, or if $D_{0}$ or $D_{n\\mathrm{~-~}1}$ is decreased. To apply these notions in the alliance context, we can see that if all partners can gain α bigger benefit when they pool their resources than when they are on their own (i.e., if $C_{n}\\mathrm{~-~}D_{0}$ is larger), they will be more likely to cooperate. In other words, if the potential gains from joining forces are larger, such as when partners have different but complementary contributions to an alliance, there is α stronger \"pull\" for partners to cooperate (Doz & Hamel, 1998; Geringer, 1989; Harrigan, 1985; Lyles, 1994; Park & Russo, 1996; Saxton, 1997). Based on this reasoning, we offer our first proposition.  \n\nProposition l: The larger the difference between the payoff for universal cooperation and the payoff for universal defection, the more likely alliance partners will cooperate with each other.  \n\nMoreover, deriving from the formula, if little benefit is associated with the single defection behavior $(D_{n\\mathrm{~-~}1})$ and little risk is involved in the single cooperation situation $(C_{1})$ : partners will be more willing to cooperate. Borrowing Coombs' (l973) terminology and Rapoport's (1967) paradigm, reducing the value of $D_{n\\mathrm{~-~}1}$ (e.g., reducing the extra payoff for keeping one's own resource) is α way to reduce one's \"greed\"—a concept referring to one's motive to exploit by not contributing when the majority of the others do. And an increase in $C_{1}$ (e.g., reducing the loss of one's contribution when the public good is not provided) is a way to reduce one's \"fear\"—fear of being exploited or having one's resources or capabilities wasted when one contributes but the majority of others do not. In the social dilemma literature, the effects of greed and fear have been studied extensively, and there is α strong consensus that people are more willing to contribute when greed or fear is minimized (Dawes et al., 1986; Komorita et al., 1980; Rapoport & Eshed-Levy, 1989; Yamagishi & Sato, 1986).  \n\nIn the alliance context, partner greed is α major concern when hold-up is a serious problem. Partners who invest in alliance-specific assets are afraid that their partners may become greedy and take advantage of their vulnerable position because of their sunken investment in the alliance. Fear is also α serious concern when the leakage problem is α real threat. Partners often become overprotective of their contributions to the alliance for fear of those contributions being stolen by other partners to use against them outside the alliance.  \n\nAn important mechanism for minimizing greed is creating universal hostages by forcing partners to make significant investments specific to the alliance (Holm, Eriksson, & Johanson, 1999; Koss & Curtis, 1997). Such hostages can \"tie their hands to each other\" (Schelling. 1960) and \"equilibrate the opportunistic hazards\" (Shuen, 1994). The mechanisms to minimize fear can range from choosing noncompetitors as partners to isolating alliance activities from other competing businesses to consolidating related businesses of partners into the alliance (Doz, 1996; Kale, Singh, & Perlmutter, 2000; Khannα, 1998; Makhija & Ganesh, 1997). For example, Shin Caterpillar Mitsubishi, the joint venture between Caterpillar and Mitsubishi, experienced serious difficulties in its initial stage, because both parties had independent hydraulic excavator businesses that competed against one another. Cooperation took off after the partners combined their hydraulic excavator businesses within the joint venture, which became responsible for the design, production, and marketing of hydraulic excavators for both partners (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995: 212-215).  \n\nAnother important mechanism for increasing cooperation is using the so-called black box approach, in which intermediate products incorporating partners' contributions are transferred to each other without revealing the underlying know-how. This approach has been found to significantly mitigate the risk of leakage (Baughn, Denekamp, Stevens, & Osborn, 1997; Lorange & Roos, 1992; Scarbrough, 1995). In fact, this was an important design principle for one of the most successful alliances, GE-SNECMA, α joint venture between GE and SNECMA that has become α dominant player in aircraft engine production (Doz, 1996; Dussauge & Garrette, 1999). While GE contributes its expertise in designing and manufacturing the engine core and the combustion chamber, SNECMA is responsible for the lowpressure turbine, the fan, and the lubrication and fuel systems. The interface is set up in Q way that does not reveal the underlying competences of either partner. For example, to protect GE's sensitive technology, the engine core manufactured by GE is sealed before being shipped to SNECMA for assembly (Doz, 1996; Dussauge & Garrette, 1999). Controlling greed and fear is thus crucial for promoting cooperation among partners.  \n\nProposition 2: The lower the threat of greed or fear, the more likely alliance partners will cooperate with each other.  \n\n#### Motivational Solution I: Improving Communication Among Partners  \n\nWhile structural solutions can be effective in solving the alliance dilemma, they involve high costs. For example, α separate monitoring or surveillance system may be needed to create universal hostages within the alliance. The consolidation of partners' related businesses into the alliance also requires extra monitoring and coordinating. Motivation-based methods, however, can potentially offer more cost-effective solutions to improve cooperation.  \n\nEnhancing communication among partners is one such example of α cost-effective solution (e.g., Bouas & Komorita, 1996; Chen, 1996; Dawes et al.,1977; Kerr & Kaufman-Gilliland, 1994; van de Kragt et al., 1983). Social dilemmα research has consistently shown that allowing communication (mainly face-to-face discussion) increases cooperation dramatically. For example, in Dawes et al's (l977) study of the effects of discussion, the researchers found α 70 percent cooperation rate in groups with discussion but only $\\texttt{a}30$ percent cooperation rate in nodiscussion groups.  \n\nOther researchers have obtained similar results regarding the effects of face-to-face communication (Bouas & Komorita, 1996; Chen, 1996; van de Kragt et al., 1983). Moreover, studies of the effect of other forms of communication—for example, written message only or computermediated communication only (e.g., Chen & Komorita, 1994; Pilisuk & Skolnick, 1968)—als0 showed significantly increased cooperation. A direct implication of this effect for alliance management is to improve communication among partners.  \n\nProposition 3: The higher the level of communication among them, the more likely alliance partners will cooperatewitheachother.  \n\nThe communication effect is well accepted in the alliance literature (Doz, 1996; Kanter, 1994), but we know much less about the underlying mechanisms that account for such behavioral changes. The social dilemma literature has offered many explanations for the communication effect.  \n\nOne such explanation is that group discussion of the dilemmα helps people understand the nature of the dilemma better so that all realize the negative consequences associated with universal defection and the positive outcomes of universal cooperation (Dawes, 1980). Another explanation is the normative influence (Deutsch & Gerard, 1955) generated through discussion—that is, discussing the dilemma provides information on what choices others in the group say they are willing to make, thus establishing group norms and introducing conformity pressures in favor of collective choices. A third explanation is the trust developed through discussion and interaction. Talking about decisions may cause group members to believe that others are committed to making cooperative choices, and enhanced trust, in turn, reduces the perceived risk involved in making cooperative choices oneself (Messick & Brewer, 1983). The fourth explanation is the group identity hypothesis (Dawes, van de Kragt, & Orbell, 1988), which states that group discussion induces positive attitudes toward the group (group identity) and creates a sense of cohesion that increases the probability group members will take group interest into account when making their own decisions. And the fifth explanation is related to the perceived impact (or perceived criticality. sense of efficacy) of one's contribution in establishing and maintaining the public good or in influencing other members' behavior (Chen, Au,  \n\n& Komorita, 1996; Kerr, 1989, 1992; Sweeney, 1973;   \nvan de Kragt et al., 1983).  \n\nWhile it may be the case that all of these mechanisms take effect at the same time during group discussion of the dilemma, it is conceivable that each of the mechanisms may, on its own, induce cooperation.4 In studies testing these hypotheses through means other than face-to-face discussion, directly or indirectly, researchers found the following results.  \n\nFirst, regarding the \"normative influence\" hypothesis, research indicates that while α competitive norm is likely to increase members' defecting choices Jerdee & Rosen, 1974; Pillutla & Chen, 1999), α cooperative norm does not always increase cooperation. Instead, whether it will increase cooperative or defecting choices depends on how much α member identifies with the group (Chen, 1997) or what cultural context the member lives in (Chen, Wasti, & Triandis, 2003).  \n\nSecond, studies of the \"group identity\" hypothesis show mixed results. Although researchers found that members who highly identified with their group tended to contribute more, the high contribution was often the result of the interaction between high group identity and some other factor, such as perceived group consensus or self-efficacy (Bouas & Komorita, 1996; Chen, 1996; Kerr & Kaufman-Gilliland, 1994), suggesting that group identity may not be sufficient but is necessary in inducing cooperation in social dilemmas.  \n\nThird, the \"perceived impact\" hypothesis, unlike the other two, has received significant support from empirical research. For instance, Kerr (1992) found that the perceived impact induced by allocating more weight to α particular member's input increased this individual's contribution. Chen et al. (1996) also found that perceived criticality mediated the relationship between objective criticality and cooperation.  \n\nThere are many ways to promote α cooperative norm, to build high group identification within the alliance, or to increase the perceived impact of each partner's contribution. For example, partners can choose to make their promises (cooperative ones) public so as to induce the perception of α cooperative group norm (for details, see Orbell, van de Kragt, & Dawes, 1988). They also can make α unilateral commitment to signal their willingness to cooperate (Gulati, Khanna, & Nohria, 1994). For instance, in an R&D alliance, one partner gave its counterpart the résumés of all fifty of its development engineers and then let its partner select ten engineers that it considered best suited for the alliance and decide how to deploy them (Gulati et al., 1994: 65). When the majority of the partners do this, α cooperative norm will be established within the αlliance.  \n\nOne effective way to build identity with the alliance is to make all partners aware of interalliance competition (Bornstein, 1992; Tajfel & Turner, 1979)—for example, several other alliances with similar products are competing for market share—so as to create the feeling that all partners within the alliance share α common fate. It has been shown that partners facing the same enemies are more likely to cooperate (Gomes-Casseres, 1996; Hamel, 1991).  \n\nFurthermore, to increase the level of perceived impact, an alliance should keep alliance size relatively small by accepting only highly qualified partners or by dividing into many small suballiances to make decisions (Kerr, 1989). One reason for the demise of Iridium, Motorola's ambitious project for mobile satellite communication,had to do with the difficulties Motorola encountered in trying to gain support from many partners who did not feel that their contributions could make α difference to the alliance (Finkelstein & Sanford, 2000).  \n\nThese arguments can be summarized in the following propositions.  \n\nProposition 4a: Alliance partners will be less likely to cooperate with each other when they perceive a competitive rather than α cooperative norm within the alliance.  \n\nProposition 4b: Alliance partners will be less likely to cooperate with each other when they have a low rather than α high level of identification with the alliance.  \n\nProposition 4c: Alliance partners will be more likely to cooperate with each other when they perceive α high rather than a low impact of their contribution on alliance success.  \n\n#### Motivational Solution Il: Establishing LongTerm Goals Among Partners  \n\nAxelrod (1984) proposed increasing cooperation among partners by extending \"the shadow of the future\" after he conducted and analyzed a computer tournament in the two-person prisoners' dilemma. In other studies scholars have also shown that when the time frame is short— for example, when people play α one-trial game—they are more likely to defect than when they play α multitrial game (α longer time frame). Moreover, people tend to defect more when they know that it is the last trial of the game than when they have no such knowledge (Andreoni & Miller, 1993; Luce & Raiffa, 1957).  \n\nWhy might α longer time horizon be effective in enhancing cooperation among partners? First, according to the goal/expectation theory proposed by Pruitt and Kimmel, cooperation often results from long-term thinking that aims \"to achieve the goal of establishing and/or maintaining continued cooperation\" (1977: 375). As suggested by repeated research findings, cooperation generally increases after an initial decline, and the shift from short-term thinking to long-term thinking usually occurs when partners realize the importance of cooperation through the experience of the undesirable consequences of defection (getting to an understanding of the advantages and disadvantages associated with cooperation and defection). In other words, it takes time for all partners to fully understand the nature of the game.  \n\nSecond, in α long-term relationship. partners are more likely to have opportunities to reciprocate other partners' behavior. For example, partners can retaliate against defection behaviors in order to make others realize that exploitative behavior cannot continue forever, because other partners will not unilaterally cooperate for α long time. They also can encourage others to cooperate by cooperating first or reacting with immediate cooperation when others are doing so.  \n\nThird, α longer time horizon provides more opportunities to develop trust among alliance partners. As pointed out by Boyle and Bonacich (1970), trust in dilemma situations develops from α sequence of interactions that reveals or discloses the motives and intentions of other players.  \n\nFinally, α longer time horizon imposes more intangible costs related to noncooperative behaviors, such as reputation loss, future partnership loss, and so on. Hence, establishing α longer time horizon for alliances promotes cooperation between partners. For example, Heide and Miner (1992) surveyed α sample of 155 purchasing agents and 60 suppliers and found that extending the anticipated interactions, increasing the frequency of contact, and making one's behavior more transparent could all effectively extend the \"shadow of the future\" and promote buyer-seller cooperation. Parkhe (1993) also found, in α survey of senior executives involved in joint ventures, that long time horizons and frequent interactions reduced opportunistic behaviors among partners and improved joint venture performance.  \n\nProposition 5: Alliance partners will be more likely to cooperate with each other when they perceive a long-term rather than α short-term goal within the alliance.  \n\nThe reasoning above indicates two common hypotheses introduced earlier—namely. the \"understand the nature of the dilemma\" and the \"trust\" hypotheses. Understanding the dilemma nature of an alliance is important in evoking partners' cooperation, because alliance partners might not realize that they are in α dilemma situation. They may be equipped with the \"cooperating\" spirit when joining the alliance and later get frustrated when observing others' shirking behavior, or they may enter alliances prepared to see self-protecting behavior from other partners and, thus, may be unwilling to make significant contributions to the alliance (i.e., the racing view). Becoming informed about the complex dilemma nature of the alliance can (1) get every partner's understanding along the same line, (2) help partners see the whole picture (both advantages and disadvantages) of cooperation and competition, and (3) reinforce the desirable outcome of universal cooperation (i.e., alliance success) and the undesirable outcome of universal competition (i.e., alliance failure).  \n\nDilemma research has shown that informing people about the negative consequences of defective actions or helping them focus on the positive outcomes of cooperative actions increases cooperation (Alock & Mansell, 1977; Caldwell, 1976; Edney & Harper, 1978b). Partners having more experience with alliances tend to understand the dilemma nature of alliances better, and they do better promoting cooperation among partners. Corning Inc. has been exemplary in this regard, successfully managing dozens of alliances over α long time period. Companies entering alliances with the mindset of \"creating α win-win situation\" rather than \"winning the learning race\" have α higher chance of success (Arino & de lα Torre, 1998; Doz & Hamel, 1998).  \n\nProposition 6: The better they understand thesocial dilemmanatureof the alliance, the more likely alliance partners will cooperate with each other.  \n\nDespite the intuitive appeal of the trust hypothesis, studies testing it have shown mixed results. On the one hand, researchers have found that people who have high levels of trust toward others are more likely to cooperate (Bates, 1979; Caldwell, 1976; Messick et al., 1983). On the other hand, researchers have also found that unconditional trust—\"no matter what others do, I cooperate\"—exhibited by one member generated less cooperation than conditional trust—\"I cooperate if you do, or I cooperate first, then cooperate only when you do so\" (Axelrod, 1984; Messick, 1994). These results seem to suggest that the usual belief that \"trust breeds trust\" or \"trust breeds cooperation\" is probably inadequate in capturing the complexity of the social dilemma situation (Lewicki, McAllister, & Bies, 1998). High levels of trust demonstrated through unconditional cooperation in α social dilemma can generate two types of attributions: trustworthiness or irresponsiveness (or stupidity). If this trust generates the former, cooperation will likely follow; if it generates the latter, then this trust is more likely to be taken advantage of. Trust demonstrated through conditional cooperation leaves room for only one attribution—that is, trustworthiness (\"this partner can be counted on if I choose to cooperate\"). This is likely to be the case when partners behave according to the reciprocity principle (Gouldner, 1960; Kogut, 1989)—that is, they cooperate first and then are responsive to other partners' behavior so as to \"reward\" cooperation by cooperation and \"punish\" defection by defection.  \n\nA typical example of the reciprocity principle—the tit-for-tat (TFT) strategy in α two-person dilemma—has been demonstrated as the most effective in inducing cooperation among numerous competing strategies, including \"cooperating all the time\" or \"defecting all the time\" (Axelrod, 1984; Axelrod & Dion, 1988). Although in α multipartner alliance it becomes harder to figure out the strategy of any one partner, or to detect who is cheating or distinguish cheating from honest mistakes, researchers (e.g., Komorita, Parks, & Hulbert, 1992) have shown that the larger the proportion of group members who use α reciprocal strategy, the greater the likelihood other members will cooperate.  \n\nProposition 7: Alliance partners will be more likely to cooperate with each other when more partners in the alliance use the reciprocity principle in interaction with other partners.  \n\nSo far, we have discussed the main structural and motivational solutions for increasing cooperation in multipartner alliances. However, structural and motivational solutions complement each other, and the mechanisms discussed above sometimes interact with one another. As we discussed earlier, for example, trust may be developed when partners frequently communicate as well as when they establish α long-term goal for the alliance. In turn, trust building may also reduce partners' \"greed\" and \"fear\" in cooperating.  \n\nMoreover, enlarging the difference between the payoff for universal cooperation and universal defection may increase the trust level, because the advantage of cooperation is made so salient. This is consistent with Das and Teng's view (2000) that trust and control are both important in inducing cooperation among alliance partners. Yamagishi (1986b) once proposed α structural goal/expectation theory to promote the simultaneous use of structural and motivational approaches. Chen (1999) also advocated α combined approach to social dilemmas—that is, starting from structural changes to understand motivational changes or starting from motivational solutions to find effective structural changes.  \n\nIt is important to note that the propositions developed in this article should apply equally to multipartner and dyadic alliances. However, because of the three major differences between these two types of alliances, as discussed earlier—namely, more diffused harm, higher anonymity of individual action, and the lack of controllability of others' behavior in the multipartner situation—it is generally more difficult to induce cooperation from partners in the multiplayer than in the two-party situation. Moreover, norms and identities are likely to exert more substantial effects on partner behavior in the multipartner situation than in the two-party situation. For example, in the two-party situation, it is the other party's behavior that determines the focal party's perception and behavior, which do not involve norms or identities. In the multipartner situation, however, the focal party's perception is not likely to be determined by one particular party's behavior; rather, the focal party forms its perception based on the majority or a few partners' past behavior and then behaves according to its general perceptions of the norm within the alliance, the cohesiveness of the alliance, or its own potential influence on other partners' behaviors. We summarize these insights in our final proposition.  \n\nProposition 8: Establishing α cooperα- tive norm, creating high identification with the alliance, increasing the level of individual partner's perceived impact, developing optimal trust, and making each partner's action identifiable will be more important in promoting cooperation in multipartner than in two-partner alliances.  \n\n### DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS  \n\nIn this article we make three major contributions to the alliance literature. First, unlike in most of the previous alliance research investigating why organizations form partnerships and how partners choose among different governance forms (such as equity versus nonequity alliances), we focus on the crucial yet long overlooked question of how partners achieve and sustain cooperation after an alliance is established (Doz, 1996; Koza & Lewin, 1998; Osborn & Hagedoorn, 1997). In addition, we explore this issue in the context of multiparty alliances—a form of alliance that is growing both in number and in importance but that has received limited theoretical and empirical treatment.  \n\nSecond, we provide α conceptual framework that is particularly suited to studying this fundamental cooperation dilemmα facing alliance partners. Although the current dominant theories on alliances, such as transaction cost economics, organizational learning, and resource dependence theories, have greatly enhanced our understanding of the alliance phenomenon, they lack α comprehensive grasp of the complex interdependence between cooperation and competition among alliance partners. The social dilemmα literature, however, has been developed to understand why and how cooperation can emerge among self-interest-pursuing social actors.  \n\nIn Table 2 we compare the social dilemma approach with some dominant theories in alliance research on four aspects: key ideas, analytical unit, research methodology, and disciplinary foundations. The transaction cost economics literature investigates when an alliance is an appropriate governance form to organize interorganizational relationships. Organizational learning theory focuses on how organizations can use alliances to reduce the uncertainties and resource dependencies they are facing. The strategic management literature emphasizes how parent organizations can use alliances to gain market power or competitive advantages. We can see, from this comparison, that only the social dilemma approach focuses explicitly on the dynamic interactions among alliance partners.  \n\nThe social dilemma approach, however, is consistent with other theoretical perspectives on alliances. For example, some of the structural solutions we have proposed in this paper, such as using α universal hostage to minimize greed, are consistent with α transaction cost reasoning (Williamson, 1985), while the motivational solutions seem to echo the recent relational view of alliances (Dyer & Singh, 1998; Kale et al., 2000). Therefore, the social dilemma approach provides α platform for constructive dialogues among proponents of different theoretical perspectives on alliances and helps to pave the way for α truly multitheory and multilevel understanding of alliances (Inkpen, 1995; Koza & Lewin, 1998; Osborn & Hagedoorn, 1997).  \n\nThird, the social dilemma approach not only provides theoretical underpinnings for some fα- miliar yet underdeveloped concepts in the alliance literature but also offers fresh insights on partnership management in alliances. For example, better communication has long been recognized as one of the most important factors for alliance success (Kanter, 1994), but researchers knew little about why and how communication works. The social dilemma literature helps us to understand how better communication can lead to α higher perceived impact of one's contribution to an alliance, to α stronger group identity with the alliance, and to α better understanding of the nature of the dilemma, all of which,in turn, promote cooperation among partners. Meanwhile, the discussion on how partners can enhance cooperation by minimizing the threat of fear and greed provides fresh insights on partnership management.  \n\nTABLE2 Comparison of Major Theoretical Approaches to Alliancesa   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Comparison Categories</td><td>Transaction Cost Economics</td><td>Organizational Learning/Resource Dependence</td><td>Strategic Management</td><td>SocialDilemma</td></tr><tr><td>Major contributors</td><td>Williamson (1985), Hennart (1988)</td><td>Pfeffer&Salancik (1978),Hamel (1991)</td><td>Killing (1983), Kogut (1988), Harrigan (1988)</td><td>No explicit application to alliance yet</td></tr><tr><td>Key ideas</td><td>Choosing the right governancemode to minimize transaction costs</td><td>Developing capabilities, reducing risk and dependence</td><td>Enhancing market power and competitive advantage</td><td>Inducing cooperation among self- interest-</td></tr><tr><td>Analytic unit</td><td>Dyad</td><td>Focal firm</td><td>Focal firm</td><td>pursuing partners Multipartner</td></tr><tr><td>Methodology</td><td>Large sample study</td><td>Case, large sample study</td><td>Case, large sample study</td><td>Modeling. experiment, case, large</td></tr><tr><td>Disciplinary foundation</td><td>Economics</td><td>Sociology/OB</td><td>Strategy (economics and</td><td>sample study Social psychology</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nα We make the distinction between social dilemma theory and game theory despite the fact that public goods dilemma is sometimes categorized as one type of game theory. Game theory is the term used by economists, who often assume that people are rational and thus focus on developing strategies to win the game and structural solutions to the problem. Social dilemma, however, is α term proposed by social psychologists, who assume that people are not always rational and that psychological factors play an important role in determining behavior. Therefore, they emphasize both motivational oand structuralsolutions.  \n\n#### Limitations of the Social Dilemma Approach and Directions for Future Research  \n\nThe limitations of the social dilemma approach stem from the assumptions underlying the public goods paradigm used in this paper. First, there is the assumption that every partner holds an equal amount of resource to be contributed to the alliance and that all are free to choose any amount for contribution, both of which lead to the second assumption, which is that every partner shares an equal power in determining and influencing the alliance outcome. Third is the assumption that there is α symmetrical payoff for every partner under the condition of cooperation or defection, and, fourth, that all partners make decisions simultaneously. Last, there is the assumption that values accrued in the alliance are equally shared by all partners, regardless of their respective input.  \n\nObviously, these assumptions make the public goods paradigm an abstract and simplified form of the dilemma, which may not fit the characteristics of various alliances. For example, alliances often involve α core member (or leading partner) who contributes more, takes more responsibility in establishing the alliance, and is entitled to benefit more from the alliance. In this case, the leading partner undoubtedly has more power than others in influencing the alliance outcome and likely gains more than other partners from the alliance. The payoff matrix we describe in Table l, thus, will not apply in this case, because it violates several assumptions discussed above.  \n\nNevertheless, even in such cases, the fundamental tension between cooperation and defection (or competition) exists. The leading partner still relies on other partners' contributions to make the alliance work. If other partners contribute inadequately, the alliance may fail, and the leading partner's investment will be wasted. The research findings on the impact of control structures on performance by Bleeke and Ernst (1993) seem to support this assertion. They found that alliances with one dominant company had α lower success rate (3l percent) than those with even split ownership (60 percent), because, in the latter cases, partners were more likely to have α cooperative mindset.  \n\nIn any event, we use the public goods paradigm as α starting point to simplify the modeling. Other research paradigms with more relaxed assumptions (e.g., social dilemmas with an asymmetrical payoff matrix or sequential social dilemmas; see Chen et al., 1996, and Erev & Rapoport, 1990) can also be extended to the alliance contexts accordingly.  \n\n#### Implications for Research  \n\nThese analyses have shown the power of the social dilemmα approach in solving the cooperation dilemma in multipartner alliances. Much more work, nevertheless, is warranted before we fully understand the dynamics of partner cooperation in alliances. In addition to testing the propositions made in this paper, future research is needed to understand the boundary conditions under which α particular mechanism would be effective in promoting cooperation among partners. Also needed is a better understanding of how structural solutions interact with motivational solutions (e.g., how trust can be built both through economic incentives and social and psychological interactions; see Koza & Lewin, 1998) in inducing cooperation over time in alliances (Doz, 1996; Ring, 2000). Moreover, with more and more organizations increasingly involved in intricate webs of alliances (Doz & Hamel, 1998: 221-25l; Gomes-Casseres, 1996; Powell, 1998), it is crucial to understand how cooperation evolves in networks of alliances.  \n\nFully exploring the potential of applying α social dilemmα approach to alliances requires different methodologies. One can adopt the simulation and modeling approach to test the propositions in the alliance context, as exemplified by the recent work of Khanna and his colleagues (1998). One can also adopt the in-depth case study approach to understand how the constructs identified in this paper manifest themselves and influence partner cooperation. The work of Inkpen (1995), Doz (1996), and Arino and de lα Torre (1998) has made important progress in this direction. Another approach is to develop empirical operationalizations of the key constructs identified in our propositions and test them with large sample datasets (Khanna, Gulati, & Nohria, 2000). Recent debate between Inkpen (2000) and Khanna et al. (2000) highlights the need to adopt α multidiscipline and multimethod approach to studying alliances.  \n\nThere is α growing recognition of the need for the alliance literature to move beyond treating alliances as transitory mechanisms between market and hierarchy, and beyond treating cooperation and competition as two extremes of a single continuum (e.g., Doz, 1996; Dyer & Singh, 1998; Inkpen, 2000; Koza & Lewin, 1998). Drawing from social dilemma theory, we have proposed various structural and motivational mechanisms that can be utilized to enhance cooperation among partners, in the presence of continuous threat of competition. There exists a vast number of papers in which researchers have deployed the transaction cost, organizational learning, and resource dependence theories, but the potential of using α social dilemmα approach to understand partner interactions in alliances remains unexploited. This article has, hopefully, demonstrated the power of crossfertilization between alliance research and the social dilemma literature and paved the way for future research in this direction.  \n\n### REFERENCES  \n\nAlock, J.

I propose that the manner in which firms reward individuals for their labor, match individuals to jobs, and where they place their boundaries contribute to levels of income stratification in a society. I argue the determinant of these three processes is due, in part, to systems of corporate governance affecting the power and influence of different organizational stakeholders, resulting in variance in the types of employment relationships that predominate in a society. I conclude with a discussion of the research implications of emphasizing employers and employment practices as key determinants of societal-level income inequality.  \n\nKeywords: income inequality; employment relationship; internal labor markets; wage setting; job matching; firm boundaries; corporate governance; executive compensation  \n\nDespite Plutarch's millennia-old warning that \"an imbalance between rich and poor is the most fatal ailment of all republics,\" income inequality in the United States (US), which increased 22.5 percent between 1980 and 2011, is now greater than at any point since the onset of the Great Depression (Atkinson, Piketty, & Saez, 2011). Other industrialized nations also experienced rising income inequality during this period, including Finland $(17.8\\%)$ ,Germany $(15.4\\%)$ , Japan $(20.6\\%)$ , and the United Kingdom (UK) $(32.9\\%)$ , providing evidence of a broader, global trend. The implications of understanding this phenomenon are profound as a host of issues with great relevance, such as economic mobility, educational attainment, and life expectancies are found to be related to income inequality (Stiglitz, 2012; Wilkinson & Pickett, 2009).  \n\nNot surprisingly, scholars from across the social sciences have aimed to beter understand this phenomenon, typically advancing either market (e.g., skill-biased technological change, globalization) or institutional (e.g., unionization, minimum wages, and tax policy) explanations for its rise (Morris & Western, 1999). While providing many insights on the dynamics behind rising income inequality, these accounts leave significant variance unexplained. In particular, one of the challenges of existing theories is that they are often not substantiated by cross-national analyses (see DiPrete, 2007; Gottschalk & Smeeding, 1997; Heyes, Lewis, & Clark, 2012). Income inequality is a complex phenomenon with many factors likely playing a role in its rise, and as such, opportunities exist for developing new ideas that can explain cross-national rates of income inequality, complementing and extending our current perspectives of the phenomenon.  \n\nTaking an initial step toward this end, I introduce a model that suggests a key factor determining rates of income inequality at the societal level are employers? actions regarding how they structure employment relationships. Though not often considered in existing theories of the phenomenon, employers shape inequality by deciding how much to pay different workers in different jobs (Baron, 1984). Research has indicated that across developed countries, over the past several decades, both within- (Lazear & Shaw, 2009) and between-firm (Faggio, Salvanes, & Van Reenen, 2010) income inequality has risen, and that much of that rise results from firms paying otherwise equivalent workers differently (DiNardo, Fortin, & Lemieux, 1996; Groshen, 1991). In fact, studies have suggested that nearly 40 percent of the total variation in wages across countries emerges from similarly skilled workers being employed in firms that reward them differently (see Abowd & Kramarz, 1999). Because over 90 percent of the labor force in developed countries are employees of organizations (Marsden, 1999), research on income inequality can be importantly enhanced by taking into account decisions employers make about how to pay their workers, how they match workers to positions, and where employers place their boundaries (i.e., how many workers do they employ). These considerations will help determine the extent to which wages vary across different types of workers. How executives come to make decisions about how to structure their firms? employment relationships, I argue, is a consequence of the power and interests of different organizational actors (March, 1962). I describe how corporate governance mechanisms allocate power to various organizational stakeholders and how these resulting power differentials affect the distribution of labor income in a society through the decisions executives make about how to structure their employment relationships Notwithstanding evidence suggesting employers play a significant role in determining societal rates of income inequality, contemporary organizational scholarship has been mostly silent about the phenomenon. A number of scholars have explored the consequences of wage dispersion at the intra-organizational level (for a review see Shaw, 2014) without much attention given to where inequality emerges. While organizational research has long examined employment practices - such as wage setting (Balkin & Gomez-Mejia, 1990; Larkin, Pierce, & Gino, 2012), executive compensation (Wade, O'Reilly, & Pollock, 2006), outsourcing (DavisBlake & Broschak, 2009), and layoffs (Budros, 1997) - the distributional consequences of these changing practices to society has also been largely overlooked.  \n\nEarlier conceptual work from the structuralist perspective did take seriously the role of employers in wage-setting outcomes. According to this view, organizations are a key source of income inequality because they provide unequal access to remuneration, rewards, and opportunities for advancement, independent of worker characteristics (Baron, 1984). This perspective failed to explain how firm practices aggregate to societal-level outcomes, however, as empirical research focused on explaining patterns of inequality within firms (e.g., Kalleberg & Van Buren, 1994). While an important area of inquiry, a singular focus on within-firm income inequality may mask the broader impact of these employer choices. For instance, strategies that lower within-firm income inequality, such as outsourcing and layoffs, may increase inequality within a society. As a result, explaining what gives rise to wage dispersion inside firms is not sufficient to explain income inequality within a country; rather, one must also consider how decisions made inside the firm influence the dispersion of wages throughout the labor market.  \n\nIn this paper, I introduce a model to explain how executives? decisions regarding their firms? employment practices influence societal rates of income inequality. That is, I theorize about factors that are determined by employers and associated with inequality, but are observed across countries where those factors will noticeably vary. For employers to help determine rates of income inequality necessitates that a country's labor force be employed predominately by firms versus self-employment or employment in the informal economy. Thus, my model is most relevant for the study of labor income inequality in developed countries.  \n\nI first argue that employers vary in the extent to which they hold an internal, organizational orientation or an external, market orientation (see Jacoby, 2005). This choice informs the types of employment practices employers use, and I examine the distributional impact of a set of those practices on society. Specifically, I explore how decisions made by employers about how they set wages, how they match workers (including executives) to positions, and where they place their boundaries affect income inequality at the societal level.  \n\nSecond, to explain cross-national variation in the use of these practices and to introduce a set of factors that influence how employers come to these decisions, I leverage insights from power-dependence (e.g., Emerson, 1962) and socio-political theories of corporate decision making (e.g., Cyert & March, 1963). I take the perspective that organizations are a site of conflict among different stakeholders who have vested interests in these decisions (Freeman, 1984; March, 1962). This perspective is relevant because the choices employers make about the types of practices to use help determine how resources are allocated to different stakeholders and as such, are subject to contestation (Bidwell, Briscoe, Fernandez-Mateo, & Sterling, 2013).  \n\nThe paper is organized as follows: I begin with an overview of the literature on income inequality, focusing on some of the main explanations given for its rise. I then introduce my model of how employers influence societal rates of income. I conclude with a discussion of implications for theory and empirical research of the phenomenon.  \n\n## DEFINING AND EXPLAINING INCOME INEQUALITY  \n\nIncome inequality captures the distribution of income across participants in a collective, be it an organization, a region, or a country. Income is derived from a number of sources, including earnings derived from labor, business, and investments (e.g., capital gains, dividends, and interest) (CBO, 2011). Wealth, a distinct but related construct, captures the total value of assets a family or individual owns - including homes, investments, and other savings. While any discussion of economic inequality can be informed by considering both non-labor earnings and wealth, the model presented here is about the role of firms in the wage-setting process. Therefore, I focus solely on labor income inequality.'  \n\nIncome inequality is also distinct from poverty. Whereas inequality indicates disparity in how resources are allocated, poverty captures the number of individuals living in a state of resource deprivation. Although one aspect of income inequality could be high rates of poverty, a society can have high-income inequality and no poverty, or low-income inequality and high  \n\npoverty. Although in many countries the two measures are correlated, since the late 1960s, much of the developed world has seen rates of poverty decline while income inequality has risen (World Bank, 2012), suggesting that the factors that influence income inequality do not always have similar effects on poverty. Relatedly, income inequality differs from social inequality, which characterizes the existence of unequal opportunities and rewards for different social positions in a society—such as class, race, or sex—and encompasses an array of areas, including access to education, healthcare, and voting rights (Sen, 1992). While there is often a reciprocal relationship between them, factors influencing income are distinct from those influencing social inequality, necessitating independent study of the phenomena (Kenworthy, 2007).  \n\nIncome inequality can be measured in a number of ways and each method captures somewhat different aspects of the phenomenon. For example, measures such as the Gini, Theil, and Atkinson indices consider the allocation of income throughout the income distribution. Others, such as simple ratios (e.g., top 1 percent, bottom 10 percent), and range ratios (e.g. 90/10, 50/10 percentiles), focus on a single or ratio of points to draw inferences about the income distribution. The choice of measure is important as it contains \"implicit judgments about the weight to be attached to inequality at different points on the income scale\" (Atkinson, 1975: 47). For example, the Gini index - a measure of the extent to which of income among individuals or households deviates from a perfectly equal distribution - is most sensitive to inequalities in the middle and less sensitive to inequalities at the top and bottom of the distribution. Simple and range ratios capture dynamics at a pre-defined point(s), making them less useful for understanding dynamics throughout the distribution. Examining the top 1 percent of earners, for instance, provides few insights on how income is distributed within the top 1 percent as well as on distribution throughout the lower 99 percent (Ray, 1998). Because the model I present has implications for incomes throughout the distribution, for each employment practice discussed, I identify which parts of the income distribution are likely to be most affected.  \n\n### Trends in Income Distribution  \n\nPrior analyses have revealed remarkable variety in rates and changes in income inequality across countries and over time (e.g., Alvaredo, Atkinson, Piketty, & Saez, 2013; Roser & Cuaresma, 2014). Notably, as measured by the Gini index, between 1980 and 2011 income inequality rose considerably in diverse countries such as Australia $(23.9\\%)$ , Poland $(12.7\\%)$ ， Portugal $(48.4\\%)$ , and Sweden $(29.1\\%)$ ; remained relatively unchanged in countries like Denmark $(2.6\\%)$ , France $(4.7\\%)$ , and Switzerland $(-1.5\\%)$ ; and declined in Ireland $(-8.9\\%)$ and South Korea $(-11.9\\%)$ 2 Scholars from across the social sciences have attempted to explain this variance, focusing primarily on market- or institutional-based accounts. Before introducing my model, I summarize some of the most common explanations for income inequality, discuss their limitations, and suggest that incorporating the study of employers and employment practices may complement these existing perspectives. There are a number of reviews on the topic (e.g., Katz & Autor, 1999; Levy & Murnane, 1992; McCall & Percheski, 2010; Neckerman & Torche, 2007), so I cover the literature briefly.3  \n\n### Technological Development  \n\nEfforts to explain income inequality have been developed primarily within the field of neo-classical labor economics (DiPrete, 2007). Orthodox economic theory explains wage differentials as being the product of variations in worker productivity and supply and demand. Following this tradition, skill-biased technological change (SBTC) has emerged as one of the most widely-cited drivers of income inequality. The SBTC argument states that income inequality reflects changes in the relative supply of skilled labor and exogenous technological change. Technologies enhance the marginal productivity of skilled workers while either lowering or leaving unchanged the marginal productivity of unskilled workers (Autor, Katz, & Kearney, 2008; Johnson, 1997). One of the most popular technologies examined is the microcomputer, which increases the demand for those with the requisite education and skills while making  \n\npossible the routinization of certain types of work, rendering many middle-wage jobs expendable (Acemoglu, 2002; Milgrom & Roberts, 1990; Violante, 2002).  \n\n### Globalization  \n\nA related account for rising income inequality is that it is a consequence of globalization (Bentele & Kenworthy, 2013; Dreher & Gaston, 2008). Much of the early study on globalization and income inequality focused on trade flows. Two theoretical arguments, the Hecksher-Ohlin model and the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, speculate that as less-developed countries integrate into the world economy, the demand for and returns to unskilled labor increase in those countries, reducing income disparities. Conversely, the demand for skilled labor in developed countries increases while the demand for low-skilled labor declines, exacerbating disparities (Leamer, 1995). Empirical research, however, has not supported these accounts. Studies found income inequality rose in developing countries as they integrated into the world economy (Harrison, McLaren, & McMillan, 2011). More recent research on the impact of globalization on wages and employment has examined the geographic shifts in the production of goods. For example, studies of the impact of China's manufacturing sector's ascension have found it to have a detrimental impact on manufacturing employment and wages (Autor, Dorn, & Hanson, 2013).  \n\n### Unionization and Wage Bargaining  \n\nAnother widely-cited explanation for rising income inequality is declining rates of unionization (e.g., Jacobs & Myers, 2014). Research on unions and income inequality focus primarily on two effects. First, a between-group effect whereby unions raise wages among lesseducated workers, thereby reducing inequalities between occupations. Second, a within-group effect as collective bargaining standardizes wages within firms and industries, thereby reducing differences between workers with similar characteristics (Freeman, 1980; Western & Rosenfeld, 2011). Research also suggests spillover effects in which the threat of unionization encourages non-union firms to adopt similar employment practices (Farber, 2005). Supporting these claims,  \n\nCard (2001) found that 15 to 20 percent of increases in income inequality in the US between 1970 and the early 1990s was due to declines in unionization; Fortin and collagues (2012) found similar results in Canada. Countries with greater unionization densities have, on average, lower rates of income inequality (Alderson, Beckfield, & Nielsen, 2005), as do those with more centralized wage-b argaining systems as centralization mutes the influence of different groups on the wage-setting process (Oskarsson, 2005).  \n\n### Public Policy  \n\nEconomic, political science, and sociological research also points to the direct role of public policy in impacting societal-level income inequality (e.g., Heathcote, Perri, & Violante, 2010; Kenworthy & Pontusson, 2005). This literature has focused heavily on two policy-related outcomes: minimum wage and tax rates. When a minimum wage rate is increased, the overall wage distribution is impacted by both a direct effect as workers earning less than the future minimum rate receive a wage increase, and an indirect effect wherby the wages of many workers above the minimum are increased so as to retain the relative wage ranking of occupations within firms (Morris & Western, 1999). Combined, these two effects reduce income inequality by increasing wages at the lower end of the wage distribution (see Blackburn, Bloom, & Freeman, 1990; DiNardo et al., 1996; Volscho, 2005). Others have suggested that income concentration is an artifact of tax law, as across countries and over time, higher marginal tax rates are associated with lower after-tax inequality (Alvaredo et al., 2013), as are specific tax policies aimed to redistribute earnings (Neumark & Wascher, 2001). In fact, some scholars have argued that over the long run, public policy intervention is the primary predictable mechanism through which income inequality can be reduced, emphasizing that political decisions help determine how income in a society is distributed (e.g., Bartels, 2008; Piketty, 2014).  \n\n### Limitations of Existing Research  \n\nEach of the aforementioned research streams have made important contributions to our understanding of factors affecting rates of income inequality. However, while providing many valuable insights, these accounts do leave some key questions unanswered. In particular, these accounts do not always hold up to cross-national comparison. For example, comparable levels of income inequality have not been observed in countries such as those in Continental Europe, Japan, and Scandinavia, despite these countries′ heavy adoption of computer technologies (Lin & Tomaskovic-Devey, 2013). Also, rates of income inequality in many countries began climbing before the widespread introduction of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and stabilized in the 1990s when ICTs were more widely diffused (Card & DiNardo, 2002; DiPrete, 2007; Katz & Autor, 1999). Data from countries such as Austria, Finland, Italy, and Sweden suggest that high and increasing levels of union density have not prevented increases in income inequality (Heyes et al., 2012). Many countries with low rates of income inequality have no or limited minimum wage laws (Card, Heining, & Kline, 2013), and minimum wages tell us little about changes throughout the wage distribution. Given the vast differences in tax law across developed countries, cross-national comparisons in this area have also proven challenging (Gottschalk & Smeeding, 1997).  \n\nDue to the complexity of the phenomenon, it stands to reason that a singular, universal explanation of income inequality is unlikely to emerge, and there is seemingly ample opportunity to develop new theories of how income inequality in a society is determined. Given the vital role played by firms for wage-setting outcomes, an organizational theory-based perspective on income inequality may be a particularly valuable addition. In particular, a firm-centered theory may help address some empirical puzzles plaguing existing theories of income inequality. For instance, that technology has not led to rising income inequality in many countries may be due to how those technologies are adopted by firms (Fernandez, 2001). Evidence also shows that otherwise equivalent establishments located in different countries and establishments of the same firm across countries vary in the employment practices utilized (e.g., Finegold & Mason, 1999; Siegel & Larson, 2009). As such, a firm-centered account can help link market and institutional factors to individual outcomes by highlighting how a firm's broader macro environment gets translated into firm practices that impact workers (Baron & Bielby, 1980).  \n\nIn the sections below, I introduce my model of how employers impact income inequality at the societal level (see Figure 1). I first describe how employers generate inequality through the processes of wage setting, job matching, and boundary placement. I then describe factors that may influence how executives enact these three processes.  \n\nInsert Figure 1 about here  \n\n## FIRMS AND INCOME INEQUALITY  \n\n### Human Resource Systems and Firm Strategy  \n\nA number of typologies of employment exist, including that from Boxall and Purcell (2011), Lepak and Snell (1999), and Sonnenfeld and colleagues (1988). I borrow from Jacoby's (2005) typology as it is the most parsimonious yet still captures differences in employment dynamics relevant to the study of income inequality. According to Jacoby (2005), systems of corporate employment can be categorized broadly into two ideal types: organizational or market oriented. Table 1 outlines some basic features of each type of system. The main distinction between the two systems is the extent to which they rely on internal (i.e., organizational) versus external (i.e., market) criteria in the structuring of employment relationships. An organizational focus is associated with stable employment with low turnover, extensive use of training, and the dominance of internal considerations - such as a desire for equity - on executive decision making. In such a system, employers protect workers from many of the vagaries of market forces; they take a longer-term perspective on performance and favor corporate strategies that necessitate a stable, well-trained, and loyal workforce. A market focus, on the other hand, is characterized by flexible employment relationships with higher turnover, fewer opportunities for training, and pay and allocation decisions based on external criteria. The shorter-term orientation discourages employers from bearing market risks on behalf of their workers and encourages them to utilize employment practices that lower costs and increase flexibility (Kalleberg, 2011).  \n\nInsert Table 1 about here  \n\nWhether a firm adopts an organizational or market orientation is related to the firm’s choice of employment practices (Jacoby, 2005; Kalleberg, 2011). I focus here on a set of practices likely to impact the distribution of income in a society, arguing that firms generate income inequality through how they reward workers (including executives) for their labor, how they match them to jobs, and where firms place their boundaries (i.e., how many workers the firm employs). In countries where a higher proportion of employment is in firms using an organizational (market) orientation, I argue income inequality will be lower (higher) Importantly, employers fall along a continuum between having an organizational versus market orientation, and firms do not necessarily utilize one strategy but often use combinations of both (Siegel & Larson, 2009). That is, within a given firm, some workers can be governed by employment relationships based on external market considerations while other workers are governed by organizational considerations (Lepak & Snell, 1999). Nonetheless, the emphasis here is on the consequences to society of the relative propensity of firms to pursue a market versus an organizational orientation and the types of practices they are likely to utilize as a result  \n\n### Wage Setting and Job Matching  \n\nNeo-classical economics emphasizes that income differentials are the result of unequal endowments in productive capacities among individuals; therefore, individuals with identical skills should obtain relatively equivalent earnings regardless of the job they are in (e.g., Becker, 1964). Wages, however, are typically tied to jobs rather than individuals (Granovetter, 1981; Thurow, 1975), and once we allow features of a job to influence wage outcomes, how firms match workers to positions and how they reward workers for their labor become important determinants of how labor income is distributed in a society (Sorensen & Sorenson, 2007).  \n\nAn internal, organizational orientation toward wage setting is consistent with the use of internal labor markets (ILMs), whereby \"pricing, allocation, and training decisions are governed by a set of administrative rules and procedures\" rather than by external market forces (Doeringer & Piore, 1971: 1-2), and workers' jobs and wages are insulated from external market forces (Cappelli, 2001). One of the more evident manifestations of this approach is in the wage-setting process. Historically, the most common method used by larger firms to set compensation was through job evaluation - a formalized system for ascertaining the relative value of different jobs in a firm (Gomez-Mejia, Berrone, & Franco-Santos, 2010) - which was utilized, in large part, to reduce wage inequality inside of firms (Sanchez & Levine, 2012). For example, in a prototypical point-based job evaluation system, such as the Hay System that emerged in the 1940s and gained worldwide popularity over the ensuing decades, each job is evaluated along dimensions such as required skill, effort, scope of responsibility, and working conditions (Boxall & Purcell, 2011). Jobs are then assigned wages based on their value to the firm and in relation to other jobs within the organization. Though jobs that require greater levels of competencies and are more highly valued by the firm receive greater pay, historically these systems were developed to create a sense of internal pay equity (Dulebohn & Werling, 2007). By assigning wages to the job and establishing criteria by which jobs are compared, employers hope to mitigate perceptions of inequity in how wages throughout the hierarchy are set (Pfeffer & Davis-Blake, 1992).  \n\nThere are at least two factors, then, that suggest the presence of ILMs across a population of firms will reduce income inequality in a society (see Figure 2). First, to ensure internal equity across jobs, firms utilize administrative procedures - guided by concerns for internal equity -- that set appropriate pay differentials across jobs, implying greater equality of compensation than would otherwise exist, and that lower within- and between-group income differentials. Second and relatedly, ILMs are typically associated with a wage premium that is greater for lower- than higher-skilled workers (Groshen & Levine, 1998), suggesting a between-group effect whereby wages are more compressed between lower- and higher-skilled workers than would be otherwise. In fact, in countries like Japan, the UK, and the US, income inequality was at its lowest levels when ILMs predominated, and the breakdown of ILMs coincided with rising income inequality in a number of countries (Cappelli, 2001; Davis & Cobb, 2010).  \n\nInsert Figure 2 about here  \n\nUnlike in ILMs, the use of market-based employment practices reduces the influence of bureaucratic processes that determine hiring, promotion, and remuneration. Opening them to competition affords firms greater flexibility in how they manage their employment relationships; this competition appeals to firms who favor a market orientation (Jacoby, 2005). The consequences of a market-based employment relationship on income inequality are also significant. Rather than wages being set through evaluation systems that promote internal equity, in external labor markets, wages are more likely to be based on the relative quality of workers, evidenced by performance, skills, and credentials, as well as on the broader market forces of supply and demand. Individual variations in performance can be significant (Schmidt & Hunter, 1981), and market-oriented wage setting reveals and reflects these variations through pay differences. As such, wage-setting systems that reward workers based on their productivity, such as is the case in pay-for-performance schemes, can lead to higher levels of income inequality since they increase the wage gap between more and less productive workers (Bandiera,  \n\nBarankay, & Rasul, 2007; Lemieux, 2011). In the US, the use of these schemes, which are more common among higher-income workers, is responsible for over 20 percent of the rise in income inequality between the late 1970s and the early 1990s (Lemieux, MacLeod, & Parent, 2009). A number of studies have also substantiated that worker wages are positively correlated with firm profitability (e.g., Blanchflower, Oswald, & Sanfey, 1996; Gurtzgen, 2010) and found an increased use of firm-based compensation practices such as bonuses and stock options (e.g. Kruse, Freeman, & Blasi, 2010). Wages, then, for workers with similar skills but in different firms will vary based on disparities in firm performance.  \n\nSimilarly, when hiring occurs largely from outside of the firm, information asymmetries between workers and employers are likely to impact wages. Bidwell (2011) argued that differences in pay between external and internal hires should reflect differences in the observable characteristics between the two types of candidates. Firms have less knowledge of external candidates unobservable skills and talents. To compensate for this, these candidates typically have greater levels of observable traits, such as education and credentials. Because those observable traits are easily transferrable across firms, whereas unobservable characteristics - such as tacit knowledge (Althauser & Kalleberg, 1981) or culture fit (Chatman, 1991) - are not, observable characteristics are more highly rewarded in the labor market. Moreover, because external hires lack information about their fit for the job and within the firm, they must be compensated for the increased risk they bear by switching employers. External hiring, then, can lead to higher income inequality at the societal level because in comparison to individuals lacking them, employees with greater levels of visible credentials and stronger social networks receive greater rewards (Bidwell, 2011; Bridges & Villemez, 1986). Likewise, when hiring occurs predominately from outside the firm, younger and lower-skilled workers are often sorted into and remain in lower-paying jobs (Autor & Houseman, 2010), as are women and minorities (Prokos, Padavic, & Schmidt, 2009). Rather than individual attainment being a function of  \n\nbureaucratic procedures, careers span across firms with little predictability (Bidwell & Briscoe, 2010), implying greater variance in wage outcomes for similarly skilled individuals. In short, where firms rely more heavily on market-oriented wage setting and external hiring, we should see movement away from the middle of the income distribution towards the tails, leading to greater wage dispersion at the societal level.  \n\nProposition 1: In countries where workers are employed by firms favoring the use of external labor market rather than internal labor market mechanisms to set wages and match workers to jobs, income inequality at the societal level will be higher.  \n\n### Executive Compensation  \n\nOne factor regularly cited for why income inequality has risen over the past 35 years is the gap in wages between the highest earners - those in the upper 1 or .01 percent - and all other earners (e.g., Atkinson et al., 2011). The average annual earnings of the top 1 percent of wage earners in the US grew 275 percent from 1979 to 2007 (CBO, 2011). Those in the remaining top 20 percent, the middle 60 percent, and bottom 20 percent grew by 65, 40, and 18 percent, respectively (Kim, Kogut, & Yang, 2013). Understanding overall changes in income inequality, therefore, can be markedly enhanced by considering the influence of top incomes.  \n\nThough salaries in many professions, such as those for professional athletes, celebrities, and finance professionals increased dramatically during this period (Kaplan & Rauh, 2009), data show that in countries such as Germany (Bach, Corneo, & Steiner, 2009), the US (Bakija, Cole, & Heim, 2012), Australia and the UK (see OECD, 2011: 351), non-financial executives, managers, and supervisors constitute the largest occupational category of the highest earners. Across countries, there is considerable variance in the relative pay of executives to the median worker. For example, in 2012, the ratio of CEO pay to the median worker was 58 to 1 in Norway, 67 to 1 in Japan, 104 to 1 in France, 147 to 1 in Germany, and 354 to 1 in the US (The Globalist, 2013). Given the representation of executives among top earners and the stark crossnational differences in how well compensated they are relative to the average worker, how firms set compensation for executives plays a key role in determining a society's level of income inequality. I examine three ways in which firms set the compensation of their executives that may influence societal levels of income inequality: performance-based pay, external benchmarking, and external hiring.  \n\nPerformance-based pay and external benchmarking. Over the past several decades in many developed countries, there has been an effort to tie executive compensation more closely to metrics of firm performance. In particular, across many countries, executive compensation schemes increasingly include equity compensation, whereby options to purchase shares of stock at a set price are granted to management on the basis of firm performance (Murphy, 2013). Where firm performance outpaces wage growth - such as in the US where between 1990 and 2005 when average worker wages increased 4 percent while corporate profits increased 107 percent - inequalities in income will increase. Specifically, the upper tail of the income distribution will shift outward.  \n\nInterestingly, however, a tighter coupling of executive compensation and firm performance does not seem sufficient for explaining the growth in CEO wages. Notably, evidence confirms that in many places, CEO pay has outpaced firm performance, growing 298 percent in the US during this same period (Anderson, Cavanagh, Collins, & Benjamin, 2006). One reason for the outpaced growth of executive wages results from how executive compensation gets set. Notably, a number of studies have examined the practice whereby corporate boards, often aided by compensation consultants, benchmark the pay of their executives to those of other firms (see Kim et al., 2013). When benchmarking, executive compensation is targeted at a specific range (e.g., $50^{\\mathrm{th}},75^{\\mathrm{th}},90^{\\mathrm{th}})$ of the benchmarked firms; rarely ever is it below the median (Bizjak, Lemmon, & Naveen, 2008). If most firms use external benchmarking and aim to pay at or above the median, pay will increase due to the upward bias in target and the repeated \"leapfrogging\" of firms (Elson & Ferrere, 2013). Moreover, this benchmarking system creates feedback loops such that the decision by a small number of corporate boards to dramatically increase executive pay has a sizeable influence on executive pay at other firms (DiPrete, Eirich, & Pittinsky, 2010). When creating the benchmark, boards often include a set of aspirational firms that are larger and employ considerably higher paid executives. For example, in 2012, the median firm on Viacom's benchmark list was 56 percent larger by market capitalization and had double its revenues (Mider & Green, 2012). Thus, even where a firm sets its benchmark at the median of its benchmark group, that group is often upwardly biased, making an executive's pay much greater than the median of a comparable set of firms. As a result, the use of external benchmarking to set pay has the potential to drive executive income higher than would be expected by rising corporate profits alone.  \n\nPotentially, a firm could set wages for all its workers via external benchmarking; however, for a number of reasons, it is unlikely this would curb rising income inequality. First, in many settings, because executive compensation is tied more closely to firm performance than it is for most workers, to the extent that corporate profits exceed workers? returns to their marginal product, income inequality will increase. Second, because executive wages are considerably higher than those of the average worker, worker wages would have to increase at a higher rate than that of executives to prevent inequality from growing. Third, the incentive for firms to set worker wages above the median and to use a biased benchmark group is likely to be lower than when benchmarking for executives. Therefore, to the extent that firms use external benchmarking to set pay, we should see higher rates of income inequality at the societal level as the right tail of the income distribution will grow and shift outward.  \n\nIn contrast, employers can rely on internal benchmarking of CEO pay, whereby the CEO wage is set in comparison to the salaries of those employed in the company. In some of the earliest analyses of executive compensation, researchers considered the possibility that  \n\nexecutives were paid on the basis of comparison to other employees of the firm (e.g., Simon, 1957) or a combination of comparing executive pay to that of similar firms and utilizing internal comparison (Patton, 1951). Firms such as Whole Foods cap CEO pay at its average annual wage, while others such as Northwestern Corporation ensure that executive compensation is \"internally equitable and consistent\" (Brancaccio, 2012). Where executive compensation is determined in larger part by internal benchmarking, the ratio of executive pay to that of the average workers is likely to be somewhat constrained. To the extent that this practice is common in a society, top incomes are likely to be reduced, thereby lowering aggregate income inequality.  \n\nProposition 2a: In countries where firms favor the use of performance-based pay systems to remunerate executives, income inequality at the societal level will be higher.  \n\nProposition 2b: In countries where firms favor the use of external rather than internal benchmarking to set executive pay, income inequality at the societal level will be higher.  \n\nExternal hiring. Another factor linked to rising executive compensation is the increased incidence of firms recruiting CEOs from outside of the organization. During the 1970s in the US, fewer than 15 percent of newly appointed CEOs were hired externally. By the late 1990s, nearly a third of all CEO appointments came from outside of firms (Murphy & Zabojnik, 2008). Much in the same way that external hiring of workers alters the demand for observable skills, the utilization of external hiring represents a shift in the reliance on general managerial versus firmspecific skills. Such a shift increases competition for skilled labor in the executive labor market, driving up wages (Murphy & Zabojnik, 2008). To compensate executives for the loss in future value of their firm-specific investments, the hiring organization may also need to pay a premium to entice an executive to switch firms (Harris & Helfat, 1997). In fact, many of the more generous executive compensation packages have been the result of contracts negotiated with external candidates at the time of hire, not deals reached with incumbents (Murphy, 2013). Combined, these factors suggest that the reliance on external hiring of executives is likely to be associated with higher levels of compensation, thereby exacerbating income inequality by increasing the size of the right tail of the country's income distribution and shifting it outward. Proposition 2c: In countries where firms favor the use of external rather than internal hiring to match executives to their positions, income inequality at the societal level will be higher.  \n\n### Firm Boundaries: Who and How Many to Employ  \n\nNon-standard work arrangements. The prototypical standard employment relationship consists of stable, full-time employment in which the worker is employed directly by the firm. Executives can, however, organize work utilizing a number of arrangements that fall under the umbrella term non-standard work, which includes contracting, outsourcing, temporary work, and part-time employment (Cappelli & Keller, 2013a). Non-standard work arrangements differ from standard ones in a number of ways, including administrative control often being handled by a third-party organization (such as in the case of temporary and contract labor), and no expectation of continued employment (Kalleberg, 2011). When making the decision to use non-standard work arrangements, executives may be motivated by a variety of factors, such as increasing the firm's flexibility or lowering economic and social comparison costs (Autor, 2003; Nickerson & Zenger, 2008). In general, employers favoring a market orientation are more likely to utilize these non-standard work arrangements (Kalleberg, 2011). Not surprisingly, researchers have begun to explore the causes and consequences of these work arrangements for employers and workers (Cappelli & Keller, 2013b; Dube & Kaplan, 2010; Peck & Theodore, 2007). Few efforts, however, have been made to connect their spread to rising levels of income inequality.  \n\nIn part-time and temporary arrangements, workers are employed directly by the focal firm but at rates typically below what is earned by full-time employees. Because many workers are employed in these positions involuntarily and often face constraints in the number of hours they can work, total labor income inequality is likely to increase as a result of these  \n\narrangements. As part-time and temporary workers are utilized in place of full-time workers, we should expect societal rates of income inequality to rise.  \n\nWhen employers externalize employment through use of outsourcing or offshoring, the distribution of jobs within the organization changes. Entire functions and departments are routinely extricated from the firms' boundaries and handled by outside vendors. For example, Cappelli (1999: 74) recounts how IBM outsourced all clerical jobs below the rank of executive secretary to employment agencies like Manpower Inc. Research has shown that outsourced employees have fewer opportunities for promotion and training than those retained in-house (Walsh & Deery, 2006). Moreover, in a study of outsourcing of janitors and security guards, Dube and Kaplan (2010) found that outsourced workers earn routinely less than in-house employees, and that this is in large part due to mid- to high-paying jobs turning into lowerpaying jobs or being removed altogether (see also van Jaarsveld & Yanadori, 2011).  \n\nBy outsourcing, firms can keep the wages and conditions of employment closer to market rates without disrupting norms of equity (Cappelli, 1999; Nickerson & Zenger, 2008). In so doing, these jobs become separated from ILMs that reduced the wage disjuncture across hierarchical levels and between occupations. While some high-skilled contract workers benefit from such arrangements (Kunda, Barley, & Evans, 2002), the vast majority of contract workers are employed in low- or middle-wage jobs. In the case of firms moving or outsourcing jobs to vendors in a foreign country, domestic income inequality is likely to rise due to higher unemployment. Outsourcing and offshoring, therefore, should be associated with greater levels of income inequality at the societal level. In particular, we should see a hollowing of the middle, growth in the left tail, and potentially modest growth in the right tail of the income distribution. Proposition 3: In countries where workers are employed by firms favoring the use of nonstandard work arrangements, income inequality at the societal level will be higher.  \n\nLayoffs. Another market-oriented practice firms use to alter their boundaries is performing layoffs - a termination of employment for reasons generally out of an employee's control. Typically, employers utilize layoffs in an effort to improve the firm’'s efficiency (Hallock, 2009). While layoffs can be temporary, here I focus on permanent terminations. In the short-run, displacement increases unemployment, exacerbating societal income differentials. Widespread layoffs affect market dynamics, increasing the supply of workers and lowering their bargaining power, thus driving down wages. In the medium- to long-term, evidence from across a number of developed countries shows that having been laid-off contributes to a long-lasting, negative impact on workers? wages once they reenter the workforce (e.g., Hijzen, Upward, & Wright, 2010; Schmieder, von Wachter, & Bender, 2010). Job displacement in the US has disproportionately affected those in lower- to middle-income occupations, such as craftsmen, operatives, laborers, and supervisors, as well as those working in manufacturing industries that traditionally paid good wages (Conyon, Girma, Thompson, & Wright, 2001; Kletzer, 1998). To the extent that laid-off workers are predominately employed in low- and mid-wage jobs, downsizing will increase income differentials at the societal level as the middle of the income distribution shrinks and the left tail grows and shifts outward.  \n\nProposition 4: In countries where layoffs affect a larger proportion of workers, income inequality at the societal level will be higher.  \n\n### FIRM COALITIONS, CORPORATE GOVERNANCE,  \n\n# AND EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES  \n\nIn the section above, I argued that societal levels of income inequality are determined, in part, by decisions made by firms. Specifically, I contended that rates of inequality are affected by the extent of employment in firms that predominately utilize practices reflecting a market versus an organizational orientation. To what extent, however, do individual employers and their executives differ in their preferences for a market or organizational focus? Viewing firms as a set of political coalitions (Cyert & March, 1963; March, 1962), I argue the answer is that because these two orientations have distinct implications for how firm resources are divided among various stakeholder groups, the power and interests of different organizational actors help determine which strategy an employer will pursue. Coalitions consist of groups of individuals with similar interests seeking to have their preferences met by the organization. Coalitions themselves often have divergent interests, and in most cases, no single group is able to determine the goals they want the organization to pursue. In Emerson's (1962) account of powerdependence relations, he argues that outcomes from an exchange relationship derive from the dependence one party has upon another in obtaining a needed resource (see also Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978). What determines the outcomes of negotiations between coalitions is determined, in part, by the relative power of each. Coalitional power and changes therein should be reflected in the goals, strategies, and practices used by the organization (Wry, Cobb, & Aldrich, 2013).  \n\nI focus here on two key stakeholder groups that make firm-specific investments (Aguilera & Jackson, 2003): shareholders and executives. I argue that their interests and influence play an important role in whether a firm utilizes an organization or market orientation when structuring their employment practices. A third stakeholder group, labor (i.e., non-management workers), also has a vested interest in the outcome of firm decisions. While I do discuss labor's influence on employment practices in the discussion section, because labor power is typically codified into laws that determine the scope and strength of labor protection - including collective bargaining rights, which have been studied extensively by scholars of the phenomenon - I offer no formal proposition for the influence of labor on income inequality.  \n\n### Shareholder Influence: Monitoring and Incentives  \n\nShare ownership structure. Since the writings of Berle and Means (1932), social scientists have been interested in understanding how stock ownership structure influences organizational action since a firm's controlling interest directly affects its goals and structure (Chaganti & Damanpour, 1991; Fiss & Zajac, 2004). This influence, however, is moderated by the extent to which equity ownership is concentrated. When share ownership is dispersed among a large number of shareholders, executives have greater discretion to pursue strategies that enhance their own personal interests (Demsetz & Lehn, 1985). For example, dispersed ownership is associated with a greater proclivity of management to pursue firm growth strategies through diversified acquisitions (Amihud & Lev, 1981), to utilize compensation schemes rewarding growth rather than performance (Wright, Kroll, & Elenkov, 2002), and to provide workers with better paying jobs (Liu, van Jaarsveld, Batt, & Frost, 2014). Concentrated ownership, on the other hand, encourages corporate boards to weigh shareholders' interests more heavily when evaluating firm strategy (Desender, Aguilera, Crespi, & Garcia-Cestona, 2013).  \n\nThere are, however, many different types of shareholders, such as families, mutual funds, and private equity firms, which have different interests, investment strategies, and time horizons. Shareholders fall largely into two types: those taking a longer-term, strategic view and those taking a shorter-term, financial view of their investments (Aguilera & Jackson, 2003). For example, throughout much of Continental Europe, Japan, and Latin America, large shareholders tend to be banks and corporations (e.g., customers or suppliers) who use equity stakes as a means to pursue strategic interests. The potential loss of commercial business outstrips dividend income, motivating these shareholders to prefer strategies that enhance the long-term survival prospects of their investments (Schneper & Guillen, 2004). A longer-term perspective translates into a preference for firm strategies based on long-term growth and product market domination, reinforcing forms of corporate organization that allow firms to benefit from workers' accumulation of firm-specific and other human capital investments (Amable, 2003).  \n\nIn contrast, shareholders with a shorter-term, financial view, such as private equity firms and many types of institutional investors, are more likely to encourage firms to engage in actions that maximize profitability (Cobb, 2015; Useem, 1996), thus performance in equity markets  \n\nplays a more significant role in corporate strategy (Jensen & Murphy, 2009). One consequence of this system is that the market plays a central role in determining firm structure. As John Brian, CEO of Sara Lee, stated, “\"Wall Street can wipe you out. They are the rule-setters. They do have their fads, but to a large extent there is an evolution in how they judge companies, and they have decided to give premiums to companies that harbor the most profits for the least assets\" (Lowenstein, 1997). Evidence shows that investors pursuing financial interests motivate firms to engage in tactics that increase shareholder value in the short-term and to engage less in long-term strategic decision making (Bushee, 1998; Connelly, Tihanyi, Certo, & Hitt, 2010). The prevalence and influence of shareholders with short-term interests, therefore, is likely to be associated with firms minimizing their investment in fixed assets and making their boundaries more permeable. The benefits accrued to employers from utilizing ILMs are gained over the long run (Cappelli, 2001), so a short-term focus reduces their value to the firm and its investors. Additionally, several scholars have suggested that the growth of private equity and institutional investors pursuing market interests has led to wage cuts and corporate reorganization via layoffs (Batt & Appelbaum, 2013; Fligstein & Shin, 2007; Shleifer & Summers, 1988). Shareholders concerned with maximizing market returns are also likely to prefer more open, flexible employment relationships as it provides for a tighter coupling between wages and productivity (Sorensen & Kalleberg, 1981).  \n\nProposition 5a: In countries where equity is owned predominately by investors pursuing shortterm financial interests, employers will be more likely to take a market orientation when structuring their employment relationships.  \n\nThe structure of equity ownership can also influence executive compensation. Throughout many developed countries, the increase in executive pay has been largely due the growth of equity-based compensation (Murphy, 2013) achieved, in part, by investors who advocated its use (Jung & Dobbin, 2014; Westphal & Zajac, 1998). In recent years, foreign investors - particularly UK- and US-based institutional investors - have increased their shareholdings in foreign firms, placing pressure on them to adopt and abide by US corporate governance (and employment) practices (Ahmadjian & Robinson, 2001; Fiss & Zajac, 2004; Jacoby, 2005). This leads to higher executive pay and the increased use of equity-based pay in firms in which they invest (Murphy, 2013). However, not all shareholders are as willing to endorse expansions in executive compensation. Many pension funds, for example, have attempted to curb executive pay through proxy contests, and the AFL-CIO tracks the vigilance of institutional investors on executive pay issues, showing considerable variance in these investors? willingness to support management over pay issues.  \n\nTaken together, this suggests that firms will be more apt to use performance-based pay, external hiring, outsourcing, part-time labor, layoffs, as well as have higher levels of executive compensation when a firm’s equity is predominately owned by shareholders pursuing shorterterm interests and favoring the use of equity-based executive compensation.  \n\nProposition 5b: In countries where equity is owned predominately by investors favoring high levels of equity-based compensation, employers will be more likely to take a market orientation when structuring their employment relationships.  \n\nTakeovers and corporate control. A second external monitoring mechanism that influences executive decision making is the threat of takeover (Walsh & Seward, 1990). Takeovers are coupled frequently with a change in management, thus the market for corporate control raises the cost of self-dealing for executives (Manne, 1965) and ensures executives attend to the interests of shareholders (Fama, 1980). While countries vary considerably in the extent to which hostile takeovers are used to discipline managers (Schneper & Guillen, 2004), studies have revealed that when freed from takeover pressures, executives extract higher pay for their workers (Bertrand & Mullainathan, 1999, 2003) and pursue stakeholder-friendly practices such as community development (Kacperczyk, 2009). Non-shareholding stakeholder welfare is thus thought to be enhanced when management has more autonomy.  \n\nOne direct consequence of takeovers is that they often lead to employee layoffs (Conyon et al., 2001), which, as discussed above, can exacerbate inequalities in income. Moreover, an active market for corporate control discourages management from taking actions that lower firm market value, thus making the firm an attractive takeover target. Taking on debt, stock repurchases, increasing dividend payments, spinning off under-performing business units, and reducing labor costs through various forms of restructuring are all strategies management has employed in response to takeover threats (Davis, 2009). While beneficial to shareholders, each of these actions undermines firm stability by reallocating resources in order to enhance short-term performance. Because the benefits of ILMs are long-term in nature, the risk of takeover makes ILMs a less appealing option for employers and workers. For example, changes in share ownership are thought to weaken firms' reputations for long-term relationships (Shleifer & Summers, 1988), thus threats of and successful hostile takeovers are likely to discourage workers from making firm-specific investments. Without such investments, ILMs become less necessary and external labor market mechanisms are utilized more frequently.  \n\nProposition 6: In countries with a more active takeover market, employers will be more likely to take a market orientation when structuring their employment relationships.  \n\nAligning interests through incentives. While the direct impact of executive pay levels on income inequality was discussed above, here I suggest that an indirect effect, whereby monetary incentives influence executive decision making about what types of employment practices to use. Financial theorists have proposed that equity compensation is used to align executives? goals with those of the firm (e.g., Jensen & Meckling, 1976), and managers with equity in the firm are more likely to embrace shareholder concerns and direct the firm in their joint interests, thereby reducing the gap between ownership and control (Dalton, Hitt, Certo, &  \n\nDalton, 2007). Specifically, stock options provide an incentive for managers to make decisions that boost equity values, often with the consequence of lower worker wages and increased employment insecurity (Minsky, 1996). Furthermore, such schemes typically have short vesting periods that allow executives to reap the rewards of their actions before their full effect may be realized, disincentivizing the use of firm strategies based on firm stability and long-term growth (Murphy, 1999). Taken together, where monetary incentives are tied more closely to market investor interests, executives are likely to utilize firm strategies that favor flexible employment relationships and short-term performance. Such a short-term focus discourages the use of ILMs and encourages altering firm boundaries through non-standard work arrangements and layoffs. Proposition 7: In countries where executive compensation is based primarily on firm financial performance, employers will be more likely to take a market orientation when structuring their employment relationships.  \n\n### Executive Power and Decision Making  \n\nWhile there exist constraints on their discretion, by the nature of their position, top executives have considerable power and authority to set firms goals and strategies (Fligstein, 1991). Whether they choose a market or organizational orientation is determined, in part, by their own beliefs about the most effective way to structure their employment relationships. These schemas, which emerge from prior experience (Skinner, 1953), help determine the goals of and guide decisions in the firm (Finkelstein, Hambrick, & Cannella, 2009; Prahalad & Bettis, 1986). The functional and educational background of an employer's top executive(s), therefore, are likely to play a role in determining the purpose of the corporation as well as its objectives and strategies (Fligstein, 1990; Ocasio & Kim, 1999).  \n\nThe fields of finance and economics have a strong commitment to the primacy of markets. This suggests that executives with a background in these fields will hold more positive views toward using market mechanisms to structure employment relationships. CEOs with a  \n\nbackground in finance or economics are also thought to consider shareholder interests over those of other stakeholders when making strategic decisions (Fiss & Zajac, 2004) as these disciplines strongly support the shareholder value orientation. The prevalence of CEOs with a strong financial background suggests these firms prefer CEOs \"who understand the financial ramifications of business decisions\" (Sanders, 2011). Evidence shows that CEOs of German firms with a law or economics background are more likely to espouse a shareholder value orientation (Fiss & Zajac, 2004). CEOs with a background in finance have also been found to be more likely to engage in downsizing (Budros, 2000).  \n\nIn contrast, executives with backgrounds in other disciplines may be less inclined to implement market-oriented practices if they conflict with other objectives. For example, executives in Germany tend to have PhDs in engineering or science (Aguilera & Jackson, 2003) and are guided by a desire to achieve technical excellence, rather than pursuing narrow financial interests (Lawrence, 1980). Evidence also suggests that firms develop more novel strategies and are more likely to alter them over time when its executives have a more diverse background (i.e., one spanning a number of functional areas) (Crossland, Zyung, Hiller, & Hambrick, 2014). Given a predisposition toward a market orientation and attention to financial measures of performance, I expect that in comparison to firms with CEOs with other backgrounds, CEOs with a functional or educational background primarily in finance or economics are more likely to structure their employment relationships utilizing a market orientation.  \n\nProposition 8: In countries where executives have a background predominately in finance or economics, employers will be more likely to take a market orientation when structuring their employment relationships.  \n\n## DISCUSSION  \n\nIncome inequality is one of the defining social problems of contemporary times (World Economic Forum, 2014), and scholars from across the social sciences have sought to better  \n\nexplain where it arises from and to what effect. With but a few exceptions, however, explanations ignore the role played by firms. Employers are of great importance to the study of the phenomenon because they make decisions about who to hire, how much to pay, and how many to employ (Baron, 1984), and, as such, influence rates of income inequality at the societal level. Furthermore, how executives are impacted by monitoring structures, incentives, and the schemas used when making these choices is squarely in the purview of organizational scholarship, making our field uniquely suited to study income inequality. That few have done so while having the capacity to add much to the scholarly debate provides an interesting opportunity. By introducing a model of how employers influence income inequality at the societal level, I hope to provide future researchers a platform for the study of this phenomenon.  \n\nThe model I present articulates the distributional consequences of different employment practices and how firms come to make them. Specifically, I discuss how three key elements of firms' strategy and structure - how employees (including executives) are rewarded for their labor, are matched to jobs, and where a firm places its boundaries - affect societal rates of income inequality. I theorize that when wage setting and job matching are based primarily on internal (external) considerations, income inequality in a society will be lower (higher). In ILMs, the wage premium for lower-skilled workers is typically higher than for higher-skilled ones (Groshen & Levine, 1998), providing lower levels of between-group income inequality than would be experienced outside a firm's boundaries. The desire to maintain norms of fairness also implies a smaller disjuncture in wages between workers throughout the hierarchy (Doeringer & Piore, 1971). Wages tied to worker productivity and firm performance as well as a reliance on external hiring, lead to greater returns to workers? observable characteristics, such as education, credentials, and productivity, creating greater variance in returns to labor. These same considerations also influence rates of executive pay such that when firms utilize performancebased pay, external benchmarking, and external hiring, executive pay will be greater. Moreover, efforts to externalize employment through non-standard work arrangements and layoffs also put downward pressure on wages of low- to mid-income workers, further exacerbating wage differentials at the societal level. Taken together, whether employers take an organizational versus a market focus when structuring their employment relationships has important distributional consequences for society.  \n\nI also discuss a number of firm-level factors that help determine whether a firm takes a market or organizational orientation. Leveraging insights from power-dependence and sociopolitical theories of executive decision making, I argue that firms are composed of a set of coalitions with different interests and sources of influence. Because a market versus an organizational orientation has implications for how firm resources are allocated between stakeholders, the power and interests of different organizational actors helps determine which strategy an employer will pursue. Specifically, I contend that the structure of equity ownership, the prevalence of a corporate takeover market, the structure of executive compensation, and decision making schemas of top executives encourage the adoption of practices associated with a market versus an organizational orientation.  \n\n### Implications for Organizational Theory  \n\nEarlier contributions to organizational theory, such as the behavioral theory of the firm (e.g., Cyert & March, 1963), paid considerable attention to the role coalitional conflict played in affecting firm outcomes. The model presented here suggests these same mechanisms may be relevant to our understanding of societal-level outcomes. Furthermore, while organizational scholars have made many important advances in our understanding of changing employment practices and the forces motivating them, scant attention has been paid to the distributional consequences of these decisions on society. This omission has had the consequence of leaving the study of income inequality to fields of study less likely to consider the role of employers and firm-level decision making. The lack of attention to social outcomes is part of a broader trend whereby organizational theory has largely bypassed the study of societal issues and instead focused on firm outcomes and inter-organizational dynamics (Perrow, 1986). When social issues are considered, such as in the study of corporate social responsibility, researchers too often examine firm outcomes to the neglect of studying firms′ impact upon society (see Banerjee, 2008; Walsh, Weber, & Margolis, 2003). There is a precedent, however, for the study of social issues by organizational scholars, as the impact of hierarchies on individuals and society was a central concern of earlier scholarship (e.g., Boulding, 1953). Notably, a number of early accounts speculated that the processes and modalities prevalent in organizations directly impacted the well-being of their employees (Katz & Kahn, 1966; Whyte, 1956), and more contemporary research has found that the type of job one holds (e.g., its position in the organizational hierarchy) plays a vital role in outcomes related to individual health and well-being (e.g. Marmot et al., 1991). By viewing firm strategy and structure as an important driver of societallevel income inequality, this model points to employers as key drivers of social welfare and suggests that within the purview of organizational theory, researchers should once again explore firms as promulgators of societal change (Hinings & Greenwood, 2002; Stern & Barley, 1996).  \n\nConceptual work from the structuralist perspective of stratification was acutely interested in the impact firms had on their environment, and argued that employers, through their decisions about processes of job allocation and wage setting, help determine levels of income stratification (Baron & Bielby, 1980). Empirical studies in this milieu, however, documented features of organizations giving rise to intra-firm income inequality, without attention given to how firms impact inequality in a society (Sorensen, 2007). As a starting point, I take insights from the structuralist perspective and combine them with economic and sociological literature on labor markets as well as organizational scholarship on employment practices. From this, I develop a model that articulates a set of mechanisms through which firm strategy and structure leads to  \n\nsocietal-level income inequality. In so doing, I answer recent calls to integrate income inequality research and organizational theory (Sorensen & Sorenson, 2007).  \n\nLastly, while organizational scholars have been largely silent about the factors that lead to societal levels of income inequality, the impact of income dispersion on individual outcomes, such as motivation and turnover (Shaw, Gupta, & Delery, 2002; Trevor, Reilly, & Gerhart, 2012; Wade et al., 2006), as well as firm-level outcomes like performance (Bloom, 1999; Fredrickson, Davis-Blake, & Sanders, 2010), have been important areas of inquiry. Generating a more complete understanding of how firms create income inequality, therefore, may inform interest in the impact of income inequality on individual, group, firm, and societal dynamics.  \n\n### Implications for the Study of Income Inequality  \n\nExisting perspectives on the rise of income inequality focus primarily on market-based explanations (e.g., SBTC, globalization), unions, minimum wages, and tax policy (Morris & Western, 1999: 642). While each of these streams have provided valuable insights into the drivers of income inequality, the explanations are often not supported by cross-national analyses (DiPrete, 2007), suggesting other factors may be important. By failing to consider the role of firms in processes of wage setting, job matching, and boundary placement, existing research overlooks potentially important firm-level factors driving differences in income inequality over time. Employers help determine labor market outcomes (Baron & Bielby, 1980), and research indicates that much of the increase in income inequality is due to employers paying similar workers differently (Groshen, 1991).\"The market is always embodied in specific institutions such as corporate hierarchies\" (Piketty, 2014: 332); as such, the model I present here extends existing research by examining why corporate hierarchies vary in their strategy and structure based on factors that influence executive decision making.  \n\nA firm-centered theory of income inequality may also complement existing theories of the phenomenon. For example, research has shown differences in the extent to which computer programmable design tasks are handled by front-line operators versus engineers and whether these capital investments lead to labor force reductions. This research suggests employer choice determines whether technology is skill-biased and leads to layoffs (e.g., Kelley, 1994; Noble, 1984). Technology also provides the means for companies to alter their boundaries through outsourcing and offshoring (Sahaym, Steensma, & Schilling, 2007). Studies of the effects of minimum wage rates may be enriched by considering how many and which workers get sorted into low-wage jobs. Incorporating in existing theories how executives come to make these decisions suggests the presence of boundary conditions that can add greater precision.  \n\n### Future Research Directions  \n\nThe model I have developed here is not without limitations. First, while some of the constructs I include have well-established, valid measures, others, such as the presence of ILMs, do not. Previous research used proxies such as organizational size as an indicator of ILMs (e.g., Davis & Cobb, 2010). Over the past 30 years in the US, the firm size-ILM link, however, has weakened as many of the largest employers (e.g., Wal-Mart) now pay low wages and do not utilize ILMs to the extent that many of the large firms did in decades prior (e.g., General Motors, AT&T). Future empirical research, however, can exploit large-scale, matched firm-employee data found in many Scandinavian countries, and others such as the Longitudinal EmployerHousehold Dynamics and the Workplace Employment Relations Study that provide information on remuneration, occupational breakdowns, and employment practices of a number of large firms in a society. Cross-national comparisons, as proposed here, will likely necessitate collaborations between scholars with expertise and data access across countries.  \n\nSecond, I do not theorize about the role of labor as a key organizational stakeholder. Individually, employees have little power to impact firm strategy, but employee power can be enhanced greatly when they can mobilize and act collectively through unions. Important goals of unions are to set pay equally across similar workers and to limit the wage disjuncture across  \n\ndifferent workers, which tends to reduce wage dispersion (Western & Rosenfeld, 2011). However, because a number of studies have sought to establish a relationship between unions and income inequality, I did not offer propositions about the connection here.  \n\nNotably, however, unions play a crucial role in how much discretion firms have in structuring their employment relationships. For example, unions have been shown to deter the use of contingent employment relationships (Gramm & Schnell, 2001) and reduce levels of executive compensation (Banning & Chiles, 2o07). Their ability to influence firm outcomes depends greatly on the scope and strength of union representation rights (Beramendi & Cusack, 2009). In countries like the US, the UK (since 1980), Canada, and New Zealand, for example, unions bargain with individual firms and plants, leading to greater intra-industry variance on the impact organized labor has on wages, benefits, and conditions of work. This is not the case, however, in the Scandinavian countries and in Germany, where systems of codetermination, work councils, and other forms of industrial democracy provide workers greater power in determining the trajectory of the labor market (Scheve & Stasavage, 2009). While beyond the scope of this paper, any discussion of income inequality can be importantly informed by examining union density rates and the extent to which collective bargaining is centralized versus fragmented as these factors have influence on the types of practices firms use to structure their employment relationships (Oskarsson, 2005; Western & Rosenfeld, 2011).  \n\nFinally, my efforts to achieve parsimony led me to focus on a relatively small number of employment practices. Other practices, such as those related to high-performance work, may affect wage dispersion, and future research can explore additional ways in which employers influence rates of income inequality. Moreover, I utilized a single theoretical perspective in developing my arguments for how executives choose between a market and organizational orientation. Insights from other organizational theories, however, may also shed light on how these decisions are made. Below, I briefly elaborate on two such theoretical perspectives.  \n\nInstitutional environment. The formal and informal institutions in a society may also play a key role in how employment relationships get set and the extent to which executives have the discretion to influence them (Crossland & Hambrick, 2011). For example, whether a country's system of corporate governance favors minority versus majority shareholders influences the types of investors that take equity stakes in firms (Coffee, 2001) as well as how active the takeover market is in a country (Schneper & Guillen, 2004). Moreover, labor laws, the presence of skill formation institutions, levels of unionization, and centralized wage bargaining may play integral roles in employers′ use of ILMs, their ability to use non-standard employment relationships, and the prevalence of layoffs (Crouch, Findegold, & Sako, 1999; Dasgupta, 2001). Furthermore, in collectivist cultures, inequalities in income are more likely to be seen as disruptive and illegitimate. Such concerns, for example, are thought to be a main reason why executive compensation is much smaller in Japan than in countries like the US and the UK (The Economist, 2010). Future research can explore more closely the regulatory, normative, and cultural-cognitive institutions in a society that may impact processes of wage setting, job matching, and firm boundary placement.  \n\nOrganizational population dynamics. Insights from population ecology emphasize that a firm's strategy is influenced by the social technologies available to it at the time of its founding (Stinchcombe, 1965). Firms that emerged during eras when institutional and economic factors favored either the use of a market or organizational orientation, therefore, may be affected by these factors when determinig how employment relationships get structured. For example, firms that emerged following the managerial revolution at the turn of the $20^{\\mathrm{th}}$ century employed a higher proportion of administrative workers than firms founded in older industries (Marquis & Tilcsik, 2013). When employment is concentrated in firms that emerged in a period where an organization orientation dominated (e.g., in the US from the 1950s to the 1970s), we should expect to see firms continue to use practices associated with an organization orientation and  \n\ngreater resistance to efforts to utilize a more market-oriented approach. Future work can explore the types of employment relationships that dominated in the eras of firms’ founding to determine whether these factors influences rates of income inequality at the societal level.  \n\n## CONCLUSION  \n\nWitnessing rising levels of income inequality throughout much of the developed world and holding concerns for its impact on society, scholars from across the social sciences have made great strides in understanding the phenomenon. However, there is more work that can be done to refine, enhance, and expand our knowledge of the factors driving rates of income inequality around the world. Considering societal levels of income inequality to be, in part, an outcome of processes that set wages, match workers to positions, and determine where firm boundaries are placed opens up important and new avenues of research for scholars of both income inequality and organizations. While employer practices are not the sole determinant of income inequality, they play an important yet understudied role. Accounting for the ways in which employer practices influence societal outcomes has the potential to enrich our understanding of the dynamics undergirding income differentials and provides organizational researchers a starting point to examine this critical social issue.  \n\n#  \n\nNETENEINLED   \nAbowd, J.

In some instances, the distinction between investment and labor income gets blurred, particularly in the context of stock-based compensation. Across countries, stock option compensation sometimes appears as wage income or capital income in tax statistics, depending on the tax law (Atkinson et al., 2011). This makes cross-national analyses of stock options on income inequality complex. For the purposes of this model, labor income includes the value of options as they are earned as a condition of employment.  \n\n2 Based on my own calculations on data taken from the Standardized World Income Inequality Database (Solt, 2014).  \n\n3 I concentrate my review on explanations that involve the seting process and those that are the most common explanations for the phenomenon. Other explanations that I do not cover include family formation practices (see McCall & Percheski, 2010) and political representation dynamics (see Brady & Sosnaud, 2010).   \n4 Political scientists are also interested in the impact of income inequality on outcomes such as voter behavior (e.g., Meltzer & Richard, 1981).  \n\n# TABLE 1  \n\n### Features of Organization and Market Oriented Employment Systems  \n\nOrganizational Orientation  \n\n# Market Orientation  \n\n# Wage setting  \n\nHow do wages get set?  \n\nTied to job using formal job evaluation; based more on administrative rules; lower pay variance within and acrossjobs  \n\nTied to individual using external market mechanism; based on skills and performance; larger pay variance within and across jobs   \nExternally competitive wages; incentivize worker productivity  \n\nGoal  \n\nInternal equity; reduce costs of social comparison  \n\n# Job matching  \n\nHow do workers get matched to positions?  \n\nExternal hiring; based on skills and credentials  \n\nGoal  \n\nInternal hiring (above entry-level); based on seniority Reduce avoidable turnover; encourage development of firm-specific skills  \n\nJust-in-time skill acquisition  \n\n# Skilldevelopment  \n\nEmployer develops talent; on-the-job formal and How do workers gain skills? informal training  \n\nEmployer acquires talent; reliance on skill development outside the firm  \n\nGoal Greater stability and predictability of skill supply  \n\nAvoid costs of developing and maintaining excess internal talent  \n\n# Firm boundaries  \n\nWhere does firm place its Stable boundaries; heavy reliance on stable, full-time boundaries? employment relationships Goal Operational stability  \n\nPermeable boundaries; heavy reliance on non-standard work arrangements and work reorganization Operational flexibility  \n\n# FIGURE 1  \n\nModel of Firms’ Affect on Societal-level Income Inequality  \n\n· Finance-oriented share ownership · Takeover market · Equity-based executive pay  \n\n![](images/03ff1e81ab4e450a733c985712dbafeb7f3d4e8a9ad408c2ba57b9090bd0ccad.jpg)  \n\n![](images/a18d9aa7af1a7820467451cd3de277ebd6d84f077ae2f379d9ab117a87eef50b.jpg)  \n\n# FIGURE 2  \n\nInternal Labor Market Mechanisms and Societal-level Income Inequality  \n\n![](images/91c39c6d240c0202e9ee87927269141314ae9ceae94fae4e2ae3a915d9a74315.jpg)  \n\n# BIOGRAPHY  \n\nJ.

Institutional investors restrict lendable supply and/or call back loaned shares prior to the proxy record date to exercise voting rights. Recall is higher for investors with greater incentives to monitor and exert governance, for firms with poor performance and weak governance, and for proposals where the returns to governance are likely to be higher such as those relating to corporate control. Loan demand and the borrowing fee also increase around the record date. In the subsequent vote outcome we find higher share recall to be associated with less support for management and more support for shareholder proposals. Our results indicate that institutions value their vote and use the proxy process as an important channel for affecting corporate governance.  \n\nJEL: G32; G34; G38 Keywords: Proxy Voting, Securities Lending, Institutional Investors, Value of Voting.  \n\n## The Role of Institutional Investors in Voting: Evidence from the Securities Lending Market 1.Introduction  \n\nUnderstanding the preferences of institutional investors regarding governance is important for firms trying to attract new investors as well as for policy makers considering the regulation of different governance mechanisms. However, the mechanisms used by institutional investors to impact corporate governance tend to be private and difficult to study.  \n\nOne key governance mechanism through which institutional investors can exert influence is the proxy voting process. In this paper, we use the unique setting of the securities lending market to study the conditions that prompt institutional investors to influence firm-level governance and the extent to which investors use the proxy voting process to exercise their opinions. Most large pension funds, mutual funds, and other institutional investors have a lending program and consider it to be an important source of revenue, with estimates of $\\$800$ million in annual revenue for pension funds alone (Grene (20io)). Equity lending transfers voting rights to the borrower, typically hedge funds, and therefore lenders cannot vote shares that are on loan on the voting record date.1 Hence, institutions must decide whether to recall shares or make shares available for borrowing for an associated fee and the transfer of voting rights.  \n\nOur study uses a comprehensive daily data set comprised of lendable supply, shares on loan, and the associated borrowing fee for the period 2007-2009. Lendable supply measures the shares made available to borrow by investors with long positions in the stock, and on loan measures borrowing demand, which is the quantity actually lent out. We find a marked reduction in the lendable supply prior to the proxy record date and an increase in borrowing demand and -fees around the record date. Furthermore, lendable supply returns to normal levels immediately after the record date, consistent with institutions restricting and/or recalling their loaned shares to exercise their voting rights and resuming lending immediately after the record date.  \n\nWe make five contributions. First, our results illustrate that institutional investors value the right to vote. Analyzing the lendable supply dynamics of the equity lending market around voting record dates reveals that institutional investors recall shares to retain voting rights.2 This finding shows that institutional investors value their vote and use the proxy process as an important channel for affecting corporate governance. In addition, we show that borrowing demand and fee increase around the record day. Second, we find that institutional investors do not all value their voting rights in the same way, with considerable heterogeneity in the preferences. Third, we show that the decision to recall shares on the voting record date also varies based on firm and proposal characteristics, which typically affect the value of control rights. Fourth, we propose a metric to quantify the value of the vote and find that lenders of shares place a higher value on their vote than borrowers. Finally, we show that share recall is associated with less support for management in the subsequent voting outcome.  \n\nThe heterogeneity in recall of shares shows that institutional investors systematically differ in their desire to exert governance via proxy voting. For example, Shleifer and Vishny (1986) model the blockholder's free-rider problem and show that the willingness of shareholders to intervene will increase with the size of their stake, the value creation stemming from such intervention, but decrease with the cost of monitoring.3 Consequently, institutional investors should not be expected to recall shares en-masse on all record dates. The recall by institutional investors should differ along several dimensions including their ownership stake, investment philosophy, investment time horizon, fiduciary responsibility, ability or incentives to engage with management, and/or invest in private information required for effective monitoring (e.g. Maug (1998), Kahn and Winton (1998) and Edmans (2009). As an empirical example, Matvos and Ostrovsky (2010) find systematic heterogeneity in voting behavior even across mutual funds.  \n\nWhile we do not know the identity of the lenders and the borrowers, we study the heterogeneity in investors′ voting preferences by observing the differences in recall between firms that have a higher proportion of ownership by certain types of investors. We classify institutional ownership based on categories used previously in the literature (e.g. Bushee (1998, 2001), Bushee and Goodman (2007), and Chen, Harford, and Li (2007)) and examine blockholdings in aggregate, since these investors should have the greatest incentive to intervene through the proxy process (Maug (1998)), and those held by four types of investors: mutual funds, banks and insurance companies, pensions and endowments, and long-term investors. For aggregate blockholdings and each of the four categories, we find that the recall/restriction in lendable supply is significantly higher for firms with higher ownership relative to firms with low ownership. When examining borrowing demand, the difference is never statistically significant. Our results provide insights into the preferences of institutional investors, and suggest that institutional investors do not all have the same motivation to be active in corporate governance.  \n\nWe also examine asymmetric changes in lendable supply and borrowing demand based on underlying firm characteristics and types of proposal on the ballot. Firms with poor performance, weaker governance, and smaller firms exhibit higher recall of shares on the record date. Additionally, recall is higher for record dates associated with meetings that have important proposals on the ballot related to non-routine items, compensation, anti-takeover, and corporate control. For example, the recall effect is almost $40\\%$ higher for record dates with corporate controlrelated proposals than those without. These results support the hypothesis that shareholders value the vote and are keener to vote when it is more “important' to do so.  \n\nWhen we examine the subsequent vote outcome, we find that higher recall of lendable supply is associated with less support for management proposals, such as those relating to compensation and corporate control, and more support for shareholder proposals. In additional tests, we focus on the voting behavior of mutual funds, since these institutional investors provide a large fraction of lendable supply. Mutual funds are significantly less likely to vote in favor of contentious proposals where recall in lendable supply is greater and the proxy advisory firm ISS recommends voting against the proposal. These results on mutual fund voting address any concern that recall could be negatively associated with support because institutions recall shares to vote with management when support for management is low.  \n\nThere are several reasons why examining recall in the lending market, as opposed to the borrowing fee, improves our understanding about institutional investor voting preferences. Kolasinski, Reed, and Ringgenberg (2013) show that the supply of lendable shares is essentially flat in the equity lending market, and Prado, Saffi and Sturgess (2013) document that this market clears with high levels of slack lendable supply for the average firm. Therefore, borrowing fe can be insensitive to both changes in demand and supply. Consequently, examining changes in the borrowing fee alone may underestimate the value of the vote, and could even result in concluding that the value of the vote is close to zero. To isolate record date effects due to changes in preferences for supplying shares from changes due to demand-side effects, we use an instrumental variables setup. One of our major contributions is to show that it is important to analyze both the lendable supply and the loan demand side of the market.  \n\nThe issues we examine are particularly relevant for a period that has seen increased emphasis on both shareholder activism and proxy voting. Voting provides an important mechanism for shareholders to affect firm-level corporate governance and policies. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a literature review. Section 3 provides background on the securities lending market. Section 4 describes the data on proxy voting, securities lending, and other firmlevel corporate attributes. In Section 5, we discuss our methodology and identification strategy. Section 6 contains the main empirical results. Section 7 presents results of our empirical findings on voting outcomes and the role of lendable supply. Section 8 concludes.  \n\n## 2.  Literature Review  \n\nPrior research has attempted to examine the preferences of institutional investors based on inferences of corporate governance attributes deemed important to institutional investors. Gillan and Starks (2000) study the effectiveness of shareholder activism in the U.S. Other studies have found that institutional investors affect CEO turnover (Parrino, Sias, and Starks (2003) and Helwege, Intintoli, and Zhang (2012), anti-takeover amendments (Brickley, Lease, and Smith (1988)), executive compensation (Hartzell and Starks (2003), and mergers (Gaspar, Massa, and Matos (2005) and Chen, Harford, and Li (2007)). In an analysis of 23 countries, Aggarwal, Erel, Ferreira, and Matos (2011) find that changes in institutional ownership are positively associated with subsequent changes in firm-level governance, but the opposite is not true. Cunat, Gine and Guadalupe (2012) show that passing a governance provision is associated with an increase in shareholder value and more so when proposals are sponsored by institutions.  \n\nMaug (1998) and Kahn and Winton (1998) show how large stakes bias investors towards more shareholder activism. Edmans (2009) argues that the effectiveness of activism depends on the threat to sell shares and exit the firm, which in turn is greater for investors with larger stakes.  \n\nEmpirically Gillan and Starks (2000) examine the reaction of different types of shareholders to proposals through their voting behavior. Duan and Jiao (2014) find that for mutual funds that a larger ownership stake and lower portfolio turnover are associated with a lower probability of selling shares relative to voting with or against management. Bushee, Carter and Gerakos (2013), institutional preferences about governance and voting vary based on several factors including investment philosophy and fiduciary responsibility. Preferences may also depend on other factors such as, investment horizon and economic stakes.  \n\nIn a survey of institutional investors, McCahery, Sautner, and Starks (2011) find that corporate governance is important to institutional investors, and many institutions are willing to engage in shareholder activism via the proxy process. Recent papers such as Brav, Jiang, Partnoy, and Thomas (2008); Clifford (2008); and Klein and Zur (2009) study activism by individual funds, such as pension funds or hedge funds. Fos (20i1) shows that proxy contests play a role in disciplining managers, while Gantchev (2013) finds that proxy contests are costly and that monitoring costs wipe out activist returns, on average. Mliev and Lowry (2013) conclude that certain types of funds invest considerable resources examining firm-level governance issues, and then voting accordingly.  \n\nSome controversy exists in the existing literature regarding how changes in the supply and demand for lending shares around the record date affect the borrowing fee and what these changes imply in terms of the value of a vote. Christoffersen, Géczy, Musto, and Reed (2007) use 1998- 1999 data from a large lending agent to examine borrowing demand and fees aspects of the securities lending market around a proxy vote. They find a marginally significant increase in borrowing fee around the proxy record date. The authors conclude that the price of a vote is zero because investors are not selling their votes but willingly letting them go and speculate that this is due to information asymmetry. Examining the change in fee alone, we find that fee increases by two basis points on the record date, approximately three times as large as the value found by Christoffersen, Géczy, Musto, and Reed (2007). Using option prices, Kalay, Karakas, and Pant (2014), find the value of voting rights for the average firm to be $0.16\\%$ of the stock price with an average option maturity of 38 days.  \n\n## 3. Securities Lending Market  \n\nSecurities lending is a transaction in which the beneficial owner of the securities, normally a large institutional investor such as a pension fund or mutual fund, agrees to lend its securities to a borrower, such as a hedge fund, in exchange for collateral consisting of cash and/or other securities.4 Although lenders refer to these shares as being ^“on loan\", the lender actually transfers ownership and voting rights. Shares may be borrowed for a variety of reasons, including short selling, or for trading strategies such as convertible bond arbitrage and dividend tax-arbitrage, and possibly for empty voting. The lender earns a spread by investing the collateral in low-risk shortterm securities. In a typical U.s. loan, the collateral is $102\\%$ on domestic securities and $105\\%$ for international securities. The increased interest in proxy voting and securities lending has resulted in fund boards now paying attention not only to the fee received from a securities lending program but also to whether the securities are being loaned to “responsible\" borrowers. According to a survey of institutional investors by ISS, $37.9\\%$ of the respondents stated that a formal policy on securities lending is part of their proxy voting policy.6 Some funds require a total recall of shares, while others weigh the lost revenue against the benefits of voting on a case-by-case basis. Below, we provide some examples from funds proxy voting guidelines.  \n\n### Putnam Funds  \n\n\"The funds’ have requested that their securities lending agent recall each domestic issuer's voting securities that are on loan, in advance of the record date for the issuer's shareholder meetings, so that the funds may vote at the meetings.\"' 7  \n\n### TIAA-CREF  \n\n\"Even after we lend the securities of a portfolio company, we continue to monitor whether income from lending fees is of greater value than the voting rights that have passed to the borrower. Using the factors set forth in our policy, we conduct an analysis of the relative value of lending fees versus voting rights in any given situation. We will recall shares when we believe the exercise of voting rights may be necessary to maximize the long-term value of our investments despite the loss of lending fee revenue.’ 8  \n\nThe SEC requires funds to recall shares for “material’ events but has not defined materiality. In a survey by ISS, $92.3\\%$ of the respondents indicated that mergers and acquisitions were the most important reason to recall shares.9 One of the challenges to recalling shares is that shareholders typically do not receive the proxy material until after the record date. However, in order to vote, institutions must recall the shares by the record date.  \n\n## 4. Data  \n\n### 4.1 Securities Lending Descriptive Statistics  \n\nWe obtain a proprietary equity lending data set from Data Explorers (now Markit) for the period January 2007 to December 2009. They collct this information daily from 125 large custodians and 32 prime brokers in the securities lending industry. Our data covers more than $85\\%$ of the securities lending market. There are 4,333 firms in the equity lending sample, however the proxy voting data limits the analysis to the constituents of the Russell 3000 index. As of December 2009,there was $\\$1.55$ trillion available to lend, out of which $\\$113$ billion was actually lent out and would be considered as being on loan. Saffi and Sigurdsson (2011) provide a detailed description Of thedata.  \n\nThe main dependent variables in our study are defined as follows: lendable supply (SUPPLY) is the dollar value of supply available on a given day relative to a firm's market capitalization; loan quantity (ONLOAN) is the dollar value of shares on loan relative to market capitalization; utilization rate (UTILIZATION) is ONLOAN divided by SUPPLY; and borrowing fee (FEE) is the average transaction-weighted rate reported by Data Explorers and expressed in basis points (bps) per annum. Firms that have a fee greater than 100 basis points $(1\\%)$ are commonly considered to be SPECIAL. Such firms are more closely watched by investors and are more expensive to borrow.  \n\nIn Table 1, we present descriptive statistics for the equity lending market. On average, $23.78\\%$ of a firm's market capitalization is available for lending, with $4.06\\%$ being on loan and resulting in a utilization rate  of $17.78\\%$ . The minimum and maximum values of SUPPLY (winsorized at the $1\\%$ level) are $1.65\\%$ and $48.57\\%$ , respectively. ONLOAN varies from a high of $20.49\\%$ to a low of $0.01\\%$ . Some firms are heavily borrowed while others are not borrowed at all. UTILIZATION is as high as $69\\%$ in our sample.  \n\nThe mean annualized fee is 48.3 bps, implying that it is very cheap, on average, to borrow shares. However, this cost can quickly rise for firms in high demand reaching a maximum of 1,114 bps in our winsorized sample. About $9\\%$ of the firms have a fee greater than 100 basis points and are considered to be “on special\". The mean and median number of days for which loans are outstanding is 16 days and one day, respectively. Most loans are “open ended’\" and rolled over every day without a specific maturity date.  \n\nFigure 1 plots lendable supply, loan demand, utilization, and borrowing fees for the period starting 30 days before the record date and ending 30 days after the record date. We define the record date (day 0) as the event date. For our 7,415 voting record dates, the average time between the record date and the shareholder meeting is 53 days. The supply of shares available to lend as a fraction of market capitalization starts to decrease about 20 days before a vote and is at its lowest point on day O, the record date. SUPPLY is on average equal to $24.09\\%$ on day -30 and reduces to $22.16\\%$ by the record date. This drop in supply is consistent with institutions restricting or recalling their shares at the time of a vote. On the first day after the record date, SUPPLY returns to preevent levels in line with institutions not wanting to lose revenue from lending.  \n\nThe results suggest that institutions start restricting supply in advance of the proxy record date to ensure that shares can be recalled and that they can exercise the vote. In practice, institutions are generally advised to allow two weeks for a recall prior to a proxy vote, and possibly longer if the firm is “special\". Consistent with industry practice, we find that the drop in lendable supply starts to occur about two weeks before the record.1° Institutions might also recall shares in advance to provide sufficient notice to borrowers, thus alleviating possible problems for borrowers to find shares and improving an institution's reputation as a stable and reliable lender.11  \n\nExamining the plot for borrowing demand (ONLOAN) shows a small increase around the record date. On day -30, on average, $4.10\\%$ of a firm's market capitalization is on loan, and by the record date it grows to $4.13\\%$ , increasing by only $0.03\\%$ of a firm’s market capitalization. Finally, UTILIZATION and FEE both increase in the 20 days prior to the record date. This result adds insight to Blocher, Reed and Van Wesep (2013), who argue that shifts in supply matters only for firms on special by revealing that supply shifts become important even at relatively low levels of utilization.  \n\n### 4.2 Other Firm-Level Data  \n\nWe use CRSP to obtain share price (PRICE), market capitalization (SIZE), turnover (TURNOVER), and bid-ask spread (SPREAD). We use only common shares with price over $\\$1$ and further merge the data to Compustat and collect data on book equity (EQUITY) to calculate the book-to-market equity ratio (BM). We exclude closed-end funds, American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) and real estate investment trusts (REITs). We obtain ownership data from the Thomson Reuters CDA/Spectrum database on SEC 13F filings. The 13F filings must be reported on a quarterly basis by all investment companies and professional money managers with assets Over $\\$100$ million under management. For each firm, we calculate total institutional ownership as a percentage of market capitalization (INST) and institutional ownership concentration (INST CONC), measured as the Hirschman-Herfindahl index normalized between zero and one. We use firm-level corporate governance index GOV41 as in Aggarwal, Erel, Ferreira, and Matos (2011). GOV4l assigns a value of one to each of the 41 governance attributes if the company meets minimally acceptable governance guidelines on that attribute and zero otherwise. We classify institutional ownership into five groups: (1) all $5\\%$ or more blockholders; (2) bank blockholders includes banks and insurance companies; (3) mutual funds blockholders includes investment companies; (4) pensions and endowments; and (5) long term blockholders are those that hold their stake for more than one year.12.13  \n\n### 4.3 Proxy Voting Descriptive Statistics  \n\nProxy voting analysis examines 56,220 proposals for 7,415 record-dates obtained from ISS. The proxy voting data cover the Russell 3000 index constituents and include proposal-level characteristics such as proposal description, sponsor, management's recommendation, ISS's recommendation, threshold for the proposal to pass, votes cast, and voting result.  \n\nWe present proxy voting characteristics in Panel A of Table 3. On average, $86.62\\%$ of votes are cast on proxy proposals, with $91.86\\%$ of those votes being in favor and only $7.54\\%$ against. This overwhelming majority in favor of proposals is reflected in the $70.16\\%$ vote margin by which they pass. We create different categories of proposals, with the explicit aim of exploring those that might be considered as contentious, based on disagreement between different parties, and those that are associated with significant events. First, we classify proposals as routine and non-routine. NYSE Rule 452 outlines non-routine proxy proposals as those in which broker voting is not allowed. Examples include proposals relating to anti-takeover provisions, stock capitalization and mergers. Second, we examine proposals relating specifically to anti-takeover provisions ( $G\\cdot$ INDEX) included in the G-Index developed by Gompers, Ishi, and Metrick (2003), compensation proposals (COMP), and those that relate to mergers/proxy contests (CORP CONTROL).  \n\nIn Panel B of Table 3 we describe the voting outcome of non-routine proposals, which comprise $12.25\\%$ of the total sample. These proposals have almost three times more votes cast against the proposal than found for the total sample. Almost $60\\%$ of non-routine proposals are related to compensation. Shareholder-sponsored proposals are a much smaller subset (only $25.56\\%,$ and usually fail to pass, receiving an average of $40\\%$ of FOR votes, although when ISS is in favor of the proposal the average proportion of FOR votes increase to $46.17\\%$ . Examples of shareholder-sponsored proposals include Say on Pay; requests that the firm provide cumulative voting; reduce supermajority voting; require independent chairman of board; require a majority vote for the election of directors; and declassify the board of directors. We also provide descriptive statistics on non-routine proposals that are likely to attract most attention from investors. Proposals relating to compensation, anti-takeover, and corporate control receive far more negative votes than the average for all proposals discussed earlier.  \n\n## 5. Methodology  \n\n### 5.1 Instrumental Variables Framework  \n\nOur empirical strategy estimates quantity variables (i.e. SUPPLY or ONLOAN) as a function of price $(F E E)$ , a record date dummy (RDATE), and other controls. We employ the instrumental variables estimator developed by Angrist, Graddy and Imbens (2000) to infer the price sensitivity of SUPPLY and ONLOAN. Kolasinski, Reed and Ringgenberg (2013) use a similar approach to estimate how the supply schedule varies with proxies for searching frictions in the equity lending market. If a restriction in supply results in a higher fee, and these higher prices result in lower demand, it is relatively straightforward to show that standard OLS estimates that ignore endogeneity will result in downward bias in estimates for record date demand shifts. Similarly, ignoring endogeneity can also lead to a downward bias in lendable supply shifts at the record date due to changes in demand. Therefore, we estimate the following IV regression for lendable supply (SUPPLY) in the $(-30,+30)$ days period around the record date:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{s t a g e:\\quad F E_{i,t}=\\alpha_{i}^{F1}+\\alpha_{t}^{F1}+\\gamma^{F1}R D A T E_{i,t}+\\theta_{2}^{F1}I N S T R U_{s_{i,t}}+\\delta^{F1}C o n t r o l s_{i,t}+\\varepsilon_{i,t}^{F1}}\\ &{\\iota_{~s t a g e:}S U P P L Y_{i,t}=\\alpha_{i}^{S}+\\alpha_{t}^{S}+\\gamma^{S}R D A T E_{i,t}+\\beta_{1}^{S}F E{E}_{i,t}+\\beta_{2}^{S}R D A T E*F E{E}_{i,t}++\\delta^{S}C o n t r o l s_{i,t}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFor borrowing demand (ONLOAN) we estimate: 1st st( $\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\imath g e:\\quad\\quad F E_{i,t}=\\alpha_{i}^{F2}+\\alpha_{t}^{F2}+\\gamma^{F2}R D A T E_{i,t}+\\theta_{2}^{F2}I N S T R U_{D_{i,t}}+\\delta^{F2}C o n t r o l s_{i,t}+\\varepsilon_{i,t}^{F2},}\\ &{\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad}\\ &{a g e:O N L O A N_{i,t}=\\alpha_{i}^{D}+\\alpha_{t}^{D}+\\gamma^{D}R D A T E_{i,t}+\\beta_{1}^{D}F E E_{i,t}+\\beta_{2}^{D}R D A T E*F E{E}_{i,t}+\\delta^{D}C o n t r o l s_{i,t}+\\beta_{3}^{D},}\\end{array}$ (# 2nd st t，（ where INSTRUp and INSTR $U s$ are the exogenous instruments used to identify $F E E$ in the second stage for each of the two quantity variables (i.e. ONLOAN and SUPPLY), $\\alpha_{i}$ and $\\alpha_{t}$ are firm and year fixed effects respectively, $\\upbeta_{2}$ represents the elasticity on the record date and  represents the shift in quantity on the record date.14 We include firm and year fixed effects to ensure robustness to heteroskedasticity as well common year-specific shocks.  \n\nThe estimates above compare record date shifts in lendable supply and borrowing demand with non-record date levels for the same firm. We capture not only the recall in lendable supply and increase in borrowing demand on the record date $(\\gamma^{S}$ and $\\gamma^{D}$ ) but also changes in the fee-elasticity of SUPPLY and ONLOAN on the record date $\\beta_{2}^{S}$ and $\\beta_{2}^{D}$ ).13 Employing an IV framework to examine lendable supply, which measures the quantity of shares made available to borrow, and borrowing demand, which measures the quantity of shares borrowed, at the record date is similar to that used in the labor market.16 Wages are equivalent to lending fees $(F E E)$ , the employment rate is equivalent to loan demand (ONLOAN), and the size of the labor force is equivalent to lendable supply (SUPPLY). For example, Eissa and Liebman (1996) study how changes in the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) affects labor force participation and hours worked of single mothers. In our context, the RDATE variable is equivalent to a dummy controlling for EITC tax change in 1986, while SUPPLY is equivalent to labor market participation. These tax changes are expected to not only to affect the level of quantity supplied (i.e. SUPPLY in our case) but also the impact of wages on participation rates (i.e. similar to our estimates for the RDATE\\*FEE coefficient).  \n\n### 5.2 Choice of Instruments  \n\nWe start by introducing the instruments necessary to implement the empirical strategy described earlier. Identification requires finding instruments that are exogenously related to FEE but unrelated to the error term in the SUPPLY and ONLOAN equations. For example, in equation (4) for ONLOAN we need variables that affect FEE but not demand, such that we can find estimated $\\widehat{F E E}$ and $R D A\\widehat{T E*}\\cal{F}\\cal{E}\\cal{E}$ values that are uncorrelated with the error term $\\varepsilon_{i,t}^{D}$ .More specifically, we instrument demand to map out changes in lendable supply (i.e. equations (1)-(2)) and instrument lendable supply to map out changes in borrowing demand to control for the endogeneity between quantity and price (i.e. equations (3)-(4)).  \n\nThis approach requires valid instruments that satisfy the exclusion restriction, i.e., the instrument must not have any direct impact on the dependent variable or through omitted variables. Thus, we need to identify variables that affect FEE through changes in ONLOAN (SUPPLY) but are unrelated to SUPPLY (ONLOAN).  \n\nTo identify SUPPLY, we initially consider the following variables that capture demandrelated shocks to FEE: hedging demand, earnings surprise, and discretionary accruals. Hedging Demand is proposed by Hwang, Liu and Xu (2013), who argue that short selling can help correct under-pricing of firms by facilitating the hedging of industry risk. If other firms in the same industry become under-valued, arbitrageurs should purchase the under-valued firms and short substitute securities. Thus, we expect the demand for shorting stock $i$ to be high when the demand for going long shares of peers, $j$ , is high. Underpricing is measured as low relative cumulative returns in the previous year, where relative returns are defined as the equal-weighted cumulative return in the past 252 days of related firms (excluding the firm's own returns) with the same fourdigit GICS industry classification code.  \n\nOur second instrument is the standardized unexpected earnings measure, SUE, defined as the last quarter's earnings surprise relative to analysts’ median earnings forecasts (Livnat and Mendenhall (2006). Christophe, Ferri and Angel (2004) show that short interest in periods without earnings announcements is higher for stocks with low SUE, leading us to expect that demand is negatively related to SUE. Furthermore, short seling does not increase prior to earnings announcements. Ke and Ramalingegowda (2005) show that high-turnover institutional investors trade to exploit post earnings announcement drift but that “dedicated\" and “quasi-indexing\" institutions, both long-horizon investors, do not. Hence, we do not expect that variation in SUE will affect equity lendable supply via changes in the portfolio of long-term institutions.  \n\nFinally, following Kolasinski, Reed, and Ringgenberg (2013), we consider discretionary accruals, ACCRUALS, as computed in Sloan (1996), as a potential instrument. Discretionary accruals constitute a decision by management to shift earnings from one period to another, and are therefore temporary in nature. Further, they tend to be short-term and prior literature finds that short selling is positively related to discretionary accruals (e.g., Kolasinski, Cao, Reed and Dhaliwal (2007)).  \n\nTo identify ONLOAN, we consider two variables to instrument FEE that should be unrelated to loan demand: passive ownership (PASSIVE) and institutional ownership concentration (INST CONC). Passive ownership is defined as the fraction of the firm held by funds classifying themselves as index funds, as reported to the SEC on the N-SAR form (see Evans, Ferreira and Prado (2013). These funds comprise passive investors that track a benchmark index and have long-term horizons that can earn additional income by lending their stock holdings. D'Avolio (2002) describes how “it is the passive indexers who participate most extensively in their custodian's lending program\". Evans, Ferreira and Prado (2013) report that most index funds in their sample can and do lend their shares, while Prado, Saffi and Sturgess (2013) show that index fund ownership explains SUPPLY over and above total institutional ownership. Given their passive strategies, it is unlikely that passive funds are concerned with short-term fluctuations in stock prices and consequently, the demand for shorting (ONLOAM), making it a suitable instrument. Stock holdings of these funds are obtained from Morningstar's holdings data and aggregated for each firm on a given quarter.  \n\nThe second instrument we employ is ownership concentration (INST CONC), measured using the Hirschman-Herfindahl index. Prado, Saffi and Sturgess (2013) show that institutional ownership concentration is an important determinant of SUPPLY even after controlling for total ownership. A more concentrated ownership will result in larger shareholders having more power and more interest in impacting lendable supply. If short sale constraints lead to overpricing as in Miller (1977), shareholders can try to limit supply to support prices of their own shares. Hence, more concentrated owners may prefer not to lend stock. Kolasinski, Reed, and Ringgenberg (2013) argue that short sales strategies have short horizons. Thus if concentrated ownership is long-term in terms of investment horizon, it should not be affected by demand for loans in the short term, making it a candidate instrument for SUPPLY.  \n\n## 6. Empirical Results  \n\n### 6.1 Securities Lending Market and Fee  \n\nWe first examine the patterns in lendable supply and borrowing demand conditioning on borrowing fee. The evidence in Table 2 illustrates potential issues from ignoring endogeneity and focusing on change in fee alone in estimating the value of the vote. We split the sample of firms into those that are cheap to borrow versus those that “On Special' (i.e. those with borrowing fee greater than 100 bps at $\\mathrm{t}=-30$ ). We also show statistics for companies that are extremely expensive to borrow and have fees above 1,000 bps at $\\mathrm{t}{=}{-}30$ . Of the 7,415 record dates only 79 are associated with firms that have borrowing fees above 1,000 bps. Panel A of Table 2 reports averages of equity lending variables at t-30. The average lendable supply as percentage of market capitalization is $14.52\\%$ for firms On Special relative to $25.02\\%$ for firms that are not. Borrowing demand is also higher for the On Special group. The lower supply and higher demand results in a much higher annualized fee of 429 bps for the On Special group, compared with a fee of 9.30 bps for the other group. If investors incorporate the cost of borrowing into the decision to lend or borrow then we expect different record date behavior between the high fee and low fee groups.  \n\nPanel B of Table 2 reports the change in lendable supply and borrowing demand on the record date compared with the average for the $(-30,+30)$ window excluding the record date. The lendable supply of the On Special group changes by less when compared with the non-special firms both in absolute terms and percentage terms. This implies that lenders recal/restrict more shares when fee is low partly because the potential loss of lending revenue is low. Borrowing demand increases for the non-special firms but actually decreases on the record date for the On Special group. These descriptive statistics illustrate that not only borrowing fee plays a role in the decision to lend/borrow but also that the change in fee around the record date is not a sufficient proxy for the value of the vote. Even for On Special firms, the change in fee is small simply because of the slack in supply that is typical in the market for equity lending (UTILIZATION is near $50\\%$ even for FEE>1000 bps split). Combined, these descriptive statistics and the slack in supply provide an important explanation for the low value of the vote based on average fee (e.g. as reported by Christoffersen, Géczy, Musto, and Reed (2007)). Additionally, the fact that fee changes around the record date in response to changes in lendable supply and borrowing demand means that one should incorporate borrowing fee in an analysis of equity lending to capture the endogenous relationship between quantities and prices.  \n\n### 6.2 OLS Estimations and Falsification Tests  \n\nHaving made an a priori case for our instruments, we also conduct formal empirical falsification tests of their validity. We examine if our prospective instruments affect FEE but are unrelated to SUPPLY (in the case of equations (1) and (2)) or ONLOAN (in the case of equations (3)-(4)). If this is the case, we infer that our instruments meet the exclusion restriction. To conduct our falsification tests we estimate OLS specifications for lendable supply and borrowing demand based on equations (2) and (4), and also for FEE, ignoring endogeneity concerns. We include firm and year fixed effects, and cluster the standard errors at the year-level to ensure robustness to heteroskedasticity as well as serial and cross-sectional correlation. In addition to offering evidence on the validity of our instruments this exercise also offers a glimpse into the record date activity in the equity lending market and further illustrates endogeneity concerns.  \n\nFor each of the 7,415 record dates, we consider an event window of -30 days to $+30$ days, where $\\scriptstyle{\\mathbf{t=0}}$ is the proxy voting record date. We include a record date dummy (RDATE) to examine whether there is abnormal equity lending market activity on the record date compared to the 30 days before and after the record date. We follow Prado, Saffi and Sturgess (2013) by including the following variables to explain securities lending. To control for ownership, we use INST, institutional ownership at the end of the previous quarter measured as a percentage of market capitalization. We use the previous quarter's values of log of market capitalization (SIZE), bookto-market ratio $(B M)$ , turnover (TURNOVER), and bid-ask spread (SPREAD) as explanatory variables to control for firm characteristics. We include a dummy for firms with a share price below five dollars $(P R I C E<\\$5$ . Similar to Kolasinski, Reed and Ringgenberg (2013), we also include short-term momentum (Short-Term Mom) measured as the cumulative return over the five previous days and long-term momentum (Long-Term Mom) as the cumulative return over the previous 252 trading days.  \n\nIn Table 4 we present the OLS estimations for SUPPLY, ONLOAN, and FEE. In column 1 of Table 4 we test our candidate instruments for ONLOAN, i.e. Hedging Demand, SUE, and ACCRUALS, by examining their effect on SUPPLY. As expected, all three potential instruments are unrelated to SUPPLY. Further, the results for ONLOAN in column 3 show that Hedging Demand and SUE are negatively related to ONLOAN, and ACCRUALS is positively related to ONLOAN. However, examining the results in column 5 we find that while changes in Hedging Demand and SUE affect FEE through ONLOAN, ACCRUALS do not affect FEE. Accordingly, we only adopt Hedging Demand and SUE as instruments for ONLOAN.  \n\nSwitching attention to our instruments for SUPPLY, if candidate instruments meet the exclusion restriction then we should expect them to explain SUPPLY but have no explanatory power in the estimation of ONLOAN. Examining the coefficients for PASSIVE and INST CONC in columns 1 and 3 we find this to be the case. Further, both changes in PASSIVE and INST CONC explain changes in fee through SUPPLY. Altogether, the results of the falsification tests support our choice of instruments for both the SUPPLY and ONLOAN equations.  \n\nThe OLS estimations in Table 4 also present evidence of changes on the record date. The results in columns 1, 3 and 5, show respectively that SUPPLY decreases, ONLOAN increases, and FEE increases on the record date (measured by the RDATE coefficient). As a percentage of market capitalization, the change in lendable supply of $-1.64\\%$ is approximately twenty times larger in magnitude than the increase in ONLOAN of $0.08\\%$ . In terms of economic significance, the record date impact on SUPPLY indicates that on average, lendable supply is approximately $7\\%$ lower on the record date compared with the mean over the $[-30,+30]$ sample window. These findings suggest that investors value their vote and therefore recall shares in order to exercise their vote. For ONLOAN, the record date increase is around $2\\%$ of themean over the $[-30,+30]$ samplewindow.17  \n\nFurther examination of results for lendable supply, reveal that it is higher when institutional ownership (INST) is higher, when institutional ownership is dispersed (INST CONC), for larger firms (SIZE), and value firms (BM). Turning to columns 3 and 4, borrowing demand is higher if institutional ownership is higher, and for firms that are more liquid. Unsurprisingly, there is a negative and significant association between prior performance and borrowing demand. In addition to standard control variables, we include firm-level corporate governance, GOV41. Firms with better governance have higher (lower) lendable supply (borrowing demand). These results are consistent with better governance alleviating shareholders? concerns that share lending will be detrimental to the value of their holdings, possibly because good governance deters short-selling.  \n\nColumn 5 of Table 4 reports the results for FEE. The coefficient of RDATE is positive and significant at $1\\%$ , implying that the fee for borrowing stock increases on the record date. This corresponds to a $3.68\\%$ increase relative to mean over the $[-30,+30]$ sample window, suggesting that the market values voting. However, the coefficient of 1.776 implies that the value of the vote if measured as the change in fee is economically small.  \n\nIn columns 2 and 4 we also include FEE directly in the OLS estimations of SUPPLY and ONLOAN respectively. In the absence of endogeneity concerns one should expect SUPPLY (ONLOAN) to be increasing (decreasing) in FEE. However, the estimated coefficients are precisely the opposite of this, reflecting instead the endogenous relationship between FEE and quantity. This result reinforces our endogeneity concerns highlighted in Section 5.1. The borrowing fee itself changes around the record date in response to changes in supply and demand and therefore one should not only incorporate borrowing fee in an analysis of equity lending quantities but also address the endogenous relationship between quantity and prices.  \n\n### 6.3 Securities Lending around Proxy Record Dates  \n\nFocusing on lendable supply, our empirical strategy estimates SUPPLY as a function of the simultaneously determined price (FEE), a record date dummy (RDATE), and the interaction of price and the record date dummy (RDATE\\*FEE), as in specification (2). In the first stage, we employ instruments for ONLOAN to estimate exogenous shifts in FEE. The previous estimated equation shown in column 5 of Table 4 gives the first stage estimates for FEE.  \n\nTable 5 displays our main second-stage results for equations (2) and (4) using the instrumented fee from the first stage. All equations include the firm characteristics described above as control variables, firm and year fixed effects, and standard errors clustered by firm. Columns 1 and 2 show estimates for SUPPLY with and without the RDATE\\*FEE coefficient. In column 1, the record date effect equals $-1.625\\%$ , close to the effect presented in Table 4. This recall in lendable supply indicates that lenders of shares recall their shares because they value their vote. Further, we find that, in general, SUPPLY is insensitive to fee within firm, consistent with a flat supply curve. This is in stark contrast to the negative association documented in OLS estimates in Table 4. In column 2, we include the interaction term RDATE\\*FEE. The coefficient on RDATE\\*FEE is positive and statistically significant at the $10\\%$ level, implying that the recall of shares at the record date is sensitive to borrowing fee and that recall is lower if the fee received by lenders is higher. The Kleibergen-Paap statistic tests if the instruments are sufficiently correlated with the included endogenous regressors. We can safely reject the null that endogenous variables are under-identified and obtain similar conclusions using the Cragg-Donald Wald statistic. Because there are two or more instruments for lending supply and borrowing demand we also perform the J-test of over-identifying restrictions under the assumption that at least one instrument is exogenous. Results show that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that our instruments are exogenous.  \n\nNext, we turn our attention to those participants that borrow stock around the record date. Columns 3 and 4 report results for specification (4) using ONLOAN as the dependent variable. The positive and statistically significant RDATE coefficients indicate an increase in borrowing demand on the record date. However, borrowing demand is lower for firms with higher borrowing fee. The statistically significant coefficient for RDATE\\*FEE implies that for very expensive firms demand may actually decreases on the record date, in line with the descriptive statistics shown for ON SPECIAL firms in Table 2.  \n\nOverall, the estimated change in lendable supply on the record date is much larger than the change in borrowing demand. These results support the hypothesis that lenders, such as pension funds and mutual funds, weigh their vote and the potential lending income before restricting lendable supply. The decrease in lendable supply means that investors assign a higher value to voting than the potential income they could earn from lending.  \n\n### 6.4 Heterogeneity in Preferences of Institutional Investors  \n\nInstitutional investors differ along several dimensions that affect their willingness to exert governance through voting (e.g. Matvos and Ostrovsky (2010) and Duan and Jiao (2014)). Heterogeneity in voting preferences will depend on several factors including their overall investment philosophy, investment horizon, fiduciary responsibility, ability or incentives to engage with management and/or invest in private information required for effective monitoring.  \n\nThese differences in ownership compositions are likely to be reflected in the equity lending market activity on the record date. For example, institutions with larger economic stakes, such as blockholders, should be able to better overcome the free-rider problem highlighted by Shleifer and Vishny (1986) and thus have the incentive to both monitor and govern through voting. Therefore, we focus on blockholdings when examining the preferences of institutional investors.  \n\nTable 6 presents results on heterogeneity of institutional preferences by examining alternative ownership structures. We examine the composition of institutional ownership, rather than the composition of institutional lending, because the securities lending data does not provide the identity of the lender and borrower. Consequently, our empirical analysis on investor heterogeneity relies on differences in ownership at the firm-level, rather than heterogeneity at the lending level. We repeat the IV estimations presented in Table 5 but replace the RDATE dummy with RDATE\\*HIGH and RDATE\\*LOW. The HIGH (LOW) dummy variable indicates the ownership composition in question. Using total blockholdings as an example, HIGH (LOW) takes the value of one if institutional blockholding is above (below) the median. This setup allows us to examine the change in lendable supply and borrowing demand based on different types of institutional investors. We examine total institutional ownership, aggregate blockholdings and those blocks belonging to four types of investors: mutual funds, banks and insurance companies, pension funds and endowments using the classification in Bushee and Goodman (2007), while we define the proportion of long-term investors based on Chen, Harford and Li (2007).  \n\nTo provide a benchmark, Panel A of Table 6 reports results based on total institutional ownership. We find no significant difference in the change in SUPPLY or ONLOAN on record date between firms below and above the median. However, this result changes when we focus on blockholders in Panel B. Large blockholders have more incentives to monitor the firm, which results in greater record date recall. In the lendable supply equation, the coefficient of RDATE\\*HIGH is -2.915 while the coefficient of RDATE\\*LOW is -1.688, and the difference is statistically significant. The negative and significant coefficients imply that both high and low blockholders recall shares, but we find the recall to be greater for firms with greater blockholdings. In panels C, D and E, we report results using blockholdings held by mutual funds, banks and insurance companies, and pension funds and endowments, respectively. These types of institutional investors have more fiduciary responsibilities than other types of institutions. Both mutual funds and the pension funds and endowments groups are active participants in the securities lending market. Again, we find that larger holdings by these groups of institutions results in higher recall. In Panel F, we show that long-term investors, who are more likely to be interested in corporate governance and have incentives to engage with management, recall more of their shares on the record date. The results are similar if the high/low categories are based on total ownership rather than blockholdings.  \n\nIn each case, we repeat the analysis for borrowing demand and find that the demand to borrow shares increases for each type of investor, however, the difference between high and low ownership type is not significant.  \n\n### 6.5 Heterogeneity in Firm and Proposal Characteristics  \n\nThe benefits of shareholder intervention may vary not only with their individual stake but also with the value originating from such intervention. Consequently, recall should also be a function of both firm and proposal characteristics. In Table 7, we examine changes in lendable supply and borrowing demand on the record date based on several firm characteristics: corporate governance, stock returns during the past 12-months, and market capitalization. For each of these characteristics, we expect the interest in voting to vary. For example, the value of the vote is likely to be greater for firms with weak governance when compared to firms with strong governance. Within firm, there may be time-series variation in voting rights. For example, in periods of low returns investors may place a higher value on implementing change through voting. Finally, the value of the vote might vary with size because the vote may hold more influence in smaller firms where ownership is less dispersed. Panel A of Table 7 splits firms into low and high corporate governance based on GOV41. Institutional investors prefer not to lend out shares on the record date for firms with weak governance. The interaction of RDATE\\* LOW based on firm-level corporate governance is -2.446 and for RDATE\\* HIGH the coefficient is -1.727. Both coefficients and the difference are statistically significant. Again, the results suggest that on average, the recall of lendable supply occurs for all firms, and is higher for firms with weak governance. In the case of firms with weaker governance, institutional investors are even more interested in recalling their shares and voting with their voice.  \n\nIn Panel B, we present splits by low and high monthly returns in the preceding twelve months. Share lenders are particularly interested in exercising their vote in firms that are not performing well, where they can use the vote to bring about change at the firm. We find that the recall is larger for firms that have performed below the median. In Panel C, the sample is split based on market capitalization and we find that recall is significant higher in smaller firms. These firms likely face bigger information asymmetry problems and we would expect that lenders would have more incentives to exercise their opinions through voting. In all panels, the difference between low and high groups is not significant for borrowing demand.  \n\nIn Panels D to $\\mathbf{G}$ we also examine changes in lendable supply and borrowing demand around record dates associated with proxy events that are deemed to be more “important” to shareholders. We report results using four alternative splits based on the presence of at least one of the following types of proposals: non-routine, compensation-related, anti-takeover, and corporate control (proxy contests and mergers). We split the sample based on whether the record date is associated with a proxy event or not in the ballot. However, we omit firms from both subsamples that do not have at least one proxy event in question.  \n\nIn Panel D of Table 7, we show results for record dates with and without non-routine proposals. Non-routine proxy proposals include proposals relating to anti-takeover provisions, stock capitalization and mergers. For SUPPLY, we find higher recall when at least one non-routine proposal is present in the ballot but find no statistical difference for ONLOAN.  \n\nPanel E splits the sample according to the presence of at least one compensation-related proposal and yields similar results. With the increased prominence of corporate governance concerns, managerial compensation policies have become a focus of investors? attention and we expect it to be reflected into a higher value of the vote. The importance of compensation related proxy proposals is revealed in the results. The estimated SUPPLY change on record dates with compensation related proposals, -2.608, is $16\\%$ more negative than on record dates with those proposals. Again, we find no significant difference on the demand side.  \n\nThe third group of contentious proposals we consider in Panel F is based on anti-takeover provisions( $G$ -INDEX) included in the G-Index developed by Gompers, Ishi, and Metrick (2003). We find that record dates with $G$ -INDEX related proposals have higher recalls than non-G-INDEX related proposals and the difference is statistically significant.  \n\nFinally, in Panel G of Table 7, we consider record dates with proposals related to corporate control by examining proxy contests and mergers. In a proxy contest, shareholders vote to resolve a conflict between the firm's management and board of directors, referred to as “incumbents\", and a group of shareholders, referred to as “dissidents\". Some examples of high profile proxy contests include Carl Icahn's efforts to unseat Yahoo's board in 2008, and Hewlett Packard - Compaq merger in 2001. Dissident shareholders can initiate the proxy contest by filing a preliminary proxy statement PREC14A and definitive proxy statement in connection with contested solicitations DEFC14A. Data on proxy contests are hand-collected and supplemented with data from Sharkrepellent.net, an organization that covers proxy fights and activism; for mergers we identify proposals for targets and acquirers in the ISS database. The change in SUPPLY on record dates with corporate control related proposals is almost $40\\%$ larger than those without those types of proposals. For borrowers, the difference in demand between corporate control and non-corporate control related proposals is not statistically significant.  \n\nIn summary, we show that the value of the vote varies based on type of investor, firm characteristics, and proposal types on the lendable supply side. These results provide evidence that institutional investors monitor firms and selectively recall shares to vote, and rule out that institutional investors recall their shares mechanically for window dressing purposes.  \n\n### 6.6  Estimating the Value of the Vote for Institutional Investors  \n\nThe results on recall of lendable supply around the record date illustrate that while some institutions recall shares to exert governance through voting, other institutions continue to lend shares. This has significant implication for estimating the value of the vote using the equity lending market: so long as some institutions continue to provide enough shares to meet the demand, the recall in supply or an increase in demand may have little impact on borrowing fee. As shown by Kolasinski, Reed, and Ringgenberg (2013), and Prado, Saffi and Sturgess (2013) this slack supply situation is the norm in this market.  \n\nIn an attempt to provide a meaningful estimate for the value of a vote, we examine the change in the borrowing fee on the record date that would offer lenders sufficient compensation to continue lending at the same levels observed in non-record date days rather than recall shares.18 Methodologically, in terms of equation (2) this is equivalent to setting the combined record date effect on estimated quantities to zero and solving for fee given the estimated parameters. Therefore, wesolve $\\gamma^{S}+\\beta_{2}^{S}F e e=0$ , such that the value of the vote, VVOTE, is defined as:  \n\n$$\nV V O T E_{S u p p l y}=-\\frac{\\gamma^{S}}{\\beta_{2}^{S}}\n$$  \n\nSince VVOTE is determined as a function of estimated coefficients, representing the average shift in quantity and price-elasticity across record dates, it is equivalent to the fee required to ensure zero recall, relative to non-record date days, for the average stock. Consequently, one might interpret VVOTE as the value of the vote for the institution with the highest valuation rather than the marginal institution. The non-linear combination of parameters required to compute VvOTE leads us to use the delta method to compute standard errors and test for statistical significance. The estimate for $V V O T E_{S u p p l y}$ is equal to 267.8 bps in annualized terms (1.06 bps per day) with an estimated standard error equal to 119 bps, being significant at the $1\\%$ value. We find that lenders assign almost twice as much value to votes than borowers on the record date. The fact that investors start to recall their shares around twenty days (Figure 2) before the record date affects the economic interpretation of the value of the vote. This implies that lenders are willing to give up $((20/252)^{*}267.8/100{=})\\mathrm{~C~}$ $0.2\\%$ of the value of shares available to borrow to vote.  \n\nWhile our focus is on institutional investors, we can also estimate VVOTE for those investors that demand shares around the record date. VVOTEpemana is equal to 11.4 bps in annualized terms (0.44 bps per day) and has a standard error equal to 17 bps, also significant at the $1\\%$ level.  \n\nThe fact that institutions spend time and resources to set up policy, monitor, and selectively recall reflects that they care about their vote.19 This is another reason for why the value of the vote may not be fully captured by the fee and our estimates are likely a lower bound since they do not fully capture these unobservable costs.  \n\n## 7. Voting Outcome  \n\nTo understand how institutional voting shapes proxy outcomes, in this section we examine whether the recall of supply by institutional investors has any impact on the vote outcome at the shareholder meeting. We estimate regressions for the 6,887 non-routine proposals where the dependent variable is FOR, the percentage of votes in favor of a proposal.20 For each proposal we test if the restriction in lendable supply and the increase in demand around the record date play a role on how votes are cast on the subsequent meeting date. Importantly, the meeting date is on average 53 days after the record date. If institutions recall lendable supply to exercise their vote, then we should expect that voting outcome is associated with recalled supply.  \n\nThe independent equity lending variables are the change in lendable supply, 4SUPPLY, and the change in borrowing demand, 4ONLOAN. These changes are based on the average lendable supply and on loan during days ( $\\mathrm{\\Deltat}=-30$ to $-20$ )to the record date $(\\mathbf{t}{=}0)$ .Weinclude indicator variables for management proposals that management supports and the proxy advisory service ISS opposes (DISS), for shareholder-sponsored proposals (DSHR), and for proposals relating to compensation (COMP), G-INDEX( $G$ INDEX),  and  corporate  control (CORP CONTROL) that we examined in Section 5. We also interact the change in supply and the change in on loan with these characteristics to better understand when equity lending activity is important to determine support for a proposal. Further, we include the firm-specific characteristics and proposal fixed effects included in the earlier estimations, but omit these for brevity in Table 8. All regressions include firm fixed effects, time dummies, and standard errors are double clustered at the firm and year levels.  \n\nIn column 1 of Table 8, we present evidence that shows the record date change in lendable supply is positively associated with more votes against the proposal. The coefficient of 4SUPPLY of 0.350 implies that a recall in lendable supply (i.e. a decrease in 4SUPPLY) is negatively associated with support for non-routine proposals, however significance is only at the $10\\%$ level. We find no relation between borrowing demand and a larger proportion of FOR votes for proposals. Further, shareholder sponsored proposals exhibit $44\\%$ less FOR votes, on average, than management sponsored proposals for the same firm. However, the significant coefficient of -2.444 on 4SUPPLY \\* DSHR shows that the record date recall in supply is positively associated with more votes being cast in favor of shareholder-sponsored proposals.  \n\nNext, in column 2, we introduce proposal characteristics and advice from proxy advisory services. Consistent with Alexander, Chen, Seppi, and Spatt (2010), we find that the recommendations of proxy advisors play an important role in the outcome of proposals. In general proposals that ISS recommends against management are associated with significantly lower support. Further, the significant coefficient of 1.545 on ASUPPLY \\* DISS implies that a higher recall (negative ASUPPLY) at the record date leads to fewer votes being cast in favor of a proposal if ISS opposes management. This is consistent with institutional investors responsibly fulfilling a monitoring role whereby they provide prudence on behalf of shareholders. Switching focus to proposal characteristics we find greater support for compensation, G-Index, and corporate control proposals. However, where the recall of lendable supply is higher the support for these proposals is lower: the coeficients estimated by interacting 4SUPPLY with these three proposal types are all positive and significant. In Section 5 we showed that institutional investors placed a higher value on voting rights for these types of proposals; here we show that when institutions do recall shares they tend to vote against the proposal. This finding is consistent with institutional investors providing monitoring of managerial activities via the proxy process. We also find evidence that higher borrowing is associated with less support for proposals that ISS recommends against but not much for compensation, G-Index, and corporate control.  \n\nThe results in columns 1 and 2 of Table 8 show indirect evidence that a recall in lendable supply is positively associated with votes for shareholder proposals, and against management proposals related to compensation, governance and corporate control. An alternative explanation is that institutions recall shares to vote with management when support for management is low. Because we do not know the identity of the institutions that recall shares, we try to rule out this alternative explanation by examining the voting behavior of mutual funds, who are one of the largest lenders of shares.  \n\nWe obtain data on mutual fund voting behavior reported on SEC Form N-PX. Form N-PX identifies all proposals on which the fund has voted portfolio securities and discloses how the fund voted on each proposal (the number of shares voted is not required to be disclosed). Our sample includes mutual fund voting data for 6,651 individual funds that are part of 308 institutions (mutual fund families) for the 3,826 record dates that include non-routine proposals. In total we have 1,524,290 fund-proposal voting behavior in our sample. In column 3 of Table 8, we examine how voting outcome is affected by recall in supply for mutual funds by estimating if the mutual fund voted FOR the proposal, where FOR is equal to 100 if the fund voted in favor of the proposal, and zero otherwise.21 We repeat the estimation of FOR presented in column 2 but at the mutual fund level and include fund family fixed effects in addition to firm fixed effects to control for fund family-level policies on both voting and lendable supply recall. The results show that mutual fund voting is associated with support for proposals where there is a greater recall in general. However, where ISS recommends against the proposal or the proposal is related to compensation or antitakeover a larger recall in supply is associated with less support from mutual funds. This result alleviates the concern that mutual funds are recalling shares to vote with management when other shareholders are following ISS's advice and voting against management.  \n\nCollectively, these results show that institutional investors that choose to retain voting rights have a meaningful impact on voting outcomes. While the fewer number of votes in favor of proposals may not result in the proposal being rejected, there is evidence that votes recorded against proposals have spillover governance effects. Cai, Garner, and Walkling (2009) and Fischer et al. (2009) show that meaningful vote totals against director election proposals, even where the proposal passes, are followed by changes in the board, management, or corporate actions within the next year.  \n\n## 8. Conclusion  \n\nThe preferences of institutional investors tend to be private and usually cannot be studied because they are often conducted behind the scenes. We use the unique setting of the equity lending market to observe the role of institutional investors in corporate governance. Lending fee is an important source of revenue for many institutional investors and enhances their performance. For example, in 2012, Vanguard reported that securities lending increased annual fund returns by more than 1 basis point for over $60\\%$ of its funds, by more than 5 basis points for nearly a third of funds, and by more than 10 basis points for over $15\\%$ of funds.\"2 However, if institutions have loaned out their shares on the record date, then they cannot exercise their vote. Hence, institutional investors must decide whether to restrict lending and even recall shares already on loan in the event of an upcoming vote. Just prior to the proxy record date, we find a significant reduction in lendable supply, because institutions restrict or call back their loaned shares in order to vote.  \n\nWe find heterogeneity in the recall to vote based on institutional investor composition, firm and proposal characteristics. These results show that recall is higher for firms with a higher proportion of investors with stronger incentives to monitor and exert governance, for stocks where governance is more valuable and for proposals where the returns to governance are likely higher. Finally, to understand how institutional voting shapes proxy outcomes, we examine the subsequent vote outcome and find higher recall to be associated with less support for management proposals such as those relating to compensation and corporate control, and more support for shareholder proposals. Thus our results are consistent with shareholder voting acting as an effective governance mechanism, but only when the economic stake is large enough or economic benefit great enough to overcome the free-rider problem that arises from the dispersed ownership.  \n\nOverall, our findings imply that institutional investors value their vote and use the proxy voting process as an important channel for affecting corporate governance. Our analysis suggests policy makers should address several issues related to proxy voting, including the need for investors to learn about proxy items before the record date so that they can decide whether to lend their shares or not.  \n\nReferences Aggarwal, R., I.

    "reference_markdown": "# The Agency Problems of Institutional Investors  \n\nLucian A. Bebchuk, Alma Cohen, and Scott Hirst  \n\nJinancial economics and corporate governance have long focused on the agency problems between corporate managers and shareholders that result from the dispersion of ownership in large publicly traded corporations. In this paper, we focus on how the rise of institutional investors over the past several decades has transformed the corporate landscape and, in turn, the governance problems of the modern corporation. The rise of institutional investors has led to increased concentration of equity ownership, with most public corporations now having a substantial proportion of their shares held by a small number of institutional investors. At the same time, these institutions are controlled by investment managers, which have their own agency problems vis-a-vis their own beneficial investors. These agency problems are the focus of our analysis.  \n\nWe develop an analytical framework for understanding the agency problems of institutional investors. We apply this framework to examine the agency problems and behavior of several key types of investment managers, including those that manage mutual funds—-both index funds and actively managed funds—and activist hedge funds.  \n\nWe identify several drivers of agency problems that afflict the decisions of investment managers of either passive index funds, active mutual funds, or both. First, such investment managers generally capture only a small fraction of the benefits that results from their stewardship activities while bearing the full cost of such activities. Further, competition with other investment managers is typically insufficient to eliminate these agency problems. Finally, investment managers may be further influenced by private incentives, such as their interest in obtaining business from corporations, that encourage them to side excessively with managers of corporations.  \n\nWe show that index funds have especially poor incentives to engage in stewardship activities that could improve governance and increase value. Accordingly, while the rise of index funds benefits investors and the economy by reducing the costs of financial intermediation, this trend also has systemwide adverse consequences on governance.  \n\nActivist hedge funds have substantially better incentives than managers of index funds or active mutual funds. While their activities may partially compensate, we show that they do not provide a complete solution for the agency problems of other institutional investors.  \n\nWe recognize that well-meaning investment managers of index funds and active mutual funds may sometimes make stewardship decisions that are superior to those suggested purely by their incentive calculus. Our focus, however, is on understanding the structural incentive problems that should be recognized in assessing the current governance landscape.  \n\nThere is a growing recognition by researchers, capital market participants, and public officials that investment fund managers are imperfect agents for those investing in their funds, and there is now significant literature on this problem. Our analytical framework contributes by identifying the direction and manner in which the behavior of investment fund managers can be expected to deviate from the interests of their beneficial investors. For example, by demonstrating that the agency problems of institutional investors can be expected to lead them to underinvest in stewardship and side excessively with corporate managers, we show that concerns about the existence of such agency problems provide little basis for weakening shareholder rights or impeding shareholder action.  \n\nFurthermore, our analysis also generates insights on a wide range of policy questions and provides a framework for future work. We conclude by offering implications in a number of areas: disclosure by institutional investors and regulation of their fees; stewardship codes; the rise of index investing; proxy advisors; hedge fund and wolf pack activism; the allocation of power between corporate managers and shareholders; and others.  \n\n# The Rise of Institutional Investors  \n\nIn their classic work on the separation of ownership and control, Berle and Means (1932) introduced the problem of publicly traded companies with widely dispersed ownership. In such situations, Berle and Means explained that, “[a]s his personal vote will count for little or nothing at the meeting ... the stockholder is practically reduced to the alternative of not voting at all or else of handing over his vote\" to the proxy committee, appointed by existing management, who can “virtually dictate their own successors\" (p. 87). Because dispersed shareholders can thus be expected to be rationally apathetic, managers will be relatively unconstrained in their actions, which Berle and Means refer to as “management control\" of the corporation.  \n\nFurthermore, Berle and Means (1932) documented that a significant proportion of publicly traded corporations have a sufficiently broad dispersion of shareholders to be classified as management-controlled. For example, Berle and Means (pp. 107-109, table XIl, panel G) show that, of the largest 200 corporations in 1930 that they listed as being controlled by hired managers (rather than run directly by owners), the aggregate percentage of the corporation's equity owned by the corporation's largest 20 shareholders had a mean of 10.55 percent (median of 10.6percent).  \n\nSome classic articles by financial economists, following Berle and Means (1932), assume that shareholders of publicly traded firms are “atomistic\" and have no incentive to seek governance improvements in the firms in which they own shares (for example, Grossman and Hart 1980; Shleifer and Vishny 1986). Given the practical infeasibility of such shareholder activities in the Berle-Means corporation, some researchers have focused on how other mechanisms, such as the discipline of the market for corporate control (Manne 1965), stock ownership by managers (Demsetz 1983), or price pressure due to sale of shares by investors seeking to exit underperforming companies (Admati and Pfleiderer 2o09) could constrain the agency problems of managers and thereby make up for the lack of direct shareholder effort to improve governance.  \n\nBerle and Means (1932, p. 47) argued that “[d]ispersion in the ownership of separate enterprises appears to be inherent in the corporate system. It has already proceeded far, it is rapidly increasing, and appears to be an inevitable development.\" However, the trend toward dispersion has been reversed in subsequent decades by the rise of institutional investors. The rise of institutional investors has been driven by investor recognition of the value of low-cost diversification and encouraged by favorable regulatory and tax treatment. Whereas institutional investors held 6.1 percent of outstanding corporate equity in 1950 (Tonello and Rabimov 2010), they held 63 percent of outstanding public corporate equity in 2016 (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 2016, p. 130). Furthermore, because institutional investors aggregate the assets of a vast number of individuals, each institutional investor can hold large positions in many publicly traded companies.  \n\nTable1 Institutional Ownership of the 20 Largest US Corporations   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td></td><td colspan=\"3\">Percentage ownedby largest holders</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Corporation</td><td>Largest 5</td><td>Largest 20</td><td>Largest 50</td></tr><tr><td>1.</td><td>Apple Inc.</td><td>17.5%</td><td>26.8%</td><td>35.4%</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>Microsoft Corp.</td><td>20.5%</td><td>33.1%</td><td>43.2%</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>Exxon Mobil Corp.</td><td>17.8%</td><td>27.1%</td><td>35.2%</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>Johnson& Johnson</td><td>19.0%</td><td>30.3%</td><td>40.5%</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>General Electric Co.</td><td>17.5%</td><td>28.0%</td><td>37.3%</td></tr><tr><td>6.</td><td>AT&T Inc.</td><td>19.0%</td><td>28.8%</td><td>37.4%</td></tr><tr><td>7.</td><td>Wells Fargo & Co.</td><td>24.9%</td><td>40.2%</td><td>51.0%</td></tr><tr><td>8.</td><td>Verizon Communications Inc.</td><td>20.1%</td><td>32.9%</td><td>43.7%</td></tr><tr><td>9.</td><td>Procter & Gamble Co.</td><td>18.4%</td><td>28.3%</td><td>38.2%</td></tr><tr><td>10.</td><td>JPMorgan Chase & Co.</td><td>19.5%</td><td>34.7%</td><td>47.1%</td></tr><tr><td>11.</td><td>Pfizer Inc.</td><td>18.7%</td><td>32.1%</td><td>45.1%</td></tr><tr><td>12.</td><td>Chevron Corp.</td><td>21.6%</td><td>33.9%</td><td>43.6%</td></tr><tr><td>13.</td><td>Coca-Cola Co.</td><td>26.6%</td><td>39.9%</td><td>48.6%</td></tr><tr><td>14.</td><td>Visa Inc.</td><td>23.8%</td><td>41.7%</td><td>56.3%</td></tr><tr><td>15.</td><td>Home Depot Inc.</td><td>24.4%</td><td>37.4%</td><td>49.1%</td></tr><tr><td>16.</td><td>Disney (Walt) Co.</td><td>17.9%</td><td>29.6%</td><td>39.1%</td></tr><tr><td>17.</td><td>Merck & Co.</td><td>26.1%</td><td>38.4%</td><td>50.1%</td></tr><tr><td>18.</td><td>Philip Morris International</td><td>24.8%</td><td>40.9%</td><td>52.1%</td></tr><tr><td>19.</td><td>Intel Corp.</td><td>20.2%</td><td>32.9%</td><td>44.6%</td></tr><tr><td>20.</td><td>Cisco Systems Inc.</td><td>18.8%</td><td>32.2%</td><td>45.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Mean</td><td></td><td>20.8%</td><td>33.4%</td><td>44.2%</td></tr><tr><td>Median</td><td></td><td>19.8%</td><td>32.9%</td><td>44.2%</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nSource: FactSet Ownership database (by FactSet Research Systems). Note: The table shows the aggregate ownership of the largest holders of the largest 20 US corporations by market capitalization as of June 30, 2016, excluding controlled corporations.  \n\nAs a result of the rise of institutional investors, the scenario of dispersed ownership described by Berle and Means (1932) no longer approximates reality, not even for the largest publicly traded corporations. Table 1 lists the largest 20 US corporations by market capitalization as of June 30, 2016 (excluding controlled corporations), and the aggregate percentage of the stock of each corporation owned by their largest 5, 20, and 50 institutional investors.  \n\nAs Table 1 shows, current share ownership is significantly more concentrated than the level described by Berle and Means (1932). Indeed, because the figures in Table 1 exclude large holdings by noninstitutional investors, they likely underestimate the degree to which shares are concentrated among investors with significant holdings. Even among the largest 20 corporations, the largest 20 institutional investors in 2016 had mean ownership of 33.4 percent (and similar median ownership of 32.9 percent), more than three times the figure reported by Berle and Means (1932); in each of the 20 corporations, the largest 20 institutional investors own more than 25 percent. Furthermore, among these very large public corporations, the percentage owned by the largest 50 institutional investors has a mean of 44.2 percent (the median is also 44.2 percent). The increase in concentration is perhaps most vivid when looking at the aggregate percentage owned by the largest five shareholders, which has a mean of 20.8 percent (median of 19.8 percent) and is above 17 percent in each of the 20 largest US corporations.  \n\nData from Iss Voting Analytics shows that the mean percentage of shares outstanding voted at the 2015 annual meetings of these corporations for the election of directors was 68.7 percent (median of 70.8 percent). The largest 50 institutional investors thus cast a substantial majority of the votes at these annual meetings.  \n\nThus, large institutional shareholders hold sufficiently sizable positions in each large corporation to have a non-negligible effect on the outcomes of shareholder votes. Moreover, these shareholders recognize that many of their fellow shareholders are similarly non-atomistic. Of course, because the benefits of each shareholder's actions will be shared with fellow shareholders, it will still be privately optimal for each shareholder to underspend on stewardship. However, given the current concentrated ownership of publicly traded corporations, if each shareholder were solely investing its own money, it would no longer be rational for all shareholders to be rationally apathetic. On the contrary, given that some stewardship involves limited costs and can generate significant increases in value, it is likely to be privately optimal for some shareholders with significant holdings to undertake such activities.  \n\nAs a result of these changes, the prospects for stewardship by shareholders are substantially better today than in Berle-Means corporations. Institutional investors participate in corporate voting, and there is empirical evidence that the presence of institutional investors influences how corporations are governed (for example, Hartzell and Starks 2003; Aghion, Van Reenen, and Zingales 2013). Institutional investors therefore provide constraints on agency problems in their portfolio companies that dispersed shareholders in Berle-Means corporations were unable to accomplish.  \n\nHowever, investment managers invest other people's money. Thus, the question arises whether their stewardship decisions would be the same as those that they would make if they were solely investing their own money. Below we analyze the agency problems that could lead these investment managers to deviate from the stewardship decisions that would be optimal for their beneficial investors. These agency problems limit the extent to which our corporate governance system is able to benefit from the increased concentration of shareholdings, and are a key impediment to improving the governance of publicly traded corporations.  \n\n## Stewardship by Investment Managers  \n\n## Investment Funds, Active and Passive  \n\nBy investment funds we refer to funds that pool together the assets of many individuals and entities and invest them in a diversified portfolio of securities. The category of investment funds includes open-end mutual funds, closed-end mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other similar funds. Most of these investment funds are technically “investment companies,” as defined and regulated by the Investment Company Act of 1940. Given our emphasis on corporate governance, we naturally focus on funds that invest in equity securities. Investment funds are the most important category of institutional investors and represent most of the assets held by institutional investors.  \n\nInvestment funds generally enter into contracts with organizations, referred to in Us securities regulations as “investment advisers,” to manage the porfolios of investment funds. We will refer to these organizations as “investment managers.\"  \n\nInvestment funds focusing on equity securities can be categorized by their investing strategy into those that actively manage their portfolio and those that passively invest by matching their portfolio weightings of corporations to those of an underlying equity index. We refer to the latter, which include both open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, as index funds. Most mutual fund managers operate a number of mutual funds, often referred to collectively as a “mutual fund family.\" While most mutual fund families include both actively managed funds and index funds, mutual fund families predominantly operate one or the other kind of investment fund.  \n\nThe index fund market is dominated by three investment managers: BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street Global Advisors (sometimes referred to as the \"Big Three\"). These investment managers have assets under management of $\\$3.1$ trillion, $\\$2.5$ trillion, and $\\$1.9$ trillion, respectively (Diamond 2016). The largest investment managers of actively managed funds include Fidelity Investments and the Capital Group, both of which have more than $\\$1$ trillion in assets under management.  \n\nWe pay particular attention to index funds because their share of the market for managed investments has increased significantly in recent years, a trend that is expected to continue. The move towards index funds is driven by the growing recognition of their low costs and tax advantages, and the evidence that they outperform most actively managed equity mutual funds (French 2008). Passively managed funds increased from 1 percent of total fund assets in 1984 to 12.6 percent in 2006 (French 2008), and the move from active to passive funds has continued since then. From 2013 to 2016, investors added $\\$1.3$ trillion to passive mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (Tergesen and Zweig 2016).  \n\nThe rise of index investing has benefits in reducing the costs of intermediation borne by investors; as of the end of 2015, the asset-weighted average net expense ratio was only 0.12 percent for US equity index funds, compared to 0.79 percent for actively managed US equity funds (Oey and West 2016, p. 6). We recognize this benefit to investors, but wish to stress a systemic cost of index funds. As we discuss below, while agency problems afflict the stewardship activities of all investment funds, they are likely to be especially acute for indexfunds.  \n\n## Stewardship  \n\nOur focus is on those decisions of investment managers that relate to the stewardship of companies in their portfolio. Stewardship by investment managers can take several forms. Most investment funds are required to vote at shareholder meetings on director elections and management and shareholder proposals, and to have an internal process for making voting decisions. Thus, not voting, or voting in a patently uninformed manner, is not an option for investment managers. Stewardship therefore requires monitoring of corporate managers and other information gathering in order to inform voting, engagement, and other stewardship activities. Investment managers can nominate candidates for election as directors or put forward shareholder proposals, and they can communicate with the corporation, or with other shareholders, about such matters. While stewardship may also relate to environmental and social matters that affect investors (for example, Hirst 2016), our focus in this paper is on stewardship decisions that affect beneficial investors only through their effect on the financial value of the managed portfolio.  \n\nStewardship decisions can be split into two parts: 1) spending decisions regarding how much to expend on stewardship; and 2) qualitative decisions regarding which way to vote or which positions to take in communications with corporate managers and other shareholders.  \n\nLike all organizations with multiple employees, investment managers have their own internal agency problems. Our analysis can be thought of as analyzing the incentives that would shape the stewardship strategies that the leaders of investment managers would pursue, for example, choices regarding the resources to provide for corporate governance and proxy voting units and setting the general policy and approach of such units.  \n\nBecause the voting and stewardship decisions of mutual fund families are commonly concentrated in a single corporate governance department or proxy voting department of the investment manager, the stewardship incentives of investment managers with different types of funds are a composite of the different incentives we identify below for the different types of investment funds.  \n\n### Sources of Agency Problems  \n\n### The Benchmark Scenario: Decisions that Maximize Portfolio Value  \n\nLet us consider a hypothetical scenario with no agency problems in managing such investments. For instance, imagine that each of the positions were those of sole owners that owned and managed 1o0 percent of each investment. In this case, the decisions made would be ones that maximize the value of the owners’ wealth. More specifically, suppose that some stewardship activity will cost $C$ and will increase the value of the position by $\\Delta V.$ Then, in the benchmark, no-agency scenario, the stewardship activity will be undertaken if $C<\\Delta V.$  \n\nFor large equity positions, like those that investment managers hold in many companies, the no-agency-costs scenario would often justify meaningful investments in stewardship activities. If an investor had a $\\$1$ billion investment in a given portfolio company, and investment in certain stewardship activities would increase the value of the company by 0.1 percent, then the investor would have an incentive to spend up to $\\$1$ million on stewardship to bring about this change. We note that each large mutual fund family holds positions exceeding $\\$1$ billion in value in a large number of public companies; data from the FactSet Ownership database shows that, as of December 31, 2016, BlackRock, Capital Research, Fidelity, State Street Global Advisors, and Vanguard each held such positions at a substantial proportion of corporations in the S&P 500 index.  \n\nIn many cases, stewardship decisions may be merely qualitative, and not involve additional cost. This is commonly the case when investment managers decide how to cast a vote or what position to take in interactions with corporate managers or fellow shareholders. Suppose that voting or otherwise taking a position against the outcome management prefers would change the value of the position by $\\Delta V,$ where $\\Delta V$ can be positive or negative. In such a case, in the no-agency-cost benchmark scenario, the investor should make a choice against managers′ preferences whenever $\\Delta V$ is positive.  \n\n### Capturing Only a Small Fraction of the Benefit  \n\nWe now turn to the decisions that the investment manager would find privately optimal. Although we will later relax these assumptions, we will initially take as given the size of fees charged by investment managers and the size of the portfolio managed.  \n\nOne key source of agency problems is that investment managers bear the costs of stewardship activities, but capture only a small fraction of the benefits they create. Under existing regulations governing mutual funds, investment managers cannot charge their personnel and other management expenses directly to the portfolio. For example, if an investment manager were to employ staff fully dedicated to stewardship of a single corporation, or if an investment manager were to conduct a proxy fight in opposition to incumbent managers, it would have to cover those expenses itself, out of the fee income it receives from investors.  \n\nAt the same time, the benefits from stewardship flow to the portfolio. Mutual fund managers and investment managers of other similarly structured funds are not permitted to collect incentive fees on increases in the value of their portfolio but may only charge fees that are calculated as a percentage of assets under management. Let $\\alpha$ be the fraction of assets under management that an investment manager charges as fees. Therefore, $\\alpha$ is also fraction of the increase in the value of a portfolio company that an investment fund will be able to capture, in present value terms, from additional fees. The value of $\\alpha$ is likely to be small given that the asset-weighted average net expense ratio for US equity index funds was 0.12 percent as of December 31, 2015 (Oey and West 2016). It would not be in the interests of the investment manager to spend an amount $C$ that would produce a gain of $\\Delta V$ to the portfolio if $C$ is larger than $\\alpha\\times\\Delta V.$ Thus, in this setting, agency problems would lead to underspending on stewardship, precluding efficient expenditure, whenever:  \n\n$$\n\\alpha\\times\\Delta V<C<\\Delta V\n$$  \n\nTo illustrate this wedge, reconsider the example above of an investment manager of an index fund that holds a $\\$1$ billion investment in a portfolio company whose value could increase by $\\$1$ million as a result of certain stewardship activities. If the investment manager could expect additional fees with a present value of 0.12 percent from the changes in the value of the position, it would be willing to take such actions only if their cost was below $\\$1,200$ , compared to $\\$1$ million in the no-agency-costs scenario.  \n\nAlthough investment managers of actively managed funds charge higher fees, because those fees are still a very small fraction of the investment, they will have only slightly higher incentives to spend on stewardship. If such an investment manager received additional fees of 0.79 percent of the change in the value of the position—- the asset-weighted average net expense ratio for actively-managed US equity mutual funds as of December 31, 2015 (Oey and West 2016)—then it would be willing to take such actions only if their cost was below $\\$7,900$ . Thus, managers of active mutual funds still have strong incentives to spend much less on stewardship than would be value-maximizing for their portfolio.  \n\n### The Limits of Competition: Index Funds  \n\nThus far, our analysis has assumed that investment managers take their fees and assets under management as given when making stewardship decisions. By relaxing this assumption, we now consider whether the desire to improve performance and attract additional funds might counter the distortions identified above and lead investment managers to make additional investments in stewardship that would be portfolio-value-maximizing.  \n\nIn examining this question, it is important to recognize that what matters for attracting assets under management (and thereby increasing future fee revenue) is not the absolute performance of the investment manager, but its performance relative to alternative investment opportunities. Potential investors in equity mutual funds can be expected to judge the investment manager's performance relative to an equity index, or relative to other comparable equity mutual funds. As a result, in many cases, the consideration of improving relative performance would not provide any incentives to improve stewardship decisions.  \n\nIn particular, this is the situation in the important case of the investment managers of passively managed index mutual funds. If the investment manager of a certain mutual fund that invests according to a given index increases its spending on stewardship at a particular portfolio company and thereby increases the value of its investment in that company, it will also increase the value of the index, so its expenditure would not lead to any increase in the performance of the mutual fund relative to the index. Nor would it lead to any increase relative to the investment manager's rivals that follow the same index, as any increase in the value of the corporation would also be captured by all other mutual funds investing according to the index, even though they had not made any additional expenditure on stewardship.  \n\nThus, if the investment manager were to take actions that increase the value of the portfolio company, and therefore also the portfolio that tracks the index, doing so would not result in a superior performance that could enable the manager to attract funds currently invested with rival investment managers. Such decisions would also not enable the investment manager to increase fees relative to rivals tracking the same index, as such rivals would offer the same gross return without the increased fees. Accordingly, for managers of index funds, a desire to improve relative performance would not provide any incentives that could counter tendencies that the investment manager might otherwise have to underspend on stewardship and to side with corporate managers more often than is optimal for the investment managers' beneficial investors.  \n\nIt could be argued that the inability of index funds to attract additional investors by increasing stewardship spending implies that the existing equilibrium is optimal. However, our analysis indicates that this equilibrium is due to a collective action problem. The beneficial investors of an index fund would be better served by having the fund increase stewardship spending up to the level that would maximize the portfolio value, even if the fund increased its fees to fund this spending. However, if the index fund were to raise its fees and improve its stewardship, each individual investor in the fund would have an incentive to switch to rival index funds. That is, a move by any given index fund manager to improve stewardship and raise fees would unravel, because its investors would prefer to free-ride on the investment manager's efforts by switching to another investment fund that offers the same indexed portfolio but without stewardship or higher fees.  \n\n### The Limits of Competition: Actively Managed Funds  \n\nTurning to actively managed funds, it is important to recognize that there is evidence that many of these funds are, to varying extents, “closet indexers\" whose holdings substantially overlap with their benchmark index, deviating only by underweighting and overweighting certain stocks (Cremers and Petajisto 2009). For an actively managed fund that is to some extent a closet indexer, a desire to improve relative performance would provide no incentives to move stewardship decisions toward optimality for any of the portfolio companies where the company's weighting in the investment fund's portfolio is approximately equal to its weighting in the index; improving the value of those portfolio companies would not enhance performance relative to the index.  \n\nFurthermore, for all the corporations that are underweight in the portfolio relative to the index, enhancing the value of the corporation would actually worsen the investment manager's performance relative to the index. For corporations that are underweight in the portfolio, the consideration of increasing relative performance does not provide any incentive to enhance the value of these corporations; on the contrary, this consideration weighs against trying to do so.  \n\nThus, the desire to improve relative performance could only provide an actively managed fund with incentives to improve value in those corporations that are overweight in the portfolio compared to the index. Even for such corporations, the extent to which improving the value of the corporation would improve fund performance will depend on the extent to which the corporation is overweight in theportfolio.  \n\nConsider a portfolio company that constitutes 1 percent of the benchmark index and 1.2 percent of the investment fund. In this case, any increase in the value of the portfolio company will be substantially shared by rival funds that track the index at least partly. Indeed, the increase in value of the portfolio company will worsen the performance of the investment fund relative to rival funds that are more overweight with respect to the portfolio company. Thus, even for companies that are overweight within the portfolio of the investment fund relative to the index, the impact of the desire to improve relative performance would be diluted by the presence of the company in the benchmark index and in the portfolios of rival funds.  \n\nFurthermore, as discussed above, in most cases actively managed funds are part of mutual fund families composed of a number of mutual funds, and stewardship decisions are commonly made for all these investment funds by the fund family's governance or proxy voting group. In such a case, the fact that a given actively managed fund is overweight in a particular corporation might be offset by the fact that other actively managed funds within the same fund family might be underweight. The investment manager of the fund family will have an incentive to bring about an increase in value only if its actively managed funds are on the whole overweight in this corporation, and the incentive will be diluted to the extent that any gains will be shared by other mutual fund families.  \n\nIn addition, an interest in improving their relative performance might also push investment managers in the opposite direction, and thereby exacerbate rather than alleviate distortions in stewardship decisions. Ke, Petroni, and Yu (2008, p. 855) describe evidence that some institutional investors value “direct access to companies′ management,” presumably because they believe that, notwithstanding the limitations imposed by Regulation Fair Disclosure, being able to communicate with managers will improve their trading decisions. For investment managers following active strategies, trading decisions that change the weight of a portfolio company relative to its weighting in the index are likely to be the main determinants of their performance relative to their benchmark index. To the extent that active investment managers believe that making stewardship decisions that corporate managers disfavor might adversely affect their access to such managers, an interest in improving relative performance could provide incentives to avoid such decisions.  \n\nNote that, to the extent that investment managers get access to corporate managers and consequently make better trading decisions, the gains from such trading decisions will improve the investment manager's performance relative to others, since rivals will not share these trading gains. By comparison, gains from governance-generated improvements in the value of particular portfolio companies will be substantially shared with rivals. Thus, an interest in improving relative performance could well lead active fund managers to place more weight on gains to their portfolios from access to corporate managers relative to gains from governance-generated increases in value, compared to what would be optimal for the investment funds' beneficial investors.?  \n\nFinally, without discussing the issue in detail, we want to flag a disagreement in the literature regarding the extent to which fund inflows and outflows are sensitive to changes in relative performance (for example, Sirri and Tufano 1998 and Coates and Hubbard 2oo7). To the extent that the sensitivity of inflows and outflows to performance is limited, competition with other investment funds will give investment managers limited incentives to improve the value of portfolio companies.  \n\n### The Governance Passivity of Investment Funds  \n\nThe above analysis suggests that investment managers, those managing both passive index funds and active mutual funds, have incentives to be “more passive\" with respect to governance issues than is optimal for their beneficial investors.  \n\nWith respect to index funds, our analysis is consistent with the practically negligible resources that index funds spend on stewardship beyond what is required to comply with regulations requiring investment managers to vote shares in portfolio companies and to avoid doing so in an uninformed fashion. Vanguard employs about 15 staff for voting and stewardship at its 13,000 portfolio companies; BlackRock employs 24 staff for voting and stewardship at 14,000 portfolio companies; and State Street Global Advisors employs fewer than 10 staff for voting and stewardship at 9,000 portfolio companies (Krouse, Benoit, and McGinty 2016).  \n\nOf course, these staff may receive information from proxy advisors as well as from active portfolio managers employed by the investment manager. However, each of these major investment managers devotes less than one person-workday per year, on average, to assessing this and other information, and undertaking other stewardship activities with respect to each of their portfolio companies. Note that each of these investment managers is likely to hold several percent of each company's stock and to be among their largest shareholders. Given the size and value of the positions that each of these investment managers holds in large public companies, there are grounds for concern that these managers substantially underinvest in stewardship.  \n\nWith respect to active mutual funds, our analysis is similarly consistent with the very limited resources that predominantly actively managed mutual fund families currently spend on stewardship. Even the largest such mutual fund families employ only a small number of staff to make voting decisions and undertake all other governance-related stewardship activities in the vast number of corporations in which they hold stock.  \n\nIn a companion paper, we document that this underinvestment by investment managers is reflected not only in the limited time that their staff spend on voting and stewardship activities, but also in the absence of these investment managers from the ranks of investors that use certain significant tools to generate value increases from improved governance that benefit the investment funds (Bebchuk, Cohen, and Hirst 2017). For example, large investment managers generally avoid submitting shareholder proposals, nominating directors to the boards of corporations, or conducting proxy contests. Their absence might be due not only to incentives to underspend on stewardship, but also to private costs that investment managers viewed as oppositional to managers might have to bear, which we discuss below.  \n\nOur companion paper also addresses the argument that substantial passivity on the part of investment managers is optimal, and that the underspending problem is therefore of limited economic importance. Such an argument could be justified if other mechanisms-such as the discipline of the market for corporate control, executive incentives schemes, or monitoring and engagement by other investors-could be relied on to eliminate agency problems in public companies. We argue, however, that the limits of such mechanisms make it plausible to assume that improved stewardship by the investment managers that hold a large proportion of the shares of most publicly traded companies can significantly improve outcomes for their own investors.  \n\nThere is a growing recognition of the power of large investment managers, and concomitantly increasing expectation that they will use this power to improve the governance of their portfolio companies. The leaders of the largest index fund managers have responded by making public announcements stressing their commitment to stewardship, and to improving corporate governance (for example, Fink 2015; McNabb 2015). These executives may indeed believe in the desirability of governance improvements and sincerely wish to help bring them about. However, our economic analysis indicates that investment managers may well have very limited economic incentives to spend on stewardship, and may have economic incentives to be more lax toward corporate managers, compared with what would be optimal for their beneficial investors.  \n\n### Private Costs from Opposing Managers  \n\nAnother significant source of agency problems introduced by the separation between investment managers and beneficial owners is that investment managers may bear private costs from taking positions that corporate managers disfavor. When such private costs may result, investment managers may be more reluctant to spend on actions or make qualitative decisions that are disfavored by corporate managers. Suppose that such an action would result in a change in the value of the portfolio Oof $\\Delta V$ but a private indirect cost of $I C$ to the investment manager. The investment manager will take the disfavored action only if $C+I C$ islessthan $\\alpha\\times\\Delta V.$  \n\nFor qualitative choices that would not involve any additional marginal cost but would have an expected positive effect on the value of the portfolio (that is, $\\Delta V>0$ the investment manager would prefer to side with managers if $I C>\\alpha\\times\\Delta V.$ Thus, the investment manager would prefer to avoid taking a position disfavored by managers that would be optimal for the managed portfolio if and only if:  \n\n$$\n0<\\Delta V<\\frac{I C}{\\alpha}.\n$$  \n\nWhat is important is not whether avoiding such actions actually helps investment managers obtain business, but whether investment managers believe that to be the case, on an expected value basis. The smaller is $\\alpha$ , the wider the range of increases in value that the investment manager would forgo not to bear expected indirect costs of taking actions that corporate managers disfavor. That investment funds charge fees below 1 percent (on average) strengthens the distortion resulting from potential indirect costs.  \n\nOne important source of costs from taking positions that corporate managers disfavor (or benefits from taking positions that managers favor) comes from the incentives of investment managers to obtain or retain business from public corporations. In 2015, 401(k) assets under management totaled $\\$4.7$ trillion, with 60 percent held in mutual funds (Collins, Holden, Duvall, and Chism 2016, p. 2); most of these assets are likely to come from public corporations. Cvijanovic, Dasgupta, and Zachariadis (2016) document that an average of 14 percent of fund family revenue is derived from 401(k)-related business. The largest index fund managers and active managers all derive business from 401(k) services, and therefore have strong incentives to attract and retain such business from public corporations.  \n\nIn addition, many investment managers provide investment services to corporations, both to manage cash and short-term investments and also to manage the long-term investments of financial corporations such as insurance companies. Investment managers may also provide investment management services to pension funds that are sponsored by public corporations, and over which the corporation may have some influence. US private sector pension funds had aggregate assets under management of $\\$2.9$ trillion in 2015 (Investment Company Institute 2016). Several empirical studies provide evidence suggesting that business ties with corporations influence the voting decisions of investment managers. Davis and Kim (2007) find that the volume of pension fund business of investment managers was associated with those investment managers voting more often with corporate managers on several key types of shareholder proposals. Ashraf, Jayaraman, and Ryan (2012) find that mutual fund families that have greater business ties to corporations tend to vote more favorably toward corporate managers on executive compensation matters at all corporations.  \n\nThese studies focus on the association between corporate business ties in general and voting in corporations in general. Cvijanovic, Dasgupta, and Zachariadis (2016) examine contested shareholder proposals where corporate managers care more about votes for their favored position, and find that mutual fund families with business ties to a corporation are more likely to cast pro-management votes in closely contested situations at the corporation. Although this study provides evidence that an investment manager's business ties with particular corporations provide incentives to vote with corporate managers in close votes, there are clear limits to the ability of investment managers to treat managers of client corporations more favorably than their general voting policy would provide. Therefore, in our view, the more important concern is that investment managers will have an incentive to lean in a pro-management direction when determining their strategies and policies regarding stewardship.  \n\nGiven the limited economic incentive that investment managers have to generate governance gains in portfolio companies, and their strong economic interest in attracting more business, choosing a pro-management approach within the range of the legitimate choices available to them may seem the safest approach to investment managers. Investment managers would have an incentive to take such an approach as long as they believe that doing so might help them get additional business from public corporations on an expected value basis.  \n\nFinally, we note certain additional private costs that are relevant only to the largest investment managers and may contribute to discouraging these major players from opposing corporate managers. Some mutual fund families hold close to or above 5 percent of the stock in many public corporations. Indeed, the three index fund managers that dominate the index fund sector—Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street Global Advisors--hold such positions in most large publicly traded corporations; Fidelity Investments and the Capital Group also hold such positions in many public corporations, and Dimensional Fund Advisors holds such positions in many smaller public corporations. Investment managers holding such positions would bear additional private costs in the event that they attempt to wield significant influence—and therefore have a significant incentive to avoid doingso.  \n\nUnder Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act of 1934, investors that own or control, in the aggregate, 5 percent or more of a corporation's shares and that seek to influence the control of the corporation are subject to extensive and repeated disclosure requirements on Schedule 13D. Nominating directors, undertaking a proxy contest for board representation, and other significant engagement action would classify investment managers as seeking to influence control. By contrast, investment managers that are not classified as seeking to influence control are subject only to the relatively limited disclosure requirements on Schedule 13G. Becoming subject to the substantial and repeated disclosure on Schedule 13D would be very costly for the investment managers of major fund families, which typically manage multiple funds. Because the investment manager would have to bear these costs itself rather than charge them to the investment funds, the prospect of having to bear such costs provides additional incentives to avoid taking any actions that might be classified as seeking to influence the control of thecorporation.  \n\n## Activist Hedge Funds  \n\nFinally, we would like to discuss a different type of an investment manager, the activist hedge fund manager. Applying the framework described above shows why activist hedge fund managers suffer less from the agency problems that affect investment managers with diversified equity portfolios, and why activist hedge fund managers have incentives to make stewardship decisions that are significantly closer to those that would be optimal for their beneficial investors.  \n\n### Why Activist Hedge Funds are Different  \n\nHedge funds managers limit their investment offerings to investors considered to be sophisticated, and are therefore not subject to the regulations governing investment managers of mutual funds. Hedge funds therefore have considerably more freedom in the assets they own, their use of leverage, and their compensation structures. Our focus below is on the subset of hedge funds that take concentrated positions in the equity of public corporations and actively engage with corporate managers—activist hedge funds. For the reasons explained below, these hedge funds have significant influence on the corporate governance landscape.  \n\nHigh-Powered Incentives to Increase Value. Hedge fund managers, including activist hedge fund managers, typically receive compensation based on two components, often referred to as “2 and $20^{\\mathrm{,}}$ (French 2008): a management fee that is a relatively small percentage of the value of the assets, historically 2 percent, and an incentive payment, structured as a “carried interest\" of a proportion (historically 20 percent) of any increase in value of the portfolio.  \n\nLeaving aside the management fee, which is higher than the average for an actively managed mutual fund but a similar order of magnitude, a hedge fund manager that is able to increase the value of a position in a portfolio company through investments in stewardship will capture 20 percent of this increase, an order of magnitude more than the percentage of any value increase that a mutual fund manager would be able to capture. Thus, activist hedge fund managers will have much stronger incentives to bring about governance-generated increases in value than investment managers of mutual funds, even when the latter hold positions with equal or greater dollar value.  \n\nLimited Business from Portfolio Companies. In contrast to mutual funds, which are registered investment companies and publicly issue securities, hedge funds are not registered investment companies and do not accept investments from 401 (k) plans. Accordingly, activist hedge fund managers do not have a desire to attract  \n\n401 (k) business that might discourage them from taking positions that corporate managers disfavor. In addition, activist hedge funds do not offer other services to corporations of the kind that many investment managers offer.  \n\nConcentrated Positions and Stronger Incentives Regarding Relative Performance. Activist hedge funds have concentrated positions, sometimes holding significant positions in as few as 10 portfolio companies. As a result, an improvement in the value of a single portfolio company that is a target of stewardship activities can substantially improve the fund manager's performance relative to peer investment vehicles. This will, in turn, affect the manager's ability to attract additional investments. For example, the investment of Pershing Square Capital Management LP in Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. and General Growth Properties Inc. each constituted as much as one-fifth of the fund's portfolio during certain periods, and the increase in the value of these positions enabled the fund to post strong performance.  \n\nBecause of their small size and method of selection, activist hedge fund portfolios display very little correlation with those of competing funds, or with other investment opportunities available to their investors. Any changes in the value of their portfolio companies are therefore also clearly reflected in their relative performance against such comparable investments. This factor therefore strengthens the incentive of activist hedge fund managers to bring about governance-related improvements in the value of their portfolio companies. Thus, the desire to improve relative performance provides more powerful incentives for activist hedge funds to seek governance-related value improvements than it does for managers of index funds and active mutual funds.  \n\nClearly, the main factors that create a wedge between the interests of investment managers and the beneficial investors whose investments they manage affects activist hedge fund managers significantly less than investment managers of mutual funds. Consistent with this, activist hedge fund managers are much more willing to devote significant resources to stewardship. Activist hedge fund managers are often willing to devote hundreds of person-hours per year to monitoring and engaging with each of their portfolio companies. For instance, Pershing Square Capital Management has an investment team of eight, plus several other employees, that oversee a portfolio of about 12 corporations (as reported in Krouse, Benoit, and McGinty 2016). Activist hedge fund managers are also willing to have representatives on the board of directors of portfolio companies, and often seek such representation. Such representation not only requires significant personnel time, but also imposes constraints on the activist hedge fund manager's trading in the portfolio company's stock.  \n\nFurthermore, activist hedge fund managers frequently commence proxy contests at portfolio companies (Brav, Jiang, Partnoy, and Thomas 2008), despite the considerable expenses associated with such contests (estimated by Gantchev 2013 to average about $\\$10$ million) and corporate managers’ views of such contests as adversarial. By contrast, managers of mutual funds have generally avoided conducting proxy contests at their portfolio companies, even where the mutual fund held a significant stake. Even in situations where activist hedge fund managers do not conduct proxy contests, they frequently take public positions that the managers of their portfolio companies disfavor, which other investment managers generally avoid.  \n\nClearly activist hedge fund managers have different incentive structures that enable them to play an important role in the current governance landscape. This role is especially important in light of the significant agency problems that afflict the stewardship decisions of mutual fund managers. But while activist hedge fund managers play a beneficial role in the corporate governance system, there are significant limits to this beneficial role.  \n\n### The Limits of Hedge Funds  \n\nActivist hedge fund managers have incentives to spend on stewardship only when the governance-generated value increases likely to result are especially large. The incentives of activist hedge fund managers are driven by the significant performance-related fees that they earn, and by their concentrated portfolios. As a result, activist hedge fund managers can pursue only those corporations where the potential governance-related increases in value are sufficiently large that the funds' investors can expect to make reasonable risk-adjusted returns after bearing the high fees charged by the hedge fund managers and the firm-specific risks from the funds’ concentrated portfolios. For example, where an activist hedge fund could buy a stake in a given corporation and bring about a 3 percent increase in value over a two-year period, the hedge fund manager would be unlikely to pursue this opportunity.  \n\nThis analysis is consistent with the fact that such funds usually focus on situations where governance failures have led to substantial operating underperformance. As a result, disclosures regarding the initiation of engagements by activist hedge fund managers are accompanied by abnormal returns that, on average, exceed 5 percent, reflecting market expectations of a significant expected increase in value (for example, Brav et al. 2008; Bebchuk, Brav, and Jiang 2015).  \n\nFurthermore, for an activist hedge fund manager to bring about a governancegenerated increase in value, it is not only necessary that there be potential for such a large increase, but also that other institutional investors are willing to support the changes sought by the activist hedge fund manager. Activist hedge fund managers are unable to bring about changes unless they obtain the support of other types of institutional investors, or have a reasonable likelihood of doing so (Bebchuk and Jackson 2012). When an activist hedge fund manager enjoys such support for the changes it seeks, it will be able to win a proxy fight, or obtain a settlement by credibly threatening to do so, and thereby cause the corporation to make such changes. Conversely, when corporate managers expect that most institutional investors will side with them and not with activist hedge fund managers, activist hedge fund managers will not have much influence.  \n\nMutual fund managers do sometimes vote on the side of activist hedge fund managers. Indeed, the expectation that this would be the case, and that activist hedge funds could therefore prevail in potential proxy fights, often leads corporate managers to accept activist hedge funds’ demands for board representation (Bebchuk, Brav, Jiang, and Keusch 2017). However, our analytical framework raises the concern that, on the margin, mutual fund managers might not be sufficiently willing to support activist hedge fund managers in their engagements with portfolio companies where such support would be optimal for the mutual funds' investors. Whether and to what extent this is the case is an interesting issue for futureresearch.  \n\nFinally, we should briefly note the issue of short-termism and long-termism. Activist hedge fund managers have stronger incentives to bring about increases in value than other institutional investors. However, some scholars have argued that activist hedge fund managers focus on increases in short-term value and that the increases they seek often come at the expense of long-term value (for example, Strine 2014; Coffee and Palia 2015). One of us has addressed this claim in detail elsewhere on both conceptual and empirical grounds (Bebchuk 2013; Bebchuk, Brav, and Jiang 2015). Leaving aside the alleged distinction between short-term and long-term increases in value, a key point of our analysis is that activist hedge fund managers stand out relative to other institutional investors in terms of their incentives to seek increased value.  \n\nOf course, index funds are long-term players, and can therefore be expected to favor only changes that would enhance value in the long term (for examples of this view, see Lipton 2014, 2016). But our analysis shows that investment managers overseeing index funds have very limited incentives to bring about governancegenerated increases in value, be they long-term or short-term.  \n\n## Implications  \n\nThe rise of institutional investors has transformed the governance landscape facing the modern corporation. With shares concentrated in the hands of institutional investors, corporate managers no longer face diffuse shareholders that are powerless to engage with managers. However, the agency problems of institutional investors prevent the full realization of the potential benefits of the increased concentration of shareholdings. Investment managers overseeing diversified equity portfolios have incentives to spend considerably less on stewardship, and to side with corporate managers more frequently, than would be optimal for their beneficial investors. These factors operate to suppress investor stewardship relative to optimallevels.  \n\nIn this paper, we have provided a framework for analyzing these agency problems. We have also applied this framework to several key categories of investment managers. Our analysis has significant implications for researchers and policymakers. While a full analysis of these implications is beyond the scope of this paper, we outline ten of these implications below.  \n\n1. Research. Over recent decades, the amount of academic work analyzing agency problems in corporate governance has increased dramatically (for example, Bebchuk, Cohen, and Wang 2013), but most of this work has examined the agency problems of corporate insiders. We hope that our work will stimulate and provide a framework for future work on the agency problems of institutional investors.  \n\n2. Disclosure. Public awareness and academic research about the agency problems of managers of publicly traded corporations is facilitated by the extensive disclosures made by such corporations about internal decisions. Policymakers may wish to consider adopting regulations that would require investment managers to disclose information that would enable investors and others to identify and assess agency problems. For example, investment managers of mutual funds have been required to disclose how they vote their shares in publicly traded corporations since 2004, but some other investment managers are not required to do so. Furthermore, policymakers may want to consider tighter disclosure requirements that would provide comprehensive information about the business ties between investment managers and the public corporations in which they invest.  \n\n3. Regulation of Mutual Fund Fees. Regulations that preclude key investment managers from charging stewardship expenses to their investment funds, or from tying fees to increases in the value of their portfolios, have significant effects on the stewardship decisions of these investment managers. These regulations might be justified to protect the beneficial investors in these investment funds. However, policymakers should recognize the tradeoffs created by these rules, and consider whether some adjustments may be warranted.  \n\n4. Stewardship Codes. In a number of countries, such as the United Kingdom (Financial Reporting Council 2012), Japan (Council of Experts Concerning the Japanese Version of the Stewardship Code 2014), and Canada (Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada 2013), concerns about whether institutional investors undertake adequate stewardship have led to the development of nonbinding stewardships codes which various institutional investors have pledged to follow. Our analysis suggests that there is a problem with the incentives of institutional investors to spend on stewardship. To the extent that this is the case, stewardship codes putting forward aspirations, principles, or guidelines are likely to have less of an impact than if investment managers had appropriate incentives.  \n\n5. Index Investing. The rise of index investing has generally been viewed as a positive development because it has reduced the cost of investment intermediation. Our analysis shows that a continuation of this trend could have significant costs for corporate governance. This analysis also highlights the challenges likely to result if index funds continue to grow as expected.  \n\n6. Anticompetitive Effects of Index Investing: Recent work has raised concerns that, because index funds are invested across various corporations in an economic sector, they would have incentives to encourage those corporations to engage in anticompetitive behavior that would enable them to capture monopolistic rents, (for example, Elhauge 2016; Posner, Scott Morton, and Weyl 2016).4 This line of work is based on the premise that index fund managers have strong incentives to take whatever actions would maximize the collective wealth of their beneficial investors. Our analysis indicates that index fund managers might well have different incentives, which would lead them to limit intervention with their portfolio companies. Thus, our analysis suggests that it is implausible to expect that index fund managers would seek to facilitate significant anticompetitive behavior.  \n\n7. Proxy Advisors. Institutional investors commonly employ the services of one or more proxy advisors, such as ISS and Glass Lewis, which analyze voting choices faced by investors in public corporations and make recommendations (Malenko and Shen 2016). Critics of proxy advisors would prefer that institutional investors reduce their reliance on the analysis and recommendations provided by proxy advisors (Clark and Van Buren 2013). Indeed, legislation currently being considered by Congress (previously titled the Proxy Advisory Firm Reform Act of 2016) would regulate proxy advisors in ways that might significantly increase their costs of operation and otherwise discourage their activities. Our analysis raises a concern that a reduction in the activities of proxy advisors would not be offset by increased spending on analysis by institutional investors sufficient to maintain even their current levels of monitoring.  \n\n8. Hedge Fund Activism. There is a heated debate over the role of hedge fund activism. Whereas some writers, including one of us, have been supportive of such activism (for example, Bebchuk and Jackson 2012; Bebchuk 2013; Bebchuk, Brav, and Jiang 2015; Gilson and Gordon 2013), others view it as counterproductive and advocate various measures that would limit and discourage such activism (for example, Strine 2014; Coffee and Palia 2015). Some prominent critics of hedge fund activism would like to see the engagement currently conducted by activist hedge fund managers replaced by the stewardship of institutional investors. Our analysis shows the important role that activist hedge fund managers play in the corporate governance landscape. Because the incentives of mutual fund managers differ substantially from those of activist hedge fund managers, were the abilities of hedge funds to undertake such engagement to be impeded, stewardship by mutual fund managers would be unlikely to replace activist hedge fund managers in constraining agency problems in public corporations.  \n\n9. Wolf Packs. When an activist hedge fund takes a position in an underperforming public corporation, other hedge funds often acquire positions in the corporation (Brav, Dasgupta, and Mathews 2016). Groups of such “follower\" hedge funds are commonly referred to as “wolf packs,” and various writers have suggested that they are a negative influence (for example, Coffee and Palia 2015). Our analysis, however, indicates that so-called wolf packs might serve a useful purpose. Because mutual funds might be reluctant to vote against incumbents, an activist hedge fund might sometimes be unable to win a proxy fight against underperforming incumbents when such victory would be in the interests of investors. By contrast, when a dispute between incumbents and an activist hedge fund draws other hedge funds to invest, the new shareholders are more willing to also invest in assessing which course of action would be optimal and to vote accordingly, including voting against the incumbents if they conclude it to be value-enhancing.  \n\n10. Shareholder Rights. For some critics of shareholder rights (Bainbridge   \n2006, for example), the imperfections of institutional investors, and the fact that  \n\nstewardship decisions are taken by agents rather than the ultimate beneficial investors, provide a rationale for weakening shareholder rights and insulating corporate managers from shareholder action. Given that the agents may not be acting in the interests of beneficial investors, so the argument goes, there is reason to limit the power of the tools given to those agents lest they use the tools in ways that are counterproductive to the interests of their beneficial investors. However, our analysis of the agency problems of institutional investors identifies a clear direction in which their stewardship decisions deviate from those that are optimal for their beneficial investors: investment managers can be expected to underutilize the tools they have to engage with corporate managers.  \n\nThus, notwithstanding the imperfections of investment managers as agents for their beneficial investors, there is little basis for concerns that institutional investors will interfere excessively with the actions of corporate managers. Accordingly, there is no reason to weaken shareholder rights or impede shareholder action based on such concerns. An understanding of the agency problems of institutional investors leads to the conclusion that modern corporations do not suffer from too much shareholder intervention, but rather from too little.  \n\n# References  \n\nAdmati, Anat R., and Paul Pfleiderer. 2009.   \n\"The “Wall Street Walk' and Shareholder Activism:   \nExit as a Form of Voice.\" Review of Financial Studies   \n22(7) : 2645-85.

Using plant-level U.S.Census data during1978-2016,we find that:(i) local-level employerconcentrationexhibitssubstantialcross-sectionalvariation;(ii) consistent with labor market monopsony power, there is a negative relation betweenlocal-levelemployerconcentration andwagesthatstrengthens with time;(i) instrumenting concentration with merger activity shows that increased employer concentration decreases wages;(iv)the negative relation betweenemployerconcentration andwagesincreaseswhenunionizationrates are low; and(v) thelink between productivity growth and wage growth is strongerwhen labormarkets areless concentrated.Ourresults emphasize the role of local labor market monopsonies in influencing firm wage-setting.  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nA growing body of work showing rising levels of market concentration in the United States (see, for example, Barkai 2020; Grullon, Larkin, and Michaely 2019; Autor et al. 2017) has made it increasingly difficult to support the assumption of perfectly competitive labor markets as an adequate description of wage-setting processes. Rather than acting as price-takers faced with an infinitely elastic labor supply curve, a casual empiricism would suggest that firms enjoy at least some degree of wagesetting ability, often bargaining with workers over the surplus created by employment.  \n\nOne potentially important source of wage-setting ability stems from firms’ market power within labor markets: wages may be set in imperfectly competitive markets, with a relatively small number of employers bargaining with workers, ultimately setting wages below perfectly competitive rates (see, for example, Manning 2003).^ Much of the evidence on such market power within labor markets is either indirect or limited in nature.? Important examples include evidence on lawsuits against employer collusion using antipoaching agreements (U.S. Department of Justice Office of Public Affairs 2014; Whitney 2015), studies focused on particular occupations such as teaching or nursing (forexample, Sullivan 1989; Staiger, Spetz, and Phibbs 2010; Ransom and Sims 2010), evidence on employee noncompete restrictions and franchisee nonpoaching clauses (Krueger and Ashenfelter 2022; Starr, Prescott, and Bishara 2019), as well as the large literature beginning with Card and Krueger (1994) showing that minimum wage increases are not followed by reductions in employment, consistent with non-perfectly competitive labor markets.  \n\nWe use microlevel data from the U.s. Census Bureau to analyze how market power stemming from employer concentration in local labor markets—that is, monopsony power—affects wage behavior in the U.S. manufacturing sector. Because the relevant market associated with job search is largely local (Manning and Petrongolo 2017)  \n\nlabor mobility in the United States has declined significantly, and job switches often occur between positions in the same area (Moretti 2011; Molloy, Smith, and Wozniak 2014)—our analysis emphasizes the importance of measuring labor market concentration within relatively localized geographic areas.?  \n\nWe combine two main sources of data from the U.S. Census Bureau over the sample period 1978-2016. First, to measure local-level labor market concentration, we use the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) to construct the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) of firm employment at both the county-by-industry-by-year level as well as the commuting-zone-by-industry-by-year level. The HHI concentration measure is calculated at the local industry level (either county or commuting zone) under the plausible assumption that employees’ specific human capital and mobility costs constrain their job searches toward firms within the same industry and geographical area. These HHI measures of employer concentration are then related to measures of average wages and productivity at the establishment level constructed from the Census of Manufacturers (CMF) and the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM). By focusing our analysis on manufacturing we are able to control for standard measures of labor productivity——an important correlate in any analysis of wage determination.  \n\nWe obtain six main results. First, local-level employer concentration exhibits significant cross-sectional variation. For example, during 1978-2016, the standard deviation of local-level employer HHI (defined over commuting zones and four-digit standard industry classification [SIC] codes) was 0.343, equal to approximately 70 percent of the mean local-level HHI of 0.481. Further, average levels of concentration have remained fairly stable during the sample period, with employment-weighted concentration levels increasing by no more than 3.2 percent. For example, the mean employment-weighted employer concentration HHI measure calculated at the four-digit SIC code and commuting zone was 0.569 during 1978-1987 and 0.587 during 2008-2016.  \n\nOur second result establishes our baseline finding: there is a negative relation between wages and the local-level HHI measures of employer concentration, with an elasticity of wages to HHI of approximately $-0.01$ Over the full sample period. Employers operating in areas with more concentrated labor markets thus appear able to exploit monopsony power in order to reduce employee wages.  \n\nTo mitigate concerns regarding correlations between the local-level HHI measure of concentration and other observable and unobservable differences across plants, industries, and local areas (see, for example, Boal and Ransom 1997), we show that our results continue to hold after controlling for a host of observables likely to affect wages. These include establishment-level labor productivity, local labor market size, and firmby-year fixed effects. Identification is thus achieved using within firm-year variation, comparing multiple establishments belonging to the same firm but located in areas, or belonging to industries, with varying levels of labor market concentration. The findings are also robust to the use of industry-by-year fixed effects together with firm-by-year fixed effects.7 This battery of controls removes any common cross-industry variation within firms, thereby alleviating cross-industry heterogeneity as an alternative channel that drives wage differences. In the preferred specification (with both firm-by-year and industry-by-year fixed effects), the results show that moving from one standard deviation below to one standard deviation above the mean level of local HHI is associated with a 2.9 percent decline in wages. We further show that our baseline results continue to hold in a subsample of firms that operate multiple plants in only one industry segment. Using this subsample in conjunction with firm-by-year fixed effects, we largely avoid the alternative explanation of cross-industry heterogeneity.  \n\nTo further alleviate concerns regarding the endogeneity of local-level concentration, we employ an instrumental variable approach that uses merger and acquisition (M&A) activity to instrument for local-level employer concentration. In particular, we exploit variation in local-level employer concentration driven by M&A activity that reallocates the ownership of establishments between different firms. Using M&A activity to instrument for local-level employer concentration, our third result is that increased employer concentration leads to lower wages, with the elasticity of wages to local-level HHI risingtobetween $-0.03$ and $-0.06$ . Based on the instrumental variable (IV) estimates (with commuting zones to define employer concentration), the results imply that moving from one standard deviation below to one standard deviation above the mean level of local HHI is associated with a decline in wages between 9.1 percent and 14.4 percent.  \n\nWe continue by showing that the negative relation between employer concentration and wages monotonically increases in magnitude over the sample period. In the preferred specification, the elasticity in the initial decade of the sample (1978-1987) is a statistically insignificant $-0.001$ , while in the last decade of the sample (2008-2016) the elasticity rises to $-0.018$ . This increased sensitivity of wages to employer concentration is consistent with a secular decline in worker bargaining power over time, as would be predicted by the reduction in labor mobility in the United States (constraining the choice set of workers as they search for employment and negotiate over compensation) or by the drop in unionization rates within the United States beginning in the 1970s (Card 1992).  \n\nOur fourth finding concerns the impact of unionization on the relation between employer concentration and wages. We hypothesize that by improving employee bargaining power, unionization may diminish the ability of employers to lower wages in concentrated labor markets. The data, indeed, bear this out. The negative relation between the HHI labor market concentration measure and wages is significantly weaker among plants in industries with high unionization rates. In industries with unionization rates near zero, the elasticity between wages and HHI is approximately $-0.015$ ,while in contrast, at the average unionization rate, the elasticity between wages and local-level labor market concentration wages declines by between 29 and 45 percent, depending on the specification.  \n\nFifth, we investigate how local-level labor market concentration affects the transmission of productivity growth into higher wages. We hypothesize that high levels of employer concentration impede the translation of productivity growth to wage increases, as employers use their monopsony power to avoid wage increases. In contrast, when labor markets are more competitive, productivity increases should give rise to wage growth as employers compete for workers. Put differently, productivity growth should translate into a rise in wages when employee bargaining power is sufficiently high.  \n\nMeasuring labor productivity at the establishment level using census data, we first confirm a link between wage growth and productivity growth, measured at an annual frequency (see, for example, Stansbury and Summers 2017). Importantly, consistent with our hypothesis on the role of monopsony power in labor markets, we find that the link between wage growth and productivity growth is larger when local-level employer concentration is low. Using commuting zones to define local-level employer concentration, the results show that decreasing the employer-based HHI measure of concentration by one standard deviation from its mean is associated with an increase of between 11.2 percent and 18 percent in the elasticity of wages to productivity.  \n\nOur sixth result investigates the impact of increased trade with China—the “China shock\"on the level of local labor market concentration. In contrast to our prior findings, in this analysis we focus on the determinants, rather than the effects, of labor market concentration. We hypothesize that by causing employers to shut down a fraction of their operations, increased import competition from China may have led to an increase in local labor market concentration. This is indeed confirmed in the data: a onestandard deviation rise in industry-level import exposure from China is associated with an increase of approximately 3.5 percent in local-level employer concentration. Aside from labor displacement and an associated decline in wages due to reduced labor demand, increased import competition from China may thus have an additional effect of reducing wages of nondisplaced workers due to an increase in employer concentration.  \n\nThis work relates to a growing literature dealing with monopsony in labor markets.9 As explained above, most prior empirical work on monopsony power and the ability of firms to reduce wages is either indirect (for example, the literature analyzing the employment impact of minimum wage increases) or concentrated on certain occupations or industries. In contrast to these studies, we provide a direct measure of the degree of locallevel labor market competition and relate it to wage behavior on a host of margins. Our study is thus most closely related to work by Azar, Marinescu, and Steinbaum (2022), who use online job postings from the website CareerBuilder.com to construct a locallevel measure of employer concentration based on commuting zones and occupations.  \n\nThe main finding of Azar, Marinescu, and Steinbaum (2022) is that increased locallevel labor market concentration within a given occupation and commuting zone predicts lower online wage postings. Though related, the two papers are differentiated along a number of important dimensions. We use actual wages (at the establishment level) as taken from the Census Bureau, whereas they analyze wage postings offered by firms. Our study uses a series of data that span more than three decades and cover the entire manufacturing sector, whereas Azar, Marinescu, and Steinbaum (2022) examine online wage posting within CareerBuilder.com (that is, not solely focused on manufacturing) over a relatively short time (2009-2012). Further, because our study focuses on manufacturing, we can control directly for productivity—an important covariate when analyzing wages—at the establishment-year level. Last, and most importantly, we provide novel evidence on the time-series evolution of the effect of employer concentration, the impact of unionization on the relation between local employer concentration and wages, how labor market concentration affects the transmission of productivity changes into wage growth, and the impact of mergers on local-level concentration and wages.  \n\nAn additional difference of note between the two papers pertains to the elasticity of wages to local-level employer concentration. Whereas over the last decade in the sample (2008-2016), the ordinary least squares (OLS) elasticity found in the present study is approximately $-0.02$ , in Azar, Marinescu, and Steinbaum (2022) the elasticity (estimated over the 2009-2012 time period) is larger in magnitude and equal to $-0.038$ . Similarly, in their IV specification, Azar, Marinescu, and Steinbaum (2022) find an elasticity of (posted) wages to local-level employer concentration of $-0.127$ , while our IV results show an elasticity that is between $-0.03$ and $-0.06$ , depending on the specification. As the studies and the employed data sets differ along a host of dimensions—sample period, industries analyzed, online posted wages versus average wages at the establishment— the difference between estimated elasticities is a topic for future research.  \n\nRinz (2022) analyzes the relation between local labor market concentration and wages using the IV methodology in Azar, Marinescu, and Steinbaum (2022). Similar to Azar, Marinescu, and Steinbaum (2022) and our results, Rinz (2022) finds a negative relation between wages and employer concentration. Our work also relates to the growing literature on increased market concentration within industries in the United States (see, for example, Barkai 2020; Autor et al. 2017; De Locker and Eeckhout 2017; Gutiérrez and Philippon 2017) and the relation between such concentration, firm markups, and the labor income share. Whereas this literature focuses on the decrease in competition within the product market and the negative relation between product market competition and the labor share, we focus on concentration within the market for labor—-that is, the ability of monopsonist employers in the corporate sector to exploit their local-level market power to reduce wages.  \n\nThe rest of the article is organized as follows. Section II presents the data and summary statistics. Section MI presents the empirical analysis, and Section IV concludes.  \n\n## II. Data and Key Variables  \n\n### A. Data Sources and Sample Construction  \n\n#### 1.Plant-level data  \n\nTo construct measures of wages and labor productivity we obtain data on manufacturing establishments (\"plants\") from the Census of Manufacturers (CMF) and the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM) maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau. The CMF covers all manufacturing plants in the United States for years ending in the digits 2 and 7 (\"census years\"), resulting in roughly 300,000 plants in each census. The ASM covers approximately 50,0o0 plants for non-census years. The ASM includes all plants with more than a threshold number of employees, with this threshold increasing from 250 to 1,000 during our sample period.1° Plants with fewer employees are sampled randomly, with the probability of inclusion increasing in size. Although the ASM is called a survey, reporting is mandatory if the plant is selected, and misreporting is subject to legal penalties and fines. Both databases provide operating information at the plant level, including the total value of shipments, wages, labor hours, and material and energy costs. A key advantage of the CMF and ASM data over standard firm-level databases of public firms, such as Compustat, is that they comprise both privately and publicly owned plants, covering a significant fraction of U.S. workers.  \n\nWe also use the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) to construct measures of local-level employer concentration, as described below. The LBD is a comprehensive data set of manufacturing and nonmanufacturing establishments in the United States, tracking more than 5 million establishments per year. The data set provides plant-level number of employees, annual payroll, industry classification, and geographic location (for example, counties and states). We use the LBD rather than the ASM and CMF data to construct measures of labor market concentration since the LBD tracks nearly the entire population of establishments at a yearly frequency. In contrast, the ASM tracks a varying subset of plants over time (due to random sampling), while the CMF is constructed at only a five-year frequency.  \n\nIn our analysis we also use a set of common control variables standard among research analyzing plant-level data employing the CMF and ASM data sets (see, for example, Schoar 2002). Specifically, firm size is measured by the log number of plants of a given firm, while firm segment size, defined at the firm-industry level, is measured by the log number of plants belonging to the firm in a given industry. Plant age is defined as the number of years since a plant's inception—identified by the flag for plant inception in the LBD—or its first appearance in the CMF or ASM database, whichever is the earliest. The starting year is censored in 1972 when the coverage of the census databasesbegins.  \n\nWe require each plant observation to have variables necessary to estimate average wages, labor productivity, and labor value added. Specifically, we require that plant observations include information on total value of shipments, production-worker equivalent hours, total wages, number of employees (both production and nonproduction), and material and energy costs. Because our identification strategy relies on withinfirm variation in wages and employer concentration across plants, we require that firm-- years have at least two plants under their ownership. In addition, we require that each plant-year have a one-year lagged observation, which is needed to compute changes in average wages and productivity in part of our analysis. Our selection procedure yields approximately 946,000 plant-years over the sample period 1978-2016.12  \n\n#### 2. Measuring employer concentration, wages, and labor productivity  \n\nAs our main measure of local employer concentration we use the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) of firm employment in a given industry and at a local labor market. Since there is no clear definition of what constitutes the geographic boundaries of a local labor market we define our measure as either the county-industry-year level or the commuting zone-industry-year level.13  \n\nUsing the LBD data we first measure the employment share of every firm in a given county or commuting zone and industry year cell as: $s_{f,j,c,t}=\\frac{e m p_{f,j,c,t}}{\\sum_{f=1}^{N}e m p_{f,j,c,t}}$ ，where $e m p_{f,j,c,t}$ represents total employment of firm $f$ in industry $j$ in county (or commuting zone) $c$ in year t. We calculate the local-level HHI as the sum of the squared employment shares at the country or commuting zone industry-year level: $\\begin{array}{r}{H H I_{j,c,t}=\\sum_{f=1}^{N}s_{f,j,c,t}^{2}.}\\end{array}$ We construct two variants of the employer-concentration HHI measures using either three- or four-digit SIC codes to define industries (thus, four different measures of concentration in total).  \n\nWe use the log of average wages per worker at the plant-year level as our main dependent variable. Average wages at the plant-year level are calculated as the total wage bill at the establishment divided by its number of workers. We also use labor productivity (per hour) as a control variable, defined as output divided by total labor hours. As is standard, output is computed as the sum of the total value of shipments and the net increase in inventories of finished goods and works in progress. To account for industrylevel changes in output price, we divide output by the four-digit SIC-level output price deflator from the NBER-CES manufacturing industry database constructed by Bartelsman, Becker, and Gray (2000). Total labor hours are measured by “productionworker equivalent hours\" computed using the ASM and CMF data (as in Lichtenberg 1992; Kovenock and Phillips 1997). Specifically, total labor hours are constructed as the total production-worker hours multiplied by total wages divided by wages for productionworkers.  \n\n#### 3. Union coverage data  \n\nWe construct data on collective bargaining coverage by following the approach in Hirsch and Macpherson (2003).14 Below we provide a detailed account of the data source and construction that are relevant for our empirical analysis.  \n\nWe compute the fraction of workers covered by labor unions at the industry-level using the Current Population Survey (CPS) Outgoing Rotation Groups (ORG) data.15 The resulting data set provides union coverage rate estimates, defined as the number of employees covered by labor unions divided by total employment, by Census Industry Code (CIC) beginning in 1983. Because our plant-level data utilize SIC codes, we match the union coverage data with census plant-level data at the industry level as follows.16 For the years 1983-2002, we use the 1980 and 1990 U.S. Census Bureau's concordances between CIC codes and SIC codes. For 2003-2016, during which the CIC is based on NAICS codes, we first match 2000 CIC codes to 1990 CIC codes using the U.S. Census  \n\nBureau's concordance and then use the Census Bureau's concordance between 1990   \nCIC and SIC codes to match with the census plant-level data.17  \n\nOur analysis focuses on manufacturing plant-year observations in the ASM and CMF databases for 1978-2016 (the first and last years of data coverage). Given that our industry-level database on union coverage begins in 1983, while our sample period starts in 1978, we impute the rate of collective bargaining coverage using 1983 information for years between 1978 and 1982.18  \n\n### B. Descriptive Statistics  \n\nTable 1 reports descriptive statistics for the characteristics of the plant observations over the period 1978-2016. The average plant in the sample has $\\$97.9$ million in total value of shipments (\\*\"sales\") and approximately 300 employees with an average annual wage $\\$41,540$ 19 The average plant-level log labor productivity is 4.49, while average plant age is 16.5 years. Firms in our sample own on average 50.9 plants, while the average firm segment (defined at the three-digit SIC level) has 15.2 plants. The average union coverage rate for the manufacturing plants in our sample is 19.8 percent.  \n\nFocusing on our measures of local-level employer concentration, the mean employer concentration HHI measure defined at the three-digit SIC and county level is 0.520, while the mean four-digit SIC and county-based HHI measure is 0.651. The standard deviation of county-level HHI using the three-digit SIC code classification is O.347, while using the four-digit SIC code, the standard deviation is 0.338. When we define local-level employer concentration at the commuting zone level, the HHI measures are naturally lower: the mean employer concentration HHIs defined at the three- and fourdigit SIC and commuting zone levels are 0.338 and 0.481, respectively, with an associated standard deviation of0.308 and 0.343. Thus, the data show significant variation in the local-level concentration measure, with a ratio of standard deviation to mean local HHI varying between 0.52 and 0.91, depending on the industry classification used and the geographic classification.  \n\nWe also define indicator variables that take the value of one in county-industries in which the employer concentration HHI measure equals one, and zero otherwise. These HHI-based indicator variables are designed to capture counties with high monopsony power of one large employer within a given industry. As Table 1 shows, such a high degree of concentration is not uncommon, with 21.1 percent (8.0 percent) of plant-year observations in counties (commuting zones) in which there is only one employer in a given three-digit SIC industry.  \n\nFigure 1 plots trends in local-level employer concentration over time, showing that employer concentration has remained relatively stable over the sample period 1978- 2016. In Panel A, while the average local-level HHI concentration measure (defined at  \n\nTable1 Summary Statistics onPlant Observations from theCMF and ASMSample   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Mean</td><td>SD</td></tr><tr><td>Total value of shipment ($m)</td><td>97.92</td><td>445.90</td></tr><tr><td>Total wages ($m)</td><td>10.95</td><td>35.78</td></tr><tr><td>Total employees</td><td>299.80</td><td>732.50</td></tr><tr><td>Total labor hours (000)</td><td>717.10</td><td>6465.00</td></tr><tr><td>HHI (SIC3-county-year)</td><td>0.520</td><td>0.347</td></tr><tr><td>HHI (SIC4-county-year)</td><td>0.651</td><td>0.338</td></tr><tr><td>HHI (SIC3-CZ-year)</td><td>0.338</td><td>0.308</td></tr><tr><td>HHI (SIC4-CZ-year)</td><td>0.481</td><td>0.343</td></tr><tr><td>HHI (SIC3-county-year)= 1</td><td>0.211</td><td>0.408</td></tr><tr><td>HHI (SIC3-CZ-year)= 1</td><td>0.080</td><td>0.271</td></tr><tr><td>Log labor productivity</td><td>4.49</td><td>0.86</td></tr><tr><td>Average wage ($000)</td><td>41.54</td><td>14.18</td></tr><tr><td>Average wage ($ooo), production</td><td>36.82</td><td>13.65</td></tr><tr><td>log(employment, SIC3-county-year)</td><td>6.24</td><td>1.61</td></tr><tr><td>log(employment, SIC4-county-year)</td><td>5.75</td><td>1.56</td></tr><tr><td>log(employment, SIC3-CZ-year)</td><td>7.10</td><td>1.63</td></tr><tr><td>log(employment, SIC4-CZ-year)</td><td>6.40</td><td>1.60</td></tr><tr><td>Plants per segments (SIC3)</td><td>15.17</td><td>34.08</td></tr><tr><td>Plants per firm</td><td>50.88</td><td>72.68</td></tr><tr><td>Plant age</td><td>16.49</td><td>10.80</td></tr><tr><td>Unionization rate</td><td>0.198</td><td>0.123</td></tr><tr><td>Observations (plant-years)</td><td>946,000</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNotes: This table presents descriptive statistics on the manufacturing plant-year observations used in the analysis from the CMF and ASM databases for the period 1978-2016. We require each observation in the sample to have all variables necessary to compute average wages, labor productivity, and value added per worker (and their lagged values). Total value of shipments is TVS in the CMF and ASM databases and a measure of sales from plants in million dollars. Total wage is the sum of wages for production and nonproduction workers in million dollars. Total employees is the number of total employees. Total labor hours is the production worker equivalent human hours in thousands. HHI (SIC3 or 4county or CZ-year) is the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of employment by firms at the county or commuting zone (CZ)-industry (three- or four-digit)-year level. HHI (SIC3-countyorCZ-year) $^{\\astrosun}$ is an indicatorvariable equal toone if $\\mathrm{HHI}=1$ ,and zero otherwise.HHI (SIC3 or 4-year) is the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of employment by firms at the industry (three- or four-digit)- year level. log(employment, SIC3 or 4-county or CZ-year) is the log number of employees at the county or CZindustry (three- or four-digit)-year level. Labor productivity is defined as output divided by total labor hours (a quantity-based measure of labor productivity). Average wage is computed as total wage divided by total employees (in thousand dollars). Average wage, production is computed as production employee wage divided by total production employees (in thousand dollars). log(employment, SIC3 or 4-county or CZ-year) is the log number of employment at the county or CZ-industry (three- or four-digit)-year level. Plants per segment is the number of plants in a given three-digit SIC industry segment of a given firm.Plants perfirm is the total number of plants of a given firm. Plant age is the number of years since a plant's birth, which is proxied either by the flag for plant birth in the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) or by its first appearance in the CMF or ASM database, whichever is earliest. Unionization rate is the industry-level percentage of the workforce covered by collective bargaining collected from the CPS. The number of observations is rounded to the nearest thousand to follow the U.S. Census Bureau's disclosure rules.  \n\n![](images/861abef93a74d90f4f40f85c21e39660d1fde322787ed7c411c71f478c789746.jpg)  \nFigure 1 Trends in Average Local-Level Employment Concentration, 1978-2016  \n\nNotes: This figure plots trends in the employment-weighted average of the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of employment by firms computed at the county (Panel A) or commuting zone (Panel B) four-digit SIC industry-year level. The computed HHI is averaged across county-four-digit industry-year cells within each of the ten-year periods (the last period includes nine years, 2008-2016) using the number of employees in each cell as weights. Thus, the average HHI represents the degree of employer concentration the average worker facesinthelabormarket.  \n\nthe four-digit SIC and county level) increased slightly from 0.712 to 0.735 between 1978-1987 and 1988-1997, it remains around 0.735 in the next two decades.20 Similarly, Panel B shows that the average local-level HHI concentration measure (defined at the four-digit SIC and commuting zone level) increased from 0.569 to 0.587 in the first two decades—an increase of 3.2 percent——-and then remains at a similar level in the next two ten-year periods.21  \n\n## III. Empirical Analysis  \n\n### A. Relation between Employer Concentration and Wages  \n\nWe begin by investigating a reduced-form baseline relation between employer concentration and wages. To this end, we run the following regression:  \n\n$$\n\\log(a\\nu g.w a g e s)_{p f t}=\\upbeta_{0}+\\upbeta_{1}\\log(\\mathrm{HHI})_{j c t-1}+\\upbeta_{2}\\mathbf{X}_{p f j t}+\\upbeta_{3}\\mathbf{Z}_{j c t-1}+\\updelta_{j t}+\\upmu_{f t}+\\upvarepsilon_{p f j t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\log(a\\nu g.w a g e s)_{p f j t}$ is log average wages per worker in plant $p$ , owned by firm $f,$ operating within industry $j,$ in year $t$ $\\log(\\mathrm{HHI}_{j c t-1})$ is the log of one-year lagged employment-based measure of concentration in either county (or commuting zone) $c$ and industry $j$ , defined at either the three- or four-digit SIC level; $\\mathbf{X}_{p f\\mid t}$ is a vector of plantlevel control variables comprising the log of labor productivity, the log of the number of plants per segment within the firm, the log of the number of plants per firm, and plant age; $\\mathbf{Z}_{j c t-1}$ is the one-year lagged log of aggregate employment at the county-industry level; $\\updelta_{j t}$ is a vector of either industry or industry-by-year fixed effects; and $\\upmu_{f t}$ is a vector of firm or firm-by-year fixed effects. All standard errors are clustered at the county or commuting zone level.  \n\nTable 2 provides the results from estimating Equation 1 using either three- or fourdigit SIC codes and either county or commuting zone to compute the HHI employment concentration measure. Column 1 of Table 2 includes as explanatory variables year, industry, and firm fixed effects in addition to log employment at the three-digit industry-- county level and plant-level controls (labor productivity and plant age), as well as firmand firm segment-level controls, such as log(plants per segment) and log(plants per firm). The plant-level explanatory variables—-in particular, log(labor productivity) and plant age——control for plant-level productivity, alleviating the concern that our results are driven by productivity differences across plants. Further, by including industry and firm fixed effects, we exploit within-firm and within-industry variation of employer concentration to identify the relation between wages and employer concentration. Thus, the estimates in Column 1 are based off of variation in employer concentration across different local labor markets within a given firm and industry.  \n\n(mo)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"10\">Dep.

This finding is consistent with economic forces related to agglomeration (for example, Ellison, Glaeser, and Kerr 2010; Greenstone, Hornbeck, and Moretti 2010). As would be expected, the coefficient on log labor productivity is positive (equal to 0.072 and significant at the 1 percent level), indicating a positive relation between productivity and wages.  \n\nTurning to our main variable of interest, $\\mathrm{log(HHI)}$ , and still focusing on Column 1, the results indicate a negative relation between wages and local-level employer concentration calculated at the county level. The elasticity of wages to local-level HHI is $-0.01$ , with the relation between log(wages) and $\\mathrm{log(HHI)}$ statistically significant at the 1 percent level. The wage-to-HHI elasticity implies that moving from one standard deviation below to one standard deviation above the mean-level HHI is associated with a decrease of 1.6 percent in wages.22 Thus, consistent with the hypothesis that labor market monopsony power detrimentally affects wages, the data show that wages are negatively related to the degree of employer concentration in the local labor market. Welag $\\mathrm{log(HHI)}$ by one year since it may take time for labor market monopsony power to affect wages. Our results are not sensitive to this modeling choice, and we obtain similar results when using contemporaneous $\\mathrm{log(HHI)}$ in our regressions (Appendix 1 Table A1).  \n\nWhile the fixed effects in Column 1 mitigate the concern that lower wages in more concentrated labor markets are due to heterogeneity across firms, an additional concern is that the negative association between local employer concentration and wages is driven by omitted differences across different industries within firms in a given year. For example, a firm may have a more productive industry segment (for example, machinery) in a less concentrated local labor market, and a less productive segment (for example, chemicals) in a more concentrated market, which may lead to a spurious correlation between concentration and wages due to differences in productivity levels. To address this concern, in Column 2 of Table 2 we include both firm-by-year fixed effects as well as industry-by-year fixed effects, which absorb time-varying industry-level shocks. In this analysis the identifying variation stems from plants operating in the same industry and belonging to the same firm located in different counties with varying levels of employer concentration.  \n\nAs can be seen in Column 2, the elasticity of wages to employer concentration remains virtually unchanged at $-0.009$ and significant at the 1 percent level. Thus, comparing plants in the same industry and firm in a given year, we find that those located in a more concentrated local labor market pay lower wages. Moving from one standard deviation below to one standard deviation above the mean-level HHI is associated with a 1.5 percent decline in wages. Columns 3 and 4 repeat the analysis in Columns 1 and 2 using an industry definition that is based on four-digit SIC codes and yield similar estimates to those in Columns 1 and 2. Our identification strategy hinges on the use of within-firm variation——-hence, we use either firm or firm-year fixed effects. However, we also report results from estimating Equation 1 without firm or industry fixed effects in Column 5 and find an elasticity of wages to employer concentration of $-0.022$  \n\nColumns 6-10 of Table 2 repeat the analysis in Columns 1-5 using commuting zones——-instead of counties——to compute the HHI measure of employer concentration. Indeed, commuting zones are constructed such that, “CZs...are geographic units of analysis intended to more closely reflect the local economy where people live and work.. .These commuting zones...are intended to be a spatial measure of the local labor market.\\*23 The negative relation between concentration and employee wages is evident when we use commuting zones to define local labor markets as well. The estimated elasticities in Columns 5-8 imply that moving from one standard deviation below to one standard deviation above the mean-level HHI is associated wages that are lower by between 2.0 percent and 2.9 percent.  \n\nTo further alleviate the concern that industry-level heterogeneity (in productivity in particular) is driving the relation between employer concentration and wages, we focus our estimation on a subsample of firms that operate multiple plants within a single industry segment (with industries defined at either the three- or four-digit SIC level). Combined with firm-by-year fixed effects, using this subsample removes cross-industry variation within firms, thereby sidestepping cross-industry heterogeneity as an alternative channel that drives wage differences. 24  \n\nTable 3 presents the results from estimating Equation 1 using a subsample of firms that operate multiple plants within a single industry segment, defined at the three- or four-digit SIC level. As Table 3 illustrates, across all columns the coefficient on the employer concentration HHI measure is negative and significant at the 1 percent level, consistent with the baseline result in Table 2. The economic magnitude is larger than that exhibited in Table 2, indicating that the effect is larger among the subset of firms that are unlikely to be affected by cross-industry heterogeneity in productivity and wages. For example, when we define local labor markets at the commuting zone and three-digit SIC level, the effect of moving from one standard deviation below to one standard deviation above the mean-level HHI is associated with a 5.1 percent decline in wages.  \n\nIn sum, our results are robust to the inclusion of industry-by-year fixed effects and hold in multiple-plant, single-industry firms, thus alleviating concerns that industrylevel heterogeneity is driving the negative relation between employer concentration and wages. While we focus our analysis on the manufacturing sector to control for productivity in our wage regressions, we expect our results to hold in other industries that also exhibit employer concentration. Indeed, Rinz (2022) confirms the negative relation between earnings and employer concentration in other industries in the United States, while Abel, Tenreyro, and Thwaites (2018) confirm a similar negative relation for a wide sample of firms in the United Kingdom.  \n\n### B.Robustness Tests—LaborProductivity and National-Level Concentration 1. Controlling for labor value added  \n\nOne concern regarding the negative relation between employer concentration and wages presented in our baseline results is that the local-level HHI measure is correlated with labor productivity, implying that the results may be capturing the effect of low productivity, rather than employer concentration, on wages. Although all regressions control for the log of labor productivity (defined as the natural log of output scaled by labor hours), this variable may still be an imperfect control for actual labor productivity. To alleviate this concern, in Table 4 we add to the regression specification an additional control variable for labor productivity—namely, value added (VA) by labor. As is standard, value added is defined as the total value of shipments plus the net increase in inventories of finished goods and works in progress minus material and energy costs scaled by total labor hours, with all components deflated using four-digit SIC industry-level deflators (available from the NBER-CES manufacturing database). One key difference of labor value added relative to our labor productivity measure is that the former nets out intermediate inputs (that is, material and energy), which are presumably not affected by labor inputs.  \n\nsudss   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"9\">Dep.

Importantly, the coefficients on the locallevel HHI measure of employer concentration remain statistically significant, and their magnitudes are almost identical to those found in Table 2.  \n\n#### 2. Controlling for national-level employer concentration  \n\nAutor et al. (2017) show that product markets in the United States have become more concentrated in the past few decades, giving rise to “superstar firms” that are highly productive yet have lower labor shares of income. Related to these findings, one concern regarding our results is that if product market concentration—commonly defined at the national level for traded sectors such as manufacturing—and local labor market concentrations are positively correlated, then the negative association between local employment concentration and wages may merely reflect a negative relation between (national) product market concentration and labor shares.  \n\nIn response to this concern, we note first that as part of our identification strategy we include firm-by-year fixed effects. As such, the identification exploits within-firm-year variation across plants belonging to the same firm. This speaks against the hypothesis that our results are driven by heterogeneity across firms, as, for example, implied by the existence of “superstar firms.\" To further alleviate this concern, we proxy for nationallevel product market competition by constructing our employer HHI concentration measures at the national level. We first measure the employment share of every firm in a $s_{f,j,t}=\\frac{e m p_{f,j,t}}{\\sum_{f=1}^{N}e m p_{f,j,t}}$ . where $e m p_{f,j,t}$ ployment in $\\mathrm{firm}f$ operating in industry $j$ in year $t.$ We next calculate the industry-year HHI as the sum o the squared employment shares: $\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathrm{HHI}_{j,t}=\\sum_{f=1}^{N}s_{f,j,t}^{2}.}\\end{array}$ As with the locallevel HHI, we define two variants of the national-level HHI using either three- or fourdigit SIC codes. We then include the national-level HHI as a proxy for product market concentration in Equation 1.  \n\nTable 5 shows that the coefficient on national-level HHI (calculated using either threedigit or four-digit SIC codes) is positive and statistically significant in Columns 2-4, inconsistent with the alternative explanation that high levels of national-level employer concentration are associated with lower wages. Importantly, even with the inclusion of the national HHI measure of employer concentration, the coefficient on the local HHI remains negative with slightly higher magnitudes than those found in Table 2.  \n\nTable5 Local Employer Concentration and Wages Controllingfor National Concentration   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"4\"></td><td colspan=\"4\">Dep.

Using Mergers and Acquisitions to Instrument forLocal EmployerConcentration  \n\nOur results thus far document a negative relation between local employer concentration and wages. In order to better identify the link between employer concentration and wages, our results rely on within-firm or within-firm-by-year variation, controlling for cross-industry heterogeneity and plant-level productivity. In this section, we attempt to further alleviate omitted-variable concerns by employing an instrumental variable (IV) approach. Following previous literature identifying mergers and acquisitions (M&As) as a key driver of increased concentration and market power of firms in a given industry (for example, Kim and Singal 1993; Grullon, Larkin, and Michaely 2019; Naidu, Posner, and Weyl 2018), we use M&A activity as an IV for local labor market concentration. We focus on M&As because ordinary plant openings and closings (which may affect local employer concentration) are likely driven by local economic conditions, which in turn have a direct effect on wages. In contrast, M&A activity and the plant ownership switches entailed, enable us to exploit variation in plant ownership and concentration that is not driven by plant openings or closings.  \n\nBefore moving to our main IV analysis, we demonstrate the endogeneity problem of using plant openings and closings to measure concentration by regressing the number of plant openings and closings on local economic conditions. Using the census LBD we define dependent variables as the number of plant openings and closings at the three- or four-digit SIC industry-county-year level for 1978-2015. Next we match these industry-county-year observations to the one-year-lagged county-level unemployment-to-population ratio and log median household income. We estimate the following regression:  \n\n$$\n\\log(1+\\#~o f~p l a n t~o p e n i n g s~o r~c l o s u r e s)_{j c t}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}{\\bf X}_{c t-1}+\\delta_{j c}+{\\bf\\upmu}_{t}+\\varepsilon_{j c t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $l o g(1+\\#$ of plant openingsorclosures $)_{j c t}$ is the log ( $1+$ number of plant openings or closures) in industry $j$ defined at either the three- or four-digit SIC level, in county $c$ , in year t ${\\mathbf{X}}_{c t-1}$ is the one-year lagged unemployment-to-population ratio and log median household income in county c; $\\updelta_{j c}$ is a vector of industry-by-county fixed effects; and ${\\bf\\upmu}_{t}$ is a vector of year fixed effects. All standard errors are clustered at the county level.  \n\nTable 6 reports the regression estimates of Equation 2, with the analysis using either levels (odd numbered columns) or first differences (even numbered columns) of the local economic condition variables described above. Columns 1-4 show that the lagged county-level unemployment-to-population ratio is significantly negatively associated with the number of plant openings in a given industry-county. On the other hand, lagged county-level unemployment-to-population ratio is significantly positively associated with the number of plant closings (Columns 5-8). The coefficient on the log median household income is largely insignificant, except for in Column 6.  \n\nTo construct our instrument, we use the annual information on plant ownership within the LBD data. Defining M&A activity using cases in which plant ownership switches from one firm to another, our identification strategy focuses on plant ownership changes between two firms, each of which operated at least one plant in the local labor market one year prior to the merger. Since prior to the merger both acquirer and seller firms operated plants in the local labor market, the switch in plant ownership shifts local-level employer concentration. Moreover, by focusing on M&A activity of firms that had existing plants in the local labor market before the merger, we are able to exploit variation in plant ownership and concentration, which is not driven by plant openings or closings. To avoid a weak instruments problem, we require that the combined employment share of both the acquiring and selling firms in the local labor market exceeds a threshold of either 5 percent or 10 percent, one year prior to the merger.  \n\nWe instrument the five-year change in local-level log(HHI) using lagged measures of M&A activity in a given local labor market. To this end, we define a set of instruments based on the log number of plants (or alternatively the log number of employees) involved in M&A transactions in a given year, industry, and either county or commuting zone. Plant involvement in M&A activity is defined by plant ownership switches as explained above. We then use instrumented changes in local-level employer concentration to predict log changes in wages, after controlling for industry-by-year fixed effects and changes in a vector of plant- and local-level characteristics. Specifically, we run the following regressions:  \n\nansoouuado ud pu suou uo   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>SIC4 Diff. Dep. Var.: Log # Plant Closures Dep.

All standard errors are clustered at either the county or community zone level. Our sample for the IV analysis includes approximately 467,000 plant-year observations with five years of lagged M&A measures for 1983-2016.  \n\nThe main identifying assumption underlying our identification is that plant acquisitions impact local-level wages only through their effect on local labor market concentration. We attempt to alleviate endogeneity concerns by constructing our IV on the basis of mergers that are potentially driven by strategic considerations and are not necessarily related to local labor market conditions or plant level characteristics. To the extent that a merger is driven by local economic conditions, this identification assumption is clearly problematic. IV estimates should thus be interpreted with caution given the potential endogenous nature of the merger itself.  \n\nPanel A of Table 7 reports the first-stage regression results. Column 1, which uses counties to define the local market and the log number of plants involved in M&As as the instrument, shows that the coefficient estimates for the instruments, $\\mathbf{M}\\&\\mathbf{A}_{t-k}$ $(1\\le k\\le5)$ , are positive and statistically significant at the 1 percent level. Thus, as expected, when more plants are affected by M&As in the prior five years, employment concentration in local labor markets rises. The economic magnitude of the relation between the instruments and changes in HHI is sizable—for example, the elasticity of changes in HHI over the previous five years to the number of plants involved in mergers in year $t-1$ is 0.229. In addition, the coefficient and level of significance on the lagged instruments $\\mathrm{M}\\&\\mathrm{A}_{t-k}$ generally increases as the timing of the instrument moves closer to the current year, indicating that more recent M&As have a larger impact on changes in local-level employment concentration.The $F$ -statistic for testing the relevance of the set of instruments is 53.79, well over the usual threshold value of ten (for example, Staiger andStock 1997).  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"10\">10% Market Share Threshold County 5% Market Share Threshold</td><td rowspan=\"10\">Emp.

The estimates in Panel A thus show that lagged M&A volumes are highly relevant and robust instruments for changes in local employment concentration.  \n\nPanel B of Table 7 displays results from estimating the second-stage regression in Equation 4 using the instrumented values of $\\Delta\\mathrm{logHHI}_{j c t-5\\rightarrow t}$ . In Column 1, the coefficient on the instrumented change in $\\mathrm{log(HHI)}$ is $-0.047$ , significant at the 5 percent level. Thus, consistent with the hypothesis that labor market monopsony power detrimentally affects wages, the estimate shows that an increase in the degree of local-level employer concentration, driven by mergers of existing firms in the market, is associated with a reduction in average wages. Column 2, which uses the log number of employees affected by mergers as the instrument, shows a similar effect. The IV-based elasticity is -0.041, compared with baseline OLS elasticities of -0.009 to $-0.010$ in Table 2. The rest of the columns in the table report similar results using commuting zones to define the local labor markets (Columns 3 and 4) or using a 10 percent threshold for the combined employment share of both the acquiring and target firms in the local labor market (Columns 5-8). Using commuting zones to define local-level HHI, the reported elasticities imply that moving from one standard deviation below to one standard deviation above the mean-level HHI is associated with a reduction in wages between 9.1 percent and 14.4 percent.  \n\n### D.Subsample Periods  \n\nWe next investigate how the relation between wages and employer concentration evolves over the sample period. To this end, we divide the full sample for 1978-2016 into four subperiods and on each period rerun the wage regressions in Equation 1, which include the local-level HHI measure of employer concentration as the key independent variable (Table 8).25 As shown in Panel A of Table 8, the coefficients on the HHI measure of employer concentration——-defined at the three-digit SIC and county level—- monotonically decline, becoming more negative over time, implying an increased elasticity of wages to local labor market concentration over the sample period. In the first subsample, covering 1978-1987, the coefficient on $\\mathrm{log(HHI)}$ is zero. However, this coefficient declines to $-0.009$ in 1988-1997, $-0.015$ in 1998-2007, and in the final subsample of 2008-2016, the c0efficient is $-0.020$ . In the last column of the table, we estimate Equation 1 separately for the crisis period of 2008-2010 and find a similar magnitude of $-0.020$ . In Panel B of Table 8, we use commuting zones rather than counties to compute local-level employer concentration. The results that are based on commuting zones exhibit a similar pattern to that found in Panel A—the sensitivity of wages to local labor market concentration increases over time. In 1978-1987, the coefficient on $\\mathrm{log(HHI)}$ is $-0.001$ and insignificant. This coefficient declines to $-0.011$ in 1988-1997, $-0.014$ in 1998-2007, and to $-0.018$ in the final subsample of 2008-2016.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>2008-2010 2008-2016 Dep. Var.: Log Avg.

The effect of local labor market monopsony hinges to a large extent on limits to labor mobility across markets (for a review, see Boal and Ransom 1997). Thus, to the extent that workers have become less mobile in the United States over the past decades, employer concentration at the local level is more likely to restrict workers’ employment choice-set, explaining a rising sensitivity between wages and employer concentration over the sample period. An additional mechanism potentially explaining the rise in the sensitivity of wages to employer concentration is the secular decline in employee bargaining power stemming from the decline in unionization rates beginning in the 1970s (see, for example, Card 1992). We turn to this mechanism next.26  \n\n### E. Employer Concentration, Unions, and Wages  \n\nWhile employer concentration may enable firms to pay lower wages, unionization strengthens labor's bargaining position and may enable employees to diminish employers′ monopsony power. We next empirically test whether unionization mitigates the ability of firms to reduce wages in concentrated markets. To do so, we interact our local measure of employer concentration with the degree of unionization at the industry level, employing the following regression specification:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\log(a\\nu g.w a g e s)_{p f j t}=\\upbeta_{0}+\\upbeta_{1}{\\log(\\mathrm{HHI})}_{j c t-1}+\\upbeta_{2}{\\log(\\mathrm{HHI})}_{j c t-1}\\times U n i o n_{j t-1}}\\ {+\\upbeta_{3}U n i o n_{j t-1}+\\upbeta_{4}\\mathbf{X}_{p f j t}+\\upbeta_{5}\\mathbf{Z}_{j c t-1}+\\updelta_{j t}+\\upmu_{f t}+\\upvarepsilon_{p f j t},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $U n i o n_{j t-1}$ is the one-year lagged union coverage rate for industry $j$ associated with plant $i$ . and all other variables as defined in Equation 1. Union coverage rates are from the CPS ORG data as explained in Section II.A.3. The main coefficient of interest in this regression is $\\upbeta_{2}$ .which measures the degree to which unionization rates affect the sensitivity of wages to employer concentration.  \n\nTable 9 presents estimates of Equation 5 using plant-level data for 1978-2016.27 Column 1 of Panel A shows that, as in Table 2, controlling for year, industry, and firm fixed effects and employing plant-level and county-industry-level controls, average workers’ wages at manufacturing plants are lower when the local labor market (defined at the county level) is more concentrated in a given three-digit SIC industry. Importantly, the coefficient on the interaction term between local employer concentration and the union coverage rate is positive. Consistent with the hypothesis, the negative relation between employer concentration and wages is thus mitigated among plants that operate in industries with higher unionization rates. Based on the estimates, in industries with unionization rates near zero, the elasticity between wages and local-level HHI is approximately $-0.016$ , while in contrast, at the average unionization rate (19.8 percent), the elasticity between wages and local-level labor market concentration wages declines by between 29 percent and 44 percent, depending on the specification. For example, the regression estimates in Column 1 imply that at a zero unionization rate the elasticity of wages to employer concentration is $-0.017$ , while for industries at the mean unionization rate the elasticity is approximately $-0.010$ . Based on these elasticities, in industries with near zero unionization, moving from one standard deviation below to one standard deviation above the mean level of HHI is associated with a 2.7 percent reduction in wages, while for firms at the average level of unionization the same HHI movement reduces wages by only 1.6 percent.  \n\nColumn 2 includes industry-by-year and firm-by-year fixed effects and exhibits results consistent with those in Column 1—the negative relation between employer concentration and wages is mitigated by high unionization rates at the industry level. In terms of economic magnitude, estimates in Column 2 indicate that a one standard deviation increase in unionization rates from their average reduces the elasticity of wages to HHI by approximately half, from $-0.009$ to $-0.005$ . In Columns 3 and 4 we repeat the analysis of the first two columns using HHI measures that are calculated at the county and four-digit industry levels and find similar results. In the last four columns of Table 9 we repeat the analysis in Columns 1-4 using commuting zones to define local labor markets. The results based on commuting zones are similar to those found using counties, with labor unions reducing the elasticity of wages to employer concentration. The results are thus consistent with unions providing bargaining power to workers in wage negotiations, mitigating a negative effect of local labor market concentration on wages.  \n\n### F. Employer Concentration and Rent Sharing  \n\nThe analysis thus far has focused on the relation between employer concentration and wages in local labor markets. In addition to wage levels, concentration of employers may also affect the transmission of productivity growth into wage changes. Standard economic theory would suggest that in competitive or near-competitive labor markets increases in labor productivity should translate into increased wages, with workers paid their marginal product. Empirical evidence has provided general support for a link between productivity and wage growth (see, for example, Stansbury and Summers 2017), although this link appears to have declined since the early 1980s (see, for example, Mishel 2012; Bivens and Mishel 2015). Following these results, we hypothesize that labor market employer concentration impedes the translation of productivity growth to wage increases, as employers use their monopsony power to avoid wage hikes, thereby capturing rents from increased productivity.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"10\">Dep.

To fix ideas, we provide a short theoretical analysis within a classic monopsony and Cournot-oligopsony framework. Clearly, alternative frameworks exist modeling monopsonistic labor market competition—for example, search-based models—and in these, the conditions governing the relation between productivity and wages may be quite different than those derived here. As such, the empirical results in this section should be viewed as placing additional discipline on the various theoretical frameworks employed in the monopsony literature.  \n\nBeginning with the case of a monopsonist facing a constant marginal product of labor $A$ , and assuming a labor supply function $L(w)$ , the well-known first order condition is:  \n\n$$\nA=w^{*}\\left[1+\\frac{1}{\\mathfrak{E}^{L}(w^{*})}\\right],\n$$  \n\nwith $\\varepsilon^{L}(w)$ the elasticity of labor supply and $w^{*}$ the optimal monopsonist-set real wage. We show in Appendix 2 that this first-order condition implies that if labor supply elasticity is decreasing in wage—-that is, $\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon^{L}/\\mathrm{d}w<0$ then the elasticity of the wage with respect to productivity is smaller than unity. That is, when labor supply elasticity is declining with wages-an empirically reasonable assumptionthe elasticity of wages to productivity is smaller in the monopsonist case than in the case of a perfectly competitive labor market.28  \n\nThis result is intuitive. From Equation 6, the monopsonist pays a fraction (less than one) of productivity, but when the elasticity of labor supply is decreasing in wages, this fraction declines as productivity rises. The elasticity of wages to productivity is thus smaller than unity. (Alternatively, rearranging Equation 6 in the classic manner as $(A-w^{*})/w^{*}=1/\\varepsilon^{\\bar{L}}(w^{*})$ , with the left-hand side of the equation being the well-known \"rate of exploitation,” we see that a declining labor supply elasticity implies that the rate of exploitation increases in the productivity level $A$ 一  \n\nTurning to a Cournot-oligopsony setting, consider $N$ firms competing for labor: firm $i$ chooses to employ labor $l_{i}$ while facing the wage function $w(L)$ ,with $L=\\sum_{k}l_{k}$ . In a symmetric Nash Equilibrium, the equilibrium wage $w^{*}$ satisfies:  \n\n$$\nA=w^{*}\\left[1+\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{N}\\varepsilon^{L}(w^{*})}\\right],\n$$  \n\nwith $\\varepsilon^{L}(w)$ the elasticity of the labor supply function $L(w)$ , equal to the inverse of the wage function $w(L)$ , defined above.29  \n\nBased on Equation 7, we show in the appendix that when $\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon^{L}/\\mathrm{d}w<0$ , as the number of competing firms increases, the elasticity of the equilibrium wage to productivity converges from below to unity:  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{lim}_{N\\to\\infty}\\varepsilon_{N}^{w^{*}}(A)=1{\\mathrm{~and~}}\\varepsilon_{N}^{w^{*}}(A)<1,\n$$  \n\nwith $\\mathfrak{E}_{N}^{w^{*}}(A)$ the elasticity of the equilibrium wage to productivity when $N$ firms compete in the labor market. Thus, with declining labor elasticity, as the number of competing firms rises, the pass-through of productivity to wages rises from the monopsonist-level elasticity—which, as shown above, is less than one—to the perfectly competitive elasticity (which equals one). This convergence need not be monotonic in the number of competing firms, $N$ , but by definition of convergence, for any level of elasticity $\\varepsilon^{*}<1$ ， there exists a threshold number of firms $N^{*}$ , such that if the number of firms competing in the labor market is above $N^{*}$ , the elasticity of wages to productivity is above $\\varepsilon^{*}$  \n\nIn sum, within a Cournot-oligopsony framework, a key condition for the pass-through of productivity to wages to exhibit an increasing trend with the level of competition, is that the elasticity of labor supply declines with wages. Clearly, conditions governing the relation between labor market competition and productivity-to-wage pass-through rates may be quite different within alternative modeling frameworks of nonperfectly competitive labor markets. As stated above, we view the empirical results in this section on the relation between labor market concentration and productivity-to-wages passthrough rates as placing discipline on these theoretical frameworks.  \n\nTo empirically test whether the sensitivity of wage growth to productivity growth is affected by local-level employer concentration, we use the following first-differences interaction specification:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\Delta\\log(a\\nu g.~w a g e s)_{p f t}=\\upbeta_{0}+\\upbeta_{1}\\log(\\mathrm{HHI})_{j c t-1}+\\upbeta_{2}\\Delta\\log(l a b o r~p r o d u c t i\\nu i t y)_{p f j t}}\\ &{\\qquad+\\upbeta_{3}\\log(\\mathrm{HHI})_{j c t-1}\\times\\Delta\\log(l a b o r~p r o d u c t i\\nu i t y)_{p f j t}}\\ &{\\qquad+\\upbeta_{4}\\mathbf{X}_{p f j t}+\\upbeta_{5}\\mathbf{Z}_{j c t-1}+\\updelta_{j t}+\\upmu_{f t}+\\upvarepsilon_{p f j t},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\Delta\\mathrm{log}(a\\nu g.w a g e s)_{p f j t}$ is the log change in average plant wages for production workers and $\\Delta\\mathrm{log}(l a b o r p r o d u c t i v i t y)_{p f j t}$ is the log change in labor productivity in plant $p$ , industry $j$ ,county $c$ , and year $t$ . All control variables are defined as in Equation 1, while $\\updelta_{j t}$ is a vector of industry-by-year fixed effects, and $\\upmu_{f t}$ is a vector of firm-by-year fixed effects. We focus on production workers in this specification since their compensation is potentially more sensitive to productivity due to rent sharing (for example, Freeman and Medoff 1981).  \n\nTable 10 reports estimation results. Across columns in Table 10, the coefficient on log(labor productivity) is positive and significant at the 1 percent level, confirming a positive association between wage growth and productivity growth at the plant level (see, for example, Stansbury and Summers 2017). Importantly, consistent with our prediction regarding the role of monopsony power in labor markets, the coefficient on the interaction term $\\log(\\mathrm{HHI})\\times\\Delta\\log($ (labor productivity) is negative and significant at the 1 percent level. Estimates in Column 2, which controls for both industry-by-year and firm-by-year fixed effects, imply that a one standard deviation decrease in HHI from its mean increases the elasticity of production worker wages to productivity by approximately 8.5 percent, from 0.115 to 0.125. Alternatively, estimates in Columns 4-8, which employ the commuting zone classification to define local-level employer concentration, imply that a one standard deviation decrease in HHI from its mean, increases the elasticity of production worker wages to productivity by between 11.2 percent and 18 percent. Consistent with our prediction, therefore, when labor markets are more competitive, productivity increases are associated with larger increases in wages, as employers compete for workers. In contrast, higher levels of employer concentration impede the translation of productivity growth into wage growth.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"9\">Dep. Var.: △log Avg.

For example, Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013) and Autor et al. (2014) find that local labor markets more exposed to import penetration from China exhibit higher unemployment, lower labor-force participation, and reduced wages. In this subsection, we add to the literature on the China shock and the labor market effects of increased globalization by investigating the effect of import penetration from China on local labor market concentration. We hypothesize that by causing employers to shut down a fraction of their operations, increased import competition from China may have led to an increase in local labor market concentration. Thus, we argue that in addition to labor displacement and an associated decline in wages due to reduced labor demand, increased import competition from China may have an additional effect of reducing wages of nondisplaced workers due to an increase in employerconcentration.  \n\nWe construct an industry-by-year measure of import exposure per worker from China to the United States equal to the industry-level dollar value of imports scaled by total employment in the industry in a given year.3° Specifically, we define import exposure from China as: China $E x p o s u r e_{j,t}=\\frac{I m p o r t s f r o m C h i n a_{j,t}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}E m p l o y m e n t_{i,j,t}}$ Imports from Chinajt ,in which Imports from $C h i n a_{j,t}$ represents the dollar value of imports from China to the United States in industry $j$ and year $t$ andEmploymen $t_{i,j,t}$ represents employment in plant $i$ operating in industry $j$ and year t. We limit our analysis to plant-years in 1992-2008, given that China import penetration data are available for 1991-2007 and that we use lagged China exposure as an independent variable.  \n\nWe first adjust our main empirical specification in Equation 1 by including China Exposure as an additional control. Table 11 presents the results and shows that the coefficient on China Exposure, measured at the three-digit SIC level, is negative and significant at the 1 percent level, consistent with existing research documenting negative  \n\nTable11 China Import Penetration, Local Employer Concentration, and Wages   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"4\"></td><td colspan=\"4\">Dep.

The table uses three-digit SIC industries to compute HHI, China exposure, log(employment), and log(plants per segment). The dependent variable is log(HHI) as defined in Table 1. t-statistics based on standard errors adjusted for sample clustering at the county level are reported below the coefficient estimates. The numbers of observations are rounded to the nearest thousand to follow the U.S. Census Bureau's disclosure rules.  \n\nWe next turn to analyzing the effect of the China shock on labor market concentration. Given the disruptions to the manufacturing sector documented in Autor et al. (2013, 2014), we hypothesize that increased exposure to competition from China should increase local-level employer concentration. As such, we are interested herein in a determinant of labor market concentration, in contrast to the results in prior sections dealing with the effects of such concentration.  \n\nTo analyze how the China shock relates to employer concentration, we run the following specification, regressing the local-level HHI employer concentration measure on our measure of exposure to competition from China:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\log(\\mathrm{HHI})_{j c t}=\\upbeta_{0}+\\upbeta_{1}C h i n a E x p o s u r e_{j t}+\\upbeta_{2}\\mathbf{X}_{p f j t}+\\upbeta_{3}\\mathbf{Z}_{j c t-1}+\\updelta_{j t}+\\upmu_{f t}+\\upvarepsilon_{p f j t},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$\\mathrm{log(HHI}_{j c t})$ is log local-level employer concentration in county or commuting zone $c$ and industry $j$ measured at either the three- or four-digit SIC level; China Exposurejt is defined as the total value of imports from China to the United States scaled by total employment for industry $j$ in year $t$ ; and all other variables are defined as in Equation 1.  \n\nTable 12 presents the results of estimating Equation 10. Across the columns, we find that the coefficient on exposure to Chinese imports is significantly positive at the 1 percent to 5 percent level, suggesting that industry-level import competition is indeed associated with increased concentration of employers in the local labor market. In terms of economic magnitude, estimates in Column 3, which uses three-digit SIC codes and commuting zones, suggest that a one standard deviation increase in Chinese import competition leads to a 0.035 $(=3.980\\times0.009)$ point increase in $\\mathrm{log(HHI)}$  \n\nAfter confirming our hypothesis that increased import competition from China is associated with higher local employer concentration, it is natural to hypothesize that such exposure to Chinese imports will have an indirect effect on wages through increased local-level labor market concentration. According to this, increased exposure to import competition from China increases employer concentration, thereby reducing wages. However, given that exposure to China affects wages directly (as shown in Autor et al. 2013, 2014), using import penetration from China as an instrument for employer concentration does not meet the exclusion restriction. Hence, it is empirically challenging to disentangle the indirect effect from the direct effect of exposure to Chinese import competition on wages.  \n\n## IV. Conclusion  \n\nWe use manufacturing plant-level data from the U.S. Census Bureau for 1978-2016 to provide evidence that wages are lower in local labor markets in which employers are more concentrated. We provide evidence relating local-level employer concentration to wages along a host of margins. Exploiting merger activity as an instrument for local-level concentration in labor markets, we show that wages decline following increases in local-level employer concentration. Further, the negative relation between employer concentration and wages increases over time and is particularly strong when labor unionization rates are low. Thus, in the presence of concentrated labor markets, unionization may mitigate monopsony power in labor markets by increasing workers’ bargaining positions in wage determination processes. In addition, we show that higher employer concentration impairs the transmission of productivity growth into wage increases. As such, the results suggest that weak bargaining power reduces the ability of workers to benefit from productivity growth. Finally, we analyze one particular determinant of local labor market concentration, showing that increased exposure to competition from China led to higher concentration of employers. Taken as a whole, the results underscore the importance of analyzing market power within labor markets and relative employer-employee bargaining positions as important determinants of wage-setting behavior.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"11\">County SIC3</td><td>SIC4 @</td><td>-0.013 -4.20 0.030 30.19 0.064 -0.006 30.92 -4.07</td></tr><tr><td>SIC4 E SIC3</td><td>-0.013 -4.26 0.030 32.61 0.067 -0.006 35.83 4.51 -0.007</td></tr><tr><td>-0.011 0.031 0.069 -3.59 29.03</td><td>34.84 -0.007 0.307 -4.59</td></tr><tr><td>SIC3 -0.011 -3.50 0.032 G</td><td>0.072 40.56 -0.006 -0.008 0.298 31.72 -4.43 -4.66 31.17</td></tr><tr><td>SIC4 SIC4 ?</td><td>-0.013 4.65 0.030 35.16 0.064 36.74 -0.007 0.280 -4.73</td></tr><tr><td>-0.014 4.50 0.030 0.068 36.82</td><td>43.24 0.006 4.88 -0.006 -4.57 0.271 30.93</td></tr><tr><td>SIC3 -0.011 0.031 -3.69</td><td>32.36 0.070 41.61 -0.008 0.290 -5.33</td></tr><tr><td>-0.012 -3.57 0.032 34.83</td><td>0.073 48.46 -0.007 -5.14 0.007 -4.63 0.280 31.32</td></tr><tr><td>log(HHI, ind-local-year), [t] log(emp, ind-local-year), []</td><td>log(plants per segment) log(labor productivity) log(plants per firm) plant age (/100)</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"11\"> Dep.

The well-known wagesetting first-order condition is:  \n\n$$\nA=w^{*}\\left[1+\\frac{1}{\\mathfrak{c}^{L}(w^{*})}\\right],\n$$  \n\nwith $\\varepsilon^{L}(w)$ the elasticity of labor supply and $w^{*}$ the optimal real wage. Treating Equation A1 as defining an implicit function between $A$ and $w^{*}$ , the elasticity of $A$ with respect to $w^{*}$ $\\mathfrak{E}^{A}(w^{*})$ , can be calculated to be:  \n\n$$\n\\varepsilon^{A}(w^{*})=1-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon^{L}(w^{*})}{\\mathrm{d}w}\\times\\frac{w^{*}}{\\varepsilon^{L}(w^{*})[1+\\varepsilon^{L}(w^{*})]}.\n$$  \n\nFrom Equation A2 we have that $\\mathfrak{E}^{A}(w^{*})>1$ when the elasticity of labor supply is declining with wage - that is, when $\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon^{L}/\\mathrm{d}w<0$ Denoting $\\operatorname{\\varepsilon}^{w^{*}}(A)$ tobe the elasticity of $w^{*}$ with respect to $A$ , and noting that this elasticity is the reciprocal of the elasticity of $A$ with respect to $w^{*}$ , we have that $\\varepsilon^{w^{*}}(A)<1$ when $\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon^{L}/\\mathrm{d}w<\\stackrel{\\star}{0}$ . That is, when labor supply elasticity is declining with wages the elasticity of wages to productivity is smaller in the monopsonist case than in the case of a perfectly competitive labor market.  \n\nTurning to a Cournot-oligopsony setting, consider $N$ firms competing for labor: firm i chooses to employ labor $l_{i}$ while facing the wage function $w(L)$ , with $L=\\sum_{k}l_{k}$ . Denote the labor supply curve—that is, the inverse of the wage function $w(L)-$ as $L(w)$ .To maintain a well-defined game and for expositional simplicity assume that the elasticity of labor supply with respect to the wage is bounded away from zero. It is easy to show then that in a symmetric Nash Equilibrium, the equilibrium wage $w^{*}$ satisfies:  \n\n$$\nA=w^{*}\\left[1+\\frac{1}{N\\varepsilon^{L}(w^{*})}\\right],\n$$  \n\nwith $\\varepsilon^{L}(w)$ the elasticity of labor supply function. As above, treating Equation A3 as defining an implicit function between $A$ and the optimal wage $w^{*}$ ,the elasticity of $\\mathrm{\\Delta}A$ with respect to $w^{*}$ when $N$ firms compete in the market can be calculated to be:  \n\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{N}^{A}(w^{*})=1-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon^{L}(w^{*})}{\\mathrm{d}w}\\times\\frac{w^{*}}{\\varepsilon^{L}(w^{*})[1+N\\varepsilon^{L}(w^{*})]}.\n$$  \n\nDefining $\\varepsilon_{N}^{w*}(A)$ to be the elasticity of $w^{*}$ with respect to $A$ (with $N$ competing firms), by an analogous argument to the monopsonist case above, we have that if $\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon^{L}/\\mathrm{d}w$ is negative, then $\\mathfrak{E}_{N}^{w^{*}}(A)<1$ for all $N.$ To show that $\\operatorname*{lim}_{N\\to\\infty}\\mathfrak{x}_{N}^{w^{*}}(A)=1.$ Note first that Equation A3 and the assumption that the elasticity is bounded away from zero implies that $\\operatorname*{lim}_{N\\to\\infty}w^{*}(N)=A$ with $w^{*}(N)$ the wage under the symmetric Nash Equilibrium with $N$ firms. The result that $\\operatorname*{lim}_{N\\rightarrow\\infty}\\mathfrak{\\varepsilon}_{N}^{w^{*}}(A)=1$ stems then directly from Equation A4, the assumption that the elasticity of labor supply is bounded away from zero, and the fact that $\\operatorname*{lim}_{N\\to\\infty}w^{*}(N)=A$  \n\n## References  \n\nAbel, Will, Silvana Tenreyro, and Gregory Thwaites. 2018. “Monopsony in the UK.\" Unpublished.   \nAutor, David H., David Dorn, and Gordon H.

TOWNSEND\\*  \n\n# ABSTRACT  \n\nWe show that venture capitalists’ (VCs) on-site involvement with their portfolio companies leads to an increase in (1) innovation and (2) the likelihood of a successful exit. We rule out selection effects by exploiting an exogenous source of variation in VC involvement: the introduction of new airline routes that reduce VCs’ travel times to their ecisting portfolio companies. We confirm the importance of this channel by conducting a large-scale survey of VCs, of whom almost 90% indicate that direct fights increase their interaction with their portfolio companies and management, and help them better understand companies' activities.  \n\nIt is often argued that venture capital (VC) plays an important role in promoting innovation and growth. Consistent with this belief, governments around the world have pursued a number of policies aimed at fostering VC activity (Lerner, 2009). However, there remains scarce evidence that the activities of venture capitalists actually play a causal role in stimulating the creation of innovative and successful companies. Indeed, VCs may simply select companies that are poised to innovate and succeed, even absent their involvement. In this paper, we examine whether the activities of VCs do affect portfolio company outcomes.  \n\nAn ideal experiment to establish the impact of VCs would be to randomly provide certain companies with VC funding and others not. Such an experiment would eliminate the selection of companies (\\*screening\"), thus allowing us to estimate the effect of VC involvement (\\*monitoring\").1 Unfortunately, it is quite difficult to find a setting that convincingly approximates this experiment. That being said, another useful experiment would be to instead randomly vary VC involvement after initial investments are made. This would allow us to identify the effect of VC involvement, holding company selection fixed. In particular, if diferences in outcomes for VC-backed companies are driven purely by selection, post-investment involvement of the VCs should have no effect. In this paper, we attempt to approximate this second experiment.  \n\nThe source of exogenous variation in VC involvement that we exploit is the introduction of new airline routes that reduce the travel time between VC firms and their existing portfolio companies. Previous work suggests that travel time reductions lower monitoring costs for firms with headquarters that are geographically separated from their production facilities (Giroud, 2013). If VC activities do matter, reductions in the cost of monitoring should translate into better portfolio company performance by allowing VCs to engage in more of these activities.  \n\nTo obtain direct evidence on whether VC involvement increases following reductions in travel time, we conduct a large-scale survey of VC investors. Almost 90% of the 306 survey participants agreed that they would visit a portfolio company more frequently following the introduction of a direct flight. Survey participants also agreed that the introduction of a direct Hight would help them Kaplan and Stromberg 2001) review the screening and monitoring roles of VCs, and emphasize the dificultyof disentangling them.  \n\nestablish better relationships with management teams, better understand the state of their companies, and generally add more value. This qualitative evidence supports our underlying assumption that VC involvement is responsive to the introduction of direct fights, and is consistent with the academic literature that shows that VC activity is sensitive to geographic proximity.2  \n\nWe then explore how the introduction of new airline routes that reduce the travel time between VCs and their portfolio companies affect company-level outcomes. The primary outcomes we examine are the quantity and quality of innovation (as measured by the patent count and citations per patent, respectively), as well as success (as measured by exit via IPO or acquisition). Using a difference-in-differences estimation framework, we find that the introduction of a new airline route leads to a $3.1\\%$ increase in the number of patents the portfolio company produces and a 5.8% increase in the number of citations per patent it receives. Furthermore, the treatment increases the probability of going public by 1.0%, and of having a successful exit (via IPO or acquisition) by $1.4\\%$ . These results indicate that VC involvement is an important determinant of innovation and success.  \n\nA natural concern is that local shocks, in the region of either the VC or the portfolio company, could be driving the results. For example, a booming local economy may lead to both increased innovation and the introduction of a new airline route. In this case, we may estimate a spurious positive effect of travel time reductions on innovation. However, since our treatment is defined at the VC-company pair level, we can control for such local shocks. Specifically, we include two full sets of MSA (Metropolitan Statistical Area) by year fixed effects for the MSAs of both the VC and the portfolio company. Moreover, we find that pre-existing trends are not driving our results, and the results are robust to considering only new airline routes that are the outcome of a merger between two airlines or the opening of a new hub. Such treatments are likely to be even more exogenous to any given VC-company pair.  \n\nWe provide further evidence on the underlying channel through which these effects operate by taking advantage of the fact that certain VCs should be more sensitive to changes in monitoring costs than others. Specifically, VCs often syndicate their investments, and when this occurs, one typically takes the role of the lead investor. The lead investor is generally more actively involved in the monitoring of the portfolio company, while others act more as passive providers of capital (Gorman and Sahlman, 1989). Given that lead VCs play a greater role in monitoring, their monitoring effort should be more sensitive to reductions in monitoring costs, as should portfolio company performance. Indeed, we find that our results are driven primarily by reductions in travel time for lead VCs rather than other members of the investment syndicate.  \n\nOur paper contributes to a growing literature that studies the effect of VCs on portfolio company outcomes. Much of this literature tries to disentangle VC monitoring from screening by comparing outcomes of VC-backed and non-VC-backed companies (e.g., Hellmann and Puri, 2000; Chemmanur et al., 201la; Hellmann and Puri, 2002; Puri and Zarutskie, 2012). These papers are valuable given the scarcity of data on young companies that are not affliated with a VC. However, even if both groups of companies are matched on the basis of observables, it is quite plausible that VCs select companies with higher potential ex ante—an inherently unobservable characteristic. In contrast, our setting allows us to identify the effect of VC monitoring holding selection fixed, because we exploit exogenous reductions in monitoring costs after initial investments are made. Other papers rely on structural modeling. In particular, Sorensen (2007) models the two-sided matching process of VCs and entrepreneurs to structurally estimate the relative importance of VC monitoring and screening as explanations for why companies backed by more experienced VCs outperform. Relatedly, Kortum and Lerner (2000) structurally estimate industry-level patent production functions with corporate R&D and venture capital as inputs in order to compare their relative potency. Our paper differs from these in that it does not require any structural assumptions for identification.  \n\nOur paper also contributes to a large, mostly theoretical literature that explores how financial contracts shape the interaction between entrepreneurs and VC firms, alleviating moral hazard and agency problems. For example, several papers consider the optimal contractual arrangement that leads both entrepreneurs and VCs to contribute effort to promote a venture's success in a double moral hazard setting (e.g., Schmidt, 2003; Casamatta, 2003; Inderst and Mueller, 2004; Hellmann, 2006). Other theoretical work highlights the importance of contractual arrangements on the VC refinancing versus termination decision (e.g., Repullo and Suarez, 2004; Dessi, 2005; Cornelli and Yosha, 2003), as well as the effective allocation of control (e.g., Berglof, 1994; Cestone, 2014). Kaplan and Stromberg (2003; 2004) provide empirical evidence on such contractual arrangements.3 Our paper complements this literature by highlighting the role of geographic proximity, in addition to contracts, in shaping the interactions between entrepreneurs and VC frms.  \n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section I discusses the data and key variables. Section II discusses our empirical strategy. Section IHI presents the survey. Section IV presents the results, and Section V concludes.  \n\n## I. Data  \n\n### A. Data Sources and Sample Selection  \n\nWe obtain data on venture-backed companies from the Thomson Reuters VentureXpert database (formerly called Venture Economics). VentureXpert, along with Dow Jones’ VentureSource (formerly VentureOne), are the two primary venture capital data sources available. Both have been validated by previous researchers against known financing rounds (Kaplan et al., 2002). We choose to use VentureXpert because VentureSource starts later and is less comprehensive in earlier years, when many new airline routes were introduced. VentureXpert began compiling data in 1977. It contains detailed information about the dates of venture financing rounds, the investors and portfolio companies involved, the estimated amounts invested by each party, and the ultimate portfolio company outcome. The database also contains detailed information on the location of each VC firm and portfolio company. It should be noted that one shortcoming of these data for our purposes is that VentureXpert only associates a VC frm with a single location (its main office). However, some of the larger VC firms operate out of multiple offices. While ideally we would observe all of these offices, this should not present a systematic source of bias.4 Similarly, we only observe one headquarter location per portfolio company, despite the fact that portfolio companies can potentially move. The location we observe represents the company's latest known address. Again, this should not present a systematic source of bias. We limit the sample to U.S.-based portfolio companies coded as being in a venture stage (seed, early, expansion, or later stage) in their first observed financing round. For our baseline analysis, we further restrict the sample to only VC-company pairs involving the lead investor, which will be defined in Section I.B.3. In subsequent analysis, we examine whether the results hold for non-lead investors as well.  \n\nTo measure the innovative output of portfolio companies, we combine VentureXpert with data from the NBER Patent Data Project (Hall et al., 2001). The NBER data cover all utility patents granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) from 1976 to 2006.5 Among other things, the data provide information on the date a patent was applied for and ultimately granted as well as its detailed technology class. If a patent was assigned to one or more companies (\"assignees\"), the data also provide information on assignee name(s)/location(s). We match the NBER data with VentureXpert using standardized company and location names along with the company's founding date and the date of the assignee's frst patent application. The details of the matching procedure are provided in Section II of the Internet Appendix. Finally, we also supplement the NBER data with citation data from Google patents in some cases so that we can observe citations in a three-year window following the grant date for all patents, including those at the end of the NBER sample in 2006.  \n\nData on airline routes are obtained from the T-100 Domestic Segment Database (for the period 1990 to 2006) and ER-586 Service Segment Data (for the period 1977 to 1989), which are compiled from Form 41 of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). All airlines operating fights in the U.S. are required by law to file Form 41 with the DOT and are subject to fines for misreporting.  \n\nStrictly speaking, the T-100 and ER-586 are not samples: they include all fights that have taken place between any two airports in the U.S. The T-100 and ER-586 contain monthly data for each airline and route (segment). The data include, for example, the origin and destination airports, fight duration (ramp-to-ramp time), scheduled departures, performed departures, enplaned passengers, and aircraft type.  \n\nAfter combining these three data sources, we are left with a sample of venture-backed companies that were active between 1977 (the beginning of the airline data) and 2006 (the end of the patent data). In total, we observe 22,986 companies, receiving funding from 3,158 lead VC frms. Table I shows the composition of the sample. Panel A shows the company region distribution broken down according to whether the company was ever treated or not (i.e., experienced a reduction in travel time to its lead VC). Similarly, Panel C shows the VC region distribution broken down according to whether the venture firm was ever part of a treatment or not. Perhaps the most striking finding from these tables is that, contrary to common perception, a significant amount of venture capital activity takes place outside of Northern California, New England, and New York. Indeed, approximately 50% of venture-backed companies and VC firms are located outside of these three regions. This is consistent with the findings of Chen et al. (2010). Overall, treated and untreated companies are distributed similarly across regions; however, as one might expect, treated companies are less likely to be located in Northern California. Similarly, Panel C shows that VCs that are part of a treatment are also less likely to be located in Northern California. Finally, Panel B shows that treated and untreated companies are also distributed similarly across industries, although treated companies are somewhat less likely to be in the Internet sector.  \n\nWhile Table I shows that both portfolio companies and VC frms are fairly dispersed geographically, it does not directly show whether it is common for VCs to invest in distant portfolio companies. If, to a first approximation, all VCs invested locally, we would not have sufficient power to identify an effect, since there would be few reductions in travel time due to new airline routes. Figure 1 provides some perspective on the distance between VCs and portfolio companies graphically. First, it shows the distribution of portfolio companies across states, depicting states with more companies in darker shades. More interestingly, the height of the bar over each state indicates the percentage of companies located in that state, which are funded by a lead VC from the same state. As can be seen, many states have a relatively low percentage of locally funded portfolio companies. Thus, airline routes could potentially be an important determinant of monitoring costs for many companies. To examine this issue more directly still, we plot the cumulative density function of the VC-company distance distribution in Figure 2. Consistent with what one might expect, we find that a large fraction of VC investments are local, with around 30% being located close to zero miles from their lead VC. However, the median distance between a portfolio company and its lead VC is approximately 200 miles and the 60th percentile is approximately 500 miles. Thus, around 40% of portfolio companies are located more than 500 miles from their lead VC. This both suggests that we will likely have enough power to identify an effect if one is present, and that the long-distance pairs that we use for identification are not particularly unusual.  \n\n### $B$ :Definitions of Variables  \n\n#### B.1. Treatment  \n\nTo estimate the effect of reductions in travel time on portfolio company outcomes, we define a treatment indicator variable equal to one if a new airline route is introduced that reduces the travel time between the VC firm and the portfolio company. Travel time is estimated as the time it would take to travel from the VC's ZIP code to the company's ZIP code using the optimal itinerary and means of transportation (car or airplane). The details of the algorithm used to compute optimal itineraries and travel times are described in Section IHI of the Internet Appendix. During our sample period (1977 to 2006), there are 1,131 treated VC-company pairs. The average travel time reduction is 126 minutes round-trip. Note, however, that this estimated reduction in travel time is likely a lower bound as it does not take into account the compounding probability of delays and cancellations when taking indirect fights. Moreover, a 126-minute travel time reduction could mean the difference between being able to fy back on the same day versus having to stay overnight.6  \n\n#### B.2. Innovation  \n\nWe use patent-based measures of the scale and quality of a company's innovation (Jaffe and Trajtenberg, 2002; Lanjouw et al., 1998). These measures have been widely adopted over the past two decades.7 Our primary measure of the scale of a company's innovation during a year is the number of (eventually granted) patents it applied for. Our primary measure of the quality of a company's innovation during a year is the number of citations it received per patent. Patent citations are important in patent filings since they serve as “property markers\"’ delineating the scope of the granted claims. Hall et al. (2005) illustrate that citations are a good measure of innovation quality and economic importance. Specifically, they find that an extra citation per patent boosts a firm's market value by 3%. Moreover, Kogan et al. (2012) show that the stock market reaction to patent approvals is a strong predictor of the number of future citations a patent receives.  \n\nOne challenge in measuring patent citations is that patents granted at the end of the sample period have less time to garner citations than those granted at the beginning. To address this issue, we only consider citations that occur during a three-year window following the date a patent is granted. In addition, we check that our results are robust to correcting for truncation using the estimated shape of the citation-lag distribution as in Hall et al. (2001). An additional consideration is that citation rates vary over time and across technologies. To ensure this does not affect our results, we also explore scaling each patent's citation count by the average citation count for patents granted in the same year and technology class. Finally, we take logs and add one to both the patent count and citation variables.  \n\n#### B.3. Other Variables  \n\nIn addition to innovation, we also measure success annually. We define company success in two ways. The frst is an indicator variable equal to one if the company went public during a given year. The second is an indicator variable equal to one if the company went public or was acquired. The issue with the second definition is that it may capture some acquisitions that were not positive outcomes. Specifically, an acquisition may be a sell-off that was not very profitable for the company's investors or founders. Indeed, Metrick and Yasuda (2011) find that first-round (second-round) investors do not even recover their invested capital in 38% (46%) of acquisitions. Unfortunately, due to data limitations, we cannot calculate gross value multiples analogously. Therefore, to ensure that we only count significant acquisitions as positive outcomes, we obtain acquisition values from SDC Platinum and CapitalIQ.8 We then include only acquisitions at values over \\$25M (in 2000 dollars) in our success measure.  \n\nFinally, as previously mentioned, in our baseline analysis, we limit the sample to only VCcompany pairs involving the lead investor. We focus on the lead investor because it is likely to be the one most involved in monitoring. Following Gompers (1996), we define the lead investor as the one that has invested in the company the longest.9 This is also consistent with Gorman and Sahlman's (1989) finding that the venture firm originating the investment is usually the frm that acquires a board seat first and has the most input into the decisions of the company, even though it might not end up ultimately owning the largest equity stake. Our results are also robust to other commonly used definitions of the lead investor, such as the investor that invested the most in a given round.  \n\n## II. Methodology  \n\nNew airline routes that reduce the travel time between VC firms and their portfolio companies make it easier for VCs to spend time at their portfolio companies.10 If VC activities do matter, such reduction in travel time should translate into better portfolio company performance by allowing VCs to engage in more of these activities. To estimate the effect of the introduction of new airline routes (\"treatments\") on company outcomes, we adopt a difference-in-differences methodology similar to Giroud (2013). Specifically, we estimate the following regression:  \n\n$$\ny_{i j t}=\\beta\\times t r e a t m e n t_{i j t}+\\gamma^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X_{ijt}}+\\alpha_{i j}+\\alpha_{M S A(i)}\\times\\alpha_{t}+\\alpha_{M S A(j)}\\times\\alpha_{t}+\\epsilon_{i j t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $i$ indexes portfolio companies, $j$ indexes VC frms, $t$ indexes years, $M S A(i)$ indexes the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in which portfolio company $i$ is located, and $M S A(j)$ indexes the MSA in which VC $j$ is located; $y$ is the dependent variable of interest (e.g., number of patents, citations per patent, IPO), treatment is an indicator variable (\"treatment indicator\") that equals one if a new airline route that reduces the travel time between company $i$ 's ZIP code and VC $j$ 's ZIP code has been introduced by year $t$ .， $\\mathbf{X}$ is the vector of control variables, which includes company age (the number of days since the first round of financing) and company stage of development (a set of indicator variables for the 8-point stage classification used by VentureXpert); $\\alpha_{i j}$ are VC-company pair fixed effects; $\\alpha_{M S A(i)}\\times\\alpha_{t}$ and $\\alpha_{M S A(j)}\\times\\alpha_{t}$ are MSA by year fixed effects with respect to company $\\imath$ 's MSA and VC $j$ 's MSA, respectively; $\\epsilon$ is the error term. This methodology fully controls for fixed differences between treated and non-treated VC-company pairs via the inclusion of pair fixed effects. The inclusion of MSA by year fixed effects further accounts for local shocks that may correlate with the introduction of new airline routes. To allow for serial dependence of the error terms, we cluster standard errors at the portfolio company level. The coeffcient of interest is $\\beta$ which measures the effect of the introduction of new airline routes on $y$  \n\nOur identification strategy can be illustrated with a simple example. From 1986 to 1994, Anesta Corporation, a biopharmaceutical company located in Salt Lake City, UT, was receiving VC funding from Flagship Ventures, a VC firm in Cambridge, MA. Until 1988, the fastest way to travel between Boston Logan Airport (BOS) and Salt Lake City International Airport (SLC) was an indirect fight operated by Delta Airlines with one stopover at Chicago O'Hare (ORD). In 1988, Delta introduced a direct fight between BOS and SLC, which substantially reduced the travel time between the two locations. To measure how this “treatment\" affects, for example, the number of patents filed by Anesta, one could compute the difference in the number of patents before and after 1988. However, other events may have occurred around 1988, which may also have affected patenting. To account for this possibility, we use a control group that consists of all VC-company pairs that have not been treated by 1988. We then compare the difference in the number of patents at Anesta before and after 1988 with the difference in the number of patents at the control companies before and after 1988. The difference between these two differences is the estimated effect of the treatment on patenting at Anesta.  \n\n### $A$ Local Shocks  \n\nIncluding a control group accounts for the possibility of economy-wide shocks that are contemporaneous with the introduction of the new airline routes. However, since a treatment is defined at the VC-company level, we can tighten the identification by also controlling for local shocks in the portfolio company's MSA, thereby separating out the effect of the new airline routes from the effect of contemporaneous local shocks. For example, Systemed Inc. is another biopharmaceutical company located in Salt Lake City. Around 1988, Systemed was receiving VC funding from Summit Capital Associates, a New York-based VC. (Direct fights between New York's John F. Kennedy Airport and SLC were offered in each year during our sample.) If patenting at Systemed also increases around 1988, then an increase in patenting at Anesta might not be due to the new airline route between BOS and SLC, but rather due to a contemporaneous local shock that affects patenting in the Salt Lake City MSA. In Equation (1), we control for such local shocks by including the full set of MSA fixed effects (pertaining to the portfolio company's location) interacted with year fixed efets $(\\alpha_{M S A(i)}\\times\\alpha_{t})$  \n\nIn addition, since a treatment is defined at the VC-company level, we can make the identification even tighter by also controlling for shocks at the location of the VC firm. In the above example, suppose there is a local shock that affects patenting in Boston in 1988. This local shock may affect Flagship Ventures, the Cambridge VC financing Anesta, and in turn Anesta's ability to innovate. In this case, however, patenting should also increase in the Boston area. In Equation (1), we control for such local shocks by including MSA fixed effects (pertaining to the VC's location) interacted with year fixed effects $(\\alpha_{M S A(j)}\\times\\alpha_{t})$ 12  \n\n### $B$ :Pair-Specific Shocks  \n\nOne potential concern that is not addressed by controlling for local shocks, is the possibility that a pair-specific shock (i.e., a shock that is specific to a VC-company pair, but not to the MSA of the company, or the MSA of the VC) is driving both company-level outcomes (e.g., patenting) and the introduction of the new airline route. For example, it could be that a portfolio company that is successful in patenting becomes more salient to its VC. In response, the VC may want to spend more time at that company and hence may lobby for better airline connections to the company's location. Nevertheless, such alternative stories are unlikely for several reasons. First, portfolio companies and VC frms are relatively small business entities. Hence, it seems unlikely that a VC-company pair is sufficiently powerful to successfully lobby for better airline connections (or that an airline would introduce a new route in response to a shock to that pair). To further rule out this concern, we have verified that our results also hold if we restrict our sample to portfolio companies and VC frms whose size is below the median in our sample, that is, those companies and VCs that are even less able to successfully lobby for a new airline route. Second, we examine the dynamic effects of the treatment. Arguably, if the new airline routes are introduced in response to pair-specific shocks, one may already observe an “effect'’ of the new airline routes before they are even introduced. However, when we examine the dynamics of the treatment, we find no such evidence: most of the effects we observe occur between 12 and 24 months after the introduction of the new airline routes. Third, in robustness checks, we show that our results also hold if we consider new airline routes that are introduced as part of the opening of a new hub or a merger between two airlines. Arguably, it is unlikely that a shock that is specific to a VC-company pair is sufficiently large to lead to a hub opening or an airline merger.  \n\n### $C$ Differences between Treated and Non-Treated Pairs  \n\nIn order to be treated, a VC-company pair needs to be sufficiently far apart so that air travel is the optimal means of transportation between the two. Thus, by construction, treated pairs are farther apart than the average VC-company pair in the U.S. This is confirmed by looking at the summary statistics in Table II. On average, treated pairs are located approximately 500 miles farther away than non-treated pairs. The other characteristics shown in the table further indicate that, for treated pairs, portfolio companies receive less funding, are less innovative, and tend to receive funding from VCs that are more experienced and more diversified.  \n\nWhile these difrences may be intuitive, they do raise the concern of whether our control group is an appropriate one. Nevertheless, this concern is minimized for several reasons. First, in all our regressions, we include VC-company pair fixed effects, which fully controls for any fixed differences between treated and non-treated VC-company pairs. Since the main difference—the distance between VC and portfolio company—is a fixed characteristic, it seems likely that most of the relevant differences between the two groups are absorbed away. Second, because of the staggered introduction of the new airline routes over time, the eventually treated pairs are both control and treatment pairs (i.e., they remain in the control group until they become treated). Third, we show that our results are robust if we restrict the control group to those control pairs whose average distance matches the average distance in the treatment group. Fourth, we show that our results also hold if we allow pairs that differ on the basis of the characteristics in Table II to be on different time trends. More precisely, this test is conducted by including as additional controls the characteristics in Table I interacted with a full set of year fixed effects (see Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003) for a similar robustness check).  \n\nFinally, another helpful robustness check proposed by Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003) consists of estimating the difference-in-differences specification using only observations of the eventually treated pairs— essentially, due to the staggered introduction of the new airline routes, Equation (1) can be estimated using only this subsample (in this case, the control group consists exclusively of pairs that are subsequently treated). Again, we show that our results are robust if we perform this test.  \n\n## III. Survey of VCs  \n\nThe key assumption underlying our empirical strategy is that VCs are responsive to the treatment, i.e., VC involvement increases following a reduction in travel time. Since VC involvement is not observable, we cannot directly test this assumption. Instead, to assess the plausibility of this assumption, we conduct a large-scale survey of VCs.  \n\nSurveying VC investors is dificult because these investors are time constrained and also notoriously reluctant to provide data on their operations. In order to increase the likelihood of participation, we limited our survey population to alumni from our respective academic institutions (Stanford, MIT, and Dartmouth). In total, we identified 2,109 alumni with current or past VC experience. We distributed the survey electronically to these alumni and obtained 306 responses (corresponding to a response rate of $14.5\\%$ ).13  \n\nAs is typically the case with VC surveys, our sample is unlikely to be perfectly representative of the VC universe. Nonetheless, we see no reason to believe that the sample should be biased toward  \n\nVCs whose monitoring is more sensitive to travel time reductions. The average assets under management (AUM) of the VC firms of survey participants was $\\$1.2$ billion (median \\$448 million).14 For comparison, the average assets under management of VC firms as reported by Thomson Reuters is $\\S$ 213 million. This difference refects the large representation of top VC firms in our survey. Panel A of Table IHI illustrates the geographical distribution of the survey participants. Approximately 20% were located outside the U.S. The most strongly represented international locations were Germany, Brazil, and China. Within the U.S., there was a clear bias toward California, which accounted for 70% of the participants. As expected, other prominent locations were Massachusetts and New York.  \n\nPanel B of Table III shows that 77% of the survey participants were partners at their VC firms. The average portfolio size among the respondents was 6.58 companies (median 5), and an average of 3.79 of these companies were local (median 3). A local company was defined as a company within 50 miles of the investor. The average number of visits to a given portfolio company was 9.93 per year (median 6). Interestingly, the survey participants reported that they spend 48% of their time monitoring and assisting portfolio companies. Moreover, 71% reported that they tend to visit local companies more than non-local companies, suggesting that proximity affects their level of involvement with a company. We explored this hypothesis more directly in the remainder of the survey.  \n\nA common issue in survey design is the possibility of social desirability bias (SDB). This refers to the tendency of research participants to present themselves in a positive or socially acceptable way (Maccoby and Maccoby, 1954). In the context of our survey, an important concern is that SDB may lead participants to be hesitant in revealing the effect of direct fights on their level of monitoring. Indeed, admitting that direct fights matter could suggest that respondents do not provide sufficient monitoring and assistance to distant companies. Rather, respondents might want to portray themselves as “always doing whatever is necessary to help their portfolio companies regardless of other factors.\"  \n\nVCs may want to portray themselves in this way to maintain a positive image in their own mind, or in the minds of others they imagine may get access to the survey results. Indeed, several VCs that we consulted when designing the survey independently brought up the concern that respondents may not be truthful for this reason. To help elicit truthful responses, we administered the survey in an anonymous manner and informed the participants that their identity could not be linked with their response. However, past research shows that anonymizing surveys has somewhat limited effectiveness in reducing SDB (Dillman et al., 1996; Singer et al., 1995). In our case, participants may worry that the online survey platform that we utilized does not completely strip identifying information (e.g., IP address) from their response. Therefore, in addition to anonymization, we also used the well-known technique of “indirect questioning” to further mitigate the possibility of SDB (Haire, 1950; Calder and Burnkrant, 1977; Anderson, 1978).  \n\nSpecifically, in our first set of key questions, rather than asking research participants about their own behavior, we asked about their beliefs about general VC behavior. While this approach has been shown to mitigate SDB, one may be concerned that VCs incorrectly perceive the sensitivity of others to reductions in travel time. Therefore, we also asked a second set of key questions regarding VCs? own behavior, recognizing that responses in this case may be more affected by SDB. For the second set of questions, we described a situation in which an indirect fight (Seattle to Raleigh-Durham via Chicago) is replaced by a non-stop fight. 15  \n\nFinally, according to survey design conventions, key questions are generally asked in a variety of different but closely related ways. Among other things, this helps ensure that the results are not driven by participants misunderstanding a single question. This is also helpful to better understand the mechanism through which direct fights improve VC involvement with portfolio companies. Therefore, for both our general and specific questions, we asked several variations related to different dimensions along which direct fights may matter. That being said, our main interest is in whether VCs report that they are likely to spend more time at a company in person if a direct fight is introduced.  \n\nOn all questions, participants were asked to state their degree of agreement with various statements about the effect of direct fights on VCs. We used a standard 6-point Likert scale, where potential responses ranged from Strongly Disagree ( $=1$ )toStrongly Agree( $=6$ ). We note that it is not clear what percentage of respondents would need to agree with these statements for our survey results to be consistent with our main empirical results. For example, if 30% of VCs become more involved when a direct fight is introduced, that may be enough for us to find a statistically significant effect on average. However, this point is largely irrelevant, as we find that a large majority of respondents agreed with all of the statements presented.  \n\nPanel C of Table IHI summarizes the responses to our general questions. The precise wording of the questions is shown in Section VI of the Internet Appendix. In terms of the main question, 86% of respondents agreed that direct fights between VCs and portfolio companies increase the time VCs spend at companies in person, with a mean response of 4.43 out of 6. The mean response was also statistically different from the neutral mid-point response of 3.5 at the 1% significance levels. We find that over 80% agreed with all of the remaining questions of the general variety and that the mean response was significantly non-neutral. For example, 83% agreed that direct fights allow VCs to more effectively advise companies, and 80% agreed that direct fights allow VCs to better understand key challenges and issues that portfolio companies are facing. The full distribution of responses to the indirect questions is depicted graphically in the first four rows of Figure 3.  \n\nPanel D of Table II summarizes the responses to our specific questions. Again, the precise wording of the questions is shown in Section VI of the Internet Appendix. In this case, 83% agreed that the introduction of a direct fight would increase the frequency with which they visit a portfolio company and 89% agreed that a direct fight would increase fexibility to visit a portfolio company when most useful. Interestingly, there was the least agreement (72%) that a direct fight would improve communications with the company. This is likely due to recent advances in communication technology. The remaining questions yielded agreement ranging from 75-81%, as survey participants agreed that the introduction of direct fights would help them establish better relationships with management teams, better understand the state of companies, and generally add more value. In all cases, the mean response was again significantly non-neutral at the $1\\%$ level. The full distribution of responses to the indirect questions is depicted graphically in the last six rows of Figure 3.  \n\nFinally, in unreported tests, we also explored whether the sensitivity to travel time differs across different types of participants. Because the survey was anonymous, we can only partition the sample based on answers to the preliminary questions. We find greater agreement with all 10 statements for VC partners, those currently working at a VC frm, as well as those who manage a greater number of companies. However, in most cases, the differences are not statistically significant. Nonetheless, these results provide some comfort that our overall findings do not primarily refect the views of low level associates or those that have not worked in the industry in many years.  \n\nTo summarize, the survey results indicate that VCs are likely to spend more time at their portfolio companies following a reduction in travel time. This qualitative evidence supports our underlying assumption that VC involvement is responsive to the treatment.16  \n\n## IV. Results  \n\n### A. Main Results  \n\nNext, we estimate variants of Equation (1) to examine whether the introduction of new airline routes that reduce the travel time between lead VC firms and their portfolio companies affects portfolio companies’ innovation and success. The results are presented in Table IV. In Columns (1)-(3) of Panel A, the dependent variable is the number of patents (in logs). The regression in Column (1) includes VC-company pair and year fixed effects. In Column (2), we also control for company age and a set of indicators for the stage of VC financing. In Column (3), we further control for local shocks by including the two sets of MSA by year fixed effects. The coefficient on the treatment indicator is very stable across all specifications. It lies between 0.031 and 0.037, which implies that the number of patents increases by 3.1% to 3.7% after the treatment. In Columns (4)-(6) of Panel A, we re-estimate these specifications using citations per patent (in logs) as the dependent variable. The coeffcient on the treatment indicator varies between 0.058 and 0.074, corresponding to an increase in citations per patent of 5.8% to 7.4%. In Columns (1)-(3) of Panel B, the dependent variable is an indicator equal to one if the company goes public (IPO) during the year. We find that the introduction of new airline routes leads to an increase in the likelihood of going public by approximately $1.0\\%$ . Finally, in Columns (4)-(6) of Panel B, the dependent variable is an indicator equal to one if the company goes public or is acquired during the year (\"Success\"). As is shown, the success likelihood increases by 1.1% to 1.4% following the treatment. Overall, our findings indicate that a reduction in VC monitoring costs leads to significant increases in innovation and the likelihood of a successful exit.17  \n\n### $B$ .Dynamic Effects of the Treatment  \n\nIn Table V, we study the dynamic effects of the introduction of new airline routes. Specifically, we replace the treatment indicator in Equation (1) with a set of four indicator variables representing the years around the treatment. For example, the indicator “Treatment (-1)” equals one if the VC-company pair observation is recorded in the year preceding the treatment. The other indicator variables are defined analogously with respect to the year of the treatment (O), the first year after the treatment (1), and two or more years after the treatment (2+). The underlying specification is the conservative specification used in Columns (3) and (6) of both panels of Table IV, i.e. the specification that includes control variables, VC-company pair fixed effects, year fixed effects, as well as the two sets of MSA by year fixed effects (henceforth, the “baseline specification\"). We observe a very similar pattern for all four dependent variables. In particular, we always find that the coefficient of Treatment (-1), which measures the “effect”’ of the new airline routes before their introduction, is small and insignificant, suggesting that there are no pre-existing trends in the data.18 The effect is positive but small in the year of the treatment (year O). It is only one year after the treatment (year 1) that the effect becomes large and significant. Finally, the effect is persistent in the longer run (years 2+). In sum, the dynamic pattern suggests that it takes about 12 to 24 months until the reduction in travel time materializes into greater innovation and higher likelihood of a successful exit.  \n\n### $C$ Lead versus Non-Lead VCs  \n\nThe results thus far indicate that the introduction of new airline routes between VCs and their existing portfolio companies leads to increased innovation and a higher likelihood of going public or being acquired. Our interpretation is that reduced travel time increases VC involvement, which in turn improves portfolio company outcomes. Still, because we do not observe VC involvement, we cannot definitively show that VC monitoring increases following a reduction in travel time. To further ensure that our results are driven by increased VC monitoring following the treatment, we take advantage of the fact that, ex ante, certain VCs are expected to be more sensitive to changes in monitoring costs than others. In particular, VC investments are often syndicated with one VC taking the role of the lead investor. The lead investor typically is the one primarily in charge of monitoring, while other investors are more passive providers of capital. Indeed, Gorman and Sahlman (1989) find that a VC acting as lead investor spends 10 times the number of hours on a company than he or she would otherwise. Accordingly, we expect the treatment effect to be concentrated in routes that connect portfolio companies with their lead VC, as opposed to other syndicate members.  \n\nTo investigate this hypothesis, we re-estimate our baseline specification in the sample of VCcompany pairs involving a non-lead investor located in a different MSA than the lead investor. We now set the treatment indicator to one if a new airline route is introduced that reduces the travel time between a portfolio company and a non-lead investor. The results are shown in Panel A of Table VI. We find that, for all dependent variables, the estimated treatment effect is statistically insignificant. Moreover, the sample size in this analysis is comparable to that from the baseline analysis and the point estimates are close to zero, suggesting these are well-estimated zero effects. One potential concern with this analysis, however, is that reducing travel time to the MSA of a non-lead VC may have less of an impact, not because those VCs are less involved, but because they are located in different types of cities. For example, they may be located in cities with fewer resources for start-ups. A priori, there is no reason to expect this to be the case, particularly because a typical VC acts in both a lead and non-lead capacity on different deals. Nonetheless, we explore the possibility that non-lead treatments connect companies to different types of MSAs in Panel B. As can be seen, non-lead treatments and lead treatments connect companies to MSAs that are similar in terms of population, income, as well as geography. Thus, the results overall are consistent with the argument that VC involvement increases following the treatment—travel time reductions appear to matter primarily for active investors.19  \n\n### $D$ . Small versus Large Reductions in Travel Time  \n\nIf travel time indeed matters, we expect to find a stronger treatment effect for larger reductions in travel time. In our baseline analysis, any new airline route that reduces the travel time between a VC firm and its portfolio company was coded as a treatment, regardless of the magnitude of the travel time reduction. We now interact the treatment indicator with two dummy variables indicating whether the reduction in travel time is “large\" or “small?\" We consider a travel time reduction to be large if it is more than one hour. The results are reported in Table VII. For travel time reductions of less than one hour, the treatment effect is small and insignificant. In contrast, the treatment effect is strongest and highly significant for travel time reductions of more than one hour. We note, however, that the difference between the two coefficients is not statistically significant at conventional levels. Given the limited number of treatments we observe in the data, we may not have sufficient power to identify cross-sectional differences, even if they are present.  \n\n### $E$ Robustness  \n\n#### E.1. Hub Openings and Airline Mergers  \n\nAs explained in Section II.B, one potential concern that is not addressed by controlling for local shocks is the possibility that a VC-company pair-specific shock is driving both company outcomes and the introduction of a new airline route (e.g., through lobbying). Given the relatively small size of portfolio companies and VC firms, such alternative stories seem unlikely. Moreover, we have verified that our results are robust if we restrict our sample to portfolio companies and VC firms whose size is below the median; that is, companies and VCs that are even less able to successfully lobby for a new airline route. In addition, if a new airline route is introduced in response to a pair-specific shock, one may already observe an “effect” of the new airline route before it is even introduced. However, when we looked at the dynamics of the treatment effect, we found no evidence for such pre-existing trends.  \n\nAnother way to rule out this concern is by considering new airline routes that are introduced as part of a hub opening or a merger between airlines. Arguably, it is unlikely that a pair-specific shock could induce the opening of a new hub or the merger of two airlines. Thus, new airline routes of this kind are more likely to be exogenous. The data on hub openings and airline mergers are obtained from Giroud (2013). Hub and merger treatments account for about 15% of the treatments in our sample. In Panel A of Table VIlI, we replace the treatment indicator in our baseline specification with two dummy variables indicating hub/merger treatments (Hub or Merger\") and other treatments (\"Other\"), respectively. As can be seen, our results are robust when considering hub and merger treatments, which alleviates concerns that our results may be driven by unobservable pair-specific shocks.20  \n\n#### E.2. Eventually Treated Pairs  \n\nAs discussed in Section II.C, in order to be treated, a VC-company pair needs to be suffciently far apart so that air travel is the optimal means of transportation between the two. Thus, by construction, treated pairs are farther away than control pairs. This difference raises the concern of whether our control group is an appropriate one. While the inclusion of VC-company pair fixed effects accounts for any time-invariant differences between pairs (such as differences in distance), a remaining concern is that long-distance VC-company pairs may be on a different trend. To mitigate this concern, we re-estimate our baseline specification using only observations of the eventually treated pairs—essentially, due to the staggered introduction of the new airline routes, Equation (1) can be estimated using only this subsample (for a similar robustness check, see Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2003). In this case, the control group consists exclusively of pairs that are subsequently treated, thus alleviating concerns about the comparability of the control group. In our context, a caveat of this test is that the number of observations drops to 7,978 pair-year observations, which makes it infeasible to control for MSA by year fixed effects. The results without these fixed effects are reported in Panel B of Table VII1. They are similar to our baseline estimates.  \n\n#### E.3. Miscellaneous Robustness Checks  \n\nThis section presents additional robustness checks. For brevity's sake, the results are tabulated in the Internet Appendix.  \n\nDistance-matched control group. To further mitigate the concern that control and treated pairs may be on different trends, we re-estimate our baseline specification after restricting the control group to those control pairs whose average distance matches the average distance in the treatment group. More precisely, we exclude short-distance control pairs (in increasing distance) until the average distance is the same in both groups. The results are presented in Panel A of Internet Appendix Table IA.III. As is shown, our results are robust to using this “distance-matched” control group.  \n\nHeterogenous time trends. Another way to address the possibility that control and treated pairs may be on diferent trends is to explicitly control for such heterogeneous time trends. This can be done by interacting the cross-sectional characteristics of interest (e.g., distance) with the full set of year fixed effects (see Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2003). Specifically, we interact all characteristics from Table II with year fixed effects and re-estimate our baseline specification with these additional controls. The results are reported in Panel B of Internet Appendix Table IA.III. The estimated treatment effects are very similar to before.  \n\nAlternative dependent variables. In Panel C of Internet Appendix Table IA.IIl, we explore whether our results are robust to alternative definitions of our main dependent variables. As discussed in Section I.B.2, in our baseline analysis we only consider citations during a three-year window following a patent grant, so that all patents in our sample have the same amount of time to garner citations. Hall et al. (2001) propose an alternative adjustment method that uses the estimated shape of the citation-lag distribution. In Column (1), we re-estimate our baseline specification, adjusting for truncation in this manner. The coefficient on the treatment indicator is similar to before. Another common practice in the literature is the use of citation-weighted patent counts (Trajtenberg, 1990). Column (2) shows that using this weighting leads to qualitatively similar results. Citation intensity also varies considerably across time and industries. In Column (3), we normalize each patent's (three-year) citation count by the mean citation count for patents granted in the same year and in the same technology class. This again yields similar results.  \n\nIndustry-specific local shocks. Next, we refine our baseline specification by allowing local shocks to be industry specific, that is, instead of including MSA by year fixed effects in Equation (1), we now include MSA by industry by year fixed effects (for both the MSAs of the portfolio company and the VC). We partition industries according to the six major industry groups of VentureXpert. The results are presented in Panel D of Internet Appendix Table IA.II1. As is shown, the estimates are very similar to our baseline coefficients in Table IV. However, the significance of the treatment effect is lower for all dependent variables (the treatment effect is even marginally insignificant for the IPO and Success indicators). This is not surprising given that the additional layer of industry fixed effects reduces the power of our tests.  \n\nTwo-way clustering. In Panel E of Internet Appendix Table IA.III, we re-estimate our baseline specification, clustering standard errors at both the portfolio company level and the VC firm level. As is shown, this changes our standard errors little and all results continue to be statistically significant.  \n\nAccess to non- VC resources. Finally, one potential concern is that a portfolio company might improve after the treatment not because of increased VC involvement, but because the portfolio company gains access to other resources at the VC's location (e.g., universities, technology centers, trade shows). This concern is mitigated by the inclusion of MSA by year fixed effects, since all companies at the same location would benefit from more direct access to these resources (regardless of the location of their VC). Nevertheless, to further rule out this alternative explanation, we examine whether the treatment leads to an increase in citations made to patents of non-VC individuals/organizations at the VC's location. More precisely, for each patent a portfolio company is granted, we calculate the percentage of citations that the patent makes to firms or inventors located in the MSA of the portfolio company's VC.21 We then examine whether this percentage increases following a reduction in travel time. The results are reported in Internet Appendix Table IA.IV. As can be seen, the estimated coefficients are statistically indistinguishable from zero and the magnitude of the point estimates is small as well. Thus, there is no evidence that the innovative activity of the treated companies is infuenced by increased access to non-VC resources at the VC's location.  \n\n#### F.1. Cross-Sectional Heterogeneity  \n\nIn Internet Appendix Table IA.V, we explore whether the treatment effect differs based on crosssectional characteristics (e.g., early versus late stage companies). To conduct this analysis, we interact the treatment indicator with the characteristics of interest. This analysis is subject to two caveats. First, while the treatment is arguably exogenous, the variables interacted with the treatment may not bethat is, they may correlate with unobservable characteristics that affect the extent to which VC-company pairs react to the treatment. Second, given the limited number of treatments we observe in the data, we may not have sufficient power to identify heterogeneous effects, even if they are present. Despite these caveats, we do find suggestive results that go in the direction one might expect.  \n\nIn Panel A, we interact the treatment variable with an “Early Stage\" indicator equal to one if the company is classified as “Seed\" or “Early Stage\" in the year under observation. We find evidence that the treatment effect is larger for early stage companies, suggesting that VC involvement may matter more early on. For patents (citations), the coefficient on the interaction term is positive and statistically significant. In terms of magnitudes, the effect of a reduction in travel time on patents is estimated to be about 4.5 (3.4) times larger for early stage companies. For IPOs (success), the point estimates suggest that the effect is about 2.6 (1.5) times larger; however, in this case, the difference is not statistically significant at conventional levels, potentially due to lack of power.  \n\nPanel B interacts the treatment variable with an “Other VC Close\" indicator equal to one if a non-lead VC (that is part of the investment syndicate) is located in the same MSA as the portfolio company. The point estimates of the interaction term coefficient are negative, suggesting that the treatment effect is smaller when a non-lead VC is located nearby. However, the difference in the effect is not statistically significant. This may reflect the fact that non-lead VCs are less actively involved in monitoring as discussed in Section IV.C. Finally, Panel C interacts the treatment variable with a “Syndicated\" indicator equal to one if more than one VC invested in the company.  \n\nThe point estimates are again negative but not statistically significant.  \n\n#### F.2. Regional Analysis  \n\nLastly, a natural extension of our analysis is to study whether proximity fosters VC fows between regions—to the extent that travel time affects performance outcomes within existing VC-company relationships, it likely also affects VCs’ investment decisions. This analysis is provided in Section V of the Internet Appendix. In a nutshell, we find that the introduction of a new airline route between two MSAs leads to a 4.6% increase in total VC investments as well as a 2.5% increase in the likelihood of VC activity between the two MSAs. These results indicate that better airline connections do indeed foster VC fows between regions.  \n\n## V. Conclusion  \n\nDo VCs contribute to the innovation and success of their portfolio companies, or do they simply identify and invest in companies that are already poised to innovate and succeed even absent their involvement? Our results suggest that VC involvement does matter. Specifically, we exploit exogenous reductions in monitoring costs stemming from the introduction of new airline routes that reduce the travel time between VCs and their existing portfolio companies, thereby holding company selection fixed. If differences in outcomes for portfolio companies are driven only by selection, reductions in monitoring costs subsequent to selection should have no effect. On the other hand, if VC activities do matter, reductions in monitoring costs should translate into better portfolio company performance by allowing VCs to engage in more of these activities.  \n\nWe find that reductions in travel time lead to an increase in the number of patents and number of citations per patent of the portfolio company, as well as an increase in the likelihood of an IPO or acquisition. These results are robust to controlling for local shocks that could potentially drive the introduction of the new airline routes. We also document that the effect is concentrated in routes that connect lead VCs (as opposed to other investors) with portfolio companies. Overall, our results indicate that VCs′ on-site involvement with their portfolio companies is an important determinant of innovation and success.  \n\nWe confirm the importance of this channel by conducting a large-scale survey of VC investors. We find that almost 90% of the respondents agreed that they would visit a portfolio company more frequently if an indirect fight were replaced by a direct fight. Moreover, survey participants also agreed that the introduction of a direct fight would help them establish better relationships with management teams, better understand the state of their companies, and generally add more value.  \n\n# REFERENCESS  \n\nAghion, Philippe, John Van Reenen, and Luigi Zingales, 2013, Innovation and institutional ownership, American Economic Review, 103, 277-304.   \nAnderson, James C., 1978, The validity of haire's shopping list projective technique, Journal of Marketing Research, 15, 644-649.   \nBerglof, Erik, 1994, A control theory of venture capital finance, Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization, 10, 247-267.   \nBertrand, Marianne, and Sendhil Mullainathan, 2003, Enjoying the quiet life?

Observations are shown at the level at which variables vary and are broken down by those that are “Never Treated\" and those that are “Ever Treated,\" as defined in Table I. Great circle distance is the distance (in miles) between the VC's ZIP code and the company's ZIP code. Travel time is the amount of time (in minutes) it takes to travel from the VC's ZIP code to the company's ZIP code (round trip) based on the optimal itinerary and means of transportation. Change in travel time is the reduction in travel time that occurs due to the treatment. Patents is the raw patent count, citations per patent is the number of citations garnered per patent in the three years after being granted, investment is the funding the portfolio company receives from all VCs in a given year. VC firm experience is measured as the number of years since firm founding, the number of companies invested in to date, and the number of investments that have gone public to date.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"3\">Never Treated</td><td colspan=\"3\">Ever Treated</td></tr><tr><td>Obs</td><td>Mean</td><td>Std Dev</td><td>Obs</td><td>Mean</td><td>Std Dev</td></tr><tr><td>Company-VC Pair Level:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Great Circle Distance (Miles)</td><td>30373</td><td>735.89</td><td>931.84</td><td>1131</td><td>1236.13</td><td>845.38</td></tr><tr><td>Travel Time (Minutes)</td><td>30373</td><td>470.22</td><td>551.17</td><td>1131</td><td>719.82</td><td>252.37</td></tr><tr><td>Change in Travel Time (Minutes)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1131</td><td>126.18</td><td>87.57</td></tr><tr><td>Company-Year Level:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Patents</td><td>111959</td><td>0.44</td><td>6.37</td><td>9293</td><td>0.28</td><td>1.28</td></tr><tr><td>Citations Per Patent</td><td>111959</td><td>1.43</td><td>7.89</td><td>9293</td><td>1.03</td><td>6.09</td></tr><tr><td>Investment (Millions)</td><td>111959</td><td>3.28</td><td>10.86</td><td>9293</td><td>1.70</td><td>7.14</td></tr><tr><td>VC-Year Level:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Experience (Years)</td><td>17404</td><td>11.00</td><td>13.43</td><td>8554</td><td>14.98</td><td>12.16</td></tr><tr><td>Experience (Companies)</td><td>17404</td><td>16.18</td><td>27.28</td><td>8554</td><td>53.85</td><td>74.36</td></tr><tr><td>Experience (IPOs)</td><td>17404</td><td>1.94</td><td>5.21</td><td>8554</td><td>8.26</td><td>15.21</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n# Table III Survey Evidence  \n\nThis table shows the results of a survey of VC investors. Panel A shows the distribution of respondents across countries and U.S. states. Panel B summarizes the responses to the preliminary questions. Panels C and D summarize the responses to the key questions shown in Section VI of the Internet Appendix. The questions in Panel C regard general VC behavior, whereas the questions in Panel D regard the behavior of the respondents. On all questions, a standard 6-point likert scale is used, where potential responses range from Strongly Disagree $=1$ ) to Strongly Agree ( $=6$ ). The $\\%$ Agree column represents the percent of respondents that somewhat agreed, agreed, or strongly agreed with the statement. A $t$ test is done to determine if the mean response is statistically different from the neutral mid-point of 3.5. $^*$ ,\\*\\*, and $^{***}$ denote statistical significance at the $10\\%$ ， $5\\%$ ,

Karolyi  \n\nMay 12, 2016  \n\n# Abstract  \n\nWe examine the effect of institutional ownership on corporate disclosure policy using a regression discontinuity design. Using novel data that encompasses every 8-K filing between 1996 and 2006, we find that positive shocks to institutional ownership around Russell index reconstitutions increase the quantity, form, and quality of disclosure. Compared to those at the bottom of the Russell 1000 index, firms at the top of the Russell 2000 index increase institutional ownershipby $9.8\\%$ , and disclose 4.7% longer 8-K filings with $21.3\\%$ more embedded graphics. This incremental disclosure significantly increases the information content of 8-K filings for the market and for analysts.  \n\n# 1. Introduction  \n\nDo institutional investors demand corporate disclosure? A central question in finance and accounting is whether corporate transparency benefits or hurts investors. This issue is complicated by the fact that information provision could impact groups of investors differentially. Public information may crowd out the private information advantage of some institutional investors (Gao and Liang [2013], Armstrong et al. [2012]); alternatively, investors, particularly those following more passive trading strategies, may not be information sensitive. However, even passive institutional investors may benefit from an increase in monitoring by other stakeholders following improved disclosure (Bens [2002]). Further, regardless of the preferences of institutional investors, whether or not they are able to affect corporate policy on this margin is unclear. This tradeoff is refected in mixed empirical evidence on the relationship between institutional ownership and corporate disclosure (Ajinkya et al. [2005], Bushee et al. [2003], Bushee and Noe [2000], Healy et al. [1999], O'Brien and Bhushan [1990]).  \n\nTo address this tradeoff faced by institutional investors, we analyze the revealed preference for corporate disclosure by institutional investors and the associated impact on the information content of corporate disclosure. Empirically, identifying a causal effect of institutional ownership on corporate disclosure policy is dificult because experimental settings and direct measures of corporate disclosure quantity and characteristics are scarce. We propose a two part solution to these problems. First, we utilize exogenous changes in institutional ownership around Russell 2000 index reconstitutions in a regression discontinuity design to identify the effect of institutional ownership on corporate disclosure policy. Second, we directly measure the characteristics of corporate disclosure using a novel data set comprised of all 8-K filings between 1996 and 2006.  \n\nRussell index membership satisfies the key aspects of a regression discontinuity design because membership is based on the end of May closing-price implied market capitalization rank. While these market capitalization rank cutoffs are public knowledge and consistent through time, the underlying market capitalization cutoffs are time-varying and depend on the cross-sectional distribution of market capitalization at the end of the last trading day in May. Firms in the top 1000 ranked market capitalization on that day become members of the Russell 1000 and the subsequent 2000, those ranked between 1001 and 3000, comprise the Russell 2000. Therefore, especially close to these market capitalization rank thresholds, Russell index reconstitutions are quasi-random with respect to corporate policies. Because the indexes are value-weighted, the largest firms in the Russell 2000 receive weights which are 10-15 times larger than do the smallest firms in the Russell 1000, even though they are similar in size (Appel et al. [2016], Chang et al. [2015]). Since these indexes are widely used as performance and portfolio benchmarks by institutional investors, this difference in weights leads to significant differences in institutional ownership between firms at the bottom of the Russell 1000 relative to those at the top of the Russell 2000.  \n\nThis experimental setting and novel data provide a platform to contribute to our knowledge about institutional investor demand for corporate disclosure along the dimensions of quantity, form, and quality. Our goal is to estimate the effect of an exogenous shock to institutional ownership on corporate disclosure policy. We find that Russell 2000 inclusion has a positive impact on the quantity of disclosure. Relative to frms just excluded from the Russell 2000 index, firms just included disclose 1.7% more 8-K filings and $2.0\\%$ more items per 8-K filing. These results suggest that institutional investors demand more corporate disclosure and that this preference is successfully reflected in terms of incremental disclosure by firms.  \n\nWe argue that this change in disclosure cannot be explained by increases in corporate operating activity that require mandatory disclosure for two reasons. First, the content of each distinct disclosure increases. Specifically, the 8-K filings of firms just on the Russell 200 side of the  \n\n1000/2000 threshold are 4.7% longer, as measured by the number of characters in the filing, and include 21.3% more embedded graphics and 1.4% more exhibits compared to firms on the Russell 1000 side. Second, we find that Russell 2000 inclusion also has a positive impact on the quality of disclosure. The information content of 8-K fling announcements, as measured by absolute cumulative abnormal returns (CAR), increases by a factor of 1.46, on average. Not only does the amount of disclosure increase, but this information is valuable to capital market participants.  \n\nFurthermore, this average increase in stock return reaction is directly related to the increase in length, embedded graphics, and exhibits per 8-K filing. We first examine the relationship between 8-K characteristics and absolute CARs to document the importance of these characteristics. We find that the length and the number of items, graphics, and exhibits are all economically and statistically significant in explaining equity market reactions to 8-K filings. This result complements Lerman and Livnat [2010], which documents the information content of distinct item categories in 8-K disclosures. To control for the information content of different 8-K items, we include indicator variables for each item type and find that the information content of the length, graphics, and exhibits increases even within 8-K item types.  \n\nAfter controlling for these 8-K characteristics and the interaction of these 8-K characteristics with institutional ownership, the impact of Russell 2000 inclusion itself on absolute CARs is not as economically or, in some specifications, statistically significant. However, the interaction terms have statistically and economically significant positive effects, suggesting that the increase in the information content of 8-K filings is explained by the change in disclosure characteristics. For example, each additional embedded graphic corresponds to a 10.5 basis point increase in absolute CARs, on average. These results suggest that the increase in the information content of 8-K announcements is a result of changes in disclosure quantity and form, rather than index-membership-induced changes in investor attention.  \n\nTo further abstract away from the potential market microstructure effects of Russell 2000 index inclusions (Chang et al. [2015]), we focus on two alternative measures to test for changes in the information content of 8-K filings. These measures are based on equity analyst forecast accuracy and forecast revisions, which provide real outcomes that are directly related to information revelation. Without new valuable information, analysts have no reason to revise their forecasts. Similarly, incremental disclosure of valuable information should allow analysts to make more accurate forecasts. Our analyst results are in line with our results on equity market reactions to 8-K filings. On average, the consensus forecast deviation from actual earnings-per-share (EPS) of frms just included in the Russell 2000 index decreases by 16.2% relative to those just excluded. Similarly, the number of forecast revisions per broker in the five days following an 8-K filing increases by 59.1% for firms just included in the Russell 2000 index relative to those just excluded. Using the same interaction methodology as in the absolute CARs tests, we find that the increases in analyst forecast accuracy and forecast revisions are directly related to the increase in length, embedded graphics, and exhibits per 8-K filing. These results suggest that equity analysts react to the change in disclosure by making more forecasts and also more accurate forecasts.  \n\nBroadly speaking, one can view this set of results as illuminating the governance preferences of institutional investors. As a component of governance, disclosure is unique both because it has important feedback effects on other components of governance by empowering all shareholders with decision-relevant information and because it impacts allocative efficiency.1 Previous papers that focus on the governance effects of institutional investors using the Russell index reconstitution setting do not address the information content of disclosure. This result alone demonstrates that institutional investors demand and affect the public dissemination of decision-relevant information. That is, we observe both that governance affects disclosure policy, and that disclosure policy then affects investment decisions. Because the investment decisions in response to the disclosure are not likely being made by the same investors that benchmark to the Russell indexes, we can infer that the incremental information has reached its target audience and that the institutional investors that enacted the change in disclosure policy must benefit indirectly from the incremental disclosure that they effected.  \n\nTrading in response to Russell index reconstitutions is a result of benchmarking behavior, so our inferences about the governance and disclosure preferences of institutional investors relate to institutional investors that benchmark to the Russell indexes. Because both active and passive investors, as traditionally defined (Bushee [2001]), may use the Russell indexes as portfolio benchmarks, the Russell index reconstitution setting identifies the governance and disclosure preferences of a mix of active and passive investors. However, as defined in Cremers and Petajisto [2009], an important characteristic of institutional investors is their place on the benchmarking continuum, which has a lower bound of pure indexing (i.e., no active positions that distinguish portfolio holdings from the benchmark index). Because investors that are close to the pure indexing extreme of the benchmarking continuum are the most likely to respond to Russell index reconstitutions, we view our results as reflecting the disclosure preferences of relatively passive investors.  \n\nWe believe that a key contribution of the literature that exploits Russell index reconstitutions for identification is the finding that investors making relatively passive portfolio decisions may be active in governance (Appel et al. [2016], Crane et al. [2016]). In general, this result highlights the importance of share price maximization even for investors that do not make active portfolio decisions. Disclosure can benefit benchmarking investors through governance mechanisms, but benchmarking investors can also benefit from increased public disclosure because public disclosure increases liquidity,2 which decreases transaction costs and reduces tracking error. Using the same 2Cchoonfold [9015l fnde that diccloeure increacoe etocl liouidity huy ctudving S&sP 500 indev changee  \n\nRussell reconstitution setting, two existing papers highlight mechanisms through which passive institutional investors may effect changes in corporate governance. Consistent with the stated governance objectives of large passive institutional investors $^3$ , Appel et al. [2016] provide evidence of increases in the number of independent directors, reductions in the use of poison pills and restrictions on shareholders? ability to call special meetings, diminished use of dual-class share structures, and less support for management proposals. Crane et al. [2016] also document a discontinuity in voting participation at the Russell 1000/2000 index threshold, supporting the notion that these institutional investors are not simply passive stakeholders from a governance perspective.  \n\nA contemporaneous paper, Boone and White [2015], investigates the relationship between institutional ownership and managerial guidance, a measure of voluntary disclosure, focusing on the effects of managerial guidance on market microstructure. Relative to that paper, we show not only that positive shocks to institutional ownership increase disclosure along the intensive margin of mandatory disclosure through 8-K filing frequency and characteristics, but also that the information content and consequences of these disclosures increase. Moreover, the nature of any interaction between managerial guidance and mandatory corporate disclosure is unclear (Li and Yang [2015], Ball et al. [2012], Einhorn [2005], Verrecchia [1983]), and so we check our results for robustness to any attenuation bias due to the potentially complementary relationship between the two forms of disclosure. Our results are robust to excluding variation from 8-Ks that are likely to contain information related to managerial guidance, which suggests that any relationship between voluntary and mandatory disclosure in this setting must be weak.  \n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and sample selection. Section 3 discusses measurement and identification using Russell index reconstitutions. Section 4 analyzes the consequences of disclosure using equity market and analyst reactions to 8-K filings, 3Vanguard, 2014,　Our　views on corporate  governance, https://about.vanguard.com/vanguardproxyvoting/corporate-governance /.  \n\nSection 5 discusses subsample and specification robustness and Section 6 concludes. Supplementary results are presented in the Appendix.  \n\n# 2.Data  \n\nOur empirical methodology depends upon changes in Russell 2000 index membership over time. Two approaches have been used in the literature to identify these index membership lists. Because the Russell 1000 and 2000 indexes are explicitly determined by market capitalization rank as of the last trading day in May each year, the index memberships can be constructed using CRSP; we use these observed market capitalization rankings in our main results.4 An important caveat to this identification approach is that Russell changed their indexing methodology in 2007 by introducing “banding\". The “banding\" policy smoothes over changes in index membership because it allows firms that should be excluded from the indexes to remain members if they are close to the observed market capitalization rank threshold. Because of this index methodology change and the introduction of consistent and recoverable 8-K filings, we restrict our sample period to begin in 1996 and end in 2006.  \n\nTo address the question of whether institutional investors demand corporate disclosure, we must construct proxies for the quantity and characteristics of corporate disclosure. We do this in two ways. First, we rely on prior literature to construct measures of fnancial reporting quality (Beatty et al. [2010]), auditor choice (Behn et al. [2008], Khurana and Raman [2004]), adverse auditor opinions (Li et al. [2010], Ashbaugh-Skaife et al. [2009]), and accruals management (Demerjian et al. [2012], Yu [2008], Bergstresser and Philippon [2006]). These variables are readily constructed from Compustat data. These variables are $B i g4_{i,t}$ , an indicator that equals one if firm $i$ has a Big  \n\nFour auditor in year $t$ and zero otherwise $^5$ ， $A u d S w i t c h_{i,t}$ , an indicator that equals one if firm $i$ switches from any auditor to another in year $t$ and zero otherwise, $A d v O p i n i o n_{i,t}$ , an indicator that equals one if frm $i$ 's auditor issues an “Adverse\" opinion on the effectiveness of the firm's internal control over financial reporting and zero otherwise, $A b s A c c_{i,t}$ is firm $i$ 's absolute value of accruals scaled by total assets in year $t$ , and $A c c Q u a l i t y_{i,t}$ is the measure of accounting quality proposed by Beatty et al. [2010] for frm $i$ in year $t$  \n\nTable 1 presents summary statistics of these measures for firms in the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 indexes along with accompanying tests of difference in means between these two groups. These univariate tests reveal that firms in the Russell 2000 are less likely to use a Big Four auditor, less likely to receive an adverse opinion from their auditor, have higher absolute accruals as a fraction of assets, and have lower accounting quality as measured by Beatty et al. [2010]. At the frm-year level, 79.06% of Russell 1000 members use Big Four auditors compared to only 61.47% of Russell 2000 members.  \n\nTo obtain more granular and detailed measures of corporate disclosure, we collect a dataset of all 8-K filings between 1996 and 2006 that includes not only the number and timing of 8-K flings, but also their characteristics. The SEC requires publicly traded companies to make 8-K filings to report material events in a timely manner. Material events include entry into bankruptcy or receivership, the acquisition or disposition of assets, a change of auditor, and the departure or appointment of directors and executives, among others. Because the objective of the SEC is to promote the full public disclosure of relevant company information, and the 8-K, or the “current report\", has been the tool for frms to disclose timely information on important operational or financial changes between periodic financial reports, we believe 8-K filings are an ideal and direct measure of corporate disclosure.  \n\nTo refect the quantity of corporate disclosure, we construct variables based on the number of 8-K filings, the length of each 8-K filing, the number and type of items reported in each 8-K filing, the number of exhibits included in each 8-K filing, and the number of graphics used in each 8-K filing. We posit that these variables refect the quantity of corporate events disclosed as well as disclosure methods. Given the information content of textual information in 10-K filings (Loughran and McDonald [2011]), we expect the text in 8-K filings to include valuable information for investors. Graphics are a salient feature of 8-K flings and we conjecture that they increase the information content of disclosure because they ease the interpretation of textual or tabulated information with visual representation. Similarly, because exhibits contained in 8-K flings include press releases, contracts, and supplemental tabulated financial information, we expect them to have information content for investors (Ma [2015]).  \n\nTable 2 presents summary statistics of these measures for firms in the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 indexes along with accompanying tests of differences in means between these two groups. These univariate tests reveal that firms in the Russell 1000 do more disclosure than do firms in the Russell 2000. At the firm-month and filing levels, Russell 1000 members disclose longer 8-K flings and embed more graphics than Russell 2000 members. Per month, Russell 1000 members disclose 1.76 8-K filings compared to 1.56 for Russell 2000 members, and these filings contain relatively more graphics. These differences in disclosure between Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 index members likely reflect differences in observable firm characteristics, such as size, but also the average level of institutional ownership, which is higher in the Russell 1000.  \n\nFinally, to determine whether changes in the quantity and characteristics of corporate disclosure have consequences for the information content of disclosure, we rely on data from CRSP on stock returns and trading volume and data from I\\B\\E\\S on analyst forecast accuracy and revisions.  \n\n# 3. Index Reconstitutions, Institutional Ownership, and Disclosure  \n\n## 3.1 Identification  \n\nOur goal is to estimate the effect of an exogenous shock to institutional ownership on corporate disclosure policy and the information content of disclosures. We do so using Russell index reconstitutions as natural experiments in a regression discontinuity design because index membership is mechanical—it is based only on the size rank of frms, which is measured using closing market capitalization on the last trading day in May. After the reconstitution, the one thousand largest firms make up the Russell 1000, and the next two thousand largest firms make up the Russell 2000. Because the underlying market capitalization thresholds vary according to the particular distribution of market capitalization across firms at that time, Russell index reconstitutions can be viewed as quasi-random. Our empirical procedure involves a two-stage estimation. The first stage isolates the variation in institutional ownership around the Russell 1000/2000 threshold, which is driven by differences in assets under management following the indexes and different index weights across the indexes. The second stage connects this variation to changes in corporate disclosure policy.  \n\nFormally, we implement the regression discontinuity design with the following two-stage model:  \n\n$$\nI O_{i,t}=\\alpha+\\tau D_{i,t}+f(R_{i,t})+\\pi X_{i,t}+v_{t}+\\xi_{i,t}\n$$  \n\n$$\nY_{i,t}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}\\widehat{I O}_{i,t}+g(R_{i,t})+\\beta_{2}X_{i,t}+\\omega_{t}+\\varepsilon_{i,t}\n$$  \n\nwhere $v_{t}$ represents year-month fixed effects, $D_{i,t}$ is an indicator variable that equals one if firm $i$ is actually assigned to the Russell 2000 index in year $t$ and zero otherwise, $^6$ $R_{i,t}$ represents the observed market capitalization rank of firm $i$ in year $t$ minus 1,000, $I O_{i,t}$ represents the fraction of firm $i$ 's shares outstanding owned by institutions in year $t$ , and $Y_{i,t}$ represents measures of financial reporting quality from the literature on corporate disclosure and based on our database of 8-K filings. $X_{i,t}$ includes a set of time-varying firm characteristics as controls. We include yearmonth fixed effects to remove the possibility that the results are being driven by secular changes in corporate disclosure or disclosure regulation.7  The functions $f$ and $g$ are parametrized as $k$ order polynomials in the observed market capitalization ranking, $R_{i,t}$ , on either side of the Russell 1000/2000 threshold. The parameter $k$ is chosen to maximize the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) as in Lee and Lemieux [2010].  \n\nA key methodological issue in estimating this system of equations is institutional ownership classifications. We focus, like Crane et al. [2016], on total institutional ownership in our main tests while another set of papers, including Boone and White [2015], restricts focus to quasi-index investors as defined in Bushee [2001] or to passive mutual funds (Appel et al. [2016]). These ex ante classifications all include investors that hold diverse portfolios with low turnover. We choose to focus on total institutional ownership in our main tests because, independent of ex ante classifications, any institutional investor that significantly responds to the Russell index reconstitutions is likely to benchmark or track the Russell indexes.8 As a result, we view reconstitution-motivated reallocations close to the index assignment threshold to be quasi-random for all types of institutional investors. This perspective implies that excluding some investors based on ex ante classifications can induce an omitted variables problem. This problem arises because excluded investors may use Russell indexes as benchmarks, which would induce trading around reconstitutions, and may have similar governance preferences and abilities to exact changes in corporate policies.  \n\nWhile the extant papers that exploit the Russell index reconstitution setting effectively use the same identifying variation, there are some remaining methodological differences in implementation (Appel et al. [2016], Boone and White [2015], Crane et al. [2016]). We provide additional discussion of these alternative specifications in Section 5.2. In particular, we present the robustness of our main findings to alternative specifications that incorporate alternative ex ante investor classifications, running variables, and generally accepted regression discontinuity designs.  \n\nIntuitively, this system of equations ensures that the variation in institutional ownership that we use to identify our coefficient of interest, $\\beta_{1}$ , comes from Russell index reconstitutions. Because the effect of index reconstitutions on disclosure policy operates through the institutional ownership channel, we utilize an instrumental variables implementation of a regression discontinuity design. Technically, the change in disclosure policy happens stochastically with respect to the threshold; an observed change in disclosure policy around the rank threshold does not happen with certainty, which is the differentiating requirement that a sharp regression discontinuity design would require.  \n\nOur two stage least squares design in equations (1) and (2) means that $D_{i,t}$ can be interpreted as an instrumental variable. Thus, the conditions for instrument validity must be satisfied. We observe relevance in Panel A of Figure 1, which plots the discontinuity in institutional ownership around the rank threshold of 100o. Firms just to the left of the rank threshold are included in the Russell 1000 and firms just to the right of the threshold are included in the Russell 2000. Beyond the statistical relevance of the the rank threshold, relevance is satisfied because of two institutional features of the Russell indexes. First, approximately twice as much institutional investor money is invested in the Russell 2000 compared to the Russell 1000 (Chang et al. [2015]). Second, Russell indexes are value-weighted, meaning that a firm just included in the Russell 1000 index will have a much lower index weight than a firm just excluded from the Russell 1000 index. These two features suggest that the discontinuity in institutional ownership around the observed market capitalization rank threshold of 1000 is a result of the Russell index methodology. Valid instruments must also satisfy the exclusion criterion. In our case, exclusion is satisfied because other observables are locally continuous at the rank threshold. That is, inclusion in the Russell 1000 or Russell 2000 should not impact disclosure policy directly. Rather, its effect on disclosure policy exists only because of its effect on institutional ownership.  \n\nTable 3 presents estimates of $\\tau$ from equation (1) in which $k=0$ , 1, and 2 for parsimony. $_{10}$ These estimates are consistent with Crane et al. [2016] and Appel et al. [2016] in that we fnd strong evidence of a discontinuity in institutional ownership around the Russell 1000/2000 threshold.11 Regardless of $k$ , our estimates of the Russell 2000 inclusion effect on institutional ownership at the Russell 1000/2000 threshold are statistically significant at least at the 5% level. For $k=2$ ，the polynomial form chosen by the BIC, we find that firms just included in the Russell 2000 index have a 9.8% increase in institutional ownership relative to those just included in the Russell 1000 index.  \n\n## 3.2 Reporting Quality Measures from the Literature  \n\nAmong the three groups of disclosure proxies, the first group includes variables derived from the literature on financial reporting quality constructed using Compustat data from annual 10-K filings. Table 4 presents evidence of the effect of institutional ownership on these variables. The estimation results suggest that the average increase in institutional ownership associated with Russell 2000 inclusion causes a 3.3% increase in the probability of choosing a Big 4 auditor, a 2.4% marginal increase in the probability of switching auditors, a 1.3% decrease in the probability of having an adverse opinion, and 2.8% lower absolute abnormal accruals as a percentage of total assets.  \n\nAdditionally, we find a statistically insignificant positive relationship between Russell 2000 index inclusion and accounting quality, as defined in Beatty et al. [2010]. Together, this evidence suggests that, relative to frms just excluded, frms just added to the Russell 2000 index seek out new and better auditors, are less likely to have adverse auditor opinions, and decrease their use of earnings management. These findings are consistent with institutional owners preferring and bringing about improvements in information quality.  \n\n## 3.3 Measuring Corporate Disclosure with 8-K Filings  \n\nThe second group of measures are based on 8-K filings. For a panel of frm-year-month observations, we track the number of 8-K filings in a given year-month, or $N u m8k F i l i n g s_{i,t}$ , the cumulative length of these filings, NumCharacter $s_{i,t}$ , the number of separate items disclosed in these filings, $N u m I t e m s_{i,t}$ , the number of graphics provided in these flings, $N u m G r a p h i c s_{i,t}$ , and the number of exhibits in these filings, $N u m E x h i b i t s_{i,t}$ . With these variables, our intention is to capture both the quantity and the richness of each firm's reporting environment, so that we can assess not only how much but also what kinds of disclosures institutional investors demand from frms.  \n\nAs a first step, we present smooth local polynomial plots in Panels B-D of Figure 1 to illustrate the effect of index inclusion on these disclosure outcomes. In these figures, we can only interpret the jump in disclosure around the rank threshold as a result of institutional ownership because we also observe the discontinuity in institutional ownership at the rank threshold, which is shown in Panel A of Figure 1, and because of the aforementioned features of the Russell indexes. These figures show that Russell 20o0 inclusion is associated with increases in the quantity of disclosure. When we formally estimate this effect in Panel A of Table 5, we find that a 10% increase in institutional ownership increases the number of 8-K flings by 0.37 per year, the length of filings by 60,609 characters per year, and the number of embedded graphics by 3.63 per year; the number of items and exhibits increase by 0.67 and 0.42 per year, respectively.12 These estimates show that the exogenous increase in institutional ownership at the Russell 2000 inclusion threshold is associated with a higher quantity of corporate disclosure, as measured by the number of 8-K filings and the content within these 8-K filings.  \n\nThe third group of measures also use 8-K filings, but instead of focusing on absolute changes in the characteristics of all filings within a given month, we focus on the changes per filing. This analysis provides evidence as to whether firms are changing the quantity of disclosure on the intensive, as well as the extensive, margin.  \n\nThe evidence in Panel B of Table 5 suggests that not only does the quantity of disclosure increase, but also the amount of information contained in each filing increases for frms just added to the Russell 2000 index relative to firms just excluded. The length of each filing increases by 4,181 characters, the number of items increases by 0.04, the number of graphics by 0.21, and the number of exhibits by 0.01. These estimates are economically significant because they are close in magnitude to the monthly results, and because they represent marginal increases on the order of 2% to $15\\%$ . In particular, the increases in the length and number of embedded graphics per fling of approximately $12\\%$ and 15%, respectively, mean that the increase in corporate disclosure cannot be fully explained by increases in the number of corporate events that involve mandatory disclosure that may also be associated with increases in institutional ownership.  \n\nTable A2 of the Appendix investigates the time series properties of this change in 8-K fling frequencies and amounts. We explore the potential for heterogeneous effects before and after the passage of Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg. FD). The results are uniformly larger economically, but statistically different post-Reg. FD only for length and the number of graphics. If Reg.  \n\nFD decreased the prevalence of private information, these results are consistent with institutional investors incrementally demanding public disclosure to offset this lost private information channel. We also test for differences before and after 2004 when the SEC changed the structure of mandatory 8-K flings to make the item categorization system more granular. We find no economic or statistical differences across these two subperiods.  \n\nThe results in the previous three tables are consistent with three inferences about institutional investor demand for corporate disclosure. First, as a shock to institutional investor holdings, index membership increases the quantity of corporate disclosures. Second, to the extent that Big Four auditors have a better auditing technology, this shift in disclosure quantity is accompanied by higher internal reporting scrutiny, evidenced by the switch to Big Four auditors and the drop in adverse opinions. Third, the change in corporate disclosure policy is not restricted just to the total quantity of information, but also the quantity of information per 8-K filing and variety of information transmission tools utilized. This third inference is supported mainly by the results presented in Panel B of Table 5, but also to a lesser extent by the traditional measures of reporting quality in Table 4.  \n\n# 4. Consequences of Disclosure  \n\n## 4.1 Equity Market Reactions to Corporate Disclosure  \n\nIn this section, we examine consequences of the shift in corporate disclosure policy due to institutional investor demand. For this analysis, we focus on two dimensions: 8-K announcement returns and trading volume. Because we are concerned with the effect of changes in corporate disclosure on 8-K announcement returns, we focus on the magnitude of the 8-K announcement returns rather than the direction. Thus, our first dependent variable of interest is $a b s(C A R_{i,t})$ -the three day, market-adjusted cumulative abnormal returns around firm $i$ 's 8-K announcement on date $t$ 13Our second dependent variable of interest has to do with trading volume around the 8-K announcement date. We construct $\\ln A b n o r m a l V o l u m e_{i,t}$ , the natural log of the three day, cumulative abnormal trading volume of firm $i$ 's 8-K announcement on date $t$ 14  \n\nTo determine whether capital market participants care about the information contained in 8-K filings we first examine the relationship between $a b s(C A R_{i,t})$ ,AbnormalVolumer $,t$ ,and our measures of 8-K filing characteristics. In the full sample of 1,373,778 8-K filings between 1996 and 2006, we estimate the following regression:  \n\n$$\nY_{i,t}=\\alpha+\\beta X_{i,t}+u_{i}+v_{t}+\\epsilon_{i,t}\n$$  \n\nwhere $u_{i}$ and $v_{t}$ represent firm and year-month fixed effects, $Y_{i,t}$ represents $a b s(C A R_{i,t})$ or In AbnormalVolume $^{\\imath,t}$ , and $X_{i,t}$ represents a vector of 8-K fling characteristics that includes NumCharacters $^{i,t}$ ,NumItems $^{i,t}$ , NumGraphics $^{i,t}$ , and $N u m E x h i b i t s_{i,t}$  \n\nThe results presented in Table 6 suggest that the characteristics of corporate disclosure have an incremental relationship with the information content of 8-K filings. The length and the number of items, graphics, and exhibits in 8-K filings are positively correlated with the magnitude of 8-K announcement returns and abnormal trading volume. That the return response is increasing in the number of items and exhibits is not surprising because each of these correspond to unique information events. However, the positive relationship between the number of graphics, length, and absolute CARs implies that the amount of information about each event and the graphical presentation of information increases the information content of 8-K flings.15  \n\nWe next focus on the difference in stock market reactions to 8-K announcements between firms just included and excluded from the Russell 2000 index. Panel E of Figure 1 presents graphical evidence of the effect of index inclusion on stock market reactions, which is suggestive of a significant increase in reactions at the top of the Russell 200o. To formally test for this effect, we estimate the following regression at the individual 8-K level:  \n\n$$\nY_{i,t}=\\alpha+\\beta_{I O}\\widehat{I O}_{i,t}+\\beta_{X}X_{i,t}+u_{i}+v_{t}+\\epsilon_{i,t}\n$$  \n\nwhere $u_{i}$ and $v_{t}$ represent firm and year-month fixed effects, respectively, $\\widehat{I O}_{i,t}$ is the instrumented institutional ownership of frm $i$ in year-month $t$ , and $Y_{i,t}$ represents $a b s(C A R_{i,t})$ or In AbnormalVolume $^{\\imath,t}$ $X_{i,t}$ includes 8-K filing and firm characteristics as controls.  \n\nThe previous model identifies the average effect of exogenous changes in institutional ownership associated with Russell 2000 index inclusion on announcement returns and abnormal trading volume. In the following model, we allow this average effect to vary with the change in corporate disclosure policy found in Section 3. In the same sample of 8-K filings, we estimate:  \n\n$$\nY_{i,t}=\\alpha+\\beta_{I O}\\widehat{I O}_{i,t}+\\beta_{Z}Z_{i,t}+\\beta_{I n t e r a c t i o n}I\\widehat{O_{i,t}\\times Z_{i,t}}+\\beta_{X}X_{i,t}+u_{i}+v_{t}+\\epsilon_{i,t}\n$$  \n\nwhere $Z_{i,t}$ represents four measures that proxy for the breadth and depth of disclosure, $\\ln N u m C h a r a c t e r s_{i,t}$ NumItems $^{i,t}$ , NumGraphics $^{i,t}$ , and $N u m E x h i b i t s_{i,t}$ . In Panel A of Table 7, we present $a b s(C A R)_{i,t}$ coefficient estimates for $\\beta_{I O}$ ， $\\beta_{Z}$ , and $\\beta_{I n t e r a c t i o n}$ for each of the four proxies for breadth and depth of disclosure. We instrument for the endogenous interaction term, $I O\\times Z_{i,t}$ , by interacting $Z_{i,t}$ with $D_{i,t}$ ， $R_{i,t}^{j}$ , and $D_{i,t}\\times R_{i,t}^{j}$ for each $j$ chosen by the BIC in the frst stage. Our estimates show that increases in institutional ownership associated with Russell 2000 index inclusion lead to increased information content in 8-K filings. Announcement returns increase in magnitude by 6.6 bps, on average. Furthermore, the estimation results reflect the two channels by which corporate  \n\ndisclosure policy impacts the information content of 8-K flings. First, part of this increase in 8-K announcement returns is due to changes in the amount of content included in each filing. The interaction results suggest that the per-filing return reaction is smaller, on average, for firms just included in the Russell 2000 index relative to those just excluded, but that the return reaction is incrementally larger for filings with more information events. Second, the other part of the magnitude increase in announcement returns is that the filings contain more content per information event and more graphical content, refected by the length and number of graphics, respectively. For example, for an average increase in institutional ownership of 9.8%, each additional graphic is associated with an additional 10.5 bps of return reaction.  \n\nWe next investigate the incremental effect of Russell 2000 inclusion on abnormal trading volume around 8-K filings. In Panel B of Table 7, we present estimates for equations 4 and 5 with In AbnormalVolumei, $t$ on the left hand side. These estimation results are consistent with the hypothesis that, on average, inclusion in the Russell 2000 index increases the information content of 8-K filings. Abnormal trading volume increases by 2.9%, on average. As in the return reaction test above, the results refect the two channels by which corporate disclosure policy impacts the information content of 8-K filings. Part of this increase in abnormal trading volume around 8-K announcements is related to an increase in the number of information events contained in each fling and part can be attributed to the increase in content per information event and graphical content.  \n\nTable A3 of the Appendix investigates the time series properties of this effect. We explore the potential for heterogeneous effects before and after the passage of Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg. FD). The results are uniformly larger economically, but statistically different post-Reg. FD only for selective measures. If Reg. FD decreased the prevalence of private information, these results are consistent with private information crowding out or otherwise discouraging public disclosure. We also test for diferences before and after 2004 when the SEC changed the structure of mandatory  \n\n8-K filings to make the items more granular and find that this change does not affect our inferences.  \n\nThe results in this section provide causal support for the effect of two corporate disclosure channels on equity market reactions to corporate disclosure. Combined with the results from Section 3, these results suggest that exogenous increases in institutional ownership are related to more corporate disclosure, higher quality corporate disclosure, and larger equity market reactions to corporate disclosures. These larger reactions occur due to both changes in the number of corporate events disclosed and the tools utilized to disclose information about corporate events. From these results, we can infer that institutional owners demand greater corporate disclosure, which in turn impacts equity market returns and trading volume around corporate announcements.  \n\n## 4.2 Analyst Forecasts and Revisions  \n\nPrior literature has argued that increases in corporate disclosure are refected in analyst forecast accuracy and revisions. Given our regression discontinuity setting, we can investigate the causal effect of changes in corporate disclosure on analyst forecasts and revisions. Furthermore, because the stock market results in the previous section are subject to market microstructure concerns related to index inclusion, it is helpful to look at real outcomes, such as analyst forecast accuracy and revisions, which are directly related to information revelation. Without new valuable information, analysts have no incentive to revise their forecasts. Similarly, incremental disclosure of valuable information should allow analysts to make more accurate forecasts.  \n\nIn this section, we examine the effects of the shift in corporate disclosure policy due to institutional investor demand on equity analysts. For this analysis, we focus on analyst forecast accuracy and the number of forecast revisions per broker in response to 8-K flings. As in the previous section, it is important to first establish that equity analysts condition on the information content of 8-K flings, so we start by examining the relationship between Deviation $^{\\prime}\\imath,t$ ,NumReuisions $^{i,t}$ ,and our measures of 8-K filing characteristics. In the full sample of 1,373,778 8-K filings between 1996 and 2006, we again estimate equation (3), where $Y_{i,t}$ represents $D e v i a t i o n_{i,t}$ Or NumReuisionsi,t and report estimation results in columns (5)-(8) of Table 6.  \n\nThese results suggest that the characteristics of corporate disclosure have an incremental relationship with the information content of 8-K filings. The length, number of items, graphics, and exhibits in 8-K filings are positively correlated with the number of forecast revisions per broker in the five days after 8-K filings and negatively correlated with the absolute deviation of analyst EPS forecasts to actual EPS realizations. On average, an additional graphic embedded in 8-K filings is associated with a 1.6 cents smaller forecast deviation from actual EPS realizations and 0.026 more forecast revisions per broker.  \n\nHaving established that the characteristics of 8-K filings have information content for equity analysts in the sense that their behavior is affected, we turn to the question of whether the index inclusion shock to institutional ownership increases or decreases the incremental information content of 8-K filings and their characteristics for equity analysts. Panel F of Figure 1 shows graphical evidence that inclusion in the Russell 2000 significantly affects behavior. We estimate equation (4) in the full sample of 59,247 firm fiscal quarters between 1996 and 2006 with analyst forecast accuracy and revisions as the dependent variables of interest. Table 8 presents the estimation results. The analyst response to 8-K filings is consistent with higher information content of these filings for firms just added to the Russell 2000 index relative to those just excluded. On average, 8-K filings of firms just added to the Russell 2000 index are associated with a 1.4 cent smaller deviation from actual EPS realizations compared to firms just excluded. Because the average deviation from actual EPS realizations is approximately 5.7 cents in our sample period, the average decrease 24.6% of the mean. Similarly, on average, 8-K flings of firms just added to the Russell 2000 index are associated with 0.32 more revisions per broker in the five days following the filing relative to firms just excluded. Given that the average number of forecast revisions per broker in the five days following 8-K filings is 0.72 during our sample period, this is an average increase of $44.4\\%$  \n\nThe fact that the average equity analyst response to 8-K filings is larger for frms just on the Russell 2000 side of the 1000/2000 threshold is consistent with institutional owners demanding more informative corporate disclosures. We next investigate whether this increase in the information content of corporate disclosures is directly related to the changes in disclosure characteristics that we observe. Consistent with the equity market results in the previous section, we find that equity analysts react to the incremental content per filing. We re-estimate equation (5) with analyst forecast accuracy and revisions as the dependent variables of interest and show the estimation results in Table 8. These results reveal that part of the average increase in analyst reactions to 8-K filing is due to changes in the amount of content disclosed in each filing. The interaction results suggest that increases in institutional ownership are associated with larger per-filing analyst reactions, and also that this reactions is incrementally larger for filings with more information events. Moreover, analyst reactions also increase because filings contain more content per information event and more graphical content, reflected by the length and number of graphics, respectively.  \n\nWhile analyst forecasts provide a measure to examine the index reconstitution-induced variation in the information content of 8-K filings which is less susceptible to market microstructure changes, it does not come without potential confounds. In particular, analyst behavior can yield potential alternative explanations of our results. The common theme of these alternatives is that they depend upon equity analysts having a preference for public information. For example, because analysts and institutional investors interact, the possibility exists that analysts demand disclosure from frms as a mechanism to improve their service to institutional investor clients. This explanation is consistent with the institutional investor monitoring mechanism we describe, but in this explanation, it is proactive analysts that interact with corporations as agents of disclosure for their institutional clients. We believe that these alternatives are unlikely given the growing set of evidence that analysts do not prefer more public disclosure to less. Armstrong et al. [2012] show that analyst following decreases in response to plausibly exogenous increases in financial statement informativeness. In another setting, Xie [2013] shows that though analysts issue public forecasts and recommendations, they provide additional private signals about these recommendations to their best institutional clients, which suggests that analysts extract private information rents from institutional investors. Similarly, Barth et al. [2001] show that analyst following is higher for firms with more intangible assets, which provide more profitable opportunities for private information collection.  \n\nThe results in this section complement the equity market results in providing support for the effect of corporate disclosure on the equity market and analyst reactions to corporate disclosure. These results suggest that exogenous increases in institutional ownership are related to more corporate disclosure, more transparent corporate disclosure, and larger equity market and analyst reactions to corporate disclosures due to changes in the number of corporate events disclosed and the tools utilized to disclose information about corporate events. From these results, we can infer that institutional owners demand greater corporate disclosure, which in turn impacts equity market returns, trading volume, analyst forecast accuracy, and forecast revisions around corporate announcements.  \n\n# 5. Robustness  \n\n## 5.1 Alternative Explanations  \n\nDisclosure is subject to managerial discretion across many dimensions (e.g., materiality, timeliness, content), which means that our inferences are subject to concerns about managerial intent and discretion. For example, institutional investors could be encouraging incremental disclosure for only certain types of information, such as earnings guidance (Boone and White [2015]). There is also some evidence in the literature (e.g. Carter and Soo [1999]) that 8-Ks have not always been filed in a timely manner, though these delays appear to have been mitigated by regulatory oversight from the SEC by the start of our sample, and especially for flings under the new 8-K reporting regime as of 2004. To mitigate remaining concerns about the timeliness and content-specificity of 8-K filings, we present a series of robustness tests to examine the sensitivity of the institutional ownership effect that we document in previous sections to such heterogeneity.  \n\nBefore discussing results from these subsample robustness tests, we note that inferences based on our main specifications are unlikely to be significantly affected by timeliness or content. First, aggregate trends in filing delays cannot explain our results because, by incorporating year fixed effects, our tests exploit only cross-sectional variation in filing characteristics. Second, filing delays should cause attenuation bias for our information content tests. If news gets disseminated to capital markets before the filing, we should observe smaller market and analyst reactions around the 8- K filings themselves. Third, while voluntary disclosure on earnings guidance has been studied (Boone and White [2015]), substitution between 8-K filings and earnings guidance cannot explain our results because we exploit only within-filing-type variation in all of our main specifications by including fling type fixed effects. That is, earnings or financials-related 8-K flings are unlikely to be driving our results because we explicitly control for cross-sectional differences in the information content of filing types.  \n\nTo further address concerns regarding filing timeliness and content, we present additional findings in Table 9 in which we augment our main tests of 8-K fling characteristics and information content by interacting instrumented institutional ownership with dummy variables that identify earnings-related filings (Item 2.02), filings from after the 8-K filing regime change (e.g., Post2004), and filings that contain negative news (e.g., Negative News). Our results show that the interaction terms of institutional ownership with the Item 2.02 dummy are not statistically or economically significant. Hence, the institutional ownership effect on filing characteristics and information content is not systematically different for filings related to earnings, which implies that related findings on managerial guidance (Boone and White [2015]) cannot explain our results. In untabulated tests, we also drop all earnings-related filings and find similar results.  \n\nThe literature has found that filing delays are most likely for filings that contain negative news (Barth et al. [2015], Ma [2015]), so we investigate the institutional ownership effect on 8-K filings that contain negative news in two ways. First, in untabulated results, we separately estimate the filing characteristics and information content tests in the subsample of negative 8-K filings (i.e., those that are met with a negative market reaction as measured by three day cumulative abnormal returns) and find that the results are quantitatively similar in both subsamples. Second, in Table 9, we present results from our tests that augment our baseline specifications by interacting NegativeNews with $I O$ . These tests show that the effect of institutional ownership is significantly larger for negative news for one of the five filing characteristics (e.g., NumItems, which may be evidence of strategic bunching of different pieces of information) and two of the four information content results (e.g., $a b s(C A R)$ and Num Revisions). The lower order $I O$ terms remain statistically and economically significant in all of these regressions, so we omit them in our presentation for brevity. These results further suggest that timeliness is unlikely to be a significant driver of our observed institutional ownership effect.  \n\nFinally, to investigate differences in timeliness between the pre-2004 and post-2004 regime change in 8-K filing rules, we present two sets of results. First, appendix tables A2 and A3 present estimates of our main specifications in pre- and post-2004 subsamples. These results show that the filing characteristics and information content results are economically and statistically similar across Reg. FD and 8-K regime change sample splits. Second, to more rigorously explore differences before and after the 2004 change in 8-K filing rules, we interact Post2004 with $I O$ and present interaction coefficients in Table 9. These results show that none of the effects we study are significantly different after 2004.  \n\nTogether, we believe that this collection of results implies that differential timeliness is not significantly related to the institutional ownership-disclosure relationship we study, and that managerial guidance about earnings, while related to a subset of 8-K filings, cannot explain the broader effects of institutional ownership on disclosure.  \n\n## 5.2 Alternative Specifications  \n\nIn the extant literature that exploits Russell index reconstitutions as an experimental setting, there exist three primary econometric differences in execution. These differences are based on ex ante institutional ownership classifications, Russell index ranks and definitions, and experimental procedures relating to the Russell index discontinuity. In this section, we discuss Table 10, which provides evidence that our disclosure results are generally robust to any combination of these alternative specifications, including those prominently featured in the existing literature (Appel et al. [2016], Boone and White [2015], Chang et al. [2015], Crane et al. [2016]). An additional potential concern is whether Russell's proprietary rank adjustments that occur between the end of May index assignment and the end of June index reconstitution are related to changes in institutional ownership. Russell's adjustments are determined by several characteristics, one of which is the public foat of the firm. As in Crane et al. [2016] and Appel et al. [2016], we find that Russell's rank adjustments do not quantitatively affect our results. In Table 10, we also present results using observed market capitalization ranks based on end of May end-of-day closing prices from CRSP (in columns (2), (4), (6), and (8) titled “May\") and using Russell's end of June rankings (i.e., columns (1), (3), (5), and (7) titled “June\"), which include their proprietary adjustments based on public foat.  \n\nThe frst and most important distinction among existing Russell index reconstitution papers is based on ex ante institutional ownership classifications. Whereas we focus, like Crane et al. [2016], on total institutional ownership in our main tests, another set of papers, including Boone and White [2015], focuses only on quasi-index investors (as defined in Bushee [2001]) or on passive investors (Appel et al. [2016]). We focus on total institutional ownership to avoid the omitted variables problem described in Section 3.1. Second, our focus on total institutional ownership provides more conservative estimates of the marginal effect of institutional ownership on 8-K fling characteristics and market reactions. We interpret these conservative estimates as being generally consistent with the idea that large reduced-form variation in 8-K filing characteristics and market reactions around the Russell index cutoff can be explained by different magnitudes of variation in institutional ownership. A back-of-the-envelope calculation illustrates our intuition. We observe a $9.8\\%$ increase in total institutional ownership and a 6% increase in quasi-indexer ownership (Crane et al. [2016]) at the top of the Russell 2000 index relative to the bottom of the Russell 1000 index. If the cross-sectional variation in total institutional ownership and quasi-indexer ownership around the Russell index threshold is highly correlated, then the coefficient estimates we should expect in the quasi-indexer ownership specifications should be S $).8/6~=~1.63\\$ times larger than in the total institutional ownership specifications simply because the same change in disclosure policies and market reactions are being explained by a smaller change in institutional ownership. Importantly, because both quasi-indexers and other institutional ownership groups react to Russell index reconstitutions, different institutional ownership measures simply attribute the same change in 8-K filing characteristics and information content to different changes in institutional ownership. To be conservative, we ascribe the change in 8-K fling characteristics and information content to the entire change in institutional ownership. In both panels of Table 10, columns (1)-(4) focus on total institutional ownership and columns (5)-(8) focus on quasi-indexers only. These results suggest that our baseline results in Tables 5, 7, and 8 are robust to using ex ante institutional investor classifications.  \n\nThe second key point of differentiation among existing papers that exploit the Russell index reconstitution setting is related to the running variable definition in the regression discontinuity design. In our baseline tests, we follow Crane et al. [2016], which uses observed market capitalization rank as the running variable and constructs polynomial control functions based on these ranks. In Table 10, we present alternative evidence using the methodology of Appel et al. [2016] that uses In Market Cap. as the running variable. Despite the fact that Russell assigns firms to indexes based on observed market capitalization ranks and not total market capitalization, the nonlinear mapping between market capitalization and ranks may impose a misspecified control in tests that use polynomial control functions based on observed market capitalization ranks. In both panels of Table 10, columns (1), (2), (5), and (6) use polynomial control functions based on ln Market Cap. and columns (3), (4), (7) and (8) use polynomial control functions based on market capitalization ranks. The results are quantitatively similar across measures, suggesting that market capitalization rank polynomials are not misspecified.  \n\nThe third key point that differentiates existing work that uses the Russell index reconstitution setting is the use of bandwidth restrictions. Whereas we use global polynomial control functions to Hexibly control for nonlinearities in the conditional expectation function of institutional ownership and market capitalization, others, including Appel et al. [2016], impose a 250 firm bandwidth and use local linear and polynomial control functions. Both methods are accepted in the applied econometrics literature, but we favor global polynomial control functions to both preserve statistical power and to avoid potential overfitting or lack of smoothness in the conditional expectations function of institutional ownership on market capitalization at the boundary (Van der Klaauw [2008]). We present results that use the global polynomials approach in Panel A of Table 10 and results that use the local polynomials approach in Panel B of Table 10. While the sign and economic magnitude of our coefficient estimates are similar in Panel A and Panel B, the lack of statistical power imposed by bandwidth restrictions is apparent in Panel B; fewer of the coefficient estimates are statistically significant at conventional levels. Despite small differences in statistical significance, we view the results in Panel B as quantitatively similar to those in Panel A and, given the degree of similarity, we infer that the global polynomial control functions used in Panel A must appropriately isolate local differences in institutional ownership and disclosure around the Russell index cutoff.  \n\nTogether, the results in Table 10 suggest that the baseline results presented in Tables 5, 7, and 8 are robust to the potential combinations of approaches used in the extant literature which studies the Russell index reconstitution setting. In particular, these results are robust to alternative market capitalization definitions, polynomial control functions based on market capitalization ranks or market capitalization itself, bandwidth restrictions, and ex ante institutional ownership classifications.  \n\n# 6. Conclusion  \n\nIn this paper, we study the preferences of institutional investors over corporate disclosure using novel data on 8-K filings and an experimental setting that takes advantage of quasi-random Russell index reconstitutions. Specifically, we estimate the causal effect of an exogenous shock to institutional ownership on corporate disclosure policy, and then determine whether this change in corporate disclosure has an incremental impact on equity analyst and stock market reactions to corporate disclosures. We find that inclusion in the Russell 2000 has a positive impact on institutional ownership relative to inclusion in the Russell 1000, which, in turn, has a positive impact on the quantity of disclosure. Moreover, the difference in disclosure quantity cannot be fully explained by any change in corporate activity that requires mandatory disclosure because we find that the amount of content per filing, as measured by items, exhibits, length, and embedded graphics, also increases. These exogenous increases in institutional ownership also have positive effects on the quality of disclosure. The average information content of 8-K filing announcements, as measured by absolute cumulative abnormal returns (CAR), increases by a factor of 1.46. Furthermore, this average increase in the stock price reaction is directly related to the increase in the length and number of embedded graphics per 8-K filing. Together, these results suggest that institutional investors demand incremental corporate disclosure and that such disclosure is informative and relevant to capital market participants.  \n\n# References  \n\nBipin Ajinkya, Sanjeev Bhojraj, and Partha Sengupta.

We also show that institutional trading activity is one mechanism by which prices become more efficient, even when institutions trade passively or follow momentum strategies.  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nThe shareholdings and the trading activity of institutional investors have increased dramatically in the past several decades. In 1965, members of the Securities Industries Association held $16\\%$ ofU.s. equities; in 2001, they held $61\\%$ according to the Securities Industry Association Fact Book (2002). Nonretail trading accounted for $96\\%$ of New York Stock Exchange trading volume in 2002 (Jones and Lipson, 2004), but institutional trading activity is generally not publicly disclosed. What does the broadened scope of institutional ownership and trading mean for the quality of equity markets?  \n\nWe examine how institutional holdings and their trading affect the relative informational efficiency of transaction prices, an important dimension of market quality. Analysis of a broad crosssection of NYSE-listed stocks between 1983 and 2004 indicates that greater institutional ownership is associated with greater relative efficiency. Prices of stocks with more institutional ownership tend to move closer to fundamental values, in that they resemble a random walk more closely, than prices of stocks with less institutional ownership. Our evidence suggests that institutions improve a firm’s information environment, and examination of proprietary New York Stock Exchange data reveals that part of this effect can be attributed to institutional trading activity. Our results have important implications for the real economy, because more informative prices facilitate better-informed financing and investment decisions.  \n\nTo construct measures of relative informational efficiency, we assume that informationally efficient transaction prices follow a random walk. Using intra-day transactions data over a 22-year period, we construct several measures of how far transaction prices diverge from this benchmark. Following Hasbrouck (1993), we estimate the dispersion of differences between trade prices and a security's efficient price based on a random-walk decomposition. This approach distinguishes between informed and uninformed trading and uses a vector autoregression model to separate variation of the efficient price (the random walk component of price changes) from variation of a pricing error (the stationary component). Our focus on short-term aspects of informational efficiency is in the spirit of Chordia, Roll, and Subrahmanyam (2005), who find that price adjustments to new information occur substantially within 30 minutes. They attribute this quick adjustment to the activities of “astute traders,” perhaps market makers or arbitrageurs, who can move prices through their trading activity. We build on this insight by focusing on intra-day periods when such activities are likely to take place, and our tests are designed to capture their success.  \n\nTo verify the robustness of our results, we also compute several more traditional and longer-term efficiency measures. Specifically, we estimate how closely prices follow a random walk based on the autocorrelation of quote-midpoint returns at 30-minute and 60-minute horizons and variance ratios up to a monthly horizon. While these measures do not distinguish between informed and uninformed trading, these proxies are useful in establishing robustness and supplemental tests generally support our main results. We also conduct several tests to address the possibility that our results are caused by variation in liquidity. Liquidity is related to efficiency because greater trading costs make arbitrage trades more expensive. As a result, prices should move closer to their fundamental values when markets are more liquid. At the same time, institutions may prefer to hold liquid stocks because they often trade large positions. Therefore, if efficiency and liquidity are sufficiently persistent, a spurious relationship between institutional holdings and efficiency could arise. Our results are not consistent with this view because we explicitly control for variation in liquidity, using a range of proxies and alternate empirical specifications, in all our tests. Moreover, a Granger causality test supports the view that changes in institutional holdings cause changes inefficiency, rather than the converse.  \n\nTo understand the economics behind our findings, we investigate which mechanisms link institutional holdings to price efficiency. The most likely candidate is institutional trading, because microstructure theory predicts that prices adjust to information-motivated order flow (see Glosten and Milgrom, 1985; Kyle, 1985). Our empirical analysis supports this prediction. Based on proprietary daily data on institutional trading, we document that institutional trading makes prices more efficient, controlling for liquidity and other firm characteristics. In addition to these daily results, we create multiple proxies for institutional trading from publicly available data and obtain similar results using the longer, quarterly sample. Consistent with the idea that trading is necessary to move prices back towards their efficient values, we show that trading has a greater effect in stocks that are priced less efficiently during the previous quarter.  \n\nThese results are consistent with the view that institutions have private information about security values and can create arbitrage profits when prices deviate from fundamental values. Because private information is often short-lived, this suggests that the most aggressive trading should improve efficiency the most. However, institutions could also be smart traders in the sense that they can differentiate informed order flow from uninformed order flow. In this case, passive trading that provides liquidity to uninformed traders can improve efficiency because it reduces temporary price moves that are unrelated to changes in fundamentals. We empirically differentiate between aggressive and passive institutional trading and find these differences are of secondary importance; efficiency improves whether institutions trade aggressively or passively. This implies that besides impounding private information, institutions can also make prices more efficient by providing liquidity to other traders whose buying or selling pressure would otherwise cause prices to deviate from their consensus value.  \n\nOur general conclusion that institutional trading improves informational efficiency contrasts with suggestions that institutions move prices away from fundamental values. Several authors present evidence that institutions are positive-feedback traders in that they purchase securities that have recently performed well and sell securities that have performed poorly.? Grossman and Stiglitz (1976) and Hellwig (1980) note such trading practices could be based on rational learning through prices, but others view them as destabilizing (Banerjee, 1992; Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, and Welch, 1992; Welch, 1992). Moreover, the known presence of feedback traders may prompt other investors to trade in a manner that moves prices  \n\nfarther away from their efficient values (DeLong, Shleifer, Summers, and Waldmann, 1990). In a direct test of the effect that positive-feedback trading has on efficiency, we find no evidence that quarterly momentum trading makes prices noisier. In fact, momentum trading has a stronger efficiency-enhancing effect than do contrarian strategies.?  \n\nIn addition to institutional trading, the level of their holdings has a direct effect on efficiency that is very robust throughout our analysis. We explore three potential explanations for this somewhat surprising finding. First, institutional holdings may directly lead to information production. Individual institutions could engage in information production once their holdings exceed a certain threshold. This suggests that, all else equal, more concentrated holdings should be associated with a greater effect on efficiency. In contrast, Holden and Subrahmanyam (1992) show that greater competition among strategic informed traders leads to faster incorporation of private information. Thus, to the extent that institutions are privy to information, efficiency will improve through intensified competition among a number of institutions. Second, Brennan and Subrahmanyam (1995) show that institutional investment prompts a greater analyst following. The additional information produced by these analysts could then be responsible for enhanced informational efficiency. Third, institutional holdings are often regarded as a proxy for the supply of lendable shares (see, for example, Nagel 2005). A greater supply allows more short selling to take place, which tends to be informed and efficiency enhancing (see Boehmer, Jones, and Zhang 2007 and Wu 2007).  \n\nOur results support Holden and Subrahmanyam's (1992) prediction in that the efficiencyenhancing effect is stronger when institutional ownership is less concentrated, even when controlling for the effect of their trading activity. This suggests that in competing for profitable trading opportunities, institutions generate more information that is ultimately impounded into prices. In tests of the remaining two hypotheses, we find no evidence that increased analyst coverage makes prices more efficient, but document that short selling has a strong efficiency-enhancing effect. Neither of these variables, however, drives out the effect that institutional holdings (or trading) has on the informational efficiency of prices.  \n\nOur study complements a rich literature on the role that institutions play in equity markets. Earlier papers provide evidence that institutions indeed have privileged information in that their trading predicts future abnormal returns, but there is only indirect evidence on whether their activities lead to more informationally efficient pricing.d Greater institutional ownership is associated with lower post-earnings announcement drift (Bartov, Radhakrishnan, and Krinsky, 2oo0) and institutions tend to move prices more than other traders, consistent with faster incorporation of information (Sias, Starks, and Titman, 2006). Returns on portfolios with high institutional holdings lead those of portfolios with low holdings (Badrinath, Kale, and Noe, 1995; Sias and Starks, 1997). Sias and Starks (1997) also document a positive relationship between institutional investments and daily return autocorrelations. We build on these findings by directly investigating how institutional holdings and actual institutional trading affect the informational efficiency of transaction prices.  \n\nThe remainder of this study is organized as follows. In section I, we present our data sources and the measures of relative informational efficiency we use. In Section Il, we describe our main empirical tests. Section IV investigates potential mechanisms that link institutional shareholdings and trading to the efficiency of transaction prices. Section V concludes the paper.  \n\n## II. Data and variables  \n\nWe use intra-day trade and quote data to compute measures of the relative informational efficiency of prices. For securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), these data are available from the Institute for the Study of Security Markets (ISSM) between 1983 and 1992 and fron the NYSE's Trade and Quote (TAQ) database between 1993 and 2004. We match all TAQ/ISSM securities to those in the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) database on a monthly basis and, individually for each month, select all NYSE-listed domestic common stocks as the initial sample. Next, we obtain all primary market prices and quotes from TAQ/ISSM that satisfy certain criteria.? For each stock, we aggregate all trades during the same second that execute at the same price and retain only the last quote for every second if multiple quotes were issued. For records between 1983 and 1998, we assume that trades are reported five seconds late and adjust time stamps accordingly. Afterwards, we assume no reporting delay and make no time adjustment (Lee and Ready, 1991; Bessembinder, 2003). Finally, we require that each security have at least 200 transactions per month (we obtain qualitatively identical results when we require only 100 trades per month). This leaves an average cross-sectional sample of 1,138 securities per month. The cross-section grows over time; the mean number of securities increases from 879 during the first half of the sample period, 1983-1993, to 1,396 in the second half, 1994-2004 (see Panel A of Table 1).  \n\n### I1.1 The relative informational efficiency of prices  \n\nOur focus is on explaining the relative informational efficiency of transaction prices, rather than testing whether markets are efficient in an absolute sense. We define relative efficiency as how closely the time series of transaction prices resembles a random walk. This approach allows continuous arrival of information and order flow, as well as market frictions that drive a temporary wedge between transaction prices and fundamental values. A departure from fundamental value represents an arbitrage opportunity that traders can exploit when transaction costs are sufficiently low. Intuitively, we are interested in how quickly such opportunities disappear or, alternatively, how much prices can be expected to diverge from their fundamental value before any particular decision to trade (see Lo, 2004, on “the adaptive markets hypothesis\"). As suggested by Chordia, Roll, and Subrahmanyam (2005), we assume that these decisions are made by astute traders who follow market activity in real time. To capture the influence of such traders on prices, we require a metric that reflects trade-to-trade changes in the gap between prices and fundamental values and largely rely on the high-frequency methodology developed in Hasbrouck (1993). We conduct extensive robustness tests using lower-frequency measures based on autocorrelations and varianceratios.°  \n\n#### 11.1.1 Pricing errors  \n\nHasbrouck (1993) decomposes the (log) transaction price, $p_{t},$ into a random walk component, $m_{t},$ and a transitory pricing error, $s_{t}$ Wwhere $t$ indexes transaction time:  \n\n$$\np_{t}{=}m_{t}{+}s_{t}.\n$$  \n\nThe unobservable random walk component is termed the efficient price as it represents the expectation of security value. Its innovations reflect new public information as well as the information content of order flow, allowing market makers to react to private information revealed by orders from better-informed traders. The pricing error, which captures temporary deviations from the efficient price, may arise from the non-information-related portion of transaction costs, order imbalances, price discreteness, and dealer inventory effects. It is assumed to follow a zero-mean covariance-stationary process but may be serially correlated or correlated with the random walk innovation of the efficient price process. Because the pricing error has a mean of zero, its standard deviation, $\\sigma_{s},$ is a measure of its magnitude. Intuitively, $\\sigma_{s}$ describes how closely transaction prices follow the efficient price over time, and can therefore be interpreted as an (inverse) measure of informational efficiency.  \n\nWe follow Hasbrouck and estimate a lower bound for $\\sigma_{s}$ using a VAR system over $\\{r_{t},\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}\\}$ , where $r_{t}$ is the first difference of $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{p}}_{t}$ and $\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}$ is a vector of explanatory variables whose innovations relate to innovations in $m_{t}$ and $s_{t}$ . Specifically, we impose the identification restriction that innovations in $s_{t}$ must be correlated with $\\{r_{t},\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}\\}$ , and obtain the estimate of $\\sigma_{s}$ from the vector moving average representation of the VAR system (Beveridge and Nelson 1981). The VAR has five lags, where $x_{t}$ is defined as a three-byone vector of the trade variables: (1) a trade sign indicator, (2) signed trading volume, and (3) the signed square root of trading volume. This structure of $x_{t}$ allows for a concave relationship between prices and the trade series.  \n\nWe use all trade observations except when reported prices differ by more than $30\\%$ from the previous price, which we consider to be erroneous and eliminate from the sample. To sign trades, we assume that a trade is buyer-initiated if the price is above the prevailing quote midpoint (and sellerinitiated for the converse). Midpoint trades are not signed, but we include them in the estimation (with $\\mathbf{\\DeltaX}{=}0$ ). To eliminate overnight price changes, we restart each process at the beginning of each trading day.  \n\nInitially we estimate $\\sigma_{s}$ monthly and then use mean values for each stock-quarter (because institutional holdings are reported quarterly). For subsequent tests involving daily institutional trading, we re-estimate $\\sigma_{s}$ on a daily basis. To assure meaningful estimates in this case, we only include stock-days with at least 100 trades per day for each day and stock. Panel B of Table 1 shows that this fiter slightly reduces the size of the daily sample to 957 stocks on an average day. To reduce the influence of outliers. we eliminate from both samples pricing errors that exceed the standard deviation of transaction prices (less than $0.1\\%$ of the observations).  \n\nHenceforth, we use $V(s)$ or “pricing error' to refer to $\\sigma_{s}$ . To assure meaningful comparisons, we normalize $V(s)$ by the standard deviation of (log) transaction prices, $V(p)$ , in univariate tests and use $V(p)$ as a regressor in multivariate tests.  \n\n#### I1.1.2  Autocorrelations and variance ratios  \n\nIf prices follow a random walk, the return autocorrelation at all frequencies should be zero. Because both negative and positive autocorrelation represent departures from a random walk, we use their absolute value as a measure of relative efficiency. Unlike Hasbrouck's (1993) pricing error, which incorporates the price effect of trade reversals as an integral component, a simple autocorrelation measure cannot distinguish price changes due to trade reversal from price changes due to new information. Thus, we construct returns based on quote midpoints to abstract from bid-ask bounce. Then we compute monthly midpoint autocorrelations based on returns measured over 5-, 10-, 20-, 30-, and 60-minute intervals. We exclude overnight returns and periods without quote change to avoid using stale quotes in thesecomputations.  \n\nEarly studies of market efficiency use variance ratios to test whether prices follow a random walk (examples are Barnea, 1974; and Hasbrouck and Schwartz, 1988). A random walk implies that the ratio of long-term to short-term return variances, measured per unit time, equals one. Because we are interested in the gap between actual and efficient prices in either direction, we compute $\\left|1-V R(n,m)\\right|$ , where $V R(n,m)$ is the ratio of the quote midpoint return variance over m periods to the return variance over $n$ periods, both divided by the length of the period. To compute the variance ratios, we sample quote midpoint returns at the appropriate frequencies over a calendar quarter and compute the variance using overlapping observations. For example, to compute the variance of 20-day returns over a quarter with 64 trading days, we use the 44 returns that are based entirely on days within this quarter. We consider intra-day measures based on ratios of (5,30), (5,60), (10,30), and (10,60) minutes, and longer horizons based on (1,5), (1,10), (1,20), and (5,20) days. The results based on these measures are qualitatively similar, and we concentrate on $|1{-}V R(1{,}10)|$ and $|1-V R(1,20)|$ expressed in trading days.?  \n\n#### I1.1.3 Descriptive statistics on measures of relative efficiency  \n\nPanel A of Table 1 provides descriptive statistics on the main relative efficiency measures. The mean quarterly (log) pricing error as well as the mean pricing error standardized by the standard deviation of transaction prices, $V(s)/V(p)$ , decline over time. It is important that both exhibit sizeable cross-sectional variation. Similar to the pricing error, the absolute value of 30-minute midpoint autocorrelation, $\\vert A R3\\theta\\vert$ declines during the sample period. Results based on 30-minute autocorrelations are representative of autocorrelations computed over alternate frequencies (not shown for brevity). Finally, Panel A shows two representative measures based on 10-day and 20-day variance ratios, $|1{-}V R(1{,}10)|$ and $|1-V R(1,20)|$ .The gap between the variance ratios and one, the value implied by a random walk, decreases over time, although at a lower rate than for the other efficiency measures.  \n\nFigure 1 shows the time series properties of $V(s)/V(p)$ in more detail. The four lines correspond to the cross-sectional mean, median, $25^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile, and $75^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile. The vertical bars measure one crosssectional standard deviation in each direction. This plot allows several interesting observations about $V(s)/V(p)$ . First, despite a gradual decline, there is persistent cross-sectional variation, and some variation over time. Second, the series appears well behaved in that the mean is close to the median, and the quartiles tend to lie within one standard deviation. Third, the series mirrors some developments in the market in a reasonable fashion. For example, the pricing error increases around the 1987 market crash and around the market closure during the week after September 11, 2001. We see substantial declines around the change to $\\$1/16$ pricing in 1997 and the change to decimal pricing in the first quarter of 2001. Both events result in finer pricing grids that reduce the effects of price discreteness, which is one component of the pricing error.\\*  \n\n### 11.1.4 Discussion  \n\nEach of our relative efficiency measures captures the degree to which security prices depart from a random walk, but they differ in their underlying assumptions and timing conventions. While we use the full range of measures to demonstrate robustness, we favor pricing errors over the other measures for two main reasons. First, only V(s) differentiates between permanent price changes that are due to information and temporary price changes that are due to market frictions. This generates the desirable property that only non-information-based (i.e., transient) price changes are atributed to departures from a random walk. The other measures of relative efficiency, based on quote midpoint return autocorrelations and  \n\nvariance ratios, do not distinguish between information-related and unrelated price changes. Deviation from a random walk implied by these measures could be induced by inefficient pricing as well as efficient price discovery. For example, if informed traders split their orders over time, prices gradually approach their consensus values. This will induce positive autocorrelation (and variance ratios deviating from one) even when all publicly available information is efficiently processed. Expected pricing errors would be zero in this example as long as the price changes associated with the individual orders are not quickly reversed.  \n\nSecond, pricing errors are measured in trade time —-the model is advanced by one period after each trade— while autocorrelations and variance ratios are based on returns computed in clock time. Measuring relative efficiency in trade time seems preferable because periods of active information discovery receive more weight. Moreover, the trade-time measure reflects actual behavior of market participants and includes the information conveyed by each single trade. The clock-time measures, especially the longer-term variance ratios, ignore much of the variation in transaction prices that we are interested in. For example, if deviations from efficient prices were always corrected within a trading day, variance ratios based on longer than one-day horizons would ignore them completely. In this sense, the longer-term measures are noisy measures of the relative efficiency of prices.  \n\nComputing pricing errors does, however, require that we model the unobserved random walk component, which is used as a benchmark to estimate pricing errors. This may be problematical, as Hasbrouck points out, if prices do not follow a random walk at lower frequencies (Fama and French, 1988; Lo and MacKinlay, 1988; Poterba and Summers, 1988). If temporary deviations from the efficient price take too long to correct, the variance decomposition will erroneously attribute deviations to changes in the efficient price, and thereby understate pricing errors.? Two important features of our analysis mitigate these concerns. Most importantly, we do not use pricing errors to make inferences about informational efficiency in an absolute sense. We are interested in the relative efficiency of prices, which we could reinterpret as the efficiency relative to a prevailing consensus, rather than some absolute benchmark such as a fundamental security value. Moreover, most of our tests focus on the cross-section of stocks. Unless measurement errors implied by longer-term deviations from fundamentals are highly systemati across socks, our inferences should not be unreasonably ensitiv to these concens.lo  \n\n### I1.2 Quarterly institutional ownership  \n\nThe 1978 amendment to the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 requires all institutional investors managing a portfolio with an investment value of $\\$100$ million or more to file quarterly 13-f reports with the SEC. These reports, available in the Thomson/CDA Spectrum database, reveal institutions? long equity positions greater than 10,000 shares or $\\$200,000$ in market value. To construct the fraction of institutional ownership for a particular stock, we aggregate shares held across all reporting institutions and scale by the number of shares outstanding at the end of the quarter as reported by CRSP. This “quarterly sample” extends from 1983 to 2004 and forms the basis for most of our empirical tests. Panel A of Table 1 reports summary statistics on quarterly standardized institutional holdings, $I O$ Mean holdings are $51\\%$ , but increase markedly from $44\\%$ during the first half of the sample period to $57\\%$ during the second half. This increase is accompanied by a slight increase in cross-sectional dispersion, from $18\\%$ to $21\\%$  \n\n### I1.3 Daily institutional trading  \n\nMeasuring institutional holdings or portfolio changes at the quarterly horizon can mask important details about their short-term activities (see Campbell, Ramadorai, and Schwartz 2007). In addition, actual institutional trading volume is not disclosed in the 13-f data. To overcome these issues, we use a \"daily sample” based on proprietary data from the New York Stock Exchange that allows us to infer  \n\nactual daily institutional trading volume.1 The data are based on the NYSE's Consolidated Audit Trail Data (CAUD) between January 2000 and April 2004, which provide information on nearly all trades executed at the NYSE. CAUD are the result of matching trade reports to the underlying order data; they show for each trade the individual buy and sell orders executed against each other (or market maker interest). Each component is identified by an account type variable that gives some information on trader identity. Providing the account type classification is mandatory for brokers (although it is not audited by the NYSE on a regular basis). Several different regulatory requirements include obligations to indicate: orders that are part of program trades, index arbitrage program trades, specialist trades, and orders from market makers in the stock who operate at other trading venues. Each of these categories is further divided into proprietary member trades, trades by retail customers, and agency trades.  \n\nWe aggregate buy and sell share volume separately for each day and security for certain combinations of account types. We exclude trades that are cancelled or later corrected, trades with special settlement conditions, and trades outside regular market hours. To create a proxy for institutional trading, we take all trades except those marked as retail, other market maker proprietary, specialist, or program trades.12 Panel B in Table 1 reports time-series means of daily cross-sectional averages for characteristics of institutional trading. On average, daily institutional trading amounts to $0.6\\%$ of shares outstanding and $57\\%$ of daily volume. While not shown in the table, the remaining $43\\%$ of trading volume are due to program trading $(23\\%)$ , specialist trading $(16\\%)$ , and retail trading $(4\\%)$  \n\n### 11.4 Control variables  \n\nWe use several variables to control for security-specific characteristics or market conditions. From CRSP, we obtain market capitalization, consolidated trading volume, turnover, and daily closing prices. Following Chordia, Roll, and Subrahmanyam (2000), we compute trade-weighted effective spreads and time-weighted quoted spreads and depths from TAQ/ISSM. Effective spreads are computed as twice the absolute difference between the execution price and the quote midpoint prevailing when the trade was reported (or five seconds earlier during 1983-1998). Quoted spreads are the difference between ask and bid prices, weighted by the duration for which a quote is valid. We compute relative spreads by dividing dollar spreads by the prevailing quote midpoint. Dollar Depth is the sum of shares offered at the bid and the ask, weighted by the duration for which a quote is valid.  \n\nPanel A of Table 1 shows descriptive statistics on each of these variables for the quarterly sample, computed as time series averages of quarterly cross-sectional means and standard deviations. RES, the relative effective spread, declines from 79 basis points in the first half of the sample to 47 bp in the second half. The last two columns show that the cross-sectional dispersion of RES is also reduced over time. We observe a similar development for RQS, the relative quoted spread, but quoted depth declines at well. Average quarterly trading volume more than triples from one period to the next, turnover increases by about one third, and average market value more than doubles. In each of these cases, the crosssectional dispersion widens over time as well. Mean share price fluctuates around $\\$31$ over theentire period.  \n\n### 11.5 Correlations with institutional ownership  \n\nWe now provide the first glimpse of the relation between institutional ownership and efficiency. At the beginning of each quarter, we divide the sample into market value quintiles that are further divided into three groups based on the $30^{\\mathrm{th}}$ and $70^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile of institutional holdings. We report averages of the quarterly cross-sectional means in Table 2. Importantly, after controlling for size, each of the five efficiency measures declines monotonically with institutional holdings. That is, efficiency increases with institutional holdings.  \n\nTable 2 also reports on our control variables. Institutions tend to hold more shares in larger stocks, but after controlling for firm size, there is no systematic relationship between trading volume and holdings. Greater institutional holdings are also associated with greater liquidity, as measured by relative effective spreads. Similar patterns hold for other liquidity proxies (not shown). In the next section, we turn to a multivariate regression framework in order to examine how institutional investors affect efficiency while controlling for these relationships.  \n\n## IⅢI. The relationship between efficiency and institutional holdings  \n\nWe now explore the relation between $I O$ and efficiency in a multivariate context. The next section details our main empirical methodology. We then demonstrate a strong positive relation between $I O$ and efficiency (Section II.2). Finally, we carefully consider causality and the role of liquidity in explaining this relationship (Section IIl.3).  \n\n### II1.1 Regression methodology  \n\nTo study the relation between relative efficiency and institutional holdings in a multivariate framework, we estimate the following cross-sectional regression each quarter:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{R E_{\\it{i t}}=\\alpha_{\\it{t}}+\\beta_{\\it{t}}I O_{\\it{i,t-1}}+\\delta_{\\it{t}}R E_{\\it{i,t-1}}+\\sum_{\\it{k}=1}^{\\it{K}}\\gamma_{\\it{k t}}X_{\\it{k i,t-1}}+\\varepsilon_{\\it{i t}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $R E_{i t}$ is an estimate of the relative informational efficiency for firm $i$ during quarter $t$ (note that all efficiency measures we use are inversely related to the degree of efficiency); $I O_{i,t-I}$ is the fraction of institutional ownership in firm $i$ at the end of quarter $t{-}I$ ; and $X_{k}$ is a set of control variables. Throughout the analysis, we use explanatory variables lagged by one period to reduce the potential effect of variation in efficiency on contemporaneous explanatory variables, especially institutional holdings or trading. The lagged explanatory variables can be interpreted as instruments for the corresponding current values, and our results remain qualitatively unchanged using current regressors.  \n\nWe draw inferences from the time series of these estimated coefficients (over 87 quarters), using Newey-West (1987) general method of moments standard errors to compute test statistics. We use four lags, but the results are not sensitive to assuming a different lag structure. This general approach addresses several issues that commonly plague similar estimations. First, estimating separate regressions for each period minimizes the adverse effect of correlation across securities. Second, applying the Newey  \n\nWest estimator to the time series of estimated coefficients allows coefficient variances to change over time. Third, the approach allows coefficients to be autocorrelated.13  \n\nWe include the lagged dependent variable because the time series of efficiency measures are relatively persistent and we want to make sure that the attendant autocorrelation does not affect our estimates. Moreover, institutions could conceivably base their investment decisions during quarter $t{-}1$ On the prevailing degree of efficiency during that quarter. Including lagged efficiency as a control variable should capture part of the variation in holdings that is caused by contemporaneous variation in efficiency. We more fully explore the possibility of reverse causality in section Il.3.2 below.  \n\nFinally, $V(s)$ depends on variation in transaction prices and should, therefore, either be normalized by $V(p)$ Or $V(p)$ should be included as a regressor. We use the standard deviation of transaction prices, $V(p)$ , as a control because it imposes fewer restrictions, but obtain qualitatively identical results using the ratio as a dependent variable. We do not include a volatility control in the autocorrelation or variance ratio tests, because both are, by definition, already scaled by a volatility measure.  \n\n#### II1.2 Quarterly regression results  \n\nTable 3 presents our main result. We regress efficiency on previous-quarter institutional ownership standardized by shares outstanding $(I O)$ , controls, and lagged efficiency. Regardless of how we measure relative efficiency, $I O$ has a significantly negative average coefficient, controlling for effective spreads, firm size, price, and volatility (where appropriate). Thus, larger institutional holdings are associated with smaller price deviations from a random walk and hence greater informational efficiency. While we present results using $\\ln V(s),\\ln\\vert A R30\\vert,\\vert1-V R(1,10)\\vert$ and $|1-V R(1,20)|$ as dependent variables, our results are not sensitive to variations in the timing, specification, or functional form of the efficiency measure.4 1 Lookin t the contro ariables,th picing eror declines with share prce but the sign on market value depends on the efficiency measure. Execution costs, RES, have a significantly positive coefficient in each model. This is consistent with the intuitive economic explanation that higher execution costs make arbitrage more expensive, allowing prices to move farther from fundamental values. Moreover, the presence of the liquidity control helps us to isolate efficiency improvements beyond those that are atributable to lower transaction costs. 16  \n\n### III.3 Interpretation  \n\nTable 3 establishes a robust relation between IO and efficiency, but the evidence is insufficient to infer that institutions cause prices to be more efficient. Institutions could prefer to hold stocks that are more efficient. Alternatively, they may select stocks based on a characteristic that is correlated with future efficiency. Both of these scenarios would result in a positive relationship between efficiency and institutional holdings, but institutional holdings would not cause greater efficiency. In this section, we consider these possibilities and provide evidence that causality does in fact run from $I O$ to efficiency.  \n\n#### II1.3.1 Liquidity effects vs. institutional holding effects  \n\nThe ability of arbitrageurs to reduce mispricing depends crucially on a stock's liquidity: the less liquid a stock is, the lower are the rewards to eliminating mispricing. Therefore, more liquid stocks should be more efficiently priced. This has implications for the relation between holdings and efficiency. If  \n\ninstitutions are attracted to more liquid stocks (see Table 2) and liquidity is relatively persistent, the results in Table 3 could be driven by a form of reverse causality. That is, institutions may hold stocks with relatively efficient prices simply because such stocks are more liquid. This possibility warrants careful controls for the relationship between liquidity and efficiency. Since our tests in Table 3 consider only a single proxy for liquidity, RES, and only a linear functional form, additional analyses are needed to address these concerns.  \n\nWe first investigate whether the result in Table 3 is specific to RES as a proxy for liquidity. We estimate regressions that are identical except for the liquidity proxy. Specifically, we replace RES with one of the following four measures: effective spreads measured in dollars $(E S)$ , quoted spreads measured in dollars $(Q S)$ , relative quoted spreads $(R Q S)$ , and $\\mathcal{Q}S$ divided by the quoted depth (quoted spreads and depths are time weighted). Panel A in Table 4 reports the average coefficients on $I O$ and the liquidity measures (the regressions include the same controls as those in Table 3 but we do not tabulate their coefficients). Similar to Table 3, greater $I O$ is always associated with significantly greater efficiency - the way in which we measure liquidity has no effect on our main result.  \n\nNext, we use a double sort on liquidity and $I O$ to ascertain that variation in $I O$ affects efficiency beyond the direct effect that liquidity has on efficiency. In contrast to the regressions in Table 3, this approach allows for a non-linear relationship between efficiency and both liquidity and $I O$ . We divide the sample into quintiles based on RES that are further divided into three groups based on the $30^{\\mathrm{th}}$ and $70^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile of $I O$ . Panel B in Table 4 reports the relative pricing errors for this double sort. As expected, efficiency increases monotonically with liquidity. But more importantly, efficiency also increases monotonically with $I O$ within each liquidity quintile. This result is not specific to RES as a liquidity measure - we obtain similar results using the other measures from Panel A (not reported). This suggests that institutional holdings have an effect on efficiency that is orthogonal to the liquidity effect.  \n\nOur analysis so far is in terms of levels; if both efficiency and $I O$ were subject to trends, spurious relationships could arise. To address this concern, we relate changes in liquidity and $I O$ to changes in efficiency. More precisely, we first sort the sample stocks into those that experience liquidity increases and those experiencing liquidity decreases between quarters $t{-}1$ and $t$ . Then we split each group into small and large changes at their respective medians. Second, we sort each of the four groups into increases and decreases in $I O$ during quarter $t$ Again, we divide both into large and small changes. Finally, we compute the efficiency change between quarter $t{-}1$ and $_{t+1}$ for each of these groups. We repeat this exercise for four different liquidity measures. When liquidity is measured with RES and RQS, we use $V(s)/V(p)$ to measure efficiency; when liquidity is measured in dollars (ES and $Q S$ ), we use In(s) as the efficiency variable.  \n\nPanel C of Table 4 reports the results for large (above group median) changes in liquidity and $I O$ For changes in relative spread measures, we document strong liquidity effects - increases in relative spreads reduce efficiency and decreases improve efficiency. This effect is absent for the dollar spread measures, probably because the test does not control for the price level. But the more noteworthy result is that increases in $I O$ lead to significantly greater efficiency improvements than decreases in $I O$ , holding constant the change in liquidity. This result is consistent across liquidity measures. Moreover, an increase in institutional holdings improves efficiency even when liquidity worsens. This again suggests that the $I O$ effect is distinct from the liquidity effect and that our results are not sensitive to the way in which we control for variation in liquidity.17  \n\n#### II1.3.2 Reverse causality  \n\nTo empirically address the direction of causality, we exploit the time-series dimension of our sample and use a Granger causality test. Specifically, we run time series regressions for each firm having at least 40 quarterly observations and report mean coefficients. Corresponding to the cross-sectional analysis, we first model the change in efficiency as a linear function of lagged changes in $I O$ efficiency, RES, and market value. Panel A of Table 5 presents regression estimates for the four efficiency measures used previously. Increases in $I O$ are always associated with next-quarter increases in efficiency and are statistically significant when we use pricing errors or short-run autocorrelations to measure efficiency.  \n\nNext, we regress changes in $I O$ on lagged changes in $I O$ efficiency, RES, and market value to model reverse causality. Panel B shows that changes in $I O$ are not related to past changes in efficiency. In fact, the (in) efficiency coefficients are all positive, which is the opposite of what would expect if institutions increase holdings when efficiency improves. We repeat the experiments from Table 5 with our other four liquidity measures and find qualitatively similar results (not reported). These results suggest that $I O$ causes efficiency and not vice versa.  \n\n## IV. How do institutions improve efficiency?  \n\nOur analysis shows that the relative efficiency of prices increases with institutional share holdings. To understand the economic mechanisms that drive this result, we explore potential avenues through which institutions could influence this key dimension of market quality. We begin our analysis with the most plausible candidate, institutional trading activity, and establish that it is one channel through which institutions improve efficiency. Then we take a closer look and assess the importance of active and passive trading. We investigate whether the efficiency-enhancing effect is limited to aggressive strategies and shed some light on the role of private information in this respect. We also provide some evidence on how the effect of trading differs across stocks. Finally, we consider three channels that can link institutional holdings per se to efficiency: increased information production through greater ownership concentration, better analyst coverage, and more short selling through a greater supply of lendable shares.  \n\n### IV.1 The role of institutional trading activity  \n\nWe begin by looking at the quantity traded by institutions, which we can directly observe in the daily sample. We estimate efficiency on a daily basis and use daily cross-sectional regressions of lnV(s) on lagged institutional trading, lagged daily controls for price volatility, relative effective spreads, volume-weighted average price, and prior-quarter controls for market value and institutional holdings. We use two different measures of institutional trading activity, one standardized by shares outstanding and another standardized by total volume. Panel A of Table 6 shows average daily regression coefficients and significance levels based on Newey- West standard errors. As in Table 3, lower execution costs, higher share price, larger market capitalization, and less price volatility are associated with smaller pricing errors. The coefficient on institutional trading is significantly negative in both models, suggesting that trading is one mechanism by which institutions affect the quality of prices. Even at the daily frequency, however, trading does not drive out the effect of institutional holdings ${}-I O$ coefficients remain significant. This is a somewhat surprising result, because it implies that holdings have an effect on efficiency that goes beyond the effect of trading activity. We will return to this finding in Section IV.4.18  \n\nThe daily sample covers only a little more than four years and we would like to corroborate our estimates using the longer, quarterly sample. Because we cannot directly measure institutional trading for the quarterly sample, we use the daily sample to identify publicly observable proxies for institutional trading. Based on the CAUD data, we create three quarterly measures of actual institutional trading in each stock: lnlvol, the (log) level of institutional volume; Ivol/Shrout, the level standardized by shares outstanding; and Ivol/Totvol, the level as a fraction of total volume (results are qualitatively identical for dollar-based volume measures). Then we use these variables to validate quarterly proxies for institutional activity that can be computed from 13-f or CRSP data. From CRSP, we consider the (log) level of trading volume and turnover (share volume scaled by shares outstanding). From the 13-f data, we sum absolute changes in holdings across all institutions to obtain a lower bound of shares traded by institutions. For this variable, we consider the level, the level scaled by shares outstanding, and the level scaled by share Volume.19  \n\nPanel B of Table 6 shows average quarterly cross-sectional correlations over the 2000-2004 time period between the three CAUD-based trading measures (rows) and the potential quarterly proxies (first five columns) along with $I O$ . In terms of levels, institutional volume is highly correlated with the 13-f based measure ( $\\scriptstyle(\\mathrm{p}{=}0.92)$ o, but it is even more correlated with total trading volume $\\left(\\mathrm{\\uprho{=}0.97}\\right.\\mathrm{.}$ 0.When standardized by shares outstanding, the correlations are 0.44 (13-f) and 0.63 (CRSP). Therefore, measures based on changes in 13-f holdings and total volume do well as institutional trading proxies when expressed either as levels or as turnover. In contrast, changes in institutional holdings standardized by total volume are completely unrelated to actual institutional trading. A potential reason is that this variable is constructed as the ratio of two variables that by themselves are excellent proxies for institutional trading, so that the resulting ratio is invariant to changes in it. Finally, we note that $I O$ is moderately correlated with the CAUD-based variables. Thus, it too represents a noisy proxy for institutional trading.  \n\nArmed with four workable proxies, we now estimate model (2) augmented by an institutional trading proxy using the quarterly sample. Based on the results in Panel B, we alternatively use volume, the sum of absolute holdings changes, or the corresponding variables scaled by shares outstanding as trading proxies. We report the coefficients for $I O$ and institutional trading in Panel C of Table 6 (the other coefficients in model (2) are estimated but not reported). Similar to the daily results, we find that more institutional trading significantly enhances efficiency. Again, $I O$ retains its effect on efficiency, though its coefficient declines modestly from the levels reported in Table 3. These results are consistent across the four trading measures and across the four measures of efficiency.  \n\n### IV.2 What type of institutional trading affects efficiency?  \n\nThe evidence in the prior section reveals that institutional trading is positively related to efficiency. This is a strong result, because our institutional trading measures aggregate the activities of a large number of institutions with heterogeneous trading motives and trading strategies. In this section, we attempt to exploit this heterogeneity to better understand the economic mechanism by which institutions affect efficiency. We begin by differentiating between active and passive trading. Then, we explore the consequences of positive-feedback trading. Finally, we test whether the trading of institutions with strong past performance has a different effect on efficiency than the trading of institutions with weak past performance.  \n\nInstitutional order flow can affect efficiency in at least two ways. First, institutions could trade actively on private information. This involves identifying mispriced stocks and then submitting orders in the appropriate direction. Because institutions need to trade before their private information becomes impounded into prices by competing traders, they must use marketable orders that demand liquidity and execute quickly. In this case, information-based theories of market microstructure predict that prices change in response to the private information revealed by the institutions order flow (Glosten and Milgrom 1985, Kyle 1985).  \n\nSecond, institutions may not have access to private information about fundamentals but instead be smart traders who can differentiate temporary (uninformed) from permanent (informed) price changes. This would enable these institutions to profit from trading passively. For example, if several large, uninformed buy orders arrive contemporaneously, prices will increase temporarily to induce more sellers to participate in the market (see Chan and Lakonishok, 1993). If institutions are better able than other traders to recognize these buyers as uninformed, they can gain by providing liquidity (trading passively) and closing their position once the buying pressure subsides. To implement this strategy, institutions would place limit orders around the current price when they perceive price movements as uninformed.  \n\nThese limit orders would supply liquidity to the uninformed traders and thereby reduce temporary deviations from fundamental value. As a result, this strategy enhances efficiency. Of course, institutions that have private information can use this passive strategy as well (see Bloomfield, O'Hara, and Saar 2005).20  \n\nThese arguments suggest that both active and passive trading strategies can have an effect on price efficiency. We use two different approaches to distinguish empirically between active and passive trading. Using the daily sample, we separately observe institutional buying and selling. Because negative return days arise due to overall selling pressure, institutional buying on those days is likely to provide liquidity (implying a passive trading strategy). Similarly, institutional selling provides liquidity on positive return days. In contrast, if institutions trade in the same direction as the return, their trading can be interpreted as liquidity demanding (implying an aggressive trading strategy). A second way of classifying trades relies on a stock's order imbalance. We estimate daily imbalances from TAQ as the number of shares bought net of shares sold, where trade direction is determined using Lee and Ready's (1991) algorithm. Institutions trade “\"with\" the market if they buy on days with positive trade imbalance or sell on days with negative imbalance. These trades are likely to be aggressive and demand liquidity. In contrast, trades “against’ the market are likely to provide liquidity. In both approaches, we use separate variables for buys and sells because prior work shows that buys tend to be more informative than sells.21  \n\nThe first model in Panel A of Table 7 presents the return-based analysis. Both aggressive and passive trading significantly improves efficiency. There is little difference between the effect of buys and sells, but the effect of passive trading is between two and three times as large as the effect of aggressive trading. The second model (based on order imbalances) also shows that both types of trading improve efficiency. But again, passive trades improve efficiency more than aggressive trades, although this difference is twice as large for sells. The key result is that institutional trading improves efficiency  \n\nregardless of the (inferred) trading strategy. Moreover, the daily evidence is consistent with the behavior of informed traders in Bloomfield, O'Hara, and Saar (2005) in that a prominent portion of the effect of trading on efficiency can be attributed to passively trading institutions.  \n\nA sizeable literature presents evidence that institutions are positive-feedback traders in that they purchase securities that have recently performed well and sell securities that have performed poorly.22 Grossman and Stiglitz (1976) and Hellwig (1980) note that such trading practices could be based on rational learning through prices, but others argue that this activity could destabilize prices (Banerjee, 1992; Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, and Welch, 1992; Welch, 1992). Using a modified version of our quarterly proxies for institutional trading, we can shed some light on this debate. For each stock quarter, we define changes in individual institutional holdings that are in the same direction as returns over the previous quarter as momentum changes, and changes that go the opposite way as contrarian changes. We then sum the absolute value of holdings changes separately for momentum and contrarian changes to obtain proxies for institutional momentum and contrarian trading.  \n\nPanel B of Table 7 presents the relevant coefficients of the quarterly regression. The first model shows that both contrarian and momentum trading significantly improve efficiency. The effect is even slightly more pronounced for momentum than contrarian changes. In the second model, we further split holdings changes by the direction of change and their relationship to past returns to account for a potential buy-sell asymmetry. We find that changes always improve efficiency regardless of their classification, but the effect is stronger and significant only for increases in holdings. Again, momentum changes have a stronger effect on efficiency than do contrarian changes. These results suggest that feedback trading does not reduce the efficiency enhancing effect of institutional trading activity.  \n\nFinally, we construct a test to examine more directly the effect of institution-specific private information on the effect that trading has on efficiency. For the quarterly sample, we can observe the identity of individual institutions and contrast the activities of more informed to less informed institutions.  \n\nTo classify institutions as informed or uninformed, we use the characteristic selectivity $(C S)$ measure developed in Daniel et al. (1997). We compute $C S$ based on the approach in Daniel et al. (1997) and Wermers (2004) for each institution-quarter. CS is based on excess returns at the portfolio level as reported in the 13-f data and measures an institution's ability to select stocks that earn excess returns.?? In each quarter, we sort all institutions in the 13-f data on $C S$ averaged over the prior four quarters and classify the top-performing decile as Topl0CS institutions. Then we separately compute our trading proxy, the sum of absolute changes in holdings standardized by shares outstanding, for Top10CS institutions and the rest. If the ability to generate investing alpha is correlated with the ability to take advantage of short-run mispricing, we expect that trading by Topl0CS institutions has a greater effect on efficiency than trading by others. The third model in Panel B lends some support to this hypothesis. While trading by both types of institutions improves efficiency, the effect is $60\\%$ stronger for trading by Top10CS institutions.  \n\nOur decompositions of institutional trading activity allow several observations about the effect of institutional trading on price efficiency. First, institutional trading improves efficiency regardless of whether trading strategies are active, passive, momentum, or contrarian. Second, passive trading that provides liquidity and thereby alleviates the effects of temporary buying or selling pressure improves efficiency more than aggressive trading. Third, stock-picking ability appears to facilitate informed shortterm trading, because trading by the best stock pickers has a stronger effect on efficiency than trading by other institutions. Fourth, our evidence mitigates concerns that positive-feedback trading destabilizes prices, because we find that quarterly momentum trading improves efficiency. Taken together, these results suggest that institutional trading is an important mechanism that links institutions and the relative efficiency of prices. The efficiency-enhancing effect of trading does not appear to be limited to a narrow set of trading strategies or specific types of private information. Finally, we note that none of the tradingrelated variables in Table 7 drives out the effect of institutional holdings on efficiency.  \n\n### IV.3  Does variation in liquidity explain the trading effect?  \n\nWe argue that institutional trading drives efficiency improvements, but it is possible that this relation arises because of a liquidity effect. As we show in Table 2 and 3, liquidity is positively related to both institutional holdings and efficiency. It is conceivable that institutions concentrate their trading in stocks they expect to be liquid in the future to reduce their expected trading costs. Similar to the discussion in Section IH1.3.1, this implies that the positive relationship between institutional trading and efficiency could be driven by persistence in liquidity.  \n\nTo address this concern, we employ a two-stage procedure. First, we decompose cross-sectional variation in institutional trading into liquidity-related and liquidity-unrelated portions by regressing trading on one of five different liquidity proxies. Second, we repeat the regressions in Panels A and C of Table 6, except that we split the trading variable into the predicted (suffix $P$ ) and residual (suffix $R$ components from the first step. In these models, the coefficient on the predicted component measures how efficiency depends on liquidity-related variation in institutional trading, while the coefficient on the residual component reflects how it depends on liquidity-unrelated variation in trading. If institutional trading is only related to efficiency because of its relation to liquidity, we expect significantly negative coefficients on the predicted component and no explanatory power for the residual component. In contrast, if trading has an effect on efficiency beyond what is attributable to variation in liquidity, we expect a significantly negative coefficient on the residual component of institutional trading.  \n\nIn Table 8 we present the coefficients of interest for each of the five liquidity proxies. The results for the daily (Panel A) and quarterly (Panel B) samples are inconsistent with the argument that liquidity is responsible for the effect trading has on efficiency. Specifically, regardless of the sample and liquidity measure, we find that only the residual (liquidity-unrelated) component of institutional trading improves efficiency significantly. The liquidity-related component is insignificant except when liquidity is measured as the ratio of quoted spreads and depth. This result is robust across alternative specifications of the first-stage regression. For example, including multiple dimensions of liquidity (effective spread, quoted spread, depth, and price) in the first stage leaves our inferences unchanged for both samples.  \n\nInferences from Panel B remain also unchanged for the other trading proxies and efficiency variables. In sum, institutional trading has effects on efficiency beyond those atributable to variation in liquidity.24  \n\n### IV.4 Other mechanisms  \n\nA striking feature of our analysis is the consistency with which institutional holdings have a significant incremental effect on efficiency even after controlling for institutional trading. Thus, there appears to be some mechanism beyond trading by which institutional investors affect the efficiency of prices. In this section, we explore when trading can play this role and when it cannot, and then explore potential reasons for the incremental effect of institutional holdings.  \n\n#### IV.4.1  Trading vs. holding  \n\nBloomfield, O'Hara, and Saar (2005) provide experimental evidence that informed traders exploit and eliminate mispricing more aggressively when their private information is more valuable. All else equal, these traders′ profit opportunities will be more rewarding when prices deviate the most from fundamental values. This suggests that trading in a way that makes prices more efficient is more profitable the greater the degree of mispricing.  \n\nTo provide evidence related to this issue, we form quintiles based on previous-quarter efficiency, measured as $V(s)/V(p)$ , which serves as a proxy for the degree of mispricing. We then estimate model (2) separately within each quintile. Panel A in Table 9 reports coefficients on $I O$ and institutional trading for the daily sample, and Panel B reports coefficients on $I O$ and a trading proxy for the quarterly sample. We only report results for institutional trading standardized by shares outstanding, but using the other trading measures does not alter the conclusions. Again, the controls in (2) are included but not reported in the table.  \n\nWithin each efficiency quintile, both holdings and trading are positively related to efficiency and their coefficients are significant. The effect of trading becomes stronger, and the effect of holdings  \n\nbecomes weaker, as lagged efficiency deteriorates. While this relationship is not strictly monotonic, the effect of trading tends to be more than twice as large in the least efficient stocks than in the most efficient ones. This difference is statistically significant at the $5\\%$ level or better in both samples. The difference in IO coefficients between the least and the most efficient quintile is only significant for the daily sample. Taken together, these results suggest that institutions improve the efficiency of prices, but the mechanism that impounds their knowledge into prices differs across stocks. For less efficiently priced stocks, institutional trading is most important because the rewards to eliminating mispricing are presumably the largest. In contrast, the effect of holdings on efficiency is stronger for stocks whose prices are already close to a random walk.  \n\n#### IV.4.2 Explaining the effect of institutional holdings on efficiency  \n\nA surprising finding that we have not yet explored further is that institutional holdings per se are associated with greater efficiency. A possible reason is that the magnitude of holdings is linked to information production. We empirically examine two specific explanations for this link, competition among informed traders and variation in analyst coverage. On one hand, institutions may step up research efforts regarding a particular stock as their holdings increase because they stand to gain more from the acquisition of new information. This suggests that large ownership stakes by individual institutions drive the relation between holdings and efficiency. On the other hand, Holden and Subrahmanyam (1992) show that as the number of informed parties increases, greater competition between them leads to faster price adjustment towards full information values. Thus, to the extent that institutions are informed traders, we expect widely dispersed institutional ownership to be most beneficial to efficiency. To test these alternatives, we use the holdings of individual institutions to construct a Herfindahl index (Herf) for institutional ownership and then add this variable to our cross-sectional regressions. The size-based argument suggests greater efficiency when the concentration of ownership is high, and the competition argument predicts the opposite.  \n\nWe report estimates from daily regressions using two different measures of institutional trading in Panel A of Table 10 and estimates from quarterly regressions in Panel B. For both models, the coefficient on Herf is significantly positive, indicating that greater concentration of institutional holdings is related to less efficient prices. As a second test, we split quarterly $I O$ into the largest five holdings and holdings by all other institutions (third and fourth model in Panel A, second model in Panel B). We find that the relation between holdings and efficiency is driven by the holdings of institutions outside of the Top 5 - indeed, holdings by the Top 5 have no effect on efficiency. Finally, we note that the models in Panel A control for institutional trading, so these results imply that lower concentration accelerates information revelation beyond what traders can infer from order flow. These results are consistent with Holden and Subrahmanyam’s (1992) prediction that greater competition among informed traders results in faster incorporation of private information.  \n\nInstitutional holdings could also be related to information production via the role of analysts. Brennan and Subrahmanyam (1995) show that the number of sell-side analysts following a stock is positively related to the number of institutions owning shares. They further show that the number of analysts is inversely related to the price impact of trades, a proxy for the information content of order flow. This suggests that analysts affect the intra-day information environment of a firm. To address their potential effect on efficiency, we add the log of the number of analysts covering a stock (from IBES) to our quarterly regression model. The third model in Panel B shows that controlling for analyst coverage has little effect on the relationship between informational efficiency and institutional holdings. Moreover, analyst coverage itself does not impact efficiency. Additionally controlling for institutional trading, even separately for that by the most successful institutions (Topl0CS) as in the fourth model in Panel B, does not alter this result. Therefore, we cannot attribute the holdings effect to increased analyst coverage.  \n\nFinally, a further channel through which institutional holdings could influence efficiency is short selling. Institutionally owned shares are often available for borrowing by short sellers (see Nagel 2005). Because short sellers are highly informed traders (Boehmer, Jones, and Zhang 2007), their trades can make prices more efficient $(\\mathrm{Wu}2007\\$ . We obtain the actual aggregate amount of short selling for each stock-day in our daily sample. The shorting data are based on proprietary NYSE audit-trail data and are discussed in detail in Boehmer, Jones, and Zhang (2007).  \n\nThe last two models in Panel A show daily regressions as in Table 6, but with an additional variable representing total shorting flow in each stock. One of the models standardizes shorting and institutional trading by total volume, the other one by shares outstanding. Short selling significantly increases efficiency, consistent with Wu (2007). But shorting does not drive out institutional holdings or trading, which remain significant in both models. In fact, institutional trading has about the same effect on efficiency as shorting does: a one-standard deviation increase in IVol/Totvol or Ivol/Shrout decreases the pricing error by about the same magnitude as a one-standard deviation increase in shorting.  \n\nTaken together, two of the three mechanisms that we expect to be related to the effect that institutional holdings have on efficiency are relevant. A larger number of institutions in a stock promotes competition and thereby appears to improve efficiency. More short selling also makes prices more efficient, and institutional holdings increase the number of lendable shares. But neither of these explanations drives out institutional holdings - stocks with larger holdings are priced more efficiently, even controlling for competition among informed traders and the amount of short selling.  \n\n# Conclusions  \n\nInstitutional shareholdings and trading volume have increased substantially in the past two decades. Yet, we have little evidence on how institutional presence affects the informational efficiency of prices, one important dimension of market quality. Our examination of this issue uses a broad sample of NYSE stocks between 1983 and 2004. We compute different measures of the relative informational efficiency of transaction prices from intra-day transactions during this period and relate these measures to institutional holdings and trading in the cross-section of stocks.  \n\nWe find that greater institutional holdings are associated with improved informational efficiency of prices, and this result is robust across different measures of efficiency, different econometric specifications, and a variety of controls. We provide evidence that this result cannot be attributed to reverse causality or to the interaction that market liquidity has with both holdings and efficiency.  \n\nMoreover, our tests suggest a causal link between institutions and efficiency. Overall, this implies that the presence of institutional investors improves the information environment of a firm.  \n\nWe examine several economic mechanisms that could explain this result. First, using proprietary audit trail data, we find that institutional trading activity makes prices more efficient. We also use these proprietary data to create quarterly proxies for institutional trading from public 13-f data, and employ these proxies to corroborate our result in a longer panel. Moreover, we show that the underlying trading strategy has little effect on the efficiency-enhancing effect of institutional trading. We obtain three interesting results in this context: (1) trading by institutions that are successful stock pickers improves efficiency more than trading by other institutions, indicating that their trading reveals private information; (2) institutional trading improves efficiency even when it is based on positive-feedback strategies, inconsistent with the view that positive-feedback trading makes prices noisier; and (3) even passive trading that is not necesarily based on private information about fundamentals can improve efficiency.  \n\nIn addition to institutional trading, the level of institutional holdings has a strong effect on efficiency, even when controlling for institutional trading, liquidity, and firm characteristics. This is a somewhat puzzling result and we provide an exploratory analysis of its causes. First, we show that more institutional holdings improve efficiency more when holdings are more dispersed. This is consistent with arguments that atribute faster price adjustment to fundamental values to greater competition among informed traders. Second, it is well known that greater institutional holdings increase the activities of two types of market participants who are presumed to be more informed than others: analysts and short sellers. We find no evidence that analysts have an effect on efficiency but document that short selling makes prices more efficient. But neither analyst coverage nor short selling drives out the explanatory power of institutional holdings (or that of institutional trading). Thus, further research is necessary to explain why institutional holdings per se affect efficiency. Perhaps this relationship arises because other market participants focus more on stocks with greater institutional holdings. For example, conversations with NYSE members indicate that specialists often pay additional attention to stocks with high institutional ownership. During our sample period, each NYSE specialist makes a market in about twelve different securities, but their trading screens cannot present equal detail on each of those stocks. Therefore, they must focus their attention on a smaller subset, for which they might follow trading activity more closely (irrespective of who is trading). Such activity serves as another viable channel through which stocks with high institutional ownership become more efficiently priced.  \n\nWhile our measures of the relative efficiency of prices concentrate on the short run, we believe that the effects we document are distinct from the dimensions of market quality typically assessed in studies of market microstructure. In particular, we use a range of liquidity measures to control for execution costs throughout the analysis, so the effect we ascribe to institutional investors goes beyond simple reductions in trading costs. Moreover, we show that longer-term measures based on variance ratios up to a one-month horizon yield very similar conclusions.  \n\nIn a broader sense, the informational efficiency of prices is a valuable public good—all market participants benefit from more efficient prices. Our finding that institutions improve efficiency contributes to the debate on how their increasing presence in securities markets affects market quality. We document that one channel through which institutions influence efficiency is through their trading, but our results also indicate that other channels exist that link institutions’ activities to security prices. It seems important for future research efforts to identify these additional channels through which these efficiency improvements materialize, because the precise nature and the scope of the process is likely to have important implications for the optimal design of markets, trading protocols, and regulatory policy.  \n\nReferences   \nBadrinath, S., J.

The daily sample is based on NYSE-listed common stocks between Jan 1, 2000 and April 30, 2004 and includes allstock-days with at least 100 trades. We compute cross-sectional means and standard deviations for every period and report statistics on the time series of these estimates. V(s) is the pricing error based on Hasbrouck (1993). V(p) is the standard deviation C intraday (log) transaction prices. AR30 is the 30-minute quote midpoint return autocorrelation. $\\operatorname{VR}({\\mathfrak{n}},{\\mathfrak{m}})$ represent variance ratios of the m-day return variance per unit time divided by the n-day return variance per unit time. IO is the fraction of shares outstanding held by institutions that file quarterly 13F reports. ES is the trade weighted dollar effective spread, QS is the time-weighted quoted spread, and Dollar Depth is a time-weighted average of the total dollar amount of depth offered at the bid and offer prices. Relative effective spreads (RES) and relative quoted spreads (RQS) are standardized by the quote midpoint. MV is end-of-quarter market value of equity, Price is end of quarter share price, Quarterly volume is shares traded over the quarter, and Quarterly turnover is quarterly volume scaled by shares outstanding. In the daily sample based on the NSYE audit trail information, Ivol/shrout (Ivol/TotVol) is the sum of institutional buys and sells divided by shares outstanding (all buys and sells).  \n\nMean Std 1983-  Mean Std 1994-  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Mean</td><td>Median</td><td>Mean Std</td><td>Mean1983-1993</td><td>Mean 1994-2004</td><td>1993</td><td>2004</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nPanel A: Quarterly sample   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Number of securities</td><td>1,138</td><td>1,101</td><td></td><td>879</td><td>1,396</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"8\">Measures of market efficiency</td></tr><tr><td>ln[V(s)]</td><td>2.537</td><td>2.780</td><td>0.831</td><td>2.993</td><td>2.081</td><td>0.760</td><td>0.901</td></tr><tr><td>V(s)/V(p)</td><td>0.067</td><td>0.077</td><td>0.060</td><td>0.090</td><td>0.044</td><td>0.077</td><td>0.044</td></tr><tr><td>[AR30]</td><td>0.070</td><td>0.068</td><td>0.056</td><td>0.074</td><td>0.065</td><td>0.060</td><td>0.051</td></tr><tr><td>[1-VR(1, 10)]</td><td>0.373</td><td>0.363</td><td>0.248</td><td>0.379</td><td>0.366</td><td>0.244</td><td>0.252</td></tr><tr><td>[1-VR(1, 20)</td><td>0.530</td><td>0.526</td><td>0.276</td><td>0.536</td><td>0.525</td><td>0.269</td><td>0.283</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>51%</td><td>51%</td><td>20%</td><td>44%</td><td>57%</td><td>18%</td><td>21%</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"8\">Control variables</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.63%</td><td>0.66%</td><td>0.78%</td><td>0.79%</td><td>0.47%</td><td>0.96%</td><td>0.59%</td></tr><tr><td>RES</td><td>0.92%</td><td>0.98%</td><td>0.95%</td><td>1.16%</td><td>0.68%</td><td>1.15%</td><td>0.76%</td></tr><tr><td>RQS ES ($)</td><td>0.12</td><td>0.13</td><td>0.05</td><td>0.15</td><td>0.09</td><td>0.04</td><td>0.05</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.18</td><td>0.21</td><td>0.08</td><td>0.24</td><td>0.13</td><td>0.07</td><td>0.08</td></tr><tr><td>QS ($) Dollar Depth</td><td>133,489</td><td>133,694</td><td>152,299</td><td>148,042</td><td>120,261</td><td>154,090</td><td>150,670</td></tr><tr><td>MV ($1,000)</td><td>3,959,081</td><td>3,234,176</td><td>11,071,131</td><td>2,409,964</td><td>5,508,199</td><td>5,239,678</td><td>16,902,583</td></tr><tr><td>Price ($)</td><td>31.36</td><td>31.55</td><td>24.98</td><td>31.89</td><td>30.84</td><td>23.11</td><td>26.85</td></tr><tr><td>Quarterly volume (round lots)</td><td>247,918</td><td>150,202</td><td>494,852</td><td>110,503</td><td>385,333</td><td>144,797</td><td>844,906</td></tr><tr><td>Quarterly turnover</td><td>25%</td><td>23%</td><td>21%</td><td>21%</td><td>29%</td><td>16%</td><td>25%</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nPanel B: Daily sample   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Number ofsecurities</td><td>957</td><td>978</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Measures of institutional trading</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Ivol/Shrout</td><td>0.006</td><td>0.006</td><td>0.013</td></tr><tr><td>Ivol/TotVol</td><td>0.567</td><td>0.558</td><td>0.112</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n# Table 2: Summary statistics by market value and institutional ownership  \n\nThe sample is based on NYSE-listed common stocks between 1983 and 2004.

We conduct paired t-tests on the time series means of the high and low IO group within each liquidity quintile and report significance. In Panel C, we sort the sample into stocks experiencing increases and decreases in liquidity from quarter t-1 to t. Then we split both groups at their respective median into large and small changes. Next, we sort each of the four groups into increases and decreases in IO over the same period. We retain only the four groups corresponding to large changes in each variable.

V(s) is the pricing error based on Hasbrouck (1993). IO is the fraction of shares outstanding held by institutions that file quarterly 13F reports. Shrout is the number of shares outstanding. All daily (quarterly) independent variables are lagged by one day (quarter). Ln is the natural logarithm. In Panel A, we conduct daily cross-sectional regressions and report the mean coefficients over 1086 days in the sample. IBuy (ISell) refers to all daily institutional purchases (sales), Down/Up refers to the sign of the daily return, and With/Against refers to the direction of institutional trading relative to that stock-day's trade imbalance. Trade imbalance is measure as buyer-initiated shares traded less seller-initiated shares traded. For example, IBuyWith is the share volume of institutional buys on days when trade imbalance is positive. In Panel B, we conduct quarterly cross-sectional regressions and report the mean coefficients over 87 quarters in the sample. DShares refers to changes in the holdings of individual institutions that we aggregate in specific ways. Mom (Cont) measures all increases (decreases) that follow a rising market in the previous quarter and decreases (increases) that follow a declining market in the previous quarter, and is zero otherwise. Buy (Sell) unconditionally measures all increases (decreases) and is zero otherwise; the interaction is constructed accordingly. After classifying changes in institutional holdings in this way, we aggregate each of these variables across all institutions for this particular stock-quarter. Top10CS (Bottom90) refers to institutions that are (not) in the top performance decile among all institutions over the past year, where performance is based on the CS measure developed in DGTW (1997).

In the 1980s, institutional investors held approximately 20%-30% of the average frm (with individual investors making up the rest). By the 2010s, over 65% of the average frm is owned by institutional investors.1 This increase in institutional holdings coincides with the growing sophistication of markets and growing importance of corporate governance. Indeed, much of the literature focuses on the informed \"smart money” of the institutional investor in contrast to the less sophisticated individual “retail\" investor. Barber and Odean (2008) confirm that, unlike institutions, individual investors are net buyers of attention-grabbing stocks due to limited search resources. This ability of institutional investors to gather information and impose market discipline on management should translate into improvements in market efficiency and asset valuation. For example, Sias and Starks (1997) find that institutional trading increases the speed of adjustment of information into prices and Nagel (2005) finds that short sale constraints bind for stocks with low institutional ownership, resulting in underperformance.  \n\nYet, as suggested in a speech by Commissioner Luis Aguilar of the SEC,2 not all institutional owners are alike nor do they have similar effects on firms. While many characteristics differentiate institutional investors from one another, portfolio turnover and holdings concentration are the most fundamental. For example, Bushee (1998, 2001) finds that short-term, low concentration (\"transient\") investors lead to myopic investment decision-making by managers and over-weighting of near-term expected earnings to the detriment of long-term earnings. As such, myopic investment behavior leads to myopic corporate decision-making, potentially destroying long-run value for the frm. In addition, Yan and Zhang (2009) show that the pricing impact of large institutional investors is largely driven by short-term investors reacting and trading on new information. These findings suggest that, subsets of institutional investors with different holdings horizons and portfolio concentrations may have differential impact on corporate decisions and firm valuation.  \n\nIn this paper, we study the impact of different institutional investor types on the valuation, corporate governance, and future performance of firms. Specifically, we focus on two fundamental investor characteristics, portfolio turnover and holdings concentration. We begin by using the Bushee (1998, 2001) classification of institutions into “transient” and “dedicated\" investor types. Institutional investors are “transient” if they take small positions in the frms they hold and have high portfolio turnover. Due to a short investment horizon and lack of focus on particular frms, these investors are likely to be myopic traders looking for short-term gains. On the other hand, \"dedicated\" investors take highly concentrated positions in the firms they hold and have low portfolio turnover. Both of these portfolio characteristics suggest dedicated investors are more likely to invest for the long run, gathering costly firm-specific information and trading on growth potential of a firm. Bushee (1998) finds evidence consistent with this interpretation as firms with predominantly dedicated (transient) institutional owners invest more (less) in R&D. Figure 1 shows that transient institutional investors comprise an increasingly large portion of the total institutional investor pool over time, making an investigation into the effects of different institutional investor types particularly relevant.  \n\nWe find that frms with higher percentages of transient (dedicated) institutional investors experience more (less) subsequent overvaluation and misvaluation. Specifically, using the RhodesKropf, Robinson, and Viswanathan (2005) book-to-market decomposition, frms with more transient (dedicated) institutional investors experience more (less) positive firm-specific deviation from fundamental values in the following quarter, consistent with overvaluation. They also experience more (less) of an absolute deviation from fundamental value in the next quarter, consistent with misvaluation. Furthermore, firms that experience an increase in their percentage of transient (dedicated) institutional investors experience more (less) overvaluation and misvaluation in the next quarter.  These effects persist after controlling for common firm characteristics that may impact firm valuation and after considering alternative explanations such as perceived growth opportunities. In the appendix, we obtain similar results using alternative definitions of overvaluation and misvaluation based on the Hirshleifer and Jiang (2010) undervalued minus  \n\novervalued factor.3  \n\nWe posit that the differential impact of transient versus dedicated institutional investors on subsequent firm overvaluation and misvaluation is driven by differences in information gathering. To examine the information channel, we explore the relationship between institutional investor types and firm valuation around the enactment of SEC Regulation FD. Regulation FD, enacted in 20o0 by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, mandates that when an issuer discloses material non-public information to specific outsiders (e.g., analysts or institutional investors), this disclosure must be made public, thereby eliminating the informational advantage previously enjoyed by blockholders (Francis, Nanda, and Wang, 2006; Anderson, Reeb, Zhang, and Zhao, 2013). As such, this regulation addresses the problem of selective disclosure of material information and provides a natural experiment in which to test the information channel.  \n\nUsing a difference-in-difference framework we find that, as expected, Regulation FD has no significant impact on the relationship between dedicated investor ownership and subsequent overvaluation and misvaluation.  That is, dedicated institutional investor ownership reduces overvaluation and misvaluation to a similar degree before and after the regulation, consistent with their having access to information both prior to and after Regulation FD. On the other hand, the regulation significantly reduced the subsequent overvaluation and misvaluation for firms with above-median levels of transient investors relative to the preceding time period, consistent with transient investors having lower barriers to access of information previously only enjoyed by dedicated investors. These results do not exist using a placebo event year of 1995.  \n\nAlthough we use a model with lagged changes in institutional ownership type on overvaluation and misvaluation, the observed results may be due to self-selection by investors into certain types of firms rather than a causal effect of ownership type on firm valuation. We create samples matched exante on misvaluation in a difference-in-difference-in-difference framework to control for self-selection issues in the appendix. We obtain similar results.  \n\nHaving established that transient and dedicated institutional investors have differential impact on subsequent firm overvaluation and misvaluation, we next explore which of the associated portfolio characteristics - portfolio turnover or holdings concentration - is responsible for these findings to shed further light on the causes of differences between the two previously defined institutional types. We find that ownership by institutions in the lowest portfolio turnover tercile (i.e., long horizon investors) results in less firm-specific overvaluation as well as lower misvaluation relative to fundamentals in the subsequent quarter. Institutional ownership by investors in the highest portfolio turnover tercile also results in less overvaluation, but statistically insignificant misvaluation. Importantly, frms held by institutions that have diversified portfolios and either high or low portfolio turnover experience more future overvaluation.  \n\nFinally, we explore whether institutional ownership types also have differential effects on measures of risk, corporate governance, and future frm performance. We document that firms held by transient institutional investors have more expected tail risk, higher realized returns volatility, higher average and median executive compensation, worse accruals quality, lower payout ratios, and lower leverage increases relative to those held by dedicated institutional investors. Firms held by transient investors experience positive abnormal returns relative to the 5-factor model in the subsequent quarter, whereas those held by dedicated investors experience positive abnormal performance later in the year consistent with longer investment horizons. Firms held by dedicated investors experience positive raw returns over the subsequent four quarters, whereas those held by transient investors experience negative or insignificant raw returns over the same period.  \n\nThese findings enable us to contribute to the ongoing debate within extant literature over whether institutional investors benefit the markets, either through improvements in market efficiency or by providing corporate governance, or whether they harm them through opportunism and pressure exerted on managers to achieve short-term results at the expense of long-term performance. While the literature generally accepts that institutional investors are more informed and allow markets to be more effcient (Sias and Starks, 1997; Nagel, 2005; Barber and Odean, 2008), there are contradicting results and arguments among both academics and practitioners over the institutional benefits to governance and costs of induced myopia. For example, Gillian (1995), Karpoff, Malatesta, and Walkling (1996), Smith (1996), and Wahal (1996) find no long-term effects from shareholder activism while Nesbitt (1994) finds that firms targeted by CalPERS outperform in subsequent years. More recently, Brav, Jiang, Partnoy, and Thomas (2008) find a positive abnormal return for firms targeted by hedge fund activism and Boone and White (2015) find that higher institutional ownership is associated with greater management disclosure and lower information asymmetry. Conversely, a survey of over 1,0oo board members and executives around the world conducted by the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board and McKinsey and Company (Barton and Wiseman, 2014) draws attention to the effects of short-term investor pressure on corporate decision-making and its negative effects on value maximization. In this report, 79% of respondents felt pressured to demonstrate performance over a horizon of two years or less, and 44% used a horizon of three or less years to set corporate strategy while 86% stated that a longer horizon would have improved financial performance.  \n\nThese seemingly dissonant effects of institutional ownership on firm performance can be explained by the diferential effects we find for institutional ownership types. The conficting findings in the growing literature above suggest that combining all institutions into one category yields different, and likely mistaken, results than those that would be obtained by more refined categorizations. Indeed, among the papers that find benefits to corporate governance, most focus on a specific type of institutional investor (e.g., CalPERS or hedge funds) rather than institutional investors as a single group.  \n\nThe main contribution of our paper lies in identifying the distinct effects of institutional investor types and investment styles on subsequent firm overvaluation, misvaluation, governance measures, and realized future performance. Bushee (1998, 2001) groups institutional investors based on their portfolio turnover and holdings concentration and finds that “transient\" institutional investors are related to myopic corporate decision-making while “dedicated\" institutional investors are not. Gompers and Metrick (2001) find that large institutional investors invest in large companies, thereby increasing the prices of large stocks. Yan and Zhang (2009) show that these trends in large institutional investors is largely driven by short-term investors reacting and trading on new information. On the other hand, Gasper, Massa, and Matos (2005) show that acquisition targets held by short-term investors experience a lower premium and Chen, Harford, and Li (2007) find that only long-term investors are related to positive post-merger performance rather than focusing on short-term gains.  \n\nWe add to this growing literature by identifying how institutional investor types and their underlying portfolio turnover and holdings concentration affect the valuation, governance characteristics, and future performance of firms in which these institutions invest.  We find that dedicated institutional investor ownership results in more accurate future firm valuation, superior characteristics related to corporate governance, and superior long-term performance of the frm. The valuation effects are primarily improved by institutional investors with higher portfolio concentration and the governance and long-term performance effects by institutions with lower portfolio turnover. Specifically, we find that long-term institutions are able to achieve long-term performance: firms with more long-term institutional investors outperform firms with fewer of them by 2.8% on a risk-adjusted basis over the subsequent year.  \n\n## 2 Data  \n\n### 2.1 Institutional Ownership and Investor Types  \n\nWe start with data on institutional investor ownership obtained from the Thomson Reuters Institutional Holdings database.  The Thomson Reuters holdings database covers investment companies and their security holdings as reported on their 13F forms filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) every quarter.4  \n\nWe first classify institutional investor types based on the combination of portfolio turnover and holdings concentration from Bushee (1998, 2001) and Bushee and Noe (2000). Bushee (1998, 2001) categorizes institutional investors as “transient\", “\"quasi-indexer\", or “dedicated\" based on their investment horizons and portfolio concentration.5 Investors are classified as “transient” if they have short investment horizons refected by high portfolio turnover and highly diversified portfolio holdings.6 Analogously, “dedicated\" investors have long investment horizons refected by low portfolio turnover and focused portfolio holdings. The third class of investors, “quasiindexers\", are long-horizon, low turnover investors that are highly diversified. We focus our analysis on dedicated (DED) and transient (TRA) institutional investors as they both have an active choice in their investment strategy: dedicated investors do not trade frequently, but hold specifically selected frms (and are therefore different from the passive indexers), while transient investors trade frequently. We exclude the quasi-indexer institutional ownership type as the passive ownership strategy does not imply any asset selection in either the time horizon or portfolio choice dimensions.  \n\nTable I presents the top ten dedicated and transient institutional investors in our sample in decreasing order based on average portfolio size. As expected, the dedicated list of investors is comprised of investment management and insurance companies, which may be expected to hold stocks for long periods of time and some of which, like Berkshire Hathaway, are famous for it. On the other hand, many of the investment management frms on the transient list of investors are affliated with investment banks such as UBS, Morgan Stanley, and Oppenheimer.  \n\nTo further motivate the distinctions between the two types of institutional investors, we consider empirical differences in their portfolio characteristics. Table II demonstrates that dedicated and transient institutions have different investment styles, as reflected in their significantly different portfolio characteristics. Dedicated institutional investors have average portfolio sizes almost four times larger than transient investors, though they hold fewer stocks on average. Additionally, dedicated investors hold a larger percentage of each firm on average, and at the median, than transients do. They also have a significantly higher variation in these holdings, consistent with the large positions of dedicated blockholders.7 Notably, dedicated investors hold firms with smaller average and median market capitalizations that are almost half the size of those held by transients, with a correspondingly lower variability in owned-firm capitalizations. This is consistent with dedicated investors possessing an information advantage, as smaller and younger frms are more opaque and difficult to analyze (Hadlock and Pierce, 2010; Karpoff, Lee, Masulis, 2013). As expected, dedicated investors are also more focused, holding frms from fewer unique SIC3 industries and have a much higher Hirshleifer-Herfindahl concentration in portfolio weights than do transient investors. Reassuringly, consistent with the Bushee (1998, 2001) definition, dedicated investors do indeed have more concentrated positions in firms relative to total shares outstanding and have lower portfolio turnover than transients. All institutional investor characteristics between dedicated and transient institutional investors are significantly different at the 1% level.  \n\n### 2.2 Misvaluation  \n\nOur main measure of misvaluation is the Rhodes-Kropf, Robinson, and Viswanathan (2005), hereafter RKRV, decomposition which splits the logarithm of the market-to-book ratio into three components: firm-specific error, time-series sector error, and long-run market value to book value. The RKRV decomposition is provided in equation (3) of their paper and reproduced below:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{m_{i,t}-b_{i,t}=\\underbrace{m_{i,t}-v(\\theta_{i,t};a_{j,t})}_{f i r m}+\\underbrace{v(\\theta_{i,t};a_{j,t})-v(\\theta_{i,t};a_{j})}_{s e c t o r}+\\underbrace{v(\\theta_{i,t};a_{j})-b_{i,t}}_{l o n g-r u n}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThis decomposition relies on a firm having a long-run, target, market-to-book ratio that equals that of its industry. This ratio is determined by a parsimonious set of valuation multiples: book value, leverage, and net income.8 The firm's market-to-book ratio is comprised of a long-run market-to-book value determined from long-run multiples of the three variables used, with a time-varying sector-wide multiple representing sector-wide deviations and a frm-specific multiple accounting for any additional firm-specific deviations. Following Rhodes-Kropf, Robinson, and Viswanathan (2005), these firm-specific deviations capture the degree of overvaluation and misvaluation. We explore the impact of the different types of institutional investor on the firmspecific error component. Positive firm-specific error is our proxy for overvaluation, and the absolute value of the firm-specific error proxies for misvaluation.9  \n\n### 2.3Financial Statement Data  \n\nnegative book asset value, market equity, book equity, capital stock, sales, dividends, debt, and inventory. Such firms have either unreliable Compustat data or are likely to be distressed or severely unprofitable. In addition, we delete observations in which book assets or sales growth over the quarter is greater than 1 or less than -1 and remove firms worth less than \\$5 million in 2000 dollars in book value or market value to remove observations that have abnormally large changes due to acquisitions or small asset bases. Next, we remove outliers defined as firm-quarter observations that are in the first and 99th percentile tails for all relevant variables used in our analysis. Following standard practice in the literature, we remove all firms in the financial and insurance, utilities, and public administration industries as they tend to be heavily regulated.  \n\nMerging institutional investor data to corporate financial data based on a frm's CUSIP and year-quarter gives us a sample of 236,025 firm-quarter observations spanning 11,116 frms. Appendix A details the construction of all variables. Table II provides the summary statistics for our main sample and Table IV presents the correlation matrix. The average (median) frm in our sample has 41.5% (38.4%) institutional ownership, with 4.6% (2.9%) of the frm owned by dedicated institutional investors and $27.3\\%$ (27.3%) owned by transient institutional investors. The correlation between dedicated and institutional ownership is -0.23.10 While there is a wide range of frm overvaluation, the average and median frm in our sample is overvalued (i.e., has positive firm-specific error) according to the RKRV measure.  \n\nIn Table V, we compare key characteristics of frms held by the two types of active institutional investors. We subset the data on the highest half of ownership by each investor type and find that the two active types hold firms with significantly different characteristics. This is consistent with the different investment styles and objectives evident in their different approaches to holding period and concentration. Notable differences in the firms each type chooses to hold signal potential notably different effects on firm valuation, operations, and performance. Specifically, we find that dedicated institutional investors hold larger firms than transient investors do, with average total asset values of \\$1,763.4 and \\$1,434.2 million respectively. Despite this, dedicated investors hold firms with lower market values than those held by transient investors, with average market values of \\$1,632.5 and \\$1,741.9 million respectively. These two observations taken together imply a value preference by dedicated investors relative to transient ones; indeed the log of long-run market-tobook ratio under the RKRV decomposition is significantly lower for firms held by dedicated (0.479) relative to transient institutional investors (0.578). Furthermore, frms held by dedicated investors experience almost no firm-specific overvaluation (0.004) under the RKRV measure whereas firms held by transient investors experience much more (0.140).  \n\nThe t-tests of means also suggest significant differences in information quality for firms held by the two types: dedicated investors prefer less popular firms with the average number of institutional investors in frms they hold at 66.9, relative to the 83.8 in firms held by transient investors. Dedicated investors also hold firms with lower analyst following, 3.3 to 4.9 respectively, as well as a higher principal component of several opacity measures,ll consistent with an informational advantage in selecting less-followed and more opaque firms. Firms held by dedicated investors are also less likely to have a credit rating, further consistent with a preference of dedicated investors in holding firms with less publicly available information.  \n\nDedicated investors also hold firms with significantly different operating characteristics than those held by transient investors: they have higher Z-scores, higher leverage, lower cash fow dispersion, lower realized volatility, lower tai or crash risk for firm cash flowsl risk, $_{12}$ lower average, maximum, and median executive pay, higher quality accruals, higher payout ratios, and higher net leverage changes.  \n\nOverall, these results are strongly indicative of differing investment preferences by the two institutional investor types, motivating our study of the effects of intuitional ownership type on future firm value. The overlap between firms owned by dedicated, transient, long/short horizon, and focused/diversified institutional investors is imperfect but consistent with expectations. Firms owned by an above-median number of dedicated investors also have more long-horizon institutional investors. Firms owned by an above-median number of transient investors also have more shorthorizon institutional investors. The differences observed in Table V also hold when we subsample frms based on the dollar amount held by each institutional ownership type (i.e., value-weighted), rather than by the number of each institutional investor type (i.e., equal-weighted).  \n\n## 3  Institutional Investor Type and Firm Value  \n\nIn this section, we examine the impact of different institutional investors types on overvaluation and misvaluation. We begin with classifying institutional investors as dedicated or transient, following Bushee (1998, 2001). Transient investors are more likely to enter and exit their positions quickly and aggressively, relying on publicly available information and strategies such as technical analysis to choose their investments (Bushee, 2001). In contrast, dedicated investors have more incentive to gather information and build relationships with their investments. Due to the information advantage that dedicated investors have relative to transient investors, we hypothesize that firms with more transient institutional investors will have more future overvaluation and misvaluation while firms with more dedicated institutional investors will have less. Furthermore, if dedicated investors possess an informational advantage an increase in dedicated institutional investors should lead to a decrease in overvaluation and misvaluation, with the opposite effect occurring for increases in transient institutional ownership.  \n\nHypothesis 1. Firms with a higher percentage of dedicated (transient) institutional investors ecperience less (more) overvaluation and misvaluation.  \n\nHypothesis 2. Firms that experience an increase in dedicated (transient) institutional investors experience less (more) overvaluation and misvaluation.  \n\n### 3.1 Baseline and Full Models  \n\nStarting with a baseline model, we estimate the effects of lagged levels of institutional ownership by investor type on overvaluation and misvaluation variables of interest, $Y_{i,t}$ , in the subsequent quarter. We consider two measures: 1) the RKRV firm-specific valuation error, which captures the direction of valuation error with positive error indicating overvaluation, and 2) the absolute value of the RKRV firm-specific error which captures the magnitude of misvaluation regardless of direction of deviation from fundamental value.  \n\n$$\nY_{i,t}=\\alpha+\\beta_{1}p D E D_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{2}p T R A_{i,t-1}+f e_{t}+f e_{j}+\\varepsilon_{i,t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $p D E D$ is the percentage of dedicated institutional owners relative to the total number of institutional owners, and $p T R A$ is the percentage of transient institutional owners relative to the total number of institutional owners. We control for macroeconomic effects with year fixed effects, for seasonality with quarter fixed effects, and for general changes in value with industry fixed effects. Standard errors are double-clustered by firm and year-quarter.  \n\nNext, we decompose the lagged level of ownership by type into the second lag of the level and the first lag of the change:  \n\n$$\nX_{i,t-1}\\equiv X_{i,t-2}+\\Delta X_{i,t-2,t-1}.\n$$  \n\nThis allows us to study the dynamics of the effect of ownership type on overvaluation and misvaluation by examining both changes in ownership as well as levels in ownership, giving us a second version of the baseline model:  \n\n$$\nY_{i,t}=\\alpha+\\beta_{1}p D E D_{i,t-2}+\\beta_{2}\\Delta p D E D_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{3}p T R A_{i,t-2}+\\beta_{4}\\Delta p T R A_{i,t-1}+f e_{t}+f e_{j}+f e_{t}+f e_{t}+f e_{t}+f e_{t}+f e_{t}+f e_{t}+f e_{t}+f e_{t}+f e_{t}+f e_{t}\n$$  \n\nThis decomposition of the lagged level of ownership into the second lag of the level and the first lag of the change has three main advantages. First, it allows us to study the impact of levels as well as changes of ownership type on firm value. Second, it controls for any persistence in institutional ownership through the second lag level, allowing the change in ownership to act as a shock. Third, although imperfect, it serves as a first attempt to address the potential selection bias issue in controlling for the relationship between firm valuation and pre-existing ownership types. We address the potential selection bias more rigorously in Section 4.1 and in the appendix.  \n\nWe further supplement our baseline model by including controls for common firm characteristics and factors relevant to firm value. This provides us with our full model:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{Y_{i,t}=\\alpha+\\beta_{1}p D E D_{i,t-2}+\\beta_{2}\\Delta p D E D_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{3}p T R A_{i,t-2}+\\beta_{4}\\Delta p T R A_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{5}l n T A_{i,t-1}}\\ &{\\mathrm{~~}+\\beta_{6}p I N S T_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{7}I N S T h h i_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{8}Z s c o r e i_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{9}L e v i_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{10}L T C R i_{i,t-1}}\\ &{\\mathrm{~}+\\beta_{11}C F d i s p_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{12}N u m E s t_{i,t-1}+f e_{t}+f e_{j}+\\varepsilon_{i,t},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $l n T A$ is log-transformed total assets of the firm to control for firm size, $p I N S T$ isthe percentage of institutional ownership by all types of institutional investors in the 13F database to control for overall institutional investment, INSThhi is the Herfindahl-Hirschman index of institutional ownership in the firm to control for concentration of institutional ownership, Zscore is the Altman (1968) Z-score measure to control for firm financial health, Lev is the ratio of long-term debt to total assets to control for capital structure, $L T C R$ is an indicator variable for whether the firm has a S&P long-term credit rating to control for financial constraints, CFdisp is the standard deviation of cash fows over the prior 20 quarters divided by the mean of cash fows over the prior 20 quarters to control for cash fow volatility, $^{13}$ and $N u m E s t$ is the number of analysts reporting EPS forecasts for the firm in a given quarter to control for market attention. All control variables are lagged one quarter. In addition, we include year and quarter fixed effects to control for the macroeconomic environment and seasonality, respectively, and SIC3 fixed effects to control for variation across industries. Standard errors are double-clustered by firm and year-quarter.  \n\nTable VI presents the results for the baseline and full models. Columns (1) and (2) report the results using the baseline model in equation (2). We see in Column (1) that frms with higher dedicated institutional ownership experience less overvaluation (-0.767) in the subsequent quarter, while those with higher transient ownership become more overvalued (0.388). That is, for a $100\\%$ increase in dedicated ownership, the logarithm of the firm's value relative to fundamentals drops by 0.767 and for a $100\\%$ increase in transient ownership, the log firm value relative to fundamentals increases by 0.388.14 Both effects are significant at the 1% level. Using the misvaluation measure, Column (2) finds that firms with more dedicated ownership are not significantly misvalued in the subsequent quarter, while those with more transient ownership face significantly higher subsequent misvaluation (0.073). In other words, for every $100\\%$ increase in transient ownership, the logarithm of misvaluation increases by 0.073 relative to firm fundamentals, which is significant at $1\\%$ .These results are consistent with Hypothesis 1, where frms with more dedicated (transient) institutional investors face lower (higher) subsequent overvaluation and misvaluation.  \n\nWhen we decompose lagged institutional ownership into second lagged levels and first lagged changes in equation (3), we see in Column (3) of Table VI that firms become less overvalued with both higher levels as well as larger increases in DED ownership whereas they become more 13We also consider the dispersion of earnings as wellas the dispersion o sales over th same time period, with no difference in the observed results. 14Recallthat Rhodes-Kropf, Robinson, and Viswanathan (2005） decompose the logarithm of the market-to-book ratio.  \n\novervalued with both higher levels and larger increases in TRA ownership, significant at the $1\\%$ level. In fact, overvaluation falls by 0.871 for a 100% increase in $p D E D_{i,t-2}$ , the level of dedicated institutional ownership, consistent with the decrease documented in column (1), and falls further by 0.516 for a $100\\%$ increase in $\\Delta p D E D_{i,t-1}$ , the change in dedicated ownership. Similarly, firm value relative to fundamentals rises by 0.453 for a $100\\%$ increase in $p T R A_{i,t-2}$ , the level of transient institutional ownership, consistent with the increase documented in column (1), and rises further by 0.410 for a $100\\%$ increase in $\\Delta p T R A_{i,t-1}$ , the change in transient ownership. All effects are significant at the 1% level. Column (4) presents the results for misvaluation, finding a weaker but also positive misvaluation effect on $p T R A_{i,t-2}$ , significant at the 10% level.  \n\nFinally, Columns (5) and (6) of Table VI present the results for the full model that includes controls in equation (4). These results confirm the prior findings on the distinct effects of dedicated and transient institutional ownership on both overvaluation and misvaluation in the presence of controls. Specifically, accounting for controls, a 100% increase in the level of dedicated ownership reduces overvaluation by 0.568, and a $100\\%$ increase in the change in dedicated ownership reduces overvaluation by 0.362, both significant at the $1\\%$ level. Similarly to previous findings, a $100\\%$ increase in the level of transient ownership increases overvaluation by 0.150, and a $100\\%$ increase in the change of transient ownership increases it by 0.285 in Column (5). Column (6) shows a significant positive effect on the magnitude of misvaluation for both levels and changes of transient institutional investors. This result is consistent with, and in fact, stronger than, that in column (4). A $100\\%$ increase in the level of transient ownership increases the magnitude of misvaluation by 0.135, and a $100\\%$ increase in the change of transient ownership increases it further by 0.096.  \n\nWe test the robustness of our findings by repeating the analysis in Table VI using an alternative measure of overvaluation and misvaluation based on Hirshleifer and Jiang (2010). Appendix B.1 details the methodology and results. The authors hypothesize that managers who have a private signal that their firm is overvalued (undervalued) will issue (repurchase) equity to take advantage of this inside information. They propose an undervalued-minus-overvalued (UMO) factor as a portfolio that takes long positions in equity repurchasers and shorts equity issuers and finds that this factor is able to identify overvalued and undervalued firms by its explanatory power for the frm's returns. We compute each frm's loading on the UMO factor as an alternative measure of overvaluation, and its absolute magnitude as an alternative measure of misvaluation. As this alternative measure is based on managerial behavior, the HJ measure is derived with respect to a completely distinct set of information than the RKRV measure, which is based on firm fundamental multiples. As such, we can expect the two to serve as robustness checks for one another. Our results for the two measures are mutually, and reassuringly, consistent.  \n\n### 3.2  Channels for Ownership Effects on Firm Value  \n\nHaving observed the differing effects that institutional investor types have on firm-specific overvaluation and misvaluation, we next seek to understand and test several explanations by which these differences may arise.  \n\n#### 3.2.1 Corporate Events  \n\nFirst, one potential reason for the observed differences is due to the occurrence of corporate events in which one type of institutional investor is involved in some capacity, resulting in both increased ownership by that investor type as well as increased (over) valuation. One such corporate event is merger and acquisition activity in which transient institutions may either engage in event-specific trading strategies or in advisory roles. To examine whether mergers and acquisitions drive the relationship between investor type and misvaluation, we obtain and include mergers and acquisition information from the Thomson Reuters SDC M&A database. We repeat our full model analysis in equation (4) using three alternative subsamples: 1) excluding firms that have participated in M&A (as either the acquirer or target) in the current quarter, 2) excluding frms that have participated in M&A in the quarter before, during, and after the current, and 3) excluding firms that have ever participated in M&A in its entire available history. In all cases, our results are highly similar to the main findings in Table VI, suggesting that investor involvement or infuence in M&A is not the main driver of investor type on misvaluation.  \n\nAnother such corporate event is equity offerings. It may be the case that transient investors, many of whom are large investment banks, may act in advisory roles, inflating both the valuation of the firm as well as transient ownership. To consider the effect of equity offerings, we obtain and include seasoned equity offering information from the Thomson Reuters SDC Global Issuances database. Similarly to the treatment of M&A, we consider three alternative subsamples: 1) excluding frms that have issued an equity offering in the current quarter, 2) excluding firms that have issued equity in the quarter before, during, and after the current, and 3) excluding firms that have ever participated in a seasoned equity offering in its entire available history. Again, in all cases, our results are highly similar to the main findings. Altogether, these results suggest that corporate events are not the main driver of the observed effect of institutional ownership type on firm value. These results are suppressed for brevity.  \n\n#### 3.2.2 Momentum  \n\nA second potential explanation for the observed differences between different institutional investor types could be that, given the high portfolio turnover and short investment horizon characteristics of transient investors, these investors may be momentum return chasers. A momentum trend could jointly cause an increase in both current transient ownership and future firm-specific RKRV overvaluation and misvaluation.15  We create a Momentum Returns measure calculated as the cumulative return over the prior 12 to seven months following Novy-Marx (2012) to control for this potential confounding effect.16 Novy-Marx (2012) shows that intermediate-term past returns serve better in predicting future returns than recent past performance. Using intermediate-term past returns has the additional advantage of basing momentum on a period prior to our lagged institutional investor level and change measures.  \n\nColumns (1) and (2) of Table VII include the Momentum Returns variable to control for momentum trends in firm value. The coefficients on both dedicated and transient institutional ownership types, their significances, and the $R^{2}$ 's are highly similar to those observed in our main findings in Table VI. This rules out momentum chasing as the driving explanatory mechanism for the observed overvaluation effect of transient institutional investors. As expected, Momentum Returns, itself, increases firm overvaluation significant at the $1\\%$ level as firms experiencing upward momentum in the past intermediate-term will on average continue to exceed their firm-specific fundamental value.  \n\n#### 3.2.3 Firm Opacity  \n\nThird, we examine the possibility that the observed differences between dedicated versus transient investors on overvaluation and misvaluation is due to different investor incentives in gathering information. As such, we would expect any information advantages that dedicated investors use in correcting valuation errors to be stronger for more opaque firms, and transient-induced mispricing to be higher. We measure Firm Opacity as the principal component of known opacity proxies following the approach of Karpoff, Lee, and Masulis (2013) to control for information asymmetry. These opacity proxies include log of firm age, log of firm size, and average bid-ask spread, standard deviation of returns, Amihud ratio, and skewness of the Fama-French 3-factor model residuals over the prior year.17 Since this principal component includes the Amihud ratio and bid-ask spread, this effectively controls for firm liquidity as well.18  \n\nColumns (3) and (4) of Table VII include the Firm Opacity measure as an additional control for availability of information. This appears to strengthen our results from Columns (5) and (6) of Table VI with higher magnitude coefficients on the levels of and changes in dedicated ownership for firm overvaluation and levels of and changes in transient ownership for firm misvaluation and the $R^{2}$ 's are the highest among all specifications we consider. Firm Opacity itself lowers overvaluation and increases misvaluation. This is consistent with information asymmetries playing a role in the effect of institutional investor types on firm valuation, particularly that of dedicated institutional investors with a superior information advantage. We revisit the role of information gathering on the observed results in more detail in Section 4.  \n\n#### 3.2.4  Perceived Growth Opportunities  \n\nFinally, it may also be the case that dedicated and transient institutional investors have distinct perceptions regarding the growth and future value of firms, driving the observed differences in results. Specifically, higher perceived growth opportunities may drive both transient ownership and increased firm overvaluation and misvaluation. To address this concern, we rely on the frm's investment in innovation as a proxy for perceived growth opportunities. We measure R&D Intensity, defined as annual research and development expenses as a ratio to annual sales revenue, to capture the degree to which a firm invests in innovation and growth. A frm with more R&D investment is harder to value correctly given the long-term nature of the investment and is more likely to generate diverging perceptions of growth.19 As such, R&D Intensity proxies for perceived future growth opportunities.  \n\nColumns (5) and (6) of Table VII include R&D Intensity as a control for perceived growth opportunities. The results for the effect of institutional ownership type on frm-specific overvaluation and misvaluation are unchanged - dedicated (transient) institutional investors leads to significantly lower (higher) overvaluation in the next quarter and transient institutional investors lead to significantly higher misvaluation in the next quarter.  \n\n### 3.3  Sector-wide Misvaluation and Long-run Value  \n\nIn the previous section, we study the relationship between institutional investor types and frmspecific overvaluation and misvaluation, including using a firm-specific proxy for differences in perceived growth opportunities. To further explore whether frm-specific characteristics such as perceived growth opportunities drive the observed diferences between investor types and firm valuation, we examine the effect of institutional ownership type on sector-wide misvaluation and long-run market-to-book value from the remaining two components of the RKRV decomposition in equation (1). These components eliminate firm-specific cross-sectional differences, including frmspecific perceived growth opportunities, and allows us to examine institutional investor objectives at the sector level as well as in the long-run.  \n\nThe RKRV sector overvaluation is defined by Rhodes-Kropf, Robinson, and Viswanathan (2005) as the difference between the log of firm value derived from current sector multiples and the log of firm value derived from long-run sector multiples. The RKRV long-run market-to-book value is the difference between the log of fundamental value derived from long-run multiples and the log of book value. Similar to the frm-specific misvaluation measure, we create a sector-wide misvaluation measure as the absolute value of the sector-wide overvaluation measure.  \n\nTable VIII presents the results. Columns (1) through (3) present the baseline results following equation (3) for the sector overvaluation and sector misvaluation measures, as well as the firm's long-run market-to-book value. Column (1) shows that the lagged level of transient ownership increases subsequent sector-wide overvaluation by 0.038 while an increase in transient ownership increases it by 0.053 both significant at the 5% level without controls. Column (2) finds that the lagged level of transient ownership reduces sector-wide misvaluation by 0.032 significant at the $1\\%$ level. The results suggest that while transient ownership increases future sector-wide overvaluation, the magnitude of the overvaluation (i.e., misvaluation) falls in the future. Column (3) finds that both higher levels of dedicated and transient ownership lead to higher long-run market-to-book value, significant at the $1\\%$ level, with a similar effect for an increase in transient ownership.  \n\nThe inclusion of our controls from equation (4) in Columns (4) through (6) of Table VIII absorbs some of the effects. In Column (4), the level of transient ownership increases sector-wide overvaluation by 0.038 and the change in transient ownership increases it by 0.060, both significant at the 5% level. These results are consistent with those observed in Column (1). However, in Column (5) with the inclusion of control variables, transient investors no longer significantly reduce sector misvaluation. This suggests that the previous result in Column (2), where the lagged level of transient investors reduces sector misvaluation, is due to publicly known firm characteristics (as measured by the controls), rather than any specific infuence by the transient investors. Finally, when we include controls in Column (6), we find that the level of dedicated ownership decreases long-run market to book by 0.107, and the change in dedicated ownership decreases long-run market to book by 0.095. Meanwhile, the level of transient ownership increases long-run market to book by 0.083 and the change increases it by 0.109. In other words, after controlling for frm characteristics, dedicated institutional investors appear to have a value preference while transient institutional  \n\ninvestors do not.20  \n\n## 4 The Role of Information in Institutional Valuation  \n\nIn the preceding section we have identified the differential effects of institutional ownership types on firm value and have tested their robustness against alternative explanations. We found that Firm Opacity strengthens our findings, and now seek to further test the information channel.  \n\nIn October 2000 the SEC implemented a selective disclosure and insider trading rule, informally known as Regulation FD, which prohibited selective disclosure of information to institutions and required all material disclosures to be public. As a result, this regulation effectively serves as an exogenous shock to the information advantage previously enjoyed by some well-connected institutions, improving market efficiency (Hefin, Subramanyam, Zhang, 2003), reducing fow of private information to analysts (Francis, Nanda, and Wang, 2006) and reducing informed trading in firms with blockholders and analyst access (Anderson, Reeb, Zhang, and Zhao, 2013). We take advantage of this exogenous shock to examine the importance of dedicated and transient ownership for firm overvaluation and misvaluation. Specifically, we hypothesize that by reducing the information advantage to well-connected dedicated institutions, this regulation will result in lower misvaluation for transient institutional owners that do not possess these connections to the same degree that dedicated intuitional owners do.21  \n\n### 4.1 Exogenous Shock to Institutions’ Information Asymmetry  \n\nThe implementation of Regulation FD (RegFD) allows for a difference-in-difference framework. We identify three potential treatment and control groups designated by three indicator variables, isDED,isTRA, and $T v D$ . The first set is comprised of firms with above-median dedicated institutional ownership at the end of 1999, for which the respective control group is all frms with below-median dedicated ownership. The second, of those with above-median transient institutional ownership with a corresponding below-median transient ownership control. The third set is drawn from a subsample of firms with only above-median dedicated, or transient, institutional ownership, but not both. The treatment group in this subsample are those with above-median transient ownership and the control group are those with above-median dedicated ownership. We define a post-event indicator, $i s F D$ , that takes the value of one from 2001 through 2005 and 0 from 1995 through 1999. We remove 2000 from the sample to avoid any anticipation or adjustments taken by the firms. We also restrict the sample to observations between 1995 and 2005 to get a balanced sample prior to and following the event.  \n\nWe follow a standard difference-in-differences model by including an interaction term between the treatment indicator and the post-event indicator as the difference-in-difference variable in studying our measures of misvaluation, $Y_{i,t}$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{Y_{i,t}=\\alpha+\\beta_{1}i s F D_{t}+\\beta_{2}i s T y p e_{i}+\\beta_{3}i s F D_{t}\\times i s T y p e_{i}+\\beta_{4}p D E D_{i,t-2}}\\ &{\\quad+\\beta_{5}\\Delta p D E D_{i,t-2,t-1}+\\beta_{6}p T R A_{i,t-2}+\\beta_{7}\\Delta p T R A_{i,t-2,t-1}+\\beta_{8}l n T A_{i,t-1}}\\ &{\\quad+\\beta_{9}p I N S T_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{10}H H I.I N S T_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{11}Z s c o r e_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{12}L e v_{i,t-1}}\\ &{\\quad+\\beta_{13}L T C R_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{14}C F d i s p_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{15}N u m E s t_{i,t-1}+f e_{t}+f e_{j}+\\varepsilon_{i,t}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $i s F D$ is the indicator variable for the implementation of Regulation FD after 2000Q4 and captures effects that would occur in firms regardless of treatment effect, isType is the indicator variable for whether the firm has an above-median level of institutional ownership by type (i.e., isDED, isT RA, and $T v D$ ) as of 1999Q4 and captures possible differences between treatment and control groups in the absence of a policy change, and $i s F D\\times i s T y p e$ is the difference-in-difference variable of interest that captures the effect of the policy on the treatment group net of control.  \n\nOne potential complication is changes in treatment/control classification over the estimation period of 1995 through 2005. We control for this by benchmarking the treatment and control classifications to 1999Q4. In other words, a firm is classified based on their institutional ownership at 1999Q4, regardless of how their ownership changes. Additionally, we include the firm's level and change in dedicated and transient institutional ownership to account for any actual changes in institutional ownership that may occur. The coefficients $\\beta_{4}$ through $\\beta_{7}$ absorb effects due to a firm's potential change in in ownership composition after the 1999 classification. We also control for firm characteristics as discussed in Section 3.1. Finally, we control for macroeconomic effects and seasonality with year and quarter fixed effects respectively and for industry trends with SIC3 fixed effects. Standard errors are double clustered by firm and year-quarter.  \n\nPanel A of Table IX presents the results of our difference-in-difference model in equation (5) for the RKRV overvaluation and misvaluation measures. Columns (1) and (2) report findings for the effect of Regulation FD on the valuation of firms held by dedicated institutional investors. As we expect, there is no significant effect on the interaction term between the implementation of RegFD and above-median pre-implementation ownership by the dedicated institutional type both for overvaluation and for misvaluation. This implies that the introduction of RegFD did not change the information available to the better-informed dedicated investors relative to the rest of the market.  \n\nHowever, when we consider the effects of Regulation FD on the valuation of firms with abovemedian pre-implementation ownership by transient institutional investors, we find significant results (at the 5% level) for the expected direction of RKRV overvaluation in Column (3). That is, by mandating public disclosure of material information - thereby reducing the information asymmetry between the less-informed transient and more-informed dedicated institutional investors - RegFD increases the transient investors′ information set and reduces their overvaluation after the regulation is implemented. There is no significant effect of transient institutional investor ownership on the magnitude of misvaluation reported in Column (4).  \n\nColumns (5) and (6) of Table IX compare the valuation effects of above-median transient institutional ownership to that of above-median dedicated ownership in 1999Q4, $T v D$ ,around the RegFD policy change. The treatment group is comprised of only the isTRA frms and the control group is comprised of only the $i s D E D$ frms. This smaller subsample reduces our number of observations to 39,899 firm-quarters. However, this approach allows us to more cleanly address the potential information advantage enjoyed by dedicated institutional investors by directly comparing them to transient ones. Column (5) shows the effect of the policy change on overvaluation, and finds that overvaluation decreases for $T v D$ , which is to say it falls for transient-owned firms relative to dedicated-owned ones. This effect is significant at the 10% level. Furthermore, Column (6)  \n\nshows that the magnitude of misvaluation falls much more strongly for transient-owned relative to dedicated-owned firms, significant at the 1% level.  \n\nThese results suggest that following Regulation FD and the easier availability of information, the overvaluation and misvaluation observed previously with transient investors are mitigated. In Panel B of Table IX, we check the robustness of the above difference-in-difference results around the RegFD event with a placebo test. Specifically, we pick a counterfactual year for the exogenous shock event and repeat the difference-in-differences analysis to test whether the effect we observed around 2000, the implementation of RegFD, is spurious. We select 1995 as the counterfactual year and conduct the analysis over three-year pre- and post-event windows to minimize overlap with the timeframe considered in the main analysis in Panel A.  \n\nThe counterfactual analysis in Panel B of Table IX shows only a weakly significant negative effect on the direction of RKRV misvaluation for firms with above-median transient ownership in Column (3). More notably, there is no effect in Columns (5) and (6) on the change in direction and magnitude of RKRV misvaluation on firms held by transient versus dedicated institutions. This absence of an effect in a counterfactual year supports the validity of our analysis in Panel A and suggests that information availability plays a large role in observed misvaluation effects by the different institutional investor types.  \n\nThere are two potential explanations for our results thus far: either institutional investor types cause distinct value effects on the firms they own in the subsequent quarter, or they simply choose to own firms that are distinctly different to begin with (i.e., selection bias) and these differences persist. While our analysis is predictive and uses both lagged levels and changes of explanatory variables, we seek to further distinguish between these two potential explanations. To do this, we use the Mahalanobis (1936) distance measure to match each firm prior to the enactment of Regulation FD in 2000 that has above-median dedicated or transient ownership with a contemporaneous control frm that does not, but is similarly misvalued both at the frm and sector levels and has a similar size and book-to-market ratio. We create an alternative set of matches using propensity score matching. We discuss the matching process quality and results in Appendix B.2. The matched-firm tests around Regulation FD in the appendix show that these overvaluation and misvaluation effects are not merely due to institutional self-selection into frms. The overvaluation and misvaluation of firms owned by transient institutions falls relative to that of matched control firms around the implementation of the regulation in the difference-in-difference analysis, and this decrease is significantly greater than that for firms owned by dedicated institutions in the difference-indifference-in-difference.  \n\nOverall the findings around the Regulation FD exogenous shock to the informational advantage of dedicated institutional investors point to both future overvaluation and future misvaluation falling for firms owned by transient institutions. This is to be expected as the SEC regulation puts transient investors on a more even footing with their better-informed dedicated counterparts. These results also support the interpretation of asymmetric information as one channel for the observed differences between firms owned by dedicated and transient investors. Furthermore, matched-firm analysis rules out self-selection by institutions into misvalued firms as the explanation.  \n\n### 4.2  Individual Characteristics of Institutional Investor Types  \n\nHaving established that dedicated and transient institutional investors have different impacts on firm overvaluation and misvaluation, we examine the individual investor characteristics that form the dedicated and transient classifications, specifically investor portfolio turnover and holdings concentration. By considering the individual portfolio characteristics separately, we test whether the information advantage enjoyed by dedicated institutions documented in Section 4 is primarily due to their concentration or duration of ownership. To do this, we classify institutions based on the individual characteristics of portfolio turnover and concentration of ownership.  \n\nFollowing Yan and Zhang (2009), we measure the portfolio turnover of each institutional investor based on the prior four quarters. In each quarter, we calculate the aggregate purchase and sale of each institutional investor based on the changes in portfolio value of purchases and sales between the current and previous quarter:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{A g\\_b u y s_{k,t}=\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in N_{k}}\\left\\lvert S_{k,i,t}P_{i,t}-S_{k,i,t-1}P_{i,t-1}-S_{k,i,t-1}\\Delta P_{i,t}\\right\\rvert,w h e r e S_{i,t}>S_{i,t-1}}\\ &{}\\ &{A g_{-}s e l l s_{k,t}=\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in N_{k}}\\left\\lvert S_{k,i,t}P_{i,t}-S_{k,i,t-1}P_{i,t-1}-S_{k,i,t-1}\\Delta P_{i,t}\\right\\rvert,w h e r e S_{i,t}\\leq S_{i,t-1}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $S_{k,i,t}$ is the number of shares held by investor $k$ in firm $i$ in quarter $t$ and $P_{i,t}$ is the share price  \n\nOof firm $i$ inquarter $t$ . We then take the minimum between the aggregate purchase and aggregate sale in each quarter and divide by the average portfolio value between the current and previous quarter, providing us with a churn rate for each institution in each quarter:  \n\n$$\nC R_{k,t}=\\frac{\\operatorname*{min}(A g_{-}b u y s_{k,t},A g_{-}s e l l s_{k,t})}{\\sum_{i\\in N_{k}}\\frac{S_{k,i,t}P_{i,t}+S_{k,i,t-1}P_{i,t-1}}{2}}\n$$  \n\nWe take the average churn rate over the past four quarters as our measure for portfolio turnover.  \n\nSimilarly, following Bushee (1998, 2001), we measure holdings concentration of each institutional investor. We start with the institutional holding of each frm in the portfolio, that is the number of shares held in a firm that institutional investor as a ratio over the shares outstanding for the firm:  \n\n$$\nI O H o l d_{k,i,t}=\\frac{S_{k,i,t}}{S_{i,t}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $S_{k,i,t}$ is the number of shares held by investor $k$ in firm $i$ in quarter $t$ and $S_{i,t}$ is the number of shares outstanding for firm $i$ in quarter $t$ . To calculate holdings concentration, we take the average of the squared institutional holding over the institutional investor's portfolio of firms:22  \n\n$$\nI O C o n c_{k,t}=\\frac{1}{N_{k}}\\sum_{i\\in N_{k}}I O H o l d_{k,i,t}^{2}.\n$$  \n\nThis measure has the interpretation that if the investor tends to be a blockholder in the firms of their portfolio, then on average they take concentrated positions in their holdings.  \n\nHypothesis 3. Firms with a higher percentage of long-horizon or focused (short-horizon or diversified) institutional investors experience less (more) overvaluation and misvaluation.  \n\nHypothesis 4. Firms that experience an increase in long-horizon or focused (short-horizon or diversified) institutional investors ecperience less (more) overvaluation and misvaluation.  \n\nWe form terciles based on portfolio turnover in each quarter, and select the top turnover tercile as the “short-horizon\" institutional type, and the bottom tercile as the “long-horizon\". Similarly, we form terciles based on holdings concentration in each quarter and take the top tercile as the 22For robustne, w also take the su of the squardititutionalhlings andal rsultshl.  \n\n\"focused\" institutional type, and the bottom as the “\"diversified\". For each frm in our sample, we then compute the percentage held by each of these institutional investor types. We also identify the joint percentage held by institutions in specific terciles of both portfolio turnover and concentration. That is, we estimate the percentage of the firm owned by long-horizon and focused institutional investors as that held by institutions that are both in the lowest portfolio turnover tercile and the highest concentration tercile. We create analogous ownership percentages for the three other possible combinations of institutional investor types based on portfolio turnover and holdings concentration.  \n\nFinally, as before, we decompose the lagged level of each single-dimensional institutional ownership type (long/short horizon, focused/diversified portfolio) into a second lag of the level and frst lag of the change in the ownership by a given institutional investor type. While correlation between these fundamental types is approximately 40% (see Table IV), the results are not driven by multicollinearity as they are robust to the inclusion of only one type at a time. These results are suppressed for brevity.  \n\nTable X presents the effects of these fundamental institutional ownership types on RKRV overvaluation and misvaluation in the full sample, as well as the pre- and post- RegFD subsamples. Panel A presents the full-sample results for next quarter's firm-specific RKRV overvaluation and the absolute magnitude of misvaluation. Column (1) of Panel A shows that overall the lagged level and change in long-horizon institutional ownership surprisingly results in higher subsequent overvaluation significant at the 1% and $10\\%$ levels respectively, but notably so does lagged change in short-horizon institutional ownership, also significant at the $1\\%$ level. There is no ownership effect on the absolute magnitude of misvaluation in Column (2) for long-horizon ownership but both the lagged level and change in short-horizon institutional ownership increases the magnitude of misvaluation significant at the 5% level in both cases.  \n\nColumns (3) and (4) of Panel A present analogous full-sample findings for the focused and diversified institutional types. Consistent with expectations, we find that lagged levels and changes in focused institutional ownership decrease overvaluation, significant at the $10\\%$ and $1\\%$ levels respectively. Also consistent with prior results, lagged levels and changes in diversified ownership increase overvaluation with 1% level of significance for both. However, in Column (4) we find that it is only the diversified institutional types that reduce the magnitude of frm misvaluation, with both the level and change effects significant at the 5% and $10\\%$ levels respectively.  \n\nColumns (5) and (6) consider the joint effects of institutional portfolio turnover and concentration. Notice that long-horizon and focused investors are more likely to be dedicated whereas short-horizon and diversified investors are more likely to be transient investors. We find that the effect of focused institutional ownership reduces subsequent overvaluation in Column (5) regardless of its joint pairing with long- or short-horizon ownership. Similarly, diversified ownership increases subsequent overvaluation regardless of pairing with horizon types. Consistent with Column (4), we find in Column (6) that diversified ownership reduces the magnitude of misvaluation regardless of any joint effects with institutional investment horizon. This result is surprising given that we previously found that TRA investors, those most likely to be short and diversified, increase the magnitude of misvaluation.  \n\nGiven the information advantage for TRA investors with the enactment of Regulation FD, we split our full sample into pre- and post- RegFD to test whether the disclosure requirement had an effect on the fundamental institutional ownership types. Panel B presents results for the pre-RegFD (pre-2000) subsample and Panel C presents results for the post-RegFD (post-2000) subsample. The results along the horizon dimension are similar to that of the full sample (see Columns (1) and (2). However, when we turn our attention to focused and diversifed investors, we see that prior to the enactment of Regulation FD, ownership by diversified investors in Columns (3) and (4) as well as that by short-horizon diversified investors in Columns (5) and (6) increases the magnitude of misvaluation. It is only in the post-RegFD period that this reverses in Panel C. These results suggest that the concentration of institutional ownership is primarily responsible for the information advantage enjoyed by DED investors and reinforce the idea that Regulation FD provided TRA institutions with the information that previously fowed only to DED investors. This importance of blockholder status in obtaining private information prior to the implementation of RegFD is consistent with the fndings of Anderson, Reeb, Zhang, and Zhao (2013).  \n\nOverall these findings present mixed evidence for Hypotheses 3 and 4, due to the regime change in the distribution of information after RegFD. To a large degree, the effects of long-horizon and focused ownership appear to occur prior to the implementation of the SEC regulation. The effects of diversified institutional ownership in reducing misvaluation only appear after its passage.  \n\n## 5 Institutional Investor Types, Governance, and Performance  \n\nIn the preceding sections we consider a puzzle in the literature regarding the effect of institutional investors on frm value. Several papers document the ability of institutional investors to acquire information, improve governance, and make markets more effcient (Lakonishok, Shleifer, Vishny, 1992; Nesbitt, 1994; Sias and Starks, 1997; Nagel, 2005; Barber and Odean, 2008) while other research finds results suggestive of opportunism without long-term benefit, and with potentially destabilizing value effects (Gillian, 1995; Karpoff, Malatesta, and Walkling, 1996; Smith, 1996; Wermers, 1999; Barton and Wiseman, 2014). The differential effect on firm value by institutional investor type that we document provides a view towards reconciling this tension in the literature. Institutional investors are indeed not all the same: some reduce overvaluation and misvaluation, while others stoke it.  \n\nExamining diferent institutional investor types can also help refine prior findings regarding the role of institutions and blockholders on corporate governance and long-term firm performance. Some studies have shown that institutional investors improve governance (Gillan and Starks, 2000; Hartzell and Starks, 2003), while others find no effect (Agarwal and Knoeber, 1996; Karpoff, Malatesta, and Walkling, 1996). Recent work in asset pricing research also demonstrates that holding period matters for performance studies (Kamara, Korajcyk, Lou, Sadka, 2016; Chaudhuri and Lo, 2016). In this section, we examine some common frm governance and performance measures to gain additional insight on the roles that different institutional investor types play.  \n\nTable XI Panel A reports findings about the effect of institutional investor type on key characteristics related to firm performance and risk as well as corporate governance. We find that firms held by dedicated institutions have lower realized volatility and lower average, median, and maximum executive compensation. Firms held by transient institutions have higher tail risk, as proxied by the $I V s p r e a d_{m o n}$ implied volatility spread between out-of-the-money and in-themoney puts, higher realized volatility, higher executive pay, lower payout ratios, and lower leverage increases than those in firms held by dedicated institutions.23  \n\n23Borochin and Yang (2016)fnd that change in the implied volatility spread across option moneyness predits  \n\nWhile the information advantage enjoyed by dedicated institutional investors prior to the implementation of RegFD clearly plays a role in their effects on firm overvaluation and misvaluation, it is not obvious that the firm characteristics considered in Table XI should be impacted due to having private information. We test this by subsampling into pre- and post- RegFD subsamples in Panels B and C respectively, and find that the effects of dedicated and transient ownership on the firm characteristics related to good governance are largely consistent through time. The only notable exception to this is the payout ratio whose negative coefficients become similar in magnitude post-2000. Overall, these results suggest that some, but not all, institutional investors provide governance benefits, consistent with Chen, Harford, and Li (2007).  \n\nIn Table XII, we again deompose investors along investor horizon and portfolio concentration and consider the joint pairings between the two portfolio characteristics. We find that long-horizon ownership levels and changes are associated with lower historical volatility, higher payout ratios, and net leverage increases, largely invariant to the dimension of the concentration of ownership. At the same time, short-horizon ownership is associated with higher tail risk, higher executive compensation, and lower payout ratios, also largely invariant to portfolio concentration. Some, but not all, institutional investors do provide governance benefits consistent with Chen, Harford and Li (2007).  \n\nTherefore, while the effects of dedicated and transient ownership on firm overvaluation and misvaluation are shown to be largely due to the holdings concentration dimension in Table X, the corporate governance effects of these institutional investor types appear largely due to the portfolio turnover dimension as shown in Table XII. The changes in over- and misvaluation effects found for dedicated and transient ownership around the implementation of RegFD, coupled with their strong relation to the holdings concentration dimension, suggest that the concentration dimension in particular was sensitive to the information effect from RegFD. The largely time-invariant firm characteristics in Table XI, coupled with their strong relation to the portfolio turnover dimension, suggest that institutional variation on investment horizon was not as big a driver of informational asymmetries addressed by RegFD.  \n\nNext, we test the economic significance of institutional ownership types by considering the raw everage increase and is a signifcant signal of frm quality and is related to other quality firm characteristics.  \n\nand risk-adjusted performance of firms held by each institutional type over the following year. This analysis captures the long-term effects of institutional ownership type on the firm and is particularly relevant to other market participants investing alongside these institutions. In calculating riskadjusted returns, we benchmark to the Pastor and Stambaugh (2003) 5-factor model. Table XIII reports the raw performance over each of the next four quarters in Columns (1) through (4) and the 5-factor abnormal performance in Columns (5) through (8).  \n\nWe find that firms held by transient institutions have insignificant or negative raw returns over the next four quarters. Conversely, frms held by dedicated institutions have positive raw returns over the same period. The results become more compelling when we consider abnormal, rather than raw, performance. Transient institutional ownership results in highly significant and positive abnormal returns in the first quarter, consistent with the previously documented myopic objectives of transient institutions (Bushee, 1998, 2001). However, these firms have no abnormal performance in any subsequent period considered. On the other hand, firms held by dedicated institutions have significant abnormal performance in the second and third quarters, consistent with their long-term value objectives. Market participants may therefore be able to observe the type of institutional ownership and use it as a guide for the horizon of expected future performance.  \n\nFinally, we follow the monthly raw and risk-adjusted returns of firms over the next year in Figures 2 and 3. Figure 2 tracks the monthly returns and abnormal returns for firms with dedicated and transient institutional investors in Panels A and B, respectively. Consistent with the analysis in Table XIII, firms with more dedicated institutional investors realize raw returns of 17.7% over the following year, whereas firms with more transient institutional investors realize raw returns Of $14.7\\%$ . That is, firms with more dedicated investors achieve 3.0% higher returns than those with more transient investors. However, when we turn to risk-adjusted or abnormal returns, frms with more dedicated (transient) institutional investors earn returns of $4.1\\%$ (3.8%), resulting in a difference of $0.3\\%$  \n\nFigure 3 repeats the previous figure by separating institutional investors based on portfolio turnover and holdings concentration. Panels A and B of Figure 3 present the raw and riskadjusted returns for frms with more long-horizon or short-horizon institutional investors. Panels C and D present the raw and risk-adjusted returns for firms with more focused or diversified institutional investors. We see that frms with more long-horizon institutional investors realize raw (abnormal) returns of 19.3% (5.7 $\\%$ ) over the following year, whereas firms with more short-horizon institutional investors realize raw (abnormal) returns of 13.3% (2.9%) over the next year. This leaves firms with more long-horizon institutional investors with raw (abnormal) returns that are 6.0% (2.8%) higher than firms with more short-horizon investors. In contrast, firms with more focused institutional investors realize raw (abnormal) returns of $15.2\\%$ (2.7 $\\%$ )while firms with more diversified institutional investors realize raw (abnormal） returns of $16.1\\%$ (4.9%) over the next year. This results in firms with more focused institutional investors earning raw (abnormal) returns 0.9% (2.1%) lower than firms with more diversified institutional investors. The net negative effect of focused investors is offset by the net positive effect of long-horizon investors, resulting in the 0.3% abnormal returns observed for dedicated investors in Figure 2.  \n\nThese figures support the earlier finding that the higher firm performance observed with dedicated institutional investors, which are defined by Bushee (1998) as focused, long-term investors, is driven by lower portfolio turnover rather than by higher holdings concentration. Furthermore, this superior long-horizon performance more broadly suggests that long-horizon investors are able to accomplish their investment objectives. In addition to providing insight about the causes of dedicated investor performance, these results have wider implications regarding the existence of portfolio manager ability. While we are able to demonstrate the ability of long-horizon managers to achieve long-horizon returns, our data may not be captured at a sufficiently high enough frequency to address the ability of short-horizon managers to achieve short-horizon returns. At any rate, we do not find any superior short-term performance by frms they hold in our sample.  \n\n## 6 Conclusion  \n\nInstitutional ownership can have starkly different effects on firm valuation, depending on the type and objectives of the institutional investor. Dedicated institutional investor ownership reduces future misvaluation, while transient institutional investor ownership increases it. Using the Bushee (1998, 2001) classification of institutional investor types, we show these effects on the direction and magnitude of the firm-specific valuation error relative to fundamentals from Rhodes-Kropf, Robinson, and Viswanathan (2005). Specifically, dedicated institutional ownership is correlated with lower future frm-specific misvaluation and long-run valuation multiples, whereas transient institutional ownership has the opposite relationship. We find similar effects for the absolute magnitude of misvaluation, with dedicated institutional ownership reducing the magnitude of frmspecific misvaluation and transient institutional ownership increasing it.  \n\nFurthermore, decomposing the level of institution ownership by type into the prior period's level and the change with respect to the current period, we find that changes in ownership type have the same effect as the level. This suggests that the effects of institutional ownership types become stronger as the degree of institutional ownership of that particular type becomes more pronounced. These results persist and become stronger in the presence of measures of information quality, suggesting a connection between ownership type and the ability to access firm-specific information. These results are robust to the inclusion of control variables, the use of alternative misvaluation measure, and the examination of alternative explanations.  \n\nWe examine this relationship between firm misvaluation and institutional investor type further using the exogenous shock of the SEC's introduction of Regulation Fair Disclosure (RegFD) in 2000, which requires frms to disclose material information publicly. Prior to this regulation, frms could reveal information to preferred institutional owners, contributing to the informational advantage enjoyed by them. We find evidence consistent with an informational advantage enjoyed by dedicated institutional owners prior to the introduction of RegFD in 2000. The policy change reduces both future overvaluation and misvaluation experienced by firms with transient institutional owners.  \n\nWe also consider more fundamental institutional investor types along the dimensions of portfolio turnover and portfolio concentration. We find that ownership by focused institutions is largely related to lower overvaluation and misvaluation, with the opposite being true for ownership by diversified institutions. That is, of the two portfolio characteristics underlying the transient and dedicated investor types, portfolio concentration drives more of the observed relationship between type and future overvaluation and misvaluation.  \n\nFinally, we demonstrate that institutional ownership types have effects on key firm characteristics that are related to corporate governance. Dedicated (transient) institutions hold frms with less (more) tail risk, historical volatility, and mean, median, and maximum executive compensation. Additionally, dedicated institutions hold firms with less earnings management, higher payouts, and higher leverage increases. We find that these characteristics are stable over time and not sensitive to the information effects from RegFD. Furthermore, we find that they are largely due to the portfolio turnover dimension than the portfolio concentration dimension.  \n\nThese differential institutional ownership effects also have real performance implications for investors. Over the subsequent year, firms held by transient institutions experience abnormal positive performance only in the frst quarter, whereas those held by dedicated institutions have positive abnormal and raw returns in later quarters. This difference in performance appears to be also largely due to the portfolio turnover dimension, as firms held by long-horizon institutions outperform those held by short-horizon ones over subsequent year. This is consistent with the objectives of transient (short-term) and dedicated (long-term) institutions, but has profound implications on the expected effects of institutional ownership for other market participants. This also demonstrates that long-horizon institutional investors are able to achieve superior long-term performance, adding to our understanding of investment manager ability.  \n\nThese results provide a new perspective on the multifaceted nature of institutional investors. We find that there are distinct roles that different types of institutional investors play in setting firm valuations. Institutional types also have distinct effects on corporate governance and future firm performance. Separating institutional ownership by type helps towards resolving standing arguments in the literature about the role of institutional investors in the financial markets.  \n\n## References  \n\nAgrawal, A., and C.

In particular, Section B.1 presents findings using an alternative measure of misvaluation based managerial issuance and repurchase behavior following Hirshleifer and Jiang (2010). Section B.2 presents matched-firm results by misvaluation to rule out self-selection of institutional investor types into misvalued firms.  \n\n### Appendix B.1  Alternative Measure for Misvaluation  \n\nWe test the robustness of our findings by repeating the analysis in Table VI using an alternative measure of overvaluation and misvaluation. Hirshleifer and Jiang (2010) hypothesize that managers who have insider information that their firm is overvalued will issue equity to take advantage of this. Conversely, managers will repurchase equity if they have private information about frm undervaluation. The authors propose an undervalued-minus-overvalued (UMO) factor as a portfolio that takes long positions in equity repurchasers and shorts equity issuers and finds that this factor is able to identify overvalued and undervalued firms by its explanatory power for the firm's returns. We take the negative of the beta on the UMO factor - that is the negative of the coefficient of the firm's exposure to the UMO factor - as our measure of HJ misvaluation to be consistent with the direction of the RKRV misvaluation measure (i.e., in the direction of overvaluation). This HJ measure is based on managerial repurchase and issuance behavior, rather than on fundamental multiples as with the RKRV measure. Since the HJ measure is derived with respect to a completely different set of information than the RKRV measure, we can expect the two to serve as robustness checks for one another.  \n\nTo estimate the HJ measure for misvaluation, we estimate the frm's exposure to Hirshleifer and Jiang's (2010) UMO factor using rolling 60-month regressions:  \n\n$$\nr_{i,t}=\\alpha_{i}+\\beta_{1,i,t}M K T R F_{t}+\\beta_{2,i,t}S M B_{t}+\\beta_{3,i,t}H M L_{t}+\\beta_{4,i,t}U M D_{t}+\\beta_{5,i,t}U M O_{t}+\\varepsilon_{i,t}.\n$$  \n\nA positive coefficient on UMO proxies for undervaluation. However, for consistency with the direction of the RKRV measure, we define the HJ measure of misvaluation as $-\\hat{\\beta}_{5}$ Suchthat it remains positive (negative) in the direction of overvaluation (undervaluation). As with the RKRV measure, we take the absolute value of the HJ measure to proxy for the magnitude of misvaluation.  \n\nTable B.1 displays the results of estimating equations (2), (3), and (4) for the HJ measure of overvaluation and its absolute value proxying for misvaluation. Column (1) fnds results consistent with Column (1) of Table VI, with the lagged level of transient institutional ownership resulting in a positive and significant HJ coefficient, consistent with more overvaluation. Column (2) reports similar results for the absolute value of the factor loading as a proxy for the magnitude of misvaluation.A $100\\%$ increase in the level of transient ownership increases the loading on the overvaluation factor by 0.228 and the magnitude of misvaluation by 0.460. This is consistent with prior findings for the RKRV measure for transient institutional ownership.  There are no statistically significant effects for dedicated institutional ownership, implying that dedicated institutional investor ownership does not significantly increase overvaluation or misvaluation in the subsequent quarter.  \n\nColumns (3) and (4) of Table B.I repeats the decomposition of the lagged level of ownership into the second lag of the level and the first lag of the change in the level of ownership to estimate the dynamic effect of institutional ownership on overvaluation and misvaluation. The positive coeficient on the overvaluation factor loading is consistent with prior findings in Column (3) of Table VI, though only the level of transient ownership has a significant effect. However, both the level and change in transient ownership have the expected positive relationship with the magnitude of misvaluation in Column (4), consistent with the results in Column (4) of Table VI.  \n\nFinally, columns (5) and (6) of Table B.I use the HJ valuation measures in the estimation of the full model with controls, as in equation (4). Column (5) of Table B.I finds the level of transient institutional ownership leading to a subsequent increase in overvaluation significant at the 5% level, consistent with prior results. Column (6) finds stronger results that both the level and change of transient institutional ownership increases the magnitude of misvaluation while the level of dedicated ownership reduces it in the subsequent quarter, all significant at the 1% level.  \n\nWe therefore establish a robust relationship between institutional investor ownership by type, both in levels and changes of ownership, and both overvaluation and misvaluation at the firm level.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Misval.

While our analysis is predictive and uses both lagged levels and changes of explanatory variables, we seek to further distinguish between these two potential explanations.  \n\nTo do this, we use a matching algorithm to find a control firm with a similar prior overvaluation at both the firm and sector levels, but different institutional ownership type for each (treatment) frm held by a particular institutional ownership type around the Regulation FD shock. This is similar to the approach taken by Almeida, Campello, Laranjeira and Wesibenner (2011) and Williamson and Yang (2016). Specifically, we use the Mahalanobis (1936) distance measure to match each firm prior to the enactment of Regulation FD in 2000 that has above-median dedicated or transient ownership with a contemporaneous control firm that does not, but is similarly misvalued both at the firm and sector levels and has similar size and book-to-market ratio. The advantage of using the Mahalanobis distance matching algorithm is that this algorithm ensures a match on each of the matching characteristics, rather than relying on a propensity score.24 As summarized in Table B.lI, the match quality is good: there are no significant differences between the sample and  control frms for above-median  dedicated $(i s D E D$ ),above-median transient (isT RA), or above-median transient and below-median dedicated institutional ownership (isTvD) across the characteristics being matched.  \n\nWe examine differences in next-period misvaluation by ownership type (isDED, isT RA, TuD) before and after the implementation of Regulation FD. Similarly, we also test this difference for Mahalanobis-matched control frms that are similarly overvalued in the current period, but do not have above-median ownership by the same institutional owner type. Next, we test the difference-indifference between the treatment and control firms. This difference-in-difference provides us with a cleaner measure of whether there is a significant misvaluation change around RegFD implementation due to each ownership type. Furthermore, our framework allows us to test the difference in the difference-in-difference for $i s D E D$ against the difference-in-difference for isTRA, essentially providing us with a difference-in-difference-in-difference. This is the difference between firms with above-median dedicated ownership versus above-median transient ownership, taking into account both the time effect (i.e., pre- and post- RegFD) as well as the selection bias (i.e., relative to their matched control firms). This framework is thus robust against the explanation of institutional self-selection for our findings of the effect of ownership type on next quarter's overvaluation and misvaluation.  \n\nTable B.III summarizes the results of this difference analysis of next quarter's firm-specific overvaluation and misvaluation relative to control firms chosen using Mahalanobis distance matching based on contemporaneous RKRV firm- and sector-specific overvaluation, size, and book to market ratio. Panel A presents the results for next quarter's RKRV frm-specific overvaluation measure. We observe that the firms with high dedicated ownership (isDED=1), in Row (a), have no significant overvaluation one year prior to the implementation of RegFD in Column (1), and substantially higher overvaluation one year post in Column (2). The difference between the two, reported at 0.208 in Column (3), is also statistically significant indicative of an increase in overvaluation after the implementation of RegFD. This result may be due either to an increase in market effciency as was the intention of RegFD,25 or to the overall increase in overvaluation in the market. The matched control firms do demonstrate a similar increase in overvaluation between pre- and post- RegFD periods of 0.180 in Column (6). Notably, there are no significant differencein-differences in the changes in overvaluation of firms held by dedicated investors relative to the controls around RegFD in Column (7), suggesting the absence of an informational effect due to Regulation FD on dedicated institutional investors.  \n\nWe next consider the future overvaluation of firms with high transient ownership ( $i s T R A=1$ in Row (b), which are significantly overvalued both pre- and post- RegFD in Columns (1) and (2) respectively. The difference of 0.083 is significant at the 5% level in Column (3). However, we see a much greater increase in overvaluation for the matched control frms in Columns (4) through (6) with a difference in control firm overvaluation around the implementation of RegFD of 0.306 significant at the $1\\%$ level. This larger change in the control firms implies that there is an overall reduction in the overvaluation of frms held by transients around RegFD in the differencein-difference test in Column (7), with a magnitude of -0.223 significant at the 1% level. That is, when controlling for the self-selection of institutional types into firms using firm characteristics and contemporaneous firm- and sector-specific overvaluation, we find that the implementation of RegFD results in transient institutional ownership resulting in significantly less future firm-specific Overvaluation, consistent with Table IX.  \n\nWe further compare the difference-in-difference results in Column (7) for transient and dedicated institutions to obtain a diference-in-difference-in-difference between the two institutional investor types relative to matched controls around the implementation of RegFD in Column (8). We find a coefficient of -0.251 significant at the $1\\%$ level, implying that the decrease in future overvaluation of frms held by transients relative to matched controls, when compared to that of frms held by dedicated institutions relative to controls, itself decreased markedly around the implementation of the RegFD disclosure requirement. In other words, transient institutional ownership results in less overvaluation after RegFD than dedicated ownership, controlling for contemporaneous Overvaluation.  \n\nFinally, we refine the sample to exclude firms that have both above-median dedicated and transient ownership, creating the indicator variable $T v D$ which takes the value of 1 only  when the firm has above-median transient ownership and below-median dedicated ownership and 0 only when the firm has above-median dedicated ownership and below-median transient ownership. This additional restriction removes potential confounding effects of observing the effects of both institutional investor types on the same firm. The results for $T v D$ , in Row (c), in Columns (1) through (7) closely match those of isTRA frms, with overvaluation falling relative to matched control firms after the implementation of RegFD. These findings for the transient-held frms suggest that transient institutional investors experienced an information effect on future overvaluation around the implementation of RegFD.  \n\nPanel B of Table B.IHI considers a similar matched-firm analysis for the next quarter's firmspecific RKRV misvaluation. We find that firms with above-median dedicated ownership in Row (a) do not experience a significant change in the absolute magnitude of misvaluation relative to control firms in the difference-in-difference analysis in Column (7) of Panel B. Firms with above-median transient ownership in Row (b), on the other hand, experience a reduction of 0.175 in the magnitude of misvaluation relative to control frms significant at the 1% level in Column (7). Furthermore, the difference-in-difference-in-difference test in Column (8) also finds a reduction of 0.121 in the absolute magnitude of future firm-specific misvaluation between the transient-held frms and their controls relative to dedicated-held firms and their controls around RegFD. When we exclude firms with both above-median transient and dedicated ownership in the TvD analysis in Row (c) in Panel B, we also observe a 0.164 reduction in the magnitude of misvaluation with a 5% significance level.  \n\nThe matched-firm tests show that these overvaluation and misvaluation effects are not merely due to institutional self-selection into frms based on current valuation since we select control firms using contemporaneous firm- and sector-specific overvaluation. The overvaluation and misvaluation of firms owned by transient institutions falls relative to that of matched control firms around the implementation of the regulation in the difference-in-difference analysis, and this decrease is significantly greater than that for firms owned by dedicated institutions in the difference-indifference-in-difference.  \n\nTable B.1l: Mahalanobis distance matching algorithm. Using Mahalanobis distance matching, the single nearest neighbor is identified as a control firm for each treatment firm. Columns (1), (4), and (7) report the means of matching characteristics for the actual DED, TRA, or TvD frms, respectively. Columns (2), (5), and (8) report the means of matching characteristics for the matched nearest neighbor to the actual DED, TRA, or TvD firms, respectively. Columns (3), (6), and (9) reports the p-values of the t-test of difference in means of matching characteristics for DED, TRA, or TvD matching, respectively. isDED is equal to 1 if the percentage of dedicated institutional investors within a frm falls into the upper tercile and 0 otherwise. isTRA is equal to 1 if the percentage of transient institutional investors within a firm falls into the upper tercile and O otherwise. isTvD contrasts isTRA=1 firms against isDED=1 firms and is equal to 1 if the percentage of transient institutional investors within a firm falls into the upper tercile and the percentage of dedicated institutional investors within a frm falls into the bottom tercile and O if the percentage of transient institutional investors within a firm falls into the bottom tercile and the percentage of dedicated institutional investors within a firm falls into the upper tercile.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"3\">isDED=1</td><td colspan=\"3\">isTRA= 1</td><td colspan=\"3\">isTvD= 1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Actual (1)</td><td>Matched (2)</td><td>p-val (3)</td><td>Actual (4)</td><td>Matched (5)</td><td>p-val (6)</td><td>Actual (7)</td><td>Matched (8)</td><td>p-val (9)</td></tr><tr><td>RKRV (Firm) Overvali,t-1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.062</td><td>0.066</td><td>0.609</td><td>0.155</td><td>0.151</td><td>0.574</td><td>0.177</td><td>0.167</td><td>0.399</td></tr><tr><td>RKRVSector Overvali,t-1</td><td>0.137</td><td>0.138</td><td>0.927</td><td>0.152</td><td>0.150</td><td>0.464</td><td>0.150</td><td>0.147</td><td>0.528</td></tr><tr><td>Log Total Assetsi,t-1</td><td>5.236</td><td>5.217</td><td>0.254</td><td>5.242</td><td>5.230</td><td>0.532</td><td>5.183</td><td>5.184</td><td>0.986</td></tr><tr><td>Book-to-Market Ratioi,t-1</td><td>0.556</td><td>0.551</td><td>0.258</td><td>0.502</td><td>0.504</td><td>0.681</td><td>0.497</td><td>0.499</td><td>0.698</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"14\">TRA-DED Treatment-Control Panel A: RKRV Overvaluation Control Treatment</td><td rowspan=\"8\">Diff-in-diff-in-diff -0.251 *** Diff-in-diff -0.223*** 0.028 (0.047) 1-yr Post-Pre 0.180 *** 0.306 *** (9) (0.034) 1-yr Post-RegFD 0.268 *** 0.474 *** 5 (0.036) 1-yr Pre-RegFD 0.169 *** (4) 0.088 ** (0.037) 1-yr Post-Pre 0.208 *** 0.083 ** (0.033) 1-yr Post-RegFD 0.262 *** 0.312 *** (0.033) 1-yr Pre-RegFD 0.229 *** 0.054 (0.036) (a) Treatment: isDED=1</td><td rowspan=\"8\">(0.075) -0.299 *** (0.049) (0.068) 0.277 *** (0.031) (0.042) 0.444 *** (0.037) (0.053) 0.167 *** (0.037) (0.051) (0.039) -0.022 (0.054) 0.286 *** (0.034) (0.056) *** 808'0 (0.041) (0.062) (b) Treatment: isTRA=1 (c) Treatment: isTvD=1</td><td rowspan=\"8\">Panel B: RKRV Misvaluation</td><td rowspan=\"8\">Diff-in-diff-in-diff TRA-DED 8 Treatment-Control Diff-in-diff 1-yr Post-Pre 1-yr Post-RegFD Control 5 1-yr Pre-RegFD (4) 1-yr Post-Pre 1-yr Post-RegFD 1-yr Pre-RegFD</td><td rowspan=\"8\">(a)Treatment: isDED=1</td><td rowspan=\"8\"></td><td rowspan=\"8\">0.760 *** 0.653 *** (0.022) (0.026)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.121 ** (0.059) -0.175 *** (0.040)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.054 (0.037) 0.121 *** 0.058 ** (0.026) (0.027)</td></tr><tr><td>0.675 *** (0.024)</td></tr><tr><td>0.738 *** (0.024) (0.035) (0.030)</td></tr><tr><td>0.616 *** 0.639 *** 0.629 *** (0.021) (0.022)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.055 * (0.029) -0.055 (0.041)</td></tr><tr><td>0.004 (0.026) 0.629 *** 0.599 *** 0.641 *** (0.020) (0.023) (0.037)</td></tr><tr><td>Treatment 0.625 *** 0.697 *** (0.042) (b) Treatment: isTRA=1 (c) Treatment: isTvD=1</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTable I: List of top ten dedicated and transient institutional investors by average portfolio size.

Dedicated institutional investors, as defined in Bushee (1998, 2001), are characterized as having concentrated holdings in the firms in their portfolios with low turnover. In contrast, transient institutional investors are characterized as having diversified holdings in the firms in their portfolios with high turnover.

Panel A shows the buyand-hold monthly returns for firms with more transient institutional investors than the median firm and firms with more dedicated institutional investors than the median firm. Panel B shows the buy-and-hold abnormal returns based on the Pastor and Stambaugh (2005) 5-factor model. Dedicated institutional investors, as defined in Bushee (1998, 2001), are characterized as having large average investment in firms in their portfolios and extremely low turnover. In contrast, transient institutional investors are institutional investors characterized as having high portfolio turnover and highly diversified portfolio holdings.

Panels A and B show the buy-and-hold monthly returns and abnormal returns, respectively, for firms with more long-horizon institutional investors than the median firm and firms with more short-horizon institutional investors than the median firm. Panels C and D show the buy-and-hold monthly returns and abnormal returns, respectively, for frms with more focused institutional investors than the median firm and firms with more diversified institutional investors than the median firm. Abnormal returns are calculated relative to the Pastor and Stambaugh (2005) 5-factor model.
