Productivity Growth, Employment, and the Labor Share   \nDavid Autor and Anna Salomons   \nNBER Working Paper No. 24871   \nJuly 2018   \nJEL No. D33,J23,033,057  \n\n## ABSTRACT  \n\nMany technological innovations replace workers with machines, but this capital-labor substitution need not reduce aggregate labor demand because it simultaneously induces four countervailing responses: own-industry output effects; cross-industry input-output effects; between-industry shifts; and final demand effects. We quantify these channels using four decades of harmonized cross-country and industry data, where we measure automation as industry-level movements in total factor productivity (TFP) that are common across countries. We find that automation displaces employment and reduces labor's share of value-added in the industries in which it originates (a direct effect). In the case of employment, these own-industry losses are reversed by indirect gains in customer industries and induced increases in aggregate demand. By contrast, own-industry labor share losses are not recouped elsewhere. Our framework can account for a substantial fraction of the reallocation of employment across industries and the aggregate fall in the labor share over the last three decades. It does not, however, explain why the labor share fell more rapidly during the 2000s  \n\nDavid Autor   \nDepartment of Economics, E52-438   \nMIT   \n77 Massachusetts Avenue   \nCambridge, MA 02139   \nand NBER   \ndautor@ mit.edu   \nAnna Salomons   \nUtrecht School of Economics   \nUtrecht University   \nKriekenpitplein 21-22   \n3584 EC Utrecht   \nThe Netherlands   \na.m.salomons $@$ uu.nl  \n\n## Introduction  \n\nIt is a widely held view that recent and incipient breakthroughs in artificial inteligence and dexterous, adaptive robotics are profoundly shifting the terms of human vs. machine comparative advantage. In light of these advances, numerous scholars and popular writers anticipate the wholesale elimination of a vast set of currently labor-intensive and cognitively demanding tasks, leaving an ever-diminishing set of activities in which labor adds significant value (Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2014; Ford, 2015; Frey and Osborne, 2017). The displacement of labor from production could take (at least) two forms: employment displacement, meaning the elimination of aggregate employment; or labor-share displacement, meaning the erosion of labor's share of value-added in the economy.  \n\nWhether technological progress ultimately proves employment- or labor-share-displacing depends proximately on two factors: how technological innovations shape employment and labor's share of value-added directly in the industries where they occur; and how these direct effects are augmented or offset by employment and labor-share changes elsewhere in the economy that are indirectly spurred by these same technological forces. The first of these phenomena- the direct effect of technological progress on employment and labor-share in the specific settings in which it occurs - is often readily observable, and we suspect that observation of these direct labor-displacing effects shapes theoretical and empirical study of the aggregate impact of technological progress. The indirect effects of technological progress on these same outcomes, however, are likely more challenging to observe and quantify, and hence may receive short shrift in economic analysis and in the wider public debate.2  \n\nTo see the challenge this creates, consider the two panels of Figure 1, which reports bivariate scatters of the relationship between industry-level Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth over the 1970 - 2007 period and contemporaneous industry-level log employment growth (Figure 1A) and industry-level changes in log labor share (Figure 1B), defined as the log ratio of the wagebill to value-added.3 Both figures reveal a well-determined downward slope: industries experiencing faster measured TFP growth on average exhibit steep relative declines in employment and labor share over this period. It would be tempting to infer from these figures that technological advances (captured by TFP growth) erode aggregate employment and labor's share of national income.  \n\nBut theory makes clear that there is no direct mapping between the evolution of productivity and labor demand at the industry level and the evolution of labor demand in the aggregate (Foster et al., 2017). A long-standing literature, starting with Baumol (1967), has considered reallocation mechanisms for employment, showing that labor moves from technologically advancing to technologically lagging sectors if the outputs of these sectors are not close substitutes. Further, Ngai and Pissarides (2007) and Acemoglu and Guerrieri (2008) show that such ongoing unbalanced productivity growth across sectors can nevertheless yield a balanced growth path for labor and capital shares. Indeed, one of the central stylized facts of modern macroeconomics, immortalized by Kaldor (1961), is that during a century of unprecedented technological advancement in transportation, production, and communication, labor's share of national income remained roughly constant (Jones and Romer, 2010). This empirical regularity, which Keynes (1939) deemed \"a bit of a miracle,\" has provided economists - though not the lay public- with grounds for optimism that, despite seemingly limitless possibilities for labor-saving technological progress, automation need not displace labor as a factor of production.  \n\nTable 1 confirms the broad relevance of these theoretical observations. Aggregate employment grew dramatically in all countries in this time interval even as relative employment fell in the industries experiencing the fastest productivity growth. Yet, conversely, labor's share of value-added was steady or rising in the 1970s, declined modestly in the 1980s and 1990s, and then fellsteeply in the 2000s in many countries. These facts thus highlight the pitflls of  \n\nextrapolating from direct, first-order technological relationships (here, observed at the industry level) to labor market outcomes in the aggregate, because the latter incorporate both direct and indirect consequences of technological progress (as well as many non-technological factors).  \n\nThis paper applies harmonized cross-country and cross-industry data to explore the relationship between technological change and labor market outcomes over four decades. A first contribution of the paper is to attempt to overcome the tension, endemic to this area of work, of using microeconomic variation to afford identification while attempting to speak to macroeconomic outcomes. This tension arises here because we study the relationship between productivity growth, innovation, and labor displacement at the country-industry level. As Figure 1 underscores, naively extrapolating from industry-level to aggregate-level relationships is potentially fallacious. The alternative, directly estimating effects at the macro-level, often suffers from under-identification and low statistical power, and furthermore is silent on the microeconomic channels through which aggregate effects come about.  \n\nTo overcome these pitfalls, we empirically model three micro-macro linkages that, in combination with the industry-level estimates, allow us to make broader inferences about aggregate labor-displacement effects.4 The first link uses harmonized data from the World Input-Output Database (Timmer et al., 2015) enumerating cross-industry input-output linkages to trace the effects of productivity growth in each industry to outcomes occurring in customer industries and in supplier industries- that is, industries for which, respectively, the originating industry is upstream or downstream in the production chain.5 The second link connects aggregate economic growth and sectoral labor demands. Recognizing that productivity growth in each industry augments aggregate income and hence indirectly raises final demand, we estimate the elasticity of sectoral demand emanating from aggregate income growth and then apply our TFP estimates to infer the indirect contribution of each industry's productivity growth to final demand. Third, our analytic framework recognizes that uneven productivity  \n\ngrowth across industries yields shifts in industry shares of value-added, which in turn potentially alter labor's share of aggregate value-added.6  \n\nOur net estimates of the impact of productivity growth and innovation on aggregate outcomes of interest therefore sum over (1) direct industry-level effects; (2) indirect customer and supplier effects in linked sectors; (3) final demand effects accruing through the effect of productivity growth on aggregate value-added; and (4) composition effects accruing through productivity-induced changes in industry shares of value-added. We believe that this simple accounting framework can be usefully applied to other data sets and sources of variation.  \n\nDistinct from earlier work that focuses on specific measures of technological adoption or susceptibility (e.g., robotics, routine task replacement), a second contribution of the analysis is to employ total factor productivity growth (TFP), an omnibus measure of technological progress (Solow, 1956). Using TFP as our baseline measure potentially overcomes the challenge for consistent measurement posed by the vast heterogeneity of innovation across sectors and periods. TFP is also applicable to our analysis for a second reason: because all margins of technological progress ultimately induce a rise in TFP -either by increasing the efficiency of capital or labor in production or by reallocating tasks from labor to capital or vice versa — our empirical approach is not predicated on a specific mechanism through which technological progress affects outcomes of interest. But the flipside of this agnosticism is that merely observing a change in TFP in any industry or time period does not tell us which channel (augmentation, reallocation) is operative. Using information on output, employment, earnings, and labor's share of value added, however, we can infer these channels. Specifically, we study how changes in industry-level TFP affect output (value-added) quantities and prices, employment, earnings, and labor's share of value-added economy-wide, to draw inferences on both industry-level and aggregate labor-augmenting and labor-displacing effects of technological progress.  \n\nIt is well understood that estimates of TFP may also be confounded with business cycle effects, industry trends, and cross-industry differences in cyclical sensitivity (Basu and Fernald,  \n\n2001). We confront these issues directly. We purge the simultaneity between an industry's estimated TFP growth and changes in other industry-level measures that serve as inputs into the TFP calculation (e.g., output, wagebill, employment) by replacing own-country-industry TFP with the mean TFP of the corresponding industry observed in other countries in the same year.7 We purge the potential cyclicality of TFP by including a set of distributed lags as well as country-specific business-cycle indicators, which absorb business cycle variation in productivity measures. We address the opaqueness of TFP as a measure of technological progress by complementing it with an alternative, directly observable measure of industry-level technological advancement: patent awards by industry and country (Autor et al. 2017a). Patent awards — and even more so, patent citations-- prove to be strong predictors of industry-level TFP growth. Using patent awards in place of TFP growth, we obtain strongly comparable estimates of the relationships between technological progress, employment, wagebill, and value added, which we view as useful corroborative evidence.  \n\nTFP's virtue as an omnibus technology measure is also its shortcoming as a specific technology measure. Because TFP incorporates productivity growth arising from all sources, our analysis cannot directly answer the question of whether recent or specific technologies - such as industrial robotics or artificial intelligence — are more or less labor-complementing or labor-displacing than earlier generations of technology. By the same token, our analysis cannot distinguish between the impacts of automation- versus non-automation-based sources of TFP growth, which may in turn have distinct (or even countervailing) effects on employment or on labor's share of value added. We refer to readers to recent studies focusing on specific technological advances for this evidence (e.g., Graetz and Michaels, forthcoming; Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2017; Dauth et al., 2017; Chiacchio et al. 2018).  \n\nOur work builds on an active recent literature that questions the optimistic implications of the longstanding Kaldor facts by offering models where aggregate labor displacement is a potential consequence of advancing technology. Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018 and forthcoming) consider models in which two countervailing economic forces determine the  \n\nevolution of labor's share of income: the march of technological progress, which gradually replaces 'old' labor-using tasks, reducing labor's share of output and possibly diminishing real Wages; and endogenous technological progress that generates novel labor-demanding tasks, potentially reinstating labor's share. The interplay of these forces need not necessarily yield a balanced growth path: that is, labor's share may decline. Susskind (2017) develops a model in which labor is ultimately immiserated by the asymptotic encroachment of automation into the full spectrum of work tasks - contrary to Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018b), labor immiseration is guaranteed because falling labor scarcity does not spur the endogenous creation of new laborusing tasks or labor-complementing technologies.8  \n\nA central empirical regularity that underscores the relevance of this recent work is that labor's share of national income has indeed fallen in many nations in recent decades, a trend that may have become more pronounced in the 2000s (e.g., Elsby, Hobijn and Sahin, 2013; Karabarbounis and Neiman, 2013; Piketty 2014; Barkai, 2017; Autor et al. 2017b; Da0 et al. 2017; Gutiérrez and Philippon, 2017). Reviewing an array of within- and cross-country evidence, Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) argue that labor's falling share of value-added is caused by a steep drop in the quality-adjusted equipment prices of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) relative to labor. Though Karabarbounis and Neiman's work is controversial in that it implies an aggregate capital-labor substitution in excess of unity - which is a nonstandard assumption in this literature— their work has lent empirical weight to the hypothesis that computerization may erode labor demand. Related work by Eden and Gaggl (2018) calibrates an aggregate production function and similarly attributes part of the decline in the U.S. labor share to a rise in the share of income paid to ICT capital.  \n\nA growing micro-econometric literature presents a mixed set of findings on whether such erosion has occurred recently or in the past. Focusing on the first half of the twentieth century, Alexopoulos and Cohen (2016) find that positive technology shocks raised productivity and lowered unemployment in the United States between 1909 and 1949. Using contemporary European data, Gregory, Salomons, and Zierahn (2016) test whether Routine-Replacing Technical Change has reduced employment overall across Europe and find that though this type of change has reduced middle-skill employment, this reduction has been more than offset by compensatory product demand and local demand spillovers. In work closely related to ours, Dao et al. (2017) analyze sources of the trend decline in labor share in a panel of 49 emerging and industrialized countries. Using cross-country and cross-sector variation in the prevalence of occupations potentially susceptible to automation (as per Autor and Dorn, 2013), Dao et al. find that countries and sectors initially more specialized in routine-intensive activities have seen a larger decline in labor share, consistent with the possibility of labor displacement.9  \n\nConcentrating on industrial robotics, arguably the leading edge of workplace automation, Graetz and Michaels (forthcoming) conclude that industry-level adoption of industrial robots has raised labor productivity, increased value-added, augmented workers' wages, had no measurable effect on overall labor hours, and modestly shifted employment in favor of highskill workers within EU countries. Conversely, using the same underlying industry-level robotics data but applying a cross-city design within the U.S., Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017) present evidence that U.S. local labor markets that were relatively exposed to industrial robotics experienced differential falls in employment and wage levels between 1990 and 2007.10  \n\nOur analysis proceeds as follows. Section 1 summarizes the data and measurement framework and presents the simple shift-share decomposition that undergirds our accounting framework. Section 2 presents our estimates for the direct effects of productivity growth  \n\n(measured initially by TFP, in section 2.1; and by patents in section 2.2) on labor input, valueadded, and labor's share of value-added, across a range of model specifications. Section 3 then presents our main results accounting for both direct (Cown-industry') effects, and for indirect efects operating through input-output linkages and final demand. Section 4 quantifies the aggregate implications of these direct and indirect effect estimates for employment, hours worked, and labor's share of value added to assess whether technological progress has in net ben either augmenting or displacing of aggregate employment or of the labor share. We also consider in this section whether our accounting approach can explain cross-industry patterns of employment change and aggregate, time-series changes in the evolution of labor-share between and within industries.  \n\nTo briefly summarize our results, automation (as embodied in TFP growth) has been employment-augmenting yet labor-share-displacing over the last four decades. As implied by the scatter plot in Figure 1A, industries with persistent gains in relative productivity secularly contract as a share of aggregate employment, meaning that the direct effect of rising productivity has been to reduce labor input in the sectors where it originates. But this direct effect is more than fully offset by two indirect effects: first, rising TFP within supplier industries catalyzes strong, offsetting employment gains among their downstream customer industries; and second, TFP growth in each sector contributes to aggregate growth in real value-added and hence rising final demand, which in turn spurs further employment growth across all sectors.  \n\nConversely, we find that productivity growth is directly labor-share displacing in the industries where it originates, and moreover, this direct effect is not offset by indirect effects spurred by input-output linkages, compositional shifts, or final demand increases. Thus, we conclude that productivity growth has contributed to an erosion of labor's share of valueadded. Notably, this labor-share eroding effect was not present in the first decade of our sample, the 1970s, but then became strongly evident thereafter. Our analysis therefore broadly supports the hypothesis that the decline in the labor share since the 1980s is consistent with a shift towards more labor-displacing technology commencing in the 1980s. But the acceleration in the labor share decline observed during the 2000s is left unaccounted for by this mechanism.  \n\nIn the Conclusion, we briefly consider the interpretation of our findings, focusing in particular on the relationship between the industry-level and aggregate outcomes observed in our data, and the underlying unobserved firm-level dynamics that may contribute to these outcomes.  \n\n### 1. Data and measurement  \n\nOur analysis draws on EU KLEMS, an industry level panel dataset covering OECD countries since 1970 (see O'Mahony and Timmer, 2009, http://www.euklems.net/). We use the 2008 release of EU KLEMS, supplemented with data from the 2007 and 2011 releases to maximize data coverage. Our primary analytic sample covers the period of 1970 - 2007. We limit our analysis to 19 countries: the developed countries of the European Union, i.e. excluding Eastern Europe; and Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea, and the United States. These countries and their years of data coverage are listed in Appendix Table A1. The EU KLEMS database contains detailed data for 32 industries in both the market and non-market economies, summarized in Appendix Table A2. We focus on non-farm employment, and we omit the poorly measured Private household sector, and Public administration and defense, and Extraterritorial organizations, which are almost entirely non-market sectors.11 The end year of our analysis is dictated by major revisions to the industry definitions in EU KLEMS that were implemented from the 2013 release onwards. These definitional changes inhibit us from extending our consistent 1970 - 2007 analysis through to the present, though we analyze 2000 - 2015 separately using the 2017 release of EU KLEMS for a smaller subset of countries for which these data are available.12  \n\nTable 1 summarizes trends in aggregate hours of labor input and labor's share of valueadded by decade for the 19 countries in our analysis. As with all analyses in the paper, these statistics are calculated using the 28 market industries that comprise our analytic sample and are annualized to account for the fact that years of data coverage differ by country. With very few exceptions, aggregate labor hours rise in all countries and time periods. The growth rate of labor hours is most rapid in the 1980s, slower in the 1990s, and slower still in the 2000s. Distinct from aggregate labor hours, trends in labor's share of value-added differ by country and time period. On average, the aggregate labor share rises in the 1970s and then falls during the subsequent three decades, with by far the sharpest annual rate of decline in the 2000s.  \n\nTable 2 reports analogous statistics for trends in hours of labor input and labor's share of value-added among the 28 industries in our sample. There is a substantial diversity of experiences among industries. Employment fell steeply in mining and quarrying, textiles and related products, and refining, while growing rapidly in many business and personal services. Labor's share of value-added declined in the majority of sectors, with the steepest fall in heavy industry. TFP growth, meanwhile, was most rapid in manufacturing and was negative in several service industries.  \n\nTable 3 summarizes trends in employment, hours, wages, value-added, labor share, and TFP by industry over the four decades of our sample. We quantify these trends overall, by broad sector, and by decade by estimating regression models for the change in countryindustry-year outcomes (multiplied by 100). In this table, and throughout the paper, regression models are weighted by time-averaged shares of the relevant weighting variable—employment, hours, or value-added - within countries multiplied by time-varying country shares of the weighting variable. As such, we weight by country size in our main estimates, and show in the appendix that our main results are not sensitive to this choice.  \n\nPanel A of Table 3 reports estimates for all industries and time periods. Panel B reports these relationships separately by decade, and panel C reports them separately for five broad sectors encompassing the 28 industries in our analysis. As detailed in the rubric in Appendix Table A2, these sectors are: mining, utilities, and construction; manufacturing; education and health; low-tech services (including personal services, retail, wholesale and real estate); and high-tech services (including post and telecommunications, finance, and other business services). The reported regression coefficients, which correspond to within-industry changes, reflect a number of key trends in the data. Employment growth, measured in workers or hours, is positive in all decades but slows substantially across consecutive decades. Employment growth is negative in manufacturing; modestly positive in mining, utilities, and construction; and strongly positive in services, with the most rapid growth evident in high-tech services, followed by education and health, and finally low-tech services. Like employment, growth of real hourly wages is positive in all periods but secularly slowing.  \n\nConsistent with results reported in much recent work (e.g. Elsby, Hobijn, and Sahin 2013; Karabarbounis and Neiman 2014; Autor et al. 2017b), trends in the labor share of value added vary across decades. Labor's share of value-added trends modestly upward in the 1970s, then falls in each decade of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. This trend is most pronounced in manufacturing and in mining, utilities, and construction. It is modest in high-tech services, and in the education and health sector, and it is absent in the low-tech services sector.  \n\nThe descriptive statistics given in Table 3 focus on within-industry changes in the labor share and its components. But of course, changes in the aggregate labor share may stem from both (1) within-industry shifts in labor's share of value-added; and (2) changes in the share of value-added accounted for by industries that differ in their labor shares. Our analysis will assess the contribution of technological change to both margins. To quantify the importance of within- versus between-industry shifts, we implement a simple shift-share decomposition as follows. Let $\\begin{array}{r}{\\overline{{L}}_{c t}=\\sum_{i}\\omega_{i c t}l_{i c t}}\\end{array}$ equal the aggregate log labor share in country $c$ in year $t_{,}$ defined as the weighted sum of log labor shares $l_{i c t}$ in each industry $i,$ where weights $\\omega_{i c t}$ correspond to industry $i^{\\prime}s$ share in value-added in its respective country and year.13 Let $\\Delta\\bar{L}_{c\\tau}$ equal the change in aggregate log labor share in country $c$ over time interval $\\tau_{\\cdot}$ equal to 1970-80, 1980-90, 1990-00, or 2000-07, where $\\Delta$ is the first difference operator. Finally, let $\\bar{l}_{i c\\tau}=\\big(l_{i c,t1}-l_{i c,t0}\\big)/2$ and $\\overline{{\\omega}}_{i c\\tau}=$ $\\big(\\omega_{i c,t1}-\\omega_{i c,t0}\\big)/2$ We can then decompose the observed labor share change in each decade as:  \n\n$$\n\\Delta\\overline{{L}}_{c\\tau}=\\sum_{i}\\overline{{\\omega}}_{i c\\tau}\\Delta l_{i c\\tau}+\\sum_{i}\\overline{{l}}_{i c\\tau}\\Delta\\omega_{i c\\tau},\n$$  \n\nwhere the first term to the right of equal sign is the contribution of within-industry changes in labor share to the aggregate change and the second term is the contribution to the aggregate change due to shifts in value-added shares across industries.  \n\nThe results of this decomposition, reported in Table 4, indicate that the majority, but not the entirety, of the change in aggregate labor share in each decade is accounted for by withinindustry shifts, consistent with evidence for the U.S. (Eden and Gaggl 2018). Focusing first on the country size-weighted calculations, we find that more than all of the rise in labor share in the 1970s is due to within-industry changes, whereas between 51 percent and 72 percent of the fall in the labor share in the subsequent three decades is accounted for by within-industry declines. If we instead weight each country equally in the shift-share decomposition (shown in the right-hand panel of Table 4), we reach similar conclusions about the importance of withinindustry labor share movements. Further, if we decompose the change in the mean level of labor share rather than the mean log level (Appendix Table A3), we find a similar time pattern as for the log labor share and a similarly outsized role played by within-industry changes.  \n\nThese decomposition results suggest that the within-industry determinants of changes in the aggregate labor share are of greater analytic interest compared with the between-industry drivers, though we explore both margins below. The 2000s stand out, however, for having a roughly even distribution of aggregate labor share changes into within- and between-industry components. Consistent with the observations of Rognlie (2015) and Gutiérrez (2017), this pattern reflects the outsized growth of the Real Estate industry's value added in numerous countries — particularly during the 2000s — and this industry has an extremely low share of labor in value-added (see Appendix Table A4). If we eliminate Real Estate from the analysis, however, we find that the fall in the aggregate labor share in the 2000s is reduced by less than one quarter (from $-0.86$ to $-0.64$ per year); the within-industry component of the labor share decline explains no less than 90 percent of the total in each decade; and the annual rate of decline in the labor-share during the 2000s is still more than twice as rapid as in the 1990s.14 Thus, the rising share of real-estate in value-added is not the primary driver of the falling labor share.  \n\nFigure 2 adds country-level detail to these calculations by plotting the evolution of the aggregate labor share of value added for all countries in our sample. Each panel contains two series: in the first series industry shares are permitted to vary by year; and the second series holds these shares constant at their within-country, over-time averages. The fact that these series closely correspond for almost all countries reinforces the inferences from the decomposition that most of the aggregate changes in the labor share observed in the data stem from within-industry movements in this share.  \n\n### 2. Main estimates  \n\nBefore making estimates, we tackle two remaining issues: simultaneity and timing. The simultaneity issue arises because labor's share of value-added features in the construction of TFP, inducing a mechanical correlation between TFP growth and shifts in the labor share.15 To overcome this pitfall, we construct industry-level TFP growth for each industry-country pair as the leave-out mean of industry-level TFP growth in all other countries in the sample. This approach eliminates the mechanical correlation between TFP and labor share and arguably exploits movements in the technology frontier that are common among industrialized economies. Confirming the utility of this strategy, we show in Appendix Table A5 that othercountry-same-industry TFP is a strong predictor of own-country-industry TFP: in a set of regressions of own-country-industry TFP on other-country-industry TFP that includes a large number of country, year, sector, and business cycle main effects, we obtain a prediction coefficient that ranges from 0.32 to 0.57, with a t-value above five in all specifications. Based on this reasoning and evidence, we employ the leave-out TFP measure in place of own-industry TFP in all the analyses given below.  \n\nThe second isue — timing — arises because contemporaneous productivity innovations are unlikely to induce their steady state effects immediately, meaning that a lag structure is needed for estimating the relationship between TFP and outcomes of interest (Ramey 2016). To explore a suitable structure, we estimate simple local projection models in the spirit of Jorda (2005), which involve regressing a series of first-differences of increasing length of the outcome  \n\nvariable of interest on the explanatory variable of interest (here, TFP growth) and a set of controls.We estimate  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\ln Y_{i c,t+K}-\\ln Y_{i c,t-1}}\\ &{\\qquad=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}\\Delta\\ln T F P_{i,c\\neq c(i),t-1}+\\displaystyle\\sum_{k=0}^{K}\\beta_{2}^{k}\\Delta\\ln T F P_{i,c\\neq c(i),k}}\\ &{\\qquad+\\beta_{3}\\Delta\\ln T F P_{i,c\\neq c(i),t-2}+\\beta_{4}\\Delta\\ln Y_{i c,t-2}+\\alpha_{c t}+\\gamma_{s}+\\varepsilon_{i c t},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere In $Y_{i c,t+K}$ denotes the log outcome of interest in industry $i,$ country $c$ , and year $t,$ and $K$ denotes the time horizon for the local projection. The dependent variables therefore reflect the log change in outcome Y from base year $t-1$ up to year $t+K$ . The impulse variable is the log change in other-country-industry TFP between years $t-2$ and $t-1,\\Delta\\ln T F P_{i,c\\neq c(i),t-1}$ These effects are estimated while controlling for lagged values of both TFP growth $(\\Delta\\ln T F P_{i,c\\neq c(i),t-2})$ and of outcome variable growth. $(\\Delta\\ln Y_{i c,t-2})$ - that is, conditional on the lagged history of both TFP and outcome growth at the path start time. This allows for feedback dynamics within the system and controls for them through the inclusion of the lagged variables. Each model further controls for a set of country--year fixed effects $(\\alpha_{c t}).$ as well as fixed effects for five broad sectors $(\\gamma_{s},$ as outlined in Appendix Table A2). Following the approach of Teulings and Zubanov (2014), we also control for subsequent TFP innovations occurring between $t=0$ and $t=K$ which reduce the influence of serial correlation in TFP innovations on estimates of $\\beta_{1}$ . Finally, standard errors are clustered by country-industry.  \n\nFigure 3 reports local projection estimates and confidence intervals for the relationship between a TFP innovation shock, measured as an increase in TFP of 1 standard deviation, occurring between periods $t=-1$ and $t=0$ and ensuing industry-level changes $\\Delta_{k}$ In $Y_{i c}\\equiv$ In $Y_{i c,t+k}-\\ln{Y_{i c,t-1}}$ for $K\\in\\{0,\\ldots,5\\}$ .16 For all the outcome variables considered (employment, hours, wagebill, value-added, and labor share), the local projection estimates indicate that TFP growth predicts small or negligible contemporaneous changes in the outcome of interest that cumulate in ensuing years. In all cases, however, these effects plateau after three years, implying that no more than four lags of the independent variable are needed to capture the impulse response of a contemporaneous shock. For completeness, we include five lags in our main specifications, though we shorten the lag structure when analyzing sub-intervals of the data.  \n\n2.1. Within-industry direct effects: Own-industry TFP and own-industry outcomes Our initial estimates, reported in Table 5, consider the within-industry 'direct' effects of TFF growth on own-industry outcomes. We fit OLS first-difference models of the form  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\Delta\\ln Y_{i c t}=\\beta_{0}+\\displaystyle\\sum_{k=0}^{5}{\\beta_{1}^{k}\\Delta\\ln{T F P_{i,c\\neq c(i),t-k}}}+\\alpha_{c}+\\delta_{t}+\\alpha_{c}\\times t+\\alpha_{c}\\times(t=p e a k)}\\ &{\\phantom{\\sum_{k=0}^{5}\\alpha_{k}\\ln{T F}}+\\alpha_{c}\\times(t=t r o u g h)+\\varepsilon_{i c t},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\Delta\\ln Y_{i c t}$ is an outcome of interest and as above, $i$ indexes industries, $c$ indexes countries, and $t$ indexes years; and the log change in TFP (contemporaneous plus five distributed lags) is the explanatory variable of interest. Because equation (3) is a first-difference specification estimated at the industry-country-time level, it implicitly eliminates industry-country effects. We additionally include country and year indicator variables, which correspond to linear country and time trends in the first-difference model; country-time interaction terms, which allow country trends to accelerate or decelerate over the sample interval; and country-specific cyclical peak and trough indicators interacted with country indicators to account for countryspecific business cycle effects. All models are weighted by industries^ time-averaged shares of the relevant weighting variable — employment, hours, or value-added— within countries multiplied by time-varying country shares of the weighting variable, and standard errors are clustered at the level of country-industry pairs.  \n\nThe first panel of Table 5 presents estimates for industry-level employment, measured as the (log) number of workers (encompassing both employees and the self-employed). We estimate that industries experiencing relative gains in productivity exhibit relative declines in employment. The point estimate of $-2.07$ in column 1, corresponding to the sum of the six $\\beta_{1}^{k}$ coefficients, implies that an increase of 1 standard deviation in own-industry TFP $(2.58\\mathrm{~log}$ points) predicts a fall in own-industry employment of approximately 2 log points. This estimate implies that the estimated elasticity of employment to TFP growth is below unity ( $\\mathrm{0.80=}$ 2.07/2.58)-- that is, there is a partial industry-level demand offset (cf. Bessen 2017).  \n\nColumns 2 and 3 stress-test this estimate by adding five major sector-group fixed effects an( by replacing the country-trend and country-specific business-cycle controls with an exhaustive set of country-year indicator variables. The inclusion of sector-group trends reduces the point estimate from $-2.07$ to -1.13 and increases precision. This pattern suggests that TFP innovations may spill-over across industries within a sector. We subsequently model these spillovers in the next section, when we add input-output linkages to the regression model; meanwhile, we add sector-group dummies (reflecting sector-group trends in the log level models) to all subsequent models, so our primary identification comes from within-sector, between-industry comparisons. Conditional on the inclusion of these sector-group trends, the addition of a full set of country-year dummies in column 3 has almost no impact on the magnitude or precision of the point estimates. This insensitivity is worth bearing in mind because we do not include exhaustive country-year dummies in our main models; these dummies would interfere with the identification of input-output linkages, which have much lower country-year variability than own-industry TFP.  \n\nPanel B of Table 5, which reports analogous estimates for log hours of labor input, finds an almost identical slope as for employment, indicating that most of the employment adjustment to productivity changes occurs on the extensive margin. Panel C explores the relationship between TFP and nominal industry wagebill changes. These point estimates are also similar to those for hours and employment, suggesting that industry (relative) nominal wages are not much affected by TFP changes; rather, the industry-level relationship between TFP and wagebill changes stems from employment shifts.  \n\nWe turn to output measures in Panels D and E of Table 5. Rising industry TFP predicts significant relative declines in industry-level nominal value-added (Panel D) and significant relative rises in real industry value-added (Panel E), implying (logically) that rising industry productivity lowers industry prices.  \n\nComparing the estimates in Panels D and E reveals that a rise in industry TFP predicts a smaller (less negative) change in nominal value-added than in the wagebill. This suggests that rising TFP predicts a (relative) fall in labor's share of industry value-added.17 Panel F of the table confirms this implication: a rise in TFP of 1 standard deviation predicts a fall in an industry's labor share of value-added of approximately 0.55 percentage points over a five-year horizon.  \n\nWe have implemented a large number of tests of the robustness of these estimates, which are reported in Table 6. These include: weighting all countries equally rather than by their value-added shares (panel A); eliminating the contemporaneous TFP term from the distributed lag model (panel B); eliminating the self-employed from our employment, wagebill, and laborshare models (panel C); imputing zeros to the TFP measures in cases where the reported values are negative (panel D)8; estimating eqn. (3) using five-year long first-differences in place of annual first-differences (panel E)19; and using data from the 2000 - 2015 period from the 2017 release of the EU KLEMS data (Van Ark and Jager, 2017), thus adding eight additional outcome years at the cost of dropping prior decades and several countries (panel F).20 Results are remarkably stable across these many sets of estimates, though precision is much lower for models fit using the short 2000-2015 panel.  \n\nThe robust negative industry-level relationships between TFP and both employment and labor's share of value-added seen in Tables 5 and 6 are central inputs into our subsequent analysis. We stress that these findings do not by themselves imply that productivity growth depresses either employment or the labor share in the aggregate. Indeed, these direct withinindustry relationships do not at present incorporate any of the potentially countervailing effects operating through other channels, including input-output linkages, compositional shifts, and final demand effects. Before incorporating these links in the next section, we perform a validity test on our main technology measure.  \n\n#### 2.2. Applying direct measures of technological progress  \n\nOur omnibus measure of productivity-augmenting technological change, TFP, has the advantage that it is not bound to a specific set of technologies or their associated measurement challenges. But TFP's strength is also its weakness. Because it is an accounting residual, one can only speculate on the underlying sources of technological progress that contribute to rising TFP. To partially address this concern, we test whether our key results above hold when we focus on a specific margin of technological advancement: industry-level patenting flows (as in Acemoglu, Akcigit, and Kerr 2017).  \n\nUsing data from Autor et al. (2017a), who match patent grants to their respective corporate oWners and then to industry codes based on corporate owners' industry affiliations, we construct counts of patent grants and patent citations by year for patents granted to both US and non-US inventors using U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) data by U.S. Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) industry, cross-walked to the EUKLEMS industry level. Aggregate summary statistics for standardized patent counts and patent citations are reported in the lower panel of Table A6, while Appendix Table A7 reports the mean log number of patent grants and patent citations by industry and by inventor nationality (U.S. versus nonU.S.), and Appendix Table A8 summarizes industry-level trends by decade and sector. These tables highlight the substantial heterogeneity in patent flows across industries and over time, with the highest levels of patenting ocurring in Chemicals and Electrical equipment, and the lowest occurring in Education. Patent grants rise across decades while citations fall in the most recent decade, reflecting the substantial lag between patent grants and patent citations. Although citations are likely a better measure of innovation than the raw count of patent grants (Trajtenberg 1990), citations may understate innovation in the final years of the sample because they arrive with a lag. In what follows, we report results using both measures of patenting activity.  \n\nGiven that patenting activity is an input into the industry-level innovation and automation process, it should predict TFP growth. To verify this supposition, we estimate industry-level descriptive regressions of the form:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle\\Delta\\ln{T F P_{i c t}}=\\displaystyle\\beta_{0}+\\sum_{k=0}^{3}{\\beta_{1}^{k}\\ln{P A T_{i,c\\neq c(i),t-k}}+\\alpha_{c}}+\\delta_{t}+\\alpha_{c}\\times(t=p e a k)}\\ {+\\alpha_{c}\\times(t=t r o u g h)+\\varepsilon_{i c t},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\Delta\\ln T F P_{i c t}$ is the measured change in industry-level TFP, and In $P A T_{i,c\\neq c(i),t}$ is log count of industry-level patents, which are normalized to have a standard deviation of 1. Paralleling the specifications given above, we include both contemporaneous patenting activity and a set of annual distributed lags. Analogous to our strategy of using other-country (leave out) TFP growth by industry, we use patenting activity by non-U.S. inventors as predictors of U.S. TFP growth and, similarly, use patenting activity by U.S. inventors as predictors of non-U.s. TFP growth.  \n\nThe estimates of eqn. (4), reported for patent counts in the upper panel of Table 7 and for patent citations in the lower panel, confirm that patent flows are a strong predictor of industry TFP growth. A one-standard deviation higher rate of industry patents or patent citations predicts approximately 0.6 log points faster industry TFP growth $\\boldsymbol{\\mathit{t}}=2.9\\$ 0. This relationship is robust: adding year effects (column 2), country-specific business-cycle effects (column 3), and country- year effects (column 4) to these first-difference models has almost no impact on the magnitude or precision of the predictive relationship.  \n\nTable 8 explores the relationship between patenting activity and the evolution of industrylevel labor input, value-added, and factor payments. Following the template of the tables presented above, we report regressions of industry-level first-differences in outcome variables on log industry patent counts or patent citations - contemporaneous and five annual distributed lags- and the full set of controls used in Table 7.21 Comparable to the pattern of results for TFP, we find that industry-level patent citation flows predict a fall in own-industry employment and hours, a decline in nominal value-added, a rise in real value-added, and, most importantly, a fall in own-industry labor share.22 These findings hold for both measures of patenting activity - patent counts and patent citations. Though precision is far lower for the patent- than TFP-based estimates - likely because we effectively have patenting data for only two countries, U.S. and 'non-U.S.' - we view these findings as supportive of our main results.  \n\n### 3. Linking micro to macro  \n\nAs underscored by Figure 1A, it would be erroneous to conclude that because relative employment declines in industries experiencing rising productivity, aggregate employment falls as productivity rises. To move from this cautionary observation to a rigorous quantification of how industry-level productivity growth affects employment and labor share in the aggregate, We next add three micro-macro linkages to our estimation and accounting framework: customer-supplier linkages; final demand effects; and composition effects.  \n\n#### 3.1. Accounting for customer-supplier linkages  \n\nThe effect of productivity growth occurring in an industry is unlikely to be confined to the sector in which it originates. Industries facing lower input prices or higher quality inputs from their suppliers may increase purchases; similarly, industries whose customers are experiencing rising productivity may face rising or falling output demands. We account for these inputoutput linkages by adding two terms to eqn. (3):  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\ln Y_{i c t}=\\beta_{0}+\\underset{k=0}{\\overset{5}{\\sum}}\\beta_{1}^{k}\\Delta\\ln T F P_{i,c\\neq c(i),t-k}+\\underset{k=0}{\\overset{5}{\\sum}}\\beta_{2}^{k}\\Delta\\ln\\widetilde{T F P}_{j\\neq i,c,t-k}^{S U P}+\\underset{k=0}{\\overset{5}{\\sum}}\\beta_{3}^{k}\\Delta\\ln\\widetilde{T F P}_{j\\neq i,c,t}^{C U S T}}\\ {+\\alpha_{c}+\\delta_{t}+\\gamma_{s}+\\alpha_{c}\\times t+\\alpha_{c}\\times(t=p e a k)+\\alpha_{c}\\times(t=t r o u g h)+\\varepsilon_{i c t}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThese additional terms, $\\widetilde{T F P}_{j\\neq i,c,t}^{S U P}$ Pj≠i,c,t and TFP $\\widetilde{T F P}_{j\\neq i,c,t}^{C U S T},$ measure the weighted sum of TFP growth in all other domestic industries $j\\neq i,$ which are, respectively, the suppliers and customers of industry i:23  \n\n$$\n\\Delta\\ln\\widetilde{T F P}_{j\\neq i,c,t}^{L}=\\sum_{j=1}^{J}w e i g h t_{j\\neq i,c}^{L}\\times\\Delta\\ln T F P_{j\\neq i,c,t}^{L}\\mathrm{,~}\\forall\\mathrm{~}L\\in S U P,C U S T,\n$$  \n\nThe supplier and customer weights used for this calculation are obtained from input-output coefficients from the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) and are averaged over 1995-2007. The supplier weights are equal to each domestic supplier industry $j^{\\prime}s$ value-added as a share of the value-added of industry $i,$ capturing the importance of supplier industries $j$ in the production of industry i's output. Analogously, the customer weights are the shares of valueadded of each industry $i$ that are used in domestic industry $j^{\\prime}s$ final products, capturing the importance of industries $j$ as end-consumers of industry i's output. 24 These weights account not only for shocks to an industry's immediate domestic suppliers or buyers but also for the full set of input-output relationships among all connected domestic industries (i.e., the Leontief inverse). We renormalize both the customer and supplier TFP terms to have a standard deviation of 1, with summary statistics reported in Appendix Table A6. As with our main (direct) measure of TFP, these supplier and customer TFP linkage terms are calculated using industry-level leave-out means of TFP growth in all other countries in the sample.  \n\nThe estimates of equation (5), reported in the upper panel of Table 9, indicate that productivity growth emanating from supplier industries predicts steep increases in the employment and hours of labor input of customer industries (though not in their nominal Wagebill, value-added, or labor share). Specifically, the point estimate of 0.97 on the supplierindustry TFP term in column 1 indicates that a one standard deviation rise in an industry's supplier productivity predicts an employment gain of 97 log points. This effect is almost identical in magnitude but opposite in sign to the estimated direct effect of TFP growth of -0.95 on own-industry employment. Thus, this input-output linkage reveals a first channel by which direct effects of productivity growth on own-industry outcomes may be offset by effects accruing outside the originating sector.  \n\nConversely, productivity growth emanating from customer industries (row 3 of the upper panel of Table 9) generally has negligible and always insignificant estimated effects on employment, hours, wagebill, value-added, and labor share in supplier industries. This result is consistent with the simple Cobb-Douglas input-output framework developed in Acemoglu, Akcigit, and Kerr (2016), where productivity innovations in a given industry lead to output gain in its customer industries — those benefiting from its price declines- but have no net effect on its supplier sectors, where price and quantity effects are offsetting.  \n\nA third important pattern revealed by Table 9 is that our earlier estimates of the relationship between TFP growth and own-industry outcomes are essentially unaffected by the inclusion of the customer and supplier terms (compare the point estimates in Tables 5 and 9). Thus, our initial findings for the relationship between TFP growth and own-industry employment and labor share are unaltered.  \n\n#### 3.2. Accounting for final demand effects  \n\nThe lower panel of Table 9 adds a third channel of response: final demand effects accruing through the contribution of productivity growth to aggregate value-added. To capture these final demand effects, we estimate the relationship between country-specific aggregate economic growth (contemporaneous and five distributed lags) and industry-specific inputs using the following specification:  \n\n$$\n\\Delta\\ln Y_{i c t}=\\lambda_{0}+\\sum_{k=0}^{5}\\lambda_{1}^{k}\\Delta\\ln V A_{j\\neq i,c,t-k}+\\alpha_{s}+\\varepsilon_{i c t},\n$$  \n\nThe explanatory variable of interest in this equation, $\\Delta\\ln V A_{j\\neq i,c,t},$ is the growth of own-country real or nominal value-added, where the subscript $j\\neq i$ highlights that we exclude own-industry output from the explanatory measure for each industry to eliminate any mechanical correlation between aggregate growth and industry outcomes. These stacked first-difference regression models drop the country, year, trend, and business-cycle indicators used in equation (5), so that identification largely arises from country and year time-series. Since these are first-difference models, however, they implicitly eliminate industry-country effects.  \n\nThe estimates of equation (7), reported in the lower panel of Table 9, document a second countervailing effect of industry-specific productivity innovations on aggregate outcomes: each log point gain in country-level real value-added predicts an approximately 0.6 log point rise in same-country, other-industry employment and hours. Similarly, each log point gain in countrylevel nominal value-added predicts essentially a one-for-one rise in same-country, otherindustry wagebill and nominal value-added, as well as a very modest but statistically significant rise in same-country, other-industry labor-share (the estimated elasticity is 0.071). Because TFP growth emanating from any one sector raises the real aggregate value-added in the country where it occurs, these estimates imply that each industry's productivity growth contributes to aggregate labor demand across all other sectors.25  \n\n3.3. Accounting for compositional (between-sector) effects  \n\nThe estimates given in Table 9 reveal one further mechanism by which sectoral productivity gains affect the aggregate labor share: by shifting relative sector sizes. Column 4 of panel A finds that a rise in own-industry TFP growth predicts a fall in industry-level nominal valueadded with an elasticity of -0.58. This finding implies that sectors with rising productivity will tend to shrink as a share of nominal value-added. Figure 4 confirms this intuition by depicting a scatter plot of the bivariate relationship between industry-level TFP growth and the change in industries' log shares of own-country nominal value-added (averaged over years and across countries). On average, industries that experience one log point faster TFP growth than the economy-wide average lose about 0.6 log point as a share of nominal economy-wide valueadded.  \n\nApplying this observation to the Oaxaca decomposition equation above (eqn. 1), it is immediately clear that uneven productivity growth across industries will shift the aggregate labor share through changes in relative sector sizes. If rapid productivity growth occurs in industries with relatively low labor shares (e.g., manufacturing industries), this willindirectly raise the aggregate labor share; conversely, relatively rapid productivity growth in laborintensive sectors (e.g., education and health) will have the opposite effect.26  \n\n### 4. Quantitative implications  \n\nWith these estimates in hand, we now quantify the implied contribution of TFP growth to employment and labor share evolutions in the aggregate accruing through the four channels outlined above: own-industry, supplier and customer, final demand, and composition. We start with employment and hours, then turn to the labor share.  \n\n4.1. Aggregate employment and hours effects  \n\nThe effect of TFP growth on employment and hours combines the first three of these effects: the own-industry (or ^direct') effect, the supplier and customer effects, and the final demand effect. The first (own-industry) effect is equal to the sum of the $\\beta_{1}^{k}$ coefficients in eqn. (5) multiplied by their corresponding $\\Delta\\ln T F P_{i,c\\neq c(i),t}$ terms, and aggregated by weighting these industry-level predictions by the time-averaged share of each industry in total employment or hours:  \n\n$$\n\\Delta\\ln Y_{c t}^{O W N}\\equiv{\\frac{\\partial\\ln Y_{c t}}{\\partial\\ln T F P_{i,c\\neq c(i),t}}}=\\sum_{k=0}^{5}\\beta_{1}^{k}\\sum_{i=1}^{I}\\omega_{i c}\\times\\Delta\\ln T F P_{i,c\\neq c(i),t}\n$$  \n\nHere, $\\ln Y_{c t}$ is log employment or hours in county $c$ in year $t;\\textstyle\\sum_{k=0}^{5}\\beta_{1}^{k}$ is the sum of coefficients in eqn. (5); $\\omega_{i c}$ is the time-averaged employment or hours share of industry $i$ in its respective country; and $\\Delta\\ln T F P_{i,c\\neq c(i),t}$ is own-industry TFP growth.  \n\nThe supplier and customer effects are, analogously, equal to the sum of the $\\beta_{2}^{k}$ and $\\beta_{3}^{k}$ coeficientsmultipedbyther correpning $\\widetilde{T F P}_{j\\neq i,c,t}^{S U P}$ and $\\widetilde{T F P}_{j\\neq i,c,t}^{C U S T}$ Pjti,c,t terms, and then aggregated to the national level by weighting each by its time-averaged industry employment or hours shares $(\\omega_{i c})$  \n\n$$\n\\Delta\\ln Y_{c t}^{S U P}\\equiv\\frac{\\partial\\ln Y_{c t}}{\\partial\\ln\\widetilde{T F P}_{j\\neq i,c,t}^{S U P}}=\\sum_{k=0}^{5}\\beta_{2}^{k}\\sum_{i=1}^{I}\\omega_{i c}\\times\\Delta\\ln\\widetilde{T F P}_{j\\neq i,c,t}^{S U P}\\mathrm{and}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\Delta\\ln Y_{c t}^{C U S T}\\equiv\\frac{\\partial\\ln Y_{c t}}{\\partial\\ln\\widetilde{T F P}_{j\\neq i,c,t}^{C U S T}}=\\sum_{k=0}^{5}\\beta_{3}^{k}\\sum_{i=1}^{I}\\omega_{i c}\\times\\Delta\\ln\\widetilde{T F P}_{j\\neq i,c,t}^{C U S T}.\n$$  \n\nThe third component that we calculate is the final demand effect of TFP growth in each industry on employment or hours economy-wide, $\\Delta Y_{c t}^{F D}$ . For any one industry, this contribution is equal to the product of four terms: (1) the effect of TFP growth in $i$ on $i^{\\prime}s$ real value-added $(\\textstyle\\sum_{k=0}^{5}\\beta_{1,V A}^{k})$ (2) the effect of growth in $i^{\\prime}s$ real value-added on total value-added $(\\phi_{i c}),$ (3) the effect of growth in real-value added on employment or hours in each industry $j\\neq i(\\textstyle\\sum_{k=0}^{5}\\lambda_{1}^{k})$ and (4) the size of industry $j$ relative to overall employment or hours in the economy $\\left(\\omega_{i c}\\right)$ .27 To obtain the aggregate effect (summing across industries), we calculate:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\Delta\\ln Y_{c t}^{F D}\\equiv{\\displaystyle{\\frac{\\partial\\ln Y_{c t}}{\\partial\\ln V_{A_{c t}}}}}{\\displaystyle{\\frac{\\partial\\ln\\ln K{\\cal A}_{c t}}{\\partial\\ln T F P_{i,c\\neq c(i),t}}}=\\sum_{k=0}^{5}\\lambda_{1}^{k}\\sum_{i=1}^{I}\\omega_{i c}\\left[{\\displaystyle{\\frac{\\partial\\ln{\\cal V}{\\cal A}_{c t}}{\\partial\\ln V{\\cal A}_{i c t}}}\\times{\\displaystyle{\\frac{\\partial\\ln{\\cal V}{\\cal A}_{i c t}}{\\partial\\ln T F P_{i,c\\neq c(i),t}}}}\\right]}}}\\ {{\\qquad=\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{5}\\lambda_{1}^{k}\\times\\sum_{k=0}^{5}\\beta_{1,V A}^{k}\\right)\\sum_{i=1}^{I}\\omega_{i c}\\times\\phi_{i c}.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIn this expression, In $Y_{c t}$ is log employment or hours in county $c$ in year $t$ as before; $\\textstyle\\sum_{k=0}^{5}\\lambda_{1}^{k}$ is the estimated effect of aggregate real value added on outcome $Y$ from eqn. (7) reported in column 5 of the lower panel of Table 9; $\\textstyle\\sum_{k=0}^{5}\\beta_{1,V A}^{k}$ is the estimated direct effect of $\\Delta\\ln T F P$ in eqn. (5) on own-industry real value-added (reported in column 5 of Table $9^{\\prime}\\mathrm{s}$ upper panel); $\\omega_{i c}$ is the time-averaged employment or hours share of industry $i$ in its respective country; and $\\phi_{i c}$ is the time-averaged value-added share of industry $i$ in country $c$ .28  \n\nFigures 5A and 5B display the results of these calculations for overall employment and hours of labor input, respectively. The first bar in Figure 5A corresponds to the direct effect of TFP growth on own-industry employment. Its height of -0.22 implies that on average, productivity growth reduced own-industry employment by approximately 8.2 percent over the full 37-year period $(0.22\\times37)$ . The second bar (\"supplier effect\"), with height 0.35, indicates that the countervailing effect of rising supplier productivity on employment in customer industries more than offset this direct effect. The third bar (\"customer effect\") with height 0.05 indicates that rising productivity in customer industries exerted a very modest positive employment effect in supplier industries. The fourth bar with height 0.30 reflects the substantial contribution of rising productivity to overall employment operating through final demand. The fifth bar (\"net effect\") sums these four components to estimate a net positive effect of productivity gains on aggregate employment, totally approximately eighteen log points $(0.48\\times37=17.8)$ ) over the outcome period.  \n\nFigure 5B reports the analogous exercise for hours of labor input rather than employment. We find comparable effects on this outcome: although rising productivity reduces relative employment in the sectors in which it occurs, it augments employment in (downstream) customer sectors (as captured by the supplier effect) and boosts aggregate demand through its contribution to overall value-added. As with employment, the net effect on hours is strongly positive.  \n\nTo provide insight into how rising TFP spurs (relative) employment declines in directlyaffected industries while simultaneously generating rising employment in the aggregate, Appendix Tables A11A and A11B report the contributions to employment growth by industry operating through each channel estimated above: direct effects, input-output linkages, and final demand effects. These contributions, underlying the aggregate employment growth predictions in Figures 5A and 5B, can be analyzed from two complementary perspectives. The first, reported in Appendix Tables A11A , calculates the contribution of TFP growth originating in each industry to the predicted aggregate change in employment. The second, reported in Appendix Table A11B, enumerates the predicted effect of TFP growth originating throughout the economy on predicted employment growth in each destination industry, scaled by that industry's weight in aggregate employment.29  \n\nFor the direct effect, the contributions to employment in the originating and destination industry are the same by definition since these direct effects operate only within industries. As shown in Tables A11A and Al1B, the negative direct effects that we estimate for employment originate in industries that have experienced strong TFP growth (such as Electrical and optical equipment, and Transport and storage), or industries that make up a large share of total value. added (such as Retail), or both.  \n\nConversely, TFP growth originating in supplier and customer industries leads to employment and hours growth elsewhere in the economy through input-output linkages. The supplier-customer contribution of any given industry to aggregate employment depends on three terms: the industry's rate of TFP growth; the weight that industry has as a supplier or customer of other industries; and, in turn, the weight that those customer and supplier industries have in aggregate employment. Industries such as Post and telecommunications, Wholesale trade, Financial intermediation, and Transport and storage, produce important positive employment spillovers to other industries, in part because they are suppliers to a variety of service industries, which are themselves a large share of total employment. These industries highlight the potential of productivity growth in service industries to induce sizable positive employment spillovers. On the other hand, Other business activities, an important supplier industry, exhibits declining productivity and thus contributes a meaningful negative employment spillover. Finally, manufacturing industries such as Chemicals, Basic and fabricated metals, and Electrical and optical equipment, make a large indirect contribution to employment in customer industries due to their rapid productivity growth.30  \n\nFinally, each industry's TFP growth potentially contributes to employment via its effect on final demand. This effect depends on two terms: the originating industry's rate of TFP growth and its share in national value-added. Hence, productivity growth in industries that make up a large share of value-added has a larger effect on overall income. Electrical and optical equipment, Post and telecommunications, Financial intermediation, Transport equipment  \n\nChemicals, and Wholesale trade are the largest contributors by TFP source to final demand, reflecting their rapid productivity growth and substantial weight in aggregate value-added.31  \n\nHow successful is our approach in capturing the evolution of employment observed in the data? Figures 6A and 6B answer this question by comparing the industry-level employment predictions of our statistical model to observed employment changes, averaged across countryyears. In each figure, employment growth predictions, obtained by summing across all channels in the model, are reported on the horizontal axis, while observed employment growth is reported on the vertical axis. Figure 6A plots the predicted versus observed log employment change by industry, while Figure 6B plots the predicted versus observed contribution that each industry makes to aggregate employment growth.32 These figures make evident that our model can account for a substantial part of the variation in employment growth by industry (Figure 6A), and the extent to which these industry effects contribute to aggregate job growth (Figure 6B). Each of the three channels featured in the model contributes to its predictive power. A regression of the observed contribution of each industry to aggregate employment growth on its predicted value based only on the direct (own-industry) effect yields an $R^{2}$ value of 0.34. Adding customer and supplier effects to this prediction raises this $R^{2}$ to 0.45. Incorporating the final demand effect raises it further to 0.61. Given that the model exclusively uses variation in TFP across industries to form predictions, we consider this as strong confirmation of the utility of our accounting framework.  \n\n#### 4.2. Aggregate labor-share effects  \n\nWe now perform the analogous exercise for the implied effect of rising TFP on labor's share of value-added. In this calculation, the own-industry, inter-industry, and final demand effects  \n\nare obtained analogously to those for employment and hours.3 However, the labor share calculation includes a fourth channel: TFP-induced compositional shifts in value-added shares across industries. This between-industry composition effect is calculated as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\Delta\\ln Y_{c t}^{C O M P}\\equiv\\displaystyle\\sum_{i}^{I}\\bigl[\\Delta\\widehat{\\omega}_{i c}\\times\\bar{l}_{i c}\\bigr]}}\\ {{\\qquad=\\displaystyle\\sum_{i}^{I}\\left[\\left\\{\\frac{\\omega_{i c}\\exp\\bigl(\\sum_{k=0}^{5}\\beta_{1,V A}^{k}\\times\\Delta\\ln T F P_{i,c\\neq c(i),t}\\bigr)}{\\sum_{i}^{I}\\bigl[\\omega_{i c}\\exp\\bigl(\\sum_{k=0}^{5}\\beta_{1,V A}^{k}\\times\\Delta\\ln T F P_{i,c\\neq c(i),t}\\bigr)\\bigr]}-\\omega_{i c}\\right\\}\\times\\bar{l}_{i c}\\right]}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nHere, $\\Delta\\widehat{\\omega}_{i c}$ is the predicted change in the value-added share of industry $i$ in country $c_{.}$ and $\\bar{l}_{i c}$ is the time-averaged log labor share in industry $i$ in country $c$ . The terms $\\omega_{i c}$ and $\\beta_{1,V A}^{k}$ are defined as in equation (10), again adjusted for the labor-share model: the time-averaged weights $\\omega_{i c}$ are shares of nominal value-added rather than shares of employment or hours worked, and the coefficients $\\beta_{1,V A}^{k}$ reflect nominal rather than real value-added coefficients (shown in column 4 of Table 9). Concretely, this prediction reflects the sum of induced shifts in each industry's share of own-country nominal value-added $(\\Delta\\omega_{i c},$ the expression in braces) multiplied by that industry's labor share.34  \n\nWe report quantitative implications for labor's share of value-added in Figure 7. The first bar reflects the labor-share effect associated with own-industry productivity growth. Its height of -0.14 suggests that on average, own-industry productivity growth reduced the labor share by some 5.2 percent over the 37-year period $(0.14\\times37)$ . Unlike for employment and hours worked, however, there are no positive countervailing effects from inter-industry linkages or final demand; rather, these additional channels also serve to decrease the aggregate labor share, albeit by small amounts compared to the direct effect $(-0.01,-0.06$ and $-0.02\\log$ points annually for respectively the supplier, customer, and final demand efects). Finally, industry composition shifts resulting from a reallocation of value-added across industries also predict a small net labor share decline: this effect amounts to approximately 1.7 percent over the entire period $(0.046\\times37)$  \n\nTaken together, allfour channels operating on the labor share— direct, supplier/customer, final demand, and composition - predict a decline of $-0.27\\log$ points annually, or around 10 percent over the entire period $(0.27\\times37)$ 0. Most of this effect stems from the direct labordisplacing effect operating within industries, combined with an absence of countervailing effects operating within-industries. Compositional shifts modestly reinforce this trend. Given an initial average labor share of around 67 percent in our 19 countries (Table 1), this corresponds to a non-negligible predicted decline of 6 percentage points over 1970-2007, of which the large majority (0.225 log points annually - that is, 8.3 percent, or around 5.5 percentage points, over the entire period) is predicted to occur within industries.  \n\nTable 10 reports the separate industry-level contributions made to these overall predictions.35 The first column shows each industry's contribution to the total predicted withinindustry effects (that is, the predicted effects for own-industry TFP growth; inter-industry linkages; and final demand taken together, which are largely driven by the own-industry effect). The second column analogously shows the contribution of each industry to the predicted between-industry effect shown in Figure 7. Table 10 highlights that most industries experience a negative within-industry labor-share effect. Predictably, some of the largest contributions are made by industries that have witnessed strong productivity growth, such as Electrical and optical equipment, Chemicals, Basic and fabricated metals, and Post and telecommunications. However, industries with more modest productivity growth but comprising relatively large shares of value added— such as Wholesale trade, and Transport and storage— also contribute substantially to the aggregate within-industry effect. Real estate, and Other business activities are the only industries that contribute a small countervailing effect: here, positive within-industry labor-share changes are predicted since these sectors have experienced negative TFP growth on average. Finally, several (public) services such as  \n\nEducation, Health and social work, and Other personal services contribute almost nothing to the predicted aggregate labor-share decline since they have experienced virtually no measured productivity growth.  \n\nTable 10 also shows that the industry-specific contributions to the composition (i.e., betweenindustry) effect are quite heterogeneous. In general, the predicted shift away from capitalintensive Mining, Utilities, and Manufacturing industries tends to increase labor's share: in isolation, these industries contribute a predicted increase in the labor share of around 1.6 percent cumulated over the period $(0.036\\times37)$ . This is reinforced by contributions from (mostly high-tech) services such as Post and telecommunications, Financial intermediation, and Transport and storage. However, Real estate single-handedly contributes a large negative compositional effect of, on average, 0.086 log points annually, or over 3 percent across the entire period. This prediction is consistent with the aggregate labor decomposition reported in Table 4 and stems from three distinctive features of the Real estate industry: a very low labor share relative to the economy-wide average; a rising share of value-added; and zero or negative TFP growth.  \n\n4.3. Why has the fall in labor share accelerated?  \n\nOur results imply that technological progress, broadly construed, has been employmentaugmenting but labor-displacing— that is, generating net employment gains while serving to reallocate value-added away from labor and towards other factors. But this observation raises a puzzle. If automation has been consistently labor-displacing, why has the evolution of labor's share differed so sharply across decades - rising during the 1970s, declining in the 1980s and 1990s, and then falling more steeply in the 2000s? We briefly take up this question here.  \n\nTable 11 reports our baseline model's predictions separately by decade. Panel A reports the observed annual log labor share change in each decade, both within and between industries, while panel B reports the changes predicted by our baseline model. This table highlights the fact that, although our baseline approach explains a substantial part of the aggregate labor share fall observed since the 1980s, it fails to match two key features of the decade-specific patterns: the positive sign of the within-industry effect operating in the 1970s, and the observed acceleration of the within-industry log labor share decline in the 2000s. The proximate reason for both mismatches is clear: the bulk of the model's explanatory power for the labor share derives from the so-called 'direct effect' — the differential decline of the labor share in industries with faster TFP growth; thus, for the baseline approach to explain the time pattern of rising and then falling labor share across decades, it would need to be the case that TFP growth was negative in the 1970s, became positive in the 1980s and 1990s, and then accelerated in the 2000s. This does not match the time pattern of TFP growth, however (see Table 3). The model does slightly better at capturing the time pattern of between-industry effects — predicting larger compositional shifts in the 1970s and 2000s, which is approximately consistent with the data - but our explanatory power is limited here as well.36  \n\nOur empirical framework admits several mechanisms through which the effect of technological progress on the labor share may differ over time. One mechanism is that an acceleration of TFP growth will lead to a more rapid fall in the labor share. But as noted above, this explanation is a non-starter because TFP growth decelerated in the 2000s even as the fall in the labor share accelerated. Second, the locus of productivity growth may be differently distributed among industries in different eras. To the extent that industries experiencing rapid TFP gains are more (or less) labor-intensive or make up a larger (or smaller) share of the total economy, the aggregate labor share will decline more (or less) strongly through, respectively, composition effects and within-industry effects. But Table 11 suggests that these explanations have a limited bite. Allowing the sources of TFP growth to differ across decades, as we do in the table, does not explain the sharp decadal differences in the between- and within-industry contributions to the fall in the labor share.  \n\nA third possibility is that, all else being equal, a given amount of overall productivity growth might have different effects in different eras if the source of that productivity growth is changing - for example, if productivity growth increasingly stems from technologies that are relatively less labor-augmenting and relatively more labor-displacing. Figure 8 suggest that this explanation has some promise. Akin to Figure 1 above, Figure 8 presents bivariate scatters of the relationship between industry-level TFP growth and changes in, respectively, industry-level log employment (Figure 8A) and industry-level log labor-share (Figure 8B). Distinct from earlier figures, the two panels of Figure 8 depict separate slopes by decade. The upper panel shows a consistently stable, downward-sloping relationship between industry-level TFP growth and relative declines in employment, with a somewhat steepening slope after the 1970s. By contrast, Figure 8B shows a much more noticeable shift in the relationship between productivity and labor's share over time. During the 1970s, there is no appreciable link between industries' productivity growth and their labor share changes. A clear negative relationship emerges in the 1980s, however, and remains in place during the 1990s and 2000s. This pattern suggests that a shift towards more labor-displacing productivity growth is a possible explanation for the fall in the labor share commencing in the 1980s.  \n\nTo explore this possibility more rigorously, we estimate a set of distributed lag models where the own-industry impact of TFP growth is allowed to vary by decade. Across a range of specifications, we find that the 1970s stand out as a period when own-industry TFP growth had a less negative effect on labor's share. We do not find much evidence of statistically significant heterogeneity in coefficients for the decades thereafter, consistent with the broad patterns shown in Figure 8B. Table 12 provides estimates of the direct effect of TFP growth on our range of outcomes, estimated separately for the 1970s and the three subsequent decades. As shown in Panel F, there is a statistically insignificant positive relationship between own-industry TFP growth and own-industry labor share changes during the 1970s, which turns statistically significant and negative for the three more recent decades. Appendix Table A12 provides additional detail by estimating these models separately by decade, applying a five-year lagged long-difference specification.37  \n\nTo assess the quantitative importance of these decadal differences, Table 13 reports a set of decade-specific predictions based on Table 12. These predictions are constructed by allowing the $\\beta_{1}^{k}$ coefficients in eqn. (8) and the $\\beta_{1,V A}^{k}$ coefficients in eqn. (11) to be different in the 1970s compared to the other three decades, thereby allowing both the effect of TFP growth on the within-industry and between-industry components of the aggregate labor-share to change over time.38 A drawback of performing predictions with these estimates is that, relative to our main estimates, the estimated TFP slopes are shallower across all periods, likely because identification of the distributed lag terms is weak in short panels. Nevertheless, the predicted within-industry pattern now qualitatively matches the turnaround after the 1970s: productivity growth is predicted to modestly increase labor's share during the 1970s and to decrease it thereafter. The model is also somewhat successful at predicting the increase in the betweenindustry component of the falling labor share in the 2000s. The model is not successful, however, in explaining the acceleration of the within-industry fall in the labor share in the 2000s.  \n\nSummarizing, our analysis broadly supports the hypothesis that the decline in the labor share since the 1980s is consistent with a shift towards more labor-displacing technology commencing in the 1980s. But the acceleration in the labor share decline observed during the 2000s is left unaccounted for by this mechanism. We hypothesize that a closer study of specific technologies may yield additional insights into these periods. At the same time, we do not assume that technological factors are the sole contributor to the changing secular pattern of the labor share decline or its recent deceleration. Instead, what our findings make clear is that technological progress has been broadly employment-augmenting and labor-displacing for at least three decades. The consistency of the evidence, rather than its over-time acceleration or deceleration, is what gives us confidence in the utility of our approach for tracing through the within-industry, between-industry, and aggregate consequences of productivity growth originating in all industries.  \n\n## 5. Concluding remarks  \n\nTheory makes clear that there is no direct mapping between the evolution of productivity and labor demand at the industry level and the evolution of labor demand in the aggregate. Theory gives less guidance about how to draw this indirect mapping. We present an empirical approach for mapping the industry-level effects of technological progress to aggregate employment and labor-share outcomes, taking into account both the direct effects of productivity growth in advancing industries and the indirect effects from inter-industry demand linkages, between-industry compositional change, and increases in final demand. Our findings indicate that these indirect effects are sizable and are countervailing for employment. We find that technological progress is broadly employment-augmenting in the aggregate. But this is not so for labor's share of value-added, where direct labor-displacing effects dominate. Our simple framework can account for a substantial fraction of both the reallocation of employment across industries and the aggregate fall in the labor share over the last three decades. It does not, however, explain why the share of labor in value-added fell more rapidly during the 2000s than in prior decades. Nor can it distinguish between the contributions of automation- versus non-automation-based sources of productivity growth, which may plausibly exert distinct effects on either employment or on labor's share of value added.  \n\nAlthough our empirical exploration of labor displacement has linked effects at the industry level to aggregate outcomes, this high-level representation is consistent with a variety of withinand between- firm adjustments. At one extreme, every firm in an industry undergoing technological progress might substitute capital for labor in a subset of tasks. Alternatively, absent any within-firm change in task allocation, a technological advance might spur an increase in industry market share among relatively capital-intensive firms and a concomitant decline among relatively labor-intensive firms.39 Under either scenario, labor's share in industry value-added would fall Our analysis cannot speak to these within-firm versus between-firm dynamics. Nevertheless, we believe that the scope of the evidence presented here complements more granular, but narrower firm-level and establishment-level studies.  \n\n6.

Introduction  \n\nThere has been an upswing of interest in economics and the media over the decline in the share of GDP going to labor. The stability of the labor share of GDP was one of the famous Kaldor (1961) “stylized facts’ of growth. The macro stability of labor's share was always, as Keynes remarked, “something of a miracle” and disguised instability at the industry level (Elsby et al. 2013). Karabarbounis and Neiman (2013) emphasize that the decline in the labor share is not confined to the U.S. and occurs primarily within rather than between industries. Although there is controversy over the degree to which the fall in the labor share is due to measurement issues such as the treatment of housing (Rognlie 2015) and intangible capital (Koh et al. 2016), there is consensus that there has been a decline in the U.S. labor share since the 1980s particularly in the 2000s.  \n\nNevertheless, little consensus exits on the causes of the decline in the labor share. Elsby et al. (2013) argue for the importance of international trade and find that the labor share declines the most in U.S. industries strongly affected by import shocks. However, labor shares have also declined in most non-traded sectors such as wholesale, retail and utilities, a pattern not readily explained by rising trade.  \n\nKarabarbounis and Neiman (2013) instead emphasize that the cost of capital has fallen relative to the cost of labor, driven especially by rapid declines in quality-adjusted equipment prices of information and communication technologies. A decline in the relative price of capital will lead to a decline in the labor share under CES production functions if the capital-labor elasticity of substitution is greater than unity. Although Karabarbounis and Neiman present evidence that the elasticity exceeds unity, the bulk of the empirical literature suggests a much lower elasticity (e.g. Lawrence 2015). Since changes in relative factor prices tend to be similar across firms, lower relative equipment prices should lead to greater capital adoption and falling labor shares in all firms. In Autor et al. (2017) we find the opposite: the unweighted mean labor share across firms has not increased much since 1982. Thus, the average firm shows little decline in its labor share. To explain the decline in the aggregate labor share, one must study the reallocation of activity among heterogeneous firms toward firms with low and declining labor shares.  \n\nIn Autor et al. (2017) we propose a new “superstar firm\" model that emphasizes the role of firm heterogeneity in the dynamics of the aggregate labor share. We hypothesize that industries are increasingly characterized by a “winner take most’ feature where one firm (or a small number of firms) can gain a very large share of the market. Large firms have lower labor shares if production requires a fixed amount of overhead labor in addition to a size-dependent variable labor input, or if markups in the product market correlate positively with firm size. Possible explanations for the growth of winner take most includes the diffusion of new competitive platforms (e.g. easier price/quality comparisons on the Internet), the proliferation of informationintensive goods that have high fixed and low-marginal costs (e.g., software platforms and online services), or increasing competition due to the rising international integration of product markets. New technologies may also have strengthened network effects and favored firms that are more adept at adopting and exploiting new modes of production.  \n\nThis paper exposits and evaluates two core claims of the superstar firm explanation: (1) the concentration of sales among firms within an industry has risen across much of the U.S. private economy; and (2) industries with larger increases in concentration should experience a larger decline in labor's share.  \n\n## II. Model  \n\nTo see the intuition for a link between the rise of superstar firms and a decline in the labor share, consider a production function $Y=A V^{\\alpha_{L}}K^{1-\\alpha_{L}}$ where $Y$ is value-added, $V$ is variable labor, $K$ is capital and $A$ is Hicks-neutral efficiency (\\*\"TFPQ\"), which we assume is heterogeneous across firms. There is a fixed amount of overhead labor $F$ needed for production, so total labor is $L=$ $V+F$ We assume that factor markets are competitive with wage w and cost of capital $r$ being equal to the input factors? marginal revenue products, while there is imperfect competition in the product market. From the static first order condition for labor, we can write the share of labor costs $(w L)$ in nominal value added $(P Y)$ as:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{S_{i}=\\left(\\frac{w L}{P Y}\\right)_{i}=\\frac{\\alpha_{L}}{\\mu_{i}}+\\frac{w F}{(P Y)_{i}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mu$ is the mark-up, the ratio of product price $(P)$ to marginal cost $(c)$ ,and $F$ is fixed overhead labor costs. The firm subscripts $i$ indicate that for given economy-wide values  of $(\\alpha_{L},w,F)$ a firm will have a lower labor share if (i) its share of fixed costs in total revenues are lower or (i) its mark-up is higher. Superstar firms (firms with high $A_{i}$ ) will be larger because they produce more efficiently and capture a higher share of industry output. Superstar firms therefore will have a lower share of fixed costs in total revenues, and thus a lower labor share. In monopolistically competitive models, the mark-up is the same across firms in an industry: $\\mu=$ $\\rho/(\\rho-1)$ ,where $\\rho$ is the price elasticity of demand. However, in other models of imperfect competition, firms with larger market shares will be able to set higher mark-ups (e.g. Cournot competition), also leading to a negative relationship between firm size and labor shares. In either case, when there is an exogenous change that allocates more market share to a small number of large superstar firms, the aggregate labor share will fall as the economy shifts towards these low labor share firms. Autor et al (2017) formalize this idea in a simple superstar firm model for a monopolistically competitive setting. Distinct from the prior literature, the superstar firm model emphasizes the heterogeneity of firms within industries as being critical for understanding the fall in the labor share. We next show that, in line with the model's mechanism, the concentration of sales across firms within industries has grown in most U.S. sectors.  \n\n## III. Data and Empirical Findings  \n\nWe use data from the U.S. Economic Census, conducted every five years to enumerate all establishments in select sectors on current economic activity. We focus on the Economic Census from 1982 to 2012 for six large sectors: manufacturing, retail trade, wholesale trade, services, finance, and utilities and transportation. The covered establishments in these six sectors account for four-fifths of total private sector employment.  \n\nFor the six sectors, the Census reports each establishment's annual payroll, output, employment, and an identifier for the firm to which the establishment belongs. To measure the concentration of sales within an industry, we use an output measure capturing total sales by the establishment during the survey year. To measure sales at the firm level, we aggregate the sales of all establishments that belong to the same firm and the same industry. If a firm operates establishments in several industries, each combination of firm and industry is counted as a separate firm, capturing the firm's separate contributions to sales concentration in several industries.  \n\nTo implement our industry-level analysis, we assign each establishment in a given year to a 1987  \n\nSIC-based time-consistent industry code as described in Autor et al. (2017). Our methodology yields 676 industries, 388 of which are in manufacturing. All of our measures use these timeconsistent industry definitions leading to measures of industry concentration that differ slightly from published statistics. The correlation between our calculated measures and those based on the published data is close to one, however, for periods without changes in industry definitions.  \n\nWe measure the concentration of sales within an industry as either the fraction of total sales accruing to its four largest firms (denoted CR4) or the fraction of sales accruing to its twenty largest firms (denoted CR20). Figure 1 plots the average CR4 and CR20 across four-digit industries for our six sectors from 1982 to 2012. The level of sales concentration varies considerably across sectors. In each year, the top four firms in an average manufacturing industry capture more than a third of the industry's total sales, while the top four firms in the average service industry combine for less than a sixth of total sales.  \n\nThere is a remarkably consistent upward trend in concentration in each sector. In manufacturing. the sales concentration ratio among the top 4 increases from $38\\%$ to $43\\%$ ; in finance, it rises from $24\\%$ to $35\\%$ ; in services from $11\\%$ to $15\\%$ ; in utilities from $29\\%$ to $37\\%$ ; in retail trade from $15\\%$ to $30\\%$ and in wholesale trade from $22\\%$ to $28\\%$ . Over the same period, there were similar or larger increases in CR20 for sales.  \n\nTo further characterize the emergence of superstar firms, Figure 1 also plots CR4 and CR20 concentration measures based on firm employment rather than sales. Again, we observe a rising concentration in all six sectors for 1982 to 2012, although employment concentration has grown notably more slowly than sales concentration in finance, services, and especially in manufacturing. The pattern suggests that firms may attain large market shares with a relatively small workforce, as exemplified by Facebook and Google.  \n\nIn Autor et al. (2017) we show that the two main qualitative findings of Figure 1 are robust to the use of an industry's Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). Sales have become more concentrated in each of the six broad sectors of the U.S. economy.  \n\nA measurement challenge for our conclusion of rising concentration for broad U.S. sectors is that our concentration measures are calculated exclusively using U.S. based establishments. Thus, our measures include production by foreign multinationals operating in the U.S., but they exclude imports. A measure only for the market shares of U.S. producers may mischaracterize concentration trends given rising import shares, particularly for manufacturing.  \n\nWe assess the importance of trade in the competitive structure of manufacturing by calculating import-adjusted concentration ratios that treat imports from major country groups as if they belong to a single firm. Figure 2 plots the import-adjusted CR4 and CR20 measures along with the original measures only for U.S.-based establishments. The series with and without trade adjustment track each other closely, reaffirming our main finding of rising sales concentration. The slightly higher level of the adjusted concentration ratios implies that foreign producers (such as China) account for a sizable fraction of sales in some manufacturing industries. Imports in such industries likely originate from a small number of major foreign firms, but our data do not permit a firm-level breakdown of imports.  \n\nA further implication of our superstar firm model is that the labor share should fall differentially in industries that are experiencing larger increases in concentration. Intuitively, the causal force in our model is the shift in competitive conditions (fall in $\\rho$ ), which reallocates market share to larger and more productive firms. Indeed, Autor et al. (2017) document a strong negative relationship in the cross section between a firm's market share and its labor share. Thus, rising concentration and falling labor shares should move in tandem, both in aggregate and between industries.  \n\nAutor et al. (2017) test this implication by estimating bivariate regressions of five-year changes in the payroll share of value-added on the contemporaneous change in concentration for the 388 manufacturing industries for the years 1987 - 2012. Figure 3, sourced from Autor et al. (2017), summarizes these regressions. In the initial five years of our sample, we detect no significant cross-industry relationship between rising concentration and falling labor share. But the crossindustry relationship between rising concentration and falling labor share becomes negative and significant in the next five-year interval, and grows in absolute magnitude across each subsequent interval. In the final period from 2007 to 2012, we estimate that each percentage point rise in an industry's CR20 concentration index predicts a 0.4 percentage point fall in its labor share. We also observe a similar negative relationship between changes in the share of labor in sales and concentration in all six sectors.  \n\nWhy has industry sales concentration increased? One set of explanations involves a technological change that has made markets increasingly “winner take most’ so that superstar firms with higher productivity increasingly capture a larger slice of the market. Or if incumbents are more likely to innovate and the persistence of incumbent's innovative advantage has risen (Acemoglu and Hildebrand 2017), the incumbent advantage would increase and so would incumbents’ market shares.  \n\nAn alternative set of explanations posits that higher concentration could arise from anticompetitive forces whereby dominant firms are increasingly able to prevent actual and potential rivals from entering and expanding (Barkai 2016). For instance, firms may lobby for regulatory barriers that complicate market entry/expansion for new and small firms. Higher entry barriers would enable incumbents to have higher monopolistic rents and therefore lower the labor share.  \n\nIn the first set of explanations, the industries becoming increasingly concentrated will tend to be more dynamic with higher productivity and technical change. By contrast in the second set of explanations, the concentrating industries are likely to be dominated by less productive and less dynamic incumbents.  \n\nTo shed light on these alternatives, we explored the relationship between changes in concentration and changes in other industry characteristics. Data limitations restrict this analysis to manufacturing. We find that the industries that became more concentrated over our sample period were also the industries in which productivity—measured by either output per worker, value-added per worker, TFP, or patents per worker—increased the most. Interestingly, there is no strong relationship between the change in concentration and the change in average wages. The findings suggest that a positive productivity-concentration relationship will most likely feature in any plausible explanation of rising industry concentration.  \n\n## IV. Conclusions  \n\nWe have considered a “superstar firm”’ explanation for the much-discussed fall in labor share of GDP. Our hypothesis is that technology or market conditions—or their interaction—have evolved to increasingly concentrate sales among firms with superior products or higher productivity thereby enabling the most successful firms to control a larger market share. Because these superstar firms are more profitable, they will have a smaller share of their labor in total sales or value added. Consequently, the aggregate share of labor falls as the weight of superstar firms in the economy grows. The model yields many predictions that are elaborated and tested in Autor et al. (2017). A key underpinning of the superstar firm explanation for declining labor share is that sales should become increasingly concentrated in a small number of firms across a wide range of industries. Consistent with the model, we find that the concentration of sales (and of employment) has indeed risen from 1982 to 2012 in each of the six major sectors covered by U.S. Economic Census. In Autor et al. (2017), we further show that those industries where concentration rises the most have the sharpest falls in the labor share, and that the fall in the labor share is mainly due to a reallocation of labor towards firms with lower (and declining) labor shares, rather than due to declining labor shares within most firms.  \n\nAcemoglu, Daron and Nikolaus Hildebrand. 2017. “Increasing Concentration and Persistence of Innovation: Facts and Theory.\" Working Paper, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  \n\nAutor, David, David Dorn, Lawrence F.

To identify the causal effects of common ownership on labor market outcomes, we use a firm's addition to the S&P 500 index as a shock to the common ownership of its competitors in local labor markets. Using a matched difference-in-differences analysis, we find that, after a firm enters the S&P 500 index, the average annual earnings per employee of its local competitors decrease relative to the counterfactual. The effect of S&P 500 index additions on employee earnings is stronger in local labor markets where the employment shares of S&P 500 firms were higher or union coverage rates were lower ex ante. The effect is not driven by changes in workforce characteristics. We also find that an increase in common ownership leads to higher separation rates in treated local labor markets. Perhaps surprisingly, it increases their hiring rates even more, resulting in an overall positive effect on total employment. While together these facts are inconsistent with the canonical oligopsony model, we show that they can be rationalized in a generalized model of oligopsony with a recruitment intensity decision by firms.  \n\nJEL Classification Codes: J42, J31, L40, D40, G34  \n\nKey Words: Monopsony, oligopsony, labor markets, competition policy, common ownership  \n\nAcknowledgments: We are grateful for comments from Ioana Marinescu, Martin Schmalz, and the participants at the Midwest Economics Association meeting and SOLE 2022.

INTRODUCTION  \n\nOwnership of publicly traded U.S. corporations by institutional investors went from less than 10 percent in the 1950s to 67 percent by 2010 (Blume and Keim, 2012). Together with the shift in assets from actively managed funds to passively managed index funds, this generated a dramatic increase in common ownership of publicly traded firms (see, for example, Azar and Vives, 2021; Backus et al., 2021b).1 This trend has raised the alarm that a small number of giant asset managers (especially the largest three, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street) could effectively control most large, publicly traded firms in the near future (Coates, 2018). Increased common ownership could increase firms' employer market power, which in turn could contribute to the wage stagnation since the 1970s (Goshen and Levit, forthcoming; Steinbaum, 2021; Azar and Vives, 2021).2 Although this argument is theoretically appealing, little is known about whether and how common ownership affects employee earnings in reality.  \n\nThis paper provides the first empirical evidence on the effects of common ownership on employee earnings in the U.S. economy. We define a local labor market as the interaction between a commuting zone (CZ) and an industry, as in Rinz (2020). To measure common ownership in a local labor market, we combine data on institutional ownership of publicly traded firms from Backus et al. (2021b) with data on firms' employment shares in each local labor market, constructed from establishment-level employment data from Data Axle. We find that average common ownership across local labor markets more than doubled in the United States between 1999 and 2017. To measure employee earnings at the local labor market level, we use data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW).  \n\nTo identify the causal effect of common ownership on employee earnings, we follow Boller and Scott Morton (2020) and use natural experiments generated by firms' additions to the $\\mathsf{S}\\&\\mathsf{P}$ 500 index. The key idea is that a firm entering the S&P 500 index (which we refer to as a focal firm) experiences a sharp increase in institutional ownership. This, in turn, increases overlap between its ownership and that of its publicly traded industry competitors in a local labor market (nonfocal firms), especially $\\mathrm{S\\&P}500$ incumbents. As a result, the average common ownership of nonfocal firms would increase after focal firms are added to the S&P 500 index. Because firm compositions are different across local labor markets before a S&P 500 index addition event, the same event would generate heterogeneous treatment statuses across local labor markets. Based on this variation, we use a difference-in-differences (DiD) design to estimate the causal effect of common ownership on employee earnings.  \n\nIn DiD regressions, we compare changes in employee earnings at nonfocal firms in local labor markets where at least one focal firm enters the S&P 500 index (treated local labor markets) to changes in matched local industries where no firms ever enter or exit the S&P 500 index by the end of estimation window (control local industries).3 The main identification assumption underlying the DiD design is that the employee earnings of nonfocal firms in treated local labor markets would have evolved similarly to earnings in control local labor markets in the absence of S&P 500 index additions.  \n\nAs expected, S&P 500 index additions indeed lead to an increase in the average common ownership of nonfocal firms in treated local labor markets. Specifically, our estimate shows that, compared to control local labor markets, the average common ownership of nonfocal firms in treated local labor markets increases 0.4 percentage points during the five-year window after treatment. The magnitude of the estimated effect is economically meaningful and represents a 18 percent increase relative to the sample mean of 2.2 percentage points in treated local labor markets one year prior to treatment.  \n\nS&P 500 index additions lead to lower average employee earnings of nonfocal firms in treated local labor markets. The average annual earnings per employee among nonfocal firms in treated local labor markets are 1.1 percent lower compared to the counterfactual during the post-treatment period. Given that the average employee earnings among nonfocal firms in treated local labor markets are $\\$44,317$ one year prior to treatment, our estimates suggest that an employee of nonfocal firms in treated local labor markets with average pay earns $\\$487$ les peryear, or $\\$2,437$ less in total relative to the counterfactual during the first five years after treatment. The results are robust to alternative sets of matched control local labor markets, using an alternative source of institutional ownership data, and using a different local labor market definition.  \n\nThe estimated earnings effect of S&P 500 index additions varies with the share of S&P 500 incumbent firms in a treated local labor market during the year of an index addition event. We split the treated local labor markets into terciles based on the share of $\\mathrm{S\\&P500}$ incumbent firms, and re-implement the matched DiD analysis for each subsample. The estimated effect of S&P 500 index additions is the largest for treated local labor markets in the top tercile of S&P 500 incumbent shares. Annual earnings per employee among nonfocal firms in these treated local labor markets were 2.4 percent lower in the post-treatment period compared to the counterfactual. In comparison, the estimated average treatment effect was only 0.8 percent for treated local labor markets with S&P 500 incumbent shares falling in the bottom tercile.  \n\nThis heterogeneity result lends further credibility to our DiD estimation strategy. Additional analyses also show that the estimated effect on employee earnings comes from labor markets with low union coverage rates prior to treatment and is not driven by changes in workforce characteristics, suggesting that increased employer market power is more likely to be a driving force behind the employee earnings effect of common ownership.  \n\nOur results on employee earnings could be consistent with classical monoposony model or other models of employer market power. The classical monopsony model predicts that increased common ownership would reduce total employment, while other models-for example, Jarosch et al. (2021)—show that changes in employer market power could affect employee earnings without affecting employment levels. However, we find that total employment of nonfocal firms increases in treated local labor markets after S&P 5o0 index additions relative to the counterfactual.  \n\nTo try to further understand this positive effect on total employment, we examine the effects of common ownership on hiring and separating rates. We find that separation rates increase, consistent with lower wages making the jobs at the treated local labor markets less attractive. However, we also observe an even larger increase in hiring rates in treated local labor markets, which explains (in a proximate way) why employment increases despite higher separation rates. This suggests that firms in treated markets are able to and have incentives to increase their employment level—-despite having lower wages per employee—by increasing their recruitment intensity.  \n\nThese empirical facts are not consistent with prior models of labor market power that we are aware of. However, we show that one can rationalize our empirical findings in a model of oligopsony in which the supply of workers to a firm is a function not only of its wage, but also of its expenditure on recruitment (Manning, 2006; Forsythe and Weinstein, 2021).4 Our model predicts that a higher common ownership among firms in a local labor market would lead to lower equilibrium wages, but its impact on recruitment intensity is ambiguous. On one hand, a higher common ownership could reduce a firm's incentive to spend on recruiting. The reason is that the firm would internalize more of its rivals' profits but an increased recruitment intensity would lead to more competitions and reduce the profits of the firm's competitors. On the other hand, a firm's incentive to recruit could increase when common ownership is higher. This is because a higher common ownership would lead to lower equilibrium wages, resulting in higher profits per recruited employee. It would then incentivize the firm to spend more resources on recruiting. The effect of common ownership on equilibrium recruitment intensity and employment can be positive or negative, depending on the parameters of the model.  \n\nThis paper builds off two strands of literature. First, it adds to the literature on the real effects of common ownership, making two contributions. The first contribution is providing the first measures of common ownership at the local labor market level. Average local labor market common ownership has more than doubled between 1999 and 2017, increasing from 1.9 percentage points to 4 percentage points. The second contribution is providing evidence on the causal effects of common ownership on employee earnings at the local labor market level. Prior studies focus on the effects of common ownership on product markets (see, for example, Azar et al., 2018; Newham et al., 2018; Ruiz-Pérez, 2019; Backus et al., 2021a), executive compensation (Anton et al., 2022), and innovation (Lopez and Vives, 2019; Anton et al., 2021), but little is known about its effects on labor markets. This paper starts to fill this gap, and the results suggest that common ownership leads to lower employee earnings in local labor markets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical evidence on the effects of common ownership on local labor markets. With the availability of the common ownership measure at the local labor market level, future research can shed more light on how common ownership affects labor market outcomes beyond the outcomes we consider in the paper.  \n\nThe paper also relates to the literature on imperfect competition in labor market. The labor economics literature has generally found that firms face upward sloping labor supplies, indicating the existence of monopsony power (Ashenfelter et al., 2010; Manning, 2011; Staiger et al., 2010; Falch, 2010; Ransom and Sims, 2010; Matsudaira, 2013; Goolsbee and Syverson, 2019; Dube et al., 2020; Manning, 2021; Bassier et al., 2022). Some prior studies measure labor market power by employer concentration, in particular, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) based on either job posting share (Azar et al., 2020) or employment share (Benmelech et al., 2020; Prager and Schmitt, 2021; Rinz, 2020; Arnold, 2021; Qiu and Sojourner, 2022). The conclusion from these studies is that HHI in a labor market is negatively associated with employee earnings at the market or establishment level. But employer concentration is only one source of employer market power and is far from the only one. For example, search friction or job differentiation can give firms wage-setting power, even in unconcentrated markets (Manning, 2021; Card et al., 2018; Azar et al., 2019). While we find new evidence that common ownership increased in recent decades, these papers show that employment concentration has not. We contribute to this literature by showing that rising connections among firms via common shareholders may have increased employer market power in the United States in recent decades.  \n\n## 11. DATA DESCRIPTION  \n\n### H. A. Local Labor Market Definition  \n\nWe follow Rinz (2020) and define a local labor market as the interaction between a commuting zone (CZ) (2000 version) and a four-digit NAICS industry (2012 version). A CZ is a cluster of contiguous counties that reflect the local economies where people live and work. There are 709 CZs in the United States. Another choice of the geographic area in the local labor market definition is a core-based statistical area (CBSA), which are also clusters of contiguous counties. An average CBSA is smaller than an average CZ since CBSAs exclude a large fraction of the United States, especially in the Midwest and West regions. We show later that our results are robust if the geographical borders of labor markets are delineated by CBSAs.  \n\n### II. B. Local Labor Market Common Ownership  \n\nTo measure common ownership at the local labor market level, we combine data on employment share of each firm in a local labor market with data on institutional ownership at the firm level. To measure employment share of a firm in a local labor market, we use establishmentlevel employment data from Data Axle Business Data (Data Axle hereafter). Data Axle is a business-to-business marketing company and provides data on almost every business in the United States and Canada.5 Our access to Data Axle starts in 1997 and ends in 2018. Between 1997 and 2018, Data Axle on average covers 13.5 million establishments annually, with 11.3 million establishments surveyed in 1997, and the number increases to 14.7 million in 2018. For each surveyed establishment, Data Axle reports employment, sales, 2012 version six-digit NAICS industry, geographic location (longitude, latitude, zip code, county, and state), and ultimate parent company. Data Axle verifies establishment-level employment data by a phone survey process. Each establishment is assigned a unique identifier by Data Axle, the ABI number, which stays constant even if the ownership of an establishment changes. We drop establishments with only one employee from the sample, as our data source on earnings excludes nonemployer establishments. We match the ultimate parent firms in Data Axle to publicly traded firms in the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) by firm names by using a fuzzy name-matching procedure. An ultimate parent firm in Data Axle is uniquely matched to one firm identifier in CRSP, PERMCO, in each year.  \n\nData on institutional ownership (IO) of U.S. publicly traded firms are from Backus et al. (2021b).6 In the United States, all institutional investment managers with at least $\\$100$ million in assets under management are required to file the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Form 13F and disclose information on their securities holdings. Backus et al. (2021b) scrapes the IO data from 13F files directly and the data are available between the first quarter of 1999 and the third quarter of 2017. For the \"Big Three\" (BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street) and Barclays, we follow Backus et al. (2021b) and aggregate ownership data to the fund family level based on the asset manager's name in the data.  \n\nCombining IO data from Backus et al. (2021b) with firm's local labor market employment share calculated from Data Axle, we measure common ownership in each local labor market each year. We use information on both publicly traded and privately held firms when constructing the measure. Suppose there are $J_{m}$ employing firms in a local labor market m. Let $\\omega_{j}$ be the employment share for firm $j$ in local labor market m. For each shareholder $s$ ,let $\\beta_{j s}$ be shareholder $s^{\\prime}\\mathbf{s}$ oWnership share in firm $j$ If firm $j$ is not publicly traded, then $\\beta_{j s}\\equiv0$ . We maintain a proportional control assumption so that shareholder $s^{\\prime}\\mathbf{s}$ voting share is equal to its contro share. For any two firms and k, their degree of common ownership is y;k = s P;,psIf either firm $j$ or $k$ is not publicly traded or not held by any institutional investors, then $\\lambda_{j,k}=0$ Then, common ownership in a local labor market, $\\lambda_{m},$ is  \n\n$$\n\\lambda_{m}=\\sum_{j=1}^{J_{m}}\\left(\\sum_{\\boldsymbol{k}\\neq j}\\frac{\\omega_{j}\\omega_{\\boldsymbol{k}}}{1-\\omega_{j}}\\times\\lambda_{j,\\boldsymbol{k}}\\right),\n$$  \n\nGiven that institutional ownership data are at the quarterly level, we first calculate local labor market-level common ownership measure in each quarter and then take the simple average across all quarters in a year to construct the annual measure.  \n\nFigure I reports the trend of local labor market-level common ownership between 1999 and 2017. In each year, we calculate the Data Axle employment-weighted average of the common ownership across local labor markets. The figure shows that common ownership at the local labor market level has trended up over the period 1999-2017. In 1999, the average local common ownership is 0.019, and it more than doubles to 0.04 in 2017.  \n\nFigure II shows a map of 708 commuting zones in our sample color-coded by the average common ownership in 2017.7 In each commuting zone, we calculate the employment-weighed average common ownership across four-digit NAICS industries. The map shows that there is a large variation in common ownership across commuting zones. The measured common ownership is higher for commuting zones in the Southern and part of the Midwest region. The commuting zone with the highest common ownership is the one that consists of Benton County, AR, Madison County, AR, Washington County, AR, and McDonald County, MO (CZ  \n\nID=240) with a value of 0.205.  \n\nFigure II reports the top twenty four-digit NAICS industries in terms of average common oWnership in 2017. In each four-digit NAICS industry, we calculate the employment-weighed average common ownership across commuting zones. The top five industries in terms of average common ownership are \"Department Stores (NAICS code $!=\\cdot$ 4521)\", \"Other General Merchandise Stores (NAICS code $=4529$ )\", \"Aerospace Product and Parts Manufacturing (NAICS code $\\scriptstyle=3364)^{\\prime\\prime}$ , \"Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite) (NAICS code $\\therefore$ 5172)”， and \"Cable and Other Subscription Programming (NAICS code=5152)\".  \n\n### 1I. C. Earnings  \n\nTo measure average earnings per employee in each local labor market each year, we use data on total payroll and total employment at the county $\\times$ four-digit NAICS industry from the annual average files of the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW). The NAICS industry codes in QCEW change versions over time, and we harmonize all four-digit NAICS codes to the 2012 version.8 This procedure produces a measure of total payroll and total employment at the county $\\times2012$ version four-digit NAICS industry level that is consistent over time. We aggregate payroll and employment data at the county $\\times4$ NAICS level data up to the CZ level to measure them at the local labor market level. Average annual earnings per employee in a local labor market is defined as the ratio of payroll to employment.  \n\n# III. DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES ANALYSIS  \n\nTo examine whether and how common ownership affects employee earnings, we explore a potentially exogenous shock to local labor market common ownership induced by firms' additions to the S&P 500 index and estimate causal effects of common ownership on annual earnings per employee at local competitor firms.? Section IHl. A. introduces the details of research design and Section II. B. reports the estimation results.  \n\n## III. A. Empirical Specification  \n\nWe follow Boller and Scott Morton (2020) and use the addition of a firm to the S&P 500 index (focal firm) as a shock to common ownership of its industry competitors (nonfocal firms) in a local labor market. Boller and Scott Morton (2020) shows that a firm entering the $\\mathrm{S\\&P500}$ index experiences a sharp increase in institutional ownership, leading to an increased overlap between the firm and its publicly traded industry competitors via common owners. As a result, the average common ownership of nonfocal firms in a local labor market tends to increase after focal firms enter the S&P 500 index. More importantly, a focal firm's addition to the index does not change the nature of operations and products of nonfocal firms and is also unlikely to alter nonfocal firms' visibility to institutional investors or analysts. This strategy has also been used in Anton et al. (2022) to study the effect of common ownership on CEO compensation structure.  \n\nTo draw causal inferences on whether and how common ownership affects employee earnings, we examine how the average annual earnings per employee of nonfocal firms in a local labor market change after focal firms are added to the S&P 500 index, compared to the one in local labor markets where firms never enter or exit the index in the sample. For each index addition event, we choose the estimation window to be five years around the event. Given that our common ownership measure is available between 1999 and 2017, we use index addition events between years 2004 and 2012. We call firms entering the $\\mathrm{S\\&P500}$ index in the same year as being in the same cohort. There are 192 index addition events across the 9 cohorts in our sample. Combining data on index addition events with data on the locations, employment, and parent firms of establishments in Data Axle, we can measure heterogeneous treatment statuses induced by $\\mathrm{S\\&P500}$ index additions across local labor markets.  \n\nA local labor market is defined to be treated in a cohort if it satisfies the following three conditions during the year of an index addition event: 1) there exists at least one firm that enters the S&P 500 index; 2) there is no firm that exits the S&P 500 index; and 3) there is at least one firm that has already been in the S&P 500 index. To avoid multiple, sequential shocks in the same local labor market which can muddy the treatment status of a given local labor market and in a year, if a treated local labor market also experiences other index addition or exit events within the estimation window, we exclude it from the sample. A local labor market is defined to be a control local labor market in a cohort if there is no firm that enters or exits the S&P 500 index between 1997, the first year we have access to Data Axle, and the end of the estimation Window.  \n\nTo measure the effect of local common ownership on employee average annual earnings, We want to exclude employees of the focal firm that was added to the S&P 500 index, which is challenging without establishment-level earnings data. We use QCEW data to construct annual earnings per employee among nonfocal firms in a local labor market.10  \n\nA CZ is a cluster of counties but the composition of counties in a $\\mathrm{CZ}\\times$ four-digit NAICS with non-missing payroll and employment data in QCEW may change over time. To avoid this composition issue within a local labor market, we therefore focus on county $\\times$ four-digit NAICS cells with balanced panels of observed QCEW payroll and employment.11  \n\nFor a treated local labor market, we first define focal cells as county $\\times$ five-digit NAICS cells to which focal firms belong and define nonfocal cells as county $\\times$ five-digit NAICS cells that do not contain any focal firm. If all focal cells have balanced panels of payroll and employment within the estimation window, we then subtract payroll (employment) of all focal cells from payroll (employment) in a county $\\times$ four-digit NAICS cell; otherwise, we use the sum of payroll (employment) of nonfocal cells with balanced panels of payroll (employment) within the estimation window. After performing this procedure, the data on payroll and employment at thecounty $\\times$ four-digit NAICS level are clean; they do not contain any information of any focal firm.  \n\nFor each cohort of S&P 500 index additions, we restrict our sample to county $\\times$ four-digit NAICS industries with balanced panels of strictly positive payroll, total employment, and publicly traded and privately held firms employment within the estimation window. We then aggregate all these outcomes to the $\\mathrm{CZ}\\times$ four-digit NAICS level. To be consistent with the way other variables are constructed, we recalculate the average common ownership in a local labor market for nonfocal firms with operations in the above-mentioned county $\\times$ four-digit NAICS cells.  \n\nWe use a difference-in-differences (DiD) design to estimate the treatment effects of $\\mathrm{S\\&P500}$ index additions on average annual earnings per employee of nonfocal firms in a local labor market. In the raw data, the parallel trends assumption is violated. Therefore, we employ a matched DiD estimator and it involves two steps. In the first step, we match each treated local labor market to a set of control local labor markets within each cohort. Specifically, we run a linear regression in each cohort by regressing a local labor market's treatment status on a list of pre-treatment variables. We then match each treated local labor market to the ten nearest control local labor markets based on the estimated propensity scores. We further require the absolute value of the difference in propensity scores between a treated and a control local labor market, the caliper, to be less than or equal to 0.1 percent. In Section IHl. B..3, we show that our results are robust to alternatives choices of the number of matched control local labor markets Or the calipers.  \n\nThe list of pre-treatment variables used in matching includes the change in local common ownership, the change in the natural logarithm of average annual earnings per employee, and the change in total employment in each year during the four-year period before index addition events. Matching on these time-varying characteristics helps identify control local labor markets such that the trends of these key outcomes are parallel between treated and control local labor markets before treatment. In addition, we also include the pre-treatment mean of local labor market and CZ characteristics in the list to estimate propensity scores. Characteristics at the local labor market level include distribution (10th, 25th, median, 75th, and 90th percentiles) of the natural logarithm of establishment employment, employment share of publicly traded firms, average total institutional ownership, and average top five institutional ownership, all of which are calculated based on Data Axle data. Characteristics at the CZ level include population density, unemployment rate, demographics (shares of female, whites, blacks, Hispanics, people with ages between 20 and 24, between 45 and 64, and greater than or equal to 65), the extent to which a CZ is subject to the right-to-work (RTW) law, and the enforcement level of noncompete agreement (NCA) in a CZ.  \n\nThese are measured as follows. Population density at the $\\mathrm{CZ}\\times$ year level is defined as population per square mile and is calculated based on the Census Gazetteer files at the county $\\times$ year level.12 Unemployment rate at the $\\mathrm{CZ}\\times$ year level is calculated based on county $\\times$ year-level data from Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) program through the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).13 Demographics at the $\\mathrm{CZ}\\times$ year level are calculated based on county $\\times$ yearlevel data from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program.14 To measure the extent to which a CZ is subject to the RTW law in a year, we calculate the average RTW law adoption dummies of all the states in the $\\mathrm{CZ}$ weighted by the state population share in the CZ (measured in year 2000). Data on state-level RTW law adoptions is from Knepper (2020). To measure the NCA enforcement level in a CZ in a year, We calculate the average NCA enforcement index of all the states in the CZ weighted by the state population share in the CZ (measured in year 200o). Data on state-level NCA enforcement index is from Marx (forthcoming). There are 31 matching variables in total. We have 2,090 pairs of matched treated and control local labor markets in the sample. Table I reports the pre-treatment mean of outcome variables as well as local labor market and CZ characteristics for treated and control local labor markets.  \n\nIn the second step, we estimate average treatment effect on treated of $\\mathrm{S\\&P~}500$ index additions on employee earnings. Following Cengiz et al. (2019), we first stack the observations across all matched pairs and then run the following regression by including matched pair $\\times$ local labor market and matched pair $\\times$ year fixed effects. There are at least two advantages of this specification. First, it aligns matched pairs of treated and control local labor markets by event time and this is equivalent to a setting in which all the events happen at the same time rather than being staggered over time. Second, we use \"clean controls\" in the sense that control local labor markets have not been treated yet by the end of estimation window. Using this specification would mitigate the concerns in Goodman-Bacon (2021) on using the canonical two-way fixed effects model to estimate treatment effects in a DiD setting and is in a similar spirit to the method proposed in Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021).  \n\n$$\n\\L_{p(k)c i t}=T r e a t e d_{p(k)c i}\\times\\sum_{\\substack{n=-5\\&n\\neq-1}}^{5}\\beta_{n}\\times\\mathbb{1}(t-t_{k}=n)+\\mu_{p(k)c i}+\\eta_{p(k)t}+\\epsilon_{p(k)c i}\n$$  \n\nwhere $c,i,$ and $t$ index for $\\mathbf{CZ},$ four-digit NAICS industry, and year, respectively. $p(k)$ indexes for a matched pair of a treated and control local labor markets in cohort $k$ $y_{p(k)c i t}$ is the natural logarithm of average annual earnings per employee in local labor market $(c i)$ in year $t$ of matched pair $p(k)$ . The coefficients of interest are $\\beta_{n}$ . The estimated coefficients capture the dynamics of the relative outcome between treated and control local labor markets over time. The omitted category is $n=-1$ , the year immediately before an index addition event. $\\beta_{n}$ is interpreted as the average relative change in an outcome between local labor markets in treated and control groups across all pairs during time $n$ , relative to time $-1$ . If outcomes in treated and control local labor markets are on similar trends before index addition events, then $\\beta_{-5},$ $\\beta_{-4},\\beta_{-3},$ and $\\beta_{-2}$ Would be small in magnitude and statistically insignificant.  \n\nTo estimate the average treatment effect, we estimate the following regression:  \n\n$$\ny_{p(k)c i t}=\\beta\\times T r e a t e d_{p(k)c i}\\times\\mathbb{1}(t-t_{k}>0)+\\mu_{p(k)c i}+\\eta_{p(k)t}+\\epsilon_{p(k)c i t},\n$$  \n\nThe parameter of interest is $\\beta$ and it measures the average change in the outcome variable  \n\nin treated local labor markets relative to that in control local labor markets.  \n\n## Il. B. Estimation Results  \n\n### 111. B..1 Main Results  \n\nIn this subsection, we report the estimated results on the effects of S&P 500 index additions on the average common ownership and average annual earnings per employee of nonfocal firms in a local labor market.  \n\nWe start with the estimation of equation (Il.1) for average common ownership of nonfocal firms in a local labor market. The results are reported in Figure IV and columns (1) and (2) of Table A.2. The results show that the trajectories of common ownership among nonfocal firms in treated and control local labor markets are parallel before focal firms' additions to the $\\mathsf{S}\\&\\mathsf{P}$ 500 index. During the post-treatment period, we observe a significant increase in the average common ownership of nonfocal firms in treated local labor markets relative to control local labor markets. The common ownership of nonfocal firms on average increases 0.4 percentage points and it is statistically significant at $1\\%$ level. Given that the sample average of common oWnership of nonfocal firms during the pre-treatment period is 2.2 percentage points, the estimated average treatment effect is economically meaningful and represents an $18\\%$ increase. The results confirm that focal firms' additions to the S&P 500 index indeed lead to an increase in the average common ownership of nonfocal firms in a local labor market and the results are consistent with the evidence in Boller and Scott Morton (2020).  \n\nWe next report the estimation of equation (II. .1) for average annual earnings per employee among nonfocal firms in a local labor market. The results are in Figure V and columns (3) and (4) of Table A.2. The estimated coefficients during the pre-treatment period are close to zero and statistically insignificant, adding credibility to the maintained parallel trends assumption post-treatment. The trajectories of average annual earnings per employee in nonfocal firms between treated and control local labor markets only start to diverge since the first year after treatment. Average annual earnings per employee of nonfocal firms decreases $1.1\\%$ relative to control local labor markets after focal firms enter the S&P 500 index, and it is statistically significant at $1\\%$ level. Given that the average nonfocal firms' annual earnings per employee in treated local labor markets during the pre-treatment period is $\\$44,317$ our estimate suggests that an average employee of nonfocal firms in treated local labor markets earns $\\$487$ less per year, or $\\$2,437$ in total relative to the counterfactual during the first five years after treatment. Figure $\\mathrm{V}$ also shows that estimated effect becomes stronger over time. During the first year after treatment, the estimate shows that the average annual earnings per employee is $0.8\\%$ lower in treated local labor markets relative to the counterfactual. By the fifth year after treatment, the magnitude of the estimated negative effect increases to $1.7\\%$  \n\n### II1. B..2 Heterogeneity  \n\nIn addition to the baseline estimates on employee earnings, we examine heterogeneous effects of treatment intensity. We proxy the treatment intensity in a treated local labor market by the employment share of S&P 500 index incumbents, the publicly traded firms that are already in the S&P 500 index, during the event year (S&P500Share). We expect the estimated effects on the average annual earnings per employee to be larger for treated local labor markets with higher employment shares of S&P 500 incumbents.  \n\nWe split the treated local labor markets into terciles based on S&P500Share. For each treated local labor market in a tercile, we re-implement the procedure described in Section I1. A. and match it to a set of control local labor markets. We then re-estimation equation (Il1. .1) for each subsample and report the results in Figure VI and Table A.3. The estimates are consistent with our expectations. For treated local labor markets with S&P500Share falling in the top tercile, the estimated effect is the largest. The average annual earnings per employee of nonfocal firms in treated local labor markets is $2.4\\%$ lower compared to the counterfactual. In contrast, for treated local labor markets with S&P500share falling in the bottom tercile, the estimated coefficient on Treated $\\times$ Post is O.8 percentage points and is statistically insignificant. The difference between these two estimates is statistically significant at the $1\\%$ level. This heterogeneity result lends further credibility to our DiD strategy.  \n\n### 11I. B.3 Robustness  \n\nIn this subsection, we perform five robustness tests. First, we report estimation results for alternative numbers of control industries matched to a treated local labor market and alternative choices of the caliper. The results are reported in Table A.5. In column (1), a treated local labor market is still matched to 10 control local labor markets with the closest propensity scores but we do not make any restriction on the caliper. In columns (2) and (3), a treated local labor market is matched to fifteen control local labor markets with the closest propensity scores. We set the caliper at $0.1\\%$ in column (2) but do not make any restriction on caliper in column (3). In columns (4) and (5), a treated local labor market is matched to five control local labor markets with the closest propensity scores. We set the caliper at $0.1\\%$ in column (4) but do not make any restriction on the caliper in column (5). The estimated effects for common ownership and annual earnings per employee in nonfocal firms in a local labor market are very similar to the Ones in Table A.2.  \n\nSecond, we include CZ fixed effects instead of including a list of pre-treatment CZ-level characteristics when estimating propensity scores. The estimated results for common ownership and average annual earnings per employee of nonfocal firms in a local labor market are reported in Figure A.1 and Table A.6. Results are robust. Compared to control local labor markets, common ownership of nonfocal firms increase 0.4 percentage points while employee earnings is $0.9\\%$ lower after focal firms are added to the S&P 500 index.  \n\nThird, we calculate common ownership at the local labor market level using institutional ownership data from the Thomson Reuters 13F database (13F data) and re-estimate equation (II. .1). These data are from the Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) and we correct the errors in 13F data using the methods in Ben-David et al. (2021). We use data between 1997 and 2018 during which we have access to Data Axle and there are 12 cohorts of S&P 500 index addition events. The estimated results for common ownership and average annual earnings per employee in nonfocal firms in a local labor market are reported in Figure A.2 and Table A.7. Our results are robust to using this alternative source of institutional ownership data.  \n\nFourth, we use an alternative definition of local labor market. We here define a local labor market as the interaction between a CBSA (2013 version) and a four-digit NAICS industry (2012 version). We re-implement the procedure described in Section II. A. The results are reported in Figure A.3 and Table A.8. Results are robust to this alternative definition of local labormarket.  \n\nFinally, as a robustness check, we estimate the effects of common ownership on employee earnings in a local labor market using ordinary least square (OLS) and two-stage least square (2SLS) panel regressions, based on all local labor market labor markets over the period 1998- 2019. Our instrumental variable (IV) for common ownership in a local labor market is the average of the equally-weighted local common ownership for the same industry in other CZs in a given year (Azar et al., 2020; Rinz, 2020). The main identification assumption in our IV analysis is that ownership itself is exogenous, which is commonly assumed in the structural common ownership literature (see, for example, Backus et al., 2021a; Ruiz-Pérez, 2019). This IV purges of any idiosyncratic variation in local common ownership or variation that is driven by changing labor market shares, and focuses on the part of variation that is driven by nationwide changes in common ownership. Both OLS and 2SLS results suggest that an increase in common ownership in a local labor market is associated with lower annual earnings per employee, but the magnitudes of 2SLS estimates are much larger. In the specification with local labor market and $\\mathrm{CZ}\\times$ year fixed effects, OLS estimates suggest that a one-standard-deviation increase in local common ownership is associated with a $0.31\\%$ decrease in annual earnings per employee, while IV estimates imply a one-standard-deviation increase in common ownership reduces employee earnings by $1.21\\%$ Or $\\$518$ per year. As in Azar et al. (2020) and Rinz (2020), a concern with the IV analysis is that, within industry, local unobservable shocks driving both employee earnings and common ownership could be correlated across CZs. The methodology and results are described in more detail in the Appendix.  \n\n## III. C. Effects on Workforce Characteristics  \n\nEmployee earnings effects of S&P 500 index additions could occur by affecting workforce composition. To examine whether this is the case, we utilize data from Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI).15 QWI is a publicly available data set and its underlying micro data comes from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program at the U.S. Census Bureau. Abowd et al. (2009) provides a detailed description of how QWI is constructed from LEHD. Different states agreed to share their unemployment insurance (UI) data with the LEHD program at different times. As a result, data coverage is uneven across states. For example, the data for California is available since the third quarter of 1991 while the data for Massachusetts only starts since the first quarter of 2010. Compared to QCEW, a main advantage of QWI is that it reports local labor market statistics at the county $\\times$ four-digit NAICS level by workers' characteristics (education, age, gender, race, and ethnicity). This allows us to examine whether and how workforce composition changes after S&P 500 index additions in a local labor market. Since QWI does not report statistics below the county $\\times4$ -digit NAICS level, this analysis includes both focal and nonfocal firms.  \n\nFor each local labor market in a quarter, we calculate workforce characteristics and then take the simple average of each characteristic across quarters in a year. Workforce characteristics in a local labor market include: (1) the share of workers with less formal education, no more than a high school degree; (2) the share of young workers whose ages are less than or equal to 35 years; (3) the share of workers female; (4) the share of workers who are not white; and (5) the share of Hispanic workers. We then merge these measures with the sample used in Figure V. Panel A of Table II reports the estimated average treatment effects of S&P 500 index additions on workforce characteristics in a local labor market.  \n\nThe results show that S&P 500 index additions change Workforce characteristics. The DiD anlaysis estimates that S&P 500 index additions lead to a 0.5 percentage points decrease in the share of workers with no more than high school (Column 1). Given that workers with less for mal education tend to earn less, this evidence is inconsistent with the argument that employee earnings effect of S&P 500 index additions could be explained by the shift of workforce toward less educated workers. In columns (2)-(4), we report the estimates on the shares of young, female, and non-white workers. Our estimates show that S&P 500 index additions increase the shares of young, female, and non-white workers by 0.6, 0.3 and 0.3 percentage points, respectively. Given that young, female, and non-white workers on average have lower earnings, these estimates suggest that changes in these workforce characteristics could explain part of the employee earnings effect of S&P 500 index additions. One caveat is that although these estimates are statistically significant, their economic magnitudes are small. Finally, S&P 500 index additions do not have any effect on the share of Hispanic workers (Column 5).  \n\nTo further assess the extent to which changes in workforce characteristics could explain employee earnings effect of S&P 500 index additions, we follow Curtis et al. (2021) and perform two more tests. First, we directly control for the endogenous workforce characteristics when estimating the average treatment effect of $\\mathrm{S\\&P500}$ index additions based on equation (Ill. .2). The results are reported in Panel B of Table I. Column (1) reports the baseline DiD estimate and we control for workforce characteristics in columns (2)—(6). The estimates in column (6) show that, after controlling for all workforce characteristics, the estimated coefficient on Treated $\\times$ Post is -0.009 and statistically significant at $1\\%$ level. The results suggest that $\\mathrm{S\\&P}500$ index additions lead to lower employee earnings in treated local labor markets conditional on workforce composition changes.  \n\nSecond, we perform an analysis based on Kitagawa (1955), Oaxaca (1973), and Blinders (1973) (the Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition) to directly measure the contribution of the change in each workforce characteristic to the change in employee earnings. The analysis involves three steps. First, for each local labor market, we estimate the marginal effect of a Workforce characteristic on the natural logarithm of employee earnings using data in the pretreatment period. Specifically, for treated local labor markets, we run the following regression:  \n\n$$\ny_{p(k)c i t}=\\beta^{t r e a t e d,p r e}\\times X_{p(k)c i t}+\\mu_{p(k)c i}+\\eta_{t}+\\epsilon_{p(k)c i t},\n$$  \n\nFor control local labor markets, we run the following regression:  \n\n$$\ny_{p(k)c i t}=\\beta^{c o n t r o l,p r e}\\times X_{p(k)c i t}+\\mu_{p(k)c i}+\\eta_{p(k)t}+\\epsilon_{p(k)c i t},\n$$  \n\nAs before, $c,i,$ and $t$ index for $\\mathrm{CZ},$ four-digit NAICS industry, and year, respectively. $p(k)$ indexes for a matched pair of a treated and control local labor markets in cohort $k$ $X_{p(k)i c t}$ isa vector including the shares of less educated, young, female, non-white, and Hispanic workers.  \n\nAfter estimating $\\hat{\\beta}^{t r e a t e d,p r e}$ and $\\hat{\\beta}^{c o n t r o l,p r e}.$ we then calculate the change in each workforce characteristic in treated and control local labor markets after S&P 500 index additions. We denote them as $\\Delta X^{t r e a t e d}$ and $\\Delta X^{c o n t r o l}$ respectively. Finally, the contributions of workforce characteristics changes to changes in employee earnings are calculated as below:  \n\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}^{t r e a t e d,p r e}\\times\\Delta X^{t r e a t e d}-\\hat{\\beta}^{c o n t r o l,p r e}\\times\\Delta X^{c o n t r o l}\n$$  \n\nTable II reports the results. Panel A reports the estimated marginal effects of workforce characteristics on the natural logarithm of employee earnings using pre-treatment data. Columns (1) and (2) report the results for treated and control local labor markets, respectively. Panel B reports the estimated contributions of workforce characteristics changes to changes in average earnings per employee. The first and second rows report the changes in workforce characteristics for treated and local labor markets, respectively. The third row reports the estimated contribution of the change in each workforce characteristic. Changes in the shares of less educated and Hispanic workers are predicted to increase employee earnings by 0.256 and 0.182 log points, respectively. Changes in the shares of young, female, and non-white workers account for 0.354, 0.093, and 0.106 log points of the decrease in employee earnings. Overall, changes in workforce characteristics account for $10.5\\%$ $(=(0.354+0.093+0.106-0.256-0.182)/1.1)$ of the changes in employee earnings after $\\mathrm{S\\&P}500$ index additions.  \n\n## III. D. Heterogeneity Effects by Labor Union Power  \n\nIn this subsection, we examine whether and how labor union power affects the impacts of S&P 500 index additions on employee earnings. If the employee earnings effect of S&P 500 index additions is driven by increases in employers' market power, then stronger labor union power in a local labor market could act as a countervailing force and the estimated effect on employee earnings is expected to be larger in local labor markets with lower union power before S&P 500 index additions.  \n\nTo measure union power at the local labor market level in a year, we rely on data from Current Population Survey (CPS) and estimate union coverage rate at the $\\mathrm{CZ}\\times$ NAICS sector level as a proxy.16 For each year, we first estimate union coverage rate at the State $\\times$ NAICS sector level weighted by CPS earner weights and then, for each $\\mathrm{CZ}\\times\\$ NAICS sector, union coverage rate is calculated as the average union coverage rates across State $\\times$ NAICS sector cells weighted by the population share of each state in the CZ.  \n\nFor each cohort of S&P 500 index additions, we split local labor markets into ones with high and low labor union power based on the median of pre-treatment mean of union coverage rates and estimate equations (II1. .1) and (II1. .2) for local labor markets with high and low pretreatment union coverage rates separately. We report the results in Figure VlI and Table A.4.  \n\nThe estimates are consistent with our expectations. Among local labor markets with low union coverage rates prior to S&P 500 index additions, the average annual earnings per employee of nonfocal firms in treated local labor markets is $1.8\\%$ lower compared to the one in control local labor markets. In contrast, among local labor markets with high union coverage rates prior to treatment, the estimated average treatment effect is close to zero and is not statistically significant. The difference between these two estimates is statistically significant at the $1\\%$ level.  \n\n## III. E. Effects on Total Employment  \n\nOur evidence so far shows that an increase in common ownership has a negative impact on average annual earnings per employee in a local labor market. We further show that only a small fraction of this effect can be explained by changes in workforce characteristics and the effect comes from local labor markets with low union coverage rates prior to treatment. This suggests that increased employer market power is more likely to be a driving force behind the results. However, it's not clear which model of employer market power the empirical findings best match.  \n\nThe classical monopsony model (Robinson, 1969) combines employer market power with an internal pay equity constraint. Under these conditions, a monopsonistic employer maximizes profits by paying workers less than the perfectly-competitive market wage (their marginal product) and employs fewer workers than they would in a competitive equilibrium. If common ownership effect operates along the lines of monopsonistic competition, then we would expect the negative wage effect to be accompanied by lower total employment in treated local labor markets relative to the counterfactual after $\\mathrm{S\\&P500}$ index additions.  \n\nIn other models, changes in employer market power could reduce employee earnings without suppressing the employment level. For example, Jarosch et al. (2021) builds a model based on the structure of a canonical search and bargain model but allows for a finite number of firms. As a result, it is possible for a worker to re-encounter past employers in the future. In the model, a firm is not a competitor of itself in the future, that is, workers' outside options do not include future vacancies of the firm. Therefore, workers' outside options are worse when bargaining with employers, especially when the distribution of employment is more concentrated, resulting in lower earnings. But their model does not predict \"underemployment\".  \n\nThe fact that different models of employer market power with the same prediction of negative wage effects have different predictions for employment levels motivates us to examine the effects of S&P 500 index additions on total employment of nonfocal firms in a local labor market. We estimate equation (II1. .1) by replacing the dependent variable as the natural logarithm of total employment. The results are reported in Figure VI and in Table A.9.  \n\nThe results show that the total employment of nonfocal firms increases after focal firms are added to the S&P 500 index. The trajectories of total employment between treated and control local labor markets are parallel before treatment. They only start to diverge after index addition events and the estimated effects increase over time. During the post-treatment period, nonfocal firms' total employment in treated local labor markets increases by $2.3\\%$ relative to the counterfactual.17  \n\nTo investigate whether the effect on total employment is driven by more new hires or less separations, we examine the effects of S&P 500 index additions on employment flows. Data on new hires and separations in a local labor market come from QWI. A worker is defined as a new hire for an employer in a quarter if the worker has positive earnings at the employer in the quarter but no earnings in any of the proceeding four consecutive quarters. A worker is defined as a separation from an employer in a quarter if the worker has positive earnings at the employer in the previous and current quarter but no earnings from the employer in the next quarter. In each year, we calculate the total new hires and total separations across four quarters. Hiring rate is defined as the ratio of total new hires in a year to the beginning-ofyear employment and separation rate is defined as the ratio of total separations in a year to the beginning-of-year employment. For both calculated ratios, we winsorize them at the 99 percentile to mitigate the effects of outliers.  \n\nWe then repeat the estimation procedure in Section I1. A. and additionally match on the changes in hiring and separation rates during pre-treatment period. The results are reported in Figure IX and Table A.10. The results first show that separation rates in treated local labor markets gradually increase relative to that in control local labor markets after $\\mathrm{S\\&P~}500$ index additions. By the end of fifth year after treatment, separation rates in treated local labor markets increase 0.7 percentage points relative to the counterfactual, representing a $1.3\\%$ increase relative to the average separation rate in treated local labor markets one year prior to treatment (53.7 percentage points). This result is consistent with the results that $\\mathrm{S\\&P500}$ index additions lead to a lower employee earnings in treated local labor markets relative to the counterfactual.  \n\nThe results in Figure IX further show that hiring rates of treated local labor markets increase even more after S&P 500 index additions. The estimates show that hiring rates of treated local labor markets increase 2.1 percentage points relative to the counterfactual by the end of fifth year after treatment, representing a $3.0\\%$ increase relative to the average hiring rate in treated local labor markets one year prior to treatment (69.4 percentage points).  \n\nOverall, we show that S&P 500 index additions lead to a higher total employment in treated local labor markets relative to the counterfactual. Further, this effect is consistent with more intensive recruiting activities and hiring by firms in treated local labor markets. Our evidence is not consistent with either classical monopsony model, which predicts a lower total employment in treated local labor markets, nor the model in Jarosch et al. (2021), which predicts that total employment in treated local labor markets does not change relative to control local labor markets.  \n\nTo rationalize the empirical findings on employee earnings, total employment, and hiring rates, we build a model in the next section that incorporates recruitment intensity in a classical oligoposny model with wage competition and differentiated jobs.  \n\n# IV. OLIGOPSONY WITH COMMON OWNERSHIP AND ENDOGENOUS RECRUITMENT INTENSITY  \n\nThere are at least two popular models of employer market power in the literature. The first one is the classical model of oligopsony with an upward-sloping labor supply curve. In this model, employee earnings and employment are tightly connected and the model predicts that a decline in wages necessarily implies a decline in employment. The second model is based on the canonical search and bargain model as in Jarosch et al. (2021). In this model, an increase in employer market power would reduce employee earnings without affecting the level of employment. The theoretical predictions from these two models are at odds with our empirical findings that common ownership reduces employee earnings but increases total employment in a local labor market.  \n\nIn this section, we develop a theoretical model that can rationalize our empirical findings. Specifically, we extend the classical model of oligopsony in two directions: (i) it has differentiated jobs and wage competition, as in Bhaskar et al. (2002), and (i) it incorporates a recruitment-intensity margin as in Manning (2006). With these additional features, our model shows that a higher common ownership in a labor market could lead to lower wages and a higher total employment in equilibrium.18  \n\nLet's consider a labor market with $J$ firms offering differentiated jobs. The market is an oligopsony and firms compete in wages. There is a continuum of workers of mass 1. Worker  \n\ni's utility from working at firm $j$ is,  \n\n$$\nu_{i j}=\\alpha\\log(w_{j})+\\epsilon_{i j},\n$$  \n\nwhere $w_{j}$ is the wage of firm $j^{\\prime}\\mathrm{s}$ jobs, and $\\epsilon_{i j}$ is a worker-firm match-specific shock. We assume that the match-specific shocks are independent and identically distributed, with a Type I extreme value distribution. A higher $\\alpha$ expresses a relatively more significant role for wages and a more minor role for non-wage job attributes between firms in governing worker utility, making jobs at different firms closer substitutes. This reduces firms' differentiation in jobs and market power as employers. $\\alpha$ is a key parameter that determines the impact of common ownership on total employment  \n\nFirms engage in informative advertising of their job openings. We model informative recruiting expenditures similarly to the model of informative product advertising in Butters (1977) and Hamilton (2009). A worker observes the job posting of firm $j$ with probability $\\phi_{j}$ Among all the job postings that the worker observes, she chooses the one that offers the highest utility. It is possible that the worker observes zero job postings. Therefore, there can be frictional unemployment for this reason, even there is no outside option in the model.1 $^9\\mathrm{Firm}j$ chooses its recruitment intensity $\\phi_{j}$ given a cost function $a(\\phi_{j})=-\\theta\\log(1-\\phi_{j})$ . Recruitment cost is zero when $\\phi_{j}=0.$ , and approaches to infinity as $\\phi_{j}$ is close to one. $a(\\phi_{j})$ is convex, so that there is an increasing marginal cost of increasing recruitment intensity.20 Manning (2006) provides evidence supporting this assumption. If there were no recruiting costs $(\\theta=0)$ , all firms would advertise job postings to all workers and there would be no frictional unemployment. As recruiting cost increases, employer competition would weaken and the employment rate could fall as a consequece.  \n\nWe will focus on finding symmetric equilibria. For this purpose, it is useful to calculate the probability that firm $j$ faces $k$ rivals for a given worker who is informed about its job posting, when each of its symmetric rival sets its recruitment intensity to $\\phi_{-j}$ . When there are $J-1$ rival firms, such a probability is given by the binomial distribution:  \n\n$$\np(k;\\phi_{-j},J-1)=\\binom{J-1}{k}\\phi_{-j}^{k}(1-\\phi_{-j})^{J-1-k}.\n$$  \n\nFor a given set of chosen wages and recruitment intensities by firm $j$ and each of its rival, $\\{w_{j},w_{-j},\\phi_{j},\\phi_{-j}\\},$ the employment share of firm $j$ among all potential workers in the labor  \n\nmarket (including the unemployed) is given by  \n\n$$\ns_{j}(w_{j},w_{-j},\\phi_{j},\\phi_{-j})=\\phi_{j}\\sum_{k=0}^{J-1}p(k;\\phi_{-j},J-1)s_{j}^{(k)}(w_{j};w_{-j}),\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\ns_{j}^{(k)}(w_{j};w_{-j})={\\frac{\\exp(\\alpha\\log(w_{j}))}{\\exp\\left[\\alpha\\log(w_{j})\\right]+k\\exp\\left[\\alpha\\log(w_{-j})\\right]}}\n$$  \n\nis the market share of firm $j$ among the workers that are informed about the job postings of firm $j$ and its $k$ rivals.  \n\nThe intuition of equation (IV. .2) is the following. When firm $j$ sets its recruitment intensity to be $\\phi_{j},$ a measure of workers of that size are informed about its job posting. Among these $\\phi_{j}$ workers, $p(k;\\phi_{-j},J-1)$ of them also observe the job postings of firm $j^{\\prime}{\\bf s}k$ rivals. Among the Workers that observe $k$ rivals' job postings, firm $j^{\\prime}\\mathrm{s}$ market share is given by the multinomial logit market share s( $s_{j}^{(k)}(w_{j};w_{-j})$  \n\nThe employment share of a firm $j^{\\prime}$ s rival among all potential workers in the labor market is given by  \n\n$$\ns_{-j}(w_{j},w_{-j},\\phi_{j},\\phi_{-j})=\\phi_{-j}\\sum_{k=0}^{J-2}p(k;\\phi_{-j},J-2)\\left[\\phi_{j}s_{-j}^{(k+1)}+\\frac{1-\\phi_{j}}{k+1}\\right],\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\ns_{-j}^{(k)}(w_{j},w_{-j})=\\frac{\\exp(\\alpha\\log(w_{-j}))}{\\exp\\left[\\alpha\\log(w_{j})\\right]+k\\exp\\left[\\alpha\\log(w_{-j})\\right]}\n$$  \n\nis the market share of firm $-j$ among the workers that are informed about the job postings of firm $j$ and firm $-j^{\\prime}{\\bf s}k$ rivals. There are two terms in the bracket in equation (IV. .4) and the interpretation is the following. With a probability of $\\phi_{j},$ a worker that is informed about the job postings of firm $-j$ and its $k$ rivals could also observe firm $j^{\\prime}$ s job posting. In this case, firm $-j^{\\prime}\\mathbf{s}$ market share is given by $s_{-j}^{(k)}(w_{j},w_{-j}).$ with a probability of $1-\\phi_{j},$ a worker that is informed about the job postings of firm $-j$ and its $k$ rivals does not observe firm $j^{\\prime}\\mathrm{s}$ job posting. In this case, firm $-j^{\\prime}$ s market share is simply $1/(k+1)$  \n\nFor a given set of chosen wages and recruitment intensities by firm $j$ and each of its rival, $\\{w_{j},w_{-j},\\phi_{j},\\phi_{-j}\\},$ the profit of firm $j$ is given by  \n\n$$\n\\pi_{j}(w_{j},w_{-j},\\phi_{j},\\phi_{-j})=(A-w_{j})s_{j}(w_{j},w_{-j},\\phi_{j},\\phi_{-j})-a(\\phi_{j}),\n$$  \n\nwhere $A$ is the additional revenue for firm $j$ from hiring another worker, which we assume is symmetric across firms.  \n\nWhen there is common ownership in the labor market, that is, firms are connected via common owners, firm $j$ would partially internalize the profits of its rivals. We incorporate this idea into our model by assuming that firm $j$ chooses its wages, $w_{j},$ and recruitment intenstiy, $\\phi_{j},$ to maximize its profit plus a weight $\\lambda$ times the profits of its rivals in the labor market, taking the choices of $\\{w_{-j},\\phi_{-j}\\}$ by its rivals as given:  \n\n$$\n-w_{j})s_{j}(w_{j},w_{-j},\\phi_{j},\\phi_{-j})-a(\\phi_{j})+\\lambda\\cdot(J-1)\\left[\\left(A-w_{-j}\\right)s_{-j}(w_{j},w_{-j},\\phi_{j},\\phi_{-j})-a(\\phi_{j})+\\lambda\\cdot(J-1)\\left(A-w_{-j}\\right)\\right],\n$$  \n\nThe first-order condition for firm $j$ With respect to its wage is,  \n\n$$\n-s_{j}+(A-w_{j})\\frac{\\partial s_{j}}{\\partial w_{j}}+\\lambda\\cdot\\left[(J-1)\\big(A-w_{-j}\\big)\\frac{\\partial s_{-j}}{\\partial w_{j}}\\right]=0,\n$$  \n\nwhere the market share slopes with respect to firm $j^{\\prime}$ s wage are  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial s_{j}}{\\partial w_{j}}=\\frac{\\alpha}{w_{j}}\\phi_{j}\\sum_{k=0}^{J-1}p(k;\\phi_{-j},J-1)s_{j}^{(k)}(1-s_{j}^{(k)})\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial s_{-j}}{\\partial w_{j}}=-\\frac{\\alpha}{w_{j}}\\phi_{-j}\\phi_{j}\\sum_{k=0}^{J-2}p(k;\\phi_{-j},J-2)s_{-j}^{(k+1)}s_{j}^{(k+1)}.\n$$  \n\nIntuitively, an increase in its wages by one dollar has two opposing effects on firm $j^{\\prime}$ s profits. On one hand, it reduces its profits per worker by one dollar, and this reduces overall profits by its market share $s_{j}$ . This is captured in the first term of equation (IV. .7). On the other hand, increasing wages would increase fimn $j^{\\prime}$ s market share by $\\frac{\\partial s_{j}}{\\partial w_{j}},$ and this increases its pofts because the margin $A-w_{j}$ is applied to more workers. This is captured in the second term of equation (IV. .7). With common ownership, firm $j$ internalizes the fact that some of this increase in its market share comes at the expense of its rivals, whose profits firm $j$ internalizes at a rate $\\lambda$ . This is what drives the third term of equation (IV. .7). This last term, ceteris paribus, implies that an increase in common ownership reduces firm $j^{\\prime}$ s incentive to increase wages.  \n\nThe first-order condition for firm $j$ with respect to its own recruiting effort is,  \n\n$$\n(A-w_{j})\\frac{\\partial s_{j}}{\\partial\\phi_{j}}-\\theta/(1-\\phi_{j})+\\lambda\\cdot\\left[(J-1)\\left(A-w_{-j}\\right)\\frac{\\partial s_{-j}}{\\partial\\phi_{j}}\\right]=0,\n$$  \n\nwhere the market share slopes with respect to firm $j^{\\prime}\\mathrm{s}$ recruitment intensity are  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial s_{j}}{\\partial\\phi_{j}}=s_{j}/\\phi_{j}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial s_{-j}}{\\partial\\phi_{j}}=\\phi_{-j}\\sum_{k=0}^{J-2}p(k;\\phi_{-j},J-2)\\left[s_{-j}^{(k+1)}-\\frac{1}{k+1}\\right].\n$$  \n\nThe intuition is as follows. Increasing its recruitment intensity has opposing effects on firm $j^{\\prime}\\mathrm{s}$ profits. An increase in its recruitment intensity would increase firm $j^{\\prime}$ S market share by $\\frac{\\partial s_{j}}{\\partial\\phi_{j}},$ and this increases profits because the margin $A-w_{j}$ is applied to more workers. This is captured in the first term of equation (IV. .10). But increasing recruitment intensity is costly and the marginal cost is reflected in the second term of equation (IV. .10).  \n\nCommon ownership makes firm $j$ internalize the fact that, when it increases recruitment intensity, some of its increase in market share comes at the expense of its rivals. As in the firstorder condition for wages (equation (IV. .7), firm $j$ internalizes its rivals' profits at a rate $\\lambda$ This is captured by the third term of equation (IV. .10). Ceteris paribus, this would imply that higher common ownership would reduce firm $j^{\\prime}$ s incentive to increase recruitment intensity. However, if common ownership drives down wages in equilibrium, then it increases the first term of equation (IV. .10), implying that each additional worker that firm $j$ hires is more profitable. This would increase firm $j^{\\prime}$ s incentive to increase its recruitment intensity. These two conflicting economic forces are the reason why, as we will see in the numerical simulations, the effect of common ownership on employment could be positive or negative, depending on the parameters.  \n\nWe solve the model numerically by finding the solution to the two non-linear equations obtained by imposing symmetry, that is, seting $w_{j}=w_{-j}=w$ and $\\phi_{j}=\\phi_{-j}=\\phi$ in the first-order conditions.  \n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}{(A-w)\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial s_{j}}{\\partial w_{j}}+\\lambda(J-1)\\frac{\\partial s_{-j}}{\\partial w_{j}}\\right\\}=(1-(1-\\phi)^{J})/J}\\ {(A-w)\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial s_{j}}{\\partial\\phi_{j}}+\\lambda(J-1)\\frac{\\partial s_{-j}}{\\partial\\phi_{j}}\\right\\}=\\theta/(1-\\phi)}\\end{array}\\right.,\n$$  \n\nwhere all the market share slopes are evaluated at the symmetric wage and recruitment intensity values $(w_{j}=w_{-j}=w$ and $\\phi_{j}=\\phi_{-j}=\\phi $  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\frac{\\partial s_{j}}{\\partial w_{j}}=\\frac{\\alpha}{w}\\phi\\sum_{k=0}^{J-1}p(k;\\phi,J-1)\\frac{k}{(k+1)^{2}}}\\ {\\frac{\\partial s_{-j}}{\\partial w_{j}}=-\\frac{\\alpha}{w}\\phi^{2}\\sum_{k=0}^{J-2}p(k;\\phi,J-2)\\frac{1}{(k+2)^{2}}}\\ {\\frac{\\partial s_{j}}{\\partial\\phi_{j}}=\\frac{1-(1-\\phi)^{J}}{\\phi J}}\\ {\\frac{\\partial s_{-j}}{\\partial\\phi_{j}}=\\phi\\sum_{k=0}^{J-2}p(k;\\phi,J-2)\\left[\\frac{1}{k+2}-\\frac{1}{k+1}\\right]}\\end{array}.\n$$  \n\nIn equilibrium, the total employment in a labor market is equal to $1-(1-\\phi)^{J}$ .Therefore, the effect of common ownership on recruitment intensity and total employment would be qualitatively the same.  \n\nWe set the number of firm $J$ to be 20 and marginal product of labor $A$ to be 1 (as a normalization) when solving the model. We report the results in Figure $\\mathsf{X}.$ In the left panel, we examine how the impacts of common ownership on wages, recruitment intensity, and employment vary with the wage sensitivity parameter $\\alpha$ . In this panel, we set the cost of recruitment intensity $\\theta{=}0.3$ . In the right panel, we examine how the impacts of common ownership on wages, recruitment intensity, and employment vary with $\\theta$ that governs recruiting cost. In this panel, we set the wage sensitivity parameter $\\alpha{=}3$  \n\nAs can be seen in Figure $\\mathsf{X},$ an increase in common ownership always reduces equilibrium Wages but its impact on recruitment intensity or total employment depends on $\\alpha$ or $\\theta$ . In this example, common ownership generates an increase in employment when the wage sensitivity parameter $\\alpha$ or the cost of recruitment intensity parameter $\\theta$ is relatively high, and common ownership generates a decrease in employment when $\\alpha$ or $\\theta$ is relatively low.  \n\nAs we discussed earlier, the intuition for the ambiguous effect of common ownership on employment is the following. A higher common ownership implies that a firm would internalize more the effect of an increased recruitment intensity on its rivals' profits, because some of the extra recruited workers could have otherwise been employed by firms that share common owners. This effect implies that a higher common ownership would tend to reduce equilibrium recruitment intensity. However, a higher common ownership also reduces equilibrium Wages, increasing the profits per worker that the firms receive. These higher profits per job increase a firm's incentive to recruit more workers in equilibrium, at least when these workers are more likely to be recruited from the unemployed. When the later \"profit-per-worker\" effect dominates, the net effect of common ownership on equilibrium employment could be positive.  \n\nThe positive effect of common ownership on employment is more likely to happen when equilibrium employment is lower without common ownership, because then recruited workers are more likely not coming from rival firms. A higher wage-sensitivity parameter $\\alpha$ implies that firms are closer substitutes, resulting in higher equilibrium wages. In this model, higher wages imply that profits per worker are lower and a firm has less incentive to spend resources on advertising their job openings. As a result, equilibrium employment would be lower when there is no common ownership. Similarly, when the recruitment cost parameter $\\theta$ is higher, a firm has less incentive to spend on recruitment, leading to a lower equilibrium employment when common ownership is zero. Therefore, when $\\alpha$ Or $\\theta$ is higher, a higher common ownership could increase a firm's incentive to spend resources on recruitment because newly recruited workers more likely come from the unemployed and it comes less at the expense of its rival firms.  \n\n# V. CONCLUSION  \n\nIn this paper, we contribute to the literature on employer market power by measuring common ownership at the local labor market level, and providing the first empirical evidence on the effects of common ownership on local labor market outcomes. We explore natural experiments generated by firms' additions to the S&P 500 index and use a difference-in-differences design to estimate causal effects. Our results suggest that the average annual earnings per employee among nonfocal firms in treated local labor markets are lower compared to the counterfactual after focal firms enter the S&P 500 index. As one would expect, this effect is larger in markets where the ex ante employment shares of S&P 500 firms were higher. Further analyses show that the effect comes from local labor markets with low union coverage rates prior to treatment and is not driven by changes in workforce characteristics after S&P 500 index additions.  \n\nWe also find that S&P 500 index additions lead to an increase in total employment in treated local labor markets. Such an effect is driven by an increase in hiring rates relative to separation rates. We show that, while this is inconsistent with existing models of employer market power, it can be rationalized through a model of oligopsony with endogenous recruitment intensity.  \n\nThe policy implications of anticompetitive effects of common ownership in labor markets are complex. Legal scholars have mostly analyzed the antitrust implications of horizontal shareholding in product markets (Elhauge, 2015; Baker, 2015; Posner et al., 2017; Rock and Rubinfeld, 2020; Posner, 2021), as well as labor market power (Marinescu and Hovenkamp, 2019; Krueger and Posner, 2018; Naidu and Posner, 2021). Evaluating the competitive effects of common ownership in labor markets will require a combination of insights from these two literatures. One potential approach would be tackling the issue directly by breaking up large common owners. However, it is important to take into account that there are substantial tradeoffs from a social point of view, as low-cost index funds provide substantial cost savings for retail investors compared to more expensive actively managed funds.  \n\nUNIVERSITY OF NAVARRA, TEMPLE UNIVERSITY, AND W. E. UPJOHN INSTITUTE FOR EMPLOYMENTRESEARCH  \n\n# APPENDIX  \n\n## A. PANEL REGRESSIONS  \n\nIn this subsection, we use OLS and 2SLS panel regressions to estimate the relation betweer common ownership and annual earnings per employee at the local labor market level. Section A. A. introduces empirical specifications and Section A. B. reports OLS and 2SLS estimation results.  \n\n### A.A. Empirical Specification  \n\nTo construct the sample for panel regressions, we merge QCEW data with one-year lagged common ownership and institutional ownership data at the local labor market level. There are 100,332 local labor markets with 707 CZs and 303 four-digit NAICS industries.21 Dollars are inflated to 2019. Table A.11 reports the summary statistics of the variables in the empirical analysis. Across local labor markets and years, the average annual earnings per employee is $\\$42,805$ and the average employment in a local labor market is 1,276. The average common ownership across local labor market-years is 1.4 percentage points. The average local total IO and top five IO are 8.4 and 3.2 percentage points, respectively.  \n\nWe start with OLS panel regressions and study how changes in common ownership relate to changes in annual earnings per employee in a local labor market by including local labor market and year fixed effects. Specifically, we estimate the following equation:  \n\n$$\ny_{c i,t}=\\alpha\\lambda_{c i,t-1}+\\beta X_{c i,t-1}+\\gamma_{c i}+\\delta_{t}+\\varepsilon_{c i,t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $c,i,$ and $t$ index for $\\mathbf{CZ},$ four-digit NAICS industry, and year, respectively. $y_{c i,t}$ is the natural logarithm of annual earnings per employee in local labor market (c,i) in year t. $\\lambda_{c i,t-1}$ is common ownership in a local labor market ci in year t-1. $X_{c i,t-1}$ is a vector of control variables in a local labor market $c i$ measured at year t-1. Specifically, we follow Falato et al. (2021) and control for the average total institutional ownership (IO) and the average ownership of the largest five institutional investors $(I O^{T o p5})$ at the local labor market level. The variable $\\gamma_{c i}$ represents local labor market fixed effects, which helps to control for any time-invariant unobserved characteristics at the local labor market level. The variable $\\delta_{t}$ represents year fixed effects, which helps to control for any time-varying shocks at the national level. Unless otherwise stated, observations are unweighted and standard errors are clustered at the local labor  \n\nmarket level.  \n\nIn the first specification, we only include local labor market and year fixed effects. We then further control for the average total and top 5 institutional ownership in a local labor market. Finally, we run a third specification that further controls for $\\mathrm{CZ}\\times$ year fixed effects which absorb any shock at the CZ level in a given year.  \n\nIdentification assumptions of OLS include a linear functional form, constant treatment effect, and that changes in unobserved characteristics are mean independent of changes in local common ownership conditional on the vector of control variables and fixed effects, that is,  \n\n$$\nE[\\varepsilon_{c i,t}|\\lambda_{c i,t-1},X_{c i,t-1},1_{c i},1_{t}]=E[\\varepsilon_{c i,t}|X_{c i,t-1},1_{c i},1_{t}]=0\n$$  \n\nThese identification assumptions of OLS could fail and then our estimates would be biased. However, the direction of bias is not clear ex ante. On one hand, our estimate could be biased downward. For instance, if a local labor market experiences a negative shock to labor productivity, then employee earnings would decrease. At the same time, it might induce exits of some privately-held firms. This would drive up the measure of local common ownership, resulting in a downward bias of the OLS estimate. On the other hand, our estimate could be biased upward. If a publicly traded firm in a local labor market experiences a shock to firm-specific productivity and decides to acquire some private-held firms in the market. This increased firm-level productivity could drive up both employee earnings and local common ownership simultaneously, resulting in an upward bias of the OLS estimate.  \n\nTo mitigate the above-mentioned endogeneity concerns, we also use an instrumental variables (IV) strategy and implement it using two-stage least squares (2SLS). The construction of the IV for local common ownership follows Azar et al. (2020). Specifically, our IV for common oWnership in a local labor market in a given year is the average of the equally-weighted local common ownership for the same industry in other CZs. Our use of equally-weighted average of common ownership ensures that our instrument only uses information on ownership, and no information on endogenous employment shares. The main identification assumption in our IV analysis is that ownership itself is exogenous, which is commonly assumed in the structural common ownership literature (see, for example, Backus et al., 2021a; Ruiz-Pérez, 2019).  \n\nWe again index CZ and four-digit NAICS industry by $c$ and $i,$ respectively, and denote the number of CZs in a year t as $N_{t}$ . The IV for local common ownership can then be expressed as follows. The IVs for local total institutional ownership and top five institutional ownership are defined analogously.  \n\n$$\n\\lambda_{i c,t}^{I V}=\\frac{1}{N_{t}-1}\\sum_{c^{\\prime}\\neq c}\\lambda_{c^{\\prime}i,t}^{E q u a l l y-w e i g h t e d}\n$$  \n\nThis IV purges of any idiosyncratic variation in local common ownership and focuses on the part of variation that is related to nation-wide common ownership change. In the labor productivity shock example above, our IV would exclude changes in local common ownership induced by unobserved local shocks in OLS. Studies commonly use this type of leave-thismarket-out instrument to deal with endogeniety of local prices (Nevo, 2001).  \n\nHowever, the estimated results based on this IV strategy should be interpreted carefully. The main threat to the identification of this IV strategy is that, for a given industry, the local shocks driving changes in both employee earnings and local common ownership could be correlated across CZs. For example, suppose that an industry experiences a negative shock that decreases employee earnings across the nation and also leads some privately-held firms to exit in some CZs. Mechanically, this shock would induce an increase in the equally-weighted version of local common ownership measure in these local labor markets and the exclusion restriction could be violated. As a result, this type of IV cannot protect against industry-level shocks that could affect both firm entry or exit decisions and labor market outcomes at the local labor market level.  \n\n### A.B. Estimation Results  \n\nWe report the estimated effects of common ownership on annual earnings per employee in Table A.12. Columns (1)-(3) report OLS estimates. In column (1), we only include local labor market and year fixed effects. The estimated coefficient on Common Ownership is -0.04 and is statistically significant at $1\\%$ level. The estimated effect implies that a one-standarddeviation increase in local common ownership (0.067) is associated with a $0.27\\%$ $(=0.067^{*}–0.04)$ decrease in annual earnings per employee. This is $\\$116$ per year given the sample mean of $\\$42,805$ . In column (2), we control for average total institutional ownership and average top five institutional ownership at the local labor market level. The result is robust and the estimated coefficient becomes to -0.05. In column (3), we further control for $\\mathrm{CZ}\\times$ year fixed effects to control for any shock at the CZ level in a year. The result is robust and the estimated coefficient is -0.047.  \n\nColumns (4)-(6) report 2SLS estimates. Across all the columns, the first stage KleibergenPaap F-statistic is large, suggesting our instrumental variable is strong. The magnitudes of the estimated common ownership effects are larger than the ones from OLS. Based on the estimates in column (6), our results show that a one-standard-deviation increase in local common ownership is associated with a $1.21\\%$ $\\stackrel{\\prime}{=}0.067^{*}.$ -0.181) decrease in annual wages per employee, or $\\$518$ per year.  \n\n# REFERENCES  \n\nAbowd, John M., Bryce E.

The capital share, equal to the ratio of capital costs and gross value added, does not offset the decline in the labor share. Instead, a large increase in the share of pure profits offsets declines in the shares of both labor and capital. Industry data show that increases in concentration are associated with declines in the labor share.  \n\nSINCE THE EARLY 198Os WE HAVE witnessed a large decline in the labor share of gross value added (Elsby, Hobijn, and Sahin (2013), Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014)). Many existing explanations for the decline in the labor share, such as technological change, mechanization, capital accumulation, and a change in the relative price of capital, focus on tradeoffs between labor and physical capital. These explanations argue that firms have substituted expenditures on labor inputs into production with expenditures on physical capital inputs into production and each of these explanations offers a different rationale for this substitution. In this paper, I show that the shares of both labor and capital are declining and are jointly offset by a large increase in the share of pure profits.  \n\nIn this paper, I draw a distinction between capital costs and pure profits and show that this distinction is critical for understanding the decline in the labor share. Capital costs are the annual costs of using all capital inputs in production. In a world in which frms lease all of their capital inputs, constructing capital costs would be simple: we would sum all annual leasing expenses. Pure profits are what a firm earns in excess of all production costs (material inputs, labor costs, and capital costs). Firms that use a lot of expensive equipment have high capital costs. Firms that charge consumers high prices relative to the cost of production have high pure profits. An increase in the capital share, equal to the ratio of capital costs to gross value added, at the expense of the labor share is indicative of a substitution from labor to capital inputs into production. By contrast, an increase in the pure profit share, equal to the ratio of pure profits to gross value added, is indicative of an increase in market power and a decline in competition.  \n\nMeasuring capital costs presents an empirical challenge. Most of the physical capital stock is owned by firms rather than leased. When firms own physical capital, they do not report an annual line item that approximates annual leasing costs and these costs cannot be backed out from accounting measures of profits. Moreover, there are forms of productive capital that are not physical, such as software, research and development (R&D), and product designs. These forms of intangible capital are at times firm-specific and therefore cannot easily be leased. To overcome these challenges, for each type of capital, I compute a required rate of return, which approximates the annual leasing cost of one dollar's worth of this type of capital. This approach is grounded in economic theory, supported by past research, and is similar to approximating a wage bill for an unincorporated business. Given a required rate of return, it is straightforward to aggregate across the various types of capital to come up with an aggregate measure of capital costs.  \n\nFollowing Hall and Jorgenson (1967), I compute a series of capital costs for the U.S. nonfinancial corporate sector over the period 1984 to 2014, equal to the product of the required rate of return on capital and the value of the capital stock. The required rate of return is a function of the cost of borrowing in financial markets (henceforth, cost of capital), depreciation rates, expected price infation of capital, and the tax treatment of both capital and debt. In simplified models, this required rate of return is the familiar $r+\\delta$ .Overthis time period, the cost of capital shows a large decline and tracks the decline in the risk-free rate. At the same time, measures of expected and realized inflation show no trend. The required rate of return on capital declines sharply, due to the large decline in the cost of capital.  \n\nThe large decline in the required rate of return does not necessarily imply a decline in the capital share. In a typical model of firm production, firms respond to the decline in the required rate of return by increasing their use of capital inputs. If firms respond strongly enough, the increase in capital inputs is larger than the decline in the required rate of return, and as a result, the capital share increases. Indeed, this is the common prediction of all the explanations for the decline in the labor share that focus on trade-offs between labor and physical capital.  \n\nHowever, the U.S. nonfinancial corporate sector does not sufficiently increase its use of capital inputs to offset the decline in the required rate of return, and as a result, the capital share declines. The decline in the risk-free rate and the lack of capital accumulation have been noted by Furman and Orszag (2015). Measured in percentage terms, the decline in the capital share $(22\\%)$ is much more dramatic than the decline in the labor share $(11\\%)$ . Back in 1984, every dollar of labor costs was accompanied by approximately $49\\phi$ of capital costs. By 2014, a dollar of labor costs was accompanied by only $42\\phi$ of capital costs. Thus, despite the decline in the labor share, labor costs have increased faster than capital costs.  \n\nAs a share of gross value added, since the early 1980s, firms have reduced both labor and capital costs and increased pure profits. Consistent with earlier research, I find that pure profits were very small in the early 1980s. However, pure profits have increased dramatically since the early 1980s. In the main specification, the pure profit share (equal to the ratio of pure profits to gross value added) increases by 13.5 percentage points (pp). To offer a sense of the magnitude, the value of this increase in pure profits amounts to over $\\$1.2$ trillion in 2014,or $\\$14.6$ thousand for each of the approximately 81 million employees of the nonfinancial corporate sector.  \n\nOne concern with the measurement of capital costs and pure profits is the possibility of omitted or unobserved capital. Past research has considered several forms of intangible capital that are not currently capitalized by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and has argued that these are important for explaining asset valuations and cash fows. The inclusion of additional capital likely increases the capital share and decreases the pure profit share. At the same time, the effects of including additional capital on the time trends of the capital and pure profit shares are less clear. The large decline in the cost of capital equally affects the required rate of return on any additional form of capital. As a result, if this additional capital grows only at the rate of output, then the additional capital costs will grow far slower than output. Thus, in order for this additional capital to have a mitigating effect on the measured trends of the shares of capital and pure profits, the stock of additional capital would need to grow significantly faster than output.  \n\nI take two approaches to assessing the contribution of omitted intangible capital to the measured increase in pure profits. First, I incorporate the most comprehensive existing measures of omitted intangible capital into the analysis. Second, I construct a large number of scenarios for omitted intangible capital. Each scenario is a parameterization of investment, depreciation, and capital inflation of intangible capital. For each scenario, I compute capital costs and pure profits that fully incorporate the unobserved investment. I find that existing measures of intangible capital are unable to explain the increase in pure profits. Of the large number of scenarios that I consider, none can fully account for the increase in pure profits. There are scenarios that can account for most of the increase in pure profits, but in all such scenarios, the value of missing intangible capital in 2014 would need to be much larger than all capital measured by the BEA (structures, equipment, and intellectual propertyproducts $\\mathrm{[IPPs]}.$  \n\nAn increase in the importance of omitted intangible capital and an increase in pure profits are not mutually exclusive. Of the many scenarios of omitted intangible capital that I consider, many feature a simultaneous increase in intangible capital and a large increase in pure profits. In this sense, the measured increase in pure profits is consistent with many scenarios that feature rapidly increasing intangible capital.  \n\nI provide reduced-form empirical evidence that a decline in competition and an increase in pure profits have played a significant role in the decline in the labor share. I show that those industries that experience a larger increase in concentration also experience a larger decline in the labor share. Based on the estimated correlations and the observed increase in industry concentration, the predicted decline in the labor share is of the same magnitude as the observed decline in the labor share. In this sense, the increase in industry concentration can account for most of the decline in the labor share. These results complement the aggregate findings, as (i) they rely on cross-sectional rather than time-series variation, and (ii) they do not rely on capital data and therefore are not subject to concerns about the measurement of capital. Taken as a whole, my results suggest that the decline in the shares of labor and capital are due to a decline in competition.  \n\nThe remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section I presents a basic framework for measuring capital costs and pure profits. Section II describes the data. Section IHI presents the main results. Section IV presents evidence on the robustness of the results. Section V presents cross-sectional industry correlations between increases in concentration and declines in the labor share. Section VI provides a discussion of the results and a review of the related literature. Section VII concludes.  \n\nInternet Appendix Section I presents a standard general equilibrium model with monopolistic competition to study the declines in the shares of labor and capital.1 Internet Appendix Section II presents a model of monopolistic competition with quadratic adjustment costs to assess the potential contribution of adjustment costs to the measured trends in the labor share, capital share, and pure profit share.  \n\n## 1. Basic Framework  \n\nThis section presents the construction of capital costs and pure profits. Following Hall and Jorgenson (1967), capital costs are denoted by $R P^{K}K$ and are equal to the product of the required rate of return on capital and the value of the capital stock. Pure profits are denoted by I and are equal to gross value added less the sum of compensation of employees, capital costs, and indirect taxes.  \n\n### A. Capital Costs: By Asset  \n\nGiven an asset-specific specification of the required rate of return, $R_{s}$ ， capital costs for capital of type s are  \n\n$$\nE_{s}=R_{s}P_{s}^{K}K_{s},\n$$  \n\nwhere $K_{s}$ is the quantity of capital of type s, $P_{s}^{K}$ is the price of capital of type $s$ ,and $P_{s}^{K}K_{s}$ is the nominal value of the stock of capital of type s. Note that capital costs are measured in nominal dollars.  \n\nFollowing Hall and Jorgenson (1967), the required rate of return on capital of type s is2  \n\n$$\nR_{s}=\\left(\\left(\\frac{D}{D+E}i^{D}(1-\\tau)+\\frac{E}{D+E}i^{E}\\right)-\\mathbb{E}[\\pi_{s}]+\\delta_{s}\\right)\\frac{1-z_{s}\\tau}{1-\\tau},\n$$  \n\nwhere $D$ is the market value of debt, $i^{D}$ is the debt cost of capital, $E$ is the market value of equity, $i^{E}$ is the equity cost of capital, $\\tau$ is the corporate income tax rate, $\\begin{array}{r}{(\\frac{D}{D+E}i^{D}(\\Bar{1}-\\tau)+\\frac{E}{D+E}i^{E})}\\end{array}$ istheweigted average cost of capital $\\pi_{s}$ the inflation rate of capital of type s, $\\delta_{s}$ is the depreciation rate of capital of type $s$ , and $z_{s}$ is the net present value of depreciation allowances for capital of type $s$ . This required rate of return accounts for both debt and equity financing as well as the tax treatment of debt and capital.3 Unlike compensation of employees, firms are unable to fully expense investment in capital, and as a result, the corporate tax rate increases the firm's capital costs.  \n\n### B. Capital Costs: Aggregation  \n\nAggregate capital costs are the sum of the asset-specific capital costs  \n\n$$\nE=\\sum_{s}R_{s}P_{s}^{K}K_{s}.\n$$  \n\nWe can decompose aggregate capital costs into an aggregate required rate of return on capital and the nominal value of the capital stock:  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{s}R_{s}P_{s}^{K}K_{s}=\\underbrace{\\sum_{s}\\frac{P_{s}^{K}K_{s}}{\\sum_{j}P_{j}^{K}K_{j}}R_{s}}_{R}\\times\\underbrace{\\sum_{s}P_{s}^{K}K_{s}}_{P^{K}K_{S}}.\n$$  \n\n2 Negative values of the required rate of return on capital can and do appear in the data. There are periods in which the cost of capital is low and expected capital inflation is sufficiently high so that the required rate of return is negative. This occurs for real estate (valued at market prices) in part of the 2000s when we calculate expected capital inflation as a three-year moving average of realized capital inflation. I set the negative required rate of return to zero. All results are robust to allowing for negative required rates of return.  \n\n3 For the tax treatment of capital and debt, see Hall and Jorgenson (1967), King and Fullerton (1984), Jorgenson and Yun (1991), and Gilchrist and Zakrajsek (2007). Past research has included an investment tax credit in the calculation of the required rate of return on capital; the investment tax credit expired in 1986. The results are robust to including the investment tax credit.  \n\nThe first term is the weighted average of the asset-specific required rates of return, where the weight on asset s is proportional to the nominal value of the stock of capital of type $s$ . The second term is the nominal value of the aggregate capital stock. The capital share of gross value added is  \n\n$$\nS^{K}=\\frac{\\underset{s}{\\sum}R_{s}P_{s}^{K}K_{s}}{P^{Y}Y},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\sum_{s}R_{s}P_{s}^{K}K_{s}$ are aggregate capital costs and $P^{Y}Y$ is nominal gross value added.  \n\n### C. Pure Profits  \n\nPure profits are constructed as4  \n\n$$\n\\Pi=P^{Y}Y-w L-R P^{K}K-\\mathrm{indirecttaxes},\n$$  \n\nwhere $P^{Y}Y$ is nominal gross value added, wL is compensation of employees, and $R P^{K}K$ are capital costs. The pure profit share of gross value added is  \n\n$$\nS^{\\Pi}=\\frac{\\Pi}{P^{Y}Y}.\n$$  \n\nExample: To clarify the terminology and units, consider a firm that uses 2,000 square feet of office space and 100 laptops. The sale value of the office space is $\\$880,000$ at the start of the year. If the required rate of return on the office space is $5\\%$ , then the capital costs of the office space are $\\$44,000$ $\\$880,000$ (or $\\$22$ per square foot). The sale value of the 100 laptops is $\\$70,000$ at the start of the year. If the required rate of return on the laptops is $41\\%$ then capital costs of the laptops are $\\$28,700=0.41\\times\\$10,000$ (or $\\$287$ per laptop). Aggregate capital costs are $\\$72,700$ and the value of the aggregate capital stock is $\\$950,000$ . The aggregate required rate of return on capital is $\\begin{array}{r}{R\\stackrel{\\bullet}{=}\\frac{\\dot{\\Phi}72,700}{\\dot{\\Phi}950,000}\\approx0.08}\\end{array}$ . If we further assume that the firm's gross value added for the year is $\\$500,000$ and compensation of employees is. $\\$360,000$ , then pure profits are $\\$67,300$ , the frm's capital share is $\\begin{array}{r}{\\dot{S^{K}}=\\frac{\\dot{9}72{},700}{\\dot{9}500{},000}\\approx0.15}\\end{array}$ , and the pure profit share is $\\begin{array}{r}{S^{\\Pi}=\\frac{\\$67,300}{8500,000}\\approx0.13}\\end{array}$  \n\n## II. Data  \n\n### A. National Accounts  \n\nData for the U.S. nonfinancial corporate sector cover the geographic area that comprises the 50 states and the District of Columbia. As an example, all economic activity by the foreign-owned Kia Motors automobile manufacturing plant in West Point, Georgia, is included in the data and is refected in the measures of gross value added, investment, capital, and compensation of employees. By contrast, all economic activity by the U.S.-owned Ford automobile manufacturing plant in Almussafes, Spain, is not included in the data and is not reflected in the measures of gross value added, investment, capital, and compensation ofemployees.  \n\nThe data are taken from the following sources.  \n\nGross Value Added, Compensation of Employees, and Capital: Data on nominal gross value added are taken from the National Income and Productivity Accounts (NIPA) Table 1.14 (line 17). Data on compensation of employees are taken from the NIPA Table 1.14 (line 20). Compensation of employees includes all wages in salaries, whether paid in cash or in kind and includes employer costs of health insurance and pension contributions. Compensation of employees also includes the exercising of most stock options;5 stock options are recorded when exercised (the time at which the employee incurs a tax liability) and are valued at their recorded tax value (the difference between the market price and the exercise price). Compensation of employees further includes compensation of corporate officers. Data on taxes on production and imports less subsidies are taken from the NIPA Table 1.14 (line 23).  \n\nCapital data are taken from the BEA Fixed Asset Table 4.1.The BEA capital data provide measures of the capital stock, the depreciation rate of capital, and inflation for three categories of capital (nonresidential structures, equipment, and IPPs), as well as a capital aggregate. The 14th comprehensive revision of NIPA in 2013 expanded its recognition of intangible capital beyond software to include expenditures for R&D and for entertainment, literary, and artistic originals as fixed investments. Asset-specific expected capital inflation is constructed as a three-year moving average of realized capital inflation. The results are robust to using realized capital inflation instead of expected capital infation. In addition to the BEA capital data, the main specification includes inventories. Data on inventories are taken from the Integrated Macroeconomic Accounts for the United States Table S.5.a.  \n\nThe output and capital data do not include any residential housing. BEA Fixed Asset Table 5.1 indicates that, in addition to nonresidential fixed assets (nonresidential structures, equipment, and IPPs), the corporate sector owns a small amount of residential housing. In all years, residential housing makes up a very small fraction of the value of the fixed assets owned by the U.S. nonfinancial corporate sector. In 2014, the corporate sector owned $\\$0.19$ trillion of residential housing. In the same year, the nonfinancial corporate sector owned $\\$14.62$ trillion of nonresidential fixed assets (nonresidential structures, equipment, and $\\mathrm{IPPs}$ 0. In addition, corporate-owned residential housing makes up a very small fraction of total U.S. residential housing. In 2014, the value of residential housing in the private economy was $\\$18.5$ trillion. I have not included this stock of residential housing in the calculations. Similarly, the measure of gross value added does not include the $\\$1.66$ trillion contribution of residential housing to the gross value added of the private sector. The results are robust to including the corporate-owned residential housing.  \n\nCorporate Tax Rate and Capital Allowances: Data on the corporate tax rate are taken from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Tax Database and data on the capital allowance are taken from the TaxFoundation.  \n\n### B. The Cost of Capital  \n\n#### B.1. Debt Cost of Capital  \n\nI combine data on rates and market values of bonds, commercial paper, and loans in order to construct a representative debt cost of capital.  \n\nTo compute the representative cost of debt for corporate bonds, I use nine Barclays indices.6 For these indices, Bloomberg provides data on market values outstanding, maturity, and option-adjusted spread (OAS). I construct the option-adjusted yield as the sum of the OAS and the (interpolated) yield on a U.S. treasury of the same maturity. I then construct the aggregate optionadjusted yield as the weighted average of the individual indices, where the weights are propositional to market values.  \n\nUnfortunately, the indices do not cover a long enough time period to use in the analysis. Figure 1, Panel A, compares the aggregate option-adjusted yield to Moody's Aaa and Baa Corporate Bond Yields. In the overlapping period, Moody's Aaa bond portfolio is very similar to the aggregate option-adjusted yield in both level and trend. While Moody's Aaa has a higher grade than the representative portfolio, it also has a longer maturity and this can help explain why the two portfolios have similar yields throughout the sample. Moody's Baa bond portfolio is very similar in trend, but not in level. I therefore approximate the representative portfolio with Moody's Aaa.  \n\n![](images/5cc9127115b611b032923f8797ad9e2e1726ee4722df125b5844d3538a34c8d6.jpg)  \nPanel A. Bond Indices  \n\n![](images/b736b327cfe0cfc8f09067b454f5ab72acc3243d26ddcb8d6e3f7f143ba035b6.jpg)  \nFigure 1. Bond indices, commercial paper, and loans. Panel A (Bond Indices) shows the aggregate option-adjusted yield on the Barclays indices and Moody's Aaa and Baa Corporate Bond Yields. Panel B (Commercial Paper) shows the aggregate rate of the 12 types of nonfinancial commercial paper and the 3-Month AA Nonfinancial Commercial Paper Rate. Panel C (Loans) shows the aggregate rate on commercial and industrial loans made by all commercial banks and the prime lending rate. See Section I.B for further details. (Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com)  \n\nTo compute the representative cost of debt for corporate commercial paper, I use data for 12 types of nonfinancial commercial paper,7 taken from the Federal Reserve. The data contain daily information on rates and issuance. I calculate monthly rates as the weighted average of the daily weights, where the weights are proportional issuance.8  \n\nUnfortunately, the detailed data on commercial paper do not cover a long enough time period to use in the analysis. Figure 1, Panel B, compares the aggregate rate on 12 types of nonfinancial commercial paper to the 3-Month AA Nonfinancial Commercial Paper Rate. The two series are very similar in both level and trend. I therefore approximate the rate on commercial paper with the 3-Month AA Nonfinancial Commercial Paper Rate.9  \n\nTo compute the representative cost of debt for corporate loans, I use data on commercial and industrial loans made by all commercial banks, taken from the Federal Reserve Table E.2 (Survey of Terms of Business Lending). The table provides quarterly rates for three types of loans (classified by size) as well as an aggregate rate. I assume that the rate is constant within each quarter.  \n\nTo ensure that the data properly account for large loans made to corporations, I compare the rate on large commercial and industrial loans to the rates on drawn syndicated loans available through DealScan. The average difference between the rate on large commercial and industrial loans and an aggregated rate on drawn syndicated loans is one basis point.  \n\nThe data are available for 1986Q2 to 2017Q2. To extend the data to the start of the sample, I compare the aggregate rate to a wide range of publicly available rates. The prime lending rate provides a good match to the level and trend during the late 1980s. Figure 1, Panel C, compares the rate on commercial and industrial loans made by all commercial banks to the prime lending rate. The two series are very similar in level and trend. I approximate the rate on loans using the rate for commercial and industrial loans made by all commercial banks together with the prime lending rate for the period prior to 1986Q2.  \n\nI compute the debt cost of capital as the weighted average of the yield on Moody's Aaa (Bonds), the 3-Month AA Nonfinancial Commercial Paper Rate (Commercial Paper), and the rate for commercial and industrial loans made by all commercial banks (Loans). The weights are proportional to the market values. Data on market values are taken from the Integrated Macroeconomic Accounts for the United States Table S.5.a (Bonds is the sum of lines 132 and 133, Commercial Paper is line 131, and Loans is line 134).  \n\nIdeally, we would adjust the debt cost of capital to account for expected default losses. Moody's (2018) shows that over the sample period, the rate of default on bonds slightly increases and recovery upon default is stable and has no trend, suggesting that expected default losses remain constant or slightly increase. Therefore, it seems likely that the measure of the debt cost of capital slightly overstates the true value, and therefore, slightly understates the decline.  \n\n#### B.2. Equity Cost of Capital  \n\nUnlike the debt cost of capital, which can be constructed from observed market data, the equity cost of capital is unobserved and requires a model. 1 approximate the equity cost of capital as the sum of the yield on the 10-year U.S. treasury and a constant $5\\%$ equity risk premium. Typical constructions of the equity cost of capital measure an equity risk premium relative to the yield on a one-year treasury bill. An equity risk premium of $5\\%$ relative to a 10-year treasury bond implies an average risk premium of $6.5\\%$ ,relativeto the one-year treasury bill, that has increased since 2008 to $7.4\\%$  \n\nThere is a large literature on measuring the equity risk premium. This literature tends to find an equity risk premium that has been either constant or declining since the 1980s and often finds values of the equity risk premium that are significantly lower than $6.5\\%$ relative to the one-year treasury bill. If the true equity risk premium is declining, then my estimates of pure profits will understate the true increase. Conversely, if the true equity premium is increasing, then my estimates of pure profits will overstate the true increase. If the true equity risk premium is lower than $6.5\\%$ relativetothe one-year treasury bill, then my estimates of pure profits are understated in all years.  \n\nCampbell and Thompson (2008) present many predictive time-series regressions of excess stock returns that outperform the historical average return. The paper provides evidence that imposing parameter restrictions leads to superior out-of-sample forecasts. Across predictive regressions, the equity risk premium has been either constant or declining since the 1980s. The paper uses data 0ver for period 1927 to 2005. Martin (2017) provides updated estimates through 2011 that show a slight decline in the equity risk premium through2011.  \n\nLettau, Ludvigson, and Wachter (2008) document a strong correlation between low-frequency movements in macrovolatility and corporate valuation ratios. The paper calibrates a consumption-based asset-pricing model that incorporates regimes of macrovolatility and finds that the model successfully matches the observed increase in valuation ratios. The model estimates show a significant decline in the equity risk premium since the early 1980s due to the persistently low output and consumption volatility.  \n\nAvdis and Wachter (2017） incorporate information in the time series of prices and dividends in a maximum likelihood estimation framework. Using data from January 1953 to December 2011, the paper finds a long-run decline in the equity risk premium. Importantly, the estimated equity risk premium declines from the early 1980s through the end of the sample. The paper further presents estimates that allow for possible structural breaks in the data and this does not alter the conclusions. The authors further confirm that the results are not due to unusual characteristics of the dividend series by considering other valuation ratios such as book-to-market or earningsto-price.  \n\nMartin (2017) combines options data with assumptions on the stochastic discount factor to construct a lower bound on the equity risk premium from January 1996 to January 2012. The paper finds short-lived episodes of increases in the equity risk premium, but no trend increase. The paper further presents evidence that the lower bound that is estimated is approximately tight.  \n\n![](images/43d9d31ab6d66186db39051d7c10779404846e4a50eb36de2f9c2a4f7d7b0277.jpg)  \nPanel A.

Results  \n\nThis section presents the capital and pure profit shares of gross value added for the U.S. nonfinancial corporate sector over the period 1984 to 2014.  \n\nThroughout this section, several time series are approximated by a linear time trend. For a variable $X$ , the fitted pp change in $X$ is $\\hat{X_{2014}}-\\hat{X_{1984}}$ , and the fitted percent $(\\%)$ change in $X$ is $\\frac{X_{2014}^{\\sim}-X_{1984}^{\\sim}}{X_{1984}^{\\sim}}$  \n\n### A. The Required Rate of Return  \n\nFigure 2 shows the components of the required rate of return on capital for the U.S. nonfinancial corporate sector over the period 1984 to 2014. Panel A shows the debt cost of capital, the equity cost of capital, and the weighted average cost of capital. All three measures of the cost of capital show a large decline over the period 1984 to 2014. The decline in the cost of capital tracks the decline in the risk-free rate. Approximating the weighted average cost of capital by a linear time trend shows that the cost of capital declines from $11.3\\%$ in 1984to $6.3\\%$ in 2014.  \n\nPanel B shows two measures of expected infation: expected capital infation, equal to a three-year moving average of realized capital inflation; and expected consumption inflation, equal to the median expected 12-month price change taken from the University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers. Both measures of expected infation show no trend over the period 1984 to 2014. While realized inflation is more volatile than expected inflation, realized capital infation and realized consumption infation also show no trend over this period. Panel C shows the depreciation rate of capital. There is variation over time in the depreciation rate, but this variation is very small compared to the decline in the cost of capital.  \n\nPanel D shows the required rate of return on capital, which was presented in equation (2). The figure shows a clear and dramatic decline in the required rate of return on capital. The decline in the required rate of return tracks the decline in the cost of capital. Approximating the required rate of return by a linear time trend shows that the required rate of return declines from $18.9\\%$ in1984to $13.3\\%$ in 2014, a decline of $5.6\\mathrm{pp}$  \n\n### B. Capital Costs and Pure Profits  \n\nThe large decline in the required rate of return does not necessarily imply a decline in the capital share. In a typical model of firm production, firms respond to the decline in the required rate of return by increasing their use of capital inputs. If firms respond strongly enough, the increase in capital inputs is larger than the decline in the required rate of return, and as a result, the capital share increases.  \n\nHowever, the U.S. nonfinancial corporate sector does not sufficiently increase its use of capital inputs to offset the decline in the required rate of return, and as a result, the capital share declines.  \n\nFigure 3 shows the capital and pure profit shares of gross value added for the U.S. nonfinancial corporate sector over the period 1984 to 2014. Recall from Section $\\mathrm{I}$ that capital costs are the product of the required rate of return on capital and the value of the capital stock, pure profits are gross value added less compensation of employees less capital costs less taxes on production and imports plus subsidies, the capital share is the ratio of capital costs to gross value added, and the pure profit share is the ratio of pure profits to gross value added.  \n\nPanel A shows the capital share of gross value added. The capital share shows a clear and dramatic decline. Approximating the capital share by a linear time trend shows that the capital share declines from $32\\%$ of gross value added in 1984 to $25\\%$ of gross value added in 2014, a decline of 7pp or $22\\%$ . Measured in percentage terms, the decline in the capital share $(22\\%)$ is significantly larger than the decline in the labor share $(11\\%)$  \n\n![](images/cd40fc75b278172ee9036e2b2acf4d7bb672fb3f1af0b46afea9f1c9ccbf6859.jpg)  \nPanel A.

The figure shows the capital share and pure profit share of gross value added for the U.S. nonfinancial corporate sector over the period 1984 to 2014. Capital costs are the product of the required rate of return on capital and the value of the capital stock. Pure profits are gross value added less compensation of employees less capital costs less taxes on production and imports plus subsidies. Panel A: the capital share is the ratio of capital costs to gross value added. Panel B: the pure profit share is the ratio of pure profits to gross value added. Both figures include a fitted linear trend. See Section IHI for further details. (Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com)  \n\nPanel B shows the pure profit share of gross value added. The pure profit share shows a clear and dramatic increase. Consistent with the previous research,10 I find that pure profits were very small in the early 1980s. However, pure profits have increased dramatically over the past since the early 1980s. The fitted linear trend shows that pure profits increased from approximately $-5.6\\%$ of gross value added in 1984 to $7.9\\%$ of gross value added in 2014, an increase of 13.5pp.  \n\n### C. Magnitude  \n\nThe labor share measures the ratio of compensation of employees to labor productivity:  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{w L}{P^{\\cal Y}Y}}={\\frac{w}{P^{\\cal Y}Y L}}.\n$$  \n\nOver the period 1984 to 2014, labor productivity grew faster than labor compensation. The growing gap between labor productivity and labor compensation is not explained by an increase in capital costs. Back in 1984, every dollar of labor costs was accompanied by $49\\phi$ of capital costs. By 2014, every dollar of labor costs was accompanied by only $42\\phi$ of capital costs. Thus, despite the decline in the labor share, labor costs have increased faster than capital costs.  \n\nSince the early 1980s firms have dramatically reduced both labor costs and capital costs and increased pure profits (all measured as a share of gross value added). To offer a sense of the magnitude, the value of this increase in pure profits amounts to $\\$1.2$ trillion in 2014, or $\\$14.6$ thousand for each of the approximately 81 million employees of the nonfinancial corporate sector.  \n\n## IV. Robustness  \n\nThis section considers the robustness of the decline in the capital share and the increase in the pure profit share to potentially mismeasured inputs into the BEA construction of capital, alternative measures of capital, potentially omitted or unobserved intangible capital, and alternative assumptions on the equity risk premium.  \n\n### A. Alternative Rates of Depreciation and Capital Inflation  \n\nThe BEA measures of depreciation rates are based on the work of Hulten and Wykoff (1981).11 While the BEA provides measures for the rates of depreciation for assets that were not considered by Hulten and Wykoff (1981), there are assets included in the original study for which available data were incomplete and therefore estimated rates of depreciation required strong assumptions. Furthermore, with few exceptions, asset-specific rates of depreciation are assumed to have remained constant over time. Asset-specific capital infation measures are primarily calculated using the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) producer price index (PPI) and import price index (IPI), which attempt to incorporate adjustments for changes in quality.12 Measurement error, changes over time in rates of depreciation, and unmeasured quality adjustment to capital could have important implications for the measurement of capital costs and pure profits.  \n\nConstruction of the nominal value of the capital stock and the required rate of return on capital relies heavily on the BEA measures of depreciation rates and capital infation. As a result, mismeasured values of the rate of depreciation and capital inflation could have implications for the level and the trend in capital costs and pure profits. A higher rate of depreciation would lead us to estimate a lower value of the capital stock and at the same time a higher required rate of return on capital. Similarly, higher capital infation would lead us to estimate a higher value of the capital stock and at the same time a lower required rate of return.  \n\nI construct hypothetical fixed asset tables for a wide range of alternative values of the rate of depreciation and capital infation. I consider specifications in which these adjustments are simultaneously made to all BEA categories of assets (structures, equipment, and IPPs) as well as specifications in which these adjustments are made to any combination of the BEA categories of assets.  \n\nFor every given time series of asset-specific values of the rate of depreciation $(\\tilde{\\delta}_{s,t}$ ） and capital  inflation $(\\tilde{\\pi}_{s,t})$ , I construct an asset-specific series of the nominal value of capital using the perpetual inventory method $\\tilde{P}_{s,t}\\tilde{K}_{s,t+1}=(1-\\tilde{\\delta}_{s,t})\\tilde{P}_{s,t}\\tilde{K}_{s,t}+I_{s,t}$ assuming an initial nominal value of capital at the end of 1974 equal to the BEA reported nominal value of capital. Given the newly computed series of capital and the new values of the required rate of return, I compute capital costs and pure profits.  \n\nFirst, I use values of capital inflation that are between $-2\\mathrm{pp}$ and $+2\\mathrm{pp}$ of the BEA measures of capital infation. The considered variation in capital inflation is large, given that average aggregate capital infation over the sample period is $2.4\\%$  \n\nSecond, I consider alternative values of the rate of depreciation that are between half and two times the value of the BEA measures of the rate of depreciation. This adjustment allows for the possibility that the BEA measures of depreciation are off by a constant multiplicative factor.  \n\nThird, I consider a possible unmeasured trend in the rate of depreciation. Specifically, I assume that each new vintage of capital (e.g., structures built in 1990) has a potentially different depreciation rate. I parameterize the depreciation rate of capital of type s as 8s,t,u = 8st X (1 + 201146b 0bs,where sndexe the category of capital, $t$ indexes time, $\\delta_{s,t}$ is the BEA rate of depreciation of capital of type $s$ in year $t$ , and $v$ indexes vintage. I consider a range of parameters for the trend in the rate of depreciation that results in a range of values for depreciation in 2014 that are between half and two times the value of the BEA measures of depreciation. To calculate capital costs and pure profits, I separately construct the required rate of return and capital costs for each category $\\times$ vintage of capital in each year.  \n\nFigure 4 shows the trend in the pure profit share for the range of alternative values of capital inflation and the rate of depreciation. For the purposes of this fgure, I have simultaneously adjusted the rates of depreciation and capital inflation for all BEA categories of assets. In all cases, the results are similar and even closer to the baseline results when I apply the adjustments to any subset of the BEA categories of assets.  \n\nPanel A presents the fitted change in the pure profit share for a range of adjustments to capital infation. The figure shows that the trend in the pure profit share varies by less than half a pp across a wide range of alternative values of capital inflation.  \n\nPanels B presents the fitted change in the pure profit share for a range of constant adjustments to the rate of depreciation. The figure shows that across a wide range of alternative values of the rate of depreciation, the fitted change in the pure profit share ranges from 12.3pp to $13.4\\mathrm{pp}$ . There is almost no change to the fitted change of the pure profit share for higher rates of depreciation.  \n\nPanel C presents the fitted change in the pure profit share for a range of adjustments to the trend in the rate of depreciation. The figure shows that across a wide range of possible trends in the rate of depreciation, the fitted change in the pure profit share ranges from 12.1pp to 15pp.13  \n\n![](images/86a5756aff0745ce7fb2b1e9ed60590976162bd864f32d49e985b13557952425.jpg)  \nPanel A.

(Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com)  \n\n### B. Alternative Measures of Capital  \n\nIn the main specification, capital consists of BEA capital (structures, equipment, and IPPs) as well as inventories. I now consider two alternative specifications of capital. The first alternative specification uses only the BEA measures of capital. This first specification is widely used in practice and thus allows for a better comparison of the results to existing research. The second alternative specification includes the BEA measures of capital, inventories, and real estate valued at market prices instead of at replacement cost (the difference is often thought of as the value of land). Data on the market value of real estate are taken from the Integrated Macroeconomic Accounts for the United States Table S.5.a.  \n\n#### TableI Time Trends of Labor, Capital, and Pure Profit Shares  \n\nThe table reports time trends for the U.S. nonfinancial corporate sector over the period 1984 to 2014. This table considers alternative measures of capital. BEA capital data are taken from BEA Fixed Asset Table 4.1 and include structures, equipment, and intellectual property products. Data on inventories and real estate valued at market prices are taken from the Integrated Macroeconomic Accounts for the United States, Table S.5.a. Capital data in column (1) consist of BEA capital and inventories.Capital data in column (2) consist of BEA capital. Capital data in column (3) consist of BEA capital and inventories and real estate is valued at market prices. Capital costs are the product of the required rate of return on capital and the value of the capital stock. Expected capital inflation is calculated as a three-year moving average of realized capital inflation. Pure profits are gross value added less compensation of employees less capital costs less taxes on production and imports plus subsidies. The labor share is the ratio of compensation of employees to gross value added. The capital share is the ratio of capital costs to gross value added. The pure profit share is the ratio of pure profits to gross value added. For a variable X, the ftted percentage point (pp) change in $\\mathrm{X}$ is $X_{2014}-X_{1984}$ , and the fitted percent $(\\%)$ change in $X$ is X2014-X1984 . The increase in pure profits per employee is the fitted percentage point change in the pure profit share multiplied by gross value added in 2014 and divided by the number of employees in 2014. See Sections III and IV.B for further details.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"3\">MeasureofCapital</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1-Main)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td></tr><tr><td>DeclineinLaborShare</td><td>11%</td><td>11%</td><td>11%</td></tr><tr><td>Decline in Capital Share</td><td>22%</td><td>17%</td><td>28%</td></tr><tr><td>IncreaseinPureProfitShare</td><td>13.5pp</td><td>11.5pp</td><td>16.2pp</td></tr><tr><td>IncreaseinPureProfitsPerEmployee</td><td>$14.6 (thousand)</td><td>$12.4 (thousand)</td><td>$17.5 (thousand)</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n(1) BEA Measures of Capital and Inventories. (2)BEA Measures of Capital. (3) BEA Measures of Capital, Inventories, and Real Estate Valued at Market Prices.  \n\nTable I presents the results of the analysis. Each column of Table I uses a different measure of capital. Column (1) uses the BEA measures of capital as well as inventories. Column (2) uses BEA measures of capital and excludes inventories. Column (3) uses the BEA measures of capital, inventories, and real estate valued at market prices instead of at replacement cost. It is easily noticeable from this table that more inclusive measures of capital lead to larger measured declines in the capital share and larger increases in the pure profit share. The reason for this is straightforward: over the period 1984 to 2014, the required rate of return on all forms of capital declines sharply. Since the value of the additional capital does not grow sufficiently fast relative to output, inclusion of this additional capital results in an even greater decline in the capital share and increase in the pure profit share.  \n\n### C. Potentially Omitted or Unobserved Intangible Capital  \n\nThe BEA measures of capital include physical capital, such as structures and equipment, as well as measures of intangible capital, such as R&D, software, and artistic designs. Despite the BEA's efforts to account for intangible capital, it is possible that there are forms of intangible capital that are not included in the existing BEA measures. Indeed, past research has considered several forms of intangible capital that are not currently capitalized by the BEA and has argued that these are important for explaining asset valuations and cash fows.14 These additional forms of intangible capital include organizational capital, market research, branding, and training of employees. Might the high level of pure profits and the large increase in the pure profit share measured in Section IHI reflect large and increasing cash fows that are the return to missing or unobserved capital?  \n\nThe effect of including an additional form of capital unambiguously increases capital costs. Since the required rate of return on this additional capital is positive (or at least nonnegative), the user of this capital incurs positive annual capital costs. Next, the inclusion of additional capital very likely increases gross value added. Current measures of gross value added exclude firm investment in this additional capital and therefore underestimate gross value added by the value of the investment. As long as investment in this capital is positive, gross value added is understated. The effect on pure profits is ambiguous: on the one hand, capital costs are now a larger portion of observed gross value added and, on the other hand, observed gross value added understates true gross value added. The inclusion of this additional capital will reduce pure profits if capital costs are larger than the value of the investment. A few lines of simple algebra show that as long as the capital costs of this additional capital are larger than the value of the investment, accounting for this additional capital increases the capital share and decreases the pure profit share.  \n\nWhile it is easy to work out the effect of including an additional form of capital on the level of the capital and pure profit shares, its effect on the trend in the capital and pure profit shares is less clear. Since the early 1980s the required rate of return on all forms of capital has declined sharply, due to a large decline in the cost of capital. This decline in the cost of capital equally affects the required rate of return on any additional form of capital. As a result, if the stock of additional capital grows only at the rate of output, then the additional capital costs will grow far slower than output. This will have the effect of further reducing the trend of the capital share and further increasing the trend in the pure profit share. As we saw in Section IV.B, the inclusion of additional forms of capital often leads to an even greater decline in the capital share and increase in the pure profit share. In order for this additional capital to have any mitigating effect on the trend in the capital and pure profit shares, the stock of additional capital would need to grow significantly faster than output. In order for this additional capital to completely offset the observed trend in capital and pure profit shares, the stock of additional capital would need to grow far faster than output.  \n\nI take two approaches to assessing the contribution of omitted intangible capital to the measured increase in pure profits. First, I incorporate the most comprehensive existing measures of omitted intangible capital into the analysis. Second, I construct a large number of scenarios for omitted intangible capital. Each scenario is a parameterization of investment, depreciation, and capital infation of intangible capital. For each scenario, I compute capital costs and pure profits that fully incorporate the unobserved investment. I find that existing measures of intangible capital are unable to explain the increase in pure profits. Of the large number of scenarios that I consider, none can fully account for the increase in pure profits. There are scenarios that can account for most of the increase in pure profits, but in all such scenarios, the value of missing intangible capital in 2014 would need to be larger than all capital measured by the BEA (structures, equipment, and IPPs).  \n\nAn increase in the importance of omitted intangible capital and an increase in pure profits are not mutually exclusive. Of the many scenarios of omitted intangible capital that I consider, many feature a simultaneous increase in intangible capital as well as a large increase in pure profits. In this sense, the increase in pure profits is consistent with many scenarios that feature rapidly increasing intangible capital.  \n\n#### C.1. Setup  \n\nThe conceptual framework for incorporating unobserved intangible capital follows Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel (2009) and McGrattan and Prescott (2010).  \n\n·The additional capital costs are equal to $R^{X}P^{X}X$ ,where $P^{X}X$ is the nominal alue of the unobserved stock of capital and $\\begin{array}{r}{R^{X}=((\\frac{D}{D+E}i^{D}(1-\\tau)+}\\end{array}$ $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{E}{D+E}i^{E})-\\mathbb{E}[\\pi^{X}]+\\delta^{X})\\frac{1-z^{X}\\times\\tau}{1-\\tau}}\\end{array}$ is the required rate of return on the unobserved capital.15 True capital costs are the sum of observed capital costs and unobserved capital costs: $R^{K}P^{K}K+R^{X}P^{X}X$   \n· True gross value added is the sum of observed gross value added $P^{Y}Y$ and unobserved investment $I^{X}$   \nTrue pure profits are observed pure profits, $\\Pi$ , less unobserved capital costs plus unobserved investment:  \n\n$$\n\\Pi^{T R U E}=\\left(\\underbrace{P^{Y}Y+I^{X}}_{\\mathrm{true~gross~value~added}}\\right)-\\left(\\underbrace{R^{K}P^{K}K+R^{X}P^{X}X}_{\\mathrm{true~capital~costs}}\\right)-w L\n$$  \n\n$$\n=\\Pi-R^{X}P^{X}X+I^{X}.\n$$  \n\n#### C.2. Approach #1: Existing Measures  \n\nThe first approach that I take to assessing the potential contribution of unmeasured intangible capital to the measured increase in pure profits is to explicitly incorporate existing measures of intangible capital. Much of the intangible capital considered by Corrado et al. (2016) is already included in the BEA Fixed Asset Tables and is therefore already accounted for in the baseline measures of capital costs and pure profits that appear in Section III. The category of intangible capital that is measured by Corrado et al. (2016) but is not included in the BEA data is called “Economic Competencies\" and includes the value of all market research, advertising, training, and organizational capital. The data on investment in intangible capital for the U.S. nonfinancial business sector are taken from IntanInvest.  \n\nUsing the data on nominal investment, price defators, and depreciation rates of “Economic Competencies,\" I construct a nominal stock of capital using the perpetual inventory method.16 I then construct corrected measures of capital costs, gross value added, and pure profits for each year in which the intangible capital data are available (1996 to 2014).17 1 find that the inclusion of economic competencies has modest effects on the level of pure profits. The inclusion of economic competencies accounts for pure profits that are on average equal to $0.3\\%$ of gross value added and that never exceed $1.52\\%$ of gross value added. I further find that the inclusion of economic competencies has modest effects on the trend in pure profits. I approximate the annual contribution of economic competencies to the pure profit share by a linear time trend and find that the inclusion of economic competencies can explain an annual increase of 0.033pp. This annual estimate implies that economic competencies can account for a 1pp increase in the pure profit share over the period 1984 to 2014. This amounts to $7.5\\%$ of the measured increase in the pure profit share presented in Section III.  \n\n#### C.3. Approach #2: Scenario Analysis  \n\nThe second approach that I take to assessing the potential contribution of unmeasured intangible capital to the measured increase in pure profits is to construct a wide range of scenarios. Each scenario is a hypothetical account of unmeasured intangible capital. For each scenario, I construct a hypothetical aggregate series of pure profits that fully accounts for the contribution of the hypotheticalfixed asset.  \n\nTable II summarizes the functional form assumptions and the range of parameter values that I use in construction of unmeasured intangible capital. Construction of a scenario requires assumptions on investment $(I_{t}^{X})$ , capital inflation $(\\pi_{t}^{X})$ , the depreciation rate $(\\delta^{X})$ of unmeasured intangible capital, and an initial stock of unmeasured intangible capital $(P_{t_{0}}^{X}X_{t_{0}})$ . Allowing for, but not requiring, investment that is growing faster than output, I assume a rate of investment of the form $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{I_{t}^{X}}{P_{t}^{Y}Y_{t}}=a+b\\times(t-1984)}\\end{array}$ where $P_{t}^{Y}Y_{t}$ is measured gross value added. Allowing for, but not requiring, a time trend in the relative price of unmeasured intangible capital, I assume a path of capital inflation of the form πt $\\pi_{t}^{X}=\\pi_{t}^{Y}+c$ ，where $\\pi_{t}^{Y}$ is the percentage change in the price deflator for the nonfinancial corporate sector (calculated from NIPA Table 1.14). I assume a fixed depreciation rate $d$ and an initial stock of unmeasured intangible capital in 1975. The nominal value of unmeasured capital at the end of period $t$ is constructed by the perpetual inventory method and is given by the equation $P_{t}^{X}X_{t+1}=(1-\\delta^{X})P_{t}^{X}\\bar{X}_{t}+\\bar{I_{t}^{X}}$  \n\nFor a given scenario, I make the following adjustments to gross value added, capital costs, and pure profits. Adjusted gross value added is the sum of measured gross value added and investment in unmeasured intangible capital. Adjusted capital costs are the sum of measured capital costs and unmeasured capital costs. Adjusted pure profits are adjusted gross value added less adjusted capital costs. To facilitate comparison, the outcome that I measure is the ratio of adjusted pure profits to measured gross value added. The results are similar when I consider the ratio of adjusted pure profits to adjusted gross value added.  \n\nOf the large number of scenarios that I consider, none can fully account for the increase in the share of pure profits. Some scenarios can account for most of the increase (up to $60\\%$ 0. All of the scenarios that manage to account for at least half of the increase in the share of pure profits have the following features. First, the value of missing intangible capital in 2014 needs to be at least $\\$22$ trillion, which is $250\\%$ of observed gross value added and is more than $50\\%$ larger than all capital measured by the BEA (structures, equipment, and IPPs). Second, the rate of depreciation needs to be very low (no larger than $10\\%$  \n\nWe can compare these scenarios to the BEA measures of IPPs and economic competencies, which is the class of intangible capital that is measured by Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel (2009), but is not capitalized by the BEA. The value of the stock of IPPs in 2014 is only $24\\%$ of observed gross value added and the value of the stock of economic competencies in 2014 is only $17\\%$ of observed gross value added. Furthermore, the fitted rate of depreciation of IPPs is $22\\%$ and that of economic competencies is $44\\%$ . If we restrict attention to those scenarios that feature a rate of depreciation of at least $10\\%$ , then no such scenario can explain more than $38\\%$ of the increase in pure profits and in order to explain even one-third of the increase in pure profits the value of missing intangible capital in 2014 needs to be at least $\\$15.7$ trillion, which is $180\\%$ of observed gross value added.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Fitted Values</td><td>Intellectual Property Products α=0.036 60000=9 a=0.067 b=0.0005 α ∈[0,0.2] =α+bx(t-1984)</td><td>c=0.002 d=0.22 e=0.117 c=0.008 d =0.44</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Economic Competencies Range of Values Assumed Form</td><td>C E [-0.02,0.02] d ∈ [0.05,0.6] b ∈[0,0.01] e∈[0,2] +=x p=x?</td></tr><tr><td>Investment Input</td><td>Inflation</td><td>Depreciation InitialStock</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n![](images/d71816203a105e61650714470cdd02f54adf622c0dda5e99f86d69bc93cd623b.jpg)  \nPanel A.

(Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com)  \n\n### D. Alternative Values of the Equity Risk Premium  \n\nThe baseline specification assumes an equity cost of capital equal to sum of the yield on the 10-year U.S. treasury and $5\\%$ . I now consider other values of the equity risk premium. To match the estimates reported in the literature, in this exercise, I construct the equity cost of capital as the sum of the yield on the one-year U.S. treasury and an equity risk premium.  \n\nFirst, I consider fixed values of the equity risk premium that range from $4\\%$ to $8\\%$ . Second, I consider a possible trend in the equity risk premium. In this case, I calculate the equity risk premium in year $t$ as $\\begin{array}{r}{5\\%+\\mathrm{\\bar{Trend}}\\times\\frac{t-1984}{2014-1984}}\\end{array}$ and consider trends in the equity risk premium between $-3\\mathrm{pp}$ and $+3\\mathrm{pp}$  \n\nFigure 5 shows the trend in the pure profit share for the range of alternative values of the equity risk premium. Panel A presents the fitted change in the pure profit share for a range of constant equity risk premiums. A $5\\%$ equity risk premium implies a $15.4\\mathrm{pp}$ increase in the share of pure profits. A $7\\%$ equity risk premium implies a 14pp increase in the share of pure profits.  \n\nPanel B presents the fitted change in the pure profit share for a range of time trends in the equity risk premium. A trend increase in the equity risk premium reduces the trend increase in the share of pure profits. A trend increase of 3pp in the equity risk premium implies a $10\\mathrm{pp}$ increase inthe share of pure profits. Conversely (and in line with much of the research on the decline in the equity risk premium), a trend decline of3pp in the equity risk premium implies a 20.8pp increase in the share of pure profits.  \n\n## V. Labor Share and Industry Concentration  \n\nIn this section, I provide reduced-form empirical evidence to support the hypothesis that a decline in competition plays a significant role in the decline in the labor share. At the industry level, I am unable to directly measure competition and pure profits. Instead, I assume that an increase in concentration captures declines in competition and increases in pure profits. This assumption is true in standard models of imperfect competition and is supported by Salinger (1990) and Rotemberg and Woodford (1991). Using cross-sectional variation, I show that those industries that experience larger increases in concentration also experience larger declines in the labor share. Univariate regressions suggest that the increase in industry concentration can account for most of the decline in the labor share.  \n\n### A. Data  \n\nI use census data on industry payroll, sales, and concentration. Payroll includes all wages and salaries in cash and in kind, as well as all supplements to wages and salaries. The data provide four measures of industry concentrations, namely, the share of sales by the 4, 8, 20, and 50 largest firms. The data are available for the years 1997, 2002, 2007, and 2012 and cover all sectors of the private economy, with the exceptions of agriculture, mining, construction, management of companies, and public administration.  \n\nTo construct changes in the labor share and concentration, I match industries across census years.18 I construct a sample of all industries that are consistently defined over time and that have data on sales, payroll, and at least one measure of concentration. In several sectors, the census separately reports data for tax-exempt firms and it is not possible to construct an industry measure of concentration. Instead, I consider only firms subject to federal income tax. The results are robust to dropping these sectors. In total, the sample consists of 750 six-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) industries. As a share of the sectors covered by the census, the matched sample covers $76\\%$ of sales receipts in 1997 and $86\\%$ of sales receipts in 2012. As a share of the U.S. private economy,19 the matched sample covers $66\\%$ of sales receipts in 1997 and $76\\%$ of sales receipts in 2012.  \n\nThe assignment of firms to industries often includes a large amount of measurement error. When firms operate in multiple industries, the assignment of the firm to any one industry leads to measurement error in the sales, payroll, and concentration of all of the industries in which the firm operates. It is therefore difficult to compute industry-level outcomes in firm-level data sets such as Compustat.

Instead, the census separately assigns each and every establishment to a potentially separate industry. As an example, based Onits $\\bf{10k}$ filing, Compustat assigns Apple to the manufacturing industry Electronic Computers (SIC code 3571) despite the fact that Apple does not own or operate a single U.S. manufacturing establishment.20 By contrast, the census separately assigns Apple's offices, retail stores, and data centers to their respective industry. By classifying establishments rather than firms, the census reduces measurement error of industry variables.  \n\nTable IHI provides descriptive statistics of the labor share (the payroll share of sales) and the four census measures of industry concentration for the matched sample. The labor share of sales declines on average by 1.19pp, or $10\\%$ . The sales share of the four largest firms increases on average by $5.28\\mathrm{pp}$ Oor $21\\%$ . Almost all of the increase in the share of the 50 largest firms is due to the increase of the four largest firms: the shares of the largest 4, 8, 20, and 50 firms all show similar increases when measured in pp. Since the share of the  \n\n50 largest firms in 1997 is more than double that of the four largest firms, the percentage increase in the share of the 50 largest firms is less than half of the percentage increase in the share of the four largest firms.  \n\n### B. Empirical Specification  \n\n1 consider two reduced-form empirical specifications_ that relate the increase in concentration to the decline in the labor share.21 The first empirical specification is a regression in first differences  \n\n$$\nS_{j,t}^{L}-S_{j,t-5}^{L}=\\alpha_{t}+\\beta\\Big(C_{j,t}^{(n)}-C_{j,t-5}^{(n)}\\Big)+\\varepsilon_{j,t},\n$$  \n\nwhere Sy, - Sy, - -S,t-s is the change in the labor share o sales in industry from yeart - 5 to yeart, and C° - C-5 i C5 is the change inthe concentrationof sales in industry $j$ from year $t-k$ to year $t$ , measured as the change in the share of sales by the 4, 8, 20, and 50 largest firms. The second empirical specification is a regression in log differences  \n\n$$\n\\log S_{j,t}^{L}-\\log S_{j,t-5}^{L}=\\alpha_{t}+\\beta\\Big(\\log C_{j,t}^{(n)}-\\log C_{j,t-5}^{(n)}\\Big)+\\varepsilon_{j,t}.\n$$  \n\nIn both specifications, I weight each observation by its share of sales in year $t$ and standard errors are clustered by three-digit NAICS industry.  \n\nTo provide a sense of the magnitude of the decline in the labor share that is predicted by the increase in concentration, I report the observed and predicted decline in the labor share. In the first difference specification, the observed decline is the sales-weighted average change in the labor share $\\sum_{j}w_{j,2012}(S_{j,2012}^{L}-S_{j,1997}^{L})$ where $\\begin{array}{r}{w_{j,t}=\\frac{\\mathrm{sales}_{j,t}}{\\sum_{j}\\mathrm{sales}_{j,t}}}\\end{array}$ salst is industry j's share of sales in year $t$ and $\\begin{array}{r}{S_{j,t}^{L}=\\frac{\\mathrm{payroll}_{j,t}}{\\mathrm{sales}_{j,t}}}\\end{array}$ payrol is the labor share of sales in industry in year t. Note that this is the within-industry decline in the labor share in the standard variance decomposition.22 The predicted decline is the sales-weighted average predtdhaglaal $\\sum_{j}w_{j,2012}\\beta(C_{j,t}^{(n)}-\\bar{C}_{j,t-5}^{(n)})$ iInthe  \n\n#### TableIV Labor Share and Industry Concentration--Regression in First Differences  \n\nThe table reports results of regressions of changes in the labor share on changes in industry concentration.

Results  \n\nTable IV presents the results of regressions of the change in the labor share on the change in industry concentration, as specified in equation (10). Columns (1) to (4) show the results of weighted regressions of the change in the labor share on the change in industry concentration, measured as the share of sales by the 4, 8, 20, and 50 largest firms. The table shows that those industries that experience larger increases in concentration also experience larger declines in the labor share. The slope coefficient is negative and statistically significant in each of the regressions. Based on the estimated coefficient and the observed increase in concentration, the predicted decline in the labor share is similar in magnitude to the observed decline in the labor share. The slope coefficient remains stable across the specifications; this is expected since almost all of the increase in the share of the 50 largest firms is due to the increase of the four largest firms. Table V presents the results of the log specification.  \n\n#### TableV Labor Share and Industry Concentration-Regression in Log Differences  \n\nThe table reports results of regressions of log-changes in the labor share on log-changes in industry concentration. The unit of observation is a six-digit industry. Observations are weighted by an industry's share of sales. Standard errors are clustered by three-digit NAICS industry. Data on industry payrolls, sales, and concentration are taken from the economic census. The observed decline is the sales-weighted average change in the log-labor share.

In this specification, the predicted decline is between $33\\%$ and $40\\%$ of the observed decline in the log-labor share. In the log specification, the slope coefficient is increasing in absolute value across the specifications: the percentage increase in the share of the 50 largest firms is less than half of the percentage increase in the share of the four largest firms and the slope coefficient of the 50 largest firms is close to double that of the four largest firms. Taken together, the results suggest that the increase in concentration can account for most of the decline in the labor share.  \n\n### D. Robustness  \n\nThe census data do not properly capture foreign competition and likely overestimate concentration in product markets for tradable goods. To the extent that foreign competition has increased over time, the census data likely overestimate increases in concentration in product markets for tradable goods. To address this concern, I repeat the analysis excluding all tradable industries.23 I find that excluding tradable industries does not alter the  \n\n#### TableVI Labor Share and Industry Concentration-By Subsample  \n\nThe table reports results of regressions of changes in the labor share on changes in industry concentration. The unit of observation is a six-digit NAICS industry. Observations are weighted by an industry's share of sales. Standard errors are clustered by three-digit NAICS industry. Data on industry payrolls, sales, and concentration are taken from the economic census. The observed decline is the sales-weighted average change in the labor share. The predicted decline is the salesweighted average predicted change in the labor share. The classification of tradable industries is taken from Mian and Sufi (2014).

Furthermore, in the sample of tradable industries, there is only a very small cross-sectional relationship between changes in measured concentration and changes in the labor share. In the sample of tradable industries, the regressions predict almost no decline in the labor share. These results are reported in columns (2) and (3) of Table VI.  \n\nHartman-Glaser, Lustig, and Xiaolan (2019) and Autor et al. (2017) provide micro evidence on the source of the decline in the labor share. The authors offer explanations for the decline in the labor share that focus on productivity (Autor et al. (2017)) and insurance and intangible capital (Hartman-Glaser, Lustig, and Xiaolan (2019)). These (and other) explanations that focus on factors other than competition predict equally sized correlations between increased concentration and declining labor share in both tradable and nontradable industries; the data show almost no correlation in tradable industries.  \n\nSecond, in several sectors, the census measures concentration separately for tax-exempt firms. This introduces measurement error in the concentration variable. Column (4) of Table VI repeats the analysis after excluding sectors in which tax-exempt firms make up a large fraction of sales (Health Care and Social Assistance and Other Services). I find that excluding these sectors does not alter theresults.  \n\nFinally, an increase in the importance of intangible capital could cause a decline in the labor share and an increase in concentration that is unrelated to a decline in competition. Column (5) of Table VI repeats the analysis after excluding R&D intensive industries.24 I find that excluding these industries does not alter the results.  \n\n## VI. Discussion and Literature Review  \n\nThis section provides a discussion of the results and a review of the related literature.  \n\n### A. Discussion  \n\n#### A.1. Adjustment Costs  \n\nA common approach to measuring adjustment costs combines parametric assumptions on the functional form of adjustment costs and data on the ratio of investment to capital. To the extent that this approach correctly captures adjustment costs, the data show that the ratio of investment to capital is, in fact, slightly declining over the sample period. This suggests that adjustment costs are declining and the trend in pure profits in excess of adjustment costs isunderstated.  \n\nAnother approach to assessing the potential contribution of adjustment costs is to consider model-based results. Using a model, we can ask two different questions. First, for a given calibration of the model, can slow responses on the part of firms explain the observed trends in the data? Second, can a change in the severity of adjustment costs explain the observed trends in the data?  \n\nInternet Appendix Section $\\mathrm{II}$ presents a model of monopolistic competition with quadratic adjustment costs. In the model, firms own the capital stock and choose a path of investment that maximizes their market value. Further, in the model, I mimic the empirical measurement of capital costs and pure profits. I calculate capital costs as $(r+\\delta)\\times K$ and I calculate pure profits as gross value added less capital costs and compensation of employees.  \n\nFor a wide range of adjustment cost parameters,25 I compute the unconditional means and standard deviations of the labor, capital, and pure profit shares. I find that these unconditional means are insensitive to the adjustment cost parameter. In this sense, a change to the adjustment cost parameter should not result in a change to the long-run level of the labor share or pure profit share.  \n\nIn addition, for different values of the adjustment cost parameter, I compute the pairwise correlations of the labor, capital, and pure profit shares. For any positive adjustment cost parameter, the labor and pure profit shares are procyclical and positively correlated. Models with higher values of the adjustment cost parameter feature higher correlations between the labor and pure profit shares. These results suggest that a path of shocks that lead to higher measured pure profits should also lead to a higher labor share.  \n\n#### A.2. Measurements of the Capital Share  \n\nThe measurement of the capital share in this paper builds on the work of Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) and Rognlie (2015). Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) and Rognlie (2015) study the decline in the labor share and additionally provide an estimate of the capital share. In both cases, the authors find that the capital share does not sufficiently increase to offset the decline in labor, and furthermore, the capital share might decrease slightly.  \n\nIn their measurement, Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) decompose the capital share into the product of three components,  \n\n$$\n\\frac{R P^{K}K}{P^{Y}Y}=R\\times\\frac{P^{K}K}{P^{I}I}\\times\\frac{P^{I}I}{P^{Y}Y},\n$$  \n\nwhere the first component is the required rate of return, the second component is the ratio of the nominal value of capital to investment, and the third component is the ratio of nominal investment to gross value added. The authors assume that the required rate of return on capital is constant and that the ratio of the nominal value of the capital stock to nominal investment is constant.26 These assumptions lead the authors to measure the percentage change in the capital share as the percentage change in the ratio of investment to gross value added.  \n\nFigure 6 plots the ratio of investment to gross value added in the U.S. corporate sector using the NIPA data. The figure_shows that the ratio of investment to gross value added is not declining.27 Thus, the methodology of Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014), when applied to the U.S. nonfinancial corporate sector, does not suggest a decline in the capital share.  \n\nRognlie (2015) provides two measures of the capital share.28 In the first measure, the author assumes that the required rate of return on capital is 26 See Section IV.B of Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) for their construction of the capital share, as well as for their assumptions of a constant ratio of the nominal value of the capital stock to nominal investment and a constant required rate of return on capital.  \n\n27 These results are not directly comparable to Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014, fgure IX). There are two main differences. First, figure IX is constructed using GDP data rather than corporate data. The GDP data include investment in residential housing and the contribution of residential housing to GDP; see Rognlie (2015) for a detailed discussion of the role of residential housing. Second, fgure IX is constructed using data for the period 1975 to 2011. The ratio of U.S. nonfinancial corporate investment to gross value added is not declining over the period 1975 to2011.  \n\n28 See Section IIB of Rognlie (2015)for details on the construction ofthe capital share.  \n\n![](images/9c91a4cf350622bf9ac48283be101e4f8566bc5405e9527c56930716a18074bd.jpg)  \nFigure 6. Ratio of investment to gross value added. This figure shows the ratio of investment to gross value added for the U.S. nonfinancial corporate sector over the period 1984 to 2014. See Section VI.A.2 for further details. (Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com)  \n\nconstant. This assumption leads the author to measure the percentage change in the capital share as the percentage change in the ratio of the value of the capital stock to gross value added. Using this measure, Rognlie (2015) finds a slight increase in the capital share. These results are consistent with my findings: I find that the ratio of the value of the capital stock to gross value added is increasing slightly over the period 1984 to 2014. In the second measure, the author constructs a time series of the real interest rate from the market and book values of the U.S. corporate sector. This construction of the real cost of capital produces values that are inconsistent with observed market data. Most importantly, the construction does not match the observed decline in market prices. When combining NIPA data with the cost of capital presented in Rognlie (2015), I find no decline in the capital share.29  \n\nMeasures of the capital share that assume a constant required rate of return show no decline; measures of the capital share that incorporate market prices show a large decline.  \n\n#### A.3. Production-Based Estimates of Markups  \n\nDe Loecker and Eeckhout (2017） present production-based estimates of markups for nonfinancial U.S. public firms. Unlike my estimates of pure profits, the production-based estimates of markups do not impute capital costs, nor do they rely on time-series variation in capital or on assumptions on the required rate of return on capital and its components. Instead, the production-based approach estimates a production function and backs out markups from the firm's first-order conditions. Consistent with my findings, the authors find an increase in markups since the early 1980s. At the same time, our implied series of the pure profit share display notable differences in magnitude.  \n\nDe Loecker and Eeckhout (2017) find that markups over sales increased from 1.2 in the early 1980s to 1.6 in 2014. I convert these markup estimates into a series of the pure profit share of gross value added as follows.  \n\nIn the frst step, I compute the pure profit share of sales implied by the markup using the equation  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{markup}=\\mathrm{scale~of~production}\\times\\left(\\mathrm{1-pure~proft~share~of~sales}\\right)^{-1}.\n$$  \n\nWith constant returns to scale, the reported markup of 1.2 implies a pure profit share of sales equal to $17\\%$ of sales and a markup of 1.6 implies a pure profit share of sales equal to $38\\%$ . If we assume a higher scale of production equal to 1.1, then the authors? markup estimates imply that the pure profit share of sales was $8\\%$ in the early 1980s and $31\\%$ in2014.  \n\nIn the second step, I multiply the pure profit share of sales by the ratio of sales to gross value added. Census data on sales and the BEA data on gross value added for the nonfinancial private sector show that the ratio of sales to gross value added is around 2.6 over this period. Even when we assume a high scale of production (1.1), the authors? markup estimates imply that the pure profit share of gross value added was $22\\%$ in the early 1980s and $81\\%$ in 2014. Both the level and the trend in these implied values of pure profits are an order of magnitude larger than those that I find.30  \n\n#### A.4.Long-Run Trends and Measurement Error  \n\nFollowing the existing literature on the decline in the labor share, this paper focuses on the period starting in the early 1980s. Trying to explain the decline in the labor share over this period, past research has argued that firms have substituted labor for physical capital. As the results of this paper show, the decline in the labor share since the early 1980s was not offset by an increase in the capital share. Despite the decline in the labor share, labor costs have, in fact, increased faster than capital costs. This evidence argues strongly against these existing theories of the decline in the labor share.  \n\nBarkai and Benzell (2018) extend the measurement of capital costs and pure profits to the period 1946 to 2015. The authors find that (i) pure profits were declining in the decades following the Second World War, (ii) pure profits have been increasing since the early 1980s, and (ii) the early 1980s are a point of sudden change. As a share of gross value added, pure profits today are higher than they were in 1984, but lower than they were in the late 1940s.  \n\nAfter seeing the results of the long-term measurement, several notable features of the data point to a potentially large role for measurement error. The capital share and pure profit share (i) are far more volatile than the labor share, (ii) are highly negatively correlated with each other but not so much with the labor share, and (iii) move a lot over the late 1970s and early 1980s (a period with volatile inflation). Are these features of the data economically meaningful or are they symptoms of noisy and unreliable estimates?  \n\nBarkai and Benzell (2018) combine two approaches to addressing the concern of measurement error. First, they measure capital costs and pure profits under a range of assumptions. The main findings are robust to alternative measurement assumptions. At the same time, the level of estimated profits during the late 1970s (a period of high and volatile inflation) is sensitive to alternative specifications. Second, they consider alternative measures of profits that are not likely to be subject to similar concerns of measurement error. Measures of accounting profits and the pure profits implied by the most conservative production-based estimates show trends that are very similar to thebaselineresults.  \n\n#### A.5. Contribution of BEA Intellectual Property Products  \n\nKoh, Santaeulalia-Llopis, and Zheng (2016) present evidence that the BEA's expanded recognition of IPPs as a fixed asset in 2013 has contributed to the measured decline in the labor share. The authors further argue that the decline in the labor share reflects a transition to a more IPP-intense economy.  \n\nIn its 14th comprehensive revision of NIPA in 2013, the BEA expanded its recognition of intangible capital beyond software to include expenditures for R&D and for entertainment, literary, and artistic originals as fixed investments. The BEA's expanded recognition of IPP as a fixed asset affects both the level and the trend in the labor share. Any recognition of additional investment in fixed assets increases measured gross value added in each and every year by the nominal value of investment. This, in turn, increases the denominator of the labor share and therefore reduces its level. To the extent that investment in the newly recognized components of IPP has increased faster than output, the expanded recognition of IPP in the national accounts leads to a decline in the labor share.  \n\nUnlike most of the existing literature on the labor share, Koh, SantaeulaliaLlopis, and Zheng (2016) measure a linear trend in the labor share over the entire postwar period (1947to 2014). Elsby, Hobijn, and \\$ahin (2013) and Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) who document the decline in the U.S. and global labor share provide evidence of a decline since the early 1980s. Moreover, these papers use data that predate the 2013 BEA revision. Using current BEA data, we can assess the impact of the expansion of IPP on the decline in the labor share since the 1980s.31 I find that the expanded recognition of  \n\nIPP capital leads to a measured labor share that is on average 2pp lower over the period 1984 to 2014. However, I find that the expanded recognition of IPP capital has no effect on the trend in the labor share. I approximate the labor share by a linear time trend over this period and find that current BEA measures of the labor share show an estimated decline of 6.9pp. When I remove all investment in newly recognized forms of IPP capital from gross value added, I find an estimated decline in the labor share of 6.8pp. These results show that the decline in the labor share since the early 1980s is not a result of the BEA's expanded recognition of IPP capital.  \n\nFurthermore, my measurement of capital costs includes all IPP capital. In this sense, my findings account for the contribution of IPP capital.  \n\n#### A.6. Labor Income in Disguise  \n\nSmith et al. (2019) present evidence that some portion of top private business income is wage income in disguise. Owner-managers of S-corporations have a tax incentive to misreport their income as business income rather than wages. Using detailed administrative tax data, the authors find that, on average, when a business changes its legal structure from a C-corporation to an S-corporation its labor share of sales drops by $1.95\\%$ .32  \n\nThe authors estimate that in 2012, $\\$116$ billion of aggregate S-corporation profits should have been classified as labor income. Furthermore, the authors find that misreporting likely leads to an overestimate of the decline in the labor share of 1.2pp over the period 1980 to 2012.33 Given these results, it is likely the case that my measured decline in the labor share is overstated by $1.2\\mathrm{pp}$ and my measured increase in the pure profit share is overstated by $1.2\\mathrm{pp}$  \n\n#### A.7. Entry Costs  \n\nThe measure of pure profits in this paper is gross of any entry cost that does not take the form of labor costs, investment in physical capital, or recognized investment in intangible capital. A possible explanation for the increase in pure profits is an increase in entry costs. This would be consistent with the observed decline in new firm formation documented in Decker et al. (2014).  \n\ntaken from BEA Fixed Asset Table 2.7, I construct a time series of the ratio of newly recognized IPP to total IPP and multiply this ratio by total nonfinancial corporate investment in IPP.  \n\n32 Based on heterogeneity results presented in the working paper version of Smith et al. 2019), this estimate of aggregate misreporting is upward biased. The authors find that, on average, when a business changes its legal structure from a C-corporation to an S-corporation, its labor share of salesdropsby $1.95\\%$ . This is an equal weighted average and almost all of the firms in the sample are small. When the authors break this out into large and small firms, they find no change for the large firms. While large firms are small in number, they account for a large fraction of sales. Based on 2003 IRS data (the last year with a publicly available breakdown by size), only $3\\%$ of S-corporation have over $\\$50$ million in sales, but these firms account for over $25\\%$ of all sales.  \n\n3 To account for possible diffences in the sample period, I repeat the authors? calculation for the period 1984 to 2013 (the IRS data end in 2013) and find that misreporting likely leads to an overestimate of the decline in the labor share of $1.2\\mathrm{pp}$ overthisperiod.  \n\nThe recent work of Gutiérrez, Jones, and Philippon (2019) presents a general equilibrium model to identify the causes of the increases in pure profits and industry concentration. The authors conclude that entry costs have increased and that this is the primary driver of the decline in competition.  \n\n### B.Literature Review  \n\nThere have been many recent empirical and theoretical contributions to the study of the decline in the labor share. Elsby, Hobijn, and Sahin (2013) provide detailed documentation of the decline in the U.S. labor share and Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) document a global decline in the labor share. Many possible explanations for the decline in the labor share have been put forward, including capital-augmenting technological change and the mechanization of production (Zeira (1998), Acemoglu (2003), Summers (2013), Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014), Acemoglu and Restrepo (2016)), a decline in the relative price of capital (Jones (2003), Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014)), capital accumulation (Piketty (2014), Piketty and Zucman (2014)), globalization (Elsby, Hobijn, and Sahin (2013)), a decline in the bargaining power of labor (Blanchard and Giavazzi (2003), Bental and Demougin (2010), Stiglitz (2012)), and an increase in the cost of housing (Rognlie (2015)). I contribute to this literature by documenting and studying the simultaneous decline in the shares of labor and capital and by emphasizing the role of declining competition and increasing pure profits.  \n\nPrevious studies have considered the welfare implications of the decline in the labor share. Fernald and Jones (2014), drawing on Zeira (1998), show that a decline in the labor share that is due to the mechanization of production leads to rising growth and income. Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) find that the decline in the labor share is due in part to technological progress that reduces the relative cost of capital, which leads to a substantial increase in consumer welfare, and in part to an increase in markups, which reduces welfare. The authors find that the increase in welfare due to the change in the relative price of capital is far greater than the decline that is due to the change in markups. Acemoglu and Restrepo (2016) present a model in which the labor share fuctuates in response to capital-augmenting technological change and show that in the long run, the endogenous process of technology adoption will restore the labor share to its previous level. Blanchard and Giavazzi (2003) present a model in which a decline in the bargaining power of labor leads to a temporary decline in the labor share and a long-run increase in welfare. By contrast, I find that the decline in the labor share is due to a decline in competition and an increase in pure profits, is accompanied by large gaps in output, wages, and investment, and that without a subsequent increase in competition, the labor share will not revert to its previous level.  \n\nThis paper contributes to a large literature on the macroeconomic importance of competition and pure profits. Rotemberg and Woodford (1995) provide evidence, suggesting that the share of pure profits in gross value added was close to zero in the period prior to 1987. Basu and Fernald (1997) find that U.S.  \n\nindustries had a pure profit share of sales of at most $3\\%$ during the period 1959 to 1989. Theoretic research has argued that in a setting without pure profits, there are benefits to ex-post estimates of capital costs (realized gross value added less realized labor costs) instead of ex-ante capital costs (the product of the required rate of return on capital and the value of the capital stock).34 Past empirical estimates of small economic pure profits together with the potential theoretical advantage of indirectly inferring capital costs have led many researchers to prefer the assumption of zero pure profits over the direct measurement of capital costs. Indeed, the seminal works of Jorgenson, Gollop, and Fraumeni (1987) and Jorgenson and Stiroh (2000) that measure changes in U.S. productivity do not estimate capital costs,35 and many subsequent studies follow in their path.  \n\nFinally, this paper contributes to a recent and diverse literature on declining competition. Peltzman (2014) shows that concentration, which (on average) had been unchanged from 1963 to 1982, began rising after the Department of Justice Merger Guidelines adopted Robert Bork's “Rule of Reason.\" Recent studies of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in manufacturing industries find evidence that consolidation has led to a decline in competition and consumer surplus. Kulick (2016) studies M&As in the quick-mix concrete industry and shows that horizontal mergers are associated with an increase in price and a decline in output, leading to a substantial decline in consumer surplus. Blonigen and Pierce (2016) study the effect of M&As in manufacturing industries and find that M&As are associated with increases in markups, but have little or no effect on productivity or efficiency.  \n\nRecent studies find evidence that increases in concentration and barriers to entry increase the market value of incumbent firms. Grullon, Larkin, and Michaely (2019) show that the large increase in industry concentration has been driven by the consolidation of publicly traded firms into larger entities and that firms in industries with the largest increases in product market concentration have enjoyed higher profit margins, positive abnormal stock returns, and more profitable M&A deals. Bessen (2016) provides evidence that increases in federal regulation favor incumbent firms and lead to increases in market valuations and operating margins. Bessen concludes that increases in federal regulation and political rent-seeking have increased corporate valuationsby $\\$2$ trillion and annually transfer $\\$200$ billion from consumers to firms.  \n\nIn addition to the increase in industry concentration, concentration of firm ownership is increasing. Azar (2012) documents a large increase in the concentration of ownership. Fichtner, Heemskerk, and Garcia-Bernardo (2017) find that, together, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street constitute the largest shareholder in $88\\%$ of S&P 500 firms. Recent work has linked the increase in common ownership to a decline in competition. Azar, Schmalz, and Tecu (2016) show that increases in common ownership of airlines have increased prices by as much as $10\\%$ .Azar, Raina,and Schmalz (2016) show that the increase in the concentration of bank ownership has led to higher fees, higher thresholds, and lower returns on savings.  \n\nThis paper contributes to the literature on declining competition in two ways. First, it provides an aggregate measure of pure profits. To the best of my knowledge, no such measure exists for the past three decades. Second, this paper relates the increase in industry concentration to the decline in the labor share. My empirical results suggest that the increase in industry concentration can account for most of the decline in the labor share.  \n\nThis paper is complementary to the independent and contemporaneous work of Gutiérrez and Philippon (2016) and Autor et al. (2017). Gutiérrez and Philippon (2016) show that a lack of competition and firm short-termism explain underinvestment. They find that industries with more concentration and more common ownership invest less, even after controlling for current market conditions. The authors also find that those firms that underinvest spend a disproportionate amount of free cash fows buying back their shares. Autor et al. (2017) independently discover a negative industry-level correlation between a decline in the labor share and an increase in industry concentration. Their work further uses firm-level data to provide evidence that reallocation across firms has contributed to the decline in the labor share. Taken together, the evidence shows that increases in industry concentration can explain the decline in the labor share, underinvestment, and a large increase in corporate profits. Consistent with the findings in this paper, the subsequent work of De Loecker and Eeckhout (2017) constructs firm-level markups for publicly traded U.S. firms and finds a large increase in markups since the 1980s and the subsequent work of Hall (2018) constructs industry-level markups and similarly finds a large increase in markups since the 1980s.  \n\n## VII. Conclusion  \n\nLabor compensation in the U.S. economy used to track labor productivity. Up until the 1980s, increases in labor productivity were accompanied by equally sized increases in labor compensation. The decline in the labor share since the early 1980s measures the growing gap between labor productivity (which has continued to grow) and compensation (which has stagnated).  \n\nThe existing literature on the decline in the labor share is focused on trade-offs between labor and physical capital. It argues that, whether due to technological change, globalization, or a change in relative prices, firms have replaced expenditures on labor inputs into production with expenditures on physical capital inputs into production. By contrast, this paper shows that labor costs have not been replaced by capital costs.  \n\nThis paper takes a direct approach to measuring capital costs and the capital share. Following Hall and Jorgenson (1967), I compute a series of capital costs for the U.S. nonfinancial corporate sector over the period 1984 to 2014, equal to the product of the required rate of return on capital and the value of the capital stock. This direct measure of capital costs shows that the capital share is declining.  \n\nMeasured in percentage terms, the decline in the capital share $(22\\%)$ is much larger than the decline in the labor share $(11\\%)$ . Thus, despite the decline in the labor share, labor costs have, in fact, increased faster than capital costs. Offsetting the large declines in the labor and capital shares is a large increase in the pure profit share. The increase in pure profits amounts toover $\\$1.2$ trillion in 2014, or $\\$14.6$ thousand per employee (nearly half of median personal income in the United States).  \n\nProviding additional evidence on the role of competition, I find that increases in industry concentration are associated with declines in the labor share. Taken as a whole, my results suggest that the decline in the shares of labor and capital are due to a decline in competition.  \n\nSeveral recent papers have focused attention on the increase in industry concentration. Gutiérrez and Philippon (2016) show that a lack of competition and firm short-termism explain underinvestment. Even after they control for current market conditions, they find that industries with more concentration and more common ownership invest less. The authors also find that those firms that underinvest spend a disproportionate amount of free cash fows buying back their shares. Grullon, Larkin, and Michaely (2019) show that firms in industries that are growing more concentrated enjoy higher profit margins, positive abnormal stock returns, and more profitable M&A deals. A decline in the demand for labor inputs (which results in a decline in the labor share) and a simultaneous decline in the demand for capital inputs (which results in underinvestment) are distinctive traits of declining competition.  \n\nThis paper is not arguing that technology, automation, and globalization have played no part in the decline in the labor share. It may well be the case that the forces of technological change and globalization favor dominant firms and are causing the decline in competition. The causes of the decline in competition are left as an open question for future research.  \n\nInitial submission: September 6, 2017; Accepted: March 11, 2019 Editors: Stefan Nagel, Philip Bond, Amit Seru, and Wei Xiong  \n\n### REFERENCES  \n\nAcemoglu, Daron, 2003, Labor- and capital-augmenting technical change, Journal of the European Economic Association 1, 1-37.   \nAcemoglu, Daron, and Pascual Restrepo, 2016, The race between machine and man: Implications of technology for growth, factor shares and employment, Technical report, NBER Working Paper22252.   \nAtkeson, Andrew, and Patrick J.

Firms with high innovation ability adjust their production methods and mitigate the effects of increased labor rigidity. They exhibit larger increases in process innovation and capital intensity, and larger decreases in employment and employment growth. This allows them to increase labor productivity, operating performance, and ultimately to avoid value losses. Our evidence highlights that, by facilitating the adjustment of the input mix when market conditions change, innovation ability is a key driver of firm performance.  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nFrictions in labor markets that make a firm's labor rigid and costly to adjust lead to higher production costs and operating risk. Such frictions thus hurt firm performance and value. To mitigate the impact of these frictions, firms reduce their financial leverage (Simintzi, Vig, and Volpin (2015), Serfling (2016)) or reorganize their production activity by substituting capital for rigid labor and by outsourcing production (Autor (2003), Autor, Kerr, and Kugler (2007). Importantly, it is often overlooked that to take advantage of a higher (more cost-effective) capital-labor ratio a firm must be able to develop new production methods that are appropriate for that capital-labor ratio (Jones (2005)). The ability to invent new production methods is thus critical for a firm's success in mitigating the impact of labor markets frictions on their values, yet little is known about this role of innovation empirically.  \n\nIn this paper, we examine how a firm's innovation ability shapes its conduct and performance in response to an increase in labor dismissal costs—a key source of labor rigidity that has a large impact on firms' operations and value.1 We first directly study the impact of an increase in labor dismissal costs on a firm's innovation in new cost-saving production methods. We then study how a firm's ex-ante innovation ability affects the actual adjustment of its input mix in response to increased labor rigidity and ultimately moderates the impact of higher labor rigidity on its productivity, operating performance, and value. By way of a preview, our evidence highlights that, by facilitating the adjustment of the input mix when conditions in input markets change, innovation ability is a key driver of firm performance.  \n\nUsing textual analysis of patent claims, we create novel measures of innovation that distinguish process innouations, which refer to inventions of new methods used to adjust firms production (Scherer (1982, 1984), Eswaran and Gallini (1996)) from other non-process innovations. Stilted legalistic language and the use of consistent vocabulary across firms and over time allows us to accurately distinguish patent claims that describe process innovations from those that do not. Our main measures thus count the number of process and non-process claims contained in patents filed by each firm. To account for the significant heterogeneity in patent quality, we also use citation-weighted counts of process and non-process patents. Highlighting the importance of understanding what drives process innovation, we document a significant steady increase in the share of process innovation in total innovation over time (whichreaches $32.2\\%$ in 1997, last year in our sample, and continues to increase afterwards).  \n\nWe use a difference-in-differences methodology based on the staggered adoption of the \"good faith\" exception to the common law “employment at will\" doctrine by U.S. state courts between 1973 and 1995. This doctrine gives employers unlimited discretion to fire employees at any time. The good faith exception significantly restricts this discretion because it serves as a general prohibition against firing workers without just cause and it thus opens firms to potentially costly litigation if they lay off workers (Dertouzos and Karoly (1992), Kugler and Saint-Paul (2004), Autor, Kerr, and Kugler (2007). Prior work further shows that the adoption of this exception leads to a significant increase in labor adjustment costs and operating leverage (Autor, Kerr, and Kugler (2007), Serfling (2016)).  \n\nWe find that, following the adoption of the good-faith exception, firms located in adopting states increase their process innovation by $6.1\\%$ to $8.9\\%$ relative to firms in other (non-adopting) states. This increase in process innovation becomes statistically and economically significant four years after the adoption. Further, the increase in process innovation is more pronounced in industries where labor costs account for a larger share of production costs, and thus are more impacted by the law. The adoption of the good-faith exception does not, however, materially affect non-process innovation, regardless of the industry's labor cost share. These results suggest that higher labor adjustment costs lead firms to increase their innovation efforts focused on developing new production methods.  \n\nThe evidence supports a causal interpretation of our results. First, the good-faith exception concerns firms' firing decisions rather than innovation outcomes and its recognition follows from court decisions made by independent judges in specific cases rather than from changes in state legislation that are potentially contentious. Second, in addition to firm and year fixed effects, our results hold controlling for various time-varying firm characteristics, as well as controlling for the state's business environment and political leaning. When possible, we also include state fixed effects interacted with year fixed effects, which ensures that state-specific time-varying omitted variables cannot explain our findings. Third, the pretreatment trends in the innovation of firms in treated and control states are indistinguishable. Fourth, the adoption of the good-faith exception in neighboring states does not affect a firm's innovation, suggesting that local economic shocks correlated with the adoption of the good-faith exception are unlikely to drive our results. Fifth, our results are unlikely to be driven by a differential impact across states of increased patent enforcement in the early 1980s and associated surge in patenting activity (Lerner and Seru (2017). Our results hold controlling for time-varying differences in patent filings across states, if we restrict our sample to the 1975-1990 period (which precedes the most significant surge in patenting occurred during the 1990s), or if we exclude firms in the states of California and Massachusetts (which historically harbor a large fraction of patenting firms).  \n\nAn increase in employment protection in a firm's state of headquarters can also increase the job security of its inventors employed in that state and, through this mechanism, lead them to exert more effort in innovation (Acharya, Baghai, and Subramanian (2014). If such effort was focused on processes, this rationale could explain our results. Employment contracts are typically governed by labor laws in the state where the employee works, so the adoption of the good-faith exception in a firm's state of headquarters does not affect the job security of inventors the firm employs in other states. Inconsistent with job security alone driving our results, we find that the adoption of the good-faith exception in a firm's state leads to an increase in its process innovation even if the majority of its lead inventors are located in other states or if the lead inventors are dispersed across several states.  \n\nNext, we show that firms with high ex-ante innovation ability respond to increased labor dismissal costs by developing considerably more process innovations compared to those with low ex-ante innovation ability. Non-process innovation remains largely unaffected even for high ex-ante innovation ability firms. Furthermore, consistent with our intuition that innovation ability helps firms mitigate the negative consequences of labor market rigidities, we also find that firms with high ex-ante innovation ability reduce their total employment and employment growth and increase their capital intensity. Such adjustments in production input mix are insignificant for low innovation ability firms. These results suggest that, when an increase in labor rigidity makes the labor input more costly, innovation ability facilitates the creation of process innovations which firms then deploy as new production methods.  \n\nLast, we show that the ex-ante ability to innovate and adjust production methods helps firms mitigate the adverse effects of labor market rigidities on their performance. Following the adoption of the good-faith exception, we document significant increases in the productivity of labor for high innovation ability firms. We also find that high innovation ability firms maintain their profitability and avoid market value losses when increased labor rigidity impacts their business. Low innovation ability firms fare much worse. In sum, we find that innovation ability allows firms to shield their value from labor market shocks.  \n\nOur paper advances the literature that examines how frictions in labor markets affect corporate policies and valuations. It is closely related to prior work that shows how employment protection creates operating leverage and, through this mechanism, impacts corporate investment and financing decisions (Autor, Kerr, and Kugler (2007), Simintzi, Vig, and Volpin (2015), Serfling (2016), Bai, Fairhurst, and Serfling (2019)).2 We show that employment protection leads firms to tilt their R&D toward developing process innovations in order to deploy new production methods that mitigate the impact of increased labor rigidity on firm value.3 Further, our evidence is consistent with the view in Jones (2005), who highlights that the availability of new production techniques suited for different capital-labor ratios affects firms' ability to change their input mix and thus shapes production functions.  \n\nA few prior studies examine how frictions in labor markets affect innovation. Acharya, Baghai, and Subramanian (2014) argue that employment protection incentivizes inventors to exert effort and find that the adoption of the good faith exception leads to an increase in firms' overall innovation. We distinguish between process and non-process innovation, and highlight another channel through which labor protection affects innovation, namely, the need to invent new processes that allow firms to adjust their production methods and mitigate the negative impact of labor rigidity on their values. Bradley, Kim, and Tian (2017) show that an increase in labor unionization leads to a decrease in innovation, because unions can hold up the firm and demand higher wages once the firm has incurred the sunk cost of innovation, which reduces the firm's ex-ante incentives to innovate. This suggests that different types of labor markets frictions impact firms' innovation differently. Last, Bena and Simintzi (2017) show that large U.S. multinational firms reduced their process innovation after their access to “cheap\" offshore labor improved. We instead focus on changes in the effective price of domestic labor that affect all U.S. firms, and show that employment protection boosts process innovation allowing firms to reduce their reliance on domestic labor.  \n\nA broader corporate finance literature examines what factors stimulate innovation, such as governance (Atanassov (2013), Balsmeier, Fleming, and Manso (2017)), ownership structure (Aghion, Van Reenen, and Zingales (2013), Bena et al. (2017)), organization (Lerner, Sorensen, and Stromberg (2011), Ferreira, Mans0, and Silva (2014), Seru (2014)), managerial compensation (Manso (2011), Ederer and Manso (2013)), capital structure (Atanassov, Nanda, and Seru (2007)), litigation risk (Cohen, Gurun, and Kominers (2016), corporate taxes (Mukherjee, Singh, and Zaldokas (2017), and the supply of credit (Amore, Schneider, and Zaldokas (2013). We further highlight that the distinction between process and non-process innovation might be useful in understanding on what drives innovation.  \n\nOur paper is also related to the concern and debate around the view that the introduction of new technologies which support automation will make labor redundant, leading to job displacement, lower wages, and more inequality (see Autor (2015) and Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017, 2018), among others). As noted by Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018), it is thus important to understand how the incentives for automation respond to policy intervention. Our evidence highlights that employment protection increases labor costs and thus directly affects firms' incentives and efforts to innovate in new production methods that facilitate the substitution of capital for labor, which can negate some of the intended benefits for workers. More generally, a potential unintended consequence of increased labor protection is that it could, in fact, accelerate automation and exacerbate job displacement.  \n\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses our conceptual framework and hypotheses. Section 3 discusses our measures of process and non-process innovation, the data, and our identification strategy based on Wrongful Discharge Laws. Section 4 examines the impact of labor rigidity on innovation. Section 5 focuses on how ex-ante innovation ability affects the adjustment of production methods and firm performance. Section 6 concludes.  \n\n## 2. Employment protection and new production techniques  \n\nJones (2005) notes that “production techniques” are ideas regarding how to organize production efficiently for specific capital-labor ratios. Such techniques specify a series of instructions to transform inputs into output based on that capital-labor ratio. If a firm wants to change its capital-labor ratio, this renders its original production technique obsolete and thus needs to discover a new one that is appropriate for the new capital-labor ratio. Hence, production functions represent the substitution possibilities across different production techniques, which in turn depend on the extent to which new techniques that are appropriate for different capital labor ratios are discovered. This discussion highlights that adjustments to a firm's input mix inherently require innovations in new production techniques and that the availability of such innovations constrains a firm's ability to do such adjustments.  \n\nEmbedding the production function described above into the profit maximization problem, it directly follows that changes in the relative price of production inputs incentivize firms to change their capital-labor ratios, which requires the availability of new production methods to support their new capital-labor ratios. Hence, there is a direct link between changes in the relative costs of production inputs and innovation in new production methods. This intuition dates back to John Hicks (1932), who noted that “..a change in the relative prices of the factors of production is itself a spur to invention, and to invention of a particular kind—-directed to economizing the use of a factor which has become relatively expensive..\"  \n\nConsider for example the introduction of assembly lines in automotive production in the early 1900's. High labor costs and inefficiencies in production required that profitmaximizing automakers substitute machines for workers to reduce production costs, but this was unfeasible within the “craftmanship” approach to production predominant at the time. The substitution could only be implemented using a new way to organize the production process targeted at a higher capital-labor ratio. This led to a revolutionary new production technique - the “assembly line\", which was credited to Ransom Olds (he patented the \"stationary assembly line\", and introduced it to produce the Oldsmobile Curved Dash model in his Lansing, Michigan factory in 1901) and Henry Ford (he created the “moving assembly line\", and introduced it to produce the Model T in his Lansing Park, Michigan factory in 1913). This innovation led to huge productivity gains and cost savings, including a dramatic reduction in production time while using less manpower, which translated into much lower final prices, higher production volumes, and higher profit margins for these automakers.4  \n\nIn the context of this paper, we focus on an increase in the effective price of labor (relative to capital) associated with changes in labor laws that increased employment protection (these laws and identification issues are discussed in detail in the next section). Higher labor costs induce firms to substitute capital for labor and thus require innovation in new techniques to support higher-capital labor ratios. This leads to our hypothesis that increases in employment protection lead firms to invent new cost-saving production methods that allow firms to substitute capital for labor. Further, the discussion above suggests that firms with greater innovation ability are better able to implement the required substitution of capital for labor and thus to mitigate the impact of higher labor costs on their profitability.  \n\n## 3. Process vs. other innovation, innovation measures, identification, and data 3.1 Process vs. non-process innovation  \n\nThe conceptual distinction between process and other (non-process) innovation is at the heart of our conceptual framework, empirical tests, and interpretation of the results. Prior literature highlights that process innovation refers to a new way to produce an existing good and aims to improve a firm's own production methods to lower its production costs (Scherer (1982, 1984), Link (1982), Cohen and Klepper (1996), Eswaran and Gallini (1996)). In contrast, non-process innovation generally refers to inventions sold to others, such as new or improved products that the firm aims to sell to either final consumers or other firms.  \n\nAn example of process innovation is the “assembly line” (discussed in Section 2), which led to many related patents after the original idea. A recent one (published in 2005) is Ford Motor's patent “Manufacturing assembly line and a method of designing a manufacturing assembly line\"(US20050044700A1), which contains “A method of designing a manufacturing process line. A process is identified as a set of discrete steps. A subset of steps is assigned to one of a plurality of standardized work cells. The work cells include a standardized workpiece presenter and a standardized processing tool. Additional subsets of discrete steps are assigned to a standardized work cell until the design for the manufacturing process is completed.\"  \n\nOther examples of Ford's process innovation include “Wheel manufacture\" (US3859704A), granted in 1975, which describes “a process for the production of vehicular wheels and finds particular utility in wheels in which a steel rim must be united to a magnesium or aluminum spider. The aluminum or magnesium spider is united to the steel rim by a combination of adhesive action and metal interlocking since steel is essentially unweldable to either aluminum or magnesium.\" and “Method For Motor Vehicle Interior Climate Control\" (US20170144505A1), describing “A method for climate control for an interior of a motor vehicle includes acquiring climatically relevant data of the interior and/or surroundings of the vehicle, creating a thermodynamic model of a vehicle climate system I...], the model including I...], introducing into the interior a quantity of air having a temperature different from an existing interior temperature [further details omitted].\"  \n\nExamples of Ford's non-process patented innovation include “Motor vehicle body mount\" (US3622194A), granted in 1971, describing “A body mount for connecting a motor vehicle body part to a motor vehicle frame..[description of body mount omitted]\", and various patents grated in 2018 such as “Airbag for oblique vehicle impacts\" (US9963101B2), describing “An airbag system includes an inflator and an airbag in communication with the inflator. [further details omitted]\", its “Head rest with a compartment for a travel pillow\"(US10093205B2), its \"Keyless vehicle door latch system with powered backup unlock feature\" (US20180051493A1), and its “Direct injection fuel pump\" (US10006426B2), among others.  \n\nThe adoption of new processes might require innovation in new equipment that supports the new processes. For example, Ford's patent “Methods and systems for assisted direct start control\" (US20170341637A1) first describes “A method of controlling a vehicle system including an engine that is selectively shut-down during engine idle-stop conditions, comprising: .. Ifurther details omitted]\" and then \"A vehicle system, comprising: a powertrain including wheels, an engine, a torque converter having a lock-up clutch, and an automatic transmission including a forward clutch; wheel brakes; and a control system configured to selectively shut-down the engine during engine idle-stop conditions ...Ifurther details omitted]\". Process innovation can also aid subsequent non-process innovation by the same or other firms in related fields. For example, Ford Motor's process patent granted in 1975 “Wheel manufacture\" (US3859704A) discussed above is cited by subsequent non-process patents, such as ITT Corp's “Aluminum alloy motorcycle wheel having an extruded rim shrink fitted and resin bonded to a die cast hub-spoke unit\"(US4256348A) granted in 1981.  \n\n### 3.2 Distinguishing process and non-process innovation in patent filings  \n\nOur main dependent variables are designed to separately measure a firm's patented process and non-process innovation output and are extracted from the texts of patent grants. To this end, we rely on the critical defining element of a patent: the list of specific “claims\". The claims define - in technical terms - what subject matter the patent protects and the scope of protection conferred. For this reason, the list of specific claims in a patent is the primary subject of examination in patent prosecution and crucial in patent litigation cases.  \n\nAs in Bena and Simintzi (2017), we obtain full texts of all utility patents awarded by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) from January 1976 to December 2012. We then parse the texts and extract the section that contains the list of patent claims. Finally, we use standard text analysis techniques and unambiguously distinguish claims within each patent as either process or non-process claims. This is aided by the very legalistic and stilted language used in drafting claims, e.g., process claims always refer to “A method for ..\" or “\"A process for ..\" (or minor variations), followed by a verb (typically in gerund form). For example, the list of 23 claims in Ford's patent “Method of assembling a vehicle from preassembled modular components\" (US6493920B1) reads “1. A method of assembling a vehicle, the method comprising; . [full description omitted]\", “2. The method of claim 1 wherein the roof panel is made of material selected from the group consisting of aluminum and magnesium.\", and all remaining claims also begin “The method of claim...\".  \n\nTo see how the standardized legal language used in patent filing allows us to accurately distinguish process claims from non-process claims, note that the most frequent bigrams of words in process claims that do not appear among the top 1,0o0 bigrams of words in nonprocess claims are (in order of frequency): “compris-step\",“method-compris\",“said-method\", \"process-prepar\", “process-compris\", “step-provid, “aqueous-solut\", “step-form\", “alkalimetal\", “effect-amount\", “process-produc\", “method-produc\",“method-manufactur\", “compriscontact\", “method-form\", and “method-make\".5 See Bena and Simintzi (2017) for more detail.  \n\n### 3.3 Matching of patents to firms and measures of process and non-process innovation  \n\nTo match patent filings to firms in Compustat we follow Bena, Ferreira, Matos, and Pires (2017). We first search each patent grant document and identify the names of patent assignees, the country of these assignees, and whether each assignee is a U.S. corporation, a non-U.S. corporation, an individual, or a government body. Using this information, we then match patents to firms in Compustat. Our matching algorithm involves two main steps. First, we standardize patent assignee names and firm names, focusing on unifying sufices and dampening the non-informative parts of firm names. Second, we apply multiple fuzzy string matching techniques to identify the firm, if any, to which each patent belongs.6  \n\nWe measure a firm's annual process and non-process innovation in two ways. The first approach exploits our ability to break down each and every patent filing into the individual process and non-process claims it contains. We compute a firm's Process Claims by summing the number of process claims contained in all of its patent filings in each year. Similarly, we compute a firm's Non-Process Claims by summing the number of non-process claims contained in all of its patent filings in each year. We set both variables to zero for firm-years with no patent filings. The advantage of these measures is that they capture all process and non-process innovation patented by a firm. However, they ignore differences in the quality of innovations protected by each specific claim in a patent, because there are no claim-level indicators of quality (e.g., citations are for entire patents and not for individual claims).  \n\nOur second approach uses the number of citations received by each patent to account for the differences in the scientific merit of innovations (Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg (2001, 2005), Jaffe and Trajtenberg (2002)). To ensure a clear distinction between process and nonprocess innovations, we focus on patents that contain only process claims (Process Patents) or only non-process claims (Non-Process Patents), but not both.7 C-W Process Patents is the citations-weighted number of process patents and C-W Non-Process Patents is the citationsweighted number of non-process patents filed by a firm in each year, respectively. We set both measures to zero for firm-years with no process or no non-process patents.  \n\n### 3.4 Wrongful discharge laws as a source of exogenous variation in labor dismissal costs  \n\nTo estimate the causal effect of labor dismissal costs on firms' process and non-process innovation, we use a difference-in-differences approach based on the variation in these costs associated with the staggered adoption of “wrongful discharge laws\" by U.S. state courts in the late 1970s and the early 1990s. Prior work extensively discusses these laws and their economic significance as a source of exogenous variation in labor dismissal costs (Dertouzos and Karoly (1992), Miles (2000), Kugler and Saint-Paul (2004), Autor, Donohue, and Schwab (2004, 2006), Autor, Kerr, and Kugler (2007). Recently, Acharya, Baghai, and Subramanian (2014) and Serfling (2016) further validate this setting for identification purposes.  \n\nThe legal framework regarding worker dismissals prevailing at the beginning of the 1970s was centered around the common law doctrine of “employment at will\". This doctrine sustained a legal presumption that employers could fire workers at will, i.e., “for good cause, bad cause, or no cause\" (a quote from Payne vs. Western & Atlantic Railroad, Supreme Court of Tennessee, 1884), which gave employers unlimited discretion in firing workers. Between 1973 and 1995, courts in 46 states set new legal precedents recognizing three exceptions to employment at will usually referred to as “wrongful discharge laws\". These exceptions significantly limited employers' discretion to fire workers, opened them to potentially costly litigation, and generated uncertainty about when employers could terminate workers with impunity. The survey of public firms managers conducted by Dertouzos, Holland, and Ebener (1988) indicated that $46\\%$ of managers feared potential losses arising from such lawsuits, while Jung (1997) and Boxold (2008) document economically significant awards to plaintiffs.  \n\nThe key legal change we use to gauge an increase in labor dismissal costs is the adoption of the “good-faith exception\"to the employment at will doctrine by state courts. This exception represents an implied covenant to terminate employment only in good faith and fair dealing, which essentially prevents employers from firing workers for any “bad cause\". The good-faith exception represents the largest deviation from at-will employment and is the most far reaching. It gives employees both a contract and a tort cause of action in the event they are dismissed, allowing them to seek compensation for both contractual losses and emotional distress, as well as punitive damages that imply highly uncertain amounts. Importantly, it serves as a general prohibition against terminating any worker without just cause (economic necessity or poor performance) and thus could have sweeping consequences (Dertouzos and Karoly (1992), Kugler and Saint-Paul (2004), and Autor, Kerr, and Kugler (2007)).  \n\nState courts adopted two other exceptions to the employment at will doctrine during this period that had less impact on firms. We include them as control variables in our analyses. One is the “implied-contract exception\", which protects workers from discharges when there is an implicit promise that the firm will not fire workers without good cause.8 The other is the “public-policy exception\", which protects workers against discharges that would thwart an important public policy, such as, performing jury duty, filing a worker's compensation claim, reporting an employer's wrongdoing, or refusing to commit perjury.9  \n\nPrior work highlights that the adoption of good-faith exception significantly increases hiring and firing costs, ultimately increasing labor adjustment costs and operating leverage. Using plant-level data from the Census Bureau, Autor, Kerr, and Kugler (2007) show that the adoption of this exception reduces employment volatility, both in the intensive (withinplant) and the extensive (plant entry/exit) margins.1o Further, in a sample of public firms, Serfling (2016) shows that it leads to a reduction in the volatility of employment and in the likelihood that a firm fires workers when its earnings decrease; it also leads to an increase in the elasticity of changes in earnings to changes in sales and in the volatility of profits.  \n\nThe adoption of the good-faith exception is unlikely to be driven by changes in economic or political conditions in the state that could be correlated with firms' incentives to innovate. It occurs in judiciary decisions by state courts and not through a potentially contentious legislative process in the state. The judges are independent and largely immune to political pressure from interested parties, and thus base their decisions on the merits of the specific case. Further, Walsh and Schwarz (1996) document three key reasons why judges adopt these exceptions: enhancing fairness in employment relationships, assuring consistency with established principles of contract law, and following similar rulings in other states. Last, Acharya, Baghai, and Subramanian (2014) and Serfling (2016) show that the adoption of the good-faith exception is not driven by changing political conditions, economic conditions, or in other labor regulation in the state, and that such rulings were not anticipated. Hence, it provides plausibly exogenous variation in employment protection in our study of innovation.  \n\n### 3.5 Data and variables  \n\nThe sample spans the period 1975-1997 and is based on the publicly traded firms in the Compusat dataset. As in Bloom, Schankerman and Van Reenen (2013), it includes all nonfinancial and non-utility firms headquartered in the U.S. that filed at least one patent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) during this period, for a total of 44,898 firm-year observations. The Appendix contains full definitions of all variables. The corresponding summary statistics are in Table 1 and are similar to those in related studies.  \n\nTo merge the wrongful discharge laws indicators and other state level variables into our dataset, we rely on a firm's historical state of headquarters.ll To this end, we use the \"company header history” file in the legacy CRSP/Compustat Merged database. This file provides, for each firm, the time frame for each verified historical state of headquarters and allows us to accurately track changes in the headquarter state over time. When this information is missing for a particular year, we use the firm's next or last verified state of headquarters if available. In this way, we obtain the historical state of headquarters for $75\\%$ of the observations in our sample. The remaining $25\\%$ of observations correspond to firms with no data available in the company header history file. Most these firms have the last reporting year in Compustat between 1975 and 1990 and especially in the early part of our sample. For these firms, we use the state of headquarters reported in the “company header file\", which is the state of headquarters as of the firm's last reporting year. For these firms, the last recorded headquarter state we use is close in time to most of their observations.12  \n\nFigure 1 shows that, together with an overall increase in the total number of claims (process and non-process) during our sample period (which mirrors the increase in patenting documented in prior studies), there is a steady increase in the share of process innovation. For the average firm in our sample, the share of process claims in total claims was $24.5\\%$ over the entire sample period, but this share rose steadily from $19.5\\%$ in 1975 (first year in our sample)to $32.2\\%$ in 1997 (last year in our sample). Although outside our sample period, this trend continued in subsequent years, leading to a share of almost $40\\%$ in 2010. Hence, process innovation is becoming an increasingly important component of overall innovation.  \n\nIn Panel A of Table 2, we examine which industries account for the bulk of process innovation. We report the share of each two digit SIC industry in the total number of process claims contained in all patents 0ver the period 1975-97 as well as the subperiods 1975-80, 1981-85, 1986-90, and 1991-97. Manufacturing industries account for the majority of process innovation, with Chemicals & allied products (SIC 28), Electronic & electrical equipment (SIC 36), and Machinery & computer equipment (SIC 35) at the top of this list, although communications (SIC 48) and business services (SIC 73) account for a sizeable fraction as well. Interestingly, some industries have increased their shares in process innovation over the years (SICs 36, 35, 38, and 73) and some have decreased their shares (SICs 28, 29, and 33), while the shares of other industries remained largely unchanged (SIC 37, 48, and 26).  \n\nIn Panel B, we examine the importance of process innovation relative to total innovation for the same industries identified in Panel A. Specifically, we report the shares of process claims in the total number of (process and non-process) claims contained in all patents for the period 1975-97 as well for the subperiods 1975-80, 1981-85, 1986-90, and 1991-97. Over our entire sample period, process innovation accounts for a large fraction of patented innovation in those industries that generate the bulk of process innovation. In all of these industries process innovation accounts for at least a quarter of the innovation in the industry and in some (petroleum refining, primary metal industries, business services) it accounts for about half. Importantly, consistent with the aggregate trend, for most industries there is a large and steady increase in the share of process innovation over the years.  \n\n## 4. Results  \n\n### 4.1 Econometric specification  \n\nTo identify the effect of wrongful discharge laws on process and non-process innovation, we estimate the following difference-in-differences specification:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{y_{i,s,t}=\\beta_{1}G o o d F a i t h_{s,t}+\\beta_{2}I m p l i e d C o n t r a c t_{s,t}+\\beta_{3}P u b l i c P o l i c y_{s,t}}}\\ {{+\\delta X_{i,s,t-1}+\\alpha_{i}+\\mu_{t}+\\varepsilon_{i,s,t}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwere $i$ denotes firm, $s$ denotes the firm's state of headquarters, and $t$ denotes year. The dependent variables $y$ are Log(1 + Process Claims), Log(1 + Non-Process Claims), $L o g(1+C.$ W Process Patents), and Log( $1+C$ W Non-Process Patents). The three indicator variables for whether the state recognizes the corresponding exception to the employment at will doctrine are Good Faith, Implied Contract, and Public Policy, respectively. The vector $X$ includes lagged firm-level control variables (Log(1 + Patent Stock), Log(1 + R&D Stock), $L o g(S a l e s)$ and $L o g(M/B))$ and state-level control variables (State GDP Growth and State Political Balance). As in Bloom, Schankerman and Van Reenen (2013), we control for differences in a firm's stock of knowledge using lagged patent stock and lagged R&D stock, as well as for other relevant firm characteristics. Further, the inclusion of the state-level control variables alleviates concerns that changes in a state's economic conditions or political environment correlated with both the adoption of wrongful discharge legislation and innovation could confound our inferences. Last, ai is a firm fixed effect, which controls for firm characteristics that do not vary over our sample period, and $\\upmu\\mathrm{{t}}$ is a year fixed effect, which absorbs timevarying shocks affecting all firms. In all specifications, standard errors are clustered by state.  \n\nOur empirical approach is aided by the staggered adoption of wrongful discharge laws, which allows us to use a time-varying control group that provides a counterfactual for how firms' innovation would have evolved in the treated states had they not adopted such legislation. The key coefficient of interest is $\\upbeta_{1}$ , which gauges the causal effect of the adoption of the good-faith exception on innovation. This coefficient captures the change in innovation for firms in adopting (treated) states relative to the contemporaneous change in innovation for firms in non-adopting (control) states. The causal interpretation hinges on the parallel trends assumption that the pre-treatment trends in innovation are the same for both treated and control groups. We provide timing tests in support of this assumption in Section 4.2.  \n\n4.2 Impact of labor dismissal costs on process vs. non-process innovation  \n\nTable 3 reports the results of pooled (panel) OLS regressions that implement our main difference-in-differences approach discussed in Section 4.1. We report specifications with and without control variables. The inclusion of control variables helps alleviate the concern that differences between firms in treatment and control states could confound our inferences given the lack of truly random assignment to these groups. However, it is conceivable that some of these variables (in particular the firm-level controls) could be affected by the adoption of wrongful discharge laws and bias our estimates. Hence, both specifications are useful in assessing the causal effect of wrongful discharge laws on innovation.  \n\nIn Panel A, the dependent variables are $L o g(1+P r o c e s s C l a i m s)$ in columns (1)-(2) and $L o g(1+C\\cdot$ -W Process Patents) in columns (3)-(4). The adoption of the good-faith exception leads to a statistically significant increase in the process innovation of firms in adopting states relative to that of firms in non-adopting states both in specifications with and without control variables. This effect is also economically significant: In models without control variables, process innovation increases by $13.4\\%$ when measured by process claims and it increases by $9.1\\%$ when measured by citations-weighted process patents. When we include the control variables the magnitudes decrease to $8.9\\%$ and $6.1\\%$ ,respectively.  \n\nIn Panel B, the dependent variables are Log(1 + Non-Process Claims) in columns (1)-(2) and $L o g(1+C\\cdot$ W Non-Process Patents) in columns (3)-(4). Consistent with the possibility that the introduction of new production methods might sometimes require supporting non-process innovation (or generate it as a by product), the estimated effect of the adoption of the good faith exception on non-process innovation is positive. However, it is statistically insignificant at conventional levels in three out of the four specifications and only marginally significant in specification (3). Importantly, the effect of Good Faith on non-process innovation is much smaller in economic magnitude than its effect on process innovation reported in Panel A.  \n\nOverall, the results in Table 3 provide strong support for the hypothesis that labor market rigidities that increase the effective price of labor lead firms to tilt their innovation efforts toward developing new production processes. Consistent with the discussion in Section 3.4 and prior evidence that the good-faith exception places the greatest rigidities on labor markets, we find no effect of the other two exceptions on firms' process or non-process innovation. Hence, we include Implied Contract and Public Policy in all subsequent analyses, but in the remainder of the paper we focus attention on the good-faith exception.  \n\nWe also examine the dynamics of the differences in Process Claims and in Non-Process Claims between treated and control firms around the adoption of the good-faith exception. To this end, we use empirical models analogous to those in columns 2 and 4 of Table 3 but replace Good Faith by the indicator variables Good Faith -3, Good Faith -2, Good Faith -1, Good Faith O, Good Faith $+\\boldsymbol{l}$ , Good Faith $+2.$ Good Faith $+3$ Good Faith $+4.$ . and Good Faith $5+$ . These are indicator variables equal to one if the firm's state of headquarters will adopt the exception in three years, with adopt it in two years, will adopt it the following year, adopted it in the current year, adopted it the year before, adopted it two years before, adopted it three years before, adopted it four years before, and adopted it five or more years before, respectively. The estimated coefficients of these indicator variables measure the differences in the process (non-process) innovation of treated and control firms in years -3, -2, -1, 0, $+1$ ， $+2,+3,+4$ , and $5+$ , where year O is the year the good-faith exception is adopted.  \n\nThe results of these tests are in Figures 2a (process claims) and 2b (non-process claims). Figure 2a shows that there is no statistically or economically significant difference in the process innovation of firms in treated and control states prior to the adoption of the goodfaith exception. This evidence is consistent with the parallel-trends assumption behind our difference-in-differences identification. The figure also suggests that the increase in the process innovation of treated firms manifests gradually over time. It starts two years after the adoption and ultimately leads to a statistically and economically significant persistent difference in process innovation between treated and control firms four years after the adoption (the coefficients of Good Faith $+4$ andGoodFaith $^{5+}$ statistically significant at the $5\\%$ level). This pattern is consistent with a reasonable lag between the shift in the focus of firms' innovation efforts at the time ofthe adoption and the actual patenting of new processes. Figure 2b shows that there are no differences in the non-process innovation of firms in treated and control states in the years before or after the adoption of the good-faith exception.  \n\nTo better understand what drives the results in Figure 2a, in Figure 3 we plot the levels of process innovation separately for treated and control firms around the adoption of the good-faith exception. To this end, we proceed in three steps. First, we retain the variation in Process Claims that is unexplained by firm fixed effects and year fixed effects (i.e., we adjust it by removing time-invariant differences across firms and time trends common to all firms). Second, for each adoption event, we construct a dataset of treated firms (in the adopting state) and control firms (in never adopting states) over the years -3 to $+10$ relative to the adoption year for the treated state (year O). We require that firms are in the data in both year $^{-1}$ and year O. Third, we pool all events together in to a single dataset in event time, going from year -3 to year $+4$ and then years $5+$ (averaging Process Claims over the years $+5$ to $+10$  \n\nFigure 3 shows that the process innovation of firms in control states remains fairly constant over the years $^{-3}$ to $5+$ . This indicates that changes in the process innovation of firms in the control group do not explain the dynamics of the differences in the process innovation of treated and control firms illustrated in Figure 2a. The process innovation of firms in treated states remains stable and is significantly below the innovation of the control group between years -3 and $+3$ around the adoption of the good-faith exception. However, the innovation of treated firms markedly increases in the fourth and subsequent years after the adoption of the good-faith exception, leading to a higher level of process innovation than for control firms. In sum, Figure 3 shows that our main results are clearly driven by a surge in the process innovation of firms in states that adopted the good-faith exception.  \n\n### 4.3 The effect of Good Faith on innovation and the role of the industry labor cost share  \n\nTo further examine what drives the impact of higher labor dismissal costs on innovation, we ask whether the effect of the adoption of the good-faith exception on innovation is related to the importance of labor costs in the industry's cost structure. Firms' incentives to invent new cost-saving production processes are likely to be greater in industries for which labor costs account for a larger fraction of production costs, since in those industries labor costs are more important drivers of profitability and value. If higher labor adjustment costs drive the observed increase in process innovation documented in Table 3, the adoption of the good-faith exception should have a larger impact on process innovation in such industries.  \n\nTo investigate this issue, in Table 4 we augment our main specification to include LaborCostShr and GoodFaith $\\times$ LaborCostShr, where LaborCostShr is the labor cost share of the firm's 3-digit SIC industry (see the Appendix for details on the construction of this variable). To facilitate the interpretation of the estimated coefficients, LaborCostShr is standardized to have mean zero and standard deviation of one before forming the interaction. In all regression models, we include the same control variables as in Table 3. We consider a specification with firm fixed effects and year fixed effects and another one with firm fixed effects and state fixed effects interacted with year fixed effects. In the latter, we fully control for any unobservable time-varying state-level factors that could confound our results.  \n\nThe results in columns (1)-(4) show that the adoption of the good-faith exception leads to a larger increase in process innovation in industries for which labor costs account for a larger share of production costs: The coefficient of Good Faith $\\times$ LaborCostShr is positive and statistically significant, both when we measure process innovation using process claims in columns (1)-(2) or citations-weighted process patents in columns (3)-(4), as well as for specifications with firm fixed effects and year fixed effects (columns (1) and (3) and specifications with firm fixed effects and state fixed effects interacted with year fixed effects (columns (2) and (4)). The estimates imply that, in industries whose LaborCostShr is onestandard deviation higher than the sample mean, the increase in process innovation is 5.9 to 6.7 percentage points larger when process innovation is measured by process claims and 5.3 to 5.9 percentage points larger when it is measured by citations-weighted process patents. The results in columns (5)-(8) show that the recognition of the good-faith exception has no effect on non-process innovation, regardless of the share of labor costs in total costs in the firm's industry: The coefficients of Good Faith and of Good Faith $\\times$ LaborCostShrare generally positive but statistically insignificant in all four regression specifications.  \n\nOverall, the results in Table 4 provide evidence that an increase in labor dismissal costs leads firms to increase their efforts to develop new cost-saving process innovation as they seek to mitigate the impact of increased labor rigidity on their operations. They also highlight the likely reason why non-process innovation is unaffected, that is, non-process innovation does not aim to improve production methods to reduce costs as required by the treatment.  \n\n### 4.4 Alternative explanations  \n\nIn Table 5, we examine if our main results could be due to unobserved changes in local economic conditions that drive both the passage of wrongful discharge laws and the increase in process innovation. To this end, we augment our main specification in Table 3 to include Good Faith Neighbor, which is an indicator variable equal to one if a “neighboring state\" (adjacent to the firm's state of headquarters) has adopted the good-faith exception by year $t$ and zero otherwise, alongside with Good Faith. If economic conditions that are common to bordering states drive the results, then we should see an increase in process innovation for firms in states that do not adopt the legal change but share a common border with adopting states. However, in columns (1)-(2) we find no effect of Good Faith Neighbor on a firm's process innovation measured by process claims or by citations-weighted process patents, while the coefficient of Good Faith remains positive and statistically significant. Columns (3)- (4) further show no effect of Good Faith Neighbor on a firm's non-process innovation.  \n\nLerner and Seru (2017) caution that a stronger enforcement of patent rights since the early 1980s led to a surge in patenting activity that may have differentially affected innovation across states. Specifically, stronger patent rights could have differentially impacted geographically-clustered fields of innovation,  causing differential trends in innovation across states that could confound our inferences. To alleviate this concern, in Table 6 we use various approaches to control for these possible patterns in the data.  \n\nIn Panel A, we focus on process innovation, measured by process claims in columns (1)- (3) and citations-weighted process patents in columns (4)-(6). First, in columns (1) and (4) we add the (lagged) logarithm of the mean number of patents filed by other firms located in the firm's state, Log(State Patents). The estimated effect of Good Faith on process innovation is very similar to that in the baseline results. Second, in columns (2) and (5) we repeat the analysis over the 1975-1990 period, that is, the period before the explosive growth in patents observed post 1990, which occurred with different intensities across states. Despite the lower statistical power associated with a smaller sample and set of events, the coefficient of Good Faith remains statistically and economically significant. Last, in column (3) and (6) we exclude from the sample two states, California and Massachusetts, which showed the highest patent growth over our sample period and account for a large share of patenting activity in the U.S. Again, the estimated coefficient of Good Faith remains positive and significant. Panel B repeats the same analyses using the two non-process innovation measures as the dependent variables, but the coefficient of Good Faith remains statistically insignificant in all tests. Overall, we find that our results are robust to the concerns outline above.  \n\nIn Table 7, we investigate another potential mechanism through which the adoption of the good-faith exception in a firm's state of headquarters could lead to an increase in the firm's process innovation. The adoption of this exception in the firm's state of headquarters increases job security not only for the firm's production workers (the focus of our conceptual arguments), but also for the firm's inventors employed in that state. Increased job security of a firm's inventors employed at headquarters can incentivize them to exert more effort in their innovation activities (Acharya, Baghai, and Subramanian (2014). If such additional effort is largely focused in developing new processes, this mechanism could explain our results. 13  \n\nWe analyze the text of each patent filing and extract the state of the lead inventor's business address. This allows us to identify patents for which the lead inventor is employed in a state other than the firm's state of headquarters. For such inventors, their job security is generally unaffected by the adoption of the good-faith exception in the firm's state of headquarters, because their employment contracts with the firm are typically signed under the labor laws of the state where they actually work. More generally, the job security argument applies to inventors that are directly employed by the firm, but does not apply to lead inventors working for the firm under temporary contracts but permanently employed in other institutions, for example, at universities, that are often located in other states.  \n\nOur tests are thus based on the importance of the location of a firm's inventors. Specifically, whether lead inventors are employed in the firm's state of headquarters or in other states is crucial to the job security mechanism: The effect of Good Faith on process innovation should be weaker when the firm's inventors are employed in other states and thus unlikely to experience an increase in their job security. In contrast, the mechanism we highlight is that increased employment protection in a firm's state of headquarters (where most of its production workers are located) incentivizes the firm to develop cost-saving process innovation. In this view, the state in which the firm's inventors are located is unimportant and should be unrelated to the impact of Good Faith on process innovation.  \n\nIn Panel A, we examine whether the impact of Good Faith on process innovation depends on the location of the firm's inventors. To this end, we augment our main specification to include interactions of Good Faith with two indicator variables. The first is equal to one if morethan $50\\%$ of the lead inventors listed in all patents the firm applied for in a given year are located outside the firm's state of headquarters and zero otherwise (Majority Inventors Outside). The second is equal to one if no state concentrates more than $50\\%$ of thelead inventors listed in all patents the firm applied for in a given year and zero otherwise (Disperse Inventors). In columns (1)-(4) the dependent variable is based on process claims and in columns (5)-(8) it is based on citations-weighted process patents. We consider a specification with firm fixed effects and year fixed effect and another with firm fixed effects and state fixed effects interacted with year fixed effects. The estimated coefficients of Good Faith $\\times$ Majority Inventors Outside and Good Faith $\\times$ Disperse Inventors are statistically insignificant in all eight specifications we consider. For completeness, Panel B reports the results of analogous tests for non-process innovation. Again, the coefficients on both interactions are statistically insignificant. In sum, increased inventor job security is unlikely to be the driver of our results.  \n\n### 4.5 Robustness and additional tests  \n\nWe now discuss the results of two additional tests that help assess the robustness of our main results in Table 3. These results are reported in tables A1-A2 of the Online Appendix.  \n\nFirst, in Table A1 we examine the robustness of our results based on citations-weighted patents (columns (3)-(4) in both panels of Table 3) to the choice of the weighting scheme. In columns (1)-(2) and (5)-(6) we instead use raw (unweighted) patent counts (Process Patents and Non-Process Patents). In columns (3)-(4) and (7)-(8) we use market value-weighted counts (V- W Process Patents and V-W Non-Process Patents) from Kogan et. al. (2017). The results in columns (1)-(4) continue to indicate a positive and statistically significant impact of the adoption of the good-faith exception on process innovation. Compared to the analogous results in Panel A of Table 3, the coefficient of Good Faith is smaller in magnitude when the dependent variable is not weighted and similar when it is value weighted. The results on non-process innovation in columns (5)-(8) are also consistent with those reported in Panel B of Table 3. Once the control variables are included in the regressions, there is not statistically significant impact of the adoption of the good-faith exception on non-process innovation. Further, the coefficients of Good Faith are positive but smaller than for process innovation.  \n\nIn Table A2, we restrict attention to firm-years with at least one process or non-process patent and examine the impact of Good Faith on the share of process innovation in the firm's total (process and non-process) innovation computed in four alternative ways: using the number of claims of each type (Process Share in Claims), the number of citations-weighted patents of each type (Process Share in C-W Patents), the number of unweighted patents of each type (Process Share in Patents), and the number of value-weighted patents of each type (Process Share in V-W Patents), respectively. The regression specifications are analogous to those in Table 3. Across all specifications, we find that the adoption of the good-faith exception leads to a statistically significant increase in the share of process innovation. The estimated coefficients of Good Faith in the specifications with control variables indicate that the share of process innovation increases by 2.1 percentage points when the dependent variable is Process Share in Claims (or $8.6\\%$ relative to the sample mean for this variable) and by 3.0 percentage points when the dependent variable is Process Share in C-W Patents (or $15.1\\%$ relative to the sample mean for this variable). The results based on Process Share in Patents and Process Share in V-W Patents are very similar: The share of process innovation increases by $15.7\\%$ and $15.8\\%$ relative to the sample mean of these variables, respectively.  \n\n# 5. Innovation ability, adjustment of production methods and firm performance  \n\nThe discussion in Section 2 highlights the importance of a firm's ex-ante innovation ability in adjusting to changing conditions in input markets and thus as a source of value. To adjust its input mix in response to changes in relative input prices, a firm must be able to develop new production methods that permit the organization of production around a new (more cost effective) capital-labor ratio. Without such ability, changes in the input mix are hard to implement. We thus examine whether firms with greater ex-ante innovation ability exhibit greater adjustments of their production methods and input mix in response to increased labor dismissal costs and how such ability ultimately affects firms' performance.  \n\nFollowing Bloom and Van Reenen (2002), our measure of ex-ante innovation ability is a firm's stock of patents (also referred to as “stock of knowledge\" in the economics literature). Although firms do not necessarily patent all their inventions, this measure is likely also a good proxy for a firm's innovation ability in general, including innovations the firm might choose to keep as trade secrets rather than patent. To the extent that non-patented process innovation might also be important in facilitating changes in the input mix, the evidence in this section can be interpreted as dealing with a firm's ability to innovate more broadly.  \n\nIn Table 8, we examine how a firm's ex-ante innovation ability affects the response of its innovation to an increase in labor adjustment costs. To this end, we augment our regressions of process and non-process innovation on Good Faith to include an interaction of Good Faith with the firm's lagged stock of patents $L o g(1+P a t e n t S t o c k)$ , which is standardized to a mean of zero and standard deviation of one.14 We also include all the control variables in our main specification reported in Table 3. We consider a specification with firm fixed effects and year fixed effects and another with firm fixed effects and state fixed effects interacted with year fixed effects. Columns (1)-(4) report the results for the two measures of process innovation and columns (5)-(8) report those for the two measures of non-process innovation.  \n\nThe estimated coefficient of $\\cdot G o o d F a i t h\\times L o g(1+P a t e n t S t o c k)$ is positive and statistically significant in columns (1)-(4). These results imply that, relative to a firm with the stock of patents at the sample mean, for firms with a one-standard deviation above the sample mean stock of patents, the adoption of the good-faith exception leads to an increase in process innovation that is $8.1\\%$ to $9.8\\%$ higher when measured with process claims and $15.1\\%$ to $15.5\\%$ when measured with citations-weighted process patents. The estimated coefficient of Good Faith $\\times$ Log(1 + Patent Stock) is statistically insignificant in all specifications that use non-process innovation as the dependent variables (columns (5)-(8)). The results suggest that high innovation ability firms choose to develop new processes to facilitate the introduction of new production methods when labor adjustment costs increase.  \n\nIn Table 9, we examine how a firm's ex-ante innovation ability allows firms to adjust their employment and capital intensity in response to the adoption of the good-faith exception in their states. We consider four alternative dependent variables: the annual percentage change in employment, Employment Growth, in columns (1)-(2); the level of employment, Log(Employment), in columns (3)-(4); the capital-labor ratio, $L o g(K/L)$ , in columns (5)-(6); and capital expenditures per employee, $L o g(C a p e x/E m p)$ , in columns (7)-(8). As in Table 8, we include Good Faith and Good Faith × Log(1 + Patent Stock) and all control variables in the regressions, and we consider specifications with firm fixed effects and year fixed effects and also with firm fixed effects and state fixed effects interacted with year fixed effects.  \n\nThe coefficient of Good Faith is negative when the dependent variables are employment growth and employment level, and positive when the dependent variables are the capitallabor ratio and capital expenditures per employee. This suggests that the typical firm (with $L o g(\\boldsymbol{\\mathit{1}}+P a t e n t\\:S t o c k)$ at the sample mean) reduces employment and substitutes capital for labor, but the coefficients are all statistically insignificant. The striking result is that the coefficients of $G o o d F a i t h\\times L o g(1+P a t e n t S t o c k)$ are statistically for all dependent variables, indicating that firms with higher innovation ability exhibit more pronounced adjustments of their input mix following the adoption of the good faith exception. A firm with a one-standard deviation above the sample mean stock of patents experiences a one percentage point larger decrease in employment growth, a $6.7\\%{-}7.9\\%$ larger decrease in employment, a $6.7\\%{-}7.4\\%$ larger increase in the capital-labor ratio, and a $9.1\\%{\\cdot}10.1\\%$ larger increase in the capital expenditures per employee (relative to a firm with stock of patents at the sample mean).  \n\nIn Table 10, we ask if the impact of the adoption of the good-faith exception on a firm's labor productivity, operating performance, and equity value depends on its ex-ante ability to innovate. The dependent variables are labor productivity measured using by sales per employee, $L o g(S a l e s/E m p)$ , operating performance measured by operating income before depreciation scaled by assets, Profit, and shareholder value measured by the market-to-book equity ratio, $L o g(M E/B E)$ . The key explanatory variables of interest are Good Faith and GoodFaith $\\times L o g(1+P a t e n t S t o c k)$ . The control variables include the two other wrongful discharge laws indicators as well as firm and state level factors (all defined in the Appendix). We consider specifications with firm fixed effects and year fixed effects and those with firm fixed effects and state fixed effects interacted with year fixed effects.  \n\nIn columns (1)-(2), the dependent variable is $L o g(S a l e s/E m p)$ . Consistent with the typical firm (with $L o g(\\boldsymbol{1}+P a t e n t\\:S t o c k)$ at the sample mean) taking measures to boost labor productivity, we find a positive but small and statistically insignificant coefficient of Good Faith. Importantly, the coefficient of Good Faith $\\times L o g(1+P a t e n t S t o c k)$ is positive and statistically significant in both specifications. A firm with innovation ability one-standard deviation above the sample mean increases its labor productivity by an extra $5.9\\%{\\cdot}6.9\\%$ after the adoption of the good-faith exception, relative to a firm with innovation ability at the sample mean.15 This evidence is consistent with that in Dinlersoz and Wolf (2018), who use the Census Bureau's Survey of Manufacturing Technology to report that more automated establishments are less production labor intensive and exhibit greater productivity of labor.  \n\nIn columns (3)-(4), the dependent variable is Profit. The coefficient of Good Faith in column (3) is negative as expected but small and statistically insignificant. Thus, the increase in labor rigidity has little impact on the profitability of a firm with innovation ability at the sample mean. The key result is that the coefficient of $G o o d F a i t h\\times L o g(1+P a t e n t S t o c k)$ is positive and statistically significant in both specifications. Hence, firms with greater ex-ante innovation ability exhibit better operating performance when labor dismissal costs increase. The estimates in column (3) imply that the adoption of the good faith exception leads to a 0.6 percentage-point increase in the profitability of firms with innovation ability one-standard deviation above the sample mean, relative to a firm with innovation ability at the mean.  \n\nLast, in columns (5)-(6), we use $L o g(M E/B E)$ as the dependent variable to examine how a firm's ex-ante innovation ability ultimately shields shareholder value when labor dismissal costs increase. The coefficient of Good Faith reported column (5) suggests a negative effect of increased labor rigidity on the equity value of a firm with innovation ability at the sample mean as expected, but it is statistically insignificant. Importantly, in both specifications the coefficients of $G o o d F a i t h\\times L o g(1+P a t e n t S t o c k)$ are positive, statistically significant. The estimates in column (5) imply that a firm with innovation ability one-standard deviation above the sample mean experiences a $4.5\\%$ increase in its equity value after the adoption of the good-faith exception, relative to a firm with innovation ability at the sample mean.  \n\nIn sum, the results in Table 10 suggest that, through the process innovation mechanism we describe, high innovation ability firms are better able to boost the productivity of their labor and to maintain their profitability, ultimately avoiding economically significant value losses when increased labor rigidity hurts their business. More generally, our evidence thus highlights that innovation ability is a key determinant of a firm's success in adjusting to changing conditions in input markets and, ultimately, a key driver of firm value.  \n\n## 6. Conclusions  \n\nOur evidence highlights that increases in labor rigidity steer firms’ innovation activities toward process innovation that facilitates the required adjustment of production methods - a substitution of capital for labor - and thereby mitigates the negative effects of such rigidity on firm value. More broadly, our paper suggests that high innovation ability allows firms to more easily adjust their strategies when business conditions change and that, through this mechanism, innovation ability is a key driver of firms performance.  \n\nFrom a public policy point of view, we highlight the unintended (or at least not fully understood) consequences of labor regulation that aims to benefit employees. Labor laws that increase employment protection or otherwise make labor costlier ultimately lead firms to take actions to mitigate the impact of these laws on their performance. This can negate some of the benefits of employment protection sought by the regulation. Author (2003) documents an increase in outsourcing. We highlight another mechanism, namely, a change in corporate R&D policy toward introducing production methods that are less reliant on labor inputs.  \n\nOur study also stresses the importance of distinguishing different types of innovation. Prior studies examine the impact of regulatory changes on overall innovation, but such changes do not have to affect all types of innovation in the same way. The new measures of process innovation we develop in this paper can thus aid future research that seeks to understand the determinants of innovation.  \n\n## References  \n\nAcemoglu, D., and P.

The data is constructed in three steps. First, using the sample in our main tests, we retain the variation in Process Claims that is unexplained by firm fixed effects and year fixed effects (i.e., we adjust the original variable by removing time-invariant differences across firms and time trends common to all firms). Second, for each adoption event, starting from our main sample, we construct a panel dataset of treated firms (in the adopting state) and control firms (in never adopting states) over the time frame -3 to $+10$ years relative to the adoption year for the treated state (year O). We require that firms are in the data in both year $^{-1}$ and year 0. Third, we pool all events together in to a single dataset in event time, going from year -3 to year $+4$ and then years $^{5+}$ (averaging Process Claims over the years $+5$ to $+10$  \n\nThe sample spans the period 1975-1997. It includes all non-financial and non-utility firms headquartered in the U.S. that filed at least one patent with the USPTO during this period and for which we can compute the key variables. All variables are defined in the Appendix.  \n\nTable 1: Summary Statistics   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Mean</td><td>Sd.

We show it is essentially related to the capital-output ratio; that this relationship is shifted by factors like the price of imported materials or capital-augmenting technological progress; and that discrepancies between the marginal product of labor and the real wage —due to, e.g., labor adjustment costs or union wage bargaining—- cause departures from it. We also provide empirical evidence on the determinants of the labor share with panel data on 13 industries and 12 countries for 1972-93.  \n\nKEYWORDS: Labor share, capital-output ratio  \n\n### 1 Introduction  \n\nIn this paper we explore the factors driving the observed movements in the labor share in OECD countries. Until recently, the labor share did not often generate an interest among neoclassical economists, partly because its constancy has been taken as a granted “stylized fact of growth\".1 On the other hand, the labor share is very much present in the political debate as a measure of how the “benefits of growth\" are shared between labor and capital. For example, its decline since the mid-1980s is often used by unions in Europe as an argument against policies of wage moderation, and by governments in order to justify increased taxation of profits. Moreover, contrary to economists’ presumptions, there have been considerable medium-run movements in the labor share over a period of 35 years, as shown in Figures 1 to 4 for several countries. For these reasons, it is important to understand the determinants of the labor share, which is the purpose of this paper.  \n\nIt is striking to find, in Figures 1 to 4, that there are large cross-country differences in the behavior of the labor share.2 The UK exhibits the closest approximation to the “growth stylized fact\", with the labor share experiencing large short-run fuctuations around a stable level.? In the US it undergoes sizable short-run fuctuations around a mild downward trend, becoming essentially fat in the 1980s. In Japan, on the contrary, it experiences a sharp rise, slowing down considerably after 1975. The picture for continental Europe is typically hump-shaped, with the labor share going up and then down. But actual country experiences are heterogeneous: in Germany and France the labor share peaks in the early 1980s, while in other countries like Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain it does so in the mid-1970s.4  \n\nIt should be noted that the large differences across countries take place even though they are relatively similar from a technological point of view. Table 1 shows the evolution of the labor share in the business sector of 12 OECD countries for 1970 to 1990.5 As evidenced by the first three columns, the labor share has not converged among these countries during the 1980s (the standard deviation has actually increased). In 1990, some countries like Finland or Sweden showed labor shares around 72%, while others like France, Germany or Italy had values around $62\\%$  \n\n5Later years would show similar patterns. Again, our sectoral data in Section 3 stop in 1993.  \n\n![](images/4b0ff4062ed52973a4d73673850c08c8d102f76d92b3dd8679b9dd968e763b97.jpg)  \nFIGURE 2.

The labor share corresponds to the business sector, the real wage is the real compensation per employed person in the private sector. It includes an imputed labor remuneration for the self-employed on the basis of the average wage. Source: OECD Economic Outlook Statistics on Microcomputer Diskette.  \n\nIn the policy debate, movements in the labor share are often interpreted as changes in real wages. It is for example usually heard that because the labor share is currently low in Europe, there is no real wage problem. But this is clearly mistaken, since it all depends on the elasticity of labor demand. The last two columns of Table 1 suggest that the correlation between changes in wages and changes in the labor share is not tight (in other words, labor productivity behaves differently across countries). For example, from 1970 to 1990 France had one of the sharpest drops in the labor share and an above-average increase in the average real wage, while Sweden had one of the largest increases in the labor share and one of the lowest increases in real wages.6 Thus, a more systematic exploration of the determinants of the labor share is warranted.  \n\nWhat can we learn from analyzing the labor share? It provides a compact way of looking at labor demand which directly controls for the role of factors such as wages, labor-embodied technical progress, and capital (or, alternatively, real interest rates). We shall show that, as long as labor is paid its marginal product, there should be a one-for-one relationship between the labor share and the capital-output ratio, which we label the share-capital schedule. As long as that condition holds —and it must in long-run equilibrium—\\~ changes in any of those three factors will generate changes of both the labor share and the capital-output ratio along that schedule. Any change in the labor share which shows up as a deviation from that relationship must arise from a shift in labor demand which is not due to real wages, capital accumulation, or labor-augmenting technical progress, and therefore has to be explained by other factors. We study the role of factors which displace the schedule, such as changes in the price of imported materials or capital-augmenting technical progress, and those which put the economy off the schedule, by changing the gap between the shadow marginal cost of labor and the wage, such as changes in markups of prices over marginal costs, union bargaining power, or labor adjustment costs.  \n\nWe also analyze the empirical performance of the model, using panel data on a sample of 13 industries in 12 OECD countries, over the period 1972-93. We estimate the relationship between the labor share and a number of its presumed determinants according to the model. In our estimation we follow Arellano and Bover's (1995) proposal of a system estimator for panel data. We find evidence in favor of an empirical relationship between the labor share and the capital-output ratio, but also significant shifts of the labor share coming from technical progress and, less clearly, the real price of oil, and from variables proxying for factors which create a wedge between the shadow marginal cost of labor and the wage, like labor adjustment costs and, marginally, union bargaining power.  \n\nThe paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents a model of the determination of the labor share. After introducing the stripped-down model, which yields the key relationship between the labor share and the capital-output ratio, we show how the relaxation of various assumptions may affect such a relationship. Section 3 presents empirical evidence with international panel data. Section 4 contains our conclusions.  \n\n### 2 Theory  \n\nWe start by sorting out, from an analytical point of view, the various factors which may explain variations in the labor share.  \n\n#### 2.1 The labor share and the capital-output ratio  \n\nWhen trying to explain variations in the labor share we need to depart from the usual assumption of a Cobb-Douglas production function. We show that under the assumptions of constant returns to scale and labor embodied technical progress, there are strong restrictions on the behavior of the labor share, in the sense that there should be a one-for-one relationship between it and the capital-output ratio. We then explore how this relationship shifts if there is capital-augmenting technical progress and we end the subsection showing the results for a constant elasticity of substitution production function.  \n\nProposition 1 Consider an industry indeced by i. Assume it has a constant returns to scale, differentiable production function by which output, $Y_{i}$ , is produced with two factors of production, capital, $K_{i}$ , and labor, $L_{i}$ .Assume there is labor-augmenting technical progress, $B_{i}$ $Y_{i}=F(K_{i},B_{i}L_{i})$ . Then, under the assumption that labor is paid its marginal product, there ecists a unique function $g$ such that:  \n\n$$\ns_{L i}=g\\left(k_{i}\\right)\n$$  \n\nwhere $s_{L i}\\equiv w_{i}L_{i}/(p_{i}Y_{i})$ is the labor share in industry $i$ ，with $w_{i}$ denoting the wage and $p_{i}$ the product price, and $k_{i}\\equiv K_{i}/Y_{i}$ is the capital-output ratio.  \n\nPROOF. Let us use the constant returns property to rewrite the production function as $Y_{i}=K_{i}f(B_{i}L_{i}/K_{i})=K_{i}f(l_{i})$ ,where $l\\equiv B_{i}L_{i}/K_{i}$ . In equilibrium we have:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{w_{i}}{p_{i}}=B_{i}f^{\\prime}(l_{i})\n$$  \n\nwhere the prime denotes the first derivative, implying that the labor share is equal to:  \n\n$$\ns_{L i}=\\frac{B_{i}L_{i}f^{\\prime}(l_{i})}{K_{i}f(l_{i})}=\\frac{l_{i}f^{\\prime}(l_{i})}{f(l_{i})}\n$$  \n\nThe capital-output ratio is then equal to:  \n\n$$\nk_{i}=\\frac{1}{f(l_{i})}\n$$  \n\nAs $f(.)$ is monotonic, Equation (4) defines a one-to-one relationship between $l_{i}$ and $k_{i}$ ,whichcan be written $l_{i}=h(k_{i})=f^{-1}(1/k_{i})$ . Substituting into (3), we find that  \n\n$$\ns_{L i}=k_{i}h(k_{i})f^{\\prime}(h(k_{i})),\n$$  \n\nwhich defines $s_{L i}$ as a sole function of $k_{i}$ .Q.E.D  \n\nProposition 1 tells us that even if the production function is not Cobb-Douglas, there is a stable relationship between the labor share and an observable variable, the capital-output ratio. From now on, we shall refer to this relationship as the share-capital( $S K$ ) schedule (or curve). This relationship is unaltered by changes in factor prices —e.g. wages or interest rates— or quantities, or in labor-augmenting technical progress. That is to say, any change in the labor share which is triggered by those factors will be along that schedule, so that they cannot explain any deviation fromthe $S K$ relationship, i.e. any residual in equation (1).  \n\nNote that equations (1) and (3) capture essentially the same relationship, but equation (1) is simpler to estimate, since it does not require the computation of $l_{i}$ which itself requires us to compute labor-augmenting technical progress, $B_{i}$ .Our aim is thus to decompose changes in the labor share between those explained by the capital-output ratio —due to changes in factor prices and labor-augmenting technical progress— and those explained by the residual —-i.e., due to other factors discussed below.  \n\nIt is worth noting that the response of the labor share, $s_{L i}$ , to the capital-output ratio, $k_{i}$ , is related to the elasticity of substitution in the production function between labor and capital. The latter is defined as (see Varian, 1984, p. 70):  \n\n$$\n\\sigma_{i}=\\frac{d(K_{i}/L_{i})}{d(r/w)}\\frac{r/w}{K_{i}/L_{i}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $K_{i}/L_{i}$ is the cost-minimizing input mix and $r/w$ the relative cost of capital. With the production function in Proposition 1 we find that  \n\n$$\n\\sigma_{i}=\\frac{f^{\\prime}(l_{i})}{l_{i}f^{\\prime\\prime}(l_{i})}\\left[1-\\frac{l_{i}f^{\\prime}(l_{i})}{f(l_{i})}\\right].\n$$  \n\nwhere the double prime denotes a second derivative. As is well known, for a CobbDouglas production function, $f(l_{i})=(l_{i})^{\\alpha}$ ,wehave $\\sigma_{i}=-1$ . Equations (3) and (4) imply that  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d s_{L i}}{d k_{i}}=-f(l_{i})+l_{i}f^{\\prime}(l_{i})-\\frac{l_{i}f(l_{i})f^{\\prime\\prime}(l_{i})}{f^{\\prime}(l_{i})}=-(1+\\sigma_{i})f(l_{i})\\frac{l_{i}f^{\\prime\\prime}(l_{i})}{f^{\\prime}(l_{i})}=-\\frac{1+\\sigma_{i}}{k_{i}\\eta_{i}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\eta_{i}=f^{\\prime}(l_{i})/(l_{i}f^{\\prime\\prime}(l_{i}))<0$ is the elasticity of labor demand with respect to wages, holding capital constant. Thus, a positive coefficient in a regression of $s_{L i}$ on $k_{i}$ indicates an elasticity of substitution $\\sigma_{i}$ lower than one in absolute value, and vice-versa. In other words, a strong complementarity between labor and capital means that an increase in the capital-output ratio is associated with a larger labor share.  \n\nProposition 1 will however not hold under capital-augmenting technical progress. In this case we have $Y_{i}=F(A_{i}K_{i},B_{i}L_{i})$ , and the relationship between $s_{L i}$ and $k_{i}$ is no longer stable. We can check that  \n\n$$\ns_{L i}=A_{i}k_{i}g(A_{i}k_{i})f^{\\prime}(g(A_{i}k_{i})),\n$$  \n\nis the expression for the labor share instead of (5). Clearly, changes in $A_{i}$ now shift the $S K$ relationship. The assumption of labor-augmenting technical progress is standard in macroeconomics, since it is compatible with a balanced long-term growth path, but the possibility of having capital-augmenting technical progress must be considered as well.  \n\nUnder capital-augmenting technical progress productivity shifts do affect the $S K$ curve, but in a way which, if it can be measured, implies a strong restriction. As $A_{i}$ alwaysmultiplies $k_{i}$ in (6), we must have:  \n\n$$\nk_{i}\\frac{d\\ln s_{L i}}{d k_{i}}=A_{i}\\frac{d\\ln s_{L i}}{d A_{i}}.\n$$  \n\nThis is a restriction with respect to the regression coefficients of $s_{L i}$ on $k_{i}$ and $A_{i}$ It may be difficult to test, as $A_{i}$ is often measured by an index, and as that index will aggregate labor-augmenting with capital-augmenting technical change. However, one corollary of the restriction is that the effects of $A_{i}$ and $k_{i}$ on $s_{L i}$ should have the same sign.7 Therefore, if $A_{i}$ shifts $S K$ but violates that condition, it is neither labor- nor capital-augmenting. In such a case, we can just write $Y_{i}=K_{i}f(l_{i},A_{i})$ ， and the inclusion of $A$ , or some measure of it, in a regression of $s_{L i}$ on $k_{i}$ will yield the following coefficients:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{\\displaystyle\\frac{d\\ln s_{L i}}{d k_{i}}}&{=}&{-\\displaystyle\\frac{f}{k_{i}f_{l_{i}}}\\left(\\frac{1}{l_{i}}-\\frac{f_{l_{i}}}{f}+\\frac{f_{l_{i}l_{i}}}{f_{l_{i}}}\\right),}\\ {\\displaystyle\\frac{d\\ln s_{L i}}{d A_{i}}}&{=}&{-\\displaystyle\\frac{f_{A_{i}}}{l_{i}f_{l_{i}}}-\\frac{f_{A_{i}}f_{l_{i}l_{i}}}{(f_{l_{i}})^{2}}+\\frac{f_{A_{i}l_{i}}}{f_{l_{i}}},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $f_{x}$ denotes the frst derivative with respect to variable $x$ and $f_{x y}$ the second derivative with respect to variables $x$ and $y$  \n\nAn interesting implication of these formulae is that, given that $f_{l_{i}}~>~0$ and $f_{A_{i}}>0$ , in order to have $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{d\\ln s_{L i}}{d k_{i}}>0}\\end{array}$ and $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{d\\ln s_{L i}}{d A_{i}}<0}\\end{array}$ , which is the case in some of our estimates below, we must have  \n\n$$\n\\frac{f_{A_{i}l_{i}}}{f_{A_{i}}}<\\frac{1}{l_{i}}+\\frac{f_{l_{i}l_{i}}}{f_{l_{i}}}<\\frac{f_{l_{i}}}{f},\n$$  \n\nwhich makes it more likely (though by no means necessary) that technical progress is “labor-harming\", i.e. reduces the marginal product of labor, $f_{A_{i}l_{i}}<0$  \n\nTo illustrate Proposition 1 more concretely, let us consider what happens when the production function has a constant elasticity of substitution (CES):  \n\n$$\nY_{i}=(\\alpha(A_{i}K_{i})^{\\varepsilon}+(1-\\alpha)(B_{i}L_{i})^{\\varepsilon})^{1/\\varepsilon}\n$$  \n\nwhere $A$ ， $B$ and $\\varepsilon$ are technological parameters.  \n\nThen the labor share is equal to:  \n\n$$\ns_{L i}=\\frac{\\left(1-\\alpha\\right)\\left(B_{i}L_{i}\\right)^{\\varepsilon}}{\\alpha\\left(A_{i}K_{i}\\right)^{\\varepsilon}+\\left(1-\\alpha\\right)\\left(B_{i}L_{i}\\right)^{\\varepsilon}}.\n$$  \n\nNote that when $\\varepsilon$ goes to zero, the production function converges to a Cobb-Douglas One, $Y_{i}=(A_{i}K_{i})^{\\alpha}(B_{i}L_{i})^{1-\\alpha}$ , and the labor share converges accordingly to $s_{L i}=$ $1-\\alpha$ . Next, the capital-output ratio is simply equal to:  \n\n$$\nk_{i}=\\left(\\frac{K_{i}^{\\varepsilon}}{\\alpha\\left(A_{i}K_{i}\\right)^{\\varepsilon}+\\left(1-\\alpha\\right)\\left(B_{i}L_{i}\\right)^{\\varepsilon}}\\right)^{1/\\varepsilon}\n$$  \n\nfrom equations (8) and (9) we have (where $k$ is such that $s_{L}\\in[0,1]$ 9  \n\n$$\ns_{L i}=1-\\alpha(A k_{i})^{\\varepsilon}\n$$  \n\nWe therefore see that the relationship between $s_{L i}$ and $k_{i}$ is very simple in this case. It is monotonic in $k_{i}$ , either increasing or decreasing depending on the sign of $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ if labor and capital are substitutes ( $\\varepsilon<0$ ), a lower capital intensity will increase the labor share, and conversely if they are complements ( $\\varepsilon>0$ ); in the Cobb-Douglas case, $\\varepsilon=0$ and $s_{L i}=1-\\alpha$ . For more general production functions, the relationship need not be monotonic, so that the labor share can go up and then down as some variable driving changes in $k_{i}$ (such as real wages or interest rates) varies.  \n\n#### 2.2  Deviations from a stable SK relationship  \n\nWe now analyze the factors that generate deviations from this relationship. To do so, let us define more precisely the $S K$ curve in equation (1), as a relationship between $k=1/f(l)$ and $\\eta\\equiv l f^{\\prime}(l)/f(l)$ , the employment elasticity of output.10 Then the economy is on the $S K$ curve in the $(k,s_{L})$ plane if and only if $s_{L}=\\eta$ ,i.e. the marginal product of labor is equal to the real wage. We shall distinguish between two types of deviations, depending on whether they cause shifts of the $S K$ curve, i.e. shifts in the $g(.)$ function in equation (1), or movements $o f f$ it, i.e. increases in the difference between $s_{L}$ and $\\eta$  \n\nFirst, as discussed in the previous subsection, factors such as capital-augmenting technical progress, $A$ , will shift the $S K$ curve if they are not constant. Secondly, there are factors which create a wedge between the real wage and the marginal product of labor. While they do not affect the relationship between $\\eta$ and $k$ , they create a gap between $s_{L}$ and $\\eta$ . These factors therefore do not shift the $S K$ curve, but put the economy off that schedule in the $(k,s_{L})$ plane. These two sources of movements are illustrated in Figure 5. Let us now discuss each type of deviation in detail.  \n\nLabor share (s.)  \n\n![](images/d5663d352d30cc600d36bd34ed6c33133068adc9dcd09a8664d077295eea5954.jpg)  \n\nA： Initial position of the economy A': Increase in wages A\": Change in the price of oil A\"\": Increase in the markup  \n\nCapital-output ratio (k)  \n\n#### 2.3  Non-neutralities in the aggregate production function  \n\nWe first discuss deviations which shift the $S K$ schedule by changing the aggregate production function in a non-labor-augmenting way.11 For instance, what happens if there are imported raw materials whose price fuctuates? Unless very restrictive conditions hold, these fluctuations will shift the $S K$ schedule, in a direction which will depend on the characteristics of the production function. Let us assume that we have $Y=F(K,B L,M)$ ，where $M$ denotes imported raw materials (say oil), with price $q$ . This can be rewritten as $Y=K f(l,m)$ ，with $l\\equiv B L/K$ , as above, and $m\\equiv M/K$ $L$ and $M$ are set so as to maximize profits. The first order conditions are:  \n\n$$\nB f_{l}(l,m)=\\frac{w}{p};f_{m}(l,m)=\\frac{q}{p}\n$$  \n\nValue added is defined as (see Bruno and Sachs 1985, Appendix 2B, for a discussion): $\\tilde{Y}\\equiv Y-(q/p)M$ , and the $S K$ curve is now a relationship between $\\widetilde{s}_{L}$ ， the share of labor in value added given by $\\tilde{s}_{L}\\equiv w L/(p\\tilde{Y})$ ,and $\\tilde{k}\\equiv K/\\tilde{Y}$ ,the capital-value added ratio. We now have, instead of (4):  \n\n$$\n\\tilde{k}=\\frac{1}{f(l,m)-\\frac{q}{p}m}\n$$  \n\nimplying:  \n\n$$\n\\widetilde s_{L}=\\frac{l f_{l}(l,m)}{\\widetilde k}\n$$  \n\nEquations (11) and (12) now define $l$ and $m$ as functions of $\\tilde{k}$ and $q/p$ . Plugging these into equation (13) we get a relationship where $\\widetilde{s}_{L}$ is a function not only of $\\tilde{k}$ but also of $q/p$ . Let us examine the implications of this extension for both the elasticity of substitution and the impact of changes in $q/p$ on $\\widetilde{s}_{L}$  \n\nWe can now recall the Allen elasticity of substitution between $K$ and $L$ as:  \n\n$$\n\\sigma_{K L}=\\frac{\\partial(K/L)}{\\partial(r/w)}\\frac{r/w}{K/L},\n$$  \n\nwhere the derivative is taken holding $q$ constant (N.B.: we normalize $p$ to $1$ ).We therefore get:  \n\n$$\n\\sigma_{K L}=\\frac{f_{l}}{l\\left(f_{l l}-\\left(f_{l m}\\right)^{2}/f_{m m}\\right)}\\left[1-\\frac{l f_{l}}{f-m f_{m}}\\right].\n$$  \n\nThe response of $\\tilde{s}_{L}$ on $\\tilde{k}$ holding $q$ constant is equal to:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial\\tilde{s}_{L}}{\\partial\\tilde{k}}}&{=}&{l f_{l}-(f-q m)-l f_{l l}(f-q m)/f_{l}+\\displaystyle\\frac{l\\left(f_{l m}\\right)^{2}}{f_{m m}f_{l}}(f-q m)}\\ &{=}&{-(1+\\sigma_{K L})l(f-q m)\\left[\\displaystyle\\frac{f_{l l}}{f_{l}}-\\displaystyle\\frac{\\left(f_{l m}\\right)^{2}}{f_{l}f_{m m}}\\right]=-\\displaystyle\\frac{\\left(1+\\sigma_{K L}\\right)}{\\tilde{k}\\eta},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nWhere n = I(fu-(fim)/fmm) is the elasticity of $l$ with respect to $w$ , holding $q$ constant. In Section 3 we will compute $\\sigma_{K L}$ , using our estimates and relying on external estimates of $\\eta$  \n\nTo grasp the effects at work when $q/p$ increases, we can differentiate equations (11) to (13), to get the change in the labor share holding $\\tilde{k}$ constant:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\widetilde{s}_{L}}{d(q/p)}=\\frac{1}{\\widetilde{k}}\\left(m+\\frac{l f_{l m}}{f_{m m}}+\\frac{l m}{f_{l}f_{m m}}\\left(f_{l l}f_{m m}-(f_{l m})^{2}\\right)\\right)\n$$  \n\nwhere $f_{l l}f_{m m}-(f_{l m})^{2}>0$ is the Hessian of the production function.  \n\nThe first term in the brackets of (15) is positive; it is due to the fact that to maintain a constant ratio between capital and value added as materials prices rise, the labor-capital ratio must rise, which pushes the labor share upwards. The second term is typically negative as long as imported materials increase the marginal product of labor. It measures the fact that given $l$ , imports fall when $q/p$ increases, which reduces the marginal product of labor and therefore wages and the labor share. The third term is also negative. It captures the fall in wages induced by the required increase in the labor capital ratio (taking into account the indirect effect of the induced effect on $m$ ). Thus, the price of raw materials shifts the $S K$ schedule in an ambiguous direction.  \n\nTo illustrate this, let us look again at the CES case. Assume the production function:  \n\n$$\nY=((A K)^{\\varepsilon}+(B L)^{\\varepsilon}+(C M)^{\\varepsilon})^{1/\\varepsilon}\n$$  \n\nwhere $A$ $B$ $C$ , and $\\varepsilon$ are the technological parameters. The labor share is then:12  \n\n$$\n\\widetilde{s}_{L}=1-(A/C)^{\\varepsilon}\\left(C^{\\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\varepsilon-1}}-(q/p)^{\\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\varepsilon-1}}\\right)^{\\varepsilon-1}\\widetilde{k}^{\\varepsilon}\n$$  \n\nWe can thus in principle take into account the impact of changes in the price of imported materials on the labor share by estimating (16) or a linearized variant of it. Note that the $S K$ schedule will shift upwards when $q/p$ rises if and only if $\\varepsilon>0$ The more labor is a substitute for capital ( $\\varepsilon<0$ ), the lower the wage fall required to increase $l$ so as to maintain $\\tilde{k}$ constant when imported materials fall, and the larger the increase in the labor share.  \n\n#### 2.4  Differences between the marginal product of labor and the real wage  \n\nWe now turn to those factors that put the economy off the $S K$ curveby generating a gap between the marginal product of labor and the real wage. We consider three of them: product market power, union bargaining, and labor adjustment costs.  \n\n#### 2.4.1  Variations in the markup  \n\nAssume firms are imperfectly competitive, so that there is a markup $\\mu$ ofprices on marginal costs. Accordingly, the optimality condition (2) should be replaced with:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial L}=B f^{\\prime}(l)=\\mu\\frac{w}{p}\n$$  \n\nso that we now have:  \n\n$$\ns_{L}=\\mu^{-1}\\frac{l f^{\\prime}(l)}{f(l)}=\\mu^{-1}\\eta\n$$  \n\nimplying a relationship such as $s_{L}=\\mu^{-1}g(k)$ . Clearly, if the markup is constant, there should still be a stable relationship between $s_{L}$ and $k$ . However, variations in the markup will affect that relationship and will show up in the residual. For example, if markups are countercyclical, the labor share will tend to be procyclical once we have controlled for $k$  \n\nNote that the above relationships are actually used by macroeconomists in order to compute the markup (see Hall, 1990, Rotemberg and Woodford, 1991 and 1992, and Bénabou, 1992). From our point of view, this is unfortunate: many deviations of the labor share from the predicted $S K$ schedule may be due to factors other than the markup. Ideally, one would want to correlate these deviations with direct measures of the markup. In their survey on the cyclical behavior of markups, Rotemberg and Woodford (1999) actually discuss various sources of deviation. For instance, they allow for materials in the production function, but assume that they are a fixed proportion of aggregate output.13  \n\nRecall now Figure 5, which summarizes the discussion up to this point. It depicts the $S K$ curve in the $(k,s_{L})$ plane, showing that increases in wages imply movements along the curve, but changes in the price of materials cause shifts of the curve itself, while variations in the markup put the economy off the schedule.  \n\n#### 2.4.2 Bargaining  \n\nAnother source of deviations from the $S K$ curve is the existence of bargaining between firms and workers. Indeed, increases in the labor share are customarily interpreted as increases in workers’ bargaining power, and it is often hastily concluded that employment consequently has to decline. The issue is more complicated, though, because everything depends on what bargaining model is assumed.  \n\nRight-to-manage Under this model, firms and unions first bargain over wages and then firms set employment unilaterally, taking wages as given. This model is widely seen as a good description of how bargaining actually takes place in many countries (see Layard et al., 1991, ch. 2). But then, because firms are wage takers when setting employment, the marginal product equation (2) remains valid, and so does Proposition 1. Under this model, changes in the bargaining power of workers may move the labor share, but along the $S K$ curve, not away from it, in a direction which depends on the elasticity of substitution between labor and capital (see equation (1o) for the CES case). More specifically, an increase in workers’ bargaining power creates a wage push that increases $k$ as firms substitute capital for labor. But the labor share may rise or fall depending on the slope of the $S K$ curve (i.e. the elasticity of substitution between labor and capital), and the relationship between $k$ and $s_{L}$ is unaffected.14  \n\nEfficient bargaining If, on the other hand, frms and workers bargain over both wages and employment, they will set employment in an efficient way, implying that the marginal product of labor is equal to its real opportunity cost $(\\bar{w}/p)$  \n\n$$\nB f^{\\prime}(l)=\\frac{\\bar{w}}{p}\n$$  \n\nIn the short run, an increase in the bargaining power of workers affcts the labor share but is not reflected in employment. In the long-run, adjustment of the capital stock indeed implies that changes in the bargaining power of workers also affects employment.  \n\nHow does efficient bargaining affect the position of the economy in the $\\left(k,s_{L}\\right)$ plane? In a simple Nash bargaining model the wage is a weighted average of the average product of labor and its opportunity cost, with the weight on the former being equal to workers' bargaining power, $\\theta$ (see Blanchard and Fischer, 1989, ch. 9):  \n\n$$\n\\frac{w}{p}=\\theta\\frac{B f(l)}{l}+(1-\\theta)\\frac{\\bar{w}}{p}\n$$  \n\nThis in turns implies that $w/p=\\theta\\left(B f(l)/l\\right)+(1-\\theta)B f^{\\prime}(l)$ , hence (recalling the definitions of $s_{L}$ and $l$  \n\n$$\ns_{L}=\\theta+(1-\\theta)\\frac{l f^{\\prime}(l)}{f(l)}=\\theta+(1-\\theta)\\eta=\\theta+(1-\\theta)g(k)\n$$  \n\nThis is a well-defined relationship between the labor share and the capital-output ratio. It has the same properties as the $S K$ curve, but is above it, reflecting that workers are paid more than their marginal product. As $\\eta<1$ , an increase in workers' bargaining power shifts that relationship upwards, putting the economy further off the $S K$ curve: the labor share tends to increase given the capital-output ratio. The latter is unchanged, as it is pinned down by the equality between marginal product and the alternative wage. Thus the labor share unambiguously increases. Increases in workers’ bargaining power reduce the sensitivity of the labor share to the capital-output ratio according to this relationship. For example, in the CES case we get:  \n\n$$\ns_{L}=1-(1-\\theta)\\left(A k\\right)^{\\varepsilon}\n$$  \n\n#### 2.4.3 Labor adjustment costs  \n\nWe now consider how the introduction of labor adjustment costs alters the $S K$ relationship. This is of interest for analyzing European countries, whose regulation imposes high hiring and firing costs. Adjustment costs affect the behavior of the labor share for two reasons. First, the labor share is no longer equal to wages divided by value added. Labor costs now consist of two parts: wage costs and non-wage adjustment costs. The adjustment costs will enter the labor share if they are a resource cost which uses labor —for example if new hires have to be recruited by an employment agency, or if they have to be trained by the firm's existing workforce, thus diverting it from direct productive activity. They will also enter the labor share if they are payments from the firm to the worker, as is the case for severance payments. Other components of firing costs such as court and arbitration procedures will have a strong labor cost component.  \n\nSecond, adjustment costs create a gap between the marginal revenue product of labor and the wage, which is no longer equal to the relevant marginal cost of labor. More precisely, the marginal cost now includes three terms: the current wage, the current marginal adjustment cost generated by an extra unit of labor, and the shadow expected future marginal adjustment costs generated by that unit. Let us discuss the latter two in turn.  \n\nThe second component will push the marginal cost of labor above the wage when the firm is hiring and below it when it is firing. More specifically, if we assume that real labor adjustment costs are a convex function $A C\\left(\\Delta L\\right)$ ,where $\\Delta L$ is the change in employment, and if the future is neglected (say because the discount rate tends to infinity), we have that $B f^{\\prime}(l)=w+A C^{\\prime}(\\Delta L)$ ，where $A C^{\\prime}(\\Delta L)>0$ if $\\Delta L>0$ and $A C^{\\prime}(\\Delta L)<0$ if $\\Delta L<0$ (see, e.g., Bentolila and Bertola, 1990). If adjustment costs are not part of the labor costs included in the labor share, this implies that $s_{L}>g(k)$ if $\\Delta L<0$ and $s_{L}<g(k)$ if $\\Delta L>0$ , thus suggesting that we should add a decreasing function of the change in employment to our explanatory variables. In Appendix A we show that this intuition is roughly valid as well when we take into account that adjustment costs also enter labor costs.  \n\nContributions to Macroeconomics , Vol. 3 [2003], Iss. 1, Art. 9  \n\nAs to the shadow expected future marginal adjustment costs, they depend, among other things, on the degree of uncertainty. Higher uncertainty might be expected to increase the likelihood that a worker be fired, thus increasing the shadow cost of labor and pushing the economy further below the $S K$ curve.But this is not unambiguous: as in the case of investment (see Nickell, 1977), an increase in uncertainty may well increase incentives to hire.  \n\nEmpirically, the preceding arguments indicate that both taking current adjustment costs into account in the labor share and taking marginal adjustment costs current and future— into account in the marginal cost of labor, should lead to adding a decreasing function of $\\Delta L$ and a function of perceived uncertainty, $\\sigma_{t}$ ,as explanatory variables for the labor share, i.e.: $s_{L t}=f(k_{t},\\Delta L_{t},\\sigma_{t})$ , where it is likely that $f_{2}(.)<0$ ， $f_{3}(.)\\lessgtr0$  \n\n### 3 Evidence  \n\nWe now investigate empirically the factors driving the evolution of the labor share in 12 OECD countries and 13 sectors 0ver the period 1972-1993. Data availability precludes our analyzing all the variables which are relevant according to the model. We focus on three sources of variation: movements along the $S K$ relationship (i.e., shocks whose effect on $s_{L}$ is entirely mediated by $k$ , such as changes in the prices of capital and labor, and labor-augmenting technical progress); two shifters of the $S K$ curve, namely capital-augmenting technical progress and changes in the price of raw materials; and two sources of movements off the $S K$ schedule, namely changes in union bargaining power and labor adjustment costs. We start by documenting a few stylized facts present in the data, we then discuss the equation to be estimated and the econometric techniques used, and we finally show the empirical results.  \n\n#### 3.1 Stylized facts  \n\nThe $S K$ schedule is a technological relationship, and so it is more appropriate to investigate it at the industry than at the country level. Therefore, we use industry data from the OECD International Sectoral Data Base (ISDB), which includes information on output, employment, capital, total factor productivity, and factor shares for 12 OECD countries over the period 1970-93, disaggregated at the 1- or 2-digit level.15 The set of industries analyzed does not span the whole economy, excluding agriculture, but comes close to doing so. Appendix B provides details on the database.  \n\nOur key variables are the labor share, $s_{L}$ , and the capital-output ratio, $k$ 。 $s_{L}$ is defined as the share of labor in nominal value added net of indirect taxes and $k$ isthe ratio of the real capital stock to real value added. In other words, they correspond to $\\widetilde{s}_{L}$ and $\\widetilde{k}$ , as defined in the theory section, although we will omit the $\\sim$ symbol for simplicity. The standard labor share is measured as the fraction of value added that goes to the remuneration of employees. However, part of the remuneration of the self-employed is a return to labor rather than to capital. Gollin (2002) discusses the bias implicit in ignoring this fact and discusses three alternative methods of imputing that part. Here we follow his preferred method, namely imputing the self-employed labor income equal to the average wage earned by employees.  \n\nTABLE 2.

The data are an unbalanced panel of 13 industries and 12 countries. Total number of observations: 2457. Source: OECD International Sectoral Data Base (ISDB). See definitions of variables and number of observations by country, year, and industry in Table A1.  \n\nTable 2 presents the overall statistics of these two variables for all industries, countries, and years in the sample. Due to the imputation for the self-employed, in 63 of the 2457 observations the labor share exceeds 1, which explains the maximum value in the Table. This may refect that in some countries national accounts include some correction of labor income for the self employed, though they should not. But in that case we would tend to find the highest values in a few countries for various sectors, whereas we only find them in one sector per country. Thus, it is more likely that the high values come from the self-employed earning on average a lower wage than employees (and from the fact that social security taxes, included in the labor remuneration, are generally higher on employees). In any event, we also estimated the labor share equation both without making any correction and alternatively assuming that the self-employed earned two-thirds as much as employees and the results were very similar to those reported below (see Bentolila and Saint-Paul, 2001).  \n\nTable 3 shows 1972-93 averages (the period used in the econometric estimates) for $s_{L}$ and $k$ by industry and country. For countries, averages for the whole business sector are shown as well: the differences between databases are small, except in a few cases, and they stem from the absence of data for a few sectors. As expected, given the technological determinants of the labor share, within our sample both variables vary more widely across industries than across countries: the range for the labor share, for example, goes from 35% in Electricity, Gas, and Water to 85% in Construction. The variation in the labor share within industries and countries is capturedby $c v(s_{L})$ , the coefficient of variation across countries and years for a given industry (third column) and across sectors and years for a given country (seventh column). These figures suggest sizeable, economically significant, variations in the labor share: for instance, within the US, a shift of one standard deviation from the average across industries implies a change of the labor share from 69.7 to 86.8. Typically dispersion is higher within countries than within industries, confirming the importance of technological differences across industries.  \n\nTABLE 3.

Business sector: OECD Economic Outlook Statistics on Microcomputer Diskette.  \n\n#### 3.2 Empirical specification  \n\nFor empirical purposes, we do not restrict the functional form of the labor share to the one derived for a specific production function like the CES, but rather assume a more general multiplicative form:  \n\n$$\ns_{L,i j t}=g(k_{i j t},S_{i j t})h(X_{i j t})\n$$  \n\nwhere the subindices denote industries ( $i=1,...,13$ ), countries $(j=1,...,12)$ , and time ( $t=1972,...,1993)$ 16  Here $g(k_{i j t},S_{i j t})$ captures the $S K$ schedule, which is affected by $S$ . Following Section 2.3, and given data limitations, in our empirical specification $S$ contains the national real price of imported oil, $q_{j t}/p_{j t}$ , and a measure of total factor productivity $(T F P_{i j t})$ , meant to capture capital-augmenting technical progress.  \n\nOn the other hand, $h(X_{i j t})$ captures discrepancies between the marginal product of labor and the wage —wage bargaining, adjustment costs, etc.— which may move the economy off the $S K$ relationship. Following Section 2.4, $X_{i j t}$ includes two variables. First, the effect of current labor adjustment costs is captured through the industry net growth rate of the number of employees $(\\Delta\\ln n_{i j t})$ . We also tried to capture the effect of future expected adjustment costs through several industryspecific measures of uncertainty, which came out with the expected sign but were not statistically significant.17 Second, the effect of workers’ bargaining power $(\\theta)$ ， which would matter in an efficient bargains setup, is captured by the number of labor conficts nationwide, normalized by the number of employees in the preceding year. This variable is measured as a country-specific, backward-looking 5-year moving average and it is denoted by. $\\widetilde{l c r}_{j t}$ 18  Neither of the latter two variables is very well measured from the point of view of the theory. Lastly, we are missing a measure for variations in price-cost markups, which are very hard to come by (see, e.g., Batini et al., 2000, in a related setting).  \n\nAgain for empirical purposes, we impose further structure by assuming that the functions $g(.)$ and $h(.)$ in equation (17) are also multiplicative, i.e.:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{g(k_{i j t},S_{i j t})}}&{{=}}&{{{\\cal A}_{i j t}^{\\beta_{0}}(d_{i}k_{i j t})^{\\beta_{1i}}\\left(d_{i}\\frac{q_{j t}}{p_{j t}}\\right)^{\\beta_{2i}}}}\\ {{h(X_{i j t})}}&{{=}}&{{\\exp\\left(\\displaystyle\\sum_{m=3}^{5}\\beta_{m}x_{i j t}^{m}\\right)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $A_{i j t}=T F P_{i j t}$ ， $X_{i j t}=(\\Delta\\ln n_{i j t},\\widetilde{l c r}_{j t},v_{i j t})$ , and $v_{i j t}$ is a residual term (so that $\\beta_{5}\\equiv1$ ). Note that the coefficients on $\\mathrm{ln}k_{i j t}$ and $\\ln(q_{j t}/p_{j t})$ are allowed to vary by  \n\nindustry through interactions with industry dummies ( $d_{i}=1$ for industry $i$ ,and o otherwise). Now substitute equations (18) and (19) into (17) and take logs, arriving at the basic estimated equation:  \n\n$$\n\\ln s_{L,i j t}=\\beta_{0}\\ln T F P_{i j t}+\\sum_{i}\\beta_{1i}d_{i}\\ln k_{i j t}+\\sum_{i}\\beta_{2i}d_{i}\\ln(q_{j t}/p_{j t})+\\beta_{3}\\Delta\\ln n_{i j t}+\\beta_{4}\\widetilde{l c r}_{j t}-\\sum_{i}\\beta_{1i}d_{i}\\ln k_{i j t},\n$$  \n\n#### 3.3 Econometric methods  \n\nEquation (20) is estimated using panel data techniques, both in levels and first differences, where individual units of observation are industry-country pairs. We treat right-hand side variables as potentially endogenous and characterize such endogeneity through the following specification of the error:  \n\n$$\nv_{i j t}=\\delta_{i j}+\\epsilon_{i j t}\n$$  \n\nTheterm $\\delta_{i j}$ is an industry-country specific effect potentially correlated with the explanatory variables. $\\epsilon_{i j t}$ is a period-specific individual shock that represents expectational and possibly measurement errors, but may also capture unobservable variables, such as markups. Our instrumental variables should therefore not be significantly correlated with these potential error components.  \n\nWithrespectto $\\epsilon_{i j t}$ , we treat the labor share, the capital-output ratio, the real price of oil, the total factor productivity index, and the employment net growth rate as potentially endogenous, and two variables constructed as backward-looking moving averages as predetermined, namely the labor confict rate and the industry uncertainty measure discussed above.19 We therefore use as instrumental variables for the equations estimated in first differences, which are free of the $\\delta_{i j}$ ,contemporaneous or lagged values of the latter, plus lags of the total factor productivity index, the rate of change of employment, and the real capital stock. Since differencing induces a first-order moving average of the residuals, we use the second, rather than first, lagged values for the endogenous variables.  \n\nWith respect to $\\delta_{i j}$ , we also assume that the correlation between some of the regressors and the fixed effects is constant over time. This assumption only requires stationarity in mean of the regressors given the effects and it can be tested through the overidentifying restrictions.20 It is useful because it allows us to use lagged first differences as instruments for the errors in levels. Thus, for the equations estimated in levels, apart from first differences of the predetermined variables, we use as instruments the lagged first differences of the total factor productivity index, the rate of change of employment, the capital-output ratio and the real price of imported oil —the latter two interacted with industry dummies.21  \n\nBentolila and Saint-Paul: Explaining Movements in the Labor Share  \n\nIt should be noted that, since the regression error term includes measurement error and possibly product market competition, identification may be in question if these sources are not truly constant (fixed effects) and show some persistence.  \n\nOur joint estimation in levels and first differences is carried out using Arellano and Bover's (1995) system estimator, which is shown to yield potentially large efficiency gains vis-a-vis the pure first-difference estimator (see also Blundell and Bond, 1998).22 Algebraically, it can be expressed as follows. For simplicity, let us first rewrite equation (20) in the form:23  \n\n$$\ny_{i j t}=\\beta^{\\prime}x_{i j t}+v_{i j t}\n$$  \n\nwhere $y_{i j t}=\\ln s_{L,i j t}$ ， $x_{i j t}=\\left(\\ln T F P_{i j t},d_{i}\\ln k_{i j t},d_{i}\\ln(q_{j t}/p_{j t}),\\Delta\\ln n_{i j t},\\widetilde{l c r}_{j t}\\right)$ , and $\\beta$ is the parameter vector. The number of industry-country units is 121. The panel is unbalanced, with some observations missing either at the beginning or the end of the sample period (see Table A1), so that $t=1,...,T_{i j}$ , where $12\\leq T_{i j}\\leq22$ is the number of periods available on the $i j$ -th unit. The $v_{i j t}$ are assumed to be independently distributed across units with zero mean, but arbitrary forms of heteroskedasticity across units and time are allowed. The identification assumptions are as follows. If there is a variable, say $Z_{i j t}^{L}$ , satisfying the condition $E(Z_{i j t}^{L}\\epsilon_{i j t})=0$ and we can assume that $E(Z_{i j t}^{L}\\delta_{i j})$ does not depend on $t$ , then we have $E(\\Delta Z_{i j t}^{L}v_{i j t})=0$ , i.e. $\\Delta Z_{i j t}^{L}$ isavalistre frquaon1Nttha it wntae include fixed effects in the estimation of this equation; that would be tantamount to including them twice (and, indeed, estimates of the fixed effects could be obtained from the estimation that we perform). Similarly, for the equation estimated in first differences, $\\Delta y_{i j t}=\\beta^{\\prime}\\Delta x_{i j t}+\\Delta v_{i j t}$ ， $E(Z_{i j t}^{D}\\Delta v_{i j t})=0$ implies that $Z_{i j t}^{D}$ is a valid instrument.  \n\nNote that, while using the information contained in both the levels and the first differences of the data, our estimated equation is informative about the determinants of the level of the labor share or, more precisely, about how the labor share varies across countries and industries with changes in the equation's right-hand side variables.  \n\nThe specification is checked by means of the Sargan statistic $(S T)$ ,atest of overidentifying restrictions for the validity of the instrument set, which is distributed asa $\\chi^{2}$ with degrees of freedom equal to the number of instrumental variables minus the number of parameters. We also report a statistic for the absence of second-order serial correlation in the first-differenced residuals, $\\widehat{v}_{k t}-\\widehat{v}_{k,t-1}$ ,labeled $m_{2}$ . This is based on the standardized average residual autocovariances, which are asymptotically $N(0,1)$ variables under the null of no autocorrelation, and should not be significantly different from zero if the residuals in levels are serially uncorrelated (note that, due to differencing, first-order autocorrelation is expected ex-ante).  \n\nContributions to Macroeconomics , Vol. 3 [2003], Iss. 1, Art. 9  \n\n#### 3.4 Empirical results  \n\nTable 4 gives the estimates of our basic specification, equation (20). Industry capitaloutput ratios are jointly very significant ( $p$ -value: 0.00), which indicates departures from the Cobb-Douglas production function. The coefficients are either positive or negative, suggesting that labor and capital are either complements or substitutes depending on the industry, a finding which may depend on the (unobserved) industry shares of skilled labor. However, the $t$ -ratios, which in this case test for the difference vis-a-vis the Social Services sector, indicate that industry coefficients for $k$ are not statistically significant from each other.  \n\nAs a check of the results, we use the estimated coefficients to compute industryspecific measures of the elasticity of substitution between $K$ and $L$ ， $\\sigma_{K L}$ .From equation (20), we compute it as: $\\begin{array}{r}{\\sigma_{K L}=-(1+\\frac{\\partial\\tilde{s}_{L}}{\\partial\\tilde{k}}\\tilde{k}\\eta)=-(1+\\frac{\\partial\\ln\\tilde{s}_{L}}{\\partial\\ln\\tilde{k}}\\tilde{s}_{L}\\eta)<0}\\end{array}$ For this purpose we need an estimate of $\\eta$ , the elasticity of the labor demand with respect to the wage holding the real price of oil constant. Wage elasticity estimates abound but, as shown by Hamermesh (1993), they depend strongly on the specificities of the particular studies. Thus it seems better to use a ballpark estimate taken from Hamermesh's (1993, p. 92) summary of nearly 70 studies. The overall range is (-0.15, -0.75), with an average of $-0.39$ .Table 4 shows our estimates for $-\\sigma_{K L}$ using the latter value, which in 5 out of 13 cases are below 1, varying across sectors from 0.66 to 1.24. Nevertheless, only the elasticity for the Food sector (1.11) is significantly different from 1 (Cobb-Douglas) at the 5% level. Using the extreme values of the overall range of estimated wage elasticities instead, the estimated $-\\sigma_{K L}$ vary from 0.87 to 1.18 for the lowest value, and from 0.35 to 1.88 for the largest.  \n\nThe first shifter of the $S K$ relationship, the real oil price, is also significant, attracting negative coefficients (except for four industries) and thus resolving the theoretical ambiguity. Like for $k$ , however, differences across sectors are not statistically significant.  \n\nAs for total factor productivity, meant to capture the effect of capital-augmenting, or more generally not labor-augmenting, technical progress on the labor share, the estimated coefficient is negative, but we cannot interpret the magnitude, since the variable is measured as an index. Given the way the $T F P$ measure is constructed, we also estimated the equation with a linear trend as an alternative, finding qualitatively similar results (see Bentolila and Saint-Paul, 2001). As pointed out above, if total factor productivity is strictly capital augmenting, it should come out with the same sign as the capital/output ratio. This is the case for most sectors, but not all, suggesting that a more complex effect of productivity on the production function may be at work.  \n\nTurning to movements off the $S K$ curve, in Table 4 the variable capturing the effects of labor adjustment costs, namely the employment growth rate, shows the expected negative sign, as does the labor conflict rate, both being significant. The diagnostic statistics do not indicate problems with the specification.24  \n\nTABLE 4.ESTIMATION OF LABOR SHARE EQUATION Dependent variable: In S L,jit   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Coe f f.</td><td>t-ratio</td><td>-OKL</td><td>Coeff. t-ratio</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total factor productivity (lnTF Pijt) Employment change (△In nijt) Labor conflict rate (lcr jt)</td><td>-1.12 -1.41 -7.02</td><td>(3.21) (1.90) (1.96)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Industry</td><td>Capital/Output d;(lnkijt)</td><td></td><td></td><td>Real oil price d; In(qjt/ Pjt)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mining</td><td>-1.22</td><td>(1.07)</td><td>1.24</td><td>1.49</td><td>(0.67)</td></tr><tr><td>Food</td><td>-0.44</td><td>(0.99)</td><td>1.11</td><td>-0.04</td><td>(0.18)</td></tr><tr><td>Textiles</td><td>0.17</td><td>(0.65)</td><td>0.94</td><td>-0.15</td><td>(0.79)</td></tr><tr><td>Paper</td><td>-0.10</td><td>(0.81)</td><td>1.03</td><td>-0.07</td><td>(0.38)</td></tr><tr><td>Chemicals</td><td>-1.99</td><td>(1.19)</td><td>1.46</td><td>0.37</td><td>(0.58)</td></tr><tr><td>Non-metallic minerals</td><td>-0.36</td><td>(0.94)</td><td>1.10</td><td>-0.05</td><td>(0.22)</td></tr><tr><td>Basic metal</td><td>-0.42</td><td>(1.05)</td><td>1.12</td><td>0.05</td><td>(0.21)</td></tr><tr><td>Machinery</td><td>0.16</td><td>(0.65)</td><td>0.95</td><td>-0.09</td><td>(0.50)</td></tr><tr><td>Elec., Gas, and Water</td><td>-0.47</td><td>(0.98)</td><td>1.06</td><td>0.01</td><td>(0.09)</td></tr><tr><td>Construction</td><td>0.43</td><td>(0.47)</td><td>0.86</td><td>-0.02</td><td>(0.09)</td></tr><tr><td>Trade</td><td>-0.13</td><td>(0.81)</td><td>1.04</td><td>-0.06</td><td>(0.29)</td></tr><tr><td>Transport and Communications</td><td>0.19</td><td>(0.64)</td><td>0.95</td><td>-0.25</td><td>(0.66)</td></tr><tr><td>Social services</td><td>1.26</td><td>(0.73)</td><td>0.66</td><td>-0.01</td><td>(0.02)</td></tr><tr><td>Joint significance (p-value)</td><td>0.00</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.05</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Specification checks</td><td>p-value</td><td>d.f.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Sargan</td><td>0.60</td><td>6</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>m2</td><td>0.30</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNo. of observations: 2457, no. of industry-country units: 121, Period: 1972-93.

We obtain the following results ( $t$ -ratios in parentheses):  \n\n$$\n\\ln s_{L,i j t}=-\\l_{(2,65)}\\l_{(2,29)}\\ln T F P_{i j t}\\l_{(2,67)}^{\\l_{2,23}\\ln k_{i j t}\\l+\\l_{(0,30)}\\l}(q_{j t}/p_{j t})\\l_{(2,79)}^{\\l_{-1,99}}\\Delta\\ln n_{i j t}\\l_{(1,84)}^{\\l_{-2,34}}\\widetilde{l c r}_{j}\n$$  \n\nThe coeffcient for the capital-output ratio implies a capital-labor elasticity of 1.06 (at $\\eta=-0.39\\AA.$ ),25 which is statistically different from the Cobb-Douglas value of 1 at the 1% level. This result lies in between those found by other researchers. On the one hand, there is a long literature finding elasticities significantly below 1, from 0.3 (Lucas, 1969) to 0.76 (Kalt, 1978). Antras (2003) provides a survey and points out that ignoring the possibility of technological change biases the estimate towards 1. His own estimates, for instance his two-stage least squares estimates for a CES production function and exponential labor- and capital-augmenting technological change, fall in the interval (0.46,0.83). On the other hand, Papageorgiou and coauthors, who also use a CES production and capture technological progress through trends, provide many estimates, most of which are above 1 (e.g. —without including measures for human capital—— 1.54 in Masanjala and Papageorgiou, 2003, or 1.24 in Duffy and Papageorgiou, 2000). Our estimates in Table 4 are in between the results in these two sets of studies, which are however not readily comparable to ours, since they use aggregate data for many countries, rather than industry data for high-income countries as we do. Moreover, our computed elasticities depend on positing an external value for $\\eta$ , so that we cannot in fact provide direct estimates OfOKL·  \n\nGiven that the theoretical model suggests potential non-linearities in the elasticity of the labor share with respect to the capital-output ratio, and given that we find both positive and negative coefficients in our specification with industry dummy interactions, we tried to capture this effect by adding a term in the squared log capital-labor ratio in the equation without industry dummy interactions. The coefficient turned out, however, not to be significant ( $t$ -ratio: 1.2).  \n\nComing back to our estimates, we still get a negative coefficient for the real oil price, but it is insignificant, both economically and statistically. Total factor productivity is again negative and very significant.26 This suggests that allowing for capital-augmenting technological progress in both theoretical and empirical models is indicated.  \n\nBentolila and Saint-Paul: Explaining Movements in the Labor Share  \n\nChanges in employment are significant and the estimated coefficient implies that, at an employment growth rate of, say, $1\\%$ p.a., a 1 percentage point increase in that rate reduces the labor share by $0.02\\%$ , which is small. This would mean that current labor adjustment costs move the economy off the $S K$ curve, though we have not found a role for future expected labor adjustment costs —probably due to the low quality of our proxy for this variable. Lastly, the labor conflict rate is again negative but significant only at the 7% level. Taking this as a result of non-significance, a straightforward interpretation would be that wage bargains are not efficient, with the right-to-manage model, say, being a more appropriate description of reality.27  \n\n### 4 Conclusions  \n\nIn this paper we show that movements in the labor share can be fruitfully decomposed into movements along a technology-determined curve, namely the sharecapital $(S K)$ curve, shifts of this locus, and deviations from it. Movements along the $S K$ curve capture changes in factor prices such as wage pushes and changes in real interest rates, as well as the contribution of labor-augmenting technical progress. The curve is itself shifted by factors such as non-labor embodied technical progress or changes in the price of imported materials. Lastly, other sources of variation of the labor share are represented by movements off the $S K$ curve, and are accounted for by deviations from marginal cost pricing such as changes in markups, labor adjustment costs, and changes in workers' bargaining power.  \n\nWe analyze the performance of the model empirically, using data on a panel of 13 industries in 12 OECD countries, over the period 1972-93, by estimating the relationship between the labor share and the capital-output ratio, controlling for variables intended to capture some of the factors mentioned above. In the estimation we follow Arellano and Bover's (1995) system estimator for panel data, i.e. a generalized method of moments estimator with instrumental variables which exploits the information contained in the relationship between the variables in both levels and first differences.  \n\nWe find a significant relationship between the two key variables, as indicated by the model. There is evidence that the labor share is shifted by total factor productivity, capturing technological progress, and the real price of oil (when its effects are allowed to vary by industry), and also that there are significant deviations from this relationship due to changes in employment and —less clearly— labor conflicts, which according to the model should capture gaps between the marginal product of labor and the wage, arising respectively from labor adjustment costs and workers’ wage bargaining power.28  \n\n#### Appendix A The labor share with labor adjustment costs  \n\nWe wish to show that the labor share is a decreasing function of the change in employment when adjustment costs are part of the labor share. In this case we have (where $L_{-1}$ denotes lagged employment):  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{s_{L}}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\frac{w L+A C(\\Delta L)}{F(K,B L)}=\\frac{B f^{\\prime}(l)L-A C^{\\prime}(\\Delta L)L+A C(\\Delta L)}{F(K,B L)}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{\\displaystyle={}g(k)+\\frac{A C(\\Delta L)-A C^{\\prime}(\\Delta L)(L_{-1}+\\Delta L)}{F(K,B(L_{-1}+\\Delta L))}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe last term's derivative with respect to $\\Delta L$ has the same sign as its numerator: $-A C^{\\prime\\prime}(\\Delta L)F(K,B L)L-[A C(\\Delta L)-A C^{\\prime}(\\Delta L)L]B f^{\\prime}(l)$ . This is clearly negative if $\\Delta L\\leq0$ . Assume, to the contrary, that $\\Delta L>0$ . Then this term is negative if and only if  \n\n$$\nA C^{\\prime\\prime}(\\Delta L)>-\\frac{A C(\\Delta L)}{L^{2}}\\frac{l f^{\\prime}(l)}{f(l)}+\\frac{A C^{\\prime}(\\Delta L)}{L}\\frac{l f^{\\prime}(l)}{f(l)}\n$$  \n\nA sufficient condition for that to hold is $A C^{\\prime\\prime}(\\Delta L)L/A C^{\\prime}(\\Delta L)>l f^{\\prime}(l)/f(l)$ . For $A C(\\Delta L)$ quadratic in $\\Delta L$ this is equivalent to $L/\\Delta L>g(k)$ , which is extremely plausible as $g(k)<1$ and $\\Delta L$ is likely to be smaller than $L$  \n\n#### Appendix B Data sources and definitions of variables  \n\nThe variables we use in the estimation are constructed from the OECD International Sectoral Data Base (ISDB) 1996, documented in OECD (1996). It covers the period 1960-95, but disaggregated data on a sufficient scale for most variables are only available for 1970-93. The variables we use -which have both country and year variation except for the real oil price and the labor conflict rate, which only vary by country- are as follows (original ISDB variables denoted by their own acronyms in capital letters):  \n\nLabor share: $s_{L}=W S S S~(E T/E E)/(G D P~(1-I N D)).$   \nCapital-outputratio: $k=K T V D/G D P D$   \nTotal factor productivity: $T F P=(G D P D/(E T^{\\alpha}K T V D^{1-\\alpha})/T F P_{0}$   \nReal oil price: q/p= Nominal oil price/GDP deflator $=(P O\\times E R)/(G D P/G D P V)$ Labor conflict rate: lcr = Number of labor conflicts (strikes+lock-outs)/Number of employees in the preceding year (Source: CEP-OECD Data Set, documented in Bell and Dryden, 1996).  \n\nwhere:  \n\n$E T={\\mathrm{Total}}$ employment. · $E E=$ Number of employees. $\\bigcirc$ $E R=$ Exchange rate vis-a-vis the dollar (Market rate/Par or Central rate, period average.

Yet almost all these papers ignore the bias in the estimated standard errors that serial correlation introduce4s. This is especially troubling because the independent variable of interest in DD estimation (e.g., the passage of law) is itself very serially correlated, which will exacerbate the bias in standard errors. Toillustrate the severity ofthis issue, we randomly generate placebo laws in state-level data on female wages from the Current Population Survey. For each law, we use OLS to compute the DD estimate of its “effect' as well as the standard error for this estimate. The standard errors are severely biased: with about 20 years of data, DD estimation finds an “effect’ significant at the $5\\%$ level of upto $45\\%$ of the placebo laws.  \n\nTwo very simple techniques can solve this problem for large sample sizes. The first technique consists in collapsing the data and ignoring the time-series variation altogether; the second technique is to estimate standard errors while allowing for an arbitrary covariance structure between time periods. We also suggest a third technique, based on randomization inference testing methods, which works well irrespective of sample size. This technique uses the empirical distribution of estimated effects for placebo laws to form the test distribution.  \n\nMarianne Bertrand   \nGraduate School of Business   \nUniversity of Chicago   \n1101 East 58th Street   \nChicago, IL 60637,   \nNBER and CEPR   \nmarianne.bertrand $@$ gsb.uchicago.edu   \nEsther Duflo   \nDepartment of Economics   \nMIT,E52-252G   \n50 Memorial Drive   \nCambridge, MA 02142,   \nNBER and CEPR   \neduflo $@$ mit.edu   \nSendhil Mullainathan   \nDepartment of Economics   \nMIT, E52-380A   \n50 Memorial Drive   \nCambridge, MA 02142   \nand NBER   \nmullain@mit.edu  \n\n## 1 Introduction  \n\nDifference-in-Difference (DD) estimation has become an increasingly popular way to estimate causal relationships. DD estimation consists of identifying a specific intervention or treatment (often the passage of law). One then compares the difference in outcomes after and before the intervention for groups affected by it to this difference for unaffected groups. For example, to identify the incentive effects of social insurance, one might first isolate states that have raised unemployment insurance benefits. One would then compare changes in unemployment duration for residents of states raising benefits to residents of states not raising benefits. The great appeal of DD estimation comes from its simplicity as well as its potential to circumvent many of the endogeneity problems that typically arise when making comparisons between heterogeneous individuals.1  \n\nObviously, DD estimation also has its drawbacks. Most of the debate around the validity of a DD estimate revolves around the possible endogeneity of the laws or interventions themselves.2 Sensitive to this concern, researchers have developed a set of informal techniques to gauge the extent of the endogeneity problem.3 In this paper, we address an altogether different problem with DD estimation. We assume away biases in estimating the intervention's effect and instead focus on possible biases in estimating the standard error around this effect.  \n\nDD estimates and standard errors for these estimates most often derive from using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) in repeated cross-sections (or a panel) of data on individuals in treatment and control groups for several years before and after a specific intervention. Formally, let $Y_{i s t}$ be the outcome of interest for individual $i$ in group $s$ (such as a state) at time $t$ and $T_{s t}$ be a dummy for whether the intervention has affected group $s$ at time $t$ .4 One then typically estimates the following regression using OLS:  \n\n$$\nY_{i s t}=A_{s}+B_{t}+c X_{i s t}+\\beta T_{s t}+\\epsilon_{i s t}\n$$  \n\nwhere $A_{s}$ and $B_{t}$ are fixed effects for the states and years and $X_{i s t}$ represents the relevant individual controls. The estimated impact of the intervention is then the OLS estimate $\\hat{\\beta}$ .Standard errors around that estimate are OLS standard errors after accounting for the correlation of shocks within each state-year (or s-t) cell.5  \n\nIn this paper, we argue that the estimation of equation 1 is in practice subject to a possibly severe serial correlation problem. While serial correlation is well-understood, it has been largely ignored by researchers using DD estimation. Three factors make serial correlation an especially important issue in the DD context. First, DD estimation usually relies on fairly long time series. Our survey of DD papers, which we discuss below, finds an average of 16.5 periods. Second, the most commonly used dependent variables in DD estimation are typically highly positively serially correlated. Third, and an intrinsic aspect of the DD model, the treatment variable $T_{s t}$ changes itself very little within a state over time. These three factors reinforce each other to create potentially large mis-measurement in the standard errors coming from the OLS estimation of equation 1.  \n\nTo assess the extent of this bias, we examine how DD performs on placebo laws, where state and year of passage are chosen at random. Since these laws are fictitious, a significant “effect” at the 5% percent level should be found only 5% of the time. In fact, we find dramatically higher rejection rates of the null hypothesis of no effect. For example, using female wages as a dependent variable (from the Current Population Survey) and covering 21 years of data, we find a significant effect at the 5% level in as much as 45% of the simulations.6  \n\nthe number of groups gets small. We propose a third (and preferred) solution which works well irrespective of sample size. This solution, based on the randomization inference tests used in the statistics literature, uses the distribution of estimated effects for placebo laws to form the test statistic.  \n\nThe remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. In section 2, we assess the potential relevance of the auto-correlation problem: section 2.1 reviews why failing to take it into account will result in biased standard errors, and section 2.2 surveys existing DD papers to assess how it affects them. Section 3 examines how DD performs on placebo laws. Section 4 describes possible solutions. Section 5, discusses implications for the existing literature. We conclude in Section 6.  \n\n## 2  Auto-correlation and Standard Errors  \n\n### 2.1 Review  \n\nIt will be useful to quickly review exactly why serial correlation poses a problem for OLS estimation. Consider the OLS estimation of equation 1, and denote $V$ the vector of independent variables and $\\alpha$ the vector of parameters. Assume that the error term $\\epsilon$ has $E[\\epsilon]=0$ and $E[\\epsilon\\epsilon]=\\Omega$ . The true variance of the OLS estimate is given by:  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{var}(\\hat{\\alpha})=\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}(V^{\\prime}V)^{-1}V\\Omega V(V^{\\prime}V)^{-1}\n$$  \n\nwhile the OLS estimate of the variance is:  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{est}\\mathrm{var}(\\hat{\\alpha})=\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\epsilon}^{2}(V^{\\prime}V)^{-1}\n$$  \n\nTo more easily compare these expressions, let's consider a simple uni-variate time-series case in which we regress $y_{t}$ on $v_{t}$ with $T$ periods of data. Suppose that the error term $u_{t}$ follows an AR(1) process with auto-correlation parameter $\\rho$ and that the independent variable $v_{t}$ follows an AR(1) with auto-correlation parameter $\\lambda\\geq0$ . In this special case, equations 2 and 3 can be simplified to:  \n\n$$\nv a r(\\hat{\\alpha})=\\frac{\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}}{\\sum_{t=1}^{T}v_{t}^{2}}(1+2\\rho\\frac{\\sum_{t=1}^{T-1}v_{t}v_{t+1}}{\\sum_{t=1}^{T}v_{t}^{2}}+2\\rho^{2}\\frac{\\sum_{t=1}^{T-2}v_{t}v_{t+2}}{\\sum_{t=1}^{T}v_{t}^{2}}+...+2\\rho^{T-1}\\frac{v_{1}v_{T}}{\\sum_{t=1}^{T}v_{t}^{2}})\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{est}\\operatorname{var}(\\hat{\\alpha})=\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\epsilon}^{2}}{\\sum_{t=1}^{T}v_{t}^{2}}\n$$  \n\nAs $T\\to\\infty$ , the ratio of estimated to true variance equals $\\frac{1-\\rho\\lambda}{1+\\rho\\lambda}$  \n\nThese formulas make transparent three well known facts about how serial correlation biases OLS estimates of standard errors. First, positive serial correlation in the error term ( $\\mathrm{\\Delta}\\rho>0$ )will cause an under-statement of the standard error while negative serial correlation will cause an overstatement. This is intuitive: positive serial correlation means that there is less information in each new year of data than OLS assumes. Second, the magnitude of the bias also depends on how serially correlated the independent variables is. In fact, when the independent variable is not serially correlated $\\lambda=0$ ), there is no bias in the estimated standard errors. This second point is important in the DD context, where the intervention variable $T_{s t}$ is in fact very serially correlated. Indeed, for affected states, the intervention variable typically equals O period after period until one year where it turns to 1 and then stays at 1. In other words, the variable “whether a law was passed by state s by time t\" varies little over time within a state, thereby exacerbating any serial correlation in the dependent variable. Finally, the magnitude of the problem depends on the length of the time series (T). All else held constant, as T increases, the bias in the OLS estimates of the standard errors worsens.  \n\n### 2.2  A Survey of DD Papers  \n\nThis quick review suggests the relevance of a serial correlation problem for existing DD papers depends on three factors: (1) the typical length of the time series used; (2) the serial correlation of the most commonly used dependent variables; and (3) whether any procedures are use to correct for serial correlation.  \n\nSince these factors are inherently empirical, we collected data on published DD papers. We identified all DD papers published in 6 journals between 1990 and 2000: the American Economic Review, the Industrial and Labor Relations Review, the Journal of Political Economy, the Journal of Public Economics, the Journal of Labor Economics, and the Quarterly Journal of Economics. We classified a paper as “DD\" if it met two following criteria. First, the paper must focus on specific interventions. For example, we would not classify a paper that regressed wages on unemployment as a DD paper (even though it might suffer from serial correlation issues as well). Second, the paper must use units unaffected by the law as a control. We found 92 such papers. For each of these papers, we determined the number of time periods in the study, the nature of the dependent variable, and the technique(s) used to estimate standard errors.  \n\nTable 1 summarizes the results of this exercise. We start with the lengths of the time series. Sixty-nine of the 92 DD papers used more than two periods of data. Four of these papers began with more than two periods but collapsed the data into two effective periods: before and after. Table 1 reports the distribution of time periods for the remaining 65 papers.8 The average number of periods used is 16.5 and the median is 11. More than 75% of the papers use more than 5 periods of data. As we will see in the simulations below, lengths such as these are more than enough to cause serious under-estimation of the standard errors.9  \n\nThe most commonly used variables in DD estimation are employment and wages.10 Eighteen papers study employment and thirteen study wages. Other labor market variables, such as retirement and unemployment also receive significant attention, as do health outcomes. Most of these variables are clearly highly auto-correlated. To cite an example, Blanchard and Katz (1992) in their survey of regional fuctuations find strong persistence in shocks to state employment, wages and unemployment. It is interesting to note that first-differenced variables, which might have a tendency to exhibit negative auto-correlation (and thereby over-state standard errors) are quite uncommon. In short, the bulk of DD papers focus on outcomes which are likely positively serially correlated.  \n\nHow do these 65 papers correct for serial correlation? The vast majority of papers do not address the problem at all. Only five papers explicitly deal with it. Of these five, four use a parametric AR(k) GLS-based correction. As we will see later, this correction does very little in the way of adjusting standard errors. The fifth allows for arbitrary variance-covariance matrix within state, one of the solutions we suggest in Section 4.  \n\nTwo additional points are worth noting. First, 80 of the original 92 DD papers have a potential problem with grouped error terms as the unit of observation is more detailed than the level of the variation.1l Only 36 of these papers address this problem, either by clustering standard errors or by aggregating the data. Second, several informal techniques are used for dealing with the possible endogeneity of the intervention variable. For example, three papers include a lagged dependent variable in equation 1, seven include a trend specifically for treated states, 15 plot graphs of some form to examine the dynamics of the treatment effect, 3 examine whether there is an effect before the law, two see if the effect is persistent, and eleven formally attempt to do triple-differences (DDD) by finding another control group. We return to the issue on how these informal techniques interact with the serial correlation problem in Section 5.  \n\nIn summary, our review suggests that serial correlation is likely an important problem for many existing DD papers and that this problem has been poorly addressed to date.  \n\n## 3 Over-Rejection in DD Estimation  \n\nWhile the survey above shows that most DD papers are likely to report under-estimated standard errors, it does not tell us how serious the problem is in practice. To assess magnitudes, we turn to a specific data set, a sample of women's wages from the Current Population Survey (CPS).12  \n\nWe extract data on women in their fourth interview month in the Merged Outgoing Rotation Group of the CPS for the years 1979 to 1999. We focus on all women between 25 and 50 years old. We extract information on weekly earnings, employment status, education, age, and state of residence. The sample contains nearly 900,000 observations. We define wage as log(weekly earnings). Of the 900,000 women in the original sample, approximately 300,000 report strictly positive weekly earnings. This generates ( $50^{*}21{=}1050$ ) state-year cells with each cell containing on average a little less than 300 women with positive weekly earnings.  \n\nThe correlogram of the wage residuals is informative. We estimate first, second and third autocorrelation coefficients of the residuals from a regression of the logarithm of wages on state and year dummies (the relevant residuals since DD includes these dummies). The auto-correlation coefficients are obtained by a simple regression of the residuals on the corresponding lagged residuals. We are therefore imposing common auto-correlation parameters for all states. The estimated first order auto-correlation is 0.51, and is strongly significant. The second and third order auto-correlation 12The CPS is one of the most commonly used data sets in the D literture.  \n\nare high as well ( .44 and .33 respectively), and decline much less rapidly than we would expect if the residual was following an AR(1) process.13  \n\n### 3.1 Placebo Interventions  \n\nTo quantify the bias induced by serial correlation in the DD context, we randomly generate laws, which afect some states and not others. We first draw at random from a uniform distribution between 1985 and 1995.14 Second, we select exactly half the states (25) at random and designate them as “affected\" by the law (even though the law does not actually have an effect). The interventionvariable $T_{s t}$ is then defined as a dummy variable which equals 1 for all women that live in an affected state after the intervention date, and O otherwise.  \n\nWe can then estimate DD (equation 1) using OLS on these placebo laws. The estimation generates an estimate of the laws’ “effect\" and a corresponding standard error. To understand how well DD performs we can repeat this exercise a large number of times, each time drawing new laws at random. If DD provides an appropriate estimate for the standard error, we would expect that we reject the null hypothesis of no effect ( $\\beta=0$ )exactly $5\\%$ of the time when we use a threshold of 1.96 for the t-statistic.15  \n\nactually is one.17  \n\n### 3.2  Basic Rejection Rates  \n\nThe first row of Table 2 presents the result of this exercise when performed in the CPS micro data, without any correction for grouped error terms. We re-estimate equation 1 as described above for at least 200 independent draws of placebo laws. The control variables $X_{i s t}$ include 4 education dummies (less than high school, high school, some college and college and more) and a quartic in age as controls. We report the fraction of simulations in which the absolute value of the t-statistic was greater than 1.96, i.e. the fraction of simulations where the null hypothesis of no intervention effect was rejected at the 5% level.  \n\nThe frst column of row 1 shows the results of this exercise in the unaltered micro CPS data. Here, even though there is no true effect of the placebo laws, we find that the null of no effect is rejected a stunning $67.5\\%$ of the time. Thus, in this setup, DD is over-rejecting by a factor of thirteen.18 The second column of this row performs a similar exercise but on the CPS data altered to contain a 2% effect (we added . $02*T_{s t}$ to the data). We find that, in this case, we reject the null hypothesis of no effect in 85.5% of the cases.  \n\nOne important reason for this gross over-rejection has been described by Donald and Lang and (2001), who apply Moulton's (1990) general arguments to DD inference. The estimation above does not account for correlation within state-year cell it does not allow for aggregate year-to-year shocks that affect all the observations within a state. In other words, OLS assumes that the variance matrix for the error term is diagonal while in practice it might be block diagonal, with a constant correlation coefficient within each state and year cell. As noted earlier, while 80 papers suffer from this problem, only 36 correct for it.  \n\nTo properly account for such shocks, one can assume that there is a random effect for each state-year cell in equation 1:  \n\n$$\nY_{i s t}=A_{s}+B_{t}+c X_{i t}+\\beta T_{s t}+\\nu_{s t}+\\epsilon_{i t}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\nu_{s t}$ are group random effects. The standard error can be corrected for the correlation at the group level introduced by the random effect. Row 2 reports rejection rates when we allow for stateyear random effects using the White correction (1984) which allows for an arbitrary intra-group correlation matrix. We continue to find a 44% rejection rate.19  \n\nIn row 3, we take a more drastic approach to solve this problem. We aggregate the data into state-year cells to construct a panel of states over time. To aggregate, we first regress log weekly earnings on the controls (education and age) and form residuals. We then compute means of these residuals by state and year. This leaves us with 50 times 21 state-year cells in the aggregate data. Using this aggregate data, we estimate:  \n\n$$\n\\bar{Y}_{s t}=\\alpha_{s}+\\gamma_{t}+\\beta T_{s t}+\\epsilon_{s t}\n$$  \n\nwhere the bar above the variables refers to the aggregation.  \n\nIf the correlation within state-year cells were the only reason for over-rejection, aggregation ought to fully solve the problem, since it would make the variance-covariance matrix for the error term diagonal. Row 3 displays the results of multiple estimations of equation 5 for placebo laws. The rejection rate of the null of no effect is almost as high here as when use the micro data and correct the standard errors for clustering. In about 44% of the simulations, we reject the null hypothesis of no effect.20  \n\nThese magnitudes suggest that failing to account for serial correlation when computing standard errors generates a dramatic bias. As we saw in equation 2.1, one important factor in the DD context is the serial correlation of the intervention variable $T_{s t}$ itself. In fact, we would expect the un-corrected estimates of the standard errors for the intervention variable to be consistent in any variation of the DD model where the intervention variable is not serially correlated. To illustrate this point, we construct a different type of intervention variable. As before, we randomly select half of the states to form the treatment group. However, instead of randomly choosing one date after which all the states in the treatment group are affected by the law, we randomly select 10 dates between 1979 and 1999. The law is now defined as 1 if the observation relates to a state that belongs to the treatment group at one of the 10 intervention dates, O otherwise. In other words, the intervention variable is now repeatedly turned on and off, with its value yesterday telling us nothing about its value today, and thereby eliminating the serial correlation in $T_{s t}$ . In row 4, we see now that the null of no effect is rejected only 6% of the time in this case. Removing the serial correlation in the law removes the over-rejection. This strongly suggests that the bias in the standard errors is due to serial correlation, rather than other properties of the error terms.  \n\nIn rows 5 and 6, we examine how rejection rates vary as we modify the number of affected states. When 12 states or 36 states are affected, the rejection rates are 39% and 43% respectively. The placebo laws so far have been constructed in such a way that the intervention variable affects all treated states in the same year. In row 7, we create placebo laws such that the date of passage can differ across treated states. We randomly choose half of the states to form the treatment group but now randomly choose a passage date separately for each state (uniformly drawn between 1985 and 1995) in the treatment group. The $T_{s t}$ variable is still defined to equal 1 if state $s$ has passed the law by time $t$ , and O otherwise. The rejection rates continue to be high in this case, with the null of no effect being rejected about 35% of the time.  \n\nOne might still worry at this point that factors other than serial correlation give rise to these large rejection rates. Perhaps we are by chance detecting actual laws (or other relatively discrete changes). Or perhaps other features of the wage data, such as state specific trends or other characteristics of the distribution of the error term, give rise to the over-rejection. To directly address all of these problems, we replicate our analysis in manufactured data. Specifically, we generate data whose variance structure in terms of relative contribution of state and year fixed effects matches the empirical variance decomposition in the CPS. The data is normally distributed and follows an AR(1) process with an auto-correlation parameter $\\rho$ . By construction, we can therefore be sure that there are no ambient trends and that the laws truly have no effect. Yet, in row 8, where we assume that $\\rho$ equals .8, we find a rejection rate roughly equal to what we found in the CPS, 37%.  \n\n### 3.3  Magnitude of Effects  \n\nThese excess rejection rates are stunning, but they might not be particularly problematic if the estimated “effects\" of the placebo laws are economically insignificant. We examine the magnitudes of the statistically significant intervention effects in Table 3. Using the aggregate data, we perform 200 independent simulations of equation 5 for placebo laws defined such as in row 3 of Table 2. Table 3 reports the empirical distribution of the estimated effects $\\hat{\\beta}$ , when these effects are significant. Not surprisingly, this distribution appears quite symmetric: half of the false rejections are negative and half are positive. On average, the absolute value of the effects is roughly .02, which corresponds roughly to a 2 percent effect. Nearly 60% fall in the 1 to $2\\%$ range. About 30% fall in the 2 to 3% range, and the remaining 10% are larger than 3%.  \n\nThese magnitudes are especially large considering that DD estimates are often represented as elasticities.2l For example, suppose that the law under study corresponds to be a 5% increase in the child-care subsidy. An increase in log earnings of .02 would correspond to an elasticity of .4. Similarly, in many DD estimates, the affected group is often only a fraction of the sample, meaning a measured 2% effect on the full sample would indicate a much larger effect on the treated subsample.22  \n\nTo summarize, our findings suggest that the standard errors from the OLS estimation of equations 1 grossly understate the true standard errors, even if one accounts for group data effects in the micro data. In other words, reporting simple DD estimates and their standard errors without accounting for serial correlation will generate many spurious results.23  \n\n### 3.4  Varying Serial Correlation  \n\nvariables. Second, we experiment with various auto-correlation parameters in the manufactured data.  \n\nThe first part of Table 4 estimates equation 5 on employment rate, average weekly working hours and change in log wages, as well as the original log weekly earnings. As before, the table displays the rejection rate of the null hypothesis of no effect in 200 independent simulations with random draws of the intervention variable, both in raw data and in data altered to create a 2% effect of the intervention. We also report in Table 4 estimates of the first, second and third order auto-correlation coefficients for each of these variables. As we see, the false rejection problem diminishes with the serial correlation in the dependent variable. As expected, when the estimate of the first-order auto-correlation is negative (as it is the case for change in log wages), we find that the conventional standard errors tend to underestimate the precision of the estimated treatment effect.  \n\nThe second part of Table 4 uses manufactured data. The error structure is designed to follow an AR(1) process. As before, the manufactured data has the same number of states and years as the CPS data and is constructed so that the relative importance of state effects, year effects and the error term in the total variance matches the variance composition of the wage data in the CPS. Not surprisingly, the false rejection rates increase with the auto-correlation parameter in the AR(1) process. There is exactly the right rejection rate when there is no auto-correlation. But even at moderate levels, such as a $\\rho$ of .2 or .4, rejection rates are already two to four times as large as they should be. As noted earlier, with an AR(1) parameter of 0.8, the rejection rate using the standard OLS formula is close to what we observe in the CPS data. And again, when the auto-correlation is negative, there is under-rejection.  \n\n### 3.5 Varying the Number of States and Time Periods  \n\nThe stylized exercise above focused data with 51 states and 21 time periods. Many DD papers use fewer states (or treated and control units), either because of data limitations or a desire to focus only on comparable controls. For similar reasons, several DD papers use fewer time periods. In Table 5, we examine how the over-rejection rate varies with these two important parameters. As before, we use the CPS as well as manufactured data to analyze these effects. We also examine rejection rates when we have added a treatment effect to the data.  \n\nRows 1-4 and 10-13 show that varying the number of states does not change the extent of overrejection. $^{24}$ Rows 5-9 and 14-18 vary the number of years. As expected, the extent of over-rejection falls as the time span gets shorter, but it does so at a surprisingly slow rate. For example, even with only 7 years of data, the over-rejection rate is $16\\%$ in the CPS, three times too large. Around 70% of the DD papers in our survey use at least that many periods. With 5 years of data, the rejection rate varies between 8% (CPS data) and 17% (manufactured data). When T=50, the rejection rate rises to nearly 50% in the manufactured data.  \n\n## 4 Solutions  \n\n### 4.1 Parametric Methods  \n\nA frst natural solution to the serial correlation problem would be to specify the auto-correlation structure for the error term, estimate its parameters, and use equation (2) to estimate true standard errors. We implement several variations of this basic correction method in Table 6.  \n\nRow 2 performs the simplest of these parametric corrections, wherein an AR(1) process is estimated in the data.25 This technique does little to solve the serial correlation problem: the rejection rate is still 34.5%. The failure here is in part due to the under-estimation of the autocorrelation coefficient. As is well understood, with short time-series the OLS estimation of the auto-correlation parameter is biased downwards. In the CPS data, OLS estimates a first-order auto-correlation coefficient of only 0.4. Similarly, in the manufactured data where we know that the auto-correlation parameter is .8, a $\\hat{\\rho}$ of .62 is estimated (row 7). If we impose a first-order autocorrelation of .8 in the CPS data (row 3), the rejection rate goes down to $12.5\\%$ ,a clear but only partial improvement.  \n\nhow well the true variance-covariance matrix does. In other words, we use the variance-covariance matrix implied by an AR(1) process with $\\rho$ of .8 to estimate standard errors. As expected, the rejection rate is now indistinguishable from $5\\%$ when there is no effect. More interestingly, when there is a 2% effect, the rejection rate is now $32.3\\%$ . This will be a useful benchmark for other corrections.  \n\nAnother problem with this parametric correction may be that we have not correctly specified the auto-correlation process. As noted earlier, an AR(1) does not fit the correlogram of wages in CPS. In rows 9 and 10, we use the manufactured data to see the effect of such mis-specification of the autocorrelation process. In row 9, we generate data according to an AR $_{\\cdot}(2)$ processwith $\\rho_{1}=.55$ and $\\rho_{2}=.35\\$ . These parameters were chosen because they match well the estimated frst, second and third auto-correlation parameters in the wage data when we apply the formulas to correct for small sample bias given in Solon (1984). We then correct the standard error assuming that the error term follows an AR(1) process. The rejection rate rises significantly with this mis-specification of the auto-correlation structure (30.5%).  \n\nIn row 10, we use a process that provides an even better match of the time-series properties of the CPS data: the sum of an AR(1) (with auto-correlation parameter 0.95) and a white noise (the variance of the white noise is $13\\%$ of the total variance of the residual).26 When trying to correct the auto-correlation in this data by fitting an AR(1), we reject the null in about 39% of the case, close to what we found for the CPS data in row 2.  \n\nHowever, attempting to correct for the auto-correlation by specifying different processes does not look like a plausible option: it is clearly dificult to find the right process. In rows 4 and 5, we correct the standard errors in the CPS data by imposing the specific AR(2) and AR(1) plus white noise processes that we have seen match fairly well the CPS data. The rejection rates remain high.27  \n\n### 4.2 Block Bootstrap  \n\nAn alternative correction method with which we experiment is block bootstrap (Efron and Tibshirani, 1994). Block bootstrap is a variant of bootstrap which maintains the auto-correlation structure by keeping all the residuals of a state together. We implement block bootstrap as follows. We first estimate equation 1 and compute the residuals. This gives a vector of residuals $\\epsilon_{i}$ for each state. We then draw for each state a new residual vector from this distribution (with replacement). Adding this residual back to the original predicted value gives us a new outcome variable $Y_{i t}^{1}$ .We then estimate equation 1 for this outcome. By repeatedly sampling from the residual distribution of $\\epsilon_{i}$ , we can form different $Y_{i t}^{k}$ and repeat this exercise to estimate a sequence of $\\hat{\\beta}_{k}$ . The distribution of these parameters then gives us a test statistic.  \n\nThe results of the block bootstrap estimation are reported in Table 7. They are not encouraging. The rejection rates are still high: $35\\%$ in the CPS data (row 2) 29% in the manufactured data as well (row 3). The problem appears to be the small number of blocks or states. In row 4, when we allow for 400 states (and 200 states passing the law), block bootstrap delivers a close to correct rejection rate. Since very few applications in practice can rely on that many groups, block bootstrap does not appear to be a realistic solution to the serial correlation problem.  \n\n### 4.3 Empirical Variance-Covariance Matrix  \n\nBoth the most parametric and the most non-parametric methods seem to fail because of lack of data: there are not enough time periods to estimate the time series process and perform a parametric correction, and not enough states for block bootstrap. However, the techniques we tried above did not make use of the fact that we have a large number of states that can be used to estimate the auto-correlation process in a fexible way. Specifically, suppose that the auto-correlation process is the same in all states. In this case, if the data is sorted by states and (by decreasing order of) years, the variance-covariance matrix of the error term is block diagonal, with 50 identical blocks of size $T$ by $T$ (where $T$ is the number of time periods). Each of these block is symmetric, and the element $(i,i+j)$ is the correlation between $\\epsilon_{i}$ and $\\epsilon_{i-j}$ .We can therefore use the variation across the 50 states to estimate each element of this matrix, and use this estimated matrix to compute standard errors from equation 2. This is equivalent to treating the problem as a system Oof $T$ seemingly unrelated equations estimated jointly (1 for each year), with 50 data points (one for each state) in each year. We implement this technique in Table 8. The rejection rate we obtain (in 200 simulations) is 7.75% in the CPS (row 2) and $10\\%$ in the manufactured data (row 9), a significant improvement over the two previous methods.  \n\nThis correction method however has important limitations in practice. First, as the number of states drops, the rejection rates increase (rows 4, 6 and 8). A second obvious issue is that this method does not deliver consistent estimates of the standard error if the data generating process is not the same across all states. Finally, the technique has low power. In column 2 of row 2, we see that the rejection rate is only 8.5% when a true 2% effect is associated with the laws.  \n\n### 4.4  Arbitrary Variance-Covariance Matrix  \n\nThis procedure can be generalized to an estimator of the variance covariance matrix which is consistent in the presence of any correlation pattern within states over time. Of course, we cannot consistently estimate each element of the matrix $\\Omega$ in this case, but we can use a generalized Whitelike formula to compute the standard errors.28 This estimator for the variance-covariance matrix is given by:  \n\n$$\nV=(X^{\\prime}X)^{-1}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n_{c}}u_{j}^{\\prime}u_{j}\\right)(X^{\\prime}X)^{-1}\n$$  \n\nwhere $n_{c}$ is the total number of states, $X$ is matrix of independent variables and $u_{j}$ is defined for each state to be:  \n\n$$\nu_{j}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T}e_{j t}x_{j t}\n$$  \n\nwhere the summation is over all elements in the state, $e_{j t}$ is the residual at time $t$ (in that particular state)and $x_{j t}$ is a row vector of dependent variables (including the constant).29 This estimator of the variance-covariance matrix is consistent as the number of states tends to infinity.  \n\n6% (row 2, column 1). Moreover, the procedure has relatively high power compared to what we found in Table 8 (row 2, column 2). In the manufactured data, we can also see how well it does relative to the upper-bound. We saw in Tables 4 6, that with the correct covariance matrix, the rejection rate in the case of a 2% effect was 78% in manufactured data with no auto-correlation and 32% in AR(1) data with $\\rho=.8$ . The arbitrary variance-covariance matrix comes nearly these upper-bounds, achieving rejection rates of 74% and $27.5\\%$ respectively.  \n\nAgain, however, rejection rates increase significantly above 5% when the number of groups declines (15% with 6 states, 8.5% with 10 states). This method, therefore, seems to work well, when the number of treated units is large enough.  \n\n### 4.5  Ignoring Time Series Information  \n\nAnother possible solution to the serial correlation problem is to simply ignore the time series component in the estimation and when computing the standard errors.30 To do this, one could simply average the data before and after the law and run equation 1 on this averaged outcome variable as a panel of length 2. The results of this exercise are reported in Table 10. The rejection rates are approximately correct now at 6%. Moreover, the power of .295 in row 2 is quite high relative to other techniques.  \n\nTaken literally, however, this solution will work only for laws that are passed for all the treated states at the same time. If states pass the law at different times, “before” and “after” are no longer the same and are not even defined for states that never pass the law. One can however slightly modify the technique in the following way. First, one regress $Y_{s t}$ on state fixed effects, year dummies, and any relevant covariates. One then divides the residuals of the treatment states only into two groups: residuals from years before the law, and residuals from years after the law. The estimate and the standard error come from an OLS regression of this two-period panel on an after dummy. This procedure does as well as the simple aggregation (row 3 vs. row 2) for laws that are all passed at the same time. It also does well when the laws are staggered over time (row 4).  \n\nThe downside of these procedures (both raw and residual aggregation) is that they do poorly vhen the number of states is small. With 20 states, residual aggregation has a rejection rate of 30 One could stil use time-series data fo specification checks.  \n\n$9.5\\%$ , nearly twice too large. With only 6 states, the rejection rate is as high as $31.5\\%$ .31The extent of over-rejection in fact appears to increase faster in this case than in the clustering method presented above.  \n\n### 4.6  Randomization Inference  \n\nWe have so far isolated two procedures that appear to do fairly well when the number of states is sufficiently large. In this section, we present an estimation technique that does well irrespective of the sample size. The principle behind the test is simple, and motivated by the simulation exercises carried out throughout this paper. To compute the standard error for a specific experiment, we propose to compute DD estimates for a large number of randomly generated placebo laws and to use the empirical distribution of the estimated effects for these placebo laws to form significance test for the true law.32  \n\nThis test is closely related to the randomization inference test (or Fisher's exact test), discussed in the statistical literature (see Rosenbaum (1996) for an overview of this test and its applications). Before laying out the test in more details, it will be useful to give a simple, motivating illustration of the way randomization inference works. Suppose we have outcome data (such as sick days) on individuals, half of whom have received a fu shot. Define $Y_{i}$ to be the outcome and $T_{i}$ be the indicator for vaccination, both for individual $i$ . Suppose that the we make the hypothesis that the treatment effect is constant:  \n\n$$\nY_{i}=a_{i}+\\theta T_{i}\n$$  \n\nNow, let us assume that the fu shot was administered to a random group, so that $a_{i}$ is orthogonal to $T_{i}$ . To estimate the effect of the shot, we could take the difference in mean outcomes between those receiving the shot and those not receiving it. Call this estimator $\\hat{\\theta}(T_{i},Y_{i})$ .How can we test hypotheses about this parameter? We would use the OLS estimate of the standard error but this estimates rests on strong assumptions, such as homoskedasticity, normal distribution of the error and independence between observations. Instead, to test whether the coefficient is different from O, one can use the fact that under the null of no effect, people in the treatment and control groups are statistically the same. One can, therefore, generate a set of placebo interventions $\\tilde{T_{i}}$ and estimate the “effect”\" of these placebos. Repeated estimation will give us a distribution of effects for such placebos. We can then observe where the original estimate $\\hat{\\theta}$ lies in this distribution to test the hypothesis that the coefficient is 0.  \n\nFor example, to form a two-tailed test for whether the initial estimate is significantly different from 0 at the 5% level, we would use the 2.5% and 97.5% values in the distribution $\\hat{\\theta}(T_{i},Y_{i})$ as our cut-off value. The intuition behind this test is quite simple. Since the Hu shot is assumed to be random, we can generate other truly random, zero-effect shots and see what estimates these produce in the data we have. Notice the advantages of this procedure. We are making no assumptions about the error term (except for the randomness of the fu shot itself). It need not be homoskedastic, normal or even independent across individuals. Further, this test does not rest on any large sample approximation: it is therefore valid for any sample size. Under the assumption that the treatment effect is constant across unit (i.e $\\theta$ is not indexed by $i$ ), we could test other hypotheses in the same way: if we want to test whether the estimate is different from $\\theta_{0}$ , we first form $Y_{i0}=a_{i}-\\theta_{0}T_{i0}$ ,to make the treatment and the control comparable under the null, and we apply the same technique to the transformed data.33  \n\nThe statistical inference test we propose for the DD model follows naturally from this example. To form the estimate of the law's effect, we estimate by OLS the usual aggregate equation:  \n\n$$\n\\bar{Y}_{s t}=\\alpha_{s}+\\gamma_{t}+\\beta T_{s t}+\\epsilon_{s t}\n$$  \n\nWe then generate a placebo law that affect 25 randomly chosen states in a random year, $P_{s t}$ and estimate using OLS:  \n\n$$\n\\bar{Y}_{s t}=\\alpha_{s}+\\gamma_{t}+\\gamma P_{s t}+\\epsilon_{s t}\n$$  \n\nRepeating this procedure many times for random placebo laws produces a distribution of $\\hat{\\gamma}$ . Define $G(.)$ to be this distribution and $\\hat{\\gamma}$ to be the random variable drawn from this distribution. To test the hypothesis that our estimate is statistically different from O, we simply need to ask where $\\hat{\\beta}$ lies in the $G(.)$ distribution. For example, to form a two-tailed test of level $p$ , we would simply 33One can use the same technique to fom entire confdence intervals  \n\nidentify the $\\hat{\\gamma}$ at the $\\textstyle{\\frac{p}{2}}$ lower and upper tail of the distribution and use these values as cutoffs: If the estimated coefficient lies outside these two cutoff value, we reject the hypothesis that it is equal to O, otherwise we accept it. As before, note that we have not used any information about the error term. Instead, we have relied solely on the random assignment of the laws.34  \n\nIn Table 11, we asses how well this procedure performs in the aggregated CPS data as well as in manufactured data with a known auto-correlation structure. Again, we randomly generate intervention variables. For each randomly generated intervention $T_{s t}$ , we construct the test statistic for a 5% cutoff. We perform 200 independent draws of $T_{s t}$ . For each of these draws, we perform 400 draws of $P_{s t}$ to construct the distribution $G(\\hat{\\gamma})$  \n\nWe see that the basic randomization inference procedure leads us to reject the null hypothesis of no effect in 6% of the simulations (row 2, column 1). Notice that the procedure also seems fairly powerful, leading to rejecting in 23% of the cases when there is an effect (row 2, column 2). As before, in the manufactured data, we can compare its performance to the upper-bound. We saw in Tables 4 6, that with the correct covariance matrix, the rejection rate in the case of a 2% effect was 78% in manufactured data with no auto-correlation and 32% in $\\mathrm{AR}(1)$ datawith $\\rho=.8$ .The performance of randomization inference, 30% and $84\\%$ is comparable to these upper-bounds.  \n\nThere is an additional assumption behind this test, namely the requirement that we know the exact statistical process determining which units get treated (e.g. in the fu shot example, the statistician know that half of the sample was randomly selected to get the treatment). In practice, we will not know the true process by which laws are generated. If a particular law took place in 1988, and we are estimating its effect, should we assume when generating the placebo laws that the law could only have been passed in 1988, that it could have been passed at any random time between 1971 and 2000, or something else? Rows 3 to 5 consider the effect of using different (and simpler) assumptions about the law generating process. Each row allows the laws for the test distribution to lie in a different window around the actual law date. In row 3 for example, we assume that it lies in a 5 year window centered on the actual date. In row 4, we assume a 3 year window. In row 5, we force the placebo laws to occur in the same year as the actual laws; in other words, we permute only which states were affected by the laws. As can be seen, both in terms of type I and type II errors, all the procedures produce very similar results.35 The next few rows repeat the exercise using a progressively smaller number of states. Even with as few as 6 states, the procedure produces exactly the right rejection rates.  \n\nTo summarize, Table 11 makes it clear that, of all the techniques we have considered, randomization inference performs the best. It removes the over-rejection problem and does so independently of sample size. Moreover, it appears to have power comparable to that of the other tests. Although randomization inference testing is well known in statistics, it is largely ignored in the econometrics literature. Difference in differences estimation, which deals with small effective sample size, and complicated error distribution, seems a particularly fertile ground for the application of this testing technique.  \n\n## 5 Implications for Existing Papers  \n\nThis paper has highlighted an important problem with DD estimation and proposed several solutions to deal with it. What are the implications for the existing stock of papers which use the DD estimation technique but do not explicitly correct for serial correlation? We have already seen that most of these papers use long time series and variables which are likely quite auto-correlated. One possibility, however, is that some of the informal techniques used in these papers might indirectly help alleviate the auto-correlation problem.  \n\nAs we noted earlier, researchers have developed a set of diagnostic tests that are often performed in conjunction with the estimation of equations 1 or 5. These tests are meant to assess the endogeneity of the interventions, something that is not a problem in our setup, as we construct random interventions that are by definition exogenous. It is possible that these tests may incidentally lessen the auto-correlation problem. In Table 12, we report rejection rates when we perform the OLS estimation of equations 1 and 5 in combination with several commonly used diagnostic techniques.36 We concentrate on 3 data sets: micro CPS wage data (with clustering of the error term by state-year cell), aggregate CPS wage data, and manufactured data where the error term follows an AR(1) process with an autocorrelation parameter of 0.8.  \n\nThe first diagnostic test looks for pre-existing “effects\"” of the law. We re-estimate the original DD with the $T_{s t}$ variable but also include a dummy for “\"this state will pass a law next year\". We then reject the null hypothesis of no effect only if the coefficient on the law is significant and the coefficient on the pre-law dummy is either insignificant or opposite signed. This diagnostic test implies only a small reduction in the rejection rates.  \n\nThe second diagnostic test examines persistence of the effect. We reject the null hypothesis of no effect if the estimated coefficient is statistically significant under OLS and the effect persists three years after the intervention date. Again, this does not lead to a significant reduction in the rejection rate in any of the data sets.  \n\nThe third test looks for pre-existing trends in the treatment sample. We perform a regression in the pre-period and estimate whether there is a significant time trend in these years for the difference between control and treatment states). Under this test, we reject the null of no effect if the OLS coefficient is statistically significant and if there is no statistically significant pre-existing treatment trend or a treatment trend of opposite sign of the intervention effect. The rejection rates are lower under this test but remain above $20\\%$  \n\nestimation problem discussed in this paper.38  \n\n## 6 Conclusion  \n\nOur results suggest that, because of serial correlation, DD estimation as it is commonly performed grossly under-states the standard errors around the estimated intervention effect. While the bias induced by serial correlation is well understood in theory, the sheer magnitude of this problem in the DD context should come as a surprise to most readers. Since a large fraction of the published DD papers we surveyed report t-statistics around 2, our results suggest that the findings in many of these papers may not be as precise as originally thought to be and that far too many false rejections of the null hypothesis of no effect have taken place.  \n\nWe propose three solutions to deal with the serial correlation problem in the DD context. Collapsing the data into pre- and post- periods or allowing for an arbitrary covariance matrix within state over time have been shown to be simple viable solutions when sample sizes are suffciently large. Alternatively, a simple adaptation of the randomization inference testing techniques developed in the statistics literature appears to fully correct standard errors irrespective of sample size.  \n\n## References  \n\nAbadie, Alberto, “Semiparametric Difference-in-Differences Estimators,” Working Paper, Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, 2000.   \nBlundell, Richard and Thomas MaCurdy, “Labor Supply” in Handbook of Labor Economics, Orley Ashenfelter and David Card (eds.), December 1999.   \nEfron, Bradley and Robert Tibshirani An Introduction to the Bootstrap Monograph in Applied Statistics and Probability, no 57, Chapman and Hall, 1994   \nHeckman, James, “Discussion,” in Empirical Foundations of Household Taxation, Martin Feldstein and James Poterba (eds.), 1996.   \nDonald, Stephen and Kevin Lang, “Inferences with Difference in Differences and Other Panel Data,\" Boston University Working Paper, 2001.   \nMaCurdy, Thomas E., “The Use of Time Series Processes to Model the Error Structure of Earnings in a Longitudinal Data Analysis,” Journal of Econometrics, v. 18 (1982): 83-114.   \nMeyer, Bruce, “Natural and Quasi-Natural Experiments in Economics,” Journal of Business and Economic Statistics, v. 13 (1995): 151-162.   \nMoulton, Brent R., “An Illustration of a Pitfall in Estimating the Effects of Aggregate Variables in Micro Units,” Review of Economics and Statistics, v. 72 (1990): 334-338.   \nNewey, Whitney and K.

D. Bomf Inaki Erauskin  \n\nJune 2021  \n\n## Abstract  \n\nA recent body of literature has sought to determine the causes of the global decline of the labor share. We study the role played by government investment—which has also fallen in many advanced economies over the past few decades—in the labor share decline. We first establish a theoretical link between government investment and the labor share using a general equilibrium macroeconomic model, where government capital enters the production function in a factor-augmenting fashion. Our analytic results show that a permanent cut to government investment causes a steady-state decline in the labor share if the elasticity of substitution between private capital and labor is less than one and public capital augments private capital. We then study the empirical relationship between these variables using two panel datasets covering 79 countries, both developing and developed, over the period 1970-2017. Using a system GMM estimator, we find a positive and statistically significant association between government investment and the labor share in advanced economies; for developing countries, however, we find no effect.  \n\nJEL codes: E25, E60, H54  \n\nKeywords: productive government investment, public investment, public capital, public infrastructure, factor income shares, labor share.  \n\n# 1 Introduction  \n\nA vast body of research has recently focused on the so-called ‘functional distribution of income,’ that is, the distribution of aggregate income between capital holders and wage earners. This literature has been largely sparked by the work of Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) and Piketty (2014), who document global declines of the labor share of income since the 1980s. This empirical observation is important, not only because it disputes the constancy of factor shares as stylized facts, which have been enshrined in the macroeconomics literature since at least Kaldor (1957, 1961), but also because of its potential implications in terms of economic inequality. Despite some evidence that the decline of the labor share owes in part to measuring issues,1 there is still a general consensus that it has genuinely and globally declined over the past few decades (Autor et al, 2020). Less consensual, however, are the causes of such decline. Some explanations recently put forward include, among others, the accumulation of private capital, changes in labor market institutions and policies, the global expansion of supply chains, and the rise in the market power of capital-intensive firms. In this paper, we argue, both theoretically and empirically, that changes in government investment have also contributed to movements in the labor share. Our hypothesis is motivated by Figure 1, which shows a positive correlation between the cross-country averages of government investment and the labor share over time, especially in advanced economies.2  \n\nWe start by formalizing the relationship between government investment and the labor share using a general equilibrium model of a small open economy (Section 2). The defining feature of the model whereby government investment affects the labor share lies in the production technology. We employ a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function over private capital and labor, which departs from the more common Cobb-Douglas specification by allowing for elasticities of substitution different from one. We further assume that the stock of government capital enters the production function in a factor-augmenting fashion. The resulting production specification allows changes in government investment to be factor-biased—i.e., to affect the marginal products of private capital and labor in different proportions (Acemoglu, 2002; Bom, 2017)—thereby affecting the factor shares. We analytically derive the steady-state effect of a permanent change to government investment on the labor share. The resulting steady-state multiplier highlights the role of the elasticity of substitution and the type of factor-augmentation of government capital. In particular, we show that government investment increases the labor share in steady state if and only if government capital augments private capital and the elasticity of substitution is less than one. We argue that both conditions are empirically plausible. If so, the model predicts that declines in government investment spending should cause the labor share to decline as well.  \n\nThe mechanism linking government investment with the labor share in our model is closely related with other neoclassical explanations of the labor share decline based on technical change. Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) and Piketty (2014) offer explanations based on the accumulation of (private) capital: by decreasing the price of capital investment goods, technological progress induces a substitution effect from labor into capital, lowering the labor share. But this argument relies on the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor being larger than one, which is hardly supported by the available evidence. In fact, most empirical studies find elasticities much smaller than one (Chirinko, 2008; Gechert et al 2019; Knoblach and Stockl, 2020). More in line with this evidence, a group of studies including, among others, Lawrence (2015), Alvarez-Cuadrado, Long, and Poschke (2018), and del Rio and Lores (2019), suggest that the labor share decline can be better explained by a combination of low substitutability between capital and labor and labor-augmenting technical change. Because technical change is then capital-biased, it lowers the labor share by raising the marginal product of capital relative to that of labor. In our model, likewise, government capital acts as a form of technical change, albeit one that augments private capital. With an elasticity of substitution smaller than one, government capital is then labor-biased. Therefore, a decline in government investment also lowers the labor share by raising the marginal product of capital relative to that of labor.  \n\nWe then set out to empirically test whether government investment is related to the labor share (Section 3). We obtain panel data for government investment from the International Monetary Fund's “Investment and Capital Stock Database 2019,′ which covers 170 countries for the period 1960-2017 (IMF, 2019). For the labor share, we collect data from two main sources: The Conference Board (TCB) and the European Commission's AMECO database. The TCB data cover 79 developed and developing countries, starting in 1990. The AMECO data date back to 1970, but cover only 37 middle- and high-income countries. As a robustness check, we also use Karabarbounis and Neiman's (2014) data for the labor share. The main empirical specification consists of a panel-data regression model of the labor share on government investment. We also control for confounding factors, such as GDP per capita and trade openness, and allow, when applicable, for heterogeneous effects for developed and developing countries. We estimate the regression models with both the usual Fixed Effects estimator and the Generalized Method of Moments estimator, which further corrects for potential endogeneity. Our findings indicate a positive relationship between government investment and the labor share, in line with our theoretical model, but only for developed countries; for developing countries, the effect is small and statistically insignificant.3 Our results are quite robust across estimation methods and datasets.  \n\nApart from the aforementioned neoclassical arguments based on capital accumulation, several other explanations for the labor share decline have been proposed in the literature. One group of studies attribute an important role to changes in labor market institutions and policies, such as the globalization of labor supply (Jaumotte and Tytel, 2007), the deregulation of job protection (Ciminelli, Duval, and Furceri, 2020), and the declining bargaining power of workers (Stansbury and Summers, 2020). Another group of studies, including Dao et al (2017) and Schwellnus et al (2019), find that the expansion and integration of global value chains has also contributed to the labor share decline. In the same vein, Elsby, Hobijn, and Sahin (2013) find that the offshoring of labor-intensive production has caused the US labor share to fall. A third group of studies focus instead on the concentration of market power on a small number of capital-intensive firms with low labor shares. Autor et al (2017, 2020) show that the relocation of economic activity to a few 'superstar firms’ has pushed the labor share down both in the US and in other OECD economies. Dixon and Lim (2018), Barkai (2020), and De Loecker, Eeckhout, and Unger (2020) also provide supporting evidence that the labor share decline is associated with an increase in markups or, equivalently, with a decrease in competition. Finally, recent research has found evidence that demographic factors such as the rate of natural increase and the net migration rate have also affected the labor shares of developed countries (d'Albis, Boubtane, and Coulibaly, 2021). We view our findings as complementary to these contributions.  \n\nThe functional distribution of income is arguably an important factor behind the personal distribution of income and wealth (Atkinson, 2009; Glyn, 2011).4 Hence, this paper also relates, albeit less directly, with a strand of the literature studying the effects of government investment on income and wealth inequality. At the theoretical level, this effect turns out to be ambiguous, depending on model assumptions and financing modes. Using an endogenous growth model driven by public capital with heterogeneous capital endowments, Chatterjee and Turnovsky (2012) find that public investment may reduce income inequality in the short run but exacerbate it in the long run, with pre- and post-tax income inequality being sensitive to the financing policy adopted. Moreover, public investment would lead to a persistent increase in wealth inequality over time, regardless of the financing mode. On the contrary, Getachew and Turnovsky (2015) find that public investment increases income inequality when the elasticity of substitution between private and public capital is less than one, in a model with idiosyncratic productivity shocks and initial heterogeneous endowments. More recently, Turnovsky and Erauskin (2021) show that public investment reduces income inequality in a standard Ramsey model, the opposite being true in an AK model. At the empirical level, the few available studies find mostly a negative relationship between government investment and income inequality; these include Serven and Calderon (2004), Calderon and Chong (2004), Furceri and Li (2017), and Doumbia and Kinda (2019). In contrast, Banerjee, Dufo, and Qian (2020) find higher income inequality in Chinese regions with shorter distances to historical transportation networks.  \n\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the theoretical framework, including a brief description of the model (Section 2.1), the implied steady-state effect of government investment on the labor share (Section 2.2), and a simple graphical illustration (Section 2.3). The empirical analysis is presented in Section 3. After informally glancing at the relationship between government investment and the labor share in Section 3.1, we describe the empirical model in Section 3.2 and the data in Section 3.3. To assess the time series properties of the main variables in terms of stationarity, we conduct panel unit root tests in Section 3.4. Sections 3.5 and 3.6 present the main empirical results and some robustness checks, respectively. Section 4 provides further discussion on the results and Section 5 concludes the paper. Appendix A.1 provides further details on the mathematical derivations of the main theoretical results.  \n\n## 2 Theoretical framework  \n\nTo provide a theoretical underpinning for the relationship between government investment and the labor income share, we build a small-scale model of a small open economy. Because the main purpose of the model is to highlight the long-run forces linking public capital accumulation and the labor share, we abstract from the transitional dynamics and focus instead on the comparative statics.  \n\n### 2.1 Model  \n\nWe model a small open economy with perfect capital mobility across borders. The model is set up in continuous time and specified in real terms. To keep the notation as simple as possible, we drop the time indices whenever confusion does not arise.  \n\nProduction technology  Consider an economy composed of many identical firms operating under perfect competition. Firms produce output ( $Y$ )using as private inputs the stock of private capital ( $K$ ) and labor services ( $L$ ). Private capital and labor are optimally chosen by frms and thus referred to as ‘private' inputs. But frms also use a third input, government capital $(K_{G})$ , which, in contrast to the private inputs, is provided by the government as a pure public good.5 Inputs are transformed into output according to a production technology with a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) (Arrow et al, 1961):  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{Y=\\left[\\left(A_{K}K_{G}^{\\eta_{K}}K\\right)^{\\frac{\\sigma-1}{\\sigma}}+\\left(A_{L}K_{G}^{\\eta_{L}}L\\right)^{\\frac{\\sigma-1}{\\sigma}}\\right]^{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma-1}},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $A_{K}$ and $A_{L}$ are effciency parameters, $\\eta_{K}\\geq0$ and $\\eta_{L}\\geq0$ are factor-augmentation elasticities of government capital, and $\\sigma>0$ is the elasticity of substitution between private capital and labor.  \n\nNotice how the stock of public capital enters the production technology in a factoraugmentation fashion (Acemoglu, 2002; Bom, 2017). We refer to public capital as $K$ augmenting (or Solow-neutral) whenever $\\eta_{K}>0$ and as $L$ -augmenting (or Harrod-neutral) whenever $\\eta_{L}>0$ . Public capital is thus potentially factor-biased, increasing the marginal product of one private factor relative to the marginal product of the other. For example, public capital increases the marginal product of capital relative to that of labor (in which case it biased towards capital) if $\\eta_{K}>\\eta_{L}$ and $\\sigma>1$ , or if $\\eta_{K}<\\eta_{L}$ and $\\sigma<1$ . Conversely, public capital increases the marginal product of capital relative to that of labor (in which case it is biased towards labor) if $\\eta_{L}>\\eta_{K}$ and $\\sigma>1$ , or if $\\eta_{L}<\\eta_{K}$ and $\\sigma<1$ . Under a unitary elasticity of substitution (i.e., $\\sigma=1$ ), the CES technology reduces to a Cobb-Douglas specification, in which public capital affects neither the relative marginal products of the private factors nor their shares of income.  \n\nDenote the marginal products of private capital and labor by $Y_{K}\\equiv\\partial Y/\\partial K$ and $Y_{L}\\equiv$ $\\partial Y/\\partial L$ , respectively. Because the production function exhibits constant returns to scale i.e., homogeneity of degree one—over the private factors, Euler's theorem applies and $Y=$ $Y_{K}K+Y_{L}L$ . This feature is important when studying the income shares, as it implies that aggregate income is fully appropriated by the private factors if they are paid their marginal products. The output elasticities to the private inputs are then defined as $\\begin{array}{r}{\\theta_{K}\\equiv\\frac{Y_{K}K}{Y}>0}\\end{array}$ for private capital and $\\begin{array}{r}{\\theta_{L}\\equiv{\\frac{Y_{L}L}{Y}}>0}\\end{array}$ for labor, so that $\\theta_{K}+\\theta_{L}=1$  \n\nBy augmenting the private factors, public capital gives rise to a positive production externality. The magnitude of this externality is governed by the output elasticity of public capital, denoted byn= $\\begin{array}{r}{\\eta\\equiv\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial K_{G}}\\frac{K_{G}}{Y}}\\end{array}$ the private inputs and on the augmentation elasticities according to  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\eta=\\theta_{K}\\eta_{K}+\\theta_{L}\\eta_{L}\\ge0.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThat is, the output elasticity of public capital is composed of the sum of the factor-augmentation elasticities of government capital with respect to each private input multiplied by the corresponding output elasticities.  \n\nFirms The representative private firm maximizes the net present discounted value of its cash fow subject to the capital accumulation constraint  \n\n$$\n\\dot{K}=I-\\delta K,\n$$  \n\nwhere $I$ denotes gross private investment and $\\delta$ is the rate of depreciation of private capital. Note that a dot over a variable denotes its time derivative; hence, ${\\dot{x}}\\equiv d x/d t$ for any variable $x$ . The first-order conditions of the firm's problem simply equate the marginal costs to the marginal products of the private factors:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{r+\\delta}}&{{=}}&{{A_{K}K_{G}^{\\frac{\\eta_{K}(\\sigma-1)}{\\sigma}}\\left(\\displaystyle{\\frac{Y}{K}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\sigma}}\\equiv Y_{K},}}\\ {{w}}&{{=}}&{{A_{L}K_{G}^{\\frac{\\eta_{L}(\\sigma-1)}{\\sigma}}\\left(\\displaystyle{\\frac{Y}{L}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\sigma}}\\equiv Y_{L},}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $r$ is the interest rate and $w$ is the wage rate. Because the economy is small and open and capital is internationally mobile, the interest rate is determined in world markets and taken as given by the domestic representative firm. Labor, in turn, is immobile across borders. The wage rate is thus endogenously determined in the domestic labor market (see below).  \n\nGovernment To foot the bill on public capital investment, $I_{G}$ , the government levies a lump-sum tax on households, $T$ . To keep the government sector as simple as possible, we assume that the government's budget is permanently balanced, implying that $T=I_{G}$ .The stock of public capital accumulates according to  \n\n$$\n\\dot{K}_{G}=I_{G}-\\delta_{G}K_{G}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\delta_{G}$ denotes the depreciation rate of public capital.  \n\nHouseholds Standard models of a small open economy are prone to hysteresis unless some stationarity-inducing device is built in (Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2003). We adopt the Blanchard-Yaari formulation of finitely-lived households (Yaari, 1965; Blanchard, 1985) in order to generate an endogenously-determined (non-hysteretic) steady state. This property is convenient since we focus our analysis on steady-state comparative statics. The household sector consists of infinitely-many generations of individuals, who face a constant instantaneous probability of death $\\beta$ . New individuals are also born at the instantaneous rate $\\beta$ , So that the population size is kept constant over time. We use the subindex $\\upsilon$ to track the vintage of an individual born at time $\\upsilon$ . At time $t$ , an individual household of vintage $v\\leq t$ chooses the level of goods consumption ( $C_{v}$ ) and allocates one unit of time into either labor ( $L_{v}$ )or leisure $(1-L_{v})$ in order to maximize her lifetime utility  \n\n$$\n\\int_{t}^{\\infty}\\ln\\{C_{v}(\\tau)^{\\varepsilon}\\left[1-L_{v}(\\tau)\\right]^{1-\\varepsilon}\\}e^{(\\alpha+\\beta)(t-\\tau)}d\\tau,\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is the utility weight of consumption and $\\alpha$ denotes the pure discount rate. Households insure against the mortality risk by purchasing actuarially-fair annuities, which pay the effective return $r+\\beta$ on financial wealth while the household is alive in exchange for the existing financial wealth when the household passes away. Hence, in terms of equation (7), the fully-insured risk of death implies that households discount future utility at the effective rate $\\alpha+\\beta$  \n\nIndividual financial wealth, $\\dot{A}_{v}$ , accumulates according to  \n\n$$\n\\dot{A}_{v}=(r+\\beta)A_{v}+w L_{v}-T-C_{v},\n$$  \n\nwhere a few remarks are in order. First, as discussed above, the effective return on financial wealth is $r+\\beta$ . Second, households are equally productive, implying that the wage rate is independent of age. Finally, the consumption good is used as the numeraire, so that its price is set to one.  \n\nDenote individual‘full consumption’ by $X_{v}$ and define it as the market value of goods consumption and leisure; that is, $X_{v}\\equiv C_{v}+w\\left(1-L_{v}\\right)$ . The household's problem consists of maximizing (7) subject to (8) and a no-Ponzi game condition. The first-order conditions of this problem are:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{\\dot{X_{v}}}}&{{=}}&{{(r-\\alpha)X_{v},}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{C_{v}}}&{{=}}&{{\\varepsilon X_{v},}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{w\\left(1-L_{v}\\right)}}&{{=}}&{{(1-\\varepsilon)X_{v}.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe first of these conditions governs the intertemporal behavior of full consumption. We assume patient households (i.e., $\\alpha>r$ ),so that individual consumption profiles rise over time. The static equations (10) and (11), in turn, dictate the intratemporal split of full consumption into goods consumption and leisure, according to the preference parameter $\\varepsilon$  \n\nAggregation   At time $t$ , each cohort $v$ of households represents a fraction $\\beta e^{\\beta}(v\\mathrm{~-~}t)$ of the population. Using these cohort sizes, we can aggregate an household variable $x$ at time $t$ across living households as $\\begin{array}{r}{x=\\int_{-\\infty}^{t}x_{v}(t)\\beta e^{\\beta(v-t)}d v}\\end{array}$ . Doing so for goods consumption and leisure, given by (10) and (11), results in similar expressions at the aggregate level:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c c l}{{C}}&{{=}}&{{\\varepsilon X,}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{w(1-L)}}&{{=}}&{{(1-\\varepsilon)X.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nAggregating the dynamic equations for financial wealth and full consumption gives  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{\\dot{A}}&{=}&{r A+w L-T-C,}\\ {\\dot{X}}&{=}&{(r-\\alpha)X-\\beta(\\alpha+\\beta)A,}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhich take a different form than their individual counterparts, given by equations (8) and (9). Notice, for example, that the extra return $\\beta$ does not show up in (14), since $\\beta$ does not represent an increase in aggregate financial wealth but merely a transfer of financial wealth between generations. This transfer of wealth also causes aggregate full consumption to rise over time at a lower rate than individual full consumption, as implied by the last (negative) term on the right-hand side of (15). Notice that, without this term (i.e., if $\\beta=0$ ),an aggregate steady state would require $r=\\alpha$ , implying histeresis.  \n\nEquilibrium  In the aggregate equilibrium, $Y=C+I+I_{G}+N X$ ,where $N X$ denotes net exports. The stock of net foreign assets thus evolves according to $\\dot{F}=r F+N X$ . Hence, the stock of financial wealth consists of the stock of private capital plus the stock of net foreign assets, that is, $A=K+F$  \n\n### 2.2  The steady-state effect of government investment on the labor share  \n\nWe now use the model outlined in the previous section to study the steady-state effects of government investment on the labor share of income. The economy is assumed to be initially at rest in some (pre-shock) steady-state equilibrium where $\\dot{K}=\\dot{K}_{G}=\\dot{X}=\\dot{A}=0$ Upon a permanent government investment shock, the economy is diverted from the initial equilibrium towards a new (post-shock) steady-state equilibrium where, again, $\\dot{K}=\\dot{K}_{G}=$ $\\dot{X}=\\dot{A}=0$ . We characterize the marginal general-equilibrium effects of the government investment impulse on the labor income share across steady states by means of the labor share multiplier.6  \n\nTo find the labor share multiplier of government investment, we start by fully differentiating $\\theta_{L}=w L/Y$ with respect to $I_{G}$  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta_{L}}{d I_{G}}=\\frac{\\theta_{L}}{w}\\frac{d w}{d I_{G}}+\\frac{\\theta_{L}}{L}\\frac{d L}{d I_{G}}-\\frac{\\theta_{L}}{Y}\\frac{d Y}{d I_{G}},\n$$  \n\nwhich simply decomposes the total effect of government investment into the partial effects on the components of the labor share: wages $(w)$ ,labor $(L)$ ,andoutput $(Y)$ . If the two first terms on the right-hand side exceed the last term, then the effect of government investment on labor income $(w L)$ dominate the effect on total income ( $Y$ ), and the labor share goes up. To find the reduced-form expression of the labor share multiplier, we thus need to find the impact of government investment on wages, labor, and output. In general equilibrium, however, government investment may also affect the labor share indirectly through full consumption and financial wealth. Hence, finding the reduced-form expression of the labor share multiplier requires solving a linear system of multipliers. Appendix A.1 derives and solves this system. The reduced-form multipliers of labor, wages, and output are given by equations (A.7), (A.8), and (A.11), respectively.  \n\nPlugging in the reduced-form multipliers of labor, wages, and output into (16) gives, after some simplifying steps, the reduced-form multiplier of the labor share as  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta_{L}}{d I_{G}}=\\frac{\\theta_{K}\\eta_{K}(1-\\sigma)}{I_{G}}.\n$$  \n\nA few important results emerge from this expression. First, because the capital income share $(\\theta_{K})$ and government investment ( $I_{G}$ ) are both positive, a necessary condition for the government investment impulse to affect the labor share in the long run is that public capital augment private capital, i.e. $\\eta_{K}>0$ . Some types of government investment, such as core infrastructure spending on transportation, energy systems, or telecommunications, are likely to be of this sort, since they direct complement the stock of capital employed by private firms. It is therefore not the productive nature of government investment per se but the extent to which it directly augments private capital that matters for the labor share. Even if highly productive, public investment does not affect the labor share if public capital only augments the labor factor.  \n\nSecond, assuming that $\\eta_{K}~>~0$ , the magnitude of the effect depends on whether the elasticity of substitution between private factors ( $O$ ) is less or greater than one; in particular, the effect of public investment on the labor share is positive if private factors are gross complements (i.e., $\\sigma<1$ ) and negative if they are gross substitutes (i.e., $\\sigma>1$ ). Of course, the factor incomes shares are fixed under a Cobb-Douglas technology (i.e., $\\sigma=1$ )and thus unaffected by public investment. Hence, taking into account that the empirical evidence overwhelmingly supports the hypothesis that $\\sigma<1$ (Chirinko, 2008; Gechert et al, 2019; Knoblach and Stockl, 2020), one would expect public investment to exert a positive effect on the labor income share. Finally, although one might have expected the preference parameter $\\varepsilon$ or the initial amount of labor employment $(L)$ —which, after all, determines the labor supply elasticity—to affect the labor share, this turns out not to be the case. The key factors determining the general-equilibrium impact of public investment on the labor share in the model are the technology parameters $\\eta_{K}$ and $\\sigma$  \n\n### 2.3  Graphical illustration  \n\nFigure 2 provides a graphical illustration of the effect of a permanent increase in government investment on the labor share. Panel (a) represents the case in which private capital and labor are (strong) gross complements in production (i.e., $\\sigma\\ll1$ ), whereas panel (b) depicts the case in which they are gross substitutes (i.e., $\\sigma>1$ ). Intermediate cases in which the private factors show a small degree of complementarity (i.e., $\\sigma$ slightly smaller than one) are harder to illustrate graphically, but are no different than the case of strong complementarity in terms of the final effect on the labor share. Both graphs plot the production frontier in terms of the labor input, that is, the amount of output produced as a function of the labor input given the stocks of private and public capital.  \n\nPrior to the government investment impulse, the economy rests at the equilibrium $E_{0}$ in the production frontier $P F_{0}$ , employing $L=L_{0}$ to produce $Y=Y_{0}$ . The slope of $P F_{0}$ at $E_{0}$ represents the marginal product of labor, which determines the wage rate $w=w_{0}$ Hence, the pre-shock labor share is $w_{0}L_{0}/Y_{0}$ . The government investment shock affects the production frontier in two ways. First, for a given stock of private capital, the increment in public capital directly shifts the production frontier up to the dashed curve $P F^{\\prime}$ . This is a direct productivity effect, which increases output for any amount of the labor input, irrespective of $\\sigma$ . Second, private capital itself changes in general equilibrium, which further shifts the production frontier. But this indirect private-capital effect does depend on $\\sigma$ , as is clear from the reduced-form multiplier of private capital (A.9) in Appendix A.1. If the elasticity of substitution is sufficiently smaller than unity (i.e., $\\sigma\\ll1$ ), then private capital falls in the long run, which shifts the production frontier down to $P F_{1}$ in panel (a). If the elasticity of substitution is greater than one (i.e., $\\sigma>1$ ), then private capital increases in the long run, which shifts the production frontier up to $F P_{1}$ in panel (b).7  \n\nIrrespective of whether private capital ultimately increases or decreases over the long term, the marginal product of labor increases, which pushes up wages and employment. In fact, the steady-state effects on wages and labor positively depend on the output elasticity of public capital but depend neither on the elasticity of substitution nor on the particular type of factor augmentation, as revealed by the reduced-form multipliers (A.7) and (A.8) in Appendix A.1. Hence, the increase in labor (from $L_{0}$ to $L_{1}$ ) and the increase in wages (from $w_{0}$ to $w_{1}$ )are of equal magnitude in panel (a) and in panel (b). Given that two of the inputs ( $L$ and $K_{G}$ increase by the same amount in both panels, the ultimate effect on output is determined by the change in the third input, private capital, which decreases in panel (a) and increases in panel (b). Hence, the long-run output increase (from $Y_{0}$ to $Y_{1}$ ) is much larger in panel (b) than in panel (a).  \n\nTo understand the effects of the public capital impulse on the labor share of income, note that $Y=Y_{K}K+Y_{L}L$ ; that is, aggregate income is fully exhausted in remunerating the two private factors of production, private capital ( $K$ )and labor $(L)$ . This follows from the constant returns-to-scale assumption on the production technology coupled with competitive factor markets. Hence, since $Y_{L}=w$ , the labor share of income is given by $\\theta_{L}=w L/Y$ . If $\\sigma\\ll1$ (panel (a)), aggregate income ( $Y$ ) goes up but capital income $(Y_{K}K)$ goes down (since $Y_{K}$ is constant in the long run and $K$ falls). So, labor income $(w L)$ must go up relative to $Y$ ， meaning that the labor share of income ( $\\theta_{L}=w L/Y$ ) increases. If, on the contrary, $\\sigma>1$ (panel (b)), then the increase in aggregate income is much larger than in panel (a), but the difference is fully employed in remunerating capital. So, $Y$ goes up relative to $w L$ and the labor income share falls.  \n\n## 3 Empirical analysis  \n\nWe now turn to estimating the effect of government investment on the labor share using panel data for developed and developing countries. To motivate our analysis, we first take a quick informal glance at the evolution of the two variables and their relationship over time. Subsequently, we describe the formal empirical model to estimate, the data, the properties of the variables in terms of unit roots, and the estimation results.  \n\n### 3.1 Government investment and the labor share: a glance at the data  \n\nFigure 1 plots the evolution of the cross-country average labor share (solid line, left axis) and government public investment (dashed line, right axis) over time. Panels (a) to (c) use TCB data for the labor share, which include both developed and developing countries but only cover the period 1990-2017 (Section 3.3 describes the sources and definitions of the data in more detail). In panel (a), the average labor share across all countries (TCB data) declined gradually from 1990 to 2007, when the Great Recession hit, but increased somewhat afterwards. Over the whole sample period, however, the general pattern indicates a global decline of the labor share. Government investment followed a similar pattern, showing a general decline up to 2005, increasing between 2005 and 2009, only to fall again until 2017. The relationship between the labor share and government investment is clearly positive for most of the sample, but seems to weaken somewhat after the Great Recession.  \n\nBut this overall pattern hides different patterns for developed and developing countries. As depicted in panel (b), both the labor share and government investment have generally trended downwards in developed countries over the period 1990-2017, with noticeable spikes after the Great Recession. As shown in panel (c), however, the profiles of the labor share and government investment for developing countries are strikingly different. The labor share in these countries generally declines up to 2005, and increases afterwards. Government investment follows an even more erratic pattern, generally declining up to 2007, then experiencing a large increase until 2010, and slightly falling after that. The co-movement between the labor share and government investment seems to be stronger in developed countries than in developing countries.  \n\nFinally, panel (d) plots the same variables but using labor share data from the AMECO database, which extends the sample back to 1960 but only includes developed countries. This figure reveals that the labor share was roughly stable during the 1960s, starting to decline in the late 1970s and, more strongly, in the early 1980s. Government investment in these countries was actually rising in the 1960s and started to fall in the mid 1970s. As in panel (b), there is a clear positive association between the labor share and government investment in developed countries. Overall, Figure 1 suggests that the labor share is positively correlated with government investment, and that this relationship may be weaker in developing countries. For this reason, we incorporate this distinction between the two groups of countries into our formal empirical analysis.  \n\n### 3.2  Specification and estimation  \n\nTo estimate the impact of government investment, $G I$ , on the labor share, $L S$ , in our panel, we specify the following regression equation for country $i$ in year $t$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{L S_{i t}=a_{0}+a_{1}G I_{i t}+C o n t r o l s+u_{i t},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $a_{0}$ is either a constant or, if country fixed effects are assumed, a vector of countryspecific constants, and $u_{i t}$ is the error term. The coefficient of interest is $a_{1}$ , which measures the marginal effect of government investment on the labor share. When allowing for heterogeneous effects of government investment for developed and developing countries, we include the interaction term $G I_{i t}\\cdot D_{i}$ , with coefficient $\\alpha_{2}$ , as an additional variable on the right-hand side, where $D_{i}$ is a binary variable indicating whether country $i$ is a developing country (one if so, zero otherwise). With this variable included, the marginal impact of government investment for developed countries ( $D_{i}=0$ ) is still measured by $a_{1}$ , while the marginal effect for developing countries ( $D_{i}=1$ ) is measured by $a_{1}+a_{2}$ . We also control for confounding factors by including a set of control variables, which are discussed below. Note that government investment is scaled by GDP. All variables are expressed in levels.  \n\nStandard estimation methods, such as OLS, may lead to spurious results if the variables in the regression model are non-stationary. Spurious results arise whenever the non-stationary variables possess unrelated stochastic trends, which dominate the behavior of the variables over time and are thus picked up by the regression model as (erroneously) indicating a relationship between them. The exception is the special case when there is some linear combination between the non-stationary variables that is itself stationary. Because, in this case, the variables share the same stochastic trend, they are said to be cointegrated. When applied to cointegrated variables, standard methods such as OLS result become superconsistent, approaching the true parameters values at a faster rate. It is thus important to assess the stationarity properties of the variables before estimating the regression model. We do so by means of panel unit root tests in Section 3.4.  \n\nWe extend the regression model to include several control variables and deterministic terms. First, since the labor share shows quite some persistence over time, as shown below in Section 3.4, we include one lag of the dependent variable as an additional explanatory variable. Although it may introduce a bias in the presence of fixed effects (see below), allowing for dynamics in the dependent variable may capture the partial adjustment of the dependent variable towards the steady state (see, e.g., Baltagi, Demetriades, and Law, 2009). Second, because the relationship between the labor share and government investment may be confounded by the countries’ level of economic development and economic structure even within the country groups considered (i.e., developed and developing), we also consider GDP per capita and trade openness (i.e., the sum of imports and exports as a share of GDP) as control variables. Finally, we include a deterministic time trend in the model. Given the presence of negative trends in the labor share and government investment over the sample period, which are found to be deterministic in Section 3.4, allowing for a deterministic time trend is important to reduce the probability of finding spurious relationships.  \n\nWe estimate the regression model using two methods. First, we employ the standard Fixed Effects (FE) estimator, which models the unobserved heterogeneity across countries in an additive fashion by means of country-specific constant terms (collected in vector $a_{0}$ ).Any country-specific effects are thus picked up by these country-specific constant terms, implying that the identification of the remaining parameters of the model is achieved through the variation in the data over the time dimension. But the FE estimator may be biased in our model, given the inclusion of the lagged dependent variable (Nickell, 1981). Moreover, some of the explanatory variables may be endogenous with respect to the labor share. To address these endogeneity issues, we also use the system Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) estimator (Arellano and Bover, 1995; Blundell and Bond, 1998), which is preferable to the first-difference GMM estimator (Arellano and Bond, 1991) when the dependent variable exhibits time persistence and the number of observations over the time dimension is relatively small. As instruments, we employ the second lag of the labor share and the first lag of government investment, which are the latest valid instruments under the assumptions of the model.  \n\n### 3.3  Data definitions and sources  \n\nThe data on government investment are obtained from the International Monetary Fund's \"Investment and Capital Stock Dataset, 1960-2017\" (January 2019 version). This dataset includes annual data on investment fows and capital stocks of both the private and the public sectors for 170 developed and developing countries 0ver the period 1960-2017 (IMF, 2019). We construct the government investment variable from this dataset by taking gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) of the general government (variable ‘igov-rppp' in the dataset), which includes both the central government and subnational government layers, and dividing it by GDP (variable ‘GDP rppp' in the dataset), both measured at constant 2011 international dollars. To make the data comparable across countries, the dataset definition of government investment excludes alternative modes of investment, such as investment grants, loan guarantees, tax concessions, operations of public financial institutions (e.g., development banks), and government-backed saving schemes (IMF, 2019). In terms of allocation, public investment is mostly spent in the functioning of economic affairs, such as transportation and energy (with an average share of $34.4\\%$ across OECD countries in 2017), followed by defence (15.4%), and education (15.1%) (OECD, 2019). Other functions include general public services (9.3%), health care (8.4%), and, to a smaller degree, housing (5.1%), environmental protection (4.5%), public order and safety (3.5%), and social protection (1.6%) (fgures from 2015; see OECD, 2017). No major changes have taken place in the allocation of public investment across different functions in recent years (for 2007 figures, see Jager and Schmidt, 2016). Hence, despite including also elements of social spending, we view our measure of government investment as a convenient proxy for public infrastructure.  \n\nFor the labor share, we obtain data from different sources based on different methodologies. A first measure of the labor share is obtained from the “Total Economy Database\", provided by The Conference Board (TCB); it covers 130 countries and ranges from 1990 to 2017.8 The TCB's labor share data measure the proportion of labor income relative to total income based on the compensation of employees and mixed income data from the national accounts. Accounting for mixed incomes, a convenient adjustment that is standard in the literature, requires the assumption that self-employed workers have the same wage rate as employees.9 In the case of data unavailability, some adjustments are also made based on common wages and hours or, if this is not possible, on estimates from the Penn World Tables or the Asian Productivity Organization. The TCB data also assume a labor share of $50\\%$ for countries with missing data. However, we eliminate these assumed values from the data. After combining the TCB's labor share data with the IMF's government investment data, we obtain a panel dataset encompassing 79 countries (38 developed and 41 developing) over the period 1990 to 2017, which yields a sample of 2,156 observations (see Table 1 for a description of the countries included in the panel).  \n\nA second measure of the labor share used in this paper comes from the AMECO database, the Annual Macro-ECOnomic database of the European Commission's Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs. One advantage of the AMECO data is its longer time dimension, dating back to 1960 for some countries. This advantage comes at the cost of a much smaller country dimension, however, covering only 41 developed countries. In the AMECO's database, the labor share is defined as the adjusted wage share as a percentage of GDP at current prices and measured by the compensation per employee (including wages, salaries, and the employer's social contributions) as a fraction of GDP at market prices per employed person (variable ALCDo in the database). Again, this measure requires assuming that self-employed workers have the same wage rate as employees. The correlation coefficient between the overlapping labor share data in the AMECO database and in the TCB database amounts to 0.66 (counting only those observations for which government investment data are also available). After combining the AMECO's labor share data with the IMF's government investment data, we obtain a panel of 37 developed countries over the period 1970 to 2017, yielding a sample of 1,513 observations (see Table 1 for a description of the countries included in the panel).  \n\nFinally, we also use the labor share data provided by Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014), which cover 59 countries for various years in the period 1975-2012. However, most observations correspond to developed countries in more recent years. When combined with the available data for government investment, this third measure gives rise to a panel containing 868 observations for 37 countries. Given this much smaller sample size, we employ the TCB and AMECO data in our baseline estimations and use the Karabarbounis and Neiman's data only as a robustness check. Note that the correlation coefficient between the overlapping labor share data from Karabarbounis and Neiman and from the TCB database is only 0.55; between Karabarbounis and Neiman's and AMECO's labor share data it is even lower, at 0.35 (counting only those observations for which government investment data are also available). Notwithstanding these data differences, however, the results are broadly consistent across the three measures of the labor share (see Sections 3.5 and 3.6).  \n\nThe World Bank classifies countries into five income groups, as indicated in the numbered categories in Table 1. We define a country as developed if it belongs to one of the first two income groups (high income developed OECD countries and other high income countries), and as developing otherwise. As mentioned above, some models include GDP per capita and trade openness as control variables. GDP per capita is simply aggregate real GDP divided by population. Trade openness is defined as the total value of international trade (i.e., the sum of exports and imports) as a fraction of aggregate GDP. We obtain data for both variables from the World Development Indicators of the World Bank.  \n\nA few remarks on the data are in order before we proceed with the analysis. First, recent research has identified some measuring issues that could cause a decline in the labor share as a statistical artifact. These issues include the treatment of capital depreciation, indirect taxes, and housing capital (Rognlie, 2015; Bridgman, 2018; Cette et al, 2020), self-employment (Gollin, 2002; Elsby et al, 2013; Cette et al, 2020), and intangible capital (Koh et al, 2020). Although some of these factors may imply relatively large effects on the data, they typically account for a modest share of the labor share decline. Second, government investment data are often of poor quality in developing countries (Gurara et al, 2017), which raises the possibility of measurement error in this variable. Measurement error is more serious in government investment (the explanatory variable) than in the labor share (the dependent variable), since it may cause attenuation bias (i.e., a bias towards zero) in the effect of the former on the latter. In view of these limitations, our results should be taken with some caution.  \n\n### 3.4  Time series properties of the main variables  \n\nAs discussed in Section 3.2, it is important to assess whether the variables are stationary before estimating the regression model. This section conducts panel unit root (PUR) tests on government investment and the labor share, the main variables in the model. The presence of a trend in the data is clear from a quick inspection of the time plot, especially in the case of the labor share in developed countries, as discussed in Section 3.1. The question now is whether this trend should be treated as deterministic or stochastic. If, when allowing for a linear time trend, the PUR tests indicate no unit root in the data, then we conclude that the variables are stationary around a deterministic linear trend. If, on the contrary, the PUR tests suggest the presence of one unit root in the data, then we conclude that the trend is stochastic and the variables are non-stationary. This last case would require some respecification of the model, usually involving first-differencing the variables and possibly allowing for cointegration in the context of an error correction model. As shown below, however, most PUR tests strongly suggest that the variables are (trend) stationary over the sample period, implying that the regression model (18) can be estimated using standard estimation methods.  \n\nWe employ three PUR tests, namely the Im-Pesaran-Shin (IPS) test, the Fisher-augmented Dickey-Fuller (Fisher-ADF) test, and the Levin-Lin-Chu (LLC) test.10 The null hypothesis in the IPS and Fisher-ADF tests is that all countries contain unit roots in their time series (i.e., non-stationarity), whereas the alternative hypothesis is that there is no unit root in the time series of least one country (i.e., stationarity). The LLC test estimates a single common autoregressive coefficient for all countries. The null hypothesis is then that this autoregressive coeffcient is one (i.e., one unit root), against the alternative hypothesis that it is less than one (i.e., no unit root). Note that these tests assume cross-sectional independence. In view of the macroeconomic links between countries, this assumption may not hold true in our data. One way of accounting for this issue involves demeaning the data prior to conducting the test. Hence, we conduct all PUR tests with and without demeaning the variables.  \n\nTable 2 reports the results of the PUR tests for the labor share variable $(L S)$ .We organize the results according to the source of data, presenting the results for the TCB data in panel (a) and the results for the AMECO data in panel (b). In both cases, all tests are conducted with only a constant, and with both a constant a time trend. We find the latter procedure more sound, however, in view of the possibility of trend stationarity. When using the TCB data, we also perform the tests separately for developed and developing countries. As shown in Table 2, the results overwhelmingly suggest that the labor share is (trend) stationary, with most p-values falling below the $1\\%$ significance level. The evidence for stationarity of the labor share is weaker when the demeaned TCB data are used for all countries, developed and developed. When considered separately, however, all tests for developed countries and all but the Fisher-ADF test for developing countries indicate stationarity at conventional significance levels. It is important to note this distinction, since it is explicitly incorporated into our regression analysis.  \n\nWe follow the same procedure for the government investment variable $(G I)$ .The results are displayed in Table 3, following a similar structure to those presented in Table 2. First, notice that the results are very similar for the unadjusted and the demeaned data, suggesting a lesser role of cross-sectional dependence in the government investment data than that found for the labor share data (see Table 2). Second, with the single exception of the Fisher-ADF test applied to the panel of developed countries, all tests clearly reject the null hypothesis of non-stationary in all cases. Hence, the results suggest, by and the large, that government investment is also stationary. We proceed to estimate the regression model under this assumption.  \n\n### 3.5 Estimation results  \n\nWe now turn to estimating the regression equation (18). Table 4 reports the estimation results using the FE estimator, whereas Table 5 presents the results using the system GMM estimator. Both tables are organized in the same way. Columns (1) to (3) report the results using the TCB data for all countries, first with no controls and without distinguishing between developed and developing countries (i.e., implicitly setting $\\alpha_{2}=0$ ), then with no controls but allowing for different effects of government investment in developed and developing countries, and, fnally, also with controls. Columns (4) and (5) report the results for the TCB data only for developed countries with and without controls, respectively. The analogous results for developing countries are presented in columns (6) and (7). Finally, columns (8) and (9) show the results for the AMECO data (only developed countries) with and without controls, respectively. All regressions include one lag of the dependent variable (Lagged $L S$ ),a linear time trend, and fixed country effects (not reported). For each variable in each regression, we report the corresponding coefficient estimate and its standard errors in parentheses. All reported standard errors are clustered at the country level.  \n\nStarting off with the FE estimates in Table 4, the effect of government investment on the labor share is generally positive and statistically significant. The effect seems to be weak and borderline significant when pooled for all countries using TCB data (column (1)). However, when estimated separately for developed and developing countries (column (2)), one finds that government investment only affects the labor share in the former group; in developing countries, in contrast, the effect is close to nil ( $-0.019=0.183-0.202$ ).Controlling for GDP per capita and trade oppenness further increases the estimated effect in developed countries (column (3)). Very similar results emerge from estimating the full regression only for developed countries (columns (4) and (5)), and only for developing countries (columns (6) and (7)). The effect of government investment on the labor share using TCB data for developed countries is also consistent with that based on the AMECO data, as shown in columns (8) and (9), which is slightly smaller but still highly significant.  \n\nThe coeffcients of the remaining variables are quite stable across regressions. First, the dependent variable is quite persistent, as measured by the coefficient of the lagged dependent variable (above 0.8 in most cases). Second, the time trend slopes downwards, as expected, and is almost always statistically significant (the exception being in developing countries). Third, regarding the controls, GDP per capital is almost always statistically insignificant and only trade openness seems to matter. In any case, the inclusion of the controls makes little difference to the estimated effect of government investment on the labor share.  \n\nDespite addressing the biases that may arise from the simultaneous inclusion of fixed effects and a lagged dependent variable and from the potential endogeneity in the regressors (see Section 3.2), the system GMM estimates reported in Table 5 are broadly consistent with the FE estimates shown in Table 4. Again, we find a positive and statistically significant effect of government investment on the labor share for developed countries, but not for developing countries, where the effect is close to nil. The system GMM estimates differ from the FE estimates in two important ways, however. First, the magnitude of the effect of government investment in developed countries is almost twice as large. Second, the time trend looses its explanatory power. The system GMM estimator thus attributes a larger role to government investment and a lesser role to other causes embedded in the time trend (e.g., technological change) in explaining the decline of the labor share in developed countries.  \n\nRegarding the diagnostic tests of the system GMM approach, displayed at the bottom of Table 5, the Hansen test of over-identifying restrictions safely accepts the additional instruments in all cases. We also generally find first-order autocorrelation (as expected) and no second-order autocorrelation (which is important to validate the instruments). The exceptions are the regressions estimates with TCB data for developed countries reported in columns (4) and (5), where we reject the null of no second-order autocorrelation. This may invalidate the use of the instruments and introduce some bias. We find reassuring, however, the fact that no anomaly is detected for the AMECO data, while giving rise to almost identical estimates.  \n\n### 3.6 Robustness  \n\nWe check the robustness of our results along two dimensions. First, we re-estimate the regression models described in Section 3.5 using a robust-regression method, which accounts for the presence of outliers by assigning less weight to those observations that lie farther from the regression line.1l The results are shown in Table 6. Except for some small quantitative differences, our main results from Section 3.5 are largely unaffected.  \n\nSecond, we re-estimate the regressions employing the labor share data compiled by Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014). The FE estimates are reported in Table 7, whereas the system GMM estimates are provided in Table 8. Again, we do not find any major change to our previous results. We find again a positive and statistically significant effect of government investment on the labor share in developed countries—which slightly increases in magnitude but not in developing countries.  \n\n# 4 Discussion  \n\nOur empirical analysis uncovers a positive effect of government investment on the labor share in developed economies. This result is consistent with our theoretical model, which predicts a positive steady-state relationship between public investment and the labor share if (i) public capital augments private capital and (ii) the elasticity of substitution is less than one. These conditions are empirically plausible. Although we are unaware of empirical evidence regarding the type of factor-augmentation of public capital, some types of public investment are likely to augment private capital, at least in part. This may be especially the case for some types of so-called ^core' infrastructure capital— such as roads and highways, water systems, or energy systems—which directly complement the stock of capital of private firms. For example, building a new highway (or improving an existing one) may directly augment the productivity of private cargo trucks. Regarding the elasticity of substitution, the bulk of empirical evidence indeed suggests values well below one (Chirinko, 2008; Gechert et al, 2019; Knoblach and Stockl, 2020).  \n\nA positive effect of government investment on the labor share naturally implies that cuts in government investment lower the labor share. As noted in Section 3.1, government investment has gradually declined in many advanced economies since the 1970s. Hence, our results suggest that cuts in government investment may explain, at least in part, the labor share declines in developed countries. Although this explanation for the decline of labor shares is theoretically incompatible with those based on capital accumulation by Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) and Piketty (2014), which require elasticities of substitution greater than one, it potentially complements others based on labor-augmenting technical progress (Lawrence, 2015; AlvarezCuadrado, Long, and Poschke, 2018; del Rio and Lores, 2019), changes in labor market institutions (Jaumotte and Tytel, 2007; Ciminelli, Duval, and Furceri, 2020; Stansbury and Summers, 2020), and concentration of market power in ésuperstar firms’ (Autor et al, 2017, 2020; Dixon and Lim, 2017; Barkai, 2020; De Loecker, Eeckhout, and Unger, 2020). Given the link between changes in the labor share and the personal distribution of income, the low ratios of government investment to GDP may have contributed to the rise in income inequality observed in developed economies over the last few decades (e.g., Piketty, 2014).  \n\nWe do not find any effect of government investment on the labor share in developing countries, however. Our analytic result (17) allows us to explore a few tentative explanations for this result. One possible reason concerns the productivity of government investment in developing countries. Pritchett (2000) shows that these countries generally face serious bottlenecks associated with government investment, whereby a given investment effort does not translate into an equivalent increment in the stock of public capital (see also DablaNorris et al, 2012; and Gupta et al, 2014). The effective stock of public capital is thus much lower than what can be inferred from the accumulation and depreciation of the government investment fows. By lowering the economic returns to government investment in developing countries, these inefficiencies also decrease its effect on the labor share, according to equation (17). Moreover, public capital might be less capital-augmenting in developing countries. Although we are not aware of any empirical study explicitly focusing on the factor-bias of public capital in these countries, indirect evidence for this hypothesis is provided by An, Kangur, and Papageorgiou (2019), who find that public capital is more substitutable (i.e., less complementary) to private capital in emerging and low-income economies than in advanced countries.  \n\nA second reason that may explain the absence of an effect in developing countries concerns the elasticity of substitution between private capital and labor, which could be larger and closer to one in these countries. But it is unclear whether this is a plausible empirical possibility. Some studies using data at the firm or industry level often find smaller elasticities of substitution in industries with a larger proportion of high-skilled workers (Schwellnus et al, 2018) and larger elasticities of substitution in the agriculture sector (Herrendorf, Herrington, and Valentinyi, 2015). According to this evidence, one would expect those economies with proportionally larger sectors that are intensive in unskilled labor, which is typically the case in developing countries, to also feature larger aggregate elasticities of substitution. However, some direct evidence based on country-level data suggests otherwise. Duffy and Papageorgiou (2000), for instance, find that the elasticitiy of substitution in developing countries is not only lower than one but also lower than in advanced economies.  \n\nAs alluded to in Section 3.3, one last reason for the statistically insignificant effects found in developing countries is purely statistical and involves measurement error in government investment. Given the general poor quality of macroeconomic data in developing countries, it is likely that government investment is measured with error in these countries (see, e.g..  \n\nGurara et al, 2017). If present, measurement error causes attenuation bias, which means that the effect of government investment on the labor share is biased towards zero. In our view, this is a particularly plausible explanation for the lack of an effect in developing countries.  \n\n# 5 Conclusions  \n\nThis paper has analyzed the relationship between government investment and the labor share. Motivated by the observation that both variables have shown similar declining patters over the last decades, especially in developed countries, we have argued that there is a fundamental link between them. At a theoretical level, we have shown how a simple analytic steady-state relationship arises from a general equilibrium model embedding a production function with a constant elasticity of substitution and factor-biased government capital. At an empirical level, we have provided strong reduced-form evidence of a positive association between the ratio of government investment to GDP and the labor share in developed countries. For developing countries, in contrast, we have found a weak and statistically insignificant relationship.  \n\nAccording to our results, government investment spending may be an important determinant of the labor share. A lower labor share, in turn, has been found to be strongly associated with lower welfare, higher inequality, and lower growth. Thus, our results suggest that, besides its well-documented efficiency role in sustaining economic growth, government investment may also play an important role in promoting economic equity.  \n\nThis paper has also opened some avenues for future research. The finding of no clear effect between government investment and the labor share in developing countries, in particular, may owe to several factors that deserve closer theoretical and empirical scrutiny. Perhaps government investment is yet too inefficiently allocated in these countries. Or the high borrowing costs typically faced by these countries hinder its effectiveness. Or the quality of the data does not allow for a proper assessment of its role. From a theory perspective, maybe we should model these economies differently, relaxing the small open economy assumption and allowing, for instance, for imperfect capital mobility and restricted access to international financial markets. Future research should delve into these questions.  \n\n# Appendix  \n\n## A.1  Reduced-form multipliers  \n\nTo derive the steady-state multipliers of public investment in reduced form, start by fully differentiating equations (4) and (5) with respect to $I_{G}$ using the chain rule:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{K}\\frac{d K}{d I_{G}}}&{=}&{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\eta-\\eta_{K}(1-\\sigma)}{\\theta_{L}K_{G}}\\frac{d K_{G}}{d I_{G}}+\\frac{1}{L}\\frac{d L}{d I_{G}}}\\ {\\displaystyle\\frac{\\sigma}{Y_{L}}\\frac{d w}{d I_{G}}}&{=}&{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\theta_{K}}{K}\\frac{d K}{d I_{G}}+\\frac{\\eta-\\eta_{L}(1-\\sigma)}{K_{G}}\\frac{d K_{G}}{d I_{G}}-\\frac{\\theta_{K}}{L}\\frac{d L}{d I_{G}}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nSimilarly, fully differentiating equation (13) with respect to $I_{G}$ gives  \n\n$$\n(1-L)\\frac{d w}{d I_{G}}-w\\frac{d L}{d I_{G}}=(1-\\varepsilon)\\frac{d X}{d I_{G}}.\n$$  \n\nImposing the conditions $\\dot{A}=0$ and $\\dot{X}=0$ in (14) and (15) while noting that $w L-C=w-X$ and $T=I_{G}$ (in the former) results in two equations that jointly describe the steady-state equilibrium in the household subsystem:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{X}}&{{=}}&{{r A+w-I_{G},}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{X}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\beta(\\alpha+\\beta)}{r-\\alpha}A.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThese equations can be fully differentiated with respect to $I_{G}$ as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{\\displaystyle{\\frac{d X}{d I_{G}}}}}&{{=}}&{{r\\displaystyle{\\frac{d A}{d I_{G}}}+\\frac{d w}{d I_{G}}}-1,}}\\ {{\\displaystyle{\\omega_{A}\\frac{d X}{d I_{G}}}}}&{{=}}&{{r\\displaystyle{\\omega_{X}\\frac{d A}{d I_{G}}},}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\omega_{X}\\equiv X/Y$ is ratio of full consumption to output and $\\omega_{A}\\equiv r A/Y$ is the ratio of financial income to output. For future reference, note that $\\omega_{X}-\\omega_{A}>0$ ,since $X-r A=$ $w-I_{G}=w-T>0$  \n\nEquations (A.1)-(A.5) form a system of five equations in five unknowns, which can be represented in matrix notation as  \n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{c c c c c}{{w}}&{{-(1-L)}}&{{0}}&{{1-\\varepsilon}}&{{0}}\\ {{\\frac{\\theta_{K}}{L}}}&{{\\frac{\\sigma}{Y_{L}}}}&{{-\\frac{\\theta_{K}}{K}}}&{{0}}&{{0}}\\ {{-\\frac{1}{L}}}&{{0}}&{{\\frac{1}{K}}}&{{0}}&{{0}}\\ {{0}}&{{1}}&{{0}}&{{-1}}&{{r}}\\ {{0}}&{{0}}&{{0}}&{{\\omega_{A}}}&{{-r\\omega_{X}}}\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{{\\frac{d L}{d I_{G}}}}\\ {{\\frac{d w}{d I_{G}}}}\\ {{\\frac{d K}{d I_{G}}}}\\ {{\\frac{d X}{d I_{G}}}}\\ {{\\frac{d A}{d I_{G}}}}\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{{0}}\\ {{\\frac{\\eta-\\eta_{L}(1-\\sigma)}{I_{G}}}}\\ {{\\frac{\\eta-\\eta_{K}(1-\\sigma)}{I_{G}}}}\\ {{1}}\\ {{0}}\\end{array}\\right],\n$$  \n\nwhere we have used that $d K_{G}/d I_{G}=K_{G}/I_{G}$  \n\nSolving this system gives, after some algebraic simplifications, the following steady-state  \n\nmultipliers for labor employment and wages:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{\\displaystyle\\frac{d L}{d I_{G}}}&{=}&{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\omega_{L L}}{w}\\left(\\frac{\\theta_{L}-\\eta}{\\omega_{X}-\\omega_{A}}\\right),}\\ {\\displaystyle\\frac{d w}{d I_{G}}}&{=}&{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\eta(1+\\omega_{L L})}{\\omega_{G}},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\omega_{L L}\\equiv(1-L)/L$ is the leisure-labor ratio and $\\omega_{G}\\equiv I_{G}/Y$ is the ratio of public investment to output. According to these expressions, the wage multiplier is unambiguously positive, whereas the labor multiplier can, in theory, take on any sign, depending on the relative magnitudes of $\\theta_{L}$ and $\\eta$ (recall that $\\omega_{X}-\\omega_{A}>0$ ). From a practical point of view, however, it is reasonable to assume that $\\theta_{L}>\\eta$ , in which case the labor multiplier is positive. Importantly, although both multipliers depend on the output elasticity of public capital $(\\eta)$ ， they depend neither on the particular type of factor augmentation ( $\\eta_{K}$ and $\\eta_{L}$ ） nor on the elasticity of substitution $(\\sigma)$ . Hence, while the overall spillover effect of public capital matters for the labor market, its factor-bias potential does not.  \n\nThe reduced-form multiplier of private capital is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d K}{d I_{G}}=\\frac{\\omega_{K}}{\\theta_{L}}\\left[\\frac{\\eta-\\eta_{K}(1-\\sigma)}{\\omega_{G}}+\\omega_{L L}\\left(\\frac{\\theta_{L}-\\eta}{\\omega_{X}-\\omega_{A}}\\right)\\right],\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\omega_{K}\\equiv K/Y$ is the ratio of private capital to output. This multiplier can be negative or positive depending on the relative sizes of the two terms inside brackets. Assuming that the second term is positive (which holds if the labor multiplier is positive), the multiplier of private capital is also positive if, moreover, $\\eta_{K}=0$ or $\\sigma\\geq1$ . But if public capital is $K$ -augmenting $\\eta_{K}>0$ ), the multiplier can be negative for an elasticity of substitution sufficiently below one ( $\\sigma\\ll1$ ), as depicted in panel (a) of Figure 2.  \n\nThe reduced-form multipliers of full consumption ( $X$ )and financial wealth ( $A$ )are given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{\\displaystyle\\frac{d X}{d I_{G}}}&{=}&{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\omega_{X}}{\\omega_{X}-\\omega_{A}}\\left[\\frac{\\eta(1+\\omega_{L L})}{\\omega_{G}}-1\\right],}\\ {\\displaystyle\\frac{d A}{d I_{G}}}&{=}&{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\omega_{A}}{r(\\omega_{X}-\\omega_{A})}\\left[\\frac{\\eta(1+\\omega_{L L})}{\\omega_{G}}-1\\right],}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhich can also be negative or positive, depending on the sign of the term in brackets.  \n\nFinally, we can use these multipliers to find the reduced-form multiplier of output. Fully differentiating the production function (1) with respect to $I_{G}$ gives  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d Y}{d I_{G}}=\\theta_{K}\\frac{Y}{K}\\frac{d K}{d I_{G}}+\\theta_{L}\\frac{Y}{L}\\frac{d L}{d I_{G}}+\\eta\\frac{Y}{K_{G}}\\frac{d K_{G}}{d I_{G}}.\n$$  \n\nAfter substituting the reduced-form expressions (A.7) and (A.9) into (A.10) and performing  \n\nsome algebraic simplifications, one arrives at  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d Y}{d I_{G}}=\\frac{\\eta-\\eta_{K}(1-\\sigma)\\theta_{K}}{\\theta_{L}\\omega_{G}}+\\frac{\\omega_{L L}}{\\theta_{L}}\\left(\\frac{\\theta_{L}-\\eta}{\\omega_{X}-\\omega_{A}}\\right),\n$$  \n\nwhose sign is unambiguously positive if public capital is not $K$ -augmenting $\\eta_{K}~=~0$ ）or the elasticity of substitution is greater or equal than one （ $\\sigma\\geq1$ ), provided that $\\theta_{L}\\geq\\eta$ (in which case the labor multiplier is also positive). However, it can be negative if public capital augments private capital ( $\\eta_{K}>0$ )and the elasticity of substitution is sufficiently smaller than one ( $\\sigma\\ll1$ ). The important aspect to retain from this result is that, for a given output elasticity of public capital, larger degrees of $K$ -augmentation (large $\\eta_{K}$ )and lower substitutability between factors (small $O$ ) lead to smaller steady-state output effects of public investment.  \n\n![](images/1ccddccaf58dc6e07de21d38d3c02fbbeeb8603378be447504a1c41486488475.jpg)  \nFigure 1: The evolution

They come in many different forms and with many different characteristics.\"  \n\n- Commissioner Luis Aguilar, SEC, April 2013  \n\n## 1 Introduction  \n\nInstitutional equity ownership has risen dramatically in the last 30 years, inviting a more thorough investigation into its effects on firm valuation and operations. In the 1980s, institutional investors held approximately 20%-30% of the average frm (with individual investors making up the rest). By the 2010s, over 65% of the average frm is owned by institutional investors.1 This increase in institutional holdings coincides with the growing sophistication of markets and growing importance of corporate governance. Indeed, much of the literature focuses on the informed \"smart money” of the institutional investor in contrast to the less sophisticated individual “retail\" investor. Barber and Odean (2008) confirm that, unlike institutions, individual investors are net buyers of attention-grabbing stocks due to limited search resources. This ability of institutional investors to gather information and impose market discipline on management should translate into improvements in market efficiency and asset valuation. For example, Sias and Starks (1997) find that institutional trading increases the speed of adjustment of information into prices and Nagel (2005) finds that short sale constraints bind for stocks with low institutional ownership, resulting in underperformance.  \n\nYet, as suggested in a speech by Commissioner Luis Aguilar of the SEC,2 not all institutional owners are alike nor do they have similar effects on firms. While many characteristics differentiate institutional investors from one another, portfolio turnover and holdings concentration are the most fundamental. For example, Bushee (1998, 2001) finds that short-term, low concentration (\"transient\") investors lead to myopic investment decision-making by managers and over-weighting of near-term expected earnings to the detriment of long-term earnings. As such, myopic investment behavior leads to myopic corporate decision-making, potentially destroying long-run value for the frm. In addition, Yan and Zhang (2009) show that the pricing impact of large institutional investors is largely driven by short-term investors reacting and trading on new information. These findings suggest that, subsets of institutional investors with different holdings horizons and portfolio concentrations may have differential impact on corporate decisions and firm valuation.  \n\nIn this paper, we study the impact of different institutional investor types on the valuation, corporate governance, and future performance of firms. Specifically, we focus on two fundamental investor characteristics, portfolio turnover and holdings concentration. We begin by using the Bushee (1998, 2001) classification of institutions into “transient” and “dedicated\" investor types. Institutional investors are “transient” if they take small positions in the frms they hold and have high portfolio turnover. Due to a short investment horizon and lack of focus on particular frms, these investors are likely to be myopic traders looking for short-term gains. On the other hand, \"dedicated\" investors take highly concentrated positions in the firms they hold and have low portfolio turnover. Both of these portfolio characteristics suggest dedicated investors are more likely to invest for the long run, gathering costly firm-specific information and trading on growth potential of a firm. Bushee (1998) finds evidence consistent with this interpretation as firms with predominantly dedicated (transient) institutional owners invest more (less) in R&D. Figure 1 shows that transient institutional investors comprise an increasingly large portion of the total institutional investor pool over time, making an investigation into the effects of different institutional investor types particularly relevant.  \n\nWe find that frms with higher percentages of transient (dedicated) institutional investors experience more (less) subsequent overvaluation and misvaluation. Specifically, using the RhodesKropf, Robinson, and Viswanathan (2005) book-to-market decomposition, frms with more transient (dedicated) institutional investors experience more (less) positive firm-specific deviation from fundamental values in the following quarter, consistent with overvaluation. They also experience more (less) of an absolute deviation from fundamental value in the next quarter, consistent with misvaluation. Furthermore, firms that experience an increase in their percentage of transient (dedicated) institutional investors experience more (less) overvaluation and misvaluation in the next quarter.  These effects persist after controlling for common firm characteristics that may impact firm valuation and after considering alternative explanations such as perceived growth opportunities. In the appendix, we obtain similar results using alternative definitions of overvaluation and misvaluation based on the Hirshleifer and Jiang (2010) undervalued minus  \n\novervalued factor.3  \n\nWe posit that the differential impact of transient versus dedicated institutional investors on subsequent firm overvaluation and misvaluation is driven by differences in information gathering. To examine the information channel, we explore the relationship between institutional investor types and firm valuation around the enactment of SEC Regulation FD. Regulation FD, enacted in 20o0 by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, mandates that when an issuer discloses material non-public information to specific outsiders (e.g., analysts or institutional investors), this disclosure must be made public, thereby eliminating the informational advantage previously enjoyed by blockholders (Francis, Nanda, and Wang, 2006; Anderson, Reeb, Zhang, and Zhao, 2013). As such, this regulation addresses the problem of selective disclosure of material information and provides a natural experiment in which to test the information channel.  \n\nUsing a difference-in-difference framework we find that, as expected, Regulation FD has no significant impact on the relationship between dedicated investor ownership and subsequent overvaluation and misvaluation.  That is, dedicated institutional investor ownership reduces overvaluation and misvaluation to a similar degree before and after the regulation, consistent with their having access to information both prior to and after Regulation FD. On the other hand, the regulation significantly reduced the subsequent overvaluation and misvaluation for firms with above-median levels of transient investors relative to the preceding time period, consistent with transient investors having lower barriers to access of information previously only enjoyed by dedicated investors. These results do not exist using a placebo event year of 1995.  \n\nAlthough we use a model with lagged changes in institutional ownership type on overvaluation and misvaluation, the observed results may be due to self-selection by investors into certain types of firms rather than a causal effect of ownership type on firm valuation. We create samples matched exante on misvaluation in a difference-in-difference-in-difference framework to control for self-selection issues in the appendix. We obtain similar results.  \n\nHaving established that transient and dedicated institutional investors have differential impact on subsequent firm overvaluation and misvaluation, we next explore which of the associated portfolio characteristics - portfolio turnover or holdings concentration - is responsible for these findings to shed further light on the causes of differences between the two previously defined institutional types. We find that ownership by institutions in the lowest portfolio turnover tercile (i.e., long horizon investors) results in less firm-specific overvaluation as well as lower misvaluation relative to fundamentals in the subsequent quarter. Institutional ownership by investors in the highest portfolio turnover tercile also results in less overvaluation, but statistically insignificant misvaluation. Importantly, frms held by institutions that have diversified portfolios and either high or low portfolio turnover experience more future overvaluation.  \n\nFinally, we explore whether institutional ownership types also have differential effects on measures of risk, corporate governance, and future frm performance. We document that firms held by transient institutional investors have more expected tail risk, higher realized returns volatility, higher average and median executive compensation, worse accruals quality, lower payout ratios, and lower leverage increases relative to those held by dedicated institutional investors. Firms held by transient investors experience positive abnormal returns relative to the 5-factor model in the subsequent quarter, whereas those held by dedicated investors experience positive abnormal performance later in the year consistent with longer investment horizons. Firms held by dedicated investors experience positive raw returns over the subsequent four quarters, whereas those held by transient investors experience negative or insignificant raw returns over the same period.  \n\nThese findings enable us to contribute to the ongoing debate within extant literature over whether institutional investors benefit the markets, either through improvements in market efficiency or by providing corporate governance, or whether they harm them through opportunism and pressure exerted on managers to achieve short-term results at the expense of long-term performance. While the literature generally accepts that institutional investors are more informed and allow markets to be more effcient (Sias and Starks, 1997; Nagel, 2005; Barber and Odean, 2008), there are contradicting results and arguments among both academics and practitioners over the institutional benefits to governance and costs of induced myopia. For example, Gillian (1995), Karpoff, Malatesta, and Walkling (1996), Smith (1996), and Wahal (1996) find no long-term effects from shareholder activism while Nesbitt (1994) finds that firms targeted by CalPERS outperform in subsequent years. More recently, Brav, Jiang, Partnoy, and Thomas (2008) find a positive abnormal return for firms targeted by hedge fund activism and Boone and White (2015) find that higher institutional ownership is associated with greater management disclosure and lower information asymmetry. Conversely, a survey of over 1,0oo board members and executives around the world conducted by the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board and McKinsey and Company (Barton and Wiseman, 2014) draws attention to the effects of short-term investor pressure on corporate decision-making and its negative effects on value maximization. In this report, 79% of respondents felt pressured to demonstrate performance over a horizon of two years or less, and 44% used a horizon of three or less years to set corporate strategy while 86% stated that a longer horizon would have improved financial performance.  \n\nThese seemingly dissonant effects of institutional ownership on firm performance can be explained by the diferential effects we find for institutional ownership types. The conficting findings in the growing literature above suggest that combining all institutions into one category yields different, and likely mistaken, results than those that would be obtained by more refined categorizations. Indeed, among the papers that find benefits to corporate governance, most focus on a specific type of institutional investor (e.g., CalPERS or hedge funds) rather than institutional investors as a single group.  \n\nThe main contribution of our paper lies in identifying the distinct effects of institutional investor types and investment styles on subsequent firm overvaluation, misvaluation, governance measures, and realized future performance. Bushee (1998, 2001) groups institutional investors based on their portfolio turnover and holdings concentration and finds that “transient\" institutional investors are related to myopic corporate decision-making while “dedicated\" institutional investors are not. Gompers and Metrick (2001) find that large institutional investors invest in large companies, thereby increasing the prices of large stocks. Yan and Zhang (2009) show that these trends in large institutional investors is largely driven by short-term investors reacting and trading on new information. On the other hand, Gasper, Massa, and Matos (2005) show that acquisition targets held by short-term investors experience a lower premium and Chen, Harford, and Li (2007) find that only long-term investors are related to positive post-merger performance rather than focusing on short-term gains.  \n\nWe add to this growing literature by identifying how institutional investor types and their underlying portfolio turnover and holdings concentration affect the valuation, governance characteristics, and future performance of firms in which these institutions invest.  We find that dedicated institutional investor ownership results in more accurate future firm valuation, superior characteristics related to corporate governance, and superior long-term performance of the frm. The valuation effects are primarily improved by institutional investors with higher portfolio concentration and the governance and long-term performance effects by institutions with lower portfolio turnover. Specifically, we find that long-term institutions are able to achieve long-term performance: firms with more long-term institutional investors outperform firms with fewer of them by 2.8% on a risk-adjusted basis over the subsequent year.  \n\n## 2 Data  \n\n### 2.1 Institutional Ownership and Investor Types  \n\nWe start with data on institutional investor ownership obtained from the Thomson Reuters Institutional Holdings database.  The Thomson Reuters holdings database covers investment companies and their security holdings as reported on their 13F forms filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) every quarter.4  \n\nWe first classify institutional investor types based on the combination of portfolio turnover and holdings concentration from Bushee (1998, 2001) and Bushee and Noe (2000). Bushee (1998, 2001) categorizes institutional investors as “transient\", “\"quasi-indexer\", or “dedicated\" based on their investment horizons and portfolio concentration.5 Investors are classified as “transient” if they have short investment horizons refected by high portfolio turnover and highly diversified portfolio holdings.6 Analogously, “dedicated\" investors have long investment horizons refected by low portfolio turnover and focused portfolio holdings. The third class of investors, “quasiindexers\", are long-horizon, low turnover investors that are highly diversified. We focus our analysis on dedicated (DED) and transient (TRA) institutional investors as they both have an active choice in their investment strategy: dedicated investors do not trade frequently, but hold specifically selected frms (and are therefore different from the passive indexers), while transient investors trade frequently. We exclude the quasi-indexer institutional ownership type as the passive ownership strategy does not imply any asset selection in either the time horizon or portfolio choice dimensions.  \n\nTable I presents the top ten dedicated and transient institutional investors in our sample in decreasing order based on average portfolio size. As expected, the dedicated list of investors is comprised of investment management and insurance companies, which may be expected to hold stocks for long periods of time and some of which, like Berkshire Hathaway, are famous for it. On the other hand, many of the investment management frms on the transient list of investors are affliated with investment banks such as UBS, Morgan Stanley, and Oppenheimer.  \n\nTo further motivate the distinctions between the two types of institutional investors, we consider empirical differences in their portfolio characteristics. Table II demonstrates that dedicated and transient institutions have different investment styles, as reflected in their significantly different portfolio characteristics. Dedicated institutional investors have average portfolio sizes almost four times larger than transient investors, though they hold fewer stocks on average. Additionally, dedicated investors hold a larger percentage of each firm on average, and at the median, than transients do. They also have a significantly higher variation in these holdings, consistent with the large positions of dedicated blockholders.7 Notably, dedicated investors hold firms with smaller average and median market capitalizations that are almost half the size of those held by transients, with a correspondingly lower variability in owned-firm capitalizations. This is consistent with dedicated investors possessing an information advantage, as smaller and younger frms are more opaque and difficult to analyze (Hadlock and Pierce, 2010; Karpoff, Lee, Masulis, 2013). As expected, dedicated investors are also more focused, holding frms from fewer unique SIC3 industries and have a much higher Hirshleifer-Herfindahl concentration in portfolio weights than do transient investors. Reassuringly, consistent with the Bushee (1998, 2001) definition, dedicated investors do indeed have more concentrated positions in firms relative to total shares outstanding and have lower portfolio turnover than transients. All institutional investor characteristics between dedicated and transient institutional investors are significantly different at the 1% level.  \n\n### 2.2 Misvaluation  \n\nOur main measure of misvaluation is the Rhodes-Kropf, Robinson, and Viswanathan (2005), hereafter RKRV, decomposition which splits the logarithm of the market-to-book ratio into three components: firm-specific error, time-series sector error, and long-run market value to book value. The RKRV decomposition is provided in equation (3) of their paper and reproduced below:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{m_{i,t}-b_{i,t}=\\underbrace{m_{i,t}-v(\\theta_{i,t};a_{j,t})}_{f i r m}+\\underbrace{v(\\theta_{i,t};a_{j,t})-v(\\theta_{i,t};a_{j})}_{s e c t o r}+\\underbrace{v(\\theta_{i,t};a_{j})-b_{i,t}}_{l o n g-r u n}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThis decomposition relies on a firm having a long-run, target, market-to-book ratio that equals that of its industry. This ratio is determined by a parsimonious set of valuation multiples: book value, leverage, and net income.8 The firm's market-to-book ratio is comprised of a long-run market-to-book value determined from long-run multiples of the three variables used, with a time-varying sector-wide multiple representing sector-wide deviations and a frm-specific multiple accounting for any additional firm-specific deviations. Following Rhodes-Kropf, Robinson, and Viswanathan (2005), these firm-specific deviations capture the degree of overvaluation and misvaluation. We explore the impact of the different types of institutional investor on the firmspecific error component. Positive firm-specific error is our proxy for overvaluation, and the absolute value of the firm-specific error proxies for misvaluation.9  \n\n### 2.3Financial Statement Data  \n\nnegative book asset value, market equity, book equity, capital stock, sales, dividends, debt, and inventory. Such firms have either unreliable Compustat data or are likely to be distressed or severely unprofitable. In addition, we delete observations in which book assets or sales growth over the quarter is greater than 1 or less than -1 and remove firms worth less than \\$5 million in 2000 dollars in book value or market value to remove observations that have abnormally large changes due to acquisitions or small asset bases. Next, we remove outliers defined as firm-quarter observations that are in the first and 99th percentile tails for all relevant variables used in our analysis. Following standard practice in the literature, we remove all firms in the financial and insurance, utilities, and public administration industries as they tend to be heavily regulated.  \n\nMerging institutional investor data to corporate financial data based on a frm's CUSIP and year-quarter gives us a sample of 236,025 firm-quarter observations spanning 11,116 frms. Appendix A details the construction of all variables. Table II provides the summary statistics for our main sample and Table IV presents the correlation matrix. The average (median) frm in our sample has 41.5% (38.4%) institutional ownership, with 4.6% (2.9%) of the frm owned by dedicated institutional investors and $27.3\\%$ (27.3%) owned by transient institutional investors. The correlation between dedicated and institutional ownership is -0.23.10 While there is a wide range of frm overvaluation, the average and median frm in our sample is overvalued (i.e., has positive firm-specific error) according to the RKRV measure.  \n\nIn Table V, we compare key characteristics of frms held by the two types of active institutional investors. We subset the data on the highest half of ownership by each investor type and find that the two active types hold firms with significantly different characteristics. This is consistent with the different investment styles and objectives evident in their different approaches to holding period and concentration. Notable differences in the firms each type chooses to hold signal potential notably different effects on firm valuation, operations, and performance. Specifically, we find that dedicated institutional investors hold larger firms than transient investors do, with average total asset values of \\$1,763.4 and \\$1,434.2 million respectively. Despite this, dedicated investors hold firms with lower market values than those held by transient investors, with average market values of \\$1,632.5 and \\$1,741.9 million respectively. These two observations taken together imply a value preference by dedicated investors relative to transient ones; indeed the log of long-run market-tobook ratio under the RKRV decomposition is significantly lower for firms held by dedicated (0.479) relative to transient institutional investors (0.578). Furthermore, frms held by dedicated investors experience almost no firm-specific overvaluation (0.004) under the RKRV measure whereas firms held by transient investors experience much more (0.140).  \n\nThe t-tests of means also suggest significant differences in information quality for firms held by the two types: dedicated investors prefer less popular firms with the average number of institutional investors in frms they hold at 66.9, relative to the 83.8 in firms held by transient investors. Dedicated investors also hold firms with lower analyst following, 3.3 to 4.9 respectively, as well as a higher principal component of several opacity measures,ll consistent with an informational advantage in selecting less-followed and more opaque firms. Firms held by dedicated investors are also less likely to have a credit rating, further consistent with a preference of dedicated investors in holding firms with less publicly available information.  \n\nDedicated investors also hold firms with significantly different operating characteristics than those held by transient investors: they have higher Z-scores, higher leverage, lower cash fow dispersion, lower realized volatility, lower tai or crash risk for firm cash flowsl risk, $_{12}$ lower average, maximum, and median executive pay, higher quality accruals, higher payout ratios, and higher net leverage changes.  \n\nOverall, these results are strongly indicative of differing investment preferences by the two institutional investor types, motivating our study of the effects of intuitional ownership type on future firm value. The overlap between firms owned by dedicated, transient, long/short horizon, and focused/diversified institutional investors is imperfect but consistent with expectations. Firms owned by an above-median number of dedicated investors also have more long-horizon institutional investors. Firms owned by an above-median number of transient investors also have more shorthorizon institutional investors. The differences observed in Table V also hold when we subsample frms based on the dollar amount held by each institutional ownership type (i.e., value-weighted), rather than by the number of each institutional investor type (i.e., equal-weighted).  \n\n## 3  Institutional Investor Type and Firm Value  \n\nIn this section, we examine the impact of different institutional investors types on overvaluation and misvaluation. We begin with classifying institutional investors as dedicated or transient, following Bushee (1998, 2001). Transient investors are more likely to enter and exit their positions quickly and aggressively, relying on publicly available information and strategies such as technical analysis to choose their investments (Bushee, 2001). In contrast, dedicated investors have more incentive to gather information and build relationships with their investments. Due to the information advantage that dedicated investors have relative to transient investors, we hypothesize that firms with more transient institutional investors will have more future overvaluation and misvaluation while firms with more dedicated institutional investors will have less. Furthermore, if dedicated investors possess an informational advantage an increase in dedicated institutional investors should lead to a decrease in overvaluation and misvaluation, with the opposite effect occurring for increases in transient institutional ownership.  \n\nHypothesis 1. Firms with a higher percentage of dedicated (transient) institutional investors ecperience less (more) overvaluation and misvaluation.  \n\nHypothesis 2. Firms that experience an increase in dedicated (transient) institutional investors experience less (more) overvaluation and misvaluation.  \n\n### 3.1 Baseline and Full Models  \n\nStarting with a baseline model, we estimate the effects of lagged levels of institutional ownership by investor type on overvaluation and misvaluation variables of interest, $Y_{i,t}$ , in the subsequent quarter. We consider two measures: 1) the RKRV firm-specific valuation error, which captures the direction of valuation error with positive error indicating overvaluation, and 2) the absolute value of the RKRV firm-specific error which captures the magnitude of misvaluation regardless of direction of deviation from fundamental value.  \n\n$$\nY_{i,t}=\\alpha+\\beta_{1}p D E D_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{2}p T R A_{i,t-1}+f e_{t}+f e_{j}+\\varepsilon_{i,t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $p D E D$ is the percentage of dedicated institutional owners relative to the total number of institutional owners, and $p T R A$ is the percentage of transient institutional owners relative to the total number of institutional owners. We control for macroeconomic effects with year fixed effects, for seasonality with quarter fixed effects, and for general changes in value with industry fixed effects. Standard errors are double-clustered by firm and year-quarter.  \n\nNext, we decompose the lagged level of ownership by type into the second lag of the level and the first lag of the change:  \n\n$$\nX_{i,t-1}\\equiv X_{i,t-2}+\\Delta X_{i,t-2,t-1}.\n$$  \n\nThis allows us to study the dynamics of the effect of ownership type on overvaluation and misvaluation by examining both changes in ownership as well as levels in ownership, giving us a second version of the baseline model:  \n\n$$\nY_{i,t}=\\alpha+\\beta_{1}p D E D_{i,t-2}+\\beta_{2}\\Delta p D E D_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{3}p T R A_{i,t-2}+\\beta_{4}\\Delta p T R A_{i,t-1}+f e_{t}+f e_{j}+f e_{t}+f e_{t}+f e_{t}+f e_{t}+f e_{t}+f e_{t}+f e_{t}+f e_{t}+f e_{t}+f e_{t}\n$$  \n\nThis decomposition of the lagged level of ownership into the second lag of the level and the first lag of the change has three main advantages. First, it allows us to study the impact of levels as well as changes of ownership type on firm value. Second, it controls for any persistence in institutional ownership through the second lag level, allowing the change in ownership to act as a shock. Third, although imperfect, it serves as a first attempt to address the potential selection bias issue in controlling for the relationship between firm valuation and pre-existing ownership types. We address the potential selection bias more rigorously in Section 4.1 and in the appendix.  \n\nWe further supplement our baseline model by including controls for common firm characteristics and factors relevant to firm value. This provides us with our full model:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{Y_{i,t}=\\alpha+\\beta_{1}p D E D_{i,t-2}+\\beta_{2}\\Delta p D E D_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{3}p T R A_{i,t-2}+\\beta_{4}\\Delta p T R A_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{5}l n T A_{i,t-1}}\\ &{\\mathrm{~~}+\\beta_{6}p I N S T_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{7}I N S T h h i_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{8}Z s c o r e i_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{9}L e v i_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{10}L T C R i_{i,t-1}}\\ &{\\mathrm{~}+\\beta_{11}C F d i s p_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{12}N u m E s t_{i,t-1}+f e_{t}+f e_{j}+\\varepsilon_{i,t},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $l n T A$ is log-transformed total assets of the firm to control for firm size, $p I N S T$ isthe percentage of institutional ownership by all types of institutional investors in the 13F database to control for overall institutional investment, INSThhi is the Herfindahl-Hirschman index of institutional ownership in the firm to control for concentration of institutional ownership, Zscore is the Altman (1968) Z-score measure to control for firm financial health, Lev is the ratio of long-term debt to total assets to control for capital structure, $L T C R$ is an indicator variable for whether the firm has a S&P long-term credit rating to control for financial constraints, CFdisp is the standard deviation of cash fows over the prior 20 quarters divided by the mean of cash fows over the prior 20 quarters to control for cash fow volatility, $^{13}$ and $N u m E s t$ is the number of analysts reporting EPS forecasts for the firm in a given quarter to control for market attention. All control variables are lagged one quarter. In addition, we include year and quarter fixed effects to control for the macroeconomic environment and seasonality, respectively, and SIC3 fixed effects to control for variation across industries. Standard errors are double-clustered by firm and year-quarter.  \n\nTable VI presents the results for the baseline and full models. Columns (1) and (2) report the results using the baseline model in equation (2). We see in Column (1) that frms with higher dedicated institutional ownership experience less overvaluation (-0.767) in the subsequent quarter, while those with higher transient ownership become more overvalued (0.388). That is, for a $100\\%$ increase in dedicated ownership, the logarithm of the firm's value relative to fundamentals drops by 0.767 and for a $100\\%$ increase in transient ownership, the log firm value relative to fundamentals increases by 0.388.14 Both effects are significant at the 1% level. Using the misvaluation measure, Column (2) finds that firms with more dedicated ownership are not significantly misvalued in the subsequent quarter, while those with more transient ownership face significantly higher subsequent misvaluation (0.073). In other words, for every $100\\%$ increase in transient ownership, the logarithm of misvaluation increases by 0.073 relative to firm fundamentals, which is significant at $1\\%$ .These results are consistent with Hypothesis 1, where frms with more dedicated (transient) institutional investors face lower (higher) subsequent overvaluation and misvaluation.  \n\nWhen we decompose lagged institutional ownership into second lagged levels and first lagged changes in equation (3), we see in Column (3) of Table VI that firms become less overvalued with both higher levels as well as larger increases in DED ownership whereas they become more 13We also consider the dispersion of earnings as wellas the dispersion o sales over th same time period, with no difference in the observed results. 14Recallthat Rhodes-Kropf, Robinson, and Viswanathan (2005） decompose the logarithm of the market-to-book ratio.  \n\novervalued with both higher levels and larger increases in TRA ownership, significant at the $1\\%$ level. In fact, overvaluation falls by 0.871 for a 100% increase in $p D E D_{i,t-2}$ , the level of dedicated institutional ownership, consistent with the decrease documented in column (1), and falls further by 0.516 for a $100\\%$ increase in $\\Delta p D E D_{i,t-1}$ , the change in dedicated ownership. Similarly, firm value relative to fundamentals rises by 0.453 for a $100\\%$ increase in $p T R A_{i,t-2}$ , the level of transient institutional ownership, consistent with the increase documented in column (1), and rises further by 0.410 for a $100\\%$ increase in $\\Delta p T R A_{i,t-1}$ , the change in transient ownership. All effects are significant at the 1% level. Column (4) presents the results for misvaluation, finding a weaker but also positive misvaluation effect on $p T R A_{i,t-2}$ , significant at the 10% level.  \n\nFinally, Columns (5) and (6) of Table VI present the results for the full model that includes controls in equation (4). These results confirm the prior findings on the distinct effects of dedicated and transient institutional ownership on both overvaluation and misvaluation in the presence of controls. Specifically, accounting for controls, a 100% increase in the level of dedicated ownership reduces overvaluation by 0.568, and a $100\\%$ increase in the change in dedicated ownership reduces overvaluation by 0.362, both significant at the $1\\%$ level. Similarly to previous findings, a $100\\%$ increase in the level of transient ownership increases overvaluation by 0.150, and a $100\\%$ increase in the change of transient ownership increases it by 0.285 in Column (5). Column (6) shows a significant positive effect on the magnitude of misvaluation for both levels and changes of transient institutional investors. This result is consistent with, and in fact, stronger than, that in column (4). A $100\\%$ increase in the level of transient ownership increases the magnitude of misvaluation by 0.135, and a $100\\%$ increase in the change of transient ownership increases it further by 0.096.  \n\nWe test the robustness of our findings by repeating the analysis in Table VI using an alternative measure of overvaluation and misvaluation based on Hirshleifer and Jiang (2010). Appendix B.1 details the methodology and results. The authors hypothesize that managers who have a private signal that their firm is overvalued (undervalued) will issue (repurchase) equity to take advantage of this inside information. They propose an undervalued-minus-overvalued (UMO) factor as a portfolio that takes long positions in equity repurchasers and shorts equity issuers and finds that this factor is able to identify overvalued and undervalued firms by its explanatory power for the frm's returns. We compute each frm's loading on the UMO factor as an alternative measure of overvaluation, and its absolute magnitude as an alternative measure of misvaluation. As this alternative measure is based on managerial behavior, the HJ measure is derived with respect to a completely distinct set of information than the RKRV measure, which is based on firm fundamental multiples. As such, we can expect the two to serve as robustness checks for one another. Our results for the two measures are mutually, and reassuringly, consistent.  \n\n### 3.2  Channels for Ownership Effects on Firm Value  \n\nHaving observed the differing effects that institutional investor types have on firm-specific overvaluation and misvaluation, we next seek to understand and test several explanations by which these differences may arise.  \n\n#### 3.2.1 Corporate Events  \n\nFirst, one potential reason for the observed differences is due to the occurrence of corporate events in which one type of institutional investor is involved in some capacity, resulting in both increased ownership by that investor type as well as increased (over) valuation. One such corporate event is merger and acquisition activity in which transient institutions may either engage in event-specific trading strategies or in advisory roles. To examine whether mergers and acquisitions drive the relationship between investor type and misvaluation, we obtain and include mergers and acquisition information from the Thomson Reuters SDC M&A database. We repeat our full model analysis in equation (4) using three alternative subsamples: 1) excluding firms that have participated in M&A (as either the acquirer or target) in the current quarter, 2) excluding frms that have participated in M&A in the quarter before, during, and after the current, and 3) excluding firms that have ever participated in M&A in its entire available history. In all cases, our results are highly similar to the main findings in Table VI, suggesting that investor involvement or infuence in M&A is not the main driver of investor type on misvaluation.  \n\nAnother such corporate event is equity offerings. It may be the case that transient investors, many of whom are large investment banks, may act in advisory roles, inflating both the valuation of the firm as well as transient ownership. To consider the effect of equity offerings, we obtain and include seasoned equity offering information from the Thomson Reuters SDC Global Issuances database. Similarly to the treatment of M&A, we consider three alternative subsamples: 1) excluding frms that have issued an equity offering in the current quarter, 2) excluding firms that have issued equity in the quarter before, during, and after the current, and 3) excluding firms that have ever participated in a seasoned equity offering in its entire available history. Again, in all cases, our results are highly similar to the main findings. Altogether, these results suggest that corporate events are not the main driver of the observed effect of institutional ownership type on firm value. These results are suppressed for brevity.  \n\n#### 3.2.2 Momentum  \n\nA second potential explanation for the observed differences between different institutional investor types could be that, given the high portfolio turnover and short investment horizon characteristics of transient investors, these investors may be momentum return chasers. A momentum trend could jointly cause an increase in both current transient ownership and future firm-specific RKRV overvaluation and misvaluation.15  We create a Momentum Returns measure calculated as the cumulative return over the prior 12 to seven months following Novy-Marx (2012) to control for this potential confounding effect.16 Novy-Marx (2012) shows that intermediate-term past returns serve better in predicting future returns than recent past performance. Using intermediate-term past returns has the additional advantage of basing momentum on a period prior to our lagged institutional investor level and change measures.  \n\nColumns (1) and (2) of Table VII include the Momentum Returns variable to control for momentum trends in firm value. The coefficients on both dedicated and transient institutional ownership types, their significances, and the $R^{2}$ 's are highly similar to those observed in our main findings in Table VI. This rules out momentum chasing as the driving explanatory mechanism for the observed overvaluation effect of transient institutional investors. As expected, Momentum Returns, itself, increases firm overvaluation significant at the $1\\%$ level as firms experiencing upward momentum in the past intermediate-term will on average continue to exceed their firm-specific fundamental value.  \n\n#### 3.2.3 Firm Opacity  \n\nThird, we examine the possibility that the observed differences between dedicated versus transient investors on overvaluation and misvaluation is due to different investor incentives in gathering information. As such, we would expect any information advantages that dedicated investors use in correcting valuation errors to be stronger for more opaque firms, and transient-induced mispricing to be higher. We measure Firm Opacity as the principal component of known opacity proxies following the approach of Karpoff, Lee, and Masulis (2013) to control for information asymmetry. These opacity proxies include log of firm age, log of firm size, and average bid-ask spread, standard deviation of returns, Amihud ratio, and skewness of the Fama-French 3-factor model residuals over the prior year.17 Since this principal component includes the Amihud ratio and bid-ask spread, this effectively controls for firm liquidity as well.18  \n\nColumns (3) and (4) of Table VII include the Firm Opacity measure as an additional control for availability of information. This appears to strengthen our results from Columns (5) and (6) of Table VI with higher magnitude coefficients on the levels of and changes in dedicated ownership for firm overvaluation and levels of and changes in transient ownership for firm misvaluation and the $R^{2}$ 's are the highest among all specifications we consider. Firm Opacity itself lowers overvaluation and increases misvaluation. This is consistent with information asymmetries playing a role in the effect of institutional investor types on firm valuation, particularly that of dedicated institutional investors with a superior information advantage. We revisit the role of information gathering on the observed results in more detail in Section 4.  \n\n#### 3.2.4  Perceived Growth Opportunities  \n\nFinally, it may also be the case that dedicated and transient institutional investors have distinct perceptions regarding the growth and future value of firms, driving the observed differences in results. Specifically, higher perceived growth opportunities may drive both transient ownership and increased firm overvaluation and misvaluation. To address this concern, we rely on the frm's investment in innovation as a proxy for perceived growth opportunities. We measure R&D Intensity, defined as annual research and development expenses as a ratio to annual sales revenue, to capture the degree to which a firm invests in innovation and growth. A frm with more R&D investment is harder to value correctly given the long-term nature of the investment and is more likely to generate diverging perceptions of growth.19 As such, R&D Intensity proxies for perceived future growth opportunities.  \n\nColumns (5) and (6) of Table VII include R&D Intensity as a control for perceived growth opportunities. The results for the effect of institutional ownership type on frm-specific overvaluation and misvaluation are unchanged - dedicated (transient) institutional investors leads to significantly lower (higher) overvaluation in the next quarter and transient institutional investors lead to significantly higher misvaluation in the next quarter.  \n\n### 3.3  Sector-wide Misvaluation and Long-run Value  \n\nIn the previous section, we study the relationship between institutional investor types and frmspecific overvaluation and misvaluation, including using a firm-specific proxy for differences in perceived growth opportunities. To further explore whether frm-specific characteristics such as perceived growth opportunities drive the observed diferences between investor types and firm valuation, we examine the effect of institutional ownership type on sector-wide misvaluation and long-run market-to-book value from the remaining two components of the RKRV decomposition in equation (1). These components eliminate firm-specific cross-sectional differences, including frmspecific perceived growth opportunities, and allows us to examine institutional investor objectives at the sector level as well as in the long-run.  \n\nThe RKRV sector overvaluation is defined by Rhodes-Kropf, Robinson, and Viswanathan (2005) as the difference between the log of firm value derived from current sector multiples and the log of firm value derived from long-run sector multiples. The RKRV long-run market-to-book value is the difference between the log of fundamental value derived from long-run multiples and the log of book value. Similar to the frm-specific misvaluation measure, we create a sector-wide misvaluation measure as the absolute value of the sector-wide overvaluation measure.  \n\nTable VIII presents the results. Columns (1) through (3) present the baseline results following equation (3) for the sector overvaluation and sector misvaluation measures, as well as the firm's long-run market-to-book value. Column (1) shows that the lagged level of transient ownership increases subsequent sector-wide overvaluation by 0.038 while an increase in transient ownership increases it by 0.053 both significant at the 5% level without controls. Column (2) finds that the lagged level of transient ownership reduces sector-wide misvaluation by 0.032 significant at the $1\\%$ level. The results suggest that while transient ownership increases future sector-wide overvaluation, the magnitude of the overvaluation (i.e., misvaluation) falls in the future. Column (3) finds that both higher levels of dedicated and transient ownership lead to higher long-run market-to-book value, significant at the $1\\%$ level, with a similar effect for an increase in transient ownership.  \n\nThe inclusion of our controls from equation (4) in Columns (4) through (6) of Table VIII absorbs some of the effects. In Column (4), the level of transient ownership increases sector-wide overvaluation by 0.038 and the change in transient ownership increases it by 0.060, both significant at the 5% level. These results are consistent with those observed in Column (1). However, in Column (5) with the inclusion of control variables, transient investors no longer significantly reduce sector misvaluation. This suggests that the previous result in Column (2), where the lagged level of transient investors reduces sector misvaluation, is due to publicly known firm characteristics (as measured by the controls), rather than any specific infuence by the transient investors. Finally, when we include controls in Column (6), we find that the level of dedicated ownership decreases long-run market to book by 0.107, and the change in dedicated ownership decreases long-run market to book by 0.095. Meanwhile, the level of transient ownership increases long-run market to book by 0.083 and the change increases it by 0.109. In other words, after controlling for frm characteristics, dedicated institutional investors appear to have a value preference while transient institutional  \n\ninvestors do not.20  \n\n## 4 The Role of Information in Institutional Valuation  \n\nIn the preceding section we have identified the differential effects of institutional ownership types on firm value and have tested their robustness against alternative explanations. We found that Firm Opacity strengthens our findings, and now seek to further test the information channel.  \n\nIn October 2000 the SEC implemented a selective disclosure and insider trading rule, informally known as Regulation FD, which prohibited selective disclosure of information to institutions and required all material disclosures to be public. As a result, this regulation effectively serves as an exogenous shock to the information advantage previously enjoyed by some well-connected institutions, improving market efficiency (Hefin, Subramanyam, Zhang, 2003), reducing fow of private information to analysts (Francis, Nanda, and Wang, 2006) and reducing informed trading in firms with blockholders and analyst access (Anderson, Reeb, Zhang, and Zhao, 2013). We take advantage of this exogenous shock to examine the importance of dedicated and transient ownership for firm overvaluation and misvaluation. Specifically, we hypothesize that by reducing the information advantage to well-connected dedicated institutions, this regulation will result in lower misvaluation for transient institutional owners that do not possess these connections to the same degree that dedicated intuitional owners do.21  \n\n### 4.1 Exogenous Shock to Institutions’ Information Asymmetry  \n\nThe implementation of Regulation FD (RegFD) allows for a difference-in-difference framework. We identify three potential treatment and control groups designated by three indicator variables, isDED,isTRA, and $T v D$ . The first set is comprised of firms with above-median dedicated institutional ownership at the end of 1999, for which the respective control group is all frms with below-median dedicated ownership. The second, of those with above-median transient institutional ownership with a corresponding below-median transient ownership control. The third set is drawn from a subsample of firms with only above-median dedicated, or transient, institutional ownership, but not both. The treatment group in this subsample are those with above-median transient ownership and the control group are those with above-median dedicated ownership. We define a post-event indicator, $i s F D$ , that takes the value of one from 2001 through 2005 and 0 from 1995 through 1999. We remove 2000 from the sample to avoid any anticipation or adjustments taken by the firms. We also restrict the sample to observations between 1995 and 2005 to get a balanced sample prior to and following the event.  \n\nWe follow a standard difference-in-differences model by including an interaction term between the treatment indicator and the post-event indicator as the difference-in-difference variable in studying our measures of misvaluation, $Y_{i,t}$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{Y_{i,t}=\\alpha+\\beta_{1}i s F D_{t}+\\beta_{2}i s T y p e_{i}+\\beta_{3}i s F D_{t}\\times i s T y p e_{i}+\\beta_{4}p D E D_{i,t-2}}\\ &{\\quad+\\beta_{5}\\Delta p D E D_{i,t-2,t-1}+\\beta_{6}p T R A_{i,t-2}+\\beta_{7}\\Delta p T R A_{i,t-2,t-1}+\\beta_{8}l n T A_{i,t-1}}\\ &{\\quad+\\beta_{9}p I N S T_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{10}H H I.I N S T_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{11}Z s c o r e_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{12}L e v_{i,t-1}}\\ &{\\quad+\\beta_{13}L T C R_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{14}C F d i s p_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{15}N u m E s t_{i,t-1}+f e_{t}+f e_{j}+\\varepsilon_{i,t}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $i s F D$ is the indicator variable for the implementation of Regulation FD after 2000Q4 and captures effects that would occur in firms regardless of treatment effect, isType is the indicator variable for whether the firm has an above-median level of institutional ownership by type (i.e., isDED, isT RA, and $T v D$ ) as of 1999Q4 and captures possible differences between treatment and control groups in the absence of a policy change, and $i s F D\\times i s T y p e$ is the difference-in-difference variable of interest that captures the effect of the policy on the treatment group net of control.  \n\nOne potential complication is changes in treatment/control classification over the estimation period of 1995 through 2005. We control for this by benchmarking the treatment and control classifications to 1999Q4. In other words, a firm is classified based on their institutional ownership at 1999Q4, regardless of how their ownership changes. Additionally, we include the firm's level and change in dedicated and transient institutional ownership to account for any actual changes in institutional ownership that may occur. The coefficients $\\beta_{4}$ through $\\beta_{7}$ absorb effects due to a firm's potential change in in ownership composition after the 1999 classification. We also control for firm characteristics as discussed in Section 3.1. Finally, we control for macroeconomic effects and seasonality with year and quarter fixed effects respectively and for industry trends with SIC3 fixed effects. Standard errors are double clustered by firm and year-quarter.  \n\nPanel A of Table IX presents the results of our difference-in-difference model in equation (5) for the RKRV overvaluation and misvaluation measures. Columns (1) and (2) report findings for the effect of Regulation FD on the valuation of firms held by dedicated institutional investors. As we expect, there is no significant effect on the interaction term between the implementation of RegFD and above-median pre-implementation ownership by the dedicated institutional type both for overvaluation and for misvaluation. This implies that the introduction of RegFD did not change the information available to the better-informed dedicated investors relative to the rest of the market.  \n\nHowever, when we consider the effects of Regulation FD on the valuation of firms with abovemedian pre-implementation ownership by transient institutional investors, we find significant results (at the 5% level) for the expected direction of RKRV overvaluation in Column (3). That is, by mandating public disclosure of material information - thereby reducing the information asymmetry between the less-informed transient and more-informed dedicated institutional investors - RegFD increases the transient investors′ information set and reduces their overvaluation after the regulation is implemented. There is no significant effect of transient institutional investor ownership on the magnitude of misvaluation reported in Column (4).  \n\nColumns (5) and (6) of Table IX compare the valuation effects of above-median transient institutional ownership to that of above-median dedicated ownership in 1999Q4, $T v D$ ,around the RegFD policy change. The treatment group is comprised of only the isTRA frms and the control group is comprised of only the $i s D E D$ frms. This smaller subsample reduces our number of observations to 39,899 firm-quarters. However, this approach allows us to more cleanly address the potential information advantage enjoyed by dedicated institutional investors by directly comparing them to transient ones. Column (5) shows the effect of the policy change on overvaluation, and finds that overvaluation decreases for $T v D$ , which is to say it falls for transient-owned firms relative to dedicated-owned ones. This effect is significant at the 10% level. Furthermore, Column (6)  \n\nshows that the magnitude of misvaluation falls much more strongly for transient-owned relative to dedicated-owned firms, significant at the 1% level.  \n\nThese results suggest that following Regulation FD and the easier availability of information, the overvaluation and misvaluation observed previously with transient investors are mitigated. In Panel B of Table IX, we check the robustness of the above difference-in-difference results around the RegFD event with a placebo test. Specifically, we pick a counterfactual year for the exogenous shock event and repeat the difference-in-differences analysis to test whether the effect we observed around 2000, the implementation of RegFD, is spurious. We select 1995 as the counterfactual year and conduct the analysis over three-year pre- and post-event windows to minimize overlap with the timeframe considered in the main analysis in Panel A.  \n\nThe counterfactual analysis in Panel B of Table IX shows only a weakly significant negative effect on the direction of RKRV misvaluation for firms with above-median transient ownership in Column (3). More notably, there is no effect in Columns (5) and (6) on the change in direction and magnitude of RKRV misvaluation on firms held by transient versus dedicated institutions. This absence of an effect in a counterfactual year supports the validity of our analysis in Panel A and suggests that information availability plays a large role in observed misvaluation effects by the different institutional investor types.  \n\nThere are two potential explanations for our results thus far: either institutional investor types cause distinct value effects on the firms they own in the subsequent quarter, or they simply choose to own firms that are distinctly different to begin with (i.e., selection bias) and these differences persist. While our analysis is predictive and uses both lagged levels and changes of explanatory variables, we seek to further distinguish between these two potential explanations. To do this, we use the Mahalanobis (1936) distance measure to match each firm prior to the enactment of Regulation FD in 2000 that has above-median dedicated or transient ownership with a contemporaneous control frm that does not, but is similarly misvalued both at the frm and sector levels and has a similar size and book-to-market ratio. We create an alternative set of matches using propensity score matching. We discuss the matching process quality and results in Appendix B.2. The matched-firm tests around Regulation FD in the appendix show that these overvaluation and misvaluation effects are not merely due to institutional self-selection into frms. The overvaluation and misvaluation of firms owned by transient institutions falls relative to that of matched control firms around the implementation of the regulation in the difference-in-difference analysis, and this decrease is significantly greater than that for firms owned by dedicated institutions in the difference-indifference-in-difference.  \n\nOverall the findings around the Regulation FD exogenous shock to the informational advantage of dedicated institutional investors point to both future overvaluation and future misvaluation falling for firms owned by transient institutions. This is to be expected as the SEC regulation puts transient investors on a more even footing with their better-informed dedicated counterparts. These results also support the interpretation of asymmetric information as one channel for the observed differences between firms owned by dedicated and transient investors. Furthermore, matched-firm analysis rules out self-selection by institutions into misvalued firms as the explanation.  \n\n### 4.2  Individual Characteristics of Institutional Investor Types  \n\nHaving established that dedicated and transient institutional investors have different impacts on firm overvaluation and misvaluation, we examine the individual investor characteristics that form the dedicated and transient classifications, specifically investor portfolio turnover and holdings concentration. By considering the individual portfolio characteristics separately, we test whether the information advantage enjoyed by dedicated institutions documented in Section 4 is primarily due to their concentration or duration of ownership. To do this, we classify institutions based on the individual characteristics of portfolio turnover and concentration of ownership.  \n\nFollowing Yan and Zhang (2009), we measure the portfolio turnover of each institutional investor based on the prior four quarters. In each quarter, we calculate the aggregate purchase and sale of each institutional investor based on the changes in portfolio value of purchases and sales between the current and previous quarter:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{A g\\_b u y s_{k,t}=\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in N_{k}}\\left\\lvert S_{k,i,t}P_{i,t}-S_{k,i,t-1}P_{i,t-1}-S_{k,i,t-1}\\Delta P_{i,t}\\right\\rvert,w h e r e S_{i,t}>S_{i,t-1}}\\ &{}\\ &{A g_{-}s e l l s_{k,t}=\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in N_{k}}\\left\\lvert S_{k,i,t}P_{i,t}-S_{k,i,t-1}P_{i,t-1}-S_{k,i,t-1}\\Delta P_{i,t}\\right\\rvert,w h e r e S_{i,t}\\leq S_{i,t-1}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $S_{k,i,t}$ is the number of shares held by investor $k$ in firm $i$ in quarter $t$ and $P_{i,t}$ is the share price  \n\nOof firm $i$ inquarter $t$ . We then take the minimum between the aggregate purchase and aggregate sale in each quarter and divide by the average portfolio value between the current and previous quarter, providing us with a churn rate for each institution in each quarter:  \n\n$$\nC R_{k,t}=\\frac{\\operatorname*{min}(A g_{-}b u y s_{k,t},A g_{-}s e l l s_{k,t})}{\\sum_{i\\in N_{k}}\\frac{S_{k,i,t}P_{i,t}+S_{k,i,t-1}P_{i,t-1}}{2}}\n$$  \n\nWe take the average churn rate over the past four quarters as our measure for portfolio turnover.  \n\nSimilarly, following Bushee (1998, 2001), we measure holdings concentration of each institutional investor. We start with the institutional holding of each frm in the portfolio, that is the number of shares held in a firm that institutional investor as a ratio over the shares outstanding for the firm:  \n\n$$\nI O H o l d_{k,i,t}=\\frac{S_{k,i,t}}{S_{i,t}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $S_{k,i,t}$ is the number of shares held by investor $k$ in firm $i$ in quarter $t$ and $S_{i,t}$ is the number of shares outstanding for firm $i$ in quarter $t$ . To calculate holdings concentration, we take the average of the squared institutional holding over the institutional investor's portfolio of firms:22  \n\n$$\nI O C o n c_{k,t}=\\frac{1}{N_{k}}\\sum_{i\\in N_{k}}I O H o l d_{k,i,t}^{2}.\n$$  \n\nThis measure has the interpretation that if the investor tends to be a blockholder in the firms of their portfolio, then on average they take concentrated positions in their holdings.  \n\nHypothesis 3. Firms with a higher percentage of long-horizon or focused (short-horizon or diversified) institutional investors experience less (more) overvaluation and misvaluation.  \n\nHypothesis 4. Firms that experience an increase in long-horizon or focused (short-horizon or diversified) institutional investors ecperience less (more) overvaluation and misvaluation.  \n\nWe form terciles based on portfolio turnover in each quarter, and select the top turnover tercile as the “short-horizon\" institutional type, and the bottom tercile as the “long-horizon\". Similarly, we form terciles based on holdings concentration in each quarter and take the top tercile as the 22For robustne, w also take the su of the squardititutionalhlings andal rsultshl.  \n\n\"focused\" institutional type, and the bottom as the “\"diversified\". For each frm in our sample, we then compute the percentage held by each of these institutional investor types. We also identify the joint percentage held by institutions in specific terciles of both portfolio turnover and concentration. That is, we estimate the percentage of the firm owned by long-horizon and focused institutional investors as that held by institutions that are both in the lowest portfolio turnover tercile and the highest concentration tercile. We create analogous ownership percentages for the three other possible combinations of institutional investor types based on portfolio turnover and holdings concentration.  \n\nFinally, as before, we decompose the lagged level of each single-dimensional institutional ownership type (long/short horizon, focused/diversified portfolio) into a second lag of the level and frst lag of the change in the ownership by a given institutional investor type. While correlation between these fundamental types is approximately 40% (see Table IV), the results are not driven by multicollinearity as they are robust to the inclusion of only one type at a time. These results are suppressed for brevity.  \n\nTable X presents the effects of these fundamental institutional ownership types on RKRV overvaluation and misvaluation in the full sample, as well as the pre- and post- RegFD subsamples. Panel A presents the full-sample results for next quarter's firm-specific RKRV overvaluation and the absolute magnitude of misvaluation. Column (1) of Panel A shows that overall the lagged level and change in long-horizon institutional ownership surprisingly results in higher subsequent overvaluation significant at the 1% and $10\\%$ levels respectively, but notably so does lagged change in short-horizon institutional ownership, also significant at the $1\\%$ level. There is no ownership effect on the absolute magnitude of misvaluation in Column (2) for long-horizon ownership but both the lagged level and change in short-horizon institutional ownership increases the magnitude of misvaluation significant at the 5% level in both cases.  \n\nColumns (3) and (4) of Panel A present analogous full-sample findings for the focused and diversified institutional types. Consistent with expectations, we find that lagged levels and changes in focused institutional ownership decrease overvaluation, significant at the $10\\%$ and $1\\%$ levels respectively. Also consistent with prior results, lagged levels and changes in diversified ownership increase overvaluation with 1% level of significance for both. However, in Column (4) we find that it is only the diversified institutional types that reduce the magnitude of frm misvaluation, with both the level and change effects significant at the 5% and $10\\%$ levels respectively.  \n\nColumns (5) and (6) consider the joint effects of institutional portfolio turnover and concentration. Notice that long-horizon and focused investors are more likely to be dedicated whereas short-horizon and diversified investors are more likely to be transient investors. We find that the effect of focused institutional ownership reduces subsequent overvaluation in Column (5) regardless of its joint pairing with long- or short-horizon ownership. Similarly, diversified ownership increases subsequent overvaluation regardless of pairing with horizon types. Consistent with Column (4), we find in Column (6) that diversified ownership reduces the magnitude of misvaluation regardless of any joint effects with institutional investment horizon. This result is surprising given that we previously found that TRA investors, those most likely to be short and diversified, increase the magnitude of misvaluation.  \n\nGiven the information advantage for TRA investors with the enactment of Regulation FD, we split our full sample into pre- and post- RegFD to test whether the disclosure requirement had an effect on the fundamental institutional ownership types. Panel B presents results for the pre-RegFD (pre-2000) subsample and Panel C presents results for the post-RegFD (post-2000) subsample. The results along the horizon dimension are similar to that of the full sample (see Columns (1) and (2). However, when we turn our attention to focused and diversifed investors, we see that prior to the enactment of Regulation FD, ownership by diversified investors in Columns (3) and (4) as well as that by short-horizon diversified investors in Columns (5) and (6) increases the magnitude of misvaluation. It is only in the post-RegFD period that this reverses in Panel C. These results suggest that the concentration of institutional ownership is primarily responsible for the information advantage enjoyed by DED investors and reinforce the idea that Regulation FD provided TRA institutions with the information that previously fowed only to DED investors. This importance of blockholder status in obtaining private information prior to the implementation of RegFD is consistent with the fndings of Anderson, Reeb, Zhang, and Zhao (2013).  \n\nOverall these findings present mixed evidence for Hypotheses 3 and 4, due to the regime change in the distribution of information after RegFD. To a large degree, the effects of long-horizon and focused ownership appear to occur prior to the implementation of the SEC regulation. The effects of diversified institutional ownership in reducing misvaluation only appear after its passage.  \n\n## 5 Institutional Investor Types, Governance, and Performance  \n\nIn the preceding sections we consider a puzzle in the literature regarding the effect of institutional investors on frm value. Several papers document the ability of institutional investors to acquire information, improve governance, and make markets more effcient (Lakonishok, Shleifer, Vishny, 1992; Nesbitt, 1994; Sias and Starks, 1997; Nagel, 2005; Barber and Odean, 2008) while other research finds results suggestive of opportunism without long-term benefit, and with potentially destabilizing value effects (Gillian, 1995; Karpoff, Malatesta, and Walkling, 1996; Smith, 1996; Wermers, 1999; Barton and Wiseman, 2014). The differential effect on firm value by institutional investor type that we document provides a view towards reconciling this tension in the literature. Institutional investors are indeed not all the same: some reduce overvaluation and misvaluation, while others stoke it.  \n\nExamining diferent institutional investor types can also help refine prior findings regarding the role of institutions and blockholders on corporate governance and long-term firm performance. Some studies have shown that institutional investors improve governance (Gillan and Starks, 2000; Hartzell and Starks, 2003), while others find no effect (Agarwal and Knoeber, 1996; Karpoff, Malatesta, and Walkling, 1996). Recent work in asset pricing research also demonstrates that holding period matters for performance studies (Kamara, Korajcyk, Lou, Sadka, 2016; Chaudhuri and Lo, 2016). In this section, we examine some common frm governance and performance measures to gain additional insight on the roles that different institutional investor types play.  \n\nTable XI Panel A reports findings about the effect of institutional investor type on key characteristics related to firm performance and risk as well as corporate governance. We find that firms held by dedicated institutions have lower realized volatility and lower average, median, and maximum executive compensation. Firms held by transient institutions have higher tail risk, as proxied by the $I V s p r e a d_{m o n}$ implied volatility spread between out-of-the-money and in-themoney puts, higher realized volatility, higher executive pay, lower payout ratios, and lower leverage increases than those in firms held by dedicated institutions.23  \n\n23Borochin and Yang (2016)fnd that change in the implied volatility spread across option moneyness predits  \n\nWhile the information advantage enjoyed by dedicated institutional investors prior to the implementation of RegFD clearly plays a role in their effects on firm overvaluation and misvaluation, it is not obvious that the firm characteristics considered in Table XI should be impacted due to having private information. We test this by subsampling into pre- and post- RegFD subsamples in Panels B and C respectively, and find that the effects of dedicated and transient ownership on the firm characteristics related to good governance are largely consistent through time. The only notable exception to this is the payout ratio whose negative coefficients become similar in magnitude post-2000. Overall, these results suggest that some, but not all, institutional investors provide governance benefits, consistent with Chen, Harford, and Li (2007).  \n\nIn Table XII, we again deompose investors along investor horizon and portfolio concentration and consider the joint pairings between the two portfolio characteristics. We find that long-horizon ownership levels and changes are associated with lower historical volatility, higher payout ratios, and net leverage increases, largely invariant to the dimension of the concentration of ownership. At the same time, short-horizon ownership is associated with higher tail risk, higher executive compensation, and lower payout ratios, also largely invariant to portfolio concentration. Some, but not all, institutional investors do provide governance benefits consistent with Chen, Harford and Li (2007).  \n\nTherefore, while the effects of dedicated and transient ownership on firm overvaluation and misvaluation are shown to be largely due to the holdings concentration dimension in Table X, the corporate governance effects of these institutional investor types appear largely due to the portfolio turnover dimension as shown in Table XII. The changes in over- and misvaluation effects found for dedicated and transient ownership around the implementation of RegFD, coupled with their strong relation to the holdings concentration dimension, suggest that the concentration dimension in particular was sensitive to the information effect from RegFD. The largely time-invariant firm characteristics in Table XI, coupled with their strong relation to the portfolio turnover dimension, suggest that institutional variation on investment horizon was not as big a driver of informational asymmetries addressed by RegFD.  \n\nNext, we test the economic significance of institutional ownership types by considering the raw everage increase and is a signifcant signal of frm quality and is related to other quality firm characteristics.  \n\nand risk-adjusted performance of firms held by each institutional type over the following year. This analysis captures the long-term effects of institutional ownership type on the firm and is particularly relevant to other market participants investing alongside these institutions. In calculating riskadjusted returns, we benchmark to the Pastor and Stambaugh (2003) 5-factor model. Table XIII reports the raw performance over each of the next four quarters in Columns (1) through (4) and the 5-factor abnormal performance in Columns (5) through (8).  \n\nWe find that firms held by transient institutions have insignificant or negative raw returns over the next four quarters. Conversely, frms held by dedicated institutions have positive raw returns over the same period. The results become more compelling when we consider abnormal, rather than raw, performance. Transient institutional ownership results in highly significant and positive abnormal returns in the first quarter, consistent with the previously documented myopic objectives of transient institutions (Bushee, 1998, 2001). However, these firms have no abnormal performance in any subsequent period considered. On the other hand, firms held by dedicated institutions have significant abnormal performance in the second and third quarters, consistent with their long-term value objectives. Market participants may therefore be able to observe the type of institutional ownership and use it as a guide for the horizon of expected future performance.  \n\nFinally, we follow the monthly raw and risk-adjusted returns of firms over the next year in Figures 2 and 3. Figure 2 tracks the monthly returns and abnormal returns for firms with dedicated and transient institutional investors in Panels A and B, respectively. Consistent with the analysis in Table XIII, firms with more dedicated institutional investors realize raw returns of 17.7% over the following year, whereas firms with more transient institutional investors realize raw returns Of $14.7\\%$ . That is, firms with more dedicated investors achieve 3.0% higher returns than those with more transient investors. However, when we turn to risk-adjusted or abnormal returns, frms with more dedicated (transient) institutional investors earn returns of $4.1\\%$ (3.8%), resulting in a difference of $0.3\\%$  \n\nFigure 3 repeats the previous figure by separating institutional investors based on portfolio turnover and holdings concentration. Panels A and B of Figure 3 present the raw and riskadjusted returns for frms with more long-horizon or short-horizon institutional investors. Panels C and D present the raw and risk-adjusted returns for firms with more focused or diversified institutional investors. We see that frms with more long-horizon institutional investors realize raw (abnormal) returns of 19.3% (5.7 $\\%$ ) over the following year, whereas firms with more short-horizon institutional investors realize raw (abnormal) returns of 13.3% (2.9%) over the next year. This leaves firms with more long-horizon institutional investors with raw (abnormal) returns that are 6.0% (2.8%) higher than firms with more short-horizon investors. In contrast, firms with more focused institutional investors realize raw (abnormal) returns of $15.2\\%$ (2.7 $\\%$ )while firms with more diversified institutional investors realize raw (abnormal） returns of $16.1\\%$ (4.9%) over the next year. This results in firms with more focused institutional investors earning raw (abnormal) returns 0.9% (2.1%) lower than firms with more diversified institutional investors. The net negative effect of focused investors is offset by the net positive effect of long-horizon investors, resulting in the 0.3% abnormal returns observed for dedicated investors in Figure 2.  \n\nThese figures support the earlier finding that the higher firm performance observed with dedicated institutional investors, which are defined by Bushee (1998) as focused, long-term investors, is driven by lower portfolio turnover rather than by higher holdings concentration. Furthermore, this superior long-horizon performance more broadly suggests that long-horizon investors are able to accomplish their investment objectives. In addition to providing insight about the causes of dedicated investor performance, these results have wider implications regarding the existence of portfolio manager ability. While we are able to demonstrate the ability of long-horizon managers to achieve long-horizon returns, our data may not be captured at a sufficiently high enough frequency to address the ability of short-horizon managers to achieve short-horizon returns. At any rate, we do not find any superior short-term performance by frms they hold in our sample.  \n\n## 6 Conclusion  \n\nInstitutional ownership can have starkly different effects on firm valuation, depending on the type and objectives of the institutional investor. Dedicated institutional investor ownership reduces future misvaluation, while transient institutional investor ownership increases it. Using the Bushee (1998, 2001) classification of institutional investor types, we show these effects on the direction and magnitude of the firm-specific valuation error relative to fundamentals from Rhodes-Kropf, Robinson, and Viswanathan (2005). Specifically, dedicated institutional ownership is correlated with lower future frm-specific misvaluation and long-run valuation multiples, whereas transient institutional ownership has the opposite relationship. We find similar effects for the absolute magnitude of misvaluation, with dedicated institutional ownership reducing the magnitude of frmspecific misvaluation and transient institutional ownership increasing it.  \n\nFurthermore, decomposing the level of institution ownership by type into the prior period's level and the change with respect to the current period, we find that changes in ownership type have the same effect as the level. This suggests that the effects of institutional ownership types become stronger as the degree of institutional ownership of that particular type becomes more pronounced. These results persist and become stronger in the presence of measures of information quality, suggesting a connection between ownership type and the ability to access firm-specific information. These results are robust to the inclusion of control variables, the use of alternative misvaluation measure, and the examination of alternative explanations.  \n\nWe examine this relationship between firm misvaluation and institutional investor type further using the exogenous shock of the SEC's introduction of Regulation Fair Disclosure (RegFD) in 2000, which requires frms to disclose material information publicly. Prior to this regulation, frms could reveal information to preferred institutional owners, contributing to the informational advantage enjoyed by them. We find evidence consistent with an informational advantage enjoyed by dedicated institutional owners prior to the introduction of RegFD in 2000. The policy change reduces both future overvaluation and misvaluation experienced by firms with transient institutional owners.  \n\nWe also consider more fundamental institutional investor types along the dimensions of portfolio turnover and portfolio concentration. We find that ownership by focused institutions is largely related to lower overvaluation and misvaluation, with the opposite being true for ownership by diversified institutions. That is, of the two portfolio characteristics underlying the transient and dedicated investor types, portfolio concentration drives more of the observed relationship between type and future overvaluation and misvaluation.  \n\nFinally, we demonstrate that institutional ownership types have effects on key firm characteristics that are related to corporate governance. Dedicated (transient) institutions hold frms with less (more) tail risk, historical volatility, and mean, median, and maximum executive compensation. Additionally, dedicated institutions hold firms with less earnings management, higher payouts, and higher leverage increases. We find that these characteristics are stable over time and not sensitive to the information effects from RegFD. Furthermore, we find that they are largely due to the portfolio turnover dimension than the portfolio concentration dimension.  \n\nThese differential institutional ownership effects also have real performance implications for investors. Over the subsequent year, firms held by transient institutions experience abnormal positive performance only in the frst quarter, whereas those held by dedicated institutions have positive abnormal and raw returns in later quarters. This difference in performance appears to be also largely due to the portfolio turnover dimension, as firms held by long-horizon institutions outperform those held by short-horizon ones over subsequent year. This is consistent with the objectives of transient (short-term) and dedicated (long-term) institutions, but has profound implications on the expected effects of institutional ownership for other market participants. This also demonstrates that long-horizon institutional investors are able to achieve superior long-term performance, adding to our understanding of investment manager ability.  \n\nThese results provide a new perspective on the multifaceted nature of institutional investors. We find that there are distinct roles that different types of institutional investors play in setting firm valuations. Institutional types also have distinct effects on corporate governance and future firm performance. Separating institutional ownership by type helps towards resolving standing arguments in the literature about the role of institutional investors in the financial markets.  \n\n## References  \n\nAgrawal, A., and C.

In particular, Section B.1 presents findings using an alternative measure of misvaluation based managerial issuance and repurchase behavior following Hirshleifer and Jiang (2010). Section B.2 presents matched-firm results by misvaluation to rule out self-selection of institutional investor types into misvalued firms.  \n\n### Appendix B.1  Alternative Measure for Misvaluation  \n\nWe test the robustness of our findings by repeating the analysis in Table VI using an alternative measure of overvaluation and misvaluation. Hirshleifer and Jiang (2010) hypothesize that managers who have insider information that their firm is overvalued will issue equity to take advantage of this. Conversely, managers will repurchase equity if they have private information about frm undervaluation. The authors propose an undervalued-minus-overvalued (UMO) factor as a portfolio that takes long positions in equity repurchasers and shorts equity issuers and finds that this factor is able to identify overvalued and undervalued firms by its explanatory power for the firm's returns. We take the negative of the beta on the UMO factor - that is the negative of the coefficient of the firm's exposure to the UMO factor - as our measure of HJ misvaluation to be consistent with the direction of the RKRV misvaluation measure (i.e., in the direction of overvaluation). This HJ measure is based on managerial repurchase and issuance behavior, rather than on fundamental multiples as with the RKRV measure. Since the HJ measure is derived with respect to a completely different set of information than the RKRV measure, we can expect the two to serve as robustness checks for one another.  \n\nTo estimate the HJ measure for misvaluation, we estimate the frm's exposure to Hirshleifer and Jiang's (2010) UMO factor using rolling 60-month regressions:  \n\n$$\nr_{i,t}=\\alpha_{i}+\\beta_{1,i,t}M K T R F_{t}+\\beta_{2,i,t}S M B_{t}+\\beta_{3,i,t}H M L_{t}+\\beta_{4,i,t}U M D_{t}+\\beta_{5,i,t}U M O_{t}+\\varepsilon_{i,t}.\n$$  \n\nA positive coefficient on UMO proxies for undervaluation. However, for consistency with the direction of the RKRV measure, we define the HJ measure of misvaluation as $-\\hat{\\beta}_{5}$ Suchthat it remains positive (negative) in the direction of overvaluation (undervaluation). As with the RKRV measure, we take the absolute value of the HJ measure to proxy for the magnitude of misvaluation.  \n\nTable B.1 displays the results of estimating equations (2), (3), and (4) for the HJ measure of overvaluation and its absolute value proxying for misvaluation. Column (1) fnds results consistent with Column (1) of Table VI, with the lagged level of transient institutional ownership resulting in a positive and significant HJ coefficient, consistent with more overvaluation. Column (2) reports similar results for the absolute value of the factor loading as a proxy for the magnitude of misvaluation.A $100\\%$ increase in the level of transient ownership increases the loading on the overvaluation factor by 0.228 and the magnitude of misvaluation by 0.460. This is consistent with prior findings for the RKRV measure for transient institutional ownership.  There are no statistically significant effects for dedicated institutional ownership, implying that dedicated institutional investor ownership does not significantly increase overvaluation or misvaluation in the subsequent quarter.  \n\nColumns (3) and (4) of Table B.I repeats the decomposition of the lagged level of ownership into the second lag of the level and the first lag of the change in the level of ownership to estimate the dynamic effect of institutional ownership on overvaluation and misvaluation. The positive coeficient on the overvaluation factor loading is consistent with prior findings in Column (3) of Table VI, though only the level of transient ownership has a significant effect. However, both the level and change in transient ownership have the expected positive relationship with the magnitude of misvaluation in Column (4), consistent with the results in Column (4) of Table VI.  \n\nFinally, columns (5) and (6) of Table B.I use the HJ valuation measures in the estimation of the full model with controls, as in equation (4). Column (5) of Table B.I finds the level of transient institutional ownership leading to a subsequent increase in overvaluation significant at the 5% level, consistent with prior results. Column (6) finds stronger results that both the level and change of transient institutional ownership increases the magnitude of misvaluation while the level of dedicated ownership reduces it in the subsequent quarter, all significant at the 1% level.  \n\nWe therefore establish a robust relationship between institutional investor ownership by type, both in levels and changes of ownership, and both overvaluation and misvaluation at the firm level.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Misval.

While our analysis is predictive and uses both lagged levels and changes of explanatory variables, we seek to further distinguish between these two potential explanations.  \n\nTo do this, we use a matching algorithm to find a control firm with a similar prior overvaluation at both the firm and sector levels, but different institutional ownership type for each (treatment) frm held by a particular institutional ownership type around the Regulation FD shock. This is similar to the approach taken by Almeida, Campello, Laranjeira and Wesibenner (2011) and Williamson and Yang (2016). Specifically, we use the Mahalanobis (1936) distance measure to match each firm prior to the enactment of Regulation FD in 2000 that has above-median dedicated or transient ownership with a contemporaneous control firm that does not, but is similarly misvalued both at the firm and sector levels and has similar size and book-to-market ratio. The advantage of using the Mahalanobis distance matching algorithm is that this algorithm ensures a match on each of the matching characteristics, rather than relying on a propensity score.24 As summarized in Table B.lI, the match quality is good: there are no significant differences between the sample and  control frms for above-median  dedicated $(i s D E D$ ),above-median transient (isT RA), or above-median transient and below-median dedicated institutional ownership (isTvD) across the characteristics being matched.  \n\nWe examine differences in next-period misvaluation by ownership type (isDED, isT RA, TuD) before and after the implementation of Regulation FD. Similarly, we also test this difference for Mahalanobis-matched control frms that are similarly overvalued in the current period, but do not have above-median ownership by the same institutional owner type. Next, we test the difference-indifference between the treatment and control firms. This difference-in-difference provides us with a cleaner measure of whether there is a significant misvaluation change around RegFD implementation due to each ownership type. Furthermore, our framework allows us to test the difference in the difference-in-difference for $i s D E D$ against the difference-in-difference for isTRA, essentially providing us with a difference-in-difference-in-difference. This is the difference between firms with above-median dedicated ownership versus above-median transient ownership, taking into account both the time effect (i.e., pre- and post- RegFD) as well as the selection bias (i.e., relative to their matched control firms). This framework is thus robust against the explanation of institutional self-selection for our findings of the effect of ownership type on next quarter's overvaluation and misvaluation.  \n\nTable B.III summarizes the results of this difference analysis of next quarter's firm-specific overvaluation and misvaluation relative to control firms chosen using Mahalanobis distance matching based on contemporaneous RKRV firm- and sector-specific overvaluation, size, and book to market ratio. Panel A presents the results for next quarter's RKRV frm-specific overvaluation measure. We observe that the firms with high dedicated ownership (isDED=1), in Row (a), have no significant overvaluation one year prior to the implementation of RegFD in Column (1), and substantially higher overvaluation one year post in Column (2). The difference between the two, reported at 0.208 in Column (3), is also statistically significant indicative of an increase in overvaluation after the implementation of RegFD. This result may be due either to an increase in market effciency as was the intention of RegFD,25 or to the overall increase in overvaluation in the market. The matched control firms do demonstrate a similar increase in overvaluation between pre- and post- RegFD periods of 0.180 in Column (6). Notably, there are no significant differencein-differences in the changes in overvaluation of firms held by dedicated investors relative to the controls around RegFD in Column (7), suggesting the absence of an informational effect due to Regulation FD on dedicated institutional investors.  \n\nWe next consider the future overvaluation of firms with high transient ownership ( $i s T R A=1$ in Row (b), which are significantly overvalued both pre- and post- RegFD in Columns (1) and (2) respectively. The difference of 0.083 is significant at the 5% level in Column (3). However, we see a much greater increase in overvaluation for the matched control frms in Columns (4) through (6) with a difference in control firm overvaluation around the implementation of RegFD of 0.306 significant at the $1\\%$ level. This larger change in the control firms implies that there is an overall reduction in the overvaluation of frms held by transients around RegFD in the differencein-difference test in Column (7), with a magnitude of -0.223 significant at the 1% level. That is, when controlling for the self-selection of institutional types into firms using firm characteristics and contemporaneous firm- and sector-specific overvaluation, we find that the implementation of RegFD results in transient institutional ownership resulting in significantly less future firm-specific Overvaluation, consistent with Table IX.  \n\nWe further compare the difference-in-difference results in Column (7) for transient and dedicated institutions to obtain a diference-in-difference-in-difference between the two institutional investor types relative to matched controls around the implementation of RegFD in Column (8). We find a coefficient of -0.251 significant at the $1\\%$ level, implying that the decrease in future overvaluation of frms held by transients relative to matched controls, when compared to that of frms held by dedicated institutions relative to controls, itself decreased markedly around the implementation of the RegFD disclosure requirement. In other words, transient institutional ownership results in less overvaluation after RegFD than dedicated ownership, controlling for contemporaneous Overvaluation.  \n\nFinally, we refine the sample to exclude firms that have both above-median dedicated and transient ownership, creating the indicator variable $T v D$ which takes the value of 1 only  when the firm has above-median transient ownership and below-median dedicated ownership and 0 only when the firm has above-median dedicated ownership and below-median transient ownership. This additional restriction removes potential confounding effects of observing the effects of both institutional investor types on the same firm. The results for $T v D$ , in Row (c), in Columns (1) through (7) closely match those of isTRA frms, with overvaluation falling relative to matched control firms after the implementation of RegFD. These findings for the transient-held frms suggest that transient institutional investors experienced an information effect on future overvaluation around the implementation of RegFD.  \n\nPanel B of Table B.IHI considers a similar matched-firm analysis for the next quarter's firmspecific RKRV misvaluation. We find that firms with above-median dedicated ownership in Row (a) do not experience a significant change in the absolute magnitude of misvaluation relative to control firms in the difference-in-difference analysis in Column (7) of Panel B. Firms with above-median transient ownership in Row (b), on the other hand, experience a reduction of 0.175 in the magnitude of misvaluation relative to control frms significant at the 1% level in Column (7). Furthermore, the difference-in-difference-in-difference test in Column (8) also finds a reduction of 0.121 in the absolute magnitude of future firm-specific misvaluation between the transient-held frms and their controls relative to dedicated-held firms and their controls around RegFD. When we exclude firms with both above-median transient and dedicated ownership in the TvD analysis in Row (c) in Panel B, we also observe a 0.164 reduction in the magnitude of misvaluation with a 5% significance level.  \n\nThe matched-firm tests show that these overvaluation and misvaluation effects are not merely due to institutional self-selection into frms based on current valuation since we select control firms using contemporaneous firm- and sector-specific overvaluation. The overvaluation and misvaluation of firms owned by transient institutions falls relative to that of matched control firms around the implementation of the regulation in the difference-in-difference analysis, and this decrease is significantly greater than that for firms owned by dedicated institutions in the difference-indifference-in-difference.  \n\nTable B.1l: Mahalanobis distance matching algorithm. Using Mahalanobis distance matching, the single nearest neighbor is identified as a control firm for each treatment firm. Columns (1), (4), and (7) report the means of matching characteristics for the actual DED, TRA, or TvD frms, respectively. Columns (2), (5), and (8) report the means of matching characteristics for the matched nearest neighbor to the actual DED, TRA, or TvD firms, respectively. Columns (3), (6), and (9) reports the p-values of the t-test of difference in means of matching characteristics for DED, TRA, or TvD matching, respectively. isDED is equal to 1 if the percentage of dedicated institutional investors within a frm falls into the upper tercile and 0 otherwise. isTRA is equal to 1 if the percentage of transient institutional investors within a firm falls into the upper tercile and O otherwise. isTvD contrasts isTRA=1 firms against isDED=1 firms and is equal to 1 if the percentage of transient institutional investors within a firm falls into the upper tercile and the percentage of dedicated institutional investors within a frm falls into the bottom tercile and O if the percentage of transient institutional investors within a firm falls into the bottom tercile and the percentage of dedicated institutional investors within a firm falls into the upper tercile.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"3\">isDED=1</td><td colspan=\"3\">isTRA= 1</td><td colspan=\"3\">isTvD= 1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Actual (1)</td><td>Matched (2)</td><td>p-val (3)</td><td>Actual (4)</td><td>Matched (5)</td><td>p-val (6)</td><td>Actual (7)</td><td>Matched (8)</td><td>p-val (9)</td></tr><tr><td>RKRV (Firm) Overvali,t-1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.062</td><td>0.066</td><td>0.609</td><td>0.155</td><td>0.151</td><td>0.574</td><td>0.177</td><td>0.167</td><td>0.399</td></tr><tr><td>RKRVSector Overvali,t-1</td><td>0.137</td><td>0.138</td><td>0.927</td><td>0.152</td><td>0.150</td><td>0.464</td><td>0.150</td><td>0.147</td><td>0.528</td></tr><tr><td>Log Total Assetsi,t-1</td><td>5.236</td><td>5.217</td><td>0.254</td><td>5.242</td><td>5.230</td><td>0.532</td><td>5.183</td><td>5.184</td><td>0.986</td></tr><tr><td>Book-to-Market Ratioi,t-1</td><td>0.556</td><td>0.551</td><td>0.258</td><td>0.502</td><td>0.504</td><td>0.681</td><td>0.497</td><td>0.499</td><td>0.698</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"14\">TRA-DED Treatment-Control Panel A: RKRV Overvaluation Control Treatment</td><td rowspan=\"8\">Diff-in-diff-in-diff -0.251 *** Diff-in-diff -0.223*** 0.028 (0.047) 1-yr Post-Pre 0.180 *** 0.306 *** (9) (0.034) 1-yr Post-RegFD 0.268 *** 0.474 *** 5 (0.036) 1-yr Pre-RegFD 0.169 *** (4) 0.088 ** (0.037) 1-yr Post-Pre 0.208 *** 0.083 ** (0.033) 1-yr Post-RegFD 0.262 *** 0.312 *** (0.033) 1-yr Pre-RegFD 0.229 *** 0.054 (0.036) (a) Treatment: isDED=1</td><td rowspan=\"8\">(0.075) -0.299 *** (0.049) (0.068) 0.277 *** (0.031) (0.042) 0.444 *** (0.037) (0.053) 0.167 *** (0.037) (0.051) (0.039) -0.022 (0.054) 0.286 *** (0.034) (0.056) *** 808'0 (0.041) (0.062) (b) Treatment: isTRA=1 (c) Treatment: isTvD=1</td><td rowspan=\"8\">Panel B: RKRV Misvaluation</td><td rowspan=\"8\">Diff-in-diff-in-diff TRA-DED 8 Treatment-Control Diff-in-diff 1-yr Post-Pre 1-yr Post-RegFD Control 5 1-yr Pre-RegFD (4) 1-yr Post-Pre 1-yr Post-RegFD 1-yr Pre-RegFD</td><td rowspan=\"8\">(a)Treatment: isDED=1</td><td rowspan=\"8\"></td><td rowspan=\"8\">0.760 *** 0.653 *** (0.022) (0.026)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.121 ** (0.059) -0.175 *** (0.040)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.054 (0.037) 0.121 *** 0.058 ** (0.026) (0.027)</td></tr><tr><td>0.675 *** (0.024)</td></tr><tr><td>0.738 *** (0.024) (0.035) (0.030)</td></tr><tr><td>0.616 *** 0.639 *** 0.629 *** (0.021) (0.022)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.055 * (0.029) -0.055 (0.041)</td></tr><tr><td>0.004 (0.026) 0.629 *** 0.599 *** 0.641 *** (0.020) (0.023) (0.037)</td></tr><tr><td>Treatment 0.625 *** 0.697 *** (0.042) (b) Treatment: isTRA=1 (c) Treatment: isTvD=1</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTable I: List of top ten dedicated and transient institutional investors by average portfolio size.

Dedicated institutional investors, as defined in Bushee (1998, 2001), are characterized as having concentrated holdings in the firms in their portfolios with low turnover. In contrast, transient institutional investors are characterized as having diversified holdings in the firms in their portfolios with high turnover.

Panel A shows the buyand-hold monthly returns for firms with more transient institutional investors than the median firm and firms with more dedicated institutional investors than the median firm. Panel B shows the buy-and-hold abnormal returns based on the Pastor and Stambaugh (2005) 5-factor model.
