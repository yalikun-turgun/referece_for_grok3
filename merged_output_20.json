Using a dataset of online job postings, we confirm that audit offices in more concentrated labor markets have greater labor market power and exercise it in the form of higher skill requirements and greater required effort from their auditors, at similar or slightly lower wages. We then show that client firms of audit offices in more concentrated labor markets are less likely to restate their earnings and have lower absolute discretionary accruals. These findings are only present when employees have lower mobility across professions and geographies, consistent with audit offices’ power in the local labor market explaining the results. Collectively, our findings highlight the importance of labor market power in understanding audit quality.  \n\nJEL: J31, J40, J42, M42, M55  \n\nKeywords: Audit Profession; Labor Market Power; Monopsony and Oligopsony; Wages; Skills; Effort; Audit Quality  \n\n### 1. INTRODUCTION  \n\nThis study investigates the consequences of labor market power in the assurance profession in terms of employment conditions and audit quality. Labor market power is a phenomenon in which reduced competition in the labor market leads to an upward-sloping labor supply curve and gives employers increased bargaining power over their employees, as workers in these markets have limited outside options (Robinson 1969; Boal and Ransom 1997). Labor market power allows companies to require more skills from workers, increase retention, and/or reduce labor costs (Berger, Herkenhoff, and Mongey 2022; Benmelech, Bergman, and Kim 2022). Several academic papers and recent court cases focus on barriers to geographic mobility and document the existence of local labor market power in both lowerand higher-skilled occupations, including academia, and policy makers are increasingly paying attention to the issue (e.g., Staiger, Spetz, and Phibbs 2010; Ashenfelter, Farber, and Ransom  \n\n2010; Falch 2010; Ransom and Sims 2010; Dube, Lester, and Reich 2016; CEA 2016; Delrahim 2019). However, little is known about the influence of labor market power on individual employers? economic outputs. In this paper, we use unique datasets to investigate labor market power in the audit profession and study its effect on audit quality.  \n\nThe audit setting is particularly suitable given that the profession is knowledgeintensive, with human capital being one of its most important assets (Knechel 2010; Lennox and Wu 2018; Aobdia, Srivastava, and Wang 2018; Aobdia 2019a).2 The audit market is also heavily concentrated (e.g., Gerakos and Syverson 2015), and the Big 4 firms hire the bulk of accounting graduates in the U.S. (Moritz 2014; Nieh 2016; Lee, Naiker, and Stewart 2022). Moreover, decreases in migration rates for graduates in the U.S. (e.g., Gottlieb and Joseph 2006; Ishitani 2011; Molloy, Smith, and Wozniak 2011), local recruiting strategies adopted by public accounting firms (Lee et al. 2022), mandated experience requirements in the assurance profession to obtain a CPA license, and interstate barriers to moving resulting from CPA licensing restrictions can make individuals with the skill set to become auditors more dependent on local offices of public accounting firms. Theoretical models of labor market oligopsony suggest that if accounting professionals experience significant costs when transitioning among employers for whom they might work, or audit firms take each other's recruiting strategies as given (e.g., a la Cournot) in their recruiting practices, then labor market power should exist in the audit profession (e.g., Boal and Ransom 1997).  \n\nBuilding on the insight of the labor economics literature that labor market power is characterized by a departure of wages from the marginal product of labor, we expect audit firms to use their labor market power in several non-exclusive ways. First, audit firms with greater labor market power could pay similar wages but recruit more skilled and thus more productive auditors, because these auditors have limited outside options and lower bargaining power. Consistent with this argument, Hershbein, Macaluso, and Yeh (2019) find greater demand for skills in more concentrated labor markets. Second, labor market power can change individual auditors? incentives to exert costly effort. For example, Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984) show that paying employees higher wages relative to outside options raises the cost of job loss for employees, thereby giving them stronger incentives to exert costly effort. The incentive effect stemming from the threat of termination is greater when wages are higher and when the value of outside options is lower (Shapiro and Stiglitz 1984; Katz 1986). Thus, limited outside options associated with higher labor market power can lead to greater effort.? Third, an audit office with greater labor market power could recruit similarly skilled auditors and require unchanged effort from them, but pay them lower wages instead, consistent with the labor economics literature that finds negative associations between labor market concentration and wages (Azar, Marinescu, Steinbaum, and Taska 2020; Benmelech et al. 2022).  \n\nDepending on how audit offices use their labor market power, the effects of such power on audit quality is not clear ex-ante. If audit offices with higher labor market power have higher skill and effort requirements and pay similar or moderately lower wages, we should expect a positive relation between labor market power and audit quality, because auditors who are more skilled and exert greater effort should be more productive. If audit offices with greater labor market power hire similarly skilled auditors and require unchanged effort from them, but pay them lower wages instead, we would expect no relation between labor market power and audit quality. In addition, if audit offices reduce wages too much, auditor skills and effort may even decrease. While this outcome is unlikely, it would result in lower audit quality. Overall, the effect of labor market power on audit quality remains an empirical question.  \n\nTo test our research questions, we follow several studies in the labor economics literature and employ data from Burning Glass Technologies (hereafter BGT) to measure the potential for local labor market power (Hershbein et al. 2019; Azar et al. 2020). BGT data cover the near-universe of audit firms′ online job postings from 2010 to 2017.4 Based on the theoretical predictions in Boal and Ransom (1997) and Hershbein et al. (2019) as well as empirical studies by Azar et al. (2020) and Benmelech et al. (2022), we use the HerfindahlHirschman Index constructed by job postings in the local area as the proxy for labor market power and expect the potential for labor market power to be greater in more concentrated labor markets. The auditor labor market power measure is based on the 134,511 audit-related job positions posted by the top 50 audit firms in the United States from 2010 through 2017. The inter-region correlation of this measure is a low five percent, indicating substantial variation across different regions. Its mean and median are 0.2684 and 0.2552, respectively. According to the guidelines specified by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, a labor market with a Herfindahl index greater than 0.25 is \\*“highly concentrated.\"\" In the empirical analyses, we focus on Big 4 auditors given that they might target different types of graduates relative to smaller audit firms.  \n\nWe next provide evidence on how audit firms use labor market power. As discussed above, an audit firm with labor market power can use a combination of higher skill requirements, higher effort requirements, and lower wages. First, we use skill requirements in online job postings and find positive associations between labor market concentration and the number of skill categories, soft skills, and education requirements in job postings.° Second, while we acknowledge that measuring audit effort is difficult and that our measure is inevitably noisy, we use as proxies for audit effort the number of employees in an audit office divided by the total assets audited or by total audit fees. The underlying concept is that audit firms expect their employees to exercise effort along two dimensions, quantity and quality. While we cannot directly measure the quality of effort, these proxies can capture whether employees conduct greater proportions of audits and thus serve as indicators of the quantity of effort. These proxies can also suggest higher expected quality of effort so long as the expectations for effort quantity and for effort quality are positively correlated.7 We find that labor concentration is negatively related to these two ratios and their natural logarithms, consistent with greater effort requirements for individual auditors when labor concentration is higher, suggesting a potential departure of wages from marginal product of labor. Third, we examine the relation between audit offices? labor market concentration and wages offered on audit positions using wage data from labor condition applications filed with the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). We do not find that labor market concentration is significantly related to wages offered to audit personnel in the cross-section. Untabulated supplemental analyses indicate that it is negatively related to wages offered in the time series, but the effect is modest.8 Overall, our evidence suggests that audit offices in more concentrated labor markets are more interested in recruiting more productive audit personnel and requiring increased effort from them, rather than in reducing their wages by significant amounts. Thus, we expect to find positive associations between labor market power and audit quality, which we study next.  \n\nWe use two commonly accepted proxies for audit quality, restatements and absolute discretionary accruals (e.g., DeFond and Zhang 2014; Aobdia 2019b), and find negative associations between labor market concentration and these measures. The results are robust to a battery of tests and additional controls in the regressions, such as measures of office size, product market competition, and the number of local universities with accounting programs. An increase in audit offices? labor market power from the $25^{\\mathrm{th}}$ to the $75^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile is associated with a decrease of 1.2 percentage points in the probability of restatement. These results are consistent with audit offices with greater labor market power providing higher-quality audits.  \n\nWe conduct several cross-sectional analyses to provide additional evidence that the positive relation between labor market concentration and audit quality is driven by audit offices? labor market power and not by alternative explanations. Specifically, we consider the effect of barriers to mobility across professions and geographies.9 If our results are driven by labor market power, they should be weaker when barriers to mobility are lower and thus employees have a higher value of outside options (e.g., Ransom 1993; Boal and Ransom 1997). Individual auditors can seek employment in audit- or tax-related positions in local public companies, in tax or consulting positions within the local Big 4 audit offices, and in finance positions. Using four different proxies for local substitute employment opportunities from these positions, we find that the positive associations between labor market concentration and audit quality are only present in the subsamples with fewer local substitute employment opportunities. Moreover, as suggested by Kodrzycki (2001) and Gottlieb and Joseph (2006), ge0graphic mobility is likely lower when a local area is more remote, when its quality of life is higher, or when net migration rates to this area are higher. Using these three proxies of geographic mobility, we find that the relations between labor market concentration and audit quality are only present for audit offices in areas with lower geographic mobility. Taken together, these analyses suggest that the effect of labor market power on audit quality is only present when substitute local employment opportunities are limited and when the workforce with the skill set to work in auditing is less geographically mobile.10  \n\nIn supplemental tests, we find that the effect of labor market power on audit quality is present only for audit offices whose labor market share within the local area is above the median, consistent with the idea that audit offices with more desirable characteristics can more easily exercise labor market power. We also find that the effect of labor market power on audit quality is present only in the auditor labor market with experience requirements greater than three years. This result is consistent with increased effort by mid-career auditors having more influence on the overall quality of an audit relative to entry-level auditors and adds to an emerging literature that highlights the importance of mid-career auditors on audit quality (e.g., Kornberger, Justesen, and Mouritsen 2011; Aobdia, Choudhary, and Newberger 2023).11  \n\nOur study extends the literature along several dimensions. We contribute to the literature on labor markets in auditing and respond to the observation by Causholli et al. (2011, 206) that “little research has addressed the structure or dynamics of the labor market in auditing other than to observe that it is somewhat cyclical.? Limited studies in this area include Beck, Francis, and Gunn (2018), who show that audit quality is higher in cities with higher average educational level, Lee et al. (2022), who find a positive association between audit offices\\* proximity to key feeder universities and audit quality, and Barrios (2022), who finds that the 150-hour rule for CPA licensing reduces the number of entrants into the audit profession but does little in improving the overall quality of the auditor labor market. These studies focus on the supply of labor, whereas we focus on the demand for labor and how demand concentration affects auditor employment conditions and audit quality. Focusing on the demand for labor in an auditing context is important, as highlighted in a recent presentation by Martin Schmalz (Chief Economist at the PCAOB) at the 2024 Auditing Section Midyear Meeting. Schmalz (2024) mentions that the current “talent crisis\"’ in auditing can have a demand explanation, citing an earlier version of this paper to highlight the role of monopsony power as a potential explanation. Our study is also related to Hoopes, Merkley, Pacelli, and Schroeder (2018), who, assuming that wages are exogenously given, find a positive association between auditor wages and audit quality. In contrast, we focus on the extent by which concentration in the demand for professionals with the skills to become auditors influences auditor skills, effort, wages, and eventually audit quality.12  \n\nMore generally, our study contributes to a growing literature in labor economics which documents that some employers exhibit substantial power in the labor market (Staiger et al. 2010; Falch 2010; Ransom and Sims 2010; Matsudaira 2013), and that firms with labor market power pay lower wages (Azar et al. 2020; Benmelech et al. 2022) and require higher skills (Hershbein et al. 2019). We find evidence consistent with these ideas in the audit profession and extend the literature by focusing on the influence of labor market power on effort required from employees and individual employers? outputs. Our evidence suggests that greater labor market power can, at least in the short run, help audit firms improve their quality, and that increased skills and effort can be mechanisms by which firms do so.  \n\n## II. LITERATURE AND HYPOTHESIS  \n\n# The Importance of Human Capital in the Audit Profession  \n\nRecent archival literature highlights the importance of individual auditors and human capital for audit quality. A growing literature finds that individual partners influence the quality of the audits they lead (e.g., Gul, Wu, and Yang 2013; Aobdia, Lin, and Petacchi 2015; Knechel, Vanstraelen, and Zerni 2015; Lennox and Wu 2018). While limited, the literature on audit team members below the lead partner also finds that they significantly influence audit quality (e.g. Kornberger et al. 2011; Carter and Spence 2014; Westermann, Bedard, and Earley 2015; Bol, Estep, Moers, and Peecher 2018; Contessotto, Knechel, and Moroney 2019; Aobdia et al. 2023).  \n\nIn contrast, the literature on the factors that affect the supply and demand for human capital in the audit profession remains limited. Aobdia et al. (2018) find that foreign-born graduates contribute to the profession's human capital. Cascino, Tamayo, and Vetter (2021) find that after the adoption of CPA mobility provisions, the wages of accounting professionals decrease, while employment levels are unaffected. Studies by Beck et al. (2018), Hoopes et al. (2018), and Lee et al. (2022), discussed above, also focus on the effect of local supply characteristics and auditor wages on audit quality. Overall, the characteristics of local demand for human capital in the audit profession and its impact on audit quality are not well understood.  \n\n# Labor Market Power and the Auditing Profession  \n\n### Labor market power  \n\nThe labor economics literature has increasingly paid attention to the concept of labor market monopsony and labor market power, whereby reduced competition for talent among firms shifts the bargaining balance toward employers (Boal and Random 1997; Ashenfelter et al. 2010; Manning 2011; CEA 2016). A growing literature documents evidence of declining competition for labor in the U.s., and recent anecdotes and court cases confirm that local labor market power exists in both lower- and higher-skilled occupations, including nursing, technology, and academia (e.g., Delrahim 2019; Satisky 2019).  \n\nMany characteristics of the auditing profession suggest that labor market power exists. The market for auditing services is concentrated (e.g., Gerakos and Syverson 2015). The Big 4 firms hire the bulk of accounting graduates in the U.S. (Moritz 2014; Nieh 2016; Lee et al. 2022), which suggests that local alternate employment opportunities are limited, at least for those with less experience. Magnifying the need for accounting graduates to work in public accounting firms, most U.S. states impose experience requirements in accounting-related fields to grant CPA licenses (e.g., Armitage 2014). Further, public accounting firms typically adopt local recruiting strategies, hiring mostly within a 60-mile radius (Lee et al. 2022). Local hiring could limit the geographic mobility of accounting graduates, similar to other professions, such as schoolteachers, academics, and nurses, where the effect of local labor market power has empirically been documented (Luizer and Thornton 1986; Ransom 1993; Hirsch and Schumacher 1995). Theories of monopsony power suggest that under such conditions, local labor market power can exist in the audit profession (Boal and Ransom 1997).  \n\nNevertheless, the AICPA has for more than 20 years highlighted the search for talent as the top concern of audit firms (Drew 2015). This concern has intensified recently due to more early-career CPAs leaving public accounting firms (Hermanson, Houston, Stefaniak, and Wilkins 2016). Moreover, alternate career opportunities for individuals with the skills to become auditors exist, including corporate positions and consulting or tax positions within public accounting or other firms (e.g., Hoopes et al. 2018). Some professionals, particularly new graduates in search of a first position, might also find it easier to initially move across different geographies. 13 If audit firms intensely compete for talent, or the labor force is geographically mobile, labor market power in the audit profession might be lower than anticipated.  \n\nTheoretically, labor market power results from employers facing upward-sloping labor supply. Profit maximization leads them to pay wages lower than their marginal revenue product, because of the need to raise wages for all employees if employers try to hire another employee requiring a higher wage (e.g., Boal and Ransom 1997). This departure of wages from marginal revenue product is absent when labor markets are competitive and employers are price takers.  \n\nTo explore how audit offices use labor market power and illustrate the different forces at play, we propose the following theoretical framework, which adapts and expands Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984).14 Suppose that risk-neutral employees receive wages $W$ , and have the possibility to either shirk, or provide effort at cost $e$ . If employees shirk, they are caught with probability $p$ and fired, having to resort to their outside option $V(L M P,s)$ , which decreases in local labor market power LMP, and increases in their skills $s$ . Employees net utility if they do not shirk is their pay less the cost of their effort, $W{-}e$ , and if they shirk is $p V(L M P,s){+}(I{-}p)W$ The latter is a weighted average in utilities depending on whether the employee is caught shirking. In equilibrium, the employer sets wages $W$ such that workers are indifferent between providing costly effort or shirking, that is, $W{-}e{=}p V(L M P,s){+}(I{-}p)W_{\\cdot}$ or $p W{-}e{=}p V(L M P,s)$ (1). Doing so minimizes wages paid but nevertheless ensures provision of costly effort.  \n\nComparative statics from Equation (1) yield the following observations: when labor market power LMP is greater, the value of the outside option $V(L M P,s)$ is lower, and to satisfy Equation (1), ceteris paribus the employer can reduce wages $W$ , or set higher effort $e$ for the employees, or require more skills from employees (i.e., increase $s$ ).15 Thus, we first study audit offices? skill requirements, effort, and wages to shed light on whether and how audit offices use labor market power and answer the following research question.  \n\nRQ1: What are the consequences of local labor market power in the auditing profession, if any, in terms of skill and effort requirements and wages?  \n\n### Potential effect on audit quality  \n\nBased on Equation (1), employers with greater labor market power can require greater skills and/or greater effort from prospective and incumbent employees without increasing wages, or require similar skills and effort at lower wages. Thus, labor market power can affect audit quality through two mechanisms, a change in the skills and a change in the effort of individual auditors. Greater skills and effort likely increase audit quality, but whether greater labor market power leads to greater skills and effort is uncertain, because employers also have an opportunity to hire similarly skilled employees at lower wages. We also note that if employers reduce wages too much, then skills and effort would decrease. But this is unlikely to be a credible equilibrium in practice, because otherwise audit offices with lower labor market power would also likely reduce skills and effort to pay lower wages. Furthermore, it might take some time for newly hired auditors with greater skills to significantly influence the audit quality of an office, if previously hired auditors have different skill levels and acquiring new skills is more difficult for them. In contrast, an office with an increase in labor market power and thus in bargaining power can immediately require all auditors, including those that were previously hired, to increase effort. Overall, based on this framework, the ex-ante effect of labor market power on audit quality is somewhat unclear and depends on the extent by which auditors with labor market power require greater skills or ask for greater effort from employees, or reduce wages. However, given that the costs of employee skills and effort decrease with labor market power (i.e., employers with greater labor market power can use the same wage to buy higher skills and effort),it seems reasonable to expect employee skills and effort to increase or at least remain the same with labor market power in equilibrium. That is, two likely scenarios are that employers with labor market power moderately reduce wages or keep wages constant while increasing skills and effort, resulting in higher audit quality, or reduce wages while keeping effort and skills the same. We state our hypothesis in its alternative form:  \n\nH1: Audit offices with greater labor market power provide higher-quality audits.  \n\nOverall, labor market power may affect wages, skills, and required effort. Changes in skills and required effort should ultimately influence audit quality. We thus initially focus on these relations, and next examine cross-sectional settings in which local labor market power is expected to be more salient. Evidence from these tests can shed light on whether and how labor market power affects audit quality and mitigate omitted variable and endogeneity concerns.  \n\n## III. DATA, KEY MEASURES, AND SAMPLE  \n\n### Job Posting Data  \n\nWe use job posting data provided by Burning Glass Technologies Inc. Over the past decade, online posting has become the major channel by which firms circulate job openings, with a boom in job posting sites, such as Indeed, Glassdoor, and Career Builder. Starting from 2010, BGT has tracked and collected job postings from about 40,000 job search platforms as well as directly from U.S. companies’ websites. Over this period, BGT recorded a total of 3,670,517,432 postings, de-duplicated for identical job postings that were posted on multiple sites. Given the breadth of its coverage, the BGT data are more comprehensive than data from any single job posting site, such as CareerBuilder (Hershbein and Kahn 2018).  \n\nBGT extracts several data items from job postings, including employer name, posting date, title, location, occupation, skills or certification required, and minimum education or experience. The BGT job posting data have been used in labor economics (e.g., Azar et al. 2020; Deming and Kahn 2018; Hershbein and Kahn 2018). In contrast to these studies, which focus on aggregated labor markets, we study a specific labor market segment—the auditor labor market. This setting is particularly suitable because human capital constitutes an audit firm's most important asset, personnel hired by audit firms tends to be more homogenous than those hired by industrial and financial firms, and output measures of audit quality are available.  \n\n### Measure of Auditor Labor Market Power  \n\nWe rely on the top 50 audit firms from 2010 to 2017 to construct a measure of auditor labor market power. We manually match the top 50 audit firms to BGT employers by name and obtain exact matches for 47 of the 50 audit firms.16 We exclude BGT employers that are related to these audit firms but have names pointing towards non-auditing services, such as tax and advisory (e.g., “PWC ADVISORY SERVICES\"). We then retrieve all the job postings of the matched audit firms between 2010-2017 and keep only audit-related positions, which are defined as job postings with one of the following keywords in the job title: “audit, “auditing,\" \"assurance,”“accounting,”“account,” “accountant,” and “accountancy”, or identified with Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code “13-2011\" (i.e., the occupation of \"accountants and auditors\").17 During our sample period, these top audit firms posted a total of  \n\n134,511 audit positions. The key information in a job posting is job location, particularly the state and county of a job. Among the 98,834 job postings of Big 4 auditors, only 0.2 percent of them have missing county-level location information. We then match the state and county associated with every job posting to its corresponding Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA).  \n\nFollowing Azar et al. (2020), we measure labor market power as the HerfindahlHirschman Index (HHI) of the labor market at the CBSA-year level. We first calculate the share of auditor i's job postings in CBSA $j$ and year $t$ , equal to the total number of audit-related job vacancies that auditor $i$ posts in CBSA $j$ and year $t$ divided by the total number of auditrelated job vacancies posted by all top audit firms in CBSA $j$ and year $t.$ We then sum the squared shares to derive the labor market HHI. The formula can be described as follows.  \n\n$$\nL a b o r\\_M a r k e t\\_H H I_{j,t}=\\sum_{i}^{I}{S h a r e^{2}}_{i,j,t}\n$$  \n\nwhere $S h a r e_{i,j,t}$ is the share of auditor i's job postings in CBSA $j$ and year $t$ .This measure captures the concentration of auditor labor market in each local area and year. Based on the theoretical predictions in Boal and Ransom (1997) and Hershbein et al. (2019) and empirical studies by Azar et al. (2020) and Benmelech et al. (2022), audit offices in more concentrated labor markets (higher labor market HHI) are expected to have higher labor market power. For example, during our sample period, Baton Rouge, LA (Tulsa, OK) has a labor market HHI of 0.8414 (0.1645) and thus should have a highly concentrated (more competitive) auditor labor market. Note that the labor market HHI of a given CBSA and year is determined by the interplay among all audit firms with a presence in the same locality, rather than by any single audit firm. Thus, the effects of labor market HHI are less likely to be confounded by characteristics of individual audit firms. Auditor labor market HHI is autocorrelated at about 50 percent, consistent with concentration representing a reasonably persistent attribute of a local labor market (untabulated). Given that there is substantial variation in auditor labor market power across CBSAs, as shown in Table 1, and relatively limited time-series variation over eight years of data, our empirical analyses focus on exploiting the cross-sectional variation.  \n\nOur measure is distinct from measures of product market concentration. The correlation between labor market concentration (Labor_Market_HHI) and the fee-based audit product market concentration (Product_Market_HHI) is 0.1774. Figure 1, which reports the scatterplot of the natural logarithm of average labor market concentration and the natural logarithm of average product market concentration, further confirms that these two measures capture different underlying constructs. Table 1 shows the CBSAs with the highest (lowest) labor market HHI are Boulder, CO, Shreveport, LA, and Baton Rouge, LA (Wichita, KS, Oklahoma City, OK, and Tulsa, OK). In contrast, as shown in Table OA1 of the online appendix, the CBSAs with the most (least) concentrated product market are Lexington-Fayette, KY, Billings, MT, and Albuquerque, NM (Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, FL, Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, CA, and Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX).  \n\n### Measures of Audit Quality  \n\nWe use two proxies for audit quality, following prior studies (e.g., DeFond and Zhang 2014). Aobdia (2019b) shows that these measures predict audit practitioner assessments of audit quality. First, we use restatements. Restatement is an indicator variable that equals one if the fiscal year $t$ is restated, as per Audit Analytics.18 We expect audit offices with higher audit quality to have clients that are less likely to restate earnings (e.g., DeFond and Zhang 2014). Second, we proxy for audit quality using the discretionary accruals from the cross-sectional modified Jones model (e.g., Dechow, Sloan, and Sweeney 1995; Yu 2008; Aobdia and Petacchi 2023). We estimate the following regression model.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{T A_{i,t}}{A s s e t s_{i,t-1}}=\\delta_{0}+\\delta_{1}\\frac{1}{A s s e t s_{i,t-1}}+\\delta_{2}\\frac{\\Delta R e v_{i,t}-\\Delta A R_{i,t}}{A s s e t s_{i,t-1}}+\\delta_{3}\\frac{P P E_{i,t}}{A s s e t s_{i,t-1}}+\\varepsilon_{i,t},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $T A(T o t a l a c c r u a l s)_{i,t}=I B C_{i,t}-C F O_{i,t};I B C_{i,t}=$ Income before extraordinary items (obtained from the cash flow statement); $C F O_{i,t}{=}O A N C F_{i,t}$ (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) $-X I D O C_{i,t}$ (Extraordinary Items and Discontinued Operations); $A s s e t s_{i,t-1}=$ total assets in the preceding year; $\\Delta R e v_{i,t}=$ change in revenues from the preceding year; $\\Delta A R_{i,t}=$ change in accounts receivable from the preceding year; and $P P E_{i,t}=\\mathrm{gross}$ value of property, plant, and equipment. We estimate this regression each year using all client firm-year observations with the same two-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code, with the requirement to have at least eight observations available. We use the absolute value of the residual $\\varepsilon_{i,t}$ as our measure of absolute discretionary accruals (Accruals).  \n\n### Sample Selection  \n\nOur regression sample focuses on the Big 4 audit firms. Given their dominance in the audit market, the Big 4 are the main players in the labor market for public accountants and might also target different types of employees relative to smaller audit firms. We use the following procedures to select the regression sample. First, we begin with 54,247 client-year observations in Audit Analytics from 2010 through 2017. We then match every client company in Audit Analytics with Compustat. We require all measures of audit quality and control variables to be available. We are then left with 15,643 client-year observations. Second, we keep the 13,984 client-years audited by the Big 4. These client-years are audited by 268 local offices, of which PricewaterhouseCoopers has 65 offices, Ernst & Young has 70, Deloitte & Touche has 60, and KPMG has 73. Next, for these 268 audit offices, we match the city where the office is located, provided in Audit Analytics, with the CBSA of job postings and only keep audit offices where Big 4 firms have job postings. We end up with 261 audit offices in 104 cities during the 2010-2017 period, corresponding to 11,359 client-year observations.  \n\n## IV. EMPIRICAL ANALYSES  \n\n### Descriptive Statistics  \n\nTable 2 reports the descriptive statistics. The mean (median) auditor labor market HHI at the CBSA-year level is 0.2684 (0.2552), above the 0.25 threshold for high concentration provided by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). The mean absolute value of discretionary accruals is 0.1415. The mean restatement is $14.85\\%$ . An average client-year in the sample has total assets of $\\$1.7$ billion, a leverage of $39.3\\%$ , a return on assets of $10.35\\%$ , capital expenditures $4.9\\%$ of total assets, and sales growth of $8.3\\%$  \n\n### Labor Market Concentration, Skill Requirements, Effort, and Wages (RQ1)  \n\nIn this section, we examine how audit offices use labor market power in terms of skills and effort requirements, and wages (RQ1). We first examine the relation between labor market concentration and skill requirements in online job postings by estimating the following regression at the audit office-year level.  \n\n$$\nS k i l l s_{j,t}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}L a b o r\\_M a r k e t\\_H H I_{j,t}+\\beta_{2}P r o d u c t\\_M a r k e t\\_H H I_{j,t}+\\sum\\beta_{l}A u d i t o r\\_C h a r+A u S\n$$  \n\n$\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\mathrm{J}\\kappa u t v a_{j,t}-p_{0}+p_{1}\\bot u u v\\sigma_{-}\\iota\\mathfrak{n}u r\\kappa e\\iota_{-}\\iota\\mathfrak{n}u\\iota_{j,t}+p_{2}r\\prime\\sigma u u\\mathfrak{u}\\iota_{-}\\iota\\mathfrak{n}u r\\kappa e\\iota_{-}\\mathfrak{n}u\\iota_{j,t}+\\sum\\rho_{l}\\iota\\mathfrak{n}u u u u\\sigma_{-}\\mathfrak{c}\\iota u u}\\ &{\\sum\\beta_{m}C B S A_{-}C h a r+\\sum\\beta_{n}m e a n(C l i e n t_{-}C h a r)+A u d i t F i r m\\:F E+Y e a r\\:F E+\\varepsilon_{j,t},\\qquad(2)}\\end{array}$ where the suffixes $j$ and $t$ correspond to audit offices and years, respectively. Skills measures skill requirements in job postings. Besides the number of skills, we are particularly interested in soft skills,19 because the auditing literature highlights the importance of soft skills, such as negotiation and interpersonal skills in determining the outcome of the audit, due to extensive auditor teamwork and interactions with clients (e.g., Nelson and Tan 2005; Knechel et al. 2013). The labor economics literature also documents a positive relation between the demand for soft skills and measures of performance (e.g., Deming and Kahn 2018). We use the following measures of skill requirements on job postings for each audit office in a given CBSA-year: (1) #Skill_ Category: the number of unique categories of skills;20 (2) Soft/All: the average ratio of the number of soft skills over the number of all skills; (3) Soft/Hard: the average ratio of the number of soft skills over the number of hard skills; (4) %Soft, the fraction of job postings that require soft skills; and (5) Yrs_Edu, the average number of minimum years of education. To the extent that labor market power exists in the audit profession, we expect Labor_Market_HHI to load positively. Product_Market_HHI, Auditor_Char, CBSA_Char, and Client_Char are product market concentration and control variables at the auditor-, CBSA-, and client-level, respectively. We also include audit firm and year fixed effects to control for unobserved timeinvariant audit firm effects and time trend. All variables are defined in Appendix A.  \n\nWe report the results in Table 3, Panel A. We find positive associations between labor market concentration and skill requirements. These results suggest that audit offices with greater labor market power demand more skills and are consistent with the finding of Hershbein and Macaluso (2018) and Hershbein et al. (2019) that labor market power raises skill requirements. In addition, the coefficients on Product_Market_HHI are generally insignificant, which confirms that labor market power is a distinct construct from product market concentration. We caveat that these results apply to newly hired auditors because of lack of data on incumbent auditor skills. However, incumbent auditors might also upgrade their skills more often through increased training, although we cannot measure this mechanism.  \n\nNext, we focus on auditor effort. We acknowledge that measuring effort is difficult, and that while directly measuring the quality of effort is not possible, we can measure its quantity. Our measure can proxy for overall effort so long that the requirements for quantity and quality of effort are positively correlated. We use the total number of auditors working in an audit office, divided by the total assets under audit (#Employee/Assets) in millions or by total audit fees in millions (#Employee/Fees).21 The lower these measures, the more auditors in a given office need to work on a per client asset or fee basis. Thus, we expect to find negative associations with labor market concentration when using these effort measures in Model (2). To construct these measures, we obtain the LinkedIn employment records of all individual auditors as of the end of 2019. These snapshots include all individuals who ever worked in any audit office and show the history of all their past and current employments. We measure the number of audit personnel in each audit office in a year by counting the number of auditors whose employment histories show that they worked there at that time.22  \n\nWe report the results in columns (1) and (2) of Table 3, Panel B. We find significantly negative associations between labor market concentration and measures of effort. A onestandard-deviation increase in labor market concentration is associated with a 0.00036 (=- $0.004^{*}0.0901;$ decrease in the number of auditors per million dollars of client assets and a 0.709 $(=-7.873^{*}0.0901$ ) decrease in the number of auditors per million dollars of audit fees, which are equivalent to $10.6\\%$ and $7.2\\%$ decreases for an average firm, respectively. As these two measures are slightly skewed, we also use their natural logarithms in columns (3) and (4) of Table 3, Panel B and find similar results. Overall, these results are consistent with offices with greater labor market power demanding more effort from their individual auditors.  \n\nFinally, we focus on auditor wages by estimating the following regression.  \n\n$L o g(W a g e)_{j,k,t}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}$ Labor_Market. $\\_H H I_{j,t}+\\beta_{2}$ Product _Market _HHIj,t + β3Managerj,t + $\\begin{array}{r}{\\beta_{4}S e n i o r\\_M a n a g e r/P a r t n e r_{j,t}+\\sum\\beta_{l}A u d i t o r\\_C h a r+\\sum\\beta_{m}C B S A\\_C h a r+}\\end{array}$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\sum\\beta_{n}m e a n(C l i e n t\\_C h a r)+A u d i t F i r m F E+Y e a r F E+\\varepsilon_{j,t},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere the suffixes $j,k$ and $t$ correspond to audit offices, job positions, and years, respectively. $L o g(W a g e)$ is the natural logarithm of the starting wage offered on a job position. The wage data are from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). When any organization in the U.S. hires an immigrant on an H-1B visa, it must file a labor condition application (LCA) with the DOL.23 Audit firms often hire skilled immigrants on H-1B visas and thus file a significant number of LCAs (Aobdia et al. 2018). We retrieve the LCAs filed by Big 4 audit firms on audit positions. We then match the locations of these LCAs to audit offices and keep those in cities where audit offices are located to ensure that the auditor labor market HHI measure is available. The variable of interest in this model is labor market concentration, Labor_Market_HHI.  \n\nWe report the results in Table 3, Panel C, where we add two indicator variables to control for job seniority: Manager (Senior_Manager/Partner), equal to one if the position is at the manager level (senior manager level or above) and zero otherwise. The coefficient on Labor_Market_HHI is not significantly different from zero, which does not provide evidence to suggest that audit offices in CBSAs with more concentrated labor markets pay different wages relative to those in less concentrated labor markets. In an additional untabulated test, we further control for CBSA fixed effects and find that Labor_Market_HHI loads negatively with a small coefficient, suggesting that intertemporal increases in labor market concentration within a CBSA are associated with modest decreases in wages. However, we caveat that a regression with CBSA fixed effects becomes a time-series specification that exploits only eight years of observations. This likely removes relevant variation of interest and raises concerns about multicollinearity. Thus, we do not include CBSA fixed effects in our empirical analyses.  \n\nOverall, the results of higher skill requirements and effort at the same (or perhaps slightly lower) wages from audit offices in more concentrated markets indicate a departure of wages from marginal product of labor and suggest that audit offices in more concentrated labor markets may be more interested in recruiting more productive audit personnel and requiring higher effort rather than in reducing wages by large amounts.  \n\n### The Effect of Labor Market Power on Audit Quality (H1)  \n\nAfter providing evidence on how audit offices use labor market power, we focus on the effect of audit offices? labor market power on audit quality using the following regression.  \n\nAudit Qualityi,jt  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}L a b o r\\_M a r k e t\\_H H J_{j,t}+\\beta_{2}P r o d u c t\\_M a r k e t\\_H H I J_{j,t}+\\beta_{3}O f f i c e_{-}S i z e_{j,t}}\\ &{+\\beta_{4}C o m p l e x i t y_{j,t}+\\beta_{5}C B S A\\_E x p e r t\\_f_{j,t}+\\beta_{6}E d u c a t i o n j_{j,t}+\\beta_{7}\\#U n i v e r s i t i v e_{j,t}}\\ &{+\\beta_{8}R e a l\\_G D P_{j,t}+\\beta_{9}C o s t\\_L i v i n g_{j,t}+\\beta_{10}S i z e_{i,j,t}+\\beta_{11}M/\\beta_{i,j,t}+\\beta_{12}L e v e r a g e_{i,j,t}}\\ &{+\\beta_{13}R O A_{i,j,t}+\\beta_{14}Q u i c k_{i,j,t}+\\beta_{15}C A P E X\\_{i,j,t}+\\beta_{16}S D_{-}R e t_{i,j,t}+\\beta_{17}S a l e s\\_{-}G r o w t h_{i,j,t}}\\ &{+\\beta_{18}F o r e i g n_{i,j,t}+\\beta_{19}M W_{i,j,t}+\\beta_{20}F N D S R S E D_{i,j,t}+\\beta_{21}I N T C O V i_{i,j,t}}\\ &{+\\beta_{22}M e r g e r_{i,j,t}+\\beta_{23}I n f l u e n c e_{i,j,t}+\\beta_{24}F i r s t\\_T i m e_{i,j,t}+A u d i t F i r m F E}\\ &{+Y e a r F E+C l i e n t I n d u s t r y F E\\neq\\varepsilon_{i,j,t},(4)}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere the suffixes $i,j$ and $t$ correspond to clients, audit offices, and years, respectively. We use the two measures of audit quality discussed above, Restatement and Accruals, and expect negative associations between Labor_Market_HHI and these two measures.  \n\nWe control for Product_Market_HHI to rule out the possible confounding effects of the concentration of the audit product market on audit quality.24 We also add certain client and audit office-level characteristics that have been documented to affect audit quality (e.g., Francis and Yu 2009; Minutti-Meza 2013; DeFond, Erkens, and Zhang 2016; Hoopes et al 2018; Aobdia 2019b). We also control for macroeconomic conditions of the region in which the audit office is located, and include audit firm, year, and client industry fixed effects.25 We estimate the model using a logistic regression in column (1) and OLS in column (2). All continuous variables are winsorized at the top and bottom one percent and defined in Appendix A.  \n\nTable 4 reports the results. As expected, we find significantly negative coefficients on Labor_Market_HHI in both columns (p-value $\\leq5\\%$ ). For example, the coefficient in column (1) is -0.962, suggesting that at the average of control variables, an increase in audit offices' labor market power from the $25^{\\mathrm{th}}$ to the $75^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile is associated with a decrease of 1.2 percentage points in the probability of restatement. Taken together, the results provide consistent evidence that audit offices? labor market power improves audit quality.  \n\n### Cross-sectional Tests  \n\nOne concern about the results above is that they might be explained by unobserved factors correlated with both labor market concentration and audit quality. In this section, we mitigate this endogeneity concern by conducting several cross-sectional analyses. As suggested by Armstrong et al. (2022), cross-sectional tests can identify a subsample where correlated omitted factors are likely to exist but the causal effect of the variable examined is less pronounced and use this subsample as a placebo. Following this idea, we examine whether the relation between labor market concentration and audit quality is stronger when auditors have lower outside options such that labor market power of audit firms is likely to be more pronounced. The correlated omitted variables likely exist in both low- and high-outside option markets, but we expect the existence and effects of labor market power to be much weaker in markets with high outside options. Thus, we can use the results in the high-mobility/outside opportunity markets as placebo tests. We consider two types of outside options: (1) local substitute employment opportunities outside the audit profession, which refer to the ease for employees to move to non-auditing jobs in the same area, and (2) geographic mobility, which refers to the ease of an employee to move to a different location.  \n\nWe first partition the sample by various measures of local substitute employment opportunities. We proxy for these using (1) the average number of accounting-related postings by a public company, (2) the average number of tax-related postings by a public company, (3)  \n\nthe total number of tax- or consulting-related postings by Big 4 audit firms, and (4) the total number of finance-related postings, respectively in a CBSA-year.26 We expect employees to have lower local opportunities outside the audit profession when their offices are located in CBSAs with fewer numbers of these job postings and classify observations with equal-to- or above-median (below-median) value in the partitioning variable into the high (low) local substitute employment opportunity subsample. Table 5, Panels A to D report the results with Restatement in columns (1) and (2) and Accruals in columns (3) and (4) as the dependent variables. The relations between labor market concentration and measures of audit quality are only significant when local substitute employment opportunities are lower.  \n\nNext, we partition the sample by various measures of geographic mobility, proxied by (1) the average distance between the area in which the labor market HHI is measured and other areas with the presence of at least one Big 4 office, (2) the local life quality using the Gallup well-being index of the area, and (3) the migration rate of the area, defined as (inflowoutflow)/total migration, respectively.27 We expect these measures to proxy for lower geographic mobility. Observations with equal-to- or above-median (below-median) value in the partitioning variable are classified into the low (high) mobility subsample. The results in Panels A to C of Table 6 consistently show that the effect of labor market power on audit quality is present only when employees? geographic mobility is lower.  \n\nTo further confirm that labor market power is more likely present when barriers to mobility are greater, we conduct similar cross-sectional analyses as in Tables 5 and 6 using the proxies for auditor skills, effort, and wages. We report the results in Tables OA2 to OA7 of the online appendix. The influence of labor market concentration on skills, effort, and wages is generally (but not always) only present when barriers to mobility are greater. Collectively, these cross-sectional analyses suggest that our results are unlikely to be explained by correlated omitted variables and provide additional evidence on the existence and effects of labor market power in auditing.  \n\n### Further Analyses on Local Audit Office Differentiation  \n\nAccording to Boal and Ransom (1997), labor market power can arise from oligopsony, where employers take each other's recruiting strategies as given (a la Cournot) or engage in tacit or explicit collusion in their recruiting practices, and differentiation. In the main analyses, we focus on oligopsony and use labor market concentration to capture the labor market power of all local audit offices. Another source of variation in labor market power may arise from differentiation of audit offices in the same area. Individual auditors might be more attracted to particular audit offices than others. From a theoretical standpoint, we can expand the analytical framework of Section II by adding a utility term, $B$ , that corresponds to office-level attributes, such as a higher labor market share, prestigious clients, or better training, and captures the dimensions along which audit offices are different from each other. Adding this differentiation factor into the model leads to the following equation in equilibrium: $p(W{+}B)$ e=pV(Labor_Market_HHI, s) (2). In this case, labor market power can be seen as depending on both area-level labor market concentration, Labor_Market_HHl, and office-level attributes, B. When the labor market power arising from these office-level atributes increases, to maintain Equation (2), this particular audit office can require greater skills $s$ or effort $e$ , or lower wages W. In other words, the implications of within-market differentiation are the same as those of cross-market labor market power, which is our initial focus. We note that Labor_Market_HHI and $B$ may reinforce each other, if preferences for specific offices are greater when labor market concentration is more salient. Overall, the discussion above suggests that either $B$ acts similarly to Labor_Market_HHI, or that Labor_Market_HHI and $B$ are complements and thus the results on Labor_Market_HHI are stronger in the subsample where $B$ exists.  \n\nAn important caveat with this expanded approach is that it assumes that labor market power arising from office-level attributes $B$ is similar among individual auditors. This would not occur if individuals had heterogeneous preferences.2α Thus, tests of particular audit office characteristics are likely more exploratory in nature. In this section, we explore whether labor market share, which captures the relative size of the office in the labor market of the locality, influences the relation between labor market concentration and audit quality. To the extent that offices with a higher share in the labor market are more desirable to individual auditors, we expect the results to be stronger for offices with a higher labor market share.  \n\nIn Table 7, we partition the sample by offices? labor market share, measured as auditor jobs posted by an audit office divided by the total auditor jobs posted by all top audit offices in the CBSA-year, and regress measures of audit quality on labor market power for offices with high and low labor market share separately. The effect of labor market power on audit quality is only present for offices with high labor market share. This finding is consistent with the idea that audit offices with a higher labor market share can more easily use labor market power. We also find some support on skills, effort, and wages in Tables OA8-10 of the online appendix, although the results are sometimes also significant for offices with lower labor market share.29 Overall, these results suggest that differentiation also likely exists in auditing labor markets.  \n\n### Further Analyses on Auditor Experience  \n\nWe focus on auditor experience in Table 8, and expect to find stronger results on more experienced auditors because an emerging literature highlights the importance of mid-career auditors on audit quality (e.g., Kornberger et al. 2011; Aobdia et al. 2023). We construct two labor market power measures for lower and higher experienced auditors, HHl_LowerExp and HHI_HigherExp, based on job postings for audit positions that require experience of three years or less and more than three years, respectively. We find that both restatement and accruals relate negatively to HHI_HigherExp but do not relate to HHI_LowerExp.30  \n\n### Robustness and Additional Tests  \n\nWe conduct a battery of ancillary tests to further mitigate endogeneity concerns and verify the robustness of our results. We first examine changes in audit quality in response to changes in labor market power arising from audit offices? client losses caused by clients being acquired during mergers and acquisitions. After a merger, the auditor of the target is typically dismissed (e.g., Firth 1999; Dhaliwal, Lamoreaux, Litov, and Neyland 2016).31 This client loss, plausibly exogenous to the quality of an audit office, can eventually diminish the office's capacity to hire labor, resulting in a potential increase in the labor market concentration of the CBSA where the affected office is located. To the extent that labor market power has a causal effect on audit quality, we expect a significant increase in the audit quality of all audit offices in the same CBSA after a client of an audit office is acquired.32  \n\nWe first identify 371 M&A deals in which a client firm is acquired by another company in a different CBSA. The treatment variable, Treated, equals one in the presence of such an acquisition event in a given CBSA and zero otherwise. The time variable, Post, is an indicator variable that equals one for all years following the event and zero otherwise. We report the results of the difference-in-differences analysis in Table OA11 of the online appendix. Panel A shows the effect of this shock on labor market concentration. We estimate this regression at the CBSA-year level, with CBSA and year fixed effects included. In column (1), the interaction TreatedxPost loads positively, suggesting that the audit labor market in the affected CBSA becomes more concentrated after the event. In column (2), we replace the dependent variable Labor_Market_HHI with Product_Market_HHI and do not find a positive change in response to client being acquired, which mitigates the possibility that audit quality is affected through a potential impact on audit market concentration rather than labor market power.  \n\nIf labor market power improves audit quality, we should observe an increase in the audit quality of clients in the affected CBSA in response to a client acquisition event. We regress audit quality on TreatedxPost, control variables, and fixed effects in Panel B. For a client in an affected CBSA to be included in the sample, it must meet the following conditions: (1) the affected CBSA does not have a client acquiring other companies (otherwise, the shock is contaminated), and (2) the client is not in the same industry as the focal client of the shock (otherwise, there might be extra auditor capacity available in this industry and this might contaminate the shock). The result of this difference-in-differences analysis suggests that after a client acquisition event that leads to a significant increase in labor market concentration, the audit quality of offices in the affected CBSA improves. In Panel C, we further show that the effects on labor market concentration and audit quality take place only after the client is acquired, suggesting that the pre-treatment trends are parallel. Overall, these results provide further support to the idea that labor market power has a causal effect on audit quality.  \n\nNext, we use an alternative measure of audit quality and consider additional control variables in Table OA 12 of the online appendix. In Panel A, we proxy for audit quality with Meet-or-Beat, an indicator variable equal to one if the client firm meets or beats the zero earnings per share (EPS) benchmark by or within five cents, and zero otherwise. We find that client firms of auditors in more concentrated labor markets are less likely to meet or narrowly beat earnings targets. To the extent that Meet-or-Beat negatively relates to audit quality, this result further supports our main findings. In Panel B, following prior studies such as Lennox and Li (2014), we add an indicator variable for whether the client firm's earnings in the prior year is restated, Lag_Restatement, when the dependent variable is Restatement. The results remain robust. In Panel C, we conduct a placebo test by examining the relation between audit quality and labor market power in hiring advisory-related (non-auditing) employees. The idea is that if the audit quality results are driven by auditors hired in more concentrated labor market being more talented and exerting greater effort, we should not observe a relation between audit quality and labor market power in advisory positions. We construct an alternative measure of auditors? labor market power in advisory jobs, HHI_Advisory, based on the number of advisory jobs posted by local audit offices. We find that this measure is not related to our measures of audit quality, consistent with our prediction.  \n\nIn Panel D, we construct an alternative measure of labor market concentration using the audit-related job postings of all audit firms that appear in Audit Analytics during the sample period. We continue to find a positive relation between this measure of labor market power (HHI_Alt) and audit quality, albeit weaker. The weaker results might be explained by larger audit firms targeting different types of personnel relative to smaller audit firms, consistent with the segmentation that also exists in auditing product markets. In Panel E, we expand the sample from Big 4 to Top 8, Top 16, or all top audit firms used to construct the labor market concentration measure and re-run the main regression in Table 4 in each of the alternative samples. The results remain robust in these alternative samples. In Panel F, we conduct an office-level regression by using the average measures of audit quality and client characteristics and find consistent results. Finally, we partition the sample based on the number of Top 8 and 16 audit firms present in each local market. We cannot partition based on the Big 4 firms, because of lack of variation in the sample. The results (untabulated) are generally stronger when there are fewer audit firms, consistent with Cournot strategies being facilitated when the number of audit offices is lower.  \n\n## V. CONCLUSION  \n\nRecent literature in labor economics has increasingly paid attention to labor market concentration, a phenomenon in which reduced labor market competition can give employers the power to dictate wages (e.g., Azar et al. 2020; Benmelech et al. 2022). Firms with labor market power tend to have greater bargaining power in recruiting and retaining workers, as these workers have limited outside options (Berger et al. 2022). We focus on the audit profession and examine how audit offices use labor market power and whether audit offices with higher labor market power can provide higher-quality audits.  \n\nWe first provide evidence that audit offices in more concentrated labor markets comparatively require higher skills in their job postings and greater effort from their individual auditors, and their wages are similar or slightly lower, supporting the idea that labor market power exists in the audit profession. We then provide evidence that audit offices with greater labor market power provide higher-quality audit services. We further show that this result is only present when employees in the local labor market have fewer local outside employment opportunities or lower geographic mobility, consistent with labor market power explaining these results and mitigating omitted variable concerns.  \n\nTaken together, our results suggest a short-run positive effect of labor market power in the audit profession, in the form of higher audit quality. Nevertheless, we caveat that the benefits of labor market concentration might not be permanent. In fact, large welfare losses of labor market power have been documented in other settings (e.g., Berger et al. 2022), and prospective employees might be tempted by alternative career options and have lower incentives to begin their careers in the audit profession. Thus, labor market power may serve as an explanation for the “talent shortage in public accounting (e.g., Schmalz 2024), and also be consistent with regulatory concerns about negative effects of audit firm concentration. While regulators are mostly concerned about how concentration might distort the supply of audit services,33 our results suggest that they might need to focus more on how concentration might reduce the atractiveness of the audit profession, and ultimately affect the supply of individual auditors in the long run. In general, we need more studies to better understand the causes of the apparent lack of interest of individuals to join the accounting profession.  \n\nOur study is not without limitations. First, while we conduct extensive cross-sectional analyses following Armstrong et al. (2022) to mitigate alternative explanations such as the role of product market competition and endogeneity concerns, our tests nevertheless are associations between a measure of labor market concentration measured at the area level and proxies for labor market power and audit quality. Second, we can only estimate the effect of labor market power on audit quality for publicly traded corporations. While large audit firms significantly reduced their assurance services of non-public entities and even smaller public companies just after the implementation of Sarbanes Oxley in 2002, and prior to the start of our sample period in 2010 (Duguay, Minnis, and Sutherland 2020; Aobdia, Enache, and Srivastava 2021), we are unable to determine whether auditor wages, effort, and skill requirements are different across public and non-public clients. Third, our sample period takes place prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemic-driven changes in work conditions might have affected the relation between local job postings concentration and auditor wages, skills, and quality, especially if audit firms or other employers interested in hiring people with the skill set to become auditors allow their new hires to work remotely. Such changes may explain why competition for talent increased recently and auditor wages have significantly increased over the past few years. While we believe that these questions are important, we leave their answers to future research.  \n\n# REFERENCES  \n\nDenavior ana numan Decision rrocesses ss (z): 1so-1/2.   \nAkerlof, G. A. 1984.

As defined in Appendix A, labor market Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (Labor_Market_HHI) at the CBSAyear level is calculated by computing the share of job openings of each audit office that posts job openings in the CBSA in a year and then summing the squared shares. Audit product market HerfindahlHirschman Index (Product_Market_HHI) at the CBSA-year level is calculated by computing the share of audit fees of each audit office in the CBSA in a year and then summing the squared shares. The size of the circles in the scatter is proportional to labor market size proxied by the average total number of job postings in a CBSA. The fitted line is from a regression weighing by labor market size proxied by the average total number of job postings in a CBSA; the estimated coefficients are displayed at the bottom of the figure, and the coefficient on the natural logarithm of product market concentration $(L o g$ Product Market HHI) is significant at the $1\\%$ level.  \n\nThis table reports the average labor market concentration by CBSA, together with the average product market concentration, labor market size proxied by average CBSA-year count of job postings, and product market size proxied by average CBSA-year sum of audit fees (in millions).   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"5\">PanelA larketconcentration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\">Panel A: The 15 CBSAs with the highest labor

 \n\nThis table examines how audit offices use their labor market power. Panel A presents the relation between labor market concentration and skill requirements. Using the jobs posted by an audit office in a year, we compute the dependent variables in columns (1)-(5) respectively as: (1) #Skill_Category: the number of unique categories of required skills, (2) Soft/All: the average ratio of the number of soft skills over the number of all skills required, (3) Soft/Hard: the average ratio of the number of soft skills over the number of hard skills required, $(4)\\%S o f t$ : the fraction of jobs that require soft skills, and (5) Yrs_Edu: the average number of minimum years of education required. Panel B presents the relation between labor market concentration and several proxies for audit effort. The dependent variables are (1) #Employees/Assets: the ratio of the number of auditors in an audit office over total assets audited (in millions), (2) #Employees/Fees: the ratio of the number of auditors in an audit office over total fees earned (in millions), (3) Log(#Employees/Assets): the natural logarithm of #Employees/Assets, and (4) Log(#Employees/Fees): the natural logarithm of #Employees/Fees, respectively in columns (1)-(4). Panel C presents the relation between labor market concentration and auditor wages. The dependent variable is Log( Wage), the natural logarithm of wages offered by an auditor office in a year for specific positions. Labor_Market_HHI is the labor market Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) calculated based on job postings in a CBSA-year. We estimate the regressions at the audit office-year level. Control variables as well as audit firm fixed effects and year fixed effects are included in all regressions. Standard errors are clustered at the audit office level and are reported in parentheses. \\*\\*\\*, \\*\\*, and \\* indicate significance at the $1\\%$ $5\\%$ ,and $10\\%$ levels, respectively. Variables are defined in Appendix A.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"6\"></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td></tr><tr><td

We estimate a differentiated jobs model using application data from Careerbuilder.com. We find direct evidence of substantial job differentiation. Without the use of instruments for wages, job applications appear very inelastic with respect to wages. Plausible instruments produce elastic firm-level application supply curves. Under some assumptions, the implied market level labor supply elasticity is 0.5, while the firm level labor elasticity is 4.8. This suggests that workers may produce $21\\%$ more than their wage level, consistent with significant monopsonypower.  \n\nJosé A.

As recognized by Robinson (1933), job differentiation is one possible source of imperfect competition in the labor market. When jobs are differentiated, workers cannot costlessly substitute between jobs: even if a job pays more than another job, it is likely to be different in ways that are relevant to the Worker's well-being, e.g. the alternative job may be further from the worker's home (Marinescu and Rathelot, 2018). Such job differentiation can allow firms to pay workers less than their marginal revenue product. Card et al. (2018) point out that a simple \"product differentiation\" model of jobs can reconcile many interesting facts about labor markets. In their conclusion, they suggest that labor economics should perhaps move in the direction of Industrial Organization (IO), studying supply and demand in specific labor markets, with an emphasis on differentiated jobs.  \n\nIn this paper, we take one step in the empirical implementation of that suggestion, leveraging rich data on worker and job characteristics. We adopt a firmly IO-style approach to the question, which will bring some advantages but also leave open questions for further research. Specifically, we model job application choice, at the worker level, using a classic parametric discrete-choice framework.  \n\nWe use a large online job posting and applications dataset from CareerBuilder.com. Azar, Marinescu and Steinbaum (2022) employ this data source to document labor market concentration and the association between concentration and wages, and Marinescu and Rathelot (2018) use the data to estimate Workers' preference for nearby jobs and the degree of geographic mismatch. We use the data to estimate a nested logit model of unemployed workers' demand for differentiated jobs. As in IO models following on Berry (1994), each choice (here, a job) has both observed and unobserved characteristics. Jobs are observably differentiated in terms of location (ZIP code), occupation and the wage being offered. Importantly, workers' ZIP code is also known, which allows us to estimate the role of distance in workers' preferences.  \n\nOur data has a panel structure of jobs within (labor) markets, with heterogeneous decision-makers (workers) who choose among these jobs. As suggested by the nonparametric identification argument of Berry and Haile (2022), this data structure allows us to exploit within-market (cross-worker) variation as well as between-market variation in the wages and characteristics of job vacancies. Berry and Haile (2022) advance a \"fixed-effects\" style panel-data argument that inspires our approach to identification and estimation. Our approach then allows us to exploit several sources of data variation as we explore the sources of job differentiation. We show how different data sources and assumptions can sequentially combine to uncover the nature of the job differentiation. In each step of our sequential approach, additional assumptions generate additional insights about job differentiation. In particular, our estimation follows a two-step strategy that is broadly suggested by the identification arguments in Berry and Haile (2022). In a third step, we make additional assumptions to convert job application elasticities into labor supply elasticities, and to derive the wage markdown.  \n\nIn our first step, we use our applicant/worker data with a nested logit approach to examine the degree of job differentiation and its sources. In this step, we estimate a job-specific utility that accounts for all job-specific variables (including the posted wage). The first step results allow us to explore the role of geography and occupation in differentiated jobs, without using any of our later assumptions.  \n\nThe nested logit model has two \"levels\". In the bottom level multinomial logit, a worker chooses which job to apply to within a given labor market (a 6-digit SOC occupation by commuting zone) and Week; this is a conditional application probability, and thus is only estimated for workers who apply in the market-week. We then focus on workers who applied in the focal labor market in at least one week. In the top level logit each worker chooses whether to apply to this focal labor market in the given week. The worker's decision depends on the expected value of applying to that market, which we obtain from the bottom level logit.  \n\nIn the bottom level multinomial logit, we estimate job fixed effects, which are closely related to the number of applications that each job receives. Importantly, these job fixed effects also take into account variation in the competition with other jobs across weeks. So, for example, if a job gets many applications in a given week, it could mean that the job is great, or it could mean that there are few other desirable jobs in that week. Thus, job fixed effects are identified off of differences in the number of applications across jobs as well as variation in choice sets across weeks. An additional source of variation that is useful for the identification of substitution patterns across jobs is the geographic distance between a worker and a job. The distance of the worker from job B is naturally excluded from the worker's preference for job A.  \n\nIn the top level logit, with market and week fixed effects, we explain each worker's choice of whether to apply to a given market as a function of the expected utility (inclusive value) of doing so, as calculated using the bottom level logit results. This relies on two sources of variation. First, there is market-week variation in the value of applying to a market (classic panel identification for the market level panel). Second, there is variation in job valuation across workers in the same market due to distance, which leads to variation in the inclusive value within markets and across weeks: that is, workers who happen to be closer to the available jobs in a given market-week have a higher inclusive value for applying within the market. In the top level logit, the coefficient on the inclusive value (the nesting parameter) measures the impact of a higher inclusive value on the probability of applying in that market-week. While the bottom level logit takes into account within-market competition between jobs, this top level logit also takes into account competition across markets and the relative attractiveness of jobs in a market-week.  \n\nBecause of the nature of the nested logit, sources of identification in the bottom and top level logit are combined to yield the final job utilities. These job utilities can be seen as adjusted job application numbers, taking into account the competition of other jobs both within market (from the bottom level logit) and across markets (from the top level logit). The number of applications by itself— which one can use in a descriptive approach as in Marinescu and Wolthoff (2016) —is not a sufficient statistic for the utility of a job: the number of applications reflects the utility of this job relative to other jobs it competes With.  \n\nThe results from our nested logit model imply a substantial degree of job differentiation. We find a nesting parameter well below one, which implies that there is a correlation between the unobserved utilities of jobs within a market (defined as an SOC-6 occupation by commuting zone). This means that within-market jobs compete more tightly with each other than with jobs in different markets. Using a decomposition of variance, we find that two thirds of the variance in the total utility of a job is explained by worker-job match specific utility, with only a third explained by factors common across all workers, such as the wage. We do observe one dimension of the match-specific utility: geographic distance. We find that $18\\%$ of the variance in the total utility of a job is explained by the geographic distance (ZIP code to ZIP code) between the job and the job seeker. Overall, we find that jobs are meaningfully differentiated both within and across markets, with both occupation and geographic distance playing important roles.  \n\nIn a second step, we use the results from our nested logit approach to understand the impact of the wage on the average value of a job to workers. We regress our estimated job utilities (or values) on wages and job/firm characteristics, yielding wage coefficients that are necessary for the calculation of Wage elasticities. Note that some non-wage job characteristics will be observed to us, but many will not. These unobserved (to us) job characteristics could, for example, involve employment benefits and /or the employment-related reputation of the firm. The presence of unobserved job characteristics creates a classic endogeneity problem, similar to the endogeneity of price in the estimation of differentiated product models of supply and demand. We find that when the endogeneity problem is ignored, simple OLS estimates can produce downward sloping labor supply curves. This is likely due to a negative correlation between wages and unobserved application-relevant characteristics.  \n\nThis endogeneity problem can be addressed via instrumental variables that shift firm level wages but not worker preferences. Our preferred instruments take advantage of the fact that wages are often set, in part, at the firm level (Chen, 2021; Hazell, Patterson and Sarsons, 2021). We construct instruments from competitive conditions faced by the firm in the other markets where it posts job vacancies. Specifically, our preferred instrument is the predicted wage in the other markets the firm is also posting in (excluding the same occupation and the same commuting zone).  \n\nThese two steps produce a set of job application elasticities that account for wage endogeneity as well as heterogeneous worker taste for differentiated jobs. We derive application elasticities at the firm level, vacancy level and market level. Our use of application data has the advantage of directly measuring a labor supply side response. However, the wage elasticity of applications is not a labor supply elasticity. In a third step, we draw on a set of results from the literature: under some strong but somewhat plausible assumptions, these results allow us to translate our vacancy demand result into firm and market level labor supply wage elasticities. Unlike some other work, we do not attempt to estimate the labor demand side of the model. Instead, we ilustratively use a very simple posted wage model to translate our estimated firm level application elasticities into wage markdowns, $(\\mathrm{MRP}_{L}-w)/w,$ where $\\mathrm{MRP}_{L}$ is the marginal revenue product of labor and $w$ is the wage. We find that the average markdown is about $21\\%$ , implying that workers are about $21\\%$ more productive than their wages. As an illustration of the policy-relevance of this degree of market power, we can use the market level labor supply elasticity to determine if a labor market is a valid antitrust market using a critical elasticity test (Harris and Simons, 1991). We find that market level elasticities are low enough to typically make an SOC-6 occupation by commuting zone a plausible definition of the labor market.  \n\nBroadly, our contribution is to dig into the mechanisms behind monopsony power (see reviews by Manning (2021); Sokolova and Sorensen (2021)) by using an industrial organization model based on job differentiation, with detailed microdata from the most common occupations in the US. This approach adds to three other strands in the monopsony literature: general equilibrium (GE) macroeconomic models of oligopsonistic markets (Berger, Herkenhoff and Mongey, 2022), bargaining models of imperfect competition (Jarosch, Nimczik and Sorkin, 2019), and approaches based at least partly on assumptions about the production function (Yeh, Macaluso and Hershbein, 2022; Lamadon, Mogstad and Setzler, 2022). Our paper is most closely related to two other papers adopting an IO approach. A working paper by Kroft et al. (2022) looks at one industry, construction, and considers a monopsonisitically competitive model of the market for construction workers. Another working paper by Roussille and Scuderi (2022) takes an approach that is perhaps the closest to ours. They use data on full-time, high-wage engineering jobs with a discrete choice model to calculate a wage markdown. Their data from Hired.com has a number of institutional features that they exploit to obtain relatively rich estimates of both labor supply and demand without requiring an instrument.  \n\nOur data and estimation strategy make three contributions to the literature. First, we identify job differentiation using explicit choice sets for workers: that is, unlike most of the literature, we know which jobs workers are considering, and not just the jobs workers ended up taking. Among monopsony papers cited in the above paragraph, only Roussille and Scuderi (2022) have explicit data on job options. Second, we can directly identify job differentiation using our nested logit, and we identify the role of geographic distance. Our findings on geographic distance add to the literature on the role of geographic distance in explaining job applications patterns (Marinescu and Rathelot, 2018; Le Barbanchon, Rathelot and Roulet, 2021). Third, our instrumental variable approach allws us to estimate job application elasticities at the firm level and at the market level, with the market level elasticity being especially relevant for antitrust policy. The generality of our instrumental variable strategy allows us to estimate elasticities for a broad range of occupations, industries and locations, in contrast with Kroft et al. (2022) and Roussille and Scuderi (2022), who focus on more specific markets.  \n\nThe rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In section 2, we discuss the data and the estimation methods. In section 3, we present the empirical results, focusing on job differentiation and the wage elasticity of job applications. In section 4, we show how our wage elasticity of job applications can be  \n\nused to calculate the wage markdown, and we discuss the implications for antitrust policy. Finally.   \nsection 5 concludes.  \n\n### 2 Data and estimation  \n\n#### 2.1 Data  \n\nOur data includes information on unemployed job seekers, job vacancies and job seekers' applications to these vacancies on the online job board CareerBuilder.com, the largest US employment website1. This data set covers job search activity between April and June 2012 on CareerBuilder.com. We drop job seekers who do not live in the US, who live in Alaska or Puerto Rico, and job seekers whose location is unknown. This same data was used by Marinescu and Rathelot (2018), who show that it is broadly representative of vacancies and unemployed job seekers in the US.  \n\nIn order to be able to reliably estimate the value of each vacancy to job applicants, we restrict the sample to job vacancies with at least five applications. We define a labor market as an occupation at the 6-digit standard occupational class (SOC) level (for example, \"Registered Nurses\") and a commuting Zone. We then merge our application data with the data used in Azar, Marinescu and Steinbaum (2022), in order to obtain the names of the companies posting the jobs, which will be critical for our calculation of firm-level elasticities and to our instrument for the wage. As a result of the merge, the data is restricted to the SOCs used in Azar, Marinescu and Steinbaum (2022) (Table 1), which are the most common ones for job vacancies. The data contains the zip code location of job seekers and job vacancies, which allows us to calculate the geographic distance between the job seeker and the vacancy. We drop from the sample markets that did not have at least two vacancies every week during the second quarter of 2012, or for which there was no week with two vacancies in different zipcodes (otherwise, we cannot identify the distance coefficient for that market). We end up with 822 commuting zone-occupation pairs.  \n\nWe present summary statistics in Table 2. For each market in our sample between April and June 2012, there are on average 50 jobs, and 732 users collectively sending 1957 applications On average, a job seeker sends 7 applications and a job receives 39 applications.  \n\nTable 1.

Markets are indexed by m. We observe a labor market over several weeks $t$ . Market m has $N_{m}$ active users over our sample period. An active user in market $m$ is defined as anyone who has ever applied in a market in any of the 13 weeks of our data. On any given week $t_{,}$ , there is a set $\\mathcal{I}_{m t}$ of active vacancies in market m. In any given week $t,$ a worker decides to apply or not apply to market m. Choosing not to apply gives workers the value of the outside option $(j=0)$ , i.e. either applying to another SOC-6 by CZ market or not applying at all. Conditional on applying to market $m$ , the worker chooses which vacancy to apply to.3  \n\nThe utility of individual $i$ from applying to job vacancy $j\\in J_{m t}$ in week $t$ is:  \n\n$$\nu_{i j m t}=\\delta_{j}+\\gamma z_{i j m}+\\nu_{i m t}(\\lambda_{m})+\\lambda_{m}\\epsilon_{i j m t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $z_{i j m}$ is the log of the distance between the user and job vacancy $j$ All of the within-market jobs are in the same nested logit group. The only other choice in the model is to apply out of market: this is the outside option. We denote the nest with the within-market jobs as $g=1$ , and the outside option as 8 = 0.  \n\nThe utility of applying outside of the market shifts over time (to roughly capture changes in outside of market job availability) and is modeled as  \n\n$$\nu_{i o m t}=\\bar{\\delta}_{t}-\\theta\\tilde{z}_{i m}+\\epsilon_{i0m t}.\n$$  \n\nThe dummy variable $\\tilde{z}_{i m}$ equals one if the active job applicant lives inside of the market m commuting Zone. This shifter does not vary across jobs within a market, and we except that it will decrease the utility of outside-market jobs.  \n\nIn equations (1)-(2), the random utility shocks are $\\nu_{i m t}(\\lambda_{m})$ and $\\epsilon_{i j m t}$ . We assume that these random utility shocks have the appropriate distributions to generate the classic nested logit functional form, as in Cardell (1997). The term $\\epsilon_{i j m t}$ is a random \"match value\" for the match between worker $i$ and a particular job $j$ . The parameter $\\lambda_{m}$ is a market-specific nesting parameter, and $\\nu_{i m t}(\\lambda_{m})$ is a \"nested logit\" random taste that is present in the utilities for within-market job vacancies and differentiates the job vacancies in the market from the outside option.  \n\nFinally, the critical term $\\delta_{j}$ is McFadden's \"alternative-specific constant\" (or \"mean utility\") which captures the average level of utility of a job vacancy for different workers and across periods. It is defined as:  \n\n$$\n\\delta_{j}=\\beta x_{j}-\\alpha\\log w_{j}+\\xi_{j},\n$$  \n\nwhere $w_{j}$ is the wage posted by the job vacancy. The observed characteristics of the job, $x_{j},$ include log employment of the firm posting the vacancy, squared log employment, and market fixed effects. In some specifications, we also include job title fixed effects, because they are a very strong predictor of posted wages (Marinescu and Wolthoff, 2016). Following Berry (1994), we allow for an unobserved component of the mean utility of a job, $\\xi_{j}$ . This captures unobserved job attributes that are not present in the data. These could include better or worse working conditions or benefits. The unobservable may also include the perceived stringency of (unobserved to us) job qualifications. In the context of job applications, a job that is too hard to get is job that is not desirable to apply for. While there is evidence that workers indeed avoid jobs they are not qualified for (Marinescu and Wolthoff, 2016), there is no evidence that they avoid jobs with many applicants (Gee, 2018). To the extent that job seekers do not seek to avoid jobs with many applicants, they do not need to consider other job seekers' strategies when applying to a job, but can instead focus on the attributes of the job. It is natural to assume that the unobservable job attributes are correlated with the wage. For example, a firm offering good benefits and stable employment may offer lower wages, whereas jobs with stringent qualifications may have high Wages.  \n\nThe bottom level of the nested logit requires us to estimate many job fixed effects. To reduce computational burden, we estimate the lower level logit parameters, including the effect of distance on job desirability, from a purely within-market logit analysis of workers choices. Specifically, we estimate our nested logit model sequentially in two steps (see Train, 2009), with a bottom level within-market choice and top level choice of whether to apply in the market. This allows us to recover many job-specific effects. The two-step process mimics part of our informal identification argument and allows us to impose additional assumptions only as they are needed.  \n\nWe now explain the specific procedure used to estimate the bottom and top levels of the nested logit. We will then discuss the estimation of the impact of wages on job utility, which is a separate regression.  \n\n#### 2.3  Bottom level logit: choosing between jobs within a market  \n\nThe \"bottom level\" probability that user $i$ applies to job $j$ conditional to applying to a job in market m in week $t$ is  \n\n$$\ns_{i j m t\\mid g=1}=\\frac{\\exp\\left[\\left(\\delta_{j}+\\gamma z_{i j m}\\right)/\\lambda_{m}\\right]}{\\sum_{k\\in\\mathcal{I}_{m t}}\\exp\\left[\\left(\\delta_{k}+\\gamma z_{i k m}\\right)/\\lambda_{m}\\right]}.\n$$  \n\nThe data structure for this bottom level conditional logit model is as follows. First, as a reminder, only job seekers who applied at least once (in any week) in the market are retained. Then, for each application a job seeker actually sent, we construct the set of possible choices as the jobs available that Week in that market.  \n\nNote that the bottom level logit probabilities in (4) stay constant if each $\\delta_{j}$ is increased or decreased by the same amount. To deal with this, in each market define one job $j=r(m)$ as a \"reference job\". In the bottom level analysis, the desirability of each job in the market will be measured relative to this reference job. Specifically, subtracting $\\delta_{r(m)}/\\lambda_{m}$ from each of the job-fixed effects $\\delta_{j}/\\lambda_{m}$ in (4), the expression  \n\n$$\ns_{i j m t\\mid g=1}=\\frac{\\exp\\left[\\left(\\left(\\delta_{j}-\\delta_{r(m)}\\right)+\\gamma z_{i j m}\\right)/\\lambda_{m}\\right]}{\\sum_{k\\in\\mathcal{I}_{m t}}\\exp\\left[\\left(\\left(\\delta_{k}-\\delta_{r(m)}\\right)+\\gamma z_{i k m}\\right)/\\lambda_{m}\\right]}.\n$$  \n\nproduces the exact same within-market choice probabilities as the original expression (4). Note, however, that the level of $\\delta_{r(m)}/\\lambda_{m}$ does matter for the top-level probability of making a within-market application. We return to this below.  \n\nAt the bottom level, a key question is whether we need different reference jobs in each week. If we use a single reference job in each market, can we identify $\\left({\\delta_{k}-\\delta_{r(m)}}\\right)/{\\lambda_{m}}$ for jobs appearing in all weeks of the data, even if the reference job $r(m)$ and job $k$ are not active in the same week? In Appendix B, we discuss the proof that the answer is $\\prime\\prime_{\\mathrm{{yes}^{\\prime\\prime}}}$ as long as, in every week, some job persists from week $t$ to $t+1$ . We call this the \"persistent job assumption.\" The \"job that persists\" can be different for each pair of adjacent weeks in the data.  \n\nFor each market, we estimate the bottom level multinomial logit with choice probabilities given by (4) via Maximum Likelihood using the asclogit command in Stata. This produces estimates of the relative job \"fixed efects\", $\\left(\\delta_{k}-\\delta_{r(m)}\\right)/\\lambda_{m},$ for each job $j$ that appears in that market in some week, as well as the market level coefficient on $z_{i j m},\\gamma/\\lambda_{m}$  \n\nOur bottom level estimates of the relative job fixed effects are closely related to the number of applications that jobs receive on average across weeks after conditioning on distance $z_{i j m}$ . Recall that a job typically appears in the dataset in multiple weeks: a median job lasts 6 weeks, as seen in Table 2. Conceptually, our bottom level estimates take into account the fact that a job gets more applications when competing against less attractive jobs, and fewer applications when competing against more attractive jobs. Econometrically, this across-week variation aids identification of job fixed effects $\\delta_{j}/\\lambda_{m},$ as the same job is compared to different alternatives in different weeks. This across-week variation also further aids estimation by creating additional choice opportunities (effectively increasing sample size relative to the number of parameters).  \n\nThe coefficient on distance $\\gamma/\\lambda_{m}$ is identified off of variation in distance to jobs across workers: the distance of the worker from job B is naturally excluded from the worker's preference for job A. This kind of exclusion restriction is also helpful in the identification of discrete choice preferences (Lewbel (2014)  \n\nand Berry and Haile (2022)).  \n\nGiven the bottom level results, we obtain the predicted probability of choosing each vacancy conditional on applying to a job in the market, $s_{i j m t|g},$ which we willater use for elasticity calculations.  \n\nWhile the bottom level logit only takes into account competition among jobs within market $m$ the $\\lambda_{m}$ parameter takes into account competition across markets. $\\lambda_{m}$ Will be estimated from the top level of the nested logit, which we describe in the next subsection. This will then allow us to identify $\\delta_{j},\\gamma$ and $\\theta$  \n\n#### 2.4  Top level logit: choosing whether to apply to a market  \n\nThe probability of applying within market in a given week depends on the nested logit \"inclusive value\" (Train, 2009 ). This is the expected value, across the distribution of random utility shocks, of choosing the best job in the market conditional on the job fixed effects and the location of applicant. Up to a constant, the inclusive value of a within-market application is  \n\n$$\nI_{i m t}=\\log\\sum_{k\\in J_{m t}}\\exp{[(\\delta_{k}+\\gamma z_{i k m})/\\lambda_{m}]}.\n$$  \n\nWe need to account for the fact that we recover only relative job fixed effects in the bottom level logit. Rewriting the inclusive value,  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{{}}&{{I_{i m t}=\\log\\displaystyle\\sum_{k\\in J_{m t}}\\exp\\left[\\left(\\delta_{k}-\\delta_{r(m)}+\\delta_{r(m)}+\\gamma z_{i k m}\\right)/\\lambda_{m}\\right]}}\\ {{}}&{{=\\log\\displaystyle\\sum_{k\\in J_{m t}}\\exp\\left[\\delta_{r(m)}/\\lambda_{m}\\right]\\exp\\left[\\left(\\delta_{k}-\\delta_{r(m)}+\\delta_{r(m)}+\\gamma z_{i k m}\\right)/\\lambda_{m}\\right]}}\\ {{}}&{{=\\delta_{r(m)}/\\lambda_{m}+\\log\\displaystyle\\sum_{k\\in J_{m t}}\\exp\\left[\\left(\\delta_{k}-\\delta_{r(m)}+\\delta_{r(m)}+\\gamma z_{i k m}\\right)/\\lambda_{m}\\right]}}\\ {{}}&{{\\equiv\\delta_{r(m)}/\\lambda+\\bar{I}_{i m t}(z_{i m})}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe last equality defines $\\bar{I}_{i m t}(z_{i m})$ as the component of the inclusive value that we can obtain from the bottom level logit results.  \n\nThe top level probability of applying within market in week $t$ is then a simple binary logit with  \n\n$$\n\\bar{s}_{i m t}=\\frac{e^{\\lambda_{m}I_{i m t}}}{e^{\\bar{\\delta}_{t}-\\theta\\tilde{z}_{i m t}}+e^{\\lambda_{m}I_{i m t}}}.\n$$  \n\nNote that $\\lambda_{m}$ appears as a coefficient on the within-market inclusive value and that the denominator of the expression accounts for the value of the outside market option. Using (7), we can rewrite (8) as a binary logit probability of the form:  \n\n$$\n\\bar{s}_{i m t}=\\frac{e^{\\delta_{r(m)}-\\bar{\\delta}_{t}+\\theta\\tilde{z}_{i m t}+\\lambda_{m}\\bar{I}_{i m t}}}{1+e^{\\delta_{r(m)}-\\bar{\\delta}_{t}+\\theta\\tilde{z}_{i m t}+\\lambda_{m}\\bar{I}_{i m t}}}.\n$$  \n\nThis is the probability of a within-market application that we use to estimate the top level.  \n\nWe estimate this equation pooling observations from all markets; an observation is a market-week by job seeker4. The job seeker may have applied either to a vacancy in the market, or to the outside option. The estimation includes market effects, whose coefficients are $\\delta_{r(m)}$ . Thus, the top level estimation recovers the job fixed effect for the reference job in each market. We also include week fixed effects, whose coefficients are $-\\delta_{t}$ . The coefficient $\\theta$ is recovered from variation in job-seeker location (in or out of the commuting zone.)  \n\nThe coefficient on the bottom level component of the inclusive value is the nesting parameter $\\lambda_{m}$ (In our baseline model we hold $\\lambda_{m}$ fixed across markets). We then recover $\\delta_{j}$ for the non-reference jobs from our bottom level estimates of $\\left({\\delta_{j}-\\delta_{r(m)}}\\right)/{\\lambda_{m}}$ together with our top level estimates of $\\lambda_{m}$ and $\\delta_{r(m)}$ We also recover the predicted top level probability from the function $\\bar{s}_{i m t}$ evaluated with the estimated coefficients using the individual data.  \n\nOur estimation relies on two sources of variation. First, there is market-week variation in the value of applying to a market (classic panel identification for the market level panel). Second, there is variation in job valuation across workers in the same market due to distance, which leads to variation in the inclusive value within markets and across weeks: that is, workers who happen to be closer to the available jobs in a given market-week have a higher inclusive value for applying within the market. In the top level logit, the coefficient on the inclusive value (the nesting parameter) measures the impact of a higher inclusive value on the probability of applying in that market-week. While the bottom level logit takes into account within-market competition between jobs, this top level logit also takes into account competition across markets and the relative attractiveness of jobs in a market-week.  \n\nThe overall probability that user $i$ applies to job $j$ in market $m$ in week $t$ is the probability that they apply to market m (equation 9) times the probability that they apply to a particular job $j$ in that market conditional on applying in that market (equation 4),  \n\n$$\ns_{i j m t}=s_{i j m t|g=1}\\bar{s}_{i m t}.\n$$  \n\nThe expected share of applications to job vacancy $j$ in market $m$ in week $t$ is simply the average of the probabilities across job seekers:  \n\n$$\ns_{j m t}=\\frac{1}{N_{m}}\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{m}}s_{i j m t}.\n$$  \n\nSimilarly, the expected share of applications to market $m$ in week $t$ is the average of the probabilities of applying inside the market across job seekers:  \n\n$$\ns_{g m t}=\\frac{1}{N_{m}}\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{m}}s_{i g m t}.\n$$  \n\n#### 2.5  The impact of the wage on the utility of a job  \n\nAs in Berry (194), we then run a regression of the estimated job values $\\delta_{j}$ on the log wage and the number of employees of the firm and the square of the number of employees of the firm (equation 3). We do this using either OLS or, because wages are likely correlated with the unobserved job quality $\\xi_{j},$ via the use of instrumental variables for the wage. We control for job title fixed effects in some regressions.  \n\nAs explained in Berry and Haile (2021), an advantage of our worker-level application data is that we only need instruments for wages and not any additional instruments for the endogenous market shares that would appear in a market level analysis (Berry and Haile, 2014).  \n\n#### 2.6  Wage and nesting parameters flexibility  \n\nWe estimate three versions of the model, with different levels of flexibility for the wage and nesting parameters. In the first version, we treat both the wage coefficient $\\alpha$ and the nesting parameter $\\lambda$ as constant across markets. We call this version \"homogenous\", as coefficients are assumed to be the same across markets. In a second version of the model, we allow for the $\\alpha$ and $\\lambda$ parameters to be different for low-skill and high-skill occupations, and for rural and urban commuting zones. We call this version of the model \"heterogenous\". To classify occupations into low or high skill, we use wages from the Bureau of Labor Statistcs Occupational Employment Statistics (OES). In particular, we classify an occupation into the \"low-skill\" group if the mean hourly wage in 2012 for its 3-digit SOC code (minor group) in the OES is below the median across the applications in our sample (18.16 in 2012 dollars), and into the \"high-skill\" group if it is above the median. We classify a commuting zone as \"rural\" if its population density is below the median across the applications in our sample (520 people per square mile5), and \"urban\" if its population density is above the median. We call this version, with heterogeneity across two wage categories by two population density categories, the \"heterogeneous\" version of the model.  \n\nOur third version allows for the $\\alpha$ and $\\lambda$ parameters to vary freely across 6-digit SOC occupations, as well as continuously with population density (using a quadratic in population density). We call this the \"detailed\" version of the model, noting that there is not enough power to reliably estimate parameters for all markets. We will therefore only report results for this version as part of our additional results section.  \n\nIn all three versions, for the top level logit we include the following controls: a dummy for whether the applicant is in the same commuting zone as the job vacancy, market $({\\cal C}{\\cal Z}\\times\\mathrm{SOC})$ fixed effects, and year-week fixed effects.  \n\nFor the wage equation that relates the job fixed effects to job characteristics (including the wage), we include market $({\\cal C}{\\cal Z}\\times{\\cal S}{\\mathrm{OC}})$ fixed effects, firm size measured as the log number of employees, and firm size squared. In some specifications, we also include job title fixed effects.  \n\n#### 2.6.1 Instruments for the wage  \n\nSince the wage is endogenous, likely correlated with unobserved job characteristics, we need to instrument for it in the equation for job quality (eq. 3), where an observation is a job vacancy. We consider three broad strategies to construct instruments for the wage. One is to use variation in the choice set of job seekers, the so-called \"BLP\" instruments, as in Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes (1995), Nev0 (2000) and Berry and Haile (2014). Another set of instruments is based on the idea that multi-location firms may try to limit within-firm cross-location variation in wages. Reasons for this could have to do with fairness norms or with the ease of setting wage policy at the firm level. For all sets of instruments, We have to consider whether they are likely to be correlated with unobserved (to us) job characteristics.  \n\nTo construct instruments that measure the variation in possible choice sets across markets, we look at the characteristics of other job vacancies in the market, such as the number of vacancies, and the size of the other firms that post in the market. If the model is correct, these are excluded because they do not enter the formula for the utility of user $i$ for job $j$ (see Berry and Haile, 2014). One potential problem with our implementation of these instruments in the present context is that wages might be set at the level of the firm (across markets) and not respond much to local market conditions and particularly not to short term changes in these conditions. This would lead the instruments to poorly predict wages (lack relevance).  \n\nWe consider two variants of instruments based on the job characteristics: first a simple version instrumenting only with the number of vacancies in the market, and then a version instrumenting with the number of vacancies in the market, the sum across other vacancies of log employment of the posting firm, and the sum across other vacancies of the square of log employment of the posting firm.6 In the latter case, since we have more than one instrument, we estimate the equation using 2-step GMM.  \n\nOne alternative set of instruments is a variant of the \"Hausman instruments\" often used in the industrial organization literature (Hausman, Leonard and Zona, 1994). For example, the price of Cheerios in Atlanta in a given week would be instrumented by the average price of Cheerios in that week across all US cities except Atlanta. The Hausman idea of instruments based on prices in other markets relies on costs being correlated across locations, but demand shocks that are not correlated across locations. In the context of wages, the similar condition for the estimation of labor supply is that firms' within-market Wage decisions reflect a common (across markets) firm level marginal productivity (labor demand), but not common shocks to unobserved job characteristics.  \n\nAlternatively, if firms set wages with some effort to reduce cross-location wage inequality, variation in competitive labor market conditions across the markets where a firm operates can lead to correlated Wages, within-firm across markets. This will lead to other market wages that predict own-market wages but are naturally excluded from own-market labor supply decisions. DellaVigna and Gentzkow (2019) discuss and document firm level retail pricing decisions that hold prices constant across markets within firm. Similarly, there is evidence that firms pay somewhat uniform wages across labor markets within the US (Chen, 2021; Hazell, Patterson and Sarsons, 2021), and even across countries (Hjort, Li and Sarsons, 2020). Of course, the empirical relevance of other-market within-firm wages can be tested in the data.  \n\nWe adapt this idea to instrument a job vacancy's wage by using the average wage for job vacancies posted by the same firm in a given week in all other $(C Z\\times S{\\mathrm{OC}})$ markets. We also construct a variant of the instrument excluding from the calculation of the average any markets that are in the same CZ (but other SOCs) or the same SOC (but other CZs). Excluding the same CZ or same SOC makes the instrument somewhat more plausibly exogenous.  \n\nOur first version of Hausman instruments can easily be criticized on the grounds that firm level wage decisions across locations may involve simultaneous changes to unobserved benefits and working conditions. If so, a firm's wages in other locations may reflect the unobserved quality of the job in this location. We therefore use a set of instruments that go one step further, by considering not the average Wage of the firm in other markets, but the average of the underlying determinants of the wage of the firm in other markets. To implement this strategy, we first obtain predicted wages for each market by running a regression of wages on CZ-SOC fixed effects and year-week fixed effects and then obtaining the corresponding predicted values for the wages. We then take averages of the predicted wages across vacancies posted by the same firm in other markets. As with the Hausman instruments, we calculate two versions: one using the average predicted wage for vacancies by the same firm in all other CZ $\\times{\\mathrm{SOC}}$ markets, and one—plausibly more exogenous—excluding markets that are in the same CZ or the same SOC from the average predicted wage calculation. Intuitively, this third set of instruments amounts to saying that if a firm faces high-wage competition in other markets, then it also pays higher Wages in the current market. In a version of this instrument, we also exclude adjacent commuting zones, to avoid endogeneity due to geographically correlated shocks; as we will see, the results are almost the same when excluding these CZs.  \n\nOur preferred specification uses the instrument based on the average predicted wage for vacancies by the same firm in all other $\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{Z}\\times\\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{O}\\mathbf{C}$ markets excluding markets that are in the same CZ or the same SOC from the average predicted wage calculation. We also run a version of this specification with job title fixed effects, which improves the wage prediction, but also leads to very low first-stage F stats when allowing for heterogeneity in the wage coefficients (see Table 9).  \n\nOne important caveat about the instruments based on wages in other markets is that some types of firms, which hire some classes of occupations, may engage in across-location wage-setting, but in other cases firms may set wages only based on own-market conditions. Thus, our Hausman-like instruments may work better in some occupational markets than in others, a possibility that suggests further research focusing on subsets of firms and occupations where instruments can be more closely tailored to specific conditions.  \n\nOnce we obtain an estimate of the wage coefficient, We use this wage coefficient $\\alpha$ ,the estimated nesting parameter $\\lambda_{m,}$ and the predicted probabilities of application such as $S_{i j m t}$ to calculate the wage elasticity at the vacancy, market and firm level. The formulas for these elasticities are given in Appendix C.  \n\n### 3 Results  \n\n#### 3.1Nested logit results: job differentiation  \n\nOur bottom level nested logit analysis gives us the utility coefficient on the log of distance from the applicant to the job, as well as a set of job fixed effects. The distance coefficients are estimated separately for each market. Table 3 summarizes these coefficients. The distance coefficients are typically negative, as expected. Out of 822 markets, in only one case do we find a distance coefficient that is positive and significantly different from zero at the $5\\%$ level.  \n\n# Table 3. Summary statistics for the coefficient on $\\ln(d i s t)$ in the bottom level logit  \n\nThere are 822 markets in which we estimate a distance coefficient. Of these, 48 are positive with one significant at the. $5\\%$ level and an additional 3 coefficients at the $10\\%$ level. The table gives the mean, standard deviation and quartiles for the estimated coefficients and for :he standard errors and t-stats associated with those coefficients.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Mean</td><td>Sd</td><td>25%</td><td>50%</td><td>75%</td></tr><tr><td>Estimate of -0.558</td><td>1.083</td><td>-0.834</td><td>-0.544</td><td>-0.301</td></tr><tr><td>Standard Error 0.200</td><td>0.510</td><td>0.054</td><td>0.109</td><td>0.194</td></tr><tr><td>T-stat -9.621</td><td>14.894</td><td>-11.133</td><td>-4.851</td><td>-2.076</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nFigure 1 shows the relationship between the estimated distaste for distance (the negative of the distance coefficients) and log population in the home commuting zone of each market. The pattern here is clear and is economically interesting. Workers in more densely populated commuting zones are less likely to apply to jobs far away from their zip code of residence than workers in less densely populated areas. This suggests that within-commuting zone distance may offset some of the apparent job abundance that workers in densely population areas may otherwise appear to enjoy.  \n\nTable 4. Variance decomposition for the bottom level logit (equation (4)   \nIn the bottom panel, each variance is given as a proportion of the total variance of utlity given in the top panel.

At this stage we can then decompose the utility received by different job applicants, conditional on applying for a job in a given market m. Table 4 shows this variance decomposition. In the utility specification (1), note that the term $\\nu_{i m t}(\\lambda_{m})$ is constant within market while $\\lambda_{m}\\epsilon_{i j m t}$ is independent of the other terms by assumption This implies that the variance of within-market utility is decomposed as  \n\n$$\nV a r(\\delta_{j})+\\gamma^{2}V a r(z_{i j m})+\\lambda_{m}^{2}V a r(\\epsilon_{i j m t})+\\gamma C o v(\\delta_{j},z_{i j m})\n$$  \n\nWe use our estimated coefficients from the bottom level logit (equation (4) to calculate, for each market, these variance terms across all the combinations of job /worker within market.  \n\nIn Table 4, we see that, on average across markets, the job-specific fixed effect $\\delta$ accounts for $33.5\\%$ of the total utility of a job and the covariance of $\\delta_{j}$ and applicant distance to a job is low. This means that most of the variance in applicant utility is explained by job /applicant match components. Observable distance between the applicant and the job accounts for $18\\%$ of the total variance, while the remainder is accounted for by the unobserved match components.  \n\nThe results in Table 4 do not rely on any of our later assumptions about instrumental variables or labor market equilibrium. These results are strongly supportive of the idea that jobs are highly differ entiated in the eyes of job applicants: less than half of the within-market variation in applicant utility is due to the common vertical component of job desirability, with the rest due to observed and unobserved  \n\n![](images/9e09fdc631e3ccad67c8fe2bb242f4793fd75fdc879fd1f618454be306698680.jpg)  \nFigure 1. Distance coefficient by population density This figure shows a binned scatter of the median distance coefficient (whichvariesby $\\mathrm{CZ}\\times\\mathrm{SOC}$ market) by log population density. The distance coefficients are calculated using the nesting parameters from the detailed model, as the coefficients obtained from estimating the multinomial logit models in equation (3) for each market, times the corresponding nesting parameter based on the estimation of equation (4) using the detailed (i.e. most flexible)model.  \n\nworker/job interactions.  \n\nWe now turn to the results of the top level of the nested logit. This step estimates the nested parameters, $\\lambda_{m},$ that control substitution in and out of our markets. Smaller values of the parameter indicate less substitutability with jobs outside of the market. Table 5 describes the estimated nesting parameters for the homogeneous and heterogeneous models. Our preferred specification is the heterogenous model, where the nesting parameter is allowed to vary by four market types (low /high wage occupation by rural/urban commuting zone).  \n\nWe see in the heterogeneous specification of Table 5 that the estimated $\\lambda$ parameters are all in the required range of zero to one, which is not guaranteed by the method. Thus, the nested logit model is not rejected by these values. The estimated parameters are small, and in each case we can strongly reject the logit value of $\\lambda=1$ . The pattern of $\\lambda$ coefficients in the heterogeneous model suggests less substitution outside of markets in high skilled occupations and in rural areas.  \n\nThese results provide clear evidence of strong substitution within our 6-digit SOC by CZ markets, with limited substitution outside of our markets. This has implications for work that uses pure logit models of job differentiation as well as for work that uses broader definitions of labor markets. These models may be imposing, via a functional form restriction, more substitution across CZ/SOC-6 markets than is suggested by our results.  \n\nIn both specifications of Table 5, we can also reject the extreme case of $\\lambda=0$ ,which would imply no substitution outside of our markets. The coefficient $\\theta_{\\cdot}$ which captures the \"home commuting zone\" effect, is positive as expected and is precisely estimated.  \n\n# Table 5.

Tables 6 and 7 show estimates from the homogeneous model, with a single wage coefficient and a single nesting parameter across markets. In Table 6, we first report the impact of wages on the job-specific utility $\\delta_{j}$ using OLS. We control flexibly for the firm size (number of employees) since jobs offered by larger companies may be systematically different. For example, they may offer better benefits. We also control for the duration of the job listing.  \n\nIn the OLS specification, the coefficient on the log of wage in job utility is estimated to be negative and significantly different from zero (column 1). This counterintutive result is likely explained by a negative correlation between the unobserved job characteristics and the wage. This could reflect compensating differentials. Marinescu and Wolthoff (2016) suggest that it may reflect that some jobs within an SOC6 may be both high-paying and harder to obtain, and thus unattractive to job applicants who are unlikely to be hired. For example, in the accountant and auditors occupation, \"senior accountant\" job tiles pay more but receive fewer applications than \"junior accountant\" job titles. Therefore, in column 2, we control for job title fixed effects, which restores the expected positive relationship between wages and the utility of a job.  \n\nHowever, these job titles may not capture all of the relevant variation in unobserved perceived jobvacancy quality. Therefore, in the rest of Table 6, we instrument the wage with a series of different BLP style instruments, instrumenting the wage with characteristics of competing jobs. In columns 3 and 4 (without and with job title fixed effects), we instrument the wage with the number of vacancies in the market posted by competitor firms. This yields much larger wage coefficients than the OLS estimates and suggests that OLS suffers from significant downward bias. In columns 5 and 6, we add to the instrument list: instead of just the number of vacancies posted by competitors in the market, we also include the sum of the log number of employees of competitor firms, and the sum of square of the log number of employees of competitor firms. In these specifications, the wage coefficient is smaller but still much bigger than the OLS estimate. It is possible that the very high wage coefficients found when instrumenting with the number of vacancies alone are biased by the endogeneity of the number of vacancies: indeed, unlike the number of product varieties in a market, the number of vacancies can be adjusted at high frequency and is thus more likely to be endogenous. We then instrument the wage  \n\n# Table 6. Impact of wages on the utility derived from a job vacancy in the homogeneous model: OLS, BLP-style, anc Hausman-style instruments  \n\nEstimation is by OLS in the first two columns, and by 2SLS in columns (3) to (10).

Instrumenting the wage by the average wage of the firm in other markets leads to a positive estimate of the wage effect (column 7), while further controlling for job titles increases the magnitude of the estimate (column 8), just like in OLS. We then (col. 9-10) instrument the wage with the average wage of the firm in other markets, but excluding the same SOC6 and the same commuting zone. This instrument is slightly less relevant than the wages of the same firm in all other markets, but still has a high F-stat (compare columns 9-10 vs. 7-8). The wage estimates with this instrument are also positive and slightly higher in magnitude than in columns 7-8.  \n\nIn Table 7, we use Hausman-style instruments that are likely to be more exogenous. Instead of the actual wages posted by the firm itself in other markets, We use as instrument the predicted wage for the firm in other markets, either including the same CZ and same SOC (Table 7, columns 1-2) or excluding these (columns 3-4). This strategy yields higher wage coefficients than the Hausman-style instruments in Table 6 columns 7-10, but typically smaller than for the BLP style instruments in Table 6, columns  \n\n# Table 7.

Some unobserved variables may be correlated across neighboring commuting zones. Therefore, in columns 5-6, we use predicted wages, but exclude adjacent CZs. In column 7-8, we exclude both adjacent CZs and the same SOC. The wage coefficients from specifications excluding adjacent CZs are essentially the same as from the specifications that exclude the same CZ and same SOC (col. 3-4).  \n\nUsing the structure of the nested logit, we can derive the market level application elasticity, the firm level elasticity and the vacancy-level elasticity. The medians of these elasticities are all reported at the bottom of Tables 6 and 7; the median is reported because means are driven by outliers (distributions of estimates are reported for the \"detailed\" model in Figures A.3 and A.4). In all cases, the firm level elasticity is only slightly lower than the vacancy level elasticity:this is because most firms do not post multiple vacancies in the same week in the same SOC6 by commuting zone labor market. The OLS estimates in Table 6 lead to implausibly low elasticities. The IV estimates lead to a median market level elasticity between 0.09 and 1.2, and a firm level elasticity between 0.9 and 11.7. Generally, including job titles yields higher elasticity estimates, and within-market BLP instruments yield higher elasticities than Hausman-style instruments.  \n\n#### 3.3 Wage elasticities: heterogeneity  \n\nWe now allow the wage coefficients and the nesting parameters to vary across labor markets.

nesting parameters for low-skill and high-skill occupations and for urban and rural commuting zones. As before, OLS yields elasticities that are implausibly low. For the heterogeneous model, the within-market BLP style instruments have limited relevance, especially when also including job title fixed effects (see F-stat in Table 8). As noted, this may reflect the possibility that firms do not finely tune their wages to local and short-term variations in workers choice sets (a possibility that also seems relevant to the competition tests in Roussille and Scuderi (2022)).) The Hausman style instruments (Table 9, col. 7-10 and Table 9) are more relevant, but the F-stats are perhaps troubling for specifications with job title fixed effects. In terms of the magnitudes of the elasticity estimates, the Hausman style instruments yield similar magnitudes to those in Table 6, col. 7-10, and 7.  \n\nOur preferred estimates of the market and firm level elasticities of job specific-utilities with respect to Wages are to be found in column 7 of Table 9, instrumenting the wage with the average predicted wage of the same firm in other markets, and excluding same or adjacent CZ and same SOC. For our preferred estimates, the median market level elasticity is 0.265 and the median firm level elasticity is 2.396. These results allow the flexibility of our heterogeneous model, while avoiding the possible problems suggested by the relatively low F-stat of the column 8 results with job fixed effects.  \n\nHow do elasticities differ between low and high skill occupations and between urban and rural commuting zones? Figures 2 and 3 report elasticities from our preferred specification. It is clear that rural commuting zones have lower market and firm level elasticities than urban commuting zones, both for low and high skilled occupations. These lower elasticities may reflect lower job opportunities in less densely populated areas and is consistent with reduced-form elasticity estimates in Azar, Marinescu and Steinbaum (2019). On the other hand, differences in elasticities between low and high skilled occupations are very small for firm level elasticities, while low skill occupations have higher market level elasticities than high skill occupations.  \n\nBased on Figures 2 and 3, we conclude that rural commuting zones have lower elasticities than urban commuting zones. Low and high skill workers have similar elasticities. We cannot blindly assume that low skill workers can more easily move to other jobs because specific skills do not matter. Therefore, there is no strong reason to believe that a SOC-6 by commuting zone market definition is decidedly too narrow for low skill as opposed to high skill workers (as we will see, using the \"detailed\" model with even more flexible parameter estimates leads to lower market level elasticities for low skill jobs in appendix Figure A.1).  \n\n# Table 9.

Removing the within-market distance (appendix Tables A.1 and A.2), or both the within market and the \"same CZ\" dummy (appendix Tables A.3 and A.4) does not materially affect the median elasticities of applications with respect to wages in the heterogenous model, especially when focusing on our preferred instrument, i.e. the average predicted wage of same firm in other markets (excluding same or adjacent CZ and same SOC).  \n\n![](images/fd6cfdea4b9b0b3035ee4da6a6303bacdecabc63150205c38e4a32a7228397cc.jpg)  \nFigure 3. Distribution of Firm Level Elasticities by Rural-Urban and Skill Classification This figure shows the median firm level elasticity of applications by low /high skill level, and by urban-rural classification for our \"Heterogeneous Model\". The heterogeneous model allows for heterogeneity in the wage and nesting parameters by low /high skill level, and by urban-rural classification. The results are for the specification that includes only $\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{Z}\\times\\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{O}\\mathbf{C}$ fixed effects, and instruments the wage using the average predicted wage of the same firm in other markets (excluding the same $\\mathrm{CZ,}$ adjacent CZ, and same SOC). The interactions of the wage are instrumented using interactions of the average predicted wage for the same firm in other markets, interacted with the corresponding variables.  \n\nIn appendix Table A.5, we perform a series of robustness tests using variations on our baseline preferred specification (Table 9, col. 7). As a reminder, our baseline specifications allows for different wage coefficients for low and high skill, and for urban and rural. The instrument for the wage is always the average predicted wage of the same firm in other markets (excluding the same $\\mathrm{CZ},$ adjacent $\\mathbf{CZ},$ and sameSoc).  \n\nFirst, we investigate the robustness of our results to controlling for log (employment), i.e. firm size. Our dependent variable, the job specific utility, is a rescaling of job applications through our nested logit model, and job applications are related to the change in employment. Therefore, including a control for the level of employment seems reasonable, and may help pick up differences in e.g. working conditions across firms. Nevertheless, for completeness, We check the robustness of our results to different ways of controlling for firm size. If we include a linear control for firm employment (size) (Table A.5, col. 2) instead of a quadratic, the elasticities are a bit smaller, but in the same ballpark as in our baseline specification. The coefficient on firm size is negative and significant, suggesting that, conditional on the wage, large firms are less desirable places to work at. If we remove any control for firm size (col. 3), estimates of the elasticities are much smaller: the market level elasticity is 0.2 instead of 0.27, and the firm level elasticity is 1.74 instead of 2.4. The smaller estimate for the elasticity makes sense from a statistical perspective: since larger firms pay more and are less desirable, not controlling for firm size reduces the coefficient on the wage, and therefore the elasticities. Since there is no decisive argument for or against including log employment as a control, we decided to include it in our baseline specification, which gives a more conservative estimate (higher elasticity) for the amount of monopsony power.  \n\nSecond, we investigate robustness to restricting the sample to jobs that receive a minimum of five applications, which was necessary to allow for a meaningful estimation of job fixed effects. If we instead restrict to jobs that receive at least three applications (Table A.5, col. 4), the sample size increases by $36\\%$ and the elasticities decline somewhat. If instead we use a more restrictive criterion of eight applications (col. 5), the elasticities are almost the same if a bit larger than at baseline. Overall, results are fairly robust to different thresholds for the number of job applications required for sample inclusion. Relative to a lower threshold of thre, our choice of five applications leads to relatively more conservative estimates (higher elasticities) for the extent of monopsony power.  \n\n#### 3.4.2 Additional results: more heterogeneity with the detailed model  \n\nIn our analysis so far, in the heterogeneous model, we have allowed for different elasticities for rural and urban, and for high and low skill jobs. We now show additional results from an even more flexible model, the \"detailed\" model, which allows for different wage coefficients and nesting parameters by SOC-6 occupation and by (a quadratic in) population density. This model allows for more detailed results, but at the cost of a lack of power that leads to extreme elasticity estimates for some markets (appendix Table A.6).  \n\nAt the top level of the nested logit estimation, the detailed model produces results that are quite similar to Table 5. The predicted nesting parameters, $\\lambda_{m},$ from this specification have a mean very close to the simpler specifications, with a mean of 0.145 and a standard deviation across markets of 0.08. A few predicted $\\lambda_{m}$ values are slightly below zero, with a minimum of -0.057. The maximum predicted $\\lambda$ is 0.428. The coefficient on within commuting zone applications, $\\theta,$ in this specification is also very similar to the $\\theta$ estimated in the simpler specifications. We regard these results as good evidence of robustness to greater heterogeneity in estimates of $\\lambda_{m}$  \n\nTurning to the results of the wage regression, the median elasticity estimates of the detailed model are very close to the median elasticity estimates of the heterogeneous model. With the detailed model like with the heterogeneous model, rural commuting zones have lower elasticities than urban commuting zones (appendix Figures A.1 and A.2). One difference between the detailed and the heterogeneous model is that, in the detailed model, there is almost no difference in the market level elasticities of low and high skill SOCs in urban areas, while in the heterogenous model high skill SOCs had a lower elasticity than low skill SOCs. Therefore, the differences between low and high skill markets may in fact be fairly small.  \n\nIn appendix Figures A.3 and A.4, we show the range of elasticity estimates for each SOC-6 for the detailed model (see appendix Tables A.7 and A.8 for summary statistics on the elasticities by occupation). The Figures exclude two outlier occupations—\"Light Truck or Delivery Service Drivers\" and \"other\" small occupations. The estimated light truck elasticity is extremely negative while the \"other\" elasticity is extremely positive. These outliers speak against using the detailed model for any serious counterfac  \n\ntuals.  \n\nBroadly, in the detailed model most occupations have positive median elasticities, but there are a few occupations with negative median elasticities. While a negative elasticity is implausible, such negative estimates are likely to occur when we slice the data finely; for example, Farber (2015) finds negative labor supply elasticities for some individual taxi drivers. Rankings of occupations by market level elasticities are similar but not identical to rankings by firm level elasticities. For market level elasticities (Figure A.3), sales, wholesale, and manufacturing related jobs have the highest elasticity, with a median slightly above 0.5. Registered nurses have a low elasticity, suggesting there are few suitable job substitutes for registered nurses in other labor markets (other occupation and/or other commuting zone). For firm level elasticities (Figure A.4), administrative asstant types of occupations occupy the top three spots for the most elastic, suggesting that these types of jobs tend to be more substitutes for each other within their market than other types of jobs. At the bottom of the firm elasticity scale are industrial engineers, who also had the second lowest market level elasticity.  \n\nIn appendix Figure A.5, we plot the median market level elasticity from the detailed model as a function of the population density. Market-level elasticities increase with population density, especially when log population density is above 6.5, i.e. population density is above 665 per square mile; remember that the density threshold that is part of the definition of an urbanized commuting zone is 1000. So the median market level elasticity increases particularly fast with population density once we move into more urbanized commuting zones. Still, even in the most densely populated commuting zones, the market level elasticity is only 1.2.  \n\n### 4  Implications for the labor supply elasticity and antitrust policy  \n\n#### 4.1  From the application elasticity to the labor supply elasticity  \n\nOur econometric model gives us an estimate of the elasticity of job application with respect to wages. How does that translate into an elasticity of firm employment with respect to wages, i.e. a labor supply elasticity? We will use two approximations to calculate the labor supply elasticity based on our estimated application elasticity: (i) the labor supply elasticity is roughly equal twice the recruitment elasticity (increase in hires in response to an increase in wages), and (i) the application elasticity is  \n\nroughly equal to the recruitment elasticity.  \n\nThe first assumption, that the labor supply elasticity is roughly equal twice the recruitment elasticity is discussed in Manning (2011). Let $R(w)$ be the number of new hires (recruitment) as a function of the wage, and let $s(w)$ be the number of separations as a function of the wage. If a firm's employment level $N(w)$ does not change (steady state), we must have $N(w)=R(w)/s(w).$ and this implies that the labor supply elasticity $\\epsilon$ is $\\epsilon=\\epsilon_{R w}-\\epsilon_{s w},$ where $\\epsilon_{R w}$ is the recruitment elasticity and $\\epsilon_{s w}$ is the separation elasticity. If $\\epsilon_{R w}\\approx-\\epsilon_{s w},$ then $\\epsilon\\approx2\\epsilon_{R w}$ . This rough equality between the recruitment and the separation elasticity is supported by empirical evidence: Dube et al. (2020) use their own estimates and other estimates from the literature to show that the recruitment elasticity (Horton, Rand and Zeckhauser, 2011) and the separation elasticity (Ho et al., 2016; Hsieh and Kocielnik, 2016; Yin, Suri and Gray, 2018) are very close to each other.  \n\nThe second assumption - that the wage elasticity of applications is the same as the wage elasticity of hiring - cannot be checked directly in our data. An increase in the offered wage for a given job might attract more qualified applicants and so increase the application rate of qualified applicants. This suggests that the hiring elasticity might be higher than the application elasticity. On the other hand, a higher wage might atract a broader pool of less qualified applicants who decide that the higher wage offsets a low probability of a job offer. By itself, this effect leads to a wage elasticity that is lower than the application elasticity.  \n\nWhile our data cannot speak directly to this issue, we can compare existing estimates of the application elasticity with estimates of the hiring elasticity. Dube et al. (2020) and Manning (2011) report estimates of the recruitment and the separation elasticities, and they are typically between O and 2, which is consistent with our application elasticity estimates as well as those of Marinescu and Wolthoff (2016). In Dal B6, Finan and Rossi (2013), the application elasticity is 0.8, and it is close to the conversion elasticity (i.e. the increase in the probability that the person initially offered the job accepts it), which is 1.07.  \n\nOverall, while the evidence is not overwhelming, it seems reasonable for illustrative purposes to assume that the application elasticity is roughly equal to the hiring elasticity, which is equal to half of the labor supply elasticity. Under these assumptions, we can calculate the labor supply elasticity by multiplying our estimated application elasticities by two.  \n\nUnder this assumption, we can calculate the markdown using our estimates of the wage elasticity of applications. Based on our preferred specification 7 from Table 9, the median markdown is 0.21, implying that workers' marginal productivity is about $21\\%$ higher than their wages. Overall, our results show that, even in the largest occupations and therefore arguably most competitive labor markets, wage markdowns are substantial, with a median of $21\\%$  \n\n#### 4.2  From labor supply elasticities to market definition  \n\nAs a further illustrative exercise, we discuss the implications of our estimates for labor market definition. We first summarize here the critical elasticity test as applied to labor markets, borrowing from (Azar et al., 2020). Since 1982, the horizontal merger guidelines have included the hypothetical mo nopolist test to determine whether a product market could be profitably monopolized. The idea of the hypothetical monopolist test is to use as the relevant antitrust market the smallest market for which a hypothetical monopolist that controlled that market would find it profitable to implement a \"small significant non-transitory increase in price\" (SSNIP).  \n\nIn the 1982 horizontal merger guidelines, there were no specific instructions about how this SSNIP test could be applied, but an influential paper soon defined a methodology (Harris and Simons, 1991): critical loss analysis. Analogously, the hypothetical monopsonist test would suggest as the relevant antitrust market the smallest labor market for which a hypothetical monopsonist that controlled that labor market would find profitable to implement \"small significant non-transitory reduction in wages\" (SSNRW).  \n\nConsider a simple model of monopsony, with a constant value of marginal product of labor given by $^{a,}$ awage $w$ which depends on the employment level of the monopsonist $L$ . The profits of the monopsonistare  \n\n$$\n\\pi(L)=(a-w)L.\n$$  \n\nIf the monopsonist changes wages by $\\Delta w_{.}$ and this generates a change in labor supply $\\Delta L,$ the change in profits is  \n\n$$\n\\Delta\\pi=\\Delta L\\times(a-w-\\Delta w)-\\Delta w\\times L.\n$$  \n\nThus, the SSNRW is profitable for the monopsonist if and only if  \n\n$$\n\\Delta L\\times(a-w-\\Delta w)>\\Delta w\\times L.\n$$  \n\nDividing on both sides by $w L$ ,we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta L}{L}\\times\\left(\\underbrace{\\frac{a-w}{w}}_{\\mathrm{Markdown}\\mu}-\\frac{\\Delta w}{w}\\right)>\\frac{\\Delta w}{w}.\n$$  \n\nRearranging terms (and taking into account that the change in wage is negative, which changes the direction of the inequality):  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta L/L}{\\Delta w/w}<\\frac{1}{\\mu-\\Delta w/w}.\n$$  \n\nSince the left-hand side is approximately the elasticity of labor supply, which we denote $\\eta.$ Wehave that the critical elasticity (see Harris and Simons (1991) for the corresponding concept in the product market) for the wage reduction to increase profits is:  \n\n$$\n\\eta\\approx\\frac{1}{\\mu-\\Delta w/w}.\n$$  \n\nThe antitrust practice typically considers a $5\\%$ increase in price (for at least a year) as the SSNIP. Therefore, we will consider a $5\\%$ \"small significant non-transitory reduction in wages\" (SSNRW). The market is too broad if the actual labor supply elasticity is less than the critical elasticity. This ends our summary of the SSNRW; we now discuss how it applies to our estimates.  \n\nIf we have data on the firm level and the market level elasticity, then the inverse firm level elasticity can be used to estimate $\\mu$ (by the Lerner rule), and the market level elasticity can be used to estimate $\\eta$ It is clear that the hypothetical monopsonist would face the market level elasticity. But is it incoherent then to estimate $\\mu$ from the firm level elasticity of a non-monopsonist? It would be if we were talking about the monopsony profit-maximizing, because then the markdown should be $1/\\eta$ .However, we are merely asking if profit would increase from the status quo of the non-monopsonist.  \n\nBased on our estimates in Figure A.3, we can perform the hypothetical monopsonist test for each occupation. We calculate the median market level labor supply elasticity as $^{2*}$ median market level elasticity.  \n\nThe market level elasticity is smaller than the critical elasticity for all occupations, indicating that the hypothetical monopsonist in the median CZ times SOC6 market would find it profitable to decrease wages by $5\\%$  \n\n### 5 Conclusion  \n\nUsing data from a large online job board, we estimate the wage elasticity of applications at the vacancy-level, firm level, and at the market level where a labor market is defined by a SOC-6 occupation and a commuting zone. We estimate workers' choice among differentiated jobs using a nested logit model.  \n\nOur results provide some of the first direct evidence on the nature and extent of job differentiation across a wide range of occupations and locales.  \n\nOur nested logit estimates show that jobs are significantly differentiated both within and across SOC6 by CZ labor markets. The geographic distance between the job and the job seeker plays an important role in job differentiation, as workers are less likely to apply to far away jobs within their commuting zone, and much less so to jobs outside their commuting zone. We can decisively reject pure logit models of job differentiation. A variance decomposition shows that the majority of within-market variance in job applicant utility is driven by horizontal factors, as opposed to vertical job quality (including the Wage).  \n\nOur results show the importance of accounting for the econometric endogeneity of wages. Results that do not acount for endogeneity imply application supply curves that are flat or even downward sloping in wages. A series of instrumental variable estimators yield fairly consistent results. Our preferred specification uses as an instrument the competitive effect of predicted wages paid by other firms in other markets. In these results, the firm level application elasticity is 2.4, which is only slightly lower than the vacancy-level elasticity. The market level application elasticity is 0.26. Multiplying these elasticities by two, we obtain a rough estimate of the labor supply elasticity. Our elasticity estimates also allow us to determine that a hypothetical monopsonist would find it profitable to decrease wages by $5\\%$ is most markets, implying that most occupations at the SOC-6 level are relevant antitrust markets. Under some assumptions on wage setting and on the relationship between vacancy elasticities and worker supply elasticities, our findings imply that the median wage markdown is 0.21, meaning that workers' productivity is $21\\%$ greater than their wages, indicating substantial employer market power.  \n\n## References  \n\nAzar, José, Ioana Marinescu, and Marshall Steinbaum. 2019. \"Measuring Labor Market Power Two Ways.\" AEA Papers and Proceedings, 109: 317-321.   \nAzar, Jose, Ioana Marinescu, and Marshall Steinbaum. 2022. \"Labor Market Concentration.\" Journal of Human Resources, 57(S): S167-S199.

We need to assume that, in every week, some job persists from week $t$ to $t+1$ We call this the \"persistent job assumption.\" The \"job that persists\" can be different for each pair of adjacent weeks in the data. This assumption is satisfied in our data for almost all markets.  \n\nAssume WLOG that the reference job $r(m)$ is present in the first week of the data. If we used only that first week in our analysis, as long as there is variation in $z_{i k}$ across jobs, we can then identify $\\gamma/\\lambda_{m}$ plus $\\left(\\delta_{k}-\\delta_{j}\\right)/\\lambda_{m}$ for every job $k\\neq r(m)$ that is posted in market m in week 1. Now let us consider identification of the $\\delta_{k}/\\lambda_{m}$ for jobs that appear in week 2 but not week 1. Critically, assume that at least one job persists from week 1 into week 2. For purposes of identification, we can hold this persistent job's value of $\\big(\\delta_{j}-\\delta_{r(m)}\\big)/\\lambda_{m}$ fixed at the value we identified from the week one data. All other week 2 values of $\\big(\\delta_{k}-\\delta_{r(m)}\\big)/\\lambda_{m}$ can then be identified. The argument of this paragraph can then be repeated for each pair of adjacent weeks in the data.  \n\nWe have now shown that each $\\big(\\delta_{k}-\\delta_{r(m)}\\big)/\\lambda_{m}$ can be identified under the \"persistent jobs assumption.\" This assumption allows us to measure all job effects $\\delta_{k}/\\lambda_{m}$ relative to a single job's $\\delta_{r(m)}/\\lambda_{m}$ . In contrast, if no job ever persisted across weeks we could only identify $\\left(\\delta_{k}-\\delta_{j}\\right)/\\lambda_{m}$ for a different $j$ in each week.  \n\nNote that in our estimation procedure, we do not use the exact analog of this identification result. Given that the overlapping jobs condition is met, it is more efficient to use all weeks of data to estimate all the (relative) job fixed effects in the market.  \n\n### C Elasticity Formulas  \n\nWe use the estimated nesting parameter $\\lambda_{m},$ wage coefficient $\\alpha$ , and the predicted probabilities of application such as $S_{i j m t}$ to calculate the wage elasticity at the vacancy, market and firm level.  \n\nVacancy-Level Elasticities  The slope of the probability that user $i$ applies to job vacancy $j$ inweek $t$ with respect to the utility of job vacancy $j$  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial s_{i j m t}}{\\partial\\delta_{j}}=s_{i j m t}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{m}}-\\frac{1-\\lambda_{m}}{\\lambda_{m}}s_{i j m t|g}-s_{i j m t}\\right).\n$$  \n\nThe slope of the probability that user $i$ applies to job vacancy $j$ in week $t$ With respect to the utility of job vacancy $k\\neq j$ is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial s_{i j m t}}{\\partial\\delta_{k}}=-s_{i j m t}\\left(\\frac{1-\\lambda_{m}}{\\lambda_{m}}s_{i k m t|g}+s_{i k m t}\\right).\n$$  \n\nThe slopes of the expected shares are the averages of the slopes across users:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial s_{j m t}}{\\partial\\delta_{k}}=\\frac{1}{N_{m}}\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{m}}\\frac{\\partial s_{i j m t}}{\\partial\\delta_{k}}.\n$$  \n\nThe general formula for the elasticity of the share of job vacancy $j$ in week $t$ with respect to vacancy $k^{\\prime}$ s(where $k=j$ or $k\\neq j$ wage is:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\log s_{j m t}}{\\partial\\log w_{k}}=\\frac{\\alpha}{s_{j m t}}\\cdot\\frac{\\partial s_{j m t}}{\\partial\\delta_{k}}.\n$$  \n\nThe elasticity of the share of job vacancy $j$ in week $t$ with respect to vacancy $j^{\\prime}$ s own wage is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\log s_{j m t}}{\\partial\\log w_{k}}=\\frac{\\alpha}{s_{j m t}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{N_{m}}\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{m}}s_{i j m t}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{m}}-\\frac{1-\\lambda_{m}}{\\lambda_{m}}s_{i j m t\\mid g}-s_{i j m t}\\right)\n$$  \n\nThe elasticity of the share of job vacancy $j$ in week $t$ with respect to vacancy $k,k\\neq j^{\\prime}$ s wage is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\log s_{j m t}}{\\partial\\log w_{k}}=\\frac{\\alpha}{s_{j m t}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{N_{m}}\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{m}}-s_{i j m t}\\left(\\frac{1-\\lambda_{m}}{\\lambda_{m}}s_{i k m t\\mid g}+s_{i k m t}\\right)\n$$  \n\nMarket Level Elasticities The slope of the probability that user $i$ applies to nest $g=1$ in week $t$ With respect to the inclusive value is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial s_{i g m t}}{\\partial I_{i m t}}=\\lambda_{m}s_{i g m t}(1-s_{i g m t}).\n$$  \n\nThe slope of the inclusive value with respect to the log wage of job vacancy $k$ is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial I_{i m t}}{\\partial\\log w_{k}}=\\frac{\\alpha}{\\lambda_{m}}s_{i k m t|g}.\n$$  \n\nCombining the last two equations, the slope of the probability that user $i$ applies to nest $g=1$ With respect to the log wage of job vacancy $k$ is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial s_{i g m t}}{\\partial\\log w_{k}}=\\alpha s_{i k m t}(1-s_{i g m t}).\n$$  \n\nThe total slope of user $i^{\\prime}\\mathsf{s}$ probability of applying to the inside nest with respect to the log wage of all vacancies inside the market is  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{k\\in J_{m t}}\\frac{\\partial s_{i g m t}}{\\partial\\log w_{k}}=\\alpha s_{i g m t}(1-s_{i g m t}).\n$$  \n\nThe total slope of the expected share of the inside nest with respect to the log wage of all vacancies inside the market is  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{k\\in J_{m t}}\\frac{\\partial s_{g m t}}{\\partial\\log w_{k}}=\\alpha\\frac{1}{N_{m}}\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{m}}s_{i g m t}(1-s_{i g m t}).\n$$  \n\nThe total elasticity of the expected share with respect to the wages of all vacancies in the market is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{s_{g m t}}\\sum_{k\\in J_{m t}}\\frac{\\partial s_{g m t}}{\\partial\\log w_{k}}=\\frac{\\alpha}{s_{g m t}}\\frac{1}{N_{m}}\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{m}}s_{i g m t}(1-s_{i g m t}).\n$$  \n\nFirm level Elasticities There are F firms.

Introduction  \n\nThere is growing concern about increasing market concentration and its potential effects on the economy, including increases in markups (De Loecker and Eeckhout 2017) and the decline in the labor share (Autor et al. 2020; Barkai 2020). Concerns about a lack of competition in the labor market have also reached the policy debate (CEA 2016). While interest in monopsony has grown in recent years (Ashenfelter, Farber, and Ransom 2010; Manning 2011; Staiger, Spetz and Phibbs 2010; Falch 2010; Ransom and Sims 2010; Matsudaira 2013), this empirical work has generally focused on particular labor markets. Therefore, it is not clear how widespread labor market power truly is and how much it affects wages.  \n\nIn this work, we approach this question by directly quantifying the level of labor market concentration across a range of occupations and for almost every commuting zone in the United States. In summary, we find that labor market concentration in the average market is high, and higher concentration is associated with significantly lower posted wages. Given high concentration, mergers of employers have the potential to significantly increase labor market power. This type of analysis could be used by antitrust agencies to assess whether mergers can create anticompetitive effects in labor markets.  \n\nWe measure labor market concentration using traditional measures such as the Herfindahl- Hirschman index (HHI). In principle, the same analysis of concentration applies to seller and buyer power, as the horizontal merger guidelines state: \\*“To evaluate whether a merger is likely to enhance market power on the buying side of the market, the Agencies employ essentially the framework described above for evaluating whether a merger is likely to enhance market power on the selling side of the market.?\" The buying side of the market refers to inputs markets, including the labor market. Therefore, a merger can be said to enhance market power if it results in a high level of concentration in specific labor markets.  \n\nHowever, it is important to keep in mind that labor markets have particular characteristics that make them different from a typical product market. For example, even if several jobs are posted in a market, a job-seeker needs to be offered the job in order to take it, while a consumer can choose which beer brand to purchase at the grocery store without any such restriction. These differences between product and labor markets mean that the thresholds in the merger guidelines that were devised with a typical product market in mind may need to be modified to use in labor market applications.  \n\nTo calculate market shares in geographic and occupational labor markets, we use data from CareerBuilder.com, the largest online job board in the United States, matching millions of workers and firms. We calculate vacancy shares and HHIs of market concentration for more than 8,ooo labor markets, defined by a combination of occupation at the SOC-6 level and commuting zone. The occupations we cover include the most frequent occupations among CareerBuilder vacancies, plus the top occupations in manufacturing and construction. We show that, on average, labor markets are highly concentrated: the average HHI is 3,157, which is the equivalent of 3.2 recruiting firms with equal shares of the total vacancy pool. An HHI of 3,157 is above the 2,500 threshold for high concentration according to the Department of Justice-Federal Trade Commission (DOJ-FTC) horizontal merger guidelines. Concentration varies by occupation and city, with larger cities being less concentrated.  \n\nWe document a negative correlation between labor market concentration and average posted wages in that market. Labor productivity is the key confound when estimating the equilibrium relationship between wages and concentration: when concentration increases, do wages decrease because of greater exploitation or because productivity itself declined? We run both ordinary least squares (OLS) and instrumental variables (IV) regressions of posted wages on concentration at the market level (HHI), using quarterly panel data from 2010-2013. Our instrument for the IV specification is the inverse number of posting employers in other geographic markets for the same occupation in a given quarter. This instrument uses variation in market concentration that is driven by national-level changes in occupational hiring over time, and not by potentially endogenous changes in productivity within a particular local market.  \n\nThe OLS and IV results are qualitatively similar, but quantitatively the instrumented estimates are much larger. In the baseline IV specification, the elasticity of the real wage with respect to the HHI is $-0.127$ , while in the baseline OLS specification the elasticity is -0.038. Going from the 25th to the 75th level of concentration decreases posted wages by 17 percent in the baseline IV specification and by 5 percent in the baseline OLS specifications. The instrument we use may not be fully exogenous. Therefore, we allow departures from full exogeneity (Conley, Hansen and Rossi 2010)—we find that the second-stage estimate of the impact of HHI on wages is bounded away from zero as long as the direct (endogenous) effect of the instrument on wages is not more than 75 percent of the reduced form effect. We thus show that the negative effect of HHI on wages is robust even for large departures from exogeneity.  \n\nOne might be concerned that the impact of concentration on posted wages is endogenous due to the relationship between the number of vacancies and concentration. The sign of the bias could be positive or negative. A decrease in labor demand can lower wages and the number of firms hiring in the market, leading to higher concentration; a decrease in labor supply can increase wages, and lower the number of firms hiring, also leading to higher concentration. To alleviate this concern, we control for labor market tightness, defined as vacancies/applications, as well as for the number of vacancies itself. We find that the negative effect of concentration on wages is essentially unchanged. Overall, our results are consistent with labor market concentration creating labor market power and hence putting downward pressure on wages.  \n\nWe perform a number of additional robustness checks. Most importantly, Marinescu and Wolthoff (2020) show that posted wages are largely explained by job titles. Therefore, it is important to control for heterogeneity by job title to get an estimate of the impact of concentration on wages for a given job type. When we control for job titles, the effect of concentration on wages is still highly significant and negative but smaller, suggesting that concentration may change the composition of jobs toward lower paying jobs. We also use alternative measures of labor market concentration, such as the inverse of the number of hiring firms, or market concentration as measured by the number of applications. These alternative measures also yield a negative and highly significant impact of labor market concentration on posted wages.  \n\nThis work provides for the first time to our knowledge a measure of labor market concentration for many of the largest labor markets in the United States. Our measure of concentration is distinct from the industry concentration measures used by Autor et al. (2020) and Barkai (2020); it is based on concentration in the labor market rather than concentration in the product market.1 Our contribution is therefore complementary. While those authors show that product market concentration is associated with a lower labor share, we show that labor market concentration is associated with lower posted wages.  \n\nThe papers that come closest to ours in approach are Benmelech, Bergman, and Kim (2022) and Rinz (2022), which build on the present article by studying concentration of employment in labor markets defined by geography and industry, using Census data on employment by firms and establishments.  \n\nThe monopsony literature in labor economics approaches the issue of market power through exploring questions such as the impact of the minimum wage and unionization. This literature focuses on the elasticity of labor supply to the individual firm, as opposed to market concentration.2 In such “new monopsony” models, employers trade off wages with their employees? quit rates, and they face an upward-sloping supply curve due to search frictions, firm-specific amenities, and limited geographic mobility of workers, in addition to other mechanisms. If workers have a high labor supply elasticity, then firms pay them more to get them to stay. The literature generally finds low elasticities of labor supply and interprets this as evidence for firm-level monopsony power to reduce wages below the marginal product of labor (Webber 2015; Dube et al. 2020).  \n\nOur approach is complementary to this literature, but with a different mechanism at play. We measure market-level concentration in local and occupational labor markets, implicitly arising from restrictions to employer entry or other characteristics of firms or industries, as opposed to characteristics of workers. In our framework, firms pay higher wages if the labor market is unconcentrated and workers can expect abundant job offers from competing employers.  \n\nBuyer-side market power caused by concentration and the upward-sloping firm-level labor supply curve are mutually reinforcing mechanisms for monopsony power and for the empirical findings from the aforementioned labor literature, such as the small effect of minimum wage increases on employment (see Azar et al. 2019).  \n\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the data and our measure of labor market concentration. Section MI analyzes the relationship between labor market concentration and posted wages. Section IV performs robustness tests and addresses remaining limitations. Finally, Section V concludes.  \n\n## I1. Measuring Labor Market Concentration  \n\n### A. Data  \n\nWe use proprietary data from CareerBuilder, which is the largest online job board in the United States. The site received approximately 11 million unique job-seeker visits in January 2011. Job-seekers can use the site for free, while firms seeking to hire workers must pay a fee of several hundred dollars to post a job opening for one month. According to CareerBuilder rules, a job posting corresponds to one vacancy, but in practice employers may sometimes hire more than one worker for a given job posting. In what follows, we refer to job postings and vacancies interchangeably. The total number of vacancies on CareerBuilder.com represents 35 percent of the total number of vacancies in the United States in January 2011 as counted in the Job Openings and Labor Turnover  \n\nTable 1 List of Occupations   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>SOC Code</td><td>Occupation Description</td></tr><tr><td>11-3011</td><td>Administrative services managers</td></tr><tr><td>13-2011</td><td>Accountants and auditors</td></tr><tr><td>13-2051</td><td>Financial analysts</td></tr><tr><td>13-2052</td><td>Personal financial advisers</td></tr><tr><td>13-2053</td><td>Insurance underwriters</td></tr><tr><td>13-2061</td><td>Financial examiners</td></tr><tr><td>15-1041</td><td>Computer support specialists</td></tr><tr><td>17-2111</td><td>Health and safety engineers, except mining safety engineers</td></tr><tr><td>17-2112</td><td>and inspectors Industrial engineers</td></tr><tr><td>29-1111</td><td>Registered nurses</td></tr><tr><td>41-4011</td><td>Sales representatives, wholesale & manufacturing, technical & scientific products</td></tr><tr><td>41-9041</td><td>Telemarketers</td></tr><tr><td>43-3031</td><td>Bookkeeping, accounting, and auditing clerks</td></tr><tr><td>43-4051</td><td>Customer service representatives</td></tr><tr><td>43-6011</td><td>Executive secretaries and administrative assistants</td></tr><tr><td>43-6012</td><td>Legal secretaries</td></tr><tr><td>43-6013</td><td>Medical secretaries</td></tr><tr><td>43-6014</td><td>Secretaries and administrative assistants, except legal, medical, and executive</td></tr><tr><td>47-1011</td><td>First-line supervisors of construction trades and extraction workers</td></tr><tr><td>49-3041</td><td>Farm equipment mechanics</td></tr><tr><td>49-3042</td><td>Mobile heavy equipment mechanics, except engines</td></tr><tr><td>49-3043</td><td>Rail car repairers</td></tr><tr><td>51-1011</td><td>First-line supervisors/managers of production and operating workers</td></tr><tr><td>53-3031</td><td>Driver/salesworkers</td></tr><tr><td>53-3032</td><td>Truck drivers,heavy and tractor-trailer</td></tr><tr><td>53-3033</td><td>Light truck or delivery services drivers</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: This table shows the six-digit SOC occupations present in our sample.  \n\nSurvey. The data set used here was first used in Davis and Marinescu (2017). Occupations were selected based on counts of jobs posted between 2009 and 2012 on CareerBuilder: at the broad SOC level, that is, SOC-5 digits, the 13 most frequent occupations were selected. We also added the three most frequent occupations in manufacturing and construction (17-2110, 47-1010, 51-1010). The full list of S0C-6 occupations can be found in Table 1; the total number is 26 because each SOC-5 may correspond to a couple of SOC-6 occupations, such as Legal Secretaries (43-6012) and Medical Secretaries (43-6013).  \n\n![](images/05dc84b73b6266e883f6fd4f6329f7203905ab8554f81052e1d0cdf3f2eff1e0.jpg)  \nFigure 1 Log Real Wages across Markets in CareerBuilder and BLS  \n\nNotes: This figure shows a kernel density plot of the log real wage for labor markets for the period 2010Q1- 2013Q4 on CareerBuilder.com. The real wage is defined as the average wage across wage-posting vacancies in a given market and year-quarter, divided by the consumer price index for that year-quarter. The BLS plot corresponds to the log average wages from the Occupational Employment Statistics.  \n\nOur data include, for each vacancy, the number of applicants. This allows us to calculate labor market tightness at the occupation by local labor market level as (number of vacancies)/(number of applications).  \n\nOnly about 20 percent of the CareerBuilder vacancies post salary information. The posted wage is converted into an annual salary if it is hourly. The posted wage is defined as the middle of the range if the vacancy posts a range rather than a single value. We estimate posted wages for a given market and year-quarter as the simple average of the posted wage in the wage-posting vacancies. Figure 1 shows the distribution of log real wages across markets and year-quarters. The distribution is tri-modal. For comparison, the figure also plots the distribution of occupational wages for the same markets from the BLS Occupational Employment Statistics. The distribution of posted wages is overall similar to the distribution of occupational wages. Posted wages have more mass in the left tail of the distribution, consistent with starting wages being lower.  \n\n### B. Labor Market Definition  \n\nGiven that monopsony power in labor markets has not been a focus of antitrust policy, the crucial question of how to define the relevant market for antitrust analysis is relatively unexplored in the literature. The twin imperatives contained in the Horizontal Merger Guidelines are that markets be defined in terms of “lines of commerce”’ and “section of thecountry.\"  \n\nMarinescu and Rathelot (2018) show that applications to a job decline rapidly with distance, although most applications are still outside the applicant's zip code. It is therefore key to define labor markets geographically to obtain meaningful measures of market concentration. For our baseline analysis, we use commuting zones (CZs) to define geographic labor markets. Commuting zones are geographic area definitions based on clusters of counties that were developed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) using data from the 2000 Census on commuting patterns across counties to capture local economies and local labor markets in a way that is more economically meaningful than county boundaries. According to the USDA documentation, “commuting zones were developed without regard to a minimum population threshold and are intended to be a spatial measure of the local labor market.\" Marinescu and Rathelot (2018) also show that 81 percent of applications on CareerBuilder.com are within the commuting zone, and Manning and Petrongolo (2017) similarly find that labor market searches are local in UK data. Bartik (2018) finds evidence against full worker mobility across commuting zones. We conduct robustness checks using single counties for our geographic market definition instead of commuting zones.  \n\nWhen it comes to defining the analog to “line of commerce\" in labor markets, the economic literature shows that there are substantial frictions associated with transitioning between jobs (Artuc, Chaudhuri, and McLaren 2010; Dix-Caneiro 2014; Artuc and McLaren 2015; Traiberman 2019; Macaluso 2017). No work, to our knowledge, attempts to define labor markets in the education space. Macaluso (2017) defines the concept of “skill remoteness\"” on the supply and demand sides of a labor market and finds that workers whose skills are further away from the available jobs in their local labor market (defined by city and occupation) are more likely to either move or exit the labor force in response to a layoff. Hershbein and Kahn (2016) and Modestino, Shoag, and Ballance (2016) characterize the skill distribution of job vacancies as changing in response to the severity of locallabor market recessions. But the extent to which workers confine their job searches to an education- or skills-delimited segment of available jobs has not yet been systematically explored (but some evidence on search across occupations is available in Marinescu and Rathelot 2018).  \n\nUsing the vacancies data set from the same source as the one used in this paper, Marinescu and Wolthoff (2020) show that, within a six-digit SOC, the elasticity of applications to a given job posting with respect to posted wages is negative. Therefore, the six-digit SOC is likely too broad to be a labor market, since we would expect applications to increase in response to posted wages in a frictional labor market (see Section IM1.C below). Nonetheless, we consider SOC-6 occupation to be a conservative benchmark, with the understanding that concentration measured within labor markets defined that way is likely to be an underestimate.  \n\nWe calculate labor market concentration using posted vacancies and applications to those vacancies. Concentration could also be computed using observed employment (albeit not with this data set). The concentration of employment is almost certainly lower than the concentration of vacancies--only a subset of the firms in a given labor market (defined by geography and occupation) will be hiring at any given time. But our measure of concentration based on vacancies is more relevant for active job-seekers, especially in light of evidence of lengthening job tenures, which implies that a given position will remain filled for longer (Hyatt and Spletzer 2016). Moreover, our results about the effect of concentration on wages are estimated from variation in concentration over time within a labor market, and in our robustness checks we aggregate vacancy postings over time, which reduces observed concentration levels, toward what we would probably observe if concentration were computed from firm-level employment.  \n\nWe perform our analysis at the quarterly level in the baseline specification, since the median duration of unemployment was about ten weeks in 2016 (BLS 2017). For our market share calculations we consider all vacancies or applications that occur within a given quarter, including vacancies with missing wages.  \n\n### C. Measuring Concentration  \n\nWe keep an unbalanced panel of 61,017 CZ-occupation-year-quarter observations, covering the period 2010Q1-2013Q4, 681 commuting z0nes, and 26 SOC six-digit occupations. These markets all include at least one vacancy with a posted wage.  \n\nOur baseline measure of market power in a labor market is the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI), calculated based on the share of vacancies of all the firms that post vacancies in that market. By confining this investigation to only the largest online job board, CareerBuilder, we add another dimension to market definition, that of the search platform. If firms post all of their jobs on CareerBuilder, we accurately measure concentration, even if firms also post their jobs on other platforms. If workers who search on CareerBuilder only use that platform, we are accurately measuring concentration for those workers. To the extent that workers search for jobs across multiple platforms and firms do not post all of their jobs on CareerBuilder, our data might yield an excessive concentration estimate.  \n\nThe HHI is widely used as a measure of market concentration in the industrial organization literature and in antitrust practice. An advantage of this measure of market concentration is that there are guidelines for what represents a high level of market concentration. According to the DOJ-FTC guidelines: an HHI above 1,500 is “moderately concentrated,” and above 2,500 is “highly concentrated. An HHI of 2,500 occurs when four employers have equal shares of the vacancies in a labor market. A merger that increases the HHI by more than 200 points, leading to a highly concentrated market, is “presumed likely to increase market power?\"  \n\nWhile these measures and thresholds are generally used to evaluate market concentration in product markets, the antitrust agency guidelines state that “[t]o evaluate whether a merger is likely to enhance market power on the buying side of the market, the Agencies employ essentially the framework described above for evaluating whether a merger is likely to enhance market power on the selling side of the market.\" This implies that adverse effects of mergers on the inputs market, including the labor market, are part of the legal framework for evaluating mergers.  \n\nThese DOJ-FTC HHI thresholds give some guideposts to evaluate the level of concentration, but they have no precise economic meaning beyond that given to them by the historical practice of antitrust enforcement in product markets. Labor markets are different from product markets in a number of ways, and different thresholds for the labor market might make sense. For example, labor markets are two-sided: both employers and workers must agree to the employment contract, while in the product market consumers can buy without an explicit agreement by sellers. This feature of labor markets arguably makes them thinner, so reasonable HHI thresholds for the labor market might be lower than for the product market.  \n\nTable 2 Summary Statistics   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Mean</td><td>SD</td><td>Min.</td><td>Max.</td><td>Obs.</td></tr><tr><td>Real wage</td><td>41,547.36</td><td>36,216.76</td><td>4.71</td><td>5,504,385</td><td>61,017</td></tr><tr><td>Vacancies</td><td>82.95</td><td>224.39</td><td>1</td><td>17,928</td><td>61,017</td></tr><tr><td>Applications</td><td>3,612.96</td><td>14,416.02</td><td>0</td><td>528,289</td><td>61,017</td></tr><tr><td>Searches</td><td>441,156.09</td><td>1,385,720.05</td><td>0</td><td>7,880,8601</td><td>61,017</td></tr><tr><td>Log tightness</td><td>-2.9</td><td>1.36</td><td>-7.64</td><td>4.48</td><td>60,200</td></tr><tr><td>Number of firms</td><td>20.03</td><td>35.78</td><td>1</td><td>571</td><td>61,017</td></tr><tr><td>HHI (vacancies, CZ quarterly)—</td><td>3,157.02</td><td>2,923.92</td><td>66.04</td><td>10,000</td><td>61,017</td></tr><tr><td>baseline HHI (applications, CZ quarterly)</td><td>3,480.17</td><td>3,061.03</td><td>0</td><td>10,000</td><td>61,017</td></tr><tr><td>HHI (vacancies, CZ monthly)</td><td>3,251.69</td><td>3,004.4</td><td>74.23</td><td>10,000</td><td>132,461</td></tr><tr><td>HHI (vacancies, CZ semesterly)</td><td>3,090.29</td><td>2,872.86</td><td>58.57</td><td>10,000</td><td>38,503</td></tr><tr><td>HHI (vacancies, CZ yearly)</td><td>2,970.47</td><td>2,780.11</td><td>51.91</td><td>10,000</td><td>24,060</td></tr><tr><td>HHI (vacancies, CZ whole period)</td><td>2,541.6</td><td>2,498.51</td><td>54.76</td><td>10,000</td><td>8,979</td></tr><tr><td>HHI (applications, CZ monthly)</td><td>3,790.37</td><td>31,32.18</td><td>0</td><td>10,000</td><td>132,461</td></tr><tr><td>HHI (applications, CZ semesterly)</td><td>3,315.38</td><td>3,017.08</td><td>0</td><td>10,000</td><td>38,503</td></tr><tr><td>HHI (applications, CZ yearly)</td><td>3,120</td><td>2,900.47</td><td>0</td><td>10,000</td><td>24,060</td></tr><tr><td>HHI (applications, CZ whole period)</td><td>2,722.97</td><td>2,653.19</td><td>0</td><td>10,000</td><td>8,979</td></tr><tr><td>HHI (vacancies, CZ quarterly,</td><td>1,690.74</td><td>1,942.09</td><td>66.04</td><td>10,000</td><td>61,013</td></tr><tr><td>population-weighted) HHI (applications, CZ quarterly,</td><td>1,848.51</td><td>2,127.09</td><td>0</td><td>10,000</td><td>61,013</td></tr><tr><td>population-weighted) HHI (vacancies, county quarterly)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>HHI (applications, county quarterly)</td><td>4,222.52</td><td>3,331.36</td><td>76.09 0</td><td>10,000</td><td>111,109</td></tr><tr><td>HHI (vacancies, state quarterly)</td><td>4,563.85 1,358.48</td><td>3,369.67 1,634.58</td><td>64.01</td><td>10,000 10,000</td><td>111,109</td></tr><tr><td>HHI (applications, state quarterly)</td><td>1,458.09</td><td>1,781.24</td><td>0</td><td>10,000</td><td>15,124 15,124</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: This table shows summary statistics for our sample consisting of commuting zone-occupational code (six-digit SOC)labor markets over the period 2010Q1-2013Q4.  \n\nThe formula for the HHI in market $m$ and year-quarter $t$ is  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{HHI}_{m,t}=\\sum_{j=1}^{J}s_{j,m,t}^{2}\n$$  \n\nwhere $s_{j,m}$ is the market share of $\\mathrm{firm}j$ in market $m$ .

Market shares are defined as either the sum of vacancies posted in CareerBuilder.com by a given firm in a given market and year-quarter divided by total vacancies posted in the website in that market and year-quarter, or as the sum of applications (EOl) through the website to a given firm in a given market and year-quarter divided by the total number of applications to all firms in that market and year-quarter.  \n\ntreat all vacancies posted by a recruiting or staffing firm as belonging to the same firm, since we cannot observe for which firm the recruiting or staffing firm is hiring.  \n\nIn addition to calculating HHIs for each labor market based on shares of vacancies, we also calculated HHIs based on shares of applications (more specifically expressions of interest, that is, clicking on the button “Apply now\"). For the HHI based on applications, we define the market share of a firm in a given market and year-quarter as the sum of applications to a given firm in a given market and year-quarter divided by the total number of applications to all firms in that market and year-quarter.  \n\nTable 2 shows summary statistics of the main variables used in our analysis. The average real wage was 41,547 USD (in 2009 dollars). The average market in our sample had 20 firms, 83 vacancies, 441,156 searches, and 3,613 applications. The average HHI based on vacancies was 3,157. The average HHI based on applications was somewhat higher at 3,480, reflecting the fact that not all vacancies received the same level of interest from job-seekers.  \n\nTable 2 also shows that the average HHI calculated using shorter time periods than the quarter is higher, and the HHI using longer time periods is lower but still highly concentrated. The population-weighted quarterly HHI is lower and moderately concentrated. The population-weighted HHI is lower than the unweighted HHI because large cities tend to be less concentrated (Figure 2). The population-weighted HHI is relevant to understand the experience of the average worker, while the unweighted HHI represents the average labor market. That many labor markets are highly concentrated is policyrelevant because a merger review by antitrust authorities asks whether anticompetitive effects are likely in any one market (Marinescu and Hovenkamp 2019).  \n\n![](images/4db007714eacc7d7f7ba1ab0037d30443a0138165dabf96b22e698b35cd6ee32.jpg)  \n\nAs would be expected, county-level HHIs are higher than CZ-level HHIs, and statelevel HHIs are lower than CZ-level HHIs. With the exception of a state-level definition of the labor market, all alternative definitions still show moderate to high concentration.  \n\nFigure 2 shows a map of all the commuting zones in the United States color-coded by the average HHI, based on vacancy shares. Commuting zones around large cities tend to have lower levels of labor market concentration than smaller cities or rural areas. This suggests a new explanation for the city wage premium (Yankow 2006; BaumSnow and Pavan 2012): cities, and especially large cities, tend to have less concentrated labor markets than rural areas.? Consistent with this interpretation, Hirsch et al. (2022) find that the urban wage premium in Germany is partly explained a higher labor supply elasticity in more densely populated cities.  \n\nFigure 3 shows the distribution of the HHIs based on vacancies and of the HHI based on applications in our sample. Under both definitions for market shares, the median market is moderately concentrated, while the average market is highly concentrated.  \n\nFigure 4 shows the average HHI, based on vacancy shares, by six-digit SOC occupation. The occupations that are least concentrated on average are “Customer service representatives,’ “Sales representatives, wholesale and manufacturing, technical and scientific products,” and “Registered nurses,”each with an average HHI of around 2,000. The occupations that are most concentrated on average are “Farm equipment mechanics,\"“Rail car repairers,” and \"Light truck or delivery services drivers,” each with an average HHI well above 5,0oo (which is the level of concentration of a symmetric duopsonymarket).  \n\nIn summary, we find that reasonably defined local labor markets are highly concentrated on average. Manning (2011) notes that monopsony power is due to two types of mechanisms: labor market frictions and idiosyncrasies, and collusion and institutions, with almost no evidence on the latter mechanism. High labor market concentration can facilitate collusion, so our findings start to fill in the gap on these types of mechanisms behind labor market power. A limitation of our analysis is that we only use vacancies posted on the CareerBuilder website.4 Given that CareerBuilder is the largest jobposting website in the United States, the high level of concentration was somewhat surprisingtous.  \n\n## III. Concentration and Wages  \n\nFigure 5 shows a binned scatter plot of the log real wage and log HHI based on vacancies. The two variables are strongly correlated, and the association is close to log-linear. Figure 6 shows a similar relationship between the real wage and market concentration obtains when using the log HHI based on applications instead of the log HHI based on vacancies.  \n\n![](images/79a50683e30ec2ff460f636d823805a28499d3c4fbeee126020c29c8e37ae586.jpg)  \nFigure 5 Binned Scatter of Log HHI Based on Vacancies and Log Real Wage Notes: This figure shows a binned scatter plot of log HHI based on vacancy shares and log real wage in the same market, using 18 quantiles.  \n\nThis negative correlation between market concentration and real wages is consistent with standard oligopsony theory, which predicts that firms in more concentrated labor markets should be able to pay workers wages below their marginal product. For the product market, it is well known that firms in a more concentrated market set higher prices in equilibrium (Whinston 2007). The relationship between prices and concentration is an equilibrium one, where concentration is endogenous. Unobserved costs are the key confound when estimating the empirical relationship between prices and concentration in the product market (Whinston 2007).  \n\nIn the labor market, theory shows that the wage markdown (that is, the gap between productivity and wages) increases with the HHI and decreases with the elasticity of labor supply (Azar, Marinescu, and Steinbaum 2019). Empirically, when we see that concentration increases and wages decrease, we cannot easily figure out if this because the markdown went up for a given level of productivity or because productivity itself declined. While costs are the key variable confounding the relationship between concentration and prices in the product market, labor productivity is the key variable confounding the relationship between concentration and wages in the labor market.  \n\n![](images/f94074c7c4642d06606487fe3812e97ea68bad23f130edb7cb04b7c2f674534e.jpg)  \nFigure 6 Binned Scatter of Log HHI Based on Applications and Log Real Wage Notes: This figure shows a binned scatter plot of log HHI based on application shares and log real wage in the same market, using 18 quantiles.  \n\nWe adopt various strategies to identify the equilibrium relationship between wages and concentration using panel regressions that control for commuting zone by occupation effects. We are thus asking how variation in concentration over time in a commuting zone by occupation pair affects wages in this same market.  \n\n### A. Empirical Specification: OLS and IV  \n\nOur baseline specification is as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\log(w_{m,t})=\\upbeta\\cdot\\mathrm{{logHHI}}_{m,t}+\\uptheta\\cdot X_{m,t}+\\upalpha_{t}+\\updelta_{m}+\\upvarepsilon_{m,t},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\log(w_{m,t})$ is the log real wage in market $m$ in year-quarter $t$ , log $\\mathrm{HHI}_{m,t}$ is the corresponding log HHI, $X_{m,t}$ is a set of controls, $\\upalpha_{t}$ and $\\updelta_{m}$ are year-quarter and market (commuting zone-occupation) fixed effects, and $\\varepsilon_{m,t}$ is an error term.  \n\nWe run a first specification with just year-quarter fixed effects (Table 3). We then add successively market (CZ by SOC-6) fixed effects and log tightness (defined as the number of vacancies divided by the number of applications in a labor market) in the commuting zone and occupation for a given year-quarter. We then run a fourth specification further controlling for year-quarter by commuting zone, and finally we also add year-quarter-by-SOC fixed effects in a fifth specification, to control for any possible changes in the characteristics of the commuting zone or the occupation over time. In a robustness test, we also control for the number of vacancies in the market, which can be interpreted as a measure of labor demand independent of the level of concentration. We cluster standard errors at the commuting zone-occupation level.  \n\nTable3 Effect of Market Concentration on Real Wages: Panel Regressions (First Stage)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"3\">Dependent Variable: Log HHI (Vacancies)</td></tr><tr><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td></tr><tr><td>Panel A: Market-Level Regressions</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Average log (1/M) in other markets</td><td>1.005*** (0.0344)</td><td>1.046*** (0.0323)</td><td>1.074*** (0.0340)</td></tr><tr><td>Log tightness</td><td></td><td>0.171*** (0.00471)</td><td>0.198*** (0.00558)</td></tr><tr><td>Market (CZ× six-digit SOC) FE</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Year-quarter FE</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Year-quarterFExCZFE</td><td></td><td></td><td>56,679</td></tr><tr><td>Observations R-squared</td><td>59,485</td><td>58,642 0.852</td><td>0.865</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.846</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>Dependent Variable: Log HHI (Vacancies) (2)</td><td>(3) (4)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Panel B: Vacancy-Level Regressions Average log (1/N) in other markets</td><td>0.871***</td><td>0.926***</td><td>0.889*** 0.931***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.129)</td><td>(0.124) (0.116)</td><td>(0.0760)</td></tr><tr><td>Log tightness</td><td></td><td>0.451***</td><td>0.341*** 0.252***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(0.0162) (0.0186)</td><td>(0.0146)</td></tr><tr><td>CZ× six-digit SOC FE</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Year-quarter FE</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Year-quarter FE x CZ FE</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CZx Job-title FE</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>1,023,295</td><td>1,021,185</td><td>1,020,510 955,641</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.902</td><td>0.913 0.928</td><td>0.948</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThe key threat to identification is that there is a time-varying market-specific variable that is correlated with HHI and drives wages. The key confound according to the oligopsony theory discussed above is labor productivity. What other confounds are most likely? According to search and matching theory, posted wages are determined by labor market tightness, productivity, and the worker's out-of-work benefit (Rogerson, Shimer, and Wright 2005). We already control for labor market tightness. Since unemployment benefits are determined at the state level, we are able to control for workers' outof-work benefits by controlling for market fixed effects, and, in some specifications, market-by-time fixed effects. Therefore, the main threat to identification remains timevarying, market-specific productivity changes.  \n\nTo further address the issue of the endogeneity of HHI, we instrument the HHI with the average of $\\log(1/N)$ in other commuting zones for the same occupation and time period (where $N$ refers to the number of firms in the market). That is, for each commuting zone-occupation-time period combination, we calculate the average of log(1/N) for the same occupation for every other commuting zone. We use $\\log(1/N)$ insteadof HHI as the instrument because it is less likely to be endogenous, as it does not depend on market shares. This instrument provides us with variation in market concentration that is driven by national-level changes in the occupation, not by changes in the occupation in that particular local market. In particular, the instrument should be independent of the occupational productivity in the local labor market, which is likely to be the main confounding factor in the baseline OLS regressions. For example, if the productivity of customer service representatives falls in the Chicago area, this could both decrease wages and increase concentration, since fewer firms would likely be recruiting. By instrumenting with the number of firms posting vacancies for customer service representatives in other areas, we rule out a direct effect of productivity in Chicago on the HHI.  \n\nThis type of instrumental variables strategy is commonly used in industrial organization to address the endogeneity of prices in a local product market. For example, Nevo (2001) uses prices in other geographic markets to instrument for city-level prices of various products in the ready-to-eat cereal industry.  \n\nThe main threat to identification for the instrumental variable strategy is that productivity shocks could be correlated across areas. For example, a national level decline in the productivity of customer service representatives would likely increase concentration and decrease wages in most labor markets. Therefore, the instrument protects us against a spurious correlation between concentration and outcomes that is due to local changes in productivity, but not against national-level changes in productivity (for an occupation relative to other occupations)that influence both concentration and other labor market outcomes.  \n\nThe instrument may not be not fully exogenous in the sense that it may have a direct effect on wages that does not go through local concentration. However, it is plausibly more exogenous that the local market HHI, in particular because it is less likely to be correlated with uncontrolled-for variations in local productivity. We exploit this idea by deriving bounds for the causal effect of HHI on wages using the method developed by Conley, Hansen, and Rossi (2010). Suppose that the instrument is not fully exogenous in the sense that it has a direct effect on posted wages, with a coefficient of $\\upgamma\\neq0$ .Ifwe assume a range of values for $\\upgamma$ between zero (perfectly exogenous) and the reduced form effect, we can derive an interval for the causal effect of the HHI on wages that takes into account deviations from exogeneity $(\\gamma\\neq0)$ . This procedure allows us to determine how big the direct effect of the instrument on wages could be for the interval of the causal effect of HHI on wages to exclude zero.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"9\">( o  </td><td rowspan=\"9\">N OLS</td><td rowspan=\"9\">8 E 5 3 2</td><td rowspan=\"9\">Panel A: Market-Level Regressions</td><td>0.0305*** -0.127*** (0.0176) -0.0378***， -0.0399*** (0.00392) -0.0347*** (0.00377) -0.103*** Log HHI (vacancies) Log tightness</td><td>(0.00479) 56,679 58,642</td></tr><tr><td>-0.143*** -0.141*** -0.0300***</td><td>0.0283*** (0.00427) (0.0181) (0.0191)</td></tr><tr><td>(0.00422) 0.00686* (0.00360)</td><td>56,677 ></td></tr><tr><td>0.0132*** (0.00406) (0.00357)</td><td>56,679 →</td></tr><tr><td>0.0113*** (0.00320)</td><td>0.715 58,642 0.672</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>59,485 0.674</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>61,017 0.042</td></tr><tr><td>(0.00456) Market (CZ × six-digit SOC) FE</td><td>Year-Quarter FE × six-digit SOC FE Year-quarter FE × CZ FE</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n\\*\\*SO>d\\*\\*T>d Ieu  e so pepues ssn to pod   e a s   \n  \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"6\">N OLS</td><td rowspan=\"8\">8 5 4 3 2</td><td></td><td>0.0315*** -0.116*** (0.00601) (0.0184)</td><td>955,641 1,020,510</td></tr><tr><td>-0.188*** (0.0370)</td><td>0.0737*** (0.0180)</td></tr><tr><td>0.0540*** -0.192*** (0.0361)</td><td>(0.0133)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.200***</td><td>(0.0398)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.0154*** (0.00377)</td><td>0.00818*** (0.00297)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.0314*** (0.00500) 0.00429</td><td>1,020,510 (0.00462)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.0331*** (0.00476) 0.000665</td><td>1,021,185 (0.00342) 1,023,295</td></tr><tr><td>-0.0327*** Panel B: Vacancy-Level Regressions (0.00453) Log HHI (vacancies)</td><td>Year-quarter FE × CZ FE CZ × six-digit SOC FE</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n![](images/7b81853843b9d3a8e3c1a1fef6e4becc44d68e07a2cd6a006ee9fa19a67ac58b.jpg)  \nFigure 7 Binned Scatter of Residualized Log HHI Based on Vacancies and Residualized Log RealWage  \n\nNotes: This figure shows a binned scatter plot of the residuals of a regression of log HHI (based on vacancy shares) on log tightness, CZ-by-SOC fixed effects, and CZ-by-year-quarter fixed effects and the residuals of a regression of log real wage in the same market, also on log tightness, CZ-by-SOC fixed effects, and CZ-byyear-quarterfixedeffects.  \n\n### B. Regression Results  \n\nWe find that higher labor market concentration is associated with significantly lower real wages. Table 4 Panel A shows the results from the baseline wage regressions. In the first regression, using vacancy-share HHIs and only year-quarter fixed effects, we find that a one log point increase in the HHI is associated with a decline in wages of about O.103 log points. Further controlling for market fixed effects (CZ by six-digit SOC) reduces the coefficientto $-0.0347$ , showing that some of the negative relationship between posted wages and HHI is driven by cross-sectional variation in posted wages. Specification 3 shows that controlling for log tightness does not substantially change the result from Specification 2. We consider Specification 3 to be the baseline for OLS results. Figure 7 shows a binned scatterplot corresponding to Specification 3; the relationship between the residualized wages and the residualized HHI is negative and linear, similar to the raw relationship between wages and HHI (Figure 5).  \n\nSpecifications 4 and 5 allow for commuting zone and occupation effects to change over time. Adding year-quarter-by-CZ fixed effects does not affect the impact of HHI on wages (compare Columns 3 and 4 in Table 4), showing that the effects are not driven by time-varying effects at the CZ level. When we further add year-quarter-by-six-digit SOC fixed effects (Column 5), the impact of HHI on wages remains negative and of a similar size. This shows that the negative impact of HHI on wages is not explained away by changes in occupational wages over time, due to, for example, technological change.  \n\nSpecifications 6-8 show analogous results but based on the IV estimation strategy (see Table 3 for the first stage). The estimated effect is still negative but much larger in absolute value. The IV estimate may be higher because it corrects the endogeneity bias from market-level labor supply and demand effects, and possibly also corrects for measurement error. A one log point increase in the HHI is associated with a decline in wagesofabout $0.14\\log$ points. This implies that an increase in HHI of 200 in a market with an HHI of 2000 (moderately concentrated), which is an increase of ten log points, is associated with a decline in wages of about 1.4 percent. Going from the 25th percentile of market concentration to the 75th percentile of market concentration is associated with a decline in wages of 5 percent according to Specification 3 and of 17 percent according to Specification 7, our baseline specification for the IV.?  \n\nThe main threat to identification for the instrumental variable strategy is that productivity shocks to occupations could be correlated across areas. We cannot control for occupation-by-time fixed effects in the IV specifications due to the fact that the instrument is essentially defined at that level. Nevertheless, it is reassuring to see that controlling for occupation-by-time effects does not substantively change the OLS results (Column 4).  \n\nWe recognize that the instrument may not be not fully exogenous, and we provide bounds on the second-stage effect of HHI on wages, assuming a degree of endogeneity in the instrument. Using market-level data, we regress wages on the instrument and controls (Table 5), which gives us the reduced form effect of the instrument. We then calculate the bounds for the second-stage effect of HHI on wages, assuming that the direct effect of the instrument on wages (Y) ranges from zero (perfectly exogenous) to the reduced form effect. We use Stata's plausexog and start with a simple specification in Column 1, and control for tightness in Column 2. When controlling for tightness, the second-stage effect of HHI on wages ranges between $-0.177$ and 0.036 (Table 5, Column 2, $\\upbeta$ bounds). The bounds for the second-stage estimate exclude zero as long as the direct effect of the instrument is smaller than $-0.112$ $\\upgamma_{m a x}$ in Table 5 , Column 2), or 75 percent of the reduced form effect. Specification 3 adds year-quarter-by-CZ fixed effects, and the results are very similar to Specification 2. We conclude that the negative impact of concentration on wages is robust to a large degree of instrument endogeneity. The instrument would have to be very endogenous for the impact of concentration on wages to plausibly take positive values.  \n\n### C. Controlling for Job Titles  \n\nMarinescu and Wolthoff (2020) showed that job titles are an important predictor of wages and are informative about the type of job and required skills beyond a pure wage  \n\nTable5 Plausibly Exogenous Instrument Regressions (Market-Level Data)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Dependent Variable: Log(Real Wage)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-0.141*** (0.0186)</td><td>-0.149*** (0.0184)</td><td>-0.137*** (0.0184)</td></tr><tr><td>Log tightness</td><td></td><td>0.00387 (0.00310)</td><td>0.00526 (0.00344)</td></tr><tr><td>Market (CZ× six-digit SOC) FE Year-quarter FE</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Year-quarter FEx CZ FE</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>59,485</td><td>58,642</td><td>56,679</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.674</td><td>0.671</td><td>0.715</td></tr><tr><td>β (lower bound)</td><td>-0.178</td><td>-0.177</td><td>-0.157</td></tr><tr><td>β (upper bound)</td><td>0.0362</td><td>0.0357</td><td>0.0349</td></tr><tr><td>max</td><td>-0.105</td><td>-0.112</td><td>-0.100</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNotes: Data are for the period 2010Q1-2013Q4. We consider the following model in which the instrument is not fully exogenous and therefore can enter in the second stage: $\\begin{array}{r}{\\log(w_{m,t})=\\upbeta\\cdot\\mathrm{logHHI}_{m,t}+\\upgamma\\cdot z+\\uptheta\\cdot X_{m,t}+}\\end{array}$ $\\alpha_{t}+\\delta_{m}+\\varepsilon_{m,t},$ where $z$ is our instrumental variable. We implement the plausibly exogenous instrument regression methodology as follows. We start by running reduced form OLS regressions analogous to our IV specifications, but including the instrument directly in the second stage instead of log HHI. The value of $\\hat{\\upgamma}$ in the table refers to the coefficient of the instrument in this regression. We take $\\hat{\\upgamma}$ as the lower bound for the range of $\\upgamma$ and zero as the upper bound, and then compute bounds for the coefficient on log HHI (β) using the plausibly exogenous regression methodology of Conley, Hansen, and Rossi (2010). We implement the methodology by (i) within-transforming all the variables (including the dependent variable, the regressors, and the instruments) by running regressions with each variable on the left-hand side and the corresponding set of fixed effects on the right-hand side, and taking the residuals as the transformed variables, and (i) running the plausibly exogenous instrument regressions on the within-transformed variables using the plausexog command in Stata developed by Clarke (2017). We cluster standard errors at the market level. We also calculate the value of the lower bound for $\\upgamma$ that would make the interval for $\\upbeta$ be fully to the left of zero. We call this value $\\upgamma_{m a x}$ $^{*}p<0.1$ $^{**}p<0.05$ ， $***{}p<0.01$  \n\nsignaling effect. We are thus interested in studying to what extent market concentration affects wages through job titles and to what extent it has a direct effect beyond the effect that can be explained by job titles. For this purpose, we conducted regressions at the individual vacancy level, controlling for job title fixed effects (based on strings capturing the first three words in the vacancy's job title).  \n\nThe results are shown in Table 4, Panel B. The first three specifications show results using the same controls as in the market-level baseline regressions, and we find similar results. The fourth specification controls for commuting zone-by- job title fixed effects. The effect has a negative sign and is statistically significant, but the magnitude is about one-half of the effect without job title fixed effects. This mitigation of the effect is present in both the OLS and the IV specifications.  \n\nThis indicates that the effect of an increase in market concentration on wages is expressed both directly through lower wages conditional on a job title, as well as by increasing the likelihood of posting lower-wage job titles.  \n\n## IV. Robustness Checks  \n\n### A. Interaction with City Size  \n\nWe tested whether the negative effect of market concentration on wages is driven by small or large cities, or whether it holds across the whole range of city sizes in our sample. For this purpose, we ran a specification interacting the vacancy HHI in a market with a fifth-order polynomial in the percentile of the population of that market's commuting zone, which we instrument using a fifth-order polynomial in the mean of $\\log(1/N)$ for the same occupation in other CZs.  \n\nThe estimated effect of market concentration as a function of commuting zone population percentile is shown in Figure 8, together with 95 percent confidence bands. The effect is negative and significant over the range of population going from the 1Oth to the 90th percentile, and it is higher (in absolute value) for smaller markets than larger markets.  \n\nTherefore, less populated commuting zones are not only more concentrated on average, but an increase in concentration has a more negative effect on wages.  \n\n### B.Controlling for theNumber of Vacancies  \n\nA key threat to identification is that wages are affected by local demand. We can use the number of posted vacancies as a proxy for local demand. The negative effect of HHI on posted wages remains of the same magnitude in both OLS and IV when controlling for the log of the number of vacancies posted (Table 6, Columns 1 and 2).  \n\n### C. Excluding Monopsony $\\begin{array}{r}{(H H I=I}\\end{array}$ Markets  \n\nThe histogram in Figure 3 shows that many markets in the sample only have one firm hiring. We checked that our estimates are not sensitive to excluding these markets by running additional regressions that do exactly that. The results from the panel IV specification are reported in Table 6, Specifications 3 and 4, which show that the magnitude and significance of the estimated effect is similar to the analogous specification in the baseline in both OLS and IV.  \n\n### D. Alternative Market Definitions  \n\nWe chose SOC-6 as the definition of a market in terms of occupation. Broadening the definition of the labor market to SOC-2 by CZ instead of SOC-6 by CZ makes the effect of HHI on wages larger in both OLS and IV (Table 6, Columns 5 and 6). On the other hand, narrowing the definition of the labor market to a job title by commuting zone makes the estimated effect of HHI on posted wages smaller (Table 6, Columns 7), and the effect becomes insignificant in IV (Table 6, Columns 8). One possible explanation  \n\n![](images/db309dd4d53d8707573d5e25408b2f57b4c9bdc1db4ed15f940edce4800a22ea.jpg)  \nFigure 8 Effect of Log HHI (Vacancies) on Log Real Wage by Commuting Zone Population Percentile  \n\nNotes: Estimated effect from a panel IV regression of log real wage on a fifth-order polynomial in log HHI (in terms of vacancies), instrumented with a fifth-order polynomial in average log 1/N in other commuting zones for the same occupation, controlling for log tightness, CZ-by-six-digit SOC fixed effects and time fixed effects. Data are for the period 2010Q1-2013Q4. We cluster standard errors at the market level.  \n\nfor this pattern of results is measurement error: a broader market definition entails more vacancies that the HHI can be calculated from, thereby reducing measurement error.  \n\nIn terms of geography, we chose to use commuting zones as a market definition because they were designed to capture meaningful geographic labor markets based on commuting patterns across counties. However, the correct geographic definition for labor market competition for hiring is still an open question. We decided to test the sensitivity of our results by using an alternative definition based on counties and running panel IV specifications analogous to our baseline.  \n\nThe results are shown in Table 7, Specification 3. The estimated coefficient is similar to those in the baseline, indicating that our results are robust to other plausible geographic labor market definitions.  \n\n### E.Alternative Concentration Measures  \n\nAs a robustness check, we estimated panel IV regressions similar to our baseline specification from Table 4, Column 6, but using log 1/N as the measure of market concentration. The results are similar to the baseline, as shown in Table 7, Specification1.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"9\">Job Titles SOC-2 Excluding HHI= 1 Control for Vacancies</td><td>N</td><td>0.0337 (0.0350)</td><td>-0.0102*** (0.00237) -0.00673***</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>OLS E N</td><td>-0.00644*** (0.00247) -0.303***</td><td>(0.000772) 0.0683*** (0.00765)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.0296) -0.0491***</td><td>(0.00504)</td><td>36,023 -0.101 36,023</td></tr><tr><td>OLS</td><td>(0.00522)</td><td>0.0181*** 0.0359*** (0.00582)</td><td>0.675</td></tr><tr><td>N ④</td><td>-0.131*** (0.0185) -0.0377***</td><td>(0.00424) 0.00467 (0.00363)</td><td>51,607 907.1 0.705 51,607</td></tr><tr><td>OLS ?</td><td>0.0135*** (0.00425) 0.0378***</td><td>-0.0143*** (0.00604)</td><td>0.709 56,679</td></tr><tr><td>N OLS E</td><td>-0.150*** (0.0217)</td><td>(0.00459)</td><td>565.6 0.709 56,679</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-0.0373*** 0.0127*** (0.00405)</td><td>(0.00374) 0.00208 (0.00331)</td><td>0.715</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Log HH1 (vacancies) Log tightness</td><td>Log vacancies</td><td>CZ FE × six-digit SOC FE Year-quarter FE × CZ FE CZ × Job-title FE</td><td>Kleibergen-Paap F-stat Observations R-squared</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n( o s   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"11\"> Dependent Variable: Log(Real Wage)</td><td rowspan=\"11\">Tightness Search Cross-Section 5 Cross-Section County ③ HH1 (EOI) M</td><td>-0.125***</td><td>0.0252*** (0.0185) (0.0447)</td></tr><tr><td>Posting Wage Fraction (BLS Wages)</td><td>0.0325*** -0.157*** (0.00510) 0.147*** (0.0231) (0.0305)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.0352*** (0.00555) 0.00308 (0.00349)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>-0.0927*** (0.0156)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0.0300*** (0.00997) 0.0248*** -0.142*** (0.00337)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>(0.0153) -0.102*** (0.00350) (0.0142) 0.00301</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0.00898*** (0.00345)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>-0.0882*** (0.0123)</td><td>County FE × six-digit SOC FE</td></tr><tr><td>Log HHI (vacancies) Log HHI (EOI) Log (1/N)</td><td>CZ FE × six-digit SOC FE Year-quarter FE × CZ FE Log (vacancies/searches) Fraction posting wage Log tightness</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nWe also estimated regressions using log HHI based on share of applications as the measure of concentration, again with similar results; see Table 7, Specification 2. This shows that our results are robust to using a range of standard measures of market concentration and therefore not driven by a particular choice of measure.  \n\n### F. Cross-Sectional Specification  \n\nOur baseline specification identifies the effect of market concentration on wages purely from variation within a market over time. One may also be interested in identification from cross-sectional variation. We implemented a specification based on the entire 2010-2013 period. We included CZ fixed effects and six-digit SOC fixed effects, so that our estimates are not driven by variation in average wages across cities or in average wages across occupations. Similar to the baseline, we instrument the log HHI using the log 1/N, except that we use the number of firms for the entire period. The impact of concentration on posted wages is still negative and significant in this cross-sectional data (Table 7, Specification 4). Furthermore, we find that the impact of concentration on prevailing wages measured from the BLS occupational employment statistics is also negative and significant (Specification 5). Figure 9 plots the negative relationship between residualized HHI and wages in these IV regressions (Panels C and D). For comparison, in Panels A and B, the figure also shows the relationship between residualized HHI and wages in OLS, which is less steep than in IV.  \n\nThe estimated impact of HHI on occupational wages is smaller than on posted wages, presumably because the market concentration among vacancies has a more direct effect on posted wages than on the wages of incumbent workers. Indeed, the wages of stayers, which are included in the BLS occupational wage, are less sensitive to economic conditions than the wages of new hires (Carneiro, Guimaraes, and Portugal 2012; Haefke, Sonntag, and van Rens 2013). Overall, these results alleviate the concern that our results are driven by the less than fully representative nature of our data.  \n\n### G. Controlling for Fraction of Vacancies Posting Wages  \n\nAn important limitation of the data set is that only a fraction of the vacancies on CareerBuilder post wages. At the market level, it may be that wage posting is correlated with an omitted variable that determines both wages and concentration. This could bias the estimated coefficient on concentration in the wage regression. To assess the potential for such a bias, we run a panel IV specification controlling for the fraction of vacancies in each market that post wages. Table 7, Specification 6 shows the results. We find that this variable has a positive effect on wages, but does not meaningfully affect the coefficient on log HHI.  \n\n### H. Controlling for Tightness Based on Searches Instead of Applications  \n\nAnother concern is that the tightness measure could be endogenous with respect to wages—high-wage vacancies get more applications, so this lowers the tightness measure. As an alternative measure of tightness, we use the log of the ratio of total vacancies in the market to total searches in the market. Searches should not be affected by posted wages because workers do not search by wage but typically by job title and location, so this can address the endogeneity concern. Table 7, Specification 7 shows the results from the corresponding panel IV specification, which are similar to those in the baseline specification.  \n\n![](images/aa4084866543f58091519ddce9595f446fc3b7491fd1bd6493537edc2d3a7d9f.jpg)  \n\n![](images/45c87cd6085dec6cb25c9826ebcedf4e21059811157e76f7b814c71e7ce3fb88.jpg)  \n\n### 1. Remaining Limitations  \n\nOur analysis accounts for a number of biases in the estimation of the relationship between labor market concentration and posted wages. However, a number of limitationsremain.  \n\nOnly 20 percent of vacancies post wages, and we are therefore not measuring all wages in a given occupation by commuting zone market. However, Marinescu and Wolthoff (2020) show that the distribution of posted wages on CareerBuilder is very similar to the distribution of wages for employed workers in the Current Population Survey. Therefore, posted wages are typical of wages overall in the labor market.  \n\nOur data come from a single website, CareerBuilder.com. While this is the largest U.S. job-search website, and it contains about one-third of U.S. vacancies, it does not contain all vacancies in the occupations that are in our sample. This could lead us to overestimate labor market concentration for the selected occupations. At the same time, smaller occupations that were not included in our sample will typically be even more concentrated, which results in a higher average concentration when a broader sample of occupations is used (Azar et al. 2020). Furthermore, the fact that we only capture some of the vacancies should not affect our estimate of the relationship between posted wages and labor market concentration.  \n\nOur data contain the most frequent occupations by number of vacancies on CareerBuilder.com and a number of manufacturing occupations. Therefore, our results, while fairly general, do not necessarily apply to the whole U.s. labor market. It is noteworthy that Benmelech, Bergman, and Kim (2022) and Rinz (2022) find a negative and significant relationship between wages and employment concentration at the county and industry level. Therefore, studying employment rather than vacancies and changing the labor market definition does not affect the basic fact that wages are negatively associated with labor market concentration.  \n\n## V. Discussion and Conclusion  \n\nLabor economists are increasingly questioning the assumption of almost perfectly competitive labor markets (Card et al. 2016), and they have begun to address the antitrust policy implications of relaxing that assumption. Krueger and Ashenfelter (2022) study the prevalence of anticompetitive no-poaching language in franchising contracts, which has led to a series of recent antitrust cases against franchise employers. Marinescu and Hovenkamp (2019) and Naidu, Posner, and Weyl (2018) both consider the implications of concentrated labor markets for merger enforcement. Following this flurry of academic papers, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission said in Congressional testimony that he had instructed the agency's staff to examine the labor market impact of every merger the agency reviews, and he further elaborated that market definition in labor markets for antitrust enforcement purposes should be guided by the elasticity of labor supply to the individual firm (Simons 2018).  \n\nThe idea that monopsony power can harm efficiency dates back to the origins of American antitrust policy. One of the reasons Senator John Sherman gave for legislating against monopoly was that it has the power to fix wages due to a lack of competition: \\*[ijt commands the price of labor without fear of strikes, for in its field it allows no competitors\" (Congressional Record 2457, 1890). The horizontal merger guidelines recognize that the same framework can be applied to market power on the part of buyers as well as sellers, although there have been few merger challenges premised on monopsony theories of harm, and as of 2021, only one in which the labor market is where the monopsony power is being challenged.°  \n\nWe contribute to this growing debate by calculating measures of market concentration in local labor markets for the most frequent occupations on the leading employment website CareerBuilder.com. We have shown that concentration is high, and increasing concentration is associated with lower wages. Our results suggest that the anticompetitive effects of concentration on the labor market could be important. The type of analysis we provide could be used to incorporate labor market concentration concerns as a factor in antitrust analysis.  \n\n## References  \n\nArtuc, Erhan, Shubham Chaudhuri, and John McLaren. 2010. “Trade Shocks and Labor Adjustment: A Structural Empirical Approach.’ American Economic Review 100(3):1008-45.   \nArtuc, Erhan, and John McLaren. 2015. \\*\"Trade Policy and Wage Inequality: A Structural Analysis with Occupational and Sectoral Mobility.\"’ Journal of International Economics 97(2):28-41.   \nAshenfelter, Orley C., Henry Farber, and Michael R.

    "reference_markdown": "# Measuring Labor Market Power Two Waysi  \n\nBy JOSE AZAR, IOANA MARINESCU, AND MARSHALL STEINBAUM\\*  \n\nA growing literature on employer power in labor markets provides evidence for widespread monopsony (e.g., Webber 2015; Dube et al. forthcoming). Much of this literature uses the elasticity of labor supply to the individual firm as a key proxy for monopsony; an elasticity that is well below infinity is a sign that employers have wage-setting power (Manning 2011) and can pay workers less than their marginal productivity. More recently, a flurry of studies has shown a negative relationship between wages and labor market concentration of employers (Rinz 2018; Benmelech, Bergman, and Kim 2018; Azar, Marinescu, and Steinbaum 2017; Lipsius 2018). The labor supply elasticity and labor market concentration are both measures of labor market power, but how are they empirically related?  \n\nIn this paper, we estimate a proxy for the elasticity of labor supply and investigate the relationship between this proxy and labor market concentration. We use data from the popular job posting website CareerBuilder.com to estimate firm-level wage-setting power based on the elasticity of job applications in response to variation in the posted wage. In order to deal with the endogeneity of wages, we instrument for local variation in posted wages with posted wages from the same firm in other occupations and other commuting zones. The elasticity we estimate is 0.42, a fairly low value.  \n\nWe  then relate  our  estimated  application elasticities to labor market concentration, the  \n\nHerfindahl-Hirshman Index based on vacancy shares. We find that, across commuting zone by six-digit standard occupational classification (SOC-6) occupation markets, the application elasticity to the firm is negatively correlated with labor market concentration. Furthermore, markets with higher concentration or lower application elasticity tend to have significantly lower wages. These findings are robust to using only within commuting zone variation across occupations, and are consistent with a theoretical framework where concentration and the labor supply elasticity are both measures of the gap between wages and productivity (Boal and Ransom 1997). Overall, our findings suggest that higher concentration and lower application elasticity both contribute to explaining wage suppression.  \n\nWe expect the application elasticity to be higher in more densely populated areas; an abundance of both jobs and workers makes these labor markets closer to the ideal of perfect competition. To test this idea, we estimate the application elasticity as a function of the population density in a commuting zone. While the application elasticity is higher in denser commuting zones, it is still below five, which departs from perfect competition (Naidu, Posner, and Weyl 2018). This implies that even though labor market concentration is low in the most populous areas (Azar et al. 2018), the application elasticity is also low, consistent with a non-negligible degree of monopsony power.  \n\nThese findings speak to two questions that have arisen in response to the research on employer power in labor markets. First, they are consistent with employer concentration being a measure of the power of employers to pay workers less than their marginal productivity. Second, they show that while employers exercise significant market power in labor markets in general, their market power does vary meaningfully with concentration. Given that concentration is a key measure for antitrust enforcement (US Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission 2010), these findings imply that antitrust policy is a promising, if not the only, policy tool available for mitigating the monopsony power of employers.  \n\n## 1. Theoretical Framework  \n\nTheory predicts that labor market concentration and the labor supply elasticity should be negatively correlated, and that wages should be higher when concentration is lower and when the labor supply elasticity is higher. Assume that firms play an employment setting game under the Cournot model (for a more detailed development, see Boal and Ransom 1997). The market wage $w$ increases with the total employment level $L$ in the market: $w(L)$ . A firm chooses the level of employment to maximize profits, anticipating that higher employment leads to a higher wage for the whole market, including itself. In this model, if there are many firms, the impact of a firm's increased employment on market wages is minimal because wages are already high and close to the marginal revenue product of labor. If there are few firms, one firm's increased demand for labor increases market-level employment and wages, so equilibrium employment and wages are suppressed relative to the competitive equilibrium where wages are set equal to the marginal revenue product of labor.  \n\nThe first-order condition for the firm's profit maximization  gives  a  frm-specific rate  of exploitation $E_{i}$  \n\n$$\nE_{i}=\\frac{M R P_{i}-w}{w}=\\frac{L_{i}}{L}\\varepsilon^{-1},\n$$  \n\nwhere $M R P_{i}$ is the marginal revenue product of labor in firm $i$ and $\\varepsilon$ is the exogenously given market level elasticity of labor supply (i.e., the additional employment that would accrue to firms in this market if the market wage were marginally raised). Let $E$ be the employment-weighted average rate of exploitation (or wage markdown). We then have  \n\n$$\nE=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}E_{i}\\frac{L_{i}}{L}=\\varepsilon^{-1}H H I\\Leftrightarrow H H I=\\varepsilon E,\n$$  \n\nwhere $H H I$ is the Herfindahl-Hirshman Index for employment.  \n\nIt can be shown that $E$ is also equal to the average (weighted by market shares） inverse firm-level elasticity: theory therefore implies that the average firm-level elasticity in a market should be negatively correlated with the HHI. Furthermore, we expect that, for a given marginal revenue product of labor, wages are lower $\\mathit{\\check{E}}$ is higher) when HHI is higher or when the average inverse firm-level elasticity is lower.  \n\n## II. Empirical Methods and Results  \n\nThe data we use for this paper are online job postings from CareerBuilder.com, which accounts for approximately a third of all online job postings (Marinescu and Wolthoff 2016; Azar, Marinescu, and Steinbaum 2017). For each job posting, we observe its duration, the number of applications received, the employer and its location, the Standard Occupational Classification, and the job title. Approximately 20 percent of the vacancies post wages.  \n\nUsing this data, we measure a proxy for the labor supply elasticity to the individual firm: the elasticity of applications with respect to the posted wage. Given the theory, we expect this elasticity of applications to be negatively correlated with the HHI. Furthermore, the inverse of the application elasticity is a proxy for the market-level rate of exploitation, as defined in equation (2). Therefore, all other things equal, wages should decrease with HHI and increase with the weighted elasticity of applications.  \n\nWe start by estimating the following equation in order to recover application elasticities at the firm level:  \n\n$$\ny_{i j m t}=w_{i j m t}\\sum_{n=0}^{3}\\beta_{n}d_{m}^{n}+\\gamma\\cdot x_{i j m t}+\\varepsilon_{i j m t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $y_{i j m t}$ is the log of the total number of applications to jobs by firm $i$ with job title $j$ in market $m$ in year-quarter $t$ and $w_{i j m t}$ is the corresponding log average wage. In line with theory, observations are weighted by each firm's vacancy share at the CZ by SOC-6 by quarter, which is the level at which the HHI is computed. The $\\beta_{n}$ coefficients estimate the firm-level application elasticity as a function of population density, allowing for a third order polynomial. The vector $x_{i j m t}$ is a set of controls, which in the baseline specification includes the log of the total number of vacancy-days that the firm posted for that job title in that market and year-quarter, year-quarter fixed effects, and $\\mathrm{CZ}\\times\\mathrm{SOC}\\times\\mathrm{job}$ title fixed effects. It is important to control for job title fixed effects as failing to do so would typically yield a negative application elasticity (Marinescu and Wolthoff 2016).  \n\nSince the log wage is an endogenous variable, we instrument it using the average log wage for the same firm in other $\\mathrm{CZ}\\times\\mathrm{SOC}{}-6$ markets (in the spirit of Hausman, Leonard, and Zona 1994). This average excludes wages in the same CZ for other SOC-6s, or wages for the same SOC-6 in other CZs. Wages posted in other labor markets might be a good instrument because of firmlevel wage-setting policies that hold across the labor markets out of which a given firm hires (Card et al. 2016). Local job-posting and wages may be jointly determined by local labor supply and demand conditions, but national firm-level wage-setting in the excluded markets is unlikely to be caused by an omitted variable at the market level and can hence be used to trace out the application elasticity.  \n\nTo allow for elasticities that vary more flexibly than just as a function of CZ population density, we estimate separate regressions for each $\\mathrm{CZ}\\times\\mathrm{SOC}{-}6$ market. We do this in two steps, which are equivalent to interacting the wage with a $\\mathrm{CZ}\\times$ six-digit SOC dummy variable for each market and using the instrument for the wage (also interacted with dummy variables for each market). In the first step, we run three regressions using data for all markets and controlling for log days posted, $\\mathrm{CZ}\\times$ six-digit ${\\mathrm{SOC}}\\times{\\mathrm{job}}$ title fixed effects, and year-quarter fixed effects: the left-hand-side variables are log applications, log wage, and the instrument. For each of these three regressions, we obtain residuals. In the second step, we run, separately for each $\\mathrm{CZ}\\times$ SOC-6, a simple regression of residualized log applications on residualized log wage, instrumented by residualized average log wage for the same firm in other CZs and other SOC-6s. This gives us an estimate of the applications elasticity for each $\\mathrm{CZ}\\times\\mathrm{SOC}{-}6$  \n\nFigure 1 depicts the relationship between firm-level application elasticities and population density as estimated in equation (3). In commuting zones between the twentieth and the eightieth percentile of population density (weighted by employment levels), the application elasticity is not significantly different from zero; in markets below the twentieth percentile of population density, the elasticity appears to be negative, for reasons that are yet to be investigated. Overall,  \n\n![](images/703bfa400f6a4763639970711c7fde18e0583ca5b50d5bd578920975f728a58a.jpg)  \nFIGURE 1.FIRM-LEVEL APPLICATION ELASTICITY AS A FUNCTION OFCOMMUTINGZONEPOPULATIONDENSITY  \n\nNotes: Estimated effect from a panel IV regression of log EOI (expression of interest) on the log real wage interacted with a third order polynomial in log population density. The wage is instrumented with the average log real wage in other commuting zones and other SOC-6s for the same firm interacted with a third order polynomial in log population density. We control for log days posted, $\\mathrm{CZ}\\times$ six-digit ${\\mathrm{SOC}}\\times{\\mathrm{job}}$ title fixed effects and year-quarter fixed effects. Data are for the period 2010:I-2013:IV. We cluster standard errors at the $\\mathrm{CZ}\\times$ six-digit SOC level.  \n\nthe results are consistent with 80 percent of workers working in markets with substantial monopsony power. Above the eightieth percentile of the population density, the application elasticity increases with population density, reaching about four for the most densely populated areas. Even the most densely populated areas have nowhere near an infinite elasticity of applications with respect to the posted wage.  \n\nWe then use those elasticities as the dependent variable in two cross-sectional regressions. Since it is difficult to reliably estimate an elasticity for very small markets, we restrict the sample to CZ-SOC-6s with at least 50 observations. To account for the uncertainty around the elasticity estimate, observations are weighted by the inverse variance of the estimated elasticities. Finally, observations with elasticities above the ninety-ninth percentile and below the first percentile of the distribution are dropped from the sample.  \n\nIn the first cross-sectional regression, we examine the relationship between the application elasticity estimated by the residualized regressions described above and the HHI computed from each firm's share of posted vacancies in the market defined by commuting zone,  \n\nTABLE 1—APPLICATION ELASTICITY REGRESSIONS   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"4\">Applicationelasticity</td></tr><tr><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td>log population density</td><td>0.0649</td><td></td><td>0.0162 (0.0641)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>log HHI</td><td>(0.0628)</td><td>-0.219</td><td>-0.215</td><td>-0.218</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.0659)(0.0679)(0.105)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CZfixedeffects Observations</td><td>500</td><td></td><td></td><td>474</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>500</td><td>500</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>R2</td><td>0.002</td><td>0.022</td><td>0.022</td><td>0.350</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTABLE 2—WAGE REGRESSIONS   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"4\">logreal wage</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td>Application elasticity</td><td>0.103 (0.0112)</td><td></td><td>0.0996 (0.0113)</td><td>0.115 (0.0116)</td></tr><tr><td>log HHI</td><td></td><td>-0.0576 (0.0178)</td><td>-0.0358 (0.0167)</td><td>-0.0545 (0.0238)</td></tr><tr><td>CZfixedeffects</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>500</td><td>500</td><td>500</td><td>500</td></tr><tr><td>R2</td><td>0.146</td><td>0.021</td><td>0.154</td><td>0.555</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNotes: Data are for the period 2010:I-2013:IV, aggregated by CZ-SOC-6.

We verify that the elasticity increases with population density: the relationship is positive but not statistically significant (Table i, column 1). As predicted by theory, a higher concentration of employers is negatively associated with the application elasticity (column 2). This suggests that concentration is a contributing factor to firm-level wage-setting power. The concentration-application elasticity relationship is unaffected when we include population density as an explanatory variable for the application elasticity (column 3). The relationship between the application elasticity and the HHI also holds across occupations within a commuting zone (column 4).  \n\nIn the second cross-sectional regression, we regress  observed market-level  wages (again averaged by commuting zone-by-SOC-6)on estimated application elasticities and concentration by labor market. Table 2 shows that the application  elasticity  and  concentration  are each, separately, correlated with posted wages, with the expected signs. Furthermore, when entered together, the application elasticity and concentration both retain their significant effect on wages (column 3), with similar magnitudes. In column 4, we include commuting zone fixed effects, and the results are robust: this shows that the cross-sectional relationship between wages and the two measures of market power is not driven by differential costs of living across geographies or other factors such as productivity that vary systematically across commuting zones.  \n\n## IMI. Discussion and Conclusion  \n\nIn this paper, we estimate the firm-level application elasticity from job-posting data, and we relate our estimates to labor market concentration.The results indicate that labor market concentration is negatively correlated with the application elasticity, and the application elasticity is close to zero in most markets but the most densely-populated. Wages are lower in markets where the application elasticity is lower or labor market concentration is higher, and this relationship persists when comparing occupations within a commuting zone. The results are consistent with the application elasticity and labor market concentration being two measures of labor market power  \n\nOur results also suggest that while that power is likely to be pervasive in labor markets, it could respond to competition policy. This is in contrast to the idea that the power imbalance between employers and workers is such that anti-concentration policy would be powerless against it. The reality is more nuanced: employers do enjoy unilateral power to set wages, but that is reinforced by a lack of competition for labor in the markets where they hire. Therefore, antitrust and competition policy has the potential to increase wages by policing anticompetitive conduct in the labor market, including issues like non-competition agreements and mergers (Marinescu and Hovenkamp 2018; Naidu, Posner, and Weyl 2018).  \n\n## REFERENCES  \n\nAzar, Jose, Ioana Marinescu, and Marshall 1.

We estimate key model parameters by matching the firm-level relationship between labor market share and employment size and wage responses to state corporate tax changes. The model quantitatively replicates quasi-experimental evidence on (i) imperfect productivity-wage pass-through, (ii) strategic behavior of dominant employers, and (ii) the local labor market impact of mergers. We then measure welfare losses relative to the efficient allocation. Accounting for transition dynamics, we quantify welfare losses from labor market power relative to the efficient allocation as roughly 6 percent of lifetime consumption. An analytical decomposition attributes equal parts to dead-weight losses and misallocation. Lastly, we find that declining local concentration added 4 ppt to labor's share of income between 1977 and 2013.  \n\nDavid W.

Market is defined as a commuting zone and NAICS 3-digit industry. See Appendix C for additional details. Table A2 provides additional data on employment HHI's.  \n\nIn the average local labor market in the U.S., there are many firms but employment and wages are concentrated in only a few. Defining a labor market as a commuting zone and three-digit industry, the average number of firms is over 100, while the weighted average level of market concentration is 0.11, the same level of concentration one would observe with only 9 equally sized firms (Figure 1).1 This has led to the growing concern that these firms may exert \"labor market power\" over their workers, generating large welfare losses.2 In this paper, we measure the amount of oligopsony power in labor markets and quantify its consequences for welfare. We do so by developing a tractable, quantitative, general equilibrium model with differentially concentrated local labor markets in which firms behave strategically under an oligopsony equilibrium. These novel features allow the model to match empirical regularities in the labor literature such as incomplete wage pass-through and strategic competitor wage responses that a standard monopsony model misses. The model delivers a structurally consistent formulation of labor market power and a framework for understanding the mechanisms behind potential Welfarelosses.  \n\nOur benchmark oligopsony model features two sources of market power. The first is classical monopsony: atomistically small firms face upward sloping labor supply curves due to preference heterogeneity, which they internalize (Burdett and Mortensen, 1998; Manning, 2003; Card, Cardoso, Heining, and Kline, 2018; Lamadon, Mogstad, and Setzler, 2019). Optimal wages are a markdown relative to competitive Wages, i.e. the marginal revenue product of labor. Second, motivated by Figure 1 and the focus of this paper, is oligopsony: firms are non-atomistic and compete strategically for workers, further internalizing how they expect other employers to respond to their hiring and wage policies. This strategic interaction leads to large equilibrium markdowns at the most productive firms and provides a second source of welfare loss. Understanding the welfare consequences of labor market power requires understanding how these markdowns vary across firms. In our model, the markdown is an exact function of the structural labor supply elasticity that a firm faces in equilibrium which—via a closed-form—depends on the firm's observable labor market share and parameters that determine how easily labor is reallocated across- (0) and within- $(\\eta)$ markets.  \n\nWe estimate the model on U.S. Census data, and derive three main results. First, the framework is quantitatively consistent with documented empirical regularities suggestive of oligopsony: incomplete Wage pass-through, strategic competitor wage responses, and size-dependent post-merger wage dynamics. A monopsony version of our model cannot qualitatively match these empirical regularities. Second, the model implies substantial welfare losses from labor market power, both across steady states and along the transition path to an efficient allocation. Welfare losses are large, ranging from 4 to 9 percent of lifetime consumption depending on wealth effects. A representative agent counterpart to our economy delivers equilibrium aggregate prices and quantities and decomposes welfare loss into two components: (1) a dead-weight loss due to average markdowns, (2) a misallocation effect due to wider markdowns at more productive firms. While the former exists under monopsony, the latter does not. We show that both channels account equally for welfare losses. Third, despite these large losses, we find that labor market power has not contributed to the declining labor share. Despite the backdrop of stable national concentration, we find that the model-consistent measure of local concentration, which we measure for the first time, has declined over the last 35 years, indicating that most local labor markets are more competitive than they were in the 1970s.3  \n\nIn terms of the general equilibrium theory of the model, we prove two properties that are central to our main applications. First, we show that our model is block recursive, meaning that local labor market equilibrium is independent of aggregates. This allows us to estimate the model quickly and decompose welfare for arbitrary aggregate preferences. Second, we provide a closed-form relationship between labor's share of income and local payroll concentration. Our model-relevant measure of payroll concentration is new to the literature. We use our formula to measure the contribution of changes in local payroll concentration on labor's share of income.  \n\nIn terms of estimation of the model, strategic interaction complicates the identification of the key parameters by violating exclusion restrictions that are otherwise applicable in monopsonistically competitive models. We address this issue by integrating into our structural estimation the first reducedform estimates of the size dependence of employment and wage responses to state corporate taxes. We estimate our key parameters using U.S. Census Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) micro data (see Figure 2). Given a quasi-experiment that yields an identified shock to labor demand, a researcher can estimate reduced-form labor supply elasticities off of relative employment and wage responses. The literature so far has assumed a special case of our model: firms do not behave strategically, rationalized by infinitely many firms in each labor market.4 This assumption abstracts from competitor equilibrium best responses, and implies that empirically estimated reduced-form elasticities are equal to structural elasticities, so one can move directly from empirical analysis to welfare analysis. In the more general case of granular labor markets, there is no closed-form mapping between (observed) reduced-form elasticities and (unobserved) structural elasticities.5 A model is needed to account for the equilibrium best responses that determine the mapping between underlying structural parameters and the reduced-form elasticities Weobserve.  \n\n![](images/24243d2f5ec435b21cdeef8c7c05456628976726c85ab6b4a618821c6d85f6a4.jpg)  \nFigure 2: Estimation strategy  \n\nOur approach is therefore indirect inference. Our quasi-experiment is an extension of Giroud and Rauh (2019). We exploit state corporate tax rate changes to estimate reduced-form elasticities. We extend their methodology to characterize how they relate to a firm's local labor market share. We then simulate tax changes in our model and determine the structural parameters that minimize the distance between the profile of reduced-form elasticities by market share in model and data. The estimated model is then used to compute structural elasticities, markdowns, and conduct welfare counterfactuals.6  \n\nThis departure from the literature contributes three additional results. First, in the data, responses of firms to labor demand shocks vary systematically: firms with smaller market shares have statistically significantly larger reduced-form elasticities than firms with larger market shares. Second, in our particular experiment, reduced-form elasticities at small firms are around 2, but welfare-relevant structural elasticities are around 7. Filtering the data through the model is necessary to uncover the high labor supply elasticities faced by small firms. Third, we explore bias in more common empirical settings that exploit purely idiosyncratic variation. Here results are different; when we account for the new market equilibrium, structural elasticities are always less than empirically estimated reduced-form elasticities, often by a large amount. A researcher using reduced-form estimates for welfare analysis would infer flat labor supply curves and understate the degree of labor market power.  \n\nWe validate the estimated model by replicating three reduced-form experiments that distinguish oligopsony from monopsonistic competition and find in all cases that our model estimates are within the $95\\%$ confidence interval of the published estimates. First, we replicate the 0.47 pass-through from log value added per worker to log wages in Kline, Petkova, Williams, and Zidar (2019), producing 0.61 in our model. Second, we replicate the 0.13 response elasticity of competing hospital's wages to VA hospital wage increases in Staiger, Spetz, and Phibbs (2010), producing 0.07 in our model. Third, we replicate the 0.8 percent decline in worker wages following a merger in Arnold (2020a), producing a 1.3 percent decline in our model, and matching a 3 times larger decline in more concentrated markets. Theoretically, we prove that a monopsonistically competitive economy features a pass-through of one, a competitor response elasticity of zero, and no effect of mergers on competitors. These tests provide evidence that oligopsony is necessary to fit key empirical regularities in the reduced-form literature.  \n\nWith our model calibrated to aggregates and local labor markets, we define the welfare loss due to labor market power as the consumption subsidy required to make households indifferent between the oligopsonistic economy and the efficient allocation that a planner would choose. Comparing steady states at an aggregate Frisch elasticity of labor supply of 0.50, we measure a welfare loss of 7.0 percent. Competitive equilibrium wages, output and labor supply are significantly greater. Welfare losses are slightly lower (5.7 percent) when accounting for macroeconomic transition dynamics between these two labor market structures. We show that these results are robust to aggregate preferences being of Greenwood Hercowitz Huffman (1988, henceforth GHH) or balanced growth types.7  \n\nWe explore the mechanisms underlying these large welfare losses using a novel representative agent counterpart to our economy. We decompose output losses into two components. The first component is an aggregate markdown which reflects pure dead-weight loss from oligopsony power. The second component is an aggregate efficiency loss that reflects misallocation. Productive firms have the most labor market power and widest markdowns. They therefore restrict employment the most. This results in an inefficient under allocation of employment at the most productive firms and the wider the productivity distribution, the larger the wage mark-downs and subsequent efficiency losses. Overall, We find that roughly 50 percent of welfare losses are driven by misallocation, 40 percent are due to pure markdowns, and the remainder is due to their interaction.8 This would not be the case in a standard monopsonistically competitive environment. We show that the misallocation effect is zero under monopsonistic competition, so strategic interactions and markdown heterogeneity account for roughly half of the losses observed.  \n\nA symptom of the misallocation present in the benchmark economy is that the planner's solution has greater concentration, employment, and wages. In the oligopsonistic economy, large firms are inefficiently small, so any policy that decentralizes the efficient allocation would reallocate more employment to already large firms. Aggregate concentration roughly doubles, employment increases by 11 percent and the average wage increases by 48 percent.  \n\nWe conclude by applying the model to study the relationship between local labor market concentration and the labor share. Despite large welfare losses from labor market power, we find that declining local labor market concentration between 1977 and 2013 increased labor's share of income. First, letting our model guide measurement, we show that the distribution of market-level payroll Herfindahls can be used to compute a sufficient statistic for labor's share of income, with a relationship that is independent of the aggregate labor supply elasticity and wealth effects.? Second, the model implies that these micro measures should be aggregated using market-level payroll weights, shown in red in Figure 1B. We construct this model relevant concentration measure directly from the Census LBD and find it has declined from 0.16 to 0.11 between 1977 and 2013.10 Ignoring these weights would double the level of concentration and imply a stable trend.11 We feed our measure into our formula for labor's share of income under the estimated preference parameters $(\\theta,\\eta)$ . We find that declining local labor market concentration would have implied a counterfactual 4 percentage point increase in labor's share of income. Changing labor market concentration is not behind the declining labor share.12  \n\nWe review the literature and then proceed as follows. Sections 1 lays out the model and characterizes the equilibrium. Section 2 provides empirical estimates of the relationship between reduced-form labor supply elasticities and market share, then combine this relationship and our new concentration statistics to parameterize the model. Section 3 validates the model via replication of three empirical studies. Section 4 presents our main welfare measurement exercises. Section 5 applies the model to measure welfare-relevant aggregate concentration and the labor share.  \n\nLiterature.  Our work is related to a growing literature that explores the implications of market power. In the product market, Gutiérrez and Philippon (2017); Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson, and Van Reenen (2020) all document an increase in national sales concentration and a fall in the labor share across many industries, while De Loecker, Eeckhout, and Unger (2020) document an increase in product market power more directly by measuring firm markups. Consistent with our findings, concurrent work by Rossi-Hansberg, Sarte, and Trachter (2018) documents declining regional employment concentration, despite rising national concentration. In the labor market, several concurrent studies have documented cross-sectional and time-series patterns of U.s. Herfindahls in employment (Benmelech, Bergman, and Kim, 2020; Rinz, 2018; Hershbein, Macalus0, and Yeh, 2020) and vacancies (Azar, Marinescu, Steinbaum, and Taska, 2020; Azar, Marinescu, and Steinbaum, 2020). Brooks, Kaboski, Li, and Qian (2019), Hershbein, Macaluso, and Yeh (2020), and Chan, Salgado, and Xu (2020) use tools from industrial organization to identify wage markdowns and heterogeneous pass-through rates consistent with the theory in this paper. Our contributions to this literature are (i) a new, model consistent, measure of U.S. labor market concentration, which we use to (i) quantitatively measure the welfare losses associated with labor market power. In general, the exercises in our paper issue a warning against qualitatively mapping changes in concentration into a change in welfare.  \n\nOur work is also related to a large literature measuring reduced-form labor supply elasticities of individual firms (Staiger, Spetz, and Phibbs, 2010; Webber, 2015; Card, Cardoso, Heining, and Kline, 2018; Suarez Serrato and Zidar, 2016; Dube, Jacobs, Naidu, and Suri, 2020). We provide new estimates of measured labor supply elasticities by building on the approach of Giroud and Rauh (2019), who find significant effects of state corporate taxes on firm-state employment.13 Our contributions to this empirical literature are (i) estimates of the share-dependency of measured elasticities that point to large firms having more market power (i to demonstrate that if markets have firms that interact strategically, there can be a large disconnect between measured labor supply elasticities and the structural elasticities that are relevant for welfare. This is a substantive point: the empirical literature cited above typically measures labor supply elasticities that are small. If structural elasticities were equal to these reducedform elasticities, then labor market power would be extremely high.14 We describe empirical designs under which (i) reduced-form estimates of labor supply elasticities may be biased downwards relative to structural elasticities, and even then, (i) that structural elasticities vary systematically with the firm's labor market share, and show that this reconciles the range and level of empirical estimates.  \n\nFinally, our work is related to the large literature that models monopsony in labor markets. We depart from benchmark models of monopsony described in (Burdett and Mortensen, 1998; Manning, 2003; Card, Cardoso, Heining, and Kline, 2018; Lamadon, Mogstad, and Setzler, 2019; Kroft, Luo, Mogstad, and Setzler, 2020) by explicitly modeling a finite set of employers that compete strategically for workers. We demonstrate that this addition is crucial for identification: strategic interaction and finiteness of firms jointly imply that reduced-form empirical estimates of labor supply elasticities from any shock cannot be used to infer the (structural) labor supply elasticities firms face—and hence identify preference parameters—except in the limiting case of monopsonistic competition between infinitesimally sized firms. Additionally, our assumptions allow us to (i) interpret granular measures of concentration, such as Herfindahl indexes, and (i) accommodate a planning problem that allows us to define an efficient benchmark.  \n\nOur main quantitative contribution is to build a general equilibrium model of oligopsony and measure the welfare costs of current levels of U.S. labor market power.15 Our framework extends the general tools developed in Atkeson and Burstein (2008) to the labor market, adding multiple non-trivial features: capital, corporate taxes, decreasing returns to scale, seting the model in general equilibrium, and studying transition dynamics between steady states. Recent related work by Jarosch, Nimcsik, and Sorkin (2019) considers non-atomistic firms, but adapts a random search model to construct a search-theoretic measure of labor market power. We view our papers as complementary.  \n\nOur model features firm-specific upward sloping labor supply curves. This is supported by numerous recent studies using (quasi-)experimental approaches.16 Belot, Kircher, and Muller (2017) randomly assign higher wages to observationally equivalent vacancies on an actual job-board and find that higher Wage vacancies attract more applicants. Dube, Jacobs, Naidu, and Suri (2020) and Banfi and VillenaRoldan (2018) also find job-specific upward sloping labor supply curves in well-identified contexts.17  \n\nFinally, our quantitative model features strategic complementarity between oligopsonists. Strategic complementarity in labor markets is not new to the theoretical literature. The earliest models used to motivate monopsony power were Robinson (1933) and the spatial economies of Hotelling (1990) and Salop (1979).18 Our contribution relative to these stylized single-market models, is a quantitative general equilibrium framework. We incorporate firm heterogeneity, decreasing returns to scale, and general equilibrium across multiple markets, such that the model is rich enough to be estimated on U.S. Census data. Moreover, by modeling a finite set of employers, our model may be used in the future to understand the wage and welfare effects of mergers, firm exit, and other shocks to local labor market competition. Very recent work by Azkarate-Askasua and Zerecero (2020) and MacKenzie (2019) also estimate models with strategic interactions using French and Indian data, respectively. Our contribution is to develop a quantitative general equilibrium framework and develop a methodology to consistently estimate the underlying preference parameters governing oligopsony.  \n\n## 1 Model  \n\n### 1.1 Environment  \n\nAgents. The economy consists of a representative household and a continuum of firms. The household consists of a unit measure of atomistic, homogeneous workers each with one unit of labor supply. Firms are heterogeneous in two dimensions. First, firms inhabit a continuum of local labor markets $j\\in[0,1]$ each with an exogenous and finite number of firms indexed $i\\in\\{1,2,\\ldots,m_{j}\\}$ . Second, firms′ productivities $z_{i j t}~\\in~(0,\\infty)$ are drawn from a location invariant distribution $F(z)$ .The only $e x$ -antedifference between markets is the number of firms $m_{j}\\in\\{1,\\ldots,\\infty\\}$ . Time subscripts are necessary in that we study welfare counterfactuals on transition paths between steady-states, but productivity and number of firms are constant at the firm- and market-level, respectively.  \n\nGoods and technology.  The continuum of firms produce tradeable goods that are perfect substitutes, and so trade in a perfectly competitive national market at a price $P_{t}$ that we normalize to one. Firms operate a value-added production function that uses inputs of capital $k_{i j t}$ and labor $n_{i j t}$ 19 A firm produces $y_{i j t}$ units of net-output (value-added) according to the production function:  \n\n$$\ny_{i j t}=z_{i j t}\\left(k_{i j t}^{1-\\gamma}n_{i j t}^{\\gamma}\\right)^{\\alpha}\\quad,\\quad\\gamma\\in(0,1)\\quad,\\quad\\alpha>0.\n$$  \n\nThe degree of returns to scale $\\alpha$ is unrestricted and later estimated. The household uses these goods for consumption and investment. Investment augments the capital stock $K_{t},$ which is rented to firms in a competitive market at price $R_{t}$ and depreciates at rate $\\delta$ . To the best of our knowledge this is the first paper to model imperfect competition, either in input or output markets, with finitely many firms and decreasing returns to scale in general equilibrium. To model imperfect competition we extend tools developed in the trade literature (Atkeson and Burstein, 2008).  \n\n### 1.2 Household  \n\nPreferences and problem. The household chooses the measure of workers to supply to each firm $n_{i j t},$ investment in next period capital $K_{t+1},$ and consumption of each good $c_{i j t}$ to maximize their net present value of utility. Given an initial capital stock $K_{0}$ , the household solves  \n\n$$\n{\\mathcal{U}}_{0}=\\operatorname*{max}_{\\left\\{{{n}_{i j t}},{{c}_{i j t}},{{K}_{t+1}}\\right\\}}\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty}{{{\\beta}^{t}}U\\Big({{C}_{t}},{{N}_{t}}\\Big)}\n$$  \n\nwhere the aggregate consumption and labor supply indexes are given by:  \n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1}\\left[c_{1j t}+\\cdot\\cdot+c_{m,j t}\\right]d j,N_{t}:=\\left[\\int_{0}^{1}n_{j t}^{\\frac{\\theta+1}{\\theta}}d j\\right]^{\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta+1}},n_{j t}:=\\left[n_{1j t}^{\\frac{\\eta+1}{\\eta}}+\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot+n_{m,j t}^{\\frac{\\eta+1}{\\eta}}\\right]^{\\frac{\\eta}{\\eta+1}},\n$$  \n\nand maximization is subject to the household's budget constraint in each period:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}{C_{t}+\\Big[K_{t+1}-(1-\\delta)K_{t}\\Big]}&{=}&{\\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{1}\\Big[w_{1j t}n_{1j t}+\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot+w_{m_{j}j t}n_{m_{j}j t}\\Big]d j+R_{t}K_{t}+\\Pi_{t}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFirm profits, $\\Pi_{t},$ are rebated lump sum to the household. The function $U$ is twice continuously differentiable with standard properties.20 The consumption index captures perfect substitutability of consumption goods, such that our assumption of a single market price $P_{t}=1$ is valid.21  \n\nNotation. Aggregate variables are denoted in upper-case, and firm- and market-level in lower-case. Bold fonts are used for indexes, which are book-keeping devices, not directly observable in the raw data, but can be constructed from observables. For example, the disutility of labor supply $N_{t}$ does not correspond to any aggregates reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, given parameters, $N_{t}$ can be constructed from the universe of firm-level employment $\\{{n}_{i j t}\\}$ . We denote aggregate labor computed by adding bodies as unbolded: $\\begin{array}{r}{N_{t}=\\sum_{i j}n_{i j t}}\\end{array}$  \n\nOptimality conditions. The first order necessary conditions of the household problem describe the supply of labor and capital:  \n\n$$\n-\\frac{U_{N}\\left(C_{t},N_{t}\\right)}{U_{C}\\left(C_{t},N_{t}\\right)}\\frac{\\partial N_{t}}{\\partial n_{j t}}\\frac{\\partial n_{j t}}{\\partial n_{i j t}}=w_{i j t}\\quad,\\quad U_{C}\\left(C_{t},N_{t}\\right)=\\beta U_{C}\\left(C_{t+1},N_{t+1}\\right)\\left[R_{t}+\\left(1-\\delta\\right)\\right]\n$$  \n\nLabor supply. Under the assumed structure of preferences, we can express the set of labor supply conditions across all firms more economically as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{V}_{t})}{\\mathrm{V}_{t})}=W_{t}\\quad\\mathrm{and}\\quad\\quad n_{i j t}=\\left(\\frac{w_{i j t}}{w_{j t}}\\right)^{\\eta}\\left(\\frac{w_{j t}}{W_{t}}\\right)^{\\theta}N_{t}\\quad\\quad\\leftrightarrow\\:w_{i j t}=\\left(\\frac{n_{i j t}}{n_{j t}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\eta}}\\left(\\frac{n_{j t}}{N_{t}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\theta}}W\n$$  \n\nFirm labor supply for all $i=1,\\ldots,m_{j},j\\in[0,1]$  \n\nGiven aggregate labor supply, the firm labor supply curve includes two book-keeping terms: the market wage index ${\\boldsymbol{w}}_{j t}$ and aggregate wage index $W_{t}$ . These are defined as the numbers that satisfy  \n\n$$\nw_{j t}n_{j t}:=\\sum_{i\\in j}w_{i j t}n_{i j t}\\qquad,\\qquadW_{t}N_{t}:=\\int_{0}^{1}w_{j t}n_{j t}d j.\n$$  \n\nTogether with optimality conditions (4) the definitions imply  \n\n$$\nw_{j t}=\\left[\\sum_{i\\in j}w_{i j t}^{1+\\eta}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{1+\\eta}}\\quad\\quad,\\quad\\quad W_{t}=\\left[\\int_{0}^{1}w_{j t}^{1+\\theta}d j\\right]^{\\frac{1}{1+\\theta}}.\n$$  \n\nSince labor market competition is Cournot, firms choose quantities taking their inverse labor supply curve (4) into account. For full derivations see Appendix E.1.  \n\nExplicit Microfoundation. In Appendix B, we show that the supply system described by equations (4) and (5) can be obtained in an environment with heterogeneous workers making independent decisions, providing an exact map between $\\eta$ and $\\theta$ and the distribution of relative net costs to individuals of moving between and across markets.22 The micro-foundation makes clear that workers are not confined to particular markets. The limitation that markets impose is on the boundary of the strategic behavior of firms. Within markets firms are strategic, but with respect to firms in the continuum of other markets, firms are price takers.  \n\nElasticities. The firm labor supply curve is upward sloping and features two elasticities of substitution $\\eta>0$ and $\\theta>0$ . These jointly affect the labor market power of firms. Both across and within markets, the lower the degree of substitutability, the greater the market power of firms. Across-market substitutability $\\theta$ stands in for mobility costs across markets, which are often estimated to be significant (Kennan and Walker, 2011). As such costs increase $(\\theta\\rightarrow0)$ ), the household minimizes labor disutility $N_{t}$ by choosing an equal division of workers across markets: $\\pmb{n}_{j t}=\\pmb{n}_{j^{\\prime}t},\\forall j,j^{\\prime}\\in[0,1]$ .This imparts the largest degree of local labor market power as market-by-market market-level employment becomes perfectly inelastic and unresponsive to across-market wage differences. As substitutability approaches infinity, the representative household optimally sends all workers to the market with the highest wage, eroding market power of firms in competing markets.  \n\nWithin-market substitutability $\\eta$ stands in for within-market, across-firm mobility costs such as the job search process (Burdett and Mortensen, 1998), some degree of non-generality of accumulated human capital (Becker, 1962), or preference heterogeneity in the form of worker-firm specific amenities or commuting costs (Robinson, 1933). As these costs increase $(\\eta\\rightarrow0)$ , the household minimizes within-market disutility ${\\pmb n}_{j t}$ by choosing an equal division of workers across firms: $n_{i j t}=n_{i^{\\prime}j t},\\forall i,i^{\\prime}\\in\\{1,2,...m_{j}\\}$ This generates the largest degree of monopsony power to firms within a market. Regardless of its wage, firm- $\\cdot i j$ will employ the same number of workers, allowing it to pay less while maintaining its workforce. As substitutability increases, competition tightens as workers are reallocated toward firms with higher wages.  \n\nRegardless of $\\theta$ , in the limit as $\\eta\\rightarrow\\infty$ , local labor markets tend to perfect competition. In this limit, marginal revenue products are equalized across firms at a single market wage $w_{i j}={w_{j}}$ . This is possible with productivity heterogeneity due to decreasing returns as in Hopenhayn (1992). A model without decreasing returns would mistakenly infer labor market power from the fact that there is productivity heterogeneity and many firms operate in each market.  \n\n### 1.3Firms  \n\nIn order to maximize profits, firms choose how much capital to rent, $k_{i j t},$ and the number of workers to hire $n_{i j t}$ . Infinitesimal with respect to the macroeconomy, firms take the aggregate wage $W_{t}$ and labor supply $N_{t}$ as given. Since the equilibrium concept is Cournot, they also take as given their competitors? employment decisions, which we denote n\\* jt  \n\nThe firm maximizes profits:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{\\pi_{i j t}}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{max}_{n_{i j t},k_{i j}}\\underbrace{z_{i j t}\\left(k_{i j t}^{1-\\gamma}n_{i j t}^{\\gamma}\\right)^{\\alpha}}_{\\mathrm{Volue~added:}y_{i j t}}-R_{t}k_{i j t}-w\\left(n_{i j t},n_{-i j t}^{*},N_{t},W_{t}\\right)n_{i j t}.}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{\\pi_{-i j t}^{*},N_{t},W_{t}\\right)}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\left(\\frac{n_{i j t}}{n\\left(n_{i j t},n_{-i j t}^{*}\\right)}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\eta}}\\left(\\frac{n_{j t}}{N_{t}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\theta}}W_{t}~,~n\\left(n_{i j t},n_{-i j t}^{*}\\right)=\\left[n_{i j t}^{\\frac{\\eta+1}{\\eta}}+\\sum_{k\\neq i}n_{k}^{*},\\right.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\ns.t.  \n\nThe first order necessary conditions of the firm problem describe its demand for capital and labor:  \n\n$$\nR_{t}=\\alpha(1-\\gamma)\\frac{y_{i j t}}{k_{i j t}}\\quad,\\quad w_{i j t}+\\frac{\\partial w_{i j t}}{\\partial n_{i j t}}\\biggr|_{n_{-i j t}^{*}}n_{i j t}=\\alpha\\gamma\\frac{y_{i j t}}{n_{i j t}}.\n$$  \n\nThe firm has a standard competitive demand for capital, but since the firm has market power in the labor market, its marginal cost of labor accounts for both the wage and the additional cost associated with increasing wages. This requires an equilibrium marginal revenue product of labor that exceeds the Wage alone. The standard re-arrangement of the labor demand condition yields a Lerner condition for the wage as a markdown $\\mu_{i j t}\\leq1$ on the marginal product of labor:  \n\n$$\nw_{i j t}=\\mu_{i j t}\\alpha\\gamma\\frac{y_{i j t}}{n_{i j t}}\\quad,\\quad\\mu_{i j t}=\\frac{\\varepsilon_{i j t}}{\\varepsilon_{i j t}+1}\\quad,\\quad\\varepsilon_{i j t}:=\\left[\\frac{\\partial\\log w_{i j t}}{\\partial\\log n_{i j t}}\\biggr|_{n_{-i j t}^{*}}\\right]^{-1}.\n$$  \n\nUnder our specification of preferences, the elasticity and markdown have closed-form expressions that depend only on firms' payroll share $s_{i j t}$ in the market, with larger firms having wider markdowns:  \n\n$$\n=\\left[\\frac{1}{\\eta}+\\left(\\frac{1}{\\theta}-\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\right)\\frac{\\partial\\log n_{j t}}{\\partial\\log n_{i j t}}\\right|_{n_{-i j t}^{*}}\\right]^{-1}=\\left[\\frac{1}{\\eta}+\\left(\\frac{1}{\\theta}-\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\right)s_{i j t}\\right]^{-1},s_{i j t}:=\\frac{w_{i j t}n_{i j t}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{m_{j}}w_{i j t}n_{i j t}}\n$$  \n\nWe characterize the solution of the economy in thre steps: partial equilibrium, market equilibrium, and general equilibrium.  \n\n### 1.4  Characterization - Partial equilibrium  \n\nIt will be useful to substitute the firms' capital demand condition into its profits (6), which gives:  \n\n$\\pi_{i j t}=\\operatorname*{max}_{n_{i j t}}\\:\\widetilde{z}_{i j t}n_{i j t}^{\\widetilde{\\alpha}}-w_{i j t}n_{i j t}$ ， subject to the inverse labor supply curve (4).  \n\nwhere we introduce the auxiliary parameters $\\{\\widetilde{\\alpha},\\widetilde{z}_{i j t}\\}$  \n\n$$\n\\widetilde{\\alpha}:=\\frac{\\gamma\\alpha}{1-\\left(1-\\gamma\\right)\\alpha}\\quad,\\quad\\widetilde{z}_{i j t}:=\\left[1-\\left(1-\\gamma\\right)\\alpha\\right]\\left(\\frac{\\left(1-\\gamma\\right)\\alpha}{R_{t}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\left(1-\\gamma\\right)\\alpha}{1-\\left(1-\\gamma\\right)\\alpha}}z_{i j t}^{\\frac{1}{1-\\left(1-\\gamma\\right)\\alpha}}.\n$$  \n\n![](images/dbc0d6998588218e92d52a9d136cf9dede67f8ca4ed9660b03215bf07c8d2c19.jpg)  \nFigure 3: Firm level optimality  \n\nWe can then express the markdown $(\\mu_{i j t}\\in(0,1))$ , marginal and average product of labor as:23  \n\n$$\nw_{i j t}=\\mu\\left(s_{i j t}\\right)m r p l_{i j t}\\qquad,\\qquadm r p l_{i j t}=\\widetilde{\\alpha}\\widetilde{z}_{i j t}n_{i j t}^{\\widetilde{\\alpha}-1}\\qquad,\\qquada r p l_{i j t}=\\frac{1}{\\widetilde{\\alpha}}m r p l_{i j t}\n$$  \n\nwith the same formulas as above determining the markdown.  \n\nFigure 3 characterizes firm optimality. Decreasing returns implies a downward sloping marginal revenue product of labor strictly below the average revenue product. Firms internalize their upward sloping labor supply curve, so their marginal cost of labor is also upward sloping and lies strictly above labor supply which describes the average cost of labor. At the margin, a unit of labor costs more than just the higher wage paid to the marginal worker, since the firm must increase wages paid to all workers. As such, choosing $n_{i j t}$ so that labor's marginal revenue product equals its marginal cost necessarily implies a markdown of the wage relative to marginal revenue product. The firm then earns profits of $a r p l_{i j}-w_{i j}=(a r p l_{i j}-m r p l_{i j})+(m r p l_{i j}-w_{i j})$ from each worker, with a contribution due to the gap between average and marginal revenue products, and a gap due to the markdown.  \n\nThese markdowns constitute our measure of firm level labor market power, and depend on firm characteristics. As we have established, in the Cournot Nash equilibrium, they are determined by the equilibrium (inverse) labor supply elasticity faced by the firm $\\left(1/\\varepsilon_{i j t}\\right)$ at the equilibrium allocation. This depends on a firm's own (observable) market share as well as the degree of within-market $(\\eta)$ and across-market (0) labor substitutability. This can be seen by returning to Figure 3. Panel A describes the equilibrium outcomes for a low productivity firm. Relative to the high productivity firm in panel B, the low productivity firm has a lower $m r p l_{i j}$ for any $n_{i j}$ . In equilibrium, it has both lower wages $w_{i j}^{*},$ and lower employment $n_{i j}^{*},$ so its share of wage payments $s_{i j}^{*},$ is smaller. With a smaller share of the labor market Wage payments, its partial equilibrium elasticity of labor supply is higher, and its inverse labor supply curve is flatter. A flatter inverse supply curve yields a narrower markdown at its optimal labor demand, $n_{i j}^{\\ast}$ The larger firm faces an endogenously steeper supply curve and hires more workers at higher wages but at a wider markdown. A key property of this equilibrium is that a larger share of employment is at  \n\nwide markdown firms.  \n\n### 1.5   Characterization - Market equilibrium  \n\nGiven firm optimality, we establish properties of the market equilibrium and provide an example which illustrates strategic interactions within the market.  \n\nProposition 1.1. Block recursivity. In each market $j\\in[0,1]$ , the equilibrium market shares $s_{1j t},\\ldots,s_{m_{j}j t}$ satisfy the following $m_{j}$ equations:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\underbrace{\\left[\\mu(s_{i j t})^{1-(1-\\gamma)\\alpha}z_{i j t}\\right]^{\\frac{\\eta+1}{(1-\\alpha)(\\eta+1)+\\alpha\\gamma}}}_{\\textit{j}},\\mu(s_{i j t})=\\frac{\\varepsilon(s_{i j t})}{\\varepsilon(s_{i j t})+1},\\varepsilon(s_{i j t})=\\left[s_{i j t}\\theta^{-1}+(1-s_{i j t})\\eta^{-1}\\right]^{-\\gamma}}\\ &{=1\\left[\\mu(s_{k j t})^{1-(1-\\gamma)\\alpha}z_{k j t}\\right]^{\\frac{\\eta+1}{(1-\\alpha)(\\eta+1)+\\alpha\\gamma}},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThis system is independent of aggregate oariables, and hence the joint distribution $\\{\\mu_{i j t},z_{i j t}\\}_{\\forall i j}$ is determined under market equilibrium. Moreover, the payroll share of labor at the market level and market payrollconcentration are given by the following, and hence independent of aggregates:  \n\n$$\nl s_{j}=\\frac{\\sum_{i\\in j}w_{i j}n_{i j}}{\\sum_{i\\in j}y_{i j}}=\\left[\\sum_{i\\in j}s_{i j}l s_{i j}^{-1}\\right]^{-1}=\\alpha\\gamma\\Bigl[\\sum_{i\\in j}s_{i j}\\mu_{i j}^{-1}\\Bigr]^{-1}\\quad,\\quad h h i_{j}=\\sum_{i\\in j}s_{i j}^{2}.\n$$  \n\nProposition (1.1) establishes that the equilibrium of the model is block recursive in that the market equilibrium can be solved without knowledge of aggregate variables. For the proof see Appendix E.3. This has three significant implications. First, solving the Nash equilibrium in a large J number of markets is computationally expensive. Proposition (1.1) says that this need only be done once. Second, the aggregate economy can be arbitrarily rich, and feature transition dynamics that do not require re-solving the J market equilibria. Third, if it can be shown that an aggregate moment of the economy only depends on the joint distribution of markdowns and productivity, then we know that such moments are robust to alternative assumptions on preferences and capital accumulation. Below we will use only these types of moments in our calibration, so that our calibration is robust to assumptions on preferences.  \n\nThe logic underlying the proof of this proposition is that we can consider the equilibrium for the firm as a recursive set of equations that determine the marginal revenue product of labor:  \n\n$$\nm r p l_{i j t}=\\widetilde{\\alpha}\\widetilde{z}_{i j t}n_{i j t}^{\\widetilde{\\alpha}-1}\\quad,\\quad n_{i j t}=\\left(\\frac{w_{i j t}}{w_{j t}}\\right)^{\\eta}n_{j t}\\quad,\\quad w_{i j t}=\\mu(s_{i j t})m r p l_{i j t}.\n$$  \n\nThis system implies a multiplicative relationship between $m r p l_{i j}$ and the factors common to all firms in the market: ${\\boldsymbol{{w}}_{j t}},{\\boldsymbol{{n}}_{j t}}$ . Since payroll shares can be expressed in terms of relative wages $s_{i j t}=(w_{i j t}/w_{j t})^{(1+\\eta)},$ the homotheticity of ${\\boldsymbol{w}}_{j t}$ implies that these common factors drop out. For a full proof see Appendix E.  \n\nDecreasing returns. The expression for equilibrium payroll shares in Proposition 1.1 is new, and extends such expressions in constant returns oligopoly models to the case of oligopsony, multiple inputs, and decreasing returns. It also provides a novel link between returns to scale and concentration. Consider startingwith $\\alpha<1$ and $\\gamma=1$ , such that labor is the sole input to production. Now consider the  \n\n![](images/99383a926f07cdf89e6fad5f1bc4ca80d8c3eb35374a53634a332ba7a4b77996.jpg)  \nFigure 4: Oligopsonistic market equilibrium in three labor markets  \n\nNotes: Figure constructed from model under estimated parameters (Table 3). Low, medium and high productivities of the firms correspond to the $10^{t h}$ $50^{t h}$ and $90^{t h}$ percentiles o the productivity distribution.  \n\ncomparative static of increasing $\\alpha$ to $\\alpha^{\\prime}\\in(\\alpha,1]$ . With less decreasing returns, more productive firms become larger, accrue a larger labor market share, and pay wider markdowns relative to marginal products. This increases the dispersion in market shares and markdowns in the market, reduces the labor share, and increases concentration.  \n\nExample.  To show how strategic interaction shapes the market equilibrium, Figure 4 plots examples of the equilibrium shares, markdowns, wages, and employment in three markets. The first market has a single low productivity firm (red), the second adds a firm with median productivity (blue), the third an additional high productivity firm (green).24  \n\nConsider the market with a single firm (red). By construction, the wage bill share is one (Panel A). Panel B shows that the markdown on the marginal product of labor is 69 percent, which is equal to $\\theta/\\left(\\theta+1\\right)$ since the firm faces the lower bound on labor supply elasticities, $\\varepsilon(1)=\\theta$ .Panel C shows that wages are low due to low productivity and a wide markdown. Despite this, the relatively inelastic labor supply across markets means the firm still employs many workers (panel D).  \n\nConsider the addition of a firm with higher productivity, a duopsony (blue). The low-productivity firm's labor market share drops to 31 percent, the more productive firm employs the majority of the market, and market employment is higher. As its share falls, the low-productivity firm's markdown narrows to 56 percent, as more competition increases their equilibrium labor supply elasticity toward $\\eta$ . Panel C shows that with no change to its productivity, but with a narrower markdown, the less productive firm's wage increases. Despite this wage increase, the higher wage at its new competitor bids away labor, causing the low productivity firm's employment to fall. Adding another firm (green), the markdown at the low- and mid-productivity firms decline. The largest firm has the widest markdown (Panel B), but pays more (Panel C) and employs more workers (Panel D).  \n\nFigure A2 replicates this exercise with three firms but varying decreasing returns $\\alpha$ .Consistent with our above description, higher $\\alpha$ generates more concentration and wider markdowns at the leading firm  \n\nStrategic interaction is not an assumption, it's an outcome of the environment, and leads to a negative covariance between markdowns and productivity—visible along the green line in Panel B. In equilibrium, strategic interaction occurs by definition of the Nash equilibrium concept when there is local labor marketpower $(\\eta>\\theta)$ and finitely many firms. In a model of monopsonistic competition, the green line Would be flat, as firms all pay identical markdowns. We now make precise how this negative covariance distorts the general equilibrium of the economy.  \n\n### 1.6 General equilibrium  \n\nGiven equilibria in each market of the economy, which determines $\\{\\mu_{i j t},z_{i j t}\\}_{\\forall i j},$ We state our main proposition characterizing the general equilibrium of the economy. For the proof see Appendix E.4.  \n\nProposition 1.2. General equilibrium. The general equilibrium of the model can be characterized in the following three steps:  \n\n1. Using the market equilibria $\\left\\{\\mu_{i j t},z_{i j t}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{m_{j}}$ from all $j\\in[0,1]$ markets in the economy, define the following indexes.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l l l l l l}{{i t y:}}&{{\\widetilde{Z}}}&{{=}}&{{\\left[\\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{1}\\widetilde{z}_{j}^{\\frac{1+\\theta}{1+\\theta(1-\\widetilde{\\alpha})}}d_{j}\\right]^{\\frac{1+\\theta(1-\\widetilde{\\alpha})}{1+\\theta}},}}&{{,}}&{{\\widetilde{z}_{j}=\\left[\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{m_{j}}\\widetilde{z}_{i j}^{\\frac{1+\\eta}{1+\\eta(1-\\widetilde{\\alpha})}}\\right]^{\\frac{1+\\eta(1-\\widetilde{\\alpha})}{1+\\eta}}}}\\ {{w n:}}&{{\\mu}}&{{=}}&{{\\left[\\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{1}\\left(\\frac{\\widetilde{z}_{j}}{\\widetilde{Z}}\\right)^{\\frac{1+\\theta}{1+\\theta(1-\\widetilde{\\alpha})}}\\mu_{j}^{\\frac{1+\\theta}{1+\\theta(1-\\widetilde{\\alpha})}}d_{j}\\right]^{\\frac{1+\\theta(1-\\widetilde{\\alpha})}{1+\\theta}},}}&{{\\mu_{j}=\\left[\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{m_{j}}\\left(\\frac{\\widetilde{z}_{i j}}{\\widetilde{z}_{j}}\\right)^{\\frac{1+\\eta}{1+\\eta(1-\\widetilde{\\alpha})}}\\mu_{i j}^{\\frac{1+\\eta}{1+\\eta(1-\\widetilde{\\alpha})}}\\right]^{\\frac{1+\\eta}{1+\\eta}},}}\\ {{m:}}&{{\\Omega}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{1}\\left(\\frac{\\widetilde{z}_{i j}}{\\widetilde{z}_{j}}\\right)^{\\frac{1+\\theta}{1+\\theta(1-\\widetilde{\\alpha})}}\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{j}}{\\mu}\\right)^{\\frac{\\widetilde{\\alpha}\\theta}{1+\\theta(1-\\widetilde{\\alpha})}}\\omega_{j}d j}}&{{,}}&{{\\omega_{j}=\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{m_{j}}\\left(\\frac{\\widetilde{z}_{i j}}{\\widetilde{z}_{j}}\\right)^{\\frac{1+\\eta}{1+\\eta(1-\\widetilde{\\alpha})}}\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{i j}}{\\mu_{j}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\eta}{1+\\eta(1-\\widetilde{\\alpha})}},}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n2. In steady-state the four aggregate quantities Y, $N$ . C, K and two prices W, $R$ are determined by six equations:  \n\nOutput and resource constraint: $\\begin{array}{l l l l}{{\\displaystyle Y~=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\Omega\\widetilde{Z}N^{\\alpha}=\\Omega^{1-(1-\\gamma)\\alpha}Z\\left(K^{1-\\gamma}N^{\\gamma}\\right)^{\\alpha}}}&{{\\quad,}}&{{\\displaystyle C=Y-\\delta K}}\\ {{\\displaystyle W}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\gamma\\alpha\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\Omega}\\right)\\frac{Y}{N}}}&{{\\quad,}}&{{\\displaystyle R=(1-\\gamma)\\alpha\\frac{Y}{K}\\nonumber}}\\ {{\\displaystyle W}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle-\\frac{U_{N}(C,N)}{U_{C}(C,N)}}}&{{\\quad,}}&{{\\displaystyle1=\\beta[R+(1-\\delta)]}}\\end{array}$ Labor and capital supply:  \n\nwhere aggregate productivity $Z$ satisfies 25  \n\n$$\n{\\cal Z}=\\left[\\frac{R}{(1-\\gamma)\\alpha}\\right]^{(1-\\gamma)\\alpha}\\left[\\frac{\\widetilde{Z}}{1-(1-\\gamma)\\alpha}\\right]^{1-(1-\\gamma)\\alpha}\n$$  \n\n3. Given aggregate quantities and prices firm level variables can be obtained as follows. First, equating market labor demand and market labor supply determines $w_{j}$ and ${\\pmb n}_{j}$ .Then, equating firm labor demand and firm labor supply determines $w_{i j}$ and $n_{i j}$  \n\n$$\nw_{j}=\\underbrace{\\mu_{j}\\widetilde{\\alpha}\\widetilde{z}_{j}n_{j}^{\\widetilde{\\alpha}-1}}_{\\mathrm{Labor~demand}}=\\underbrace{\\left(\\frac{n_{j}}{N}\\right)^{1/\\theta}W}_{\\mathrm{Labor~supply}},w_{i j}=\\underbrace{\\mu_{i j}\\widetilde{\\alpha}\\widetilde{z}_{i j}n_{i j}^{\\widetilde{\\alpha}-1}}_{\\mathrm{Labor~demand}}=\\underbrace{\\left(\\frac{n_{i j}}{n_{j}}\\right)^{1/\\eta}w_{j}}_{\\mathrm{Labor~supply}}.\n$$  \n\nAn alternative, intuitive, representation of the aggregate equations can be obtained using the 'tilde' objects introduced previously, giving four equations determining consumption, output, labor and the Wage:  \n\n$$\n-\\frac{U_{N}(C,N)}{U_{C}(C,N)}=\\mu\\widetilde{\\alpha}\\widetilde{Z}N^{\\widetilde{\\alpha}-1}\\quad,\\quad\\widetilde{Y}=\\Omega\\widetilde{Z}N^{\\widetilde{\\alpha}}\\quad,C=\\left[1-\\frac{\\delta}{R}\\left(1-\\gamma\\right)\\alpha\\right]\\frac{\\widetilde{Y}}{1-\\alpha\\left(1-\\gamma\\right)}.\n$$  \n\nWith respect to an aggregate production function with productivity $\\scriptstyle{\\widetilde{\\mathbf{Z}}},$ the markdown $\\mu$ is a wedge that pushes the wage below the marginal product of labor, meanwhile for a given productivity $\\widetilde{\\mathbf Z}$ and employment $N_{\\cdot}$ , misallocation $\\pmb{\\Omega}$ represents a direct reduction in output.26 Note that the two terms appear independently.  \n\nBenchmark cases. Since welfare is determined by $c$ and $N_{,}$ and Proposition 1.2 allows us to restrict our attention to understanding markdowns $\\mu$ and misallocation $\\pmb{\\Omega}$ . Three benchmarks are useful:  \n\n- Case I - Efficient allocation. The efficient allocation coincides with an economy in which firm-by. firm wages and marginal revenue products of labor are aligned, that is $\\mu_{i j}=1$ for allfirms. In this case $\\mu=1.$ and $\\Omega=1$ - Case II - Monopsony limits. A monopsonistically competitive economy attains under either of two limits: (1) $m_{j}\\to\\infty$ Or (2) $\\theta\\rightarrow\\eta$ . Henceforth we simply refer to these conditions as the \"monopsony limits\". Under either limit, firms are infinitesimal in the markets in which they set wages. In the first limit, they face a highly competitive local market. In the second limit, they face a national market. Markdowns $\\mu_{i j}$ are identical across firms and equal to $\\eta/\\left(\\eta+1\\right)$ , as market shares $s_{i j}\\to0$ In this case $\\pmb{\\mu}=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\pmb{\\mu}_{i j}\\right]$ , and $\\Omega=1$  \n\n- Case II - Full model. In our full model, the negative correlation of productivity and markdowns within markets (recall Figure 4), leads to (i) $\\Omega<1$ which reduces output, and (ii) a higher productivity weight on wide markdown firms, lowering $\\pmb{\\mu}<\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\pmb{\\mu}_{i j}\\right]$  \n\nThese special cases reveal that the oligopsonistic economy we have contributed distorts welfare relative to a monopsonistically competitive economy precisely through misallocation $\\pmb{\\Omega}$ . In a monoposonistically competitive economy, the labor supply elasticity to the firm $\\eta$ could be calibrated to generate the same $\\pmb{\\mu}.$ yet it would still feature $\\Omega=1$ . That $\\Omega<1$ is an outcome of the counterpart of both limits (i) labor markets are concentrated, and (i) market power via $\\theta<\\eta$  \n\nThis characterization of the model situates the remainder of our paper. First, we provide new empirical facts that allow us—-along with the structure of the model—-to credibly estimate $\\theta$ and $\\eta$ . Second, we show that $\\theta<\\eta$ is necessary for the model to qualitatively and quantitatively match the sign and magnitude of non-targeted empirical evidence on pass-through and strategic wage-setting of firms. Third, we show that the implied misallocation $\\pmb{\\Omega}$ due to $\\theta<\\eta$ accounts for around half of the welfare losses due to labor market power, and that this is robust to specifications of aggregate preferences.  \n\n### 1.7 Measurement  \n\nThe general equilibrium of the model can be used to show that the following two measures of the labor market are independent of the specification of the macroeconomy. We use these results in our calibration exercise in the next section.  \n\n#### Proposition 1.3. Labor share and concentration.  \n\n- The aggregate labor share depends only on the distribution of markdowns and productioity  \n\n$$\nL S_{t}:=\\frac{\\int_{0}^{1}\\sum_{i=1}^{m_{j}}w_{i j}n_{i j}d j}{\\int_{0}^{1}\\sum_{i=1}^{m_{j}}y_{i j}d j}=\\frac{W N}{Y}=\\gamma\\alpha\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\Omega}\\right)\n$$  \n\n- The across market payroll-weighted average of payroll concentration, which we simply refer to as the Wage-bill Herfindahl, is defined  \n\n$$\nH H I_{t}^{w n}=\\int_{0}^{1}s_{j t}h h i_{j t}^{w n}d j\\quad,\\quad h h i_{j t}^{w n}=\\sum_{i=1}^{m_{j}}s_{i j t}^{2}\\quad,\\quad s_{j t}=\\frac{\\sum_{i\\in j}w_{i j t}n_{i j t}}{\\int_{0}^{1}\\sum_{i\\in j}w_{i j t}n_{i j t}d j}\\quad,\n$$  \n\n- The two are linked by the following equation, and hence $H H I_{t}^{w n}$ depends only on the distribution of markdowns and productioity  \n\n$$\n\\cdot S_{t}=\\int_{0}^{1}s_{j t}l s_{j t}d j=\\qquad\\alpha\\gamma\\qquad\\left[H H I_{t}^{w n}\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta+1}\\right)^{-1}+\\left(1-H H I_{t}^{w n}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\eta}{\\eta+1}\\right)^{-1}\\right]^{-1}\n$$  \n\nFor a full derivation of these results see Appendix E.5. Consider again the three benchmark cases. In an efficient economy, labor share is equal to the output elasticity $\\gamma\\alpha$ and concentration plays no role. Under monopsony due to $m_{j}\\to\\infty.$ the Herfindahl in each market is zero, all firms have a markdown $\\mu_{i j}=\\eta/(\\eta+1),$ but with $\\Omega=1$ the labor share is $\\gamma\\alpha\\mu$ . Under monopsony due to $\\theta\\rightarrow\\eta.$ the Herfindahl in each market is positive but does not appear in the labor share. There is a meaningful relationship between concentration and the labor share only under oligopsony with $\\theta<\\eta$  \n\nIn such an economy, higher concentration reduces the labor share. Intuitively, this expression arises in two steps. At the market level, the HHI measures the payroll share of high payroll share firms, which in our model have wide markdowns and so low labor shares. Aggregating across firms within each market delivers (10) in the cross-section of markets. At the aggregate level, the aggregate labor share is the payroll weighted average of market labor shares, leading to (10).  \n\nNote that $H H I_{j t}^{w n}$ and $L S_{t}$ are not sufficient statistics for welfare, even when combined with all other parameters of the model. Combined they reveal the ratio $\\left(\\pmb{\\mu}/\\pmb{\\Omega}\\right)$ , but cannot be used to disentangle the tWo. Proposition 1.2 established that both are required independently in order to compute aggregate quantities and hence welfare. Intuitively, the labor share and Herfindahl capture the wedge in the labor demand condition, but still do not capture the output wedge $\\pmb{\\Omega}$  \n\nNonetheless, this model-implied measure of labor market concentration differs from all existing studies. For example, recent work by Benmelech, Bergman, and Kim (2020) and Rinz (2018) use employment Herfindahls and various weighting schemes. Independent of our model framework, employment Herfindahls understate concentration since they ignore the positive relationship between wages and employment, which is a robust feature of the data (Brown and Medoff, 1989; Lallemand, Plasman, and Rycx, 2007; Bloom, Guvenen, Smith, Song, and von Wachter, 2018).27 We return to study the model's implication for the labor share through the lens of changing $H H I_{t}^{w n}$ and equation (10) in Section 5.  \n\n## 2 Estimation  \n\nOur key parameters to estimate are the degree of across- $(\\theta)$ and within- $(\\eta)$ market labor substitutability. In this section, we describe our novel approach which integrates (i) new empirical estimates from a quasi-natural experiment and (i) new moments from the cross-section of markets given in (for additional moments see Table D1), into (i) a simulated method of moments routine in which all unknown parameters are estimated jointly.  \n\n### 2.1 Approach - Structural vs. reduced-form labor supply elasticities  \n\nStructural elasticities.  We motivate our approach from the following observation. If a researcher could estimate the structural elasticities of labor supply that firms perceive at the Nash equilibrium level of employment, then they could combine data on payroll shares and one of the key model equations to esti  \n\nmate $(\\theta,\\eta)$  \n\n$$\n\\varepsilon\\Bigl(s_{i j}^{w n},\\theta,\\eta\\Bigr):=\\left[\\frac{\\partial\\log w_{i j t}}{\\partial\\log n_{i j}}\\Bigl(s_{i j}^{w n}\\Bigr)\\Big|_{n_{-i j}^{*}}\\right]^{-1}=\\left[\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\Bigl(1-s_{i j}^{w n}\\Bigr)+\\frac{1}{\\theta}s_{i j}^{w n}\\right]^{-1}.\n$$  \n\nIn particular, a decreasing relationship between $\\varepsilon_{i j}$ and $s_{i j}^{w n}$ would identify $\\eta>\\theta$  \n\nReduced form elasticities. When firms behave strategically the structural elasticity cannot be measured using wage and employment responses to well identified firm-level shocks. As is clear from the notation above, the structural elasticity is a strictly partial equilibrium concept and answers the counterfactual: How much willfirm ij have to increase $w_{i j}$ in order to expand $n_{i j}$ by one percent, holding its competitors? employment fixed? Given a shock to any firm in the market, an employment change at firm $i$ will lead competitors to best-respond, which will cause $i$ to best respond and so on. What an empiricist would measure in the data following a shock is therefore a reduced-form elasticity. $\\epsilon(s_{i j t},\\theta,\\eta,\\dots).$ which include all other firms' employment and wage changes across market equilibria.28  \n\nOur insight is that, despite this, the reduced-form elasticities that we may aspire to measure, once filtered through our structural model, are still informative of $(\\theta,\\eta)$ . To a first order approximation, the reduced-form elasticity of labor supply a researcher would measure for firm $i j$ following a shock to it or a competitor is (for derivation see Appendix E.7):  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{\\Omega}_{j t}^{v n},\\theta,\\eta,\\dots\\Big):=\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\log n_{i j t}}{\\mathrm{d}\\log w_{i j t}}=\\left\\langle\\frac{1}{1+\\varepsilon\\Big(s_{i j t}^{w n},\\theta,\\eta\\Big)\\Big(\\frac{\\eta-\\theta}{\\theta_{\\eta}}\\Big)\\Big\\{\\sum_{k\\neq i}s_{k j t}^{w n}\\frac{d\\log n_{k j t}}{d\\log n_{i j t}}\\Big\\}}\\right\\rangle\\times\\varepsilon\\Big(s_{i j t}^{w n},\\theta,\\eta,\\eta\\Big).\n$$  \n\nA distinct property of (12) is that reduced form and structural elasticities coincide exactly under the monopsony limits. As $\\theta\\rightarrow\\eta,$ the term $\\langle\\cdot\\rangle$ goes to one. As $s_{i j t}\\to0.$ , then the perturbed firm is infinitesimal so competitors do not respond and the equilibrium interaction term $\\{\\cdot\\}$ goes to zero. Outside the monopsony limits, strategic interaction implies that reduced-form estimates of labor supply elasticities cannot be used to directly infer welfare-relevant labor supply elasticities.  \n\nBias. The relationship between structural and reduced-form elasticities varies predictably depending on whether the underlying shock is idiosyncratic or common across multiple - but not all - firms in a market. A common shock to all firms drops out from the market equilibrium condition in Proposition 1.1 and could only be used to estimate the market level labor supply elasticity.  \n\nFirst, consider a positive idiosyncratic productivity shock to firm $i$ in market $j$ such that the firm expands employment. As the firm expands employment, its competitors respond. Since competition is Cournot, employment levels across firms are strategic substitutes so competitors reduce employment $(d\\log n_{k j t}<0)$ , implying that the equilibrium interaction term is negative, $\\{\\cdot\\}<0.$ , and the reducedform elasticity exceeds the structural elasticity: $\\epsilon(s_{i j t}^{w n},\\theta,\\eta)>\\varepsilon(s_{i j t}^{w n},\\theta,\\eta)$ . Figure 5A illustrates this case. The contraction in employment at competitors expands labor supply to the firm. An observer drawing conclusions about labor market power from the high reduced-form labor supply elasticity would conclude labor markets are more competitive than they are. Later in this section, we show that this bias is quantitatively significant: inferred structural and reduced-form elasticities differ by up to 50 percent, even for perfectly idiosyncratic shocks.  \n\nFor non-idiosyncratic shocks that are common across a subset of firms, we reach the opposite conclusion. Consider a tax cut that affects firm $i$ in market $j$ as well as the other large firms in market $j$ . Call these affected firms $C$ -Corps. Suppose the tax cut induces firm $i$ and all affected $C$ -Corps to expand employment, i.e. $d\\log n_{i j t}>0$ and $d\\log n_{k j t}>0$ for all firms- $\\cdot k j$ that are $C$ Corps. If non-C-Corp firms have small shares $(s_{k j t}\\approx0)$ , their strategic response is irrelevant. The equilibrium interaction term will be positive $\\{\\cdot\\}>0.$ and the reduced-form elasticity understates the structural elasticity: $\\epsilon\\Bigl(s_{i j t}^{w n},\\theta,\\eta\\Bigr)<\\varepsilon\\Bigl(s_{i j t}^{w n},\\theta,\\eta\\Bigr)$ Figure 5B illustrates this case. The expansion in employment at competing $C$ Corps contracts labor supply to the firm. An observer drawing conclusions about labor market power from the low reduced-form labor supply elasticity would conclude that labor markets are less competitive than they are.  \n\nIndirect inference.  The above demonstrates that reduced-form elasticities are informative of structural elasticities which are in turn informative about welfare relevant parameters, and that the equilibrium structure of the model is necessary to complete this mapping. Our approach recognizes this. We first use a quasi-natural policy experiment to estimate the relationship between payroll shares and average reduced-form labor supply elasticities in the data: $\\widehat{\\epsilon}^{D a t a}(s)$ . We then replicate the same policy experiment in our model which yields  \n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\epsilon}^{M o d e l}\\left(s,\\theta,\\eta\\right):=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\epsilon^{M o d e l}\\left(s,\\theta,\\eta,...\\right)\\right],\n$$  \n\nwhere the expectation is being taken with respect to the distribution of all relevant labor market variables and shocks. We then choose $(\\theta,\\eta)$ —along with other parameters—-to replicate the empirical relationship between average reduced-form elasticities and payroll shares.  \n\n### 2.2  Estimating reduced-form labor supply elasticities in the data: $\\widehat{\\epsilon}^{D a t a}(s)$  \n\nWe estimate size-dependent reduced-form labor supply elasticities using state corporate tax changes in conjunction with the Census Longitudinal Business Database (LBD). The LBD provides high quality measures of employment, location, and industry with nearly universal coverage of the non-farm business sector. Data are carefully linked over time at the establishment and firm level. In order to proceed, we first define markets and firms. We then describe our regression approach.  \n\nMarket. In our model, a labor market has two features: (i) a worker drawn at random from the economy will have a greater attachment to one labor market than others on the basis of idiosyncratic preferences, but will nonetheless be able to move across markets, and (ii) firms within a market compete strategically. With these features in mind and given what we can observe in the LBD, we define a local labor market as a 3-digit NAICS (NAICS3) industry within a Commuting Zone (CZ).29 Examples of adjacent 3-digit  \n\nNAICS codes are subsectors 323-325: 'Printing and Related Support Activities', Petroleum and Coal Products Manufacturing' and 'Chemical Manufacturing' which we regard as suitably different. Examples of adjacent commuting zones include the collection of counties surrounding downtown Minneapolis and those surrounding Duluth.30  \n\nFirm.  We define a firm in a local labor market as the collection of establishments operated by that firm. We aggregate employment and annual payroll of all establishments owned by the same firm within the same NAICS3-CZ market.31 For each resulting firm-market-year observation, we observe employment, payroll, and herein define the wage as payroll per worker.  \n\nRegression framework. To estimate the relationship $\\widehat{\\epsilon}^{D a t a}(s)$ in the data We use within-firm-markel across-time changes in wages and employment following state corporate tax changes.  \n\nLet $i$ denote firm, $j$ denote market, and $t$ year. Let $s(j)$ denote the geographical state of market $j$ Let $y_{i j t}$ denote a variable of interest at the firm-market-year level, such as employment or the wage. We are interested in coefficients on state corporate taxes $\\tau_{s(j)t}$ and their interaction with lagged payroll shares. We use lagged payroll shares to avoid mechanical correlations between contemporaneous wages, employment and wage-bill shares, and control for lagged payroll shares $s_{i j t-1}$ by themselves.32 To isolate Within-firm-market variation, we introduce firm-market fixed effects $\\alpha_{i j}$ 33 Lastly, we folow Giroud and Rauh (2019) and include controls $X_{i t}$ for the state unemployment rate and budget balance, along with a set of indicators for years in which state corporate income tax applied to gross receipts. Our regression specification is as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\log y_{i j t}=\\alpha_{i j}+\\mu_{t}+\\psi s_{i j t-1}+\\beta^{y}\\tau_{s(j)t}+\\gamma^{y}\\left(\\tau_{s(j)t}\\times s_{i j t-1}\\right)+\\Gamma X_{i t}+\\nu_{i j t}.\n$$  \n\nThe coefficients $\\beta^{y}$ and $\\gamma^{y}$ capture the average effect of state corporate tax rate changes and their differential effect by market share. We estimate (13) separately for log employment and log wages (total payroll per worker). We then show how coefficient estimates from (13) can be used to construct $\\widehat{\\epsilon}^{D a t a}(s)$  \n\nClustering. We provide two sets of estimates which cluster at the state-year and market-year levels. Our estimated labor supply elasticity is a combination of both (i) the direct effect of taxes, and (ii) the interaction between payroll share and taxes. The former varies at the state-year level suggesting that clustering at the state-year level is appropriate; the latter varies at the firm-market-year level and since payroll shares contain market level variation, clustering at the market-year level is appropriate.  \n\nSample.  To abstract from changes in product market power we restrict our sample to tradeable industries identified by Delgado, Bryden, and Zyontz (2014) and listed in Appendix C.34 Plants owned by the same firm are aggregated within a market, such that an observation is a firm-market-year. Since we rely on state-level corporate tax variation to generate changes in labor demand, we restrict our sample to  \n\nC-Corporation firms (C-Corps) in the LBD from 1977 to 2011. Table C1 includes summary statistics of our 2.8 million observations at the firm-market-year level.  \n\nEstimates. Table 1 presents empirical estimates of (13). We start with $(\\log)$ employment in year $t$ as a dependent variable. Column (1) presents the full set of interaction terms between payroll shares and corporate taxes. Since $\\tau_{s(j)t}$ is in units of percents, the coefficient on $\\tau_{s(j)t}$ is an elasticity: a one percent increase in corporate taxes results in a 0.309 percent reduction in employment at firms that are atomistic within the market $(s_{i j t-1}=0)$ . The interaction term is positive and significant. When combined with the negative direct effect, the interaction indicates a dampened response at larger firms. Compare the mean effect of a 1 pt increase in $\\tau_{s(j)t}$ on a firm with a mean payroll share (0.03) to a firm with a one standard deviation higher share (0.10). Employment declines by $-0.26$ percent at the small firm and $-0.15$ percent at the large firm. Consistent with Giroud and Rauh (2019), increases in corporate tax rates reduce employment. Our empirical finding is that this reduction is around 40 percent weaker at larger firms.  \n\nColumn (2) illustrates estimates of (13) when the dependent variable is the wage. Qualitatively the signs echo the employment response: on average wages fall, and this decline is smaller at larger firms. Columns (3) and (4) provide estimates of (13) using year $t+1$ employment and wages as dependent variables. These specifications are designed to accommodate adjustment frictions in prices and quantities. We again find a negative effect of corporate taxes on employment and wages, with diminished effects at larger firms.  \n\nShare-dependent reduced-form labor supply elasticities.  Table 2 combines the wage and employment responses to compute the relationship between the average reduced-form labor supply elasticity and payroll shares, which informs both $\\theta$ and $\\eta$ . Differentiating (13) with respect to $\\tau_{s(j)t}$ delivers sharedependent reduced-form wage and employment elasticities:  \n\n$$\n=\\beta^{n}+\\gamma^{n}s_{i j t-1}~,~\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\log w_{i j t}}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau_{s(j)t}}=\\beta^{w}+\\gamma^{w}s_{i j t-1}~,~\\widehat{\\epsilon}^{D a t a}(s_{i j t-1})=\\frac{\\widehat{\\mathrm{d}\\log n}_{i j t}}{\\mathrm{d}\\widehat{\\log w}_{i j t}}=\\frac{\\widehat{\\beta}^{n}+\\widehat{\\gamma}^{n}s_{i j}}{\\widehat{\\beta}^{w}+\\widehat{\\gamma}^{w}s_{i j}}\n$$  \n\nWhen we turn to indirect inference, we run the same regressions on model simulated data to compute eModel (s) in the same way.  \n\nColumn (1) of Table 2A reports reduced-form labor supply elasticity estimates $\\widehat{\\epsilon}^{D a t a}(s_{i j t-1})$ based on the Table 1 Year $t$ estimates for $s_{i j t-1}\\in\\{0.01,0.05,0.10\\}$ .At a wage bill share of 1 percent, the year $t$ reduced-form labor supply elasticity is 1.20, and declines to 0.72 at a wage bill share of 10 percent. Columns (2) and (3) show that the elasticity is statistically significant at the 5 percent level under either assumption for clustering.  \n\nIn Columns (4) and (5) of Table 2A, we test whether the estimated date $t$ labor supply elasticities of larger firms are statistically different from atomistic firms. Formally, we test $H_{0}:\\widehat{\\epsilon}^{D a t a}(s_{i j t-1})=\\widehat{\\epsilon}^{D a t a}(0)$ for $s_{i j t-1}\\in\\{0.01,0.05,0.10\\}$ . In each case the year $t$ reduced-form labor supply elasticities in column (1) is significantly different from that of an atomistic firm at the 1 percent level.  \n\nTable 2B repeats the same exercise for year $t+1$ employment and wage responses from columns (3)  \n\nTable 1: Estimation results for equation (13)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td></td><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">Year t + 1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>log nijt (1)</td><td>log Wijt (2)</td><td>log nijt+1 (3)</td><td>log Wijt+1 (4)</td></tr><tr><td>State corporate tax</td><td>(0)</td><td>-0.00309***</td><td>-0.00249***</td><td>-0.00269***</td><td>-0.00109*</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(0.000641) [0.000349]</td><td>(0.000692) [0.000303]</td><td>(0.000738) [0.000390]</td><td>(0.000619) [0.000316]</td></tr><tr><td>Payroll share</td><td>Sijt-1</td><td>0.886***</td><td>0.130***</td><td>0.719***</td><td>0.116***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(0.0207) [0.0157]</td><td>(0.0105) [0.00893]</td><td>(0.0204) [0.0163]</td><td>(0.0113) [0.01000]</td></tr><tr><td>Interaction</td><td></td><td>0.0158***</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Ts(j)t × Sijt-1</td><td></td><td>0.00396***</td><td>0.0146***</td><td>0.00376**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(0.00271)</td><td>(0.00140)</td><td>(0.00267)</td><td>(0.00146)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>[0.00196]</td><td>[0.00112]</td><td></td><td>[0.00125]</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>[0.00204]</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Fixed effects</td><td></td><td>Y</td><td>人</td><td>Y</td><td>人</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td></td><td>0.897</td><td>0.790</td><td>0.875</td><td>0.735</td></tr><tr><td>Firm-market-year observations</td><td></td><td>2.84m</td><td>2.84m</td><td>2.84m</td><td>2.84m</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNotes: All specifications include fixed effects for: (i) year, (i firmid $\\times$ market.

Column (2) reports p-value of the hypothesis test $H0:\\epsilon^{D a t a}(s)=0$ using standard error clustered at the state-year level. Column (3) clusters at the market-year level. Column (4) reports p-value of the hypothesis test $H0:\\epsilon^{D a t a}(s)=\\epsilon^{D a t a}(0)$ using standard error clustered at the state-year level. Column (5) clusters at the market-year level. Panel B repeats the exercise based on the Date $t+1$ estimates in Columns (3) and (4) in Table 1.  \n\nand (4) of Table 1. At year $t+1$ the implied reduced-form labor supply elasticities are larger, potentially due to slow employment adjustment. However, the estimates are noisier. Based on year $t+1$ estimates we cannot statistically distinguish $\\widehat{\\epsilon}^{D a t a}(s_{i j t-1})$ from $\\widehat{\\epsilon}^{D a t a}(0)$ for $s_{i j t-1}\\in\\{0.01,0.05,0.10\\}$ At a wage-bill share of 10 percent, we come closest to distinguishing the year $t+1$ reduced-form labor supply elasticity from that of an atomistic firm at the 10 percent level.  \n\nIn summary, our more precise year $t$ estimates of the size-dependent wage and employment response indicate (i) less responsiveness of larger firms, and (i) significantly lower reduced-form labor supply elasticities of larger firms. Our year $t+1$ estimates imply greater labor supply elasticities across all firm sizes, consistent with frictional adjustment. In both cases we find that larger firms have lower labor supply elasticities; however, we lack the power to statistically distinguish the labor supply elasticity of large firms from small firms in the year $t+1$ case.  \n\nAdditional results. Appendix G.3 provides additional results. First, model estimation simply requires consistent auxiliary moments that can be simulated. The threat to consistency when we estimate equation (13) is that other forces move employment and wages at the state-year level (e.g. taxes are cut when unemployed is low). Table G3 shows that our main interaction between corporate taxes and the wage-bill share is robust to the inclusion of state-year fixed effects, thus removing all common state-year variation. Second, we directly compute the ratio of wage changes to employment changes at the firm-level and study their relationship with firms' wage-bill share. Following corporate tax cuts, we estimate statistically significantly different labor supply elasticities at large relative to atomistic firms. Third, using the 2012 Census of Manufacturers, we show that variation in non-wage compensation is unable to explain the large movements in markdowns implied by our baseline labor supply elasticity estimates. Finally, We show that systematic variation in capital intensity by market share cannot explain our results: within markets, capital intensity and payroll shares are only weakly correlated.  \n\n### 2.3  Simulating reduced-form labor supply elasticities in the model: $\\widehat{\\epsilon}^{M o d e l}\\left(s,\\theta,\\eta\\right)$  \n\nTo construct $\\widehat{\\epsilon}^{M o d e l}(s,\\theta,\\eta)$ , we add corporate taxes to the environment and show how they shift marginal revenue products of labor. We make several modifications to our theory. Corporate taxes are a tax on profits, net of interest payments on debt. Firms finance $\\lambda_{K}\\in[0,1]$ of their capital using debt and maximize post-tax profits:  \n\n$$\n\\pi_{i j t}=\\left(1-\\tau_{C}\\right)z_{i j t}\\left(k_{i j t}^{1-\\gamma}n_{i j t}^{\\gamma}\\right)^{\\alpha}-\\left(1-\\tau_{C}\\lambda_{K}\\right)R k_{i j t}-\\left(1-\\tau_{C}\\right)w(n_{i j t})n_{i j t},\n$$  \n\nA random fraction $\\omega_{C}\\in[0,1]$ of firms in each market are $C$ -corps and subject to $\\tau_{C})$ all other firms face $\\tau_{C}=0$ . In the data, $C$ -corps are larger on average. To capture this we assume a productivity premium $\\Delta_{C}>1$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\log(z_{i j t})\\sim\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{N\\Big(1,\\sigma_{z}^{2}\\Big)\\qquad}&{\\mathrm{if~}i\\mathrm{is~not}a~C\\mathrm{-corp~(i.e.~with~probability}1-\\omega_{C})}\\ {N\\Big(\\Delta_{C},\\sigma_{z}^{2}\\Big)\\qquad}&{\\mathrm{if~}i\\mathrm{is~a~}C\\mathrm{-corp~(i.e.~with~probability}\\omega_{C})}\\end{array}\\right.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFor $C$ -corps, the corporate tax distorts their capital decision, which reduces the marginal product of labor. Under the firm's optimal capital demand, effective productivity $\\widetilde{z}_{i j t}$ is decreasing in $\\tau_{C}$ $\\lambda_{K}>0$  \n\nTijt $\\operatorname*{max}_{n_{i j}}\\widetilde{z}_{i j t}n_{i j t}^{\\widetilde{\\alpha}}-w(n_{i j t})n_{i j t}\\quad,\\quad\\widetilde{z}_{i j t}=\\left[\\frac{1-\\tau_{C}}{1-\\tau_{C}\\lambda_{K}}\\right]^{\\frac{\\alpha(1-\\gamma)}{1-\\alpha(1-\\gamma)}}\\times\\left\\langle\\left[1-\\alpha\\left(1-\\gamma\\right)\\right]\\left(\\frac{\\alpha\\left(1-\\gamma\\right)}{R_{t}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\alpha(1-\\gamma)}{1-\\alpha(1-\\gamma)}}\\right\\rangle.$ 1-α(1- 1-Tc Zit see Appendix E.9. With these modifications to the theory, We can simulate an increase in corporate taxes and estimate reduced-form elasticities consistent with our approach to the data to obtain $\\widehat{\\epsilon}^{M o d e l}(s,\\theta,\\eta)$  \n\n### 2.4   Indirect inference  \n\nWe estimate the model using 2014 Census data and proceed in two steps. First, to match the reducedform elasticities measured in a sample of tradeable firms, we estimate a tradeable-only version of our economy. This includes the corporate tax experiment and yields estimates of the key preference parameters $\\eta$ and 0. Second, holding $\\eta$ and $\\theta$ fixed, we drop the corporate tax experiment and estimate the remaining parameters to match economy-wide moments. The tradeable sector is more concentrated than the economy on the whole, so the second step is necessary for measuring labor market power in the US economy. We add to the model a parameter that shifts firm productivity ${\\overline{{Z}}},$ and a preference parameter that shifts labor supply $\\overline{{\\varphi}}$  \n\nCommon external parameters. On an annual basis, the discount rate is 4 percent ( $\\overset{\\vartriangle}{\\beta}=0.9615\\$ ), and the depreciation rate is 10 percent ( $\\mathit{\\'}\\delta=0.10\\$ . Throughout we simulate 5, 000 markets and verify that our results are not sensitive to this choice. The moments used in our estimation are robust to alternative specifications of aggregate preferences $U(C,N)$ , so we defer specifying $U$ until we evaluate welfare.  \n\nTradeable only - External parameters. To capture the distribution of tradeable firms across markets, $m_{j}\\sim G(m_{j})$ we combine a Pareto distribution with a discrete mass at $m_{j}=1$ to capture single firm markets. The mass of tradeable markets with a single firm is 16 percent (Table F1). We fit the remaining Pareto parameters to match the first three moments of the distribution of firms across markets. Appendix Table $\\mathrm{F}1$ provides moments and parameter estimates.  \n\nThe fraction of capital financed by debt is chosen to match the debt to capital ratio among tradeable firms. For this we use tradeable firms in Compustat and obtain $\\lambda_{K}=0.213$ .A fraction $\\omega_{C}=0.42$ Of firms are $C$ -corps based on the 2014 County Business Patterns data for tradeable sectors (CBP).  \n\nGiven parameters we simulate a three-period panel from the model. The first two periods are given by the model's steady state with $\\tau_{C}$ set to the mean state corporate tax rate of 6.9 percent (the average over the sample period 1977 to 2011). In the third period, we increase taxes by $\\Delta_{\\tau}={}$ onepercentage point, which is approximately one standard deviation of the distribution of state corporate tax changes observed in our sample period.35 Treating model output as panel data, we estimate (13) with firm fixed effects and lagged payroll shares (hence the requirement for three periods). We replicate our treatment of the data, and transform point estimates into average reduced-form elasticities by payroll share using equation (14). Appendix F includes additional details on simulating the tax experiment.  \n\nTable 3: Summary of Parameters   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Parameter</td><td>Value</td><td>Moment</td><td>Model</td><td>Data</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\">1.

We now estimate $\\pmb{\\psi}=\\{\\theta,\\eta,\\gamma,\\alpha,\\sigma_{z},\\Delta_{C},\\overline{{Z}},\\overline{{\\varphi}}\\}$ . Our strategy is 0 use moments that are independent of aggregate preferences.  \n\nTo estimate $\\theta$ and $\\eta_{\\cdot}$ We target the reduced-form labor supply elasticities in Table 2. Year $t$ and $t+1$ elasticities have different merits. Year $t$ elasticities are less likely to include confounding factors, whereas date $t+1$ elasticities alleviate concerns regarding adjustment frictions. As a compromise we target the average of year $t$ and year $t+1$ estimates. Rather than targeting the entire function (14), we compute the average reduced-form labor supply elasticity of firms with payroll shares between 0 and 5 percent, and 5 and 10 percent. This captures the bulk of variation in our data. The value for small firms is most informative of $\\eta$ . The value for large firms is most informative of $\\theta$ We estimate $\\theta=0.45$ and $\\eta=6.96$  \n\nWe estimate productivity dispersion $\\sigma_{z}$ to match the payroll weighted wage-bill Herfindahl of 0.17 (Table D1). Increasing $\\sigma_{z}$ increases the market power of large firms, increasing concentration. We pin down $\\alpha$ and $\\gamma$ using the capital and labor share of income.36 As can be seen from equation (10), conditional on $H H I_{t}^{w n}$ $\\alpha$ shifts the labor share. Our estimate of $\\alpha$ implies constant returns to scale in the tradeable sector. Parameter $\\gamma$ matches the aggregate capital share. Table 3 summarizes all parameters and the model's fit to the target moments. In Appendix E.6 we provide a closed form solution of the model and prove that in any equilibrium $({\\overline{{Z}}},{\\overline{{\\varphi}}})$ normalize units of wages and labor, so are chosen to match average firm size (34.6) and payroll per worker (\\$58, 300) (Table D1). Finally, $\\Delta_{C}$ matches the 66 percent employment share of $C$ corps (CBP).  \n\nEconomy-wide calibration. Holding our estimates of preference parameters $\\eta$ and $\\theta$ fixed, we recalibrate our model to match economy-wide moments. We update the distribution of firms across markets $G(m_{j})$ , which almost halves the number of markets with one firm to 9 percent. We remove $C$ corps, setting $\\omega_{C}~=~0$ and estimate $\\psi=\\{\\gamma,\\alpha,\\sigma_{z},\\overline{{{Z}}},\\overline{{{\\varphi}}}\\}$ to match, the (i) labor share, (i) capital share, (ii) payroll-weighted wage-bill Herfindahl, (iv) average firm size, and (v) average payroll per worker. Notably, in the overall economy, concentration is lower, the labor share is higher and wages and average firm size are smaller. With less concentration market power is lower, reducing profits, hence a lower value of $\\alpha$ is required to increase profits. The model matches the data exactly and yields decreasing returns to scale, $\\alpha=0.957$  \n\n### 2.5 Discussion of estimated $\\theta$ and $\\eta$  \n\nFigure5C plots $\\widehat{\\epsilon}^{D a t a}(s_{i j t-1})$ Oover $s_{i j t-1}\\in[0,0.10]$ . The model generates a downward sloping reducedform labor supply elasticity similar to the data. Notably, the reduced-form estimates for atomistic firms are roughly four times smaller than the structural estimates. Thus, a naive estimation would conclude that the labor market is less competitive than it actually is, and infer markdowns at atomistic firms of 0.65. Our structural estimates of the labor supply elasticity at atomistic firms imply a markdown of only 0.87 percent, roughly 3 times narrower. The upward bias in market power implied from naive use of reduced-form estimates is less pronounced among larger firms. These predictions are in line with our theory of non-idiosyncratic shocks in Panel B.  \n\nEntry and Exit.  One concern may be that following a tax increase some firms may exit, and this may affect our estimates of $\\theta$ and $\\eta$ . To address this we conduct two exercises. First, in Appendix G we estimate linear probability models of firm-market exit in year $t+1$ as a function of corporate taxes in year $t$ We find economically insignificant results. Giroud and Rauh (2019) find that firms adjust their total number of plants in the state. Our results imply that they do not appear to be exiting commutingZone markets entirely in response to corporate tax changes. Second, despite these insignificant empirical results, we estimate the model under the extreme counterfactual assumption that the smallest 5 percent of $C$ -corps in each market exit after the tax increase. Our estimates of $\\theta$ and $\\eta$ are unchanged. Details of this exercise are in Appendix G.2.  \n\nIdiosyncratic shocks and bias. So far, our analysis has focused on bias between reduced-form and structural elasticities when the observed shock is non-idiosyncratic, illustrated in Figure 5B. In this section, we quantify the bias under idiosyncratic shocks, illustrated in Figure 5A. Many existing papers rely on estimation strategies that assume atomistic firms and infer monopsony from firm-level responses to  \n\n![](images/cca5de3ed0aafc295e9ccb4432d2fc7c180dba66a9f453b9f4568e02d44f0403.jpg)  \nFigure 5: Reduced form and structural labor supply elasticties  \n\nNotes: Panel A demonstrates the relationship between reduced-form and structural labor supply elasticities for an idiosyncratic shock. Panel B demonstrates the relationship between reduced-form and structural labor supply elasticities for a nonidiosyncratic shock that affects a proper subset of firms. Panel C compares reduced-form and structural labor supply elasticities by firm payroll share in response to a corporate tax shock of 1 percentage point.

'Model - Structural' plots $\\varepsilon(\\cdot)$ from equation (11).  \n\nidiosyncratic shocks (e.g., see the articles surveyed in Card, Cardoso, Heining, and Kline (2018). We show that using data on employment and wage changes in response to identified firm-level shocks to infer key structural parameters may generate sizeable bias.  \n\nConsider a truly idiosyncratic shock to a single randomly selected firm in our economy. Drawing the treated firm at random, compute the reduced form elasticity $\\widehat{\\epsilon}_{i j}$ and compare it to the structural elasticity $\\varepsilon_{i j}$ . We repeat this 5,000 times for small (one percent), medium (10 percent) and large (50 percent) productivity shocks. We plot the results in Figure 6. This Monte Carlo exercise reveals a significant difference in reduced-form and structural labor supply elasticities for firms with market shares not equal to O or 1, even when the identifying variation is perfectly idiosyncratic. The bias between reduced-form and structural elasticities is 18 percent for firms with market shares between 0 and $10\\%$ that receive small shocks ( $1\\%$ productivity increase). This bias increases to over $23\\%$ for medium and large shocks. Accounting for the Nash equilibrium of the local labor market is quantitatively important for recovering Welfare relevant parameters.  \n\nThis exercise implies that even if a researcher aims to use perfect idiosyncratic variation in productivity to infer structural elasticities and do welfare analysis, they would have to deflate their reduced-form elasticity estimates substantially in order to recover the true structural elasticities. Inferring structural elasticities that are too large one would infer narrower markdowns which would bias downward the welfare losses due to labor market power. The details of our Monte Carlo exercise are included in Appendix F.3.  \n\nFigure 6 shows that two important caveats apply, both summarized in equation (12). If the firm has a share of one, then reduced-form and structural elasticity estimates coincide and reveal $\\theta$ .If the firm has an infinitesimal share, then reduced-form and structural elasticity estimates coincide and reveal $\\eta$ Finally, a market level shock will directly reveal $\\theta$ , So long as the market itself is not large. If the market is very large then a market level shock will also effect the macroeconomic equilibrium of the labor market, and reduced-form elasticities will be contaminated by $\\varphi$  \n\n![](images/ea4729e39bd52c761c973afa6ff0a19d7e2fc70c8bc06683f3f2d324f4acae95.jpg)  \nFigure 6: Reduced form and structural elasticities in response to idiosyncratic productivity shocks.   \nNotes: Panel A plots Monte Carlo results which compare reduced-form to structural labor supply elasticities in response to a perfectly idiosyncratic shock to a single firm.

In each case we show how the standard monopsony model $(\\theta=\\eta)$ qualitatively and quantitatively fails, while our estimated model matches the data. A summary is as follows:  \n\n1. Pass-through - Under $\\theta=\\eta,$ pass-through from value added per worker to wages is equal to one. Kline, Petkova, Williams, and Zidar (2019) produce an estimate of 0.47. In a replication of their exercise the model produces an estimate of 0.61   \n2. Competitor responses - Under $\\theta=\\eta,$ a firm's response to the wage increase of a competitor will be close to zero. Staiger, Spetz, and Phibbs (2010) produce an estimate of 0.128. In a replication of their exercise the model produces an estimate of 0.065.   \n3. Mergers - Under $\\theta=\\eta$ , the merging of two firms in a labor market has no effect on market wages or employment. Arnold (2020a) finds that worker earnings fall by 0.8 percent, and 3.1 percent in highly concentrated markets. In a replication of their exercise the model produces estimates of 1.3 percent and 4.1 percent, respectively.  \n\nFigure A1 shows that the model replicates the distribution of markets by concentration, both unweighted and payroll weighted.  \n\n![](images/d3d8133e80f1e33d6adf005defd16e533a911f5d62e167c927f55f20a1adef38.jpg)  \nFigure 7: Pass-through and replication of KPWZ  \n\nNotes: Panel A computes average pass-through in bins by 20 ventiles of the payroll share distribution. We draw one firm from each market at random and increase its productivity by 1 percent. We resolve the market equilibrium, keeping general equilibrium aggregates fixed. Within each bin we compute the mean of $\\Delta\\log{w_{i}}/\\Delta\\log{v a p w_{i}}$ of these firms (blue solid line, squares) We use equation (16) and compute $\\Gamma_{i j}$ for each firm based on initial market shares, and again take averages within each bin (red dotted line, circles). We then compute $\\Delta\\log w_{k j t}$ for all other firms in the market, and use these to compute the full approximation from (16) and again take averages within each bin (green squares). The histograms in Panel B and C plot the fraction of firms with firm-level pass-through $\\Delta\\log{w_{i}}/\\Delta\\log{v a p w_{i}}$ in bins of width 0.10, both with (blue, circles) and without (red, crosses) the size restrictions imposed to match the sample statistics of KPWZ.  \n\n### 3.1 Pass-through - Kline, Petkova, Williams, and Zidar (2019)  \n\nTheory.  A body of recent empirical evidence documents that the elasticity of worker wages with respect to value added per worker following shocks to firm productivity is less than one (Kline, Petkova, Williams, and Zidar, 2019; Card, Cardoso, Heining, and Kline, 2018). Under our theory, equation (7) implies:  \n\n$$\n\\underbrace{w_{i j t}=\\alpha\\gamma\\times\\mu_{i j t}\\times v a p w_{i j t}}_{\\mathrm{A.Levels}}\\quad,\\quad\\underbrace{\\Delta\\log w_{i j t}=\\Delta\\log\\mu_{i j t}+\\Delta\\log v a p w_{i j t}}_{\\mathrm{B.Logchanges}}.\n$$  \n\nThe literature discusses pass-through in two ways, in levels as in (15)A. or in log changes as in (15)B. Imperfect pass-through in the first case says nothing about labor market power, since pass-through may be less than one due to markdowns, $\\mu<1$ , or returns to scale, $\\alpha\\gamma<1$ . Imperfect pass-through in the second case, however, is a test of the oligopsony model. In order for log wages to respond less than 1 for 1 with changes in log value added per worker, e.g. $\\Delta\\log w_{i j t}<\\Delta\\log v a p w_{i j t},$ markdowns must increase. Our oligopsony model naturally generates variations in time variation in markdowns: following an increase in firm productivity firms hire more workers, pay higher wages, but with an expanding market share the firm's markdown widens, which dampens the wage increase. In either of our monopsony limits, markdowns are constant and $\\Delta\\log w_{i j t}=\\Delta\\log v a p w_{i j t},$ as in monopsony models of Manning (2003) and Card, Cardoso, Heining, and Kline (2018).  \n\nTotally differentiating the market equilibrium system yields the following first order approximation for pass-through following any perturbation (for derivation see Appendix E.8):  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{i j}{w_{i j}}}=\\Gamma_{i j}^{*}+(1-\\Gamma_{i j}^{*})\\sum_{k\\neq i}{\\frac{s_{k j}^{*}}{1-s_{i j}^{*}}}{\\frac{\\Delta\\log w_{k j t}}{\\Delta\\log v a p w_{i j t}}}\\quad,\\quad\\Gamma_{i j}^{*}={\\frac{s_{i j}^{*}(\\eta-\\theta)+\\theta(\\eta+1)}{[1+(1+\\eta)(1-s_{i j}^{*})]s_{i j}^{*}(\\eta-\\theta)+\\theta(\\eta+1)}}.\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\Delta^{\\prime}\\mathbf{s}$ are taken with respect to the initial equilibrium, which is denoted by asterisks. Clearly from this expression under either monopsony limit ( $\\left(\\theta\\rightarrow\\eta\\right)$ Or $s_{i j}\\to0$ $\\Gamma_{i j}^{*}=1$ and so pass-through is one.  \n\nFigure 7 plots the average measure of the exact value of pass-through by payroll share bins, and shows that the approximation (16) is highly accurate. As firms become larger in a market two offsetting forces shape pass-through. First, the direct effect declines, as increases in productivity into increasing market power and widening markdowns, reducing pass-through. Second, when the firm is large its competitors respond more aggressively, increase their wages, which indirectly leads to further wage increases at the firm, increasing pass-through. On net, the direct effect dominates and pass-through is less than one.  \n\nReplication. Estimates for wage pass-through from a paper with sufficient details for us to replicate come from Kline, Petkova, Williams, and Zidar (2019).37 KPWZ exploit patent issuance as an instrument, comparing consequent changes in value added per worker and wages. To replicate their quasiexperiment we solve the model in general equilibrium, then draw one firm from each market and increase their productivity by $\\psi_{1}^{K P W Z}$ percent. We solve the new market equilibria, keeping aggregates constant. We limit our sample of firms that we shock to firms with more than $\\psi_{2}^{K P W Z}$ workers.We calibrate the replication parameters pkpWz, ppwz) to match two moments of their study: a median firm size in sample of 25.36, which is larger than in our baseline calibration, and a mean increase in value added per worker relative to mean value added per worker of 13 percent.38 Table A1 compares summary statistics of our regression sample to theirs.  \n\nMeasurement. To measure pass-through, we adopt the procedure in KPWZ.39 We treat the pre- and post- observations from the model as a panel with two observations per firm.40 We then regress $w_{i t}$ Oon $v a p w_{i t}$ in levels with firm-specific fixed effect. The regression coefficient is a semi-elasticity which is converted into an elasticity using the initial period mean wage and initial period mean value added per worker (see their Section 7). With this procedure their point estimate implies pass-through of 0.47, with a standard error of 0.23. We verify that under monopsony, i.e. $\\theta=\\eta,$ this approach delivers a pass-through of one.  \n\nResults. Figure 7B provides the results of this exercise. Replicating the KPWZ statistic, our estimate of pass-through is 0.61. To put this in context, our estimate lies at the $70^{t h}$ percentile of the distribution of the point estimate of KPWZ, and hence within even the 25 percent confidence interval. We view this as a success of the model. We also plot the distribution of pass-through across firms, showing rich crosssectional heterogeneity. Relatively smaller firms have higher pass-through, and the support of firm passthrough extends below the KPWZ estimate. Ignoring the fact that the KPWZ sample is biased toward large firms would increase our estimate of pass-through by around 10 percentage points (red crossed lines) as smaller firms have higher pass-through, revealing that the bias introduced by the sample in KPWZ leads to lower pass-through estimates. Figure 7C verifies that decreasing returns is not behind these results. Conducting the exercise under $\\alpha=1$ increases pass-through only slightly.  \n\n### 3.2  Strategic responses - Staiger, Spetz, and Phibbs (2010)  \n\nTheory. An important paper by Staiger, Spetz, and Phibbs (2010, henceforth SSP) provides direct empirical evidence regarding the response of firms in one labor market to increases in wages of other firms in the same labor market. Consider either monopsony limit where a firm exogenously narrows its markdown to $\\mu^{\\prime}\\in[\\mu,1]$ where $\\mu=\\eta/(\\eta+1)$ . In either limit, the fact that the firm is infinitesimal would imply zero effect on competitor's wages within the same geographic area. Contrary to this, SSP find that when Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals increased their wages due to a change in policy, competitors increased their wages in response. In an environment with $\\eta>\\theta.$ , the above pass-through formula (16) shows how our model is consistent with this fact as an increase in wage at firm $k\\neq i$ causes firm $i$ to increase its wage. The mechanism is as follows: a VA hospital increases its wage, which increases its employment and increases its market share $^{S}V A,j t,$ this tightens competition leading non-VA hospitals to narrow their markdowns, which increases their wages.  \n\nReplication. Key properties of the sample and quasi-experiment in SSP are as follows: (i) marketsdefined as a 15-mile radius of the focal VA hospital—-had on average 10.9 hospitals, (i) the VA hospital Was on average paying nurses 1.9 percent below the average wage for nurses at non-VA hospitals, (ii) the policy increased nurse wages of VA hospitals paying below the local average up to the average wage of nurses at non-VA hospitals. To replicate this experiment we take our baseline economy which we call period zero. We then isolate markets $j$ with between 9 and 13 firms, draw one firm $i$ at random in each of these markets from the set of firms with a wage between 1 and 3 percent less than the average market wage, and then increase this firm's productivity by $\\psi_{i j}^{S S P}$ percent. Holding aggregates fixed, we then solve the new market quilibria. We choose $\\psi_{i j}^{S S P}$ firm-by-firm such that in the new equilbrium the wage $w_{i j1}$ at firm $i$ equals the initial period average wage at competitors.41 On average $\\psi_{i j}^{S S P}$ is 3.12 percent, and ranges from 1.42 percent to 5.10 percent.  \n\nTable 4: Strategic interaction and replication of Staiger, Spetz, and Phibbs (2010)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Model</td><td>Data</td></tr><tr><td>A.Replicationstatistics</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Average log difference (gap) between VA hospital wage and average competitor wage</td><td>0.020</td><td>0.019</td></tr><tr><td>Averagenumber of firms in a market</td><td>10.9</td><td>10.9</td></tr><tr><td>Average productivity increase to set gap to zero</td><td></td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>B.Result</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Elasticity of competitor wages to VA hospital wage</td><td>0.065</td><td>0.128</td></tr><tr><td>(Standard error)</td><td></td><td>(0.033)</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNotes: Model simulation selects firms (the VA hospital) whose wages are between $1\\%$ and $3\\%$ lower than the averagemarket wage and are in a market with 9 to 13 firms. The exercise is to raise the VA hospital wage in period one up to the average market wage in period zero, and then to compute the response to competitor wages. Pooling across markets, we report a crosssectional elasticity obtained by regressing log changes of average competitor wages on log changes of VA hospital wages. We compare our estimates to Table 1 (summary statistics) and Table 2 (point estimates) in Staiger, Spetz, and Phibbs (2010).  \n\nMeasurement. To measure employer wage responses, we adopt the procedure in SSP. We treat the data from the model as a panel with two periods. From this we compute $\\Delta\\log w_{V A,j}$ at the 'VA hospital in each market, and the change in log wages at non- $\\cdot V A$ hospitals $\\Delta\\log w_{i j}$ . We then pool across markets and estimate regression equation (6) of SSP which produces a coeficient $\\alpha_{1}$ comparable to their Table 2, column 1:  \n\n$$\n\\Delta\\log w_{i j}=\\alpha_{0}+\\alpha_{1}\\Delta\\log w_{V A,j}+e_{i j}\n$$  \n\nResults. Table 4 compares our results to SSP. Quantitatively, the model generates a response of competitors' wages of 6.46 percent, which is within the 95 percent confidence interval around the SSP estimate: [6.33, 19.27]. We conclude that the structure of labor markets and our estimates of $\\theta$ and $\\eta$ generate strategic complementarities in wage setting that are consistent with this important empirical evidence.  \n\n### 3.3 Mergers - Arnold (2020a)  \n\nTheory.  A recent paper by Arnold (2020a) documents the employment and wage effects of mergers on employment and wages, and how these vary by market concentration. Our theory of a merger between two firms in a labor market is simple: following a merger between firm $i=1$ and $i^{\\prime}=2$ in market $j,$ employment in both firms is chosen 'centrally', in order to maximize $\\pi_{1j}+\\pi_{2j}$ . This results in changes in employment and wages consistent with the data.  \n\nProposition 3.1. Mergers. (i) Following a merger, the markdowns at the merged firms are equalized and depend on the total market share, $\\mu_{1j}=\\mu_{2j}=\\mu(s_{1j}+s_{2j})$ . (i) The wages of each merging firm decreases, and their total ermployment decreases. (i) The total market share of the merging firms decreases and the market share of every non-merging firm increases, (io) Market woage $\\boldsymbol{w}_{j}$ and employment ${\\pmb n}_{j}$ decline, so total market pay $\\Sigma_{i\\in j}w_{i j}n_{i j}$ declines. (o) Under either monopsony limit a merger has no effect on any labor market variables.  \n\nProof is in Appendix E.10. A merger has two negative welfare effects on a labor market. Directly, the merging firms' increase in market power leads them to set markdowns according to their (new) combined market share, reducing their wages which lowers $\\mu_{j}$ Indirectly, this reallocates employment  \n\nTable 5: Mergers and replication of Arnold (2020a)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Moment</td><td colspan=\"2\">A.Arnold (2020)</td><td rowspan=\"2\">B.Replicate Value</td></tr><tr><td>Reference</td><td>Value</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Part I.

Change in employment is computed as change in combined firm employment pre- and post-merger. We follow a similar procedure for payroll and worker earnings. High and medium impact markets are within the top quartile of predicted $\\Delta h h i_{j},$ and high (medium) impact markets are above (below) the median concentration within this group. See text for further discussion.  \n\ntoward competing firms, increasing their market power which reduces their wages, further reducing $\\mu_{j}$ Reallocation effects are ambiguous. If the two merging firms are highly productive, reallocation lowers $\\omega_{j},$ further reducing welfare. If the two firms are low productivity then reallocation away from the merging firms improves $\\omega_{j}$ . In on-going work, we determine how large merger productivity gains must be in order to offset these negative effects.  \n\nUnder either monopsony limit there are no market wage or employment effects from mergers. Markdowns are always constant and employment at both firms is chosen to set the marginal product of labor equal to its marginal cost. Hence we can again use mergers to assess the qualitative and quantitative relevance of our model.  \n\nReplication. We randomly draw two firms in markets with more than two firms and 'merge' these firms. We then solve the new market equilibria keeping aggregates fixed. In the data, merging firms skew heavily toward large firms. To sample large firms we drop all markets in which average employment at the merging firms is below $\\psi_{1}^{A}$ , and choose $\\psi_{1}^{A}$ to match median pre-merger employment of 116 (Table 1).42 Second, the second part of Arnold (2020a)'s analysis focuses on mergers that have a large impact on concentration, using only mergers that have a $95^{t h}$ percentile and above effect on concentration. In this sample, the average change in concentration is 0.17 (Figure 8A). We choose a cut-off percentile $\\psi_{2}^{A}$ that delivers the same average increase in concentration. We carefully follow the measurement of market and firm variables in Arnold (2020a) .  \n\nResults. Table 5 gives our results. The first part of Arnold (2020a) 's analysis considers changes in Wages and employment across firms at all mergers. In employment weighted regressions he finds average firm log employment declines by 14 percent and log payroll by 12 percent (Table 3). Our results are of similar magnitude: employment declines by 7 percent and payroll by 8 percent. Focusing on workers rather than establishments, Arnold (2020a) then shows that the wages of workers that remained at merging establishments fell by 0.8 percent (Table 5), our effects are slightly larger: -1.3 percent.  \n\nA key result in Arnold (2020a) is that worker wage losses are larger in highly concentrated markets (Table 6). He categorizes markets on two variables. First, whether a market is below or above median concentration pre-merger. Arnold (2020a) first splits mergers based on whether the predicted changes in concentration from the merger are inside or outside the top quartile.43 High and medium impact markets are within the top quartile of predicted $\\Delta h h i_{j},$ and high (medium) impact markets are above (below) the median concentration within this group. Repeating the analysis for these groups, he finds that wage losses are 3.9 times larger (-3.1 vs $-0.8$ percent) in high relative to medium impact markets (Table 6). The model produces 3.4 times larger wage losses in high impact markets (-4.1 vs -1.2 percent). Finally, Arnold (2020a) finds that increases in concentration are less than predicted, with a coefficient of 0.83, which our model also produces. The simple ‘predicted change' in concentration measure does not account for the equilibrium response of market shares. After a merger, competitors' market shares increase and the merging firms' market shares decrease, implying that concentration increases by less than the simple prediction. This unique prediction is consistent with oligopsony, $\\eta>\\theta,$ and would not obtain in the absence of strategic interactions.  \n\nFinally, we follow the analysis in the second part of Arnold (2020a) and focus on the relationship between concentration, wages and employment induced by mergers.4 Around merger events Arnold (2020a) finds a significant, negative elasticity of average market wages with respect to the induced change in market concentration. On average the elasticity is $-0.219$ , which increases to $-0.259$ in markets above median concentration. Our effects are larger, with an elasticity of $-0.475$ but with a similar proportional increase to $-0.505$ in markets above median concentration.  \n\n## 4  Measuring and decomposing welfare  \n\nNow that we have validated our model quantitatively using three empirical studies, we use it to measure labor market power in the U.S. at the micro- and macro-level and explore it's implications for welfare.  \n\n### 4.1  Microeconomic measurement  \n\nA firm's markdown is an economically meaningful measure of labor market power. The markdown at the firm measures the wedge between the firm's marginal revenue product of labor and its wage. At the efficient allocation, workers are paid their entire marginal revenue product and thus markdowns are equated toone.  \n\nFigures 8A and 8B plot the distribution of firms and wage payments across structural labor supply elasticities $\\varepsilon_{i j}$ andmarkdowns $\\mu_{i j}$ . In an economy that matches the distribution of firms and concentration across markets, as well as salient pass-through and wage setting facts, we find that most firms in the economy are highly competitive, with narrow markdowns attributable to low market shares and high labor supply elasticities. Taking an unweighted average across firms, the mean labor supply elasticity is more than six, while the markdown is narrower than 20 percent.  \n\nDespite this, the distribution of wage payments in the economy is highly skewed toward firms with more labor market power. Weighted by payroll, the average labor supply elasticity drops to less than four, and the average markdown is around 0.76. As we have shown in Section 1.6, however, what matters for welfare is the aggregate markdown $\\mu$ . This is a particular productivity weighted average of firm markdowns, and skews even further, with a value of 0.71. We can contextualize this by computing what we call the representative labor supply elasticity, which is the elasticity of labor supply to a firm that would lead a firm to set a markdown of $\\mu$ This value $\\mathcal{E}$ is around 2.50, which is less than half the cross-sectional average of $\\varepsilon_{i j}$ . In short, the distribution of wage payments in the economy is crucial for determining the mapping from labor supply elasticities to welfare.  \n\nReduced form elasticities. Next we investigate our model's ability to rationalize the dispersion observed in existing studies of the labor supply elasticity. As we have already shown, our empirical exercise generates reduced-form labor supply elasticities that are lower than the high structural labor supply elasticities that matter for welfare. Figure 8C compares the distribution of reduced-form labor supply elasticities from our estimation exercise with a survey of reduced-form elasticity point estimates in 23 recent papers on labor market power (we list the studies and point estimates in Appendix A). The distribution of reduced-form elasticities we estimate rationalizes the distribution of point estimates found in empirical work. Our model suggests that much of the empirical work estimates reduced-form elasticities that are polluted with strategic interactions via the market equilibrium.45  \n\n### 4.2  Macroeconomic measurement  \n\nEfficient allocation. To measure and decompose the welfare losses due to labor market power we first must define an efficient benchmark. The planner's problem is to choose employment at all firms $\\{{n}_{i j t}\\}$ and capital $K_{t}$ to maximize the present discounted value of utility subject to the definitions of preferences and technology and the aggregate resource constraint:  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{C}_{t}+\\left[K_{t+1}-\\left(1-\\delta\\right)K_{t}\\right]=\\int_{0}^{1}\\sum_{i=1}^{m_{j}}\\overline{{Z}}z_{i j t}\\left(k_{i j t}^{\\gamma}n_{i j t}^{1-\\gamma}\\right)^{\\alpha}d j\n$$  \n\nThe efficient allocation is characterized by the following first order condition for $n_{i j t}$  \n\n$$\n-U_{N}\\left({\\bf C}_{t},{\\bf N}_{t}\\right)\\left(\\frac{n_{i j t}}{{\\bf N}_{j t}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\eta}}\\left(\\frac{{\\bf N}_{j t}}{{\\bf N}_{t}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\theta}}=U_{C}\\left({\\bf C}_{t},{\\bf N}_{t}\\right)m p l_{i j t}\\quad,\\quad m p l_{i j t}=\\alpha\\gamma\\frac{y_{i j t}}{n_{i j t}}\\quad,\\quad\\mathrm{for~all}\\quad.\n$$  \n\n![](images/ca311b001acb746c2f1c65ee81ff96bc4af544722dcee5fc8d39043a6ee9842c.jpg)  \nFigure 8: Distribution of labor market power at the firm level  \n\nNotes: Panel A plots the distribution of equilibrium structural labor supply elasticities $\\varepsilon(\\cdot)$ from equation (11), unweighted ('Firms') and weighted by payroll('Wages). $E[\\varepsilon_{i j}]$ is the unweighted mean structural elasticity, and $\\mathcal{E}$ is the aggregate structural labor supply elasticity consistent with an aggregate markdown ${\\pmb{\\mu}},$ i.e. $\\pmb{\\mu}=\\mathcal{E}/(\\mathcal{E}+1)$ .Panei B conducts the same exercise for markdowns. $E[\\mu_{i j}]$ is the unweighted mean markdown, and $\\mu$ is the aggregate markdown.  \n\nOn the right is the marginal product of labor at firm $i j,$ converted into utils, while on the left is the disutility of supplying that labor transformed into utils. The marginal product of capital is equated across firms.46 In this economy the aggregate markdown is $\\mu^{*}=1$ and misallocation $\\pmb{\\Omega}^{*}=1$  \n\nCompetitive equilibrium.  Note that the efficient allocation can be decentralized under a competitive equilibrium concept that yields $\\mu_{i j t}=1$ . This is obtained if firms take their wage $w_{i j t}$ as given, in which case (18) corresponds to the firm's first order condition for $n_{i j t.}$ , combined with the household's aggregate labor supply curve. The wages that would be obtained in this case obviously correspond to the shadow wages of the planner, as such we use them to compute objects like the $H H I_{t}^{w n}$ implied by the efficient allocation. This also justifies our description of the efficient allocation having more competition than the benchmark economy, since in the corresponding decentralization firms are competitive, taking their wages as given. Figure A3 compares a firm behaving monopsonistically (Panel A) and competitively (Panel B), as in the decentralization just described.  \n\nMeasurement. We measure the welfare loss / gain, which we denote $\\lambda,$ as the percentage increase in consumption in the benchmark economy, that would be required to make the household indifferent with respect to a counterfactual allocation.47 First, we compute the welfare gain from competition across steady-states: $\\lambda_{S S}$ . Let $\\{C,N\\}$ denote consumption and disutility of labor in the benchmark econOmy.Let $\\{C^{*},N^{*}\\}$ denote consumption and disutility associated with the efficient allocation. Then  \n\n^ss equates  \n\n$$\nU\\big(\\left(1+\\lambda_{S S}\\right)C,N\\big)=U\\big(C^{*},N^{*}\\big)\n$$  \n\nSecond, we compute the welfare gain from competition along the transition path between steady states: $\\lambda_{T r a n s}$ . We assume that market structure changes, unexpectedly, at date O, and compare permanently being in the benchmark economy to the transition to the efficient allocation:  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\beta^{t}U\\bigl(\\left(1+\\lambda_{T r a n s}\\right)\\mathbf{C},\\mathbf{N}\\bigr)=\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\beta^{t}U\\bigl(\\mathbf{C}_{t}^{*},N_{t}^{*}\\bigr).\n$$  \n\nPreferences. Proposition 1.2 established that the inputs into solving for aggregate $\\mu$ and $\\pmb{\\Omega}$ were independent of other aggregates and so independent of the specification of $U(\\cdot)$ . For our baseline results we consider GHH preferences, and then introduce wealth effects (WE):  \n\n$$\n{_{G H H}}\\big(\\mathbf{C}_{t},N_{t}\\big)=\\log\\left({C_{t}-\\overline{{\\varphi}}^{-1/\\varphi}\\frac{N_{t}^{1+\\frac{1}{\\varphi}}}{1+\\frac{1}{\\varphi}}}\\right)\\quad,\\quad U_{W E}\\big(\\mathbf{C}_{t},N_{t}\\big)=\\frac{C_{t}^{1-\\sigma}}{1-\\sigma}-\\overline{{\\varphi}}^{-1/\\varphi}\\frac{N_{t}^{1+\\frac{1}{\\varphi}}}{1+\\frac{1}{\\varphi}}.\n$$  \n\nWe show in Appendix $\\mathrm{E}$ that $\\mu$ and $\\pmb{\\Omega}$ are also independent of the scale parameters $\\overline{{Z}}$ and $\\overline{{\\varphi}}$ When giving comparative statics with respect to preference parameters we recalibrate these scale parameters to match the same average worker wage and average firm payroll in the benchmark oligopsony economy.  \n\nResults. Table 6 presents our baseline results. We focus on an aggregate Frisch elasticity of 0.50, which we vary within the range considered by the Congressional Budget Office in assessing policy: $\\varphi\\in[0.20,0.80]$ . First, the steady state welfare gains are large, around 7 percent of consumption. Second, these gains are moderated slightly due to transition dynamics. Reaching higher steady-state capital is costly and gradual due to decreasing marginal utility. Transition dynamics are straight-forward to compute, since Proposition 1.2 tells us that ${\\pmb{\\mu}}_{t}$ and $\\pmb{\\Omega}_{t}$ jump at date zero to their efficient levels. Figure A4 and its footnote describe the dynamics of the economy in detail. Third, under a higher labor supply elasticity, it less costly for the representative household to supply more labor in the competitive allocation, and so welfare and output gains are larger.  \n\nWe now leverage Proposition 1.2 to decompose the welfare effects of labor market power into the aggregate markdown $\\mu$ and misallocation $\\pmb{\\Omega}$ . We do so by changing one at a time, and recomputing the aggregate economy using the general equilibrium conditions. At the benchmark $\\varphi=0.50$ Welfare gains are roughly half due to misallocation $\\pmb{\\Omega}$ , 42 percent due to markdowns $\\mu,$ with the remaining 8 percent due to their interaction.  \n\nThat misallocation $\\pmb{\\Omega}$ plays a significant role is a key result. Recall that a monopsony economy would deliver $\\pmb{\\mu}=\\eta/(\\eta+1)$ . Hence $\\eta$ could be parameterized to match the $\\mu$ from the oligopsony economy. This monopsony economy would have the same welfare gains due to markdowns shifting to their efficient level. However the monopsony economy would feature $\\Omega=1$ and miss the welfare gains from resolving misallocation. These welfare effects account for around one half of the total welfare effects of labor market power.  \n\nIn terms of measurable features of the labor market, the average worker wage increases by about 50 percent, with employment changes ranging from 1 to 22 percent, depending on the Frisch elasticity, $\\varphi$  \n\nTable 6: Welfare gains from competition with GHH preferences   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Frisch elasticity</td><td colspan=\"4\">A.Welfare</td><td colspan=\"2\">B.

Welfare gain $\\lambda_{S S}$ is given by (19), $\\lambda_{T r a n s}$ is given by (20). Both correspond to moving from the benchmark oligopsony to competitive equilibrium. Average wage and aggregate employment are expressed in percentage increases from oligopsony to competitive steady-state. Average wage is total wage payments divided by total employment, and aggregate employment is in bodies' not disutility.  \n\nWelfare gains are significantly larger for higher values of the Frisch elasticity, as working more in the efficient allocation is less costly. Wage increases are slightly smaller under higher $\\varphi$ Our aggregation results showed that $W=\\mu\\widetilde{\\alpha}N^{\\widetilde{\\alpha}-1}$ . Regardless of $\\varphi_{.}$ the aggregate markdown $\\mu$ increases to one, which increases Wages. With a higher Frisch elasticity $\\varphi,$ however, the larger increase in $N$ reduces the marginal product of labor which dampens the increase in wages.  \n\nFinally, concentration and welfare increase in unison as we move to the efficient allocation. The benchmark economy has a payroll weighted wage-bill Herfindahl of 0.11 (Table 3). Under the shadow Wages implied by the efficient allocation, the Herfindahl more than doubles, increasing by 0.19. This is consistent with the large role of misallocation $\\pmb{\\Omega}$ in welfare. In the efficient allocation, large firms no longer use their market power to cut back on quantities and lower wages. Wages and employment therefore increase most at the largest firms who had the widest markdowns in our benchmark economy. This reduces misallocation (i.e. $\\pmb{\\Omega}$ rises) but also increases concentration. Consistent with Proposition 1.3, this increase in concentration is independent of the specification of aggregate preferences. Similarly the labor share increases to $\\widetilde{\\alpha}$ in all economies, since $L S=\\widetilde{\\alpha}(\\pmb{\\mu}/\\Omega)$  \n\nReallocation.  Figure 9(l) illustrates the reallocation of employment that underlies the increase in $\\pmb{\\Omega}$ under the efficient allocation. We plot the change in employment across the productivity distribution of firms (panel I). Panel I shows that the reallocation consists of a significant shift in employment away from low productivity firms and toward the highest decile of firms. To visualize how reallocation occurs at a market level, Panel II returns to our two and three firm example Figure 4 and adds the efficient allocation. With markdowns equated at one, wages increase at all firms, more than doubling at the most productive firm. Since it had the widest markdown to begin with, the wage increase is largest at the most productive firm, which reallocates employment toward it and away from the medium and low productivity firms.  \n\nWealth effects.  We can learn more about the role of misallocation and the markdown by studying the economy with wealth effects. With wealth effects on labor supply, the increase in consumption under the efficient allocation leads to a reduction in household labor supply, dampening welfare gains. Despite this, our results are robust. Compared to our baseline welfare gain of 7 percent under $\\varphi=0.50$ ,Figure  \n\n![](images/bc7c0fd87a595acaf0ce01b9337e185c0c68d37da2fec56f40b14bf6051ccc79.jpg)  \nFigure 9: Employment reallocation from the benchmark economy to the efficient economy  \n\nNotes: Panel I: Firms are grouped by 5 percent bins of the productivity distribution in the benchmark economy. Panel II: Solid line replicates benchmark oligopsony economy Figure 4, dashed lines plot outcomes under the efficient allocation. Low, medium and high productivities of the firms correspond to the $10^{t h}$ $50^{t h}$ and $90^{t h}$ percentiles of the productivity distribution.  \n\n10A shows that shifting to $U_{W E}(\\cdot)$ under log preferences $(\\sigma=1)$ ), the welfare gain narrows slightly to   \n5.38 percent. Further increases in $\\sigma$ as far as 4 still lead to significant welfare gains of more than 4 percent.  \n\nInterestingly, wealth effects have a significant impact on the decomposition of welfare gains into misallocation and markdowns. Figure 10B shows that the fraction of welfare gains attributable to the resolution of misallocation $\\pmb{\\Omega}$ jumps to nearly 60 percent under log preferences, and increases further as wealth effects become more pronounced. Recall that in general equilibrium $Y=\\Omega\\widetilde{Z}N^{\\widetilde{\\alpha}}$ . An increase in $\\pmb{\\Omega}$ delivers a direct increase in output. If $\\sigma$ is larger, the increase in utility due to the associated increase in consumption is larger. In the limit as $\\varphi\\rightarrow0$ labor supply becomes perfectly inelastic and $\\pmb{\\Omega}$ accounts for the entirety of the welfare gains from competition.  \n\nSummary.  In summary, we measure that the welfare costs of labor market power in the U.S. economy are between 4 and 9 percent of aggregate consumption, with at least half of those gains coming from reallocation. Our model can measure these reallocation effects due to the structure of labor markets and strategic interaction among firms under our estimates of ${\\eta}>\\theta$ . A model of monopsony would miss these welfare gains since in such a model misallocation $\\Omega=1$ under the decentralized equilibrium and efficient allocation.  \n\n## 5 Application- Labor market concentration and labor's share, 1977 - 2013  \n\nAs an application of our framework, we use the model implied relationship between concentration and the labor share to show how alternative measurements of concentration can lead to different counterfac  \n\n![](images/701ae0b1ce572cff5f582c83a1f771ead9a49641dfbeb95b2a8a380fd7ba94e0.jpg)  \nFigure 10: Welfare costs of labor market power with wealth effects  \n\nNotes: Panel A plots the percent welfare gains $\\lambda\\times100$ associated with the efficient allocation as the Frisch elasticity of labor supply $\\varphi$ and the coefficient of relative risk aversion $\\sigma$ are varied. Each economy has the exact same level of concentration, average firm size, average worker wage, and all other moments used in our calibration 3. Panel B plots the percent welfare gains under only an increase in $\\omega$ to its efficient level $\\omega^{*}=1$ divided by the overall welfare gains associated with the efficient allocation. The red dashed line corresponds to the case of GHH preferences.  \n\ntual predictions. We leverage the model's mapping from concentration to the labor share:  \n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1}s_{j t}l s_{j t}d j=\\alpha\\gamma\\left[H H I_{t}^{w n}\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta+1}\\right)^{-1}+\\left(1-H H I_{t}^{w n}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\eta}{\\eta+1}\\right)^{-1}\\right]^{-1},H H I_{t}^{w n}=\\int_{0}^{1}s_{j t}h h\n$$  \n\nThe model clearly implies a welfare relevant measure of labor market concentration: payroll weighted Wage-bill Herfindahl. Figure 11A shows how this has evolved from 1977 to 2013, using our definition of a local labor market: a 3-digit industry and commuting zone.48 Tradeables, non-tradeables, and the combined economy all decline over time. In tradeables the decline is roughly 20 percent from 0.217 to 0.175. Concentration in non-tradeables is lower, and declines with a slight increase at the end of our sample, but by 2013 is half its level in 1984.  \n\nFigure 11B demonstrates the importance of weighting and compares payroll and employment concentration, considering only the tradeable sector.49 First, not weighting across markets inflates the measure of concentration by a factor of around 2.5 for both payroll and employment concentration. Many markets have few employers but they account for a very small fraction of wage payments. Second, the Weighted payroll and employment Herfindahls display similar trends, with a time-series correlation of 0.75 between 1977 and 2013. Despite this, the positive size wage premium leads employment concentration to be 20 percent less than payroll concentration.  \n\nFigure 11C repeats this exercise disregarding the local nature of labor markets. We first compute concentration at the national industry level, and then weight across industries. According to this mea  \n\n![](images/f48487f6789195905bd9e3aa819e6412ab283e1b48a4335187922ffd74652bf6.jpg)  \nFigure 11: Measures of labor market concentration, 1977 to 2013  \n\nNotes: Data is plotted using a centered 5-year moving average in all panels. Panel A plots the payroll weighted average of the wage-bil Hefindahl computed a the commuting zone $\\times$ NAICS3, $\\begin{array}{r}{{H H I}_{t}^{w n}=\\int_{0}^{1}\\Bar{s_{j t}}h h i_{j t}^{w n}d j}\\end{array}$ Panel A includes three lines for tradeables (NAICS2 codes of 11,21,31,32,33,55), non-tradeables (all other NAICS2 codes), and the whole economy. Panel B compares the tradeable payroll weighted and unweighted ${\\mathsf{C Z}}{\\times}{\\mathsf{N A I C}}{\\mathsf{S3}}$ wage-bill Herfindahl: $h h i_{j t}^{w n}$ . Panel B also compares the employment weighted and unweighted ${\\mathsf{C Z}}{\\times}{\\mathsf{N A I C}}{\\mathsf{S3}}$ employment Herfindahl: $h h i_{j t}^{n}$ . Panel C plots the national payroll weighted wage-bill Herfindahl. National Herfindahls are computed at the NAICS3 level, ignoring geography, then weighted by industry payroll.  \n\nsure, which is irrelevant for welfare, labor market concentration increased over this period, following a sharp drop in the early 1980s. While our payroll Herfindahl measure is distinct, other contemporaneous Work has documented a disconnect between national and local employment Herfindahls using different definitions of markets and aggregation (e.g. Rossi-Hansberg, Sarte, and Trachter (2018), Rinz (2018).50  \n\n### 5.1 Counterfactual labor share, 1977 - 2013  \n\nWe can now combine three of the novel contributions of this paper to link the dynamics of labor's share of income to labor market power: (i) the closed-form expression for labor's share of income given by equation (21), (i) our estimates of $\\theta$ and $\\eta,$ and (i) our new time-series of aggregate concentration (Figure 11).  \n\nOur counterfactual holds $\\{\\gamma,\\alpha,\\eta,\\theta\\}$ fixed and varies the payroll weighted wage-bill Herfindahl $H H I_{t}^{w n}$ from 1977 to 2013, using this to compute the implied labor share from equation (21). At our estimated parameters, the declining wage-bill Herfindahl between 1977 and 2013 contributed to increase the labor share by around 4 percentage points. Figure 12 plots the implied changes in labor share holding all else fixed except for the payroll weighted wage-bill Herfindahl. The predicted upward pressure of declining local Herfindahls on labor's share of income is similar for tradeables, non-tradeables, and the overall economy. We conclude that changes in labor market concentration are unlikely to have contributed to the declining labor share in the United States (e.g. Karabarbounis and Neiman (2013).  \n\n![](images/c997d358ab144d284a3d84d08cf55a05fbd3bf8bcc50f35ad5f2a55bf12d81de.jpg)  \nFigure 12: Change in labor share attributable to change in payroll Herfindahl, 1977 to 2013 Notes: Figure constructed by using estimates of payroll weighted wage-bill Herfindahl (Figure 11) and expression for labor's share of income (21). $\\{\\gamma,\\alpha,\\eta,\\theta\\}$ held fixed at values in Table 3.  \n\n# 6 Conclusion  \n\nWe measure oligopsony in administrative U.S. Census data through the lens of a structural model. By doing so, we make several contributions. We develop a general equilibrium model of labor market oligopsony. We prove that the model is block recursive and provide a closed-firm link between labor market concentration and labor's share of income. We show how to estimate the underlying preference parameters that govern labor market power in the presence of strategic interactions. We provide novel measures of firm size-dependent labor supply elasticities. We rationalize empirical evidence suggestive of oligopsony by quantitatively replicating three empirical papers whose results cannot be obtained from theoretic models that abstract from oligopsony. Under a variety of aggregate preferences, we compute sizeable welfare gains worth 4 to 9 percent of lifetime consumption from moving to the efficient allocation. We show that roughly half of the gains are attributable to misallocation by using a novel representative agent counterpart of our economy. Lastly, we show that the model relevant measure of concentration is the payroll weighted wage-bill Herfindahl, which we measure, and use to show that changes in labor market concentration are unlikely to have contributed to a falling labor share in the U.S.  \n\nWe believe our framework and empirical findings provide many avenues for future research. By establishing the empirical relevance of our framework through a battery of validation tests, we provide the literature with a useful point of departure. In ongoing work, we demonstrate the framework can be modified to contribute to debates on minimum wage policy and merger policy. The model can also incorporate firm entry /exit and worker heterogeneity, accommodating use of occupation or worker-level data such as the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics database to estimate oligopsony.  \n\nReferences   \nAMITI, M., O.

We randomly sample one percent of firms in our benchmark economy. We draw firms with employment greater than $\\underline{n}$ We increase the productivity of treated firms by a factor $\\Delta l o g\\widetilde{z}_{i j}$ The values of $\\underline{n}$ and $\\Delta$ are calibrated to match the KPWZ (1) median firm size of 25 employees, (2) increase in post-tax value added per worker of 13 percent. We keep aggregates fixed and solve the new market equilibrium. We treat the untreated and treated observations for each firm as a panel with two observations per frm of wages $\\left\\{w_{i j0},w_{i j1}\\right\\}$ and alue ad per worker, $\\left\\{\\frac{y_{i j0}}{n_{i j0}},\\frac{y_{i j1}}{n_{i j1}}\\right\\}$ The regression coeficient is converted into an elasticity using untreated mean wages and mean value added per worker.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Model</td><td>Data</td></tr><tr><td>Wage bill Herfindahl - Payroll weighted average</td><td>0.17</td><td>0.17</td></tr><tr><td>Wage bill Herfindahl-Unweighted average</td><td>0.33</td><td>0.48</td></tr><tr><td>Wage bill Herfindahl correlation with market employment</td><td>-0.86</td><td>-0.25</td></tr><tr><td>Employment Herfindahl -Payroll weighted average</td><td>0.15</td><td>0.15</td></tr><tr><td>Employment Herfindahl - Unweighted average</td><td>0.32</td><td>0.45</td></tr><tr><td>Employment Herfindahl correlation withWage-bill Herfindahl</td><td>1.00</td><td>0.98</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTable A2: Concentration and competition, model versus data Notes: Data is from 2014 LBD, tradeable sectors.

Low, medium and high productivities of the rmscorrespond to the $10^{t h}$ $50^{t h}$ and $90^{t h}$ percentiles of the productivity distribution.  \n\n![](images/bf6f7c873a9c387d48072ac0297fcfd3dada0abfa4d021cb7e4dab837d261483.jpg)  \nFigure A3: Oligopsonistic vs. Competitive equilibrium  \n\nNotes: In a oligopsonistic equilibrium (Panel A) the firm understands that its marginal cost $M C_{i j}$ is increasing in its employment. In a competitive equilibrium (Panel B) the firm perceives that its marginal cost $M C_{i j}$ is simply equal to its wage, which it takes as given. The true labor supply curve to the firm, however, is still upward sloping, reflecting household preferences.  \n\n![](images/fd8c9bd5f10f8229ba7658fad61078fa4e971df99f42b0dc73d2e5e5c2fc5572.jpg)  \nFigure A4: Transition dynamics to change in market structure.  \n\nNotes: This figure provides transition dynamics of aggregates to an unexpected change to the competitive market structure in period $t=1$ . Transition dynamics are computed under $\\varphi=0.50$ . Preferences are GHH. Both $\\pmb{\\Omega}$ and $\\mu$ immediately jump to 1 at $t~=~1$ . Since the model is block recursive, the market equilibrium allocations jump. Given shares, we can compute $W_{t}$ . So $W_{t}$ jumps, as does $N_{t}$ given the labor supply curve $\\hat{N_{t}}~=~\\overline{{\\varphi}}W_{t}^{\\varphi}$ : The path for capital and consumption is then determined by the resource constraint $C_{t}=Y_{t}+(1-\\delta)K_{t}-K_{t+1},$ household's Euler equation $u_{C}(C_{t},N_{t})=\\beta u_{C}(C_{t+1},N_{t+1})\\left[R_{t+1}+1-\\delta\\right],$ and equilibrium price of capital $R_{t}K_{t}=(1-\\gamma)\\alpha{\\pmb Y}_{t}$ . Since capital is undistorted, it is paid the competitive factor share, which is equal to its output elasticity.  \n\n## B  Microfounding the nested CES labor supply system  \n\nIn this section we provide a micro-foundation for the nested CES preferences used in the main text. The arguments used here adapt those in Verboven (1996). We begin with the case of monopsonistic competition to develop ideas and then move to the case of oligopsonistic labor markets studied in the text. We then show that the same supply system occurs in a setting where workers solve a dynamic discrete choice problem and firms compete in a dynamic oligopoly.  \n\n### B.1 Static discrete choice framework  \n\nAgents. There is a unit measure of ex-ante identical individuals indexed by $l\\in[0,1]$ . There is a large but finite set of $J$ ;ectors in the economy, with finitely many firms $i\\in\\{1,\\ldots,M_{j}\\}$ in each sector.  \n\n?references. Each individual has random preferences for working at each firm $i j$ Their disutilityof labor supply isconex n hours worked $h_{l}$ . Worker $l^{\\prime}$ s disutility of working $h_{l i j}$ hours at $\\mathrm{firm}i j$ are:  \n\n$$\n\\nu_{l i j}=e^{-\\mu\\xi_{l i j}}h_{l i j}\\qquad,\\qquad\\log\\nu_{l i j}=\\log h_{i j}-\\mu\\xi_{i j},\n$$  \n\nwhere the random utility term $\\xi_{l i j}$ is distributed id across individuals according from a multi-variate Gumbel distribution:  \n\n$$\nF(\\xi_{i1},...,\\xi_{N J})=\\exp\\left[-\\sum_{i j}e^{-(1+\\eta)\\xi_{i j}}\\right].\n$$  \n\nThe term $\\xi_{l i j}$ is a worker-firm specific term which reduces labor disutility and hence could capture (i) an inverse measure of commuting costs, or (i a positive amenity.  \n\nDecisions. Each individual must earm $y_{l}\\sim F\\left(y\\right)$ where amings $y_{l}=w_{i j}h_{l i j}$ After drawing thir vector $\\left\\{\\xi_{l i j}\\right\\},$ each worker solves  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{min}_{i j}\\left\\{\\log h_{i j}-\\xi_{l i j}\\right\\}\\equiv\\operatorname*{max}_{i j}\\left\\{\\log w_{i j}-\\log y_{l}+\\xi_{l i j}\\right\\}.\n$$  \n\nThis problem delivers the following probability that worker $l$ chooses to work at $\\mathrm{firm}i j,$ which is independent of $y_{l}$  \n\n$$\nP r o b_{l}\\left(w_{i j},w_{-i j}\\right)=\\frac{w_{i j}^{1+\\eta}}{\\sum_{i j}w_{i j}^{1+\\eta}}.\n$$  \n\nAggregation.  Total labor supply to firm $i j,$ is then found by integrating these probabilities, multiplied by the hours sup. plied by each worker $l$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l l l}{{}}&{{}}&{{\\displaystyle{n_{i j}=\\int_{0}^{1}P r o b_{l}\\left(w_{i j},w_{-i j}\\right)h_{l i j}d F\\left(y_{l}\\right)\\qquad,\\qquadh_{l i j}=y_{l}/w_{i j}}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{\\displaystyle{n_{i j}=\\frac{w_{i j}^{\\eta}}{\\sum_{i\\in j}w_{i j}^{1+\\eta}}\\underbrace{\\int_{0}^{1}y_{l}d F\\left(y_{l}\\right)}_{:=Y}}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nAggregating this expression we obtain the obvious result that $\\Sigma_{i\\in j}w_{i j}n_{i j}=Y$ Now define the following indexes:  \n\n$$\nW:=\\left[\\sum_{i\\in j}w_{i j}^{1+\\eta}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{1+\\eta}}\\quad,\\quad N:=\\left[\\sum_{i\\in j}n_{i j}^{\\frac{\\eta+1}{\\eta}}\\right]^{\\frac{\\eta}{\\eta+1}}.\n$$  \n\nAlong with (B2),these indexes imply that $W N=Y$ Using these definitions along with $W N=Y$ in (B2) yields the CES supply urve:  \n\n$$\nn_{i j}=\\left(\\frac{w_{i j}}{W}\\right)^{\\eta}N.\n$$  \n\nWe therefore have the result that the supply curves that face firms in this model of individual discrete choice are equivalent to those that face the firms when a representative household solves the following income maximization problem:  \n\n$$\n\\underset{\\left\\{n_{i j}\\right\\}}{\\operatorname*{max}}\\sum_{i\\in j}w_{i j}n_{i j}\\quad s.t.\\quad\\left[\\sum_{i\\in j}n_{i j}^{\\frac{\\eta+1}{\\eta}}\\right]^{\\frac{\\eta}{\\eta+1}}=N.\n$$  \n\nSince at the solution, the objective function is equal to WN, then the envelope condition delivers a natural interpretation of $W$ as the equilibrium payment to total labor input in the economy for one additional unit of aggregate labor disutility. That is, the following equalities hold:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial N}\\sum_{i\\in j}w_{i j}n_{i j}^{*}(w_{i j},w_{-i j})=\\Lambda=W=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial N}W N.\n$$  \n\nNested logit and nested CES. Consider changing the distribution of preference shocks as follows:  \n\n$$\nF(\\xi_{i1},...,\\xi_{N J})=\\exp\\left[-\\sum_{j=1}^{J}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{M_{j}}e^{-(1+\\eta)\\xi_{i j}}\\right)^{\\frac{1+\\theta}{1+\\eta}}\\right].\n$$  \n\nWe recover the distribution (B1) above if $\\eta=\\theta$ .Otherwise, if ${\\eta}>\\theta$ the problem is convex and the conditional covariance o.   \nwithin sector preference draws differ from the economy wide variance of preference draws. We discuss this more below.  \n\nIn this setting, choice probabilities can be expressed as the product of the conditional choice probability of supplying labor to firm $i$ conditional on supplying labor to market $j,$ and the probability of supplying labor to market $j$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{P r o b_{l}\\left(w_{i j},w_{-i j}\\right)=\\underbrace{\\frac{w_{i j}^{1+\\eta}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{M_{j}}w_{i j}^{1+\\eta}}}_{P r o b_{l}\\left(\\mathrm{Choose~firm~}i\\mid\\mathrm{Choose~market}j\\right)}\\times\\underbrace{\\frac{\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{M_{j}}w_{i j}^{1+\\eta}\\right]^{\\frac{1+\\theta}{1+\\eta}}}{\\sum_{l=1}^{J}\\left[\\sum_{k=1}^{M_{l}}w_{k l}^{1+\\eta}\\right]^{\\frac{1+\\theta}{1+\\eta}}}}_{P r o b_{l}\\left(\\mathrm{Choose~market}j\\right)}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFollowing the same steps as above, we can agregate these choice probabilities and hours decisions to obtain firm level labo supply:  \n\n$$\nn_{i j}=\\frac{w_{i j}^{\\eta}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{M_{j}}w_{i j}^{1+\\eta}}\\frac{\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{M_{j}}w_{i j}^{1+\\eta}\\right]^{\\frac{1+\\theta}{1+\\eta}}}{\\sum_{l=1}^{J}\\left[\\sum_{k=1}^{M_{l}}w_{k l}^{1+\\eta}\\right]^{\\frac{1+\\theta}{1+\\eta}}}Y.\n$$  \n\nWe can now define the following indexes:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle W_{j}=\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{M_{j}}w_{i j}^{1+\\eta}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{1+\\eta}}~,~}}&{{N_{j}=\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{M_{j}}n_{i j}^{\\frac{1+\\eta}{\\eta}}\\right]^{\\frac{\\eta}{1+\\eta}},}}\\ {{\\displaystyle W=\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{J}W_{j}^{1+\\theta}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{1+\\theta}}~,~}}&{{N=\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{J}N_{j}^{\\frac{1+\\theta}{\\theta}}\\right]^{\\frac{\\theta}{1+\\theta}}.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nUsing these definitions and similar resuts t the above we can show that $\\begin{array}{r}{W_{j}N_{j}=\\sum_{i=1}^{M_{j}}w_{i j}n_{i j},}\\end{array}$ and $\\begin{array}{r}{Y=W N=\\sum_{j=1}^{J}W_{j}N_{j}}\\end{array}$ Consider the thought experiment of adding more markets $J$ (which is necessary to identically map these formulas to our model). While the min of an infinite number of draws from a Gumbel distribution is not defined (it asymptotes to $-\\infty,$ , the distribution of choices across markets is defined at each point in the limit as we add more markets $J$ (Malmberg, 2013). As a result, the distribution of choices will have a well defined limit, and with the correct scaling as we add more markets (we can scale the disutilities at each step and not affect the market choice), as described in (Malmberg, 2013), the limiting wage indexes will be defined as above. We can then express (B3) as:  \n\n$$\nn_{i j}=\\left(\\frac{w_{i j}}{W_{j}}\\right)^{\\eta}\\left(\\frac{W_{j}}{W}\\right)^{\\theta}N,\n$$  \n\nwhich completes the CES supply system defined in the text.  \n\nComment. The above has established that it is straightforward to derive the supply system in the model through a discrete choice framework. This is particularly appealing given recent modeling of labor supply using familiar discrete choice frameworks first in models of economic geography and more recently in labor (Borovickova and Shimer (2017), Card, Cardoso, Heining, and Kline (2018), Lamadon, Mogstad, and Setzler (2019)). Since firms take this supply system as given, we can then work with the nested CES supply functions as if they were derived from the preferences and decisions of a representative household. This vastly simplifies welfare computations and allows for the integration of the model into more familiar macroeconomic environments.  \n\nThe second advantage of this micro-foundation is that it provides a natural interpretation of the somewhat nebulous elasticities of substitution in the CES specification: $\\eta$ and $\\theta$ Returning to the Gumbel distribution we observe the following  \n\n$$\nF(\\xi_{i1},...,\\xi_{N J})=\\exp\\left[-\\sum_{j=1}^{J}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{M_{j}}e^{-(1+\\eta)\\xi_{i j}}\\right)^{\\frac{1+\\theta}{1+\\eta}}\\right]\n$$  \n\nA higher value of $\\eta$ increases the correlation of draws within a market (McFadden, 1978). Within a market if $\\eta$ is high, then an individual's preference draws are likely to be clustered. With little difference in non-pecuniary idiosyncratic preferences for working at different firms, wages dominate in an individual's labor supply decision and wage posting in the market is closer to the competitive outcome. A higher value of $\\theta$ decreases the overall variance of draws across all firms (i.e. it increases the corelation across any two randomly chosen sub-vectors of an individual's draws). An individual is therefore more likely to find that their lowest levels of idiosyncratic disutility are in two different markets, increasing across market wage competition.  \n\nIn the case that $\\eta\\:=\\:\\theta_{\\cdot}$ , the model collapses to the standard logit model. In this case the following obtains. Take an individual's $\\xi_{l i j}$ for some firm. The conditional probability distribution of some other draw $\\xi_{l i^{\\prime}j^{\\prime}}$ is the same whether firm $i^{\\prime}$ .s in the same market $(j^{\\prime}=j)$ Orsomeothermarket $(j^{\\prime}\\neq j)$ . Individuals are as likely to find somewhere local that incurs the same level of labor disability as finding somewhere in another market. In this setting economy-wide monopsonistic competition obtains. When an individual is more likely to find their other low disutility draws in the same market, then firms within that market have local market power. This is precisely the case that obtains when $\\eta>\\theta$ ，  \n\n### B.2  Dynamic discrete choice framework  \n\nWe show that the above discrete choice framework can be adapted to an environment where some individuals draw new vectors $\\xi_{l}$ each period and reoptimize their labor supply. Firms therefore compete in a dynamic oligopoly. Restricting attention to the stationary solution of the model where firms keep employment and wages constant—as in the tradition of Burdett and Mortensen (1998)—-we show that the allocation of employment and wages once again coincide with the solution to the problem in the main text. To simplify notation we consider the problem for a market with $M$ firms $i\\in\\{1,\\ldots,M\\}$ whichmay be generalized to the model in the text.  \n\nEnvironment. Every period a random fraction $\\lambda$ of workers each draw a new vector $\\xi_{l}$ . Let $n_{i}$ be employment at firm $i$ Let $\\overline{{w}}_{i}$ be the average wage of workers at firm $i,$ such that the total wage bill in the firm is $\\overline{{w}}_{i}n_{i}$ . Let the equilibrium labor supply function $h(w_{i},w_{-i})$ determine the amount of hires a firm makes if it posts a wage $w_{i}$ when its competitors' wages in the market are given by the vector $w_{-i}$  \n\nValue function. Let $V(n_{i},\\overline{{w}}_{i})$ be the fir's present discounted value of profits, where thefirmhasdiscount rat $\\beta=1$ Then $V(n_{i},\\overline{{w}}_{i})$ satisfies:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{V\\left(n_{i},\\overline{{{w}}}_{i}\\right)}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\left(P z_{i}-\\overline{{{w}}}_{i}\\right)\\left(1-\\lambda\\right)n_{i}+{\\operatorname*{max}_{w_{i}^{\\prime}}}\\left\\{\\left(P z_{i}-w_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)h\\left(w_{i}^{\\prime},w_{-i}^{\\prime}\\right)+V\\left(n_{i}^{\\prime},\\overline{{{w}}}_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)\\right\\}}}\\ {{n_{i}^{\\prime}\\left(n_{i},w_{i}^{\\prime},w_{-i}^{\\prime}\\right)}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\left(1-\\lambda\\right)n_{i}+h\\left(w_{i}^{\\prime},w_{-i}^{\\prime}\\right)~,}}\\ {{\\overline{{{w}}}^{\\prime}\\left(n_{i},\\overline{{{w}}}_{i},w_{i}^{\\prime},w_{-i}^{\\prime}\\right)}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\cfrac{\\left(1-\\lambda\\right)\\overline{{{w}}}_{i}n_{i}+h\\left(w_{i}^{\\prime},w_{-i}^{\\prime}\\right)w_{i}^{\\prime}}{\\left(1-\\lambda\\right)n_{i}+h\\left(w_{i}^{\\prime},w_{-i}^{\\prime}\\right)}.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe firm operates a constant returns to scale production function. Of the firm's $n_{i}$ workers, a fraction $(1-\\lambda)$ do not draw new preferences. The total profit associated with these workers is then average revenue $(P z_{i})$ minus average cost $\\left(\\overline{{w}}_{i}\\right)$ . The firm chooses a new wage $\\boldsymbol{w_{i}^{\\prime}}$ to post in the market. In equilibrium, given its competitor's wages $\\omega_{-i}^{\\prime},$ it hires $h(w_{i}^{\\prime},w_{-i}^{\\prime})$ workers. The total profit associated with these workers is again average revenue $\\left(P z_{i}\\right)$ minus average cost $(w_{i}^{\\prime})$ . The second and third equations account for the evolution of the firm's state variables.  \n\nOptimality. Given its competitor's prices, the first order condition with respect to $\\boldsymbol{w_{i}^{\\prime}}$ is:  \n\n$$\n9z_{i}-w_{i}^{\\prime})h_{1}\\left(w_{i}^{\\prime},w_{-i}^{\\prime}\\right)-h\\left(w_{i}^{\\prime},w_{-i}^{\\prime}\\right)+V_{n}\\left(n_{i}^{\\prime},\\overline{{w}}_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)n_{w}^{\\prime}\\left(n_{i},w_{i}^{\\prime},w_{-i}^{\\prime}\\right)+V_{\\overline{{w}}}\\left(n_{i}^{\\prime},\\overline{{w}}_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)\\overline{{w}}_{w}\\left(n_{i},\\overline{{w}}_{i},w_{i}^{\\prime},w_{-i}^{\\prime}\\right)=0\n$$  \n\nThe relevant envelope conditions are  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c c l}{{V_{n}\\left(n_{i},\\overline{{{w}}}_{i}\\right)}}&{{=}}&{{\\left(P z_{i}-\\overline{{{w}}}_{i}\\right)\\left(1-\\lambda\\right)+V_{n}\\left(n_{i}^{\\prime},\\overline{{{w}}}_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)n_{n}^{\\prime}\\left(n_{i},w_{i}^{\\prime},w_{-i}^{\\prime}\\right)+V_{\\overline{{{w}}}}\\left(n_{i}^{\\prime},\\overline{{{w}}}_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)\\overline{{{w}}}_{n}^{\\prime}\\left(n_{i},\\overline{{{w}}}_{i},w_{i}^{\\prime},w_{-i}^{\\prime}\\right)}}\\ {{V_{\\overline{{{w}}}}\\left(n_{i},\\overline{{{w}}}_{i}\\right)}}&{{=}}&{{-\\left(1-\\lambda\\right)n_{i}+V_{\\overline{{{w}}}}\\left(n_{i}^{\\prime},\\overline{{{w}}}_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)\\overline{{{w}}}_{\\overline{{{w}}}}^{\\prime}\\left(n_{i},\\overline{{{w}}}_{i},w_{i}^{\\prime},w_{-i}^{\\prime}\\right)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIn a stationary equilibrium $\\overline{{w}}_{i}=w_{i}^{\\prime},$ and $n_{i}^{\\prime}=n_{i}$ . One can compute the partial derivatives involved in these expressions, and evaluate the conditions under stationarity to obtain  \n\n$$\n\\left(P z_{i}-w_{i}\\right)h_{1}\\left(w_{i},w_{-i}\\right)=h\\left(w_{i},w_{-i}\\right).\n$$  \n\nRearranging this expression:  \n\n$$\nw_{i}=\\frac{\\varepsilon_{i}(w_{i},w_{-i})}{\\varepsilon_{i}(w_{i},w_{-i})+1}P z_{i}\\qquad,\\qquad\\varepsilon_{i}(w_{i},w_{-i})\\quad:=\\quad\\frac{h_{1}(w_{i},w_{-i})w_{i}}{h(w_{i},w_{-i})}\n$$  \n\nThe solution to the dynamic oligopsony problem for a given supply system is identical to the solution of the static problem. In this setting, the supply system is obviously that which is obtained from the individual discrete choice problem in the previous section.  \n\nComments. This setting establishes that the model considered in the main text can also be conceived as a seting where individuals periodically receive some preference shock that causes them to relocate, and firms engage in a dynamic oligopoly given these worker decisions. When ${\\eta}>\\theta$ the shock causes a worker to consider all firms in one market very carefully to the exclusion of other markets when they are making their relocation decision. When $\\eta=\\theta$ the individual considers all firms in all markets equally.  \n\n## C Data  \n\nThis section provides additional details regarding the data sources used in the paper, sample restrictions, and construction of a number of variables.  \n\n### C.1  Census Longitudinal Business Database (LBD)  \n\nThe LBD is built on the Business Register (BR), Economic Census and surveys. The BR began in 1972 and is a database of all U.S. business establishments. The business register is also called the Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL). The SSEL contains records for all industries except private households and illegal or underground activities. Most government owned entities are not in the SSEL. The SSEL includes single and multi unit establishments. The longitudinal links are constructed using the SSEL. The database is annual.  \n\n### C.2 Sample restrictions  \n\nFor both the summary statistics and corporate tax analysis, we isolate all plants (Ibdnums) with non missing firmids, with strictly positive pay, positive employment, and non-missing county codes for the continental US (we exclude Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico). The units of payroll were manually changed from dollars to tens-of-thousands of dollars in the SSEL from 1976-1981 and 1983-1989. As a result we must remove data errors associated with this manual coding. We do so by removing firms that are in the upper two percentiles of the wage distribution while simultaneously being in the upper percentile of firm size. We then isolate allIbdnums with non-missing 2 digit NAICS codes equal to 11, 21, 31, 32, 33 or 55. These are the top tradeable 2-digit NAICS codes as defined by Delgado, Bryden, and Zyontz (2014). We use the consistent 2012 NAICS codes provided by Fort and Klimek (2018) throughout the paper. We winsorize the wage and employment at the $1\\%$ level toremove remaining outliers. Each plant has a unique firmid which corresponds to the owner of the plant.51 Throughout the paper, we define a firm to be the sum of all establishments in a commuting zone with a common firmid and NAICS3 classification.  \n\nSummary Statistics Sample: Our summary statistics include all observations that satisfy the above criteria in 1976 ane 2014 (Tables D1 and D2).  \n\nCorporate Tax Sample: The corporate tax analysis includes all observations that satisfy the above criteria between 1977 and 2011. We additionally require the firm to have at least 5 employees in order to compute direct elasticities (see Section G.3.2). The LBD begins in 1976, but we require information on lags of the wage bill share, thus 1977 is our first usable year. The tax series ends in 2012 but the Year $\\mathrm{t}{+}1^{\\prime}$ estimates require information on forward lags, thus our final usable year is 2011. We further restrict the sample to firmid-market-year observations which are corporations. To build a consistent corporation definition over time, we use both the SSEL and LBD. We identify corporations as those with SSEL Form 1120 codes which indicate $^\\prime C$ Corporation' status and LBD legal form of organization codes that also indicate $^\\prime C$ Corporation' status. Table C1 provides summary statistics for this sample.  \n\nSample NAICS Codes and Commuting Zones: Table C2 describes the NAICS 3 codes in our sample. Table C3 provides examples of commuting zones and the counties that are associated with those commuting zones.  \n\nTable C1: Regression sample summary statistics   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Variable</td><td>Mean</td><td>Std.

Average nominal payroll was $\\$673,300$ in 1976 and $\\$2,018,000$ in 2014. Average firm-market employment was 55 workers in 1976 and 35 workers in 2014. Average nominalwagewas $\\$12,255$ in 1976 and $\\$58,273$ in 2014.  \n\nTable D1B shows that different weighting schemes of across-market averages imply different levels and trends. The unweighted average wage-bill Herfindahl for wages is between two and three times larger than its payroll weighted counterpart. Little employment or payroll is located in highly concentrated markets. In both periods, 16 percent of markets have only one employer and so HHIs equal to one. However, these single firm markets only account for roughly one half of one percent of national payroll. In terms of the time-series, unweighted average wage-bil Herfindahl declines marginally between 1976 and 2014. In contrast, payroll weighted wage-bill Herfindahl declines by $23\\%$ from 0.22 to 0.17.  \n\nTable D1C confirms that the number of firms and total market employment are negatively correlated with concentration. This is important for understanding why weighted and unweighted Herfindahls are so different and will be used as an overidentifying test of the estimated model.

\n\n#### E.4.2 Production function  \n\n· In the main tet of the paper we provide the above conditions, but instead with the output as follows, which we now derive.  \n\n$$\nY=\\Omega^{1-(1-\\gamma)\\alpha}Z\\left(K^{1-\\gamma}N^{\\gamma}\\right)^{\\alpha}\n$$  \n\nwhere we also need to specify $Z$  \n\n· First we need to go remove the optimal capital decisions encoded in $\\widetilde{z}_{i j}$ and consequently $\\widetilde{z}_{j}$ and $\\widetilde{Z}$  \n\n●Recall that  \n\n$$\n\\widetilde{z}_{i j}=\\left(1-\\left(1-\\gamma\\right)\\alpha\\right)z_{i j}^{\\frac{1}{1-\\left(1-\\gamma\\right)\\alpha}}\\left(\\frac{\\left(1-\\gamma\\right)\\alpha}{R}\\right)^{\\frac{\\left(1-\\gamma\\right)\\alpha}{1-\\left(1-\\gamma\\right)\\alpha}},\\:\\widetilde{z}_{j}=\\left[\\sum_{i\\in

j\\right]^{\\frac{1+\\theta}{1+\\eta}}\n$$  \n\n·Substituting $\\widetilde{z}_{i j}$ into $\\widetilde{z}_{j},$ we can define market productivity as follows, which gives the following implication:  \n\n$$\nz_{j}:=\\left[\\sum_{i\\in j}z_{i j}^{\\frac{1+\\eta}{1-(1-\\gamma)\\alpha+\\eta(1-\\alpha)}}\\right]^{\\frac{1-(1-\\gamma)\\alpha+\\eta(1-\\alpha)}{1+\\eta}}\\implies\\widetilde{z}_{j}=(1-(1-\\gamma)\\alpha)z_{j}^{\\frac{1}{1-(1-\\gamma)\\alpha}}\\left(\\frac{(1-\\gamma)\\alpha}{R}\\right)^{\\frac{(1-\\gamma)\\alpha}{1-(1-\\gamma)\\alpha}}\n$$  \n\n· We can do the same for market and aggregate productivity:  \n\n$$\n\\pmb{Z}:=\\left[\\int z_{j}^{\\frac{1+(1-\\gamma)\\alpha+\\theta\\left(1-\\alpha\\right)}{1+\\theta\\left(1-\\alpha\\right)}}d j\\right]^{\\frac{1-(1-\\gamma)\\alpha+\\theta\\left(1-\\alpha\\right)}{1+\\theta}}\\implies\\widetilde{\\pmb{Z}}=\\left(1-(1-\\gamma)\\alpha\\right)\\pmb{Z}^{\\frac{1}{1-(1-\\gamma)\\alpha}}\\left(\\frac{(1-\\gamma)\\alpha}{R}\\right)^{\\frac{(1-\\gamma)\\alpha}{1-(1-\\gamma)\\alpha}}\\pmb{Z}^{\\frac{1}{1-(1-\\gamma)\\alpha}}\\pmb{Z}^{\\frac{1}{1+(1-\\gamma)\\alpha}}.\n$$  \n\n· Note that this implies that the relationship between $Z$ and $\\widetilde{\\mathbf Z}$ given in the text  \n\n$$\n{\\pmb Z}=\\left[\\frac{R}{\\left(1-\\gamma\\right)\\alpha}\\right]^{(1-\\gamma)\\alpha}\\left[\\frac{\\widetilde{{\\pmb Z}}}{1-\\left(1-\\gamma\\right)\\alpha}\\right]^{1-\\left(1-\\gamma\\right)\\alpha}\n$$  \n\n● Now return to the aggregate production function $\\widetilde{Y}=\\Omega\\widetilde{Z}N^{\\widetilde{\\alpha}}$ and substitute in (i the definitions of $\\widetilde{\\alpha}$ (i) ${\\tilde{\\mathbf{Z}}},$ and, (ii) $\\widetilde{Y}=\\left[1-\\left(1-\\gamma\\right)\\alpha\\right]Y,$ (iv) the aggregate capital demand condition $R=\\big(1-\\gamma\\big)\\alpha\\big(Y/K\\big),$ thsi gives the expression in Proposition 1.2:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\widetilde Y=\\Omega\\widetilde{Z}N^{\\frac{7\\alpha}{1-(1-\\gamma)\\alpha}}}\\ &{\\widetilde

\n\n$$\nz_{j}=\\left[\\sum_{i\\in j}z_{i j}^{\\frac{1+\\eta}{1-(1-\\gamma)\\alpha+\\eta(1-\\alpha)}}\\right]^{\\frac{1-(1-\\gamma)\\alpha+\\eta(1-\\alpha)}{1+\\eta}}\\quad,\\quad\\mathbf{Z}=\\left[\\int z_{j}^{\\frac{1+\\theta}{1-(1-\\gamma)\\alpha+\\theta(1-\\alpha)}}d j\\right]^{\\frac{1-(1-\\gamma)\\alpha+\\theta(1-\\alpha)}{1+\\theta}}\n$$  \n\n### E.5  Proof of Proposition 1.3 - Labor share and concentration  \n\n· Rearranging the above conditions immediately gives the labor share  \n\n$$\nL S:=\\frac{\\int\\sum_{i\\in j}w_{i j}n_{i j}d j}{\\int\\sum_{i\\in j}y_{i j}d j}=\\frac{W N}{Y}=\\gamma\\alpha\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\Omega}\\right)\n$$  \n\n·Since $\\mu$ and $\\pmb{\\Omega}$ are independent of the supply block of the model, then they are independent of aggregates and preferences, and so is the labor share. That is, we only have to solve market equilibria to compute the labor share.  \n\n· We now show that the expression linking the labor share and aggregate $H H I^{w n}$ holds.  \n\n· We can use 'tilde' objects and then scale up at the end:  \n\n$$\n\\widetilde{l s}_{i j}=\\frac{w_{i j}n_{i j}}{\\widetilde{y}_{i j}}=\\frac{w_{i j}n_{i j}}{\\widetilde{z}_{i j}n_{i j}^{\\widetilde{\\alpha}}}=\\widetilde{\\alpha}\\frac{w_{i j}}{\\widetilde{\\alpha}\\widetilde{z}_{i j}n_{i j}^{\\widetilde{\\alpha}-1}}=\\widetilde{\\alpha}\\frac{w_{i j}}{m r p l_{i j}}=\\widetilde{\\alpha}\\mu_{i j}\n$$  \n\n· Therefore the inverse of the labor share is:  \n\n$$\n\\widetilde{l s}_{i j}^{-1}=\\frac{1}{\\widetilde{\\alpha}}\\mu_{i j}^{-1}\n$$  \n\n· Note that from our earlier expression for the markdown:  \n\n$$\n\\mu_{i j}^{-1}=s_{i j t}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\theta}-\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\right)+\\frac{1}{\\eta}+1=\\frac{\\eta+1}{\\eta}+s_{i j t}\\left(\\frac{\\theta+1}{\\theta}-\\frac{\\eta+1}{\\eta}\\right)\n$$  \n\n· Now the market inverse labor share is  \n\n$$\n\\widetilde{l s}_{i j}^{-1}=\\frac{\\sum_{i\\in j}\\widetilde{y}_{i j}}{\\sum_{i\\in j}w_{i j}n_{i j}}=\\sum_{i\\in j}\\frac{w_{i j}n_{i j}}{\\sum_{i\\in j}w_{i j}n_{i j}}\\frac{\\widetilde{y}_{i j}}{w_{i j}n_{i j}}=\\sum_{i\\in j}s_{i j}\\widetilde{l s}_{i j}^{-1}\n$$  \n\nwhich using the above, gives:  \n\n$$\n\\widetilde{l s}_{i j}^{-1}=\\frac{1}{\\widetilde{\\alpha}}\\left[\\left(1-h h i_{j}\\right)\\frac{\\eta+1}{\\eta}+h h i_{j}\\frac{\\theta+1}{\\theta}\\right]\n$$  \n\nwhere hhi; = Ziej sj  \n\n· Then the aggregate labor share is as follows, where we use our definiton $\\begin{array}{r}{H H I=\\int s_{j}h h i_{j}d j}\\end{array}$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\widetilde{L S}=\\left[\\frac{\\int\\sum_{i\\in j}y_{i j}d j}{\\int\\sum_{i\\in j}w_{i j}n_{i j}d j}\\right]^{-1}}\\ &{\\quad=\\left[\\int s_{j}\\widetilde{l s}_{j}^{-1}d j\\right]^{-1}}\\ &{\\quad\\widetilde{L S}=\\widetilde{\\alpha}\\left[H H I\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta+1}\\right)^{-1}+\\left(1-H H I\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\eta}{\\eta+1}\\right)^{-1}\\right]^{-1}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n·Now note that  \n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{Y}=\\frac{1}{1-(1-\\gamma)\\alpha}\\boldsymbol{\\widetilde{Y}}\n$$  \n\ntherefore  \n\n$$\nL S=\\frac{W N}{Y}=\\frac{W N}{\\frac{1}{1-(1-\\gamma)\\alpha}\\widetilde{Y}}=\\left[1-\\left(1-\\gamma\\right)\\alpha\\right]\\widetilde{L S},\n$$  \n\nso under $\\widetilde{\\alpha}=\\alpha\\gamma/\\left(1-\\left(1-\\gamma\\right)\\alpha\\right)$ we have  \n\n$$\nL S=\\alpha\\gamma\\left[H H I\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta+1}\\right)^{-1}+(1-H H I)\\left(\\frac{\\eta}{\\eta+1}\\right)^{-1}\\right]^{-1}\n$$  \n\nThis is the expression in Proposition 1.3.  \n\n● This also established the following claims: (i) the moments $L S$ and $H H I$ are independent of aggregate preferences and shifters in labor supply and productivity which we study below $\\widetilde{A}$ and ${\\overline{{\\varphi}}},$ since the capital share is $K S=\\alpha\\left(1-\\gamma\\right)$ then this is also independent of preferences, therefore (i) we can estimate the model without specifying aggregate preferences.  \n\n### E.6  Scaling the economy  \n\n· Here we prove our claim in the text that we can choose scaling parameters for productivity and labor supply that can always be chosen to match average firm size and average worker pay without affecting any of the other moments of the economy.  \n\n· Suppose we add two constants to the above economy $\\widetilde{A}$ and $\\overline{{\\varphi}}$ such that the firm production function after optimizing out capital and the aggregate labor supply curve are:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle\\widetilde{y}_{i j}=\\widetilde{A}\\widetilde{z}_{i j}n_{i j}^{\\widetilde{\\alpha}}}}\\ {{\\displaystyle W=-\\frac{U_{N}\\left(C,N\\right)}{U_{C}\\left(C,N\\right)}=\\overline{{\\varphi}}^{-1/\\varphi}N^{1/\\varphi}C^{\\sigma}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n· We claim that we can always choose these constants to match two moments of the data: average firm size, and average workerpay.  \n\n· Note that the above labor supply curve obtains under either CRRA or GHH preferences, where GHH preferences are thecaseof $\\sigma=0$  \n\n$$\nU(C,N)=\\frac{C^{1-\\sigma}}{1-\\sigma}-\\overline{{{\\varphi}}}^{-1/\\varphi}\\frac{N^{1+\\frac{1}{\\varphi}}}{1+\\frac{1}{\\varphi}}\\quad,\\quad U(C,N)=u\\left(C-\\overline{{{\\varphi}}}^{-1/\\varphi}\\frac{N^{1+\\frac{1}{\\varphi}}}{1+\\frac{1}{\\varphi}}\\right)\n$$  \n\n· Note that this implies that the changes to the set of equilibrium conditions are that aggregate output, labor demand and labor supply are:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{}}&{{}}&{{\\widetilde{Y}=\\Omega\\widetilde{A}\\widetilde{Z}N^{\\widetilde{\\alpha}}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{W=\\mu\\widetilde{\\alpha}\\widetilde{A}\\widetilde{Z}N^{\\widetilde{\\alpha}-1}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{N=\\overline{{{\\varphi}}}W^{\\varphi}C^{-\\sigma\\varphi}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nCombined these imply the same expression for the labor share:  \n\n$$\nW N=\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\Omega}\\right)\\widetilde{\\alpha}\\widetilde{Y}\n$$  \n\nwhich gives  \n\n$$\n\\widetilde{Y}=\\frac{W N}{\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\Omega}\\right)\\widetilde{\\alpha}}\n$$  \n\n.

Then given data on $A v e F i r m S i z e^{D a t a}$ and AveWorkerPayData , we can put data into the first two expressions above, and use these to compute $N$ and $W$ . Given these we can use the remaining equations to compute all other aggregate quantities $\\{Y,C,K\\}$ . What remains is to choose $\\widetilde{A}$ and $\\overline{{\\varphi}}$ to be consistent with these aggregates. For this we use the two conditions that have not been used above by themselves: output and labor supply  \n\n$$\n\\widetilde{Y}=\\Omega\\widetilde{A}\\widetilde{Z}N^{\\widetilde{\\alpha}}\\quad,\\quad N=\\overline{{{\\varphi}}}W^{\\varphi}C^{-\\sigma\\varphi},\n$$  \n\nwhich imply that  \n\n$$\n\\widetilde{A}=\\frac{\\widetilde{Y}}{\\Omega\\widetilde{Z}N^{\\widetilde{\\alpha}}}\\quad,\\quad\\overline{{{\\varphi}}}=\\frac{N}{W^{\\varphi}C^{-\\sigma\\varphi}}.\n$$  \n\n● Proceeding in this way we can always choose shifters $\\widetilde{A}$ and $\\overline{{\\varphi}}$ in order to match data on average firm size and average worker pay.  \n\n● Once these are pinned down, then the system of equilibrium conditions without the moment conditions can be solved.

Suppose that the firm can deduct some portion of its capital expenses $\\lambda_{K}$ This corresponds to the fraction of capital expenses that are financed by long-term debt.  \n\n· Accounting profits of the firm, on which taxes are based, are given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\pi_{i}^{A}=z_{i}k_{i}^{1-\\gamma}n_{i}^{\\gamma}-w_{i}n_{i}-\\underbrace{\\lambda_{K}R k_{i}}_{\\qquad}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n· The economic profits of the firm are  \n\n$$\n\\pi_{i}^{E}=z_{i}k_{i}^{1-\\gamma}n_{i}^{\\gamma}-w_{i}n_{i}-R k_{i}\n$$  \n\n● The after tax profits are given by  \n\n$$\n\\pi_{i}=\\pi_{i}^{E}-\\tau_{C}\\pi_{i}^{A}\n$$  \n\n· This gives, the following which reflects the idea that on net the firm pays corporate taxes on its total economic profits, and then is reimbursed for the taxes paid on capital financed by debt.  \n\n$$\n\\pi_{i}=(1-\\tau_{C})\\left[z_{i}k_{i}^{1-\\gamma}n_{i}^{\\gamma}-w_{i}n_{i}-R k_{i}\\right]+\\tau_{C}\\lambda_{K}R k_{i}\n$$  \n\n· Dividing by $(1-\\tau_{C})$ , the firm maximizes  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi_{i}}{1-\\tau_{C}}=z_{i}k_{i}^{1-\\gamma}n_{i}^{\\gamma}-w_{i}n_{i}-\\underbrace{\\left(\\frac{1-\\tau_{C}\\lambda_{K}}{1-\\tau_{C}}\\right)R k_{i}}_{\\mathrm{Termis}>1}\n$$  \n\n· The effective rental rate of capital $\\widetilde{R}\\left(R,\\tau_{C},\\lambda_{K}\\right)$ that the firm faces is now higher than $R$ due to the fact that not all of capital expenses can be deducted, while all of its labor expenses can. This causes the firm to take on a sub-optimal amount of capital. This lowers the marginal revenue product of other factors, including labor. If the firm could deduct all of its capital costs, then $\\lambda_{K}=1$ , and the firm's input decisions are undistorted.  \n\n● Substituting in the firm's capital decision into their production function gives  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\pi_{i}}{1-\\tau_{C}}=\\widetilde{z}\\left(z_{i},R,\\tau_{C},\\lambda_{K}\\right)n_{i}-w_{i}n_{i}}}\\ {{\\mathrm{}}}\\ {{\\widetilde{z}\\left(z_{i},R,\\tau_{C},\\lambda_{K}\\right)=\\gamma z_{i}^{\\frac{1}{\\gamma}}\\left(\\displaystyle\\frac{1-\\gamma}{\\widetilde{R}\\left(R,\\tau_{C},\\lambda_{K}\\right)}\\right)^{\\frac{1-\\gamma}{\\gamma}}=\\gamma z_{i}^{\\frac{1}{\\gamma}}\\left(\\displaystyle\\frac{1-\\tau_{C}}{1-\\tau_{C}\\lambda_{K}}\\displaystyle\\frac{1-\\gamma}{R}\\right)^{\\frac{1-\\gamma}{\\gamma}}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n· The marginal product of labor $\\widetilde{z}_{i}$ is now lower due to the presence of corporate taxes and deductibility of interest payments Ondebt.  \n\n### E.10 Mergers - Proposition 3.1  \n\n● In this section we prove the claims in Proposition 3.1. These are listed in a different order in Proposition 3.1, but here listed in the order that they are proved:  \n\n1. Following a merger, the markdowns at the merged firms are equalized and depend on the total market share, $\\mu_{1j}=\\mu_{2j}=\\mu\\left(s_{1j}+s_{2j}\\right)$  \n\n2. Under either monopsony limit a merger has no effect on any labor market variables.  \n\n3. The individual shares $s_{i j}$ of all non-merging firms increase. Therefore the total market share of merging firms falls.  \n\n4. The wage index of non-merging firms decreases and employment index increases.  \n\n5. Market wage $w_{j}$ and employment ${\\pmb n}_{j}$ decline, so total market pay $\\begin{array}{r}{w_{j}n_{j}=\\sum_{i\\in j}w_{i j}n_{i j}}\\end{array}$ declines.  \n\n6. The wages of both merging firms $w_{1j}$ and $w_{2j}$ decline. The wage index of merging firms decreases and employment index decreases.  \n\n· Parts 1 and 2 we prove under decreasing returns to scale. The remainder we establish under constant returns to scale The proof of Part 3 is the most involved, and remaining parts follow from Part 3 in a straight-forward manner.  \n\n#### E.10.1 Markdowns  \n\n· Throughout we assume $M_{j}\\geq3.$ and assign $i=1$ and $i^{\\prime}=2$ to the two merging firms.  \n\n● A merged firm chooses employment at both firms to maximize profits, where without loss of generality for this proof we can consider the case of a production function $f(\\cdot)$ that already incorporates the (competitive) intermediate and capital choices  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{max}_{n_{1j},n_{2j}}\\left[f\\left(z_{1j},n_{1j}\\right)-w\\left(n_{1j},n_{-1j}\\right)n_{1j}\\right]+\\left[f\\left(z_{2j},n_{2j}\\right)-w\\left(n_{2j},n_{-2j}\\right)n_{2j}\\right]\n$$  \n\n· When taking the first order condition, the firm understands that $n_{2j}$ appears in ${\\pmb{n}}_{-1j}$ and vice versa.  \n\n· The first order condition for $n_{1j}$ is as follows, where we use $m r p l_{1j}=f_{n}\\left(z_{1j},n_{1j}\\right)$ to denote the marginal revenue prodt of labor  \n\n$$\n\\left(m r p l_{1j}-\\frac{\\partial w_{2j}}{\\partial n_{1j}}n_{2j}\\right)=\\frac{\\partial w_{1j}}{\\partial n_{1j}}n_{1j}+w_{1j}\n$$  \n\n· Written this way we can see that in understanding that increasing $n_{1j}$ increases the wage at firm 2, maps into an effectiv reduction in productivity at firm 1.  \n\nRecall that  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{w_{1j}=n_{1j}^{\\frac{1}{\\eta}}n_{j}^{\\frac{1}{\\theta}-\\frac{1}{\\eta}}X}}\\ {{w_{2j}=n_{2j}^{\\frac{1}{\\eta}}n_{j}^{\\frac{1}{\\theta}-\\frac{1}{\\eta}}X}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n●Using this expression  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{m r p l_{1j}-w_{1j}=\\left(\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\eta}+\\left(\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\theta}-\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\right)s_{1j}\\right)w_{1j}+\\left(\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\theta}-\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\right)s_{1j}\\frac{w_{2j}n_{2j}}{n_{1j}}}}\\ {{m r p l_{1j}-w_{1j}=\\left(\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\eta}+\\left(\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\theta}-\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\right)s_{1j}\\right)w_{1j}+\\left(\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\theta}-\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\right)s_{2j}w_{1j}}}\\ {{m r p l_{1j}-w_{1j}=\\left[\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\eta}+\\left(\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\theta}-\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\right)\\left(s_{1j}+s_{2j}\\right)\\right]w_{1j}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n·Therefore $w_{1j}=\\mu\\left(s_{1j}+s_{2j}\\right)m r p l_{1j}$ Note that the same algebra can be applied to firm 2. Therefore this establishes the first result:  \n\n$$\n\\mu_{1j}^{\\prime}=\\mu_{2j}^{\\prime}=\\mu\\left(s_{1j}^{\\prime}+s_{2j}^{\\prime}\\right)\n$$  \n\n● Note that the above algebra generalizes in a straight-forward way to the case of an arbitrary set of firms merging. Let the set of merging firms be $A$ then  \n\n$$\n\\mu_{i j}^{\\prime}=\\mu\\left(s_{j A}^{\\prime}\\right)\\quad s_{j A}^{\\prime}=\\sum_{i\\in A}s_{i j}^{\\prime}.\n$$  \n\n#### E.10.2  No effect of mergers in monopsony  \n\n· Consider the above problem of the merged firm in a monopsonistically competitive labor market  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{max}_{n_{1j},n_{2j}}\\left[f\\left(z_{1j},n_{1j}\\right)-w\\left(n_{1j}\\right)n_{1j}\\right]+\\left[f\\left(z_{2j},n_{2j}\\right)-w\\left(n_{2j}\\right)n_{2j}\\right]\n$$  \n\n· Here the wage depends on ${\\pmb n}_{j}$ but since the firm is infintessimal, it does not internalize its effect on $\\pmb{n}_{j}$  \n\n● The first order condition for firm 1 employment is:  \n\n$$\nm r p l_{1j}=w^{\\prime}\\left(n_{1j}\\right)n_{1j}+n_{1j}\n$$  \n\n● This is identical to the first order condition of firm 1 in the pre-merger economy. Therefore there is no effect at all on employment and wages.  \n\n#### E.10.3 Shares of all non-merging firms increase. Therefore the combined share of merging firms falls.  \n\nGroups - A useful concept is that of a grouping within a market. Split the firms in the market into those that merge $i\\in A$ and hose that don't merge $i\\in B$  \n\n· Define the group-level employment and wage indexes:  \n\n$$\nn_{j G}=\\left[\\sum_{i\\in G}n_{i j}^{\\frac{\\eta+1}{\\eta}}\\right]^{\\frac{\\eta}{\\eta+1}}\\quad,\\quad w_{j G}=\\left[\\sum_{i\\in G}w_{i j}^{\\eta+1}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{\\eta+1}}\\quad,\\quad G\\in\\{A,B\\}\n$$  \n\n· It is straight-forward to use these definitions to show that the market indices are  \n\n$$\n\\pmb{n}_{j}=\\left[\\pmb{n}_{j A}^{\\frac{\\eta+1}{\\eta}}+\\pmb{n}_{j B}^{\\frac{\\eta+1}{\\eta}}\\right]^{\\frac{\\eta}{\\eta+1}}\\quad,\\quad\\pmb{w}_{j}=\\left[\\pmb{w}_{j A}^{\\eta+1}+\\pmb{w}_{j B}^{\\eta+1}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{\\eta+1}}\n$$  \n\n● These can then be used to derive group level supply curves and share relationships:  \n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_{j G}=\\left(\\frac{w_{j G}}{w_{j}}\\right)^{\\eta}\\boldsymbol{n}_{j},\\boldsymbol{w}_{j G}\\boldsymbol{n}_{j G}=\\sum_{i\\in G}w_{i j}\\boldsymbol{n}_{i j},\\boldsymbol{s}_{j G}:=\\frac{\\sum_{i\\in G}w_{i j}\\boldsymbol{n}_{i j}}{\\sum_{i\\in j}w_{i j}\\boldsymbol{n}_{i j}}=\\sum_{i\\in G}s_{i j}=\\left(\\frac{w_{j G}}{w_{j}}\\right)^{\\eta+1}=\\left(\\frac{n_{j G}}{n_{j}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\eta+1}{\\eta}}\n$$  \n\n· For individual firms, then we can allocate labor relative to the group, and derive a relative share $\\widetilde{s}_{i G}$ ofgroupwages. which we can show is equal to overall market share divided by group market share.  \n\n$$\nn_{i j}=\\left(\\frac{w_{i j}}{w_{j G}}\\right)^{\\eta}n_{j G}\\mathrm{~,~}\\widetilde{s}_{i G}:=\\frac{w_{i j}n_{i j}}{\\sum_{i\\in G}w_{i j}n_{i j}}=\\left(\\frac{w_{i j}}{w_{j G}}\\right)^{\\eta+1}=\\frac{s_{i j}}{s_{j G}}\n$$  \n\nemmas - We can use these definitions to establish three Lemmas that will be useful in proving the remaining content of the roposition. Proofs for each Lemma is at the end of this appendix.  \n\n● Lemma 1- Consider some change in a market that directly effects some group of firms $i\\in{\\cal A}$ Then the shares of all other firms $i\\in B=\\mathbb{Z}\\backslash A,$ change in the same direction. (Proof at the end of this appendix)   \nLemma 2 - Merging firms (Proof at the end of this appendix) 1. In terms of wage changes: $\\Delta\\log w_{1}>\\Delta\\log w_{2}$ 2. The relative share of the most productive of the merging firms increases $\\widetilde{s}_{1A}^{\\prime}>\\widetilde{s}_{1A}$  \n\n● Lemma 3 - For non-merging firms, if $s_{i j}^{\\prime}>s_{i j}$ then $n_{i j}^{\\prime}>n_{i j}$ (Proof at the end of this appendix)  \n\nWe are now ready to prove the proposition: The shares of all non-merging firms increase.  \n\n● Applying Lemma 1, we know that the shares of non-merging firms either (i) all decrease, or (i) all increase. We proceed by contradiction. Suppose: All non-merging firms' shares decrease: $s_{i j}^{\\prime}<s_{i j}$ for all $i\\in B$  \n\n1. Since all non-merging firms' shares decrease then $s_{j B}^{\\prime}<s_{j B}$ . Since $s_{j A}+s_{j B}=1,$ then the total share of merging firmsincreases: $s_{j A}^{\\prime}>s_{j A}$ From Lemma 2.2 we know that the relative share of the most productive merging firm increases: $\\tilde{s}_{1A}^{\\prime}>\\dot{\\tilde{s}}_{1A}$ Since $s_{1j}=\\widetilde{s}_{1A}s_{j A},$ and $\\pmb{s}_{j A}$ increases, then $s_{1j}^{\\prime}>s_{1j}\\left(*\\right)$ Since $s_{j A}^{\\prime}>s_{j A}$ ,then by definition  \n\n$$\ns_{1j}^{\\prime}+s_{2j}^{\\prime}>s_{1j}+s_{2j}\n$$  \n\ntherefore  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{\\mu\\left(s_{1j}^{\\prime}+s_{2j}^{\\prime}\\right)z_{1j}<\\mu\\left(s_{1j}+s_{2j}\\right)z_{1j}}}\\ {{w_{1j}^{\\prime}<w_{1j}\\quad\\left(\\ast\\ast\\right)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nCombined $(*)$ and $(**)\\mathrm{imply}$ thatfmwsfalin haen $s_{i j}=\\left(w_{i j}/w_{j}\\right)^{1+\\eta}$ this requires the market wage to be falling: $w_{j}^{\\prime}<w_{j}$ (#)。  \n\n2. By our supposition, all non-merging firms shares decrease, $s_{i j}^{\\prime}<s_{i j},$ which since $w_{i j}^{\\prime}=\\mu\\left(s_{i j}^{\\prime}\\right)z_{i j},$ implies that $w_{i j}^{\\prime}>w_{i j}$ for ll non-merging firms. But since $s_{i j}=\\left(w_{i j}/w_{j}\\right)^{1+\\eta}$ then if $s_{i j}^{\\prime}<s_{i j}$ and $w_{i j}^{\\prime}>w_{i j},$ then it must be that $w_{j}^{\\prime}>w_{j}$ (#)  \n\n● Contradiction. The market wage can not be increasing (#) and decreasing (#)  \n\n· Therefore all non-merging firms' shares increase. It is then immediate that the combined share of the merging firms decrease? $s_{j A}^{\\prime}<s_{j A}$  \n\n#### .10.4  Wage index of non-merging firms ${\\boldsymbol{w}}_{j B}$ decreases, and employment index ${\\pmb n}_{j B}$ increases  \n\nConsider a non-merging firm $i\\in B$ Since $z_{i j}$ is fixed, and by the above $s_{i j}^{\\prime}>s_{i j},$ then $\\mu\\left(s_{i j}^{\\prime}\\right)<\\mu\\left(s_{i j}\\right).$ \\$0 $w_{i j}^{\\prime}<w_{i j}$ Since $w_{j B}^{1+\\eta}=\\sum_{i\\in B}w_{i j}^{1+\\eta}.$ ${w_{j B}^{\\prime}<w_{j B}}$ From Lema3 sine $s_{i j}^{\\prime}>s_{i j},$ then $n_{i j}^{\\prime}>n_{i j}$ Since $\\begin{array}{r}{\\pmb{n}_{j B}^{(\\eta+1)/\\eta}=\\sum_{i\\in B}n_{i j}^{(\\eta+1)/\\eta}}\\end{array}$ (y+1)/n, then nB >njB.  \n\n#### E.10.5 Market wage $\\boldsymbol{w}_{j}$ and market employment ${\\pmb n}_{j}$ both decrease  \n\nSince for n-merging firms their shareis increasig $s_{i j}^{\\prime}>s_{i j}$ Whil their wages ae flling $w_{i j}^{\\prime}<w_{i j},$ and $s_{i j}=\\Big(w_{i j}/w_{j}\\Big)^{1+\\eta}.$ then it must be that the market wage is falling: $w_{j}^{\\prime}>w_{j}$ Since $w_{j}^{\\prime}<w_{j},$ then by market labor supply ${\\pmb n}_{j}^{\\prime}<{\\pmb n}_{j}$  \n\nE.10.6  The wages of both merging firms $w_{1j}$ and $w_{2j}$ fall. The merging firms' index $w_{j A}$ and employ ment index ${\\pmb n}_{j A}$ falls.  \n\n● From Lemma 2.1, we know that $\\Delta\\log w_{1}>\\Delta\\log w_{2}$  \n\n- Suppose that $w_{2j}^{\\prime}>w_{2j}$ Then the above implies that $w_{1}^{\\prime}>w_{1}$ .As $w_{j}^{\\prime}<w_{j}$ , whil the merging firms' wages $s_{i j}=\\left(w_{i j}/w_{j}\\right)^{1+\\eta}$ $s_{j A}^{\\prime}>s_{j A}$ Contradiction. (Since we have already shown that the total share of merging firms decreases). Therefore $w_{2j}^{\\prime}<$ $w_{2j}$ - Suppose that $w_{1j}^{\\prime}>w_{1j},$ this requires $\\mu\\left(s_{1}^{\\prime}+s_{2}^{\\prime}\\right)>\\mu\\left(s_{1}\\right)$ which requires that $s_{1}^{\\prime}+s_{2}^{\\prime}<s_{1}$ . This requires $s_{1}^{\\prime}<s_{1}$ But we have shown thata $w_{j}^{\\prime}<w_{j},$ so if $w_{1j}^{\\prime}>w_{1j},$ then $s_{1j}^{\\prime}>s_{1j}$ Contradiction.

For computational reasons, we must cap the number of firms per market since the Pareto distribution has a fat tail. We set the cap equal to 200 firms per market. Our results are not sensitive to the number of markets or the cap on firms per market.  \n\nTradeable firm distribution. Figure F1 (left) plots the distribution from which we draw the number of firms per market, $M_{j}$ . The distribution is a mixture of a discrete mass point at $M_{j}=1$ and a Pareto distribution over the support $M_{j}\\in[2,\\infty]$ .The Pareto's shape, scale, and location parameters are set to minimize the distance with the first three moments of the tradeable firm distribution.

We rerun our reduced-form regressions on the simulated data in order to recover average reduced-form labor supply elasticities as a function of wage-bill shares. These market-share-dependent reduced-form labor supply elasticities are the moments used to recover $\\eta$ and $\\theta$ in Section 2. We describe the details of the exercisebelow:  \n\n1. Simulate the benchmark equilibrium for two periods (date $t=0,1$ ) without taxes. Treat these observations as 'data.' We must simulate two prior periods in order to define the lagged wage-bill share of the firm in the market.   \n2. C-corps in the model economy (recall there is a share $\\omega_{C}$ of C-corps in all markets) have their taxes raised by 1 percentage point.   \n3. Simulate the ‘post-shock' equilibrium, treat as date $t=2$ 'data.'   \n4. Estimate the same reduced-form regressions as Section 2 using the $t=0,1,2$ simulated data. Estimate the following regressions for each firm $i$ in region $j;$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\log(n_{i j t})=\\alpha_{i}+\\beta_{n}\\tau_{C t}+\\gamma_{0s}s_{i j t-1}+\\beta_{n s}\\tau_{C t}*s_{i j t-1}+\\epsilon_{i j t}}\\ &{\\log(w_{i j t})=\\alpha_{i}+\\beta_{w}\\tau_{C t}+\\omega_{0s}s_{i j t-1}+\\beta_{w s}\\tau_{C t}*s_{i j t-1}+u_{i j t}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n5. Compute the employment and wage elastities with respect to poductivity, $\\frac{d\\log(n_{i j t})}{d\\tau_{C t}}$ and $\\frac{d\\log(w_{i j t})}{d\\tau_{C t}}$ Usethesexpressions to recover the average reduced-form labor supply elasticities using the formula:  \n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\epsilon}(s_{i j t-1})=\\frac{\\beta_{n}+\\beta_{n s}s_{i j t-1}}{\\beta_{w}+\\beta_{w s}s_{i j t-1}}\n$$  \n\n6. Use the recovered $\\{{\\widehat{\\epsilon}}(s_{i j t-1}),s_{i j t-1}\\}$ pairs as moments to recover $\\eta$ and $\\theta$  \n\n### F.3 Biases  \n\nTo explore the difference between structural and reduced-form labor supply elasticities, we conduct a Monte Carlo exercise where we simulate a perfectly idiosyncratic shock and then compute reduced form elasticities. We average these across firms within payroll share bins and compare these to the structural labor supply elasticity implied by $\\varepsilon(s_{i j})=[\\theta^{-1}s_{i j}+\\eta^{-1}(1-$ $s_{i j})]^{-1}$ . We repeat this exercise for 5,000 simulations and report the averages in Figure 6. We describe the details of the exercise below:  \n\n1. Simulate the benchmark equilibrium, treat as date $t=1$ 'data.'   \n2. Randomly select 1 firms in each market and increase their productivity by $1\\%$ $20\\%$ or $50\\%$ ), holding aggregates fixed (assuming partial equilibrium).   \n3. Simulate 'post-shock' partial equilibrium (industry competitors adjust but aggregates are held fixed), treat as date $t=2$ 'data.'  \n\n4. Isolate firms with pre-shock wage-bill shares $s_{i j}$ in bins with nodes [1, ...,.9]. Within each bin, compute the mean of $\\Delta\\log(n_{i j t})/\\Delta\\log(w_{i j t})$ using the $t=1,2$ simulated data.  \n\n5. Figure 6 plots these values at the upper cutoff of these bins. For shares equal to O and 1, the solution is exact $\\varepsilon(1)=$ $\\widehat{\\epsilon}(1)=\\theta,\\varepsilon(0)=\\widehat{\\epsilon}(0)=\\eta$  \n\n### F4  Additional threats to consistency.  \n\nThere are two additional threats to consistency of our simulations. (i) apportionment of state taxes across multi-state production units may mean that state corporate taxes do not affect firms within a state, and (i) anticipation of tax changes. We discuss these issues in the context of prior analysis by Suarez Serrato and Zidar (2016) and Giroud and Rauh (2019).  \n\nFirst, Suarez Serrato and Zidar (2016) show that the impact of state corporate taxes on local economic activity is extremely similar for both (i) the statutory corporate taxes used here, and (i) effective corporate taxes—-i.e. business taxes'—-carefully adjusted for apportionment weights.52 Since establishment sales and company property alues are not available to us, we cannot construct accurate apportionment weights and thus we focus on statutory tax rates compiled by Giroud and Rauh (2019). We only require similarly sized firms to face similarly sized shocks. The magnitude of the shock is not important for our identification of $\\eta$ and $\\theta_{\\cdot}$ instead it is their relative employment to wage adjustment that identifies $\\eta$ and $\\theta$  \n\nSecond, both Suarez Serrato and Zidar (2016) and Giroud and Rauh (2019) establish that including various aspects of changes to fiscal policy around corporate tax adjustments have negligible affects on their measured elasticities of local economic activity to state corporate taxes.53 We interpret this as indirect evidence that the reforms are not paired with other predictable components of fiscal stimulus, such as unemployment insurance, which follow time-invariant threshold rules and are typically triggered in recessions (e.g. Mitman and Rabinovich (2019)).  \n\n## G  Discussion of empirical estimation and robustness  \n\nThis section is divided into three parts. First, a discussion of how our empirical strategy relates to other papers in the literature. Second, including exit in our regressions and re-estimating the model under exit. Third, a set of robustness exercises around state-level omitted variables, non-wage compensation, variation in capital intensity, and an alternative approach using 'direct elasticities.  \n\n### G.1 Discussion  \n\nAs discussed in Section 1.4, the model predicts that the labor supply elasticity faced by firms varies by their market share. If this relationship were known in the data, it would precisely pin down the elasticities of substitution of labor within and across sectors. Existing work estimating labor supply elasticities to firms has focused either on specific markets (e.g. (Webber, 2016) or in well identified responses to small experimental variations in wages (Dube, Jacobs, Naidu, and Suri, 2020; Dube, Cengiz, Lindner, and Zipperer, 2019). A contribution of this paper is to estimate a share-elasticity relationship through a novel quasi-natural experiment using a large cross-section of firms.  \n\nThe intuition for our procedure is as follows. We first estimate the rate at which labor demand shocks pass-through to wages and employment and the reduced-form relationship between these labor supply elasticities and local labor market shares. We then invert this empirical relationship using our model to recover estimates of the structural parameters that control the relative substitutability of labor within and between markets. To identify how pass-through rates vary by market share, we compare low the firm responds to these labor demand shocks differentially across markets within the same state, but in which their shares of the labor market differ.  \n\nThis procedure requires a shock to labor demand in order to trace out the labor supply curve. We use state corporate tax changes which constitute a shock to firm labor demand via their distortion of accounting profits relative to economic profits, shifting the marginal revenue product of labor.54 Both Suarez Serrato and Zidar (2016) and Giroud and Rauh (2019) have studied the impact of state-level corporate tax shocks on local economic activity. We address three issues that may arise: (i) apportionment of state taxes across multi-state production units may mean that state corporate taxes do not affect firms within a state, (i) taxes are anticipated, (i) such shocks affect all firms in a region and so can only be used to identify $\\theta$  \n\nFirst, Suarez Serrato and Zidar (2016) show that the impact of corporate taxes on local economic activity is extremely similar for both (i the statutory corporate taxes that we use and (i) effective corporate taxes adjusted for apportionment weights.5 Since establishment sales and company property values are not available to us, we focus on statutory taxes rates compiled by Giroud and Rauh (2019) and based on Suarez Serrato and Zidar (2016) we do not adjust for the apportionment regime of the Sstate.  \n\nSecond, both Suarez Serrato and Zidar (2016) and Giroud and Rauh (2019) establish that the inclusion of other aspects of changes to fiscal policy around the corporate tax changes does not affect their measured elasticities of local economic activity tocorporatetaxes.56  \n\nThird, the fact that (i) only C-corps pay statutory corporate tax rates, (i the structure of our model and (i) Monte Carlo exercises, provide support that we may infer $\\eta$ and $\\theta$ from a shock that affects some but not all firms. We briefly discuss this in more detail.  \n\n### G.2Exits  \n\n#### G.2.1 Empirics  \n\nIn Table G1, we estimate linear probability models of firm-market exit in year $t+1$ as a function of corporate taxes in year $t$ . In column (1) and (2), we find economically insignificant results. This complements the work of Giroud and Rauh (2019), who aggregate plants at the firm-state level and study how the number of plants per C-Corp in a state responds to corporate tax changes. Since our relevant level of economic activity is at the firm-market level, and since we are interested in exits from the market entirely, we use a different approach. We regress whether a firm exits a firm-market entirely, instead of simply regressing the number of plants in the state on the tax change. Our results do not necessary contradict Giroud and Rauh (2019). Giroud and Rauh (2019)'s results imply that firms may adjust the number of plants in the state. Our results imply that firms do not appear to be exiting markets entirely in response to a corporate tax change.  \n\n#### G.2.2 Model re-estimation with exit  \n\nOur empirical results suggest that exits are not a threat to our exercise. Nonetheless, we show that our model estimates of $\\eta$ and $\\theta$ are robust under the assumption that $5\\%$ of C-Corps exit. This is an extreme and counterfactually high exit response to corporate tax hikes. Table G2 reports the results. Our estimates of $\\eta$ and $\\theta$ are similar to the baseline.  \n\nTable G1: Exit probability   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1) Exitijt+1</td><td>(2) Exitijt+1</td></tr><tr><td>Ts(j)t</td><td>-0.000447 (0.000556) [0.000168]</td><td>-0.000938 (0.000771) [0.000194]</td></tr><tr><td>FixedEffects R-squared</td><td>Market,Year 0.042</td><td>Firmid,Market,Year 0.218</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>2.844e+06</td><td>2.844e+06</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNotes: According to Census requirements, the number of observations is rounded to the nearest 1,000.

We consider (i) state-level omitted variables, (i compute direct elasticities at the firm level, (i) account for systematic variation in non-wage compensation, (iv) account for systematic variation in capital intensity.  \n\n#### G.3.1 State-level omitted variables  \n\nModel estimation simply requires consistent auxiliary moments that can be simulated. The threat to consistency when we estimate equation 13 is that there are other forces moving employment and wages at the state-year level, e.g. tax cuts occur in boom years etc. To control for state-level responses, Giroud and Rauh (2019) include S-Corps as a control for C-Corps. Through the lens of our theory, S-Corps do not provide a suitable control group, since they respond to the treatment as well. Thus, the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) is violated. To alleviate concerns that our estimates are being driven by omitted state-year level variation, we include specifications which include both state $\\times$ year fixed effects as well as firmid $\\times$ market fixed effects. State-level corporate tax changes are subsumed in the fixed effects, and so we are only able to identify the interaction between corporate taxes and wage-bill shares. Table G3 illustrates our results. Comparing columns (1) through (4) in Table G3 to Table 1, we find very similar interactions between taxes and wage-bill shares for both date $t$ and $t+1$ employment and wages. We view these results as suggestive evidence that omitted variables at the state-year level are unlikely to explain our results.  \n\n#### G.3.2 Direct elasticities  \n\nTo provide further evidence that labor supply elasticities decline as a function of a firm's wage-bill share, we directly compute the ratio of wage changes to employment changes at the firm-level and we study their relationship to a firm's wage-bill share.

Column (1) shows that the inverse elasticity for firms with wage bill shares between $1\\%$ and $5\\%$ is significantly different from those whose wage-bill shares are less than $1\\%$ . Their inverse elasticity is .0476 percentage points greater. Based on our estimates in Table 2, if firms with a wage-bill share less than $1\\%$ have a labor supply elasticity of 2, then these estimates imply that firms with a wage bill share between $1\\%$ and $5\\%$ have a labor supply elasticity of roughly 1.83. For those with wage-bill shares greater than $5\\%$ , their inverse elasticity increases by 0.075 percentage points relative to those with a wage-bill share less than $1\\%$ . Based on our estimates in Table 2, if firms with a wage-bill share less than $1\\%$ have a labor supply elasticity of 2, then these estimates imply that firms with a wage bill share greater than $5\\%$ have a labor supply elasticity of roughly 1.74. Lastly, column (2) estimates the inverse labor supply elasticity using changes in employment and wages between $t$ and $t+2,$ while keeping the same and all other right-hand-side regressors in equation (H1) the same. We interpret column (2) as a long-run inverse labor supply elasticity. Relative to the omitted group of firms with shares less than $1\\%$ We find that firms with wage-bill shares greater than $5\\%$ have an inverse elasticity that is 0.0959 percentage points greater. Based on our estimates in Table 2, if firms with a wage-bill share less than $1\\%$ have a labor supply elasticity of 2, then these estimates imply that firms with a wage bill share greater than $5\\%$ have a labor supply elasticity of roughly 1.68. These estimates are remarkably close to our linear regression estimates in Section 2.2.

See text for details.  \n\n#### G.3.3  Non-wage compensation  \n\nCan our results be attributed to non-wage benefits that vary by size? We argue no. We find that while benefits covary positively vith wage-bill share, they cannot explain the magnitude of size-dependent markdowns we estimate in the data.  \n\nTo bound the effect of benefits on our markdowns, we must measure the elasticity of benefits with respect to the wagebill share of the firm. The Census of Manufacturers includes data on worker benefits in recent survey waves. We use the 2012 Census of Manufacturers to estimate how benefits per employee varies with local wage-bill shares. To mitigate spurious correlations between market-share and benefits, we include firm fixed effects. Thus our empirics compare within a firm, across plants, how local wage-bill shares covary with benefits. Table H3 includes our results. We find that a 1 percentage point increase in the wage bill share results in a $0.597\\%$ increase in benefits per worker. We repeat the exercise after winsorizing benefits per worker atthe $1\\%$ level, and we find a very similar elasticity; thus, our low elasticity of benefit per worker with wage-bill share is not driven by outliers.  \n\nFigure H3 plots the elasticity of the model's markdowns as a function of the wage-bill share. For wage-bill shares of $1\\%,$ the elasticity of the wage-bill share is close to $-6\\%$ . Thus non-wage benefits are too small to be responsible for our estimated markdown elasticities.  \n\n#### G.3.4 Capital Intensity  \n\nThe Census of Manufacturers includes data on assets per employee.59 We use the 2012 Census of Manufacturers to estimate how assets per employee varies with local wage-bill shares. We include firm (firmid) fixed effects to isolate within-firm, acrossplant variation in the way assets per employee covaries with local wage-bill shares. Table H3 includes our results. We find that a 1 percentage point increase in the wage bill share results in a $0.176\\%$ increase in assets per employee. Our mean value of assets per employee in this sample of multi-plant firms is $\\$332,500$ . Thus a 1 percentage point increase in wage-bill share corresponds to an increase in assets of $\\$595$ for the average firm. We view this as economically insignificant. Column (2) removes outliers by winsorizing the data at the $1\\%$ level. We find a slightly larger elasticity, however, we view these results as supportive evidence that our size-dependent labor supply elasticities cannot be explained by differential capital adjustment.  \n\nTable G4: Estimation results for equation (H1)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1) (2) Inverseelasticity ttot+1Inverseelasticity ttot+2</td></tr><tr><td>1(|△Ts(j)t| > .5) × Sijt-1 ∈ [.01,.05) 0.0476**</td><td>-0.00314 (0.0409)</td></tr><tr><td>1(↓△Ts(j)t| > .5) × Sijt-1 E [.05, 1]</td><td>(0.0208) [0.0221] [0.0421] 0.0741** 0.0959*</td></tr><tr><td>(0.0354) [0.0300]</td><td>(0.0560) [0.0517]</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNotes: All specifications include fixed effects for: (i) year, (ii) firmid $\\times$ market, and (ii) state $\\times$ year.

Household's Optimization  \n\nOptimum Consumption Functions  \n\nREPRESENTATIVE HOUSEHOLD MAXIMIZES THE FOLLOWING utility function subject to the budget constraint:  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{max}_{C_{i n j},L_{i n j},H_{i n j}}C-\\frac{1}{\\bar{\\phi}_{L}^{\\frac{1}{\\phi_{L}}}}\\frac{L^{\\frac{\\phi_{L}+1}{\\phi_{L}}}}{\\phi_{L}+1}-\\frac{1}{\\bar{\\phi}_{H}^{\\frac{1}{\\phi_{H}}}}\\frac{H^{\\frac{\\phi_{H}+1}{\\phi_{H}}}}{\\phi_{H}+1},\\mathrm{s.t.}P C=L W_{L}+H W_{H}+\\Pi.\n$$  \n\nWe solve the problem in two steps. First, we derive the household's market-level demand function and then we derive the establishment-level demand function. The solution to household's market-level demand function is a solution to  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{max}_{Y_{j}}\\biggl(\\int_{j}J^{\\frac{-1}{\\theta}}Y_{j}^{\\frac{\\theta-1}{\\theta}}d j\\biggr)^{\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta-1}},\\quad\\mathrm{s.t.}\\quad\\int_{J}P_{j}Y_{j}d j\\leq Z.\n$$  \n\nThen the optimal allocation is given by  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta-1}\\bigg(\\int_{j}J^{\\frac{-1}{\\theta}}Y_{j}^{\\frac{\\theta-1}{\\theta}}d j\\bigg)^{\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta-1}-1}J^{\\frac{-1}{\\theta}}\\frac{\\theta-1}{\\theta}Y_{j}^{\\frac{\\theta-1}{\\theta}-1}=\\lambda P_{j}.\n$$  \n\nThis can be simplifed as $J^{\\frac{-1}{\\theta}}Y^{\\frac{1}{\\theta}}Y_{j}^{\\frac{-1}{\\theta}}=\\lambda P_{j}$ Next, multiply each sid by $Y_{j}$ and integrate across $J$ to get $\\textstyle Y=\\lambda\\int_{j}P_{j}Y_{j}d j$ . We define the market price index $P$ such that  \n\n$\\textstyle P Y=\\int_{j}P_{j}Y_{j}d j$ , which would imply that $\\lambda=P^{-1}$ . Then, plugging this into the first-order condition delivers the market-specific demand function:  \n\n$$\nY_{j}=\\left(\\frac{1}{J}\\right)\\left(\\frac{P_{j}}{P}\\right)^{-\\theta}Y.\n$$  \n\nThe aggregate price index can be recovered by multiplying both sides by $P_{j}$ and integrating across markets:  \n\n$$\nP=\\left[{\\frac{1}{J}}\\int_{J}P_{j}^{1-\\theta}d j\\right]^{\\frac{1}{1-\\theta}}.\n$$  \n\nWe can apply a similar formulation to derive the establishment-specific demand function, $\\begin{array}{r}{Y_{i n j}=\\frac{1}{I}(\\frac{P_{i n j}}{P_{j}})^{-\\eta}Y_{j}}\\end{array}$ , and the market price index, $\\begin{array}{r}{P_{j}=(\\frac{1}{I}\\sum_{i}P_{i n j}^{1-\\eta})^{\\frac{1}{1-\\eta}}}\\end{array}$ .Then, the establishment-specific demand function is given by  \n\n$$\nY_{i n j}=\\frac{1}{J}\\frac{1}{I}\\bigg(\\frac{P_{i n j}}{P_{j}}\\bigg)^{-\\eta}\\bigg(\\frac{P_{j}}{P}\\bigg)^{-\\theta}Y.\n$$  \n\nTo derive the market-specific inverse demand function, we can write $\\begin{array}{r}{P_{j}=J^{-\\frac{1}{\\theta}}\\big(\\frac{Y_{j}}{Y}\\big)^{-\\frac{1}{\\theta}}P_{\\perp}}\\end{array}$ and similarly at the establishment level as $\\begin{array}{r}{P_{i n j}=I^{-\\frac{1}{\\eta}}(\\frac{Y_{i n j}}{Y_{j}})^{-\\frac{1}{\\eta}}P_{j}}\\end{array}$ . Combining the last two equations, we can get the establishment-specific inverse demand curve as  \n\n$$\nP_{i n j}=\\left({\\frac{1}{J}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\theta}}\\left({\\frac{1}{I}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\eta}}Y_{i n j}^{-{\\frac{1}{\\eta}}}Y_{j}^{\\frac{1}{\\eta}-{\\frac{1}{\\theta}}}Y^{\\frac{1}{\\theta}}P.\n$$  \n\n## Optimum Labor Supply Functions  \n\nTo derive equation (6), we follow Berger, Herkenhoff, and Mongey (2022) and adjust for the love for variety by scaling the utility function. The household's aggregate labor supply function for each skill $S\\in\\{H,L\\}$ can be derived from  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{max}_{s}C-\\frac{1}{\\bar{\\phi}_{L}^{\\frac{1}{\\phi_{L}}}}\\frac{L^{\\frac{\\phi_{L}+1}{\\phi_{L}}}}{\\frac{\\phi_{L}+1}{\\phi_{L}}}-\\frac{1}{\\bar{\\phi}_{H}^{\\frac{1}{\\phi_{H}}}}\\frac{H^{\\frac{\\phi_{H}+1}{\\phi_{H}}}}{\\frac{\\phi_{H}+1}{\\phi_{H}}},\\mathrm{s.t.}P C=L W_{L}+H W_{H}+\\Pi.\n$$  \n\nThen, the first-order condition for $S\\in\\{H,L\\}$ is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{W_{S}}{P}=\\overline{{\\phi}}_{S}^{-\\frac{1}{\\phi_{S}}}S^{\\frac{1}{\\phi_{S}}}\\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad S=\\overline{{\\phi}}_{S}\\bigg(\\frac{W_{S}}{P}\\bigg)^{\\phi_{S}},\n$$  \n\nwhich gives the aggregate labor supply function. The household's optimum choice of allocation of labor across markets can be written as the solution to  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{min}_{S_{j}}\\biggl[\\int_{j}\\biggl(\\frac{1}{J}\\biggr)^{\\frac{-1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}}S_{j}^{\\frac{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}+1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}}d j\\biggr]^{\\frac{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}+1}},\\quad\\mathrm{s.t.}\\quad\\int_{J}W_{S j}S_{j}d j\\ge Z.\n$$  \n\nThen, the optimal allocation is given by  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}+1}\\bigg(\\int_{j}\\bigg(\\frac{1}{J}\\bigg)^{\\frac{-1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}}S_{j}^{\\frac{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}+1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}}d j\\bigg)^{\\frac{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}+1}-1}\\bigg(\\frac{1}{J}\\bigg)^{\\frac{-1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}}\\frac{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}+1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}S_{j}^{\\frac{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}+1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}-1}=\\lambda W_{S j}.\n$$  \n\nThis can be simplifed as ${\\frac{1}{J}}^{\\frac{-1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}}S^{\\frac{-1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}}S_{j}^{\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}}=\\lambda W_{S j}$ . Next, multiply each side by $S_{j}$ and integrate across $J$ to get $\\begin{array}{r}{S=\\lambda\\int_{j}W_{S j}S_{j}d j}\\end{array}$ . We define the aggregate wage index $W$ such that $\\textstyle W S=\\int_{j}W_{j}S_{j}d j$ , which would imply that $\\lambda=W^{-1}$ . Then, plugging this into the first-order condition delivers the market-specific labor supply equation as a function of wage levels and aggregate labor supply:  \n\n$$\n{\\cal S}_{j}=\\left(\\frac{1}{J}\\right)\\left(\\frac{W_{S j}}{W_{S}}\\right)^{\\widehat{\\theta}_{S}}{\\cal S}.\n$$  \n\nThe aggregate wage index can be recovered by multiplying both sides by $W_{j}$ and integrating across markets:  \n\n$$\nW_{S}=\\left[\\frac{1}{J}\\int_{J}W_{S j}^{1+\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}d j\\right]^{\\frac{1}{1+\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}}.\n$$  \n\nWe can apply a similar formulation to derive the establishment-level labor supply, $S_{i n j}=$ $(\\textstyle{\\frac{1}{I}})(\\textstyle{\\frac{W_{S i n j}}{W_{S j}}})^{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}S_{j}$ and the market-specific wage index is $\\begin{array}{r}{W_{S j}=[(\\frac{1}{I})\\sum_{i}W_{S i n j}^{1+\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}]^{\\frac{1}{1+\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}}}\\end{array}$ .Then, the establishment-level labor supply curve is given by  \n\n$$\nS_{i n j}=\\left(\\frac{1}{J}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{I}\\right)\\left(\\frac{W_{S i n j}}{W_{S j}}\\right)^{\\widehat{\\eta}_{S}}\\left(\\frac{W_{S j}}{W_{S}}\\right)^{\\widehat{\\theta}_{S}}S.\n$$  \n\nTo derive the market-specific inverse labor supply function, write $\\begin{array}{r}{W_{S j}=\\left(\\frac{1}{J}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}}(\\frac{S_{j}}{S})^{\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}}W_{S}}\\end{array}$ and similarly at the establishment level as $\\begin{array}{r}{W_{i n j}=\\big(\\frac{1}{I}\\big)^{-\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}}\\big(\\frac{S_{i n j}}{S_{j}}\\big)^{\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}}W_{S j}}\\end{array}$ Combining these two equations, we can get the establishment-level inverse labor supply curve as  \n\n$$\nW_{S i n j}=\\left(\\frac{1}{J}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}}\\left(\\frac{1}{I}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}}S_{i n j}^{\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}}S_{j}^{\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}-\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}}S^{-\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}}W_{S}.\n$$  \n\n### A.2. Solving the Equilibrium  \n\n### Optimal Firm Solution  \n\nThere are $N$ firms indexed by $n$ in each market. A firm owns $I/N$ establishments. An establishment's sales share and wage bill share are denoted by $s_{i n j}$ and $e_{L i n j}$ ， $e_{H i n j}$ , respectively. As a result, the firm's sales share and wage bill share can be expressed as $\\begin{array}{r}{s_{n j}=\\sum_{i\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{n j}}s_{i n j}}\\end{array}$ and $\\begin{array}{r}{e_{L n j}=\\sum_{i\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{n j}}e_{L i n j}}\\end{array}$ for the low-skilled and $\\begin{array}{r}{e_{H n j}=\\sum_{i\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{n j}}e_{H i n j}}\\end{array}$ for the high-skilled, respectively. Firm's problem here is to choose an employment level $L_{i n j}$ ， $H_{i n j}$ for each establishment $i$ simultaneously to maximize its profit.

$Z_{S}=W_{S}^{-1}S^{1/\\widehat\\theta_{S}}Y^{1/\\theta}$ is the skill-specific aggregate and the aggregate price $P$ is normalized to 1. Finally, we replace $Y_{i n j}$ in the above expression by the production function, which gives us two first-order conditions that are functions of $H_{i n j}$ and $L_{i n j}$ . We use these two equations to solve the model computationally using the following algorithm.  \n\n### A.3. Algorithm to Solve the Model  \n\nGiven model primitives outlined in Table I, we proceed to compute the equilibrium of our economy using the following algorithm:  \n\n1. Guess three aggregates: $\\{\\bar{W}_{H}^{k},\\bar{W}_{L}^{k},Y^{k}\\}$ where $k$ is the index of iteration. 2. Given those three initial values, solve the $2\\times I$ first-order conditions, market-bymarket, and calculate $H_{i n j},L_{i n j}$ , and $Y_{i n j}$ for each establishment. 3. Compute $W_{H,i n j}$ ， $W_{L,i n j}$ , and $P_{i n j}$ for each establishment using the inverse labor supply function for each skill and inverse demand function. Then, aggregate the establishment wages $W_{H i n j}$ $W_{L i n j}$ into $W_{H}^{k+1}$ ， $W_{L}^{k+1}$ and establishment output $Y_{i n j}$ 10 $Y^{k+1}$ using the respective CES aggregators. 4號 $W_{H}^{k+1}=W_{H}^{k}$ ， $\\Bar W_{L}^{k+1}=W_{L}^{k}$ $\\bar{Y^{k+1}}=Y^{k}$ $W_{H}^{*}$ $W_{L}^{*}$ $Y^{*}$  \n\n### A.4. Algorithm to Back out Technology Shocks  \n\nIn order to back out the $A_{H i n j}$ and $A_{L i n j}$ from the microdata, we proceed as follows:  \n\n1. Given that we can express the two first-order conditions for each establishment only as a function of $A_{S i n j},S_{i n j},\\forall i\\in j$ in equation (A21) of Section (A.2), we begin by solving for $Z_{S}=W_{S}^{-1}S^{1/\\widehat\\theta_{S}}Y^{1/\\theta}$ . We first use the aggregate labor supply function to substitute out $W_{S}$ as a function of $S$ using $\\begin{array}{r}{W_{S}=\\frac{S^{1/\\varphi}}{\\overline{{\\varphi}}_{S}}}\\end{array}$ 1.  \n\n2. Given our estimation of the labor supply function from Steps 1 and 2 in Section 4, we have estimates of $\\hat{\\eta}_{S},\\hat{\\theta}_{S},\\overline{{\\varphi}}_{S}$ Now $Z_{S}=S^{1/\\widehat\\theta-1/\\varphi}Y^{1/\\theta}\\overline{{\\varphi}}_{S}$ where we only need to solve for $Y$ . To do so, we use a two-step procedure.  \n\n(a) Step 1: We guess $Y={\\widetilde{Y}}$ and solve for the $A_{S i n j}$ ， $\\forall i$ . At this stage, we identify the $\\mu_{i n j}^{*}$ ， ${\\delta}_{S i n j}^{*}$ $W_{S i n j}^{*}$ and $S_{i n j}^{*}$ where \\* denotes the equilibrium value of these quantities. $S_{i n j}^{*}$ is establishmentlevel skilsecifmloymentwhchweu fromthe data, $\\dot{W}_{S i n j}^{*}$ are model wages from the labor supply function, and $\\mu_{i n j}^{*}$ ， ${\\delta}_{S i n j}^{*}$ are independent of aggregate $Y$ as they only depend on the relative $A_{S i n j}$ within a market.  \n\n(b) Step 2: In Step 1, we identify $\\begin{array}{r}{Y^{*}=\\int_{j}\\sum_{i}P_{i n j}Y_{i n j}d j}\\end{array}$ , as the establishment-level revenues are independent of the guess $\\widetilde{Y}$ . Therefore, we can solve the model a second time using $Y^{*}$ to retrieve the estimated $A_{S i n j}^{*}$ distribution.2  \n\n### A.5. Proofs  \n\nProof of Proposition 1  \n\nIn homogeneous establishment case, the skill premium is given by  \n\n$$\n\\kappa=\\Bigg[\\Bigg(\\frac{A_{H}}{A_{L}}\\Bigg)^{\\frac{\\sigma-1}{\\sigma+\\phi}}\\times\\Bigg(\\frac{\\bar{\\phi}_{L}}{\\bar{\\phi}_{H}}\\Bigg)^{\\frac{1}{\\sigma+\\phi}}\\Bigg]\\times\\left[\\frac{1+\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{L}}\\frac{1}{N}+\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{L}}\\Bigg(1-\\frac{1}{N}\\Bigg)}{1+\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{H}}\\frac{1}{N}+\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{H}}\\Bigg(1-\\frac{1}{N}\\Bigg)}\\right]^{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma+\\phi}}.\n$$  \n\nThen the skill premium elasticityis dereasing, that s $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{\\partial\\kappa}{\\partial N}/\\big(\\frac{\\kappa}{N}\\big)<0}\\end{array}$ iff $\\begin{array}{r}{(1+\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{L}})\\bigl(\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{H}}-\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{H}}\\bigr)<}\\end{array}$ $\\begin{array}{r}{(1+\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{H}})(\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{L}}-\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{L}}).}\\end{array}$  \n\nPROoF: From first-order conditions, we know:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\kappa\\equiv\\kappa_{i j}}\\ {=\\frac{A_{H,i j}^{\\frac{\\sigma-1}{\\sigma}}H_{i j}^{-\\frac{1}{\\sigma}}\\delta_{L,i j}}{A_{L,i j}^{\\frac{\\sigma-1}{\\sigma}}L_{i j}^{-\\frac{1}{\\sigma}}\\delta_{H,i j}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{=\\left(\\frac{A_{H}}{A_{L}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\sigma-1}{\\sigma}}\\cdot\\left[\\cfrac{1+\\cfrac{1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{L}}e_{L,n j}+\\cfrac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{L}}(1-e_{L,n j})}{1+\\cfrac{1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{H}}e_{H,n j}+\\cfrac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{H}}(1-e_{H,n j})}\\right]\\cdot\\left(\\frac{H}{L}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{\\sigma}}}\\ &{=\\left(\\frac{A_{H}}{A_{L}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\sigma-1}{\\sigma}}\\cdot\\left[\\cfrac{1+\\cfrac{1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{L}}e_{L,n j}+\\cfrac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{L}}(1-e_{L,n j})}{1+\\cfrac{1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{H}}e_{H,n j}+\\cfrac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{H}}(1-e_{H,n j})}\\right]\\cdot\\left(\\cfrac{\\bar{\\phi}_{L}}{\\bar{\\phi}_{H}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\sigma}}\\cdot\\left(\\frac{W_{L}}{W_{H}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\phi}{\\sigma}}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nBy rearranging, we get the aforementioned expression.3 Now we have following properties:  \n\n1.

We first outline the broad overview of our data cleaning and construction. We discuss some of the quality and coverage issues we face with our data and provide some insight into the different decisions we made in constructing our data for the analysis. Then we discuss the mapping of our model to the data.  \n\nLongitudinal Business Database.  The data we use to estimate our model combine establishment-level data from the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) with characteristics of the workers at these establishments from Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) data. The frame of the LBD comes from the Census Business Register, which is populated from the quinquennial economic census and from administrative sources. LBD is an establishment-level data set containing information on payroll, employment, revenue, ownership structure, geography (MSA), and industry classification (NAICS). We consider the LBD to be the frame of our sample, and augment this frame with information on worker composition.  \n\nLongitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics.The Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) data provide information on workers and firms in each state at quarterly frequency from unemployment insurance records. These data allow us to observe about $96\\%$ of workers and the identities of their employers (via tax identifiers) for a sample of 20 states, going back to 1997.4 The LEHD infrastructure files include demographic information on workers from decennial censuses and the American Community Survey as well as administrative records, including age, sex, race and ethnicity, and education. We use the LEHD to construct measures of the education composition of each firm in our data.  \n\n## B.1. Education  \n\nSkill Definition. For our exercise, we use the LEHD to derive measures of the composition of skill types and wages within each firm. We label individuals with some college education or greater as “high-skilled” and we label individuals with a high school diploma or less as “low-skilled\" workers. The concept of a firm in LEHD is the State Employer Identification Number (SEIN) under which a firm typically reports its employment and payroll for all of its employees at all establishments within the state.  \n\nEarnings.  Since we observe only earnings rather than wages in our data and only at quarterly frequency, we limit our measurement of earnings and employment to fullquarter observations where for time $t$ , we require the worker is also employed at the firm in quarters $t-1$ and $t+1$ so we know the job existed for the duration of the entire quarter. To further limit marginal employment and outlier observations, we drop any earnings from workers at the firm below an earnings threshold equivalent to 130 hours worked (averaging 10 hours/week) at the federal minimum wage for that quarter. We also truncate worker earnings at the 99th percentile and restrict our earnings observations to prime age workers, between the ages of 25 and 65.  \n\nWe aggregate these employment and earnings observations at the firm level by high(and low-)skilled workers? share of employment, that is, their skill ratio. Similarly, we measure the high- (and low-)skilled workers’ ratio of payroll per worker (skill premium) for each SEIN. Using the linkage of workers to employers in LEHD, we split the establishment-level payroll and employment in LBD by using the firm-level ratio of high- to low-skilled workers and payrolls we observed in LEHD. This provides us with our high- and low-skilled employment, $H_{i n j},L_{i n j}$ , and wages (payroll per worker) $W_{H i n j}$ $W_{L i n j}$  \n\nDefinethe sil ratiof the im in LEHD as $\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathrm{SR}_{\\mathrm{LEHD}}=\\frac{H_{\\mathrm{LEHD}}}{H_{\\mathrm{LEHD}}+L_{\\mathrm{LEHD}}}}\\end{array}$ where $H_{\\mathrm{LEHD}}$ and $L_{\\mathrm{LEHD}}$ are full-quarter employment by skill type in LEHD. Then, skill-specific employment in LBD is $H_{i n j}=\\mathrm{SR}_{\\mathrm{LEHD}}\\mathrm{Emp}_{\\mathrm{LBD}}$ and $L_{i n j}=\\left(1-\\mathrm{SR}_{\\mathrm{LEHD}}\\right)\\mathrm{Emp}_{\\mathrm{LBD}}.$ Similarly, define skill premium as $\\mathrm{SP}_{\\mathrm{LEHD}}=W_{H,\\mathrm{LEHD}}/W_{L,\\mathrm{LEHD}}$ , where $W_{S,\\mathrm{LEHD}}$ is payroll per worker by skill type for full-quarter employment in each firm in LEHD. Using the definition of payroll as $\\mathrm{Payroll}_{\\mathrm{LBD}}=W_{H i n j}H_{i n j}+W_{L i n j}L_{i n j}$ and the skill premium, the formula for the wage (payroll per worker) in our sample is  \n\n$$\nW_{H i n j}=\\frac{\\mathrm{Payroll_{LBD}^{\\mathrm{\\tiny~LBD}}}}{H_{i n j}+\\frac{L_{i n j}}{\\mathrm{SP_{LEHD}}}},\\qquadW_{L i n j}=\\frac{\\mathrm{Payroll_{LBD}}}{L_{i n j}+(\\mathrm{SP_{LEHD}}H_{i n j})}.\n$$  \n\nGiven our formula for $H_{i n j}$ and $L_{i n j}$ , we can write $W_{S i n j}$ in terms of our skill ratio, skill premium, employment, and payroll as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{W_{H i n j}=\\frac{\\mathrm{Payroll}_{\\mathrm{LBD}}}{\\mathrm{SR}_{\\mathrm{LEHD}}\\mathrm{Emp}_{\\mathrm{LBD}}+(1-\\mathrm{SR}_{\\mathrm{LEHD}})\\mathrm{Emp}_{\\mathrm{LBD}}/\\mathrm{SP}_{\\mathrm{LEHD}}},}\\ &{W_{L i n j}=\\frac{\\mathrm{Payroll}_{\\mathrm{LBD}}}{(1-\\mathrm{SR}_{\\mathrm{LEHD}})\\mathrm{Emp}_{\\mathrm{LBD}}+(\\mathrm{SP}_{\\mathrm{LEHD}}\\mathrm{SR}_{\\mathrm{LEHD}}\\mathrm{Emp}_{\\mathrm{LBD}})}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nCoverage.  While coverage of demographic information such as age and race is high in LEHD, the coverage of educational attainment data is lower than that of other individual characteristics. Education is available for workers in LEHD who were at least 25 years of age when surveyed in the 2o00 decennial long form survey or the American Community Survey (ACS), and covers $27.6\\%$ of workers in our sample in 1997 and $16.9\\%$ in 2016. Because of the higher coverage of the 2000 decennial long form survey relative to ACS, education is observed for more workers in our sample in 1997 than in 2016. For workers without observed education, this value is imputed. The education imputation in LEHD is stationary, however, and poorly matches the time trends in educational attainment and skill premium observed in other data sets such as ACS and CPS. We would like to limit our use of education in LEHD to observed cases; however, this causes another issue of biasing our sample to only larger firms. To balance the representativeness of our establishment sample and also retain the trends in college attainment and skill premium in our sample, we use only observed data for any firm with at least one linked high-skilled and low-skilled worker with full-quarter earnings. For firms where we cannot observe at least one highskilled and one low-skilled worker using observed education values, we use the imputed education values of the firm's full-quarter workers to get payroll and employment by skill level for the employer.  \n\nWe merge the LBD to the LEHD by firm identifier, which provides each establishment within that firm with the same measure of skill ratio and payroll ratio from LEHD. For each establishment within the firm in a state, we split the LBD employment and payroll for that establishment by the skill ratio and payroll ratios we measured for the linked employer in LEHD. This approach preserves the establishment employment and payroll distribution within LBD. We show that our resulting measures using full-quarter earnings and employment, restricting our use of imputed education information, and applying the measures of skill ratio and payroll ratio to the LBD establishments gives us a sample which accurately reflects establishment counts and size as well as the trends in educational attainment and relative wages by skill.5  \n\nMatching Trends and the Size Distribution. Table AI shows the summary statistics of our baseline sample in comparison to our same sample construction if we used only observed worker information without any imputations, and our sample if we used all worker information including the observed and imputed worker education for all observations. We can see that using some imputed information maintains the coverage of our sample and the average establishment size, while restricting our use of imputed workers in large firms helps to preserve the skill composition and skill premium trends of the observed sample.  \n\nTABLEAI SAMPLE SUMMARY STATISTICS BY EDUCATION IMPUTE USAGE.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">Hybrid</td><td colspan=\"2\">Observed</td><td colspan=\"2\">AllWorkers</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1997</td><td>2016</td><td>1997</td><td>2016</td><td>1997</td><td>2016</td></tr><tr><td>TotalEmployment</td><td>52.2</td><td>70.6</td><td>70.3</td><td>90.3</td><td>52.5</td><td>70.9</td></tr><tr><td>SkillRatio</td><td>0.493</td><td>0.609</td><td>0.492</td><td>0.618</td><td>0.509</td><td>0.560</td></tr><tr><td>SkillPremium</td><td>1.52</td><td>1.73</td><td>1.52</td><td>1.77</td><td>1.45</td><td>1.46</td></tr><tr><td>WH</td><td>$46,960</td><td>$67,100</td><td>$47,960</td><td>$69,340</td><td>$45,880</td><td>$64,970</td></tr><tr><td>WL</td><td>$30,980</td><td>$38,690</td><td>$31,590</td><td>$39,290</td><td>$31,630</td><td>$44,560</td></tr><tr><td>EstablishmentCount</td><td>72,000</td><td>27,000</td><td>47,000</td><td>17,000</td><td>72,500</td><td>27,000</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNote: Hybrid refers to our sample methodology where imputed workers are only used in the absence of at least one observed high- and low-skilled worker. The skill ratio is the establishment-level mean of the share of employment with high skill (some college education or more), weighted by employment. Total Employment refers to the average establishment size in the sample. $\\mathcal{W}_{H}$ and $\\mathcal{W}_{L}$ denote the employment-weighted mean of establishment payroll per worker for high- and low-skilled workers, respectively. Note that the skill premium is slightly different from the data values in Table VI as the samples in this table are constructed in the same manner as our estimation of labor supply elasticities, however it includes establishments with missing revenue information.  \n\n## B.2. Revenues  \n\nAllocating Firm Revenue to the Establishments. As outlined in Section 4, the last step in our estimation procedure requires us to estimate the market structure. To do so, we need aggregate moments of the distribution of establishment-level revenue and payroll. Of course, our measure of sales which we can link to LBD is a firm-level measure derived from administrative tax data. To get at an establishment distribution, we follow Tanaka, Warren, and Wiczer (2023) and impute the revenue to the establishment by using the establishment's share of payroll within its firm. While imputing revenue to the establishment based on payroll shares is imperfect relative to a direct establishment-level measurement, we only use an aggregate moment for our market structure estimation.  \n\nValidation Using CMF.  It is impossible to get the exact establishment-level distribution of revenues for all sectors in our data set, but it is possible to assess our imputation method by making a comparison between our payroll-share imputed revenue and a direct measure of establishment sales for the manufacturing sector in Economic Census years. We take the Census of Manufactures for the years 1997 and 2017 and apply similar restrictions to the payroll and revenue variables for establishments in our sample (non-missing and strictly positive payroll and revenue, and truncation of revenue at the 99th percentile). To check the quality of our impute, we focus on the sample of establishments within multiestablishment firms, as these are the units which we impute based on our payroll share. Figure A1 shows that the establishment-level payroll and revenue share distribution is nearly identical.6  \n\nWe can further assess the revenue impute by comparing the difference between the directly measured establishment-level revenue to our payroll-imputed revenue measure. In Figure A2, we plot the distribution of the difference in logged imputed revenue minus the observed log of establishment revenue. The distribution of errors is symmetric and centered at O. Looking at the revenue-weighted difference relative to the unweighted difference, the weighted distribution has a thicker left tail, suggesting that the imputed revenue is lower than the observed revenue especially for high-revenue establishments.  \n\n![](images/60bca6305a2f5ff68a8049d98a842a35e76dad37a73c3391aa7c9e96f0b06049.jpg)  \nFIGURE A1.—Payroll shares and revenue shares of establishments in multi-unit firms. Notes: Kernel density plot of establishment payroll share and revenue share for establishments in multi-unit firms in CMF. Variables are truncated at the 5th and 95th percentiles before plotting kernel densities.  \n\nFigure A3 displays the unweighted distribution of revenue over payroll using imputed revenue and observed revenue at the establishment level. When we look at our moment of interest, the sales-weighted distribution of revenue over payroll in Figure A4, we see that the distribution of observed revenue over payroll has a fatter tail than the imputed measure.7 However, this error does not seem to affect the trends in our measure over time. The change in the sales-weighted establishment-level mean of revenue over payroll from 1997 to 2017 is nearly identical when using our imputed measure or the direct establishment measure, as can be seen in the last row of Table AII.  \n\n![](images/820540e7f1663d99b1ba1d3f11ea00371297e69afe481847955ee1ae40d00a89.jpg)  \nFIGURE A2.—Log difference of imputed revenue—observed revenue.

Our approach is to stochastically define markets and use the structure of our model to estimate the scope of our markets. Practically, we start by defining a broad set of potential competitors as a NAICS 6 industry.8 In order to define a market within each NAICS 6 industry, we first randomly assign establishments to markets of size $I$ . Once we select those $I$ establishments that form a market, thereafter we randomly establish the identity of the firms that compete, and how many firms $N$ are active within a market by randomly assigning these $I$ establishments into $N$ subsets of size $I/N$ . We drop the remainder of establishments in each industry that cannot be assigned to a full market of $I$ establishments. In our exercise, we choose $I$ to be 32.  \n\nOur baseline estimation uses NAICS 6 industry as the basis for our random market assignment to best match the features of the product market. Since our tax variation is at the state level, markets within a state will not have any variation in tax rates, which makes it difficult for us to condition on geography. Therefore, we use Tradeables and narrowly defined national industries (NAICS 6) as our baseline.9 We could alternatively choose to match on characteristics of the labor market; however, we lack information such as occupation to satisfactorily define labor markets. Since our model assumes identical product and labor markets, our choice to match on product market characteristics implies that our labor markets are also national. In Appendix D, we perform robustness exercises where we eliminate random assignment of establishments to markets and where we segment our industries by geography (MSA) so that we are likely to be closer to the relevant boundary of the market for labor at the expense of the product market.  \n\nOwnership Assignment. Note that we do not use the ownership structure of firms and establishments from the data in our exercise. This discards some useful information about changes in the distribution of establishments and firms. Firm growth, especially at the tail, was documented by Cao, Hyatt, Mukoyama, and Sager (2022) to be largely driven by increases in the number of establishments a firm operates. However, we remain agnostic about the process of establishment birth, death, and consolidation. The primary reasons for our use of a stochastic ownership structure is that this allows a level of symmetry which is useful in our counterfactual analysis.  \n\n## B.4. Summary of Data Cleaning  \n\nWe have two samples which we use in our estimation process. For our backing out of technology and estimation of the market structure, we use cross-sections of establishments for the years 1997 and 2016. For this sample, we assign establishments to markets (and firms) stochastically as described above. We also require revenue information so we restrict the sample to establishments with non-missing revenue and truncate revenue at the 99th percentile.  \n\nFor our estimation of labor supply elasticities, we use a panel of establishments from 1997 to 2011 as we have state-level corporate tax rates through 2011 from Giroud and Rauh (2019). In order to stochastically assign establishments to markets and retain a panel structure, we first randomly assign establishments to markets, conditional on NAICS 6, in 1997 such that there are at most 32 establishments in each market. Once assigned to a market, the establishment always remains in that market as long as we observe it in the data. For every subsequent year starting from 1997, we again randomly assign the establishment unobserved previously (i.e., the new entrants) to one of the existing markets created in 1997. As a result, the size and the composition of the markets evolve randomly over time given the entry and exit of establishments from markets. Our baseline elasticity estimates are based on this sample. Since we want to estimate labor supply elasticities using the entire wage and earnings distribution, we do not restrict the sample based on revenue as we do when estimating market structure.  \n\nOur final data cleaning steps are common to both samples. Our sample is the subset of our LBD sample of establishments where the firm links to at least one SEIN in our 20-state LEHD sample. We drop firms in LBD where they account for less than 5 percent of the employment when measured at the linked firm in LEHD to drop some outlier firms in our linkage. We drop establishments with missing county. We keep only establishments of C-corporation firms for our tax instrument in the elasticity estimation. We use establishments in tradeable sectors (11, 21, 31, 32, 33, and 55) as defined in Delgado, Bryden, and Zyontz (2014). We drop establishments with five or fewer total employees, and for which we do not have at least one high- and one low-skilled employee and positive payroll for each skill type. We winsorize establishment employment and average high- and low-skilled payroll per worker, $W_{H i n j}$ $W_{L i n j}$ , at the 1st and 99th percentile.  \n\n# APPENDIX C: IDENTIFICATION  \n\n## C.1. Derivation of Equation (21)  \n\nTo derive equation (21) in the main text, we proceed as follows. We start from the labor supply equation (rewritten below for convenience):  \n\n$$\n\\ln W_{S i n j t}^{*}=k_{j t}+\\left(\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}-\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}\\right)\\ln S_{j t}+\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}\\ln S_{i n j t}+\\varepsilon_{S i n j t},\n$$  \n\nwhere l $\\mathrm{n}W_{S i n j t}^{*}=\\ln W_{S i n j t}+\\varepsilon_{S i n j t}$ and $k_{j t}=\\ln J_{t}^{\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}}I_{j t}^{\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}}S_{t}^{-\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}}W_{t}$  \n\nWe construct sector-time average of the labor supply function to remove the sectortime fixed terms from the labor supply equation:  \n\n$$\n\\overline{{\\ln W}}_{S j t}^{*}=k_{j t}+\\left(\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}-\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}\\right)\\ln S_{j t}+\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}\\overline{{\\ln S}}_{j t}+\\overline{{\\varepsilon}}_{S j t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\begin{array}{r}{\\overline{{\\ln W}}_{s j t}^{*}=\\frac{1}{I_{j}}\\sum_{i\\in j}\\ln W_{S i n j t}^{*},\\overline{{\\ln S}}_{j t}=\\frac{1}{I_{j}}\\sum_{i\\in j}\\ln S_{i n j t}}\\end{array}$ and $\\begin{array}{r}{\\overline{{\\varepsilon}}_{S j t}=\\frac{1}{I_{j}}\\sum_{i\\in j}\\varepsilon_{i n j t}}\\end{array}$  \n\nGetting rid of sector-time components from the labor supply equation, we get  \n\n$$\n\\ln W_{S i n j t}^{*}-\\overline{{\\ln W}}_{S j t}^{*}=\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}(\\ln S_{i n j t}-\\overline{{\\ln S}}_{j t})+(\\varepsilon_{S i n j t}-\\overline{{\\varepsilon}}_{S j t}).\n$$  \n\nFinally, we rely on the following moment conditions implied by Assumption 3 to get our equation of interest for $\\hat{\\eta}_{S}$  \n\n$$\n0=\\mathbb{E}\\big[\\big(\\varepsilon_{S i n j t}-\\bar{\\varepsilon}_{S j t}\\big)\\times\\tau_{X(i)t}\\big]\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{\\displaystyle=\\mathbb{E}\\bigg[\\bigg\\{\\big(\\ln W_{S i n j t}^{*}-\\overline{{\\ln W}}_{S j

{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}=\\frac{\\mathbb{E}\\big(\\widetilde{S}_{i n j t}\\times\\tau_{X(i)t}\\big)}{\\mathbb{E}\\big(\\widetilde{W}^{*}_{S i n j t}\\times\\tau_{X(i)t}\\big)},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\widetilde{S}_{i n j t}=\\ln S_{i n j t}-\\overline{{\\ln S}}_{j t}$ and $\\widetilde{W}^{*}{}_{S i n j t}=\\ln W_{S i n j t}^{*}-\\overline{{\\ln W}}_{S j t}^{*}$  \n\nIn order to derive the expression for $\\hat{\\theta}_{S}$ in equation (21), we proceed as follows Equipped with the estimate of $\\hat{\\eta}_{S}$ , we rewrite the labor supply function as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\ln W_{S i n j t}^{*}-\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}\\ln S_{i n j t}\\equiv\\Omega_{S i n j t}=k_{j t}+\\left(\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}-\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}\\right)\\ln S_{j t}+\\varepsilon_{S i n j t}.\n$$  \n\nTaking sector-time average on both sides, we get  \n\n$$\n\\overline{{\\Omega}}_{S j t}=k_{j}+k_{t}+\\left(\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}-\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}\\right)\\ln{S_{j t}}+\\nu_{j t}+\\overline{{\\varepsilon}}_{S j t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $k_{j t}=k_{j}+k_{t}+\\nu_{j t}$ and $\\begin{array}{r}{\\overline{{\\Omega}}_{S j t}=\\frac{1}{I_{j}}\\sum_{i\\in j}\\Omega_{S i n j t}}\\end{array}$  \n\nUsing the following moment implied by Assumption 3, we can calculate our expression of interest for $\\hat{\\theta}_{S}$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\tilde{\\tau}_{i\\wedge j}=\\mathbb{E}\\bigg[\\bigg(\\overline{{\\mathbf{U}}}_{s j t}-k_{j t}-\\Big(\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{s}}-\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{s}}\\Big)\\ln S_{i j}\\bigg)\\times\\tilde{\\tau}_{j t}\\bigg]=0,}\\ &{\\tilde{\\tau}_{i\\wedge j}=\\mathbb{E}\\bigg[\\bigg(\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{s}}-\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{s}}\\bigg)\\ln S_{i j}\\times\\tilde{\\tau}_{j t}\\bigg],}\\ &{\\hat{\\theta}_{s}=\\bigg[\\frac{\\mathbb{E}\\big(\\{\\overline{{\\Omega}}_{s j t}-k_{j t}\\}\\times\\tilde{\\tau}_{j t}\\big)}{\\mathbb{E}(\\ln S_{i j}\\times\\tilde{\\tau}_{j t})}+\\frac{\\mathbb{E}\\big(\\big(\\big(\\overline{{\\hat{W}}}^{*}\\mathbf{s}_{i\\wedge j}\\times\\tau_{x(i)t}\\big)\\big)}{\\mathbb{E}\\big(\\tilde{\\Omega}_{i j}\\times\\tau_{x(i)}\\wedge\\tau_{j

j}\\times\\tau_{x(i)}\\wedge\\tau_{j t})}\\bigg]^{-1},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\begin{array}{r}{\\bar{\\tau}_{j t}=\\frac{1}{I_{j}}\\sum_{i\\in j}{\\tau_{X(i)t}}}\\end{array}$ To go from line 3 to line 4, we rely on the fact that $k_{j t}=k_{j}+$ $k_{t}+\\nu_{j t}$ . Finally, to go from line 4 to line 5, we rely on Assumption 3 outlined in the main text which implies $\\mathbb{E}(\\nu_{j t}\\times\\bar{\\tau}_{j t})=0$  \n\n## C.2. Identification Without Endogeneity  \n\nIn this section, we show that, under the assumption that the error term is uncorrelated with employment, we can identify $\\hat{\\eta}_{S}$ and $\\hat{\\theta}_{S}$ using the following moments:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\widehat{\\eta}_{S}=\\bigg(\\frac{\\mathbb{C}o v\\big(\\widetilde{S}_{i n j},\\widetilde{W}^{*}{S}_{i n j}\\big)}{\\mathbb{V}a r(\\widetilde{S}_{i n j})}\\bigg)^{-1},}\\ &{\\widehat{\\theta}_{S}=\\bigg[\\bigg(\\frac{\\mathbb{C}o v(\\ln S_{j},\\overline{{\\Omega}}_{S j})}{\\mathbb{V}a r(\\ln S_{j})}\\bigg)+\\bigg(\\frac{\\mathbb{C}o v\\big(\\widetilde{S}_{i n j},\\widetilde{W}^{*}{S}_{i n j}\\big)}{\\mathbb{V}a r(\\widetilde{S}_{i n j})}\\bigg)\\bigg]^{-1},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere we denote  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\widetilde{S}_{i n j}=\\ln S_{i n j}-\\overline{{\\ln S_{j}}},\\qquad\\widetilde{W}^{*}{_{S i n j}}=\\ln W_{S i n j}^{*}-\\overline{{\\ln W_{S j}^{*}}},\\qquad\\overline{{\\ln X_{j}}}=\\frac{1}{I}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in j}\\ln X_{i n j},}\\ &{\\Omega_{S i n j}=\\ln W_{S i n j}^{*}-\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}\\ln S_{i n j},\\qquad\\overline{{\\Omega}}_{S j}=\\frac{1}{I}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in j}\\Omega_{S i n j}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe moment condition in equation (A23) is equivalent to regressing the difference of log employment from the mean of market-level log employment on difference of log wages from the mean of market log wages. The moment condition in equation (A24) is equivalent to regressing the market-level employment CES index on average marketlevel wages (after removing the effect of average sectoral employment). Given that the sectoral CES index is a function of $\\hat{\\eta}_{S}$ , we need to construct moments in equation (A23) and equation (A24) sequentially, starting with first retrieving the estimate of $\\hat{\\eta}_{S}$  \n\nDeriving the Moment Conditions.  To derive the moment conditions in equation (A23) and equation (A24), start by differencing out the market-specific mean wages and mean employment from equation (20) to get the following expression:  \n\n$$\n\\ln W_{S i n j}^{*}-\\overline{{\\ln W_{S j}^{*}}}=\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}(\\ln S_{i n j}-\\overline{{\\ln S_{j}}})+(\\varepsilon_{S i n j}-\\overline{{\\varepsilon}}_{S j}).\n$$  \n\nAn OLS regression of equation (A25) helps us retrieve $\\hat{\\eta}_{S}$ and equation (A23) specifies the moments that help us pin it down. Equipped with the estimate of $\\hat{\\eta}_{S}$ , we can construct $S_{j}$ , the CES index of market-level employment. In the second step, we can then estimate the between-market substitution parameter $\\hat{\\theta}_{S}$ by relying on equation (20) and subtracting In Sin from In Wstni  \n\n$$\n\\ln W_{S i n j}^{*}-\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}\\ln S_{i n j}\\equiv\\Omega_{S i n j}=k+\\left(\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}-\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}\\right)\\ln S_{j}+\\varepsilon_{S i n j},\n$$  \n\nwhere $k=\\ln J^{\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}}I^{\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}}S^{-\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}}W$  \n\nTo construct the moment in equation (A24), take market-specific averages of both sides on equation (A26) and regress $\\ln S_{j}$ On $\\overline{{\\Omega}}_{S j}$ to retrieve the estimate of $\\theta$  \n\n$$\n\\overline{{\\Omega}}_{S j}=k+\\left(\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}-\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}\\right)\\ln{S_{j}}+\\overline{{\\varepsilon}}_{S j}.\n$$  \n\n### C.2.1. Monte Carlo Simulation  \n\nTo see if our proposed estimator is able to recover the true structural parameters, we perform the following Monte Carlo simulation. First, we simulate the labor supply equation as follows:10  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\ln W_{s i n j}^{*}=k+\\underbrace{\\left(\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\theta}_{S}}-\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}\\right)}_{\\gamma_{S}}\\ln S_{j}^{*}+\\underbrace{\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}\\ln S_{i n j}^{*}}_{\\beta_{S}}+\\underbrace{\\epsilon_{i n j}^{W}+\\epsilon_{i n j}^{S}}_{\\epsilon_{i n j}},}\\ &{\\ln W_{s i n j}^{*}=\\ln W_{s i n j}+\\epsilon_{i n j}^{W},}\\ &{\\ln W_{s i n j}=k+\\gamma_{S}\\ln S_{j}+\\beta_{S}\\ln S_{i n j},}\\ &{\\ln S_{i n j}\\sim\\mathbb{N}(0,1),}\\ &{\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\hat{\\pi}_{\\hat{s}\\to1}\\quad,\\quad\\hat{\\eta}_{S}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$$\nS_{j}=\\left(\\sum_{i}I^{\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}}S_{i n j}^{\\frac{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}+1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}+1}},\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\ln S_{i n j}^{*}=\\ln S_{i n j}+\\rho\\times\\epsilon_{i n j}^{S},\\qquadS_{j}^{*}=\\left(\\displaystyle\\sum_{i}I^{\\frac{1}{\\bar{\\eta}_{S}}}\\left(S_{i n j}^{*}\\right)^{\\frac{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}+1}{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}}{\\hat{\\eta}_{S}+1}},}\\ &{\\quad\\quad\\epsilon_{i n j}^{S}\\sim\\mathbb{N}(0,1),\\qquad\\epsilon_{i n j}^{W}\\sim\\mathbb{N}(0,1),}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\epsilon_{i n j}^{W}$ denotes the measurement eror in wages and $\\epsilon_{i n j}^{S}$ denotes the measurement error in employment if $\\rho\\neq0$ . We assume that $\\epsilon_{i n j}^{W}$ and $\\epsilon_{i n j}^{S}$ are independent. Finally, we also assume that $\\ln S_{i n j}$ is independent of $\\epsilon_{\\underline{{i}}\\underline{{n}}\\underline{{j}}}^{W}$  \n\nGiven this data generating process, we first verify that the estimator is able to recover the true structural parameters if $\\rho=0$ . This implies that there is a zero correlation between $\\epsilon_{i n j}$ and $\\ln S_{i n j}$ . The results of this exercise are provided in Table AIll. We find that, under this assumption, OLS can retrieve the true structural parameters $\\hat{\\eta}_{S}$ and $\\hat{\\theta}_{S}$ using cross-sectional data on employment and wages as outlined in equation (A25) and equation (A27).  \n\nTABLE AIII MONTE CARLO SIMULATION.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>ns</td><td>Os</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>TrueValue</td><td></td><td>3.00 1.50</td><td>10.00</td></tr><tr><td>p=0</td><td>Mean</td><td>3.00</td><td>10.00</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Std.Dev</td><td>0.07 0.07</td><td>0.11</td></tr><tr><td>p=0.5</td><td>Mean</td><td>3.75</td><td>16.80</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Std.Dev</td><td>0.10</td><td>0.70</td></tr><tr><td>p =1.5</td><td>Mean</td><td>9.78</td><td>968.56</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Std.Dev</td><td>0.44</td><td>205.37</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: In simulation, we assumed that $J=500$ and $I=32$ and ran 1000 trials for each value of $\\rho$  \n\nIn order to understand the role of endogeneity bias, we perform additional simulations where we assume that $\\rho\\neq0$ . This implies that $\\ln S_{i n j}$ is correlated with $\\epsilon_{i n j}$ in equation (A28). In practice, we pick $\\rho\\in\\{0.5,1.5\\}$ . As before, we try to recover the estimates of $\\hat{\\eta}_{S}$ ， $\\hat{\\theta}_{S}$ , and $\\bar{\\phi}_{s}$ using OLS. The results of this exercise are also presented in Table AIII. We find that as $\\rho$ deviates from O, it leads to an upward bias in the estimates of $\\hat{\\eta}_{S},\\hat{\\theta}_{S}$ , and $\\bar{\\phi}_{S}$ , with the bias increasing as $\\rho$ increases.  \n\n# APPENDIX D:ROBUSTNESS OF THE ESTIMATES OF LABOR SUBSTITUTABILITY PARAMETERS  \n\nThis appendix presents two cases where we deviate from our baseline estimates in which we randomly assigned establishments to markets within NAICS 6. The main aim is to eliminate the infuence of the random assignment of establishments into markets and explore the robustness of our estimates to potential misspecification of the labor market definition. Under each scenario in the robustness, the market size is allowed to vary based on the total number of establishments within each market and is entirely determined by the fixed market definition and the underlying microdata.  \n\nIn Table AIV, the results of the parameters for labor substitutability are presented when establishments are no longer randomly assigned to markets and when product and labor markets are defined as NAICS 6. In Table AV, the results of labor substitutability are shown when we redefine our product and labor markets to be NAICS $_3\\tt{x}$ MSA and did not randomly assign establishments to markets.  \n\nIn Table AIV, the estimates of the $\\hat{\\eta}_{H}$ and $\\hat{\\eta}_{L}$ are 2.70 and 2.50, respectively, as compared to our baseline values of 2.53 and 2.42. On the other hand, the estimates of $\\widehat{\\theta}_{H}$ and $\\hat{\\theta}_{L}$ are 1.93 and 1.87, respectively, as compared to 2.02 and 1.85. These estimates are statistically significant at $1\\%$ when we cluster the standard errors at the state level.  \n\nIn Table AV, we find that the value of the substitutability parameters for both highand low-skilled workers increases (relative to the benchmark) and the difference between $\\hat{\\eta}_{S}-\\hat{\\theta}_{S}$ widens. For instance, the estimates of $\\hat{\\eta}_{H}$ and $\\hat{\\eta}_{L}$ are 5.40 and 6.41, respectively, and those of $\\hat{\\theta}_{H}$ and $\\hat{\\theta}_{L}$ are 2.92 and 3.43. However, we find that the second-stage estimates of $\\beta_{S}=1/\\hat{\\eta}_{S}$ are no longer statistically significant when we cluster at the state level.l1 In conclusion, we find that the baseline results are robust if the random assignment of establishments to markets is eliminated and the market is defined as NAICS 6. However, the estimate of $\\hat{\\eta}_{S}$ loses statistical significance if the market is defined as NAICS $3\\mathrm{~x~MSA}$  \n\n# APPENDIX E: ADDITIONAL RESULTS  \n\n## E.1. Distributions  \n\nFigure A5 plots the distributions of log employment by skill level, $\\ln H_{i n j}$ and $\\ln L_{i n j}$ The employment distribution increases in variance, especially for high-skilled workers.  \n\nFigure A6 plots the distributions of log technology by skill level, $\\ln A_{H i n j}$ and $\\ln A_{L i n j}$ It is worthwhile to note that while employment is the primary source of establishmentlevel heterogeneity in the model inputs, the distribution of technology reflects the model structure, key parameters such as $N$ and elasticities, as well as the market assignment.  \n\nTABLEAIV ESTIMATES OF LABOR SUBSTITUTABILITY PARAMETERS: NAICS 6, TRADEABLES, WITHOUT RANDOM SAMPLING.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"6\">A.OLS and Second-Stage IV Estimates</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>OLS (1)</td><td>IV (2)</td><td></td><td>OLS (3)</td><td>IV (4)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-0.177</td><td>0.371</td><td>H</td><td>0.146</td><td>0.148</td></tr><tr><td>βH SE</td><td>0.0007</td><td>0.057</td><td>SE</td><td>0.0002</td><td>0.001</td></tr><tr><td>State-level SE</td><td>(0.002)</td><td>(0.113)</td><td>Market SE</td><td>(0.023)</td><td>(0.043)</td></tr><tr><td>βL</td><td>-0.108</td><td>0.399</td><td>yL</td><td>0.123</td><td>0.136</td></tr><tr><td>SE</td><td>0.0007</td><td>0.051</td><td>SE</td><td>0.0002</td><td>0.001</td></tr><tr><td>State-level SE</td><td>(0.003)</td><td>(0.097)</td><td>Market SE</td><td>(0.025)</td><td>(0.041)</td></tr><tr><td>Market x Year FE</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Market FE</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Establishment FE</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Year FE</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\">B.

Not only do we replicate the change in skill premium, but our model generates the substantial heterogeneity in the establishment-level skill premia we observe in the data.  \n\nFigure A8 plots the unweighted establishment-level distributions of the markup and skill-specific markdowns from our estimated model. Note that we observe a shift in all three distributions from 1997 to 2016. While we observe an increase in variance for both markdowns and markups, the upper bound for markdowns moves relatively little compared to the upper bound for markups. There is a much larger increase in the variance of markups over time.  \n\nTABLEAV ESTIMATES OF LABOR SUBSTITUTABILITY PARAMETERS: NAICS $_{3\\mathrm{X}}$ MSA, WITHOUT RANDOM SAMPLING.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"6\">A.

We estimate the prevalence and intensity of firm-level price-cost markups and either wage markups or wage markdowns. We take the dependence between these model-consistent measures of product and labor market power explicitly into account. To identify the effect of trade shocks on product and labor market power, we exploit China's reductions in input and output tariffs upon its accession to the World Trade Organization. We find that trade liberalization has not switched firms away from exercising product and labor market power. Reducing tariffs on intermediate inputs has increased a firm's pricecost markup but decreased the degree of wage-setting power that it possesses, conditional on exercising product/labor market power. Finally, we find heterogeneous effects of trade liberalization on the intensity of firms' product and labor market power, giving insights into the true consequences of trade shocks.  \n\n# JEL Classification: Keywords:  \n\nF14, F16, L11, P31   \nprice-cost markups, wage markups, wage markdowns, trade   \nliberalization, tariffs  \n\n# Corresponding author:  \n\nSabien Dobbelaere   \nVrije Universiteit Amsterdam   \nSchool of Business and Economics   \nDe Boelelaan 1105   \n1081 HV Amsterdam   \nThe Netherlands   \nE-mail: sabien.dobbelaere@vu.nl  \n\n## 1.Introduction  \n\nSince the onset of economic reform in 1978, China's transformation into a market-driven economy has led to rapid economic growth. The role of market forces in allocating resources has been accelerated by the country's entry to the World Trade Organization at the end of2001.1  \n\nDespite incentive mechanism and allocation system reforms, there still exists considerable interfirm dispersion of marginal factor returns.2 Viewed through the lens of a static standard model of production and demand, such disparities suggest the existence of distortions to the functioning of markets. Notwithstanding overwhelming evidence on factor market distortions in China,? no empirical study has so far estimated the impact of WTO entry on price distortions in product as well as labor markets, which is the main purpose of this Study.4  \n\nWe contribute to the empirical international trade literature by establishing the effect of trade liberalization on firms’ product and labor market power using an actual liberalization period.5 Such investigation is well justified for several reasons. First, recent theoretical heterogeneous-firms approaches to trade and wage inequality all draw on imperfect labor markets and consider rent sharing to be the key mechanism through which trade-induced variation in rents is transmitted to variation in wages. Second, disentangling the impact of trade liberalization on product versus labor market power matters a lot for policy concerned with allocative efficiency, (wage and consumption) inequality, welfare losses, and the falling labor share in national income. As such, our analysis sheds light on whether either market power on the supply side of labor or market power on the demand side of labor is predominantly responsible for distorting factor prices and whether the balance of power has shifted after WTO entry.  \n\nWe generalize the model of De Loecker and Warzynski (2012) for obtaining firm-level price-cost markups which assumes that firms minimize costs with respect to labor and materials. Such standard cost-minimization assumption rules out that firms exercise wagesetting power. We relax this assumption and nest two polar models of wage formation in imperfect labor markets in the seminal productivity model of Hall (1988) with price-setting firms. These models are tied to two sources of labor market imperfections that give rise to wage-employment contracts off the firm's labor demand curve. Labor market imperfections may either stem from workers′ monopoly power forcing employers to pay a wage markup, or from firms' monopsony power enabling them to set a wage markdown. Overall, we consider two pricing rules in the product market (price-marginal cost and price-markup pricing) and three pricing rules in the labor market (wage-markdown, wage-marginal product and wagemarkup pricing). Our model takes the dependence between pricing rules in the product and labor markets explicitly into account.  \n\nWe estimate the prevalence and intensity of Chinese firms’ market power in product and labor markets using a panel of 57,577 manufacturing firms located in the three most important economic regions during the period 1999-2006, constructed from annual surveys conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).  \n\nWe then examine whether China's WTO membership has affected the product and labor market power of Chinese firms. As such, our application can be considered as a generalization of Brandt et al. (2017) who examine the impact of trade liberalization in China on the magnitude of price-cost markups (and productivity) of Chinese firms. To identify the effect of a trade shock on product and labor market power, we exploit China's reductions in input and output tariffs upon its WTO accession at the end of 2001, following Lu and Yu (2015) and Brandt et al. (2017). Intuitively, falling input tariffs might increase technical efficiency through access to lower-cost and superior intermediate products while output tariff cuts directly decrease domestic output prices and might indirectly decrease X-inefficiencies through reducing managerial slack and changing organizational structure.  \n\nSeveral novel findings emerge. First, we find that trade liberalization has not affected the prevalence of price-cost markups and wage markups/wage markdowns. More specifically, tariff reductions have not switched frms away from exercising product and labor market power.  \n\nSecond, trade liberalization through tariff cuts on intermediate inputs has increased a firm's price-cost markup but decreased the degree of wage-setting power that it possesses, conditional on exercising product /labor market power respectively. The positive effect of input tariff cuts on the magnitude of price-cost markups confirms the finding of Brandt et al. (2017). The narrowing effect of input tariff cuts on wage markdowns (hence, the negative effect on firms’ wage-setting power) is largely driven by state-owned enterprises.  \n\nThird, modeling the dependence between pricing rules in product and labor markets allows us to reveal heterogeneous trade liberalization effects on the intensity of firms' product and labor market power. We find that the positive impact of input tariff cuts on firms' product market power (price-cost markups) is most pronounced for firms that exercise labor market power (set wage markdowns). Likewise, the negative impact of input tariff cuts on firms' labor market power (narrowing impact on wage markdowns) is most pronounced for firms that exercise product market power (set price-cost markups).  \n\nThe outline of the article is as follows. Section 2 presents the main ingredients of the theoretical structural productivity model with imperfect product and labor markets. Section 3 discusses the econometric model. Section 4 presents the classification and testing procedures to identify a firm's pricing rules in product and labor markets at any point in time. Section 5 presents the Chinese firm panel data. Section 6 reports the outcome of the testing procedure. Sections 7 documents the impact of trade liberalization on switching the prevalence of firms' product and labor market power. Section 8 presents the impact of trade liberalization on the intensity of firms’ product and labor market power. Section 9 concludes.  \n\n2. Theoretical structural model with imperfect product and labor markets  \n\nTo model a frm's product and labor market power, we follow Dobbelaere and Mairesse (2013) and nest two polar models of wage formation in imperfect labor markets in the seminal productivity model of Hall (1988) with imperfect product markets.  \n\nEach frm at any point in time produces output ( $Q_{i t}$ )using labor ( $N_{i t}$ ), intermediate input $M_{i t}$ )and capital ( $K_{i t}$ ). We assume that all producers that are active in the market are maximizing short-run profits and take the price of intermediate input as given.6 Each firm must choose the optimal quantity of output and the optimal demand for intermediate input and labor. In terms of the frm's input choices, we assume that intermediate input and labor are free of adjustment costs and thus choice variables in the short run whereas capital is predetermined and thus no choice variable in the short run.  \n\nThe first-order condition for output yields the frm's price-cost markup $\\begin{array}{r}{\\mu_{i t}=\\frac{P_{i t}}{\\left(C_{Q}\\right)_{i t}}}\\end{array}$ (Ce) with $P_{i t}$ the output price and $\\left(C_{Q}\\right)_{i t}$ the marginal cost of production.  \n\nThe first-order condition for intermediate input is given by setting the marginal revenue product of intermediate iput qul to the prie of intermediate input: $\\begin{array}{r}{(Q_{M})_{i t}=\\mu_{i t}\\frac{J_{i t}}{P_{i t}}}\\end{array}$ ， with $\\left(Q_{M}\\right)_{i t}$ the marginal product of intermediate input and $J_{i t}$ the price of intermediate input. Using this first-order condition and the frst-order condition for output, we obtain an expression for firm $i$ 's price-cost markup $\\mu_{i t}$  \n\n$$\n\\mu_{i t}=\\frac{(\\varepsilon_{M}^{Q})_{i t}}{\\alpha_{i t}^{M}},\n$$  \n\nWwith $(\\varepsilon_{M}^{Q})_{i t}$ th outpu lastit ith repeto intermedit input and $\\begin{array}{r}{\\alpha_{i t}^{M}=\\frac{J_{i t}M_{i t}}{P_{i t}Q_{i t}}}\\end{array}$ JitMit the share of intermediate input expenditure in total revenue. The value of $\\mu_{i t}$ determines the frm's type of competition prevailing in the product market or its product market setting (denoted $P M S$ ). The product market setting is defined to be perfectly competitive if the firm engages in marginal cost pricing ( $P M C$ ) and, hence, has no product market power. The product market setting is defined to be imperfectly competitive if the firm sets a pricecost markup ( ${}^{\\prime P M U}$ ), which is our model consistent measure of product market power.  \n\nFirm $i$ 's wage formation process, and, hence, its optimal demand for labor depends on the prevalence and the source of labor market imperfections. The firm's type of competition prevailing in the labor market or its labor market setting (denoted $L M S$ ) is defined to be perfectly competitive if the firm engages in marginal product pricing ( WMP), that is, pays the marginal employee a real wage equal to her marginal product.7 Its labor market setting is defined to be imperfectly competitive if the firm either pays a wage markup $(W M U)$ that is, pays the marginal employee a real wage exceeding her marginal product; or sets a wage markdown ( WMD), that is, pays the marginal employee a real wage lower than her marginal product.  \n\nIntuitively, the perfectly competitive labor market setting ( $L M S=W M P$ )ariseswhen the wage-employment contract lies on the firm's labor demand curve, which characterizes profit-maximizing employment levels.8 Analogous to the case of intermediate input, the first-order condition for labor under $L M S=W M P$ is given by setting the marginal revenue product o labor equal to the price o labor: $\\begin{array}{r}{(Q_{N})_{i t}=\\mu_{i t}\\frac{W_{i t}}{P_{i t}}}\\end{array}$ , with $\\left(Q_{N}\\right)_{i t}$ the marginal product of labor and $W_{i t}$ the price of labor. Hence, absent labor market imperfections, there exists no wedge between the output elasticities of intermediate input and labor and their respective revenue shares. Since this wedge is derived using the first-order conditions for output, intermediate input and labor, we call this wedge the firm's joint market imperfections parameter $\\psi_{i t}$  \n\n$$\n\\psi_{i t}=\\frac{(\\varepsilon_{M}^{Q})_{i t}}{\\alpha_{i t}^{M}}-\\frac{(\\varepsilon_{N}^{Q})_{i t}}{\\alpha_{i t}^{N}}=0,\n$$  \n\nwith $(\\varepsilon_{N}^{Q})_{i t}$ the output elasticity with respect to labor and $\\begin{array}{r}{\\alpha_{i t}^{N}=\\frac{W_{i t}N_{i t}}{P_{i t}Q_{i t}}}\\end{array}$ WuNit the share of labor input expenditure in total revenue.  \n\nIn contrast to marginal product pricing, labor market imperfections give rise to wageemployment contracts off the firm's labor demand curve. We consider two polar sources of such imperfections. Labor market imperfections may stem from workers’ monopoly/bargaining power that forces employers to pay a wage markup ( $L M S=W M U$ ). There exist different underlying theoretical structural models leading to wage-employment contracts above the firm's labor demand curve. Wage-markup pricing may, e.g., arise when $(i)$ a firm and its workforce negotiate simultaneously over wages and employment (McDonald and Solow, 1981), $(i i)$ a firm bargains over wages with a workforce of declining size caused by employees gradually losing their job after bargaining breaks down (Dobbelaere and Luttens, 2016), or $(i i i)$ an employee bargains individually over wages with a firm that does not incur hiring costs (Stole and Zwiebel, 1996). Considering the first -widely-usedtheoretical structural model, Dobbelaere and Mairesse (2013) show that the first-order $(\\varepsilon_{N}^{Q})_{i t}=\\mu_{i t}\\alpha_{i t}^{N}-\\mu_{i t}\\gamma_{i t}(1-\\alpha_{i t}^{N}-\\alpha_{i t}^{M})$ $\\begin{array}{r}{\\gamma_{i t}=\\frac{\\phi_{i t}}{1-\\phi_{i t}}\\geqslant0}\\end{array}$ the relative extent of rent sharing and $\\phi_{i t}\\in[0,1]$ the part of economic rents going to the workers or the degree of workers’ bargaining power during worker-firm negotiations. $\\phi_{i t}$ is our model consistent measure of labor market power under $L M S=W M U$ . Hence, the firm's joint market imperfections parameter $\\psi_{i t}$ under $L M S=W M U$ is equal to:  \n\n$$\n\\psi_{i t}=\\frac{(\\varepsilon_{M}^{Q})_{i t}}{\\alpha_{i t}^{M}}-\\frac{(\\varepsilon_{N}^{Q})_{i t}}{\\alpha_{i t}^{N}}=\\mu_{i t}\\frac{\\phi_{i t}}{1-\\phi_{i t}}\\left[\\frac{1-\\alpha_{i t}^{N}-\\alpha_{i t}^{M}}{\\alpha_{i t}^{N}}\\right]>0.\n$$  \n\nLabor market imperfections may also arise from firms’ monoposony power that enables them to set a wage markdown ( $L M S=W M D$ ). There exist different underlying theoretical structural models leading to wage-employment contracts below the firm's labor demand curve. Wage-markdown pricing may, e.g., arise when $(i)$ workers have heterogeneous preferences over work environments of different potential employers, $(i i)$ employers collude, or $(i i i)$ employers are active in highly concentrated labor markets (Manning,  \n\n2003, 2011). Considering the first -widely-used- theoretical structural model, Dobbelaere and Mairesse (2013) show that the first-order condition for labor is given by: $(\\varepsilon_{N}^{Q})_{i t}=$ $\\begin{array}{r}{\\mu_{i t}\\alpha_{i t}^{N}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{(\\varepsilon_{W}^{N})_{i t}}\\right)}\\end{array}$ ,with $(\\varepsilon_{W}^{N})_{i t}\\in\\mathbb{R}_{+}$ the wage elasticity of the labor supply of firm $i$ measuring the degree of wage-setting power that firm $i$ possesses. $(\\varepsilon_{W}^{N})_{i t}$ is our model consistent measure of labor market power under $L M S=W M D$ . Hence, the firm's joint market imperfections parameters $\\psi_{i t}$ under $L M S=W M D$ is equal to:  \n\n$$\n\\psi_{i t}=\\frac{(\\varepsilon_{M}^{Q})_{i t}}{\\alpha_{i t}^{M}}-\\frac{(\\varepsilon_{N}^{Q})_{i t}}{\\alpha_{i t}^{N}}=-\\frac{\\mu_{i t}}{(\\varepsilon_{W}^{N})_{i t}}<0.\n$$  \n\nThe pricing rules in the product and labor markets lead to six possible regimes of competitiveness $R\\in\\Re=\\{P M C-W M D$ , PMU-WMD, PMC-WMP, PMU-WMP, PMC-WMU, $P M U-W M U\\}$ that we consider. Each corresponds to a combination of the type of competition prevailing in the product market or product market setting $P M S\\in\\{P M C,~P M U\\}$ and the type of competition prevailing in the labor market or labor market setting $L M S\\in$ $\\{W M D,W M P,W M U\\}$ . These regimes are characterized as subsets of dimension two in the two-dimensional space of the key parameters of our static productivity model, which are the price-cost markup $\\mu_{i t}$ and the joint market imperfections parameter $\\psi_{i t}$ . Table 1 summarizes the six possible regimes.  \n\n<Insert Table 1 about here>  \n\n## 3. Econometric model  \n\nIn order to obtain consistent estimates of the output elasticities $(\\varepsilon_{N}^{Q})_{i t}$ and $(\\varepsilon_{M}^{Q})_{i t}$ ，we only consider production functions with $(i)$ a scalar Hicks-neutral productivity term which is observed by the firm but unobserved by the econometrician (denoted by $\\omega_{i t}$ )and $(i i)$ common technology parameters, governing the transformation of inputs to units of output, across a set of producers (denoted by the vector $\\beta$ ). These two assumptions imply the following expression for the production function:  \n\n$$\nQ_{i t}=F(N_{i t},M_{i t},K_{i t};\\beta)\\exp(\\omega_{i t}).\n$$  \n\nGuided by data availability, we cluster producers based on geography and industry. In order to obtain consistent estimates of the production function coefficients ( $\\beta$ )for each of our 28 two-digit industries within each of the three main economic regions in China (which are defined in Section 5), we need to control for unobserved productivity shocks $\\omega_{i t}$ ,which are potentially correlated with the firm's input choices. Following Dobbelaere and Kiyota (2018), we apply the estimation procedure proposed by Ackerberg et al. (2015) using the insight that optimal input choices hold information about unobserved productivity. We denote the logs of $Q_{i t}$ ， $N_{i t}$ $M_{i t}$ and $K_{i t}$ by $q_{i t}$ ， $n_{i t}$ ， $m_{i t}$ and $k_{i t}$ ,respectively.  \n\nWe impose the following timing assumptions. Capital $k_{i t}$ is assumed to be decided a period ahead (at $t-1$ ) because of planning and installation lags. Labor is “less variable” than material. More precisely, $n_{i t}$ is chosen by firm $i$ at time $t-b$ C $0<b<1$ ),after $k_{i t}$ being chosen at $t-1$ but prior to $m_{i t}$ being chosen at $t$ . This assumption is consistent with firms needing time to train new workers, with firms facing significant hiring or fring costs for labor, or with labor contracts being long term.  \n\nWe assume that productivity $\\left(\\omega_{i t}\\right)$ evolves according to an endogenous first-order Markov process. In particular, we allow a firm's decision to export (denoted $E X P_{i t-1}$ ) to endogenously affect future productivity, which is supported by evidence in international economics applications (the Melitz's selection effect; see e.g. Helpman (2006) and Bernard et al. (2007, 2012) for reviews of empirical evidence on the positive exporter productivity premium). As such, we can decompose $\\omega_{i t}$ into its conditional expectation given the information known by the firm in $t-1$ (denoted $I_{i t-1}$ ) and a random innovation to productivity (denoted $\\xi_{i t}$  \n\n$$\n\\omega_{i t}=\\mathbb{E}[\\omega_{i t}|I_{i t-1}]+\\xi_{i t}=\\mathbb{E}[\\omega_{i t}|\\omega_{i t-1},E X P_{i t-1}]+\\xi_{i t}=g(\\omega_{i t-1},E X P_{i t-1})+\\xi_{i t},\n$$  \n\nwith $g(\\cdot)$ a general function. $\\xi_{i t}$ is assumed to be mean independent of the firm's information set at $t-1$  \n\nGiven these timing assumptions, firm $i$ 's intermediate input demand at $t$ depends directly on $n_{i t}$ chosen prior to $m_{i t}$ , i.e. the input demand function for $m_{i t}$ is conditional on $n_{i t}$  \n\n$$\nm_{i t}=m_{t}(n_{i t},k_{i t},E X P_{i t},\\omega_{i t}).\n$$  \n\nEq. (7) shows that $\\omega_{i t}$ is the only unobservable entering the intermediate input demand function. This scalar unobservable assumption together with the assumption that $m_{t}(\\cdot)$ is strictly increasing in $\\omega_{i t}$ conditional on $n_{i t}$ ， $k_{i t}$ and $E X P_{i t}$ (strict monotonicity assump$\\tan^{9}$ ), allow to invert $\\omega_{i t}$ as a function of observables:  \n\n$$\n\\omega_{i t}=m_{t}^{-1}(m_{i t},n_{i t},k_{i t},E X P_{i t}).\n$$  \n\nConsidering the logarithmic version of Eq. (5) and allowing for an idiosyncratic error term including non-predictable output shocks and potential measurement error in output and inputs $(\\epsilon_{i t})$ gives:  \n\n$$\ny_{i t}=f(n_{i t},m_{i t},k_{i t};\\beta)+\\omega_{i t}+\\epsilon_{i t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $y_{i t}=q_{i t}+\\epsilon_{i t}$ with $\\epsilon_{i t}$ assumed to be mean independent of current and past input choices.10  \n\nWeapproximate $f(\\cdot)$ by a second-order polynomial where all logged inputs, logged inputs squared and interaction terms between logged inputs are included (translog production function):  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{y_{i t}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{n}n_{i t}+\\beta_{m}m_{i t}+\\beta_{k}k_{i t}+\\beta_{n n}n_{i t}^{2}+\\beta_{m m}m_{i t}^{2}+\\beta_{k k}k_{i t}^{2}}}\\ {{+\\beta_{n m}n_{i t}m_{i t}+\\beta_{n k}n_{i t}k_{i t}+\\beta_{m k}m_{i t}k_{i t}+\\omega_{i t}+\\epsilon_{i t},}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\beta_{0}$ has to be interpreted as the mean efficiency level across firms.  \n\nSubstituting Eq. (8) in Eq. (10) results in a first-stage equation of the form:  \n\n$$\ny_{i t}=f_{i t}+m_{t}^{-1}(m_{i t},n_{i t},k_{i t},E X P_{i t})+\\epsilon_{i t}=\\varphi_{t}(n_{i t},m_{i t},k_{i t},E X P_{i t})+\\epsilon_{i t},\n$$  \n\nwhich has the purpose of separating $\\omega_{i t}$ from $\\epsilon_{i t}$ , i.e. eliminating the portion of output $y_{i t}$ determined by unanticipated shocks at time $t$ , measurement error or any other random noise $(\\epsilon_{i t})$  \n\nHence, the first stage involves using Eq. (11) and the moment condition $\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_{i t}|I_{i t}]=0$ to obtain an estimate $\\widehat{\\varphi}_{i t}$ , of the composite term $\\varphi_{t}(n_{i t},m_{i t},k_{i t},E X P_{i t})=f_{i t}+m_{t}^{-1}(m_{i t},n_{i t}$ $k_{i t},E X P_{i t}).$ . which represents output net of $\\epsilon_{i t}$ . In our application, estimation of Eq. (11) is implemented by regressing output on a second-order polynomial series expansion where all logged inputs, logged inputs squared and interaction terms between logged inputs are included. To allow for time variation in $\\varphi_{t}$ , these polynomial terms are interacted with a time trend.  \n\nGiven a particular set of parameters $\\beta$ , we can compute (up to a scalar constant) an estimate of $\\omega_{i t}$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\widehat{\\omega}_{i t}(\\beta)=\\widehat{m}_{t}^{-1}(m_{i t},n_{i t},k_{i t},E X P_{i t})}\\ &{\\qquad=\\widehat{\\varphi}_{i t}-\\beta_{0}-\\beta_{n}n_{i t}-\\beta_{m}m_{i t}-\\beta_{k}k_{i t}-\\beta_{n n}n_{i t}^{2}-\\beta_{m m}m_{i t}^{2}-\\beta_{k k}k_{i t}^{2}}\\ &{\\qquad-\\beta_{n m}n_{i t}m_{i t}-\\beta_{n k}n_{i t}k_{i t}-\\beta_{m k}m_{i t}k_{i t}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIn order to implement the second stage and to identify the production function coefficients, we need to recover the innovation to productivity $(\\xi_{i t})$ to form moments on. Using Eq. (12), a consistent (non-parametric) approximation to $\\mathbb{E}[\\omega_{i t}|\\omega_{i t-1},E X P_{i t-1}]$ is given by the predicted values from regressing nonparametrically $\\widehat{\\omega}_{i t}(\\beta)$ on ${\\widehat{\\omega}}_{i t-1}(\\beta)$ and $E X P_{i t-1}$ .The residual from this regression provides us with an estimate of $\\xi_{i t}$  \n\nGiven the timing assumptions on input use, the following population moment conditions can be defined: $\\mathbb{E}[\\xi_{i t}(\\beta)d]=0$ where the set of instruments is:  \n\n$$\nd_{i t}=\\left\\{n_{i t-1},m_{i t-1},k_{i t},n_{i t-1}^{2},m_{i t-1}^{2},k_{i t}^{2},n_{i t-1}m_{i t-1},n_{i t-1}k_{i t},m_{i t-1}k_{i t}\\right\\}.\n$$  \n\nExploiting these moment conditions, we can now estimate the production function coefficients $\\beta$ using standard GMM and rely on block bootstrapping for the standard errors. The estimated production function coeficients $\\widehat{\\beta}$ are then used together with data on inputs to compute the output elasticities at the firm-year level. In particular, we calculate the firm-year elasticity of output with respect to labor as:  \n\n$$\n(\\widehat{\\varepsilon}_{N}^{Q})_{i t}=\\widehat{\\beta}_{n}+2\\widehat{\\beta}_{n n}n_{i t}+\\widehat{\\beta}_{n m}m_{i t}+\\widehat{\\beta}_{n k}k_{i t}.\n$$  \n\nSimilarly, we calculate the frm-year elasticity of output with respect to material as:l1  \n\n$$\n(\\widehat{\\varepsilon}_{M}^{Q})_{i t}=\\widehat{\\beta}_{m}+2\\widehat{\\beta}_{m m}m_{i t}+\\widehat{\\beta}_{m n}n_{i t}+\\widehat{\\beta}_{m k}k_{i t}.\n$$  \n\nUsing the shares of labor and intermediate input expenditure in total revenue, $\\alpha_{i t}^{N}$ and $\\alpha_{i t}^{M}$ , respectively, and our estimates of the output elasticities, $(\\hat{\\varepsilon}_{N}^{Q})_{i t}$ and $(\\hat{\\varepsilon}_{M}^{Q})_{i t}$ , we are able to compute $\\widehat{\\mu}_{i t}$ and $\\widehat{\\psi}_{i t}$ . Since we only observe $Y_{i t}=Q_{i t}\\exp(\\epsilon_{i t})$ , we do not observe the correct expenditure shares for $N_{i t}$ and $M_{i t}$ . We can recover an estimate of $\\epsilon_{i t}$ from the frst stage to adjust the expenditure shares as follows:12  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\widehat{\\alpha}_{i t}^{N}=\\frac{W_{i t}N_{i t}}{P_{i t}\\frac{Y_{i t}}{\\exp(\\epsilon_{i t})}},}\\ {\\widehat{\\alpha}_{i t}^{M}=\\frac{J_{i t}M_{i t}}{P_{i t}\\frac{Y_{i t}}{\\exp(\\epsilon_{i t})}}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nUsing Eqs. (14), (15), (16), and (17), we compute $\\widehat{\\mu}_{i t}$ and $\\widehat{\\psi}_{i t}$ as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle\\widehat{\\mu}_{i t}=\\frac{\\big(\\widehat{\\varepsilon}_{M}^{Q}\\big)_{i t}}{\\widehat{\\alpha}_{i t}^{M}},}\\ {\\displaystyle\\widehat{\\psi}_{i t}=\\frac{\\big(\\widehat{\\varepsilon}_{M}^{Q}\\big)_{i t}}{\\widehat{\\alpha}_{i t}^{M}}-\\frac{\\big(\\widehat{\\varepsilon}_{N}^{Q}\\big)_{i t}}{\\widehat{\\alpha}_{i t}^{N}}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n## 4. Classification and testing procedures  \n\n### 4.1. Classification procedure  \n\n(defined as the gap between the output elasticity with respect to intermediate input and the share of intermediate input expenditure in total revenue) and the joint market imperfectionsparameter $\\psi$ (defined as the difference in the gap between the output elasticities of intermediate input and labor and their respective expenditure shares).  \n\nEstimates of $\\widehat{\\mu}_{i t}$ and $\\hat{\\psi}_{i t}$ are used to define simultaneously the product market setting and labor market setting of firm $i$ at time $t$ . Different combinations of product and labor market settings classify firm $i$ at time $t$ into a different regime of competitiveness. We apply the classification procedure of Dobbelaere and Mairesse (2013), which is summarized in Table 2.  \n\n<Insert Table 2 about here>  \n\n### 4.2. Testing procedure  \n\nIdeally, we would like to implement our classification procedure using a testing procedure that identifies exactly the regime of competitiveness for each firm at each year. However, as hypothesis testing is built around the principle of rejecting or not the null hypothesis, we are not able to do so. A priori, we want to be agnostic about a preferred regime and, hence, we want to avoid preferential treatment of any particular regime. To accomplish this, we stick to classical hypothesis testing theory and adopt the following strategy.13 We take each regime of our classification procedure (see Table 2) sequentially as our null hypothesis and test it using an appropriate test.14 The intuition behind this strategy is that each regime sequentially is taken to be the truth (that is, adopted as the null hypothesis). We then ask whether there is enough information in the data that supports this claim. The outcome of this strategy is one regime, or potentially a set of regimes, that on the basis of the data cannot be rejected, and, hence, is a/are plausible description(s) of the true regime of competitiveness.  \n\nApplying our strategy to the classification procedure outlined above requires implementing a test that is capable of handling nonlinear restrictions on the parameters of the model and testing restrictions under the alternative as well as the null, while taking the dependence between the estimated parameters explicitly into account. We judge that the distance test of Kodde and Palm (1984, 1986) is best equipped to do so, given the fexibility in the type of restrictions on the parameters this test is able to cope with. To identify a firm's regime of competitiveness at any point in time, the distance test combined with our testing strategy is implemented at the $10\\%$ significance level. We define the distance test in formal mathematical terms in Appendix A.  \n\n## 5.Data  \n\nWe use Chinese firm-level data from the Annual Survey of Industrial Firms (ASIF) conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) for the period 1999-2006. This is the most comprehensive and representative firm-level dataset in China, and surveyed firms contribute to the majority of China's industrial value added. The survey includes all industrial firms that are either state-owned or non-state firms with sales above 5 million RMB (Chinese currency).15 In addition, we use complementary information including industry concordances and detailed price deflators for all nominal variables that capture price evolutions common to all firms in a narrowly defined industry, provided by Brandt et al. (2012). We select all firms located in the three most important economic zones in China: the Bohai Bay Economic Rim region surrounding Beijing and Tianjin in the north, the Yangtze River Delta region comprising Shanghai in the east and the Pearl River Delta metropolitan region in the south.  \n\nOutput ( $Q$ ) is defined as real gross output measured by nominal production divided by a 4-digit industry output price index. Labor ( $N$ ) refers to the average number of permanent workers. Material input is defined as intermediate consumption deflated by an intermediate consumption price index. The latter is calculated using the output defators and information from the 2002 national input-output table. Refecting the higher level of aggregation of the Chinese input-output table, intermediate input deflators are at the 3-digit level. The capital stock ( $K$ )is measured by the real capital stock, computed from tangible assets and investment based on the perpetual inventory method and using the Brandt-Rawski deflator (Perkins and Rawski, 2008) to deflate annual investment. Employee compensation includes wages, employee supplementary benefits, unemployment insurance, retirement benefits, health insurance, and housing benefits. Reported compensation, however, appears to underestimate total payments to labor. The median labor share, defined as the share of value added which is payed out to workers, is only $28.1\\%$ .By comparison, the national income accounts suggest a median share of labor around $50\\%$ Therefore, we follow Hsieh and Klenow (2009) and Brandt et al. (2012) by infating the median wage share to half of the value added to approximate the fraction in the national accounts. The shares of labor ( $\\alpha^{N}$ ) and material input ( $\\alpha^{M}$ ) are constructed by dividing respectively the frm total labor cost and undefated intermediate consumption by the firm undeflated production.  \n\nWe focus only on manufacturing firms, assigning firms to 28 two-digit industries within each of the three considered economic regions. We deleted observations with cost shares greater than or equal to one and smaller than or equal to zero. We also disregarded observations with top and bottom 1 percentiles in industry-year cost shares to remove outliers. We selected firms that survive at least four consecutive years because lagged inputs are needed to construct moment conditions in our estimation framework. Our estimation sample consists of 57,577 frms. Table B.1 in Appendix B reports the panel structure of the estimation sample. Table B.2 reports the number of observations and firms by industry. Table 3 reports the means, standard deviations, and quartile values of the main variables in our estimation sample.  \n\n# <Insert Table 3 about here>  \n\nTo identify the impact of trade liberalization on the prevalence and intensity of product and labor market power, we exploit variation in tarif reductions across industries, following Lu and Yu (2015) and Brandt et al. (2017). In early 2002, China started to fulfill its tariff reduction responsibilities as a WTO member. According to the WTO accession agreement, China was required to complete tariff reductions by 2004. We exploit the fact that industries that have previously been more protected (i.e. with higher tariffs) experienced greater tariff reduction under the WTO agreement and therefore higher degrees of liberalization whereas previously more open industries (i.e. with lower tarifs) witnessed small tariff reductions and therefore less liberalization. Presumably, China was required to reduce tariffs to WTO-determined levels, which are quite uniform across products, whereas pre-WTO tariff levels varied widely across products. As a consequence, both the average and dispersion of tariffs across industries fell.  \n\nProduct-level tariff rates at the 8-digit level of the Harmonized System product classification are mapped into China's Industrial Classification (CIC) system at the 4-digit level to obtain output tariffs that we use in the firm-level analysis. Input tariffs are a weighted average of output tariffs, using industry shares from the off-diagonal elements of the 2002 input-output table as weights. Given that the input-output table is defined at the 3-digit level, so are the input tariffs. Over the period 1998-2006, average output tariffs fell from close to 20% to nearly 9%, whereas average input tariffs dropped from slightly over $15\\%$ to just above 7%. Hence, we observe not only tariff compression within each tariff type, but also a narrowing gap between the two tariff types.  \n\n## 6. Regimes of competitiveness  \n\n### 6.1. Inconclusiveness of the distance test  \n\nAs explained in Section 4, the identification of a firm's competitiveness regime at any point in time is based on implementing the distance test, which takes the dependence between a firm's product market setting and its labor market setting explicitly into account.  \n\nThe distance test is inconclusive in identifying a firm's regime of competitiveness at any point in time in 44% of the cases. In 72% of these inconclusive cases, the test is in doubt between two regimes.  \n\nLet us now explore the nature of this inconclusiveness. We estimated a probit model including several firm characteristics —such as capital intensity, size (number of workers) and ownership type— industry fixed effects, regional fixed effects and a pre-WTO period indicator. We find that industry fixed effects are the driving source of the observed inconclusiveness. Ownership type and regional fixed effects seem to play only a minor role. As such, we conclude that firm characteristics neither significantly nor economically explain the observed inconclusiveness of the distance test.  \n\nRecal that we define market boundaries based on geography and industry, that is, we estimate the translog production function coefficients for each of our 28 two-digit industries within each of the three considered economic regions. One potential reason for explaining the role of industry fixed effects in driving the inconclusiveness could be industry size. This is because the precision of the production function estimates determines the precision of the output elasticities with respect to labor and intermediate input and, hence, the precision of the key parameters of our static productivity model, $\\mu$ and $\\psi$ (see Eqs. (18)-(19)). This, in turn, determines the outcome of the distance test. In order to determine whether this precision varies by industry size, we perform a variance decomposition on the difference in variance of the output elasticities for large and small industries. In this decomposition, we consider the difference in the average variance for a large and a small industry and decompose this difference into two components. The first component corresponds to the difference in precision of the production function estimates, keeping the input factors constant at the large-industry average. The second component corresponds to the difference in input factors, keeping the precision of the production function estimates at the level of the small industry. Such decomposition can be interpreted as separating the difference in variance into (i) a component related to the difference in precision due to different sample sizes and (ii) a component related to the difference in input factors which also affects the variance of the output elasticities through the translog functional form of the production function. This variance-decomposition is done pair-wise for each small-large industry combination. In general, differences in precision of the translog production function coefficients account for more than 80% of differences in precision of the output elasticities between a large and small industry. These findings are robust to classifying small industries as falling below the 25th-, 50th-, or 75th-percentile of the industry size distribution.  \n\nLet us now turn to the composition of inconclusiveness at the industry level, which is visualized in Figure 1. The inconclusive cases are split into inconclusiveness between two regimes and inconclusiveness between more than two regimes, which we label as mild and severe inconclusiveness, respectively. Overall, Figure 1 shows a large fraction of mild inconclusiveness, but also highlights heterogeneity across industries in terms of the level as well as the composition of inconclusive cases.  \n\n# <Insert Figure 1 about here>  \n\nFigure 2 confirms, in line with the results from the probit model and the variance decomposition, that industry size is an important determinant of inconclusiveness at the industry level. More specifically, there appears to be a strongly negative relationship between inconclusiveness and industry size. Figure 2 also reveals that there is a gap for small industries compared to medium-large industries between total inconclusiveness and inconclusiveness between two regimes. For medium and large industries, inconclusiveness between two regimes accounts for 80-90% of total inconclusiveness, while for small industries this fraction is around $50-60\\%$  \n\n# <Insert Figure 2 about here>  \n\nRecall that a firm's regime of competitiveness at any point in time corresponds to a combination of the type of competition prevailing in the product market or product market setting, and the type of competition prevailing in the labor market or labor market setting. To explore the importance of each market setting in driving the inconclusiveness of the distance test in identifying a frm's regime of competitiveness, Figure 3 shows inconclusiveness due to inconclusiveness related to the product (labor) market setting, conditional on being able to identify the labor (product) market setting. We observe that, conditional on being able to identify the product market setting, the labor market setting is identified as well in almost all cases. In other words, conditional on conclusiveness of the product market setting, there is almost no inconclusiveness of the labor market setting. Figure 3 shows that this does not hold for conditional inconclusiveness of the product market setting. Conditional on being able to identify the labor market setting, the inconclusiveness of the product market setting is 50-70% for small industries and goes down to around $20\\%$ for large industries. As such, we observe that almost all inconclusiveness between two regimes is driven by conditional $P M S$ -inconclusiveness. Our intuition is that, in reality, firms seldom operate under a theoretical extreme of the product market setting spectrum. For example, frms might be able to exercise market power on some market segments but not on others. As such, total inconclusiveness seems to be driven by the fact that we only consider two (extreme) product market settings.  \n\n<Insert Figure 3 about here>  \n\n### 6.2. Stability of regimes of competitiveness  \n\nThe panel nature of the data enables us to investigate time variation in a firm's regime of competitiveness over the period 2000-2006. Given the large number of firms, we present results at the industry level which we obtain by aggregating the firm-year results. More specifically, the firm-year number of occurrences are aggregated at the industry level by summing up the firm-year level occurrences weighted by the share of value added for all firms within the industry, i.e.:  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{i\\in\\Im}w_{i}\\left(\\#\\mathrm{~of~occurrences~of~regime~}R\\right),\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\Im$ denotes the set of firms contained in industry $j$ and $w_{i}$ denotes the weight defined as the share of value added of firm $i$ . The weighted frequencies of occurrence of competitiveness regimes are obtained by dividing the aggregated weighted number of occurrences by the weighted number of observations within the industry, i.e.:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{i\\in\\Im}w_{i}\\left(\\#\\mathrm{~of~}\\mathrm{occurrences~of~}\\mathrm{regime~}R\\right)}{\\sum_{i\\in\\Im}w_{i}}.\n$$  \n\nThe prevailing regime at the industry level is the regime that has the highest frequency of occurrence. Since this prevailing industry-specific regime masks time variation in dominant regimes for a particular industry, we first look at the evolution of industry-specific dominant regimes over time. This is accomplished by aggregating firm-year number of occurrences at the industry-year level using the same weighted sum as discussed above. The dominant industry-year regime is the regime with the highest weighted frequency of occurrence. When the maximum weighted frequency occurs at multiple regimes, the first regime encountered is chosen to be the dominant regime.  \n\nTable 4 presents variation in regimes of competitiveness over the period 2000-2006 at the industry level. We find that 25% of industries (7 out of 28) observe at least one change in their regime of competitiveness over time. This apparent stability suggests that the impact of WTO membership on regime switches is relatively modest. Besides, some of the switches in regimes over time are caused by the inconclusiveness of the distance test, i.e. for some firms and years the distance test is not able to identify a single regime of competitiveness.  \n\n# <Insert Table 4 about here>  \n\nLet us now turn to the regimes of competitiveness that prevail in each of the 28 industries, which we present in Table 5. The frequencies are denoted as fractions and are ranked according to an industry's dominant regime and within the dominant regime on the basis of the highest weighted frequency of occurrence. These frequencies may not necessarily sum up to 1 due to the inconclusiveness of the distance test.  \n\n# <Insert Table 5 about here>  \n\nTable 5 reveals that perfect competition in both product and labor markets is not very common across Chinese manufacturing industries, with an average fraction of occurrence well below 0.10. This confrms expectations as the $P M C-W M P$ regime of competitiveness is often thought to be a philosophical benchmark. The two predominant regimes of competitiveness at the industry level are $P M U$ - WMU and PMU- WMD, with an average fraction of occurrence above 0.90 for the former and about 0.28 for the latter. These predominant regimes indicate that most industries operate under imperfect competition in product and labor markets, they seem to differ mainly in their labor market setting. The large fraction of occurrence of the PMU- WMU regime is compatible with recent evidence on the role of workers’ bargaining power in shaping the wage distribution in China over the period 2000-2007. This, in turn, could be related to risk sharing (Duan and Martins, 2019) or fair wage (Kamal et al., 2015) arguments. Given that many formal labor market institutions (such as collective bargaining, independent trade unions, forms of social protection) are still at a relatively early stage of development, our findings are far less likely explained by effective union bargaining power. Indeed, trade unions are indirectly controlled by the government and China's communist party through their affliation with the single national organization (the All-China Federation of Trade Union, ACFTU). There is, however, evidence on the collective voice role of Chinese unions, including mediating labor disputes, monitoring implementation of the Labor Law and promoting employee training, which is also compatible with our results (Lu et al., 2010; Budd et al., 2014). Confirming expectations, a large fraction of firms that set wage markdowns ( $L M S=W M D$ )are state-owned enterprises (SOEs).  \n\nLet us now discuss the volatility of competitiveness regimes at the industry level. Regime changes at the firm level are determined by comparing the regime of the first year available for firm $i$ with that of the final year available, i.e. $R_{i T}\\mathrm{~-~}R_{i0}$ ，where $T$ and $0$ denote respectively the final and first year available for firm $i$ . The firm-level average changes in regime are aggregated at the industry level. The variation of the average change in regime of competitiveness at the industry level is visualized in Figure 4, where industries are ranked by the number of firms within each industry. Each circle represents an industry, where the center of the circle denotes the average change and the radius corresponds to a measure of variation (standard deviation) of the average change. Table B.3 in Appendix B presents the average change in regime of competitiveness at the industry level and within-industry variation underlying Figure 4.  \n\n# <Insert Figure 4 about here>  \n\nFigure 4 clearly shows that industry size does not have an effect on the average number of regime changes at the industry level. The average change lies just below one, with not much variation across industries. However, there is more variability in the standard deviation of the average change: some industries display a standard deviation just short of two, while others have little to no variation. This within-industry variation could be explained by differential effects of WTO entry on different subgroups within industries, which we examine in the next sections.  \n\n7. Impact of WTO accession on the prevalence of product and labor market imperfections at the firm level  \n\n### 7.1. Descriptive analysis of WTO entry effect  \n\nLet us now turn to discussing time variation in competitiveness regimes in light of China's accession to the WTO at the end of 2001. WTO membership might have exerted positive effects on the Chinese domestic economy. There are various channels through which trade policy changes might impact competition among sellers in goods markets. Input tariff liberalization reduces firms’ marginal costs through lowering input prices or increasing technical (within-firm) efficiency via an increase in access to imported intermediate inputs of higher quality and broader variety. Output tariff liberalization directly exposes firms to intensified import competition through changing the residual demand they face, either through shifting residual demand curves of survivors down, or through increasing the demand elasticity that domestic firms perceive. This direct procompetitive effect causes firms to adjust by lowering price-cost markups. Output tariff liberalization might also exert an indirect effect through hiring better managers or changing the organization structure, thereby reducing X-inefficiencies and increasing within-firm productivity. Which effect dominates, is a priori not clear. Firm $i$ 's price-cost markup $(\\mu_{i t})$ is a principal input in the characterization of its regime of competitiveness: it determines its product market setting and is a component of its joint market imperfections parameter $(\\psi_{i t})$ , which determines its labor market setting. For example, a strong downward pressure on price-cost markups would induce a shifttowardsthe $P M C$ product market setting.  \n\nThe impact of WTO membership on a firm's labor market setting is a priori not clear, either. High-productive (and thus high-profit) firms might be more willing to share rents with their workers according to a surplus-sharing rule and to pay wage markups, yielding an increase in the frequency of $W M U$ -labor market setting occurrences. On the other hand, high-productive (low marginal-cost) frms might expand their market share. Larger firms might be less likely to negotiate and more willing to use wage posting because they can better process the larger pool of applicants created if recruitment technology is better in large firms, or large firms might exert more control over local wages, yielding an increase in the frequency of WMD-labor market setting occurrences.  \n\nTo study these effects in a descriptive way, Table 6 reports the difference-in-differences in weighted frequency of occurrence of each regime compared to the pre-WTO dominant regime of competitiveness at the industry level before WTO entry (years 2000-2001) and after WTO entry (years 2002-2006), i.e.:  \n\n$$\n\\Delta\\left(\\frac{\\sum_{i\\in\\Im}w_{i}\\left[(\\#\\mathrm{~of~occurrences~of~regime~}R)-(\\#\\mathrm{~of~occurrences~of~regime~}\\hat{R})\\right]}{\\sum_{i\\in\\Im}w_{i}}\\right),\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\hat{R}$ denotes the pre- WTO dominant regime. $\\Delta$ denotes the difference operator, defined as the difference between the post-WTO period and pre-WTO period.  \n\nSuch difference-in-differences approach allows us to provide suggestive evidence on the impact of WTO accession on switches in industries’ pre- WTO dominant regime of competitiveness. A large absolute value of the difference-in-differences change of certain regimes would suggest an impact of WTO membership on the regime of competitiveness in which firms/industries operate.16 In order to highlight the importance of observed changes, we mark regimes in Table 6 as follows. \\* marks a regime displaying a difference-in-differences change exceeding 25 percentage points in absolute value, f marks a regime that is more than 10 percentage points apart from the pre-WTO dominant regime prior to WTO entry and less than 10 percentage points apart after WTO entry, + marks a regime that is less than 10 percentage points apart from the pre-WTO dominant regime prior to WTO entry and more than 10 percentage points apart after WTO entry and ^ marks a change in the dominant regime, i.e. a regime different from the pre-WTO dominant regime that has become the dominant regime in the post-WTO period.  \n\nTable 6 reveals little heterogeneity in WTO entry effects across regimes. Only a handful of changes are observed which may have infuenced the identification of the dominant regime after WTO accession.17 Moreover, we only observe for one industry a switch in dominant regime in the post-WTO period, which is consistent with the stability of regimes over time documented in Section 6.2. Focusing on the product market, we find that the most relevant changes are in favor of the imperfectly competitive setting ( $P M U$ .PMU appears to be the dominant product market setting in both the pre-WTO and post-WTO periods. This suggests that the most likely beneficiaries of trade liberalization in the short run are domestic firms that benefit from lower production costs while simultaneously raise price-cost markups. Focusing on the labor market, we mostly observe a strengthening of the pre-WTO labor market setting. As such, we mainly find a consolidation of pre-WTO dominant regimes after WTO accession. Hence, we do not find suggestive evidence for a decline in (factor) price distortions after trade liberalization, i.e. we do not observe a trend towards a perfectly competitive product /labor market setting $(P M C/W M P)$ . Recall that these are market settings in which firms set prices equal to marginal costs/pay real wages equal to the marginal product of labor, and hence, do not exert product /labor market power.  \n\n7.2. Impact of WTO entry on switching away from exerting product /labor market power  \n\nIn order to identify the effect of trade liberalization on the prevalence of market power at the firm level, we perform a switcher analysis. Such analysis aims at estimating the impact of trade liberalization on the likelihood of switching away from an imperfectly competitive product /labor market setting, i.e. switching away from exerting product /labor market power. To do so, we divide firms into stayers and switchers for a specific product/labor market setting. This stayer-switcher distinction allows us to identify the effect of trade liberalization conditional on the pre-WTO product /labor market setting, and, hence, the impact of trade liberalization on the likelihood of switching away from the pre- WTO product/labor market setting in the post-WTO period relative to staying in the pre-WTO product /labor market seting.  \n\nFirms belong to the category of stayers if their pre- and post-WTO product/labor market setting is the same. Firms are categorized as switchers if their pre-WTO product/labor market setting is different from their post-WTO product/labor market setting, where switching behavior is relative to the pre-WTO product/labor market setting. For example, an $W M U$ -switcher is a firm that switches from an WM $U$ -labor market setting in the pre-WTO period to either a WMP- or WMD-labor market setting in the post-WTO period.18  \n\nIdentifying the effect of trade shocks on market power at the firm level requires dealing with the inconclusiveness of the distance test by applying an allocation rule. More specifically, we first select all conclusive cases and the subset of inconclusive cases in which the distance test is inconclusive between either two or three regimes. Such inconclusiveness amounts to 80% of the inconclusive cases.19 Second, if —conditional on this selection— a firm has a dominant product /labor market setting in the pre-WTO period, we assign the dominant product/labor market setting to that inconclusive (hence, missing) product /labor market setting. We define a firm's dominant product /labor market setting in the pre-WTO period based on the highest frequency of occurrence. Our core set of results are robust to not applying such allocation rule.20  \n\nIn our switcher analysis, we apply the allocation rule to the pre- and post- WTO period separately. If the distance test produces inconclusive results in the pre- or post-WTO period, we, hence, assign the product /labor market setting for which we have most evidence.  \n\nWe postulate that firm $i$ 's product market setting at time $t$ might depend on the degree of trade liberalization, other observable characteristics as well as unobservable factors $\\epsilon$ such as managerial ability. Suppressing firm and time subscripts ( $i$ and $t$ , respectively) for simplicity, we thus have:  \n\n$$\nP M S^{*}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}\\mathrm{{input}t a r i f f+\\beta_{2}\\mathrm{{output}t a r i f f+{}}}z^{\\prime}\\beta_{z}+\\epsilon,\n$$  \n\nwhere input tariff and output tariff denote the 1-year lagged values of the policy variables input tariffs and output tariffs, respectively. To control for two ongoing policy reforms in the early 2000s, SOEs reform and relaxation of foreign-direct investment (FDI) regulations, thevector $_{z}$ comprises industry-year varying variables such as the share of state-owned sales and the share of foreign-owned sales in total sales. It also includes a firm's size (number of workers) and a full set of year fixed effects in order to control for macroeconomic shocks common to all firms.  \n\nIn order to investigate the link between the degree of trade liberalization and the likelihood of switching away from imperfect competition in the product market (that is, exerting product market power), we specify the following probit model:  \n\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(P M U\\mathrm{-switch}\\mid x)=\\Phi({\\pmb x}^{\\prime}{\\beta}).\n$$  \n\nThe vector $_{\\mathbf{\\nabla}}\\mathbf{\\phi}_{\\mathbf{{\\alpha}}}$ includes the regressors specified in Eq. (20).  \n\nWhether market power in firm $i$ in period $t$ is consolidated on either the demand side or the supply side of labor might be infuenced by common observable as well as unobservable factors such as a firm's corporate culture. In order to investigate the link between the degree of trade liberalization and the likelihood of switching away from imperfect competition in the labor market (that is, either setting a wage markdown or paying a wage markup), we specify the following univariate probit models:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l c r}{{L M S_{m}^{*}=x_{m}^{\\prime}\\beta_{m}+\\epsilon_{m},}}&{{m=1,2}}\\ {{L M S_{m}=I(L M S_{m}^{*}>0),}}&{{m=1,2}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $L M S_{1}=\\mathbb{P}(\\boldsymbol{W M D\\mathrm{-}s w i t c h}\\mid\\boldsymbol{x})$ and $L M S_{2}=\\mathbb{P}(\\boldsymbol{W M U-s w i t c h}\\mid\\boldsymbol{x})$ .We include the same regressors as in the univariate probit model defined in Eq. (21).  \n\nThe results of this switcher analysis are reported in Table 7. Columns 1, 4 and 7 present the marginal effect of our main regressors on the probability of switching away from the pre-WTO period product/labor market setting relative to staying in the pre-WTO period product/labor market setting in the univariate probit models. More specifically, column 1 reports how much the conditional probability of switching away from $P M S=P M U$ in the post-WTO period relative to staying changes when the value of a regressor changes, holding all other regressors constant whereas column 4 (7) shows how much the likelihood of switching away from $L M S=W M D$ $L M S=W M U$ ) in the post-WTO period relative to staying changes. Accounting for heteroskedasticity and arbitrary autocorrelation, we cluster standard errors at the four-digit industry-year level (level of treatment) for statistical inference and use within-industry and between-industry output share weights in all regressions.  \n\n<Insert Table 7 about here>  \n\nOur main finding is that, in general, trade liberalization via tariff reductions has not exerted a statistically and economically significant effect on shifting the prevalence of firms’ market imperfections, that is, shifting firms away from an imperfectly competitive product or labor market setting relative to staying. This finding is consistent with our descriptive differencein-differences results and indicates that the normality assumption underlying the probit models is not driving our results, as our difference-in-differences approach can be seen as the non-parametric counterpart to this probit analysis.  \n\nThe marginal effects for the product market could be explained by the fact that only a small fraction of firms switches towards perfect competition in the product market. Moreover, only a small fraction of firms at any point in time is characterized by perfect competition in the product market.  \n\nAt first sight, we tend to conclude that trade policy changes via tariff reductions has strongly affected the likelihood that firms shift away from setting wage markdowns. However, these marginal effects are driven by a very specific and small subset of firms (see Section 8). For these firms, a l-percentage-point reduction in tariffs on intermediate inputs decreases the conditional probability of WMD-switch by 20 percentage points while a 1-percentage-point reduction in output tariffs increases the conditional probability of WMD-switch by 9 percentage points. The marginal effects in the last probit model show an economically small negative impact of input tariff cuts on the likelihood of switching away from paying wage markups: a l-percentage-point reduction in tariffs on intermediate inputs decreases the conditional probability of WM $U$ -switch by 3 percentage points.  \n\nTo check robustness, we estimate the average effect of tariff reductions (and other independent variables) on switching away from an imperfectly competitive product /labor market setting in a “representative enterprise'’ (see columns 2, 5 and 8 in Table 7). We also present TSLS estimates in which we use tariff rates from the WTO agreement (predetermined maximum tariff rates) as instruments for actual tariff rates in the post-WTO period to rule out a policy endogeneity concern associated with using nominal tariffs as reflecting the degree of government intervention (see columns 3, 6 and 9 in Table 7). Estimating these linear probability models leads to similar conclusions as estimating the probit models discussed above.  \n\nThere are two main sources that could drive a wedge between output elasticities of labor and intermediate inputs and their respective expenditure shares in revenue: market imperfections and factor adjustment costs. As we abstained from adjustment costs in our theoretical model, we could potentially have biased results in our switcher analysis. However, we use tariff cuts for identification of the effect of trade liberalization on product and labor market settings. Hence, as long as changes in adjustment costs are uncorrelated with changes in tariffs, our results are not affected. Since tariff reductions are considered to be exogenous changes, it is indeed likely that adjustment cost changes are uncorrelated with tariff cuts, which is supported by our TSLS estimates.  \n\n## 8. Impact of WTO accession on the intensity of product and labor market imperfections at the firm level  \n\nIn the previous section, we have investigated the effect of trade liberalization on the prevalence of imperfections in product and labor markets. In particular, we have examined the impact on the probability of switching away from setting price-cost markups, and setting wage markdowns/paying wage markups. From a policy perspective, it is equally important to understand whether trade liberalization in intermediate-inputs and final-goods industries has affected the intensity of product and labor market imperfections. To identify such effects, we estimate the average impact of input and output tariff reductions (and other independent variables) on the magnitude of price-cost markups and the magnitude of wage markdowns/wage markups, conditional on the relevant product /labor market setting.  \n\nIn order to give a structural interpretation of the magnitude of firms’ product and labor market power, we focus in this section on widely-used models of imperfect competition. Consistent with standard models of imperfect competition in the product market, we measure the magnitude of a firm's product market power by its price-cost markup $\\mu_{i t}$ . Consistent with two widely-used models of imperfect competition in the labor market, we measure the magnitude of labor market power either by the wage elasticity of a firm's labor supply curve $(\\varepsilon_{W}^{N})_{i t}$ in the case of wage markdown-pricing or the workers’ bargaining/monopoly power $\\phi_{i t}$ in the case of wage markup-pricing (see Section 2). Both $(\\varepsilon_{W}^{N})_{i t}$ and $\\phi_{i t}$ are transformations of a frm's wage markdown and a firm's wage markup, respectively.2l As such, we define the following regression models:  \n\n$$\n\\ln\\widehat{\\mu}_{i t}=\\alpha_{0}+\\alpha_{1}\\mathrm{input~tariff}_{j t-1}+\\alpha_{2}\\mathrm{output~tariff}_{j t-1}+\\alpha_{3}I M R_{i t}+\\alpha_{i}+z^{\\prime}\\alpha_{z}+\\zeta_{i t},\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\ln(\\widehat{\\varepsilon}_{W}^{N})_{i t}=\\alpha_{0}+\\alpha_{1}\\mathrm{input~tariff}_{j t-1}+\\alpha_{2}\\mathrm{output~tariff}_{j t-1}+\\alpha_{3}I M R_{i t}+\\alpha_{i}+z^{\\prime}\\alpha_{z}+\\zeta_{i t},\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\widehat{\\phi}_{i t}}{1-\\widehat{\\phi}_{i t}}\\right)=\\alpha_{0}+\\alpha_{1}\\mathrm{input~tariff}_{j t-1}+\\alpha_{2}\\mathrm{output~tariff}_{j t-1}+\\alpha_{3}I M R_{i t}+\\alpha_{i}+z^{\\prime}\\alpha_{z}+\\zeta_{i t},\n$$  \n\nwith IMR the inverse Mills ratio from the respective probit model which we include to account for selection bias, $\\alpha_{i}$ firm fixed effects, and the vector $_{z}$ comprising the same regressors as in the switcher analysis. As before, we instrument applied tariffs in the postWTO period with predetermined maximum tariff rates. As the share of rents captured by the workers $\\left(\\phi\\right)$ lies within the $[0,1]$ -range, we use a logit transformation to model the degree of workers′ bargaining power during worker-firm negotiations. As before, one could be worried about the validity of this analysis due to the potential presence of adjustment costs. However, the same argument applies as made in Section 7.2, that is, our results are not biased by ignoring adjustment costs in our theoretical model because tariff reductions are exogenous.  \n\nTable 8 presents the average effect of the regressors in the three regression models. Most importantly, our results provide evidence of trade liberalization in intermediate-inputs industries having affected the intensity of firms’ product versus labor market power differently. Conditional on setting price-cost markups ( $P M S=P M U$ ), we find that a reduction in input tariffs increases the degree of product market power (price-cost markups), as expected. This result is in line with Brandt et al. (2017) who find that cuts in input tariffs raise both price-cost markups and productivity. More specifically, each percentage point decline in tariffs on intermediate inputs increases a firm's price-cost markup by 0.8 percent. Conditional on setting wage markdowns ( $L M S=W M D$ ), we find that a reduction in input tariffs decreases the degree of wage-setting power: each percentage point decline in input tariffs is found to increase a firm's labor supply elasticity by 7.5 percent.  \n\n# <Insert Table 8 about here>  \n\nThe decline in frms’ wage-setting power, conditional on setting wage markdowns, might especially be pronounced in SOEs, as part of the WTO accession conditions was to privatize these SOEs. We confirm this conjecture in Table B.4 in Appendix B: each percentage point decline in input tariffs increases the wage elasticity of the labor supply of a state-owned firm by 13 percent, which is almost twice as large as compared to conditioning on firms that set wage markdowns. When we condition on SOEs that set wage markdowns ( $L M S=W M D$ we find that a percentage point decline in input tariffs increases a firm's labor supply elasticity by 11 percent (see columns 3 and 4 in Table B.4). Hence, the effect of trade liberalization on the wage-setting power of frms is largely driven by SOEs.  \n\nAt first sight, the negative impact of trade liberalization in intermediate-inputs industries on firms’ wage-setting power seems inconsistent with the negative impact found on the probability of switching away from setting wage markdowns (see Section 7.2). As already alluded to in Section 7.2, the subset of firms that switch away from setting wage markdowns might be very different from the average wage-setting firm as we observe only a handful of such switches. Table B.5 in Appendix B confirms that this is indeed the case: the effect of input tariff reductions on the degree of wage-setting power for this very specific (and small) subset of firms is completely opposite to the above documented effect for the average wage-setting firm. This, again, confirms that trade liberalization has not induced frms to switch away from an imperfectly competitive product /labor market setting.  \n\nSo far, our results could potentially capture the impact of trade liberalization on the intensity of market imperfections at the firm level (true trade liberalization effect) as well as on firms′ switching behavior (compositional changes within a particular product /labor market setting). In order to isolate the true impact of trade policy changes on market power, we condition on being a stayer for the relevant product /labor market setting. Table 9 reports the average effect of our regressors of interest for the subsample of stayers and, hence, reveals true trade liberalization effects.  \n\n# <Insert Table 9 about here>  \n\nFrom Table 9, it follows that, in general, the sign and magnitude of the input and output tariff effects are similar to the ones reported in Table 8. This indicates that compositional effects are not driving our results discussed above.  \n\nModeling the dependence between pricing rules in the product market and in the labor market allows us to analyze potential heterogeneous effects of trade liberalization on the intensity of product/labor market power at the firm level. We do so by estimating the impact of trade shocks on the intensity of product market imperfections (price-cost markups) conditional on setting wage markdowns ( $L M S=W M D$ )and by estimating such impact on the intensity of labor market imperfections (wage-setting power) conditional on setting price-cost markups ( $P M S=P M U$ ). The results of these heterogeneous effects are reported in Table 10 and visualized in Figure B.4 in Appendix B.  \n\n# <Insert Table 10 about here>  \n\nComparing Tables 8 and 10 shows that the negative effect of input tariffs on the intensity of product market imperfections is more pronounced for firms that exert labor market power ( $L M S=W M D$ ) than for firms that exert product market power ( $P M S=P M U$ Moreover, besides an effect that runs through the intermediate input channel of trade, we now also observe a small procompetitive effect via output tariff reductions on the magnitude of price-cost markups. Conditional on exerting labor market power ( $L M S=W M D$ ),each percentage point decline in input (output) tariffs is found to increase a firm's price-cost markup by roughly 1 (0.15) percent. Likewise, comparing Tables 8 and 10 reveals that the negative impact of falling input tariffs on firms’ wage-setting power is stronger for firms that have market power in the product market ( $P M S=P M U$ ). We again conclude that compositional effects are not driving these results (see Table B.6 in Appendix B).  \n\n## 9. ( Conclusion  \n\nHow does firms' pricing behavior in product and labor markets respond to domestic trade liberalization? In spite of its importance for understanding the distributional consequences of trade shocks and the underlying sources of increased interfirm wage disparities, this question has not been answered so far. This paper examines the impact of trade liberalization in intermediate-inputs and final-goods industries on the prevalence and intensity of product and labor market power of Chinese manufacturing firms.  \n\nWe generalize the model of De Loecker and Warzynski (2012) for obtaining a measure of firms′ product market power (price-cost markup). Relaxing their standard cost-minimization assumption allows us to consider two polar models of wage formation in imperfect labor markets: one where workers monopoly power forces employers to pay a wage markup and one where firms' monopsony power enables them to set a wage markdown. Our model takes the dependence between pricing rules in product and labor markets explicitly into account.  \n\nWe use production data on Chinese manufacturing firms to estimate the prevalence and intensity of product and labor market power over the period 1999-2006. We then examine whether China's membership to the World Trade Organization in 2001 has affected the product and labor market power of Chinese firms. As such, our application can be considered as a generalization of Brandt et al. (2017) who examine the impact of trade liberalization via input and output tariff reductions on the magnitude of price-cost markups (and productivity) of Chinese firms.  \n\nWe find that trade liberalization has not affected the prevalence of price-cost markups and wage markups/wage markdowns. More specifically, tariff reductions have not switched firms away from exercising product and labor market power. However, trade liberalization has affected the intensity of price-cost markups and wage markdowns. In particular, tariff cuts on intermediate inputs have increased a firm's price-cost markup but decreased the degree of wage-setting power that it possesses, conditional on exercising product/labor market power respectively. In the Chinese context, the narrowing effect of input tariff cuts on wage markdowns can be linked to the fall of wage-setting power of state-owned enterprises, which we confirm.  \n\nBesides disentangling the impact of trade shocks on product and labor market power, another advantage of modeling the dependence between pricing rules in product and labor markets is that we are able to reveal heterogeneous trade liberalization effects on the intensity of firms’ product and labor market power. We show that input tariff reductions have predominantly increased the product market power (price-cost markup) of firms that exercise labor market power (set wage markdowns). Such tariff cuts have predominantly decreased the labor market power (wage-setting power) of firms that exercise product market power (set price-cost markups).  \n\nIn terms of broader implications, we view the joint responses of firms’ pricing behavior in product and labor markets to trade policy changes together with the heterogeneous trade liberalization effects as an important step towards understanding the true consequences of tradeshocks.  \n\n## References  \n\nAckerberg, D.

Defining the distance test  \n\nThe distance test builds upon the earlier work of Niesch (1964, 1966), Perlman (1969), and Gouriéroux et al. (1981, 1982). The latter propose the likelihood ratio, Kuhn-Tucker and Lagrange multiplier tests for nonlinear as well as linear models for hypothesis testing of the following form: $H_{0}$ ： $h(\\pmb\\theta)=\\mathbf0$ , against $\\begin{array}{r}{H_{1}\\colon h(\\pmb{\\theta})}\\end{array}$ $h(\\pmb\\theta)>\\mathbf0$ . They show that the distribution of the different test statistics under the null is a weighted- $\\chi^{2}$ distribution. The main empirical difficulty related to this large-sample hypothesis testing is the derivation of the weights of the weighted- $\\chi^{2}$ distribution.  \n\nLet us introduce some notation in order to define the distance test in formal mathematical terms. Let $\\pmb{\\theta}$ denote a $(p\\times1)$ vector of parameters of interest and let $h(\\pmb\\theta)$ be a continuous function denoting the restrictions on the parameters. Assume $\\pmb{\\theta}$ can be consistently estimated by $\\pmb{\\theta}$ . Let $\\Omega$ denote the variance-covariance matrix of $\\pmb{\\theta}$ , which can be consistently estimated by $\\pmb{\\Omega}$ . Now, transform $\\pmb{\\theta}$ and $\\pmb{\\theta}$ into new parameter vectors as follows (Kodde and Palm, 1984, 1986):  \n\n$$\n\\gamma=N^{\\frac12}h(\\pmb\\theta)\\qquad\\mathrm{and}\\qquad\\bar{\\gamma}=N^{\\frac12}h(\\bar{\\pmb\\theta}),\n$$  \n\nwhere $N$ denotes the sample size.  \n\nThe variance-covariance matrix of $\\gamma$ and $\\gamma$ are  \n\n$$\n\\pmb{\\Sigma}=\\frac{\\partial h(\\pmb\\theta)}{\\partial\\pmb\\theta^{\\prime}}\\Omega\\frac{\\partial h(\\pmb\\theta)^{\\prime}}{\\partial\\pmb\\theta}\\qquad\\mathrm{and}\\qquad\\bar{\\pmb\\Sigma}=\\frac{\\partial h(\\bar{\\pmb\\theta})}{\\partial\\bar{\\pmb\\theta}^{\\prime}}\\bar{\\pmb\\Omega}\\frac{\\partial h(\\bar{\\pmb\\theta})^{\\prime}}{\\partial\\bar{\\pmb\\theta}}.\n$$  \n\nFinally, define the distance function in the metric of $\\pmb{\\Sigma}$ of a vector $\\pmb{\\mu}$ from the origin, as:  \n\n$$\n\\|\\pmb{\\mu}\\|=\\pmb{\\mu}^{\\prime}\\pmb{\\Sigma}^{-1}\\pmb{\\mu}.\n$$  \n\nKodde and Palm (1984, 1986) distinguish five different equality and inequality restrictions, which all slightly alter the definition of the test. To implement our classification procedure, we only need the following three definitions of the test: $(i)$ a standard test for zero under the null, $(i i)$ a test for inequality restrictions under the null, and $(i i i)$ a test for equality and inequality restrictions under the null.  \n\nFirst, if the following equality restrictions are tested $H_{0}\\colon\\gamma=\\mathbf{0}$ against $H_{1}\\colon\\gamma\\neq\\mathbf{0}$ ,the distance test becomes:  \n\n$$\nD=\\left\\|\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}}\\right\\|,\n$$  \n\nwhich is equivalent to the Wald test.  \n\nSecond, the test of inequality restrictions under the null, $H_{0}\\colon\\gamma\\geqslant\\mathbf{0}$ against $H_{1}\\colon\\gamma\\neq\\mathbf{0}$ leads to the following test statistic:  \n\n$$\nD=\\left\\|\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}}-\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}}\\right\\|,\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ is the solution of  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{min}_{\\gamma\\geqslant0}\\quad\\|{\\bar{\\gamma}}-\\gamma\\|,\n$$  \n\nso the distance test equals the minimum of (A.6).  \n\nThird, if one is interested in testing the following hypothesis $H_{0}\\colon\\gamma_{1}=\\mathbf{0}$ $\\gamma_{2}\\geqslant\\mathbf{0}$ against $H_{1}\\colon\\gamma_{1}\\neq\\mathbf{0},\\gamma_{2}\\neq\\mathbf{0}$ , the distance test takes the following form:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{D=\\Vert\\bar{\\gamma}-\\tilde{\\gamma}\\Vert=\\left(\\bar{\\gamma}_{2}-\\tilde{\\gamma}_{2}-\\Sigma_{21}\\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\\bar{\\gamma}_{1}\\right)^{\\prime}\\left(\\Sigma_{22}-\\Sigma_{21}\\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\\Sigma_{12}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\bar{\\gamma}_{2}-\\tilde{\\gamma}_{2}-\\Sigma_{21}\\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\\bar{\\gamma}_{1}\\right)}\\ &{\\qquad+\\bar{\\gamma}_{1}^{\\prime}\\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\\bar{\\gamma}_{1},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\tilde{\\gamma}_{2}$ is the solution of the program:  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{min}_{\\gamma_{2}\\geqslant0}\\quad\\left(\\bar{\\gamma}_{2}-\\gamma_{2}-\\Sigma_{21}\\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\\bar{\\gamma}_{1}\\right)^{\\prime}\\left(\\Sigma_{22}-\\Sigma_{21}\\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\\Sigma_{12}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\bar{\\gamma}_{2}-\\gamma_{2}-\\Sigma_{21}\\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\\bar{\\gamma}_{1}\\right).\n$$  \n\nEqs. (A.6) and (A.8) can be solved by standard quadratic programming techniques (see Beale, 1955; Wolfe, 1959).  \n\nLet us now discuss the distribution of the different forms of the distance test. As mentioned earlier, the distance test follows in general a weighted- $\\chi^{2}$ distributionbut these distributions slightly differ across hypotheses. The different hypotheses and their respective distributions are discussed in the same order as above.  \n\nFirst, $H_{0}\\colon\\mathbf{\\Gamma}\\gamma=\\mathbf{0}$ against $H_{1}$ $\\gamma\\neq{\\bf0}$ boils down to the well-known Wald test, which is $\\chi^{2}(p)$ distributed, with $p$ degrees of freedom (the number of restrictions).  \n\nSecond, for the problem of testing $H_{0}$ ： $\\gamma\\geqslant0$ against $H_{1}\\colon\\gamma\\neq\\mathbf{0}$ , the distribution of $D$ under $H_{0}$ is given by  \n\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\boldsymbol{D}\\geqslant c\\left|\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\right>\\right)=\\sum_{i=0}^{p}\\mathbb{P}(\\chi^{2}(p-i)\\geqslant c)\\boldsymbol{w}(p,i,\\Sigma),\n$$  \n\nwhere $w(p,i,\\pmb{\\Sigma})$ denotes the probability that $i$ of the $p$ elements of $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ are strictly positive.  \n\nThird, for the problem of $H_{0}\\colon\\gamma_{1}=\\mathbf{0},\\gamma_{2}\\geqslant\\mathbf{0}$ against $H_{1}$ $\\gamma_{1}\\neq\\mathbf{0}$ ， $\\gamma_{2}\\neq\\mathbf{0}$ , the test statistic follows the distribution  \n\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}\\left(D\\geqslant c\\mid\\Sigma\\right)=\\sum_{i=0}^{p-q}\\mathbb{P}(\\chi^{2}(p-i)\\geqslant c)w(p-q,i,\\Sigma_{22}-\\Sigma_{21}\\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\\Sigma_{12}),\n$$  \n\nwhere $w(p-q,i,\\Sigma_{22}-\\Sigma_{21}\\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\\Sigma_{12})$ denotes the probability that $i$ of the $p-q$ elements of $\\tilde{\\gamma}_{2}$ are strictly positive, with $q$ the number of equality restrictions and the variance-covariance matrix set equal to the conditional variance-covariance matrix of $\\bar{\\gamma}_{2}$ given $\\bar{\\gamma}_{1}$  \n\n### A.2. Weights in the distribution of the distance test  \n\nThe weights in the weighted- $\\chi^{2}$ distribution are the probability content of obtaining a fixed number of positive elements in the solution of the quadratic programming problems. Since the quadratic programming problems differ across hypotheses, so do the weights $w$ The weights $w$ are a function of (i) $m$ the number of elements of $\\xi,(i i)$ $k$ the number of strictly positive values of $\\xi$ , and $(i i i)\\Delta$ the variance-covariance matrix of $\\xi$ , such that $w(m,k,\\Delta)$ .Here $\\xi$ denotes the solution to one of the quadratic programming problems (A.6) or (A.8), i.e. $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ or $\\tilde{\\gamma}_{2}$ , depending on the hypothesis. The number of combinations of zero and strictly positive values of $\\xi$ is $2^{r n}$ , so it scales exponentially in the number of components of $\\xi$  \n\nDifferent methods to determine the weights are present in the literature of inequality constraint testing. These different methods consist of $(i)$ closed-form solutions, (ii) numerical approximation algorithms, $(i i i)$ Monte Carlo simulation techniques, (iv) upper and lower bound approximations, $(v)$ statistical properties, and $(v i)$ binomial distribution approximation. Closed-form solutions are derived by Kudo (1963), Shapiro (1985), Wolak (1987), and Shapiro (1988). Since the determination of closed-form solutions of the weights can be complex for a large number of elements $m$ , multiple approximation approaches are developed. Numerical approximation methods are given by Siskind (1976), Bohrer and Chow (1978), Robertson and Wright (1983), and Robertson et al. (1988). Monte Carlo simulation techniques are proposed by Gouriéroux et al. (1982), Wolak (1987), Silvapulle (1996), Dardanoni and Forcina (1998), and Silvapulle and Sen (2011). The upper and lower bound approximation of Kodde and Palm (1984, 1986) circumvents the problem of determining the weights by approximating the critical values directly. In addition to the upper and lower bound approximation, Kodde and Palm (1984, 1986) derive a method to determine the weights using their statistical properties. Gouriéroux et al. (1982) propose the binomial distribution approximation to be a simple and fast approximation technique.  \n\nThe general method of Kodde and Palm (1984, 1986) for calculating the weights can be used for cases $m\\geqslant4$ , but entails the disadvantage that it scales exponentially in the number of components of $\\xi$ . Monte Carlo simulation techniques may provide a solution as they do not have the caveat of scaling exponentially in $m$ but such techniques do not produce exact weights. The binomial approximation of Gouriéroux et al. (1982) greatly reduces the numerical problems of obtaining the weights. Lower and upper bounds (Kodde and Palm, 1984, 1986) may not be sufficient for every real-world application and are therefore not considered. A simulation study was performed to assess the performance of different approximation methods, namely $(i)$ a Monte Carlo simulation technique and $(i i)$ a binomial approximation. The objective of such comparison is to identify robustness and reliability of the approximation methods. This serves the purpose of encouraging the empirical applicability of the distance test, as it has a wide usage in applied economic research. We find that both approximation methods provide adequate to very accurate approximations of the true weights, while being computationally less demanding compared to computing the exact weights (results not reported but available upon request). In this paper, we focus on computing the exact weights, as $m$ stays relatively small.  \n\n## Appendix B: Additional tables and figures  \n\nTable B.1: Panel structure   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td># of Participations?</td><td># Obs.</td><td>%</td><td># Firms</td><td>%</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>82,536</td><td>26.14</td><td>20,634</td><td>35.84</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>67,720</td><td>21.45</td><td>13,544</td><td>23.52</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>52,476</td><td>16.62</td><td>8,746</td><td>15.19</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>29,834</td><td>9.45</td><td>4,262</td><td>7.40</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>83,128</td><td>26.33</td><td>10,391</td><td>18.05</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>315,694</td><td>100.00</td><td>57,577</td><td>100.00</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: aMedian number of observations per firm: 5.  \n\nTable B.2: Industry composition   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>IND</td><td>Industry</td><td># Firms</td><td># Obs</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Food Proc.</td><td>2,059</td><td>10,959</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Food</td><td>1,080</td><td>5,989</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Bev. & Tob.</td><td>714</td><td>4,034</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Textile</td><td>5,861</td><td>31,572</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Wear</td><td>3,037</td><td>16,176</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Leather</td><td>1,529</td><td>8,055</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Wood</td><td>804</td><td>4,167</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Furniture</td><td>635</td><td>3,298</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Paper</td><td>2,085</td><td>11,577</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Printing</td><td>1,158</td><td>6,630</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Petroleum</td><td>256</td><td>1,419</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Chemicals</td><td>4,091</td><td>23,103</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Pharma.</td><td>1,123</td><td>6,449</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Chem.

At least above the legal floor on workers' rights and labor standards, employees with little bargaining power will have lower wages and benefits, less opportunity for advancement, less life-friendly schedules, less job security and physical safety, less privacy and freedom from intrusion both on and off the job, and greater vulnerability to abuse.1 Even where those matters are legally regulated, employees with little bargaining power may feel compelled to tolerate violations of their rights—dangerous working conditions, discriminatory harassment, or demands for off-the-clock work. Many workers, especially those without higher education or advanced skills, find themselves in just that position most of the time.  \n\nAt one level this is all rather obvious, even self-evident, to most non-economists. Indeed, the proposition that workers generally suffer from a lack of bargaining power is an official premise of the National Labor Relations Act2 (NLRA), which aims to redress the “inequality of bargaining power between employees who do not possess full freedom of association or actual liberty of contract, and employers who are organized in the corporate or other forms of ownership association.\"3  \n\nAfter the 1970s, however, “inequality of bargaining power\" largely ceased to be taken seriously as a premise for policymaking in the labor field.4 In part, that was because the phrase was sometimes misunderstood or misused. It might seem to imply an ideal of equal bargaining power that is fictional—and certainly not what workers manage to achieve by organizing and bargaining under the NLRA. The phrase “inequality of bargaining power\" might also seem to imply a naive conception of bargaining-individual give-and-take over specific terms—that is also fictional for most workers. Even workers who face a \"take it or leave it\" package of terms and conditions might be able to just leave it and look for better terms elsewhere. Workers with labor market power can use it by shopping around for a better job without ever engaging in actual bargaining. In the hope of avoiding some of those misunderstandings, I will use the term “labor market power.\"5  \n\nThe notion of unequal bargaining power also lost traction because it was sometimes stated in overly categorical terms, whether by proponents or critics who would discredit the idea. The proposition that all workers always lack bargaining power vis- $\\grave{\\mathrm{a}}$ -vis employers—or for that matter that any workers have zero bargaining power—is a straw man, easily toppled by pointing to workers with scarce, in demand skills or to periods of relative labor scarcity. At some times and places, even less-skilled workers may have meaningful bargaining power, as in the recent late-COVID period.  \n\nIn short, workers' labor market power is variable, contingent, and not easily measured. Even so, it is a real thing, and workers can have more or less ofit, as scholars from a variety of disciplines are recognizing.6  \n\nIncumbent employees’ market power on the job depends largely on how costly their departure, whether by quit or  \n\n6.See Lawrence Mishel, The Goliath in the Room: How the False Assumption of Equal Worker-Employer Power Undercuts Workplace Protections,3 J.L.& PoL.EcoN. (SPECIAL IsSUE) (2022) 4. This entire special issue explores unequal bargaining power, its determinants, and its consequences. See also Hafiz, supra note 3, at 688-97 (2021) (surveying contemporary interdisciplinary scholarship on the determinants of workers' versus employers'bargainingpower).  \n\ndismissal, would be both to their employer and to themselves. Employees have more market power when they can more readily find a comparable job and when their departure would be more costly to their employer, considering both replacement costs and any liabilities or dispute-resolution costs in case of dismissal. (Obviously both sides of the equation depend on the demand for and supply of those skills.) We might then say that workers lack market power relative to employers if most workers in most labor market conditions would find it harder or more costly to replace one job with another than employers would find it to replace one worker with another. 7 And if that's so, then changes in the economy and labor markets can degrade workers' labor market power over time by making it either harder for workers to switch or replace their jobs or easier for employers to replace workers.  \n\nThe dificulties workers face in switching jobs or employers especially workers with sector-specific skills—are related to problems of employer monopsony and growing concentration of product markets that are drawing greater scholarly attention lately.8 Here I focus instead on the opposite side of the equation: the proliferation of employment-avoidance or employee-replacement options for employers, which I will argue is an underappreciated factor in depressing market power for many workers without scarce skills.  \n\nPart I describes trends in the organization and technology of work that are making it easier for private sector employers to replace employees either with other workers or with machines, and that are undermining workers’ labor market power. Part II briefly takes up the question of whether it makes sense to recalibrate the balance of labor market power by constraining employee-replacement options. Part IHI describes how current U.S labor and employment law does and doesn't constrain employeereplacement options. Finally, Part IV briefly takes up some alternative policy options in this space, along with some empirical evidence of their likely economic effects.  \n\n## 1. FISSURING, AUTOMATION, AND THE PROLIFERATION OF EMPLOYEE REPLACEMENT OPTIONS  \n\nSome of the most important labor market trends in recent decades effectively expand firms' ability to avoid employment relationships and to replace their own employees either with machines (through automation) or with other workers (through fissuring). The growing availability of employee-replacement and employment-avoidance strategies, taken together, almost certainly contributes to workers' shrinking market power, labor's declining share of income, and growing economic inequality.9 I approach these issues not from the perspective or with the toolbox of a labor economist, but as a scholar of the law of work. Lacking the tools to test this proposition empirically, I'll state it as a hypothesis and hope to persuade readers of its plausibility.  \n\n### A. Fissuring as a Form of “Employee Replacement\"  \n\nLet's start our story in the middle of the twentieth century, when the big branded corporations that reigned at the top of the economy—like AT&T, IBM, and the “Generals\" (General Motors, General Mills, General Foods)—relied on their own employees to supply the great bulk of their labor needs, from manufacturing and maintenance on up to the C-suite.1o Those firms maintained internal labor markets in which even the least skilled workers had relatively high wages, good benefits, promotion opportunities, and formal or informal job security. That was due to some combination of unions where they existed, efforts to avoid unions where they didn't, and the need to attract and keep good workers and maintain a modicum of internal equity and organizational cohesion.  \n\nSince the 1970s, those big firms and their successors have been systematically shedding workers and labor functions—especially manufacturing, maintenance, logistics, cleaning, and security—and contracting them out to other entities.11 Outsourcing is not new, but it has metastasized in recent decades and has earned the new name of fissuring, bestowed by Professor David Weil.12 Weil has shown that fissuring often leaves workers worse off—without the decent wages, generous benefits, and paths to advancement that their predecessors enjoyed inside lead firms.13 That is partly because intense cost-based competition among supplier firms squeezes profit margins and sharpens the incentive to cut corners and costs, leading to lower wages and widespread labor violations. Many supplier firms also have little physical, financial, or reputational capital to lose in case they break the law or become insolvent. Fissuring allows lead firms to reduce costs and shed or avoid collective bargaining obligations while insulating themselves from the stench of the lawless practices that sometimes underlie those lower costs.  \n\nFissuring includes not only domestic outsourcing but also offshoring of jobs to overseas suppliers (think China) and splintering of jobs into“gigs\" that are or purport to be beyond the employment nexus (think Uber). The cost savings from offshoring stem partly from much lower wages and weak regulatory institutions and trade unions in these poorer countries, and partly from the same forces that operate among domestic suppliers: cost-based competition in a concentrated low-profit environment. As for the gig economy and the platform-based model that Uber exemplifies, those are high-profile aspects of the larger trend toward outsourcing work to putative independent contractors and eliminating both the legal burdens of employer status and the corresponding employee protections.  \n\nFissuring in all its varieties replaces employees with other workers who are usually in a weaker market position—whether because of their relative isolation within a lower-profit sector of the economy, their location in a poorer or less regulated jurisdiction, or their legal status within the jurisdiction (as with independent contractors or undocumented immigrants). Fissuring contributes to economic inequality partly by increasing interfirm stratification. Intrafirm inequality is alive and well, as seen in the yawning ratio between CEO pay and median worker pay at the same firm—on average, 0ver 350 to 1 among the 350 largest U.S. companies in 2020.14 (That ratio would be even higher but for the outsourcing of lower-wage, labor-intensive functions.) But a growing element of overall economic inequality is interfirm disparities between profitable branded firms, with their relatively cosseted employees (think Google), and the lower-profit supplier firms that employ most low-wage workers.15  \n\nAlongside fissuring, other employee-replacement strategies also replace one group of employees with another at a lower economic tier. Replacing full-time employees with part-time or temporary workers—even if the latter are employed within the same firm—may similarly degrade labor conditions and undermine labor protections and labor market power, given lower labor standards for nonstandard employment.16 So, too, with a single firm's relocation of operations to a less worker- and union-friendly jurisdiction.i7 During the epic drama of deindustrialization in the 1970s and beyond, industrial jobs flowed from the industrial North and Midwest to Mexico and China as well as to the U.S. South—a lower-wage region and a bastion of so-called “rightto-work\" laws.18 Those moves undercut hard-won union gains, often very much by design. But for present purposes, the union avoidance motives behind these relocation decisions should not overshadow their employee-replacement effect.  \n\nFinally, we should not overlook the most blatant use of employee replacement to undercut unionized employees’ market power: employers’ permanent replacement of lawful economic strikers.19 U.S labor law's recognition of that employer prerogative, which dates from 1938, sets the United States apart from nearly all advanced industrial democracies.20 Employers? growing propensity since the 1970s to use or threaten permanent replacements in case of a strike has contributed not only to the virtual demise of the strike in private sector collective bargaining disputes21 but also to the difficulty of union organizing: during representation campaigns, employers often tout their willingness and ability to permanently replace strikers to raise employee fears of job loss and deflate beliefs about what can be achieved in collective bargaining.22  \n\nAs with the ability to permanently replace strikers, a crucial feature of employee-replacement options generally—whether internal or external, domestic or transnational—is that they tend to undercut workers' market power even if they are not exercised. That is, a firm's realistic option to replace a given group of employees—whether by relocating, converting full-time jobs into part-time jobs, contracting out work to domestic or overseas suppliers or individual contractors, or replacing strikers—will tend to dampen the market power of incumbent employees even if it remains just an option. This “replacement-threat effect\" roughly mirrors the “union-threat effect\" by which nonunion firms may be induced to improve wages and working conditions by their workers' potential ability to organize a union. In both cases, the potency of the threat varies from sector to sector and across time and circumstances: the easier it is to exercise the option—for the firm to replace employees or for the workers to unionizethe bigger the impact on the other side's ability to demand more favorable terms.23  \n\nThe labor market impact of employee-replacement options parallels that of higher unemployment levels on the price of labor. Both expand the supply of labor with which workers compete. Workers with skills that are in ample supply on the external labor market, like most workers in times of high unemployment, have less market power—they are what economists call “price takers\"—because they are relatively interchangeable with other available job candidates. Similarly, the easier and cheaper it is for a firm to replace employees through outsourcing or relocation to a cheaper location, the less market power those replaceable employees have. That is, both the wider availability of employeereplacement options and higher levels of unemployment depress workers? market power by enhancing employers' ability to replace current employees. The latter has a cyclical dimension (even if it also reflects deliberate policy choices24); the former is more of a secular trend. In both cases the impact is mediated by skill level: workers with scarce skills will be harder to replace at any given level of unemployment, whether by hiring a new employee or by contracting out or relocating work. Not surprisingly, the impact of employee-replacement strategies is greatest for workers who lack advanced education or training.  \n\nIt is worth noting that technology has facilitated nearly every aspect of fissuring, from outsourcing to poorer countries to the growth of platform work, by lowering the transaction costs associated with firms’ explicit contracting for goods and services— that is, the cost of “buying” versus “making” necessary inputs.25 Technology enables lead firms to break down products and processes into component parts, to set precise standards and specifications by contract, and to monitor performance and outputs of outside suppliers.26 Technology in the form of container ships and barcoding allows Walmart to reliably track goods from a factory in Shenzhen, China, to a store in Lexington, Kentucky.27 Technology allows Apple to maintain scrupulous quality standards for its iPhones and iPads while tapping into the much cheaper Chinese labor market. And technology enables Uber to monitor drivers, connect them with customers, and capture a large share of the fares they generate, without directly supervising them.28 Technology has greatly expanded firms’ alternatives to direct employment through fissuring. Then, of course, there is automation.29  \n\n### B. The Automation Effect  \n\nPredictions of a jobless future have recurred in waves throughout the history of capitalism only to crest and retreat as new jobs—usually better jobs—have replaced those lost to machines. But the pace and distinctive nature of the latest wave of innovations in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics led many contemporary observers—and led me in my own recent dive into debates over automation—to believe that this time may be different.3o With advances in both hard and soft forms of technology—robots and algorithms, for example—machines are replicating a wider range of human capabilities and weaving together those distinct capabilities more seamlessly than ever before. The very terms “artificial intelligence” and “machine learning\" hint at what is new: technology is acquiring and refining cognitive and sensory capabilities that had long been thought to be uniquely human. As machines replicate and surpass an ever-wider range of human capabilities, and as they outpace and outperform humans at increasingly complex tasks, they put a growing range of jobs at risk.31  \n\nThat's only half the picture, of course. Machines not only destroy jobs but also create new jobs—especially skilled jobs working with technology. The history of automation's impact on the labor market has been one of “creative destruction.\"32 Of course, job losses may be devastating to workers and their families and communities even if the losses are numerically offset by new job opportunities elsewhere in the economy. Apart from geographic mismatches between jobs lost and jobs gained, those displaced by automation might have neither the skills needed in new jobs nor a realistic shot at acquiring those skills. More to the point here: workers whose jobs could be automated face another kind of employee-replacement option, the mere existence of which reduces their labor market power—again, even if the jobs are not yet automated or if other jobs are being created elsewhere.  \n\nSo creative destruction is not an altogether reassuring prognosis for those whose jobs are at risk of destruction through automation. If the result is greater productivity and prosperity, as in the past, then the challenge would be to manage and mitigate the temporary dislocations and spread the gains. But some economists who study the impact of automation on labor markets are persuaded that this time is indeed different, and not in a good way. The current wave of automation is already producing a more polarized labor market with declining wages and job quality for many workers.33 So concluded a star-studded MIT task force led by Professor David Autor in 2019:  \n\nUnlike the era of equitable growth that preceded it, the digital era has catalyzed labor-market polarization—that is the simultaneous growth of high-education, high-wage and loweducation, low-wage jobs at the expense of middle-skill jobs ... This lopsided growth has concentrated labor market rewards among the most skilled and highly-educated workers while devaluing much of the non-specialized work that remains. This imbalance contributes to the vast divergence of earnings between college- and noncollege-educated workers in recent decades.34  \n\nThe MIT task force found, in short, that automation was already destroying more decent middle-skill jobs than it was creatingthat it was hollowing out the labor market.35 Harvard economist Richard Freeman similarly noted that, as robots become better and cheaper substitutes for human labor, “the net impact . . . will be to shift work from humans to the robots, reducing employment and pressuring wages downward in jobs where machines can do the work of humans at lower costs.\"36  \n\nTechnology is thus contributing to inequality within the labor market and to the shift of income from labor toward capital.37 Professor Daron Acemoglu and his colleagues suggested that “automation may have been the most important factor boosting inequality in the U.S. labor market\" in recent decades.38 They estimated that $50-70\\%$ of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades are due to the “relative wage declines of worker[s] . . . specialized in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation.\"39  \n\nThese diagnoses of the impact of automation are troubling even if job shortages and falling wages for ordinary workers coexist with high demand and rising wages for some skilled workers. They portend a growing chasm over time between most workers and those at the top who own or produce the new technology, or whose high-end skills are complemented by that technology. Most workers may be stuck competing for the shrinking range of lowor middle-skill jobs that humans can still do better or more cheaply than machines but that many humans can also do without advanced training or higher education. In short, the proliferation and growing cost-effectiveness of technological substitutes for labor translates into another powerful employeereplacement strategy that undermines workers’ market power even before they are actually displaced.  \n\nAutomation is thus part of a larger menu of options by which owners and managers of capital can secure needed inputs without directly employing people. If robots or algorithms can supply those inputs more reliably or more cheaply than employees or outside contractors, then firms will turn to robots and algorithms instead of human labor. As investment banker Steven Berkenfeld put it, CEOs these days ask, “Can I automate it? If not, can I outsource it? If not, can I give it to an independent contractor?\"4o Indeed, “some [CEOs] . . . will do anything possible, they'll explore all other alternatives so as not to hire another full-time employee.\"4i The alternatives are ever more abundant. And that depresses the labor market power of the workers for whom fissuring or automation provides a ready substitute.  \n\n## II. SHOULD THE LAW CONSTRAIN EMPLOYEE-REPLACEMENT OPTIONS TO REBALANCE BARGAINING POWER? A FIRST CUT AT THE QUESTION  \n\nSo we can reframe many of the trends that are depressing workers’ market power as a proliferation of employeereplacement or employment-avoidance options. That brings us to the question of what, if anything, the law should do about that. After all, the various tools in the employee-replacement toolbox are at one level unexceptionable techniques for lowering costs and improving performance, productivity, and efficiency. They are part of the mechanics of creative destruction by which less productive or higher-cost firms and business models give way to more innovative and productive ones. To be sure, techniques of fissuring or automation may reflect regulatory arbitrage or other less salutary aims, or they may be “so-so technologies\" that replace workers with little productivity gain.42 But these techniques often do produce gains—mostly by reducing costs of production—that accrue to the economy as a whole. Curbing these employeereplacement techniques might curtail not only their destructive impact but also their creative impact as well.  \n\nPolicy makers have wrestled with this dilemma openly in the context of trade policies and have largely settled on coupling freer trade with more or less (and usually less) robust commitments to cushioning the impact on displaced workers through “trade adjustment assistance\" or the like.43 That is the kind of compromise typically favored by economists-at least when they acknowledge that there are indeed losers from freer trade.44 Free trade policies have been crucial in the transnational dimension of fissuring by enabling firms to offshore production and to develop extended transnational supply chains. There, too, policy makers have taken a hands-off posture, letting lead firms reap the gains from offshoring on the assumption that the economy as a whole will benefit and that some of the gains might eventually accrue to those who are, at least in the short run, on the losing end. As for who's been on the losing end of globalization, it's been mostly the once-prosperous industrial workers of the rich world and their would-be successors.45 (One complication is that some of the winners from globalization have been among the poorest humans on the planet.46)  \n\nPolicies that facilitate transnational trade and fissured production reflect many economists’ general predisposition toward unfettering managers and market mechanisms in pursuit of aggregate gains, and either ignoring the distributional impact or mitigating it through tax-and-transfer mechanisms.47 Though dissenting views may be gaining ground,48 economists who do worry about distributional outcomes have tended to favor redistributive over predistributive policy interventions, and to oppose regulating in the interest of fairer distributional outcomes.49 Yet the latter is what I want to defend here.  \n\nMuch of the law of work—and especially much of collective labor law—aims to achieve fairer distributional outcomes through regulatory interventions into labor and employment relations. That is an explicit aim of the NLRA's regime of collective labor relations, as I've noted,50 and it is equally evident in laws establishing minimum wages and other terms and conditions of employment. Beginning in the 1980s, a barrage of economically inspired critiques oflabor and employment law argued that it was socially counterproductive (because it distorted otherwiseefficient markets for labor and commodities) and self-defeating (because employers would deploy their residual market freedom in ways that hurt workers—for example, by cutting jobs or wages).5i Part of that body of criticism set out to debunk the assumption of inequality of bargaining power that ran through the defense of much of the law of work. (Professor Richard Epstein, for example, attacked that assumption in part by arguing that employers as well as employees bore costs in case of termination, given the costs associated with replacing workers.52 Of course, that implies that market power shifts toward employers insofar as changing labor market conditions make it cheaper to replace workers.)  \n\nI agree with those who see a vital role for predistribution regulatory interventions (as well as redistributive taxes and transfers). For one thing, the polarized politics of redistribution often thwart the tax-and-transfer alternative.53 Moreover, not all that is lost by the losers can be compensated by redistributive transfers.54 Recall the manifold ways that depressed market power can disable workers from claiming legal rights and resisting abuse. Redistributing market power at the front end can benefit workers in ways that redistributing income at the back end cannot.  \n\nWe'll need to return to these questions once we take a closer look at what the law might do to constrain firms' ability to replace employees and thereby bolster employees’ relative bargaining power. In particular, we'll have to take into account the hydraulics of regulating labor markets and employment relations. Closing off or impeding one cost-saving strategy might lead firms to seek out others that are worse for workers or harder to regulate.55 Similarly, strongly protecting incumbent job holders from replacement can depress the labor market prospects of job aspirants, especially new entrants on the market. Those unintended consequences are not as inexorable as they are often portrayed to be and shouldn't necessarily rule out distributionally conscious regulatory solutions. But neither should they be ignored by those focused on improving outcomes for workers.  \n\n## III. HOW CURRENT U.S. LAW REGULATES EMPLOYEEREPLACEMENT OPTIONS  \n\nBefore turning to possible reforms, let us look briefly at how the U.S. law of work currently regulates employee-replacement options. We can readily imagine several regulatory strategies for constraining employee-replacement techniques (without outright banning any of them): the law could interpose procedural duties of notice, consultation, or bargaining with affected employees or their representatives before replacing them; it could condemn certain motives for replacing or displacing employees; or it could require some level of justification for such decisions, with procedures for judicial or administrative review. Each of those three types of constraints could be imposed on decisions displacing either individuals or groups of employees. The law could also defeat the employment-avoidance aims of some fissuring options by looking through formalities and treating putative independent contractors as employees or treating a contractor's workers as the lead firms' employees for some legal purposes. As it turns out, the U.S. law of work already does several of these things to some degree.  \n\nA. Motive-Based Restraints on Dismissal, Managerial Discretion, and Employment at Will  \n\nWe must first recognize that everything in the U.S. law of work operates against the background of a presumption of deference to managerial prerogatives.56 To some degree those prerogatives are hardwired into an economy based on private ownership of productive organizations. Yet the degree of deference to managerial prerogatives in the United States is virtually unique in the developed world. That is seen most clearly in the prevailing presumption of employment at will: absent an agreement granting job security (like a union contract with a “just cause” requirement), employees can lawfully be fired, laid off, or replaced at any time without any reason.57 The United States stands virtually alone in the developed world in failing to require any justification for dismissals or layoffs from employment. Back in the day before the New Deal advent of modern employment law-the law tolerated dismissals for any reason good, bad, or ugly; and the federal Constitution of the Lochner Era rejected any legislative limits on employment at will.58  \n\nModern U.S. employment law still allows dismissal without a demonstrably good reason, but it condemns many bad motives for dismissal—discrimination because of race, sex, age or other status or identity traits, or because of union activity, whistleblowing, or other socially valued and protected activity. Still, all of the motive-based exceptions to employment at will require fired employees (or the government on their behalf) to bear the burden of proving the employer's unlawful motivewhich the employer has means, motive, and opportunity to conceal—through the rigors of litigation.59 And that is where litigation has not been foreclosed by a mandatory arbitration “agreement,” the prevalence of which has exploded in recent years.6o Given the obstacles to successful litigation and the unfavorable terrain of employment arbitration, most employees who believe they have been wrongfully discharged are unable to get an attorney to represent them.61 That is what wrongful discharge law amounts to in an at-will world.  \n\nEmployment at will, even with its modern exceptions, makes it easier and cheaper to dismiss most workers,62 and thus depresses the market power of employees who are replaceable whether by a new hire, by outsourcing, or by machines—and who would have difficulty replacing their jobs. More concretely, employment at will renders workers less able to push back against abusive treatment,to seek better conditions than the law requires, or even to demand compliance with the law. The U.S. baseline of employment at will also reflects a more general posture of deference to managerial prerogatives that shapes other constraints on employee-replacement decisions.  \n\n### B. The NLRA's Duty to Bargain and Prohibition of Antiunion Discrimination  \n\nConsider, for example, the NLRA, which regulates many decisions that displace workers—from individual dismissals and layoffs to subcontracting, relocation, or closure of operations. Collective bargaining agreements reached within that legal framework also regulate those decisions by requiring just cause for dismissal and regulating the order of layoffs (usually by seniority).63 They can, but usually don't, regulate subcontracting, outsourcing, or the like. Those are just some of the ways that collective bargaining can enhance workers' labor market power. But I'll focus here less on the “law of the shop\" than on the law of the land: the NLRA's framework for union organizing and collective bargaining.  \n\nEmployer decisions that displace workers-from a total or partial closing to subcontracting or relocation of work—might be challenged under the NLRA on two grounds: (1) as discriminatory, or unlawfully motivated by antiunion sentiment or, (2) if undertaken unilaterally by management vis- $\\grave{\\mathrm{a}}$ visunionrepresented workers, as a refusal to bargain in good faith with that union. Antiunion discrimination and refusal to bargain in good faith are both “unfair labor practices” that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is charged with adjudicating and remedying—including by restoring the status quo ante where that is not “unduly burdensome.\"64  \n\nThe Supreme Court has injected into these doctrines a large dose of deference to managerial prerogatives (though less of it than employers crave). Roughly speaking, the bigger the impact of a decision on the scope or nature of the employer's enterprise, the harder it is to prove antiunion discrimination, and the less likely the employer will be required to bargain over the decision. (A unionized employer must bargain in any case over the effects of all these decisions--potential transfer rights or severance payments, for example.65) At one extreme, the existential decision to cease being an employer by closing one's entire business is legally unchallengeable under the NLRA on either ground.66 Partial closing decisions are also categorically exempt from the duty to bargain67 and are very hard to challenge as discriminatory. Such decisions—even if they are plainly triggered by union organizing at the closed facility—are unlawfully discriminatory under the NLRA only if they aim to, and foreseeably could, chill union activity by other employees in the employer's remaining operations.68  \n\nBy contrast, subcontracting and relocation decisions that do not alter the basic scope of the enterprise are more likely to be subject to the duty to bargain under case-specific balancing tests, and are somewhat easier to challenge as discriminatory based on proof of antiunion animus or a union-avoidance motive.69 Similarly, decisions to automate work, like subcontracting decisions, are “to be considered on their particular facts,\"7o and can be subject to the duty to bargain if they don't alter “the scope and direction of the enterprise.\"'7i That means that the greater the capital investment, and often the more jobs that are eliminated, the more likely it is that such decisions will be exempt from the duty to bargain.72 (Bargaining over effects will still be required.) Decisions to automate work can also be challenged as discriminatory under the NLRA if motivated by the displaced employees' union activity.73  \n\nThe prohibition on antiunion discrimination and the duty to bargain are nontrivial constraints on firms’ efforts to replace incumbent employees with subcontractors, workers at another location, or machines. But those legal constraints are confined to the relatively few workplaces in which workers are either represented by a union or engaged in union organizing. Even within that domain, a firm can avoid discrimination by acting on demonstrable business- and cost-based grounds (putting aside the enduring puzzle of how to untangle antiunion animus from the higher expected labor costs that partly underlie that animus). As for the duty to bargain, it entails no duty to give in. If a firm meets and confers with the union over such a decision and is not moved—that is, if negotiations reach an impasse—it can implement the decision without liability. There are obviously risks and uncertainties in adjudication, all complicated by delay.74 But neither unions nor employees can pursue litigation over such decisions. They can only file charges with the NLRB; the General Counsel's decision whether and how aggressively to pursue those charges is not subject to appeal or review.75 From the perspective of a well-advised firm, the NLRA's legal constraints are likely at worst to slow the implementation of an economically rational decision to replace or displace employees. At best, a union might be able to alter the firm's calculus by offering concessions or creative solutions to the firm's problems (a possibility that does little to curb management opposition to unionization).  \n\nThe point of the NLRA's prohibition of antiunion discrimination and its duty to bargain is to enable workers to claim a collective voice in workplace governance, including some decisions that threaten their jobs, through union organizing and collective bargaining. (And one point of that is to redress the endemic inequality of bargaining power between employers and unorganized employees.) The NLRA has largely failed in these aims. Gaining union representation under the NLRA requires workers to run a gauntlet of intense employer resistance on the way to proving majority support. Few workers manage to do that, and even fewer manage to secure a collective bargaining agreement, with its characteristic formal and informal mechanisms for resolving problems. Yet the NLRA is the only game in town when it comes to collective voice in the private sector workplace, for federal labor law forecloses employers' voluntary construction of alternative structures of collective voice and preempts any state or local efforts either to authorize such alternative structures or to facilitate union organizing.76 The upshot is that most privatesector workers-well over $90\\%$ have no formal collective voice at work. 77 They are subject to a regime of largely unfettered managerial discretion to fire them or replace them with subcontractors, machines, or otherwise.  \n\nThe NLRA's limited reach in this domain led Congress in 1988 to enact the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act78 (WARN). The WARN Act “protects workers, their families, and communities by requiring employers with 1oo or more employees ... to provide at least 60 calendar days advance written notice of a plant closing and mass layoff affecting 50 or more employees at a single site of employment,\"79 with exceptions for \"unforeseeable business circumstances,” failing companies, and natural disasters.8o Beyond requiring notice, the WARN Act does not constrain even large-scale employee-replacement (or displacement) decisions. The main point of the Act is simply to give “workers and their families some transition time to adjust to the ..: loss of employment, to seek and obtain other jobs, and if necessary, to enter skill training or retraining.\"s1 The WARN Act does not require bargaining over mass layoffs (much less a justification), though it might incidentally afford a practical opportunity to bargain, where there is a union on the scene, over decisions that are not subject to the NLRA's duty to bargain.  \n\nC. Looking Through Formalities: Misclassification and JointEmployer Doctrines  \n\nFinally, the law of work may disregard some fissuring decisions for some purposes and treat a firm as the legal employer of some workers who are nominally either independent contractors or employees of contractors. That prospect should blunt the incentive to replace employees through fissuring to whatever extent those decisions are driven by avoidance of employer responsibilities.  \n\nFirms that purport to contract out work to “independent contractors\" may find that their chosen categorization of workers is rejected based on the real nature of the relationship—for example, the putative employer's control of the means and manner of the work and the extent of the worker's integration into the enterprise. That is, adjudicators may find that the firm has misclassified an employee as an independent contractor and is in fact subject to one or more of the legal duties and burdens of employer status that it might have sought to avoid by contract. In such cases, the formalities of the contract—which function as a purported waiver by the employee of nonwaivable employee rights will be disregarded.  \n\nUnfortunately,  misclassification  still  appears  to  be rampant.s2 Part of the problem is that the formalities of the relationship-even if they would be disregarded in case of a legal challenge—establish workers’ own assumptions about their status. And misclassified workers themselves—even if they know enough to think they should be treated as employees—must generally take the initiative and bear the cost of challenging their misclassification.s3 Those who do so face a legal morass in the form of multifactor balancing tests, with nearly as many variations as there are labor and employment statutes—federal, state, and local.84 And at the end of the day, if an employer is found to have misclassified employees, it rarely faces any kind of penalty—just the liabilities it should have borne all along.85 That's not much by way of deterrence. The classification issue is one of the most hotly contested in all of labor and employment law. And for the foreseeable future, this area of law remains a hot mess.  \n\nMuch the same can be said of “joint-employer” doctrines, under which a lead employer and its contractors may be held jointly responsible for the latter's employees under some labor statutes, including the Fair Labor Standards Act86 (FLSA) and the NLRA.87 The lead employer's control—actual or potential—is again at the center of the inquiry. But beyond that, joint-employer doctrine is another morass of multifactor balancing tests.88  \n\nJoint-employer doctrine is also a political football that gets kicked back and forth across the field with changes in administration. To illustrate: Under the leadership of David Weil, who literally wrote the book on fissuring, the Obama-era U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL) Wage and Hour Division expanded the reach of joint-employer status under the FLSA.s9 President Donald Trump's DOL then set about to undo that work through rulemaking.so Weil was nominated to return to the DOL under President  \n\nJoseph Biden, but opposition from employers and their congressional allies killed the nomination.91 The Biden DOL nonetheless rescinded the Trump-era joint-employment rule and proposed a new one based on prior precedents.92 Politics have similarly driven the waxing and waning of the NLRB's joint employer doctrine, which determines, among other things, which firms must bargain with a union representing a contractor's employees.93  \n\nSo, in principle, the law can look through some of the formalities of fissuring to defeat their employment-avoidance aims. But politics plays a large role in whether it does so. And practical realities ensure that employers mostly have their way in any case, for they can establish a strong de facto presumption of nonemployer status through their control of the formalities of the relationship, which are only rarely challenged.  \n\n## IV. REBALANCING MARKET POWER BY CURBING EMPLOYEEREPLACEMENTOPTIONS  \n\nSo we find that existing U.S. law has a superficially wellstocked toolbox of regulatory techniques for curbing or reviewing firms' replacement of employees through fissuring, relocation, automation, or otherwise. But a closer look reveals that most of the tools are dull, broken, or the wrong size for the job. That may be reassuring to those who doubt the social utility of intervening in apparently rational managerial decisions about where and how to accomplish the tasks required to compete successfully in product markets. To those who are persuaded, as I am, that the proliferation of employee-replacement options has contributed significantly to the erosion of workers' labor market power, it suggests a reform agenda. Truth be told, it leads by a somewhat unfamiliar path to a rather familiar reform agenda—one that is likely to raise equally familiar economic objections, which I'll briefly addresshere.  \n\n### A. Job Security and Collective Employee Voice  \n\nI'll focus here briefly on two big deficits in the existing U.S law of work relative to that of some other advanced capitalist democracies: the vast majority of U.S. employees lack any guarantee of job security, in that employers need not justify their dismissal or replacement by whatever means, and they lack any mechanism to participate, through collective bargaining or otherwise, in employer decisions that threaten to replace or displace them.94 One way to address both deficits might be through conventional labor-law reforms—like those in the proposed Protecting the Right to Organize Acts5 (PRO)—that make it easier for workers to gain union representation and the right to bargain for both job security and a say in employee-replacement decisions. Such reforms are plainly in order, in my view. But even if we imagine away the stubborn political logjam that has long blocked collective labor-law reform, it is unlikely that reforms to the basic NLRA model would come close to enabling most workers to secure either job security or a collective voice at work through unionization. I'll leave those issues for another venue.  \n\nWe might look abroad for alternative solutions, as some U.S labor scholars and advocates have done over recent decades. In particular, we might look to the experience of some European countries with a strong social democratic tradition and lower levels of income and wealth inequality than in the United States.96 There we find ample experience with both legal protections of job security and robust mechanisms of worker voice in addition to collective bargaining. Unjust-dismissal laws require employers to justify dismissals or else to compensate dismissed workers.97 And codetermination laws provide, among other things, for the establishment of elected “works councils” in enterprises of a certain scale, based on a modest showing of employee interest. Works councils enjoy legally enforceable entitlements to consultation and codetermination within enterprises, including over many kinds of decisions that displace workers.9s Works councils supplement collective bargaining over basic economic terms (which takes place chiefly at the sectoral, not the enterprise, level).s9 Employment protection laws and works councils should tend to boost workers' labor market power, in part by constraining employers' ability to replace them.10o  \n\nAny such reform agenda would face innumerable issues of institutional design and more-than-daunting political hurdles that I will ignore here. But I do want to briefly address a particular set of policy concerns: both unjust dismissal laws and works councils (if effective) would encumber firms’ flexibility by design, constraining employee displacement and tilting firms’ strategic calculus toward other (and perhaps slower) responses to changing market conditions and opportunities. Moreover, both sets of reforms tend to operate in favor of incumbent employees to the potential detriment of would-be employees—both new entrants to the labor market and those who might prefer to switch jobs. These concerns warrant a brief look at empirical evidence on the economic impact of employee protections.  \n\nIn neoclassical economic theory, in which labor markets were usually assumed to be fully competitive, the economic impact of legal restraints on dismissal seemed clear: employment protections that made it more difficult or costly to fire or lay off workers would inhibit new hiring, depress economic dynamism, increase unemployment, and impair overall economic performance.1o1 The official line of the World Bank for many years reflected that neoliberal consensus and prescribed maximum flexibility in the hiring and especially the firing of workers.1o2 The Bank's 2007 Doing Business Report thus ranked countries in part by the ease of firing workers; the United States came out on top.103  \n\nIn recent decades, the neoclassical and neoliberal consensus has been increasingly challenged. One group of scholars, summarizing “the voluminous literature on the economic effects of labour laws\"” as of 2019, concluded that “\"the theoretical effect of firing restrictions on employment levels is ambiguous.\"104 On the one hand, as the neoclassicists maintained:  \n\n[T]he imposition of statutory controls could induce distortions or imperfections in the allocation of resources by raising firms' firing (and hence hiring) costs . . . . [S]lowing down labour market transitions may have broader negative effects, including deterring innovation by market entrants concerned about high severance costs in the event of business failure and exaggerating the effects of the economic cycle.  \n\nOn the other hand, if fairness at work is a benefit that workers value but employers tend to under-provide, for example because of adverse selection effects, dismissal legislation can induce an increase in labour supply and also help shift the employment exchange to a more efficient contractual equilibrium.105  \n\nMoreover, employment protections—that is, laws regulating dismissals and layoffs and the use of temporary and part-time workers—might “\"provide elements of insurance and income smoothing that are not straightforward to obtain through private contracting, due to information asymmetries and collective action costs.\"1o6 Empirically, some evidence linked stricter employmentprotection laws with “enhanced worker-employer cooperation and labour productivity,” and with “increases in firm-level innovation, the logic being that workers are more prepared to share knowledge with managers if the firm can make credible job security commitments.\"io7 But how do all the costs and benefits add up?  \n\nThe latest and most comprehensive word on the economic impact of employment-protection legislation (EPL) comes from a massive comparative study out of Cambridge University, where researchers created a carefully coded data set on EPL that spans 117 countries over four decades.1os Focusing on data from 1990 to 2013, the researchers found that EPL was associated with small but mostly positive long-term net effects on national economic performance, including modestly lower unemployment levels in the longer run and a higher labor share of national income.1o9 The impact on labor's share is consistent with the relationship posited here between workers’ job security and their labor market power.110  \n\nThese results may seem surprising. The restrictions that EPLs impose on firms' flexibility in shedding workers would seem almost inexorably to inhibit their willingness to hire new employees. Among the explanations suggested by the Cambridge researchers for the modestly positive net results is that employment protections appear to be associated with higher public and private investments in worker training.iii In particular, jobsecurity protections should tend to encourage employers to invest in incumbent workers’ skills and to cultivate their ability to switch to new tasks instead of treating them as disposable. A shift from replacement toward retraining could boost both workers' productivity and their labor market power and could thus mitigate the costs and mine the benefits of job security.112  \n\nEven the World Bank has changed its tune as the data have mounted. After years of instructing the world, and especially developing countries, that employment protections harmed firms, workers, and national economies, the Bank announced a new line in its 2015 Doing Business Report: “[e]mployment regulations are unquestionably necessary” and \"benefit both workers and firms\"; indeed, labor laws could impair national competitiveness and growth not simply where they were “excessive\" but also where they were“insufficient.\"113  \n\nThe last proposition captures one caveat: the relationship between mandatory employment protections and economic performance is hardly linearthat is, more protective laws are not necessarily better. With respect to employment levels, for example, one study found that, “at low levels of regulation, an increase in EPL is associated with a rise in employment; at medium levels, with a ‘plateau, signifying little or no impact; and at higher levels, employment declines.\"i14 In other words, job security is a good thing, but only up to a point. Still, the evidence strongly suggests that the United States could improve upon its unusually low level of employment protections before reaching the point of diminishing or negative returns.  \n\nA second caveat is that complementary institutions—such as greater public and private investments in worker training—may be necessary to capture the potential benefits and mitigate the costs of job-security protections. At the same time, as we've noted, job-security protections themselves should encourage firms to invest in training incumbent workers. The point about complementarity may hold as well for structures of worker participation and codetermination, which both reinforce and are reinforced by jobsecurity protections, and which go hand in hand with longer job tenure, willingness to share information, and investments in training.  \n\nOn the economic impact of worker representation, the Cambridge study is again instructive. It included, as part of its overall EPL index, a subindex for employee-representation variables, including “legislation on co-determination and employee information and consultation rights,” especially over collective dismissals or layoffs.115 Among OECD countries, researchers found that the employee representation variables in particular were positively associated with both productivity and labor's share of income.l16 Professor Simon Deakin, who leads the Cambridge study, concluded that, “[li]n supporting workers' codetermination rights, labour laws can contribute not just to greater equality, as measured by labour's share of national income, but also improved productivity and innovation, thus leading to higher employment.\"i17  \n\nThese studies are the latest though not the last word on the net economic impact of laws protecting and empowering employees. Data rarely drive U.S. labor policy debates, at least not directly. But data might bring about a shift in the weight of informed opinion and eventually in conventional wisdom—if there is any such thing in our polarized times—about what kinds of employment laws are good for the society as a whole, and especially for those who have been on the losing end of labor market trends for the past several decades.  \n\n## CONCLUSION  \n\nLabor economists and legal scholars are increasingly cognizant of the reality of labor market power versus the assumptions of frictionless and efficient labor markets that have long animated much policy analysis. Workers can have more or less labor market power, and most workers seem to have less ofit in recent decades, judging from labor's declining share of income and the growing divergence between productivity gains and wage increases.1i8 The consequences of scarce bargaining power ripple through the lives of workers and their families. But this Essay is concerned less with the consequences than with the causes of workers' depressed labor market power.  \n\nI have argued here that several major labor market trends of the past half century—including automation and the growth of fissured, fractured, and footloose supply chains and nonstandard employment relations—share the tendency to enhance firms' ability to replace, displace, or avoid hiring full-time employees, and thus to depress workers' labor market power. The point of highlighting this particular set of causal factors is to direct our attention to policy tools and institutional reforms that can rebalance labor market power in workers' favor. Employers decide to replace employees with contractors or temporary workers or machines, and those decisions can be regulated in a variety of ways. There is a great deal of experience across the world with legal tools that constrain employers' ability to replace workers, and there is growing empirical evidence that these tools can be deployed successfully without the adverse consequences long predicted by employers and market fundamentalists. They should be among labor's priorities if and when pro-worker policy making again becomes feasible at the national level.  "
