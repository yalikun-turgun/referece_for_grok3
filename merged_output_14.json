We document a positive relation between expenditures for PP&E and R&D and institutional share ownership. This relation is robust to a variety of specifications. We examine the link between firm-level expenditures and institutional ownership by using lead-lag structures and changes in institutional ownership. The data do not support the contention that institutional investors cause corporate managers to behave myopically. Indeed, the data indicate that the presence of institutional shareholders allows managers to invest more in PP&E and R&D than would individual shareholders.  \n\n# Do Institutional Investors Exacerbate Managerial Myopia?  \n\n# 1. Introduction  \n\nThis study is an empirical investigation of the relation between the shareholdings and trading activity of institutional investors, and expenditures for property, plant and equipment (PP&E) and research and development (R&D) by U.S. corporations. The motivation for this study derives from a large body of (mostly theoretical) literature that addresses the causes and consequences of “myopia” on the part of managers. A recurrent theme in this literature is that U.S. stock market investors are impatient and that this impatience is communicated to corporate managers through pressure on stock prices; the consequence of this pressure is that managers are discouraged from investing for the longterm and instead focus on projects with short-term payoffs. Furthermore, the natural impatience of individual shareholders is exacerbated by institutional investors who are judged on the basis of short-term performance. The net result is that publicly traded U.S. corporations “underinvest’ relative to a value maximizing strategy and that the degree of underinvestment is increased by the trading activities of institutional investors. The term myopia has been widely adopted to describe this alleged short-term orientation. Though he does not endorse such a perspective, Friedman (1996, p.62) nicely summarizes this view.  \n\nOne frequently expressed fear is that institutional investors, which compete among one another for the business of ultimate savers, systematically adopt a time horizon that is too short ... to reflect the underlying preferences that individuals would exhibit on their own.  \n\nThe implication of this perspective is that, in a cross-section of firms, there will be a negative correlation between expenditures with long-term payoffs and the level of institutional ownership.  \n\nOne alternative, though less widely recognized, perspective is that institutions act as a wedge between impatient individual shareholders and corporate managers, thereby allowing corporate managers to focus on projects with longer investment horizons. A basis for such a view is that institutional investors have an information advantage relative to individual shareholders. As a consequence, they are more likely to withstand the temptation of rashly judging corporate managers on the basis of one quarter's earnings. This alternative perspective implies a positive correlation between the fraction of shares owned by institutional investors and corporate expenditures for projects with long-term payoffs.  \n\nWe examine the relationship between expenditures for PP&E and R&D and institutional holdings for over 2,500 firms from 1987 to 1994. We employ PP&E and R&D expenditures in our tests because these are discretionary expenditures with uncertain payoffs several years in the future. Our primary tests involve time-series cross-sectional regressions of PP&E or R&D expenditures on various measures of institutional shareholdings and trading activity. We document a positive relation between PP&E and R&D expenditures and institutional ownership. This positive relationship persists after controlling for growth, leverage, profitability, industry effects, and calendar year effects and is robust to a variety of empirical specifications.  \n\nThe positive  relation  between  expenditures  with  long-term  payoffs  and institutional ownership could arise because institutional investors allow managers to invest more or because institutional investors hold disproportionately larger stakes in firms with higher PP&E and R&D expenditures (i.e., there is a clientele effect).  We investigate the direction of causality by regressing current period expenditures on lagged institutional ownership and lagged changes in institutional ownership. The positive relation persists.  \n\nMyopia-based arguments typically focus on the deleterious effects  (i.e., underinvestment) of “excessive” trading by institutions. We address this issue in our tests by computing the portfolio turnover of each institution in each year. We form portfolio turnover quintiles based on this turnover measure and examine the relationship between firm-level expenditures and the level of share ownership (and the change in share ownership) of high turnover institutions. We detect a positive relation between both PP&E and R&D expenditures and the lagged level of share ownership of high turnover institutions and between PP&E and R&D expenditures and the lagged change in share ownership of high turnover institutions.  \n\nAt a minimum, our results do not support the contention that the concentration of shares in the hands of institutional investors causes managers to restrict PP&E and R&D expenditures relative to the levels that would occur if shares were held directly by individual investors. A more generous interpretation of our results is that they support the view that delegated money management through institutional investors encourages corporate managers to adopt longer investment horizons.  \n\nIn the next section, we briefly review the literature on the causes and consequences of corporate myopia. In section 3, we describe the data and our sample construction. Empirical results follow in section 4. In section 5, we provide a discussion of our results and conclude.  \n\n# 2. Background  \n\nThe origins of the concern that U.S. stock market investors are myopic can probably be traced to corporate managers who argue that stock market pressure for quarterly earnings improvement forces them to sacrifice the long-term welfare of the firms they manage [Dobrznyski (1986), Frey (1986) and Smale (1987)]. Their concerns on this matter cannot necessarily be dismissed. After all, corporate managers are the ultimate empiricists on this topic. Unfortunately, such assertions by corporate managers also can be (and have been) interpreted as self serving. That is, managers of poorly performing companies may argue that the poor short-term performance of their companies should be overlooked because they are managing for the “long-term\" (Jensen (1986a).  \n\nEconomists have responded to this debate by developing models in which rational value-maximizing managers are induced to follow myopic corporate investment policies even though these policies result in positive net present value being sacrificed so as to boost current earnings.  The authors of these models typically do not argue that shareholders are myopic, rather they show that under certain assumptions myopic investment policies can persist even in an economy with rational investors and rational managers [Stein (1988, 1989), Narayanan (1985, 1996), Thakor (1990), Bizjak, Brickley and Coles (1993), Bebchuk and Stole (1993), and Shleifer and Vishny (1990), among Others].  \n\nMuch of the public debate regarding the short-term pressures faced by corporate managers compares the U.S. stock market environment unfavorably with that of Japan and Germany [Porter (1992), Blinder (1992), Jacobs (1991) and Thurow (1993)]. In all three countries, financial institutions hold a large fraction of the equity of publicly traded companies. In Japan and Germany, institutional investors are largely commercial banks who appear to trade relatively infrequently.  In contrast, in the U.s., institutional investors are predominately fund managers whose trading accounts for a large portion of trading volume [Schwartz and Shapiro (1992)].  \n\nOne line of reasoning holds that fund mangers are judged on the basis of shortterm performance. Fund managers, in turn, communicate this short-term horizon to corporate managers by means of their trading activity. Fund managers are portrayed as being ever ready to “dump”' a stock, thereby beating down its price at the first hint of an earnings decline. Theory and empirical evidence can be marshaled to support such a scenario. For example, Trueman (1988) has developed a theoretical model in which he shows that if fund managers’ compensation is related to investors’ perception of his/her ability, the manager will trade more than is justified on the basis of his/her private information; Dow and Gorton (1997) have developed a model in which portfolio managers trade even though they have no reason to prefer one asset relative to another; and Shleifer and Vishny (1990) present a model in which the short horizons of investors can lead to short horizons of corporate managers. On the empirical front, Lakonishok, Shleifer, Thaler and Vishny (1991) find that pension fund managers “dump losers\"” at the end of the year.  \n\nFroot, Perold and Stein (1992) thoughtfully review the logic and data that underlie this line of reasoning and pinpoint conditions under which institutional investors can influence  managerial  investment  behavior. Specifically, they show thatthree preconditions are required for managerial underinvestment: (a) managers care about current stock prices, (b) there is information asymmetry with respect to investment expenditures, and (c) stock prices are sensitive to current measures of profitability. They argue that performance evaluation horizons can result in institutional investors having shorter holding periods (or equivalently, higher turnover rates) than individual investors. Thus, the presence of institutional shareholders forces managers to maximize the current stock price by forgoing profitable investment projects.  \n\nAn aspect of the connection between corporate managers and fund managers that is often overlooked (indeed, we have found no reference to this possibility at all) is that institutional investors may provide a wedge between the myopic tendencies of individual investors and the value maximizing strategies that corporate managers might wish to pursue. Most of the theoretical models that seek to explain the existence of underinvestment begin with the assumption that investors are less well informed than are managers. In that circumstance, managers find it optimal to signal the value of the firm by cutting capital expenditures to pump up short-term earnings.  Professional money managers are likely to be better informed than individuals (perhaps because of economies of scale in gathering information, unique information gathering abilities, or for other reasons). If we assume that money managers are better informed than are individual shareholders, they may be less likely to dump a stock in the face of poor short-term earnings. This reduced pressure on stock prices translates, in turn, into reduced pressure on corporate managers to cut expenditures with long-term payoffs.  \n\nIn the sections that follow, we empirically investigate whether expenditures for PP&E and R&D are negatively correlated with share ownership by institutional investors (as suggested by the “myopia” view) or positively correlated (as suggested by the “\"wedge”view).  \n\n# 3. Data and sample construction  \n\n## 3.1 Data  \n\nInstitutional investors are required to report their portfolio holdings to the SEC under section 13F of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (Rule 13F-1). The institutional disclosure program under this section of the act requires all money managers with investment discretion over $\\$100$ million in equity securities to report their holdings.  \n\nIn the case of shared investment discretion, only one manager includes information regarding the securities held, thereby avoiding double counting (see Lemke and Lins (1987) for a description of the disclosure rules). Furthermore, the data are aggregated to the level of the money manager. So, for example, the holdings of all the funds under the Fidelity family umbrella are aggregated and reported under the parent (Fidelity Management and Research). These data are compiled by CDA/Spectrum and made available through Compact Disclosure.  \n\nWe obtain quarterly institutional ownership data for all NYSE, Amex and Nasdaq firms from the third quarter of 1987 through the fourth quarter of 1994. The data contain a security identifier and information on the number of shares of each firm owned by each institution. For each firm-year, we obtain from Compustat, total assets (Compustat data item 6), sales (Compustat data item 12), R&D expenditures (Compustat data item 46), PP&E expenditures (Compustat data item 128, also referred to as “capital expenditures\"), total property, plant and equipment (Compustat data item 8), operating income (Compustat data item 13) and debt (Compustat data item 9).  \n\n## 3.2 Sample Construction  \n\nWe impose two restrictions on the sample. First, we eliminate financial firms (firms with SIC codes from 6000 to 6999) because Compustat does not report PP&E and R&D expenditures by financial firms. Second, if a firm has missing R&D data for a year, we drop that firm-year observation from our sample.1 Our final sample consists of approximately 2,500 firms from 1987 to 1994. Firms enter and exit our sample due to IPOs, mergers, takeovers and voluntary liquidations; consequently, our sample does not suffer from survivorship bias that may otherwise be systematically related to PP&E and R&D expenditures.  \n\n# 4. Empirical Results  \n\n## 4.1 Descriptive Statistics  \n\nWe begin by providing descriptive statistics on our dependent and independent variables. Following Fazzari, Hubbard and Peterson (1988) and Kaplan and Zingales (1997), we scale PP&E expenditures by lagged PP&E. We scale R&D expenditures by contemporaneous sales. Table 1 gives the distribution of expenditures for PP&E and R&D, institutional ownership, and the number of institutional shareholders. Since there is likely to be variation in both the cross-section and the time-series, we report the $25^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile, the mean, and the $75^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile separately for each year in the time-series.  \n\nPanels A and B show substantial cross-sectional variation in PP&E and R&D expenditures. For example, in 1994, the $25^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile of the ratio of annual PP&E expenditures to the lagged total PP&E for the firms in our sample was 0.121, while the mean was 0.26 and the $75^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile was 0.360. We do not detect a secular pattern in the time-series expenditures for PP&E; however, there does appear to be a small increase in the ratio of R&D to sales over time. The data in panels A and B indicate that expenditures for PP&E and R&D are economically quite large. For example, in 1994, the average book value of total PP&E for the firms in our sample was $\\$473$ million. Since the PP&E expenditure ratio was 0.267, the implied average PP&E expenditure for 1994 was $\\$126$ million. Similarly, the average sales for the firms in the sample in 1994 was $\\$1,013$ million, implying that the average R&D expenditure in the same year was $\\$72.9$ million.  \n\nPanel C gives the distribution of institutional ownership over time. There is substantial  cross-sectional  variation  in  institutional  ownership. Perhaps more importantly, the data show a strong monotonic increasing trend in the time-series - - institutional ownership increases from an average of $27.6\\%$ in 1987 to $39.5\\%$ in 1994. This time-series trend is also evident in the number of institutional investors per firm (panel D) - - the average number of institutional shareholders per firm increases from 46.9 in 1987 to 70.7 in 1994. Because of this time-series trend, we employ calendar-year indicator variables in the regressions that follow.  \n\n## 4.2 Regression estimates  \n\nTo investigate the relationship between corporate expenditures with long-term payoffs and institutional ownership, we estimate a number of time-series cross-sectional regressions with our measures of PP&E and R&D expenditures as dependent variables.  \n\nOur primary independent variables are institutional ownership and changes in institutional ownership. If we estimate a regression of expenditures for PP&E and R&D on the current year's institutional ownership, a negative coefficient on institutional ownership establishes a contemporaneous (negative) correlation between these variables. For example, a negative relationship between capital expenditures and institutional ownership could result from institutions causing managers to invest less in PP&E. Alternatively, such a relationship could also result from a clientele effect (i.e., because institutions weight their portfolios more heavily towards firms that invest less in PP&E). Inferences regarding causality cannot be drawn from such contemporaneous correlations.  \n\nTo extract information on the causal relationships between expenditures with long-term payoffs and institutional ownership, we specify the regressions with a lagged time series structure.  Specifically, we regress the measures of PP&E and R&D expenditures (in a given year) on institutional ownership and various control variables from the prior year (t-1). In specifications that use changes in institutional ownership, we measure changes in ownership from year t-2 to t-1. This time-series structure permits us to make stronger statements regarding causation for several reasons.  First, the dependent variables are always “changes\" because expenditures for both PP&E and R&D are flow items. Second, the independent variables are always specified with a lag, implying time-series causality. Third, in addition to the level of institutional ownership, we also employ changes in institutional ownership as an independent variable. If lagged changes in institutional ownership are related to current period PP&E  (R&D) expenditures, such a relationship is likely to be consistent with a causal relationship from institutional ownership to PP&E (R&D) expenditures rather than the other way around.  \n\nVarious other independent variables are included to control for factors that might influence PP&E and R&D expenditures. We include the market-to-book ratio of the firm in the prior year as an independent variable to control for growth opportunities. We include the lagged leverage ratio (debt-to-assets) as an independent variable. Debt can be either negatively related to corporate expenditures if it causes underinvestment (see Myers (1977)) or positively related to corporate expenditures if it curtails overinvestment due to agency problems between managers and shareholders (see Jensen (1986b). Another possibility is that debt reduces overinvestment, but exacerbates underinvestment (Stulz (1990) and McConnell and Servaes (1995)).  We control for lagged operating income (scaled by lagged assets) to proxy for the availability of internal capital resources. Following Morck, Shleifer and Vishny (1988), we control for industry variation in our dependent variables by including an indicator variable for each two-digit SIC code. Because there is also time-series variation in the data, we include indicator variables for each calendar year and estimate the regressions without an intercept. We do not explicitly control for firm size on the right hand side of the regression because our dependent variables are scaled by sales and total PP&E (not annual expenditures for PP&E).  \n\nThe results of our basic regressions are reported in table 2. Columns 2 and 3 (4 and 5) report regressions with PP&E expenditures (R&D expenditures) as the dependent variable. The explanatory power of the regressions is fairly high; the adjusted- $\\cdot\\mathsf{R}^{2}$ srange from 0.70 to 0.54 and the coefficient estimates are reasonably stable across specifications. Each control variable is statistically significant with a p-value less than O.01. The market to book ratio is positive in all four regression specifications, implying that firms with better investment opportunities spend more on both PP&E and R&D. This result is consistent with Lang, Ofek and Stulz (1996), who document a positive relationship between capital expenditures and Tobin's Q. Debt is negatively related to expenditures for PP&E and R&D, suggesting that, at the aggregate level, the negative effects of debt overhang dominate the positive effects due to  the curtailment of overinvestment. Consistent with Fazzari, Hubbard and Peterson (1988), Whited (1992) and Lang, Ofek and Stulz (1996), lagged operating income is positively related to current period PP&E expenditures. Somewhat surprisingly, however, lagged operating income is negatively related to the current period's R&D expenditures. Bhagat and Welch (1995) detect a similar relationship and are unable to offer a satisfactory explanation for this relationship (and neither can we). In general, the sign and magnitude of the control variables are consistent with the existing empirical literature.  \n\nLagged institutional ownership is positively related to both PP&E and R&D expenditures.  The coefficient estimate for institutional ownership in the PP&E expenditure regression is 0.006. Since the average investment in PPE in 1994 was $\\$473$ million, this coefficient implies that a one percentage point increase in institutional ownership results in an increase in expenditure for PP&E of $\\$2.8$ million. Similarly, the coefficient estimate for institutional ownership in the R&D regression is O.01 which implies that a one percentage point increase in institutional ownership results in an incremental R&D expenditure of $\\$10.1$ million. The coefficient estimates are statistically significant (p-values $<0.01$ ). Of course, economic significance lies in the eye of the beholder. From our perspective at least, the relationship is economically consequential as well. The results are inconsistent with the argument that institutional investors constrain managements? ability to invest in projects with deferred payoffs.  \n\nDespite the lag-structure employed in the regressions, it is still possible that institutions (disproportionately) tilt their portfolios towards firms that subsequently invest more in PP&E and R&D. In other words, a clientele effect with a one period lag could produce empirical results like those in columns 2 and 4 of table 2. To further investigate the relationship between institutional ownership and expenditures for PP&E and R&D, we estimate models with the change in institutional ownership from t-2 to t-1 as an independent variable.  As before, we use control variables for investment opportunities, leverage, operating income, industry effects and calendar-year effects. The results of these regressions are reported in columns 3 (for PP&E) and 5 (for R&D) of table 2.  \n\nThe sign and significance of the control variables are unaffected. The coefficient of change in institutional ownership from t-2 to t-1 is positively and significantly related to current PP&E expenditures, suggesting that the causal relation in our regressions runs from institutional  ownership  to PP&E expenditures. The  change in  institutional ownership is also positively related to R&D expenditures but the p-value is only 0.10.  \n\nThe regressions suggest a causal relationship between institutional ownership and PP&E and R&D expenditures. Because our computation of institutional ownership (and changes in institutional ownership) combines heterogeneous institutions, it is possible that this pooling masks some of the relationship. In fact, our discussion in section 2 implies that managerial-myopia is more likely to result from high turnover institutions. Thus, we now estimate the regressions conditional on the portfolio turnover of the institutions.  \n\n## 4.3 Institutional portfolio turnover  \n\nWe provide evidence on the cross-sectional variation in the trading of institutions by describing their portfolio turnover. Recall that the novelty of our data is that we possess information on the ownership of each institution in every quarter. With these  \n\ndata, we calculate the portfolio turnover of each institution j, during the fourth quarter of each year as  \n\n$$\nP o r t T u r n_{j}=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(\\frac{\\left|S h r_{t}P_{t}-S h r_{t-1}P_{t-1}\\right|}{S h r_{t-1}P_{t-1}}\\right)\n$$  \n\nwhere $S h r_{t}$ is the number of shares owned by institution j in firm i at time t, $P_{t}$ is the price of the stock at time $\\mathbf{t}$ and $N$ is the number of firms in the institution's portfolio.  \n\nWe rank institutions from highest to lowest turnover each year based on their turnover in the fourth quarter. We then classify them into quintiles. Because we form quintiles each year, institutions can change quintiles each year.  For example, an institution can fall into quintile 1 in 1987 and quintile 3 in 1988. This rebalancing in quintile formation is important because new institutions enter the sample over time.  \n\nIn table 3, we report the average portfolio turnover and the average fraction of shares owned by institutions in each turnover quintile for each year. The first number in each cell is the average portfolio turnover of the institutions in that quintile. The average quarterly portfolio turnover of the highest turnover quintile in 1987 was 0.05, implying a holding period of approximately 5 years. In general, the average turnover statistics in table 3 appear to be quite low. However, since institutional ownership data reported under the aegis of Rule 13F are aggregated at the fund family level, institution-specific turnover figures are uniformly dampened. Therefore, the average turnover of each quintile is also biased downward. It is unlikely that this bias affects the results, however, because we are concerned with the distribution of the turnover measure across all institutions, rather than its numerical value. This distribution suggests that there is considerable heterogeneity in institutional turnover across quintiles.  \n\nThe second number in each cell (in square brackets) represents the average ownership by institutions in that quintile. This figure is calculated by summing the fraction of shares owned by institutions in that quintile and then averaging across firms. The average ownership of institutions in a quintile decreases monotonically from low to high turnover quintiles. In other words, low turnover institutions own proportionately more of the firms in our sample than high turnover institutions. This relationship is present in every year.  \n\nThe third number in each cell (in parentheses) is the average number of institutions in a quintile that own equity in the firms in the sample. This number is calculated by counting the number of institutions (in that quintile) that own shares in each company and then averaging the count across all companies. The number of institutions owning stock in a quintile also decreases monotonically across quintiles. For example, in 1987 approximately 20 institutions were in the lowest quintile and owned a total of $14\\%$ Of the firms in the sample. Thus, the average stake of each institution in quintile 1 was $0.7\\%$ .In contrast, almost two institutions were in the highest quintile and owned a total of $1.1\\%$ of the stocks in the sample, implying an average stake of $0.55\\%$  \n\n## 4.4  Institutional portfolio turnover and long-term expenditures  \n\nWe now use the portfolio turnover data to assess whether high turnover institutions “cause\" managers to invest less in PP&E and R&D than they would otherwise. To do so, we regress the current year's PP&E and R&D expenditures on the lagged institutional ownership and lagged changes in institutional ownership for each quintile. If institutions cause managers to behave myopically (i.e., invest less in PP&E and R&D), we expect negative coefficients on ownership and changes in ownership of the high turnover quintiles (i.e., quintiles 4 and 5).  \n\nAs before, we control for industry effects, calendar year effects, investment opportunities, leverage, and operating income. For each quintile, the coefficients on our control variables are identical in sign and significance and similar in magnitude to those reported in table 2.  \n\nThe coefficients of the fraction of shares owned by the low turnover quintiles (quintiles 1 and 2) are not significant in any of the four regressions. In contrast, the coefficients for the high turnover quintiles (4 and 5) are positive and significant in all four regressions. These results suggest that, if anything, high turnover institutions allow firms to invest greater amounts in PP&E and R&D than would direct ownership by individuals.  \n\nAs before, we attempt to further address the question of causality by estimating regressions with the change in institutional ownership for each quintile (measured from t2 to t-1) as an independent variable. The results are given in columns 3 and 5. The change in ownership of each quintile is positively related to expenditures for PP&E, suggesting a causal relationship between expenditures for PP&E and institutional ownership.  The evidence from the R&D regressions is weaker; the change in ownership of quintile 1 is positively related to R&D expenditures (p-value $=0.00\\AA.$ ), but the change in ownership in the other four quintiles is not statistically significant (p-values $>0.10,$  \n\nThe evidence does not support the contention that the presence of institutional shareholders causes managers to curtail investment in PP&E and R&D. A more generous interpretation is that institutional investors allow managers to adopt longer investment horizons than would individual shareholders.  \n\n## 4.5 Specification issues  \n\nWe perform a battery of checks to assess the robustness of our results.  Our purpose is to determine whether the results are sensitive to the manner in which we construct the dependent and independent variables. We discuss the results below but do not report them in separate tables.  \n\nFirst, we re-estimate each regression by scaling expenditures for PP&E by total assets and by total sales. The sign and significance of the coefficients are unchanged.  \n\nSecond, we scale R&D expenditures by total assets. Our results with this regression are stronger in that the p-value for the change in total institutional ownership in our table 2 regression declines from 0.10 to 0.01. Other results are qualitatively unchanged.  \n\nThird, we control for industry effects using the industry median rather than SIC code indicator variables. Specifically, we compute the median value of the R&D to sales ratio and the PP&E expenditure ratio for all firms with the same 3-digit SIC code. This median value is then subtracted from each firm's ratio. The explanatory power of regressions with this industry adjustment is lower than regressions in which SIC code indicator variables are used to account for industry effects; the adjusted- $\\cdot\\mathsf{R}^{2}$ declinesto approximately 0.20 for the capital expenditure regressions and 0.14 for the R&D regressions. However, the sign and statistical significance of our institutional ownership variables are unchanged.  \n\n# 5. Commentary  \n\nWith a sample of approximately 2,500 firms from 1987 to 1994, we show that firm-level expenditures for PP&E and R&D are positively related to the share holdings and trading activity of institutional investors in those firms. Our results cast doubt on the view that institutions cause corporate managers to behave myopically. They are consistent with the perspective that institutional investors act as a wedge between firms and impatient investors. One of the consequences of this wedge is that it allows managers to have longer investment horizons than they would otherwise.  \n\nThis investigation was undertaken in large part in response to pundits and authors who lament that the structure of share ownership places U.s. firms at a competitive disadvantage relative to certain other countries, especially Japan and Germany. According to these lamentations, Japanese and German firms are endowed with patient investors who allow corporate managers to take a long-term view. In contrast, U.S. stock market investors are alleged to be impatient. The patience of Japanese and German investors is alleged to derive from the structure of share ownership in those countries. In both cases, stock ownership is concentrated in commercial banks who are also permitted to play a major role in the governance of the companies in which they hold stakes. Not only is the aggregate ownership of these banks large, but their individual stakes are also large. By virtue of these large “insider” positions, banks are able to participate in the management process and, thereby, share in the value created by sharing management's long-term investment horizon. In contrast, in the U.s., institutional investors are largely fund managers who individually typically own less than $1\\%$ of the firms stock. The fund managers are alleged to be judged on the basis of quarterly performance which causes them, in turn, to churn their portfolios in a constant search for next quarter's winners. The consequence, so the lamentation goes, is that in the U.s., institutional investors exacerbate the natural impatience of individual investors; the end result would be that corporate managers are forced to adopt a short-term horizon in which projects with longterm payoffs are sacrificed for the sake of next quarter's earnings. The implication is that companies in which institutional investors own a substantial fraction of shares are induced to invest less in projects with long-term payoffs than companies that are not burdened with a concentration of institutional investors among their share holders. This view is summarized by Thurow (1992, p.136).  \n\nToday they (pension funds and mutual funds) own 60 to 70 percent of the shares of most publicly listed companies. As a result, the United States has organized a system that is the exact opposite of that of Germany and Japan. Those countries have organized a system (business groups) to minimize the influence and power of impatient shareholders, while the United States has organized a system (fund dominance) to maximize the influence ofimpatientshareholders.  \n\nThe results of our empirical analysis do not support this contention. Rather, we find that expenditures for PP&E and R&D are higher in firms with a larger fraction of shares held by institutional investors.  \n\nSeveral caveats are in order when interpreting our results. First, we do not address the question of whether firms systematically “underinvest’ relative to a value maximizing strategy. Indeed, Bebchuk and Stole (1993) show that myopia can result in both under and overinvestment. It could be that all U.S. firms underinvest, but firms which have a larger fraction of shares held by institutional investors underinvest to a lesser degree. Or, it could be that all firms overinvest and firms which have a larger fraction of shares held by institutional investors overinvest more. Our tests do not make that distinction.2 We can only conclude that firms which have a larger fraction of shares held by institutional investors invest more than do firms with a smaller fraction of shares held by institutional investors.  \n\nSecond, we do not address the question of whether U.S. firms systematically underinvest relative to firms in other parts of the world. That question is, however, examined carefully by Hall and Weinstein (1996) and Lee (1997). These authors find no evidence that managers of U.S. firms are myopic, relative to managers of Japanese and German firms. An integral component to the argument that the structure of financial markets and corporate governance in the U.s. induces myopia is the existence of an active takeover market that is alleged to threaten management's tenure. Indeed, much of the theoretical literature exploring the causes and consequences of myopia is motivated by the practitioner inspired notion that hostile takeovers cause managers to be myopic. It is true that unfriendly takeovers occur less frequently in Japan and Germany, but the near absence of these events does not mean that corporate managers are unfettered by the need to demonstrate good earnings performance. Indeed, Kaplan (1994), Kaplan and Minton (1994), and Kang and Shivdasani (1995) report that alternative mechanisms of control, such as management turnover and board appointments, are as sensitive to firm performance in Japan as they are in the U.S.  \n\nThird, we can be accused of examining the “easiest' investment categories to analyze - - PP&E and R&D - - while ignoring those in which the problem of underinvestment is likely to be most severe. Froot et al (1992) argue that the type of underinvestment that can be engendered by myopic investors is more likely to manifest itself in difficult to observe investments such as development of human resources and the costs incurred in the development of customer loyalty. To the extent that that argument is true, we are missing the target. We can, therefore, only claim that we can find no evidence that institutional investors exacerbate underinvestment in PP&E and R&D which may very well be different from the conclusion that institutional investors do not exacerbate underinvestment in projects with long term payoffs.  \n\nWith these caveats in mind, the data do not indicate that institutional investors cause managers to underinvest. Rather, to the contrary, institutional shareholders appear to allow corporate managers to invest more in projects with long-term payoffs.  \n\nReferences Bebchuk, Lucian Arye, and Lars A.

I develop hypotheses about this tradeoff and test the hypotheses on a unique dataset of 6,130 American startups. I find that startups in which the founder is still in control of theboard of directors and/or the CEO position are significantly less valuable than those in which the founder has given up control. On average, each additional level of founder control (i.e., controlling the board and/or the CEO position) reduces the pre-money valuation of the startup by 17.1-22.0percent.  \n\nManagerial summary: Afounder's vision and capabilities are key ingredients in the early success of a startup. During those early days, it is natural for the founder to have a powerful, central role. However, as the startup grows, founders who keep too much control of the startup and its most important decisions can harm thevalue of the startup.Both qualitative case studies and quantitative analyses of more than 6,ooo private companies highlight that startups in which the founder has maintained control (by retaining a majority of the board of directors and/or by remaining as CEo) have significantly lower valuations than those where the founder has relinquished control. This is especially true when the startup is three years old or more. Copyright $\\copyright$ 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.  \n\n## INTRODUCTION  \n\nIn a classic study of entrepreneurial  growth, Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven (1990: 504) pose the question: “Some young firms become resounding successes. ... Others languish as small firms. ... Why do these differences in organizational growth arise? I extend previous work by analyzing a factor that should have a powerful effect on whether value is created or the organization languishes: the degree to which the founder maintains control. I explore the possibility that the startup's resource needs drive a wedge between the growth of the startup and the founder's ability to maintain control—a so-called “control dilemma.\" Multiple steps along the entrepreneurial journey pose a tradeoff between attracting the resources required to build company value and being able to retain control of decision making.  \n\nThe key resources founders can attract include human, social, and financial capital (Sapienza, Korsgaard, et al., 2003) provided by cofounders, hires, and investors. However, attracting those resources often comes at the cost of ownership stakes and  decision-making  control.  I  develop hypotheses about this tradeoff, and test the hypotheses on a unique dataset of 6,130 American startups collected between 2005 and 2012. The analyses tap all respondents in the dataset and use fixed-effects with repeat respondents in order to control for unobserved time-invariant company characteristics.  \n\nThis study adds insights to several literatures. Within the entrepreneurship literature, conceptual studies (e.g., Amit etal., 2000; Evans and Jovanovic, 1989) have speculated that the desires for autonomy and control may affect the initial decision to launch a company, but have not broadened to include a fuller picture of company evolution. Likewise, analyses of entrepreneurial capital constraints have used bequests (e.g., Blanchflower and Oswald, 1998) and lottery winnings (e.g., Lindh and Ohlsson, 1998) to examine the propensity to become an entrepreneur. The entrepreneurial-finance literature (e.g., Hamilton, 2000; Moskowitz and Vissing-Jorgensen, 2002) has suggested that, on average, entrepreneurs receive fewer pecuniary benefits than they might receive in paid employment, but has not examined whether this is true for some types of entrepreneurs but not for others, and has not examined empirically whether those benefits might be affected by the degree of control retained by the founders.  \n\nIn larger corporations, the economics literature has examined the private benefits of control in the securities of public companies (e.g., Barclay and Holderness, 1989; Grossman and Hart, 1988; Lease, McConnell, and Mikkelson, 1983), but has not explored whether the private benefits of control extend to entrepreneurial decisions and outcomes. The corporate-finance literature on sustainable growth rates (e.g., Higgins, 1977, 1998) has highlighted the tension between growth objectives and financial policies, but its models ignore control considerations and it assumes stability in financial policies, reducing its applicability to our tension and to the types of companies examined here. In contrast to studies that focus on organizational relationships with external resource providers——such as corporate investment relationships, alliances, or joint ventures (e.g., Gulati and Sytch, 2007; Gulati and Wang, 2003; Katila, Rosenberger, and Eisenhardt, 2008; Ozcan and Eisenhardt, 2009)—this study focuses on resource providers who become part of the internal startup team, such as cofounders, hires, and investors who join the board of directors. Finally, resource-dependence theory has focused on the ways in which organizational uncertainty is reduced by attracting resources (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978), but has largely neglected how another important uncertainty—“control uncertainty,” or whether company leaders will lose control of decision making——may be heightened by the attraction of resources.  \n\nThus, the current study develops the theoretical grounding for this control dilemma. I empirically test the hypothesized tradeoff using a large, unique dataset that includes direct measures of founder control. I also delve into alternative hypotheses and contingencies. The analyses use fixed effects to control for unobserved time-invariant characteristics of the startups, and test the hypotheses on different metrics of value creation. The analyses show that, ceteris paribus, startups in which the founder is still in control of the board of directors and/or the CEO position are significantly less valuable than those in which the founder has given up a level of control. On average, each additional level of founder control (i.e., keeping control of the CEO position or board) reduces the pre-money valuation of the startup by 17.1-22.0 percent.1 The tradeoff is particularly strong in startups that are three years old or more. Because the analyses include a variety of resource providers (cofounders vs. hires vs. investors), I am also able to examine how different types of resources can differ in their impacts on the value that is built and on the founder's retention of control.  \n\n## THEORY AND HYPOTHESES  \n\nIn 1997,when first-time founder Lew Cirne founded Wily  Technology, an  enterpriseapplication management company, he faced a wide variety of decisions about how to build his company. Over the next two years, he hired experienced executives, built a team of fifty employees, raised two large rounds of financing from top venture capitalists (VCs), and gave up three of five seats on the board of directors to those investors. When it came time to raise the next round of financing, the board decided that Wily needed a CEO who had stronger business skills than Cirne, who had a technical background (Wasserman and McCance, 2005). Their choice, “professional CEO\" Richard Williams, replaced Cirne as CEO. For his part, Cirne was left with a very narrow technical-visionary role within the company. However, Williams was able to lead Wily to a big exit: a $\\$375$ million sale to Computer Associates in early 2006. Cirne admits he could never have accomplished such value creation, but he nevertheless was left with painful regrets about his early decisions that had led to his being replaced.2  \n\nThe founder of Steria, an information-technology systems and services company, faced similar decisions (Abetti, 2005). His desire “to remain independent and master of his own destiny” led him to resist cofounders, not to grant stock to potential employees, to refuse to accept capital from outside investors, and to maintain control of the company's equity. As a result, he was able to remain chief executive officer, but the company's growth was slowed markedly (Abetti, 2005).  \n\nI focus on a tradeoff that underlies the early founding decisions faced by the founders of Wily and Steria. Two decades ago, Stevenson and Jarillo (1990: 23) declared that “Entrepreneurship is a process by which individuals .. pursue opportunities without regard to the resources they currently control.” At first glance, this seems like an aspirational and optimistic definition. However, it has a dark side: When founding their businesses, entrepreneurs rarely control the key resources they will need to pursue the opportunity fully. In fact, it has been estimated that entrepreneurs are 60 times more likely to be resource constrained than to be unconstrained (Evans and Jovanovic, 1989).  \n\nBuilding on March and Simon (1958) and Pfeffer and Salancik (1978) state that an organization's most critical activity is establishing a coalition large enough to ensure survival. Doing this requires the organization to provide inducements to get participants to contribute to the organization. Most centrally, in exchange for their resources, resource providers demand “the ability to control and direct organizational action\" (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978: 27). In the startup realm in particular, investors worry about hold-up by entrepreneurs, and control rights are the main form of protection that they demand in exchange for their investment (Hellmann, 1998). Entrepreneurs who refuse to give up control should find it harder to attract investors and thus fail to grow as much value. This “control dilemma\" highlights how founders, despite their best intentions, can make decisions that limit the value of the companies they created, or else can risk losing control of their companies. In making resource decisions, founders thus trade off resource uncertainty for control uncertainty.  \n\nIn this section, I develop hypotheses about the tradeoff between value and control, the contexts in which this tradeoff might not apply, and the resulting performance implications. In developing these hypotheses, I build on theoretical work and speculation in the entrepreneurship literature, and on multiple studies of large companies. Closest to home, prior studies (e.g., Amit et al., 2000; Evans and Jovanovic, 1989) have examined conceptually how potential entrepreneurs’ motivations for control and financial gains might affect their initial decisions to initiate ventures. However, the tradeoff examined here applies throughout the early stages of company building, not only to the decision to initiate a venture, and has yet to be examined empirically among entrepreneurs.  \n\nIn an empirical exploration of the decision to initiate a venture,Hamilton (2000) found that, on average, the earnings of self-employed entrepreneurs were lower, both initially and over time, than the earnings of those engaged in paid employment, despite the common assumption that it is the profit motive that attracts them to the challenge of building new organizations (e.g., Kirzner, 1973; Schumpeter, 1942).3 To explain why people decide to become entrepreneurs anyway, he speculated that “entrepreneurs may trade lower earnings for the nonpecuniary benefits of business ownership ... such as “being their own boss,'\"\" (Hamilton, 2000: 605-606) but was not able to test this possibility empirically.4 (This speculation matches that of Carland etal. (1984), Amit et al. (2000), and Sapienza etal. (2003).) Below, I develop, enrich, and test this possibility.  \n\nThis view of the tension between control and value creation contrasts with Berle and Means's (1932) classical view of the separation of ownership and control in large corporations, and with subsequent work on agency theory (e.g., Jensen and Meckling, 1976). When owners no longer manage the company, the managers’ decisions often harm the value of the company because the managers’ interests will diverge from those of the shareholders. (Regarding small companies in particular, Jensen and Meckling (1976: 312) state that the benefits derived by an owner-manager may involve “non-pecuniary aspects of entrepreneurial activities’ such as being able to implement the founder's strategies.) In more modern terms, as founders give up equity to non-founders, agency costs should increase, reducing the value of the startup (e.g., Fama and Jensen, 1983; Jensen and Meckling, 1976). 1 propose a complementary resource-dependence effect that may counterbalance the increase in agency costs as founders give up control: Attracting key resources to the startup will help build its value.  \n\n### When are founders more likely to surrender control?  \n\nWithin high-potential startups, high rates of growth necessitate the attraction of a very high percentage of outside resources (Venkataraman, 1997), and the most valuable of those resources are usually in limited supply (Peteraf, 1993). Failure to attract missing resources  can be particularly  harmful because it can heighten the liability of newness, harm growth, and increase the chance of failure (Aldrich and Fiol, 1994; Stinchcombe, 1965). In fact, “Attracting resources into a fedgling venture is perhaps the greatest challenge faced by entrepreneurs.\" (Brush, Greene, and Hart, 2001: 71) The more resources that a new venture can gain control of, and the quicker it can do so, the better the venture's competitive position (Romanelli, 1989) and the more valuable the venture can become.  \n\nAt inception, a startup might be missing resources in three major areas: human capital, social capital, and financial capital (Sapienza et al., 2003). To fill those holes, “core founders\" can attract cofounders, hires, and/or investors. (As described in more detail below, early on, resource-attraction decisions are in the hands of the core founder—the person who had the initial idea and initiated founding activities.5 As other resource providers join the startup, they often gain a say in those decisions, either as terms of their ownership or through having a seat on the board of directors.) Cofounders and hires may bring new skills and industry knowledge, have contacts with customers or potential partners, and also contribute financial capital to help get the startup off the ground. Investors can contribute far more financial capital than the typical cofounder or hire but, as described below, may vary widely in the amount of other value they might add.  \n\nA core dilemma is that the startup's resource dependence drives a wedge between startup value and founder control. Each step of the entrepreneurial resource-attraction journey poses a tradeoff between attracting the resources required to build company value and being able to retain control of decision making. High-quality co-founders and non-founding hires should demand more equity and/or decision rights than will lesser co-founders and hires. The same is true of investors who can add the most value, compared to lower-value investors (for conceptual arguments, see Amit, Glosten, and Muller, 1990; for empirical evidence, see Hsu, 2004). Such investors want both to own a stake in the venture to gain from its growth in value and to protect their investments by having decision rights and influence through a board presence (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978).  \n\nThe more value that would be provided by the core founder, the more control s/he should be able to retain; the more value that would be provided by the other three resource providers, the less value that the core founder should be able to retain. On one side, core founders who have accumulated direct human capital in the form of prior founding experience (Sapienza et al., 2003) and have developed the social capital necessary to attract employees to the startup, should be able to keep more control (Wasserman, 2003). The other resource providers should have the opposite effect on control of the startup; in order to attract value-added resource providers, founders should have to give up a share of the venture's control and its future rents (Coff, 1999). For instance, less studied than investors—but still very important from a resource-dependence perspective——is the way in which cofounders and hires might affect control of the startup. In young businesses, there is a close relationship between human capital and the success of the startup, especially for human capital developed through actual work experience (Unger etal., 2011). Thus, the more cofounders who join the team, and the more experienced those cofounders, the more decision-making control the core founder should have to give up when attracting them.6 As the startup evolves, “the further into the start-up process one gets, the more specific and idiosyncratic will be the resources and information needed for further successful completion of the process\" (Davidsson and Honig, 2003: 302). Such human capital improves strategic planning, resource acquisition, and operational effectiveness (e.g., Brush et al., 2001; Shane and Venkataraman, 2000; Unger etal., 2011). Thus, the more experienced the non-founding hires, the more control the core founder should have to give up to attract them, too.  \n\nFinally, as a condition of investing capital in the company, outside investors will often require one or more board seats, in addition to receiving an ownership stake (Gorman and Sahlman, 1989).7 Outside investors need voting rights because of contractual incompleteness; they want to ensure that decisions and actions will maximize their financial returns. More specifically, investors need to protect themselves from problems caused by the fact that the entrepreneur can derive non-pecuniary benefits \"from control, access, and other non-contractible aspects of managing the venture” (Kirilenko, 2001: 566). In essence, the interests of the entrepreneur and of the investor can diverge because the investor cares about financial returns while the entrepreneur also enjoys private benefits of control (Aghion and Bolton, 1992; Grossman and Hart, 1988; Kaplan and Stromberg, 2003). Whenever founders and their resource providers disagree with each other, control rights become critical. Control comes in both ex ante form and ex post form, with ex ante control driven by board representation and ex post control indicated by whether the founder has been replaced as CEO (Hellmann, 1998). First, the board of directors controls the most important high-level decisions within the venture (Lerner, 1995). For instance, the board typically decides whether to make important changes in strategy, when and how to raise new rounds of financing, and whether to partner or merge with other corporations (Bagley and Dauchy, 2003). The board also controls who will be CEO of the company (Wasserman, 2003).  \n\nAs founders give up equity and board seats in order to attract investors, the founders’ percentage of board seats progressively decreases, until the point where the founders are a minority of board members and there is no longer “dominance of inside over outside directors on the board\" (Morck, Shleifer, and Vishny, 1988: 301).8 Founders are more willing to take weaker investment terms——most centrally, terms that affect these control rights——from venture capitalists than from other investors, such as angel investors (Hsu, 2004). For their part, angel investors provide much less capital than do venture capitalists (Gompers and Lerner, 1999; Wong, 2002), take smaller equity stakes than do VCs (Clercq et al., 2006), and rely on more informal methods of control than do VCs (Wong, Bhatia, and Freeman, 2009). Therefore, in startups that raise capital from venture capitalists, the core founder should retain less control than in startups that raise capital from angel investors.9  \n\nThis leads to the following hypotheses about the degree of control retained by the founder.  \n\nHypothesis 1a (Hla) (core founder): If the core founder has prior founding experience and if the core founder taps personal networks to attract employees, the founder will retain more control.  \n\nHypothesis 1b (Hlb) (cofounders): The larger the founding team and the more experienced the cofounders, the less control the founder will retain.  \n\nHypothesis 1c (Hlc) (non-founding executives): The more experienced the non-founding executives, theless control the founder will retain.  \n\nHypothesis 1d (Hld) (investors): Founders who raise capital from venture capitalists will retain less control.Founders who raise capital from angel investorswill retain morecontrol.  \n\n### Performance implications: Is there a tradeoff between autonomy and value creation?  \n\nThe CEO position exerts significant control over company decisions. This is particularly true for new ventures, which are just beginning to form and evolve, and in which every CEO decision seems to bear more pronounced weight (Aldrich and Fiol 1994). From a resource-dependence perspective, a board chooses the CEO who is most “capable of coping with the critical problems facing the organization\" (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978: 236). During the early days of the startup, a founder is often the best person to cope with those challenges: s/he came up with the idea, which was often based on the founder's expertise or sparked by the founder's prior employment experience (Bhide,20o0),and the managerial challenges are at the level of a technical project team rather than a multi-function company.  \n\nHowever, as the startup grows and changes, the founder often lacks the skills to address the next set of challenges. For instance, after product development has been completed and the product has to be marketed and sold to customers, the challenges shift from technical issues to building a multi-function company (Wasserman, 2003). At that point, a new CEO will often be more qualified to address the company's challenges and should be more effective at growing the value of the company, as was the case with Richard Williams at Wily (described above). In other words, a new CEO will be able to do things that the founder can't do. In addition, a new CEO might be able to do things that the founder won't do. For instance, founders might be constrained by their attachment to their initial ideas and strategies (Adomdza, 2008) or to their early employees (e.g., Wasserman and Fynn, 2007). They might fall prey to managerial conceit (March and Shapira, 1987), to the temptation to escalate their commitment (Schmidt and Calantone, 2002; Staw, 1981), or to overconfidence and complacency fostered by prior success (Miller, 1991). In such situations, a new CEO would be more effective at adjusting strategies or at changing the employee base to fit the company's new challenges.  \n\nAs decisions accumulate, they can lead to very different outcomes. At the control extreme, the founder consistently foregoes attracting resources, maximizing control but sacrificing value. The reasons why founders may make such choices include heterogeneous preferences for control or differing expectations about their ventures’ prospects.10 At the value-creation extreme, founders consistently attract valuable outside resources but risk losing control.11 In between these two extremes, founders may be able to keep a measure of control while building some value, but typically have to sacrifice some of each, and possibly large amounts of both.  \n\nCompanies use boards of directors to gain resources and minimize dependence (Pfeffer, 1972). Outside directors bring four major benefits: \"advice and counsel,” access to external channels of information, access to resources, and legitimacy (Hillman, Withers, and Collins, 2009; Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978). Founders who haven't raised capital from outside investors will control the entire board of directors and thus all board decisions, but will lack the “board capital\" (Hillman and Dalziel, 2003) that directors could contribute, and also lack the discipline that can come from their monitoring (Garg, 2013).  \n\nSome investors add few resources beyond their financial capital. Other investors, such as VCs, are known for “providing value-added services to their portfolio companies\" (Baker and Gompers, 2003: 571). More specifically, “their involvement includes service on the boards of firms in their portfolios, frequent informal visits, meetings with customers and suppliers, and active involvement in key personnel and strategic decisions.\" (Lerner, 1995: 302) As a result, VC backing can help grow larger companies (Baker and Gompers, 1999) and help improve long-term outcomes (Baker and Gompers, 2003). In one study, VC-backed companies went public more than four years sooner than did companies not backed by VCs (Baker and Gompers,  \n\n1999). Because the best VCs can add value—and board capital -founders are willing to take from them investment terms that are less founder-friendly (Hsu, 2004).  \n\nAlthough less studied, similar arguments suggest that there is a spectrum of value that can be added by the other types of resource providers attracted to startup coalitions. For instance, the larger the founding team, the higher the startup's growth (Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven, 1990) and the greater the company's revenues (Cooper and Bruno, 1977). Up to the point where an increase in team size can compromise outcomes (e.g., Horwitz and Horwitz, 2007), attracting cofounders and non-founding hires should help grow the value of the startup, but at the cost of imperiling control.12  \n\nAs a result, controlling for company age and other differences across startups, there should be a tradeoff between control and company value.  \n\nHypothesis $2(H2)$ : For a given startup, the value of the startupvaries inversely with the degree of controlretainedbyfounders.  \n\n### Does the tradeoff apply across the board, or to only some contingencies?  \n\nOn the one hand, these resource-dependence challenges may be stronger for different types of companies and in different contexts. Thus, it's possible that the tradeoff only applies to a subset of companies and that that subset is driving the results, rather than being significant across all situations. On the other hand, the tradeoff may be more universal, in that it applies across contingencies. To test these “contingent vs. universal' possibilities, I assess contingencies regarding what type of startup was founded and its evolution over time. First, the tradeoff may differ according to the degree to which the company's industry segment is capital intensive. Second, the tradeoff may differ between younger and older startups.  \n\nThe more capital-intensive the company, the more critical it may be to attract resources in order to grow value, and the more control the company should have to give up to attract those resources (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978). Within larger companies, at both the corporate and business-segment levels, high capital intensity can have a negative impact on performance (Misangyi et al., 2006). For instance, high capital intensity can constrain strategic choices, leading companies to choose short-term solutions over longer-term investments (Qu, Pinsonneault, and Oh, 2011). Startups in capital-intensive businesses have to invest more capital in product development and make other substantial investments in order to build the company. Such startups should have greater resource needs and thus may have to give up more control in order to attract those resources. Conversely, startups in low-capital-intensity businesses should be able to grow more value without having to give up a lot of control. This leads to the following contingent hypothesis:  \n\nHypothesis 3 (H3):The inverse relationship between company value and founder control will be strong in startups in more capital-intensive industry segments but not in startups in less capital-intensiveindustry segments.  \n\nDuring the early stages of founding, founders' skills are often better suited to the challenges faced by the young startup than to the challenges faced down the road. For instance, founders with technical or scientific backgrounds are well-suited to lead the initial product-development effort. However, as the startup's needs broaden beyond technical or scientific challenges, the founders’ skills are often less suited to those new challenges. In essence, these founder-CEOs have succeeded at achieving the key operating milestone of completing initial product development, but that very success has increased the divergence between founder abilities and startup needs (Wasserman, 2003).13 Thus, the need for——and potential impact of—attracting new skills should increase as the startup evolves. At the same time, attracting financial resources heightens the likelihood that the founder-CEO will be replaced by the board of directors (Boeker and Karichalil, 2002; Hellmann, 1998; Wasserman, 2003). Thus, the tradeoff may get stronger as the startup ages. This leads to the following contingent hypothesis:  \n\nHypothesis $4(H4)$ :Theinverse relationship between company value and founder control will get stronger as startups age.  \n\n## DATA AND METHODS  \n\nOne hurdle to the rigorous study of entrepreneurship is that “data are difficult to obtain\" (Shane and Venkataraman, 2000: 219). For this reason, much of the relevant work on the issues described above has been based on theoretical models (e.g., Aghion and Bolton, 1992; Hellmann, 1998; Kirilenko, 2001) or field-based interviews (e.g., Amit et al., 2000). Interviews can be invaluable for finding out entrepreneurs’ stated motives (Amit et al., 2000), especially as a complement to the “coarse grained\" methodologies used to study relatively mature theories (Edmondson and McManus, 2007; Harrigan, 1983). However, “we do not have, and it would be very difficult (if not impossible) to specify, the ‘true’ beliefs” of interviewed entrepreneurs (Amit etal., 2000: 139). Instead, strategies may best be inferred by observing “realized strategies\" (Mintzberg and Waters, 1982: 466) and observable, concrete decisions (Hambrick and Mason, 1984). Thus, in my data collection, I focus on the actual decisions made during the founding process—-e.g., how many founders there were, which non-founders were on the executive team, whether the startup raised outside capital and from whom, etc.  \n\nMy data come from the annual CompStudy survey of private American ventures. The first CompStudy survey was conducted in 2000 and focused on private information-technology ventures (broadly defined, including telecommunications). Two years later a parallel survey of life-sciences ventures was added, and since then, annual surveys of both industries have been conducted. In 2005, the section about founders was enhanced, and I use all data collected between 2005 and 2012. The full dataset includes 6,130 startups that were founded by a total of 16,500 founders. On the one hand, the dataset is limited to a single country, to two industries within that country, and to a specific time period, and therefore may not apply in other contexts. On the other hand, the technology and life-sciences industries are by far the largest industries for American high-potential startups, accounting for more than two-thirds of the angel capital and venture capital invested during the time period, and accounting for nearly half of the initial public offerings (with no other industry accounting for more than $12\\%$ of the IPOs).14 In addition, the survey time period includes startups that were founded across all stages of two major business cycles, with the vast majority of startups in the dataset founded across the boom of the late 1990s, the bust of the early 2000s, the subsequent uptick in the mid-2000s, and then the deep recession from 2009 onwards, giving us the ability to assess whether the tradeoff I examine pertains to only parts of the business cycle or across it.  \n\nInvitations to participate in the survey are sent to the membership lists of local technology and life-sciences associations (e.g., the Massachusetts High-Technology Council), the list of private companies from the VentureXpert database, and similar databases. The invitations are sent to the CEOs and CFOs, who are offered a free copy of a detailed “CompStudy Compensation Report” based on the survey results and available only to participants.15 Because the market for executive talent varies over time, companies usually want current data on executive compensation, so they have an incentive to participate even if they have already participated in the past. Over the last decade, CompStudy's annual compensation reports have become a standard reference for executive teams in private American ventures and for board members and investors involved in those ventures. Each year, survey response rates vary between 10 and 20 percent, higher than the typical response rates for surveys targeting similar levels of executives (e.g., Graham and Harvey, 2001) and for the sensitivity of the questions asked (e.g., about private-company financing history and performance, and about executive compensation and equity stakes). The surveys are conducted online and fields are validated as data are entered. When possible, data are cross-checked with publicly-available information to check accuracy and representativeness.  \n\nFor comparison, VentureXpert (formerly Venture Economics） is one of the most commonly used sources of data for research on high-potential startups (e.g., Gompers, 1995; Lerner, 1995; Sorenson and Stuart, 2008).16 VentureXpert is compiled by Thomson Economics and provides data on venture capital and other early-stage funding for companies. It provides each company's financing history, location, and related information. However, it does not provide many of the data points needed for the current study—e.g., founder and non-founder backgrounds, executive compensation and equity holdings, and levels of control retained by the founders—and focuses on a more limited set of startups (those that have raised institutional capital, in contrast to CompStudy, which also includes pre-funding ventures). It is instructive to compare the distributions of companies within the two datasets. I compared the CompStudy sample to the VentureXpert sample on the three dimensions on which they can be compared: geographic distribution, industry, and founding year. First, the two datasets almost match regarding the percentage of startups from each state in the country, with the exception that CompStudy has a few more firms in Massachusetts and fewer in California. (Further details are available from the author.) Regarding industry breakdown, CompStudy is more balanced, with 65.2 percent of the CompStudy firms coming from high technology compared to 79.1 percent of the VentureXpert firms. Regarding founding year, VentureXpert has a higher proportion of companies from before 2000, and is much more influenced by companies founded in 1999 than is CompStudy. Otherwise their distributions are similar.17  \n\nFor two of the metrics within the founding team, we can compare CompStudy to the data from another study. Although more targeted, in that it focused on MIT startups alone, Hsu, Roberts, and Eesley (2007) also surveyed high-potential startups. They reported an average of 2.86 founders per team. My dataset has 2.70 founders per team. In Hsu et al. (2007), 46 percent of the entrepreneurial teams had no prior startup experience. In my sample, 53 percent of the core founders had no prior startup experience.  \n\nThe CompStudy survey design enables us to get data on companies at a very early stage in their development. The data should thus be less susceptible to survivor bias than samples of public companies, or even than samples of venture capital-backed companies (e.g., VentureXpert). Even so, because the surveys ask questions about decisions that occurred months or years earlier, they may be susceptible to retrospective bias. The first way I reduced this bias was by asking relatively objective questions whenever possible; e.g., instead of asking, \"How much leverage did the founders have when raising their first round of outside capital? I asked \"How many board seats did the founders retain after raising their first round of outside capital?' Second, many companies participated in multiple years, enabling comparison of initial submissions to later surveys. As described below, I also used the multiple responses from repeat respondents to perform fixed-effects analyses that control for unobserved time-invariant company characteristics.  \n\n### Dependent and independent variables  \n\nThe initial hypotheses (Hla-d) examine the degree of control retained by founders. Following Hellmann (1998), I measure control at two levels:  \n\ncontrol of the CEO position (is the founder still the CEO?) and control of the board of directors (do the founders and inside executives have more than half of the seats on the board of directors?). In the core models, I used a discrete ordinal “control index' that ranges from O to $2\\colon0$ if the founders control neither the CEO position nor the board of directors, 1 if they control one but not the other, and 2 if they control both the CEO position and the board of directors. In robustness tests, and to examine whether either of the two arenas of control is the real driver of the results, I also reran the models using separate binary variables for each of those two arenas of control. The core results were the same as in the models using the control index. I also reran those models using the percentage of the board controlled by the founders, rather than using the binary metric of board control that was used to calculate the control-index variable. Again, the results were the same as in the core models.  \n\nHypotheses 2-4 focus on the tradeoff between the value of the company and the degree of founder control. I use two different metrics to estimate the value of the company: most recent company valuation and total amount of capital raised. My core metric is pre-money valuation of the company at the most recent round of financing (e.g., Gompers et al., 2010; Hsu, 2004), calculated as the price per share in the financing round times the number of shares outstanding prior to the round. The second metric for company value is the total amount of capital raised by the startup since founding, including all rounds of financing through the time of the survey.18 Both variables were log-normally distributed, so I use the natural log of each variable. To allow for the companies that had not raised any capital as of the time of the survey, I added 1 to the capital-raised metric before taking its natural logarithm. To account for missing data in the survey, I used multiple-imputation methods (Rubin, 1987).  \n\nRegarding independent variables, the models include an indicator of whether the core founder had prior founding experience and whether the core founder tapped social networks to attract executive hires, while controlling for the core founder's years of prior work experience.19 For the founding team, the models include the size of the founding team and the founding team's total years of prior work experience. Value may also be affected by the founders’ initial capital investments in the startup, which I aggregate across the founding team. I include three aspects for non-founding executives: their years of prior work experience, the number of executives who in prior work were the senior-most executives within their functions, and the average compensation of the executives (as another metric of the quality of the executives). I also control for the executives’ equity stakes.20 The amount of capital raised may be affected by the source of financing—the founders themselves, angel investors, or venture capitalists —— so I include dummy variables for each of those three sources. Larger boards of directors can add more resources, but can also be less effective because of diffused responsibility, because of increased agency problems (e.g., free riding by directors), or because the board becomes more symbolic than effective (e.g., Eisenberg, Sundgren, and Wells, 1998; Jensen, 1993; Yermack, 1996). Therefore, I also controlled for the size of the board, allowing for curvilinear effects on value creation. Regarding the startup's location, more valuable ventures may be created in startup “hubs” that have plentiful startup resources, so I controlled for whether the startup is located in a hub (i.e., CA or MA, the hubs of the American startup scene), a secondary market (IL, NJ, NY, or TX), or in smaller markets. To assess capital intensity, I categorized each startup's business segment into the three segments with the highest capital intensity and the three segments with the lowest capital intensity, based on the capital-intensity ratings published in the IBISWorld industry reports.21  \n\nTo assess the macroeconomic conditions at time of founding, I categorized each startup's year of founding into boom, middling (neither boom not bust), or bust eras.22  \n\n### Methods  \n\nIn the multivariate models testing Hypotheses 2-4, the core analyses use fixed-effects models with (log of) company valuation as the dependent variable. Of the 6,130 companies that participated in the survey, 49 percent participated more than one time, enabling me to use their responses in the fixed-effects analyses; using company-level fixed effects reduces the risk of omitted-variable bias by allowing us to control for the unobservable time-invariant characteristics of each firm. Robustness tests included fixed-effects models with (log of) capital raised as an alternate metric of value creation, and ordinary-least-squares models (without fixed effects) using all surveys (not just those that were repeat respondents), inversely weighting each survey by the number of surveys submitted by that company. Standard errors were clustered at the firm level. I also performed robustness tests of the functional forms of several variables (e.g., company age, number of founders, macroeconomic conditions, capital intensity) in which I replaced the variable of interest with dummy variables capturing each possible level of the variable or with the raw underlying levels (for composite variables). In all robustness tests, the core results were the same as in the models shown.  \n\nI compared the initial responses of repeat respondents to the initial (sole) responses of non-repeaters to see if there were significant differences. The 95 percent confidence intervals overlapped regarding company valuation, number of employees, company age, the founder's prior years of work experience, whether the core founder had prior founding experience, and how much seed capital the founders invested. The biggest differences were in the degree of control the founders had retained (in repeat respondents, the founders had a little less control when the company's initial survey was completed) and in the size of the founding team (in repeat respondents, the founding teams were a little bigger). Despite these differences, as described below, the core results regarding my hypotheses were the same across both the all-companies and fixed-effects (i.e., repeat respondent only) models.  \n\nTo test Hypothesis 3, I wanted to see whether firms with differing levels of capital intensity face different tradeoffs between control and value created. I interacted dummy variables indicating whether the firm had low capital intensity or high capital intensity. This yielded equivalent regression coefficients to estimating the core model twice—once restricting the sample to firms with low capital intensity and once to firms with high capital intensity—while still being able to use all data points in the model (instead, the separate restricted models would each have about one-half the observations). Combining these regressions into one regression also enables us to test the difference between the coefficient on control for the different types of firms. Two questions are of particular interest in these analyses: (1) Is the control index still significant? (2) Are the new interaction terms significant, suggesting support for the contingency-specific hypothesis? (If the interaction terms are not significant, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the tradeoff applies across contingencies.) I performed similar analyses to test Hypothesis 4 about startup age.  \n\n## RESULTS  \n\nTable 1 shows summary statistics and a correlation matrix. On average the 6,130 companies were founded by 2.7 founders. The median number of full-time-equivalent employees was 26. The companies had raised a median of $\\$7$ million in capital and were a median of 5.9 years old. The core founders averaged 17years of prior work experience and 47 percent had prior founding experience. Of the prior rounds of financing, 17 percent included founder capital, 28 percent included angel investors, and 71 percent included venture capitalists. Regarding control of the company, in 49 percent of the companies a founder was still CEO, in 21 percent of the companies the insiders controlled more than half of the seats on the board of directors, and in 41 percent of the companies the founders owned more than half of the company's equity.23 Geographically, 32 percent of the startups were located in California, 18 percent in Massachusetts, and 13 percent in the four “secondary' states.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"11\">266 N.Wasserman</td></tr><tr><td>Table 1.</td><td colspan=\"7\">Summary statistics and correlation

Histograms of independent variables available from author.  \n\nTable 2 analyzes the degree of control retained by founders. Tables 3 and 4 test Hypothesis 2, and Tables 5 and 6 examine Hypotheses 3 and 4 about whether the tradeoff is driven by contingencies.  \n\nTable 2 highlights variables that are significantly associated with control, using three metrics of control. Models 1-3 show the analyses using the control index (which combines CEO control and board control) as the dependent variable and Models 4-5 compare those results to separate analyses using each of CEO control and Board control. Most centrally, the results in Models 1-3 suggest that founder control is affected by decisions made throughout the evolution of the startup, including the prior experience accumulated by the core founder, cofounder decisions, hiring decisions, and financing decisions. In particular, founders retain more control when they have prior founding experience $(\\mathtt{p}<0.05)$ and when they attracted executive hires themselves $(\\mathtt{p}<0.01)$ . These results support Hypothesis 1a. Founders have less control when there were more cofounders $(\\mathtt{p}<0.05)$ ，but the years of prior work experience of the cofounders does not affect control, providing only mixed support for Hypothesis 1b. Founders have less control when their hires have more years of work experience $(\\mathtt{p}<0.01)$ , supporting Hypothesis 1c. Finally, founders have less control when the last round of investment included venture capitalists $(\\mathtt{p}<0.01)$ and more control when their last round of financing included angel investors $(\\mathtt{p}<0.01)$ , supporting Hypothesis 1d. In summary, three of the hypotheses about founder control were strongly supported, and the fourth was partially supported. The additional analyses in Models 4-5 suggest that there is one significant divergence between the CEO-control and board-control models (the mean equity stake of executive hires has a significant negative impact on CEO control but a significant positive impact on board control) but that otherwise the two metrics of control are relatively aligned with each other.  \n\nTable 3 shows the core models of the tradeoff between value and control, using pre-money valuation as the dependent variable. Models 1-5 use fixed effects for all repeat respondents and Model 6 uses all surveys from each participating company (inversely weighted by number of surveys per company). In Models 1-5, the relationship between control index and valuation is consistently negative and highly significant (all $\\mathrm{p}<0.01\\$ ), even with the fixed effects accounting for time-invariant characteristics and control variables accounting for firm age and varying employee and investor characteristics. In the full fixed-effects model, each one-unit increase in the control index (i.e., from no control to control of either the CEO position or the board, or from control of the CEO position or the board to control of both) decreases company value by 17.1 percent.24 In Model 6, the control index is once again significant at the $\\mathrm{p}<0.01$ level in each model; each one-unit increase in the control index decreases company value by 22.0 percent.25 As a whole, these results provide strong support for Hypothesis 2.  \n\nTable 4 shows the auxiliary models of the tradeoff between value and control, using capital raised as the dependent variable. Once again, Models 1-5 use fixed-effects for all repeat respondents and Model 6 shows the all-responses (inversely weighted) models. In the fixed-effects models, the relationship between control and value creation is consistently negative at the $\\mathrm{p}<0.01$ level. In the full fixed-effects model (Model 5), each one-unit increase in the control index decreases capital raised by 35.8 percent.26 In Model 6, the relationship between control and capital raised is again consistently negative and highly significant (all $\\mathrm{p}<0.01;$ ; each one-unit increase in the control index decreases company value by 51.4 percent.27  \n\nTable 2.

By focusing on changes within each firm over time, the empirical results are driven by firm decisions about control and resource attraction rather than initial firm quality. As an additional robustness check, to see if similar empirical results are found when making comparisons across firms, I used inverse-probability weighting (IPW) and regression adjustment (RA) analyses (e.g., Imbens and Wooldridge, 2009; Rubin, 1973). IPW estimators use estimated probability weights to assess what the mean outcome would have been if every firm in the population received a particular treatment. The RA estimators take a more fine-grained approach, comparing outcome predictions for each firm under all treatment assignments (Cattane0, 2010; StataCorp, 2013).29  \n\nI performed these analyses for both the valuation and capital-raised dependent variables, and for control-index gradations of moving from no control to one measure of control (CEO or board), and from one measure of control to full control. Table 7 compares the core fixed-effects results to the IPW and RA estimates. Seven of the eight IPW and RA estimates are within two standard errors of the fixed-effects estimates, suggesting further support for the core results. (The eighth estimate is 2.03 standard errors away.)  \n\nComparing the coefficients from Table 2 (control) and Table 3 (value creation) helps us highlight resources that have very different effects on the tradeoff between control and value creation. First, involving venture capitalists in the startup has an extreme impact on each DV, in conflicting ways: It has a very significant negative relationship with founder control (Table 2) but a very significant positive relationship with company valuation (Table 3). The opposite pattern is seen with angel capital and founder capital: They both have a significant positive relationship with control (Table 2) but a significant negative relationship with company valuation (Table 3). In this sense, these very different types of resource providers are microcosms of the overall control dilemma examined here. Interestingly, the core founder's characteristics is one area where the control dilemma does not seem to apply: By accumulating prior founding experience and tapping social networks to find executive hires, the founder has higher control but the company's valuation is higher, too. The “dilemma profiles” of these very different resource providers are thus summarized in Table 8.  \n\n## DISCUSSION  \n\nEntrepreneurs embarking on a founding journey face a wide range of early decisions. The effects of these early founding decisions can have powerful, long-term imprinting effects on the subsequent evolution of their organizations (Bettis and Prahalad, 1995; Boeker, 1989). 1 have delved into how one specific type of decision—-regarding the resources they attract to their companies——can have a powerful effect on the growth of the company and on the founders? ability to maintain control of it. At the beginning of the founding journey, the vast majority of entrepreneurs are missing key resources (Evans and Jovanovic, 1989) in the form of financial capital, human capital, and/or social capital. By attracting those resources, founders have a better chance of growing a more valuable company. For instance, by attracting cofounders, hires, or investors, founders can access skills, contacts, and money they were lacking. However, attracting those resources can come at a stiff cost: the imperiling of the founders' control of the company they created, introducing a difficult “control dilemma” for founders.  \n\nThe results of this study suggest that, within high-potential startups, the tension between resource attraction and the maintenance of control is real and significant, and that early founding decisions can lead to very different outcomes regarding both value creation and control. These results are robust across two different forms of value creation and across econometric approaches that both (1) use fixed effects to account for unobserved time-invariant company differences and (2) control for individual- and company-level differences. Not only are these results statistically significant, but from a practical perspective, a one-step change in control (from controlling both the CEO position and the board, to controlling only one, or from that to controlling neither) is associated with a 17.1-22.0 percent change in company valuation (and an even bigger change in capital raised). In short, Lew Cirne of Wily Technology is not alone in facing a tradeoff between “remaining parent of my baby” and having others raise the child more successfully, or between maintaining control versus growing the value of the startup he founded. The tradeoff seems to apply regardless of capital intensity and to get stronger as the startup ages, reinforcing the powerful tradeoff founders face at each step of the founding journey.30  \n\nThese results have implications not only for founders, but also for potential resource providers, such as hires and investors considering involvement in a young company. These potential resource providers would not enjoy the fruits of the entrepreneur's private benefits of control. Instead, the resource providers——especially return-maximizing investors ——- are likely to be more interested in value creation, and thus be much more aligned with founders who are similarly driven. Such resource providers need to do due diligence on founders in order to understand their motivations and how they might influence the decisions they make when facing a tradeoff between control and value creation. Amit et al. (2000: 139) report that, \"Two of our subjects volunteered information that they had problems obtaining financing because the venture capitalists felt they were not focused enough on potential monetary gains from the venture.\"’ Hires and investors who pay attention to the founder's likely decisions only after they have become involved will face deeper (and more costly) misalignment with control-oriented founders than if they had filtered out such founders from the beginning and instead selected founders focused on value creation.  \n\nTable 7.

For one, the results help us resolve the “puzzle” posed by Moskowitz and Vissing-Jorgensen (2002)—and a similar finding by Hamilton (2000)—regarding their “missing private-equity premium.\" For instance, Hamilton (2000) found that entrepreneurs make less from their startups than they could make in paid employment. I find that companies in which founders remain in control are likely to be less valuable, as suggested by the overall results in Hamilton (2000)  and  Moskowitz and  Vissing-Jorgensen (2002), but that the opposite is true in other companies, a fact that is lost amidst the inability of those studies to measure founder control. Entrepreneurs whose founding decisions prioritize maintaining control of the startup should indeed grow less value than the entrepreneurs whose founding decisions prioritize the attraction of value-added resources. In fact, for the latter group of entrepreneurs, it's possible that we might find the opposite result as the one found when analyzing entrepreneurs as a whole: They may indeed make more from their startups than they could in paid employment. Rather than looking broadly at all entrepreneurs, we should take a more nuanced view of the population of entrepreneurs, examining how different founding decisions can lead to very different outcomes, not only regarding value created but also regarding whether the founder remains in control.  \n\nThis study focuses on the company level of analysis, assessing how control affects company value. Resource-attraction decisions may also have an effect at the founder level of analysis—i.e., on the value of the founder's ownership stake in the company, a level of analysis that deserves attention in future research. This study also focuses on founders’ revealed preferences: their actual decisions that should affect the value they create and the control they maintain. However, the values and motivations of an organization's most powerful actors can have a strong impact on its strategic choices, particularly regarding the attraction and allocation of resources (Hambrick and Mason, 1984; Tagiuri, 1965). Future research—possibly using “finer grained” qualitative methodologies to complement the quantitative methods used here (Harrigan, 1983)—could delve into how a founder's motivations affect founding decisions, thus infuencing control vs. value-creation outcomes. Power and economic motivations often dominate executive decision making (e.g., Tagiuri, 1965). For entrepreneurs in particular, Sapienza et al. (2003: 106) argue that “wealth maximization and self-determination are the two primary motives driving entrepreneurial financing choices.' However, not all entrepreneurs start ventures to get wealthy (Amit etal., 2000: 120); among MIT alumni initiating high-technology ventures, independence (\"being own boss\") and challenge were more important motivators than financial gain (Roberts, 1988, 1991). Instead, researchers argue, such entrepreneurs are motivated by the chance to play a central role in driving and controlling the growth of the company they founded (e.g., Begley and Boyd, 1987; Carland etal., 1984). The key for this study isn't the particular ordering of the control and value-creation motivations, but that they can confict and might lead to very different outcomes. Furthermore, for founders who are clearly motivated by either independence or financial gains, the decisions they should make are much clearer than for founders with mixed motivations.  \n\nRisk is another important factor in these founder decisions. On the one hand, resource scarcity increases the firm's risk (Keats and Hitt, 1988) and should exacerbate the liability of newness (Stinchcombe, 1965). However, firm demise is not the only risk faced by founders; many founders may also worry about the risk of losing control of the idea they conceived and the company they birthed, leading them to avoid attracting resources.31 Future research could examine the risk profiles of each of these paths and how they should affect resource decisions. Risk also affects the value of capital investments via its impact on option values (Abel et al.,1996; McDonald and Siegel, 1986), which can be a substantial portion of the value of an entrepreneurial venture (Dixit and Pindyck, 1995). Furthermore, although attracting outside resources may increase company survival, bringing investors into the startup can increase the pressure to “swing for the fences\"——to ratchet up the growth, usually increasing the risk of complete failure. Replacing a founder-CEO—especially  one unhappy with losing control—may also heighten risks for the company. For these reasons, a founder's refusal to attract outside resources and to remain CEO may instead reduce risks for the company. Research that examines these competing types of risk can help shed further light on this tradeoff.  \n\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  \n\nThank you to Ben Esty, Teresa Amabile, Lynda Applegate, Matt Marx, Tom Eisenmann, Bill Kerr, Sam Garg, Magnus Torfason, Tom Nicholas, and seminar participants at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and at the University of Southern California for their invaluable comments on early drafts of the paper.

We analyze the effect of the increase in industrial robot usage between 1990 and 2007 on US local labor markets. Using a model in which robots compete against human labor in the production of different tasks, we show that robots may reduce employment and wages, and that the local labor market effects of robots can be estimated by regressing the change in employment and wages on the exposure to robots in each local labor market—defined from the national penetration of robots into each industry and the local distribution of employment across industries. Using this approach, we estimate large and robust negative effects of robots on employment and wages across commuting zones. We bolster this evidence by showing that the commuting zones most exposed to robots in the post-1990 era do not exhibit any differential trends before 1990. The impact of robots is distinct from the impact of imports from China and Mexico, the decline of routine jobs, offshoring, other types of IT capital, and the total capital stock (in fact, exposure to robots is only weakly correlated with these other variables). According to our estimates, one more robot per thousand workers reduces the employment to population ratio by about 0.18-0.34 percentage points and wages by 0.25-0.5 percent.  \n\nDaron Acemoglu   \nDepartment of Economics, E52-446   \nMIT   \n77 Massachusetts Avenue   \nCambridge, MA 02139   \nand CIFAR   \nand also NBER   \ndaron $@$ mit.edu   \nPascual Restrepo   \nDepartment of Economics   \nBoston University   \n270 Bay State Rd   \nBoston, MA 02215   \nand Cowles Foundation, Yale   \npascual.restrepo $@$ yale.edu  \n\n# 1 INTRODUCTION  \n\nIn 1930, John Maynard Keynes famously predicted the rapid technological progress of the next 90 years, but also conjectured that “We are being afficted with a new disease of which some readers may not have heard the name, but of which they will hear a great deal in the years to comenamely, technological unemployment\" (Keynes, 1930). More than two decades later, Wassily Leontief would foretell similar problems for workers writing “Labor will become less and less important...More and more workers will be replaced by machines. I do not see that new industries can employ everybody who wants a job'\" (Leontief, 1952). Though these predictions did not come to pass in the decades that followed, there is renewed concern that with the striking advances in automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence, we are on the verge of seeing them realized (e.g., Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2012; Ford, 2016). The mounting evidence that the automation of a range of low-skill and medium-skill occupations has contributed to wage inequality and employment polarization (e.g., Autor, Levy and Murnane, 2003; Goos and Manning, 2007; Michaels, Natraj and Van Reenen, 2014) adds to these worries.  \n\nThese concerns notwithstanding, we have little systematic evidence of the equilibrium impact of these new technologies, and especially of robots, on employment and wages. One line of research investigates how feasible it is to automate existing jobs given current and presumed technological advances. Based on the tasks that workers perform, Frey and Osborne (2013), for instance, classify 702 occupations by how susceptible they are to automation. They conclude that over the next two decades, 47 percent of US workers are at risk of automation. Using a related methodology, McKinsey puts the same number at 45 percent, while the World Bank estimates that 57 percent of jobs in the OECD could be automated over the next two decades (World Development Report, 2016). Even if these studies were on target on what is technologically feasible,1 these numbers do not correspond to the equilibrium impact of automation on employment and wages. First, even if the presumed technological advances materialize, there is no guarantee that firms would choose to automate; that would depend on the costs of substituting machines for labor and how much wages change in response to this threat. Second, the labor market impacts of new technologies depend not only on where they hit but also on the adjustment in other parts of the economy. For example, other sectors and occupations might expand to soak up the labor freed from the tasks that are now performed by machines, and productivity improvements due to new machines may even expand employment in affected  \n\nindustries (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2016).  \n\nIn this paper we move beyond these feasibility studies and estimate the equilibrium impact of one type of automation technology, industrial robots, on local US labor markets. The International Federation of Robotics—IFR for short—defines an industrial robot as “an automatically controlled, reprogrammable, and multipurpose [machine]\" (IFR, 2014). That is, industrial robots are fully autonomous machines that do not need a human operator and that can be programmed to perform several manual tasks such as welding, painting, assembling, handling materials, or packaging. Textile looms, elevators, cranes, transportation bands or coffee makers are not industrial robots as they have a unique purpose, cannot be reprogrammed to perform other tasks, and/or require a human operator.2 Although this definition excludes other types of capital that may also replace labor (most notably software and other machines), it enables an internationally and temporally comparable measurement of a class of technologies-industrial robots-that are capable of replacing human labor in a range of tasks.  \n\nIndustrial robots are argued to have already deeply impacted the labor market and are expected to transform it in the decades to come (e.g., Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2012; Ford, 2016). Indeed, between 1993 and 2007 the stock of robots in the United States and Western Europe increased fourfold. As Figure 1 shows, in the United States the increase amounted to one new industrial robot for every thousand workers and in Western Europe to 1.6 new industrial robots for every thousand workers. The IFR estimates that there are currently between 1.5 and 1.75 million industrial robots in operation, a number that could increase to 4 to 6 million by 2025 (see Boston Consulting Group, 2015). The automotive industry employs 39 percent of existing industrial robots, followed by the electronics industry (19 percent), metal products (9 percent), and the plastic and chemicals industry (9 percent).  \n\nTo motivate our analysis, we start with a simple model where robots and workers compete in the production of different tasks. Our model builds on Acemoglu and Autor (2011) and Acemoglu and Restrepo (2016), but extends these frameworks so that the share of tasks performed by robots varies across industries and there is trade between labor markets specializing in different industries. Greater penetration of robots into the economy affects wages and employment negatively because of a displacement effect (by directly displacing workers from tasks they were previously performing), but also positively because of a productivity effect (as other industries and/or tasks increase their demand for labor). Our model shows that the impact of robots on employment and wages in a labor market can be estimated by regressing the change in these variables on the ecposure to robots, a measure defined as the sum over industries of the national penetration of robots into each industry times the baseline employment share of that industry in the labor market. These specifications form the basis of our empirical investigation.  \n\nOur empirical work focuses on local labor markets in the United States, which we proxy by commuting zones.3 We construct our measure of exposure to robots using data from the IFR on the increase in robot usage in 19 industries (roughly at the two-digit level outside manufacturing and at the three-digit level within manufacturing) and their baseline employment shares from the Census before the onset of recent robotic advances. Our measure of exposure to robots leverages the fact that commuting zones vary in their distribution of industrial employment, making some commuting zones more exposed to the use of robots than others.  \n\nA major concern with our empirical strategy is that the adoption of robots in a given US industry could be related to other trends affecting that industry or to economic conditions in the commuting zones that specialize in that industry. Both possibilities would confound the impact of robots. To address this concern, we use the industry-level spread of robots in other advanced economies—meant to proxy improvements in the world technology frontier of robots—as an instrument for the adoption of robots in US industries. This strategy is similar to that used by Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2013) and Bloom, Draca and Van Reenen (2015) to estimate the impact of Chinese imports. Though not a panacea for all sources of omitted variable bias, this strategy allows us to focus on the variation that results solely from industries in which the use of robots has been concurrent in most advanced economies.4 Moreover, because IFR industrylevel data starts in 2004 in the United States, but in 1993 in several European countries, this instrumental-variables approach enables us to estimate the impact of industrial robots over a longer period of time.  \n\nto robots and its post-1990 labor market outcomes. In the most exposed areas, between 1990 and 2007 both employment and wages decline in a robust and significant manner (compared to other less exposed areas). Quantitatively, our estimates imply that the increase in the stock of robots (approximately one new robot per thousand workers from 1993 to 2007) reduced the employment to population ratio in a commuting zone with the average US exposure to robots by 0.37 percentage points, and average wages by 0.73 percent, relative to a commuting zone with no exposure to robots. These numbers are large but not implausible.5 For example, they imply that one more robot in a commuting zone reduces employment by 6.2 workers, which is consistent with case study evidence on the relative productivity of robots, as we discuss below.  \n\nTo understand the aggregate implications of these estimates, we need to make additional assumptions about how different commuting zones interact and on whether to focus on the entire decline in employment or just the part in industries most exposed to robots. If we focus on the entire decline in employment and assume, unrealistically, that commuting zones are closed economies without any interactions, the numbers in the above paragraph also give us the aggregate effects of robots on US employment and wages. However, in practice, the more intensive use of robots in a commuting zone reduces the costs of the products now produced using robots in the entire US economy, and thus trigger some expansion of employment and wages in other commuting zones. Our model, by incorporating trade between commuting zones, enables us to quantify this effect. Our estimates incorporating these trade interactions imply somewhat smaller negative employment effects and considerably smaller negative wage effects from robots. The exact magnitudes now depend on the elasticities of substitution between different products and between goods produced in different commuting zones, on the amount of cost savings from robots and on the elasticity of the labor supply. Nevertheless, for reasonable variations of these parameters, the implied magnitudes remain negative and sizable. With our preferred choice of parameters, the estimates imply that one more robot per thousand workers reduces aggregate employment to population ratio by about 0.34 percentage points (or equivalently one new robot reducing employment by 5.6 workers as opposed to 6.2 workers without trade) and wages by about 0.5 percent (as opposed to 0.73 percent without trade). Finally, if we just focus on the decline in industries most exposed to robots (and thus presume that negative effects in some of the other industries are due to other factors such as local demand spillovers), the aggregate effects can be as low as one more robot per thousand workers reducing aggregate employment to population ratio by about 0.18 percentage points (or equivalently one new robot reducing employment by 3 workers) and aggregate wages by about 0.25 percent.  \n\nTo bolster confidence in our interpretation, we show that our estimates remain negative and significant when we control for broad industry composition (including shares of manufacturing, durables, and construction), for detailed demographics, and for competing factors impacting workers in commuting zones—in particular, exposure to imports from China (as in Autor, Dorn and Hanson, 2013), exposure to imports from Mexico, the decline in routine jobs following the use of software to perform information processing tasks (as in Autor and Dorn, 2013), and offshoring of intermediate inputs (based on Feenstra and Hanson, 1999; and Wright, 2014). We also document that our measure of exposure to robots is unrelated to past trends in employment and wages from 1970 to 1990, a period that preceded the onset of rapid advances in robotics technology circa 1990.  \n\nSeveral robustness checks further support our interpretation. First, we find no similar negative impact from other measures of IT and capital (thus partly motivating our focus on robots). Second, we show that the automobile industry, which uses the largest number of robots per worker, is not driving our results. Third, we document that the results are robust to including differential trends by various baseline characteristics, linear commuting zone trends, and potentially mean-reverting dynamics in employment and wages.  \n\nWe also document that the employment effects of robots are most pronounced in manufacturing, and in particular, in industries most exposed to robots; in routine manual, blue collar, assembly and related occupations; and for workers with less than college education. Interestingly, and perhaps surprisingly, we do not find positive and offsetting employment gains in any occupation or education groups. We further document that the effects of robots on men and women are similar, though the impact on male employment is more negative.  \n\nBesides the papers that we have already mentioned, our work is related to the empirical literature on the effects of technology on wage inequality (Katz and Murphy, 1992), employment polarization (Autor, Levy and Murnane, 2003; Goos and Manning, 2007; Autor and Dorn, 2013; Michaels, Natraj and Van Reenen, 2014), aggregate employment (Autor, Dorn and Hanson, 2015; Gregory, Salomons and Zierahn, 2016), the demand for labor across cities (Beaudry, Doms and Lewis, 2006), and firms’ organization and demand for workers with different skills (Caroli and Van Reenen, 2001, Bartel, Ichniowski, and Shaw, 2007, and Acemoglu et al., 2007).  \n\nMost closely related to our work is the pioneering paper by Graetz and Michaels (2015). Focusing on the variation in robot usage across industries in different countries, they estimate that industrial robots increase productivity and wages, but reduce the employment of low-skill workers. Although we rely on the same data, we use a different empirical strategy, which enables us to go beyond cross-country, cross-industry comparisons, exploit plausibly exogenous changes in the spread of robots, and estimate the equilibrium impact of robots on local labor markets. Our micro data also enable us to control for detailed demographic and compositional variables when focusing on commuting zones, check the validity of our exclusion restrictions with placebo exercises, and study the impact of robots on industry and occupation-level outcomes, bolstering the plausibility of our estimates.  \n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a simple model of the effect of robots on employment and wages, which both clarifies the main economic forces and enables us to derive two simple equations, summarizing the theoretical relationship between changes in employment and wages and robots. These equations are then mapped to data in Section 3. Section 4 introduces the various data sources we use in our analysis, provides descriptive statistics, and also describes the relationship between the use of robots at the industry level across nine European countries and the United States, which is the basis of the first-stage relationship and reduced-form models we will estimate. Section 5 presents our empirical results. Section 6 concludes, while the Appendix presents proofs, additional theoretical results especially useful in interpreting our empirical findings when there are trade links between commuting zones, and various further robustness checks to our empirical results.  \n\n# 2 ROBOTS, EMPLOYMENT AND WAGES: A MODEL  \n\nIn this section, we present a model building on Acemoglu and Restrepo (2016) to exposit the potential effects of robots on employment and wages, and derive our estimating equations for the empirical analysis. To build intuition, we first ignore any interaction between local labor markets (commuting zones), and then enrich this framework by introducing trade between commuting zones. Our trade model can be viewed as combining the frameworks of Armington (1969) and Anderson (1979) with our modeling of robots (see also Caliendo and Parro, 2015, and Burstein et al., 2017).  \n\n## 2.1  Robots in Autarky Equilibrium  \n\nThe economy consists of $|{\\mathcal{C}}|$ commuting zones. Each commuting zone $c\\in{\\mathcal{C}}$ has preferences defined over an aggregate of the consumption of the output of $|\\mathcal{T}|$ industries, given by  \n\n$$\nY_{c}=\\left(\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{I}}\\alpha_{i}Y_{c i}^{\\frac{\\sigma-1}{\\sigma}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma-1}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\sigma>0$ denotes the elasticity of substitution across goods produced in different industries, while the $\\alpha_{i}$ 's are share parameters designating the importance of industry $i$ in the consumption agregate (with $\\textstyle\\sum_{i\\in\\mathbb{Z}}\\alpha_{i}=1,$  \n\nIn the autarky equilibrium, each commuting zone can consume only its own production of each good, denoted by $X_{c i}$ for the output of industry $i$ in commuting zone $c$ . Hence, for all $i\\in{\\mathcal{L}}$ and $c\\in{\\mathcal{C}}$ , we have  \n\n$$\nY_{c i}=X_{c i}.\n$$  \n\nWe choose the consumption aggregate in each commuting zone as numeraire (with price normalized to 1) and denote the price of the output of industry $i$ in commuting zone $c$ by $P_{X c i}$ Each industry produces output by combining a continuum of tasks indexed by $s\\in\\lfloor0,S\\rfloor$ .We denote by $x_{c i}(s)$ the quantity of task $s$ utilized in the production of $X_{c i}$ . These tasks must be combined in fixed proportions so that  \n\n$$\nX_{c i}=A_{c i}\\operatorname*{min}_{s\\in[0,S]}\\{x_{c i}(s)\\},\n$$  \n\nwhere $A_{c i}$ designates the productivity of industry $i$ . Differences in the $A_{c i}$ 's and the $\\alpha_{i}$ 's will translate into different industrial compositions of employment across commuting zones.  \n\nWe model industrial robots (or simply, robots) as performing some of the tasks previously performed by labor. Specifically, in industry $i$ tasks $[0,M_{i}]$ are \"technologically automated\" and can be performed by robots, and crucially, these technological opportunities are common across all commuting zones. We normalize the productivity of robots in every task to 1, and further simplify the model by assuming that the productivity of labor in each task is constant as well and equal to $\\gamma>0$ .6Consequently, the production function for task $s$ in industry $i$ in commuting zone $c$ can be written as  \n\n$$\nx_{c i}(s)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c c}{r_{c i}(s)+\\gamma l_{c i}(s)}&{\\mathrm{~if~}s\\leq M_{i}}\\ {\\gamma l_{c i}(s)}&{\\mathrm{~if~}s>M_{i},}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nwhere $l_{c i}(s)$ denotes labor used in the production of task $s$ in industry $i$ in commuting zone $c$ ， while $r_{c i}(s)$ is the number of robots used in the production of this task. Because tasks greater than $M_{i}$ have not been automated, the use of robots in their production is impossible.  \n\nFinally, we specify the supply of robots and labor in each commuting zone as follows  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}{W_{c}}&{=}&{\\mathcal{W}_{c}Y_{c}L_{c}^{\\varepsilon},\\mathrm{~with~}\\varepsilon\\ge0;\\mathrm{~and~}}\\ {Q_{c}}&{=}&{\\mathcal{Q}_{c}\\left(\\frac{R_{c}}{Y_{c}}\\right)^{\\eta},\\mathrm{~with~}\\eta\\ge0,}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $R_{c}$ denotes the total number of robots, $L_{c}$ is the total amount of labor, $Q_{c}$ is the price of robots, and $W_{c}$ is the wage rate in commuting zone $c$ . These specifications imply that $1/\\varepsilon$ is the Frisch elasticity of labor supply, while $1/\\eta$ is the elasticity of the supply of robots. The reason why robots may have an upward sloping supply is that they are produced using both scarce skills and materials. For example, in the United States robots have to be installed by local integrators, which have specific expertise that is likely in short supply, making the cost of increasing the local usage of robots convex in the number of robots installed (Green Leigh and Kraft, 2017).  \n\nAn equilibrium is defined as a set of prices $\\{W_{c},Q_{c}\\}_{c\\in\\mathcal{C}}$ and quantities $\\{L_{c},R_{c}\\}_{c\\in\\mathcal{C}}$ such that in all commuting zones, firms maximize profits, labor and robot supplies are given by (2) and the markets for labor and robots clear, i.e.,  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{I}}\\int_{[0,1]}l_{c i}(s)=L_{c}~\\mathrm{and}~\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{I}}\\int_{[0,1]}r_{c i}(s)=R_{c}.\n$$  \n\nWe prove in the Appendix that an equilibrium exists and is unique.  \n\nWe simplify our discussion here by assuming that it is profitable for firms to use robots in all tasks that are “technologically automated\".7 Formally, let us define $\\begin{array}{r}{\\pi_{c}=1-\\frac{Q_{c}\\gamma}{W_{c}}}\\end{array}$ as the cost-saving gains from using robots rather than labor in a task. We impose:  \n\nASSUMPTION 1 $\\pi_{c}>0$ for all $c\\in{\\mathcal{C}}$  \n\nThis assumption allows us to focus on the case of interest in which improvements in automation (increases in $M_{i}$ ) are binding and affect wages and employment. Using this assumption, we can derive an expression for the demand for labor $L_{c}^{d}$  \n\nPROPOsITION 1 The demand for labor $L_{c}^{d}$ in commuting zone c satisfies:  \n\n$$\nd\\ln{\\cal L}_{c}^{d}=-\\sum_{i\\in\\cal Z}\\ell_{c i}\\frac{d M_{i}}{1-M_{i}}-\\sigma\\sum_{i\\in\\cal Z}\\ell_{c i}d\\ln{\\cal P}_{X c i}+d\\ln{\\cal Y}_{c},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\ell_{c i}$ denotes the share of employment in industry i in commuting zone c.  \n\nLike all other results in this section, the proof of this proposition is provided in the Appendix.  \n\nEquation (4) highlights three different forces shaping labor demand. The first is the displacement effect: holding prices and output constant, robots displace workers and reduce the demand for labor, because with robots it takes fewer workers to produce a given amount of output. The second and the third terms make up the productivity effect, but they work through different channels. The second can be viewed as the price-productivity effect: as automation (the further deployment of robots) lowers the cost of production in an industry, that industry expands and thus increases its demand for labor. As might be expected, this expansion is greater when the elasticity of substitution between different industries, $\\sigma$ , is higher. The third term in equation (4) captures the scale-productivity effect. The reduction in costs results in an expansion of total output, also raising the demand for labor in all industries (since industries are $q$ -complements in (1)). The crucial difference between the price-productivity and scale-productivity effect is that the first results from the expansion of the output of industry $i$ , while the latter is a consequence of the expansion of all industries (and hence of $Y_{c}$  \n\nProposition 1 provides a partial equilibrium characterization—the changes in prices and output ( $d\\ln P_{X c i}$ and $d\\ln Y_{c}$ ) depend on the changes in the prices and quantities of robots and labor in the commuting zone as well as on changes in $M_{i}$ . The next proposition presents its general equilibrium analogue. In this and our subsequent analysis, we denote the share of labor in total output in commuting zone $c$ by $s_{c L}$ , and the share of labor in the output of industry $i$ in commuting zone $c$ by $s_{i c L}$  \n\nPROPOsITION 2 In autarky, the impact of robots on employment and wages is given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{d\\ln{\\cal L}_{c}=-\\displaystyle\\frac{1+\\eta}{1+\\varepsilon}\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{Z}}\\ell_{c i}\\frac{d M_{i}}{1-M_{i}}+\\displaystyle\\frac{1+\\eta}{1+\\varepsilon}\\pi_{c}\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{I}}\\ell_{c i}\\frac{s_{i c L}}{s_{c L}}\\frac{d M_{i}}{1-M_{i}}}}\\ {{d\\ln{W_{c}}=-\\displaystyle\\eta\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{I}}\\ell_{c i}\\frac{d M_{i}}{1-M_{i}}+(1+\\eta)\\pi_{c}\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{I}}\\ell_{c i}\\frac{s_{i c L}}{s_{c L}}\\frac{d M_{i}}{1-M_{i}}.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThis proposition characterizes the total equilibrium impact of robots. In both the employment and wage equations, the first term is the general equilibrium version of the displacement effect, while the second term is the productivity effect (combining the price-productivity and scale-productivity effects), expressed as a function of the changes in the robotics technology. These total equilibrium implications are obtained by solving out changes in quantities and prices of industrial output and robots in terms of the changes in $M_{i}$ 's, which explains the presence of the local supply elasticities, $1/\\varepsilon$ and $1/\\eta$ , and the cost share parameters, the $s_{i c L}$ 's and $s_{c L}$ 's. Similar to our partial equilibrium characterization in Proposition 1, the impact on employment and wages could be negative because of the displacement effect or positive because of the productivity effect. Crucially, the magnitude of the productivity effects depends on $\\pi_{c}$ which encapsulates the cost savings from the substitution of robots for human labor. If this term is close to O, the productivity effects will be limited.  \n\nProposition 2 summarizes the effects of robots as a function of the changes in the robotics technolog.y, $d M_{i}$ . More convenient for our empirical work is to link the responses of employment and wages to changes in the adoption of robots. When $M_{i}\\approx0$ a reasonable approximation to the US economy circa 1990—this can be done in the following fashion:8  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{i\\in\\bar{Z}}\\ell_{c i}\\frac{s_{i c L}}{s_{c L}}\\frac{d M_{i}}{1-M_{i}}\\approx\\sum_{i\\in\\bar{Z}}\\ell_{c i}\\frac{d M_{i}}{1-M_{i}}\\approx\\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\sum_{i\\in\\bar{Z}}\\ell_{c i}\\frac{d R_{i}}{L_{i}}=U S e x p o s u r e t o r o b o t s\n$$  \n\nTogether with equations (5) and (6), this formula shows that the full impact of robots on a local labor market can be summarized by our measure of the $U S$ ecposure to robots, which is computed from the increase in the use of robots in each US industry divided by that industry's baseline employment, and sums these changes using baseline employment shares as weights. The term “exposure to robots\" emphasizes that the variable that matters in theory, and that will be investigated in our empirical work, is how exposed to robots a commuting zone is in terms of its baseline employment shares in different industries, the $\\ell_{c i}$ 's (and the changes in penetration of robots into different industries, the $d R_{i}$ 's). Advances in robotics technology will have a greater effect in commuting zones that have a greater share of their employment in industries where robots are making greater inroads.  \n\n## 2.2  Robots When Commuting Zones Trade  \n\nThe autarky model transparently shows the displacement and productivity effects of robots, but ignores crucial linkages across commuting zones. When a commuting zone adopts more robots, it will have lower costs and sell more to other commuting zones. Such linkages change both the sensitivity of employment and wages to the adoption of robots and their aggregate implications (because lower costs in a commuting zone reduce the cost of living and expand employment in other commuting zones).  \n\nthe price of the product of industry $i$ sourced from commuting zone $c$ will be the same everywhere and is denoted by $P_{X c i}$ . Denoting the amount of good $i$ exported from commuting zone $c$ to destination $d$ by $X_{c d i}$ , market clearing imposes that, for all $c$ and $i$ ，  \n\n$$\nX_{c i}=\\sum_{d\\in\\mathcal{C}}X_{c d i}.\n$$  \n\nPreferences in each commuting zone are again defined by the same aggregate over consumption goods as in (1), but now these consumption goods are themselves assumed to be aggregates of varieties sourced from all commuting zones, given by  \n\n$$\nY_{c i}=\\left(\\sum_{s\\in\\mathcal{C}}\\theta_{s i}X_{s c i}^{\\frac{\\lambda-1}{\\lambda}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda-1}}(\\mathrm{for~all~}c\\mathrm{~and~}i),\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the elasticity of substitution between varieties sourced from different commuting zones, and the share parameters, the $\\theta_{s i}$ 's, indicate the desirability of varieties from different sources (e.g., cars from Detroit may be more valuable than cars from New York City). We have that, for each $i\\in\\mathcal{T}$ ， $\\textstyle\\sum_{s\\in{\\mathcal{C}}}\\theta_{s i}=1$ . Throughout, we also assume that $\\lambda>\\sigma$ , so that varieties of the same good from different commuting zones are more substitutable than different products are in the consumption aggregator. We also take $\\sigma\\geq1$  \n\nBecause all commuting zones share the same sourcing technology, (8), and face the same prices for varieties, the $P_{X_{c i}}$ 's, they willalso have the same prices of the consumption aggregates of different industries, the $P_{Y i}$ 'S.  \n\nAn equilibrium is defined in the same way as in the closed economy, but now requires, in addition, that trade is balanced for each commuting zone $c\\in{\\mathcal{C}}$ ,i.e.,  \n\n$$\nY_{c}=\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{I}}X_{c i}P_{X c i}.\n$$  \n\nWe show in the Appendix that an equilibrium in this model with trade across commuting zones also exists, and moreover, is unique provided that the $M_{i}$ 's are sufficiently small, which is the empirically relevant case for our focus.  \n\nThe next proposition gives the analogue of Proposition 1 in the presence of trade between commuting zones.  \n\nPROPOSITION 3 In the trading equilibrium, the demand for labor $L_{c}^{d}$ in commuting zone c satisfies:  \n\n$$\nd\\ln{\\cal L}_{c}^{d}=-\\sum_{i\\in\\cal Z}\\ell_{c i}{\\frac{d M_{i}}{1-M_{i}}}-\\lambda\\sum_{i\\in\\cal Z}\\ell_{c i}d\\ln{\\cal P}_{X c i}+(\\lambda-\\sigma)\\sum_{i\\in\\cal Z}\\ell_{c i}d\\ln{\\cal P}_{Y i}+d\\ln{\\cal Y}.\n$$  \n\nThe similarities to and differences from Proposition 1 are instructive. The first terms in equations (4) and (9), the displacement effects, are identical. The next three terms in (9) now make up the productivity effect. The second term is the price-productivity effect, and because $\\lambda>\\sigma$ , it is more powerful than in the autarky equilibrium. Intuitively, when an industry in commuting zone $c$ reduces its costs and hence price (for example, because of more intensive use of robots), this will also enable it to gain market share relative to the varieties of the same good produced in other commuting zones. The third term, however, dampens the productivity effect because the greater use of robots in industry $i$ reduces the cost of production not only in commuting zone $c$ , but in all commuting zones. Finally, the last term is the equivalent of the scale-productivity effect in this case, but works through the expansion of total output in the economy rather than output in commuting zone $c$  \n\nThe analogue of Proposition 2, which provides the general equilibrium counterparts of the partial equilibrium effects summarized in Proposition 3, is more involved, and is provided in Proposition A3 in the Appendix.  \n\n# 3 EMPIRICAL SPECIFICATION  \n\nWe now discuss the implications of the autarky and the trading equilibria for our empirical strategy.  \n\nWhen $M_{i}~\\approx~0$ , both our autarky and trade models imply that the effects of robots on employment and wages can be estimated using the following two equations:  \n\n$$\nd\\ln L_{c}=\\beta_{c}^{L}\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{I}}\\ell_{c i}\\frac{d R_{i}}{L_{i}}+\\epsilon_{c}^{L}\\qquad\\mathrm{~and~}\\qquadd\\ln W_{c}=\\beta_{c}^{W}\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{I}}\\ell_{c i}\\frac{d R_{i}}{L_{i}}+\\epsilon_{c}^{W},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\epsilon_{c}^{L}$ and $\\epsilon_{c}^{W}$ are unobserved shocks, and $\\beta_{c}^{L}$ and $\\beta_{c}^{W}$ are random (heterogeneous) coefficients. In the autarky equilibrium, equation (7) implies that these coefficients are given as  \n\n$$\n\\beta_{c}^{L}=\\left(\\frac{1+\\eta}{1+\\varepsilon}\\pi_{c}-\\frac{1+\\eta}{1+\\varepsilon}\\right)\\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\qquad\\mathrm{~and~}\\qquad\\beta_{c}^{W}=\\left((1+\\eta)\\pi_{c}-\\eta\\right)\\frac{1}{\\gamma}.\n$$  \n\nIn this autarky setting, aggregate effects of robots are also given by averages of these heterogeneous coefficients.  \n\nMore realistic and relevant for our investigation is the setting with trade between commuting zones. In this case, when in addition $\\pi_{c}\\approx\\pi$ , the expressions in Proposition A3 can be simplified to yield the following approximations to $\\beta_{c}^{L}$ and $\\beta_{c}^{W}$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle\\stackrel{\\iota}{\\approx}\\left(\\frac{1+\\eta}{1+\\varepsilon}(s_{c L}\\lambda+(1-s_{c L})\\sigma)\\pi_{c}-\\frac{1+\\eta}{1+\\varepsilon}\\frac{s_{c L}\\lambda+1-s_{c L}}{s_{c L}}\\right)\\frac{\\nu_{c}}{\\gamma}}\\ {\\displaystyle\\stackrel{{}\\approx}\\left(\\left((1+\\eta)\\frac{(1+\\varepsilon)\\lambda-1}{1+\\varepsilon}-(1+\\eta(1-s_{c L}))(\\lambda-\\sigma)\\right)\\pi_{c}-\\left(\\eta(\\lambda-1)+\\frac{\\varepsilon(1+\\eta)}{(1+\\varepsilon)s_{c L}}\\right)\\frac{1+\\eta}{(1+\\varepsilon)\\pi_{c}}\\right)\\frac{1+\\eta}{\\gamma},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\nu_{c}={\\frac{(1+\\varepsilon)s_{c L}}{(1+\\varepsilon)s_{c L}\\lambda+(1+\\eta)(1-s_{c L})}}.\n$$  \n\nIn the presence of trade, because more intensive use of robots in a commuting zone $c$ affects other commuting zones, the estimates of $\\beta^{L}$ and $\\beta^{W}$ are not directly informative about aggregate employment and wage effects. However, estimates of these regression coeffcients can be combined with standard values of labor supply ( $1/\\varepsilon$ ) and trade ( $\\sigma$ and $\\lambda$ ) elasticities to recover estimates of the other underlying parameters, and aggregate effects can then be computed from these parameter estimates.  \n\nIn fact, again focusing on the case where $\\pi_{c}\\approx\\pi$ , the Appendix shows that the aggregate employment and wage effects are  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{\\mathrm{aggregate~employment~effects}}}&{{=}}&{{{\\displaystyle{\\frac{1+\\eta}{1+\\varepsilon}}(\\pi-1){\\frac{1}{\\gamma}}}\\mathbb{E}_{c}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{X}}\\ell_{c i}{\\frac{d R_{i}}{L_{i}}}}}\\ {{\\mathrm{aggregate~wage~effects}}}&{{=}}&{{((1+\\eta)\\pi-\\eta){\\displaystyle{\\frac{1}{\\gamma}}}\\mathbb{E}_{c}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{X}}\\ell_{c i}{\\frac{d R_{i}}{L_{i}}},}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwith EcZieI lciL denoting the average exposure to robots across commuting zones. Therefore, to estimate the aggregate impact of robots, all we need are estimates of the Frisch elasticity of labor supply $(1/\\varepsilon)$ , the elasticity of local supply of robots $(1/\\eta)$ , the physical productivity of labor relative to robots $(\\gamma)$ , and the average cost savings from the introduction of robots ( $\\pi$ 一  \n\nThe models in equation (10) can be readily estimated using OLS with the US exposure to robots variable described above. However, there are two related reasons why the US exposure to robots could be correlated with the error terms, the $\\epsilon_{c}^{L}$ 's and $\\epsilon_{c}^{W}$ 's, leading to biased estimates. First, some industries may be adopting robots in response to other changes that they are undergoing, which could directly impact their labor demand (in the model, this would correspond to changes in the $A_{c i}$ terms, which are included in the error terms being correlated with $d R_{i}/L_{i}$ Second, any shock to labor demand in a commuting zone affects the decisions of the industries located in that commuting zone, including their decisions concerning the adoption of robots (in the model, these effects would be captured by changes in $\\textstyle\\sum_{i}A_{c i}$ ， $\\mathcal{Q}_{c}$ ,or $\\mathcal{W}_{c}$ , which could be correlated with $d R_{i}/L_{i}$ for industries disproportionately located in the affected commuting zones).9  \n\nindustries in nine other European economies from 1993 to 2007. By combining these data with the more limited US data, we compute two-stage least squares estimates of $\\beta^{L}$ and $\\beta^{W}$ .Although our use of the exogenous exposure to robots is not a panacea against all kinds of endogeneity concerns, we believe that this variable, when used either directly or as an instrument, has a better basis for being taken as orthogonal to the terms in $\\epsilon_{c}^{L}$ and $\\epsilon_{c}^{W}$  \n\n# 4 DATA, DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS AND FIRST STAGE  \n\nIn this section, we introduce the various data sources we use in our empirical analysis, describe the construction of the exposure to robots variable, provide basic descriptive statistics, and also describe the first-stage relationship between the exogenous exposure to robots variable computed from European economies and the US exposure to robots.  \n\n## 4.1 Data Sources  \n\nOur main data consist of counts of the stock of robots by industry, country and year from the IFR, which is based on yearly surveys of robot suppliers. The IFR data cover 50 countries from 1993 to 2014, corresponding to about 90 percent of the industrial robots market. However, the stock of industrial robots by industry going back to the 90s is only available for a subset of countries: Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. These countries account for 41 percent of the world industrial robot market. Although the IFR reports data on the total stock of industrial robots in the United States from 1993 onwards, it does not provide industry breakdowns until 2004.10 Outside of manufacturing, we have consistent data for the use of robots in six broad industries (roughly at the two-digit level): agriculture, forestry and fishing; mining; utilities; construction; education, research and development; and other non-manufacturing industries (e.g., services and entertainment). In manufacturing, we have consistent data on the use of robots for a more detailed set of 13 industries (roughly at the three-digit level): food and beverages; textiles; wood and furniture; paper; plastic and chemicals; glass and ceramics; basic metals; metal products; metal machinery; electronics; automotive; other vehicles; and other manufacturing industries (e.g. recycling). Table A1 in the Appendix shows the evolution of robots usage in these industries in the nine European countries in our sample and in the United States.  \n\nThe IFR data also have some shortcomings. First, not all robots are classified into one of the 19 industries. About 30 percent of robots are unclassified, and this fraction has declined 10Though the IFR also reports data by industry for Japan, these data underwent a major reclasification. We follow the recommendations of the IFR and exclude Japan from our analysis.  \n\nthroughout our sample. We allocate these unclassified robots to industries in the same proportions as in the classified data. Second, as noted in footnote 2, IFR data do not contain information on dedicated industrial robots. Third, the data for Denmark is not classified by industry before 1996. For the missing years, we construct estimates of the number of industrial robots by defating the 1996 stocks by industry using the total growth in the stock of robots of the country. Finally, the IFR only reports the overall stock of robots for North America. Though this aggregation introduces noise in our measures of US exposure to robots, this is not a major concern, since the United States accounts for more than 90 percent of the North American market, and our IV procedure should purge the US exposure to robots from this type of measurement error.11  \n\nWe combine the IFR data with employment counts by country and industry in 1990 from the EUKLEMS dataset (see Jagger, 2016) to measure the number of industrial robots per thousand workers by country, industry and time.12  \n\nmeasures employment from the household side, while the CBP approaches it from the employer side, making the two data sources complementary.  \n\nTo control for potentially confounding changes in trade patterns, we utilize data on the exposure to Chinese imports from Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2013), and we construct similar measures of the exposure to imports from Mexico and exports from Germany, Japan and Korea (the countries that are adopting robots most rapidly). Our trade exposure measures combine the distribution of employment across four-digit industries in the commuting zone and industrylevel imports and exports from the United Nations Comtrade database (which gives bilateral trade data at six-digit product level, which we aggregate to the four-digit level following Autor, Dorn and Hanson, 2013). Following a similar procedure, we construct a measure of offshoring using data on the share of intermediate inputs that are imported by each four-digit industry. The offshoring data are from Wright (2014), who updates Feenstra and Hanson's (1999) to cover the entire period from 1993 to 2007. Finally, we control for the importance of routine jobs in a commuting zone (our measure is the fraction of employment in a commuting zone in routine occupations as defined in Autor and Dorn, 2013); and we also construct measures of the presence of declining industries, growth of capital stock and growth of IT capital in a commuting zone (as described below).  \n\nFinally, we use data compiled by Green Leigh and Kraft (2016), who scraped the web to obtain the locations of robot integrators—which are companies that install and program robots for different industrial applications. Using these data, we construct estimates of the number of (robot) integrators in each commuting zone.  \n\n## 4.2 Exposure to Robots  \n\nFigure 1 plots the evolution of the mean and the 30th percentile of robot usage across the nine European economies described in the previous subsection. It also includes the average density in the United States—recall that aggregate data for the United States are available since 1993, but broken down by industry only since 2004. In our sample of European countries, robot usage starts near 0.6 robots per thousand workers in the early 1990s and increases rapidly to 2.6 robots per thousand workers in the late 2000s. In the United States, robot usage is lower but follows a similar trend; it starts near 0.4 robots per thousand workers in the early 1990s and increases by the US Census Bureau; see http://www.census.gov/econ/cbp/index.html. Because the CBP information on employment by industry is sometimes reported as an interval, we use the fixed-point imputation strategy developed by Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2013) to obtain estimates for these cells. The CBP data provide employment counts at the county level, which we aggregate to the commuting zone level using the crosswalks these authors used, which is available here http:/ /www.ddorn.net /data.htm.  \n\nrapidly to 1.4 robots per thousand workers in the late 2000s. The US trends are closely mirrored by the 30th percentile of robot usage among the European countries in our data.  \n\nThese observations motivate the construction of our exposure to robots variable as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{E x p o s u r e~t o~r o b o t s}&{{}}\\ {f r o m~I993~t o~2007_{c}}&{{}=\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{L}}\\ell_{c i}^{1970}\\left(p_{30}\\left(\\frac{R_{i,2007}}{L_{i,1990}}\\right)-p_{30}\\left(\\frac{R_{i,1993}}{L_{i,1990}}\\right)\\right),}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere the sum runs over all the industres in the IFR data, $\\ell_{c i}^{1970}$ stands for the 1970 share of commuting zone $c$ employment in industry $i$ , which we compute from the 1970 Census, and $p_{30}\\left(\\frac{R_{i,t}}{L_{i,1990}}\\right)$ denotes the 30th percentile of robot usage among European countries in industry $i$ and year $t$ . Our main measure of (exogenous) exposure to robots is based on the 1970 values for the distribution of employment across industries, which enables us to focus on historical and persistent differences in the specialization of commuting zones in different industries, and to avoid any mechanical correlation or mean reversion with changes in overall or industry-level employment outcomes.15  \n\nWe construct the US exposure to robots in an analogous fashion:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{U S e x p o s u r e t o}}\\ {{r o b o t s f r o m2004t o2007_{c}}}\\end{array}=\\displaystyle{\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{I}}}\\ell_{c i}^{1990}\\left(\\frac{R_{i,2007}^{U S}}{L_{i,1990}^{U S}}-\\frac{R_{i,2004}^{U S}}{L_{i,1990}^{U S}}\\right),\n$$  \n\nwhere we use the 19o distribution of emplyment aerosindustries $\\ell_{c i}^{1990}$ , as the baseline for this measure to match it more closely to theory (and the mean reversion concern mentioned above is not pertinent in this case, since this measure will be instrumented by the exogenous exposure to robots described above).  \n\nFigure 4 gives a first glimpse of the relationship between European and US changes in industry-level robot usage. The figure shows that with a few exceptions (basic metals, metal machinery and other manufacturing), the industries that adopted more robots in Europe between 1993 and 2007 also adopted more robots in the United States between 2004 and 2007. The same relationship holds for the period between 2004 and 2007.  \n\nmeasures and present numbers relative to the industry with the largest increase for the variable in question. The figure reveals that the industries that are adopting more industrial robots are not the same industries affected by Chinese import competition, nor are they the same ones experiencing unusually rapid growth in total capital or IT capital. This strengthens our presumption that the use of industrial robots is a technological phenomenon that is largely unrelated to other trends affecting industries in developed countries.  \n\nPanel A of Figure 3 depicts the geographic distribution of commuting zones with high exposure to robots—the source of variation that we will exploit to identify the impact of industrial robots on employment and wages. The color scale indicates which commuting zones have experienced greater increases in the exogenous exposure to robots measure from 1993 to 2007. The figure reveals significant variation: while in some areas our measure predicts a small increase in the stock of robots, between 0.12-0.3 robots per thousand workers, in other regions— especially but not only in the rustbelt-it predicts a much larger increase of 1-4.87 robots per thousand workers.  \n\nFigures 2 and 4 highlight that automobile manufacturing is the sector with the highest robot penetration in both Europe and the United States. Below, we document in detail that our results are not driven by the automobile industry. Panel B of Figure 3 takes a first step in this direction and shows the geographical variation in the exposure to robots once we exclude the automobile industry. The measure of robot penetration that excludes automobile manufacturing still exhibits considerable variation, equivalent to about 68 percent of the original variation in robot penetration across commuting zones.  \n\nImportantly, although manufacturing industries use 80% of the industrial robots in the US, our measure of exposure to robots is not simply picking up areas with a higher employment in manufacturing. The share of manufacturing employment explains only about 18 percent of the variation in exposure to robots across commuting zones. The bulk of the variation plotted in Figure 3 arises from differences in the industrial mix across commuting zones. Furthermore, consistent with the message from Figure 2, Panels D-F show that the geographic distribution of exposure to robots is very diferent from exposure to Chinese imports, exposure to Mexican imports, routine jobs and offshoring. The (population-weighted) cross-commuting zone correlation between our measure and exposure to Chinese imports and offshoring is small as noted in Figure 3, and essentially disappears once we include our standard demographic controls and the share of manufacturing in the area (-0.052 for exposure to Chinese imports and -0.002 for offshoring, respectively). The correlation of our measure with exposure to Mexican imports and routine jobs is somewhat higher, but is again weakened once we condition on our key covariates (it is reduced to 0.26 and 0.11, respectively). These weak correlations are reassuring against concerns that the effects of robots would be highly confounded by other major changes affecting local US labor markets.  \n\n## 4.3  Descriptive Statistics  \n\nTable 1 provides basic descriptive statistics from our various different data sources. Column 1 gives sample means and standard deviations for our basic variables. Panel A focuses on our key left-hand side variables, while Panel B provides information on some of our right-hand side variables.  \n\nColumns 2-6 give a first glimpse of the source of variation we are going to focus on for much of our empirical analysis; they provide means and standard deviations by quartiles of the (exogenous) exposure to robots variable computed from the nine European economies described above. $^\\mathrm{16}$ Two patterns are notable. First, diferences in the levels of employment to population ratio in 1990 and hourly wage in 1990 between commuting zones at different quartiles of the exposure to robots variable are relatively small.17 Second and more importantly, from 1990 to 2007, commuting zones at these different quartiles show very different trends in employment and wages. Though these are not entirely monotone across quartiles, we can clearly see smaller increases in employment to population ratio and hourly wages in commuting zones at higher quartiles, indicating that employment and wages have declined in areas with greater exposure to robots compared to low exposure areas.  \n\nIn Panel B, we see that there are some significant differences in other labor market variables for commuting zones that are highly exposed to robots. The share of employment in manufacturing in 1990 (and in particular in durable manufacturing) is much higher at higher quartiles; this is not surprising since the use of industrial robots outside manufacturing remains small, with few exceptions in agriculture, construction, mining, and research and development. We can also see the slight correlation between exposure to robots and exposure to Chinese imports, exposure to Mexican imports, the share of routine jobs and offshoring in Panel B, already depicted in Figure 3. Despite the weak correlation between exposure to robots and these measures, we will include them, as well as a variety of other demographic variables, on the right-hand side of our regression models in order to control for any confounding trends.  \n\n## 4.4 First Stage  \n\nFigure 5 provides a visual representation of our first-stage relationship in the form of a residual plot. The first stage, which will be used in our instrumental variables exercises and is shown in this figure, links the US exposure to robots to the (exogenous) exposure to robots computed from the European data. More precisely, our first stage takes the form  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{T}}\\ell_{c i}^{1990}\\left(\\frac{R_{i,2007}^{U S}}{L_{i,1990}^{U S}}-\\frac{R_{i,2004}^{U S}}{L_{i,1990}^{U S}}\\right)=\\pi\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{T}}\\ell_{c i}^{1970}\\left(p_{30}\\left(\\frac{R_{i,2007}}{L_{i,1990}}\\right)-p_{30}\\left(\\frac{R_{i,1993}}{L_{i,1990}}\\right)\\right)+\\Gamma X_{c,1}\n$$  \n\nwhere $X_{c,1990}$ is a vector of controls, and as noted above, $p_{30}$ denotes the 30th percentile. Because we only measure the use of robots in the US from 2004 to 2007, but our outcomes and instrument span the whole 1990-2007 period, we convert the increase in robots per thousand workers between 2004 and 2007 in the US to a 17-year equivalent change.18 The solid (black) line in this figure corresponds to the regression relationship with covariates as in column 4 of Table 2 below (with the shaded area around it showing the two-standard deviation error bands). The dashed (red) line depicts the same regression relationship when the top 1 percent of commuting zones with the highest exposure to robots is excluded from the regression (as in column 7 of Table 2).  \n\nOur first stage, shown in Figure 5, reflects the fact that there is a high level of correlation between the usage of robots by European industries and US industries. However, the crosssectional variation in the US exposure to robots measure relies on differences in the baseline distribution of employment across commuting zones rather than the actual number of robots per worker installed in each region. Ideally, we would use the change in the number of robots installed between 1990 (or 1993) and 2007 in each commuting zone as our endogenous regressor. Unfortunately, robots data at the commuting zone level are not available, but we can use the data on integrators compiled by Green Leigh and Kraft (2016) to verify that there is greater activity associated with more intensive robotic installation in areas where our (exogenous) exposure to robots variable takes a higher value.  \n\nThis is done in Figure 6 and Table A2 in the Appendix. In the figure, we show the residual plot of the log of one plus the number of integrators in a commuting zone against our exposure to robots variable (as in Figure 5, after the covariates from our main specification in column 4 of Table 2 are partialled out). The dashed (red) line once again corresponds to this regression relationship after the commuting zones with the highest exposure to robots are excluded. In both cases we see a very strong association between our exposure to robots variable and the presence and number of integrators in a commuting zone. Table A2 shows that the same relationship holds and is strongly significant in the other specifications used in Table 2 and when we use the number of integrators on the left-hand side or estimate a Poisson count regression to model the behavior of the number of integrators. We interpret this relationship as indicating that there has been a pronounced increase in robots-related activity in commuting zones that are more exposed to robots according to our measure.  \n\n# 5 RESULTS  \n\nIn this section we present our main empirical results on employment and wages, and investigate their robustness.  \n\n## 5.1 Baseline Results for Employment  \n\nTable 2 presents our main results for employment. As our outcome variable, we use change in the employment to population ratio between 1990 and 2007. We end our sample in 2007 to avoid the potentially confounding effects of the Great Recession.19 As explained in the previous section, our main specifications use the (exogenous) exposure to robots between 1993 and 2007 on the right-hand side, and should thus be interpreted as the reduced-forms of equation (10). Throughout, unless stated otherwise, our main specifications are in changes and are weighted by the working-age population in a commuting zone in 1990; the standard errors are clustered at the state level and robust against heteroscedasticity. In addition, the models in Table 2 are for long differences and thus have one observation per commuting zone.  \n\nIn Panel A, we focus on private employment from the Census, which comprises persons in salaried private-sector jobs, while Panel B looks at employment counts from the CBP. Though these two variables measure somewhat different concepts, our results are very similar with both (results with total employment to population ratio from the Census are also similar and are presented in Table A4).20  \n\nColumn 1 presents our most parsimonious specification, which only includes Census division dummies as covariates. We estimate a strong negative relationship between the exposure to robots and employment changes in a commuting zone with a coefficient of -0.92 (standard error $=0.30$ ) in Panel A. The same specification has a larger coefficient, -1.43 (standard error = 0.50), in Panel B.  \n\nIn column 2 we control for baseline differences in demographics in 1990. Specifically, we control for population; the share of working-age population (between 16 and 65 years); the share of population with college and the share of population with completed high school; and the share of Blacks, Hispanics and Asians. Since our model is in changes, this specification amounts to allowing for differential trends by these demographic characteristics. These controls reduce our coefficient estimates slightly to -0.78 in Panel A and -1.17 in Panel B.  \n\nIn column 3, we also control for the baseline shares of employment in manufacturing, durable manufacturing and construction, as well as the share of female employment in manufacturing. These controls allow for diferential trends by the baseline industrial structure of a commuting zone, and are meant to ensure that our exposure to robots variable does not capture possible secular declines in manufacturing or other sectoral trends.21 As expected from the fact that our measure of exposure to robots exhibits considerable variation within manufacturing, controlling for broad industry shares has a very small impact on our coefficient of interest, which now stands at -0.77 (standard error = 0.18) in Panel A and -1.23 (standard error = 0.37) in Panel B.  \n\nIn column 4 we control for other labor market shocks that affected workers during our period of analysis: imports from China, imports from Mexico, the potential disappearance of routine jobs and offshoring. In particular, we control for a measure of exposure to imports from China between 1990 and 2007 (as in Autor, Dorn and Hanson, 2013), for exposure to imports from Mexico between 1991 and 2007, for the share of employment in routine jobs measured in 1990 (as in Autor Dorn and Hanson, 2015), and for a measure of offshoring of intermediate inputs (Feenstra and Hanson, 1999; and Wright, 2004). Consistent with the patterns shown in Figure 3, controlling for Chinese imports, Mexican imports, routine jobs and offshoring has little impact on our estimates; in Panel A, the coefficient on the exposure to robots declines slightly to -0.75 (standard error = 0.17), while in Panel B it remains essentially unchanged at -1.31 (standard error = 0.35). The coefficients on the Chinese and Mexican import variables, routine jobs and offshoring variables are shown in Table A5 in the Appendix.22  \n\nColumn 5 shows very similar results in an unweighted regression for the same specification as in column 4. In Panel A, this leads to a slightly larger estimate, -1.12 (standard error = 0.26), while it has essentially no effect on the estimate in Panel B, which remains at -1.12 (standard error = 0.41).  \n\nFigure 7 provides residual regression plots for our specifications from column 4 in Panels A and B, with the regression estimate depicted with the solid (black) line. The presence of a number of commuting zones with very large changes in exposure to robots is evident from the figures. Most notably, the commuting zone including Detroit, Michigan, is the one with the greatest exposure to robots because of its large share of employment in automotive manufacturing—the industry with the largest increase in robots as we have seen in the previous section.  \n\nColumns 6 and 7 demonstrate that the negative relationship between exposure to robots and employment is not due to these commuting zones. Column 6 estimates the same relationship as in Column 4 using the robust regression procedure of Li (1985), which downweights both outliers and “cluster points\" that have a disproportionate impact on the slope of the regression line. The relationship is similar to that shown in column 4. In column 7 we pursue another line of attack and exclude from the regression commuting zones with exposure to robots above the 99th percentile (a total of eight commuting zones, which are: Detroit, Michigan; Lansing City, Michigan; Saginaw City, Michigan; Defiance, Ohio; Lorain, Ohio; Muncie, Indiana Racine, Wisconsin; and Wilmington, Delaware). The coefficient estimates are again similar in Panel A and somewhat larger in Panel B. The dashed (red) line in Figure 7 depicts the estimate from column 7.  \n\nPanels A and B of Table 3 turn from long differences (a single change between 1990 and 2007 per commuting zone) to a specification with stacked differences (two changes of 10-year periods per commuting zone). Stacked-differences specifications are useful because they exploit the differential increase in robots across industries between the 1990s and 2000s, and also enable us to directly control for commuting zone-level trends in employment and wages. Panel A is for the Census (private) employment to population ratio, while Panel B is for the CBP employment to population ratio. For brevity, we omit the equivalents of columns 1 and 2 from Table 2. The first five columns of this table are thus direct analogues of our long-differences specifications in Table 2, and they show not just similar qualitative results but point estimates that are close to those in Table 2 as well. Most importantly, column 6 now includes a full set of commuting zone fixed effects; this is equivalent to linear commuting zone trends in this change specification (something that would not be possible in the long-differences specifications of Table 2). Though this specification is very demanding and exploits a different source of variation, we find very similar estimates of the effect of robots on employment with both the Census and the CBP employment to population ratio variables. For example, the coefficient estimate for the Census variable in this case is -0.61 (standard error = 0.11), while for the CBP variable it is -1.92 (standard error = 0.34).  \n\n## 5.2  Baseline Results for Wages  \n\nWe next turn to the impact of robots on wages. Because robots affect employment, they are also likely to infuence the composition of employed workers. To minimize the impact of such compositional changes, we estimate a variant of equation (10) that fully takes into account the differences in the observable characteristics of employed individuals. In particular, our estimating equation isnow  \n\n$$\n\\ln W_{c g,2007}-\\ln W_{c g,1990}=\\beta^{W}\\cdot E x p o s u r e t o r o b o t s I993.2007_{c}+\\epsilon_{c g}^{W}\n$$  \n\nwhere $W_{c g,t}$ is the hourly wage for workers in demographic group $g$ who reside in commuting zone $c$ at time $t$ . We define 800 demographic cells by a combination of gender, age, education, race, birthplace and relation to the household head, so that the outcome $\\ln W_{c g,2007}-\\ln W_{c g,1990}$ is the wage change for workers with the same observable characteristics.23 Each demographic group is weighted by its size in that commuting zone in 1990, thus controlling for potential changes in the composition of employed workers between 1990 and 2007.  \n\nstable effects on wages in all seven columns. For instance, in our main specification in column 4, which controls for commuting zone demographic characteristics, industry shares, Chinese imports, Mexican imports, routine jobs and offshoring, we estimate a coefficient of -1.48 (standard error=0.32). The estimates in columns 1-3 are also similar. The coefficient estimate becomes slightly more negative when we downweight outliers in column 6 or exclude the commuting zones with the highest exposure to robots in column 7. Figure 8 provides a residual regression plot of our results in columns 4 and 6. The figure shows that outliers are not responsible for the negative and precisely-estimated relationship between exposure to robots and wages.  \n\nPanels C and D of Table 3 show estimates from the stacked differences specifications. The results are again comparable to the long-differences specifications, though somewhat more negative. For example, in our baseline specification reported in column 2, the coefficient estimate for log hourly wages is -1.92 (standard error=0.37), as compared to -1.48 in Table 2. When we include commuting zone fixed effects in column 6, the coefficient changes to -2.52 (standard error = 0.49).  \n\n## 5.3  Two-Stage Least Squares Estimates  \n\nSo far, all of our estimates are reduced forms for equation (1o). We next use our measure of the US exposure to robots to compute two-stage least squares estimates of $\\beta^{L}$ and $\\beta^{W}$  \n\nTable 4 reports our IV estimates using the same seven specifications reported in Table 2. Panel A presents estimates for the first stage introduced in equation (15). The IV results for our baseline employment outcomes are reported in Panels B and C of Table 4, while those for wages are in Panels D and E. Because our first stage yields a coefficient of 2.03, the resulting IV estimates are half our reduced-form estimates shown in Tables 2. With the Census (private) employment to population ratio, our main long-differences specification, reported in column 4, gives a IV estimate of 0.37 which is once again highly significant (standard error=0.11). The results are similar in the other columns,24 and also for wages. For example, with the estimate for log hourly wages in column 4 of Panel D is -0.73 (standard error=0.22).  \n\n## 5.4  Quantitative Magnitudes  \n\nThe implications of our estimates for local employment and wages—meaning the implications for a high exposure commuting zone relative to a low or zero exposure one—are straightforward to compute directly from our IV estimates. In particular, our baseline estimates from column  \n\n4 in Panels B and D of Table 4 imply that as a result of the US increase in robots adoption (approximately one more robot per thousand workers between 1993 and 2007), a commuting zone with a value of exposure to robots equal to the average for the United States experienced 0.37 percentage points lower employment to population ratio and 0.73 percent lower wage growth compared to a commuting zone with no exposure to robots. These numbers can also be expressed as one more robot reducing employment by 6.2 workers and one more robot per thousand workers reducing average yearly wages by about $\\$200$ in the affected commuting zone.25 These are sizable effects, but as we explain, not implausible. Crucially, as we discuss further below, these numbers include both the direct effects of robots on employment and wages in a commuting zone and any indirect, spillover effects that might arise because of a resulting decline in local demand. $^{26}$  \n\nThe more challenging question is how much (and whether) employment and wages in the aggregate decline in response to the adoption of industrial robots. Let us first ignore any spillovers from local demand (which we will discuss after we present the effects of robots on different industries). If we also assume, unrealistically, that there is no trade between commuting zones, then the aggregate implications of robots are identical to the local estimates discussed in the previous paragraph—one more robot per thousand reducing aggregate employment to population ratio by 0.37 percentage points and average wages by 0.73 percent.  \n\naggregate effects depend simply on the elasticity of labor supply $(1/\\varepsilon$ ), the supply elasticity of robots $(1/\\eta)$ , the physical productivity of labor relative to robots ( $\\gamma$ ) and $\\pi$ . In what follows, we use our regression estimates and external information to discipline these parameters. We choose $\\varepsilon=0.43$ , which is the inverse of the macro extensive margin elasticity of labor supply (from Chetty et al., 2011). The use of the macro elasticity enables us to capture both the extensive margin of labor supply and any adjustment in employment resulting from wage rigidities or the availability of social programs such as disability or unemployment insurance. Next, we choose three parameters that do not directly matter in equation (12), but are relevant for pinning down the rest of the parameters from our regression coefficient estimates. These are: (1) $\\sigma=1$ as the elasticity of substitution between different industries (e.g., Oberfield and Raval, 2014); (2) $\\lambda=7$ for the elasticity of substitution between traded varieties, which follows the recent trade literature (e.g., Simonovska and Waugh, 2014; and Head and Meyer, 2015); and (3) the standard choice of $s_{c,L}=0.66$ for the initial value of the labor share in all commuting zones. Finally, we take the average value of the profitability of using industrial robots relative to labor, $\\pi$ equal to 0.3, which implies that adopting robots increases profits by about 30 percent relative to using labor. This estimate for $\\pi$ is in line with the estimates in the recent report by the Boston Consulting Group, BCG (2015).  \n\nThese parameter choices and our regression coeffcient estimates together enable us to back out the relative physical productivity of labor as $\\gamma=153$ , and the inverse elasticity of supply of robots as $\\eta=1.5$ .27  We next argue that both of these numbers are plausible. Our estimate for $\\gamma$ implies that, on average, a robot performs work equivalent to $1000/\\gamma=6.5$ workers, which is in the range of estimates from the recent case studies (e.g., BCG, 2015). A value of $\\eta=1.5$ corresponds to an elasticity of the supply of robots of about 0.66. Suppose that robots in a commuting zone are supplied by combining the services of local integrators (which are inelastic) and nationally supplied parts and materials (which are fully elastic to the commuting zone). Green Leigh and Kraft (2016) report the share of integrators to be about $2/3$ and that of parts and materials as $1/3$ , which implies an elasticity of robot supply of 0.5, close to the value of 0.66 obtained from our estimates.  \n\nby about 5.6 workers (10 percent lower than the local effect), and one more robot per thousand workers reduces wages in the aggregate by about 0.5 percent (30 percent lower than the local effect). Though these aggregate effects are still quite large, they are broadly consistent with the rest of our results, which do not show significant offsetting employment increase in other industries and occupations within a commuting zone. Our estimates also imply a modest 0.13 percent increases in GDP from an increase of one robot per thousand workers.  \n\nThese aggregate effects are not sensitive to reasonable variations in the values used for $\\lambda$ ， $\\sigma$ and $\\varepsilon$ . For example, reducing $\\lambda$ to 5 or increasing it to 10 makes essentially no difference to the main conclusions. Similarly, reducing $\\sigma$ to 0.5, or increasing it to 2, also leaves the aggregate effects unchanged (in all of these cases the aggregate employment effect is a reduction of 5.6 workers for every robot and the aggregate wage effect remains about a 0.5 percent decline for every robot in thousand workers). The insensitivity of our quantitative magnitudes to different values of $\\sigma$ and $\\lambda$ is not surprising in view of the explicit expressions for aggregate effects in equation (12), where they do not directly appear, and the fact that the implied values for $\\gamma$ and $\\eta$ are not very sensitive to the values of these parameters. Even though the inverse of the Frisch elasticity, $\\varepsilon$ , directly appears in (12), reasonable variations in this parameter also have very little impact on the aggregate impact of robots. For example, reducing it to 0.35, or increasing it to 0.5, makes little difference (the former, for example, leads to slightly larger and the latter to slightly smaller wage declines in the aggregate, with very similar employment declines in both cases). In contrast, variations in $\\pi$ —the cost-saving gains from the use of robots—lead to somewhat greater changes to our conclusions. For example, reducing $\\pi$ to 0.1 makes the aggregate effects essentially the same as the local effects, while increasing $\\pi$ to 0.5 reduces the aggregate effects to 4.65 fewer workers for every additional robot and 0.2 percent lower wages for every additional robot per thousand workers. This highlights that, given our estimates, the only way of reversing the conclusions about the negative aggregate effects of robots on employment and wages is to assume that robot adoption is very profitable, so that there are very large productivity effects that offset the significant displacement effects. Since cost savings of more than 50 percent are not just very large but beyond what any case study evidence we have found supports, we interpret the range of quantitative magnitudes reported above as broadly robust.  \n\n## 5.5 Placebo Checks  \n\nThere are two main threats to our interpretation of our estimates as the causal impact of robots on employment and wages. First, the industries that have been adopting more robots over the last two decades (in the United States and Europe) could have already been on a downward trend. Second, the commuting zones that house the industries that are adopting more robots may be affected by other negative shocks. In either case, our estimates would confound the impact of the use of robots on labor markets with these pre-existing industry or commuting zonetrends.  \n\nIn Table 5 we address both issues through a series of placebo checks that show no pre-existing trends in employment or wages before 1990 in the commuting zones that were highly exposed to robots.28 Panel A presents estimates of our baseline equations for change in the employment to population ratio between 1970 and 1990 on the left-hand side to check whether trends before the onset of robots are still correlated with our exposure to robots measure. The columns in this table have an identical structure to those in Table 2. Our baseline specification in column 4 shows that the coeffcient of robot exposure on past employment trends is a precisely estimated zero. The remaining specifications show no evidence of pre-existing trends in employment either, and yield small point estimates (the only exception is a negative coefficient in the unweighted specification in column 5 which is not precisely estimated). Panels B and C present analogous specifications for log hourly wages and log weekly wages. There is a negative and significant estimate in column 1 of Panel B, and negative and marginally significant estimates in column 2 of Panel B and column 1 of Panel C. However, once industry controls are included in columns 3 onwards, there is no evidence of either a negative or a positive pre-trend for wages in any of the specifications.  \n\nThese results are also summarized in Figure 9, which presents the residual plots for employment to population ratio and log hourly wages from the specifications in columns 4 and 7. The lack of a significant relationship before 1990 is clearly visible from this figure.  \n\n## 5.6 Robustness Checks  \n\nWe now investigate the robustness of our employment and wage results to a range of different specifications and controls. For brevity, we focus on the reduced-form models using the (exogenous) exposure to robots variable.  \n\nAs shown in Figure 4, from 1993 to 2007 the automobile industry has adopted considerably more robots than any other industry. Table 6 investigates the role of this sector by separating the exposure to robots coming from the automobile industry from the rest. As a result, the exposure to robots measure includes only variation coming from industries other than automobiles, while we include the exposure to robots from the automobile industry separately. The four panels in this table are the same as in Table 2. The first three columns present the baseline, the unweighted and the outlier-robust specifications in long differences, while the next three columns are for the same specifications in stacked differences as in Table 3. In Panel A, with the Census (private) employment to population ratio, all six specifications lead to very similar estimates of the effects of robot exposure in the automobile industry and other industries to our baseline estimates in Tables 2 and 3. These estimates show that our baseline results are not driven by the automobile industry alone, and in fact, on the basis of these results, the effects of robots in the automobile industry and other sectors appear not to be appreciably different. The estimates in Panels C and D for hourly and weekly wages are also comparable to our baseline results. The only exceptions to this pattern are the long-differences estimates in columns 1 to 3 of Panel B, which use the CBP employment to population ratio as the dependent variable. In these specifications, the estimates of the impact of exposure to robots in other industries are not precise and no longer statistically significant at conventional levels, but they remain negative and similarly sized to our baseline estimates. (The exposure to robots in automobiles continues to be significant with coefficient estimates similar to the analogous specifications in Table 2.） However, in the next three columns when we turn to specifications with stacked differences, we find both variables to be significant with somewhat larger coefficients.  \n\nOverall, we interpret the results in this table as bolstering the interpretation that the patterns documented so far correspond to the effects of robots on the labor market, rather than a consequence of the potential decline of the automobile industry.  \n\nSeveral other robustness checks are reported in the Appendix. Table A10 shows that our results are robust to allowing for mean-reverting dynamics in employment and wages by including lagged dependent variables on the right-hand side of our specifications. Table A1l goes one step further and includes a very large set of covariates,29 and then applies the two-step lasso shrinkage method of Chernozhukov, Belloni and Hansen (2014). By maximizing an objective function that penalizes the use of additional covariates, this method selects the subset of covariates that best explain the variation in the dependent variable. We then compute our estimates controlling for the selected covariates. Reassuringly, the results from this exercise are very similar to those in our baseline specifications in Tables 2 and 3. Table A12 further shows that our long-differences results are robust to the inclusion of state-fixed effects.  \n\nof robots among advanced economies, we used the 30th percentile of the distribution of robots across European economies and combined this with employment shares in 1970 to construct our exposure to robots variable. Table A13 shows that the results are similar when we use baseline industry shares from 1990 instead of 1970, while Table A14 confirms that using other moments of this distribution (such as the mean, median or the 90th percentile) has no major effect on our results either. Overall, these tables show that the exact construction of our (exogenous) exposure to robots variable has little impact on our main results.  \n\n## 5.7 Isolating the Impact of Robots  \n\nAnother threat to the interpretation of our estimates as capturing the effects of robots on employment and wages is that there may be concurrent changes impacting commuting zones in which exposure to robots is high. For example, industries that are adopting robots may also be increasing their capital intensity or investing much more in IT, which could have a direct impact on employment and wages. Though Figure 2 did not show a strong correlation between the adoption of robots and overall capitalintensity or IT capital, we cannot fully rule out such confounding changes.30  \n\nTable 7 takes a more direct approach by showing that controlling for a range of related trends has no impact on our estimates. Panel A directly controls for the role played by industries in decline (in terms of employment). More specifically, we construct a Bartik-style measure that interacts the national level decline in employment across the industries in the IFR data from 1970 to 1990 with the share of the commuting zone employment in that industry in 1990. The first three columns are for the Census (private) employment to population ratio, while the next three columns are for log hourly wages. Though the declining industries variable is negative and significant in a few specifications, the coefficient estimates for the exposure to robots variable hardly change from our baseline specifications. These results are thus encouraging for our interpretation that the exposure to robots variable is not proxying for declining industries.  \n\nPanels B and C turn to the question of whether some simultaneous industry-level changes could be responsible for some of the effects we estimate. To do this, we construct a Bartik-style measure of the percent increase in the capital stock (Panel B) and a measure of the change in computer usage at work per worker in each commuting zone (Panel C). We then include these variables together with our exposure to robots variable.3l In both cases, the inclusion of these variables has little effect on our estimates of the impact of robots.32 Also interestingly, these variables themselves are either not significant or when they are significant, they have a positive effect, which suggests that other types of capital equipment and even computers tend to increase the demand for labor. This result underscores the possibility—though certainly does not prove that industrial robots might have a very different impact on employment and wages than other types of recent technologies.  \n\n## 5.8  Effects on Men and Women  \n\nTable 8 investigates the employment and wage effects by gender. For brevity, we focus on the same specifications as in Tables 6. Qualitatively, we see similar results for men and women—in all cases negative, precisely estimated and statistically significant at 1 percent or less. Quantitatively, however, the effects on employment for men are about 1.5-2 times larger than those for women. For example, with our baseline specification in long differences, shown in column 1, the effect for men is -1.01, while for women it is -0.52. Interestingly, the wage effects are of comparable size for the two groups.  \n\n## 5.9 Effects by Industry, Occupation, Education and Wage Percentile  \n\nFigure 10 presents estimates of the effects of exposure to robots on employment in different industries. We present point estimates and confidence intervals from three specifications: two longdifferences specifications analogous to columns 4 and 6 in Table 2 and one stacked-differences specification analogous to column 2 in Table 3. We see that the effects of robots concentrate in manufacturing and especially in heavily-robotized industries, which include automobile manufacStatistics on the percent increase in the capital stock for three-digit industries together with the distribution of employment across these industries in a commuting zone.  \n\nThe measure of computers per worker by commuting zone comes from the Harte-Hanks dataset, which is a private, establishment-level survey on technology use. It provides detailed information about specific technologies. For this study, there are 121,966 observations in 1990 and 473,091 in 2006 (see Doms and Lewis, 2006). We aggregate these data to the commuting-zone level by establishment location.  \n\nWe have also experimented and obtained very similar results with Bartik-style measures of computer adoption based on the Harte-Hanks data aggregated at the industry level, CPS data on computer use at the industry level, and Bureau of Economic Analysis data on investments on IT at the industry level. These results can be found in Table A9 in the Appendix.  \n\n$^{32}$ That the inclusion of these variables does not change the coeficient on our exposure to robots variable is not surprising in view of the fact that they are not correlated with our measure once condition on the other covariates. For example, controlling for the covariates in our baseline specification in column 4 of Table 2, the correlation between our measure and the capital intensity measure is -0.13, while the correlation between our measure and the computer measure is -0.03. This lack of strong correlation between exposure to robots and these capital utilization and computer variables can also be seen in Figure 2, and is even more reassuring for our interpretation.  \n\nturing, electronics, metal products, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastic, food, glass and ceramics (see Figure 4). We also see negative but smaller effects in construction, business services, wholesale, and services and retail. Only three sectors show positive effects in some specifications (but these effects are not consistent or robust). These are finance, the public sector and nonrobotized manufacturing, which includes recycling, basic metals, textiles, paper, furniture and transportation equipment other than automobiles.  \n\nFigure 1l presents analogous results for employment by occupation. We see negative effects of robots on essentially all occupations, with the exception of managers for which we estimate a zero effect in our baseline specification (though there are also negative effects in some other specifications as depicted in the figure). Predictably, the major categories experiencing substantial declines are routine manual occupations, blue-collar workers, operators and assembly workers, and machinists and transport workers.33  \n\nFigure 12 looks at the impact of robots on employment and wages in different education groups.34 We see negative employment and wage effects for workers with less than high school, with a high school degree, and with some college (this is true both for men and women). We also find a small and marginally significant negative effect on employment for workers with college, and no effect on employment and wages for workers with post-college degrees. We find it surprising that there is no positive effect on workers with more than a college degree. One interpretation, consistent with the results in Table 7, is that, in contrast to other computerassisted technologies, industrial robots may not be complementing any well-defined group of workers in a local labor market.  \n\nFigure 13 turns to the effect of robots on the wage distribution. We summarize these effects parsimoniously by depicting the impact of our exposure to robots variable on different percentiles of the wage distribution in a commuting zone. Our results indicate that the negative effects of robots are concentrated in the bottom half of the distribution; as a result, we estimate that robots may have increased the 90-10 wage differential by as much as 1 percentage point between 1990 and 2007 (the overall increase in this differential during this time period is 12 percentage points).  \n\n## 5.10  Total and Non-Labor Income  \n\nTable 9 turns to various measures of total income and non-labor income from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the IRS. Non-labor income is particularly interesting, since if our results are explained by some general downward trend in a commuting zone, we may expect a negative association with non-labor income. In contrast, if it is robots that are negatively affecting employment and wages, they should also benefit their owners and possibly capital holders. However, since the owners of robots and capital holders are unlikely to be located in the same commuting zones where robots are being installed, we should expect no significant effects on non-labor sources of income. This is the pattern we find in Table 9. Total income and wage income from the BEA (both in logs and levels) both decline between 1990 and 2007, but there is no negative effect on non-labor sources of income. The bottom three panels show very similar results with the IRS data. Overall, these results show that the effects of robots are felt exactly where they should be, in labor income, with no effects on non-labor incomes.  \n\n## 5.11  Back to Quantitative Magnitudes  \n\nWe conclude our analysis by returning to the quantitative magnitudes discussion. Figure 10 shows that there are negative effects beyond industries with the highest exposure to robots. In particular, we see lower employment in construction, business services, wholesale, and service and retail. A possible reason for these negative effects is that the decline in employment in industries that are adopting the robots may have depressed local demand and spilled over into a contraction in employment in other industries (e.g., as conjectured by Mian and Suf, 2014). Though such negative demand effects may also be present at the national level, as a more conservative estimate of the aggregate employment and wage effects of robots, we now carry out an alternative computation of quantitative magnitudes that leaves out these potential demand spillovers. To do this, we only take the employment decline in the heavily-robotized manufacturing as a share of the population, which is 0.2 percentage points (as opposed to the 0.37 percentage point decline for the total employment to population ratio in column 4 of Table 2). There is, however, no obvious way of purging the wage effects from these local demand spillovers without estimating the underlying structural parameters.  \n\nWe therefore proceed by choosing a range of parameters, and then also compute the portion of wage effects due to these local spillovers using the structure of our model of cross-commuting zone trade. Specifically, we choose the same parameter values, $\\varepsilon=0.43$ ， $\\sigma=1$ ， $\\lambda=7$ ， $s_{c,L}=0.66$ , and $\\pi_{c}=0.3$ , but also impose $\\eta=1.5$ , which was estimated from the employment and wage effects in our previous quantitative magnitudes computations. This only leaves $\\gamma$ as the unspecified parameter. Using the extent of employment decline in the heavily-robotized industries in an affected commuting zone, $\\beta^{L}=0.002$ , we can compute the implied value of $\\gamma$ as 300—which implies that every robot can perform the same amount of tasks as 3.3 workers. This is half the replacement rate we obtained above when we estimated $\\gamma$ to match the entire decline in employment in a commuting zone (this number is also in the range of estimates from recent case studies reported in BCG, 2015, but we find it somewhat more plausible than the implied value Of $1000/\\gamma=6.5$ when we do not take potential local demand spillovers into account).  \n\nArmed with these parameters, we can then decompose the total decline in wages as follows: 50 percent of the decline is due to the direct effects of robots and the remaining 50 percent is due to local demand spillovers. Combining these numbers with our trade model and assuming that local demand spillovers will not translate into aggregate effects, we obtain highly conservative, alternative estimates of the aggregate employment and wage consequences of robots. These are: one more robot per thousand workers in the economy reduces aggregate employment population ratio by 0.18 percentage points and aggregate wages by 0.25 percent (or equivalently, one worker reduces employment by 3 workers)  \n\nOverall, our summary of the quantitative magnitudes implied by our analysis is that one more robot reduces employment in a commuting zone with the average exposure to robots by 6.2 workers and one more robot per thousand employees reduce wages in such a commuting zone by about 0.73 percent (relative to a commuting zone with no exposure). Translating this into aggregate effects requires a range of assumptions, and our best-case range puts these aggregate effects between 3 and 5.6 workers losing their jobs as a result of the introduction of one more robot in the national economy, and wages declining between 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent as a result of one more robot per thousand employees.  \n\n# 6 CONCLUDING REMARKS  \n\nAutomation, robots and artificial intelligence are having an arguably transformative effect on labor markets in the United States and perhaps in many other advanced economies. Robots, in particular industrial robots, are anticipated to spread rapidly in the next several decades and assume tasks previously performed by labor. These momentous changes are accompanied by concerns about the future of jobs and wages. Nevertheless, there is relatively little work on the equilibrium effects of new technologies and especially of robots on labor market outcomes.  \n\nIn this paper, we estimate the impact of industrial robots on employment and wages in the United States between 1990 and 2007 on US local labor markets. We start with a simple task-based model in which robots compete against human labor in the production of different tasks. In this model, both with and without trade between labor markets, robots may have a positive or negative effect on employment and wages. Their positive impact comes from the productivity effect, while their negative impact is due to the direct displacement of workers by robots. More importantly for our purposes, we demonstrate that in this class of models, the local labor market effects of robots can be estimated by regressing the change in employment and wages on the exposure to robots in each local labor market—where the exposure to robots is defined as the sum over industries of the local fraction of the workforce in an industry times the national penetration of robots into that industry.  \n\nOur empirical work, in addition to utilizing these equations, attempts to exploit the exogenous component of the exposure to robots, coming from the technological frontier (as proxied by trends other advanced economies). This enables us to purge the exposure to robots variable from potentially endogenous trends refecting other industry-level developments in the US economy that may also be correlated with robot usage. Using this methodology and proxying local labor markets with commuting zones, we estimate large and robust negative effects of robots on employment and wages. We show that commuting zones most affected by robots in the post-1990 era were on similar trends to others before 1990, and that the impact of robots is distinct and only weakly correlated with the prevalence of routine jobs, the impact of imports from China, imports from Mexico, offshoring, other computer technology, and total capital stock. If there were no trade between commuting zones, our estimates would imply that each additional robot per thousand workers reduces aggregate employment to population ratio by 0.37 percentage points and aggregate wages by about 0.73 percent. If we factor in trade between commuting zones, our estimates instead imply somewhat smaller magnitudes: one additional robot per thousand workers now reduces aggregate employment to population ratio by 0.34 percentage points and aggregate wages by 0.5 percent. If, in addition, we focus only on declines in employment in heavily-robotized manufacturing, and presume that employment losses in other sectors are due to local demand and will not directly translate into national effects, these effects can be as low as 0.18 percentage points for employment and 0.25 percent for wages.  \n\nBecause there are relatively few robots in the US economy, the number of jobs lost due to robots has been limited so far (ranging between 360,000 and 670,000 jobs, equivalent to a 0.18- 0.34 percentage point decline in the employment to population ratio). However, if the spread of robots proceeds as expected by experts over the next two decades (e.g., Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2012, especially pp. 27-32, and Ford, 2016), the future aggregate implications of the spread of robots could be much more sizable. For example, BCG (2015) offers two scenarios for the spread of robots over the next decade. In their aggressive scenario, the world stock of robots will quadruple by 2025. This would correspond to 5.25 more robots per thousand workers in the United States, and with our estimates, it would lead to a 0.94-1.76 percentage points lower employment to population ratio and 1.3-2.6 percent lower wage growth between 2015 and 2025. Their more conservative scenario involves a less than threefold increase in the stock of robots, and would correspondingly have a more modest impact (a reduction of 0.54- 1 percentage point decline in the employment to population ratio and 0.75-1.5 percent lower wage growth). Crucially, however, any such extrapolation should acknowledge that some of the general equilibrium effects working through technology might emerge only slowly (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2016), and the response of employment and wages may be different once the number of robots exceeds a critical threshold.  \n\nWe view our paper as a first step in a comprehensive evaluation of how robots will affect, and are already affecting, the labor market equilibrium. It is indeed only a first step, because our methodology directly estimates only the effect of robots on employment in a commuting zone relative to other commuting zones that have become less exposed to robots. We then used the structure of a model of trade between commuting zones to infer the aggregate effects of robots. Alternative strategies of estimating the aggregate implications of the spread of robots, either by focusing on cross-country comparisons or by directly or indirectly measuring the fows of goods across local labor markets, would be obviously highly complementary to this approach. Also missing from our study is any technological response to the changes in factor prices resulting from the introduction of robots (e.g., the creation of new labor-intensive tasks as in Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2016). Nonetheless, we do believe that our methodology's ability to estimate withinlabor market responses, which include the creation of jobs in other industries and occupations, is an important advantage, and any national or more comprehensive analysis of the effects of robots will have to start from such local equilibrium impacts. In this respect, we believe as well that the negative effects we estimate are both interesting and perhaps somewhat surprising, especially because they indicate a very limited set of offsetting employment increases in other industries and occupations.  \n\n# REFERENCES  \n\nAcemoglu, Daron, David Autor and David Lyle (2004) “Women, War, and Wages: The Effect of Female Labor Supply on the Wage Structure at Midcentury,” Journal of Political Economy, 112(3): 497-551.

All regressions, except those in columns 5 and 6, are weighted by working-age population in 1990. The dependent variable is the change in Census private employment to population ratio between 1990 and 2007 in Panel A, the change in employment to population ratio between 1990 and 2007 from the County Business Patterns in Panel B, the change between 1990 and 2007 in the log hourly wage in Panel C, and the change between 1990 and 2007 in the log weekly wage in Panel D. The models in Panels A and B have one observation per commuting zone, while the specifications in Panels C and D are estimated at the demographic cell $\\times$ commuting zone level. Demographic cells are defined by age, gender, education, race, birthplace and relationship to household head. The specifications in column 1 only include Census division dummies. The specifications in column 2 also include baseline demographic characteristics of commuting zones in 1990 (population, the share of working-age population, the share of population with college and with completed high school, the share of Blacks, Hispanics Asians). Column 3 also includes the baseline shares of employment in manufacturing, durable manufacturing, construction, and the share of female employment in manufacturing in 1990. Column 4 also includes the exposure to Chinese imports, Mexican imports, offshoring of intermediate goods and the baseline share of employment in routine jobs in 1990 (see text for the construction of the sources of these variables). Column 5 is the same as column 4, but unweighted. Column 6 reports Li's robust regression, which downweight outliers (see text for details). Column 7 excludes the top $1\\%$ commutingzoneswith the highest exposure to robots from the sample. Standard errors are robust against heteroscedasticity and allow for arbitrary clustering at the state level. The coefficients with $***$ are significant at the $1\\%$ confidence level; with $^{\\ast\\ast}$ are significant at the $5\\%$ confidence level; and with \\* are significant at the $10\\%$ confidence level.  \n\nTABLE 3: The impact of the exposure to robots on employment and wages (stacked differences)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"7\">STACKED-DIFFERENCES ESTIMATES 1990-2000 AND 2000-2007</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"7\">Panel A.

All regressions, except those in columns 3 and 4, are weighted by working-age population in 1990. The dependent variable is the change in the Census private employment to population ratio in Panel A, the change in the employment to population ratio from the County Business Patterns in Panel B, the change in the log hourly wage in Panel C, and he change in the log weekly wage in Panel D. The models in Panels A and B have two observation per commuting zone (1990-2000 and 2000- 2007). The specifications in Panels C and D are estimated at the demographic cell $\\times$ commuting zone level and have two observations for each cell (one for the change in wages from 1990 to 2000 and another for the change in wages from 2000 to 2007). Demographic cells are defined by age, gender, education, race, birthplace and relationship to household head. The specifications in column 1 include Census division dummies; baseline demographic characteristics of commuting zones at the beginning of each decade (population, the share of working-age population, the share of population with college and with completed high school, the share of Blacks, Hispanics Asians); and the baseline shares of employment in manufacturing, durable manufacturing, construction, and the share of female employment in manufacturing at the beginning of each decade. Column 2 also includes the exposure to Chinese imports, Mexican imports, ofshoring of intermediate goods and the baseline share of employment in routine jobs (see text for the construction of the sources of these variables). Column 3 is the same as column 2, but unweighted. Column 4 reports Li's robust regressions, which downweight outliers (see the text for details). Column 5 excludes the top $1\\%$ commuting zones with the highest exposure to robots from the sample. Column 6 is the same as column 2 but it also includes commuting zone fixed effects.

All regressions, except those in columns 5 and 6, are weighted by working-age population in 1990. Panel A shows the first-stage relationship between the exposure to robots computed from data on the adoption of robots by US industries between 2004 and 2007 (converted to a 17-year equivalent change and in terms of robots per thousand people) against the exposure to robots from 1993 to 2007. The dependent variable is the change in Census private employment to population ratio between 1990 and 2007 in Panel B, the change in employment to population ratio between 1990 and 2007 from the County Business Patterns in Panel C, the change between 1990 and 2007 in the log hourly wage in Panel D, and the change between 1990 and 2007 in the log weekly wage in Panel E. The models in Panels A, B and C have one observation per commuting zone, while the specifications in Panels D and E are estimated at the demographic cell $\\times$ commuting zone level. Demographic cells are defined by age, gender, education, race, birthplace and relationship to household head. The specifications in column 1 only include Census division dummies. The specifications in column 2 also include baseline demographic characteristics of commuting zones in 1990 (population, the share of working-age population, the share of population with college and with completed high school, the share of Blacks, Hispanics Asians). Column 3 also includes the baseline shares of employment in manufacturing, durable manufacturing, construction, and the share of female employment in manufacturing in 1990. Column 4 also includes the exposure to Chinese imports, Mexican imports, offshoring of intermediate goods and the baseline share of employment in routine jobs in 1990 (see text for the construction of the sources of these variables). Column 5 is the same as column 4,but unweighted. Column 6 reports Li's robust regressions, which downweight outliers (see the text for details). Column 7 excludes the top $1\\%$ commuting zones with the highest exposure to robots from the sample. Standard errors are robust against heteroscedasticity and allow for arbitrary clustering at the state level. The coefficients with $***$ are significant at the $1\\%$ confidence level; with $\\ast\\ast$ are significant at the $5\\%$ confidence level; and with \\* are significant at the $10\\%$ confidence level.  \n\nTABLE 5: Placebo checks.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"7\">PLACEBO CHECKS USING OUTCOMES FOR 1970-1990</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td><td>(7)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"8\">Panel A.

The dependent variable is the change in Census private employment to population ratio in columns 1 to 3, and the change in the log hourly wage in columns 4 to 6. Panel A shows estimates that control for a Bartik-style measure that interacts the national level decline in employment from 1970 to 1990 with the share of the commuting zone employment in that industry in 1990. Panel B shows estimates that control for a Bartik-style measure that interacts the national level growth in the capital stock from 1990 to 2007 with the share of the commuting zone employment in that industry in 1990. This measure is constructed using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics available at the three-digit industry level. Panel C shows estimates that control for the increase in the number of computers per worker between 1990 and 2006 (from the Harte-Hanks data). The specifications in columns 1 to 3 are estimated at the commuting-zone level; while the specifications in columns 4 to 6 are estimated at the demographic cell $\\times$ commuting zone level. Demographic cells are defined by age, gender, education, race and relationship to household head. All specifications include Census division dummies; baseline demographic characteristics of commuting zones (population, the share of working-age population, the share of population with college and with completed high school, the share of Blacks, Hispanics Asians); the baseline shares of employment in manufacturing, durable manufacturing, construction, and the share of female employment in manufacturing; and the exposure to Chinese imports, Mexican imports, offshoring of intermediate goods and the baseline share of employment in routine jobs (see text for the construction of the sources of these variables). The regressions in columns 1 and 4 are weighted by working-age population in 1990. Columns 2 and 5 show unweighted regressions.

Existence and uniqueness of this equilibrium follow using analogous arguments to the static model in Acemoglu and Restrepo (2016).  \n\n### Proof of Proposition 2:  \n\nTo prove this proposition, we use two lemmas that establish how prices and output change as a result of the use of additional robots.  \n\nLEMMA A1 Let $s_{c L}$ and $s_{c R}$ denote the share of labor and robots, respectively. Then  \n\n$$\nd\\ln Y_{c}=s_{c L}\\pi_{c}\\sum_{i\\in\\cal{I}}\\ell_{c i}\\frac{d M_{i}}{1-M_{i}}+s_{c L}d\\ln L_{c}+s_{s R}d\\ln R_{c}.\n$$  \n\nPROOF. Holding $L_{c}$ and $R_{c}$ constant, the allocation of labor and robots to tasks and sectors maximizes output. Therefore, the envelope theorem implies that:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{{\\displaystyle d\\ln Y_{c}\\mid_{L_{c},R_{c}}=\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{L}}s_{c i}d\\ln X_{c i}\\mid_{L_{c i},R_{c i}}}}&{{}}\\ {{\\qquad=\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{L}}s_{c i}\\frac{1}{A_{c i}P_{X c i}}\\left(\\frac{W_{c}}{\\gamma}-Q_{c}\\right)d M_{i},}}&{{}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwith $\\begin{array}{r}{s_{c i}=\\frac{P_{X c i}X_{c i}}{Y_{c}}}\\end{array}$ denoting the share of industry $i$ in total output.  \n\nThe previous expression can be rewritten as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c l}{\\displaystyle d\\ln Y_{c}\\left|_{L_{c},R_{c}}=\\sum_{i\\in\\cal Z}\\frac{P_{X c i}X_{c i}}{Y_{c}}\\frac{1}{A_{c i}P_{X c i}}\\left(\\frac{W_{c}}{\\gamma}-Q_{c}\\right)d M_{i}}\\ {\\displaystyle}&{\\displaystyle~=\\sum_{i\\in\\cal Z}\\frac{\\gamma L_{c i}}{Y_{c}}\\left(\\frac{W_{c}}{\\gamma}-Q_{c}\\right)\\frac{d M_{i}}{1-M_{i}}}\\ {\\displaystyle}&{\\displaystyle~=\\sum_{i\\in\\cal Z}\\frac{s_{c L}\\gamma L_{c i}}{W_{c}L_{c}}\\left(\\frac{W_{c}}{\\gamma}-Q_{c}\\right)\\frac{d M_{i}}{1-M_{i}}}\\ {\\displaystyle}&{\\displaystyle~=s_{c L}\\pi_{c}\\sum_{i\\in\\cal Z}\\ell_{c i}\\frac{d M_{i}}{1-M_{i}}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nAn additional application of the envelope theorem yields  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{d{\\ln}Y_{c}=d{\\ln}Y_{c}\\:|_{L_{c},R_{c}}+s_{c L}d{\\ln}L_{c}+s_{c R}d{\\ln}R_{c},}}\\ {{{\\qquad=s_{c L}\\pi_{c}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{I}}\\ell_{c i}\\frac{d M_{i}}{1-M_{i}}+s_{c L}d{\\ln}L_{c}+s_{c R}d{\\ln}R_{c},}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\ncompleting the proof of the lemma.  \n\nLEMMA A2 Let $s_{i c L}$ and $s_{i c R}$ denote the share of labor and robots in industry $i$ , respectively. Then:  \n\n$$\nd\\ln P_{X c i}=-s_{i c L}\\pi_{c}\\frac{d M_{i}}{1-M_{i}}+s_{i c L}d\\ln W_{c}+s_{i s R}d\\ln Q_{c}.\n$$  \n\nPROOF. This lemma follows from differentiating the formula for prices in equation (A3), which vields  \n\n$$\nd\\ln P_{X c i}=\\frac{1}{A_{c i}P_{X c i}}\\left(Q_{c}-\\frac{W_{c}}{\\gamma}\\right)d M_{i}+s_{i c L}d\\ln W_{c}+s_{i s R}d\\ln Q_{c}.\n$$  \n\nWe can rewrite this expression as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{d\\ln P_{X c i}=\\displaystyle-\\frac{W_{c}}{\\gamma A_{c i}P_{X c i}}\\pi_{c}d M_{i}+s_{i c L}d\\ln W_{c}+s_{i s R}d\\ln Q_{c}}\\ {~=\\displaystyle-\\frac{W_{c}(1-M_{i})}{\\gamma A_{c i}P_{X c i}}\\pi_{c}\\frac{d M_{i}}{1-M_{i}}+s_{i c L}d\\ln W_{c}+s_{i s R}d\\ln Q_{c}}\\ {~=-s_{i c L}\\pi_{c}\\frac{d M_{i}}{1-M_{i}}+s_{i c L}d\\ln W_{c}+s_{i s R}d\\ln Q_{c},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere in the last step we used the fact that $\\begin{array}{r}{s_{i c L}=\\frac{W_{c}(1-M_{i})}{\\gamma A_{c i}P_{X c i}}}\\end{array}$ Wa(l-M) . The lst line establishes the lemma  \n\nTo complete the proof of the proposition, we substitute the expressions from these lemmas in the labor demand equation to obtain:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c l}{d\\ln{\\cal L}_{c}=-\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in\\cal Z}\\ell_{c i}\\frac{d M_{i}}{1-M_{i}}+\\sigma\\pi_{c}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in\\cal Z}s_{i c L}\\ell_{c i}\\frac{d M_{i}}{1-M_{i}}-\\sigma(s_{c L}d\\ln{W_{c}}+s_{c R}d\\ln{Q_{c}})}\\ {\\displaystyle~+s_{c L}\\pi_{c}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in\\cal Z}\\ell_{c i}\\frac{d M_{i}}{1-M_{i}}+s_{c L}d\\ln{{\\cal L}_{c}}+s_{s R}d\\ln{{\\cal R}_{c}}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIn addition, differentiating the equation $Y_{c}=W_{c}L_{c}+Q_{c}R_{c}$ yields  \n\n$$\ns_{c L}\\pi_{c}\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{I}}\\ell_{c i}\\frac{d M_{i}}{1-M_{i}}=s_{c L}d\\ln W_{c}+s_{c R}d\\ln Q_{c}.\n$$  \n\nCombining equations (A4） and  \n\n(A5) with the supply equations, written in log differential form as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{d\\ln W_{c}=s_{c L}(d\\ln L_{c}+d\\ln W_{c})+s_{c R}(d\\ln R_{c}+d\\ln Q_{c})+\\varepsilon d\\ln L_{c}}\\ &{\\quad{d\\ln Q_{c}=}\\eta d\\ln R_{c}-\\eta s_{c L}(d\\ln L_{c}+d\\ln W_{c})-\\eta s_{c R}(d\\ln R_{c}+d\\ln Q_{c}),}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwe obtain a system of four equations and four unknowns: $d\\ln L_{c},d\\ln R_{c},d\\ln W_{c}$ ,and $d\\ln Q_{c}$ The solution to this linear system of equations is given by the expressions provided in equations (5) and (6), which completes the proof.  \n\n## A2  PROOFS FOR EQUILIBRIUM WITH TRADE ACROSS COMMUTING ZONES  \n\n### Proof of Proposition 3:  \n\nThe first-order condition for the consumption aggregate of industry $i$ in commuting zone $d$ yields  \n\n$$\nY_{d i}=\\alpha_{i}^{\\sigma}P_{Y i}^{-\\sigma}Y_{d}.\n$$  \n\nSimilarly, the demand in commuting zone $d$ for the variety of the product from industry $i$ sourced from commuting zone $c$ is  \n\n$$\nX_{c d i}=\\theta_{c i}^{\\lambda}P_{X c i}^{-\\lambda}P_{Y i}^{\\lambda}Y_{d i}=\\alpha_{i}^{\\sigma}\\theta_{c i}^{\\lambda}P_{X c i}^{-\\lambda}P_{Y i}^{\\lambda-\\sigma}Y_{d}.\n$$  \n\nAggregating across commuting zones, the total demand for the variety of industry $i$ sourced from commuting zone $c$ is  \n\n$$\nX_{c i}=\\sum_{d\\in\\mathcal{C}}X_{c d i}=\\alpha_{i}^{\\sigma}\\theta_{c i}^{\\lambda}P_{X c i}^{-\\lambda}P_{Y i}^{\\lambda-\\sigma}\\sum_{d\\in\\mathcal{C}}Y_{d}.\n$$  \n\nAs in the closed economy, the demand for labor and robots in industry $i$ is given by equation (A1). Aggregating across industries, we obtain the total demand for labor and the total demand for robots as  \n\n$$\nL_{c}^{d}=\\sum_{i\\in\\cal Z}\\frac{\\alpha_{i}^{\\sigma}\\theta_{c i}^{\\lambda}}{\\gamma A_{c i}}(1-M_{i})P_{X c i}^{-\\lambda}P_{Y i}^{\\lambda-\\sigma}Y\\qquad\\mathrm{~and~}\\qquadR_{c}^{d}=\\sum_{i\\in\\cal Z}\\frac{\\alpha_{i}^{\\sigma}\\theta_{c i}^{\\lambda}}{A_{c i}}M_{i}P_{X c i}^{-\\lambda}P_{Y i}^{\\lambda-\\sigma}Y,\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\textstyle Y=\\sum_{d\\in{\\mathcal{C}}}Y_{d}$ is national output.  \n\nProposition 3 then follows by log differentiating the equation for labor demand in (A6).  \n\nCharacterization of the Equilibrium When Commuting Zones Trade As in the autarky equilibrium, prices are equal to unit costs given in equation (A3).

We can rewrite the above equations as a system of equations in $P_{c}$ and $\\Delta_{c}$ as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{P_{c}=(1-M){\\mathcal{W}}_{c}\\gamma^{-1-\\varepsilon}\\left[\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in{\\mathcal{Z}}}\\zeta_{c a}(1-M_{i})\\left(P_{c}+m_{i}\\Delta_{c}\\right)^{-\\lambda}\\left(\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in{\\mathcal{Z}}}\\zeta_{c i}\\left(P_{c}+m_{i}\\Delta_{c}\\right)^{1-\\lambda}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^{2}}}\\right]}\\ &{\\qquad+M Q_{c}\\left[\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in{\\mathcal{Z}}}\\zeta_{c i}M_{i}\\left(P_{c}+m_{i}\\Delta_{c}\\right)^{-\\lambda}\\left(\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in{\\mathcal{Z}}}\\zeta_{c i}\\left(P_{c}+m_{i}\\Delta_{c}\\right)^{1-\\lambda}\\right)^{1-\\lambda}\\right]^{\\eta},}\\ &{\\qquad\\Delta_{c}=Q_{c}\\left[\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in{\\mathcal{Z}}}\\zeta_{c i}M_{i}\\left(P_{c}+m_{i}\\Delta_{c}\\right)^{-\\lambda}\\left(\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in{\\mathcal{Z}}}\\zeta_{c i}\\left(P_{c}+m_{i}\\Delta_{c}\\right)^{1-\\lambda}\\right)^{-1}\\right]^{\\eta}}\\ &{\\qquad-{\\mathcal{W}}_{c}\\gamma^{-1-\\varepsilon}\\left[\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in{\\mathcal{Z}}}\\zeta_{c i}(1-M_{i})\\left(P_{c}+m_{i}\\Delta_{c}\\right)^{-\\lambda}\\left(\\displaystyle\\sum_{i\\in{\\mathcal{Z}}}\\zeta_{c i}\\left(P_{c}+m_{i}\\Delta_{c}\\right)^{1-\\lambda}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^{2}}}\\right]^{\\varepsilon}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nWe now prove that there exists an $\\overline{{m}}>0$ , such that, for maxi $m_{i}<\\overline{{m}}$ the system of equations (A8) and (A9) has a unique solution. We show this using the implicit function theorem. Let $m$ designate the vector of $m_{i}$ 's and $\\zeta_{c}$ the vector of $\\zeta_{c i}$ 's. When $m=0$ , equation (A8) becomes  \n\n$$\nP_{c}=(1-M)^{1+\\varepsilon}\\mathcal{W}_{c}\\gamma^{-1-\\varepsilon}P_{c}^{-\\lambda(1+\\varepsilon)+1}\\left[\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{I}}\\zeta_{c i}\\right]^{1+\\varepsilon}+M^{1+\\eta}P_{c}^{-\\eta}.\n$$  \n\nThis equation uniquely determines a value for $P_{c}$ independent of $m$ , which we denote by $P_{c}^{o}$ In addition, this value of $P_{c}^{o}$ can be substituted into equation (A9) to determine a unique $\\Delta_{c}$ ， which we denote by $\\Delta_{c}^{o}>0$  \n\n$$\n\\Delta_{c}=M^{1+\\eta}P_{c}^{-\\eta}-(1-M)^{1+\\varepsilon}{\\mathcal{W}}_{c}\\gamma^{-1-\\varepsilon}P_{c}^{-\\lambda(1+\\varepsilon)+1}\\left[\\sum_{i\\in{\\mathcal{I}}}\\zeta_{c i}\\right]^{1+\\varepsilon}.\n$$  \n\n(Assumption 1 ensures that $\\Delta_{c}^{o}>0$ , which in turn requires $\\mathcal{W}_{c}$ to be small relative to $\\mathcal{Q}_{c}$ ,sO that labor is scarce and expensive relative to robots).  \n\nThe previous argument shows that at $m\\:=\\:0$ ,equations (A8） and (A9) have a unique solution $\\{P_{c}^{o},\\Delta_{c}^{o}\\}$ .Moreover, the equations (A8） and (A9） are continuously diferentiable in the neighborhood of $m=0$ , implying that the Jacobian of the system of equations is not zero (equation (A2)only depends on $P_{c}$ ; equation (A2） is monotone in $\\Delta_{c}$ ). Thus, the implicit function theorem applies and implies that there exists an $\\overline{{m}}>0$ and unique functions $P_{c}(m;\\zeta)$ and $\\Delta_{c}(m;\\zeta)$ that solve equations (A8） and (A9） for $\\operatorname*{max}_{i}m_{i}<\\overline{{m}}$ .Moreover, the functions $P_{c}(m;\\zeta)$ and $\\Delta_{c}(m;\\zeta)$ are continuously differentiable for $m<\\overline{{m}}$ , and equation (A2) establishes that $P_{c}^{o}$ is increasing in $\\zeta$ and that  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{i\\in\\mathbb{Z}}\\frac{\\partial P_{c}^{o}}{\\partial P_{Y i}}\\frac{P_{Y i}}{P_{c}^{o}}<\\frac{\\lambda-\\sigma}{\\lambda}.\n$$  \n\nBecause the functions $P_{c}(m;\\zeta)$ and $\\Delta_{c}(m;\\zeta)$ are continuous differentiable for $\\mathrm{max}_{i}m_{i}<\\overline{{m}}$ ， the function $P_{c i}(m;\\zeta)=P_{c}(m;\\zeta)+m_{i}\\Delta_{c}(m;\\zeta)$ inherits these properties near $m=0$ . Thus, there exists a $\\underline{m}\\in(0,\\overline{m}]$ such that, for $\\operatorname*{max}_{i}m_{i}<\\underline{m}$ , the function $P_{c i}(m;\\zeta)=P_{c}(m;\\zeta)+m_{i}\\Delta_{c}(m;\\zeta)$ is increasing in $\\zeta$ for all $i$ and  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{T}}\\frac{\\partial P_{c i}(m;\\zeta)}{\\partial P_{Y i}}\\frac{P_{Y i}}{P_{c i}(m;\\zeta))}<\\frac{\\lambda-\\sigma}{\\lambda}.\n$$  \n\nTo complete the proof, we demonstrate that there is a unique output and vector of industry prices that are consistent with equilibrium. Let $P_{Y}$ denote the vector $(P_{Y1},\\dots,P_{Y|\\mathcal{Z}|})$ , and also let $P_{c i}(P_{Y};Y)=P_{c}(m;\\zeta)+m_{i}\\Delta_{c}(m;\\zeta)$ be the unique equilibrium price, whose existence and uniqueness we just proved. We now establish that, holding $Y$ constant, there is a unique vector of equilibrium prices $P_{Y i}$ . In particular, we show that there is a unique vector of prices that satisfies equation (A7), and which can be written as:  \n\n$$\nP_{Y i}=g(P_{Y};Y)\\equiv\\left(\\sum_{c\\in\\mathcal{C}}\\theta_{c i}^{\\lambda}A_{c i}^{\\lambda-1}P_{c i}(P_{Y};Y)^{1-\\lambda}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1-\\lambda}}.\n$$  \n\nThe elasticity of $g(P_{Y};Y)$ with respect to $P_{Y}$ is  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{j\\in\\mathbb{Z}}\\frac{\\partial g(P_{Y};Y)}{\\partial P_{Y_{j}}}\\frac{P_{Y j}}{g(P_{Y};Y)}=\\sum_{c\\in\\mathcal{C}}\\chi_{c i}\\sum_{j\\in\\mathbb{Z}}\\frac{\\partial P_{c i}(P_{Y};Y)}{\\partial P_{Y j}}\\frac{P_{Y j}}{P_{c i}(P_{Y};Y)}<\\frac{\\lambda-\\sigma}{\\lambda}<1.\n$$  \n\nHere, $\\chi_{c i}$ denotes the share of varieties from commuting zone $c$ in industry $i$ ,whichsatisfies $\\begin{array}{r}{\\sum_{c}\\chi_{c i}=1}\\end{array}$ . The first inequality follows from equation (A10).  \n\nLet $p_{Y i}=\\ln P_{Y i}$ and $\\ln{p_{Y}}$ be the vector of log prices. We can then rewrite the system for prices as:  \n\n$$\np_{y}=\\widetilde{g}(p_{y};Y),\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\widetilde g$ is such that all row vectors in $\\nabla_{p_{y}}\\widetilde{g}$ have positive entries and sum to less than $\\scriptstyle{\\frac{\\lambda-\\sigma}{\\lambda}}$ This implies that the spectral norm of the matrix $\\nabla_{p_{y}}\\tilde{g}$ , which we denote by $\\rho(\\nabla_{p_{y}}\\widetilde{g})$ , is less than $\\scriptstyle{\\frac{\\lambda-\\sigma}{\\lambda}}$ . This follow from the fact that for any norm $||\\cdot||$ we have $\\rho(\\nabla_{p_{y}}\\widetilde{g})<||\\nabla_{p_{y}}\\widetilde{g}||$ . Taking the $||A||_{\\infty}$ norm, we can conclude that $\\rho(\\nabla_{p_{y}}\\widetilde{g})$ is less than the maximum over the sum of the absolute value of the elements in a row, which is less than $\\scriptstyle{\\frac{\\lambda-\\sigma}{\\lambda}}$  \n\nTo establish that the equation $p_{Y}=g(p_{Y};Y)$ has a unique solution, note that  \n\n$$\n||g(p;Y)-g(p^{\\prime};Y)||_{1}<\\rho(\\nabla_{p_{y}}\\widetilde{g})\\cdot||p-p^{\\prime}||_{1}\n$$  \n\nwhere $||\\cdot||_{1}$ denotes the $L_{1}$ norm. We can prove this inequality as follows: let $q_{i}$ be a vector equal to $p$ up to its $i-1$ th coordinate, and equal to $p^{\\prime}$ from there on. The mean value theorem implies that there is a vector $c_{i}$ in the line segment between $q_{i}$ and $q_{i+1}$ such that $g(q_{i};Y)-g(q_{i+1};Y)=\\nabla_{p_{y}}\\widetilde{g}(c_{i})(q_{i}-q_{i+1})$ . Thus, we have  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle||g(p;Y)-g(p^{\\prime};Y)||_{1}=||\\sum_{i=1}^{|\\mathcal{Z}|}g(q_{i};Y)-g(q_{i+1};Y)||_{1}}}\\ {{\\displaystyle~\\qquad<\\sum_{i=1}^{|\\mathcal{Z}|}||\\nabla_{p_{y}}\\tilde{g}(c_{i})(q_{i}-q_{i+1})||_{1}}}\\ {{\\displaystyle~<\\rho(\\nabla_{p_{\\mathfrak{s}}}\\tilde{g})\\sum_{i=1}^{|\\mathcal{Z}|}||p_{i}-p_{i}^{\\prime}||_{1}}}\\ {{\\displaystyle~=\\rho(\\nabla_{p_{\\mathfrak{s}}}\\tilde{g})||_{1}-p^{\\prime}||_{1}.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThis inequality ensures that the mapping $g(p_{Y};Y)$ is a contraction, and thus implies the existence and uniqueness of $p_{Y}$ . In addition, because $g(p_{Y};Y)$ is increasing in $Y$ , the resulting prices, the $P_{Y i}(Y)$ 's, are all increasing in $Y$ as well.  \n\nThe last step is to show there is a unique $Y$ . This follows from the ideal price index condition and the fact that each $P_{Y i}(Y)$ is increasing in $Y$  \n\n$$\n1=\\left(\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{I}}\\alpha_{i}^{\\sigma}P_{Y i}(Y)^{1-\\sigma}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1-\\sigma}}.\n$$  \n\nBecause the right-hand side is increasing in $Y$ , the ideal price index condition defines a unique value for it.■  \n\nWe next state and prove the analogue of Proposition 2 in the presence of trade across commuting zones. Since in our empirical work, we focus on the case where $M_{i}\\approx0$ for all $i$ weassume $M_{i}=M$ in the next proposition as well, significantly simplifying the expressions. We then use this result to derive the mapping between our model with trade and our empirical specifications. In what follows, as in the proof of Proposition A2, we use $\\chi_{c i}$ to denote the share of varieties from commuting zone $c$ in the total production of industry $i$ , and $\\pi$ to denote the average of the $\\pi_{c}$ 's across commuting zones.  \n\nPROPOsITION A3 Consider the economy with trade between commuting zones and suppose that $M_{i}=M$ .Then  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{\\operatorname{var}}&{\\leq(1+c)+(1+\\eta)(1-s_{d})/(s_{d}z\\lambda)^{-\\alpha}~(1+c)+(1+\\eta)(1-s_{d}/(s_{d}z\\lambda)/)~;}\\ &{+\\frac{(1+\\eta)(1-s_{d})/(s_{d}z\\lambda)}{(1+\\eta)(1-s_{d})(1-s_{d})/(s_{d}z\\lambda)}(\\sigma-\\lambda)\\sum_{\\ell}^{\\ell}\\left(\\alpha\\left(\\sum_{d=0}\\left(s_{d}\\alpha_{\\ell}z\\alpha-s_{\\ell}\\pi\\right)\\right)\\frac{d\\lambda}{1-\\lambda}\\right.}\\ &{\\left.+\\frac{(1+\\eta)(1-s_{d})/(s_{d}z\\lambda)/(s_{d}z\\lambda)}{(1-s_{d})(1-s_{d})/(s_{d}z\\lambda)}(\\sigma-\\lambda)(s_{\\ell}z-s_{d}z\\alpha)\\sum_{\\ell}^{\\ell}\\alpha\\frac{d\\lambda}{1-\\lambda}}\\ &{+\\frac{(1+\\eta)(1-s_{d}z)/(s_{d}z\\lambda)}{(1-s_{d})(1-s_{d})/(s_{d}z\\lambda)}(\\alpha\\ln\\gamma\\vert_{L_{\\infty}/\\alpha+1/(s_{d}z\\lambda)}+c_{\\ell}),}\\ &{+\\frac{(1+\\eta)(1-s_{d}z)/(s_{d}z\\lambda)}{(1+\\eta)(1-s_{d})/(s_{d}z\\lambda)}(\\alpha\\ln\\gamma\\vert_{L_{\\infty}/\\alpha+1/(s_{d}z\\lambda)}+c_{\\ell}),}\\ {\\operatorname{W}_{\\varepsilon}}&{=\\left(\\frac{1+\\eta+(1+\\eta)(1-s_{d}z)/(\\sigma-\\lambda)/(s_{d}z\\lambda)/}{1+(1+\\eta)(1-s_{d}z\\lambda)/(s_{d}z\\lambda)}(\\gamma-\\frac{\\eta-\\eta)/\\lambda}{1+(1+\\eta)(1-s_{d}z\\lambda)/(s_{d}z\\lambda)(1+\\varepsilon_{\\ell})}\\right)\\right),}\\ &{+\\frac{(1+\\eta)(1-s_{d}z)/(s_{d}z\\lambda)}{1+(1+\\eta)(1-s_{d}z\\lambda)/(s_{d}z\\lambda)(1+\\varepsilon_{\\ell})}(\\sigma-\\lambda)\\sum_{\\ell}^{\\ell}\\left(\\alpha\\left(\\sum_{d=0}(s_{d}\\alpha_{\\ell}z\\\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\mathcal{I}_{c}=\\left(\\sum_{d\\in\\mathcal{C}}s_{d}(s_{d L}d\\ln L_{d}+s_{d R}d\\ln R_{d})+(\\lambda-\\sigma)\\sum_{i}\\ell_{c i}\\sum_{d\\in\\mathcal{C}}\\chi_{d i}(s_{d L}d\\ln W_{d}+s_{d R}d\\ln Q_{d})\\right).\n$$  \n\ncorresponds to the impact of national changes in prices and quantities on commuting zone c.  \n\nPROoF.

Allregressions, except those in column 5, are weighted by working-age population in 1990. Panel A shows estimates using the log of one plus the number of integrators in a commuting zone as the dependent variable. Panel B shows estimates from a Poisson model using the number of integrators in a commuting zone as the dependent variable. Panel C shows estimates using the number of integrators in a commuting zone as the dependent variable. All models have one observation per commuting zone. The specifications in column 1 only include Census division dummies. The specifications in column 2 also include baseline demographic characteristics of commuting zones in 1990 (population, the share of working-age population, the share of population with college and with completed high school, the share of Blacks, Hispanics Asians). Column 3 also includes the baseline shares of employment in manufacturing, durable manufacturing, construction, and the share of female employment in manufacturing in 1990. Column 4 also includes the exposure to Chinese imports, Mexican imports, offshoring of intermediate goods and the baseline share of employment in routine jobs in 1990 (see text for the construction of the sources of these variables). Column 5 is the same as column 4, but unweighted. Column 6 excludes the top $1\\%$ commuting zones with the highest exposure to robots from the sample.

All regressions, except those in columns 5 and 6, are weighted by working-age population in 1990. Panel A shows the frst-stage relationship between the exposure to robots computed from data on the adoption of robots by US industries between 2004 and 2007 (in terms of robots per thousand people) against the exposure to robots from 2004 to 2007. The dependent variable is the in employment to population ratio between 2004 and 2007 from the County Business Patterns in Panels A and B, and the change between 2004 and 2010 in Panels C and D. All models have one observation per commuting zone. The specifications in column 1 only include Census division dummies. The specifications in column 2 also include baseline demographic characteristics of commuting zones in 1990 (population, the share of working-age population, the share of population with college and with completed high school, the share of Blacks, Hispanics Asians). Column 3 also includes the baseline shares of employment in manufacturing, durable manufacturing, construction, and the share of female employment in manufacturing in 1990. Column 4 also includes the exposure to Chinese imports, Mexican imports, offshoring of intermediate goods and the baseline share of employment in routine jobs in 1990 (see text for the construction of the sources of these variables). Column 5 is the same as column 4, but unweighted. Column 6 reports Li's robust regressions, which downweight outliers (see the text for details). Column 7 excludes the top $1\\%$ commuting zones with the highest exposure to robots from the sample. Standard errors are robust against heteroscedasticity and allow for arbitrary clustering at the state level. The coefficients with $^{\\ast\\ast\\ast}$ are significant at the $1\\%$ confidence level; with $^{\\ast\\ast}$ are significant at the $5\\%$ confidence level; and with \\* are significant at the $10\\%$ confidence level.  \n\nTABLE A9: The impact of the exposure to robots on employment and wages (controlling for IT capital).   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"3\">HARTE-HANKS DATA ON USE OF COMPUTERS</td><td colspan=\"3\">CPS DATA ON COMPUTER USE AT WORK</td><td colspan=\"3\">BEA DATA ON IT INVESTMENT</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td><td>(7)</td><td>(8)</td><td>(9)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\">Panel A.

Columns 4 to 6 present stacked-differences estimates of the impact of the exposure to robots on employment and wages. The dependent variable is the change in Census private employment to population ratio in Panel A, the change in employment to population ratio from the County Business Patterns in Panel B, the change in the log hourly wage in Panel C, and the change in the log weekly wage in Panel D. The specifications in Panels A and B are estimated at the commuting-zone level; while the specifications in Panels C and D are estimated at the demographic cell $\\times$ commuting zone level. Demographic cells are defined by age, gender, education, race, birthplace and relationship to household head. All specifications include Census division dummies; baseline demographic characteristics of commuting zones (population, the share of working-age population, the share of population with college and with completed high school, the share of Blacks, Hispanics Asians); the baseline shares of employment in manufacturing, durable manufacturing, construction, and the share of female employment in manufacturing; and the exposure to Chinese imports, Mexican imports, offshoring of intermediate goods and the baseline share of employment in routine jobs (see text for the construction of the sources of these variables). Also, In columns 1-3 we use Harte-Hanks data to control for a Bartik-style measure that projects the increase in the number of computers by worker at the 4-digit industry-level onto commuting zones. In columns 4-6 we use CPS data to control for a Bartik-style measure that projects the increase in the share of people who use a computer at work for 4-digit industries onto commuting zones. In columns 7-9 we use BEA data to control for a Bartik-style measure that projects the percent increase in software and computer investments for 2-digit industries (at the same level of aggregation as our robot exposure measure) onto commuting zones. The regressions in columns 1, 4, and 7 are weighted by working-age population in 1990. Columns 2, 5, and 8 show unweighted regressions. Columns 3, 6, and 9 report Li's robust regressions, which downweight outliers (see the text for details).

Demographic cells are defined by age, gender, education, race, birthplace and relationship to household head. All specifications include Census division dummies; baseline demographic characteristics of commuting zones (population, the share of working-age population, the share of population with college and with completed high school, the share of Blacks, Hispanics Asians); the baseline shares of employment in manufacturing, durable manufacturing, construction, and the share of female employment in manufacturing; and the exposure to Chinese imports, Mexican imports, offshoring of intermediate goods and the baseline share of employment in routine jobs (see text for the construction of the sources of these variables). Also, all specifications include the baseline level of the dependent variable as a control. The regressions in columns 1 and 4 are weighted by working-age population in 1990. Columns 2 and 5 show unweighted regressions. Columns 3 and 6 report Li's robust regressions, which downweight outliers (see the text for details).

In a static version where capital is fixed and technology is exogenous, automation reduces employment and the labor share,and may even reduce wages, while the creation of new tasks has the opposite effects. Our full model endogenizes capital accumulation and the direction of research toward automation and the creation of newtasks.If the long-run rental rate of capital relative to the wage is sufficiently low, the long-run equilibrium involves automation of all tasks. Otherwise, there exists a stable balanced growth path in which the two types of innovations go hand-in-hand. Stability is a consequence of the fact that automation reduces the cost of producing using labor, and thus discourages further automation and encourages the creation of new tasks. In an extension with heterogeneous skills, we show that inequality increases during transitions driven both by faster automationandtheintroductionofnewtasks,andcharacterize the conditions under which inequality stabilizes in the long run. (JEL D63, E22, E23, E24, J24, 033, 041)  \n\nThe accelerated automation of tasks performed by labor raises concerns that new technologies will make labor redundant (e.g., Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014; Akst 2013; Autor 2015). The recent declines in the labor share in national income and the employment to population ratio in the United States (e.g., Karabarbounis and Neiman 2014; Oberfield and Raval 2014) are often interpreted as evidence for the claims that as digital technologies, robotics, and artificial intelligence penetrate the economy, workers will find it increasingly difficult to compete against machines, and their compensation will experience a relative or even absolute decline.  \n\nYet, we lack a comprehensive framework incorporating such effects, as well as potential countervailing forces.  \n\nThe need for such a framework stems not only from the importance of understanding how and when automation will transform the labor market, but also from the fact that similar claims have been made, but have not always come true, about previous waves of new technologies. Keynes famously foresaw the steady increase in per capita income during the twentieth century from the introduction of new technologies, but incorrectly predicted that this would create widespread technological unemployment as machines replaced human labor (Keynes 1930). In 1965, economic historian Robert Heilbroner confidently stated that “as machines continue to invade society, duplicating greater and greater numbers of social tasks, it is human labor itself—at least, as we now think of “labor'—that is gradually rendered redundant’ (quoted in Akst 2014, p. 2). Wassily Leontief was equally pessimistic about the implications of new machines. By drawing an analogy with the technologies of the early twentieth century that made horses redundant, in an interview1 he speculated that “Labor will become less and less important... More and more workers will be replaced by machines. I do not see that new industries can employ everybody who wants a job.\"  \n\nThis paper is a first step in developing a conceptual framework to study how machines replace human labor and why this might (or might not) lead to lower employment and stagnant wages. Our main conceptual innovation is to propose a framework in which tasks previously performed by labor are automated, while at the same time other new technologies complement labor: specifically, in our model this takes the form of the introduction of new tasks in which labor has a comparative advantage. Herein lies our answer to Leontief's analogy: the difference between human labor and horses is that humans have a comparative advantage in new and more complex tasks. Horses did not. If this comparative advantage is significant and the creation of new tasks continues, employment and the labor share can remain stable in the long run even in the face of rapid automation.  \n\nThe importance of new tasks is well illustrated by the technological and organizational changes during the Second Industrial Revolution, which not only involved the replacement of the stagecoach by the railroad, sailboats by steamboats, and of manual dock workers by cranes, but also the creation of new labor-intensive tasks. These tasks generated jobs for engineers, machinists, repairmen, conductors, back-office workers, and managers involved with the introduction and operation of new technologies (e.g., Landes 1969; Chandler 1977; and Mokyr 1990).  \n\nToday, as industrial robots, digital technologies, computer-controlled machines, and artificial intelligence replace labor, we are again witnessing the emergence of new tasks ranging from engineering and programming functions to those performed by audio-visual specialists, executive assistants, data administrators and analysts, meeting planners, and social workers. Indeed, during the last 35 years, new tasks and new job titles have accounted for a large fraction of US employment growth. To document this fact, we use data from Lin (2011) to measure the share of new job titles, jobs in which workers perform tasks that are different from tasks in previously existing jobs, within each occupational category. In 2000, about 70 percent of computer software developers (an occupational category employing one million people at the time) held new job titles. Similarly, in 1990 “radiology technician\" and in 1980 \"management analyst’ were new job titles. Figure 1 shows that occupations with 10 percentage points more new job titles (which is approximately the sample average in 1980) experienced 0.41 percent faster employment growth between 1980 and 2015. This estimate implies that about 60 percent of the 50 million or so jobs added during this 35-year period are associated with the additional employment growth in occupations with new job titles (relative to occupations with no new job titles).2  \n\n![](images/daebf098dda2e5965e454c09941f4308566c7bd0cf2cb125c77397168158301e.jpg)  \nFIGURE 1. EMPLOYMENT GROWTH BY OCCUPATION BETWEEN 1980 AND 2015 (ANNUALIZED) AND THE SHARE OFNEW JOBTITLES IN 1980  \n\nWe start with a static model in which capital is fixed and technology is exogenous. There are two types of technological changes: automation allows firms to substitute capital for tasks previously performed by labor, while the creation of new tasks enables the replacement of old tasks by new variants in which labor has a higher productivity. Our static model provides a rich but tractable framework that clarifies how automation and the creation of new tasks shape the production possibilities of the economy and determine factor prices, factor shares in national income, and employment. Automation always reduces the labor share and employment, and may even reduce wages.3 Conversely, the creation of new tasks increases wages, employment, and the labor share. These comparative statics follow because factor prices are determined by the range of tasks performed by capital and labor, and shifts in technology alter the range of tasks performed by each factor (see also Acemoglu and Autor 2011).  \n\nWe then embed this framework in a dynamic economy in which capital accumulation is endogenous, and we characterize restrictions under which the model delivers balanced growth with automation and creation of new tasks, which we take to be a good approximation to economic growth in the United States and the United Kingdom over the last two centuries. The key restrictions are that there is exponential productivity growth from the creation of new tasks and that the two types of technological changes (automation and the creation of new tasks) advance at equal rates. A critical difference from our static model is that capital accumulation responds to permanent shifts in technology in order to keep the interest rate and hence the rental rate of capital constant. As a result, the dynamic effects of technology on factor prices depend on the response of capital accumulation as well. The response of capital ensures that the productivity gains from both automation and the introduction of new tasks fully accrue to labor (the relatively inelastic factor). Although the real wage in the long run increases because of this productivity effect, automation still reduces the labor share and employment.  \n\nOur full model endogenizes the rates of improvement of these two types of technologies by marrying our task-based framework with a directed technological change setup. This full version of the model remains tractable and allows a complete characterization of balanced growth paths. If the long-run rental rate of capital is very low relative to the wage, there will not be sufficient incentives to create new tasks, and the long-run equilibrium involves full automation, akin to Leontief's “horse equilibrium.’ Otherwise, the long-run equilibrium involves balanced growth based on equal advancement of the two types of technologies. Under natural assumptions, this (interior) balanced growth path is stable, so that when automation runs ahead of the creation of new tasks, market forces induce a slowdown in subsequent automation and more rapid countervailing advances in the creation of new tasks. This stability result highlights a crucial new force: a wave of automation pushes down the effective cost of producing with labor, discouraging further efforts to automate additional tasks and encouraging the creation of new tasks.  \n\nThe stability of the balanced growth path implies that periods in which automation runs ahead of the creation of new tasks tend to trigger self-correcting forces, and as a result, the labor share and employment stabilize and could return to their initial levels. Whether this is the case depends on the reason why automation paced ahead in the first place. If this is caused by the random arrival of a series of automa-- tion technologies, the long-run equilibrium takes us back to the same initial levels of employment and labor share. If, on the other hand, automation surges because of a change in the innovation possibilities frontier (making automation easier relative to the creation of new tasks), the economy will tend toward a new balanced growth path with lower levels of employment and labor share. In neither case does rapid automation necessarily bring about the demise of labor.4  \n\nWe also consider three extensions of our model. First, we introduce heterogeneity in skills, and assume that skilled labor has a comparative advantage in new tasks, which we view as a natural assumption.5 Because of this pattern of comparative advantage, automation directly takes jobs away from unskilled labor and increases inequality, while new tasks directly benefit skilled workers and at first increase inequality as well. Over the long run, the standardization of new tasks help low-skill workers. We characterizes the conditions under which standardization is sufficient to restore stable inequality in the long run. This extension formalizes the idea that both automation and the creation of new tasks increase inequality in the short run but standardization limits the increase in inequality in the long run.  \n\nOur second extension modifies our baseline patent structure and reintroduces the creative destruction of the profits of previous innovators, which is absent in our main model, though it is often assumed in the endogenous growth literature. The results in this case are similar, but the conditions for uniqueness and stability of the balanced growth path are more demanding.  \n\nFinally, we study the efficiency properties of the process of automation and creation of new technologies, and point to a new source of inefficiency leading to excessive automation: when the wage rate is above the opportunity cost of labor (due to labor market frictions), firms will choose automation to save on labor costs, while the social planner, taking into account the lower opportunity cost of labor, would have chosen less automation.  \n\nOur paper can be viewed as a combination of task-based models of the labor market with directed technological change models.6 Task-based models have been developed both in the economic growth and labor literatures, dating back at least to Roy's (1951) seminal work. The first important recent contribution, Zeira (1998), proposed a model of economic growth based on capital-labor substitution. Zeira's model is a special case of our framework. Acemoglu and Zilibotti (2001) developed a simple task-based model with endogenous technology and applied it to the study of productivity differences across countries, illustrating the potential mismatch between new technologies and the skills of developing economies (see also Zeira 2006; Acemoglu 2010). Autor, Levy, and Murnane (2003) suggested that the increase in inequality in the US labor market reflects the automation and computerization of routine tasks.7 Our static model is most similar to Acemoglu and Autor (2011). Our full framework extends this model not only because of the dynamic equilibrium incorporating capital accumulation and directed technological change, but also because tasks are combined with a general elasticity of substitution, and because the equilibrium allocation of tasks depends both on factor prices and the state of technology.  \n\nThree papers from the economic growth literature that are related to our work are Acemoglu (2003), Jones (2005), and Hémous and Olsen (2016). The first two papers develop growth models in which the aggregate production function is endogenous and, in the long run, adapts to make balanced growth possible. In Jones (2005), this occurs because of endogenous choices about different combinations of activities/technologies. In Acemoglu (2003), this long-run behavior is a consequence of directed technological change in a model of factor-augmenting technologies. Our task-based framework here is a significant departure from this model, especially since it enables us to address questions related to automation, its impact on factor prices and its endogenous evolution. In addition, our framework provides a more robust economic force ensuring the stability of the balanced growth path: while in models with factor-augmenting technologies stability requires an elasticity of substitution between capital and labor that is less than 1 (so that the more abundant factor commands a lower share of national income), we do not need such a condition in this framework.9 Hemous and Olsen (2016) propose a model of automation and horizontal innovation with endogenous technology, and use it to study the consequences of different types of technologies on inequality. High wages (in their model for low-skill workers) encourage automation. But unlike in our model, the unbalanced dynamics that this generates are not countered by other types of innovations in the long run. Also worth noting is Kotlikoff and Sachs (2012), who develop an overlapping generation model in which automation may have long-lasting effects. In their model, automation reduces the earnings of current workers, and via this channel, depresses savings and capital accumulation.  \n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section I presents our task-based framework in the context of a static economy. Section II introduces capital accumulation and clarifies the conditions for balanced growth in this economy. Section Ill presents our full model with endogenous technology and establishes, under some plausible conditions, the existence, uniqueness, and stability of a balanced growth path with two types of technologies advancing in tandem. Section IV considers the three extensions mentioned above. Section V concludes. Appendix A contains the proofs of our main results, while online Appendix B contains the remaining proofs, additional results, and the details of the empirical analysis presented above.  \n\n## 1. Static Model  \n\nWe start with a static version of our model with exogenous technology, which allows us to introduce our main setup in the simplest fashion and characterize the  \n\nimpact of different types of technological change on factor prices, employment, and the labor share.  \n\nA.Environment  \n\nThe economy produces a unique final good $Y$ by combining a unit measure of tasks, $y(i)$ , with an elasticity of substitution $\\sigma\\in(0,\\infty)$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{Y=\\widetilde{B}\\Big(\\int_{N-1}^{N}y\\big(i\\big)^{\\frac{\\sigma-1}{\\sigma}}d i\\Big)^{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma-1}},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\widetilde B>0$ . All tasks and the final good are produced competitively. The fact that the limits of integration run between $N-1$ and $N$ imposes that the measure of tasks used in production always remains at 1. A new (more complex) task replaces or upgrades the lowest-index task. Thus, an increase in $N$ represents the upgrading of the quality (productivity) of the unit measure of tasks.10  \n\nEach task is produced by combining labor or capital with a task-specific intermediate $q(i)$ , which embodies the technology used either for automation or for production with labor. To simplify the exposition, we start by assuming that these intermediates are supplied competitively, and that they can be produced using $\\psi$ units of the final good. Hence, they are also priced at $\\psi$ . In Section IlI we relax this assumption and allow intermediate producers to make profits so as to generate endogenous incentives for innovation.  \n\nAll tasks can be produced with labor. We model the technological constraints on automation by assuming that there exists $I\\in\\mathsf{\\Gamma}[N-1,N]$ such that tasks $i\\leq I$ are technologically automated in the sense that it is feasible to produce them with capital. Although tasks $i\\leq I$ are technologically automated, whether they will be produced with capital or not depends on relative factor prices as we describe below. Conversely, tasks $i>I$ are not technologically automated, and must be produced with labor.  \n\nThe production function for tasks $i>I$ takes the form  \n\n$$\ny(i)=\\overline{{{B}}}(\\zeta)\\Big[\\eta_{\\zeta}^{\\frac{1}{\\zeta}}q(i)^{\\frac{\\zeta-1}{\\zeta}}+(1-\\eta)^{\\frac{1}{\\zeta}}\\big(\\gamma(i)l(i)\\big)^{\\frac{\\zeta-1}{\\zeta}}\\Big]^{\\frac{\\zeta}{\\zeta-1}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\gamma(i)$ denotes the productivity of labor in task $i$ $\\zeta\\in(0,\\infty)$ is the elasticity of  substitution  between  intermediates  and  labor, $\\eta\\in(0,1)$ is the share parameter of this constant elasticity of substitution (CEs) production function, and $\\overline{{B}}\\left(\\zeta\\right)$ is a constant included to simplify_the algebra. In particular, we set $\\overline{{{B}}}(\\zeta)=\\psi^{\\eta}(1-\\eta)^{\\eta-1}\\eta^{-\\eta}$ when $\\zeta=1$ , and $\\overleftarrow{B}(\\zeta)=1$ otherwise.  \n\nTasks $i\\leq I$ can be produced using labor or capital, and their production function is identical to (2) except for the presence of capital and labor as perfectly substitutable factors of production:11  \n\n$$\ny(i)=\\overline{{{B}}}(\\zeta)\\Big[\\eta_{\\zeta}^{\\frac{1}{\\zeta}}q(i)^{\\frac{\\zeta-1}{\\zeta}}+(1-\\eta){\\textstyle\\frac{1}{\\zeta}}\\big(k(i)+\\gamma(i)l(i)\\big)^{\\frac{\\zeta-1}{\\zeta}}\\Big]^{\\frac{\\zeta}{\\zeta-1}}.\n$$  \n\nThroughout, we impose the following assumption.  \n\nASSUMPTION 1: $\\gamma(i)$ is strictly increasing.  \n\nAssumption 1 implies that labor has strict comparative advantage in tasks with a higher index and will guarantee that, in equilibrium, tasks with lower indices will be automated, while those with higher indices will be produced with labor.  \n\nWe model the demand side of the economy using a representative household with preferences given by  \n\n$$\nu(C,L)=\\frac{\\left(C e^{-\\nu(L)}\\right)^{1-\\theta}-1}{1-\\theta},\n$$  \n\nwhere $C$ is consumption, $L$ denotes the labor supply of the representative household, and $\\nu(L)$ designates the utility cost of labor supply, which we assume to be continuously differentiable, increasing, and convex, and to satisfy $\\nu^{\\prime\\prime}(L)+(\\theta-1)$ $\\times~(\\nu^{\\prime}(L))^{2}/\\theta~>~0$ (which ensures that $u(C,L)$ is concave). The functional form in (4) ensures balanced growth (see King, Plosser, and Rebelo 1988; Boppart and Krusell 2016). When we turn to the dynamic analysis in the next section, $\\theta$ will be the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution.  \n\nFinally, in the static model, the capital stock, $K$ , is taken as given (it will be endogenized via household saving decisions in Section II).  \n\n### B. Equilibrium in the Static Model  \n\nGiven the set of technologies I and $N$ and the capital stock $K$ wenowcharacterize the equilibrium value of output, factor prices, employment, and the threshold task $I^{*}$ In the text, we simplify the exposition by imposing the following assumption.  \n\nASSUMPTION 2: One of the following two conditions holds:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{(i)\\eta\\rightarrow0,o r}}\\ {{}}\\ {{(i i)\\zeta=1.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThese two special cases ensure that the demand for labor and capital is homothetic. More generally, our qualitative results are identical as long as the degree of non-homotheticity is not too extreme, though in this case we no longer have closed-form expressions and this motivates our choice of presenting these more general results in Appendix A.12  \n\nWe proceed by characterizing the unit cost of producing each task as a function of factor prices and the automation possibilities represented by $I.$ Because tasks are produced competitively, their price, $p(i)$ , will be equal to the minimum unit cost of production:  \n\n$$\np(i)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{min}\\Biggl\\{R,\\frac{W}{\\gamma(i)}\\Biggr\\}^{1-\\eta}}&{\\mathrm{if}i\\leq I}\\ {\\displaystyle\\left(\\frac{W}{\\gamma(i)}\\right)^{1-\\eta}}&{\\mathrm{if}i>I}\\end{array}\\right.,\n$$  \n\nwhere $W$ denotes the wage rate and $R$ denotes the rental rate of capital.  \n\nIn equation (5), the unit cost of production for tasks $i>I$ is given by the effective cost of labor, $W/\\gamma(i)$ (which takes into account that the productivity of labor in task $i$ is $\\gamma(i)$ ). The unit cost of production for tasks $i\\leq I$ is given by $\\operatorname*{min}\\biggl\\{R,\\frac{W}{\\gamma(i)}\\biggr\\}$ the production of automated tasks. In these tasks, firms will choose whichever factor has a lower effective cost: $R$ or $W/\\gamma(i)$  \n\nBecause labor has a strict comparative advantage in tasks with a higher index, there is a (unique) threshold I such that  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{W}{R}=\\gamma\\big(\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{I}}\\big).}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThis threshold represents the task for which the costs of producing with capital and labor are equal. For all tasks $i\\leq\\tilde{I},$ we have $R\\leq W/\\gamma(i)$ , and without any other constraints, these tasks will be produced with capital. However, if $\\tilde{I}>I,$ firms cannot produce all tasks until $\\tilde{I}$ with capital because of the constraint imposed by the available automation technology. This implies that there exists a unique equilibrium threshold task  \n\n$$\nI^{*}=\\operatorname*{min}\\{I,\\tilde{I}\\},\n$$  \n\n![](images/a788316ee8031cf6771eeb6df338e9b81acb6640d82b2aa06c9b263071f14742.jpg)  \nFIGURE 2.

In the static model, this will be the case when the capital stock is not too large, which is imposed in the next assumption.  \n\nASSUMPTION3:Wehave $K<{\\overline{{K}}}$ ,where $\\overline{{K}}$ issuchthat $R=\\frac{W}{\\gamma(N)}$  \n\nThis assumption ensures that $R>\\frac{W}{\\gamma(N)}$ ,and consequently, new tasks will increase aggregate output and will be adopted immediately. Outside of this region, new tasks would not be utilized, which we view as the less interesting case. This assumption is relaxed in the next two sections where the capital stock is endogenous.  \n\nWe next derive the demand for factors in terms of the (endogenous) threshold $I^{*}$ and the technology parameter $N.$ We choose the final good as the numéraire. Equation (1) gives the demand for task $i$ as  \n\n$$\ny(i)\\:=\\:\\widetilde{B}^{\\sigma-1}Y p(i)^{-\\sigma}.\n$$  \n\nLetus define $\\widehat{\\sigma}=\\sigma(1-\\eta)+\\zeta\\eta$ and $B=\\widetilde{B}^{\\frac{\\sigma-1}{\\widehat{\\sigma}-1}}$ Under Assumption 2, equations (2) and (3) yield the demand for capital and labor in each task as  \n\nand  \n\n$$\nk(i)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{{B^{{\\widehat{\\sigma}}-1}(1-\\eta)Y R^{-{\\widehat{\\sigma}}}}}&{{\\mathrm{~if~}i\\leq I^{*}}}\\ {0}&{{\\mathrm{~if~}i>I^{*}}}\\end{array}\\right.,\n$$  \n\n$$\nl(i)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{0}&{\\mathrm{~if~}i\\leq I^{*}}\\ {B^{\\widehat{\\sigma}-1}(1-\\eta)Y\\frac{1}{\\gamma(i)}\\Big(\\frac{W}{\\gamma(i)}\\Big)^{-\\widehat{\\sigma}}}&{\\mathrm{~if~}i>I^{*}}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nWe can now define a static equilibrium as follows. Given a range of tasks $[N-1,N]$ , automation technology $I\\in\\mathsf{\\Gamma}(N-1,N]$ , and a capital stock $K.$ a static equilibrium is summarized by a set of factor prices, $W$ and $R$ , threshold tasks, $\\tilde{I}$ and $I^{*}$ , employment level, $L$ , and aggregate output, $Y$ , such that  \n\n· $\\tilde{I}$ is determined by equation (6) and $I^{*}=\\operatorname*{min}\\{I,\\tilde{I}\\}$ ， · The capital and labor markets clear, so that  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{B^{\\widehat{\\sigma}-1}(1-\\eta)Y(I^{*}-N+1)R^{-\\widehat{\\sigma}}=K,}\\ {B^{\\widehat{\\sigma}-1}(1-\\eta)Y\\int_{I^{*}}^{N}\\frac{1}{\\gamma(i)}\\Big(\\frac{W}{\\gamma(i)}\\Big)^{-\\widehat{\\sigma}}d i=L;}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n· Factor prices satisfy the ideal price index condition,  \n\n$$\n(I^{*}-N+1)R^{1-\\hat{\\sigma}}+\\int_{I^{*}}^{N}\\left({\\frac{W}{\\gamma(i)}}\\right)^{1-\\hat{\\sigma}}d i=B^{1-\\hat{\\sigma}};\n$$  \n\n· Labor supply satisfies $\\nu^{\\prime}(L)~=~W/C$ .Since in equilibrium $C=R K+W L$ this condition can be rearranged to yield the following increasing labor supply function:14  \n\n$$\nL=L^{s}\\Big(\\frac{W}{R K}\\Big).\n$$  \n\nPROPOSITION 1 (Equilibrium in the Static Model): Suppose that Assumptions 1, 2, and 3 hold.

STATIC EQUILIBRIUM  \n\nNotes: Panel A depicts the case in which $I^{*}=I<\\tilde{I}$ so that the allocation of factors is constrained by technology. Panel B depicts the case in which $I^{*}=\\tilde{I}<I$ so that the allocation of factors is not constrained by technology and is cost-minimizing. The blue curves show the shifts following an increase in $I$ to $I^{\\prime}$ which reduce $\\omega$ in the panel A, but have no effect in panel B.  \n\n### PROOF:  \n\nSee Appendix A.  \n\nEquation (12) shows that aggregate output is a CES aggregate of capital and labor, with the elasticity between capital and labor being $\\widehat{\\sigma}$ .The share parameters are endogenous and depend on the state of the two types of technologies and the equilibrium choices of firms. An increase in $I^{*}$ , which corresponds to greater equilibrium automation, increases the share of capital and reduces the share of labor in this aggregate production function, while the creation of new tasks does the opposite.  \n\nFigure  3  illustrates  the unique equilibrium  described   in  Proposition  1. The equilibrium is given by the intersection of two curves in the $(\\omega,I)$ space,where $\\omega={\\frac{W}{R K}}$ is the wage level normalized by capital income; this ratio is a monotone transformation of the labor share and will play a central role in the rest of our analysis.15 The upward-sloping curve represents the cost-minimizing allocation of capital and labor to tasks represented by equation (6), with the constraint that the equilibrium level of automation can never exceed $I.$ The downward-sloping curve, $\\omega(I^{*},N,K)$ , corresponds to the relative demand for labor, which can be obtained directly from (8), (9), and (11) as  \n\n$$\n\\ln\\omega+\\frac{1}{\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\ln L^{s}(\\omega)=\\Big(\\frac{1}{\\widehat{\\sigma}}-1\\Big)\\ln K+\\frac{1}{\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\ln\\Bigg(\\frac{\\int_{I^{*}}^{N}\\gamma(i)^{\\widehat{\\sigma}-1}d i}{I^{*}-N+1}\\Bigg).\n$$  \n\nAs we show in Appendix A, the relative demand curve always starts above the cost minimization condition and ends up below it, so that the two curves necessarily intersect, defining a unique equilibrium as shown in Figure 3.  \n\nThe figure also distinguishes between the two cases highlighted above. In panel A,wehave $I^{*}=I<\\tilde{I}$ and the allocation of factors is constrained by technology,  \n\nwhile panel B plots the case where $I^{*}=\\tilde{I}<I$ and firms choose the cost-minimizing allocation given factor prices.  \n\nA special case of Proposition 1 is also worth highlighting, because it leads to a Cobb-Douglas production function with an exponent depending on the degree of automation, which is particularly tractable in certain applications.  \n\nCOROLLARY 1: Suppose that $\\sigma=\\zeta=1$ and $\\gamma(i)~=~1$ for all i. Then aggregate output is  \n\n$$\nY=\\frac{B}{1-\\eta}K^{1-N+I^{*}}L^{N-I^{*}}.\n$$  \n\nThe next two propositions give a complete characterization of comparative statics.16  \n\nPROPOSITION 2 (Comparative Statics): Suppose that Assumptions 1, 2, and 3 hold.Let $\\varepsilon_{L}>0$ denote the elasticity of the labor supply schedule $L^{s}(\\omega)$ ;let $\\varepsilon_{\\gamma}={\\frac{d\\ln\\gamma(I)}{d I}}>0$ denote  the  semi-elasticity  of  the  comparative  advantage schedule;andlet  \n\n$$\n\\Lambda_{I}=\\frac{\\gamma(I^{*})^{\\widehat\\sigma-1}}{\\int_{I^{*}}^{N}\\gamma(i)^{\\widehat\\sigma-1}d i}+\\frac{1}{I^{*}-N+1}\\quad a n d\\quad\\Lambda_{N}=\\frac{\\gamma(N)^{\\widehat\\sigma-1}}{\\int_{I^{*}}^{N}\\gamma(i)^{\\widehat\\sigma-1}d i}+\\frac{1}{I^{*}-N+1}.\n$$  \n\n·If $I^{*}=I<\\tilde{I} $ .so that the allocation of tasks to factors is constrained by technology, then:  \n\n$(i)$ the impact of technological change on relative factor prices is given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}&{}&{\\frac{d\\ln(W/R)}{d I}=\\frac{d\\ln\\omega}{d I}=-\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\sigma}+\\varepsilon_{L}}\\Lambda_{I}<0,}\\ &{}&{\\frac{d\\ln(W/R)}{d N}=\\frac{d\\ln\\omega}{d N}=\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\sigma}+\\varepsilon_{L}}\\Lambda_{N}>0;}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$(i i)$ and the impact of capital on relative factor prices is given by  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{d\\ln(W/R)}{d\\ln K}}={\\frac{d\\ln\\omega}{d\\ln K}}+1={\\frac{1+\\varepsilon_{L}}{{\\hat{\\sigma}}+\\varepsilon_{L}}}>0.\n$$  \n\n$\\begin{array}{r}{I f I^{*}=\\tilde{I}<I.}\\end{array}$ so that the allocation of tasks to factors is cost-minimizing, then:  \n\n$(i)$ the impact of technological change on relative factor prices is given by  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\ln(W/R)}{d I}=\\frac{d\\ln\\omega}{d I}=0,\\frac{d\\ln(W/R)}{d N}=\\frac{d\\ln\\omega}{d N}=\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{f r e e}+\\varepsilon_{L}}\\Lambda_{N}>0,\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\sigma_{f r e e}=\\widehat{\\sigma}+\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{\\gamma}}\\Lambda_{I}>\\widehat{\\sigma};\n$$  \n\n16I this proposition, we do not explitly ra the case in which $I^{*}=I=\\tilde{I}$ in order to save on space and notation, since in this case left and right derivatives with respect to $I$ are different.  \n\n$(i i)$ and the impact of capital on relative factor prices is given by  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\ln(W/R)}{d\\ln K}=\\frac{d\\ln\\omega}{d\\ln K}+1=\\frac{1+\\varepsilon_{L}}{\\sigma_{f r e e}+\\varepsilon_{L}}>0.\n$$  \n\n·In all cases, the labor share and employment move in the same direction as  \n\n$$\n\\omega:\\frac{d L}{d N}>0a n d,w h e n\\:I^{*}=I,\\frac{d L}{d I}<0.\n$$  \n\nPROOF:  \n\nSee online Appendix B.  \n\nThe main implication of Proposition 2 is that the two types of technological change (automation and the creation of new tasks) have polar implications. An increase in $N$ (the creation of new tasks） raises $W/R$ , the labor share, and employment. An increase in $I$ (an improvement in automation technology) reduces $W/R$ , the labor share, and employment (unless $I^{*}=\\tilde{I}<I$ and firms are not constrained by technology in their automation choice).17  \n\nThe reason why automation reduces employment (when $I^{*}=I<\\tilde{I}$ )is that it raises aggregate output per worker more than it raises wages (as we will see next, automation may even reduce wages). Thus, the negative income effect on the labor supply resulting from greater aggregate output dominates any substitution effect that might follow from the higher wages. On the other hand, the creation of new tasks always increases employment: new tasks raise wages more than aggregate output, increasing the labor supply. Although these exact results rely on the balanced growth preferences in equation (4), similar forces operate in general and create a tendency for automation to reduce employment and for new tasks to increase it.  \n\nFigure 3 illustrates the comparative statics: automation moves us along the relative labor demand curve in the technology-constrained case shown in panel A (and has no impact in panel B), while the creation of new tasks shifts out the relative labor demand curve in both cases.  \n\nA final implication of Proposition 2 is that the “technology-constrained”’ elasticity of substitution between capital and labor, $\\widehat{\\sigma}$ , which applies when $I^{*}=I<\\tilde{I},$ differs from the “\"technology-free” elasticity, $\\sigma_{f r e e}$ , which applies when the decision of which tasks to automate is not constrained by technology (i.e., when $I^{*}=\\tilde{I}<I)$ This is because in the former case, as relative factor prices change, the set of tasks performed by each factor remains fixed. In the latter case, as relative factor prices change, firms reassign tasks to factors. This additional margin of adjustment implies that $\\sigma_{f r e e}>\\widehat{\\sigma}$  \n\nPROPOSITION 3 (Impact of Technology on Productivity, Wages, and Factor Prices): Suppose that Assumptions 1, 2, and 3 hold, and denote the changes in productivity, the change in aggregate output holding capital and labor constant, by $d$ In Yk,L·  \n\n·If $I^{*}=I<\\tilde{I} $ .so that the allocation of tasks to factors is constrained by technology,then $\\frac{W}{\\gamma(I^{*})}>R>\\frac{W}{\\gamma(N)};$ and  \n\n$$\nd\\ln Y\\vert_{K,L}=\\frac{B^{\\hat{\\sigma}-1}}{1-\\hat{\\sigma}}\\biggl(\\left(\\frac{W}{\\gamma(I^{*})}\\right)^{1-\\hat{\\sigma}}-R^{1-\\hat{\\sigma}}\\biggr)d I+\\frac{B^{\\hat{\\sigma}-1}}{1-\\hat{\\sigma}}\\biggl(R^{1-\\hat{\\sigma}}-\\left(\\frac{W}{\\gamma(N)}\\right)^{1-\\hat{\\sigma}}\\biggr)d N.\n$$  \n\nThat is, both technologies increase productivity.   \nMoreover,let $s_{L}$ denote the share of labor in net output. The impact of technology on factor prices in this case is given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{d\\ln W=d\\ln Y\\vert_{K,L}+(1-s_{L})\\Bigl(\\frac1{\\widehat{\\sigma}+\\varepsilon_{L}}\\Lambda_{N}d N-\\frac1{\\widehat{\\sigma}+\\varepsilon_{L}}\\Lambda_{I}d I\\Bigr),}}\\ {{d\\ln R=d\\ln Y\\vert_{K,L}-s_{L}\\Bigl(\\frac1{\\widehat{\\sigma}+\\varepsilon_{L}}\\Lambda_{N}d N-\\frac1{\\widehat{\\sigma}+\\varepsilon_{L}}\\Lambda_{I}d I\\Bigr).}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThat is, a higher N always increases the equilibrium wage but may reduce the rental rate of capital,while a higherI always increases the rentalrate of capital but may reduce the equilibrium wage. In particular, there exists $\\widetilde{K}<\\infty$ such that an increasein $I$ increases the equilibrium wage when $K>{\\widetilde{K}}$ andreduces itwhen $K<{\\widetilde{K}}$  \n\n·If $I^{*}=\\tilde{I}<I$ so that the allocation of tasks to factors is not constrained by technology,then $\\frac{W}{\\gamma(I^{*})}=R>\\frac{W}{\\gamma(N)};$ and  \n\n$$\nd\\ln{\\cal Y}\\vert_{K,L}=\\frac{B^{\\widehat{\\sigma}-1}}{1-\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\biggl(R^{1-\\widehat{\\sigma}}-\\biggl(\\frac{W}{\\gamma(N)}\\biggr)^{1-\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\biggr)d N.\n$$  \n\nThat is, new tasks increase productivity, but additional automation technologies donot.  \n\nMoreover, the impact of technology on factor prices in this case is given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{d\\ln W=d\\ln Y|_{K,L}+(1-s_{L})\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{f r e e}+\\varepsilon_{L}}\\Lambda_{N}d N,}}\\ {{d\\ln R=d\\ln Y|_{K,L}-s_{L}\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{f r e e}+\\varepsilon_{L}}\\Lambda_{N}d N.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThat is, an increase in $N(m o r e n e w t a s k s)$ always increases the equilibrium wage but may reduce the rental rate, while an increase in $I$ (greater technological automation) has no effect on factor prices.  \n\nPROOF:  \n\nSee online Appendix B.  \n\nThe most important result in Proposition 3 is that, when $I^{*}=I<\\tilde{I}.$ automation— an increase in I—always increases aggregate output, but has an ambiguous effect on the equilibrium wage. On the one hand, there is a positive productivity effect captured by the term $d\\ln Y|_{K,L}$ : by substituting cheaper capital for expensive labor, automation raises productivity, and hence the demand for labor in the tasks that are not yet automated.18 Countering this, there is a negative displacement effect captured by the term $\\frac{1}{\\widehat{\\sigma}+\\varepsilon_{L}}\\Lambda_{I}.$ This negative effet occurs becase automation contratsthe set of tasks performed by labor. Because tasks are subject to diminishing returns in the aggregate production function, (1), bunching workers into fewer tasks puts downward pressure on the wage.  \n\nAs the equation for $d\\ln Y|_{K,L}$ reveals, the productivity gains depend on the cost savings from automation, which are given by the difference between the effective wage at $I^{*}$ ， $W/\\gamma(I^{*})$ , and the rental rate, $R$ . The displacement effect dominates the productivity effect when the gap between $W/\\gamma(I^{*})$ and $R$ is small: which is guaranteed when $K<{\\widetilde{K}}$ . In this case, the overall impact of automation on wages is negative.  \n\nFinally, Proposition 3 shows that an increase in $N$ always raises productivity and the equilibrium wage (recall that Assumption 3 imposed that $R>W/\\gamma(N))$ When the productivity gains from the creation of new tasks are small, it can reduce the rental rate of capital as well.  \n\nThe fact that automation may reduce the equilibrium wage while increasing productivity is a key feature of the task-based framework developed here (see also Acemoglu and Autor 2011). In our model, automation shifts the range of tasks performed by capital and labor: it makes the production process more capital intensive and less labor intensive, and it always reduces the labor share and the wage-rental rate ratio, $W/R$ . This reiterates that automation is very different from factor-augmenting technological changes and has dissimilar implications. The effects of labor- or capital-augmenting technology on the labor share and the wage-rental rate ratio depend on the elasticity of substitution (between capital and labor). Also, capital-augmenting technological improvements always increase the equilibrium wage, and labor-augmenting ones also do so provided that the elasticity of substitution is greater than the share of capital in national income.19  \n\n## II. Dynamics and Balanced Growth  \n\nIn this section, we extend our model to a dynamic economy in which the evolution of the capital stock is determined by the saving decisions of a representative household. We then investigate the conditions under which the economy admits a balanced growth path (BGP), where aggregate output, the capital stock, and wages grow at a constant rate. We conclude by discussing the long-run effects of automation on wages, the labor share, and employment.  \n\n### A. Balanced Growth  \n\nWe assume that the representative household's dynamic preferences are given by  \n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty}e^{-\\rho t}u(C(t),L(t))d t,\n$$  \n\nwhere $u(C(t),L(t))$ is as defined in equation (4) and $\\rho>0$ is the discount rate.  \n\nTo ensure balanced growth, we impose more structure to the comparative advantage schedule. Because balanced growth is driven by technology, and in this model sustained technological change comes from the creation of new tasks, constant growth requires productivity gains from new tasks to be exponential.20 Thus, in what follows we strengthen Assumption 1.  \n\nASSUMPTION 1': $\\gamma(i)$ satisfies  \n\n$$\n\\gamma(i)=e^{A i}w i t h A>0.\n$$  \n\nThe path of technology, represented by $\\{I(t),N(t)\\},$ is exogenous, and we define  \n\n$$\nn(t)~=~N(t)-I(t)\n$$  \n\nas a summary measure of technology, and similarly let $n^{*}(t)\\:=\\:N(t)-I^{*}(t)$ be a summary measure of the state of technology used in equilibrium (since $I^{*}(t)\\leq I(t)$ ， wehave $n^{*}(t)\\geq n(t))$ . New automation technologies reduce $n(t)$ , while the introduction of new tasks increases it.  \n\nFrom equation (12), aggregate output net of intermediates, or simply “net output,\" can be written as a function of technology represented by $n^{*}(t)$ and $\\gamma(\\bar{I^{*}}(t))=e^{\\hat{A}I^{*}(t)}$ the capital stock, $K(t)$ , and the level of employment, $L(t)$ ,as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{F\\bigl(K(t),e^{A I^{*}(t)}L(t);n^{*}(t)\\bigr)}\\ &{\\qquad=B\\left[(1-n^{*}(t))^{\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\sigma}}}K(t)^{\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}-1}{\\hat{\\sigma}}}+\\Bigl(\\int_{0}^{n^{*}(t)}\\gamma(i)^{\\hat{\\sigma}-1}d i\\Bigr)^{\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\sigma}}}(e^{A I^{*}(t)}L(t))^{\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}-1}{\\hat{\\sigma}}}\\right]^{\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}}{\\hat{\\sigma}-1}}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe resource constraint of the economy then takes the form  \n\n$$\n\\dot{K}(t)=F\\big(K(t),e^{A I(t)}L(t);n^{*}(t)\\big)-C(t)-\\delta K(t),\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\delta$ is the depreciation rate of capital  \n\nWe characterize the equilibrium in terms of the employment level $L(t)$ , and the normalized variables $k(t)~=~K(t)e^{-A I^{*}(t)}$ and $c(t)=C(t)e^{\\frac{1-\\theta}{\\theta}\\nu(L(t))-A I^{*}(t)}$ As in our static model, $R(t)$ denotes the rental rate, and $w(t)~=~W(t)e^{-A I^{*}(t)}$ is the normalized wage.

BEHAVIOR OF FACTOR PRICES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE PARAMETER SPACE  \n\nTo characterize the growth dynamics implied by these equations, let us first consider a path for technology such that $g(t)\\rightarrow g$ and $n(t)\\to n$ , consumption grows at the rate $g$ and the Euler equation holds: $R(t)=\\rho+\\delta+\\theta g.$ Suppose first that $n^{*}(t)\\:=\\:n(t)\\:=\\:0$ , in which case $F$ becomes linear and $R(t)\\mathrm{~=~}B$ .Because the growth rate of consumption must converge to $g$ as well, the Euler equation (17) is satisfied in this case only if $\\rho$ is equal to  \n\n$$\n{\\overline{{\\rho}}}=B-\\delta-\\theta g.\n$$  \n\nLemma A2 in Appendix A shows that this critical value of the discount rate divides the parameter space into two regions as shown in Figure 4. To the left of $\\overline{{\\rho}}$ , there exists a decreasing curve $\\widetilde{n}(\\rho)$ defined over $[\\rho_{\\mathrm{min}},\\overline{{\\rho}}]$ with $\\widetilde{n}(\\overline{{\\rho}})\\:=\\:0$ , and to the right of $\\overline{{\\rho}}$ , there exists an increasing curve $\\overline{{n}}(\\rho)$ defined over $[\\overline{{\\rho}},\\rho_{\\mathrm{max}}]$ with $\\overline{{{n}}}(\\overline{{{\\rho}}})\\mathrm{~=~}0$ such that:21  \n\n·F $\\mathrm{or}n<\\widetilde{n}(\\rho)$ , we have $\\frac{w(t)}{\\gamma(N(t))}>R(t)$ and new tasks would reduce aggregate output, so are not adopted (recall that $w(t)~=~W(t)\\thinspace e^{-A I^{*}(t)})$ ，， · For n > n(p), we have - $\\frac{w(t)}{\\gamma(N(t))}<R(t)$ and in this case, new tasks raise aggregate output and are immediately produced with labor; ·For $n>{\\overline{{n}}}(\\rho)$ , we have $w(t)>R(t)$ , as a result, automated tasks raise aggregate output and are immediately produced with capital; and  \n\n·For $n<\\overline{{n}}(\\rho)$ ,wehave $w(t)<R(t)$ and additional automation would reduce aggregate output, so small changes in automation technology do not affect $n^{*}$ and other equilibrium objects.  \n\nThe next proposition provides the conditions under which a BGP exists, and characterizes the BGP allocations in each case. In what follows, we no longer impose Assumption 3, since depending on the value of $\\rho$ , the capital stock can become large and violate this assumption.  \n\nPROPOSITION 4 (Dynamic Equilibrium with Exogenous Technological Change): SupposethatAssumptions $1^{\\prime}$ and 2 hold.The economy admits a BGP with positive growth if only if we are in one of the following cases:  \n\n$(i)$ Full _ Automation: $\\rho\\mathrm{~<~}\\overline{{\\rho}}$ and $N(t)~=~I(t)$ (and $B>\\delta+\\rho>$ 1(B - 8 - p) + 8 to ensure the transversality condition). In this case, there is $a$ unique and globally stable BGP. In this BGP, $n^{*}(t)=0$ (all tasks areproducedwithcapital),and thelabor shareiszero.   \n$(i i)$ Interior BGP with Immediate Automation: $\\rho\\in(\\rho_{\\operatorname*{min}},\\rho_{\\operatorname*{max}})$ ， $\\dot{N}(t)=\\dot{I}(t)$ $=\\Delta$ ，and $n(t)=n>\\operatorname*{max}\\{\\overline{{n}}(\\rho),\\widetilde{n}(\\rho)\\}$ (and $\\rho+(\\theta-1)A\\Delta>0$ to ensure the transversality condition). In this case, there is a unique and globally stable BGP. In this BGP, $n^{*}(t)~=~n$ and $I^{*}(t)=I(t)$   \n$(i i i)$ Interior BGP with Eventual Automation: $\\rho>\\overline{{\\rho}}$ $\\dot{N}(t)=\\Delta$ with $\\dot{I}(t)\\geq\\Delta$ , and $n(t)<\\overline{{n}}(\\rho)$ (and $\\rho+(\\theta-1)A\\Delta>0$ to ensure the transversality condition). In this case, there is a unique and globally stable BGP. In this BGP, $n^{*}(t)=\\overline{{n}}(\\rho)$ and $I^{*}(t)=\\tilde{I}(t)\\widehat{{\\mathrm{\\scriptsize~>~}}}I(t)$   \n$(i\\nu)$ No Automation: $\\rho>\\rho_{\\mathrm{max}}$ ,and $\\dot{N}(t)~=~\\Delta$ (and $\\rho+(\\theta-1)A\\Delta>0$ to ensure the transversality condition). In this case, there exists a unique and globally stable BGP. In this BGP, $n^{*}(t)=1$ (all tasks are produced with labor), and the capital share is zero.  \n\nPROOF: See Appendix A.  \n\nThe first type of BGP in Proposition 4 involves the automation of all tasks, in which case aggregate output becomes linear in capital. This case was ruled out by Assumption 3 in our static analysis, but as the proposition shows, when the discount rate, $\\rho$ , is sufficiently small, it can emerge in the dynamic model. A BGP with no automation (case (iv)), where growth is driven entirely by the creation of new tasks, is also possible if the discount rate is sufficiently large.  \n\nMore important for our focus are the two interior BGPs where automation and the introduction of new tasks go hand-in-hand, and as a result, $n^{*}(t)$ isconstant at some value between 0 and 1; this implies that both capital and labor perform a fixed measure of tasks. In the more interesting case where automated tasks are immediately produced with capital (case (i)), the proposition also highlights that this process needs to be “balanced\" itself: the two types of technologies need to advance at exactly the same rate so that $n(t)~=~n$  \n\nBalanced growth with constant labor share emerges in this model because the net effect of automation and the creation of new technologies proceeding at the same rate is to augment labor while keeping constant the share of tasks performed by labor, as shown by equation (16). In this case, the gap between the two types of technologies, $n(t)$ , regulates the share parameters in the resulting CES production function, while the levels of $N(t)$ and $I(t)$ determine the productivity of labor in the set of tasks that it performs. When $n(t)=n$ , technology becomes purely labor-augmenting on net because labor performs a fixed share of tasks and labor becomes more productive over time in producing the newly-created tasks.22  \n\nTo illustrate the main implication of the proposition, let us focus on part (ii) with $\\dot{I}=\\dot{N}=\\Delta$ and $n(t)=n\\geq\\overline{{n}}(\\rho).$ Along such a path, $n^{*}(t)~=~n$ and $g(t)=A\\Delta$ Figure 5 presents the phase diagram for the system of differential equations comprising the Euler equation (equation (1i7)）and the resource constraint (equation (2o)). This system of differential equations determines the structure of the dynamic equilibrium and is identical to that of the neoclassical growth model with labor-augmenting technological change and endogenous labor supply (which makes the locus for $\\dot{c}=0$ downward-sloping because of the negative income effect on the labor supply).  \n\n### B. Long-Run Comparative Statics  \n\nWe next study the log-run implications of an unanticipated and permanent decline in $n(t)$ , which corresponds to automation running ahead of the creation of new tasks. Because in the short run capital is fixed, the short-run implications of this change in technology are the same as in our static analysis in the previous section. But the fact that capital adjusts implies different long-run dynamics.  \n\nConsider an interior BGP in which $N(t)-I(t)=n\\in(0,1)$ . Along this path, the equilibrium wage grows at the rate $A\\Delta$ . Define $\\begin{array}{r}{w_{I}(n)=\\operatorname*{lim}_{t\\rightarrow\\infty}W(t)/\\gamma(I^{*}(t))}\\end{array}$ as the effective wage paid in the least complex task produced with labor and $\\begin{array}{r}{{w_{N}}(n)=\\operatorname*{lim}_{t\\to\\infty}W(t)/\\gamma(N(t))}\\end{array}$ as the effective wage paid in the most complex task produced with labor. Both of these functions are well defined and depend only on $n$ Figure 4 shows how these effective wages compare to the BGP value of the rental rate of capital, $\\rho+\\delta+\\theta g$  \n\nThe next proposition characterizes the long-run impact of automation on factor prices, employment and the labor share in the interior BGPs.  \n\nPROPOSITION 5 (Long-Run Comparative Statics): Suppose that Assumptions $1^{\\prime}$ and 2 hold. Consider a path for technology in which $n(t)=n\\in(0,1),n>\\widetilde{n}(\\rho)$ ， and $g(t)~=~g$ (so that we are in case (ii) or (ii) in Proposition 4). In the unique BGP we have that $R(t)=\\rho+\\delta+\\theta g$ and  \n\n![](images/886ef2bbaedff801a56466caa14f1c55d58212efe9d05cfc93e5c15db1b590ea.jpg)  \nFIGURE 5. DYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM WHEN TECHNOLOGY IS EXOGENOUS AND SATISFIES $n(t)=n$ $\\mathbf{\\nabla}.\\mathbf{ND}g(t)=A\\Delta$  \n\n·For $n<\\overline{{n}}(\\rho)$ ,wehave that $n^{*}(t)=\\overline{{n}}(\\rho)$ ， $w_{I}(n)~=~w_{I}(\\overline{{n}}(\\rho))$ ,and $w_{N}(n)$ $=\\d{w}_{N}(\\overline{{n}}(\\rho))$ . In this region, small changes in n do not affect the paths of effective wages, employment, and the labor share;   \n· For $n>{\\overline{{n}}}(\\rho)$ ,wehavethat $n^{*}(t)~=~n$ , and $w_{I}(n)$ is increasingand $w_{N}(n)$ is decreasing in n. Moreover, the asymptotic values for employment and the labor share are increasing in n. Finally, if the increase in n is caused by an increase in I, the capital stock also increases.  \n\n# PROOF:  \n\nSee online Appendix B.  \n\nWe discuss this proposition for $n>{\\overline{{n}}}(\\rho)$ , so that we are in the most interesting region of the parameter space where $I^{*}=I$ and the level of automation is constrained by technology. The long-run implications of automation now differ from its short-term impact. In the long run, automation reduces employment and the labor share, but it always increases the wage. This is because in the long run capital per worker increases to keep the rental rate constant at $\\rho+\\delta+\\theta g$ . This implies that productivity gains accrue to the scarce factor, labor.23  \n\nFigure 6 illustrates the response of the economy to permanent changes in automation. It plots two potential paths for all endogenous variables. The dotted line depicts the case where $w_{I}(n)$ is large relative to $R$ , so that there are significant productivity gains from automation. In this case, an increase in automation raises the wage immediately, followed by further increases in the long run. The solid line depicts the dynamics when $w_{I}(n)\\approx R$ , so that the productivity gains from automation are very small. In this case, an increase in automation reduces the wage in the short run and leaves it approximately unchanged in the long run. In contrast to the concerns that highly productive automation technologies will reduce the wage and employment, our model shows that it is precisely when automation fails to raise productivity significantly that it has a more detrimental impact on wages and employment. In both cases, the duration of the period with stagnant or depressed wagesdepends on $\\theta$ , which determines the speed of capital adjustment following an increase in the rental rate.  \n\n![](images/0eee61ffa8dbc5e821a7511b1e05a6dd26251f721bcc521ebaca9593d08affcf.jpg)  \nFIGURE 6. DYNAMIC BEHAVIOR OF WAGES $(\\ln W)$ , THE RENTAL RATE OF CAPITAL $(R)$ THELABORSHARE $\\left(s_{L}\\right)$ ,AND THE CAPITAL STOCK FOLLOWING A PERMANENTINCREASEINAUTOMATION  \n\nThe remaining panels of Figure 6 show that automation reduces employment and the labor share, as stated in Proposition 5. If $\\widehat{\\sigma}<1$ , the resulting capital accumulation mitigates the short-run decline in the labor share but does not fully offset it (this is the case depicted in the figure). If $\\widehat{\\sigma}>1$ , capital accumulation further depresses the labor share, even though it raises the wage.  \n\nThe long-run impact of a permanent increase in $N(t)$ can also be obtained from the proposition. In this case, new tasks increase the wage (because $w_{I}(n)$ is increasing in $n$ ), aggregate output, employment, and the labor share, both in the short and the long run. Because the short-run impact of new tasks on the rental rate of capital is ambiguous, so is the response of capital accumulation.  \n\nIn light of these results, the recent decline in the labor share and the employment to population ratio in the United States can be interpreted as a consequence of automation outpacing the creation of new labor-intensive tasks. Faster automation relative to the creation of new tasks might be driven by an acceleration in the rate atwhich $I(t)$ advances, in which case we would have stagnant or lower wages in the short run while capital adjusts to a new higher level. Alternatively, it might be driven by a deceleration in the rate at which $N(t)$ advances, in which case we would also have low growth of aggregate output and wages. We return to the productivity implications of automation once we introduce our full model with endogenous technological change in the next section.  \n\n## III. Full Model: Tasks and Endogenous Technologies  \n\nThe previous section established, under some conditions, the existence of an interior BGP with $\\dot{N}=\\dot{I}=\\Delta$ . This result raises a fundamental question: why should these two types of technologies advance at the same rate? To answer this question we now develop our full model, which endogenizes the pace at which automation and the creation of new tasks proceeds.  \n\n### A. Endogenous and Directed Technological Change  \n\nTo endogenize technological change, we deviate from our earlier assumption of a perfectly competitive market for intermediates, and assume that (intellectual) property rights to each intermediate, $q(i)$ , are held by a technology monopolist who can produce it at the marginal cost $\\mu\\psi$ in terms of the final good, where $\\mu\\in(0,1)$ and $\\psi>0$ . We also assume that this technology can be copied by a fringe of competitive firms, which can replicate any available intermediate at a higher marginal cost of $\\psi$ , and that $\\mu$ is such that the unconstrained monopoly price of an intermediate is greater than $\\psi$ . This ensures that the unique equilibrium price for all types of intermediates is a limit price of $\\psi$ , and yields a per unit profit of $(1-\\mu)\\psi>0$ for technology monopolists. These profits generate incentives for creating new tasks and automation technologies.  \n\nIn this section, we adopt a structure of intellectual property rights that abstracts from the creative destruction of profits.24 We assume that developing a new intermediate that automates or replaces an existing task is viewed as an infringement of the patent of the technology previously used to produce that task. For that reason, a firm must compensate the technology monopolist who owns the property rights over the production of the intermediate that it is replacing. We also assume that this compensation takes place with the new inventor making a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the holder of the existing patent.  \n\nDeveloping new intermediates that embody technology requires scientists.25 There is a fixed supply of $S$ scientists, which will be allocated to automation $(S_{I}(t)\\geq0)$ or the creation of new tasks $(S_{N}(t)\\geq0)$ ,So that  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{S_{I}(t)+S_{N}(t)\\leq S.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nWhen a scientist is employed in automation, she automates $\\kappa_{I}$ tasks per unit of time and receives a wage $W_{I}^{S}(t)$ . When she is employed in the creation of new tasks, she creates $\\kappa_{N}$ new tasks per unit of time and receives a wage $W_{N}^{S}(t)$ . We assume that automation and the creation of new tasks proceed in the order of the task index $i$ Thus, the allocation of scientists determines the evolution of both types of technology, summarized by $I(t)$ and $N(t)$ , as  \n\n$$\n\\dot{I}(t)=\\kappa_{I}S_{I}(t),\\mathrm{and}\\dot{N}(t)=\\kappa_{N}S_{N}(t).\n$$  \n\nBecause we want to analyze the properties of the equilibrium locally, we make a final assumption to ensure that the allocation of scientists varies smoothly when there is a small difference between $W_{I}^{S}(t)$ and $W_{N}^{S}(t)$ (rather than having discontinuous jumps). In particular, we assume that scientists differ in the cost of effort: when working in automation, scientist $j$ incurs a cost of $\\chi_{I}^{j}Y(t)$ , and when working in the creation of new tasks, she incurs a cost of $\\chi_{N}^{j}Y(t)$ 26 Consequently, scientist j will work in automation if $\\frac{W_{I}^{S}(t)-W_{N}^{S}(t)}{Y(t)}>\\chi_{I}^{j}-\\chi_{N}^{j}$ We also assume that the distribution of $\\chi_{I}^{j}-\\chi_{N}^{j}$ among scientists is given by a smooth and increasing distribution function $G$ over a support $[-v,v]$ , where we take $\\upsilon$ to be small enough that $\\chi_{I}^{j}$ and $\\chi_{N}^{j}$ are always less than max $\\left\\{\\frac{\\kappa_{N}V_{N}(t)}{Y(t)},\\frac{\\kappa_{I}V_{I}(t)}{Y(t)}\\right\\}$ and thus all scientists always work. For notational convenience, we also adopt the normalization G(o) = $G(0)=\\frac{\\kappa_{N}}{\\kappa_{I}+\\kappa_{N}}.$  \n\n### B. Equilibrium with Endogenous Technological Change  \n\nWe first compute the present discounted value accruing to monopolists from automation and the creation of new tasks. Let $V_{I}(t)$ denote the value of automating task $i=I(t)$ (i.e., the task with the highest index that has not yet been automated, or more formally $i=I(t)+\\varepsilon$ for $\\varepsilon$ arbitrarily small and positive). Likewise, $V_{N}(t)$ is the value of creating a new task at $i~=~N(t)$  \n\nTo simplify the exposition, let us assume that in this equilibrium $n(t)>\\operatorname*{max}\\{\\overline{{n}}(\\rho),\\widetilde{n}(\\rho)\\}.$ so that $I^{*}(t)=I(t)$ and newly-automated tasks start being produced with capital immediately. The fow profits that accrue to the technology monopolist that automated task $i$ are  \n\n$$\n\\pi_{I}(t,i)=b Y(t)R(t)^{\\zeta-\\widehat\\sigma},\n$$  \n\nwhere $b=(1-\\mu)B^{\\widehat{\\sigma}-1}\\eta\\psi^{1-\\zeta}$ 27 Likewise, the flow profits that accrue to the technology monopolist that created the labor-intensive task $i$ are  \n\n$$\n\\pi_{N}(t,i)=b Y(t)\\left(\\frac{W(t)}{\\gamma(i)}\\right)^{\\zeta-\\widehat\\sigma}.\n$$  \n\nThe take-it-or-leave-it nature of offers implies that a firm that automates task $I$ needs to compensate the existing technology monopolist by paying her the present discounted value of the profits that her inferior labor-intensive technology would generate if not replaced. This take-it-or-leave-it offer is given by28  \n\n$$\nb\\int_{t}^{\\infty}e^{-\\int_{0}^{\\tau}(R(s)-\\delta)d s}Y(\\tau)\\left(\\frac{W(\\tau)}{\\gamma(I)}\\right)^{\\zeta-\\widehat\\sigma}d\\tau.\n$$  \n\nLikewise, a firm that creates task $N$ needs to compensate the existing technology monopolist by paying her the present discounted value of the profits from the capital-intensive alternative technology. This take-it-or-leave-it offer is given by  \n\n$$\nb\\int_{t}^{\\infty}e^{-\\int_{0}^{\\tau}(R(s)-\\delta)d s}Y(\\tau)R\\left(\\tau\\right)^{\\zeta-\\widehat\\sigma}d\\tau.\n$$  \n\nIn both cases, the patent-holders will immediately accept theses offers and reject less generous ones.  \n\nWe can then compute the values of a new automation technology and a new task, respectively,as  \n\n$$\nV_{I}(t)~=~b Y(t)\\int_{t}^{\\infty}e^{-\\int_{t}^{\\tau}(R(s)-\\delta-g_{y}(s))d s}\\Big(R\\left(\\tau\\right)^{\\zeta-\\widehat{\\sigma}}-\\left(w(\\tau)e^{\\int_{t}^{\\tau}g(s)d s}\\right)^{\\zeta-\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\Big)d\\tau,\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\nV_{N}(t)~=~b Y(t)\\int_{t}^{\\infty}e^{-\\int_{t}^{\\tau}(R(s)-\\delta-g_{y}(s))d s\\left(\\left(\\frac{w(\\tau)}{\\gamma(n(t))}e^{\\int_{t}^{\\tau}g(s)d s}\\right)^{\\zeta-\\hat{\\sigma}}-R(\\tau)^{\\zeta-\\hat{\\sigma}}\\right)d\\tau},\n$$  \n\nwhere $g_{y}\\left(t\\right)$ is the growth rate of aggregate output at time $t$ and as noted above, $g(t)$ is the growth rate of $\\gamma(N(t))$  \n\nTo ensure that these value functions are well behaved and non-negative, we impose the following assumption for the rest of the paper.  \n\nASSUMPTION 4: > C.  \n\nThis assumption ensures that innovations are directed toward technologies that allow firms to produce tasks by using the cheaper (or more productive) factors and, consequently, that the present discounted values from innovation are positive. This assumption is intuitive and reasonable: since intermediates embody the technology that directly works with labor or capital, they should be highly complementary with the relevant factor of production in the production of tasks.29  \n\nThe expressions for the value functions, $V_{I}(t)$ and $V_{N}(t)$ in equations (25) and (26) are intuitive. The value of developing new automation technologies depends on the gap between the cost of producing with labor (given by the effective wage, $w(\\tau))$ and the rental rate of capital (recall that $\\widehat{\\sigma}>\\zeta)$ . When the wage is higher, $V_{I}(t)$ increases and technology monopolists have greater incentives to introduce new automation technologies to substitute capital for the more expensive labor. The expression for $V_{N}(t)$ has an analogous interpretation, and is greater when the gap between the rental rate of capital and the cost of producing new tasks with labor (w(T) / r(n(t) is larger. 30  \n\nAn equilibrium with endogenous technology is given by paths $\\{K(t),N(t),I(t)\\}$ for capital and technology (starting from initial values $K(0),N(0),I(0))$ , paths $\\{R(t),\\stackrel{.}{W}(t),W_{I}^{S}(t),W_{N}^{S}(t)\\}$ for factor prices, paths $\\{V_{N}(t),V_{I}(t)\\}$ for the value functions of technology monopolists, and paths $\\{S_{N}(t),S_{I}(t)\\}$ for the allocation of scientists such that all markets clear, all firms and prospective technology monopolists maximize profits, and the representative household maximizes its utility. Using the same normalizations as in the previous section, we can represent the equilibrium with endogenous technology by a path of the tuple $\\{c(t),k(t),n(t),L(t),S_{I}(t),S_{N}(t),$ $V_{I}(t),V_{N}(t)\\}$ such that  \n\n· Consumption satisfies the Euler equation (17） and the labor supply satisfies equation (18);   \nThe transversality condition holds  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{lim}_{t\\to\\infty}\\left(k(t)+\\Pi(t)\\right)e^{-\\int_{0}^{t}(\\rho-(1-\\theta)g(s))d s}=0,\n$$  \n\nwhere in addition to the capital stock, the present value of corporate profits $\\Pi(t)=I(t)V_{I}(t)/Y(t)+N(t)V_{N}(t)/Y(t)$ is  also  part  of  the  representative household's assets;   \nCapital satisfies the resource constraint  \n\n$$\n\\langle(t)=\\Big[1+\\frac{\\eta}{1-\\eta}(1-\\mu)\\Big]F\\big(k(t),L(t);n^{*}(t)\\big)-c(t)e^{-\\frac{1-\\theta}{\\theta}\\nu(L(t))}-(\\delta+g(t))k(t),\n$$  \n\nof this positive scale effect is regulated by the elasticity of substitution $\\hat{\\sigma}$ .Second, because the cheaper factor is substituted for the intermediate with which it is combined, the demand for that intermediate good falls. This countervailing substitution effect is regulated by the elasticity of substitution $\\zeta$ .The condition $\\widehat{\\sigma}>\\zeta$ guarantees that the former, positive effect dominates, so that prospective technology monopolists have an incentive to introduce technologies that allow firms to produce tasks with cheaper factors. When the opposite holds, i.e., $\\zeta>\\widehat{\\sigma}$ wehave the paradoxical situation where technologies that work with more expensive factors are more profitable. In this case, the present discounted values from innovation are negative.  \n\n30 There is an importat difference between the value functions in (25) and (26) and those in models of direted technological change building on factor-augmenting technologies (such as in Acemoglu 1998, 2002). In the latter case, the direction of technological change is determined by the interplay of a market size effect favoring the more abundant factor and a price effect favoring the cheaper factor. The task-based framework here, combined with the assumption on the structure of patents, makes the benefits of new technologies only a function of the factor prices: in particular, the difference between the wage rate and the rental rate. This is because factor prices determine the profitability of producing with capital relative to labor. Without technological constraints, this would determine the set of tasks that the two factors perform. In the presence of technological constraints restricting which tasks can be produced with which factor, factor prices determine the incentives for automation (to expand the set of tasks produced by capital) and the creation of new tasks (to expand the set of tasks produced by labor).  \n\nWe should also note that despite this difference, the general results on absolute weak bias of technology in Acemoglu (2o07) continue to hold here, in the sense that an increase in the abundance of a factor always makes technologymorebiased toward thatfactor.  \n\nwhere recall that $F\\big(k(t),L(t);n^{*}(t)\\big)$ is net output (aggregate output net of intermediates) and $\\frac{\\eta}{1-\\eta}\\left(1-\\mu\\right)F\\big(k(t),L(t);n^{*}(t)\\big)$ is profits of technology monopolists from intermediates;  \n\n· Competition among prospective technology monopolists to hire scientists implies that $W_{I}^{S}(t)~=~\\bar{\\kappa_{I}V_{I}}(t)$ and $W_{N}^{S}(t)~=~\\kappa_{N}V_{N}(t)$ Thus,  \n\n$$\n\\L_{I}(t)~=~S G\\Bigl(\\frac{\\kappa_{I}V_{I}(t)}{Y(t)}~-~\\frac{\\kappa_{N}V_{N}(t)}{Y(t)}\\Bigr),~S_{N}(t)~=~S\\Bigl[1-G\\Bigl(\\frac{\\kappa_{I}V_{I}(t)}{Y(t)}~-~\\frac{\\kappa_{N}V_{N}(t)}{Y(t)}\\Bigr)\\Bigr],\n$$  \n\nand $n(t)$ evolves according to the differential equation,  \n\n$$\n\\dot{n}(t)=\\kappa_{N}S-\\left(\\kappa_{N}+\\kappa_{I}\\right)G\\bigg(\\frac{\\kappa_{I}V_{I}(t)}{Y(t)}-\\frac{\\kappa_{N}V_{N}(t)}{Y(t)}\\bigg)S;\n$$  \n\n’ And the value functions that determine the allocation of scientists, $V_{I}(t)$ and $V_{N}(t)$ , are given by (25) and (26).  \n\nAs before, a BGP is given by an equilibrium in which the normalized variables $c(t),k(t)$ , and $L(t)$ , and the rental rate $R(t)$ are constant, except that now $n(t)$ is determined endogenously. The definition of the equilibrium shows that the profits from automation and the creation of new tasks determine the evolution of $n(t)$ whenever one of the two types of innovation is more profitable, more scientists will be allocated to that activity.  \n\nConsider an allocation where $n(t)=n\\in(0,1)$ . Let us define the normalized value  functions $\\nu_{I}(n)=\\dim_{t\\to\\infty}V_{I}(t)/Y(t)$ and $\\begin{array}{r}{\\nu_{N}(n)=\\operatorname*{lim}_{t\\to\\infty}V_{N}(t)/Y(t)}\\end{array}$ which only depend on $n$ . Equation (28) implies that $\\dot{n}(t)>0$ if and only if $\\kappa_{N}V_{N}(t)>\\kappa_{I}V_{I}(t)$ , and $\\dot{n}(t)<0$ if and only if $\\kappa_{N}V_{N}(t)<\\kappa_{I}V_{I}(t)$ .Thus, if $\\kappa_{I}\\nu_{I}(n)\\neq\\kappa_{N}\\nu_{N}(n)$ , the economy converges to a corner with $n(t)$ equal to 0 or 1, and for an interior BGP with $n\\in(0,1)$ we need  \n\n$$\n\\kappa_{I}\\nu_{I}(n)=\\kappa_{N}\\nu_{N}(n).\n$$  \n\nThe next proposition gives the main result of the paper, and characterizes different types of BGPs with endogenous technology.  \n\nPROPOSITION 6  (Equilibrium with  Endogenous _Technological  Change): SupposethatAssumptions $1^{\\prime},2.$ and4hold.Thereexists $\\overline{S}$ suchthat,when $S<\\overline{{S}}$ wehave:31  \n\n(i)Full Automation: For $\\rho<\\overline{{\\rho}}$ ,there is a BGP in which $n(t)~=~0$ and thus all tasks are produced with capital(this case also requires $B>\\delta+\\rho>\\frac{1-\\theta}{\\theta}\\left(B-\\delta-\\rho\\right)+\\delta$ 1 (B - 8- p) + 8 to ensure the transversality condition).  \n\nFor $\\rho>\\overline{{\\rho}}$ ,all BGPs feature $n(t)~=~n>~\\overline{{n}}(\\rho)$ .Moreover, there exists $\\begin{array}{r l}{\\operatorname{\\overline{{\\mathbf{\\alpha}}}}\\kappa}&{{}\\geq}\\end{array}$ $\\underline{{\\kappa}}~>~0$ suchthat:  \n\n$(i i)$ Unique Interior BGP: if $\\kappa_{I}/\\kappa_{N}>\\overline{{\\kappa}}$ there exists a unique BGP.

In this BGP $n^{*}(t)=1$ and all tasks are produced with labor. ( When $\\rho>\\rho_{\\mathrm{max}}$ weare always in this case.)  \n\nPROOF: See Appendix A.  \n\nThis proposition provides a complete characterization of different types of BGPs. Figure 7 shows visually how different BGPs arise in parts of the parameter space.  \n\nFurther intuition can be gained by studying the behavior $\\kappa_{I}\\nu_{I}(n)$ and $\\kappa_{N}\\nu_{N}(n)$ ， which we do in Figure 8. Lemma A3 shows that, for $S$ small, the normalized value functions can be written as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{}}&{{}}&{{\\nu_{I}(n)=\\cfrac{b\\left((\\rho+\\delta+\\theta g)^{\\zeta-\\widehat{\\sigma}}-w_{I}(n)^{\\zeta-\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\right)}{\\rho+(\\theta-1)g},}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{\\nu_{N}(n)=\\cfrac{b\\left(w_{N}(n)^{\\zeta-\\widehat{\\sigma}}-(\\rho+\\delta+\\theta g)^{\\zeta-\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\right)}{\\rho+(\\theta-1)g}.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe profitability of the two types of technologies depends on the effective wages, $w_{I}(n)$ and $w_{N}(n)$ . A lower value of $n$ , which corresponds to additional automation, reduces $w_{I}(n)$ : in other words $w_{I}(n)$ is increasing in $n$ . This is because of comparative advantage: as more tasks are automated, the equilibrium wage increases less than $\\gamma(I)$ , and it becomes cheaper to produce the least complex tasks with labor, and thus automation becomes less profitable. Because $w_{I}(n)$ is increasing in $n$ , so is $\\nu_{I}(n)$ (recall that $\\hat{\\sigma}>\\zeta,$ . However, $\\nu_{N}(n)$ is also increasing in n $:w_{N}(n)$ is decreasing in $n$ as the long-run wage increases with automation owing to the productivity effect discussed in the previous section. We will see next that the fact that $\\nu_{N}(n)$ is increasing in $n$ creates a force toward multiplicity of BGPs, while the fact that $\\nu_{I}(n)$ is increasing in $n$ pushes toward uniqueness and stability.  \n\nPanel A of Figure 8 illustrates the first part of Proposition 6 (which parallels the first part of Proposition 4): when $\\rho\\mathrm{~<~}\\overline{{\\rho}}$ ， $\\kappa_{I}\\nu_{I}(0)$ is above $\\kappa_{N}\\nu_{N}(0)$ for $n<\\widetilde{n}(\\rho)$ In this region it is not optimal to create new tasks. Consequently, there exists a BGP with full automation, meaning that all tasks will be automated and produced with capital. Reminiscent of Leontief's “horse equilibrium, in this BGP labor becomes redundant. Intuitively, as also shown in Figure 4, when $\\rho\\mathrm{~<~}\\overline{{\\rho}}$ and $n<\\widetilde{n}(\\rho)$ ,we  \n\n![](images/d6ade3c1e66ed0ca81584e34b8481b3a3ebd0fb3475470d9547f473d22e5162c.jpg)  \nFIGURE 7.

In panel A, $\\kappa_{I}\\nu_{I}(n)$ is everywhere $\\kappa_{N}\\nu_{N}(n)$ and the BGP involves full automation. In panel B, if $\\kappa_{I}/\\kappa_{N}$ is sufficiently large, the two curves intersect, and we have an interior BGP with both automation and creation of new tasks. Panel $\\mathrm{B}$ also shows the effect of an increase in the productivity of scientists in automating tasks from $\\kappa_{I}$ to $\\kappa_{I}^{\\prime}$  \n\nhave $w_{N}(n)>\\rho+\\delta+\\theta g$ , which implies that labor is too expensive relative to capital. Utilizing and thus creating new tasks is not profitable. Economic growth in this BGP is driven by capital accumulation (because when all tasks are automated, aggregate output is linear in capital).  \n\nPanel B illustrates the remaining three types of BGPs, which apply when $\\rho>$ $\\overline{{\\rho}}$ . In this case, at $n=0$ (or at any $n\\leq\\overline{{n}}(\\rho))$ ， $\\kappa_{I}\\nu_{I}(n)$ is strictly below $\\kappa_{N}\\nu_{N}(n)$ and thus a full automation BGP is not possible. The two curves can only intersect for $n\\in(\\overline{{n}}(\\rho),1]$ , implying that in any BGP, newly automated tasks will be immediately produced with capital. As explained above, both of these curves are increasing but their relative slopes depend on $\\kappa_{I}/\\kappa_{N}.$ When $\\kappa_{I}/\\kappa_{N}<\\underline{{\\kappa}},\\kappa_{I}\\nu_{I}(n)$  \n\nis not sufficiently steep relative to $\\kappa_{N}\\nu_{N}(n)$ , and the two never intersect. This means that even at $n=1$ , it is not profitable to create new automation technologies, and all tasks will be produced with labor. In this BGP, capital becomes redundant, and growth is driven by endogenous technological change increasing labor's productivity as in the standard quality ladder models such as Aghion and Howitt (1992) or Grossman and Helpman (1991).  \n\nConversely, when $\\kappa_{I}/\\kappa_{N}>\\overline{{\\kappa}}$ ,thecurve $\\kappa_{I}\\nu_{I}(n)$ is sufficiently steep relative to $\\kappa_{N}\\nu_{N}(n)$ so that the two curves necessarily intersect and can only intersect once. Hence, there exists a unique interior BGP (interior in the sense that now the BGP level of $n$ is strictly between 0 and 1, and thus some tasks are produced with labor and some with capital).  \n\nFinally, when $\\overline{{\\kappa}}>\\kappa_{I}/\\kappa_{N}>\\underline{{\\kappa}}$ , the two curves will intersect, but will do so multiple times, leading to multiple interior BGPs.  \n\nProposition 6 also shows that for $\\kappa_{I}/\\kappa_{N}>\\overline{{\\kappa}}$ , the unique interior BGP is globally stable provided that the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is infinite (i.e., $\\theta=0,$ and locally stable otherwise (i.e., when $\\theta>0$ ).Because $\\kappa_{I}\\nu_{I}(n)$ starts below $\\kappa_{N}\\nu_{N}(n)$ at $\\overline{{n}}(\\rho)$ (reflecting the fact that at this point, new automation technologies are not immediately adopted and thus the value of creating these technologies is 0), the unique intersection must have the former curve being steeper than the former. At this point, a further increase in $n$ always raises the value of automating an additional task, $\\nu_{I}(n)$ , more than the value of creating a new task, $\\nu_{N}(n)$ . This ensures that increases in $n$ beyond its BGP value trigger further automation, while lower values of $n$ encourage the creation of new tasks, ensuring the stability of the unique BGP.  \n\nThe asymptotic stability of the interior BGP implies that there are powerful market forces pushing the economy toward balanced growth. An important consequence of this stability is that technological shocks that reduce $n$ (e.g., the arrival of a series of new automation technologies) will set in motion self-correcting forces. Following such a change, there will be an adjustment process restoring the level of employment and the labor share back to their initial values.  \n\nThis does not, however, imply that all shocks will leave the long-run prospects of labor unchanged. For one, this would not necessarily be the case in a situation with multiple steady states, and moreover, certain changes in the environment (for example, a large increase in $B$ or a decline in $\\rho$ ) can shift the economy from the region in which there is a unique interior BGP to the region with full automation, with disastrous consequences for labor. In addition, the next corollary shows that, if there is a change in the innovation possibilities frontier (in the $\\kappa\\mathbf{S}$ )that makes it permanently easier to develop new automation technologies, self-correcting forces still operate but will now only move the economy to a new BGP with lower employment and a lower labor share.  \n\nCOROLLARY 2: Suppose that $\\rho>\\overline{{\\rho}}$ and $\\kappa_{I}/\\kappa_{N}>\\overline{{\\kappa}}$ .A one-time permanent increasein $\\kappa_{I}/\\kappa_{N}$ leadstoaBGPwith lower $n$ ,employment and labor share.  \n\nThis corollary follows by noting that an increase in $\\kappa_{I}/\\kappa_{N}$ shifts the intersection of the curves $\\kappa_{I}\\nu_{I}(n)$ and $\\kappa_{N}\\nu(n)$ to the left as shown by the blue dotted curve in Figure 8, leading to a lower value of $n$ in the BGP. This triggers an adjustment process in which the labor share and employment decline over time, but ultimately settle to their new (interior) BGP values. The transition process will involve a slower rate of increase of $N$ and a more rapid rate of increase of $I$ than the BGP. Interestingly, if new tasks generate larger productivity gains than automation, this transition process will also be associated with a slowdown in productivity growth because automation crowds out resources that could be used to develop new tasks.32  \n\nIn summary, Proposition 6 characterizes the different types of BGPs, and together with Corollary 2, it delineates the types of changes in technology that trigger self-correcting dynamics. Starting from the interior BGP, the effects of (small) increases in automation technology will reverse themselves over time, restoring employment and the labor share back to their initial values. Permanent changes in the ability of society to create new automation technologies trigger self-correcting dynamics as well, but these will take us toward a new BGP with lower employment and labor share, and may also involve slower productivity growth in the process.  \n\n## IV. Extensions  \n\nIn this section we discuss three extensions. First we introduce heterogeneous skills, which allow us to analyze the impact of technological changes on inequality. Second, we study a different structure of intellectual property rights that introduces the creative destruction of profits. Finally, we discuss the welfare implications of our model.  \n\n### A.Automation, New Tasks, and Inequality  \n\nTo study how automation and the creation of new tasks impact inequality, we now introduce heterogeneous skills. This extension is motivated by the observation that both automation and new tasks could increase inequality: new tasks favor high-skill workers who tend to have a comparative advantage in new and complex tasks, while automation substitutes capital for labor in lower-indexed tasks where low-skill workers have their comparative advantage.  \n\nThe assumption that high-skill workers have a comparative advantage in new tasks receives support from the data. Figure 9 shows that occupations with more new job titles in 1980, 1990, and 2000 employed workers with greater average years of schooling.3  \n\nTo incorporate this feature, we assume that there are two types of workers: low-skill workers with time-varying productivity $\\gamma_{L}(i,t)$ in task $i$ and high-skill workers with productivity $\\gamma_{H}(i)$ . We parametrize these productivities as follows.  \n\n![](images/39f3314335e1e71d849c009d593270befca06aa58b0d21b6627716f668c58f54.jpg)  \nFIGURE9.AVERAGEYEARS OFSCHOOLINGAMONGWORKERSANDTHESHARE OFNEWJOB TITLES IN 1980,1990,AND2000  \n\nNote: See online Appendix B for data sources and detailed definitions.  \n\nASSUMPTION $1^{\\prime\\prime}$ :The productivities of high-skill and low-skill workers are givenby  \n\n$$\n\\gamma_{H}(i)=e^{A_{H}i},\\gamma_{L}(i,t)=e^{\\xi A_{H}i}\\Gamma(t-T(i)),\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\Gamma$ is increasing with $\\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname*{lim}_{x\\to\\infty}\\Gamma(x)=1,\\xi\\in(0,1]}\\end{array}$ and $T(i)$ denotes the time whentask $i$ was first introduced.  \n\nAssumption $1^{\\prime\\prime}$ is similar to but extends Assumption $1^{\\prime}$ in several dimensions. The ratio $\\gamma_{H}(i)/\\gamma_{L}(i,t)$ is increasing in $i$ . which implies that high-skill workers have a comparative advantage in higher-indexed tasks. But in addition, we also let the productivity of low-skill workers in a task increase over time, as captured by the increasing function $\\Gamma$ . This captures the idea that as new tasks become \"standardized,’ they can be more productively performed by less skilled workers (e.g., Acemoglu, Gancia, and Zilibotti 2012), or that workers adapt to new technologies by acquiring human capital through training, on-the-job learning, and schooling (e.g., Schultz 1975; Nelson and Phelps 1966; Galor and Moav 2000; Goldin and Katz 2008; and Beaudy, Green, and Sand 2016). Since the function $\\Gamma$ limits to 1 over time, the parameter $\\xi$ determines whether this standardization effect is complete or incomplete. When $\\xi<1$ , the productivity of low-skill workers relative to high-skill workers converges to $\\gamma_{L}(i,i)/\\gamma_{H}(i)=\\gamma_{H}(i)^{\\xi-1}$ , and limits to zero as more and more advanced tasks are introduced. In contrast, when $\\xi=1$ , the relative productivity of low-skill workers converges to 1 for tasks that have been around for a long time.  \n\nThe structure of comparative advantage ensures that there exists a threshold task $M$ such that high-skill labor performs tasks in $[M,N]$ , low-skill labor performs tasks in $(I^{*},M)$ , and capital performs tasks in $\\left[N-1,I^{*}\\right]$ . In what follows, we denote the wages of high and low-skill labor by $W_{H}$ and $W_{L},$ respectively, and to simplify the discussion, we focus on the economy with exogenous technology and assume that the supply of high-skill labor is fixed at $H$ and the supply of low-skill labor is fixed at $L$  \n\nPROPOSITION 7 (Automation, New Tasks, and Inequality): Suppose Assumptions $1^{\\prime\\prime}$ and 2 hold. Suppose also that technology evolves exogenously with $\\dot{N}=\\dot{I}=\\Delta$ and $n(t)=n>\\operatorname*{max}\\{\\overline{{n}}(\\rho),\\widetilde{n}(\\rho)\\}$ (and $A_{H}(1-\\theta)\\Delta<\\rho)$ .Then, there exists a uniqueBGP.Depending on thevalue of $\\xi$ this BGP takes one of the following forms:  \n\n(i) $I f\\xi<1$ , in the unique BGP we have $\\mathrm{lim}_{t\\rightarrow\\infty}W_{H}(t)/W_{L}(t)=\\infty$ theshare of tasks performed by low-skill workers converges to zero, and capital and high-skill workers perform constant shares of tasks.  \n\n(ii) If $\\xi=1$ ,in the unique BGP $W_{H}(t)$ and $W_{L}(t)$ grow at the same rate as the economy, the wage gap, $W_{H}(t)/W_{L}(t)$ , remains constant, and capital, low-skill, and high-skill workers perform constant shares of tasks. Moreover, $\\mathrm{lim}_{t\\rightarrow\\infty}W_{H}(t)/W_{L}(t)$ is decreasing in n. Consequently, a permanent increase in $N$ raises the wage gap $W_{H}(t)/W_{L}(t)$ in the short run, but reduces it in the long run, while a permanent increase in $I$ raises the wage gap in both the short and the long run.  \n\nLike all remaining proofs in the paper, the proof of this proposition is in online AppendixB.  \n\nWhen $\\xi<1$ , this extension confirms the pessimistic scenario about the implications of new technologies for wage inequality and the employment prospects of low-skill workers: both automation and the creation of new tasks increase inequality, the former because it displaces low-skill workers ahead of high-skill workers, and the latter because it directly benefits high-skill workers who have a comparative advantage in newer, more complex tasks relative to low-skill workers. As a result, low-skill workers are progressively squeezed into a smaller and smaller set of tasks, and wage inequality grows without bound.  \n\nHowever, our extended model also identifies a countervailing force, which becomes particularly potent when $\\xi=1$ . Because new tasks become standardized, they can over time be as productively used by low-skill workers. In this case, automation and the creation of new tasks still reduce the relative earnings of low-skill workers in the short run, but their long-run implications are very different. In the long run, inequality is decreasing in $n$ (because a higher $n$ translates into a greater range of tasks for low-skill workers). Consequently, automation increases inequality both in the short and the long run. The creation of new tasks, which leads to a permanently higher level of $n$ , increases inequality in the short run but reduces it in the long run. These observations suggest that inequality may be high following a period of adjustment in which the labor share first declines (due to increases in automation), and then recovers (due to the introduction and later standardization of new tasks).  \n\n### B. Creative Destruction of Profits  \n\nIn this subsection, we modify our baseline assumption on intellectual property rights and revert to the classical setup in the literature in which new technologies do not infringe the patents of the products that they replace (Aghion and Howitt 1992; Grossman and Helpman 1991). This assumption introduces the creative destruction effects: the destruction of profits of previous inventors by new innovators. We will see that this alternative structure has similar implications for the BGP, but necessitates more demanding conditions to guarantee its uniqueness and stability.  \n\nLet us first define $V_{N}(t,i)$ and $V_{I}(t,i)$ as thetime $t$ valuesfortechnologymonopolist with, respectively, new task and automation technologies. These value functions satisfy the following Bellman equations:  \n\n$$\nr(t)V_{N}(t,i)-\\dot{V}_{N}(t,i)=\\pi_{N}(t,i),\\qquadr(t)V_{I}(t,i)-\\dot{V}_{I}(t,i)=\\pi_{I}(t,i).\n$$  \n\nHere $\\pi_{I}(t,i)$ and $\\pi_{N}(t,i)$ denote the flow profits from automating and creating new tasks, respectively, which are given by the formulas in equations (23) and (24).  \n\nFor a firm creating a new task i, let $\\dot{T}^{N}(i)$ denote the time at which it will be replaced by a technology allowing the automation of this task. Likewise, let $T^{I}(i)$ denote the time at which an automated task $i$ will be replaced by a new task using labor. Since firms anticipate these deterministic replacement dates, their value functions also  satisfy the  boundary  conditions ${\\cal V}_{N}({\\bar{T}}^{N}(i),i)=0$ and $V_{I}(T^{I}(i),i)~=~0$ Together with these boundary conditions, the Bellman equations solve for  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{^{\\scriptscriptstyle{c D}}_{^{N}}(t)=V_{N}(N(t),t)=b\\int_{t}^{T^{N}(N(t))}e^{-\\int_{t}^{\\tau}(R(s)-\\delta)d s}Y(\\tau)\\bigg(\\displaystyle\\frac{W(\\tau)}{\\gamma(N(t))}\\bigg)^{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\zeta-\\hat{\\sigma}}}d\\tau,}}\\ {{^{\\scriptscriptstyle{c D}}_{^{I}}(t)=V_{I}(I(t),t)=b\\int_{t}^{T^{I}(I(t))}e^{-\\int_{t}^{\\tau}(R(s)-\\delta)d s}Y(\\tau)\\bigg(\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{min}\\bigg\\{R(\\tau),\\frac{W(\\tau)}{\\gamma(I(t))}\\bigg\\}\\bigg)^{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\zeta-\\hat{\\sigma}}}d\\tau.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFor reasons that will become evident, we modify the innovation possibilities frontier to  \n\n$$\n\\dot{I}(t)=\\kappa_{I}\\iota(n(t))S_{I}(t),\\mathrm{and}\\dot{N}(t)=\\kappa_{N}S_{N}(t).\n$$  \n\nHere, the function $\\iota(n(t))$ is included and assumed to be nondecreasing to capture the possibility that automating tasks closer to the frontier (defined as the highest-indexed task available) may be more difficult.  \n\nLet us again define the normalized value functions as $\\nu_{I}^{C D}(n)$ $=\\begin{array}{r}{=\\operatorname*{lim}_{t\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{V_{I}^{C D}(t)}{Y(t)}}\\end{array}$ $\\nu_{N}^{C D}(n)=\\operatorname*{lim}_{t\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{V_{N}^{C D}(t)}{Y(t)}$ VP? In a BG, he omaied value functions only depend on $n$ because newly-created tasks are automated after a period of length $T^{N}(N(t))-t=n/\\Delta$ , and newly-automated tasks are replaced by new ones after a period of length $T^{I}(I(t))-t=\\frac{1-n}{\\Delta}$ 1-n, where △ = $\\Delta=\\frac{\\kappa_{I}\\kappa_{N}\\iota(n)}{\\kappa_{I}\\iota(n)+\\kappa_{N}}S$ -Sis the endogenous rate at which $N$ and $I$ grow. The endogenous value of $n$ in an interior BGP satisfies  \n\n$$\n\\kappa_{I}\\iota(n)\\nu_{I}^{C D}(n)~=~\\kappa_{N}\\nu_{N}^{C D}(n).\n$$  \n\nThe next proposition focuses on interior BGPs and shows that, because of creative destruction, we must impose additional assumptions on the function $\\iota(n)$ to guarantee stability.  \n\nPROPOSITION 8 (Equilibrium with Creative Destruction): Suppose that $\\rho>\\overline{{\\rho}}$ Assumptions $1^{\\prime},2$ , and 4 hold, and there is creative destruction of profits. Then,  \n\n(i)  There exist $\\tau$ and $\\underline{{\\iota}}_{\\mathrm{~\\tiny~<~\\overline{~}{~\\iota~}~}}$ such that if $\\iota(0)<\\underline{{\\iota}}$ and $\\iota(1)>\\overline{{\\iota}}$ , then there is at least one locally stable interior BGP with $n(t)=n\\in(\\overline{{n}}(\\rho),1)$   \n$(i i)$ If $\\dot{\\iota}(n)$ is constant,thereisnostableinterior $B G P(w i t h n(t)\\:=\\:n\\in\\mathbf{\\alpha}(\\overline{{n}}(\\rho),1))$ Any stable BGP involves $n(t)\\to0$ or $n(t)\\to1$  \n\nThe first part of the proposition follows from an analogous argument to that in the proof of Proposition 6, with the only difference being that, because of the presence of the function $\\iota(n)$ in equation (30), the key condition that pins down $n$ becomes $\\kappa_{I}\\iota(n)\\nu_{I}^{C D}(n)=\\acute{\\kappa}_{N}\\nu_{N}^{C D}(n)$  \n\nThe major difference with our previous analysis is that creative destruction introduces a new source of instability. Unlike the previous case with no creative destruction, we now have that $\\nu_{I}^{C D}(n)$ is decreasing in n. As more tasks are automated, the rental rate remains unchanged and newly-automated tasks will be replaced less frequently (recall that newly-automated tasks are replaced after $(1-n)/\\Delta$ units of time). As a result, automating more tasks renders further automation more profitable. Moreover, $\\nu_{N}^{C D}(n)$ continues to be increasing in $n$ This is for two reasons: first, as before, the productivity effect ensures that the effective wage in new tasks, $w_{N}(n)$ , is decreasing in $n$ ; and second, because newly-created tasks are automated after $n/\\Delta$ units of time, an increase in $n$ increases the present discounted value of profits from new tasks. These observations imply that, if $\\iota(n)$ were constant, the intersection between the curves $\\kappa_{N}\\nu_{N}^{C D}\\left(n\\right)$ and $\\kappa_{I}\\iota(n)\\nu_{I}^{C D}(n)$ would correspond to an unstable BGP.  \n\nEconomically, the instability is a consequence of the fact that, in contrast to our baseline model (and the socially planned economy which we describe in the next subsection), here innovation incentives depend on the total revenue that a technology generates rather than its incremental value created (the difference between these revenues and the revenues that the replaced technology generated). In our baseline model, the key force ensuring stability is that incentives to automate are shaped by the cost difference between producing a task with capital or with labor: by lowering the effective wage at the next tasks to be automated, current automation reduces the incremental value of additional automation. This force is absent when innovators destroy the profits of previous technology monopolists because they no longer care about the cost of production with the technology that they are replacing.  \n\n### C. Welfare  \n\nWe study welfare from two complementary perspectives. First, in online Appendix B, we discuss the socially optimal allocation in the presence of endogenous technology and characterize how this allocation can be decentralized. One of the main insights from Proposition 6 is that the expected path for factor prices determines the incentives to automate and create new tasks. We show that a planner would also allocate scientists according to the same principle—guided by the cost savings that each technology grants to firms. Although similar to the efficient allocation of scientists in this regard, the decentralized equilibrium is typically inefficient because the technology monopolists neither capture the full benefits from the new tasks they create nor internalize how their innovation affects other existing and future technology monopolists.  \n\nThe second perspective is more novel and relevant to current debates about automation reducing employment and its policy implications. We examine whether an exogenous increase in automation could reduce welfare. Even though automation expands productivity, a force which always raises welfare, it also reduces employment. When the labor market is fully competitive as in our baseline model, this reduction in employment has no first-order welfare cost for the representative household (who sets the marginal cost of labor supply equal to the wage). Consequently, automation increases overall welfare. Next suppose that there are labor market frictions. In particular, suppose that there exists an upward-sloping quasi-labor supply schedule, $L_{q s}(\\omega)$ , which constrains the level of employment, so that $L\\leq L_{q s}(\\omega)$ (see online Appendix B for a microfoundation). This quasi-labor supply schedule then acts in a very similar fashion to the labor supply curve derived in (11) in Section I, except that the marginal cost of labor supply is no longer equated to the wage. Crucially, the reduction in employment resulting from automation now has a negative impact on welfare, and this negative effect can exceed the positive impact following from the productivity gains, turning automation, on net, into a negative for welfare.  \n\nThe next proposition provides the conditions under which automation can reduce welfare in the context of our static model with exogenous technology. Our focus on the static model is for transparency. The same forces are present in the dynamic model and also in the full model with endogenous technology.  \n\nPROPOSITION 9 (Welfare Implication of Automation): Consider the static economy and suppose that Assumptions 1,2, and 3 hold,and that $I^{*}=I<\\tilde{I}.$ Let $\\mathcal{W}=u(C,L)$ denote the welfare of representative household.  \n\n(i) Consider the baseline model without labor market frictions, where the representative household chooses the amount of labor without constraints andthus $W/C=\\nu^{\\prime}(L)$ Then,  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle\\frac{d\\mathcal{W}}{d I}=\\left(C e^{-\\nu(L)}\\right)^{1-\\theta}\\displaystyle\\frac{B^{\\hat{\\sigma}-1}}{1-\\hat{\\sigma}}\\bigg(\\left(\\frac{W}{\\gamma(I)}\\right)^{1-\\hat{\\sigma}}-R^{1-\\hat{\\sigma}}\\bigg)>0,}\\ {\\displaystyle\\frac{d\\mathcal{W}}{d N}=\\left(C e^{-\\nu(L)}\\right)^{1-\\theta}\\displaystyle\\frac{B^{\\hat{\\sigma}-1}}{1-\\hat{\\sigma}}\\bigg(R^{1-\\hat{\\sigma}}-\\left(\\frac{W}{\\gamma(N)}\\right)^{1-\\hat{\\sigma}}\\bigg)>0.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n(i)Suppose that there are labor market frictions, so that employment is constrained by a quasi-labor supplycurve $L\\leq L_{q s}(\\omega)$ . Suppose also that the quasi-labor supplyschedule $L_{q s}(\\omega)$ is increasing in $\\omega$ ,has an elasticity $\\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_{L}>0$ , and is binding in the sense that $W/C>\\nu^{\\prime}(L)$ .Then,  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathcal{W}}{d I}=\\left(C e^{-\\nu(L)}\\right)^{1-\\theta}\\left[\\frac{B^{\\hat{\\sigma}-1}}{1-\\hat{\\sigma}}\\Bigg(\\left(\\frac{W}{\\gamma(I)}\\right)^{1-\\hat{\\sigma}}-R^{1-\\hat{\\sigma}}\\Bigg)-L\\Big(\\frac{W}{C}-\\nu^{\\prime}(L)\\Big)\\frac{\\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_{L}}{\\hat{\\sigma}+\\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_{L}}\\Lambda_{I}\\right]\\lessgtr0,\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathcal{W}}{d N}=\\left(C e^{-\\nu(L)}\\right)^{1-\\theta}\\left[\\frac{B^{\\hat{\\sigma}-1}}{1-\\hat{\\sigma}}\\left(R^{1-\\hat{\\sigma}}-\\left(\\frac{W}{\\gamma(N)}\\right)^{1-\\hat{\\sigma}}\\right)+L\\Big(\\frac{W}{C}-\\nu^{\\prime}(L)\\Big)\\frac{\\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_{L}}{\\hat{\\sigma}+\\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_{L}}\\Lambda_{N}\\right]~>~0.\n$$  \n\nThe first part of the proposition shows that both types of technological improvements increase welfare when the labor market has no frictions. In this case, automation increases productivity by substituting cheaper capital for human labor, and this leads to less work for workers, but since they were previously choosing labor supply optimally, a small reduction in employment does not have a first-order impact on welfare, and overall welfare increases. The implications of the creation of new tasks are similar.  \n\nThe situation is quite different in the presence of labor market frictions, however, as shown in the second part. Automation again increases productivity and reduces employment. But now, because workers are constrained in their labor supply choices, the lower employment that results from automation has a first-order negative effect on their welfare. Consequently, automation can reduce welfare if the productivity gains, captured by the first term, are not sufficiently large to compensate for the second, negative term. Interestingly, in this case new tasks increase welfare even more than before, because they not only raise productivity but also expand employment, and by the same logic, the increase in labor supply has a welfare benefit for the workers (since they were previously constrained in their employment).  \n\nAn important implication of this analysis emphasized further in online Appendix B is that when labor market frictions are present and the direction of technological change is endogenized, there will be a force toward excessive automation. In particular, in this case, assuming that labor market frictions also constrain the social planner's choices, the decentralized equilibrium involves too much effort being devoted to improving automation relative to what she would like, because the social planner recognizes that additional automation has a negative effect through employment.  \n\n## V. Conclusion  \n\nAs automation, robotics, and AI technologies are advancing rapidly, concerns that new technologies will render labor redundant have intensified. This paper develops a comprehensive framework in which these forces can be analyzed and contrasted. At the center of our model is a task-based framework. Automation is modeled as the (endogenous) expansion of the set of tasks that can be performed by capital, replacing labor in tasks that it previously produced. The main new feature of our framework is that, in addition to automation, there is another type of technological change complementing labor. In our model, this takes the form of the introduction of new, more complex versions of existing tasks, and it is assumed that labor has a comparative advantage in these new tasks. We characterize the structure of equilibrium in such a model, showing how, given factor prices, the allocation of tasks between capital and labor is determined both by available technology and the endogenous choices of firms between producing with capital or labor.  \n\nOne attractive feature of task-based models is that they highlight the link between factor prices and the range of tasks allocated to factors: when the equilibrium range of tasks allocated to capital increases (for example, as a result of automation), the wage relative to the rental rate and the labor share decline, and the equilibrium wage rate may also fall. Conversely, as the equilibrium range of tasks allocated to labor increases, the opposite result obtains. In our model, because the supply of labor is elastic, automation also tends to reduce employment, while the creation of new tasks increases employment. These results highlight that, while both types of technological changes undergird economic growth, they have very different implications for the factor distribution of income and employment.  \n\nOur full model endogenizes the direction of research toward automation and the creation of new tasks. If in the long run capital is very cheap relative to labor, automation technologies will advance rapidly and labor will become redundant. However, when the long-run rental rate of capital is not so low relative to labor, our framework generates a BGP in which both types of innovation go hand-in-hand. Moreover in this case, under reasonable assumptions, the dynamic equilibrium is unique and converges to the BGP. Underpinning this stability result is the impact of relative factor prices on the direction of technological change. The task-based framework, differently from the standard models of directed technological change based on factor-augmenting technologies, implies that as a factor becomes cheaper, this not only influences the range of tasks allocated to it, but also generates incentives for the introduction of technologies that allow firms to utilize this factor more intensively. These economic incentives then imply that by reducing the effective cost of labor in the least complex tasks, automation discourages further automation and generates a self-correcting force toward stability.  \n\nWe show in addition that, though market forces ensure the stability of the BGP, they do not necessarily generate the efficient composition of technology. If the elastic labor supply relationship results from rents (so that there is a wedge between the wage and the opportunity cost of labor), there is an important new distortion: because firms make automation decisions according to the wage rate, not the lower opportunity cost of labor, there is a natural bias toward excessive automation.  \n\nSeveral commentators are further concerned about the inequality implications of automation and related new technologies. We study this question by extending our model so that high-skill labor has a comparative advantage in new tasks relative to low-skill labor. In this case, both automation (which squeezes out tasks previously performed by low-skill labor) and the creation of new tasks (which directly benefits high-skill labor) increase inequality. Nevertheless, the long-term implications of the creation of new tasks could be very different, because they are later standardized and used by low-skill labor. If this standardization effect is sufficiently powerful, there exists a BGP in which not only the factor distribution of income (between capital and labor) but also inequality between the two skill types stays constant.  \n\nWe consider our paper to be a first step toward a systematic investigation of different types of technological changes that impact capital and labor differentially. Several areas of research appear fruitful based on this first step. First, our model imposes that it is always the tasks at the bottom that are automated; in reality, it may be those in the middle (e.g., Acemoglu and Autor 2001). Incorporating the possibility of such \"middling tasks” being automated is an important generalization, though ensuring a pattern of productivity growth consistent with balanced growth in this case is more challenging. Second, there may be technological barriers to the automation of certain tasks and the creation of new tasks across industries (e.g., Polanyi 1976; Autor, Levy, and Murnane 2003). An interesting step is to construct realistic models in which the sectoral composition of tasks performed by capital and labor as well as technology evolves endogenously and is subject to industry-level technological constraints (e.g., on the feasibility or speed of automation). Third, in this paper we have focused on the creation of new labor-intensive tasks as the type of technological change that complements labor and plays a countervailing role against automation. Another interesting area is to theoretically and empirically investigate different types of technologies that may complement labor. Fourth, our analysis of the creation of new tasks and standardization abstracted from the need for workers to acquire new skills to work in such tasks. In practice, the acquisition of new skills may need to go hand-in-hand with workers shifting to newer tasks, and the inability of the educational system to adapt to the requirements of these new tasks could become a bottleneck and prevent the rebound in the demand for labor following a wave of automation. Finally, and perhaps most important, our model highlights the need for additional empirical evidence on how automation impacts employment and wages (which we investigate in Acemoglu and Restrepo 2017a) and how the incentives for automation and the creation of new tasks respond to policies, factor prices, and supplies (some aspects of which are studied in Acemoglu and Restrepo 2018b).  \n\nAPPENDIX A: PROOFS  \n\n### A. General Model  \n\nThe analysis in the text was carried out under Assumption 2, which imposed $\\eta\\rightarrow0$ Or $\\zeta=1$ , and significantly simplified some of the key expressions. Throughout the Appendix, we relax Assumption 2 and replace it with the following.  \n\nASSUMPTION $2{}^{\\prime}\\cdot$ : One of the following three conditions holds: (i) $\\eta\\rightarrow0$ $(i i)$ $\\zeta=1;o r\\:(i i i)$  \n\n$$\n|\\sigma-\\zeta|<\\left(\\frac{\\gamma(N-1)}{\\gamma(N)}\\right)^{\\operatorname*{max}\\{1,\\sigma\\}}\\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{\\gamma(N)}{\\gamma(N-1)}\\right)^{|1-\\zeta|}-1}.\n$$  \n\nAll of our qualitative results remain true and will be proved under this more general assumption. Intuitively, the conditions in Assumption 2 ensured homotheticity (see footnote 12). Assumption $2^{\\prime}$ , on the other hand, requires that the departure from homotheticity is small relative to the inverse of the productivity gains from new tasks (where $\\gamma(N)/\\gamma(N-1)$ measures these productivity gains).  \n\nTask prices in this more general case are given by  \n\n(A2) p(i） =  \n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l l}{\\displaystyle c^{u}\\left(\\operatorname*{min}\\left\\{R,\\frac{W}{\\gamma(i)}\\right\\}\\right)~=~\\left[\\eta\\psi^{1-\\zeta}+(1-\\eta)\\operatorname*{min}\\left\\{R,\\frac{W}{\\gamma(i)}\\right\\}^{1-\\zeta}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{1-\\zeta}}}&{\\mathrm{if~}i\\leq I}\\ {\\displaystyle c^{u}\\left(\\frac{W}{\\gamma(i)}\\right)~=~\\left[\\eta\\psi^{1-\\zeta}+(1-\\eta)\\left(\\frac{W}{\\gamma(i)}\\right)^{1-\\zeta}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{1-\\zeta}}}&{\\mathrm{if~}i>I}\\end{array}\\right..\n$$  \n\nHere $c^{u}(\\cdot)$ is the unit cost of production for task $i$ , derived from the task production functions, (2) and (3). Naturally, this equation simplifies to (5) under Assumption 2. From equations (5) and (7), equilibrium levels of task production are  \n\n$$\ny(i)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{B^{\\hat{\\sigma}-1}Y c^{u}\\left(\\operatorname*{min}\\left\\{R,\\displaystyle\\frac{W}{\\gamma(i)}\\right\\}\\right)^{-\\sigma}}&{\\mathrm{if}i\\leq I}\\ {B^{\\hat{\\sigma}-1}Y c^{u}\\left(\\displaystyle\\frac{W}{\\gamma(i)}\\right)^{-\\sigma}}&{\\mathrm{if}i>I}\\end{array}.\\right.\n$$  \n\nCombining this with equations (2) and (3), we obtain the task-level demands for capital and labor as  \n\n$$\nk(i)~=~{\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{B^{{\\widehat{\\sigma}}-1}(1-\\eta)Y c^{u}(R)^{\\zeta-\\sigma}R^{-\\zeta}}&{{\\mathrm{if~}}i\\leq I^{*}}\\ {0}&{{\\mathrm{if~}}i>I^{*}}\\end{array}\\right.}\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\nl(i)~=~\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{0}&{\\mathrm{if~}i\\leq I^{*}}\\ {B^{\\hat{\\sigma}-1}(1-\\eta)Y\\gamma(i)^{\\zeta-1}c^{u}\\Big(\\displaystyle\\frac{W}{\\gamma(i)}\\Big)^{\\zeta-\\sigma}W^{-\\zeta}}&{\\mathrm{if~}i>I^{*}}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nAggregating the preceding two equations across tasks, we obtain the following capital and labor market-clearing equations,  \n\n$$\nB^{\\hat{\\sigma}-1}(1-\\eta)Y(I^{*}-N+1)c^{u}(R)^{\\zeta-\\sigma}R^{-\\zeta}=K,\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\nB^{\\hat{\\sigma}-1}(1-\\eta)Y\\int_{I^{*}}^{N}\\gamma(i)^{\\zeta-1}c^{u}\\biggl({\\frac{W}{\\gamma(i)}}\\biggr)^{\\zeta-\\sigma}W^{-\\zeta}d i=L^{s}\\biggl({\\frac{W}{R K}}\\biggr).\n$$  \n\nFinally, from the choice of aggregate output as the numéraire, we obtain a generalized version of the ideal price condition,  \n\n$$\n(I^{*}-N+1)c^{u}(R)^{1-\\sigma}+\\int_{I^{*}}^{N}c^{u}\\biggl({\\frac{W}{\\gamma(i)}}\\biggr)^{1-\\sigma}d i=B^{1-\\widehat\\sigma},\n$$  \n\nwhich again simplifies to the ideal price index condition in the text, (10), under Assumption 2.  \n\n### B. Proofs from Section II  \n\n# PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1:  \n\nWe prove Proposition 1 under the more general Assumption $2^{\\prime}$  \n\nTo prove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium, we proceed in three steps. First, we show that $I^{*},N,$ and $K$ determine unique equilibrium values for $R,W.$ and $Y$ . thus allowing us to define the function $\\omega(I^{*},N,K)$ representing the relative demand for labor, which was introduced in the text. Second, we prove a lemma which ensures that $\\omega(I^{*},N,K)$ is decreasing in $I^{*}$ (and increasing in $N$ Third, we show that $\\operatorname*{min}\\left\\{I,\\tilde{I}\\right\\}$ is nondecreasing in $\\omega$ and conclude that there is a unique pair $\\{\\omega^{*},I^{*}\\}$ such that $I^{*}=\\operatorname*{min}\\left\\lbrace I,\\widetilde{I}\\right\\rbrace$ and $\\omega^{*}=\\omega\\big(I^{*},N,K\\big).$ This pair uniquely determines the equilibrium relative factor prices and the range of tasks that get effectively automated.  \n\nStep 1: Consider $I^{*},N,$ and $K$ such that $I^{*}\\in(N-1,N).$ Then, $R,W,$ and $Y$ satisfy the system of equations given by capital and labor market-clearing, equations (A3) and (A4), and the ideal price index, equation (A5).  \n\nTaking the ratio of (A3) and (A4), we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\displaystyle{\\int_{I^{*}}^{N}\\gamma(i)^{\\zeta-1}c^{u}\\left(\\frac{W}{\\gamma(i)}\\right)^{\\zeta-\\sigma}W^{-\\zeta}d i}}{\\displaystyle{L^{s}\\left(\\frac{W}{R K}\\right)(I^{*}-N+1)c^{u}(R)^{\\zeta-\\sigma}R^{-\\zeta}}}=\\frac{1}{K}.\n$$  \n\nIn view of the fact that $L^{s}$ is increasing and the function $c^{u}(x)^{\\zeta-\\sigma}x^{-\\zeta}$ is decreasing in $x$ (as it can be verified directly by differentiation), it follows that the left-hand side is decreasing in $W$ and increasing in $R$ . Therefore, (A6) defines an upward-sloping relationshipbetween $W$ and $R$ , which we refer to as the relative demand curve (because it traces the combinations of wage and rental rate consistent with the demand for labor relative to capital being equal to the supply of labor divided by the capital stock).  \n\nOn the other hand, inspection of equation (A5) readily shows that this equation gives a downward-sloping locus between $R$ and $W$ as shown in Figure A1, which we refer to as the ideal price curve.  \n\nThe unique intersection of the relative demand and ideal price curves determines the equilibrium factor prices for given $I^{*},N,$ and $K.$ . Because the relative demand curve is upward-sloping and the ideal price index curve is downward-sloping, there can be at most one intersection. To prove that there always exists an intersection, observe   that $\\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname*{lim}_{x\\rightarrow0}c^{u}(x)^{\\zeta-\\sigma}x^{-\\zeta}\\stackrel{^{.}}{=}\\infty}\\end{array}$ and  that $\\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname*{lim}_{x\\rightarrow\\infty}c^{u}(x)^{\\zeta-\\sigma}x^{-\\zeta}=0.}\\end{array}$ These observations imply that as $W\\to0$ , the numerator of (A6) limits to infinity, and so must the denominator, i.e., $R\\rightarrow0$ . This proves that the relative demand curve starts from the origin. Similarly, as $W\\to\\infty$ , the numerator of (A6) limits to zero, and so must the denominator (i.e., $R\\rightarrow\\infty$ 0. This then implies that the relative demand curve goes to infinity as $R\\to\\infty$ . Thus, the upward-sloping relative demand curve necessarily starts below and ends above the ideal price curve, which ensures that there always exists an intersection between these curves. The unique intersection defines the equilibrium values of $W$ and $R$ , and therefore the function $\\omega(I^{*},N,K)=\\frac{W}{R K}.$  \n\n![](images/6c1c5fae3158a3613d2440a8e89bbd043433850faa10fb138d30ad24c1a04b47.jpg)  \nFIGURE A1. CONSTRUCTION OF THE FUNCTION $\\omega(I^{*},N,K)$  \n\nStep 2: This step follows directly from the following lemma, which we prove in online Appendix B.  \n\nLEMMA Al: Suppose that Assumption $2^{\\prime}$ holds, $K<{\\overline{{K}}}$ and $I^{\\ast}\\leq\\tilde{I}.$ Then $\\omega(I^{*},N,K)$ is decreasing in $I^{*}$ and is increasing in $N.$  \n\nAlthough the general proof for this lemma is long (and thus relegated to online Appendix B), the lemma is trivial under Assumption 2. In that case, equation (A6) yields  \n\n$$\n\\omega(I^{*},N,K)^{\\widehat{\\sigma}}L^{s}(\\omega(I^{*},N,K))=\\frac{\\int_{I^{*}}^{N}\\gamma(i)^{\\widehat{\\sigma}-1}d i}{I^{*}-N+1}K^{1-\\widehat{\\sigma}}.\n$$  \n\nTaking logs, we obtain equation (13) in the main text, which implies that $\\omega(I^{*},N,K)$ is increasing in $N$ and decreasing in $I^{*}$  \n\nStep 3: We now show that $I^{*}=\\operatorname*{min}_{\\sim}\\left\\{I,\\tilde{I}\\right\\}$ is uniquely defined. Because $\\gamma\\big(\\tilde{I}\\big)\\stackrel{*}{=}\\omega K.$ we have that $I^{*}=\\operatorname*{min}\\left\\{I,\\tilde{I}\\right\\}$ is increasing in $\\omega$ and has a vertical asymptote at $I.$  \n\nConsider the pair of equations $\\omega=\\omega\\big(I^{*},N,K\\big)$ and $I^{*}=\\operatorname*{min}\\left\\{I,\\tilde{I}\\right\\}$ plotted in Figure 3. Because $\\omega=\\omega(I^{*},N,K)$ is decreasing in $I^{*}$ for $I^{*}\\stackrel{.}{\\leq}I$ and $I^{*}$ $=\\operatorname*{min}\\{\\tilde{I},\\tilde{I}\\}$ is increasing in $\\omega$ , there exists at most a unique $\\left(\\omega,I^{*}\\right)$ satisfying these two equations (or a unique intersection in the figure).  \n\nTo prove existence, we again verify the appropriate boundary conditions. Suppose that $\\boldsymbol{I}^{*}\\to\\boldsymbol{N}-\\boldsymbol{1}$ . Then from (A3), $R\\rightarrow0$ ,while $W>0$ , and thus $\\omega\\rightarrow\\infty$ This ensures that the curve $\\omega\\left(I^{*},N,K\\right)$ starts above $I^{*}=\\operatorname*{min}\\left\\{I,\\tilde{I}\\right\\}$ in Figure 3. Since $I^{*}=\\operatorname*{min}\\left\\{I,\\tilde{I}\\right\\}$ has a vertical asymptote at $I<N.$ . the two curves must intersect. This observation completes the proof of the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium.  \n\nWhen Assumption 2 holds we can explicitly solve for aggregate output. In this case, the market-clearing conditions, (8) and (9), become  \n\n$$\n\\ell=\\Big(B^{\\widehat{\\sigma}-1}(1-\\eta)\\big(I^{*}-N+1\\big)\\frac{Y}{K}\\Big)^{\\frac{1}{\\sigma}},W=\\Big(B^{\\widehat{\\sigma}-1}(1-\\eta)\\int_{I^{*}}^{N}\\gamma(i)^{\\widehat{\\sigma}-1}d i\\frac{Y}{L}\\Big)^{\\frac{1}{\\widehat{\\sigma}}},\n$$  \n\nwhich combined with (10) yields (12), completing the proof of Proposition 1. 1  \n\nC. Proofs from Section III  \n\nLEMMA A2 (Derivation of Figure 4): Suppose that Assumptions $1^{\\prime}$ and $2^{\\prime}$ hold. Consider a path of technology where $n(t)\\to n$ and $g(t)\\to g$ , consumption grows at the rate $g$ and the Euler equation (17) holds.

Thus, $\\rho+\\delta+\\theta g>w_{I}(n)>w_{N}(n)$ , and for all these values we have $n^{*}=1$ , and no task will be produced with capital.  \n\nTo prove part (iv), note that for $\\rho\\mathrm{~<~}\\rho_{\\mathrm{min}}$ we have  \n\n$$\n\\rho+\\delta+\\theta g<w_{N}(1)<w_{I}(1).\n$$  \n\nThe expressions for $w_{I}^{\\prime}(n)$ and $w_{N}^{\\prime}(N)$ show that, in this region, as $n$ decreases, both $w_{I}(n)$ ， $w_{N}(n)$ increase. Thus, $\\rho+\\delta+\\theta g<w_{N}(n)<w_{I}(n)$ and for these values of $\\rho$ , new tasks do not raise aggregate output.  \n\n# PROOF OF PROPOSITION 4:  \n\nWe prove this proposition under the more general Assumption $2^{\\prime}$  \n\nWe start by deriving necessary conditions on $N(t)$ and $I(t)$ such that the economy admits a BGP, and then show that these are also sufficient for establishing the existence of a unique and globally stable BGP.  \n\nThe capital market-clearing condition implies that  \n\n$$\nc^{u}(R(t))^{\\sigma-\\zeta}R(t)^{\\zeta}\\frac{K(t)}{Y(t)}=B^{\\hat{\\sigma}-1}(1-\\eta)\\left(1-n^{*}(t)\\right).\n$$  \n\nBecause in BGP the rental rate of capital, $R(t)$ , and the capital to aggregate output ratio, $K(t)/Y(t)$ , are constant, we must have $n^{*}(t)=n$ , or in other words, labor and capital must perform constant shares of tasks.  \n\nLemma A2 shows that we have four possibilities corresponding to the four cases in Proposition 4, each of which we now discuss in turn.  \n\n(i) All Tasks Are Automated: $n^{*}(t)\\:=\\:n\\:=\\:0$ . Because in this case capital performs all tasks, Lemma A2 implies that we must have $\\rho<\\overline{{\\rho}}$ and $I(t)=N(t)$ . In this part of the parameter space, net output is given by $A_{K}K$ and the economy grows at the rate e Ak-8-. The ransversality condition, (19), is satisfied if and only if $A_{K}-\\delta>\\frac{A_{K}-\\delta-\\rho}{\\theta}$ -or $r>g$ Moreover, positive growth imposes $A_{K}>\\delta+\\rho$ . The generalized ideal price index condition, equation (A5), then implies that $R=c^{u-1}\\Big(B^{\\frac{1-\\widehat\\sigma}{1-\\sigma}}\\Big)$ , and thus $A_{K}=c^{u-1}\\Big(B^{\\frac{1-\\widehat\\sigma}{1-\\sigma}}\\Big)$ . Under Assumption 2, this last expression further simplifies to $A_{K}=B$ as claimed in the text.  \n\nWe now show that these necessary conditions are sufficient to generate balanced growth. Suppose $\\rho<\\overline{{\\rho}}$ and $I(t)~=~N(t)$ so that $n^{*}(t)~=~0$ . Because all tasks are produced with capital, we also have $F_{L}=0$ , and thus the representative household supplies zero labor. Consequently, the dynamic equilibrium can be characterized as the solution to the system of differential equations  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle{\\frac{\\dot{C}(t)}{C(t)}}=\\frac{1}{\\theta}(A_{K}-\\delta-\\rho)},}\\ {{\\dot{K}(t)=(A_{K}-\\delta)K(t)-C(t)e^{\\nu(0)\\frac{\\theta-1}{\\theta}},}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\ntogether with the initial condition, $K(0)>0$ and the  transversality condition, (19). We next show that there is a unique solution to the system, and this solution converges to the full automation BGP described in the proposition.  \n\nDefine ${\\tilde{c}}=C/K$ . The behavior of $\\tilde{c}$ is governed by the differential equation,  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\dot{\\tilde{c}}(t)}{\\tilde{c}(t)}=\\frac{1}{\\theta}(A_{K}-\\delta-\\rho)-(A_{K}-\\delta)+\\tilde{c}(t)e^{\\nu(0)\\frac{\\theta-1}{\\theta}}.\n$$  \n\nThis differential equation has a stable rest point at zero and an unstable rest point $c_{B}=\\left(A_{k}-\\delta-\\frac{1}{\\theta}(A_{K}-\\delta-\\rho)\\right)e^{\\nu(0)\\frac{1-\\theta}{\\theta}}>0.$ There are thefoe thre posible equilibrium paths for $\\widetilde c(t)$ : (i) it immediately jumps to $c_{B}$ and stays there; (ii) it starts at $[0,c_{B})$ and converges to zero; (ii) it starts at $(c_{B},\\infty)$ and diverges. The second and third possibilities violate, respectively, the transversality condition (19) (because the capital stock would grow at the rate $A_{k}-\\delta$ , implying $r=g,$ ), and the resource constraint (when $\\widetilde c(t)=\\infty,$ . The first possibility, on the other hand, satisfies the transversality condition (since asymptotically it involves $r>g,$ , and yields an equilibrium path. In this path the economy converges to a unique BGP in which $C(t)$ and $K(t)$ grow at a constant rate Ak-8-, thus also establishing uniqueness and global stability.  \n\n(ii) Interior Equilibrium  in  which  Automated Tasks Are  Immediately Produced  with  Capital: $n^{*}(t)=n(t)=n\\in(0,1)$ .Because capital performs all automated tasks, Lemma A2 implies that $n>\\operatorname*{max}\\{\\overline{{n}}(\\rho),\\widetilde{n}(\\rho)\\}$ and $\\dot{N}(t)~=~\\dot{I}(t)$ . Moreover, because in this candidate BGP $R(t)$ is constant, the general form of the generalized ideal price index condition, (A5), implies that $W(t)/\\gamma(I(t))$ must be constant too, and this is only possible if $\\dot{I}(t)=\\Delta$ Consequently, the growth rate of aggregate output is $A\\Delta.$ Finally, the transversality condition, (19), is satisfied given the condition $\\rho+(\\theta-1)A\\Delta>0$ in this part of the proposition. Lemma A2 then verifies that $n^{*}(t)=n>\\overline{{n}}(\\rho)$ .Substituting  the  market-clearing conditions for capital and labor, (A3) and (A4), into (1), (2), and (3) and then subtracting the costs of intermediates, we obtain net output as $F(k,L;n)$ (When Assumption 2 holds, $F(k,L;n)$ is given by the CES aggregate in equation (16)). $F(k,L;n)$ exhibits constant returns to scale, and because factor markets are competitive, we also have $R(t)={\\cal F}_{K}(k(t),L(t);n)$ and $w(t)~=~{\\cal F}_{L}(k(t),L(t);n)$  \n\nTo establish uniqueness, let $w_{B}$ denote the BGP value of the wage rate, $k_{B}$ the BGP value of the normalized capital stock, $c_{B}$ the BGP value of normalized consumption, $L_{B}$ the BGP value of employment, and $R_{B}$ the BGP value of the rental rate of capital. These variables are, by definition, all constant. Then, the Euler equation, (17), implies $R_{B}=\\rho+\\delta+\\theta g$ , and because $R_{B}=F_{K}(k_{B},L_{B};n)$ , we must also have $k_{B}/L_{B}=\\phi$ where $\\phi$ is the unique solution to  \n\n$$\nF_{K}(\\phi,1;n)=\\rho+\\delta+\\theta g.\n$$  \n\nLemma B1 in online Appendix B shows that, for $n>\\operatorname*{max}\\{\\overline{{n}}(\\rho),\\tilde{n}(\\rho)\\},F(\\phi,1;n)$ satisfies the following Inada conditions,  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\phi\\to0}F_{K}(\\phi,1;n)>\\rho+\\delta+\\theta g,\\quad\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\phi\\to\\infty}F_{K}(\\phi,1;n)<\\rho+\\delta+\\theta g,\n$$  \n\nwhich ensure that $\\phi$ is well defined. Combining the labor supply condition, (18), with thereurenstraint, (wetan $\\begin{array}{r}{\\left(F(\\phi,1;n)-(\\delta+g)\\phi\\right)L_{B}=\\frac{F_{L}(\\phi,1)}{\\nu^{\\prime}(L_{B})}}\\end{array}$ The left-hand side of this equation is linear and increasing in $L$ (the concavity of $F$ in $k$ implies that $F(\\phi,1;n)>\\phi F_{K}(\\phi,1;n)>(\\delta+g)\\phi)$ , while the right-hand side is decreasing in $L$ . This ensures that there exists a unique value $L_{B}>0$ that satisfies this equation, and also pins down the value of the normalized capital stock as $k_{B}=\\phi L_{B}$ . Finally, $c_{B}$ is uniquely determined from the resource constraint, (20), as  \n\n$$\nc_{B}=\\left(F(\\phi,1;n)-(\\delta+g)\\phi\\right)L_{B}e^{\\nu(L_{B})\\frac{1-\\theta}{\\theta}}.\n$$  \n\nNote also that there cannot be any BGP with $L_{B}=0$ , since this would imply $c_{B}=0$ from the resource constraint, (20). But then we would have $\\nu^{\\prime}(0)e^{\\frac{\\theta-1}{\\theta}\\nu(0)}<\\frac{F_{L}(\\phi,1;n)}{c_{B}}$ , which contradicts the labor supply optimality condition, (18). Hence, the only possible BGP is one in which $k(t)=k_{B},c(t)=c_{B}$ and $L(t)=L_{B}>0$ . Moreover, in view of the fact that $\\rho+(\\theta-1)A\\Delta=0$ ,this candidate BGP satisfies the transversality condition (19), and is indeed the unique BGP. The proof of the global stability of this unique BGP is similar to the analysis of global stability of the neoclassical growth model with endogenous labor supply, and for completeness, we provide the details in online Appendix B.  \n\n(ii) Interior Equilibrium in which Automated Tasks Are Eventually but Not Immediately  Produced  with  Capital: $n^{*}(t)=\\overline{{n}}(\\rho)>n(t)$ . Because capital does not immediately perform all automated tasks, Lemma A2 implies that $n(t)<\\overline{{n}}(\\rho)$ and $\\rho>\\overline{{\\rho}}$ . Moreover, because $R(t)$ is constant, the ideal price index condition, (A5), implies that $W(t)/\\gamma(I^{*}(t))$ must be constant too. Thus, to generate constant growth of wages we must have $\\begin{array}{r}{\\dot{I}^{*}(t)=\\Delta\\leq I(t)}\\end{array}$ so that the growth rate of the economy is given by $A\\Delta$ Because $n^{*}(t)=\\overline{{n}}(\\rho)$ this also implies that $\\dot{N}(t)~=~\\Delta$ . Finally, the transversality condition, (19), is satisfied in view of the fact that this part of the proposition imposes $\\rho+(\\theta-1)A\\Delta>0$ . The uniqueness and global stability of the BGP follow from an identical arguments to part (ii), with the only modification that ${\\overline{{n}}}(\\rho)$ plays the role of $n$ in the preceding proof.  \n\n(iv) All Tasks Are Always Produced with Labor: $n^{*}(t)=1$ . Because labor performs all tasks, Lemma A2 now implies $\\rho>\\rho_{\\mathrm{max}}$ and $n(t)\\geq1$ , while the ideal price index condition, (A5), imposes that $W(t)/\\gamma(N(t))$ must be constant. Thus, to generate a constant wage, aggregate output and capital growth, we must have $\\dot{N}(t)~=~\\Delta$ ，with $\\rho+(\\theta-1)\\Delta>0$ (where the last condition again ensures transversality). To show sufficiency of these conditions for balanced growth, let $w_{B}$ denote the BGP value of the normalized wage, which is defined by  \n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1}c^{u}(w_{B}/\\gamma(i))^{1-\\sigma}=B^{1-\\hat{\\sigma}}.\n$$  \n\nConsequently, net output is given by $F(k,L;n)=w_{B}\\gamma(N(t)-1)L(t)$ ,and thus depends linearly on labor and is independent of capital. This implies $K(t)=0$ and $C(t)\\:=\\:w_{B}\\gamma(N(t)-1)L(t) $ . The representative household's labor supply condition, (18), implies that in this BGP  \n\n$$\n\\nu^{\\prime}(L(t))=\\frac{w_{B}\\gamma(N(t)-1)}{C(t)}=\\frac{1}{L(t)},\n$$  \n\nwhich uniquely defines a BGP employment  level $L_{B}$ .Becausethis allocation also satisfies the transversality condition (in view of the fact that $\\rho+(\\theta-1)A\\Delta>0$ , it defines a unique BGP. Its global stability follows by noting that starting with any positive capital stock, $K(0)>0$ the representative household chooses zero investment and converges to this path.  \n\nD. Proofs from Section IV  \n\nAll of the results in this section apply and will be proven under Assumption $2^{\\prime}$  \n\nLEMMA A3 (Asymptotic Behavior of the Normalized Value Functions): Suppose that Assumpions $1^{\\prime},2^{\\prime},$ and 4 hod. Let $g=A\\frac{\\kappa_{I}\\kappa_{N}}{\\kappa_{I}+\\kappa_{N}}S$ denote the growth rate of the economy in a BGP.

We then turn to analyzing the stability of interior BGPs.  \n\nPart 1: Characterization of the BGPs with Endogenous Technology: Suppose that $S~<~\\widetilde{S}$ so that Lemma A3 applies. We consider the two cases described in the proposition separately.  \n\n(i) $\\rho<\\overline{{\\rho}}$ : Suppose that $n<\\widetilde{n}(\\rho)$ . As depicted in panel A of Figure 8 and shown in Lemma A3, in this region $\\nu_{I}(n)$ is positive and decreasing in $n$ , and $\\nu_{N}(n)$ is negative and increasing in $n$ . Thus, the only possible BGP in this region must be one with $n(t)=0.$ No interior BGP exists with $n~\\in~(0,\\widetilde{n}(\\rho))$ Proposition 4 shows that for $\\rho<\\overline{{\\rho}}$ , a path for technology with $n(t)=0$ yields balanced growth. Moreover, along this path all tasks are produced with capital, which implies that $V_{I}(t)~=~V_{N}(t)~=~0.$ Thus, a path for technology in which $n(t)=0$ is consistent with the equilibrium allocation of scientists. The resulting BGP is an equilibrium with endogenous technology.  \n\n） $\\rho>\\overline{{\\rho}}$ : Suppose $n(t)\\leq\\overline{{n}}(\\rho)$ . Then, we have $n^{*}(t)=\\overline{{n}}(\\rho)$ and therefore $\\nu_{N}(n)~=~\\nu_{N}(\\overline{{{n}}}(\\rho))$ and $\\nu_{I}(n)~=~\\nu_{I}(\\overline{{{n}}}(\\rho))$ : Moreover, Lemma A3 implies that $\\kappa_{N}\\nu_{N}\\bigl(\\overline{{n}}(\\rho)\\bigr)>\\kappa_{I}\\nu_{I}\\bigl(\\overline{{n}}(\\rho)\\bigr)$ and $\\nu_{I}(\\overline{{n}}(\\rho))~=~\\mathcal{O}(g)$ with $g$ small (again because $S<\\widetilde{S}$ ). Therefore, in this region this region we always have that all scientists will be employed to create new tasks, and thus $\\dot{n}>0$ (and is uniformly bounded away from zero). But this contradicts $n(t)<\\overline{{n}}(\\rho)$ Suppose, instead, that $n(t)>\\overline{{n}}(\\rho)$ . Then, Proposition 4 shows that the economy admits a BGP only if $n(t)~=~n$ . Thus, a necessary and sufficient condition for an interior BGP is (29) in the text. Consequently, each interior BGP corresponds to a solution to this equation in $(\\overline{{n}}(\\rho),1)$ . Lemma A3 shows that at $\\overline{{n}}$ ， $\\kappa_{N}\\nu_{N}({\\overline{{n}}})$ is  above $\\kappa_{I}\\nu_{I}(\\overline{{n}})$ ，and $\\kappa_{I}\\nu_{I}(\\overline{{{n}}})~=~\\mathcal{O}(g)$ Moreover, when $\\kappa_{I}/\\kappa_{N}=0$ , the entire curve $\\kappa_{N}\\nu_{N}(n)$ is above $\\kappa_{I}\\nu_{I}(n)$ As this ratio increases, the curve $\\kappa_{I}\\nu_{I}(n)$ rotates up, and eventually crosses $\\kappa_{N}\\nu_{N}(n)$ at a point to the right of $\\overline{{n}}(\\rho)$ . This defines the threshold $\\underline{{\\kappa}}$ .Above this threshold, there exists another threshold $\\overline{{\\kappa}}$ such that if $\\kappa_{I}/\\kappa_{N}>\\overline{{\\kappa}}$ , there is a unique intersection of $\\kappa_{I}\\nu_{I}(n)$ and $\\kappa_{N}\\nu_{N}(n)$ . (Note that one could have $~{\\underline{{\\kappa}}}~=~{\\overline{{\\kappa}}}.$ ) By continuity, there exists $\\widehat{S}$ such that, the thresholds $\\underline{{\\kappa}}$ and $\\overline{{\\kappa}}$ are defined for all $S~<~\\widehat{S}$ (recall that $g=A\\frac{\\kappa_{I}\\kappa_{N}}{\\kappa_{I}+\\kappa_{N}}S)$ KN S) It then follows that for $S<\\operatorname*{min}\\left\\{\\widetilde{S},\\widehat{S}\\right\\}$ and $\\kappa_{I}/\\kappa_{N}>\\overline{{\\kappa}}$ , there exists a unique BGP, which is interior and satisfies $n(t)=n^{*}(t)=n_{B}\\in(\\overline{{n}},1)$ For $S<\\operatorname*{min}\\left\\{\\widetilde{S},\\widehat{S}\\right\\}$ and $\\underline{{\\kappa}}<\\kappa_{I}/\\kappa_{N}<\\overline{{\\kappa}}\\vert$ (providedthat $\\underline{{\\kappa}}<\\overline{{\\kappa}}$ ),theeconomy admits multiple BGPs with endogenous technology. Finally for $S<\\operatorname*{min}\\left\\{\\widetilde{S},\\widehat{S}\\right\\}$ and $\\kappa_{I}/\\kappa_{N}<\\underline{{\\kappa}},$ the only potential BGP is the corner one with $n(t)=1$ as in part (iv) of Proposition 4. Because $\\kappa_{N}\\nu_{N}(1)>\\kappa_{I}\\nu_{I}(1)$ , this path for technology is consistent with the equilibrium allocation of scientists and provides a BGP with endogenous technology.  \n\nPart 2: Stability, Analysis: The stability analysis applies to the case in which $\\rho>\\overline{{\\rho}}$ ， $S<\\operatorname*{min}\\left\\{\\widetilde{S},\\widehat{S}\\right\\}$ , and $\\kappa_{I}/\\kappa_{N}>\\overline{{\\kappa}}$ . In this case, the economy admits a unique BGP defined by ${\\hat{n}}_{B}\\in\\mathsf{\\Gamma}({\\overline{{n}}}(\\rho),1)$ . We denote by $c_{B},k_{B}$ and $L_{B}$ the values of (normalized) consumption and capital, and employment in this BGP.  \n\n# PROOF OF GLOBALSTABILITY WHEN $\\theta=0$  \n\nBecause $\\theta=0$ , we also have $R=\\rho+\\delta$ , and capital adjusts immediately and its equilibrium stock only depends on $n$ , which becomes the unique state variable of the model.  \n\n![](images/69ac9bed40763cc0f84a4bb951378ef941049cacd890d31cf671fdb14ea9aab1.jpg)  \nFIGURE A2. PHASE DIAGRAM AND GLOBAL SADDLE PATH STABILITY WHEN $\\theta=0$  \n\nNotes: The figure plots the locus for $\\dot{\\nu}=0$ and the locus for $\\dot{n}=0$ The uniqueBGP is located at their interception.  \n\nLet $\\nu=\\kappa_{I}\\nu_{I}-\\kappa_{N}\\nu_{N}.$ Now  starting  from  any $n(0)$ ,  an equilibrium  with endogenous technology is given by the path of $(n,\\nu)$ such that the evolution of the state variable is given by  \n\n$$\n\\dot{n}=\\kappa_{N}S-(\\kappa_{N}+\\kappa_{I})G(\\nu)S;\n$$  \n\nand the evolution of the difference of the normalized value functions, $\\nu$ satisfiesthe forward-looking differential equation  \n\n$$\n{}\\nu-\\dot{\\nu}=b\\kappa_{I}(c^{u}(\\rho+\\delta)^{\\zeta-\\sigma}-c^{u}(w_{I})^{\\zeta-\\sigma})-b\\kappa_{N}(c^{u}(w_{N})^{\\zeta-\\sigma}-c^{u}(\\rho+\\delta)^{\\zeta-\\sigma})+\\odot(g)\n$$  \n\ntogether with the transversality condition (27) holds.  \n\nWhen $g=0$ , the locus for $\\dot{\\nu}=0$ crosses zero from below at a unique point (recall that we are in the parameter region where there is a unique BGP).

Figure A2 presents the phase diagram of the system in $(\\nu,n)$ . The locus for $\\dot{\\nu}=0$ crosses $\\nu=0$ at $n_{B}$ from below only once.

The laws of motion of the two variables, $\\nu$ and $n$ , take the form shown in the phase diagram.34 This implies the existence of the unique stable arm, and also establishes that there are no equilibrium paths that are not along this stable arm. In particular, all paths above the stable arm feature $\\dot{\\nu}>0$ and eventually $n\\rightarrow0$ and $\\nu~\\to~\\infty$ , and since $\\nu_{N}$ is positive, $\\nu_{I}\\to\\infty$ .

  "md_Agrawal - 2012 - Corporate governance objectives of labor union shareholders Evidence from proxy voting": {
    "reference_markdown": "# Corporate Governance Objectives of Labor Union Shareholders: Evidence from Proxy Voting  \n\nAshwini K. Agrawal New York University, Stern School of Business Labor union pension funds have become increasingly vocal in governance matters; however, their motives are subject to fierce debate. I examine the proxy votes of AFL-CIO union funds around an exogenous change in the union representation of workers across firms. AFL-CIO-affliated shareholders become significantly less opposed to directors once the AFL-CIO labor organization no longer represents a firm's workers. Other institutional investors, including mutual funds and public pension funds, do not exhibit similar voting behavior. Union opposition is also associated with negative valuation effects. The data suggest that some investors pursue worker interests, rather than maximize shareholder value alone. (JEL J51, G30, G32, G34, G38, K22)  \n\nLabor union pension funds, particularly those affiliated with the AFL-CIO, have come under scrutiny for their proxy votes in corporate director elections. Critics argue that union pension funds use their votes to pursue worker interests under the guise of increasing shareholder value. For example, in response to the AFL-CIO's calls to overhaul Safeway's board in 2004, Safeway Vice President Brian Dowling claimed:  \n\nUnion leadership has threatened to attack Safeway CEO Steve Burd and individual members of Safeway's board as a pressure tactic to get better results during labor negotiations, and these union-backed pension funds are carrying through on that threat.  \n\n-Safeway Proxy Materials, March 25, 2004  \n\nUnion leaders, however, counter that their main goal is to protect pension assets:  \n\nIrresponsible directors must beremoved to rein in excessive CEO pay that ultimately robs working families of their retirement security.  \n\n-Richard Trumka, AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer, Press Release, April 15, 2004  \n\nEmpirically distinguishing among the potential motivations of institutional investors, such as union pension funds, is complicated because worker gains are often in line with equity value gains. The identification of shareholder preferences requires a setting in which institutional investors’ labor interests vary independently of factors that affect shareholder value.  \n\nThis article exploits a natural experiment to test whether the proxy votes of union pension funds, an important class of institutional investors, are motivated by union labor interests rather than equity value maximization alone. In 2005, the AFL-CIO (the central federation of labor unions in the United States) split into two groups due in part to power struggles within its leadership (Chaison 2007). The AFL-CIO membership significantly contracted when several of its member unions left to form a new organization—called the Change to Win (CTW) Coalition. Consequently, the union affiliation of workers across many companies immediately switched from the AFL-CIO to the CTW. I examine the effects of this change on the proxy votes cast by AFL-CIO-affiliated pension funds at annual director elections of U.S. corporations before and after the breakup of the AFL-CIO organization. I compare the funds' votes at firms where workers become significantly less represented by the AFL-CIO with the funds’ votes at firms where worker affiliations remain unchanged.  \n\nCanonical finance theory typically assumes that shareholders only care to maximize equity value (Shleifer and Vishny 1988). A growing literature in corporate governance, however, examines heterogeneity in the objectives of various institutional investors. For example, a number of papers examine whether mutual funds suffer from agency costs of monitoring and conflicts of interest when casting proxy votes in director elections (Rothberg and Lilien 2006; Davis and Kim 2007; Matvos and Ostrovsky 2010). Others study whether public pension funds pursue political objectives at the expense of shareholder value (Romano 1993; Del Guercio and Hawkins 1999; Woidtke 2002). In contrast, this article focuses on labor union pension funds, an important group of institutional investors that is widely considered the most vocal class of shareholder activists (Gillan and Starks 2000, 2007).2  \n\nThere is mixed theoretical and empirical evidence on the motives and behavior of labor union pension funds, and in particular, whether these funds use their proxy votes to pursue union labor objectives. On the one hand, Romano (2001), Bainbridge (2006), and Anabtawi and Stout (2008) argue that union pension funds cast their proxy votes in part to pursue worker objectives, rather than maximize shareholder value alone. On the other hand, Schwab and Thomas (1998) claim that union pension funds do not have the incentives to pursue such goals because of market forces and regulatory restrictions; they argue that federal rules (ERISA) governing union pension fund activities limit the ability of fund managers to use pension assets for the pursuit of nonshareholder value-maximizing objectives. Consistent with this view, Prevost, Rao, and Williams (2009) and Martin and Thomas (1998) examine union-sponsored shareholder proposals and conclude that union activists do not use their shareholdings to pursue labor interests.  \n\nThis article evaluates the competing theories by presenting a novel empirical approach that uniquely identifies the preferences and impact of labor union shareholders. When a firm's unionized employees are no longer represented by the AFL-CIO, the AFL-CIO's pension funds become significantly less opposed to the firm's directors in subsequent board elections. The observed changes are especially pronounced among firms that experience plantlevel conflict between unions and management during union member recruitment and collective bargaining. In contrast, the voting behavior of the AFLCIO funds does not change at firms where workers remain affiliated with the AFL-CIO or at firms in which there are no unionized employees at all. These findings suggest that union pension funds cast proxy votes in part as a means of pursuing union labor objectives, rather than maximizing shareholder value alone.  \n\nThe causal interpretation of these findings is dependent upon the identifying assumption that changes in employee-union affiliation are independent of simultaneous, unobservable changes in factors that affect shareholder value (such as director quality). This assumption is supported by a number of facts. First, numerous accounts indicate that the breakup of the AFL-CIO labor organization stemmed from personal conflicts among the federation's leaders, and that the labor group's reorganization was unrelated to the characteristics of sample directors and firms held by the union pension funds (Chaison 2007). Second, I do not find any significant differences in observable variables, such as balance sheet measures or governance characteristics of firms whose workers stay in the AFL-CIO and firms whose workers switch to the CTwCoalition.  \n\nThird, I compare the AFL-CIO funds’ proxy votes with the votes cast by other large institutional investors: the mutual funds Fidelity, Vanguard, and TIAA-CREF and the public pension fund CalPERS. If there are endogenous, unobservable changes occurring at the director level, then other institutional shareholders, who have incentives to monitor these developments and maximize shareholder value, should vote accordingly.3 The evidence indicates, however, that mutual fund and public pension funds do not change their votes around the breakup of the AFL-CIO. Therefore, it is unlikely that there are endogenous changes, occurring at the director level, that drive the AFL-CIO's votes.  \n\nI also examine the voting behavior of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America (UBCJA) labor union pension funds. UBCJA pension funds uniformly cast proxy votes, and the aggregate size of their holdings studied in this article is on the order of $\\$20$ billion. The UBCJA, which was previously independent of the AFL-CIO, joined the CTW Coalition on its inception in 2005. After joining the coalition, the UBCJA's funds increase their opposition to directors of firms that employ CTW employees by at least $22\\%$ . This evidence not only further supports the identification assumption but also suggests that the effects of worker representation on director votes are more generally consistent with the behavior of union pension funds.  \n\nI also evaluate alternative explanations for the voting behavior of AFL-CIO funds. First, I find that union voting estimates do not appear to be biased by stock selection decisions. Turnover in the AFL-CIO fund holdings does not significantly change around union reorganization. Furthermore, the findings are robust to a restricted sample of firms that appear in the AFL-CIO portfolios both before and after the CTW formation. Second, regression estimates reject the hypothesis that changes in the AFL-CIO's votes reflect changes in private information engendered by the union breakup. Third, I show that union voting patterns are not driven by underlying changes in shareholder monitoring incentives; the results are robust to the inclusion of controls for investor monitoring activity. Fourth, I find evidence that voting estimates are not biased by reverse causality.  \n\nI then estimate the various effects of union pension fund votes on firm behavior and performance. I show that AFL-CIO opposition has a noticeable impact on election outcomes. Directors who are opposed by union funds realize significantly less aggregate support. Union disapproval appears to be costly for shareholders; firms facing reduced opposition experience significantly large increases in equity value. In contrast, pension fund opposition seems to benefit union workers by reducing the frequency of labor-management disputes during union recruiting and collective bargaining. Overall, the data illustrate ways that unions benefit from pension fund activism, even when it leads to negative effects on shareholder value.  \n\nThis article makes several contributions. The study complements a growing literature on institutional investors by presenting a novel empirical approach that identifies the preferences and effects of union shareholder activists. The findings also add to the current reform debate over shareholder access to director election ballots (Bebchuk 2005; Harris and Raviv 2010). While union pension funds may be acting in the best interests of their pension participants, some argue that giving more powers to such investors could lead to reductions in total surplus for all stakeholders.  \n\nThe article proceeds as follows. Section 1 provides institutional background, while Section 2 describes the data. Section 3 presents the empirical framework, results, and analysis. Section 4 concludes.  \n\n## 1. Institutional Background  \n\nDuring the early 1900s, the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) were the two preeminent labor groups in the United States. In 1955, they merged to form the AFL-CIO, representing almost all organized workers in the American private sector. The AFL-CIO currently comprises many of the major unions in the United States, such as the United Auto Workers, United Steel Workers, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, etc. Each member union of the AFL-CIO has local chapters that represent employees at different workplaces. The AFL-CIO is the governing body of the unions and coordinates worker representation across the national landscape.  \n\nLabor unions engage in two types of activities that are governed by the U.S. National Labor Relations Boards (NLRB): collective bargaining (negotiating compensation and employment conditions with employers) and union member recruiting. Each of these functions is often a source of conflict between firms and labor organizations. A common collective-bargaining dispute arises when an employer refuses to recognize union representatives when setting wages for its workers, as in the recent case of Shaw's Supermarkets (National Labor Relations Board 2007). Another typical dispute arises when unions attempt to recruit nonrepresented laborers into their organizations, as recent turmoil at Wal-Mart illustrates (Greenhouse 2007). When such conflicts cannot be privately resolved, a labor union or a firm may file a complaint with the NLRB, citing an Unfair Labor Practice (ULP). The NLRB will in turn mediate between the various parties to develop a resolution in accordance with federal law.4  \n\nWhile the regulations governing labor unions have remained in place since the 1930s, the size and structure of unions have changed over time. Since its peak in 1954 at approximately 25 million workers or $39.2\\%$ of theU.S. workforce, the number of organized laborers has declined to 15.4 million or  \n\n$12\\%$ of the U.S. workforce in 2006 (Congressional 1993; Bureau of Labor Statistics 2007). In addition to declining membership, there has been more recently a shift in union organization. On September 27, 2005, six of the largest member groups of the AFL-CIO (Teamsters, United Food and Commercial Workers, Service Employees International, UNITE HERE, United Farm Workers, and the Laborers International Union of North America) formed their own organization—the CTw Coalition—and consummated an exit from the AFL-CIO. Approximately $35\\%$ of the 13 million workers in the AFL-CIO switched to the CTW. The workers remained unionized and mostly subject to the collective-bargaining agreements that were previously in place with their respective employers. The main impact of the union reorganization on these workers is that they now fell under the umbrella of a different national entity.  \n\nAccounts of the union's dissolution center around two explanations, each of which is corroborated by Chaison (2007). The most common account is that the CTW union leaders were locked in an irreconcilable power struggle with then-current AFL-CIO President John Sweeney. Sweeney even remarked, \\*\"The fact is that the real issue for these unions is not one of policy or direction, but rather who controls and leads the Federation\"(AFL-CIO 2005). A second explanation is that the CTW unions had a different organizational and strategic vision for the future of the labor movement. The CTW Coalition believed that the AFL-CIO focused too much of its resources on electoral politics, rather than on the organization of new workers. Teamsters President James Hoffa went so far as to say that the AFL-CIO is content with “\"throwing away money to politicians” (Edsall 2005). In either case, the explanations are supportive of this article's central identification assumption: The AFL-CIO's reorganization appears unrelated to the particular characteristics of unionized companies that could affect shareholder value.  \n\nThe source of exogenous variation in the union representation of workers makes union pension fund behavior a natural setting in which to examine different preferences among shareholders. Union pension funds comprise contributions made by both union workers and their employers. Approximately $46\\%$ of all union pension assets are invested in domestic equities as of September 30, 2006 (Appell 2007). Ownership of voting shares in a U.S. publicly traded company gives shareholders the right to cast votes in the company's corporate elections. Like mutual funds and public pension funds, union funds will act as a “proxy” for individual pension fund participants and cast votes on their behalf, hence the term proxy voting.  \n\nThere are thousands of union pension funds with various sources of capital, such as independent laborers like contractors, electricians, plumbers, etc., and corporate employees of blue-chip companies. Though union funds range widely in size and sources of capital, many funds affiliated with the same umbrella organization synchronize their proxy voting decisions by employing a third-party fiduciary to administer their votes. These fiduciaries cast votes in consultation with the head officers of the umbrella labor organization under which the individual union funds are associated, such as the AFL-CIO Office ofInvestment.5  \n\nMarco Consulting, one of the largest proxy voting services in the United States, is an example of one such third-party fiduciary (G.A.O. 2007). During the sample period studied in this article, Marco Consulting follows proxy voting guidelines established by the AFL-CIO and uniformly casts proxy votes across hundreds of AFL-CIO-affiliated union pension funds, including the ones studied in this article. For example, in a director election for Boeing, Marco Consulting casts identical votes for all AFL-CIO-affiliated funds it manages that hold Boeing shares. According to Marco Consulting, the aggregate size of AFL-CIO-affiliated pension funds that invest in the firms studied in this article is on the order of $\\$100$ billion in assets. ProxyVote Plus is another fiduciary that manages proxy votes for numerous pension funds belonging to the UBCJA. Proxy Vote Plus also communicates with union fund officials and uniformly votes across many UBCJA pension funds. According to ProxyVote Plus, the aggregate size of the UBCJA holdings studied in this article is on the orderof $\\$20$ billion in assets.  \n\nThe AFL-CIO's role in corporate elections is noteworthy for several reasons. AFL-CIO union pension funds are some of the most involved shareholder activists, among all classes of investors that participate in elections (Gillan and Starks 2007). In 2006, union funds submitted 295 out of 699 shareholder plans at U.S. publicly traded corporations, while public pension funds issued thirtyone proposals and mutual funds issued twenty-three resolutions. The two most prolific issuers of union shareholder plans accounted for more than half of all union proposals: The AFL-CIO submitted twenty-eight, primarily through the funds examined in this article, while the UBCJA submitted 120 (Burr 2007).  \n\nAlthough AFL-CIO funds comprise a small fraction of the shares in publicly traded corporations, their activism is perceived to have a strong impact on corporate directors and firm value. For example, at Safeway's May 20, 2004, shareholder meeting, investors withheld $17\\%$ of their votes from appointing CEO Steven Burd to the board of directors. Although he successfully gained a seat, labor union shareholders claimed victory, citing their pressure on management as a leading factor in the board's eventual decision to appoint a new lead independent director, remove two individuals from its audit and executive compensation committees, and eliminate three members of the board (Adamy 2004). Other examples of union pension funds targeting boards of directors include Verizon, CVS/Caremark, and Toll Brothers (Tse 2007).  \n\nThe AFL-CIO is also in the middle of debate with regard to various financial market regulations. It has influenced the passage of recent reforms on mutual fund proxy voting disclosure, board independence, and outside auditors, all of which are considered favorable reforms for labor union shareholders (AFLCIO 2003; Cai, Garner, and Walkling 2009). More recently, the AFL-CIO has played an active role in promoting greater shareholder access to corporate ballots (Trumka 2003). On August 25, 2010, the SEC passed Rule 14(a)-11, which allows shareholders to nominate their own directors in corporate elections. While labor union activists support proposals that further increase shareholder powers, others argue that special-interest parties (singling out AFL-CIO pension funds) would use their improved position to pursue worker interests at the expense of outside investors (McKinnell 2003; Wall Street Journal, November 27,2006).  \n\n## 2. Data  \n\n### 2.1 Proxy votes and firm characteristics  \n\nI collect annual data from the AFL-CIO Office of Investment on the equity holdings of the AFL-CIO Reserve Fund and the AFL-CIO Staff Retirement Fund from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2006. The capital invested in these two funds, which are approximately $\\$180$ million in size, are partially contributed by direct staff employees of the AFL-CIO.6 The proxy votes cast by these funds (herein referred to as AFL-CIO funds) are noteworthy for two reasons. First, the funds serve as the main vehicles for the AFL-CIO's shareholder activism. The AFL-CIO uses its ownership stakes via fund holdings to issue many of its activist shareholder proposals $(\\mathrm{Burr}2007\\$ 0. Additionally, the proxy votes for these holdings serve as voting recommendations made to other investors. Second, through Marco Consulting, the votes cast for these portfolios are representative of the votes of AFL-CIO-affiliated union pension funds, whose aggregate holdings are on the order of $\\$100$ billion in size; the sample of votes is therefore highly representative of the total population of union pension fund votes.  \n\nAcross all firms in the two funds, I observe the shareholder elections in which the AFL-CIO funds participate. For each election, I observe all ballot items, such as individual director nominees, recommendations made by the board of directors, and votes cast by the AFL-CIO funds. For numerous director elections, the nominees’ names are missing. To complete the data, I refer to the original proxy statements for each firm on the SEC Edgar website. Several companies’ proxy statements are not available online; their filings are obtained from their respective investor relations departments.  \n\nPanels A and B of Table 1 contain descriptive statistics of the sample shareholder elections and proxy votes of the AFL-CIO funds. There are a total of 504 firms that hold director elections at least once in the sample period, for a total of 1,492 elections. On average, there are approximately seven director nominees standing for election at each company, which yields a total sample of  \n\nTable 1 Proxy voting summary statistics   \nPanel A:AFL-CIO Director Election Statistics   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Firms (total) 504</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Elections (total)</td></tr><tr><td>Elections (avg. per yr.)</td><td colspan=\"2\">1,492 373</td></tr><tr><td>DirectorNominees (total)</td><td colspan=\"2\">10,407</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Director Nominees (avg. per election)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Panel B:AFL-CIOElectionBallotItems andVotingStatistics</td></tr><tr><td>DirectorNominees</td><td>Number of Items 10,407</td><td>% Support 65</td></tr><tr><td>Auditor Approvals</td><td>1,332</td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td>ShareholderProposals:</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>SeparateCEOand Chairman</td><td>88</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>Declassify Board</td><td>145</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>Poison Pill GoldenParachute</td><td>75 55</td><td>61 52</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Panel C:Institutional InvestorDirectorVotingStatistics</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Number of Votes</td><td>% Support</td></tr><tr><td>Fidelity Spartan Total Market Index Fund</td><td>7,501</td><td>98</td></tr><tr><td>VanguardInstitutionalTotalStockMarketIndexFund</td><td>7,949</td><td>89 93</td></tr><tr><td>TIAA-CREFInstitutionalEquityIndexFund CalPERSPensionFund</td><td>7,805</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>9,503</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>UBCJA Pension Funds</td><td>4,515</td><td>55</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table presents descriptive statistics that summarize the sample shareholder elections and proxy voting behavior of various institutional investors. Panel A depicts the AFL-CIO funds’ firm holdings and director elections in which they cast proxy votes. Firms (total) is the total number of firms held by the AFL-CIO funds in which the union funds participate in shareholder elections from Jan. 2003 to Dec. 2006. Elections (total) is the total number of shareholder elections in the sample. Director Nominees (avg. per election) is the average number of directors up for election at any given shareholder meeting. Panel B summarizes the AFL-CIO funds’ voting behavior across director elections and auditor approvals, and also presents the number of shareholder proposals and aggregate shareholder support for each. Panel C summarizes the matched director votes of each institutional investor with the AFL-CIO funds’ director votes. In both Panels B and C, Number of votes is total number of sample votes cast during for each proposal type and $\\%$ Support is the percentage of institutional investor votes cast in favor of board vote recommendations to shareholders.  \n\n10,407 directors over four years. Director elections are the most frequent ballot items in shareholder meetings. Boards recommend that shareholders vote in favor of all board-appointed director nominees. However, the AFL-CIO supports only approximately $65\\%$ of all candidates in the sample.  \n\nI also obtain the proxy votes cast by three mutual fund families: Fidelity, Vanguard, and TIAA-CREF. I collect their proxy votes from SEC N-PX flings for July 1, 2003-December 31, 2006. Within each mutual fund family, I choose an individual index fund that holds a broad array of securities: the Fidelity Spartan Total Market Index Fund, the Vanguard Institutional Total Stock Market Index Fund, and the TIAA-CREF Equity Index Fund. For each director nominee for which the AFL-CIO funds cast a vote in the sample, I record the matching vote cast by each of the index funds. As Panel C of Table 1 indicates, I am able to match the votes for approximately $75\\%$ of all director nominees for each investor from July 2003 and onward.  \n\nI directly collect proxy voting data for the CalPERS pension fund from the CalPERS Investment Office. I am able to match 9,503 director votes from the AFL-CIO sample with the CalPERS data. Additionally, I obtain proxy voting data for the UBCJA labor union pension funds for their S&P 500 investments from August 5, 2004, to December 31, 2006, from ProxyVote Plus. The votes analyzed for UBCJA funds in the sample correspond to holdings on the order Oof $\\$20$ billion in aggregate size. I am able to match 4,515 director votes from the AFL-CIO sample with the UBCJA sample. The relatively low match rate is due to the limited time period for which director-level data are available and because of differences in holdings.  \n\nI also gather data on shareholder proposals and election outcomes. These data are extracted from SEC filings for sample firms (typically the proxy statement and the most recent 10-Q following the annual shareholders’ meeting). For each election, I obtain the aggregate votes cast for sample directors. I am able to collect votes for approximately 9,521 sample directors.7 For each sample shareholder proposal, I observe a description of the proposal and the number of votes that were cast for and against the proposal. I categorize the most frequently appearing proposals into one of four groups: separate CEO and Chairman, Board Declassification, Poison Pill, and Golden Parachute. Descriptive statistics concerning the frequency and support for these proposals are presented in Panel B of Table 1.  \n\nThe vast majority of sample firms are in the S&P 500. Table 2 presents descriptive statistics tabulated from Compustat (where available) with regard to the firms held in the AFL-CIO's funds, along with S&P 500 attributes for comparison.8 Assets is the book value of assets. Equity is the market value of outstanding equity. Leverage is the ratio of long-term debt to book value of equity. EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Capital Intensity is the ratio of PPE (net plant, property, and equipment) to assets. As of 2005, the average sample firm has $\\$54.4$ billion worth of assets, while the average S&P 500 firm has assets worth $\\$48.4$ billion. The average number of employees of sample firms is 48.3 thousand, while it is 46.5 thousand for S&P 5o0 companies. Capital Intensity is measured to compare the production technologies across firms. The average ratio of PPE to assets is 0.26 in the sample (0.24 for S&P 500 firms). There are no statistically significant differences between the balance-sheet characteristics of sample firms and S&P 500 firms. Moreover, the distribution of industries of sample firms mirrors that of the S&P 500. Sample firms have some statistics that are slightly higher in magnitude than S&P 5o0 companies, which are caused by the inclusion of several large international firms that have U.S. publicly traded stock but are not members of the S&P 500, such as Magna International and Honda Motor Co.  \n\nTable2 Characteristics of firmsheld byAFL-CIOfunds(2003-2006)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>AFL-CIO holdings</td><td>S&P500</td></tr><tr><td>Assets</td><td>54.35 (3.19)</td><td>48.36</td></tr><tr><td>Equity</td><td>24.75</td><td>(6.61) 23.50</td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td>(0.83) 0.84</td><td>(1.75) 0.92</td></tr><tr><td>Sales</td><td>(0.07) 16.97</td><td>(0.20) 15.98</td></tr><tr><td>EBITDA</td><td>(0.60) 3.48</td><td>(1.35) 3.39</td></tr><tr><td>CapitalIntensity</td><td>(0.14) 0.26</td><td>(0.32) 0.24</td></tr><tr><td>Employees</td><td>(0.00) 48.28</td><td>(0.01) 46.54</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1.87)</td><td>(4.57)</td></tr><tr><td>Industry (2 digit SIC)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0-20 2140</td><td>10.4%</td><td>9.6%</td></tr><tr><td>41-60</td><td>37.4%</td><td>39.6%</td></tr><tr><td>61-99</td><td>28.3%</td><td>27.4%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>23.8%</td><td>23.4%</td></tr><tr><td>TotalNumber ofSampleFirms</td><td>504</td><td>500</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table presents descriptive statistics that summarize the characteristics of all sample firms held by the AFLCIO funds from 2003 to 2006 and the S&P 500. Data are as of the end of 2005 from Compustat, where available. Assets (USsbillion) is the book value of assets. Equity (Us\\$billion) is the market value of outstanding equity. Leverage (US\\$billion) is the ratio of long-term debt to book value of equity. EBITDA (US\\$billion) is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Capital Intensity is the ratio of $P P E$ (net plant,property, and equipment, in USSbillion) to Assets. Employees (thousand) is the number of employees. Industry (two-digit SIC) refers to industry grouping based on the two-digit SIC code of firms. It is the number of firms belonging to particular industry, as a percentage of total firms in the AFL-CIO fund holdings or the S&P 500 used to calculate descriptive statistics for balance-sheet information. Standard errors are reported in parentheses.  \n\nFinally, I collect data on governance characteristics of sample firms and industries. I obtain data on corporate control transactions, specifically merger and acquisition activity, from SDC Platinum, for all sample industries. For each industry to which a sample firm belongs, I calculate the total number of mergers that take place each year from 2003 to 2006. I also collect data on poison pills and board characteristics, such as individual insider/outsider status, board classification, and size, from Risk Metrics and Board Analyst. When sample directors do not appear in these databases, I supplement the data with information from firms’ proxy statements and 10-Q's where possible. Institutional ownership data are obtained from Thomson-Reuters Institutional Holdings Database, which aggregates investor holdings from SEC 13F filings.  \n\n### 2.2 Firms’ employee-union labor relations  \n\nI collect data on the union affiliations of domestic workers involved in collective-bargaining activity at each of the sample firms held by the AFL-CIO funds from a variety of publicly available sources. The primary sources of data have been utilized by previous researchers (Dinardo and Lee 2004; CutcherGershenfeld and Kochan 2004; Gomez and Tzioumis 2006). Firm-level data on employee unionization is hand collected because there is currently no centralized, publicly available database that contains systematic information on firms’ employee-union affiliations.  \n\nThe primary source is the U.s. Department of Federal Mediation and Conciliatory Services (FMCS), a division of the U.S. Department of Labor. The FMCS maintains a monthly listing of F-7 notices, available through a Freedom of Information Act request. Unions are required to file F-7 notices with the FMCS thirty days prior to the expiration of an existing collective-bargaining agreement. Using F-7 notices from January 2003 to December 2006, I collect all filings in which any union cites an expiring bargaining agreement with a firm in the sample.9 It is possible that some firms have agreements with unions that do not expire in the sample period, although most collective-bargaining contracts last for approximately 3-5 years. It is also possible that some firms or unions are noncompliant with FMCS notification laws, leading to downward bias in union representation (see Dinardo and Lee 2004 for a related discussion).  \n\nI also consult various other sources of data. I inspect individual 10K's filed in 2006 for each sample company.10 Firms often mention specific labor union activity in 10K's when it is significant. Many companies also explicitly state that none of their employees belong to a union or are subject to a collectivebargaining agreement. I examine the National Labor Relations Board union elections and petitions data from January 2001 to December 2006, which contain records of all union elections and petitions that take place at any corporation in the United States during this period.1l For each firm in the sample, I also search the U.S. Department of Labor's public database of voluntarily provided collective-bargaining agreements. I also contact the investor relations departments of several companies with unionized employees. Using these data sources, I identify whether firms have any unionized workers involved in collective bargaining and, if so, to which unions they belong. Although these data are potentially subject to measurement error, it is likely that errors are restricted to firms in which union presence is minor (such as those with downward bias in union representation) and are unlikely to affect the estimation results. Furthermore, it is likely that this measurement error causes voting pattern estimates to suffer from attenuation bias and understate the true impact of union labor interests on proxy voting.  \n\nUsing all sources, I categorize firms as belonging to one of three groups.12 First, there are 258 nonunionized firms (e.g., Microsoft), which do not have any unionized workers in my sample. Second, there are 181 firms whose main unionized workers in the sample maintain association with the AFL-CIO throughout the entire sample period (e.g., Ford Motor Company, whose workers mostly belong to the United Auto Workers union). Herein these firms are referred to as AFL-CIO firms. Third, there are sixty-five firms whose primary unionized employees switch from the AFL-CIO to the CTW Coalition in 2005 (e.g., Costco, where most union workers are in Teamsters unions). Herein these firms are referred to as CTw firms.  \n\n### 2.3 Employer-union labor strife  \n\nI collect data on plant-level disputes between firm management and labor unions that result in the filing of unfair labor practice charges with the U.S. National Labor Relations Board.13 The agency maintains data on all NLRA violation (ULP) charges filed by both firms and labor unions. Each charge is assigned a docket number that specifies the labor union and firm involved in the dispute, the section of the NLRA in question, the filing date, and the location of the conflict. I collect all dockets involving each firm in the sample, from January 1, 2002, to December 31, 2007. Because the majority of dockets cite the specific sections of the NLRA in dispute, I am able to categorize conflict as belonging to at least one of two groups. First, I define collective bargaining confict as any charge filed by labor unions against firms in violation of Section 8(a)(5) of the NLRA. Section 8(a)(5) states that employers cannot refuse to bargain collectively with employee representatives. Second, I define unionization conflict as any charge issued by firms against labor unions in violation of Section 8(b)(1)(A) of the NLRA. Section 8(b)(1)(A) stipulates that labor unions cannot coerce employees into either joining or avoiding a labor union. See Appendix 2 for a more detailed description of each section of the NLRA and the data-collection process.  \n\nTable 3 contains descriptive statistics summarizing the charges of unfair labor practices at sample firms. I define strife at a firm as a binary indicator of whether there is any unfair labor practice charge related to collective bargaining or union member recruiting involving the firm in a given year. As illustrated in Panel A, there are a total of ninety-four AFL-CIO firms that experience unionization conflict in 2002, while there are twentynine CTW firms that experience unionization disputes in 2002.14 Similarly, in 2002 there are sixty-five AFL-CIO firms involved in collective-bargaining strife, while there are twenty-five CTW firms involved in bargaining conflicts (Panel B).  \n\nTable3 Labor relations and unfair labor practices at firms held by AFL-CIOfunds   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>AFL-CIO</td><td>CTW</td><td>Full Sample</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Panel A:Unionization Conflict</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Firms with>OStrife</td><td>94</td><td>29</td><td>129</td></tr><tr><td>(52%)</td><td>(45%)</td><td>(26%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Firms with OStrife</td><td>87</td><td>36</td><td>375</td></tr><tr><td>(48%)</td><td>(55%)</td><td>(74%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Panel B: Collective Bargaining Conflict</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Firms with>OStrife</td><td>65</td><td>25</td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>(36%)</td><td>(38%)</td><td>(18%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Firms with OStrife</td><td>116</td><td>40</td><td>412</td></tr><tr><td>(64%)</td><td>(62%)</td><td>(82%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Panel C:All Conflict</td></tr><tr><td>Correlation ofconflictmeasures</td><td>0.444</td><td>0.563</td><td>0.593</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Panel D:Pre-Sample andWithin-Sample Conflict Correlation</td></tr><tr><td>Unionization</td><td>0.897</td><td>0.846</td><td>0.844</td></tr><tr><td>Collective Bargaining</td><td>0.694</td><td>0.784</td><td>0.730</td></tr><tr><td>All Conflict</td><td>0.497</td><td>0.696</td><td>0.627</td></tr><tr><td>Total Firms</td><td>181</td><td>65</td><td>504</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table presents descriptive statistics summarizing labor-management relations and Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) charges at all sample firms.Each column refers to all firms within a particular group—AFL-CIO is the set of AFL-CIO firms, CTW is the set of CTW firms, and Full Sample refers to all firms in the sample.Panels A and B summarize pre-sample (2002) unionization and collective bargaining ULP charges, respectively. Firms $w i t h>(=)0S t r i f e$ is the number of firms with more than (exactly) 0 ULP charges of each type in 2002. Percentages of total firms within each group are indicated in parentheses. Panel C summarizes the correlation between CollectiveBargaining and UnionizationULP charges in 2002.Correlation of conflict measures is the correlation of collective bargaining and unionization ULP charge indicators at the firm level. Panel D summarizes correlations between 2002 and annual within-sample (2003-2006) measures of labor-management conficts; \"All Confict\" refers to within-sample correlations of collective bargaining and unionization only. Total Firms is the total number of sample firms in each group.  \n\nThere are several important facts presented in the table. First, there does not appear to be any significant difference between the likelihood of observing a unionization or collective-bargaining dispute at any given firm associated with either the AFL-CIO or the CTW Coalition, as the percentages of sample firms with conflict are similar across groups. Second, as Panel C indicates, the two types of disputes characterize relatively distinct groups of firms, since the correlation measures of both types of conflicts are below O.6 for each set of unionized firms. This figure suggests that the two types of unfair labor practices provide wide coverage of labor-management relations across sample firms. Third, pre-sample measures of unfair labor practices accurately capture the overall frequency of disputes that arise between labor unions and management; as Panel D illustrates, the time-series correlation between ULP's in 2002 and each sample year from 2003-2006 is quite high (above 0.84 for unionization strife and above 0.69 for collective-bargaining strife). It is also worth noting that the distribution of unfair labor practices in each sample year is similar to that of 2002; the median number of labor union-management disputes is zero each year.  \n\n## 3. Analysis  \n\n### 3.1 Natural experiment design and sample  \n\nAlthough there is significant variation in the AFL-CIO's labor relations across firms, the companies where union affiliations change are remarkably similar to firms where worker affiliations remain constant. Table 4 contains statistics that describe firms held by the AFL-CIO funds at the end of 2004 and 2005, i.e., around the breakup of the labor organization. Each column contains mean characteristics of firms grouped by affiliations of their unionized workers.  \n\nIn Panel A, columns 1 and 2 indicate that in 2005 there are 140 sample firms whose unionized workers belong to the AFL-CIO during the entire sample period and fifty-three sample firms whose workers switch from the AFLCIO to the CTW.

AFL-CIO fund firms are categorized into three groups—Nonunion firms, AFL-CIO firms, and CTW firms. Panel A contains balancesheet characteristics. Equity (\\$Bil) is the market value of outstanding equity. Capital Intensity is the ratio of $P P E$ (net plant, property, and equipment, in US\\$billion) to book value of assets (US\\$billion). ROA is the ratio of EBITDA to market value of assets, where market value of assets is the sum of book value of assets plus the market value of equity,minus the sum of book-valued equity and deferred taxes.Employees is the total number of employees (thousands). Asset growth is the ratio of book value of assets in current year to previous year. Two-digit SIC refers to percentage of each column's firms in each two-digit SIC industry group. Standard errors are in parentheses. Panel B contains governance characteristics. Mergers is the mean number of mergers across sample industries. Poison Pill (Classified Board) is the fraction of sample firms with a poison pill (classified board). Insider Fraction is the fraction of the board that is composed of insiders, Board Size is the total number of board members, and Institutional Holdings is the fraction of shares outstanding that are held by institutional investors.Standard deviations are in parentheses.  \n\napproximately $\\$32$ billion, while the average market capitalization of CTW firms is $\\$23$ billion. Both types of unionized firms have similar production technologies, as measured by capital intensity (the ratio of PPE to assets is around $31\\%$ ). In each year, there are no significant differences in the number of employees, ROA, or asset growth between AFL-CIO firms and CTW firms. The average changes in these firm characteristics from 2004 to 2005 are also statistically indistinguishable between the two types of firms. Nonunion firms tend to be larger in size than unionized companies, though this difference is to be expected, since nonunionized firms include banks and insurance companies. Panel B contains statistics that describe the sample firms’ governance characteristics around the formation of the CTW Coalition and shows that there are no significant differences in these traits across firms or across time for any subset ofcompanies.  \n\nAlthough fundamentally untestable, this article's identification assumption is supported by the sample descriptive statistics in Table 4. Along many observable dimensions, AFL-CIO firms are similar to CTW firms before and after the formation of the CTw Coalition. To the extent that these dimensions are correlated with unobservable firm and director characteristics, it is unlikely that there are significant, endogenous disparities between the two types of unionized firms. Moreover, it is worth noting that differences in firm characteristics across the two groups per se do not invalidate the identifying assumption, if these characteristics are uncorrelated with variables that impact proxy votes (such as director quality).15  \n\n### 3.2 Changes in AFL-CIO voting behavior  \n\nFigure 1 and Table 5 (Panel A) depict the voting behavior of the AFLCIO funds across three groups of firms: nonunionized companies, AFLCIO firms, and CTW firms. Each pair of columns shows the percentage of votes cast against directors within each group of companies before and after the formation of the CTW Coalition.16 The AFL-CIO votes against approximately $31\\%$ of all directors at nonunionized companies, while it votes against approximately $44\\%$ of all AFL-CIO firms. Within each group of firms, the voting patterns are similar before and after the formation of the CTW Coalition. However, the cross-sectional differences in voting patterns between nonunion and AFL-CIO are statistically significant. The disparity suggests that the AFL-CIO funds’ director votes are affected by the AFL-CIO's labor relations.  \n\nThe rightmost columns of Figure 1 illustrate the significant changes in AFLCIO votes for directors of CTW firms. Prior to the formation of the CTW Coalition, the AFL-CIO funds vote against $45\\%$ of all director nominees. The voting patterns of the AFL-CIO funds at CTW firms prior to September 27, 2005, mirror the funds’ contemporaneous voting patterns at other AFL-CIO firms. However, after the union realignment, the AFL-CIO funds vote against Only $29\\%$ of all directors at CTW firms.  \n\n![](images/f30aa30c4ec21a9221218e762dfe748e4861c598ecacbb5115cd179f74b39dfe.jpg)  \nFigure1 AFL-CIO funds’director votes as a function of firm worker-union affiliation This figure illustrates AFL-CIO funds’ votes for directors across all sample firms. Each pair of columns represents the percentage of AFL-CIO fund votes withheld from directors across three groups of firms ( $\\%$ against directorsgivenon $y$ -axis). The leftmost pair represents firms whose workers are not unionized, the middle pair portrays AFL-CIO-firms, and the rightmost pair depicts CTW-firms. “Before” and “After\"’ refer to the time periods surrounding the breakup of the AFL-CIO. Solid colored (striped) columns are for directors of firms whose workers are (not) primarily affiliated with the AFL-CIO at the time of the election.  \n\nTo control for additional factors that may explain the changes in voting, I estimate the following OLS linear probability model (results in Table 5, Panel B):  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{V o t e M g t_{i j t}=\\alpha+\\beta_{I}(C T W_{j}\\times P o s t_{t})+\\beta_{2}(C T W_{j})+\\beta_{3}(P o s t_{t})}\\ &{\\quad\\quad+\\beta_{4}(U n i o n_{j})+\\beta_{4}(U n i o n_{j}\\times P o s t_{t})+\\beta_{5}(S t o c k R e t u r n_{j t})}\\ &{\\quad\\quad+\\beta_{6}(S t o c k R e t u r n_{j t}\\times P o s t_{t})+\\beta_{7}(Y e a r_{t})+\\beta_{8}(F i r m_{j})}\\ &{\\quad\\quad+\\beta_{9}(G o\\nu e r n a n c e_{i j t})+\\varepsilon_{i j t},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nTable5 Effects of firm-union relations on AFL-CIO funds’ director votes   \nPanel A: Difference-in-Difference Analysis   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Pre-Period</td><td>Post-Period</td><td>Difference</td></tr><tr><td>AFL-CIO</td><td>0.429 (0.009)</td><td>0.443</td><td>-0.014</td></tr><tr><td>CTW</td><td>0.452 (0.016)</td><td>(0.015) 0.287 (0.022)</td><td>(0.024) 0.165*** (0.038)</td></tr><tr><td>Difference</td><td>0.024 (0.025)</td><td>0.156 (0.037)</td><td>-0.179*** (0.062)</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n(continued)  \n\nTable5 Continued   \nPanel B: Regression Analysis   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>VoteMgt</td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td><td>(7)</td></tr><tr><td>CTW x Post</td><td></td><td>-0.179** (0.081)</td><td>-0.144** (0.063)</td><td>-0.138** (0.063)</td><td>-0.141** (0.069)</td><td>-0.140** (0.069)</td><td>-0.137** (0.065)</td></tr><tr><td>CTW</td><td></td><td>0.024 (0.045) -0.001</td><td>0.097</td><td></td><td>0.098</td><td>0.105</td><td>0.098</td></tr><tr><td>Post Union</td><td>0.111***</td><td>(0.036) 0.114***</td><td>(0.086)</td><td>0.064 (0.086)</td><td>(0.086)</td><td>(0.088)</td><td>(0.087)</td></tr><tr><td>Union × Post</td><td>(0.024)</td><td>(0.032) 0.015</td><td>0.036</td><td>0.036</td><td>0.055</td><td>0.060</td><td>0.037</td></tr><tr><td>Stock Return</td><td></td><td>(0.061)</td><td>(0.046)</td><td>(0.046) 0.007</td><td>(0.050)</td><td>(0.051)</td><td>(0.048)</td></tr><tr><td>Stock Ret.x Post</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.017) -0.086*</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Log(Mergers)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.051)</td><td>0.031</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Poison Pill</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.042) 0.201***</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Classified Board</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.067)</td><td>0.091* (0.054)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Insider Director</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.123*** (0.014)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>SH Proposal</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>-0.018 (0.037)</td></tr><tr><td>Inst.

Panel A presents the fraction of votes cast against directors of firms that employ union workers primarily affiliated with either the AFL-CIO or the CTW Coalition (rows) before and after the formation of the CTW Coalition (columns). “Difference\" refers to the differences in mean votes by row or column. The bottom, rightmost cell contains the differencein-difference estimate of proxy votes against directors. Standard errors are in parentheses.

StockRetu $n_{j t}$ is the market-adjusted stock return for firm $j$ over the year preceding time $t$ ,normalized by the standard deviation of the stock's past annual excess returns. $U n i o n_{j}=1$ (0) if firm has (no) unionized workers in either the AFL-CIO or CTW Coalition. Year and firm fixed effects are denoted by $Y e a r_{t}$ and $F i r m_{j}$ ,respectively. Governance $\\mathrm{\\ddot{1}\\dot{1}t}$ refer to various controls: Log(Mergers)jt is the log number of mergers in year $t$ for firm $j$ s industry, Poison $\\mathrm{Pi}\\mathrm{ill}_{\\mathrm{jt}}$ and Classified $\\mathrm{Board}_{\\mathrm{jt}}=1$ (O) if firm $j$ in year $t$ has a poison pill and classified board, insider directorjt $\\doteq1$ (0) if nominee $i$ is an insider at firm $j$ in year $t$ $\\mathbf{\\nabla},\\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{proposal}_{\\mathbf{j}\\mathrm{t}}=1$ (0) if frm $j$ receives a shareholder proposal that wins majority support in year $t$ election, Inst.

Standard errors, reported in parentheses, are heteroscedasticity-robust and clustered by election.  \n\nwhere subscripts ijt uniquely identify individual observations for nominee $i$ ， firm $j$ , and time : $t.~V o t e M g t_{i j t}$ is a binary indicator for whether the AFL-CIO votes against firm $j$ 's management's recommendation for director $i$ at time $t$ $C T W_{j}$ is an indicator for whether firm $j$ 's unionized workers switch from the AFL-CIO to the CTW Coalition. $P o s t_{t}$ indicates whether the election at time $t$ takes place after the formation of the CTw Coalition. Union $j$ is an indicator for whether firm $j$ has any unionized workers at all. StockReturnjt is calculated as the market-adjusted stock return for firm $j$ over the year preceding time $t$ , normalized by the standard deviation of the stock's historical annual excess returns.17 Year and firm fixed effects are denoted by $Y e a r_{t}$ and $F i r m_{j}$ , respectively. A variety of additional governance-related control variables, Governanceijt, are also included. Standard errors are robust to heteroscedasticity and clustered by election.18  \n\nColumn 1 indicates that on average, AFL-CIO funds are $11\\%$ more likely to vote against directors of unionized firms than nonunionized firms. Column 2 presents the difference-in-difference estimate $(\\beta_{1})$ of the effect of labor relations on AFL-CIO fund votes in director elections for the full sample of firms. The estimate of -0.179 indicates that the AFL-CIO funds become $17.9\\%$ more supportive of director nominees of CTw firms after the formation of the CTw Coalition. The statistically insignificant estimates for CTW and Post further suggest that the treatment effect is not simply the result of changes in general voting policies across all firms or time periods.  \n\nColumn 3 adds year and firm fixed effects, and column 4 adds stock return covariates in order to control for changes in stock performance.19 Columns $^{5-}$ 7 feature controls for various governance characteristics. Across all specifications, the data indicate that AFL-CIO funds are at least $14\\%{-}18\\%$ more likely to vote for a firm's director nominees once the AFL-CIO no longer represents the firm's unionized workers. The stable estimates of the main interaction term across all columns suggest that the AFL-CIO fund votes are not changing solely in response to changes in firms’ governance or performance characteristics.  \n\n3.3 Voting behavior of other institutional investors 3.3.1 Mutual funds and public pension funds. The identification assumption that is central to the causal interpretation of the findings is supported by comparison of the AFL-CIO funds with other large institutional investors. Mutual funds are large shareholders that have incentives to monitor the directors of firms in their portfolios and cast proxy votes to maximize equity value.20 If there are unobservable changes occurring at the firm or director level that are correlated with changes in worker-union affiliation, then mutual funds should exhibit changes in voting patterns similar to those of the AFL-CIO. I estimate specification (1) using the votes for each of three mutual fund family index funds: the Fidelity Spartan Total Market Index Fund, the Vanguard Institutional Total Stock Market Index Fund, and the TIAA-CREF Equity Index Fund. These funds are chosen because of their broad stock coverage and because the voting patterns for these funds are representative of the votes cast by other funds in the same families (Rothberg and Lilien 2006).  \n\nIn Table 6, for each mutual fund I present two sets of regression estimates, each corresponding to the two leftmost columns of Table 5, Panel B. First, columns 1, 3, and 5 indicate that mutual funds are on average and in contrast to the AFL-CIO funds more likely to vote for directors of firms with unionized workers. This finding suggests that unionization is not associated with low director quality. Second, as indicated in columns 2, 4, and 6, none of the three mutual funds significantly alter their director votes in response to changes in worker-union representation. Moreover, the findings are robust to the exclusion of union firms from the sample and to the inclusion of other controls for stock performance, firm characteristics, etc., following the specifications of Table5.  \n\nI also examine the votes cast by CalPERS, the world's largest public pension fund, which is known for its corporate governance activism (Smith 1996; Nesbitt 1994; Wu 2004). If CalPERS monitors directors more closely than mutual funds, then CalPERS proxy votes should illustrate any changes in director quality that accompany changes in union-worker affiliation. Column 7 of Table 6, however, indicates that CalPERS does not provide a differential amount of support for directors of unionized firms than directors of nonunionized firms. Furthermore, column 8 shows that CalPERS does not significantly alter its director votes in response to changes in worker-union representation.  \n\nIf the change in the AFL-CIO funds’ voting behavior at CTW firms is a shareholder value maximizing response to changes occurring at the firm or director level within those CTW companies, then it is reasonable to expect mutual funds and public pension funds to vote in a similar manner. However, the data indicate that other institutional investors do not vote like the AFLCIO; they are more likely to vote for directors of unionized firms, and they do not alter their voting patterns in response to changes in the AFL-CIO's internal organization. These patterns suggest that there are no simultaneous, unobservable changes in firm or director characteristics affecting equity value, which is consistent with the empirical strategy's central identification assumption.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>-0.235*** 0.133** 0.217* (0.124) (0.073) (0.064) 0.000 (10) UBCJA CalPERS 0.043</td></tr><tr><td>0.419*** (0.067) 0.083 (0.096) (0.046) 343 0.493*** -0.081* (0.045) (0.033) 343</td></tr><tr><td>-0.165*** 0.240*** 0.048 (0.046) 0.049 (0.032) (0.021) 0.034 (0.022) 0.038 (0.033) (0.015) 487 9,503</td></tr><tr><td>0.018 (0.016) 487 9,503 E</td></tr><tr><td>-0.049** 0.098*** (0.050) 0.040 (0.033) 0.038 (0.023) (0.021) 0.045 (0.037) (0.016) 460 7,785</td></tr><tr><td>0.084*** -0.026 (0.016) (0.012) 460 7,785</td></tr><tr><td>0.085*** -0.112*** -0.091*** 0.185*** 0.046** (0.035) (0.028) (0.018) (0.018) (0.023) (0.014) 467 7,949</td></tr><tr><td>-0.054*** 0.142*** (0.013) (0.010) 467 7,949</td></tr><tr><td>0.017** -0.005 (0.014) -0.011 (0.008) 0.007 (0.012) -0.009 (0.013) (0.007) 455 7,433</td></tr><tr><td>0.012*** 0.003 (0.007) (0.004) 455 7,433</td></tr><tr><td>Union x Post Sample Firms #of Firms Constant #of Obs Union Post</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n  \nd+(Iso uou)sg+(uou)g+(Iso)g+(M)g+(su× MI)g+=wa d s u  1 = y ! ()  \n\n3.3.2 Union pension funds outside the AFL-CIO. I also compare the AFLCIO funds’ voting behavior with the votes cast by union pension funds that are not associated with the AFL-CIO. The United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, which was independent of the AFL-CIO from 2001 to 2005, joined the CTW Coalition at its 2005 inception. The UBCJA manages many affiliated local chapter funds and uniformly casts proxy votes across their holdings.  \n\nColumns 9-10 of Table 6 present the UBCJA fund voting estimates from specification (1). VoteM $\\lbrace t_{i j t}$ is now an indicator for whether the UBCJA funds vote for nominee $i$ in firm $j$ at time $t$ .21 Column 9 indicates that UBJCA funds are $8.1\\%$ more likely to support directors of unionized firms than support directors of nonunionized firms. Column 10 indicates that UBCJA pension funds become $21.7\\%$ more opposed to director nominees of CTW after the UBCJA joins the CTW Coalition. The estimates in columns 9 and 10 are robust to the inclusion of year and firm fixed effects and stock performance controls.  \n\nThe UBCJA funds’ behavior further supports the identification assumption that changes in firm-union affiliation are not correlated with unobservable changes in director quality. When the UBCJA begins affiliating with union workers of CTW firms, the UBCJA pension funds become significantly more opposed to director nominees at these companies. If anything, the findings suggest that the preferences of the AFL-CIO may more generally reflect the objectives of other union pension funds.  \n\n### 3.4 Impact of plant-level conflict between labor unions and management on voting  \n\nI estimate the impact of plant-level disputes between labor unions and management on AFL-CIO pension fund votes, using the following OLS linear probability model:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}{V o t e M g t_{i j t}=\\alpha+\\beta_{I}(S t r i f e_{j}\\times C T W_{j}\\times P o s t_{t})+\\beta_{2}(C T W_{j}\\times P o s t_{t})}&{}&\\ {+\\beta_{3}(C T W_{j}\\times S t r i f e_{j})+\\beta_{4}(S t r i f e_{j}\\times P o s t_{t})+\\beta_{5}(S t r i f e_{j})}&{}&\\ {+\\beta_{6}(C T W_{j})+\\beta_{7}(P o s t_{t})+\\beta_{8}(U n i o n_{j})+\\beta_{9}(U n i o n_{j}\\times P o s t_{t})}&{}&\\ {+\\beta_{I O}(U n i o n_{j}\\times S t r i f e_{j})+\\beta_{I I}(U n i o n_{j}\\times S t r i f e_{j}\\times P o s t_{t})}&{}&\\ {+\\beta_{I2}(S t o c k R e t u r n_{j t})+\\beta_{I3}(S t o c k R e t u r n_{j t}\\times P o s t_{t})}&{}&\\ {+\\beta_{I4}(Y e a r t)+\\beta_{I5}(F i r m_{j})+\\varepsilon_{i j t},}&{}&{(2.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere subscripts ijt uniquely identify individual observations for nominee $i$ firm $j$ ,and time $t$  \n\nI define two unique proxies for labor strife at the firm level. Strife $j$ (unionization) is a binary indicator of whether any Unfair Labor Practice charges were raised by firm $j$ against a labor union for unlawful attempts at strengthening union membership at firm $j$ in 2002. Strife $j$ (collective bargaining) is a binary indicator of whether any Unfair Labor Practice charges were filed by a labor union against firm $j$ for refusing to bargain collectively with worker representatives in 2002. Firms where $S t r i f e=1$ experience a greater frequency of conflict between labor unions and managers than do firms where $S t r i f e=0$ both before and during the sample period, as discussed in Section 2.3. Data on charges from 2002, as opposed to data from the sample years 2003-2006, are used to more plausibly satisfy the added identification assumption that measures of labor strife are independent of unobservable firm or director characteristics that are correlated with shareholder value and hence proxy votes during the sample years.22 All other covariates in specification (2) remain as defined in specification (1).  \n\nTable 7 presents estimates of unionization strife on the AFL-CIO funds’ director votes. The univariate regression of column 1 shows that the AFL-CIO funds are $17.7\\%$ more likely to vote against directors at firms with unionization conflict in 2002 than at firms with no such disagreements. While this estimate suggests that the AFL-CIO funds have workers’ interests in mind when proxy voting (they may vote against directors to express disapproval at management's interference with union recruiting efforts), this figure could also reflect the AFL-CIO funds’ desire to limit labor conflict that they believe is value-decreasing (they may use their votes to hasten the removal of directors who allow costly disputes to occur at the firm).  \n\nTo distinguish these two hypotheses, columns 2-5 present estimates of how the sensitivity of proxy votes to labor strife changes at firms whose workers join the CTw Coalition $(\\beta_{1})$ . If union-management confict is costly to investors and the AFL-CIO is solely interested in maximizing shareholder value, then the union affiliation of workers involved with management disputes should not matter. However, the null hypothesis that $\\beta_{1}$ is zero is rejected by the data. Columns 2-3 indicate that the impact of changing union affiliation is especially strong when the sample of firms is restricted to companies characterized by labor strife. The treatment effect estimates of union affiliation range between $-0.310$ and $-0.330$ . Columns 4-5 (approximately) compare the treatment effect estimates of changing union affliation on AFL-CIO proxy votes for subsamples of high- versus low-strife firms. An increase in unionization strife at a firm is associated with a higher probability of voting against  \n\nTable7 Effects of management-labor conflict on AFL-CIO votes   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>VoteMgt</td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td></tr><tr><td>StrifexCTWxPost</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>-0.326***</td><td>-0.315**</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">CTWxPost</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.125)</td><td>(0.125)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-0.311**</td><td>-0.330***</td><td>-0.002</td><td>-0.001</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(0.13)</td><td>(0.083)</td><td>(0.093)</td><td>(0.093)</td></tr><tr><td>StrifexPost</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.257</td><td>0.249</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.192)</td><td>(0.190)</td></tr><tr><td>Union x Post</td><td></td><td></td><td>-0.109</td><td>0.023</td><td>-0.022</td></tr><tr><td>Unionx Strife</td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.201)</td><td>(0.054)</td><td>(0.054)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Union x Strife x Post</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.095</td><td>-0.092</td></tr><tr><td>Strife</td><td>0.177***</td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.206)</td><td>(0.203)</td></tr><tr><td>CTW</td><td>(0.032)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>0.020</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Post</td><td></td><td>(0.070)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>0.093</td><td>0.079</td><td>0.089</td><td>0.061</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(0.080)</td><td>(0.249)</td><td>(0.086)</td><td>(0.086)</td></tr><tr><td>Constant</td><td>0.335***</td><td>0.507***</td><td>0.835***</td><td>0.282***</td><td>0.279***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.013)</td><td>(0.042)</td><td>(0.163)</td><td>(0.087)</td><td>(0.088)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Firm Fixed Effects</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Year Fixed Effects</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Sample Firms</td><td>All</td><td>Union</td><td>All</td><td>All</td><td>All</td></tr><tr><td>Strife =1</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>#of Observations</td><td>10,407</td><td>2,263</td><td>2,298</td><td>10,407</td><td>10,390</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n\\*\\*， $^{**}$ , and $^*$ denote significance at the $1\\%$ ， $5\\%$ , and $10\\%$ levels, respectivel   \nThis table presents the regression results of AFL-CIO proxy votes for director nominees as a function of labor strife at the plant level and union-firm workers’ affiliations.

Standard errors, reported in parentheses, are heteroscedasticity-robust and clustered by election.  \n\nthe firm's directors; however, when the firm's workers disaffiliate from the AFL-CIO, the probability of voting against directors decreases by $32\\%{-}33\\%$ In other words, the impact of worker-union affliation on AFL-CIO proxy votes is particularly relevant for firms where management-worker relations aretenuous.  \n\nSimilar results are found for collective-bargaining conflicts.23 The AFLCIO funds are $13.9\\%$ more likely to vote against directors at firms involved in collective-bargaining disputes than for nominees at firms without comparable disagreements. When the sample of firms is restricted to companies with conflict involving contract negotiations, the impact of changing labor relations on AFL-CIO proxy votes is particularly strong. The AFL-CIO funds become at least $21\\%$ more likely to support directors of such firms where workers switch union affiliation from the AFL-CIO to the CTw Coalition.  \n\nUsing two distinct measures of management-labor conflict, I find that the AFL-CIO funds vote against directors more often when unions are involved in disputes with management. However, these voting patterns do not appear to reflect shareholder value-maximizing behavior, as the opposition to directors is primarily limited to firms in which the AFL-CIO represents workers. Instead, the AFL-CIO voting behavior is consistent with the hypothesis that the AFLCIO funds oppose directors in part as a means of supporting union workers who face opposition from management during collective bargaining and union recruiting efforts.  \n\n### 3.5 Alternative hypotheses  \n\n3.5.1 Portfolio selection bias.  One alternative explanation for the findings is that the AFL-CIO funds’ voting behavior could simply result from the endogenous stock selections by the AFL-CIO. For example, in response to the changes in the AFL-CIO's structure, it is possible that the AFL-CIO funds choose to invest in CTW firms, where it is value-maximizing to support directors differentially more than previous years’ holdings. I address this hypothesis in several ways. First, I note that there are likely indexing constraints imposed on fund investment policies that mitigate the extent to which coefficient estimates are overstated due in part to selection bias. A number of papers find that pension funds, including public pension funds that do not solely aim to maximize shareholder value, are typically indexed (Woidtke 2002). As Table 2 indicates, similar to other pension funds, the vast majority of sample companies in the AFL-CIO holdings are members of the S&P 500, which suggests that indexing is relevant for union pension funds. Furthermore, Appell (2007) finds that the vast majority of all union pension funds associated with the AFLCIO are primarily invested in S&P 500 firms.  \n\nSecond, I examine AFL-CIO holdings from 2003 to 2007 and find little evidence of significant portfolio turnover around the breakup of the AFL-CIO. In results not reported here, I find that the stockholdings of neither AFL-CIO firms nor CTw firms significantly fuctuate in the immediate years following the AFL-CIO's reorganization, relative to earlier or later years; the fractions of either type of firm being added or dropped from the portfolios range between $1\\%$ and $9\\%$ across all years. Third, I estimate specifications (1) and (2) for a subsample of firms that appear in the AFL-CIO's portfolio in 2005 and 2006. The results are robust for this sample. Fourth, I note that even if there are changes in the composition of the portfolios, these changes do not necessarily engender new voting patterns; as discussed earlier, institutional investors, such as mutual funds and public pension funds, do not alter their votes as do the AFL-CIOfunds.  \n\nI also explore whether changes in union director votes could be explained by changes in union fund ownership levels of the sample firms. I back out approximate changes in union pension fund holdings by measuring changes in aggregate institutional investor holdings.24 As Panel B of Table 4 indicates, there are no significant changes in institutional ownership levels of sample firms around the breakup of the AFL-CIO. Additionally, Iinclude controls for institutional ownership levels to the main regression specification of Panel B of Table 5 and find that estimates of the main interaction term remain unchanged. Overall, it does not appear that there are significant changes in turnover or ownership levels of union pension funds around the formation of the CTW Coalition, which suggests that the observed changes in AFL-CIO union fund proxy voting cannot be explained by portfolio selection bias.  \n\n3.5.2 Asymmetric information.  Another alternative explanation of the evidence is that the union reorganization caused the AFL-CIO funds to lose private information on director attributes after they stopped associating with workers of CTW firms. This hypothesis, however, is not supported by the triple difference estimates of the voting effects of labor strife and union relations. First, measures of labor strife in 2002 are unlikely to be correlated with changes in information that occurred in 2005. Second, instances of labor strife during collective bargaining and union recruitment are public knowledge. Third, the coefficient of $C T W\\times P o s t$ in columns 4-5 in Table 7 indicates that the average effect of changing union affiliation is statistically insignificant. If the findings were driven by information changes, rather than by worker interests, this coefficient should be significantly negative, while the coefficient of $S t r i f e\\times C T W\\times P o s t$ should be zero. The contrary evidence implies that the votes reflect worker interests, rather than changes in private information.  \n\n3.5.3 Monitoring incentives.A third alternative explanation for the evidence is that the AFL-CIO funds faced changes in monitoring incentives around the formation of the CTW Coalition. For example, firms with common union affliation may simply be firms where the benefits of monitoring outweigh the free-rider problem that is relevant to most small shareholders (Grossman and Hart 1980). I test this hypothesis in several ways. First, I include controls in specification (1) for shareholder proposal activity; proposals are more likely to appear at firms where shareholders have incentive to monitor management. If there are changes in monitoring incentives for shareholders of firms where worker-union affiliations change, then controlling for shareholder proposals should attenuate treatment effect estimates. In contrast to this hypothesis, however, as illustrated in Panel B and column 7 of Table 5, the inclusion of shareholder proposal controls does not impact the magnitude or significance of the main interaction term.  \n\nSecond, as discussed in Section 3.5.1, there do not appear to be any significant changes in union ownership levels around the formation of the CTW Coalition, and controlling for institutional ownership does not attenuate coefficient estimates. Finally, I note that if there are general changes in shareholdermonitoring incentives that affect proxy votes, these changes should be manifest in the voting patterns of other institutional investors, such as mutual funds, public pension funds, and union pension funds, outside the AFL-CIO. The absence of institutional investor vote changes, however, suggests that monitoring incentives are not changing for shareholders of CTW firms.  \n\n#### 3.5.4 Endogenous timing of AFL-CIO fund voting and CTW formation.  \n\nA fourth alternative explanation for the evidence is that the AFL-CIO was simply becoming more supportive of CTw firms over time and the formation of the CTW was driven by the changing attitude of the AFL-CIO's leaders toward the management of firms with CTW employees. This hypothesis, however, is not supported by the data. There is no pre-period trend in the AFL-CIO voting patterns for CTW firms; in 2003 and 2004, the AFL-CIO funds vote against directors of CTw firms approximately $50\\%$ of the time in each year. Starting in 2005, however, when confict begins to arise among union leaders within the AFL-CIO, the AFL-CIO becomes significantly more supportive of directors of CTW firms (Chaison 2007). Moreover, the UBCJA's increased opposition toward CTW firm directors suggests that union pension fund support for directors is an effect, rather than a cause, of changing worker affliations.  \n\n### 3.6 Impact of AFL-CIO fund voting  \n\n3.6.1 Election outcomes. If union pension fund opposition is large enough, then directors who face such disapproval should receive lower aggregate shareholder support than do directors who are approved by union funds. I test this hypothesis by comparing the aggregate support for directors who receive differential support from AFL-CIO union pension funds. The findings are presented in Table 8.  \n\nConsistent with this hypothesis, I find that for the entire sample, directors opposed by the AFL-CIO union pension funds receive $93.49\\%$ support, whereas directors supported by unions receive $96.06\\%$ support. The differences in aggregate support are particularly noticeable for unionized firms, firms experiencing conflict between labor unions and management, and firms with below-median institutional holdings: Across all subsamples, the differences in aggregate support are at least $2.3\\%$ and highly statistically significant. The findings illustrate that directors who face union pension fund opposition receive less aggregate support in elections. Since the AFL-CIO union pension funds cast coordinated proxy votes and maintain assets on the order of $\\$100$ billion in size, it is perhaps not surprising that union pension fund holdings are large enough to have tangible effects on election outcomes (O'Connor 2000).  \n\nTable8 AFL-CIO proxy votes and aggregate director support   \nPanel A: Aggregate Director Support   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">DirectorSubsample</td><td colspan=\"2\">AFL-CIO Opposes:</td><td colspan=\"2\">AFL-CIOSupports:</td><td colspan=\"2\">Difference:</td></tr><tr><td>Aggregate Support (%)</td><td>Std.

Director Subsample refers to the sample of directors that is analyzed in each row. The second (third) main column, AFL-CIO Opposes (Supports), refers to directors within each sample that are Opposed (Supported) by AFL-CIO union pension funds. Within each of these main columns, the aggregate shareholder support received by each subsample of directors is presented, along with standard errors and sample size. The fourth main column presents the difference in aggregate support between the subsamples of directors facing disparateAFL-CIOsupport.  \n\nI also find that the reduction in AFL-CIO opposition to directors of CTW firms leads to significant changes in aggregate support for directors of CTW firms. Prior to the AFL-CIO breakup, the aggregate level of support for directors of CTW firms is approximately $93.9\\%$ . In contrast, after the breakup of the AFL-CIO, directors of CTW firms face less aggregate opposition; the average director receives $95.9\\%$ support from all shareholders. In contrast, there are no statistically significant changes in the levels of aggregate support for directors of AFL-CIO firms and nonunion companies. These findings imply that the changes in AFL-CIO union pension fund votes have a significant impact on total levels of shareholder support realized by directors of CTW firms.  \n\nA number of papers find evidence that even small percentage changes in director support have tangible effects on firm behavior and performance. Grundfest (2003) claims that symbolic votes spur directors to action through negative publicity and embarrassment. Cai, Garner, and Walkling (2009) find that even though aggregate support is above $90\\%$ for the vast majority of U.s.  \n\npublic firm directors, director opposition impacts CEO compensation and governance mechanisms. Fischer et al. (2009) show that director opposition is associated with value-increasing management and board turnover. Additionally, Del Guercio, Seery, and Woidtke (2008) find that vote-no campaigns against directors lead to CEO turnover and increased operating performance.  \n\n3.6.2 Shareholder value. To estimate the valuation impact of union pension fund voting, I conduct event-study analysis, using the empirical framework of Becht et al. (2009). If AFL-CIO union pension fund opposition to directors has a negative impact on shareholder value, then firms no longer facing such opposition should experience positive abnormal returns around the formation of the CTW Coalition. This prediction is motivated by the fact that directors of CTW firms realize greater aggregate support once they are no longer opposed by the AFL-CIO pension funds. The positive impact of reduced management opposition by union pension funds should be especially strong for firms experiencing conflict between management and unionized labor, where union pension funds exhibit the strongest opposition toward directors in order to pursue union labor objectives. Union funds should also have greater impact at firms where there is less institutional ownership and hence ostensibly less monitoring by other shareholders.  \n\nConsistent with these hypotheses, Table 9 illustrates the negative valuation effects of union pension fund opposition to directors. Each panel of Table 9 contains mean and median cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) for specific subsamples of firms in various windows around the formation of the CTw Coalition. Panel A includes all sample firms whose workers switch from the AFL-CIO to the CTW Coalition. The average one-day abnormal return for these firms is highly positive and statistically significant at $0.50\\%$ . This estimate does not revert to zero; in fact, the CAR persists and increases to $0.76\\%$ when the event window is expanded to seven days around formation of the CTw Coalition.  \n\nPanels $\\scriptstyle\\mathbf{B}\\mathrm{-K}$ break down these returns into more detail. Panel B indicates that the positive CAR of the entire sample is specifically driven by firms where the AFL-CIO union pension funds oppose directors (i.e., vote against at least one director): The one-day average abnormal return is $0.49\\%$ , the three-day CAR is $0.52\\%$ , and the seven-day CAR is $1.03\\%$ . The abnormal returns are even more pronounced when we focus on firms where the AFL-CIO union pension funds specifically oppose insider directors who are more likely to directly interact with workers. Furthermore, Panels B and C indicate that the positive abnormal return response to the formation of the CTW Coalition is highly representative of the total sample of firms; approximately $70\\%$ of all sample firms experienced positive CARs around the event.  \n\nIn contrast, Panels D and E show that firms where the AFL-CIO union pension funds do not oppose directors do not experience significant changes in shareholder value. Across almost all windows, the CARs are statistically indistinguishable from zero. These findings are noteworthy because they contradict the possibility that the positive CARs in Panels A-C are driven by changes in union organization unrelated to pension fund activism, rather than activism itself, because workers at these sample firms also disaffiliate from the AFL-CIO in order to join the CTw Coalition.  \n\nTable9 Effects of AFL-CIO proxy votes on stock prices

theformation of theCTw Coalition for firms whose workers disaffiliate from the AFL-CIO and which subsequently face less opposition from AFLCIO union pension funds in director elections.  \n\nPanels F and G illustrate that firms experiencing labor union-management disputes, and hence more likely to face AFL-CIO opposition in director elections, also exhibit highly positive and statistically significant CARs around the breakup of the AFL-CIO. The mean (median) CAR ranges between $0.58\\%$ and $2.23\\%$ $0.38\\%$ and $3.00\\%$ 0. In contrast, Panels H and I show that firms with no disputes between management and labor unions did not realize significant valuation changes around the formation of the CTw Coalition.  \n\nFinally, Panels J and $\\mathbf{K}$ illustrate conditions under which union pension funds are more likely to have an influence on firm behavior and performance. Union pension activism is more likely to have negative valuation effects when managers face less monitoring by other institutional investors. Consistent with this hypothesis, Panel J illustrates that firms with below-sample median institutional holdings exhibit large CARs around the formation of the CTW Coalition (ranging between $0.67\\%$ and $1.13\\%$ ), whereas Panel K shows that firms with above-median institutional holdings do not experience significant changes in shareholder value.  \n\nAcross all panels, the estimated impact of reduced union pension fund opposition ranges between $0.49\\%$ and $3.00\\%$ of equity value. The negative effects of union funds are consistent with theories by Romano (2001), Bainbridge (2006), and Anabtawi and Stout (2008). Additionally, the magnitudes of the estimates are comparable to the findings of other studies on investor activism.25 Becht et al. (2009) find that Hermes activism announcements are associated with CARs ranging between $3\\%$ and $5\\%$ , while Brav et al. (2008) estimate that hedge fund activist announcements have CARs of up to $7\\%$  \n\n3.6.3 Labor union-management relations. I also examine the ways in which union pension fund votes appear to benefit labor unions. Brancato (1997) notes that many corporate managers view union pension fund activism as a means of “pressuring management in labor management disputes rather than pressing for better corporate governance and shareholder protections.\" Consistent with this claim, Schwab and Thomas (1998) highlight the United Food and Commercial Workers′ push for a confidential voting proposal at Albertson's in 1996, as part of the union's strategy to force the company to allow its employees to unionize.  \n\nI estimate the impact of union pension fund opposition on the frequency of labor union-management conflict, stemming from unionization efforts and contract bargaining. If pension fund opposition is effective at pressuring management in labor-management disputes, then proxy voting opposition toward directors should be associated with reductions in unfair labor practice filings. I estimate the following regression model:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{L o g(U L P F i l i n g s)_{i j t}=\\alpha+\\beta_{1}(V o t e M g t_{i j t}+\\beta_{2}(S t o c k R e t u r n_{j t})}\\ &{\\qquad+\\beta_{3}(F i r m S i z e_{j t}))+\\beta_{4}(Y e a r t)+\\beta_{5}(F i r m_{j})+\\varepsilon_{i j t},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere subscripts ijt uniquely identify individual observations for nominee $i$ firm $j$ , and time $t.L o g(U L P F i l i n g s)_{i j t}=\\mathrm{log}$ of ( $^{1+}$ number unfair labor practice charges involving firm $j$ in year $t$ $F i r m S i z e_{j t}=\\log$ of book value of assets of firm $j$ in year $t$ . All other variables are defined as in specification (1).  \n\nThe findings are presented in Table 10. Across columns 1-4 in Panel A, opposition toward individual directors is associated with at least a $2.5\\%$ reduction in the frequency of unfair labor practice filings related to unionization conflicts. When the sample is limited to union firms, the estimate becomes slightly larger in magnitude. Perhaps most importantly, when the sample is restricted to observations prior to the breakup of the AFL-CIO union, thereby excluding endogenous posttreatment observations, the evidence is even stronger, as the coefficient estimate more than doubles to $-7.1\\%$ . Finally, I find that the impact of proxy voting opposition toward all directors on a board has a large effect on the incidence of unfair labor practices: Total board disapproval is associated with an $11.5\\%$ reduction in unionization conflicts. The results are similar if we examine conflict during collective bargaining, as illustrated in Panel B. Votes against individual directors are associated with at least a $1\\%$ reduction in ULP filings, while total board disapproval is associated with a $9.9\\%$ reduction in ULP filings involving collective bargaining.  \n\nThe evidence that director opposition is associated with reductions in labor union-management disputes, involving both unionization and collective bargaining, is consistent with the theory that union pension fund activism aims to pressure management in labor conflicts. The data suggest that directors respond to union pension fund disapproval in board elections by ameliorating labor-management disputes, perhaps to reduce negative publicity associated with poor election outcomes (Grundfest 2003). Since several studies point to the reduction of ULP's as a contributor to increased union wage differentials, these findings may also explain the observed effects of union votes on equity prices (Olson and Becker 1990; Freeman 1986; Hirsch 1991).  \n\n## 4. Conclusion  \n\nThis article presents evidence that suggests union pension funds have preferences that partly reflect union worker interests, rather than equity value maximization alone. Union funds are more likely to oppose directors of firms that  \n\nTable10 Effects of AFL-CIO proxy votes on labor-management disputes   \nPanel A:Unionization Conflict   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Log(Unfair Labor Practices)</td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Vote Against</td><td>-0.026***</td><td>-0.025***</td><td>-0.034***</td><td>-0.071***</td><td>-0.115**</td></tr><tr><td>(0.007)</td><td>(0.007)</td><td>(0.011)</td><td>(0.012)</td><td>(0.057)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Stock Performance</td><td></td><td>0.009*</td><td>0.003</td><td>0.008</td><td>0.013</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.005)</td><td>(0.009)</td><td>(0.009)</td><td>(0.029)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Log(Assets)</td><td></td><td>0.073***</td><td>0.205***</td><td>-0.004</td><td>0.029</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.021)</td><td>(0.047)</td><td>(0.045)</td><td>(0.152)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Constant</td><td>0.410***</td><td>-0.307</td><td>-1.301***</td><td>0.784*</td><td>1.029</td></tr><tr><td>(0.004)</td><td>(0.209)</td><td>(0.458)</td><td>(0.439)</td><td>(1.446)</td></tr><tr><td>Firm Fixed Effects</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>YearFixed Effects</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Sample Firms</td><td>All</td><td>All</td><td>Union</td><td>Union</td><td>Union</td></tr><tr><td>Sample Years</td><td>All</td><td>All</td><td>All</td><td><2006</td><td><2006</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>10,407</td><td>10,390</td><td>5,620</td><td>4,134</td><td>581</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\">Panel B: Collective Bargaining Conflict</td></tr><tr><td>Log(Unfair Labor Practices)</td><td>(6)</td><td>(7)</td><td>(8)</td><td>(9)</td><td>(10)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Vote Against</td><td>-0.016**</td><td>-0.010</td><td>-0.027*</td><td>-0.053***</td><td>-0.099</td></tr><tr><td>(0.008)</td><td>(0.008)</td><td>(0.014)</td><td>(0.014)</td><td>(0.072)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Stock Performance</td><td></td><td>-0.023***</td><td>-0.049***</td><td>-0.032***</td><td>-0.007</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.006)</td><td>(0.012)</td><td>(0.012)</td><td>(0.037)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Log(Assets)</td><td></td><td>-0.165***</td><td>-0.302***</td><td>-0.122*</td><td>0.159</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.029)</td><td></td><td>(0.069)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Constant</td><td>0.528***</td><td>2.136***</td><td>(0.064) 3.788***</td><td>2.054***</td><td>(0.194)</td></tr><tr><td>(0.004)</td><td>(0.292)</td><td></td><td></td><td>2.414</td></tr><tr><td>Firm Fixed Effects</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>(0.632) Yes</td><td>(0.680) Yes</td><td>(1.842) Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Year Fixed Effects</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Sample Firms</td><td>All</td><td>All</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Sample Years</td><td>All</td><td>All</td><td>Union All</td><td>Union <2006</td><td>Union</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>10,407</td><td>10,390</td><td>5,620</td><td>4,134</td><td><2006 581</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n\\*\\*\\*， $^{**}$ and \\* denote significance at the $1\\%$ $5\\%$ , and $10\\%$ levels, respectively   \nThis table presents regression results of unfair labor practice (ULP) filings as a function of AFL-CIO proxy votes.The baseline OLS specification is  \n\n$$\nL o g(U L P F i l i n g s)_{i j l}=\\alpha+\\beta_{I}(V o t e M g t_{i j l})+\\beta_{2}(S t o c k R e t u r n_{j l})+\\beta_{3}(L o g(A s s e l s_{j l}))+\\beta_{4}(Y e a r_{t})+\\beta_{5}(F i r m_{j})+\\varepsilon_{i j l},\n$$  \n\nwhere subscripts $i j t$ uniquely identify individual observations for nominee $i$ , firm $j$ , and time $t$ (columns 1-4, 6- $9).L o g(U L P F i l i n g s)_{i j t}=\\log$ of $1+$ number unfair labor practice charges involving firm $j$ in year $t$ $.V o t e M g t_{i j t}=$ 1 (0) if the AFL-CIO votes against (for)firm $j$ 's recommendation fornominee $i$ at time t $.L o g(A s s e t s)_{j t}=\\log$ of book value of assets of firm $j$ in year $t$ .

Their opposition also appears to benefit union workers at the expense of shareholder value.  \n\nMore broadly, this study illustrates that directors not only react to aggregate support realized in elections, but they also respond to the disparate interests of individual shareholder blocks. The influence of such constituencies is largely facilitated by the dispersion of ownership for many large companies. Nonvalue-maximizing entities, such as union pension funds, and potentially public pension funds, family shareholders, government owners, etc., have more sway when their shareholdings are relatively larger. In these circumstances, their votes are likely to be important for issues such as labor relations, board characteristics, management compensation, and other decisions where directors have influence.  \n\nThe efficiency implications of disparate shareholder preferences are unclear. Union pension funds may be fully acting in the best interests of pension fund participants and increasing total surplus for all stakeholders. Conversely, other activists might be raising equity value at the expense of total gains for all constituents. Identifying the effects of disparate shareholder interests on value creation as well as value distribution is an important issue that needs to be addressed in future research.  \n\n## Appendix 1:  \n\n### Union Relations  \n\nI construct estimates of employee-union affliation across all sample firms, using a variety of publicly available sources. There is no centralized, publicly available database that contains information on firm employee-union associations; I consult data sources that have been used by previous researchers (Dinardo and Lee 2004; Cutcher-Gershenfeld and Kochan 2004; Gomez and Tzioumis 2006 are recent examples).  \n\nFirst, I search the 2006 10-K filings for each company in the AFL-CIO portfolios. Some firms do not have 2006 10-K's, due in part to mergers, acquisitions, or exchange rules; for these firms, I rely on the most recent 10-K available (prior to 2006). If no 10-K is available, I consult the 2006 or most recent annual report prior to 2006 released by the firm itself (available online or through investor relations departments). If the 10-K or equivalent annual report explicitly states that none of the U.S. full-time equivalent workers in the firm belong to a union or are subject to a collective-bargaining agreement, I categorize the firm as “\"non-union.\"  \n\nIf the 10-K does not explicitly state that a firm's domestic workers are nonunionized, then I consult the U.S. FMCS listing of F-7 notices from January 2003 to December 2006 to identify expiring union contracts. These data are available through a Freedom of Information Act request. For each company in the AFL-CIO sample, I search for the company name under the “Employer” field in each F-7 notice. I check the industry description in the F-7 filing with the SIC code and industry description of the firm in the 10-K and verify that the F-7 notice is not identifying spurious firm names or contracts for firm subcontractors. Then, for each company with F-7 notices, I identify the total number of workers associated with AFL-CIO-affiliated unions and CTW-affiliated unions. The union name and size of the bargaining unit associated with each firm are available in the F-7 notice. For each firm, I sum the numbers of workers in bargaining units associated with each labor organization. If the percentage of workers belonging to unions associated with the CTW Coalition isgreater than $90\\%$ ,I categorize the firm as CTW; otherwise, if at least $10\\%$ oftheworkersbelong to an AFL-CIO union, the firm is categorized as AFL-CIO.  \n\nSome firms explicitly state which unions are associated with their workers in the 10-K; if no FMCS filings are available for these firms, I rely on information in the 10-K's to estimate union workforces. Six firms (railroads and airlines) are not covered under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), mandating that the FMCS must be notified of expiring union contracts. Based on information in the 10-K's and discussions with the firms’ investor relations departments,  \n\nI categorize these firms as “AFL-CIO firms.\" The results are similar if we exclude these six firms fromthesample.  \n\nIf a firm does not explicitly state that it has union workers and there are no F-7 notices associated with the firm from 2003 to 2006, I categorize the firm as “non-union.\" There are several firms that suggest in the 10-K's that they employ union workers; however, I do not find an F-7 notice for these firms. For this small subsample of firms,I consult additional sources in order to more precisely identify employee-union affiliation. First, I look at FMCS filings for 2001-2007. This yields F-7 notices for four companies; using the latest F-7 notice available, I categorize the firm as AFL-CIO or CTW, depending on the affiliation of the union described in the filing. The findings are similar if these four firms are excluded from the sample. For the remaining companies in the subsample, I then consult NLRB elections and petitions from 2001 to 2007 (limiting the search to elections with twenty workers or more, following Dinardo and Lee 2004). For two firms, these data yield union information and hence union categorization. The results are similar if we exclude these two firms from the sample. Finally, I contact the investor relations departments for remaining firms and am able to ascertain the union affiliation of workers at four firms: Affiliated Computer Services and VF Corporation, which are both categorized as CTW firms, and Decoma and Magna International, which are both categorized as AFL-CIO firms. The results are similar if we exclude these four firms from the sample.  \n\nThere are several potential sources of measurement error; however, it is likely that this measurement error causes voting pattern estimates to understate the true impact of union worker interests on proxy voting. First, FMCS data may be missing some unions or firms that do not comply with the legal requirements of the NLRA (leading to downward bias in union representation). Second, I utilize U.S. government filings; I restrict the unionization estimates to include U.S. full-time equivalent employees who are unionized—not international workers who may belong to a labor union, since data on international unionization are not standardized across firms. Third, for each company, I search the FMCS and NLRB filings, using only the primary company name associated with the ticker symbol—not uniquely named subsidiaries for each firm. Sometimes subsidiaries will be listed alongside the parent company name in F-7 notices and this will be included in the dataset; other times a subsidiary will have a different name from the parent company and this will not be included in the dataset. I assume that the F-7 notices associated with a parent company are representative of the F-7 notices associated with a parent company and all of its subsidiaries.  \n\n## Appendix 2:  \n\n### NLRB Unfair Labor Practice Data  \n\nThere are primarily two types of unfair labor practices (ULP). First, collective bargaining ULP's are charges filed by labor unions against firms in violation of Section 8(a)(5) of the NLRA, which stipulates that an employer cannot “refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of his employees, subject to the provisions of section 9(a)” where section 9(a) reads:  \n\nRepresentatives designated or selected for the purposes of collective bargaining by the majority of the employees in a unit appropriate for such purposes shall be the exclusive representatives of all the employees in such unit for the purposes of collective bargaining in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of employment: Provided, that any individual employee or a group of employees shall have the right at any time to present grievances to their employer and to have such grievances adjusted, without the intervention of the bargaining representative, as long as the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of a collective-bargaining contract or agreement then in effect: Provided further, that the bargaining representative has been given opportunity to be present at such adjustment.  \n\nSecond, unionization ULP's are charge issued by firms against labor unions, in which labor unions are accused of engaging in illegal unionization practices (a violation of Section 8(b)(1)(A) of the NLRA). Section 8(b)(1)(A) specifically stipulates that: It shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents to restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 7: Provided, that this paragraph shall not impair the right of a labor organization to prescribe its own rules with respect to the acquisition or retention of membership therein.  \n\nSection 7 states:  \n\nEmployees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, and shall also have the right to refrain from any or all such activities except to the extent that such right may be affected by an agreement requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment as authorized in section8(a)(3).  \n\nRAA maintains a database of all individual charges (dockets) filed with the NLRB. I hand collect filings relevant to a particular firm by searching for the firm's name in the “Employer” field of each docket in the database. If there are no unfair labor practices for a given firm, that firm is recorded as having O ULP. I repeat this procedure for every firm in the sample. I search among all ULP charges filed between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2002, for the pre-sample strife measures used in this article. For within-sample ULP data from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2006, I utilize data obtained from the NLRB through an FOIA request (RAA does not maintain complete ULP data for this period).  \n\nReferences Adamy, J. 2004.

We find that positive technology shocks raised productivity, employment, vacancies, and labor turnover and lowered unemployment and business failures. Moreover, automotive and electrical innovations (quintessentialgeneral-purposetechnologies）hadagreater positive impact on employment than those in mechanical innovations. The overall results, compatible with the predictions of the real business cycle model, raise questions about the anemic recovery in employment after 1934 since the strong upsurge in technical change failed to be accompanied by vigorousjobexpansion.  \n\n## 1.  Introduction  \n\nmovements in output, hours, and employment at business cycle frequencies is a subject of intense debate among macroeconomists. The debate is concerned largely with the degree to which technology shocks explain both cyclical fuctuations in the labor market and the response of labor market variables to the shocks.1 For example, in standard New Keynesian models with sticky prices and nonaccommodating monetary policy, it is argued that for the most part, demand, not technology, shocks account for cycles in output and employment, and, at least initially, a positive technology shock leads to a short-run drop in employment and/or hours worked.? In standard neoclassical models, rigidities are absent, and technology shocks drive cycles and have an immediate positive effect on employment. It follows then that the use of direct measures of technical change in an analysis of business cycles should contribute to resolution of the debate in that they will allow us to determine empirically the impact of technology shocks on both cyclical fuctuations and short-run employment opportunities. With these considerations in mind, we run a series of vector autoregressions for the period 1909 to 1949, employing new direct measures of technical change, to pinpoint the impact of technology shocks on both cycles and labor market variables.3  \n\nOur choice of time period is intentional. While most participants in this debate, with the notable exception of Francis and Ramey (2004), focus on the post-World War II years, there are compelling reasons to look at the earlier decades of the last century. First, the U.s. economy was subject to more frequent, longer, and deeper business cycles (including, of course, the worst on record) during the first half of the twentieth century than during any subsequent period. Second, the 1920s and, especially, the 1930s were decades  of rapid technical progress  where significant advances occurred across a large number of industries and types of innovations, including two major general-purpose technologies (GPT)—electricity and automobiles—and one near GPT—machinery.4 Third, high rates of unemployment dogged the U.S. economy throughout the 1930s, even after recovery started in 1934 and as technical change hit record highs. President Roosevelt, along with many in his administration, seemed to believe that these technical advances were major contributors to the paucity of new employment opportunities (Bix, 2000). Others, such as Cole and Ohanian (2004), contend instead, that it was the very policies introduced by the administration to abet recovery that held back job growth. As we explain below, our new indicators allow us to evaluate the validity of Roosevelt's beliefs and help us determine technology's role in the recovery.  \n\nWe use two sets of measures in our analysis. The first consists of the annual technical change indicators presented initially in Alexopoulos and Cohen (2009), which covers 1909 to 1949 and is based on information in the Library of Congress's (LOC) MARC record database. The second is entirely novel: It measures innovations at monthly frequencies from 1920 to 1949 and is created from the publication lists in R. R. Bowker Company's Publisher's Weekly (PW). Both sets embody the full range of features considered desirable in such indicators: they are objective, consistent over time, and they capture innovations at the moment of their commercialization. They suffer from few of the shortcomings associated with traditional direct measures and, unlike indirect ones such as those based on cleansed Solow residuals or long-run restrictions, focus unambiguously on new technologies.5 The new indicators have an additional attractive feature. Since they allow us to break down overall technical advances into various subgroups, such as electrical, automotive, and mechanical (our GPT and near-GPT technologies), they enable us to quantify the importance and impact of different types of technological change (GPT versus non-GPT, product versus process) on productivity and the labor market. The monthly measures, moreover, allow us to examine the impact of technology shocks on labor market variables in various subperiods and thus check the robustness of results based on the annual indicators.  \n\nTo summarize our findings briefly, we observe, first, in keeping with Francis and Ramey (2004), a positive relationship between aggregate technology shocks and employment in the short and medium runs at both annual and monthly frequencies. In short, even if the economy was saddled with frictions, imperfections, or price and wage rigidities, they were insufficient to offset the positive impact of technical change on employment. Second, we find that our bookbased measures of technology explain a significant portion of the variance in employment, especially at monthly frequencies. Third, consistent with the predictions of a standard search model, while innovations during this period created new jobs, destroyed old ones, and altered skill requirements, the bottom line is that, overall, they boosted job opportunities: vacancies rose and the unemployment rate fell as a direct consequence of technical change.6 Fourth, our data suggest, in keeping with the literature on postwar labor markets and technical change, that the introduction of new technologies increased labor market turbulence in the manufacturing sector: the median layoff rate dropped, while the gross accession rate, total separations, quits, and discharges all increased.′ Fifth, we find that despite the turbulence in the labor market, technical change during this time period was associated with fewer business failures.  \n\nWhen we disaggregate by type of technology, our results indicate that the quintessential GPTs (automotive and electrical) had a greater positive impact on employment than those in the one near-GPT (mechanical). The obvious question is, Why the difference? Evidence from the industrial organization literature suggests  that both product- and process-based technological change can increase productivity at the firm and industry levels, although their impact on labor demand often differs.8 New products create new markets and usually boost employment, while new processes frequently save labor and may therefore cause employment to fall. Although process advances are present in all of our groups, electrical and automotive technologies also contain strong job-creating product components.” In this respect, it is likely that the Roosevelt administration's preoccupation with the labor-displacing effects of new technologies was largely a consequence of its focus on innovations in manufacturing.10 Had the administration heeded the warning of its researchers and included in its evaluation the rapid growth of new products linked to automotive and electrical advances, it may have been more sanguine about the employment-boosting features of these new technologies. It may even have embraced the idea that the great wave of gadgets that swept over the United States from the mid-1930s actually prevented a bad situation from becoming a good deal worse. As it happens, this is confirmed by the results of our counterfactual analysis. In the absence of positive technology shocks in the 1930s, TFP, per capita hours worked, and private, nonfarm employment would all have been much lower than they actually were and rates of unemployment substantially higher.  \n\nWe proceed as follows. In the next section, we present our annual and monthly indicators of technical change and review their intuitive appeal. In section Il, we examine the response of productivity, labor market variables, and business failures to aggregate technology shocks. In section IV, we first examine the differential effects of various types of technology shocks (GPT, near-GPT, and nonGPT) on employment, unemployment, labor turnovers, and business failures and then present a series of counterfactuals that highlight the crucial role GPT technologies played in recovery from the Great Depression. In section V, we summarize our findings and identify areas for future research.  \n\n## I1. Indicators of Technological Change  \n\nA good indicator of technical change should be consistent over time, objective, quantifiable, and able to capture an innovation at the moment of its commercialization. All the usual suspects fail to meet one or more of these requirements. Research and development expenditures (available annually only after 1953) measure inputs into the inventive process, not outputs of commercially viable innovations. While, as Griliches (1990) and others point out, patent applications and grants do represent potentially valuable new additions to economic knowledge, the long and uncertain lags associated with their commercial adoption make them at best imperfect indicators for our purpose. They are, in addition, compromised for the 1930s because a surge in judicial hostility to corporate patents led to a decline in corporate patent applications (Schmookler, 1966). Although innovation counts resolve some of these problems, they are difficult  to  quantify  and  are  notoriously   subjective.11  \n\nFinally, while changes in productivity numbers (even those cleansed using techniques proposed by Basu et al., 2006, or Ohanian, 2001) do pick up changes in efficiency, they may be affected by factors other than technical change (e.g., changes in regulations) and thus fail to provide a foolproof measure of commercialized technology.  \n\nThe indicators used here are designed to capture new innovations at the time of commercialization and are derived using the method proposed by Alexopoulos (2008, 2011).12 The annual series we utilize from Alexopoulos and Cohen (2009) are based on new technology titles (excluding new editions) in the MARC (MAchine Readable Cataloguing) records of the LOC. As Alexopoulos and Cohen (2009) demonstrate, there is a close correspondence between the commercialization of major innovations as reported by Mensch (1979) or Jewkes, Sawers, and Stillerman (1969) and its first appearance in book form. As Alexopoulos and Cohen (2009） note,this correspondence between the dates makes perfect sense. Firms must promote their innovations and the publishing industry profits from spreading knowledge about them. For both groups, timing is crucial: too early, and no market is likely to exist for their titles; too late, and the market is likely to be saturated and the information dated. In short, there is every reason to believe that new technology titles closely track the commercialization of new products and processes, especially during this period, when books and manuals were the most common way to disseminate such information.  \n\nReliance on annual indicators does have one potential drawback: it may mask within-year short-run movements at business cycle frequencies. To address this problem, we created a new set of indicators based on data drawn from $P W$ a weekly bulletin (with monthly summaries) published by R. R. Bowker. The volumes, intended for use by the procurement staff of libraries and booksellers, contain information by subject area on publisher (only major publishers are included), date and place of publication, language (mostly English), and type.13 Although the indicators based on the $P W$ lists cover a shorter time span than those constructed from the MARC records—they begin in 1920—and are limited to aggregate estimates of innovative activity, they provide a valuable complement to the LOC series since they allow us to examine subperiods and thus to determine if a change in observational frequency alters our results. 14  \n\nBoth the monthly and annual indicators reveal that the 1930s was indeed a technologically progressive period, with the largest number of innovations occurring in the latter half of the decade, coincident with the rapid increase in productivity.15 There are both similarities and differences in the pattern of ups and downs across subgroups. To summarize briefy, the number of new children's titles does not trace the same trajectory as that exhibited by technology books. Publications in electrical engineering and electronics show a sharp spike in the early 1920s, plummet between 1929 and 1932, and then experience an equally dramatic recovery through 1941. Manufacturing advances begin their upswing a year later and continue to expand fitfully through 1942. Finally, during the war years, the decreases in some subgroups, such as automotive technologies, can be linked to the shift in focus from civilian to military-based innovations (whose titles are cataloged in another class).  \n\nThese variations across indicators are significant for at least two reasons. First, they suggest that the measures represent real differences in innovative activity across subgroups, not mere trends in publishing. Second, these differences permit us to isolate the impact of different technologies on aggregate employment and thus to determine if the effect on labor demand varies, as many claim, across technologies. On the other hand, the fact that the aggregate annual and monthly technology indicators adhere to a similar pattern allows us to use the latter to see if the responses to the shocks change over time.  \n\n## IM.  The Response of Employment and Productivity to Aggregate Technical Change  \n\n### A. The Bivariate Vector Autoregressions  \n\nThe following series of bivariate VARs are used to estimate the relationship between technological change (as measured by our indicators) and productivity, labor market variables, and business failures:  \n\n$$\nY_{t}=\\mathsf{\\alpha}+\\gamma_{0}t+\\gamma_{1}t^{2}+\\mathsf{\\rho}\\mathsf{p}Y_{t-1}+\\mathsf{\\delta}\\mathsf{E}_{t}+\\mathsf{\\varepsilon}_{t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $Y_{t}=[\\ln(Z_{t}),\\ln(X_{t})]^{\\prime}$ ,with $Z_{t}$ representing one of our productivity, labor market, or business failures variables; $X_{t}$ one of our technology indicators (total, manufacturing and mechanical, electrical and electronic, automotive technologies, or railroad); and $E_{t}$ the log of high school graduates per capita in period $t$ (in an attempt to control for the effect of changes in education on publication trends, productivity, and labor demand).16 As in Shea (1998), Alexopoulos and Cohen (2009), and Alexopoulos (2011), we identify technology shocks by assuming that they affect the $Z$ variables with a one-period time lag for both the annual and monthly cases.17 The technology indicators are normalized by the number of new children's titles to control for general changes in the publishing industry.18  \n\nTABLE 1.—VARIANCE DECOMPOSITIONS FOR PRODUCTIVITY MEASURERS: SHARES ATTRIBUTABLE TO TECHNOLOGY   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">Indicator</td><td rowspan=\"3\">Horizon (years)</td><td colspan=\"2\">GNP per Employee</td><td colspan=\"2\">Private NonfarmTFP</td><td colspan=\"2\">Aggregate 1.P./EMP</td><td colspan=\"2\">Manufacturing I.P./Emp.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">(1947 dollars) (Annual)</td><td colspan=\"2\">(Annual)</td><td colspan=\"2\">(Monthly)</td><td colspan=\"2\">(Monthly)</td></tr><tr><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"9\">A.Bivariate VARs with the Technology Indicator Ordered Last</td></tr><tr><td>AggregateTechnology</td><td>3</td><td>4.8</td><td>(0.1,20.7)</td><td>14.1</td><td>(1.4,34.8)</td><td>48.8</td><td>(22.2,70.0)</td><td>24.1</td><td>(4.5,51.4)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>6</td><td>9.0</td><td>(0.1,35.3)</td><td>24.7</td><td>(2.7,54.6)</td><td>49.9</td><td>(23.1,74.4)</td><td>25.5</td><td>(4.7,55.4)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>9</td><td>10.4</td><td>(0.1,40.6)</td><td>27.3</td><td>(3.1,60.6)</td><td>49.9</td><td>(23.2,76.0)</td><td>25.4</td><td>(4.7,56.1)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>3</td><td>14.4</td><td>(1.6,35.5)</td><td>21.6</td><td>(4.0,43.9)</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturing</td><td>6</td><td>26.0</td><td>(3.1,56.7)</td><td>35.8</td><td>(7.5,64.5)</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>9</td><td>28.9</td><td>(3.5,62.5)</td><td>38.4</td><td>(8.6,68.6)</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>3</td><td>13.4</td><td>(2.1,32.4)</td><td>19.5</td><td>(4.2,39.3)</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>Electrical</td><td>6</td><td>17.1</td><td>(2.7,41.3)</td><td>23.7</td><td>(5.2,47.6)</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>9</td><td>17.7</td><td>(2.8,42.4)</td><td>24.1</td><td>(5.3,48.6)</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>3</td><td>10.8</td><td>(0.7,29.3)</td><td>13.1</td><td>(1.3,32.7)</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>Automotive</td><td>6</td><td>26.9</td><td>(1.9,58.8)</td><td>31.0</td><td>(3.8,60.0)</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>9</td><td>33.2</td><td>(2.6,67.0)</td><td>35.8</td><td>(5.0,66.3)</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\">B.Trivariate VARs: GPT Indicator Ordered Second and Non-GPT Measure Ordered Last</td></tr><tr><td>GPT</td><td>3</td><td>15.8</td><td>(2.4,35.3)</td><td>23.8</td><td>(5.5,45.3)</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>6</td><td>23.5</td><td>(3.3,48.8)</td><td>33.5</td><td>(8.1,57.9)</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>Non-GPT</td><td>9</td><td>24.6</td><td>(3.5,50.7)</td><td>34.4</td><td>(8.5,59.2)</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>3</td><td>0.7</td><td>(0.1,9.1)</td><td>0.4</td><td>(0.1,8.5)</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>6</td><td>0.6</td><td>(0.2,14.9)</td><td>2.2</td><td>(0.2,17.8)</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>9</td><td>0.8</td><td>(0.2,16.8)</td><td>2.7</td><td>(0.2,21.1)</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nColumns marked “1\" reports the shares and columns marked $^{66}2^{\\mathrm{{n}}}$ report! $90\\%$ conidenceintervals.VARsinclude a quadratic trend and high school completion.Shocks areidentifed using a Cholesky decomosition.

The Agg. & Manuf. $\\mathrm{{I.P./Emp}}$ VARs span January 1929 to December 1949, and January 1920 to December 1949 respectively.  \n\nAggregate technological change and productivity.Since technical change exerts its influence on employment, at least in part, through its impact on productivity, it is necessary to explore first the relationship between technology as captured by our indicators and productivity during this period. For the annual analysis, we use the standard TFP and labor productivity measures, while for the monthly cases, since monthly TFP figures are unavailable, we create two labor productivity series: industrial production over aggregate employment for the period April 1929 to December 1949 and manufacturing production over manufacturing employment for the period January 1920 to December 1949.19 The Granger-causality tests (repored in the tables in appendix B) for the bivariate VARs clearly indicate that changes in technology Granger-cause changes in labor productivity at both annual and monthly frequencies (and, for annual data, also TFP) and are for the most part significant at the $5\\%$ to $10\\%$ levels. Although there is little evidence in the annual data to indicate reverse causality, that is, from productivity to technology, at monthly frequencies, causality seems to run in both directions.  \n\nIn the first three rows of panel A in table 1, we report the variance decompositions (and their corresponding $90\\%$ confidence intervals) for our aggregate measures of technical change and productivity at the three-, six-, and nine-year horizons for both the annual and monthly series. A few features of these results merit attention. First, the variance attributable to the aggregate technology indicators  is somewhat smaller for labor productivity than for private nonfarm TFP (e.g., $9\\%$ versus $24.7\\%$ at the six-year horizon). Second, the relationship between technical change and labor productivity is much stronger for the monthly than for the annual data (e.g., $9\\%$ versus $49.8\\%$ at the sixyear horizon), a reassuring result in that the $P W$ series is composed primarily of books from major, commercially oriented publishers that, no surprise, account for a disproportionate share of titles on influential and widely used innovations.  \n\nThe first figures in panels A and B in figure 1 depict the impulse responses of GNP per worker (1947 dollars) and aggregate TFP to a $1\\%$ positive aggregate technology shock along with $90\\%$ confidence bands, while panel C shows the responses and $90\\%$ confidence intervals for monthly industrial production and manufacturing output per employee. As expected, the standard errors are larger for the annual than for the monthly data, but in both cases, the relationship between technical change and productivity is positive. In the annual case, the peak response of labor productivity and TFP to the $1\\%$ shock is between $0.08\\%$ and $0.09\\%$ and occurs two to three years following the initial shock. In the monthly case, the peak responses for manufacturing and aggregate labor productivity are approximately $0.025\\%$ and $0.06\\%$ ,，respectively, with the maximum impact felt between twelve and eighteen months following the shock. In short, our technology shocks can be viewed as similar to the productivity shocks used in standard business cycle models.  \n\n![](images/4d085ba04de56c5c996dac39507bcc79bdcd2ce275c86cbccd3069a8d862e17b.jpg)  \n  \nVARs include quadratic trend and high schol completion.

Labor Market Responses to Aggregate TechnologyShocks  \n\ncaptures the impact of aggregate technical change on vacancies, employment, hours, and the rates of unemployment, quits, layoffs, dismissals, and accession. Together, they provide a comprehensive account of the impact of innovation on the labor market during this period.  \n\nWe now turn to the central focus of this analysis: the relationship between our indicators of technical change and labor market variables. We report two sets of results. The first, using annual data, measures the impact of aggregate technology shocks on employment (total, manufacturing, and transportation), total hours, and unemployment per capita, while the second, based on monthly data from $P W$  \n\nResponses of annual variables.  The Granger-causality tests (reported in appendix B) indicate that at annual frequencies, the aggregate technology measure does not Granger-cause fluctuations in aggregate employment per capita, aggregate unemployment per capita, per capita nonfarm employment, and private nonfarm hours per capita, but it does Granger-cause fuctuations in per capita manufacturing and transportation employment. Reverse causality is not seen in any of these cases.  \n\nThe impulse responses to a $1\\%$ positive aggregate technology shock, reported in panel A in figure 2, are generally consistent with those predicted by a neoclassical business cycle model (or a New Keynesian one with accommodating monetary policy). No matter which measure of employment or unemployment is used, or in which sector, the estimated responses reveal that employment and hours increase and unemployment falls, notably even in the short run. The peak responses for employment occur two to three years following the shock and range from a low of approximately $0.048\\%$ for aggregate per capita employment to a high of roughly $0.22\\%$ for transportation employment per capita. For unemployment and hours per capita, the maximum responses are approximately $-0.6\\%$ and $0.1\\%$ , respectively. The responses are significant at standard levels for per capita private nonfarm, manufacturing, and transportation employment.  \n\nThe variance decompositions are presented in the first three rows of panel A in table 2. They indicate that a modest amount of variation in the labor market variables is attributable to aggregate technological change. For example, at the six-year horizon, approximately $10\\%$ of the variation in the labor market aggregates, $16\\%$ of swings in manufacturing employment, and as much as $27\\%$ of the changes in transportation employment appear to be linked to fluctuations in aggregate technology.  \n\nMonthlylaborvariableresponsestotechnology shocks. Since annual data may be unable to detect the impact of a technology shock on hours or employment within the first year, we repeat our analysis using monthly statistics. The Granger-causality tests (again reported in appendix B) indicate that our new monthly technology indicators Granger-cause movements  in aggregate nonfarm employment, manufacturing hours and employment, and the unemployment rate. They also Granger-cause fuctuations in aggregate vacancies and the median manufacturing layoff, discharge, quit, separation, and accession rates.  \n\nThe impulse responses to a $1\\%$ aggregate technology shock, and the associated $90\\%$ confidence intervals, are depicted in panel B of figure 2. Overall, there is no evidence that hours or employment decrease, even in the short run. In fact, they begin to surge within the first quarter following the shock, while at the same time, the unemployment rate drops below trend and posted vacancies increase consistent with the predictions of a standard labor search model. Vacancies rise by $0.1\\%$ , while the maximum change in the unemployment rate is $1.0\\%$ . In the eighteen months following the shock, the separation rate increases by 0.84, the quit rate rises by 0.58, the dismissal rate goes up by 0.11, the gross accession rate climbs by 0.95, and the layoff rate falls by 0.45. This increase in labor market turbulence would seem to suggest that while a positive technology shock did create new job opportunities, it also altered skill requirements, causing the need for new matches to be formed. This is supported by a number of the Works Progress Administration studies showing that many firm-worker breakups occurred because workers were either unable or unwilling to be retrained to use the newtechnologies.20  \n\nFinally, the results presented in table 3 suggest that our monthly indicators account for a significant share of the variance for all labor market variables at all horizons. A few of these results are of particular interest because of the light they shed on the connection between new technologies and employment. First, over $55\\%$ of the short-run variance in vacancies is attributable to innovative activity, an indication that technological change, on the whole, was responsible for many of the new employment opportunities. Second, the large share of the variations in the rates of unemployment, separations, accession, layoffs, quits, and discharges explained by our indicators (between $19\\%$ and $27\\%$ at the three- to six-year horizons) testifies to the notion that while the new technologies did create jobs, they also contributed significantly to labor market turbulence.  \n\n### C. Sensitivity Results  \n\nAs is well known, the period 1909 to 1949 was subject to major economic and policy shocks: two world wars, the Great Depression, the roaring twenties, exit from the gold standard, and Roosevelt's New Deal. An obvious question: Are our results robust to changes in time period or, the same question put differently, are our results driven by some of the unique features of the period? To address this question, we run a number of sensitivity tests across different subperiods, relying for the most part on monthly manufacturing employment in order to maximize the number of observations.21 As the results, based on the response of manufacturing employment to technology shocks for the subperiods January 1920 to October 1929, November 1929 to November 1941, December 1941 to December 1949, and July 1933 to December 1949, reported in figure 3, indicate, while changes in time span do affect standard errors, they do not reverse our initial findings. During the first of these, although technological change was more muted than it would be a decade later and monetary policy independence was constrained by the gold standard, a positive aggregate technology shock still caused a short-run jump in employment; the magnitude of the responses is smaller than for the entire period, but the direction is the same.  \n\nThe next subperiod starts with the stock market crash and ends with U.S. entry into World War II. This is clearly a crucial period for our analysis since it encompasses the  \n\nFIGURE 2.—AGGREGATE RESPONSES OF LABOR MARKET VARIABLES TO POSITIVE $1\\%$ AGGREGATE TECHNOLOGY SHOCKS  \n\n![](images/fe49f3545ff7e071e4f14783f7dea0a0a4f84699e983bcfcf6ce8a7c6f4ac3bd.jpg)  \n\nEach panel displays theresponsewith $90\\%$ confidence intervals.

Any (or all) of these changes could have disrupted the positive link between technology shocks and employment. For example, as Cole and Ohanian (2004) argue, New Deal legislation led to major changes in the nature of the wage bargain and the degree of competition, either or both of which could have broken the connection between innovative activity and job creation. Abandonment of the gold standard in 1933, in principal, untied the hands of the Federal Reserve and may well have altered the technologyemployment connection. Some New Deal regulations were explicitly intended to limit the introduction of new machinery and/or capital equipment with potentially deleterious consequences for both innovation and employment.?? The results, once again, are reassuring—despite a rise in standard errors, employment opportunities go up in response to a positive technology shock.  \n\nThe third subperiod focuses on the war and the early postwar period. The war, it is often claimed, spurred innovations that contributed to postwar prosperity. In principal, they could also have had a negative impact on postwar employment but we find, once again, that even in the shortrun, employment opportunities rose in response to a positive aggregate technology shock, with magnitudes similar to those obtained in section IllB.  \n\nIn an effort to isolate the impact on our results of Roosevelt's decision to leave the gold standard in June 1933, we look at a fourth subperiod that starts in July 1933 and ends in December 1949. As in the other cases, our results are insensitive to the change in time span: a positive technology shocks boosts employment.  \n\nA second obvious question is, Are our results sensitive to choice of trend? To begin, we enter the employment series in first differences instead of log levels since, as Fernald (2007) and Gospodinov et al. (2011) indicate, because of potential  low-frequency   comovements between  hours worked and labor productivity, the outcome may be sensitive to this choice. Although our short-run identification strategy may be less prone to this problem than others (see Gospodinov et al., 2011), it is still useful to see if the change matters. The first figure in panel B of figure 3 confirms that first differencing employment does not affect our findings: employment expands in response to a positive technology shock. Moreover, as the remaining figures in panel B show, replacing the quadratic trend with a linear one, or including no deterministic trend at all, leaves our main results unchanged.  \n\nIn our last robustness check, we expand the number of variables in the VAR to include the short-run commercial paper rate and the log of the CPI. Following the literature on monetary policy shocks, we order the employment variable before the interest rates and prices and maintain our assumption that technology affects the economy with only a one-period lag (in this case, one month). As shown in panel C of figure 3, our findings for employment remain the same: prices appear largely unresponsive, and we find no evidence that interest rates were accommodative.23  \n\n### D. The Effect of Technical Change onBusinessFailures  \n\nGiven that technological change appears to create significant turbulence in the labor market, does it have a similar effect on firm entry and exit? While there are limited data on business turnovers during this time, we can gain some insight into the process by looking at business failures for which we do have some data at both annual and monthly frequencies. Again, the results from the bivariate VARs indicate that business failures are Granger-caused by aggregate technology shocks. This is true for both annual total failures and monthly failures for the total private, manufacturing, and trade sectors. The impulse responses to a positive $1\\%$ technology shock, along with the corresponding $90\\%$ confidence intervals, are reported in figure 4, panel A (for the annual measure) and panel B (for the monthly measures). The results, although merely suggestive of firm turnovers, are interesting. Business failures fall significantly in the period following a technology shock. For the annual case, covering 1909 to 1949, we find that a $1\\%$ positive technology shock decreases total business failures by $1\\%$ two years following the shock and remains statistically significant for five years. We obtain similar results for the monthly series: failures decline for a full five years with the peak impact occurring approximately two years after the shock. At their peak, monthly failures drop between $0.2\\%$ and $0.3\\%$ in response to the $1\\%$ shock, with the greatest impact felt among wholesale-retail establishments.  \n\n## IV.  Are All Technology Shocks Created Equal?  \n\nThe answer most economists would give to this question is no, although there is much less agreement about why they have differential impacts on economic activity or even the most appropriate way to distinguish one shock from another. We propose to divide technology shocks into general-purpose (GPT), near GPT, and nongeneral purpose (non-GPT) technology to determine if such a breakdown illuminates the effect of technical change on productivity and employment. There is reason to believe that it does. It is often argued, for example, that the impact of GPTs, unlike near- or non-GPTs, is felt across a broad range of products and processes (see Helpman, 1998). Since a significant number of major breakthroughs in what are considered quintessential GPTs (electrical/electronic, automotive) and near- or non-GPTs (e.g., machinery) occurred during our period, it is an ideal setting for such an investigation. Moreover, as we know from the industrial organization literature, product innovations are likely to have a very different effect on the labor market from process ones.24 As our results, reported below indicate, this distinction does offer compelling insights into how (and by how much) new technologies affect labor markets.  \n\n### A. Productivity and General-Purpose Technologies  \n\nWe ran a series of VARs based on our annual indicators (monthly figures from $P W$ cannot be broken down by fields) to determine if there was anything distinctive about the impact of advances in electronics, machinery, and automotive on productivity. The results from the bivariate VARs suggest that innovations in these areas Granger-cause annual productivity fuctuations (often at the $1\\%$ level). Moreover, as the variance decompositions reported in panel A of table 1 demonstrate, the impact of innovations in these three areas is large, and the share of the variance attributable to them is far greater than that of the aggregate indicator (the first three rows of panel A). To be more precise, while the latter accounted for $5\\%$ of the variation in aggregate labor productivity at the three-year horizon and $10\\%$ at the nine-year horizon, and $14\\%$ and $27\\%$ , respectively, in TFP, these magnitudes jump dramatically when the sample is restricted to GPTs and near-GPTs. For manufacturing/ mechanical, GNP per employee registers $14\\%$ and $30\\%$ at the three- and nine-year horizons and $13\\%$ and $39\\%$ for TFP; for electrical, the corresponding numbers are $9\\%$ and $18\\%$ for labor productivity and $8\\%$ and $25\\%$ for TFP, and for automotive, $10\\%$ and $34\\%$ for labor productivity, and $9\\%$ and $36\\%$ for TFP. In short, both GPT and near GPTs shocks are important drivers of productivity changes.  \n\n![](images/b7ea781a219c24b11fdba5a66f44fc11af00e3fad5c6a61c62d82a7658e72e77.jpg)  \nFIGURE 4.—-BUSINESS FAILURES′ RESPONSES TO $1\\%$ POSITIVE TECHNOLOGY SHOCKS WITH $90\\%$ CONFIDENCE INTERVALS   \nBivariateVARsorderchlogyast.TrivariatARsorderfailuresfirsthnGPT,andnnGPT.llARsncldeaquadratictmetrendandameasuref high shoolcmpleion.hocks areidntiedusng a Cholesky decomposition. Annual VARs (panels A and C) cover 1909-1949. Panel B's monthly VARs span January 1920-December 1949.  \n\nAs  the  disaggregated  impulse-responses  presented  in panels A and B in figure 1 show, productivity rises significantly in all cases in response to a $1\\%$ positive technology shock at $90\\%$ confidence intervals. The $1\\%$ shock translates into a peak increase of between $0.8\\%$ and $0.12\\%$ for labor productivity and between $0.05\\%$ and $0.08\\%$ for TFP. All responses are statistically significant for five to eight years, with the responses to an automotive or mechanical/manufacturing shock peaking in two years and the maximum response to an electrical/electronics shock occurring in the first year.  \n\n### B. Labor Market Responses to GPT and Near-GPTInnovations  \n\nAre the labor market responses to GPT and near-GPT shocks similar, much as they are for productivity? The simple answer is no. The question, of course, is, Why not? As noted, product and process innovations affect the labor market differently. New (or improved) processes increase the efficiency of production with savings in labor or capital, or both, and while they may lead to price reductions or improvements in product quality, the usual outcome is some combination of higher productivity and lower employment. In contrast, new product innovations, embodied in consumption, intermediate, or investment goods, are believed to lead to increases in employment by tapping into new markets. Since there is strong evidence to suggest that GPTs and near-GPTs differ with respect to their relative mix of process and product innovations (see Lipsey et al., 2005, and Stoszak, 2007), we can use GPT/near-GPT distinction to capture the differential impact of product and process innovations.  \n\nConsider, for example, automotive technologies. While advances here did reduce transport costs, and thus did save labor for some firms, there was also a huge and growing demand for automotive products by households. Passenger cars generally outsold trucks and buses by a factor of at least four such that automobiles accounted for between $81.5\\%$ and $98\\%$ of all motor vehicle registrations from 1909 to 1949. Moreover, not only did maintenance and repair outlays ensure a steady demand for automotive parts and service workers, but the ongoing innovation of new goods, such as pneumatic tires and automatic transmissions, also guaranteed a buoyant market for new automobiles and automotive products. As auto ownership grew, so did the number of gas stations and the consumption of gas, from a modest amount in 1909 to 13.6 billion gallons in 1936. As automobiles became speedier and more reliable, the demand for new and better roads expanded—and, as a consequence, so did employment in the construction industry. Street and highway capital as a percent of the total private capital stock almost doubled between 1929 and 1941, from $6.5\\%$ to $10.85\\%$ . Overall, Abernathy, Clark, and Kantrow (1983) find that for the period 1909 to 1949, about $21\\%$ of all known automotive innovations were process related, with the rest, for the most part, tied to new products.25  \n\nElectrical innovations trace a similar pattern. While much has been made of the way in which electricity revolutionized the production process, it is important to recall how closely linked it was to the plethora of new household and related products that appeared during this period, creating not only a booming demand for household electrification and lighting, but also giving rise to whole new industries. The period marked the first great upswing in the innovation and adoption of new, electricity-powered household appliances, including the radio, the TV, electric vacuum cleaners, refrigerators, and washing machines. Indeed, even as the economy's industrial and commercial sectors embraced  the electrification of production processes, households clamored for these new products. As early as 1929, household expenditures on electrical appliances  (excluding electric ranges) and radios alone amounted to over $54\\%$ of total expenditures for industrial and commercial electrical equipment. As the data compiled by Greenwood, Seshadri, and Yorukoglu (2005) suggest, by the end of our period, over $50\\%$ of households had vacuum cleaners, over $60\\%$ had washing machines, and over $90\\%$ had electric refrigerators. Not only did the two- to threefold growth between 1929 and 1941 in demand for household appliances give rise to new jobs in manufacturing, it also stimulated employment in the wholesale and retail trades, transportation, and services. There was new work for electricians and others in the building trades since, among other things, homes often had to be rewired to facilitate adoption of the new products (Tobey, 1996). The diffusion of the radio, and later the TV, brought into being whole new sectors (broadcasting, entertainment, news), with the number of radio and TV stations growing from virtually 0 in 1909 to over 2,100 and 100, respectively, by the end of our period.  \n\nIn contrast to these two, technological advances in mechanical/manufacturing were associated, by and large, with process innovations and new investment goods. For example, major headings under the LOC TJ classification include automatic machinery, turbines, steam engineering, motorsand engines  (excluding electrical), hydraulic machinery, machine shop practice, hoisting and conveying machinery, lifting and pressing machinery, and agricultural machinery, while the TS classification captures the processes used to manufacture goods, such as steel, iron, metal products, leather, paper, foodstuffs, and textiles, as well as the management practices linked to production and operations. In short, positive technology shocks in electrical and automotive, linked as they were with new products, should have caused employment to rise more than similar shocks in manufacturing/machinery.  \n\nOur results confirm these expectations. Although, as we noted, productivity was significantly affected by innovations in all these groups, their impacts on labor inputs and unemployment were different. Technical change in automotive and electrical/electronics Granger-caused changes in the labor market variables (see appendix B), but there is virtually no evidence that manufacturing/mechanical innovations (with the exception of those in transportation) significantly contributed to increases in employment, hours, or the number of unemployed workers.  \n\nThe variance decompositions reported in table 2 in panel A show a similar pattern. Thus, while new automotive and electrical technologies explain a significant share of the variations in employment, hours and unemployment at three-, six-, and nine-year horizons across all labor market variables, the same cannot be said for manufacturing/machinery. In more detail, electrical technologies account for $15.6\\%$ to $18.4\\%$ of the variance in aggregate labor input at the six-year horizon, $14\\%$ of the variance in unemployment, $18\\%$ in manufacturing employment, and $19.4\\%$ in transportation employment. For automotive technologies, the comparable numbers are $38.8\\%$ for manufacturing employment and $44\\%$ for transportation. In contrast, fuctuations attributable  to  manufacturing/machinery  technical  change  are much smaller for aggregate employment and hours across all horizons and groupings, with the exception of transportation, and, to a lesser extent aggregate per capita unemployment.  \n\nThe impulse responses to a $1\\%$ positive technology shock along with the $90\\%$ confidence intervals shown in figure 5 tell a similar story. For example, aggregate employment rises significantly following a technology shock in both electrical/electronic and automotive; in the former, the effect lasts five years and peaks after one or two periods; in the latter, the peak is reached in two to three years. In contrast, the hypothesis that aggregate employment is unaffected by a manufacturing/mechanical technology  shock cannot be rejected.  \n\nFor the cases of total hours and unemployment, the results are similar. That is, the responses are statistically significant for automotive and electrical/electronic shocks but insignificant for mechanical/machinery shocks. Per capita hours go up, and unemployment, per capita falls in the short run, and a comparison with the previous results reveals that total hours worked rise more than employment, suggesting technology shocks in these cases also cause hours per employee to increase. Finally, for manufacturing and transportation sectors, in all cases bar one (manufacturing employment following a manufacturing/mechanical shock), responses are both positive and significant.  \n\nTo check the robustness of our results across different time periods and to determine if they are primarily driven by the onset of the Great Depression or World War II, we examine the response of employment to an aggregate GPT shock (created using the sum of the automotive and electrical titles as the technology indicator) for four different subperiods: 1909 to 1933, 1931 to 1949, 1919 to 1941, and 1919 to 1949. The results (found in panel D of figure 3) demonstrate that employment rises following a positive GPT shock in all subperiods. However, it is difficult to argue that our overall results are driven by the early years of the Great Depression given that the 1909-1933 results (which include the onset of the Great Depression) produce an insignificant response, while the 1931-1949 results (which exclude it) are positive and significant. World War $\\mathrm{II}$ is also not solely responsible, since the responses for the interwar period are also positive and significant. Instead, it appears that our overall results for 1909 to 1949 are a consequence of the positive, significant relationship that emerges after World War 1.  \n\n### C.Business Failures Meet GPT Shocks  \n\nDo GPTs and near-GPTs have different effects on business failures? The answer is quantitatively yes and qualitatively no. The reasons for the differences, once again, are linked to the process/product distinction. We first briefly outline our results and then propose a way to interpret them. The bivariate VARs displayed in panel A of figure 4 show that a $1\\%$ increase in any type of technology shock causes business failures to decline for five to eight years, with the major drop occurring two to four years following the shock. Moreover, a $1\\%$ positive manufacturing/mechanical technology shock causes a full $1\\%$ decline in failures, whereas a similar-sized automotive or electrical shock has only half this impact. The impact of the shocks, in short, does seem to differ.  \n\nThe variance decompositions, found in panel A of table 4, confirm this pattern. Manufacturing/mechanical technologies account for a significant portion of the variation in business failures during this time $32\\%$ and $47\\%$ at the three- and nine-year horizons, respectively) compared with those attributable to electrical $9\\%$ and $13\\%$ at three- and nine-year horizons, respectively) and automotive ( $9\\%$ and $31\\%$ ). Why the differences? Process innovations, a predominant feature of mechanical/manufacturing technologies, save labor and should unambiguously boost profit margins and survival rates. The effect of product innovations is less clear-cut. They may open up new markets and enhance profits, but they may also increase competition and cut into profitable existing lines of business. For this reason, new product-heavy automotive and electrical technologies are likely to have a more nuanced impact on the bottom line, and thus a moderate effect on business failures.  \n\n### D.Trivariate VARs: GPT versus Non-GPT  \n\nIn this section we focus sharply on the GPT/non-GPT distinction in an effort to see if such a division alters our results. Since GPTs, almost by definition, have an impact on non-GPTs, the best way to clarify the issue is through the estimation of a series of trivariate VARs that include, in the following order, the variable of interest such as productivity, one of the labor market variables or business failures, aggregate GPT (based on automotive and electrical books), and non-GPT (created by excluding the automotive and electrical counts from the total technology measure). The shocks are identified using a Cholesky decomposition, where the ordering reflects the pervasive nature of GPTs: it allows commercialized GPTs to affect non-GPTs within the year, but lags the possible impact of latter on the former. As before, we include a quadratic time trend and the education variable, and we normalize by children's titles.  \n\nThe variance decomposition results from the trivariate VARs, presented in the B panels of tables 1, 2, and 4, show the following. GPTs account for a substantial share of the variances in labor productivity $23.5\\%$ at the six-year horizon) and TFP $(33.5\\%)$ , while the effect of non-GPTs is negligible. The same holds true for the labor market variables. The lion's share of the variance is attributable to GPTs at all horizons, while non-GPTs have almost no impact. At the three-year horizon, the smallest share for the variables considered is found in the case of transportation employment $(11.2\\%)$ , with the largest share being seen in the case of manufacturing employment $(22.4\\%)$ , with the shares at the nine-year horizon ranging from a low of $17.5\\%$ (transportation) to a high of $31\\%$ (in manufacturing). In contrast, the shares attributable to non-GPT technologies remain under $2\\%$ for all variables. The only dissenting voice comes from business failures where GPTs and non-GPTs have almost identical impacts, suggesting that technological advances in general boost business success. Specifically, $7.6\\%$ and $10.4\\%$ of the variation of business failures at the three-year horizon can be attributed to non-GPTs and GPTs, respectively, with these shares rising to $15.6\\%$ and $13.4\\%$ by the nine-year horizon.  \n\n![](images/e47d393ae9f540141ac45ddb08699389aafe2144d8f8fa1486df2b32b611db57.jpg)  \nEach panel displays the response to a $1\\%$ positive technologyshockand the $90\\%$ confidence interval.

A $1\\%$ positive GPT shock raises labor and total factor productivity significantly for approximately five years, with the peak impact (over a $0.1\\%$ increase for labor productivity and $0.07\\%$ rise in TFP) occurring after two years. Non-GPT shocks have an insignificant effect on productivity. These patterns hold for the impact of the shocks on the labor market. A $1\\%$ GPT shock has a significant impact on all variables for five to six years, with peak increases, coming after two years, of approximately a $0.05\\%$ in total employment per capita, $0.1\\%$ in per capita private employment, $0.125\\%$ in hours per capita, and a peak decline of $0.7\\%$ in unemployment per capita. Manufacturing employment per capita rises over $0.2\\%$ ，with the response of transportation employment being about $0.11\\%$ . The responses to non-GPT shocks are again insignificant. The outlier is once more business failures, where, as panel C in figure 4 demonstrates, they significantly decline in response to both types of technology shocks.  \n\nCounterfactuals. In this section, we reconfigure counterfactuals we first used in Alexopoulos and Cohen (2009) in an attempt to disentangle the roles played by GPT, nonGPT, and nontechnology shocks in the economic fuctuations between 1929 and 1941—in others words, during the years of misery and recovery. We focus on three counterfactuals across four variables (TFP, per capita employment, unemployment, and hours worked) making use of a fourvariable VAR that includes, in the following order, TFP, private employment, the GPT measure, and the non-GPT index, along with a quadratic trend and the education variable. The results appear in figure 7. In the first counterfactual, we ask what path the economy would have taken had it not been hit by any shocks and if GPTs and non-GPTs were held at their average for the five years 1925 to 1929.26 As it happens, the news is both good and bad, depending on one's point of view. First, in the absence of shocks, while the large decrease in productivity that occurred in the early 1930s would have been nullified, the same is also true for the recovery so that by 1941, TFP would have been $7.9\\%$ below that actually achieved.27 Second, while employment per capita would have resisted the precipitous fall that actually took place during the dark days of the Depression, it wouldhavebeen $13.5\\%$ less than its actual value in 1941.  \n\n![](images/1f373692b8e93532ced9ff291233136c4603720df8aeadb13f7cb00e1fff5c4b.jpg)  \nEach panel displays the yearly response to a $1\\%$ positivetechnologyshockwith $90\\%$ confidence intervals. Trivariate VARs order variable of interest, GPT indicator, non-GPT technology measure. All VARs nclude a quadratic time trend and a measure of high school completion. Shocks are identified using a Cholesky decomposition. The VARs are based on annual data covering the period 1909-1949.  \n\nIn the second iteration, we again hold the technology variables at their five-year pre-Depression averages, but we now allow nontechnology shocks to hit the economy. In keeping with Alexopoulos and Cohen. (2009), we find that the onset of the Great Depression is attributable primarily to nontechnology shocks; absent the changes in technology that actually took place in the late 1930s, the productivity and labor market variables would have remained severely depressed. In particular, TFP and employment per capita would have been, respectively, $9.2\\%$ ,and $10.3\\%$ lower than their actual 1941 values. Positive technology shocks, in short, may not have caused the downturn, but they certainly contributed to the recovery.  \n\nIn the third simulation, we assume that all variables (including the technology indicators) evolve from 1929 to 1941 according to the equations estimated in the fourvariable VAR, but that only nontechnology shocks and GPT shocks hit the economy. With GPTs allowed to work their magic, the predicted paths closely track the actual ones. All the variables recover from drops in the early 1930s, and by 1941, the counterfactual values for TFP and employment per capita deviate from their actual levels by less than $0.3\\%$ . Overall, the counterfactuals suggest that (a) the onset of the Great Depression was primarily caused by nontechnology shocks; (b) GPT shocks, especially in the late 1930s, played a major role in the economy's recovery; and (c) non-GPT shocks assumed minor roles in the drama.  \n\nNot only did technology matter for the recovery; it also mattered what kind of technology.28  \n\n## V. Conclusion  \n\nThe impact, if any, of technical change on employment is hardly a new issue—the idea that machines replace men dates back at least to early eighteenth-century England, if not earlier—-but it has resisted satisfactory quantitative analysis because of the well-known difficulties in measuring technical change. The usual suspects are, for various reasons, not up to the task. Total factor or labor productivity provide at best indirect (and quite noisy) indicators of technical change, while the traditional direct measures, such as patents, research and development expenditures, and innovation counts, are dogged by a variety of problems. We develop in this paper new indicators of technical change that, we believe, are exempt from most of these difficulties and use them to explore the relationship between innovation and employment for the period 1909 to 1949. Our findings help inform model selection and clarify the role of technical change in cyclical fluctuations.  \n\nTo summarize briefly, we find a positive relationship between technology shocks and employment at both annual and monthly frequencies in both the short and medium run. Moreover, this result is insensitive to choice of time period  \n\n![](images/51a7df9988dc5be66107675c6fba765de774802482e22c034d90a78cdccf09fc.jpg)  \nFIGURE 7.COUNTERFACTUALS FOR TFP AND EMPLOYMENT PER CAPITA, 1929-1941  \n\nOverall, these findings may have implications for current concerns about jobless recoveries and technological unemployment. Although speculative at this point (but not entirely without foundation), it may well be that the jobless recoveries from recent downturns, including, of course, the Great Recession, have been associated with substantial advances in labor-saving technologies (including managerial), which would have boosted productivity but not employment. And for the same reason that Roosevelt worried that technical change in the mid-1930s was destroying jobs, process-based advances today may appear to be doing the same. We leave verification of this hypothesis for future research.  \n\n![](images/d66ab842f586712295941fb9ce4b60d4f2ceec399c63a718343186092fc9ebef.jpg)  \nCalculations are based on a four-variable VAR estimated with annual data from 1909 to 1949. Shocks are identified using a Cholesky decomposition. In the VAR, the variables are ordered as follows: TFP, employment per capita, the GPT indicator, and the non-GPT technology measure. All VARs include a quadratic time trend and a measure of high school completion.  \n\nand to changes in the exchange rate regime, the regulatory environment, and monetary policy. The economy's response to technology shocks during this time period therefore would appear to be more consistent with the predictions of a neoclassical than of a New Keynesian model. This would seem to suggest that the RBC benchmark that Cole and Ohanian (2004) used to critique the New Deal policies may be superior to the one Eggertson (2006) used to praise them.  \n\nAside from the issue of model selection, our results support the notion that technologies are not equal when it comes to their impact on the labor market. Positive GPT shocks had a much more powerful impact on employment and other labor market variables than near or non-GPT shocks. Since we have reason to believe that the GPTs during this time period were relatively product intensive, this would seem to imply, in keeping with the industrial organization literature, that product innovations create jobs, while process advances create efficiencies but may reduce employment opportunities. The links we found between business failures and types of technology shocks would seem to lend credibility to these observations.  \n\n# REFERENCES  \n\nAbernathy, W., K. Clark, and A.

HAN KIM  \n\n## ABSTRACT  \n\nOur results highlight the importance of interaction among management, labor, and investors in shaping corporate governance. We find that strong union laws protect not only workers but also underperforming managers. Weak investor protection combined with strong union laws are conducive to worker-management alliances, wherein poorly performing firms sell assets to prevent large-scale layoffs, garnering worker support to retain management. Asset sales in weak investor protection countries lead to further deteriorating performance, whereas in strong investor protection countries they improve performance and lead to more layoffs. Strong union laws are less effective in preventing layoffs when financial leverage is high.  \n\nMUCH OF THE RESEARCH IN LAW AND FINANCE FOCUSES on the role of legal protection of investors in shaping corporate governance.1 However, investors are but one of many stakeholders. Other stakeholders who participate in governance include labor and management. Labor receives legal protection with substantial variation across countries, and its self-interests often conflict with those of investors, at least in the short run. How do firms respond to these conflicting interests? The answer depends on stakeholders' relative influence on the decision making process, which varies across countries due to political and social factors (Roe (2003)). When investors have greater influence, higher priority is given to enhancing capital value. When labor has greater influence, employee welfare may receive higher priority over value enhancement (Tirole (2001)).  \n\nThis paper investigates how the two stakeholders’ relative influence and firm-level variables interact to affect restructuring decisions when firms suffer a sudden, sharp deterioration in operating performance. We proxy for stakeholders? relative influence at the country level by the strength oflegal protection of investors and labor, using measures compiled by Djankov et al. (2005), Djankov, McLiesh, and Shleifer (2006), and Botero et al. (2004). We examine firms at the onset of declining performance in order to avoid firms with prolonged poor performance that may already have undertaken restructuring measures. Our focus on poorly performing firms is motivated by the possibility that conflicts among stakeholders become more acute when the size of the economic pie shrinks. However, it is not obvious how such conflicts affect the nature and the likelihood of restructuring. On the one hand, conflicts may lead to further deterioration of the firm; on the other hand, the stakeholders may rally around the crisis to improve the firm's chance of survival.  \n\nWe consider three types of restructuring measures: large-scale employee layoffs, top management turnover, and major asset sales. Previous studies suggest that each ofthese improves stock price and subsequent operating performance.2 However, part or all of the shareholder gains may arise at the expense of other stakeholders (Shleifer and Summers (1988)). The sacrificing stakeholders may therefore seek to block these restructuring measures. For example, workers may object to investors’ attempts to replace underperforming management if they fear a new management team would slash jobs, wages, and benefits. If labor laws grant sufficient power to workers to block such actions, the incumbent management may form an alliance with workers to maintain the status quo by forgoing value-enhancing restructuring measures resisted by workers.  \n\nWe argue such an alliance is plausible in countries with strong union power and weak investor protection and discuss the economic links between the competing incentives of management, labor, and investors. The theoretical discussion leads to testable hypotheses about how the nature and the likelihood of restructuring decisions are affected by the relative legal strength of labor visa-vis investors. We test the hypotheses on a sample of 9,923 firms (10,947 firmyears) at the onset of sharply declining operating performance in 41 developed and emerging economies over the period 1993 to 2004.  \n\nWe find that poorly performing firms in stronger investor protection countries are more likely to undertake large-scale worker layoffs and replace top management than those in weaker investor protection countries. These restructuring actions are followed by superior operating performance in all legal environments. Major asset sales are different, however. We observe more asset sales when investor protection is either very strong or very weak. Asset sales in strong investor protection countries are followed by superior operating performance, whereas asset sales in weak investor protection countries are followed by inferior subsequent operating performance.3  \n\nThe likelihood of value-reducing asset sales increases as collective bargaining and labor relations laws grant more power to labor unions, suggesting that these asset sales are countenanced by workers. In addition, underperforming top managers in low investor protection countries are more likely to retain their jobs as union power increases. These results point toward management-worker alliances motivated by a mutual desire to retain jobs. For such an alliance to work, management needs funds to minimize layoffs and wage cuts. Lacking other means to raise the necessary funds, poorly performing firms sell assets to forestall layoffs even when doing so hurts subsequent operating performance. Indeed, asset sales in weak investor protection countries do not lead to layoffs, whereas in strong investor protection countries asset sales predict layoffs.  \n\nOther interpretations of our results include: (1) asset markets are undeveloped in weak investor protection countries; (2) assets are sold at fire sales to pay off creditors; and (3) poorly performing managers blame strong unions to avoid accountability. Although these stories partially explain our results, none is fully consistent with the data. We also show that our results concerning layoffs and asset sales are not explained by differences in conditions existing prior to performance declines.  \n\nAnother important facet of labor laws relates to employment contract laws. Rigid employment laws make it difficult for a firm to adjust labor costs. When a firm bears a negative revenue shock, the firm's inability to make adequate adjustments to its labor costs exacerbates the decline in the value ofits assets. Firms operating with this imposed inflexibility may sell their most affected divisions and assets to other firms that can either circumvent the labor regulation or find higher-valued uses through synergies. Consistent with this conjecture, we observe more major asset sales when employment laws are more protective.  \n\nFirm-level variables also matter in restructuring decisions. Firms with higher leverage are more likely to undertake all three types of restructuring. This disciplining role of leverage shows more bite when investor protection is stronger. More interesting, strong union laws are less effective in preventing large-scale layoffs when firms have higher financial leverage. Ownership concentration also is positively related to all three types of restructuring. For management turnover, the positive relation is significant only when top managers are not major shareholders: A major shareholder-manager is not likely to dismiss herself for poor performance. Asset sales exhibit a similar pattern: Major shareholdermanagers are less likely to sell assets, perhaps because they are reluctant to reduce private benefits associated with a larger asset base.  \n\nIn Section I, we discuss relevant theoretical issues and develop the hypotheses. Section II describes the empirical design, sample construction, and data. Section IHI presents empirical results and robustness checks. We make concluding remarks in Section IV.  \n\n## I. Legal Environment and Restructuring Decisions: Development of Hypotheses  \n\nTo analyze the economic links between the competing incentives of workers, investors, and management of poorly performing firms, we assume that (1) shareholders and creditors share a common objective to preserve and enhance capital value,4 (2) top management and workers want to retain their jobs, and (3) top managers are opportunistic, weighing the relative influence of investors and workers and siding with the group that can best help them retain their own jobs.  \n\nWhen firms suffer from poor operating performance, shareholders may pressure management to undertake restructuring actions to improve firm performance. Creditors also may demand corrective measures, especially when debt covenants are violated (Roberts and Sufi (2006)). Whether these demands will be executed depends on the firm's governance. If the firm is investor friendly, it is likely to undertake value-enhancing measures; if it is worker friendly, the firm may refrain from actions deemed detrimental to employee welfare.  \n\nWhether governance favors investors or workers is determined by both firmand country-specific factors (Durnev and Kim (2005). We first consider country factors, as proxied by investor and labor protection laws. We hypothesize that layoffs are more likely with stronger investor protection and weaker union laws. Large-scale worker layoffs tend to lead to direct conflicts between investors and workers. Opportunistic top managers facing potential dismissal for poor performance will weigh the relative influence of investors and workers and side with those with greater influence.  \n\nHow the legal environment affects management turnover is less straightforward. Although the literature has focused on investors’ abilities to remove underperforming managers, workers also can influence the outcome. Replacing top management is an attempt by investors or workers to change the direction of the firm by bringing in new leadership. If a change is necessary for value enhancement, stronger investor rights should increase the likelihood of top management turnover. Workers will not oppose changes if the new management is expected to get the firm out of trouble without employee sacrifice. However, poor performance may be due partly to managers? tendencies to overpay workers (Bertrand and Mullainathan (1999)) and their reluctance to trim an unproductive workforce, because of their desire for the quiet life (Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003)). Workers will be protective of such labor-friendly management because new managers brought in to improve performance may force layoffs and reduce wages.  \n\nManagers may even collude with workers for mutual protection. Pagano and Volpin (2005) develop a model in which managers collude with workers by bribing them with above market wages to thwart hostile takeover attempts. This collusion hypothesis is supported by evidence provided in Rauh (2006) and Kim and Ouimet (2008).5 Similar collusion is possible when firms suffer poor performance. Facing potential dismissal for poor performance, top managers may form an alliance with labor by abstaining from worker layoffs and wage cuts. Workers, in turn, may help retain such managers if they have sufficient power to affect the decision.  \n\nWorkers influence management retention through several channels. Botero et al. (2004) state “workers, or unions, or both have a right to appoint members to the Board of Directors\" (p. 1349) in Austria, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Germany, Norway, Slovenia, and Sweden. Such board representation gives labor a direct means to influence managerial compensation and retention. For example, German firms with more than 2,0o0 employees are required to have $50\\%$ worker representation on their supervisory boards responsible for selecting chief executives and reviewing their performance.6 In fact, Botero et al. include the right to board representation as a measure of the strength of union power in their labor law index.  \n\nWorkers also indirectly influence top management retention. They may attempt to retain labor-friendly management by opposing liquidation in favor of reorganization with current management intact, or they may lobby for government bailouts to curtail the urgency for layoffs and management turnover. To achieve these goals, workers may organize strikes against mergers or other methods designed to introduce new management. These direct and indirect worker influences should be more effective when workers are empowered through strong union laws.  \n\nAn alliance between top management and workers may not result from explicit collusion. Managers simply may feel reluctant to cut wages or fire workers with whom they have developed working relationships. This reluctance would be reinforced when unions have the legal means to prevent investor attempts to oust incumbent management. These implicit alliances are expected to be more effective in preventing management turnover in countries with stronger labor union power and weaker investor protection.  \n\nThe recent Volkswagen scandal in Germany, a country with strong union laws,7 illustrates such a management-labor alliance. Volkswagen's top management was under pressure from investors for the firm's poor operating performance: Its EBITDA to total assets ratio was the lowest among the four major automakers in Germany over the 2002 to 2005 period, and it was 13th out of 17 major automakers worldwide over the 2003 to 2005 period.8 In 2005, German state prosecutors accused the top managers of bribery for paying labor representatives on its supervisory board as much as $\\$36,000$ per individual for in employee compensation following the adoption of large-scale employee stock ownership plans. The compensation increases are concentrated in firms incorporated in states with business combination statutes, which make Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) more effective antitakeover device against hostile takeover attempts.  \n\n6 The supervisory board has the power to appoint and dismiss management board members, who report to the supervisory board in the two-tiered board system. See Gorton and Schmid (2oo0) and Fauver and Fuerst (2006) for further discussion of the German board system.  \n\n7 The strength of German union laws ranks seventh among our sample of 41 countries, while the strength of its investor protection is slightly below the median (see Table I).  \n\n8 The other German automakers are BMW, DaimlerChrysler, and Porsche, and the worldwide list includes Fiat, Ford, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Peugeot, Renault, Suzuki, and Toyota.  \n\npleasure trips to Brazil in return for their support. According to a July18, 2005 Business Week article,\"CEOs and top managers depend on votes from the labor reps to be reappointed. Instead of making tough decisions on restructuring or job cuts, German managers are inclined to delay or avoid change and instead curry favor with union bosses sitting on their boards, often to the detriment of their companies\"(52).  \n\nThe third type of restructuring, asset sales, is generally considered to enhance value. If a firm sells assets to redeploy underutilized resources to higher-valued uses, asset sales should increase shareholder value. Workers, on the other hand, will resist asset sales if they lead to layoffs or diminish the value of their future claims, such as underfunded health-care and pension liabilities.  \n\nWorkers may not resist asset sales, however, if the sales are part of a delaying tactic to maintain the status quo through a management-worker alliance. To avoid wage cuts and worker layoffs, management may have to sell assets. Because poorly performing firms are typically cash constrained, selling underperforming assets may not be sufficient. They may have to resort to selling assets even if doing so destroys synergies with the remaining assets, thereby reducing value. Even when assets are sold at the fair market value without affecting synergies, using the proceeds to delay necessary cuts in payroll will reduce value. Value-reducing asset sales will be blocked by investors if they have the ability to do so.  \n\nSince a management-worker alliance requires strong union power, the likelihood of value-reducing asset sales is greater in countries with weaker investor protection and stronger union laws. Conversely, value-enhancing asset sales are more likely in countries with stronger investor protection and weaker union laws.  \n\nValue-reducing asset sales represent a governance failure. They exacerbate poor operating performance, eventually hurting most stakeholders in the long run, including workers. There are two possible reasons for such a governance failure. First, if a great deal of uncertainty surrounds exogenous variables affecting operating performance, managers and workers may rationally decide on costly delaying actions that would allow them to wait for an outcome, albeit with a low probability, which will more than make up for the value lost due to asset sales. This is analogous to Jensen and Meckling's (1976) asset substitution hypothesis in which shareholders may choose a higher risk, lower NPV project. Delays may also provide managers and workers time to locate alternative jobs.  \n\nThe second reason for a governance failure is a behavioral bias based on the theory that people delay immediate-cost activities and engage in immediatereward activities too soon (O'Donoghue and Rabin (1999)). That is, management delays restructuring decisions with immediate cost to workers and managers even though doing so may lead to an even worse outcome. One way to avoid such a governance failure is for management and workers to bond themselves to actions expected in strong investor protection and weak union law countries. However, Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2007) argue, with supporting evidence, that such mechanisms are either unavailable or prohibitively expensive in countries with poor investor protection.  \n\nTo summarize the main hypotheses, we list the likelihood of each restructuring measure for different combinations of investor protection and labor union laws:  \n\nThe Likelihood of Restructuring under Different Legal Regimes   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Investor Protection</td><td>Union Laws</td><td>Employee Layoffs</td><td>Management Turnover</td><td>Value-Enhancing Asset Sales</td><td>Value-Reducing AssetSales</td></tr><tr><td>Strong</td><td>Weak</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>Weak</td><td>Strong</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNote that these predictions apply only to union laws. Employment contract laws are another important component of labor laws that may affect restructuring decisions. Botero et al. (2004) construct an index measuring the rigidity of employment laws, which includes the costs of hiring and firing workers, reducing wages, and changing working hours. We hypothesize that inflexible employment laws encourage asset sales during corporate distress. Consider a firm suffering a sharp drop in revenue. If inflexible laws prevent the firm from making the necessary cut in labor costs, the value of its assets utilizing the workforce will decline. The firm may be able to realize higher values by selling the affected assets to other firms that can find a means to circumvent the regulation or redeploy the assets to higher-valued uses.  \n\n### I1. Empirical Design, Sample Construction, and Data  \n\n#### A. Empirical Design  \n\nWe estimate country random effects logit regression models. The dependent variable is equal to one if there are large-scale layoffs, management turnover, or major asset sales. The independent variables are investor protection, labor laws, financial leverage, and ownership concentration. Control variables are firm size and the previous year's operating performance. We include leverage because Ofek (1993) and Kang and Shivdasani (1997) find that leverage increases investors' ability to force large-scale layoffs and management turnover. Ownership concentration is included because it helps shareholders internalize the benefits oftaking action. We expect ownership concentration to be positively related to value-enhancing restructuring actions.  \n\nWe also account for the interactions between leverage and investor protection, and leverage and labor laws. The disciplining role of leverage should depend on the legal protection of creditors and shareholders because strong creditor rights make the threat of bankruptcy more credible, while strong shareholder rights make it more likely for firms to take advantage of the threat of bankruptcy. Thus, we expect the leverage effect to be stronger as investor protection increases.  \n\nLeverage also has a role in strengthening shareholders bargaining position vis- $\\grave{\\cdot}\\grave{\\mathbf{a}}$ -vis labor. Bronars and Deere (1991) show that financial leverage reduces the power of labor unions because the increased threat of bankruptcy due to leverage makes it easier to extract concessions from unions. Thus, we hypothesize that the ability of union laws to deter layoffs and asset sales becomes weaker with higher financial leverage.  \n\nLabor laws consist of two components: union laws and employee contract laws. They have a correlation coefficient of0.3264. Correlations among investor protection, the interaction terms, and the labor variables are all high. In order to properly identify the coefficients on the labor variables, regressions are estimated separately for each.  \n\nFor all specifications we perform the Breusch and Pagan (1980) test. The test statistics suggest the presence of unobserved country-level heterogeneity. Thus, when regressions contain country-level explanatory variables, we use country random effects; otherwise, we use country fixed effects. We also use year fixed effects to control for possible macroeconomic factors (e.g., financial crises and recessions) and industry fixed effects at the two-digit SIC level to control for industry-wide factors affecting restructuring decisions.9 Following Norton, Wang, and Ai (2004), we correct the coefficients on the interaction terms for the nonlinearity of the logit specification.  \n\n#### B. Sample Construction  \n\nThe primary source of our firm-level data is Worldscope. We identify 25,698 industrial companies with sufficient data to conduct our tests from 41 countries over the period 1993 to 2004.10 From these firms we look for initially healthy firms that suffered a sharp drop in operating performance, measured by EBITDA/TA, where EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, and TA is total assets. Table I contains the descriptions of all variables used in the paper. We use an accounting-based measure of operating performance instead of a stock price-based measure, because stock markets are forward looking and market values reflect the likelihood to undertake restructuring measures. For example, a more shareholder-friendly company may experience a smaller drop in valuation for the same decline in operating performance because of higher anticipation of value-enhancing restructuring.  \n\nFor layoffs and asset sales, our definition of poorly performing firms follows Kang and Shivdasani (1997). We require that the company initially have a positive, above-industry median EBITDA/TA in the base year and experience a drop of more than $50\\%$ in EBITDA in the following year. This selection procedure yields 8,493 companies (10,904 firm-years).  \n\nTo identify poorly performing top management, we use a different criterion based on a relative performance measure. Consider the airline industry, which suffered a big drop in EBITDA after 9/11. When all airlines suffer losses, the performance of an airline's CEO should be judged relative to that of her rivals, not by an absolute measure. Thus, we follow Denis and Kruse (2ooo) and classify top management as underperforming if a company's EBITDA/TA is initially above the industry median and falls to the bottom quartile of its industry in the following year.11 This yields 6,988 firms (7,358 firm-years) with underperforming management. As a robustness check, we repeat the analyses using a sample based on the absolute measure of a $50\\%$ drop in EBITDA for management turnover. The conclusions do not change.  \n\nTable I Variable Descriptions   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variable</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>Antidirector</td><td>Legalvariables(Ahigherscoreindicatesstrongerlegalprotection) Equal to the sum of six subindices at the country level that assess the possibility of proxy voting by mail, blocking shares before a shareholder meeting, cumulative voting, oppressed minority, preemptive rights, and the percentage of share capital required to call an extraordinary shareholder meeting (measured at the countrylevel,time invariant).</td></tr><tr><td>Anti-self-dealing</td><td>(Source:Djankovetal.(2005)) Measures the amount of disclosurebefore and after the transaction has occurred, the need for approval by disinterested shareholders, and litigation governing a specific self-dealing transaction (measured at the</td></tr><tr><td>Shareholder</td><td>country level,time invariant).(Source:Djankov et al.(2005)) Equal to the sum of normalized values of Antidirector and</td></tr><tr><td>Creditor</td><td>Anti-self-dealing.(Source:Djankov et al.(2005)) Evaluates whether there is no automatic stay on assets, whether secured creditors are paid first,whether there are restrictions on going into</td></tr><tr><td>Lawandorder</td><td>(measured at the country level, annual frequency, lagged by one period).

However, a key distinguishing characteristic in legal environments across countries is accounting standards; thus, to some extent, our country-level measures of investor and labor protection control for such differences. Additionally, within-country industry indicator variables help control for different accounting practices across industries. Any remaining noise would weaken the power of our tests. Nevertheless, we conduct a robustness check by using different cutoff points to construct the sample (i.e., a $30\\%$ and $40\\%$ dropinsteadofthe $50\\%$ drop in EBITDA/TA). The main results are robust to different cutoff points.  \n\n#### C. Measures of Corporate Restructuring  \n\nOur measures of top management turnover, large-scale employee layoffs, and major asset sales are not as refined as those used in single-country studies.12 Our study covers 41 countries and news searches for information in non-English speaking countries would require knowledge of local languages.13 Thus, we construct management turnover from data on top executive names provided by Worldscope. This variable takes the value of one for year $t$ if the top two executives in year $t-1$ do not appear as executives in year $t$ or year $t+1$ ， where year $t$ is the distress year. We use the removal of the top two officers rather than only the top officer for two reasons. First, the turnover is more likely to be forced rather than voluntary if the two top executives leave the company. Second, Worldscope provides only officer titles, which are not uniform across countries. Because it is sometimes difficult to identify the top officer by title alone, we take this more conservative approach. For a robustness check, we require that all three top executives in year $t-1$ do not appear as executives in year $t$ or year $t+1$ . The results are similar. We include year $t+1$ because replacing top management may take time.  \n\nThe variable Layoffs takes the value of one if a company experiences more than a $20\\%$ drop in the number of employees from year $t-1$ to year $t$ or $^{t+}$ 1. The variable Asset sales takes a value of one if a company experiences more than a $15\\%$ drop in its NPPE from year $t-1$ to year $t$ or $t+1$ .Althoughthese  \n\n12 We exclude financial restructuring such as debt renegotiation, debt forgiveness, or debt equity swaps because they represent restructuring claims between investors without much direct involvement of workers. We also exclude bankruptcies and mergers because of data unavailability for the 41 countries. The impact of these omissions is likely to be very small. Only $1.58\\%$ ofoursample firms disappear during the year of distress $(0.61\\%)$ and the following year $(0.97\\%)$ ,whichmay be due to bankruptcy, mergers, or Worldscope's decision to stop covering them for other reasons. The low percentage of disappearance reflects the fact that the firms were outperforming their industry rivals prior to the year of distress and that the performance drop is sudden, not prolonged.  \n\n13 This language problem prevents us from examining the announcement effects of restructuring decisions. Unlike other international studies with identifiable dates through sources written in English (e.g., the listing date of foreign stocks in the U.S. by Foerster and Karolyi (1999)), identifying announcement dates for our sample of firms would require searching newspapers and media reports in the local language. This is practically impossible because of our large sample size covering 41 countries.  \n\ncutoff points are somewhat arbitrary, they are based on previous findings.14 For robustness we use different cutoff levels for Layoffs ( $15\\%$ or $25\\%$ decline in the number of employees) and Asset sales ( $10\\%$ or $20\\%$ reduction in NPPE) and find similar results. Because NPPE is measured in local currency, the changes are not affected by exchange rate changes.  \n\nThere may be other sources of noise in Layoffs. Hallock (1998) observes that the Compustat database does not record the changes in employment numbers as frequently as changes in financial variables, because personnel information is subject to looser reporting and auditing requirements than financial variables. If data for other countries have similar problems, our Layoffs may underestimate the true extent of employee reduction. This problem is somewhat mitigated by our inclusion of year $t+1$ in defining Layoffs. Any remaining underestimation weakens the power of our tests.  \n\nIt is also possible that accounting write-offs may lead to an overestimate of Asset sales. Our use of changes in NPPE to measure asset sales mitigates this problem because inventories and account receivables, which are often subject to write-offs, are excluded from the definition of NPPE. Write-offs due to a plant closure or to scrapping equipment also reduce NPPE; however, these actions are precisely what we want to capture as asset restructuring.  \n\n#### D. Legal Variables  \n\nOur measure of investor protection considers both the de jure and de facto aspects of regulation. We define the variable Shareholder to be equal to the sum of normalized values of the revised Antidirector index and the Anti-self-dealing index in Djankov et al. (2005). Both indices measure minority shareholder protection against controlling shareholders’ actions that would hurt shareholder value. We use the Djankov et al. (2006) creditor index, Creditor, for legal protection of creditor rights. This index is updated yearly. For these and all other legal variables, a higher number indicates stronger protection. These legal indices measure formal rules but enforcement of these rules varies across countries. The proxy for de facto regulation is based on the Law and Order variable, which is updated monthly. We take yearly averages of this index. Both Creditor and Law and Order are lagged by 1 year from the distress year.  \n\nThese four legal variables are normalized on a scale of zero to one and are reported in Table II for each country.15 Most of these variables are highly positively correlated with each other. To mitigate potential multicollinearity problems arising from these correlations and to combine their different attributes, we take the sum of their normalized values to create a single measure of investor protection, Financier, which also is reported in Table II. For a robustness check, we use only the revised Antidirector index or only the Antiself-dealing index with Creditor and Law and Order to measure Financier We also use the product of the four variables instead of their sum. The results are robust.  \n\nThe data for labor regulations come from Botero et al. (2004), who classify labor laws into three major country-level indices. The first index, Emp-Cont, measures the rigidity of employment contracts laws. The second index, Union, assesses the legal protection of labor unions and the regulation of collective disputes. Strong collective relations laws strengthen union power. The third index, Soc Sec, measures the strength of social security laws.16 Botero et al. (2004) show that social security laws are closely related to GDP per capita and reflect a country's level of economic development.17  \n\nThese labor law indices and their correlations with other legal variables are reported in Table II and Panel A of Table III, respectively. All labor indices are positively correlated with each other and are negatively correlated with almost all components of investor protection.  \n\n#### E.Firm-Level Variables  \n\nData for firm-level variables also come from Worldscope. We use the logarithm of sales to measure the size of the firm. Larger firms are more likely to be unionized, may be slower in reacting to external shocks, and have a better chance to be bailed out by the government during distress, all of which may affect restructuring decisions. Large firms also receive more public attention and are more likely to be covered by Worldscope. It also may be easier for smaller firmstolayoff $20\\%$ of employees and sell $15\\%$ ofassets.  \n\nOwnership data come from Worldscope, Amadeus, the ISI Emerging Markets Database, local stock exchanges, and company websites. We proxy for ownership concentration by the variable Own, the sum of the equity stakes of the three largest shareholders, each with more than $5\\%$ of the firm shares. None of the firms in our sample lists the government as a direct owner with more than $5\\%$ ownership. The ownership data for top executives is available only for 2002 to 2004. We average the 3 years and use it as a proxy for the actual managerial to changes in laws over time. Finally, to the extent that these time-invariant indices incorrectly measure the legal environment at the time of declining performance, the noise blurs the distinction in legal variables across countries, weakening the power of our tests.  \n\n16 We find no statistically significant relation between Soc Sec and the likelihood of any of the three restructuring measures. Consequently, we do not report results dealing with Soc _Sec.  \n\n17 GDP per capita is also closely related to the degree of stock market openness and Law and Order, which Table III shows is highly correlated with social security laws. Bekaert, Harvey, and Lundblad (2005) find that stock market liberalization leads to a $1\\%$ increasein annual economic growth and the effect is greater for countries with higher Law and Order.  \n\n# TableIII Correlations between Legal Variables and Summary Statistics of Firm Variables  \n\nPanel A shows correlations between legal variables.

Empirical Results  \n\n### A. Univariate Analysis  \n\nTo see how corporate restructuring decisions vary across legal environments, we divide the countries into quartiles in terms of legal protection of investors and labor. Table IV compares the average proportion of poorly performing firms undertaking layoffs, asset sales, and management turnover between the top and bottom quartiles. It reveals several noteworthy patterns.  \n\nFirst, large-scale layoffs and major asset sales are more frequent in countries with more rigid employment laws. Workers appear to fare worse during corporate distress under highly protective employment laws.  \n\nSecond, when union laws are strong, we observe significantly fewer employee layoffs and management turnovers, indicating that strong union laws increase job security not only for employees but also for underperforming managers. Strong union laws are also associated with more asset sales, implying that some asset sales are sanctioned by unions.  \n\nThird, strong investor protection is associated with more employee layoffs and increased management turnover, consistent with the notion that layoffs and management turnover are, in general, value enhancing. However, we observe significantly fewer asset sales in strong investor protection countries. This counters the widely held view that asset sales enhance value because we should observe more, not less, value-enhancing decisions when investors enjoy strong legal protection.  \n\nWe check whether this result on asset sales is related to our treatment of shareholders and creditors as one. Although shareholders and creditors share a common objective to enhance/preserve capital value, they may differ on the timing of asset sales because shareholders have convex claims on the cash flows whereas creditors have concave claims. Thus, we separate Financier into Shareholder and Creditor. We then examine the frequency of asset sales for different configurations of bottom and top quartiles by shareholder and creditor protection. That is, we conduct a $2\\times2$ analysis,where the rows represent the top and bottom quartiles of Creditor and the columns represent the top and bottom quartiles of Shareholder. We find no difference between firms in the top creditor and bottom shareholder protection quartiles and firms in the top shareholder and bottom creditor quartiles. Also, the firms in the top quartiles for both creditor and shareholder protection show significantly fewer asset sales than those in the bottom quartiles for both creditor and shareholder protection. In sum, the results on asset sales are insensitive to separate treatment of shareholder and creditor protection.  \n\n### B. Multivariate Analysis  \n\nIn this section, we investigate how the likelihood of each restructuring measure is related to the legal protection of investors and workers, leverage, and ownership concentration. We first report results concerning employee layoffs and management turnover, followed by asset sales. We also investigate how investor protection and union laws interact in affecting restructuring decisions.  \n\n#### B.1. Employee Layoffs and Management Turnover  \n\nTable V reports the results of country random effect logit regressions in which the dependent variable is equal to one if there are large-scale layoffs (Panel A) or if there is management turnover (Panel B). The effects of legal variables are largely consistent with the univariate results. Stronger investor protection is associated with a higher likelihood of layoffs and management turnover, demonstrating investors' greater ability to force poorly performing firms to cut labor costs and bring in new leadership. According to our estimates, a firm in the lowest quartile of investor protection has a $5.31\\%$ $(7.21\\%)$ likelihood of employee layoffs (management turnover), while an otherwise similar firm in the top quartile has a $9.83\\%$ $(9.50\\%)$ likelihood. Also as expected, the strength of collective relations laws (Union) is associated with a lower likelihood of employee layoffs. A firm in a bottom-quartile country in Union has a $10.25\\%$ likelihood of  \n\n# TableV Likelihood of Employee Layoffs or Management Turnover  \n\nPanel A shows results of country random effects logit regressions using employee layoffs as the dependent variable.

A firm in a bottomquartile country in Union has a $9.67\\%$ likelihood of management turnover, while an otherwise similar firm in the top quartile has a $7.62\\%$ likelihood of turnover. When estimated separately for low investor protection countries (in Table X), where a management-worker alliance is more likely, the difference becomes much larger.  \n\nThe results on the firm-specific variables indicate that both leverage and poor performance increase the likelihood of layoffs. Moreover, the interaction between Leverage and Financier is positive and significant for three of the four specifications. The disciplining role of leverage seems to have more bite with stronger investor protection.  \n\nOwnership concentration is positively and significantly related to layoffs, suggesting that concentrated ownership improves investors’ ability to reduce workforce during corporate distress. However, its coefficient on management turnover is mostly insignificant. We suspect the insignificance is due to some top managers also being large shareholders.20 Thus, we add a manager/owner indicator variable, Mgmt/Own, to the regressions in Table VI, which reports estimates for all three restructuring measures. Columns 3 and 4 indicate that management turnover is less likely when top officers are also major stockholders. The coefficient on Own becomes significant with Union, which controls for the negative correlation between Union and management turnover. Higher ownership concentration helps remove underperforming top managers only when they are not major shareholders.  \n\nThe last two columns in Table VI show that the management ownership indicator also has a significant negative effect on asset sales. Major shareholdermanagers seem to be less inclined to sell assets, perhaps because their private benefits of control decrease with fewer assets under their control.  \n\n#### B.2. Asset Sales  \n\nThe last two columns of Table VI also confirm the univariate finding that there are more asset sales in weaker investor protection countries. We entertain three possible explanations. First, assets are sold to finance the current payroll to appease workers in a management-worker alliance. Second, what appear to be asset sales is a diversion of corporate resources by management or controlling shareholders for their own private benefits. These types of asset grabbing (tunneling) are more likely in weak investor protection countries (Johnson et al. (2000), Shleifer and Wolfenzon (2002), Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2004), and Durnev and Kim (2005).  \n\nThird, firms in poor investor protection countries may be smaller and therefore more likely to sell assets during performance declines. This is unlikely because we control for firm size in the regression. The data also tell a different story: Our sample firms in poor investor protection countries are larger than those in strong protection countries, whether firm size is measured by total assets, sales, or the number of employees.21 Although this may be due to the way Worldscope selects companies from different countries, size cannot explain the negative relationbetween asset sales and investor protection.  \n\n# TableVI Likelihood of Layoffs, Management Turnover, or Asset Sales, Controlling for Major Shareholder-Top Manager  \n\nchis table reports the results of country random effects logit regressions using Layoffs, Managenent turnover, or Asset sales as the dependent variable, while controlling for major shareholder-top nanager:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle\\mathrm{Pr}(R_{i k}=1)=F(\\alpha+\\beta_{1}F i n a n c i e r_{k}+\\beta_{2}L a b o r_{k}+\\beta_{3}L e v_{i k}+\\beta_{4}O w n_{i k}+\\beta_{5}M g m t/O w n_{i k})}}\\ {{\\displaystyle\\qquad+\\sum_{j=6}^{7}\\beta_{j}X_{i k j}+\\varepsilon_{i k})}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $R_{i k}$ is a measure of restructuring: Layoffs in columns 1 and 2, Turnover in columns 3 and 4 and Asset Sales in columns 5 and 6.

Table VII, Panel A compares the change in performance of firms with asset sales to those without asset sales, for countries in the top and bottom quartile in investor protection. The change in performance is measured by subtracting the distress year's performance from the average performance in the 2-year period following the year of distress. The table shows the change in performance of the median firm, where performance is measured by EBITDA/TA (rows 1-3) and Sales/TA (rows 4-6), with rows 3 and 6 showing the difference in performance between the median firm with and the median firm without asset sales. We report the median firm because of high skewness. Comparing the mean firms leads to the same conclusions.  \n\nThe results are striking. In terms of operating profit (EBITDA/TA), the median firm with asset sales $(A S a l e s=1$ ) in the top financier quartile countries shows significant improvement in its postdistress performance, and the improvement is significantly greater than that for the median firm without asset sales $(A S a l e s=0$ 0. For the median firms in the bottom-quartile countries, the results are the opposite. The median firm with asset sales shows further deterioration in performance, whereas the median firm without asset sales shows significant improvement in postdistress performance. Comparing asset turnover (Sales/TA) yields similar patterns. Selling assets improves asset utilization (relative to firms without asset sales) in the top investor protection countries, and worsens asset utilization in the bottom investor protection countries.  \n\nFinally, these differences in subsequent performance seem to be related to the frequency of firms' disappearance from the sample. The last three rows show that in the bottom-quartile countries, significantly more firms with asset sales disappear from the sample than firms without asset sales. In the topquartile countries, there is no difference between firms with and without asset sales. The last column also shows that among the firms with asset sales, a significantly larger fraction of firms in the bottom quartile disappear from the sample than those in the top-quartile countries. These disappearances from the sample could be due to bankruptcy or mergers, although it is possible that Worldscope discontinues their coverage for other reasons.  \n\nTo check whether these results on asset sales are robust to controlling for other firm characteristics, we relate postdistress performance in terms of EBITDA/TA and Sales / TA to Asset sales, while controlling for firm size, leverage, ownership concentration, and performance during the distress year. The regressions are estimated separately for high and low investor protection countries (divided by the median). Unlike the other regressions, we use country fixed effects because none of the explanatory variables is measured at the country level.  \n\nPanel B of Table VII reports results with Asset sales, Layoffs, or Turnover as the key independent variable. The results on Asset sales are consistent with those in Panel A.22 Its coefficient is significantly negative for weak investor protection countries, whether the dependent variable is operating profit or asset turnover, confirming that these asset sales hurt a firm's subsequent operating performance. By contrast, the coefficient is significantly positive for strong investor protection countries for both dependent variables, implying that these asset sales improve subsequent operating performance.23  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Top Financier - Bottom Financier Bottom Financier Quartile</td><td>Difference 0.163***</td><td>0.104*** 0.099*** 0.059* 0.016*</td><td rowspan=\"2\">0.083*** 5.3%*** 1.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Avg Performance (t + 1, t + 2) - Performance (t) -0.041** 0.058***</td><td>-0.099*** -0.039*** -0.019* 0.013</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">Avg Performance (t + 1, t + 2) - Top Financier Quartile</td><td>Performance (t) 0.122*** 0.117**</td><td>0.005** 0.080** 0.029** 0.064**</td><td>-3.4% -4.2% 0.8%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>④</td><td>Percent Dropping from Sample E</td></tr><tr><td>Measure Asales = 1 EBITDA/TA Difference Sales/TA</td><td>Asales = 0 Asales = 1 Asales = 0 Difference</td><td>Asales = 1 Asales = 0</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"10\">Change in Sales/TA Change in EBITDA/TA Change in Sales/TA Change in EBITDA/TA Fin <Med (5) Fin > Med Change in Sales/TA Fin < Med (3) Change in</td><td>Fin > Med (12) Fin<Med (11)</td><td>-0.015*** 0.009* (0.073) (0.000) 0.034 (0.347) 0.089 0.005* (0.068) -0.008* (0.072) 0.045 (0.292) -0.073</td></tr><tr><td>Fin > Med (10) Fin <Med (6)</td><td>(0.284) 0.029* (0.058) -0.120*** 0.060* (0.066) (0.000) -0.259* (0.087) 0.094 (0.301) 0.012 (0.826)</td></tr><tr><td>0.183*</td><td>-0.152*** (0.059) (0.000) -0.001 (0.995) 0.289 (0.339) -0.012 (0.850) 1,390 0.048</td></tr><tr><td>Fin > Med (8) Fin <Med</td><td>-0.056*** 0.062*** 0.017 (0.671) (0.000) 0.054 (0.332) -0.102 (0.231) (0.001) 2,597 0.040</td></tr><tr><td>0.098* E</td><td>-0.061*** (0.050) (0.000) 0.021 (0.737) -0.058 (0.4.19) 0.034 (0.108) 1,996 0.053</td></tr><tr><td>Fin > Med 0.217** (9)</td><td>-0.136*** (0.000) -0.346** (0.013) 0.142 (0.482) -0.032 (0.493) 2,597</td></tr><tr><td>0.213* (0.072)</td><td>-0.129*** (0.000) 0.156 (0.295) 0.349 (0.201) -0.050 (0.320) 1,996 0.044</td></tr><tr><td>0.086* (0.093) (4)</td><td>-0.057*** 0.056*** (0.000) 0.056 (0.298) -0.087 (0.491) (0.001) 2,821 0.041</td></tr><tr><td>-0.019* (0.063)</td><td>-0.060*** (0.000) 0.036 (0.546) 0.109 (0.426) 0.034 (0.103) 2,097 0.050</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Fin > Med EBITDA/TA Fin < Med (1)</td><td>-0.139*** 0.126* (0.051) (0.000)</td><td>-0.242* (0.073) 0.127 (0.328) -0.070* (0.098) 2,821 0.037</td></tr><tr><td>-0.077* (0.058)</td><td>-0.124*** (0.000) -0.108 (0.451) 0.280 (0.387) 0.055 (0.267) 2,097 0.040</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Assetsales</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>urnover ayoffs ize</td><td>Performance observations everage UM 2</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\ns a ss ss jo pa  o ss si s px  si  d  \n\nThe results also show positive coefficients on Layoffs and Management turnover in both strong and weak investor protection countries. Unlike asset sales, the performance-improving effects of layoffs and management turnover do not depend on investor protection.24  \n\nBecause of the distinctly different effects of asset sales between strong and weak investor protection countries, we estimate the likelihood of asset sales separately for countries with above- and below-median investor protection. The results are reported in Table VIlI. They show that the relation between investor protection and the likelihood of asset sales differs sharply between the two sets of countries. The relation is significantly positive in strong investor protection countries and significantly negative in weak investor protection countries. There are more asset sales when investor protection is either very strong or veryweak.  \n\nThe table also shows that employment contract laws are significantly positively related to asset sales for both sets of countries, illustrating that inflexible employment laws encourage asset sales during distress. Our result parallels that of Besley and Burgess (2004), who find that Indian states with stronger labor regulations attract less investment. In our case the discouraging effect of employment laws on investment takes the form of more divestment of existing assets during distress.  \n\nThe interaction term between leverage and Financier switches signs depending on whether investor protection is high or low. In high investor protection countries, leverage improves investors’ ability to force value-enhancing asset restructuring. In low investor protection countries, the leverage effect seems to work to the detriment of investors. As leverage makes poorly performing firms more financially constrained, it reinforces the tendency to engage in valuereducing asset sales.  \n\n#### B.3.Interaction between Union Laws and Investor Protection  \n\nTable VIlI also shows that the relation between union laws and asset sales differs sharply depending on the strength of investor protection. With strong investor protection, strong union laws seem to discourage asset sales. With weak investor protection, stronger union laws lead to more asset sales, suggesting that workers sanction them because the proceeds help minimize layoffs and wagecuts.25  \n\nprotection. Perhaps smaller firms are better able to recover from distress because they tend to have higher managerial ownership, less unionized workforces, and more flexibility.  \n\n24 We also repeat the analysis in Panel A of Table VII for layoffs and management turnover. The results (unreported) confirm that both layoffs and management turnover improve the subsequent operating performance regardless of investor protection.  \n\n25 Sometimes more than one restructuring action is taken at a given time. We identify cases where only one action is taken and reestimate regressions. The results are similar for “pure\" layoffs and \"pure” management turnover (not reported). For “pure\" asset sales, however, the coefficients on the legal variable become somewhat more significant both statistically and economically. For example, when we replace Asset sales with pure asset sales for estimation in Table VIII, the coefficient on  \n\n# TableVIlI Joint Effects of Investor and Labor Protection on the Likelihood ofAssetSales  \n\nThis table shows results of country random effects logit regressions using Asset Sales as the depenlent variable for firms located in countries above and below the median of Financier protection.

With the tunneling hypothesis, there is no reason to expect a positive relation between asset diversion and union power. Instead, it predicts a negative relation, because workers may resist such asset reductions to protect their jobs.  \n\nAnother possible explanation for our results concerning asset sales is that asset markets are less developed in low investor protection countries, making it difficult to meet cash demands without a fire sale. Fire sales, in turn, would lead to further deterioration, especially if they involve crown jewels. According to this story, as investor protection gets weaker, asset sales become more costly and will be undertaken only as a last resort, resulting in fewer asset sales. But this prediction contradicts the results reported in Tables IV, VI, and VIII (for below-median countries), all of which show more asset sales as investor protection gets weaker. Yet another possible explanation is that creditors in weaker investor protection countries are more likely to refuse rolling over debt at maturity when firms suffer poor performance, leading to more fire sales. We investigate this possibility in the robustness section and find no support for it.  \n\nBecause the management-labor alliance hypothesis implies that proceeds from asset sales are used to forestall employee layoffs, we examine how asset sales in the year of distress affect layoffs in the year following distress, separately for strong and weak investor protection countries. The results in Table IX are revealing. Although asset sales lead to a significantly higher likelihood of layoffs in strong investor protection countries, no such relation is observed in weak investor protection countries, from which we infer that proceeds from asset sales are used to avoid large-scale layoffs. The interaction term between Asset Sales and Union reinforces this inference. In strong investor protection countries, strong union power helps reduce the incidence of large-scale layoffs stemming from major asset sales. By contrast, in weak investor protection countries union power shows no such effect, apparently because asset sales are done to minimize layoffs with workers? sanction.  \n\nFinally, the alliance hypothesis predicts that in low investor protection countries management turnover is less likely with strong union laws. Thus, we again split the sample by the median investor protection and relate Union to management turnover. The results reported in Table X are consistent with the prediction: The likelihood of management turnover decreases with strong union power only in low investor protection countries.26 In these countries, a poorly performing firm in a bottom-quartile country in Union has a $12.33\\%$ chanceof replacing management, but an otherwise similar firm in a top-quartile Union country has only an $8.07\\%$ chance of changing its management.  \n\nAn alternative interpretation is that strong labor union laws make it easier for managers to avoid dismissal by blaming unions for poor performance. Unions have a reputation for refusing to adapt to new technologies reducing labor costs. Thus, a potential buyer is likely to demand a large discount to deal with uncooperative unions, forcing poorly performing firms  \n\n# TableIX Differential Effects of Asset Sales on the Likelihood of Layoffs by Investor and Labor Protection  \n\nThis table reports the results of country random effects logit regressions using Employee Layoffs nyear $t+1$ as the dependent variable for firms located in countries above and below the median ofFinancier.Specifically:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c l}{{\\displaystyle{\\operatorname*{Pr}(L a y o f f s_{i k(t+1)}=1)=F(\\alpha+\\beta_{1}A S a l e s_{i k t}+\\beta_{2}F i n a n c i e r_{k}+\\beta_{3}U n i o n_{k}}}}\\ {{\\displaystyle{\\qquad+\\beta_{4}A S a l e s_{i k t}*U n i o n_{k}+\\beta_{5}L e v_{i k}+\\beta_{6}O w n_{i k}+\\beta_{7}L e v_{i k}*F i n a n c i e r_{k}}}}\\ {{\\displaystyle{\\qquad+\\beta_{8}L e v_{i k}*U n i o n_{k}+\\sum_{j=9}^{10}\\beta_{j}X_{i k j}+\\varepsilon_{i k})}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nLayoffs $i k(t{+}1)$ is Employee Layoffs at time $t+1$ , and $.A s a l e s_{i k t}$ are Asset Sales at time $t,\\mathrm{F}(.)$ is the logit specification.

This may explain the low management turnover when labor unions are strong and the inferior performance following asset sales. However, this story also predicts that firms with stronger unions are less likely to sell assets because of the greater discount demanded by buyers. But this prediction is contrary to the positive relation  \n\n# TableX Joint Effects of Investor and Labor Protection on the Likelihood of Management Turnover  \n\nhis table reports the results of country random effects logit regressions using Management urnover as the dependent variable for firms located in countries above and below the median f Financier protection.Specifically:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle{\\mathrm{Pr}}({\\cal T}u r n o v e r_{i k}=1)=F(\\alpha+\\beta_{1}F i n a n c i e r_{k}+\\beta_{2}U n i o n_{k}+\\beta_{3}L e v_{i k}+\\beta_{4}O w n_{i k}}}\\ {~+\\beta_{5}L e v_{i k}*F i n a n c i e r_{k}+\\displaystyle{\\sum_{j=6}^{7}\\beta_{j}X_{i k j}+\\varepsilon_{i k}})}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nTurnoverikisManagementTurnoverforfirm $_i$ in country k.

This, in turn, garners worker support to help incumbent managers retain their jobs.  \n\n#### C. Robustness  \n\nWe conduct numerous additional tests to examine whether our results are robust to different model specifications, alternative explanations, sample selection criteria, and variable definitions. For brevity, we describe the results without reporting regression estimates.  \n\nAlthough we control for country random effects, we are concerned with omitted variables that affect both the legal protection of labor and investors and the likelihood of corporate restructuring. A possible candidate for concern is the business cycle, which may jointly affect the probability of restructuring and the legal protection of investors. For example, the Law and Order index, a component of Financier, may be reduced during recessions, when the frequency of asset sales also may increase. Although we control for macroeconomic factors by including year fixed effects, we additionally include the change in the logarithm of GDP per capita as a control variable. Our results remain unaffected. Controlling for inflation and using the change in unemployment level, instead of the change in GDP per capita, do not affect our results.  \n\nIt is possible that our results concerning asset sales and layoffs are due to systematic predistress differences across countries. For example, companies may invest more (less) and employ more (less) workers in countries with strong investor (labor) protection during normal times (i.e., in the base year), leading to a positive (negative) spurious relation between investor (labor) protection and asset sales or layoffs during the distress year. To check this possibility, we estimate country random effects regressions relating NPPE scaled by sales in the base year and the number of employees scaled by sales in the base year to Financier, Emp-Cont, and Union, with industry and year fixed effects. We find no significant relations for any of the legal variables.  \n\nWe also check whether our results on Asset sales are affected by asset liquidations to pay off debt. Creditors may refuse to roll over poorly performing firms’ debt at maturity, forcing asset liquidations. We do not find a significant correlation between changes in NPPE and changes in short-term or total debt. However, there are small but significant correlations between Asset sales and debt changes.27 Thus, we reestimate the regression models for Asset sales while replacing leverage with the change in short-term or total debt (not reported). The coefficients on the changes in both short-term and total debt are not significant for all specifications, while all other coefficients are very similar both in magnitude and significance to those reported in TableVIII.  \n\nFinancial crises in Mexico, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia, Korea, Brazil, and Argentina during our sample period may also affect our results. However, our sample includes only 57 observations from these countries during the year of the crisis and the following year because two-thirds of our observations are after 20oo. Removing the 57 observations from analyses does not change our results.  \n\nTo allow for the possibility that asset sales, layoffs, and turnover are jointly determined as a function of investor and labor protection, we estimate a seemingly unrelated regression model with linear probability specification. The results (unreported) are qualitatively similar.  \n\nWe also use alternative proxies for some of our legal variables. For union power, we use the percentage of total workforce affiliated with labor unions provided by the International Labor Organization (2005) instead of Union. Further, we replace Law and Order with the judicial efficiency measure from Djankov et al. (2003). The results remain similar with both changes.  \n\nAs an alternative measure of ownership concentration, we use the sum of the equity stakes of all shareholders with ownership greater than $5\\%$ .Wealso define ownership concentration as the percentage of shares held by the largest stockholder. Our results do not change with these alternative definitions. When Worldscope does not provide managerial ownership data, we compare the last names and the first initials of the top three officers with those of the shareholders who own more than $5\\%$ of the shares. This adds noise because unrelated people often have the same last name, especially in East Asia. As a robustness check we drop all such matches for the East Asian companies. Our main results areunaffected.  \n\nFor employee layoffs or asset sales, a firm enters our sample if its operating performance is above the industry median in the base year and experiences a drop in EBITDA greater than $50\\%$ in the distress year. To ensure that the base year performance is not a single-year phenomenon, we require that operating performance be above the industry median for two consecutive years prior to the distress year. We also use $40\\%$ and $30\\%$ cutoff points for the drop in EBITDA. Our main results are robust to these changes in sample selection criteria.  \n\nThe definition of leverage and how it triggers debt covenant violations varies across countries. For example, short-term debt in one country may be regarded as long-term debt in another. Thus, we use other measures of leverage such as long-term debt to equity and long-term debt to total assets. Although the magnitude and the statistical significance of the coefficients on leverage and its interaction with the legal variables marginally decrease in some specifications, the main conclusions remain unchanged. Finally, to control for possible serial correlation owing to some firms entering the sample twice, we repeat our analysis with only the first time they become distressed. The results remain unchanged.  \n\n## IV. Conclusion  \n\nWe find that legal protection of labor and investors has pervasive effects on restructuring decisions, and some results are surprising. Contrary to the conventional wisdom that asset restructuring by poorly performing firms is value-enhancing, major asset sales in weak investor protection countries are followed by inferior performance. These value-reducing asset sales are more prevalent when union laws are stronger. Furthermore, poorly performing managers are more likely to retain their jobs when strong union laws are combined with weak investor protection. These findings point toward alliances formed between poorly performing managers and workers, who directly and indirectly protect top managers. Managers, in turn, refrain from worker layoffs and wage cuts by selling assets even when such sales hurt subsequent operating perfor mance.  \n\nThe general theme emerging from our study is that laws matter in determining the relative influence of different stakeholders on the corporate decisionmaking process. More important, our study demonstrates that investor protection and labor laws cannot be studied in isolation, because they are too closely intertwined in determining how firms respond to the competing incentives of investors, labor, and management.  \n\nOur results also illustrate that strong labor laws have unintended and undesirable consequences. Highly protective employment contract laws exacerbate workers plight by inducing more major asset sales during corporate distress. Strong union laws help underperforming managers avoid dismissal through worker-management alliances.  \n\nAlthough these labor laws are not optimal ex post, they may represent equilibrium responses to conflicts among stakeholders in countries subject to different political and social environments. Furthermore, laws concerning consumer protection, environment, and taxes intended to protect other stakeholders may also have important intertwining influences on firm behavior during distress, or more broadly in shaping corporate governance. Perhaps the biggest challenge facing corporate governance researchers is to understand the interplay among the various political, social, and legal factors to prescribe appropriate policies for countries and companies that are subject to different environments.  \n\n## REFERENCES  \n\nBekaert, Geert, Campbell R.
